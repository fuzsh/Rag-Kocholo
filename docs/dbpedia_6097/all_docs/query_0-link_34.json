        "text": "The Department of Classics\n\nDepartment website: https://classics.columbia.edu/\n\nOffice location: 617 Hamilton Hall\n\nOffice contact: 212-854-3902, classics@columbia.edu\n\nDirector of Undergraduate Studies: Professor Nikolas Kakkoufa, Nk2776@columbia.edu\n\nUndergraduate Administrator: Colleen Swift, cks2142@columbia.edu\n\nThe Study of Classics\n\nClassics is the study of the civilizations of ancient Greece and Rome (c. 900 BCE to 500 CE): their languages, literature, history, philosophy, art, and ways of life. The Department of Classics offers\n\na wide variety of courses, geared at students with different interests and at all levels of preparation. These include courses on ancient civilization in all its diversity, classes on ancient literature in translation, and numerous courses in ancient Greek and Latin, from elementary language classes to advanced literature courses. We also offer courses on ancient Egypt as well as the Near East, Medieval Latin, and Modern Greek.\n\nStudent Advising\n\nConsulting Advisers\n\nDirector of Undergraduate Studies: Professor Nikolas Kakkoufa, Nk2776@columbia.edu\n\nStudents should consult with the DUS who will direct them to the appropriate faculty advisor for their research interest area.\n\nEnrolling in Classes\n\nStudents starting in the Major should start with the language placement exam to determine the appropriate language level for their prior knowledge. Exams are administered in late August by the Department of Classics. Students who cannot take the exam should contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies to make arrangements.\n\nFor those students who are starting the major without prior knowledge of the ancient languages please start at the beginning of the sequence (1000 level) in one of the ancient languages and speak to the Director of Undergraduate Studies to determine your best course of study.\n\nPreparing for Graduate Study\n\nhttps://classics.columbia.edu/preparation-for-graduate-study\n\nStudents who are considering graduate work in Classics should be aware that because our Classics major is not a pre-professional degree, simply fulfilling the normal major requirements will not guarantee admission to a graduate program. By far the most important element in preparation for graduate school admission is a good command of both the Latin and the Greek languages, so students who wish to go to graduate school should attempt to reach the advanced level in both languages. The two courses at the intermediate level required in the secondary language for the Classics major are not enough for admission to most graduate programs, and the language requirements of both Classical Studies and Ancient Studies are well below the level normally necessary for graduate school admission. The importance of languages holds not only for students wishing to study ancient literature, but also for those interested primarily in other aspects of the ancient world (history, art, philosophy, religion, etc.), because it is not possible to pursue advanced research successfully unless one can make use of the primary sources. Students who have not done the requisite amount of language work and wish to go to graduate school can enroll in a post-baccalaureate program (either at Columbia or at another institution) to do one or two years of intensive language work before starting graduate school.\n\nWhile knowledge of Latin and Greek is the most important factor in graduate school admission, it is by no means the only one. Students considering graduate work are also advised to write a senior thesis (and not to substitute the thesis for any of the other advanced courses). If possible, it is a good idea to use some of your summers (especially the one between junior and senior year) on a relevant activity such as archaeological fieldwork experience, travel and/or study in Greece or Italy, learning French or German, improving your Latin or Greek, or working as a research assistant for a Classicist. It is also useful to get high scores on the GRE test, and these are best achieved by obtaining and studying information on the types of questions asked on the test and taking practice tests.\n\nThe department does offer a combined BA/MA program in Classics allowing them to complete the MA in Classics within one year of receiving their BA.\n\nThe array of graduate degrees on offer in the US and abroad can be bewildering—including master’s and doctoral programs in Classics and a variety of related subjects—and the character and quality of graduate programs differs widely. It is therefore important to gather information and seek advice.\n\nIf you are considering graduate work, you should discuss your plans with the Director of Undergraduate Studies and other faculty members no later than the beginning of the fall semester before you hope to apply (i.e., typically the fall of your senior year).\n\nCoursework Taken Outside of Columbia\n\nAdvanced Placement\n\nThe department grants 3 credits for a score of 5 on the Latin AP exam, which also satisfies the foreign language requirement, upon successful completion (with a grade of B or higher) of a Latin class at the 3000-level or higher.\n\nBarnard College Courses\n\nThe Department of Classics at Columbia and the Department of Classics and Ancient Studies at Barnard College work closely together. Students may take courses at Barnard to count towards the Major or Minor. Students at Barnard should speak to their advisor at Barnard regarding Columbia courses as the departments are distinct and the requirements for their respective majors are different.\n\nTransfer Courses\n\nStudents transferring to Columbia should contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies to discuss equivalencies and what level of courses they wish to take.\n\nStudy Abroad Courses\n\nSeeing the ancient sites and monuments is an important part of the study of antiquity, and there are a number of ways to acquire some familiarity with the physical remains of Greek and Roman civilization. The Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome offers in each term an excellent one-semester program, usually taken in the junior year, and the College Year in Athens offers a wide variety of courses ranging from language and literature to history, art, and archaeology. During the summer there are more options, including the outstanding Summer Sessions of the American School for Classical Studies in Athens. A listing of fieldwork opportunities is published annually by the Archaeological Institute of America.\n\nSummer Courses\n\nCourses are offered over the summer by the department providing opportunities to study the ancient languages over the summer.\n\nCourses are also offered in Classical Civilization including Worlds of Alexander and Classical Mythology.\n\nCore Curriculum Connections\n\nFaulty and Graduate Instructors from the Department of Classics Teach in the Core, usually Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization.\n\nSome Classics courses can be used to count toward the Global Core requirement as noted in the course information.\n\nUndergraduate Research and Senior Thesis\n\nUndergraduate Research in Courses\n\nStudents should consult with the Director of Undergraduate Studies, Professor Nikolas Kakkoufa at nk2776@columbia.edu. Students can register for Directed readings with a faculty member.\n\nSenior Thesis Coursework and Requirements\n\nStudents are required to take the Major Seminar UN3996 as part of the program. The course focuses on the preparation for the Senior Thesis and methods in the field of Classics. Currently students have the option to participate in a trip abroad to sites in the ancient world.\n\nUndergraduate Research Outside of Courses\n\nStudents are encouraged to participate in the Ancient Play put on yearly by the Barnard Columbia Ancient Drama Group.\n\nThe Department is able to support a limited number of students to study ancient languages over the summer through the Comager Fund and the Undergraduate Latin fund. Interested students should contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies.\n\nUndergraduate students can apply to the SNFPHI Summer Research Internship in Public Humanities and Hellenic Studies. This six week internship invites undergraduate students to explore public humanities, gain hands-on experience with its objectives, methods, and outcomes, and pursue a group project that connects research on Greece with a broad public audience. The internship is structured around: (1) a seminar in Hellenic Studies in which students explore aspects of modern Greek history and culture relevant to their internship research, (2) a workshop in which students are trained in the methods and tools of public-facing research, and (3) a group project in which students work closely with Columbia faculty and public humanities partners in Greece\n\nColumbia runs its own archeological summer program at Hadrian's Villa in Tivoli. Contact Professor Francesco de Angelis.\n\nStudents wanting Columbia or Barnard credit for work done abroad should discuss their plans with the director of undergraduate studies at an early date to enable them to incorporate experience abroad most practically into their programs here.\n\nDepartment Honors and Prizes\n\nDepartment Honors\n\nDepartmental Honors are awarded for overall outstanding performance in the Classics.\n\nAcademic Prizes\n\nThe department offers two prize competitions yearly (Earle and Romaine) in sight translation of Greek and Latin. These prizes are awarded on the basis of examinations given each spring.\n\nTwo prizes are given to graduating Columbia College seniors:\n\nThe Caverly Prize is awarded annually for outstanding performance by a graduating Columbia College major.\n\nThe Stadler Prize is awarded annually to a graduating senior of Columbia College who is judged by the faculty to have demonstrated academic excellence through course work and the writing of a senior essay on some aspect of the history or culture of the classical world.\n\nOther Important Information\n\nStudents interested in majoring in Classics should reach out to the Department early in their academic career. Students should contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies with any questions.\n\nStudents participating in dual degree programs should contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies.\n\nProgram in Hellenic Studies\n\nDepartment website: hellenic.columbia.edu\n\nOffice location: 618 Hamilton Hall\n\nOffice contact: 212-851-0297, hellenic@columbia.edu\n\nDirector of Undergraduate Studies: Prof. Nikolas Kakkoufa; 212-854-3902; nk2776@columbia.edu\n\nUndergraduate Administrator: Eleni Gizas; 212-851-0297; eag2191@columbia.edu\n\nThe Study of Modern Greek\n\nThe Program offers students the opportunity to study Greece through a modern lens and prepares them for professional work or further academic study in the humanities and social sciences, international studies, fine arts or, more recently, more interdepartmental endeavors. At the heart of the curriculum is a series of courses that investigate the relation between language and culture in the Greek-speaking world (including the diaspora) throughout its modern history. The aim has been to build a strong linguistic base on which to construct a greater knowledge of Modern Greek literary, political, social, and cultural currents and attitudes, and also to offer students a theoretical framework for analyzing cultural differences more generally. Since then, Balkan and Mediterranean Studies, but also Classical Reception Studies outside the strict Classics world, have become part of the Hellenic Studies curriculum, especially insofar as they contribute to Global Core, Global Humanities, and interdisciplinary initiatives.\n\nThe Core Faculty of the PHS are Dimitris Antoniou, Chrysanthe Filippardos, Stathis Gourgouris, Nikolas P. Kakkoufa, Paraskevi Martzavou, and Karen Van Dyck. A number of affiliated faculty (but also the HLS faculty that is housed in Classics – Gourgouris, Van Dyck, Kakkoufa) teach and conduct their research in relation with other departments, institutes, and initiatives – notably, the Institute for Comparative Literature and Society (ICLS), the Institute for the Study of Sexuality and Gender (ISSG), the Institute for the Study of Human Rights, the Harriman Institute, and the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Public Humanities Initiative (SNFPHI). Its affiliated faculty members include, among others, John Ma in Classics, Mark Mazower in History, Ioannis Mylonopoulos in Art History and Archaeology, Neni Panourgia in the Justice in Education Program, Elsa Stamatopoulou in Human Rights, Nadia Urbinati in Political Science, and Konstantina Zanou in Italian.\n\nThe PHS organizes and co-sponsors the University Seminar in Modern Greek, a Lecture Series with the Greek Consulate in New York and a number of Hellenic Studies Workshops, Film Screenings, and occasional colloquia that provide a forum of discussion of research in progress on all aspects of Greek Civilization of which our students frequently take advantage. It also maintains a strong collaboration with the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Public Humanities Initiative and the newly established Columbia Global Center in Athens.\n\nStudent Advising\n\nConsulting Advisers\n\nThe Director of Undergraduate Studies (DUS) of the Program in Hellenic Studies in the Department of Classics is responsible for approving courses, overseeing enrollment, advising prospective and current minors, and certifying minors for graduation both in the Minor in Modern Greek Language, Literature, and Culture and the Minor in Hellenic Studies. Students should consult with the Director of Undergraduate Studies, Prof. Nikolas P. Kakkoufa at nk2776@columbia.edu\n\nEnrolling in Classes\n\nStudents are encouraged to consult with the Director of Undergraduate Studies to review course options and requirements.\n\nPreparing for Graduate Study\n\nThe Program in Hellenic Studies does not offer a graduate path of study but it has prepared students for further study in a number of disciplines with a focus on Modern Greece.\n\nCoursework Taken Outside of Columbia\n\nAdvanced Placement\n\nThe Program in Hellenic Studies offers a language placement test the week before the first day of classes in the fall. The test consists of both written and oral parts. Students who wish to schedule the test before the start of the fall semester, or to take a Modern Greek placement test at any other time in the year, or who have particular questions about placing, should contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies.\n\nBarnard College Courses\n\nThe Program in Hellenic Studies offers a Minor in Modern Greek at Barnard College. The Minor requires five courses beyond the Elementary Level. The Minor in Modern Greek is administered through the Department of Classics and Ancient Studies at Barnard College. Students wishing to minor in Modern Greek should consult with the Director of Undergraduate Studies.\n\nTransfer Courses\n\nStudents transferring to Columbia should contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies to discuss equivalencies and what level of courses they wish to take.\n\nStudy Abroad Courses\n\nStudents may wish to enroll in the College Year in Athens Program for a semester-long or summer session. The College Year in Athens offers a wide variety of courses ranging from language and literature to history, art, and archaeology. Students wanting credit for work done abroad should discuss their plans with the Director of Undergraduate Studies at an early date to enable them to incorporate experience abroad most practically into their programs here.\n\nSummer Courses\n\nStudents can enroll in the Travel Seminar, “Mediterranean Humanities in Athens”, organized in partnership with Columbia Global, the Aikaterini Laskaridis Foundation, and the Center for Undergraduate Global Engagement. Students participating in this seminar take Athens, Greece, as a vantage point to explore the multiple ways this body of water has been imagined by the people who lived or traveled across its shores. In this one-week seminar, students immerse themselves in the history and culture of Athens and its environs through a combination of lectures, guided museum visits, educational walks, field trips, and hands-on workshops.\n\nCore Curriculum Connections\n\nModern Greek language courses count towards the Core requirements. The following classes count towards the Global Core Requirement:\n\nGRKM UN3935 Hellenism and the Topographical Imagination\n\nCLGM GU4600 Multilingual Worlds: Translation, Gender and the Greek Diaspora\n\nCSGM UN3567 Thessaloniki Down the Ages\n\nCLGM UN3920 The World Responds to the Greeks: Modernity, Postcoloniality, Globality\n\nCLGM UN3110 The Ottoman Past in the Greek Present\n\nUndergraduate Research and Senior Thesis\n\nUndergraduate Research in Courses\n\nStudents should consult with the Director of Undergraduate Studies, Prof. Nikolas P. Kakkoufa at nk2776@columbia.edu. Students can register for Directed readings (3997), a Senior Research Seminar (3998) or Supervised Independent Research (4460).\n\nSenior Thesis Coursework and Requirements [drop-down] Though a Senior Thesis is not required for graduation it enables a student to be considered for departmental honors. It is advisable to begin planning for the thesis during the junior year. Interested students should identify a potential faculty advisor and discuss their plans with the DUS.\n\nUndergraduate Research Outside of Courses\n\nUndergraduate students can apply to the SNFPHI Summer Research Internship in Public Humanities and Hellenic Studies. This six week internship invites undergraduate students to explore public humanities, gain hands-on experience with its objectives, methods, and outcomes, and pursue a group project that connects research on Greece with a broad public audience. The internship is structured around: (1) a seminar in Hellenic Studies in which students explore aspects of modern Greek history and culture relevant to their internship research, (2) a workshop in which students are trained in the methods and tools of public-facing research, and (3) a group project in which students work closely with Columbia faculty and public humanities partners in Greece.\n\nDepartment Honors and Prizes\n\nDepartment Honors\n\nDepartmental Honors are awarded for overall outstanding performance.\n\nGuidance for Undergraduate Students in Classics\n\nProgram Planning for all Students\n\nThe department offers a major in classics and a major track in classical studies. The major in classics involves the intensive study of both Greek and Latin, as well as their cultural matrix; the track in classical studies offers a more interdisciplinary approach. The major in classics is recommended for students planning to continue the study of classics in graduate school. The department also participates in the interdepartmental ancient studies program and offers a concentration in classics; these are all described below.\n\nThe major in classics and the track in classical studies are designed in part to build on the experience of the ancient world that undergraduates have acquired at Columbia in the Core Curriculum (especially in Literature Humanities). The major in classics is structured on the principle of gradual and closely monitored linguistic progress from the elementary (1100-level) to the advanced (3000- and 4000-levels) and ultimately to the literature survey courses (GU4105-GU4106) in Greek and/or Latin.\n\nThose majors intending to embark on graduate study in classics are especially encouraged to undertake, in their senior year, an independent research project (UN3998). This option is designed to allow students to personalize their experience in the major by conducting advanced study in a specialized area under the guidance of the specializing faculty member of their choice.\n\nUN3998 is required in the classical studies track. Otherwise, students in classical studies are not required to take advanced courses beyond UN3996 The Major Seminar, but are expected to follow a coherent plan of study by taking a sequence of cognate courses in different but related departments (e.g., art history and archaeology, history, etc.).\n\nCourse Numbering Structure\n\nIn both Greek and Latin prerequisites are the course with the number before in the sequence. Students can test out of the prerequisite with a placement test or through the Director of Undergraduate Studies.\n\nIn both languages the sequence is as follows:\n\n1101: Elementary I\n\n1102: Elementary II\n\n1121: Intensive Elementary\n\n2101: Intermediate I\n\n2102: Intermediate II\n\nFor 2101 Either 1102 or 1121 is required as a prerequisite or a placement test.\n\nThe course numbers below are used for both Greek and Latin, except as noted. Please consult the Columbia and Barnard catalogs for full descriptions of all courses.\n\n1101-2: Introductory language course in TWO semesters. This is the normal course taken by those beginning a language not previously studied; it covers all the basic grammar and gives some practice reading easy texts.\n\n1121: This one-semester course is the equivalent of both 1101 and 1102; it covers all the basic grammar in one semester and enables the participants to take courses at the 2100 level the following semester. This is an intensive course, so you should be prepared to make a substantial time commitment.\n\n2101-2: This sequence provides intermediate language training in both prose and poetry. The completion of 2102 satisfies the language requirement.\n\n3012 (Latin only): This is the fifth-semester Latin course and the beginning of the Latin literature sequence. It is highly recommended for incoming first-year students who have had enough Latin to place out of 2101-2 or for those who have completed the intermediate sequence here.\n\n3013 (Latin only): This new course is designed as a sequel or alternative to 3012 and aims to sharpen translation skills by concentrating on classical Latin prose.\n\n3309, 3310, 4009, 4010: These advanced literature courses are offered annually with changes in subject matter so that students will have a chance to read as many representative authors as possible. Courses at the 4000 level are not necessarily more difficult than those at the 3000 level when taken by undergraduates; the significance of the designation is that graduate students as well as undergraduates may take 4000 level courses, but in many cases undergraduates and graduates will not be given the same workload in these courses. Students who are in doubt about the level of a specific class should consult the instructor.\n\n3033, 4152 (Latin only): These courses constitute the sequence in medieval Latin; in most years both will be offered.\n\n3996: The Major Seminar is intended for senior majors in Classics, Classical Studies, and Ancient Studies but is also open to juniors. The course considers a different topic each year, analyzing it across time periods, genres, and both languages. It focuses on honing skills that are useful for working on the senior thesis, such as how to frame a discussion topic, how to analyze a text philologically and thematically, and how to develop a bibliography. The course also provides upper-level students in Classics, Classical Studies, and Ancient Studies with an opportunity to get to know each other in a congenial and interactive environment.\n\n4105-6: The literature surveys are designed to give advanced Classics undergraduates and entering graduate students a grasp of the broader picture of Greek or Latin literature, as opposed to the more focused topics offered in other advanced courses.\n\n5139: This course focuses on enabling students to write, as well as read, Greek and Latin. It consists largely of an intensive review of grammar and syntax at an advanced level, with the translation of sentences or short paragraphs into the ancient languages. Note: This is technically a graduate course, but undergraduates are welcome to enroll with the instructor’s permission. 5139 replaces the old 4139; the content of the course remains the same.\n\nCLASSICAL CIVILIZATION AND LITERATURE IN TRANSLATION\n\nThese courses are designed for both majors and non-majors and are ideal for students with no prior background in the ancient world, though they may also be of interest to more advanced students. Some, such as Classical Myth (3132), are normally offered every year; others are offered in rotation or once only.\n\nGuidance for First-Year Students\n\nThe director of undergraduate studies is responsible for overseeing the path of study followed by each student in classics or classical studies. Through close interaction with the director of undergraduate studies, as well as with other faculty members where appropriate, each major is strongly encouraged to debate the strengths and weaknesses of his or her own trajectory of study even as the requirements for the major are being completed.\n\nStudents should contact the director of undergraduate studies with any questions about the classics majors and course offerings. The director of undergraduate studies can provide students with a worksheet to help in planning their progress toward major requirements.\n\nGuidance for Transfer Students\n\nStudents should contact the director of undergraduate studies with any questions about the classics majors and course offerings. The director of undergraduate studies can provide students with a worksheet to help in planning their progress toward major requirements.\n\nUndergraduate Programs of Study: Classics\n\nRequired Coursework for all Programs\n\nThe major is offered with two tracks, Classics and Classical Studies. The former, which is recommended for students considering graduate work in Classics, concentrates heavily on the ancient languages and literature; the latter can be earned with only one of the ancient languages and includes more courses on other aspects of the ancient world. The Classics department also participates in the interdepartmental Ancient Studies major, which is designed for students whose interests encompass the ancient Mediterranean as a whole rather than the Greco-Roman world in particular. The Classics Concentration/Minor is earned in either Latin or Greek; there is also a Greek/Latin Minor for students of the School of Engineering and Applied Science.\n\nMajor in Classics\n\n11 courses, minimum 34 credits\n\nIn the primary language:\n\nFour courses at or above the 2100-level\n\nMajor seminar 3996\n\nTwo courses from the Advanced Menu of four (4105, 4106, 5139, 3998; any others may count toward the four upper level requirement)\n\nIn the secondary language:\n\nTwo courses at or above the 2100 level\n\nTwo ancient culture courses, including:\n\nOne in the culture of the primary language\n\nOne in any aspect of ancient history or culture (HIST, AHIS, PHIL, CLLT, CLCV…)\n\nA student must write a thesis (UN3998) to be considered for Departmental Honors and prizes.\n\nMajor in Classical Studies\n\n11 courses, minimum 35 credits\n\nFive courses, at or above 1102, in either or both Latin and Greek\n\nMajor Seminar 3996\n\nFour classes in ancient history, art, philosophy, religion, civilization\n\nSenior thesis 3998\n\nMajor in Ancient Studies\n\nStudents interested in a major in ancient studies should see the Ancient Studies section in this Bulletin.\n\nStudents interested in a major in ancient studies should see the Ancient Studies section in this Bulletin.\n\nThe Minors in the Department of Classics are under review and will be made available\n\nFor students who entered Columbia in or before the 2023-24 academic year\n\nConcentration (Columbia College) in Classics\n\n7 courses, minimum 21 credits\n\nSix courses in one classical language (Latin or Greek), of which\n\nFive courses above the 1100 level, three of which must be 3/4000 level\n\nOne from the following three advanced options: 4105, 4106, 5139\n\nOne course in ancient history or classical civilization\n\nProgram in Hellenic Studies\n\nDepartment website: hellenic.columbia.edu\n\nOffice location: 618 Hamilton Hall\n\nOffice contact: 212-851-0297, hellenic@columbia.edu\n\nDirector of Undergraduate Studies: Prof. Nikolas Kakkoufa; 212-854-3902; nk2776@columbia.edu\n\nUndergraduate Administrator: Eleni Gizas, eag2191@columbia.edu\n\nGuidance for Undergraduate Students\n\nProgram Planning for all Students\n\nThe Program in Hellenic Studies offers 1) a Minor in Modern Greek Language, Literature, and Culture, 2) a Minor in Hellenic Studies, 3) a Special Concentration in Modern Greek (for students enrolled prior to Fall 2024), and 4) a Minor in Modern Greek at Barnard College.\n\nThe Minor in Modern Greek Language, Literature, and Culture is designed to offer students an advanced understanding of contemporary Greece with a specialization in the field of Modern Greek Language, Literature, and Culture that is representative of the intellectual breadth of our core Faculty.\n\nThe Minor in Hellenic Studies functions as a cluster of courses that will introduce students to the diachronic study of Greece and could complement the majors in Classics, Classical Studies, Art History and Archaeology, History, etc.\n\nThe Special Concentration is structured around course offerings in Modern Greek Language & Culture Courses and in Modern Greek Studies Interdepartmental courses.\n\nStudents should visit the website for more information or contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies, Prof. Nikolas P.

Kakkoufa at nk2776@columbia.edu.\n\nUndergraduate Programs of Study\n\nMinor in Modern Greek Language, Literature, and Culture\n\nThe Minor in Modern Greek Language, Literature, and Culture (MGLLC) consists of 5 (15-18 credits) courses on top of the successful completion of the Elementary Modern Greek Sequence (8 credits). Students may double count the Intermediate Sequence both for the Language Requirement and for the MGLLC. The focus of the minor is the study of the language, literature, and Culture of Modern Greece. The minor is open to Columbia College and General Studies students.\n\nThe general learning goals of this minor are 1) to provide the training necessary to speak, comprehend, read and write Modern Greek, which would allow students to participate not\n\nonly in basic everyday communications but also to academically interact with primary material in Modern Greek, 2) to offer an awareness of the diverse populations and cultures\n\nin which Modern Greek is spoken (Greece, Cyprus, the Diasporas) and of the sociolinguistic aspect of their language/dialects; a deeper understanding of what language is and does, 3) to\n\nfunction as an introduction to the professional abilities and skills needed to undertake graduate training as scholars in the humanities, translators, and interpreters, 4) to develop\n\nproficiency in the literary and cultural accomplishments of Modern Greek, 5) to acquire and hone skills in the methodologies of close reading of texts and critical thinking, 6) to engage\n\nin diverse methods of inquiry about texts, visual material, and cultural material more broadly, 7) to raise Global awareness and respect for other cultures, and 8) to develop\n\nabilities in articulation of ideas and precision in oral/written presentation. These goals are also enriched by the specific learning goals and methods that our faculty set in their\n\nindividual syllabi.\n\nPREREQUISITE\n\nStudents should have satisfied the Elementary Sequence (GRKM1101, GRKM1102) or demonstrated equal proficiency through a placement test administered by the Program in Hellenic Studies\n\nDECLARING\n\nThere is no formal application to the Minor. Interested students should contact the Program’s Director of Undergraduate Studies, Prof. Nikolas P. Kakkoufa.\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\nFive (15-18 credits) courses on top of the successful completion of the Elementary Modern Greek Sequence (8 credits). Any appropriate course taught in the area of Modern Greek Studies in departments other than Classics must be approved by the DUS. Typically, no more than two courses will be allowed to double-count with a student’s major or the college’s Core Requirements.\n\nGRKM 2101 Intermediate Modern Greek I\n\nGRKM 2102 Intermediate Modern Greek II\n\nStudents who place out of the Intermediate Sequence will have to replace those two courses with the lectures and seminars offered and cross listed by the Program in Hellenic Studies. Students are also strongly encouraged but not required to complete GRKM 3003 prior to enrolling in other classes.\n\nThree additional courses at the 2000 level or above from at least two of the following three categories:\n\nAny course listed by the Program in Hellenic Studies (GRKM, CLGM, CSGM).\n\nAny course cross-listed by the Program in Hellenic Studies with the code GM (courses that contribute to an understanding of some aspect of Modern Greece within larger analytical concepts).\n\nDirected Readings and Independent Study.\n\nThough a Senior Thesis is not required for graduation it enables a student to be considered for departmental honors. It is advisable to begin planning for the thesis during the junior year. Interested students should identify a potential faculty advisor and discuss their plans with the DUS.\n\nMinor in Hellenic Studies\n\nThe Minor in Hellenic Studies consists of 5 courses (15-20 credits). Although there are no prerequisites, the study of either ancient or modern Greek is highly recommended. To ensure this truly interdisciplinary course of study the required classes are based on selecting classes from the following – broadly conceived – distribution requirements: 1) Period, 2) Discipline, 3) Geography.\n\nThe general learning goals of the Minor in Hellenic Studies are: 1) to introduce students to Hellenic studies as a diverse and interdisciplinary field and to interdisciplinary research at Columbia more broadly; 2) to familiarize students not only with Greece as a space at the crossroads of East and West but also with the ways in which different disciplines have\n\nconsidered space across geography and time; 3) to acquire a global perspective on the reception of Hellenic material and to give students vital tools needed to engage in diverse\n\nmethods of inquiry about texts, visual material, and cultural material more broadly; 4) to offer students first-hand exposure to objects of material and visual culture through the\n\nHellenic Collection in our Library (which has, for example, the biggest collection of zines outside of Greece) but also the Museums with Hellenic Collections across the city of New\n\nYork and, hopefully, with the further development of the Global Center in Athens, to research collections and archaeological and historical sites in Greece with study abroad\n\nclasses; 5) to critically think about and problematize the narratives of nations, traditions, and claims to continuity as it affects today’s world through a deep historical and broad\n\ngeographical study 5) to acquire and hone skills in close reading of texts and critical thinking and to develop abilities in articulation of complex ideas and precision in oral/\n\nwritten presentation. It also aims to enrich the students’ undergraduate experience by encouraging them to take part in the diverse activities and programming of the Program in\n\nHellenic Studies and the Stavros Niarchos Initiative for Public Humanities. The minor is open to Columbia College and general Studies students.\n\nPREREQUISITE\n\nThere are no prerequisites for the Hellenic Studies Minor. The study of either ancient or modern Greek is strongly encouraged.\n\nDECLARING\n\nThere is no formal application to the Minor. Interested students should contact the Program’s Director of Undergraduate Studies, Dr. Nikolas P. Kakkoufa.\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\n5 courses (15-20 credits) at the 2000 level or above from at least two of the following three categories:\n\nAny course listed by the Program in Hellenic Studies (GRKM, CLGM, CSGM).\n\nAny course cross-listed by the Program in Hellenic Studies with the code HLNS (courses that contribute to an understanding of some aspect of Hellenic studies in different periods, different disciplinary focus, different geographical contexts).\n\nDirected Readings and Independent Study\n\nStudents will need to complete courses in all three distribution areas: 1) Periods (e.g. Ancient, etc.), 2) Disciplines (Comparative Literature, Queer Studies, Anthropology, Translation, History, Archaeology, etc.) 3) Geography (Mediterranean Studies, etc.) .\n\nAny appropriate course taught in the area of Hellenic Studies in departments other than Classics, must be approved by the DUS. Typically, no more than two courses will be allowed to double-count with a student’s major or the college’s Core Requirements.\n\nThough a Senior Thesis is not required for graduation it enables a student to be considered for departmental honors. It is advisable to begin planning for the thesis during the student’s junior year. Interested students should identify a potential faculty advisor and discuss their plans with the DUS.\n\nFor students who entered Columbia in or before the 2023-24 academic year\n\nSpecial Concentration in Modern Greek\n\nThe minimum credit requirement for the Hellenic Studies Concentration is 21 credits and includes:\n\n1. Modern Greek language and culture courses (Elementary, Intermediate, Advanced, Cultural Dictionary I & II, Readings in Modern Greek; minimum 8 credits). Students will work with the undergraduate advisor to determine their level of the language.\n\n2. Modern Greek Studies interdepartmental courses (CLGM, CSGM, HSGM; minimum 12 credits). The program of study should be planned as early as possible with the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Students meet with the Director of Undergraduate Studies each semester in order to obtain program approval. Opportunities exist for study abroad in Greece, Cyprus and Turkey for the summer or an academic term for credit. Students work closely with the concentration advisor on the selection of the foreign schools and the transfer of credit.\n\nStudents may also wish to write a Senior Thesis which will substitute one Modern Greek Studies interdepartmental seminar. While not required for graduation, the thesis enables a student to be considered for departmental honors. It is advisable to begin planning for the thesis during the student’s junior year. Interested students should identify a potential faculty advisor."
