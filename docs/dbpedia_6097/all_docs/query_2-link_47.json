        "text": "Do you have a toxic person in your life?\n\nDraining, unsupportive, and difficult people are one of life’s greatest challenges.\n\nIn this post, I want to talk about how you can spot, stop, and deal with the toxic people who come into your life. You deserve to have people in your life that you enjoy spending time with, that support you, and that you LOVE hanging out with.\n\nWatch our video below to learn the types of toxic people:\n\nWhat is a Toxic Person?\n\nA toxic person is someone whose behavior adds negativity and upset to your life. These individuals thrive on creating drama, spreading negativity, and draining the energy and happiness of those around them. They are often characterized by their lack of empathy, constant need for attention, and tendency to manipulate or harm others for their gain.\n\nToxic people can come in many forms and can be found in all areas of life—whether it’s a colleague who constantly undermines you, a friend who always brings you down, or a family member who manipulates your emotions.\n\nHere’s the problem: Guilt\n\nWhenever I talk about toxic people, the same categories seem to crop up over and over again:\n\nFriend by History: This is a person whom you have known forever. Maybe you went to elementary school together, or you were neighbors growing up. Now you feel guilty ending the relationship.\n\nFriend by Proximity: This is a person who comes as a package with someone else in your life. Maybe it’s your partner’s best friend, or your friend’s brother who always tags along, or your best friend’s childhood friend. You feel guilty because you don’t want to put your person in an awkward situation.\n\nFriend by Context: This is a person who you see all the time in a specific area of your life–someone you work with everyday… someone on your flag football team… someone who lives across the hall. You feel guilty brushing them off because you see them all the dang time.\n\nSometimes these relationships are casual, but other times they can grow rotten. You end up keeping someone in your life who is jealous or has a totally different set of ethics, and that is when they become toxic.\n\nThe 12 Types of Toxic People\n\nI have identified 12 types of toxic people. These can be helpful in identifying the different types of toxic people to watch out for:\n\nThe Conversational Narcissist\n\nHave you ever been talking to someone who keeps interrupting you? Maybe I should revise that sentence: have you ever been trying to talk to someone who won’t let you get a word in? Conversational narcissists LOVE to talk about themselves—or just hear themselves talk.\n\nThey don’t ask you any questions, they don’t wait for your responses, and they won’t shut up. In a relationship, these people will end up being completely self-centered, and will never be attentive to your needs.\n\nThings a Conversational Narcissist Might Say:\n\n“Enough about you, let me tell you about my day!”\n\n“Oh, that reminds me of when I…”\n\n“I know exactly how you feel, because I…”\n\nHow to Handle a Conversational Narcissist:\n\nSet Boundaries: Politely interrupt and steer the conversation back to a balanced exchange. You can say something like, “I’d love to hear more, but can we first finish what I was saying?”\n\nAsk Direct Questions: Keep the focus on a two-way dialogue by asking them specific questions about what you were discussing. For example, “What do you think about this particular aspect?”\n\nLimit Interaction: If possible, limit your time with them to avoid feeling drained. It’s okay to prioritize your own mental well-being (and it’s TOTALLY worth it!).\n\nFor example, Kanye West has often been cited as a conversational narcissist, according to Shaquille O’Neal .\n\nYou can see this behavior during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards when Kanye interrupted Taylor Swift’s acceptance speech to declare that Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time:\n\nThe Strait Jacket\n\nThe straitjacket is someone who wants to control everything and everyone around them. They want to be in charge of what you do, what you say, and even what you think. You know the person I am talking about—they freak out when you disagree with them, and won’t stop trying to convince you that they are right and you should do what they say.\n\nIn a relationship, this person will give you no breathing room and will constantly nag you until you are in complete alignment with them. Be careful, these people will go after your emotional, conversational, and mental freedom until you have nothing left. Get out while you can!\n\nThings a Strait Jacket Might Say:\n\n“You should do it my way if you want it done right.”\n\n“Why don’t you ever listen to me?”\n\n“You need to change how you think about this.”\n\n“I know what’s best for you.”\n\nHow to Handle a Strait Jacket:\n\nAssert Your Boundaries: Clearly state your limits and stick to them. Let them know what behavior you will not tolerate. For example, “I appreciate your input, but I need to make my own decisions.”\n\nMaintain Independence: Keep your own interests, hobbies, and social circles. Don’t let them isolate you or control all aspects of your life. Spend time with supportive friends and engage in activities that make you happy.\n\nSeek Support: Talk to friends, family, or a professional who can provide perspective and support. It’s important to have a support system outside of the straitjacket’s influence.\n\nRed Flags to Watch Out For:\n\nIntense Jealousy: They are jealous of your relationships with others, trying to control who you spend time with.\n\nInflexibility: They refuse to compromise or consider your opinions, insisting that their way is the only way.\n\nIsolation Tactics: They try to cut you off from friends, family, or activities that don’t include them, making you more dependent on them.\n\nThe Emotional Moocher\n\nAn emotional moocher is also known as a “spiritual vampire,” because they tend to suck the positivity out of you or bleed you emotionally dry. These are the people who always have something sad, negative, or pessimistic to say. In conversations and relationships, they can never see the positive, and tend to bring everyone down with them.\n\nIf you’re with someone and they only have bad things to say whenever you see them, watch out; it might not get better.\n\nThings an Emotional Moocher Might Say:\n\n“Nothing ever goes right for me.”\n\n“You won’t believe how awful my day was.”\n\n“Why does this always happen to me?”\n\n“I just can’t catch a break.”\n\nHow to Handle an Emotional Moocher:\n\nSet Emotional Boundaries: Politely limit the time you spend listening to their complaints. You can say politely, “I’m sorry you’re feeling this way, but I can’t talk about this right now.”\n\nEncourage Solutions: Guide the conversation toward problem-solving. Ask, “What do you think you can do to improve the situation?”\n\nStay Positive: Maintain your own positive outlook. Share uplifting thoughts and steer conversations towards more positive topics.\n\nRed Flags to Watch Out For:\n\nConstant Complaining: They rarely have anything positive to say and focus on the negative aspects of every situation.\n\nEnergy Drain: You feel emotionally exhausted and drained after interactions with them.\n\nVictim Mentality: They consistently see themselves as victims of circumstance, never taking responsibility for their own happiness.\n\nEeyore is a classic example of an emotional moocher. His constant negativity and pessimism can drain the energy of everyone around him. Eeyore often makes remarks that highlight his sadness and misfortune, such as “Oh well, I suppose I’ll just keep walking” and “It’s not much of a tail, but I’m sort of attached to it.” While he is a beloved character, his perpetual gloominess is a textbook case of an emotional moocher:\n\nThe Drama Magnet\n\nSome toxic people are magnets for drama. Something is always wrong. Always. And of course, once a problem is solved, another one emerges. And they only want your empathy, sympathy, and support–but not your advice! You offer help and solutions, but they never seem to want to fix anything. Instead, they complain and complain.\n\nIn a relationship, drama magnets are victims and thrive in a crisis, because it makes them feel important. If someone is a beacon for adversity, watch out, you might one day become part of the drama.\n\nThings a Drama Magnet Might Say:\n\n“You won’t believe what happened to me this time!”\n\n“Why do these things always happen to me?”\n\n“I just can’t catch a break, everything is a disaster!”\n\n“I need to vent, my life is falling apart!”\n\nHow to Handle a Drama Magnet:\n\nSet Boundaries: Clearly communicate your limits. For example, “I can listen for a few minutes, but I can’t get deeply involved right now.”\n\nEncourage Action: Shift the focus to solutions. Ask, “What steps can you take to improve this situation?”\n\nStay Neutral: Avoid getting emotionally involved. Offer empathy without being drawn into the drama, such as, “That sounds tough. Have you considered any solutions?”\n\nRed Flags to Watch Out For:\n\nConstant Crisis: They always have some sort of drama or crisis happening in their life, and it never seems to resolve.\n\nVictim Mentality: They see themselves as perpetual victims of circumstance and rarely take responsibility for their own role in the issues.\n\nRefusal to Change: Despite receiving advice and support, they never seem to take steps to improve their situation, preferring to stay in a state of crisis.\n\nThe JJ\n\nA JJ is a jealous-judgmental person. My friends and I can spot a JJ from a mile away, and I want to show you how to as well. Jealous people are incredibly toxic because they have so much self-hate that they can’t be happy for anyone around them.\n\nAnd typically, their jealousy comes out as judgment, criticism, or gossip. According to them, everyone else is awful, uncool, or lacking in some way. If someone starts to gossip jealously about other people, watch out, this might be a toxic person—and you never know what they say about you behind your back.\n\nThings a JJ Might Say:\n\n“Did you hear about so-and-so? They think they’re so great, but…”\n\n“I can’t believe they got that promotion. They don’t deserve it.”\n\n“She’s just lucky. It’s not like she’s actually talented.”\n\nHow to Handle a JJ:\n\nAvoid Engaging in Gossip: Steer conversations away from gossip and negative talk. You can say, “I’d rather not talk about others behind their backs.”\n\nHighlight Positivity: Counter their negativity with positive comments. For example, “I think it’s great that they achieved that. Good for them!”\n\nDistance Yourself: Limit your interactions with them to protect your own positivity and well-being. Prioritize spending time with supportive and uplifting people.\n\nRed Flags to Watch Out For:\n\nFrequent Gossip: They are constantly talking about others in a negative light.\n\nCritical Nature: They are quick to judge and criticize others, often without reason.\n\nInconsistent Behavior: They may act friendly to someone’s face but speak badly about them behind their back.\n\nMiranda Priestly, played by Meryl Streep in “The Devil Wears Prada,” is a great example of a JJ. Throughout the movie, Miranda constantly belittles and criticizes those around her, particularly her assistant, Andy. Her cutting remarks and her need to undermine others to maintain her position of power are clear!

Whether they tell little falsehoods or major lies, it’s impossible to trust a liar in a relationship.\n\nDishonesty drains us because we are constantly doubting their words. If your intuition is ringing alarm bells, then watch out; get out before you’re lied to.\n\nThings a Fibber Might Say:\n\n“I never said that” (when you know they did).\n\n“I was just about to tell you.”\n\n“You must have misunderstood me.”\n\nHow to Handle a Fibber:\n\nSeek Evidence: Politely ask for details or proof when you suspect dishonesty. For example, “Can you show me the email where that was mentioned?”\n\nTrust Your Gut: If something feels off, trust your instincts. It’s okay to question things that don’t add up.\n\nSet Consequences: Make it clear that dishonesty is unacceptable and outline the consequences for lying. For example, “I need honesty in our relationship, or we won’t be able to move forward.”\n\nRed Flags to Watch Out For:\n\nInconsistent Stories: Their stories frequently change or don’t add up.\n\nDefensiveness: They become defensive or aggressive when questioned.\n\nOverly Detailed Accounts: They provide unnecessary details to make their lies more believable.\n\nThe Tank\n\nA tank crushes everything in its wake. A human tank is always right, doesn’t take anyone else’s feelings or ideas into account, and constantly puts themselves first. In a relationship, tanks are incredibly arrogant and see their personal opinions as facts. This is because they often think they are the smartest person in the room, so they see every conversation and person as a challenge that must be won over.\n\nThey rarely see others as equals—and this can be challenging when trying to form a loving connection. If you feel your ideas are being run over, or you are not being respected, get out while you still can!\n\nThings a Tank Might Say:\n\n“You’re wrong, and here’s why.”\n\n“If you listened to me, you wouldn’t have this problem.”\n\n“I’m just being honest; you need to hear the truth.”\n\nHow to Handle a Tank:\n\nStand Your Ground: Firmly but calmly express your opinions and feelings. For example, “I understand you see it differently, but this is important to me.”\n\nUse “I” Statements: Focus on your perspective to avoid confrontation. Say, “I feel disrespected when my ideas are dismissed.”\n\nLimit Interaction: Reduce the amount of time you spend with them if possible. Protect your mental well-being by keeping interactions brief and to the point.\n\nRed Flags to Watch Out For:\n\nDominance: They dominate conversations and make decisions without consulting others.\n\nDismissiveness: They dismiss others’ ideas and feelings as unimportant or wrong.\n\nLack of Empathy: They show little to no concern for how their actions or words affect others.\n\nDr. Gregory House, played by Hugh Laurie in the TV series “House M.D.,” is a quintessential tank. He constantly bulldozes over the opinions and feelings of his colleagues, believing his medical knowledge and diagnostic skills are superior to everyone else’s (even if they are!).\n\nHis famous line, “Everybody lies,” showcases his dominant and cynical worldview:\n\nThe Gossiper\n\nGossipers thrive on drama and often spread rumors or share private information about others. They enjoy stirring the pot and creating conflicts, leaving you feeling uneasy and mistrustful. If someone constantly talks about others behind their backs, chances are they’re talking about you too.\n\nIn a relationship, these people will never keep your confidence and will use your secrets as currency in their drama.\n\nThings a Gossiper Might Say:\n\n“Did you hear what happened to…?”\n\n“I really shouldn’t say this, but…”\n\n“You won’t believe what so-and-so did.”\n\nHow to Handle a Gossiper:\n\nShut Down Gossip: Politely but firmly refuse to participate in gossip. Say, “I’d rather not discuss someone who isn’t here to defend themselves.”\n\nProtect Your Privacy: Keep your personal information to yourself. Don’t share secrets or sensitive information with someone who gossips.\n\nChange the Subject: Steer the conversation away from gossip to more neutral or positive topics. For example, “That’s interesting, but have you heard about…?”\n\nRed Flags to Watch Out For:\n\nConstant Rumor-Spreading: They frequently share unverified stories or rumors about others.\n\nBetrayal of Confidence: They disclose information that was shared with them in confidence.\n\nEnjoyment of Drama: They seem to enjoy the chaos and conflict that their gossip creates.\n\nThe Competitor\n\nThe competitor is always in a silent contest with you. No matter what you achieve, they have to one-up you. This person turns everything into a competition, making it difficult to celebrate your successes without feeling undermined or overshadowed.\n\nIn a relationship, this constant rivalry can erode your self-esteem and make you feel like you’re never enough… even though they’re the ones who usually feel the most insecurity.\n\nThings a Competitor Might Say:\n\n“Oh, you got a promotion? I got one last year that was even bigger.”\n\n“You ran a 5k? I just completed a marathon.”\n\n“I’ve done that before, but better.”\n\nHow to Handle a Competitor:\n\nCelebrate Quietly: Keep some achievements private and share only with those who genuinely support you. This limits their ability to compete.\n\nDeflect the Comparison: Politely redirect the conversation away from competition. Say, “I’m happy for both of us. Let’s focus on celebrating our successes.”\n\nRed Flags to Watch Out For:\n\nConstant One-Upping: They always try to outdo your accomplishments, no matter how small.\n\nUndermining Success: They belittle or overshadow your achievements with their own.\n\nCompetitive Conversations: Every discussion turns into a comparison or contest.\n\nThe Passive-Aggressive\n\nPassive-aggressive individuals express their negative feelings indirectly. Instead of addressing issues openly, they make snide remarks, give backhanded compliments, or engage in subtle sabotage often out of anxiety of direct confrontation.\n\nTheir behavior can leave you feeling confused and frustrated, often doubting your perceptions. In a relationship, this can lead to a toxic cycle of miscommunication and resentment.\n\nThings a Passive-Aggressive Might Say:\n\n“I guess I’ll do it, since no one else will.”\n\n“Oh, you’re going out again? Must be nice to have so much free time.”\n\n“I thought you knew what you were doing.”\n\nHow to Handle a Passive-Aggressive:\n\nAddress Behavior Directly: Call out the behavior calmly and directly. For example, “It seems like something is bothering you. Can we talk about it?”\n\nEncourage Open Communication: Foster an environment where they feel safe expressing their feelings honestly. Say, “I’d rather you tell me directly if something is wrong.”\n\nRed Flags to Watch Out For:\n\nBackhanded Compliments: They frequently give compliments that are actually disguised insults.\n\nSubtle Sabotage: They intentionally do things to undermine your efforts or create inconvenience.\n\nAvoidance of Direct Confrontation: They consistently avoid addressing issues directly, preferring indirect methods of expressing dissatisfaction.\n\nHere’s an interesting example from the comedy show “Satuday Night Live” in which they showcase an extremely passive-aggressive manager named Pam:\n\nThe Victim\n\nThe victim never takes responsibility for their actions and always blames others for their misfortunes. They constantly seek sympathy and expect others to fix their problems. Being around a victim can be draining, as they refuse to empower themselves and rely heavily on your emotional support.\n\nIn a relationship, this dependency can stifle your growth and leave you feeling overwhelmed.\n\nThings a Victim Might Say:\n\n“Why does this always happen to me?”\n\n“It’s not my fault, it’s theirs.”\n\n“I can’t do anything about it, I’m just unlucky.”\n\nHow to Handle a Victim:\n\nEncourage Responsibility: Gently prompt them to take responsibility for their actions. For example, “What do you think you can do to change the situation?”\n\nPromote Empowerment: Encourage them to find solutions and take proactive steps. Ask, “What’s one small thing you can do to improve this?”\n\nRed Flags to Watch Out For:\n\nConstant Blaming: They never take responsibility and always find someone else to blame for their problems.\n\nSeeking Sympathy: They frequently seek pity and expect others to solve their issues.\n\nLack of Initiative: They show little to no effort in trying to improve their situation or take proactive steps.\n\nThe User\n\nUsers exploit your kindness and generosity for their gain. They only reach out when they need something and disappear once they get it. This one-sided relationship can leave you feeling used and unappreciated, draining your emotional resources without reciprocation. In a relationship, this imbalance can make you feel undervalued and taken for granted.\n\nThings a User Might Say:\n\n“Can you do me a favor?”\n\n“I really need your help with this.”\n\n“You’re the only one I can count on.”\n\nHow to Handle a User:\n\nSay No: It’s important to decline requests that feel exploitative. You can say, “I’m sorry, but I can’t help you with that.”\n\nSeek Reciprocity: Encourage a more balanced relationship by asking for mutual support. For instance, “I helped you with this, can you help me with something next time?”\n\nRed Flags to Watch Out For:\n\nOne-Sided Requests: They only contact you when they need something and disappear afterward.\n\nLack of Gratitude: They rarely show appreciation or reciprocate your kindness.\n\nEmotional Draining: You feel exhausted and unappreciated after interactions with them.\n\nBonus #1: Toxic People in Relationships\n\nDraining, unsupportive, and difficult people are one of life’s greatest challenges, and it gets even more complicated in relationships. In this section, I want to dive into what toxic behavior looks like in relationships, the red flags to watch out for, and what you can do if you find yourself in one.\n\nWhat Does Toxic Mean in a Relationship?\n\nA toxic relationship is characterized by behaviors that are emotionally damaging, manipulative, or controlling. These relationships lack mutual respect, support, and healthy communication. Instead, they are filled with constant negativity, drama, and emotional turbulence. A toxic partner may exhibit jealousy, deceit, criticism, or selfishness, leaving you feeling unappreciated and emotionally exhausted.\n\nFor example, ave you ever felt like you were walking on eggshells around your partner? Sarah always did with her boyfriend, Mark. He constantly criticized her choices, from her career to her friends, making her feel like she couldn’t do anything right.\n\nWhenever she tried to address her feelings, Mark would twist the conversation to make it seem like she was overreacting. Sarah realized she was losing her sense of self and decided to seek help from a licensed professional therapist. This helped her set boundaries and eventually leave the toxic relationship.\n\nRed Flags to Look Out For:\n\nConstant Criticism: They regularly belittle or criticize you, undermining your self-esteem and making you feel inadequate.\n\nControl Issues: They want to control what you do, who you see, and how you think. Your independence is seen as a threat.\n\nJealousy and Possessiveness: They display excessive jealousy and possessiveness, often accusing you of things you haven’t done.\n\nManipulation: They use guilt, fear, or manipulation to get their way, making you question your own reality.\n\nLack of Support: They are unsupportive of your goals and interests, focusing only on their own needs and desires.\n\nWhat to Do in a Toxic Relationship:\n\nAcknowledge the Problem: The first step is recognizing that you are in a toxic relationship. Denial will only prolong your suffering.\n\nSet Boundaries: Clearly define what behaviors you will not tolerate. Communicate your boundaries firmly and stick to them.\n\nSeek Support: Talk to trusted friends, family, or a therapist who can provide objective advice and emotional support.\n\nPrioritize Self-Care: Focus on your own well-being. Engage in activities that make you happy and reduce stress.\n\nBonus #2: Dealing With Difficult People (The Effective Way)\n\nNow that you know about the 7 types of toxic people, how do we deal with them effectively? You’ve got some of the basic tips, but here’s a more in-depth look into how to deal with difficult people (both in work and in relationships):\n\nEliminating Toxic People = Enhancing Your Life!\n\nDid someone pop into your head as I explained these toxic personality types? If you have someone in your life whom you dread seeing, who doesn’t respect your opinions, or who makes you feel bad about yourself in any way, then you need to just say no.\n\nDo you feel:\n\nYou have to constantly save this person and fix their problems\n\nYou are covering up or hiding for them\n\nYou dread seeing them\n\nYou feel drained after being with them\n\nYou get angry, sad or depressed when you are around them\n\nThey cause you to gossip or be mean\n\nYou feel you have to impress them\n\nYou’re affected by their drama or problems\n\nThey ignore your needs and don’t hear ‘no’"
