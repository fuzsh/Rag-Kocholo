        "text": "1/10 and 10/10 at the same time...\n\nThis movie should be watched on hallucinogens in the dark of movie theater. Unfortunately, I had to watch it on my computer while eating chicken wings. In the first case I would probably rate it 10, but completely straight I could not avoid being irritated by all its flaws.\n\nThe idea is great, the story well developed, although told in a completely twisted way typical for Gaspar Noe. Camera and photography are works of genius, use of colors and strobe, bird's-eye view, unbelievable visual adventure. Though, epileptics and those with hypersensitive eyes should definitely avoid this ride or at least watch it in bright light. You risk a serious headache because, as much as it is beautiful, it is also very heavy for eyes.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems that Noe got into it too deep and lost control after a while. The movie is unnecessarily too long. Scenes of tripping on hallucinogens last five to ten times longer than it would be humane towards the audience. Also, astral flights, between every two scenes Oscar is watching, are too slow and too long. If he cut all of that in half, the movie wouldn't lose any of its meaning or visual poetics, but it would be cut down from almost three hours to under two hours and he would avoid the danger of having half of the audience leaving the theater before the movie ends.\n\nThis movie definitely isn't for a mainstream audience. It is too long, too confusing, very explicit in showing drugs and sex, and extremely tiring for eyes. But although I was at the edge of giving up in the first half an hour, the movie slowly pulled me in its world and then it gave me two more hours of hypnotizing ride.\n\nIt is very hard for me to rate it. When I have to force myself to watch it till the end, I give it 1/10 or maybe 2/10, depending on the successfulness of that forcing. And when a movie gives me such an amazing ride like this one did and leaves me under strong impressions, it is usually 9/10 or 10/10. But this is the first time I saw a movie that meets both criteria. Still, despite all the flaws, I think this movie is worth more than it seems at first glance.\n\n!!! SPOILER ALERT !!!\n\nAt the very beginning of the film, when they mentioned reincarnation and explained how exactly it works and looks like, I instantly knew how this movie will end. And to be honest, it would be stupid to end it any differently. Although, I would make a slight change in it. I would reincarnate Oscar into his own incest child. Somehow it seems to me that movie this sick has to end even sicker. :D\n\n8/10\n\nGood movie, terrible name\n\nAt first, I was rejected and disgusted, but then I decided to give it another chance without prejudice.\n\nTechnically speaking, the movie is very well done, far better than almost every other Serbian movie I ever saw, and as I am Serb I saw quite a few. Story... OK, it's morbid, sick, disturbed, even insane, but the warning is clearly stated: drama/horror/mystery, so those who do not like horrors are warned and should skip it. Nobody forces them to watch. However disturbing it may be, in its own genre it is not so shocking, no more than \"Hostel\" or \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" for example. It has an easy introduction, a good plot, few nice twists, and an ending typical for its genre. The quality screenplay, pretty good acting and, for Serbia, fantastic production. Within the genre, it's surely the very best Serbian movie.\n\nThe main issue with this movie, the thing that makes it controversial and repulsive for a domestic audience and even lovers of the genre, is its name. \"Hostel\" was not named \"Czech Movie\", it was named \"Hostel\". This country, if we had a real one thou, should have censored this title and force authors to change its name before releasing the movie. They had no right to represent our country this way. There's enough prejudice against Serbia and other Balkan countries already, we do not need more negative representations. After all, it is just a movie and it should be observed like fiction that it is, but under a different name, more fitting to the horror genre, it would be much better accepted.\n\nFor the movie: 7/10\n\nFor the title: 0/10, and the one who came up with it should be sued or simply kicked in the butt."
