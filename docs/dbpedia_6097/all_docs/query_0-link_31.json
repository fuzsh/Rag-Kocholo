        "text": "January 2011.\n\nWhip It\n\nstarring Ellen Page, Marcia Gay Harden, Kristen Wiig, Drew Barrymore, Juliette Lewis, Jimmy Fallon, Alia Shawkat, Andrew Wilson, Landon Pigg and Daniel Stern\n\nscreenplay by Shauna Cross\n\ndirected by Drew Barrymore\n\nRating: ♦♦♦♦◊\n\nBased on the novel Whip It by Shauna Cross, who also wrote the screenplay, the Japanese title “Rollergirl Diary” is a little more explicative. “The Whip” is a roller derby play. I used to watch roller derby - men’s and women’s - on TV in the 1970s.\n\nWhip It is Drew Barrymore’s directorial debut, and it’s good. It’s a girl’s movie. It gives us romance and sex, humor, friendship, despair, alienation and angst, search for oneself and for escape from one’s family from a teenage girl’s perspective. It is a coming of age film like American Graffiti (1973) in that it features a teenager bursting to escape her small town. In the case of American Graffiti it was Richard Dreyfus in rural California, but in this case it’s Ellen Page in rural Texas. I thought of Janis Joplin, whose spirit was too big for Port Arthur, or Buddy Holly whom Lubbockcould not contain. Bliss (Ellen Page) feels like a square peg in a round hold in tiny Doreen. So she gravitates to Austin, the big city, where she discovers her element in women’s roller derby.\n\nRoller Derby players bring to mind a vast field of socially misunderstood professions that many of us are at best only vaguely aware of. There is a whole subculture consisting of jobs like strippers, professional wrestlers, motor cross racers, circus performers, tattoo artists, night club bouncers, rodeo clowns, street musicians, etc. Working jobs like these doesn’t mean that the people are less virtuous, caring, intelligent, loving, ambitious, etc. than anyone else. When I see a movie like Whip It, or The Wrestler (2008, Mikey Rourke) I appreciate the feeling I get of the common humanity that unites us.\n\nThis is the second feature movie I have seen with Ellen Page (Juno, 2007, directed by Jason Reitman). She has that gothic girl next door look that regularly reminds me of Thora Birch, the adolescent feminine libido that reminds me of my first girlfriend, and that short black haired Japanese boy look with Bohemian manners that remind me of my old friend, Laura B. This is also the first film I have seen Daniel Stern in since Home Alone 2 (1992). Really. I was happy to see him after first being shocked by his aged appearance. Well, it’s only natural. Home Alone was a long time ago. It’s also the first time I have seen Juliette Lewis in a dog’s age. She has been busy in recent years pursuing a thrash rock career away from movies. But maybe now she is gravitating back to film. As soon as I saw Andrew Wilson, even with a heavy beard and sunglasses I knew it was a Wilson brother. How many Wilson brothers are there in the movies? Owen, Luke, Andrew. Any more?\n\nFinally, Whip It is a story set in Texas, but where are the Texas accents? Not from Andrew Wilson. He sounds like my idea of a Californian. Not from Ellen Page. She is a Canadian from Halifax, NS. I could be way off the mark about accents, but I think it’s a minor flaw.\n\nJanuary 2011.\n\nExtraordinary Measures\n\nstarring Brendan Fraser, Harrisonford, Keri Russell,. Meredith Droeger, Diego Velazquez, Sam M. Hall, Jared Harris and Courtney B. Vance\n\nwritten by Robert Nelson Jacobs\n\ndirected by Tom Vaughan\n\nRating: ♦♦♦♦◊\n\nBased on the book The Cure by Geeta Anand, Extraordinary Measures is a very moving account of two parents’ mission to find a treatment for Pompe’s Disease (a form of Muscular Dystrophy) that is slowly killing two of their three children. This is only the first or second time I have seen Brendan Fraser perform a serious adult on film. He does a reasonable job of it.\n\nI compare Extraordinary Measures to the 1992 movie directed by George Miller, Lorenzo’s Oil (starring Nick Nolte, Susan Sarandon, and Peter Ustinov). The former is the true story of the Crowley family’s quest to find a cure for their two terminally ill children, while the latter is the true story of the Odone family’s quest to find a cure for their son, Lorenzo’s rare disease (adrenoleukodystrophy). As a form of muscular dystrophy that the Crowley’s contended with, Pompe’s Disease is a muscle-wasting genetic disorder. The Odone’s foe was, ALD, caused nerve damage by slow damage to the layer of insulating lipids that surround nerve cells.\n\nAlong the way both families clash with doctors and scientists skeptical that anything can be done. (I remember reading in the papers here about Lorenzo Odone’s death at the age of 30 in May 2008.)\n\nFraser plays John Crowley, a pharmaceutical company executive who founds his own pharmaceutical company with a researcher, Dr. Robert Stonehill (Harrison Ford). While he is fairly fluent with the relevant science, Crowley - a businessman - is still a medical layman. Stonehill is an easy-to-hate anti-social researcher only interested in the science and not at all interested in business (a necessary evil) - or in human patients and people in general. Their struggle to get an effective drug made gives an interesting and frustrating window into the pharmaceutical business. It’s very disheartening to anyone interested in health care, especially health care for sufferers of incurable diseases - the sheer fortune needed to research, launch, and market a new drug; the clash of for-profit capitalism with human suffering and altruistic compassion; the laws and regulations surrounding the development, testing and marketing or new drugs. Thank goodness the story has a happy ending, otherwise I would have left this film feeling only anger, which is not what I want. As it turns out, it’s a very heartwarming family story. Watch it."
