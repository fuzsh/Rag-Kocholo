        "text": "A Timeline of Abortion Stories in U.S. Popular Media\n\nThis timeline includes short summaries of U.S. TV shows and popular movies which have prominently featured characters with unexpected pregnancies who seriously consider or have an abortion. Here I am only including fictional U.S. and Canadian TV shows and movies with relatively wide releases. Some of these actually don’t quite fit these guidelines but I find them amusing or instructive.\n\nIf you see something missing, please leave a comment below and I will add it.\n\nSpecial thanks to Rebecca Kielty for her many contributions!!! Rebecca also shared the following links: a Wikipedia category page for films about abortion, this 2012 list and article about abortion on TV, “Good Girls Avoid Abortion,” and a TV Tropes page.\n\n1916 – Where Are My Children?\n\nWhile prosecuting a physician for the death of a client after an abortion, the district attorney discovers that his wife helped her society friends and the daughter of her maid obtain and pay for abortions from the physician (and was perhaps herself also a client.) Director/writer Lois Weber, made this film as an indictment of abortion, bringing in eugenics and birth control to leave the impression that they are inextricably linked to all abortions. The movie was banned in Pennsylvania on the grounds it would tend to corrupt morals. The National Board of Review passed the film for adults only.\n\n1928 – The Road to Ruin\n\nA controversial, low-budget drama about the life of a young teenage girl that goes on the “road to ruin.” Sally is a 16-year-old New York City teen who, neglected by her parents, takes up smoking and drinking, engages in affairs with a series of older men, gets arrested by the police during a strip poker game, is sent home only to discover later that she’s pregnant, and after getting an illegal abortion, the words “The Wages of Sin is Death” inexplicably appear over her bed in fire. Then she dies. Her last words are, “It seemed like such a beautiful road…”\n\n1933 – Ann Vickers\n\nAs the Great War breaks out, Ann Vickers, a serious, independent and forthright woman, falls for an officer who jilts her before she can tell him she’s pregnant. After an abortion, she throws herself into social work. This movie is adapted from a novel by Sinclair Lewis!\n\n1934 – Men in White\n\nA nurse, fearful of telling her colleagues she needs an abortion, goes to a back-alley abortionist and gets a botched abortion. A noble doctor (Clark Gable!) performs an operation on her to save her. The word abortion, in keeping with the times, is not used and is referred to somewhat obliquely.\n\n1934 – Dr. Monica\n\nAn OB/GYN, Dr. Monica (Kay Francis) is creates a series of urban maternity clinics designed by her best friend, and architect (Veree Teasdale). The twist is that of course the doctor can’t have children of her own. Her other best friend (everyone’s rich) is what used to be called an “aviatrix” (Jean Muir). She has an affair w/Monica’s husband (Warren William), gets pregnant. There’s a scene, censored, where she asks Monica for an abortion; Monica’s horrified reaction is left in, so you get the gist. She has the baby (revealing the name of the father during labor, which causes more drama), leaves it for Monica, then gets in her plane and flies out over the Atlantic with only 2-hours fuel in the tank–suicide by airplane. So, Monica and hubby get the baby, and the aviatrix pays for her sins = happy ending… All of this is packed into an hour-long running time. The odd thing is that the film has feminist qualities: The three woman are all professional and accomplished, in contrast to the husband who is a bum of a novelist living off his wife’s wealth and having an affair with her best friend. But the sexual mores of the era demand punishment for the friend, turning the whole thing upside down. (Description provided by Shawn Stone; thanks Shawn!)\n\n1939 – Modern Motherhood\n\nMolly discovers she is pregnant. She considers getting the child aborted until she visits the local movie house and sees a film about sex hygeine. She is so upset by the movie, particularely an abortion scene, that she decides to keep the child. Returning home to husband Ted, she informs him of her condition. He goes out drinking for several days. Eventually he realizes his place is with his wife and their child. Molly gives birth to a boy, and they live happily ever after.\n\n1951 – Detective Story\n\nDetective McLeod (Kirk Douglas!) discovers that his sweet wife had a sterility-enducing back-alley abortion years before at the hands of the same slimy miscreant he has been trying to convict and send up the river for good.\n\n1951 – A Place in the Sun\n\nA young trusting poor factory worker named Alice (Shelley Winters!) wants to have an abortion because her boyfriend George doesn’t want to marry her. The doctor’s advice: “Go home to your mother.” He refuses to provide an abortion and Alice begs George to marry her. George, the main character, murders Alice as part of his plan to move up in society by getting a rich girlfriend (Elizabeth Taylor!). Based on Theodore Dreiser’s novel An American Tragedy.\n\n1959 – The Best of Everything\n\nA young woman, one of four main characters, is seduced by a playboy who gets her pregnant. She jumps from a moving car to avoid the abortion she realizes he is about to force on her. She survives, loses the baby, and falls in love with an intern at the hospital.\n\n1960 – You’re Ruined Me, Eddie!\n\nRich girl Joan has a secret summer fling with laundry mechanic Eddie, and thinks nothing of revealing to him the fact that he’s gotten her pregnant and she plans on aborting the baby. Eddie pressures Joan to keep the baby, at least so he can start a new family line (he grew up in a repressive orphanage). Joan staunchly refuses despite his declaration of love and need as well as his slapping her around and screaming that she has to marry him! She goes to her rich snobby daddy about the matter. He tries throwing money at Eddie to buy him out, but cash cannot buy Eddie’s affections for his unborn child. Worse, her daddy (and her black maid Mamily) seem to think that abortion is immoral. Crazed with determination to never give birth, Joan grabs her daddy’s pistol and kills Eddie. The End.\n\n1960 – Saturday Night and Sunday Morning\n\nIn Alan Sillitoe’s screenplay adaptation of his own novel, working class playboy Arthur Seaton (Albert Finney) gets a married woman, Brenda, pregnant. Illegal abortion is mentioned when Arthur discusses the matter with his aunt, but Brenda ultimately decides to carry the pregnancy to term.\n\n1962 – The Shame of Patty Smith\n\nIt’s a lovely summer evening and young lovers Patty and Alan have a run-in with a trio of young hooligans who rape poor Patty while Alan is held back and forced to watch. Alan calmly drives Patty home, who refuses to go to the police out of embarrassment and terror. To make matters worse, Patty discovers she is pregnant and is forced to ask her friendly roommate Mary for help in obtaining an abortion. We follow Patty as she goes from place to place, seeking help for her problems, but is turned away by doctors and priests before she finally is forced to sell family heirlooms and borrow money to pay for a back-alley abortion organized by sleazy rotund Bruno VeSota. She meets a wife and husband team who are as American as apple pie, running an abortion clinic out of a fitness center with a fake medical license and no knowledge of how to perform the procedure properly.\n\n1963 – Love With The Proper Stranger\n\nAngie, a sweet salesgirl, gets pregnant after a fling with the scoundrel musician Rocky.

A very awkward love story ensues… sort of.\n\n1964 – Another World (Soap Opera, NBC)\n\nTV’s first abortion story. Pat Matthews is convinced by her playboy boyfriend to get an illegal abortion.

She leaves this husband to marry Jake. A few years and at least one child later, Jo is deeply depressed, and then discovers she is pregnant again, and this time Jake tells her she has to have an abortion and get sterilized. Jo consents to an abortion and sterilization in the belief it will make her marriage happy again, but afterwards things only get worse for her.\n\n1966 – Alfie\n\nAlfie (Michael Caine) is the ultimate Ladykiller. He is wonderfully successful with women. He also rarely gets emotionally involved with them. He has a series of reversals in which his health is threatened, he has a child who is adopted by another man, and gets a married woman pregnant and must procure an abortion for her. The woman is Lily (Vivien Merchant), the dutiful wife of a nervous friend. And it is a mild seduction of Lily one afternoon while he is driving her home that brings Alfie to the grave calamity that lets us sense what a heel he is. Their affair leads to pregnancy and Alfie arranges for her to have an illegal abortion in his apartment. When he returns after the procedure, he is shocked when he sees the baby that has been aborted as well as the toll that abortion has taken on the woman. The abortion is the final element adding to Alfie’s sense that he has once again hurt more than helped as well as missed out on a love relationship he could have had with a child.\n\n1972 – Maude (Sitcom, CBS)\n\nA 45-year-old primetime main character named Maude Findlay (Bea Arthur) finds out she is pregnant and decides to have an abortion. With this episode, Maude became the first primetime show to feature the lead character getting an abortion. This episode caused a wave of controversy. Some CBS affiliates refused to broadcast this two-part episode and many others refused to rerun it. 65 million people tuned in to the second airing of the episode, giving it a 41% market share.

According to Rachel Fudge of Clamor magazine, “Maude’s producers cooked up the abortion storyline in response to a challenge from the group Zero Population Growth, which was sponsoring a $10,000 prize for sitcoms that tackled the issue of population control.”\n\n1972 – Cabaret\n\nA musical set in Berlin at the dawn of Hitler in a seedy cabaret. Liza Minelli plays Sally Bowles, a careerist hedonist who wantonly has an abortion despite the protests of suitor Brian.

A college girl finds out she is pregnant and doesn’t know what to do. She turns to her mother for advice, who confides in her daughter her own abortion story. The movie primarily follows the mother’s experiences in a very sympathetic way.

And she’s suddenly not sure she and Craig used protection when they had sex. Not knowing where to turn (it’s sure not going to be her strict mom), Manny turns to Emma’s mom Spike, the one person she knows who’s been in her shoes.

(Drama, WB)\n\nRyan Atwood finds out his (working class waitress) ex-girlfriend Theresa is pregnant and that it is most likely his child. This causes some problems with his new (wealthy and mannered) girlfriend Marisa. Theresa tells Ryan she will have an abortion, which makes him sad. After talking to Ryan’s mother, though, Theresa changes her mind and decides to keep the baby. (It is insinuated that Ryan’s mother has had an abortion that she regrets.) This also makes Ryan sad, since he will have to leave his fabulous life in the O.C. beach community he has come to call home to get a job and take care of his baby. He moves in with Theresa reluctantly. Theresa pretends to have a miscarriage to “free” Ryan of his responsibility to her and return to the O.C. just in time for the next season to start.

Ultimately Mimi was released from jail when it was proven that Jan’s coma was an accident, but Belle revealed to Rex the truth about Mimi’s abortion and Rex dumped Mimi as a result of her lies.

A British film nominated for many Oscars. While impressed by the film’s portrayal of the post-war nation, Jennifer Worth criticized director Mike Leigh’s over-simplification of illegal abortion. Worth was a midwife in Britain from 1953-73, and saw the often fatal effects of practices like those used by Leigh’s heroine. The danger in such a sympathetic interpretation, Worth argued, is that painting illegal evacuations of the uterus as safe (Drake assures a woman that after flushing her uterus with a mixture of household chemicals, she may feel uncomfortable but in a couple of days will bleed and “it will all come away”) erases the true history and horror of non-medical attempts at abortion. Worth’s book Call the Midwife inspired the BBC series of the same name.\n\n2004 – Alfie (remake)\n\nJude Law updates Michael Caine’s famous cad, engaging in a drunken night with his best friend/co-worker’s girlfriend Lonette during a temporary split.

Later, however, Alfie finds out that Lonette did not have the abortion and visits the couple and the infant. This replaces Caine’s illegal abortion scene, where Caine sees the aborted remains. Marlon’s discovery of the infidelity spells the end of this Alfie’s closest friendship, but no abortion, legal or otherwise, takes place.\n\n2004 – South Park (Comedy/Animation, Comedy Central)\n\nIn a Christmas story written by Cartman, Stan helps little woodland creatures build a manger for the birth of their savior.

Through the movie there are high tension moments where Bella defends her decision to keep the child despite the fact that her experience is unheard of and gradually appears to be compromising her health. Both sex and birth are portrayed, but not as graphically and violently as described in the book Breaking Dawn (2008). The discussion of the pregnancy in both book and film adaptation involves phrases like “that thing” and “take care of it” implying an assumption that Bella should choose abortion when the upshot of carrying to term appears to be the baby CHEWING ITS WAY OUT of her body. But none of the risks dissuade the recent high school graduate from her conviction to give birth. And as mentioned above, she turns into a vampire to spend the rest of forever with her husband. Which is what she wanted anyway. According to Dorothy Pomerantz (Forbes, 2012), the previous year saw author Stephanie Meyer earn $14 million, and the Twilight films were estimated to have earned $2.5 billion in box office sales worldwide.\n\n2012 – American Horror Story: “Coat Hanger” (S2: Asylum E9, FX)\n\nLana and Kit plan to kill trapped Dr. Thredson after obtaining a confession from him about the women he has killed and skinned as serial killer Bloody Face.

Possessed Sister Eunice later tells Lana the coat hanger abortion failed, she is still pregnant, and the child is a boy.\n\n2012 – Girls: “Vagina Panic” (S1 E2, HBO)\n\nJessa schedules an abortion, but gets to avoid it as it turns out she’s not pregnant.\n\n2012 – Prometheus\n\nAlien prequel; archaeologist Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) discovers, despite being convinced she is infertile, that she is 3 months pregnant with an alien child after sex 10 hours previously with an infected crewmate. Despite insisting the android David (Michael Fassbender) help her terminate, he refuses due to an ulterior motive to breed the alien. Her solution is to GET HERSELF IN A ROBOTIC MEDPOD AND CUT OUT THE TENTACLED ALIEN FETUS. She requests a caesarian from the medpod, but it was designed for men, so instead opts for abdominal removal of a foreign object. Later she uses her child (which survived and grew) in self defense, and flees the scene without it. Shaw’s decisions are viewed as survival against the alien (David: “didn’t think you had it in you…sorry- poor choice of words”), compared to Bella’s anthropomorphic vampire/human pregnancy dilemma in Breaking Dawn. Themes of creation and curiosity over origins motivated the expedition, and resurface when we learn about Shaw’s infertility (disappointed with inconclusive findings after landing, Shaw’s lover insensitively quips- “what we do know…there is nothing special, about the creation of life”), and the question of why humans were created if only to be destroyed.\n\n2013 – Orange is the New Black: “Bora Bora Bora” (S1 E10, Netflix)\n\nDiscovering that Daya is pregnant by him, Bennett freaks out about not being told, and about the fact that she wants to carry to term.

Then Daya’s mother Aleida shows up, argues, and tells Bennett, “you’ve got nine months” to figure out how to help raise his child.\n\n2013 – House of Cards: “Chapter 13” (S1 E13, Netflix)\n\nClaire Underwood (Robin Wright) tells her doctor that she has had three abortions.

This is a simmering head to tensions all season over what Claire and her husband Chief Whip Francis Underwood have given up for each other’s careers. Earlier in this episode we also see Claire with the young affiliate entrepreneur she fired who is suing for wrongful termination of employment due to pregnancy. During an argument, she places Claire’s hand on her visibly pregnant belly. This and a nightmare Claire describes to her husband where she watches dead Peter Russo’s children snatched by vines culminate in the audience realizing that Claire, if not Francis, is considering whether children were missing from her life. By the episode’s end, Francis has been offered the Vice Presidency and Claire, instead of mentioning the doctor’s appointment, suggests he go for a run with her.\n\n2013 – Rita “The Grown Up”, “And Baby Makes Three” (S02, E01 & 03, Netflix)\n\nE01: “The Grown Up”\n\nRita decides to have an abortion after becoming pregnant with her ex-boyfriend Tom.

She then takes a prescribed mifepristone pill in her bathroom at home.\n\nE03: “And Baby Makes Three”\n\nRita’s fifteen year old student Emma comes to school excited about being pregnant, talking about how she can’t wait to be a mom. Rita assumed Emma would want an abortion and is frustrated and confused as Emma insists she wants to raise her child. When it becomes clear that the father does not want to be a part of the pregnancy, Emma tells Rita it is her choice anyway so it doesn’t matter what he thinks. Tom and Rita meet up and Rita asks his forgiveness for aborting their child. He refuses. So Rita writes him a letter explaining that it was a hard choice, but the right one, and that it fell to her to make it for both their sakes. After a babysitting visit with Gustav, intended to show how difficult childcare is, Emma remains determined until she sees Bitten and Gustav with Ricco. The next day after class, Emma cries and asks Rita if not having the baby will mean she is weak, admitting that she wants a family but perhaps not now. Rita comforts her and says it is a hard decision and reassures Emma about making it for herself and the father.\n\n2013 – Parenthood “Small Victories” (S04, E13, NBC)\n\nDrew’s girlfriend Amy reveals that she is pregnant and wants an abortion. Neither tells their parents, in Amy’s case because her parents, particularly her father, would be disappointed. Amy is terse with Drew, accepting his help but clear that they are not going to be a couple. She gets an appointment the day after her initial consultation, and asks Drew to help with the money for the abortion (which Drew gets from his older sister Amber, who is the only person he confides in about the pregnancy). While Drew takes Amy to Planned Parenthood appointments and states that he supports her decisions, the episode closes with Drew going to his mother Sarah and crying. The scenario is unique as it includes a supportive teenage boyfriend, Planned Parenthood workers offering descriptions of all Amy’s options, and a teenager deciding that abortion is the best decision for her and hers to make. But the storyline cuts no corners on the emotions involved, including sexually active minors maneuvering reproductive healthcare access, and Drew’s as a partner in a terminated pregnancy.\n\n2014 – Obvious Child\n\nIndie film directed by Gillian Robespierre and starring Jenny Slate.

Logan dies at the end of the episode, having turned into a werewolf to defend Jeremy and Rachel from Aleister. In his last moments, Rachel apologizes for lying about the baby and Logan makes her promise to tell their son everything about him, that he was his dad.\n\n2015 – Jane the Virgin (S01 E13, CW)\n\nJane talks to her mother and grandmother about whether to get an amniotic fluid test (amnio) to check for early signs of illness or health conditions in the child she is carrying.
