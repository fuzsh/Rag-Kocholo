        "text": "My Life in Ruins\n\nThis topic contains:\n\noverall comments and recommendations\n\ndetails of classification and consumer advice lines for My Life in Ruins\n\na review of My Life in Ruins completed by the Australian Council on Children and the Media (ACCM) on 16 July 2009.\n\nAbout the movie\n\nThis section contains details about the movie, including its classification by the Australian Government Classification Board and the associated consumer advice lines. Other classification advice (OC) is provided where the Australian film classification is not available.\n\nACCM review\n\nThis review of the movie contains the following information:\n\na synopsis of the story\n\nthemes\n\nuse of violence\n\nmaterial that may scare or disturb children\n\nproduct placement\n\nsexual references\n\nnudity and sexual activity\n\nuse of substances\n\ncoarse language\n\nthe movie’s message\n\nA synopsis of the story\n\nGeorgia (Nia Vardalos), who has come to Greece from America to work as a professor of ancient history, has lost her job as and is now reluctantly working as a tour guide. Her boss Maria (Bernice Stegers) is not happy with her, as her tours are generally rated as “average” which is actually the worst rating that you can get. As a result Maria gives Georgia the less appealing customers and is looking for a chance to get rid of her.\n\nMaria’s other tour guide, Niko (Alistair McGowan), is very popular and offers to make Georgia’s latest tour so miserable that she will quit. Georgia is given an old bus and an uncommunicative hairy bus driver called Poupi Kacas (Alexis Georgoulis). Her group travels in convoy with Niko’s tour and he does everything possible to show her up. Georgia feels that yet again she is doomed to spend four days with tourists who don’t share her interest in Greek history and somehow missing out on life.\n\nThis time, however, it’s different. She meets Irv (Richard Dreyfuss), an older member of her group with wisdom and humour who shows her how she can make her tour fun and also regain her own sense of humour. She also finds that there is more to the bus driver than she first thought.\n\nNone of concern\n\nThere is some violence in this movie including:\n\nA tourist attacks Niko for giving him an inappropriate t-shirt and he takes a swing at him and they fall in the pool.\n\nMaterial that may scare or disturb children\n\nChildren in this age group are unlikely to be disturbed by anything in this film\n\nChildren in this age group are unlikely to be disturbed by anything in this film\n\nChildren in this age group are unlikely to be disturbed by anything in this film\n\nChildren in this age group are unlikely to be disturbed by anything in this film\n\nProduct placement\n\nThe following products are displayed or used in this movie:\n\nAustralian tourists appear to be drinking ‘Fosters Beer’ on and off throughout the movie\n\nSexual references\n\nThere are some sexual references in this movie, including:\n\nGeorgia says she ‘hasn’t had sex in forever’\n\nIrv tells her she needs to have more sex\n\nWhen Georgia complains about the price of the postage to the hotel proprietor, he offers to give her a discount if she has sex with him. His approach is particularly sleazy.\n\nPoupi touches Georgia’s breast, which she is uncomfortable about.\n\nNiko gives one tourist a T-shirt and tells him the words mean ‘I love Greece’. They actually mean ‘Enter at rear end’ so that at one point, much to his horror, he is being chatted up by a couple of gay men.\n\nNudity and sexual activity\n\nThere is some nudity and implied sexual activity in this movie, including:\n\nGeorgia and Poupi kiss. The next scene finds them in bed together\n\nGeorgia walks out of her room wrapped in a sheet and finds Irv at the door of his room with a couple of the women from the tour.\n\nUse of substances\n\nThere is some use of substances in this movie, including:\n\nThe Australian tourists drink beer fairly constantly\n\nIrv smokes a cigar\n\nThe tour group drink alcohol at an evening function\n\nCoarse language\n\nThere is some coarse language and putdowns in this movie, including:\n\n‘ass’, ‘arsehole’, dick, ‘crap’\n\nIn a nutshell\n\nMy Life in Ruins is a romantic comedy focusing on the importance of relaxing and listening to yourself and others. It is only by doing this that you can fully enjoy life.\n\nValues in the movie which parents may wish to reinforce with their children include\n\nfriendship\n\nacceptance of others\n\ntolerance and looking beyond appearance\n\noptimism\n\nThis movie could also give parents the opportunity to discuss the real life consequences of shoplifting. Constant shoplifting by one elderly tourist is played for comedy in the film."
