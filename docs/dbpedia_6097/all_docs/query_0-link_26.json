        "text": "Welcome back to the Insecure Writer’s Support Group. The IWSG convenes the first Wednesday of every month to commiserate over worries, fears, doubts, and struggles.\n\nThis month’s question is:\n\nNovember is National Novel Writing Month. Have you ever participated?\n\nThis year will be my tenth year officially participating, and lucky number thirteen of total participation. I began books in November in 2010, 2011, and 2012, inspired by NaNo, but I didn’t register on the site because I mistakenly believed the goal was to write a book complete at only 50K. Once I learnt you only have to type 50K as a bare minimum and don’t need to finish your book, and can even add to a book already in progress, I finally signed up.\n\nI later retroactively, honestly added my wordcounts for those three unofficial Novembers to my stats page. The only reason I didn’t win my first year, 2010, was because I started on 18 November instead of the first of the month.\n\nAnd yes, I still have very mixed feelings about continuing to participate when the NaNo brass in Berkeley constantly take such polarizing political positions and refused to back down when their four municipal liaisons in Israel called out their antisemitism and dangerous misinformation.\n\nAfter some consideration, I decided my 2023 NaNo project will be “Rising from the Rubble” from Cinnimin, the numbering of its part yet to be determined (though somewhere in the sixties), which follows immediately upon the heels of “Charlotte’s Most Terrifying Prophecy,” my July Camp project.\n\nThough it was a valuable experience and very convenient to type part of this book, which has been 99.9% handwritten since I began it in 1993, that didn’t make me want to switch over to all typing, all the time. That’s what the later transcription and editing are for!\n\nSo many people who’ve never written an entire book by hand, or who haven’t done that since they were very young, genuinely don’t understand how anyone could voluntarily do that when we have computers. They also assume it makes the writing and editing process much longer and more cumbersome.\n\nBut for me, returning to writing by hand is an emotionally powerful return to my roots. I’ll continue typing all my other books, but for Cinnimin, why fix what wasn’t broken? When I finally returned to the long-hiatused Part LVI, “Crossing the Point of No Return,” I could physically feel myself decompressing, like I was finally back where I belonged, like nothing ever changed.\n\nAs I’ve written about many times prior, NaNo had a very deleterious effect on my writing, and it was severely compounded by lockdown. Without realising it, I fell into permanent editor mode and was mentally blocked from letting books write me instead of the other way around.\n\nWhen you write by hand, you have no choice but to keep going straight ahead. You don’t have the option of constantly writing and rewriting lines, parts of lines, and paragraphs over and over again. You’re stuck with the words on the page, and can only do minor edits like crossing out a misspelling or wrong word and writing the correct one above, or adding in a word you forgot in a sentence.\n\nEssentially, you have the joy of pure, unbridled, unadulterated creation, just putting one word after another, without the constant stress of second-guessing and premature editing.\n\nI’ll have to manually count my words and put the numbers into a lorem ipsum generator, but I’ve done that with other handwritten material (mostly journal entries) in many prior NaNos. The only difference is that this time I’ll be counting many more words. Being the pedantic nitpicker I am, I’ll count every word instead of guesstimating by the average number of words on a page.\n\nSince I count creative nonfiction towards my NaNo goal, some of my material will come from blog posts and thus not be 100% handwritten.\n\nDoing more handwriting will also give my eyes a break from looking at the computer screen so many hours a day, and perhaps reduce my chronic tension headaches. Plus, it’s easier to take a notebook and pens to write-ins than a computer, plug, and mouse.\n\nHandwriting engages the brain in a more personal and emotional way than typing, and we tend to better remember things written by hand. Since I’m ambidextrous, I don’t need to worry about hand pain.\n\n“Rising from the Rubble” is set from 12 September 2001–25 June 2002, and focuses on 9/11 survivors rebuilding their lives. It’ll open with a Pashto proverb meaning “After darkness, there is light.”\n\nHave you ever written NaNo by hand? Would you ever do it?\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nI cannot believe my frightening senior year at UMass–Amherst during the height of the Second Intifada (2001–02) now seems relatively tame and safe compared to what’s happening now. Let’s take a look at what I had to deal with:\n\nGraffiti all over the Five Colleges (UMass, Amherst College, Hampshire College, Mount Holyoke College, Smith College), including direct incitements to violence condemned by our Chancellor. I saw some of it in person, written on bus stops and newspaper dispensers. The worst was “No safety for Jews if no liberty for Palestinians.”\n\nHuge antisemitic and historically revisionist messages scrawled in chalk on roads and sidewalks, like blaming Israel for Lebanon’s actions in 1982.\n\nAll our flyers (even for a peace vigil for victims of the Second Intifada in November 2001) being defaced. Some of my friends found the first floor flyers already defaced at Hampshire (by far the worst offender) when they stepped out of the lift taking them down from the top floor. Our flyers for every single Jewish and pro-Israel event were burnt, scrawled with antisemitic messages, and had swastikas written on them. They even defaced our flyers for my Israeli dance group! I went to the campus police station with two of my male friends to report the swastikas, and they were recorded as hate crimes.\n\nAll this graffiti and vandalism was so bad, we started keeping tabs on it, photographing it, collecting the defaced flyers, reporting the locations, keeping all the evidence in a ledger.\n\nAgitators coming to our rallies in the city of Amherst itself (off campus) and trying to disrupt these events by holding up poorly-made cardboard signs and getting into arguments with people. My friend Aura was in tears from fighting with one of these pricks, esp. because he was denying the existence of Mizrachi Jews. She said Saddam Hussein’s missiles in the Gulf War were specifically targeted towards the heavily Iraqi areas of Israel, and thus were trying to kill her family.\n\nHussein Ibish (an extremely obese Lebanese man) came back to campus to give a speech. He was last there during the Gulf War and was instrumental in causing antisemitism to rise like a rocket. Before his talk, my friends and I looked through the archives documenting his reign of terror ten years earlier.\n\nHis talk was actually fairly on-topic, mostly about anti-Arab racism (and keep in mind this is in the immediate wake of 9/11, when Islamophobia and anti-Arab racism drastically rose). When he opened the floor to questions after his speech, the first person asked why Arabs are counted as white on the census when they’re not considered white (by either themselves or others) at any other time. After that excellent question, it became an Israel-bashing fest that had nothing to do with anything he’d spoken about.\n\nThe campus newspapers, both the main paper and the smaller left-wing papers run by various student groups, were full of anti-Israel screeds, historical revisionism, and antisemitism. People were even trying to sell or give away these papers at tables outside our pro-Israel events.\n\nIn one of the most terrifying moments of my life, a non-student in his fifties walked into a lecture by Mitchell Bard (whom I helped to bring to campus with Student Alliance for Israel, which I’m very proud to be a charter member of), looking like a terrorist. His face was covered by a keffiyeh, and he wore a puffy jacket. I didn’t feel that kind of full-body terror again until my car accident in August 2003.\n\nI thought he had a gun, and our Resident Director Dan (who’s Israeli and has since moved home to Tel Aviv) thought he was a suicide bomber because of the puffy jacket. During the rest of the lecture, this psycho stood by a wall trying to intimidate us with his presence. I was shaken up for some time afterwards.\n\nWe had a huge community-wide, interfaith rally in May 2002, which I got a few local businesses to sponsor and display flyers for (including the awesome Mystery Train Records, which has since moved to a larger store on another street). Local TV stations and newspapers covered it. I still have one of the signs I made, which I held during the rally. My other sign said “Hate speech is not protected by the First Amendment.”\n\nA group of anti-Israel clowns showed up during this rally and tried to disrupt it by holding up their stupid, poorly-constructed signs. Unlike our signs, made with large, quality pieces of poster paper and markers, theirs were made of small pieces of ripped-off cardboard. One of them had their pet PRATT (point refuted a thousand times), “Arabs are Semites too.”\n\nThe word antisemitism was specifically coined to refer to anti-Jewish hatred and give it a scientific-sounding name! It never had anything to do with anti-Arab racism, and by the way, there’s no such thing as a Semitic people. That adjective refers to languages.\n\nBut as frightening as all that was, at least I never had to contend with huge mobs baying for Jewish blood with the full approval of professors and other faculty, holding up signs with explicit calls for genocide and ethnic cleansing, disgusting Holocaust inversion, outright antisemitism not even trying to disguise itself as progressive politics, and historical revisionism.\n\nI also never experienced the sheer terror of being locked in the library for my own safety as pro-Hamas demonstrators banged on the doors and shouted antisemitic slogans, while cops didn’t arrive for forty minutes. Those Jewish students at Cooper Union had to be escorted to safety through an emergency exit tunnel, and now feel too unsafe to go to classes or even leave their apartments.\n\nThe masks are completely off. Antisemites are beside themselves with glee at the chance to finally openly air their repugnant beliefs to the huge celebration of most media and many universities. And this is the same lot who hightails it to a safe space if you dare say a woman is an adult human female or that it’s dangerously unhealthy to be 200 pounds overweight.\n\nAntisemitism really never did fully disappear after the Shoah. It just went underground and mutated form until the winds shifted and carried it screaming back to the surface. The pre-1950 status quo has indeed returned, and many of us no longer feel safe in countries that long seemed like they were immune from such hatred.\n\nAt least now we have our indigenous homeland to run to when it’s not safe anywhere else. We don’t have to remain in Diaspora among people who wouldn’t blink an eye at our mass murder, torture, and ghettoisation.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nIf you’re observing Yom Kippur, may you have an easy and meaningful fast!\n\nInspired by the love story of Penelope and Ulysses, a number of my couples have been separated for many years, and when they finally find one another again, there’s a very emotional reunion. That works in some circumstances, like Sparky and Lazarus, who were on different continents during WWII and unable to even get in touch by mail afterwards because of the chaos and disruption of war. It also works for Cinnimin and Levon separated by the Vietnam War and the psycho God-complex general holding Levon hostage years after the war ends.\n\nBut in the case of Mancika Laurel, Cinni’s granddaughter, and her soulmate best friend Ammiel Garfinkel, who are so perfectly matched and so intimately close they’re routinely mistaken for a couple? It makes no sense for Ammiel to abandon Mancika at the worst time in her life!\n\nMy original plans for the 9/11 part of Cinnimin involved Mancika coming in from Hempstead, Long Island to stand watch for her roommate Courtnie, and then walking back home over the Brooklyn Bridge. While evacuating, she’d collapse in a coughing fit from all the toxic dust and debris in the air (which she’s also coated with) and be unable to get back up.\n\nAmmiel finds her while coming from the other direction in search of her, and carries her home. He spends the next month or so helping to take care of her, and then splits without any explanation.\n\nFour and a half years later, when they’re living in Paris, Mancika sees a man at an outdoor café proposing to a woman who rejects him. They get into an emotional argument, and he runs to jump off a bridge. When Mancika catches up to him and he turns around to face her, Ammiel is overcome with shame and remorse for how he walked out on her.\n\nThey go back to Mancika’s apartment and spend all night talking, and Ammiel explains his disappearing act. As dawn starts breaking and a thunderstorm strikes, they become lovers.\n\nIt doesn’t make any sense for Ammiel to walk away from his best friend, his twin soul, because Mancika directly experienced all those traumatic events and he didn’t. That’s not in his character or their relationship dynamic at all!\n\nI considered changing it to them going away to Courtnie’s family’s summer house in the Hamptons and becoming lovers, closer and happier than ever. Ammiel would then leave without explanation. I also thought about him leaving a note or confessing he was thinking about leaving because he felt their friendship had been ruined, but just couldn’t do it.\n\nIn the first two scenarios, I thought about Mancika becoming pregnant and then introducing him to their child at the reunion in Paris.\n\nInstead, Ammiel rescues her when she’s starting to sink into the rubble of Ground Zero (which New Yorkers called The Pile) during a desperate attempted search for Courtnie and family friend Raizel Brandt-van Acker. Ammiel completely transforms from his usual beta male self into a decisive alpha who takes charge of the situation, gets her out of the city, and takes care of her every step of the way.\n\nAs Ammiel tells her many times, those hours when he had no idea where she was or even if she were still alive were the worst moments of his life. Losing her would’ve emotionally destroyed him, and the day’s events woke him up to the realisation of just how much she truly means to him. Mancika instantly senses his feelings for her have changed, and she finds her own feelings have also shifted.\n\nThat night in their safe haven in the Poconos, Ammiel confesses his feelings, and Mancika says she feels the same way. They become lovers, and their first child is conceived from their very emotional first union. In the spring of 2002, they’ll be married, and their daughter will be born in June.\n\nIt’s enough of a jerk move to walk out on your longtime best friend with no explanation, but even more of a jerk move to do so after she survives a terrorist attack that gives her PTSD and lung issues. Reuniting them four and a half years later isn’t sexual tension, it’s just making Ammiel look like a terrible person and fair-weather friend.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nContent warning: This post contains extremely intense descriptions of the 9/11 terrorist attack.\n\nWelcome back to Weekend Writing Warriors and Snippet Sunday, weekly Sunday hops where writers share 8–10 sentences from a book or WIP. The rules have now been relaxed to allow a few more sentences if merited, so long as they’re clearly indicated, to avoid the creative punctuation many of us have used to stay within the limit.\n\nThis comes from “Charlotte’s Most Terrifying Prophecy,” very late contemporary historical fiction from Saga VII (the 2000s) of my magnum opus Cinnimin. Charlotte Lennon, a distant foremother of Cinnimin’s family, wrote a book of prophecies in the 17th century, both about her descendants and the world. Every single one has come true exactly as she described it.\n\nIt’s told in montage style, with some sections happening simultaneously to one another, and very sparse dialogue by design. We now get back to 23-year-old Mancika Laurel, who was in the World Trade Center Mall when the cataclysm started and has resolutely stayed as close as possible since escaping. She refuses to leave until she knows her roommate Courtnie and family friend Raizel are safe.\n\nMancika’s new watchpost was a short distance from the ruins of St. Nicholas Church and the burning apartment on her right. She guessed she must be somewhere on Greenwich St., but it was impossible to know for sure in the absence of any distinguishing, unobscured landmarks or street signs. This depressing grey streetscape was so disorienting, and left her feeling as if the entire morning had been a surreal dream from which she would awaken any moment.\n\nShe was about to turn away from the sight of yet another person jumping out of the building when a humongous mushroom cloud of black smoke enveloped the upper floors and fanned out in all directions. An even louder collective primal scream erupted as the North Tower proceeded to disintegrate behind the smoke and the mushroom cloud rapidly billowed out, filling the entire area. Mancika’s entire body went numb, and she couldn’t compel her feet to carry her away from this marauding menace once again choking out all signs of life in its path. She just continued staring straight ahead in horror.\n\nIt felt as though hours had passed by the time she recovered her senses and managed to turn around and blindly run towards safety, wherever safety might now be in this destroyed city, if safety even still existed. She had no idea if she were running east, west, north, or south, only that her flight instinct was carrying her as far away as possible from this very real threat to her life.\n\nSeveral feet away from the open doors of a pizzeria, Mancika tripped over a charred bicycle frame and landed on both knees, which immediately began smarting.\n\nThe ten lines end here. A few more follow to finish the scene.\n\nShe tried several times to pull herself back up, but her body refused to obey her mind. A thirtysomething man in a Yankees T-shirt grabbed her under the shoulders and dragged her the remaining distance to the sanctuary. Four other people squeezed inside, and then the pizzaiolo shut the doors seconds before the dark grey cloud of doom swept past.\n\nMancika slumped against the back of a bar stool and fought off her increasingly persistent urge to vomit. The strong, strange smell clung to every molecule of the air, herself, and the other people, refusing to relinquish its ominous, hateful hold over the city she now desperately wanted to get away from. For all she knew, more planes were on their way and about to crash into the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, and all the other famous high-rise buildings dotting Lower and Midtown Manhattan.\n\nIn the blink of an eye, the fun, exciting, vibrant city of dreams she’d been so thrilled to move to five years ago had transmogrified into a dangerous post-apocalyptic hellscape and a flaming inferno of nightmares.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nContent warning: This post contains extremely intense descriptions of the 9/11 terrorist attack.\n\nWelcome back to Weekend Writing Warriors and Snippet Sunday, weekly Sunday hops where writers share 8–10 sentences from a book or WIP.

We now get back to 18-year-old Raizel Brandt-van Acker, Sparky’s great-niece, who’s being carried down from the 91st floor by two young firemen, Leon and Jeremy. During their descent, her rescuers belatedly realized they forgot to put their heavy coats and equipment back on after lifting the desk Raizel was trapped under, and that that’s why they’re descending much faster than they ascended.\n\nIncreasing amounts of smoke choked the stairwell, and more debris and dust were piled up, the lower Raizel and her rescuers descended. There were also countless pairs of shoes abandoned on the remaining flights, many high heels, presumably so their owners could walk faster. Some people walked over or around the shoes, while others kicked them down or to the side. By this point, the throbbing ache in Raizel’s legs and ribs had become almost a familiar sensation instead of a shocking pain. Either that, or she was so distracted by the urgent mission of escape and pumped so full of adrenaline she no longer registered its true impact.\n\nWhen they finally reached the blessèd lobby, a Port Authority police officer directed them down into the mall and told them to take the stairs back up to the exit through 4 or 5 World Trade Center. An overpowering tsunami of nausea swept through Raizel when she saw human arms, legs, hands, and feet littered through the lobby alongside all the debris blocking their way.\n\nA loud rumbling erupted above them as they went through the darkened mall filled with tidal waves of smoke and water cascading down from broken sprinklers, pooled to a depth of several inches. The rumbling turned into a progressively louder, more menacing roaring as Leon and Jeremy ran up the final flight of stairs to the precious plaza outside, and big specks of debris landed on Raizel’s eyes, obscuring her sight.\n\n“I’ll take her from here; you just run for your lives!” a male voice shouted.\n\nThe ten lines end here. A few more follow to finish the scene.\n\nRaizel felt herself being transferred to the stranger’s arms, her purse still securely over her shoulder. As this new angel ran with her, the roaring became deafening, and her ears began ringing all over again. Raizel started coughing from the thick, acrid, she knew not what filling the air. It went up into her nostrils and left her almost unable to breathe. Then a heavy object hit her head, and she felt blood gushing out and matting her hair together. In the next moment, she blacked out.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
