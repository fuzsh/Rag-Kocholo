        "text": "To keep functioning as a human in a complicated world, sometimes you need to just let loose and have a good cry. Studies have found that crying can relieve stress, help us cope with scary situations, and release endorphins. And what better way to cue the waterworks than to put on a sad movie, dim the lights, and feel all the feelings? That's why we at Marie Claire have compiled a list of the saddest movies we turn to when we feel like taking a moment.\n\nThe sad films below are listed by category so you can narrow down the search for what type of cry you’re looking to have. For example, a cry about a war movie (think Grave of the Fireflies or Sophie’s Choice) can lead to one kind of emotional state—contemplative, meditating on the inherent brutality of humanity—while a sad romance movie (The Notebook, One Day) will lead to a very different set of feelings—wistfulness, swooning appreciation for the things that make life meaningful. And then, of course, there are the all-time best sad movies, which you’ll find toward the bottom of the page. We’re talking Marley and Me, Manchester By the Sea, the first five minutes of Pixar’s Up—the kind of scenes guaranteed to lead to some heaving, ugly sobs. Hyperspecificity is what we were going for with this list of sad movies: A taxonomy of the particular kinds of sad, courtesy of your really emotionally healthy friends at Marie Claire.\n\nSo check out our list of the best sad films streaming now, get the tissues ready, and call us if you need anything. (Oh, and if you're looking for the best sad movies on Netflix specifically, we've got a list for that too.) Happy sniffling!\n\nSpoiler alert: In order to talk about what's sad in these movies, sharing some crucial details are essential. You've been warned.\n\nSad Romance Movies\n\nThe Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964)\n\nReason You'll Cry: It's about two people who love each other but can't be together. Need I say more?\n\nWeepiness Level: Crying while singing in French, if you can imagine such a thing.\n\nwatch now\n\nHer (2013)\n\nReason You'll Cry: This movie is a unique meditation on loneliness in the age of artificial intelligence, and it will have you questioning the ways you use technology to cope.\n\nWeepiness Level: Shoulder shaking quietly, staring at your smartphone suspiciously but also with a weird longing.\n\nwatch now\n\nMoulin Rouge (2001)\n\nReason You'll Cry: A fun, gorgeous, sexy, musical romp about love that ultimately ends in tuberculosis. So unfair.\n\nWeepiness Level: Lip-quivering with perhaps a contemplative tear.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe Way We Were (1973)\n\nReason You'll Cry: Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford have undeniable chemistry in this story of two mismatched lovers who, in the end, just can't make it work. It's sad because it'll remind you of your own lost loves. Also, it's got a killer soundtrack.\n\nWeepiness Level: Sobs that won't stop because, honestly, they're not really about the movie, are they?\n\nwatch now\n\nEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)\n\nReason You'll Cry: Michel Gondry makes movies that are thoughtfully quirky and then punch you right in the gut. This one stars Jim Carey as a man reeling from a crappy breakup who decides to use new technology to have all memories of his ex, Kate Winslet, wiped from his memory. But as the strange, surreal erasure process starts to take him through every memory he has with her, he realizes that maybe relationships are filled with good and bad—and that's sort of the point of everything.\n\nWeepiness Level: More like Eternal Sadness of the Sobbing Mind.\n\nwatch now\n\nMarriage Story (2019)\n\nReason You'll Cry: We've all experienced the crushing loss of a relationship falling apart and Marriage Story reflects that pain right back to us.\n\nWeepiness Level: Pretending it's allergies to everyone watching with you even though it is clearly not just allergies.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe Notebook (2004)\n\nReason You'll Cry: Look, this movie is schmaltzy as hell. But it's also deeply romantic and tragic in the way that all love stories are tragic because they can't possibly last forever and...I'm sorry, I just need a minute.\n\nWeepiness Level: Crying in spite of yourself.\n\nwatch now\n\nTitanic (1997)\n\nReason You'll Cry: Ummm, how about because an entire ship full of people meet their watery doom? But mostly due to the scene in which two old people lay in bed and wait for the Grim Reaper to take them. Also Jack. Poor, sweet Jack. There was almost certainly room for him on that door.\n\nWeepiness Level: Several fully-formed tears.\n\nwatch now\n\nY Tu Mama Tambien (2001)\n\nReason You'll Cry: This movie is achingly poetic, and it touches not only on literal death, but also on the death of youth, friendship, and innocence.\n\nWeepiness Level: Wine-drunk tears while you stalk your long-lost childhood best friend on Instagram.\n\nwatch now\n\nMe Before You (2015)\n\nReason You'll Cry: Because not all love stories have a happy ending, but it's even sadder when that sad ending is part of a choice and not fate stepping in.\n\nWeepiness Level: Ugly crying into a bottle of wine and drunk texting \"I love you\" to everyone you care about.\n\nwatch now\n\nRevolutionary Road (2008)\n\nReason You'll Cry: Because of the death of these people's hopes and dreams...and also because of literal death.\n\nWeepiness Level: Tearfully reminding your confused and concerned significant other that you love and appreciate them.\n\nwatch now\n\nA Star is Born (2018)\n\nReason You'll Cry: Two musicians come together to create arguably one of the best songs of all time *cough* \"Shallow\" *cough* and fall in love. If this was a perfect world, the film would end there, but because it's a movie, Bradley Cooper's character is a pill-popping alcoholic who desperately needs to be saved.\n\nWeepiness Level: When you think you're done crying, it'll make you cry again.\n\nwatch now\n\nSad War Movies\n\nJojo Rabbit (2019)\n\nReason You'll Cry: Basically the entire second half of the movie, as Jojo's life crumbles around him once he realizes the truth of his life in Nazi Germany.\n\nWeepiness Level: A short mix of crying-laughing-wincing, before it gives way to full out sobs.\n\nwatch now\n\nAtonement (2007)\n\nReason You'll Cry: A beautiful, lush movie about a terrible mistake made by a young girl that ruins not only her life but the lives of two innocent, very attractive people? Ugh, fine, pass the tissues.\n\nWeepiness Level: Horrified tears.\n\nwatch now\n\nHair (1979)\n\nReason You'll Cry: Director Milos Forman changed the ending of this classic musical to make it doubly as upsetting. Much of the movie is a celebration of life, rebellion, and hippie culture, so the comedown at the end will have you positively wrecked.\n\nWeepiness Level: Sobbing as you pine for world peace and stick flowers in your long, untamed hair.\n\nwatch now\n\nFoxtrot\n\nReason You'll Cry: This critical, thought-provoking look at Israel's military by Israeli filmmaker Samuel Maoz starts with a family's reaction to their son's death―but takes several unexpected turns that somehow makes the film even more gut-wrenching than expected.\n\nWeepiness Level: Sobs interrupted by intermittent cries of, \"War is pointless!\"\n\nwatch now\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front (2022)\n\nReason You'll Cry: This adaptation of the classic German novel presents the horrors of World War I in living color, juxtaposing the horrors in the trenches with a diplomat's attempt to negotiate a ceasefire.\n\nWeepiness Level: See Foxtrot.\n\nGrave of the Fireflies (2011)\n\nReason You'll Cry: This depiction of World War II from the perspective of two young Japanese children absolutely gutted me. For some reason, this film was released on a double-bill with the delightful childhood classic My Neighbor Totoro, resulting in scores of traumatized movie-goers who'd been expecting a lighthearted trip to the movies.\n\nWeepiness Level: Crying as you request an appointment with your therapist ASAP.\n\nwatch now\n\nSchindler's List (1993)\n\nReason You'll Cry: This is probably the first film you thought of when you read \"sad war movies,\" as the real-life story of Oskar Schindler has already elicited tears from generations of World History students.\n\nWeepiness Level: Just give us all the tissues.\n\nwatch now\n\nSad Beautiful Movies\n\nThe Farewell (2019)\n\nReason You'll Cry: Because you'll be reminded of a simple fact that we all know, but usually try to ignore actively thinking about: Everyone we love will eventually die and all we can do is make the most of the time we have with them.\n\nWeepiness Level: Several tissues and a call home to your family.\n\nwatch now\n\nForrest Gump (1994)\n\nReason You'll Cry: Do you know anyone who can keep from crying during this movie?? I sure don't. Even the characters within the film are moved to tears by Forrest and Jenny's stories.\n\nWeepiness Level: Crying to '60s and '70s rock classics―an odd vibe.\n\nwatch now\n\nLoving Vincent (2019)\n\nReason You'll Cry: Van Gogh was terribly misunderstood and treated cruelly during his lifetime. And the fact that this movie was made using different Van Gogh-style paintings for every single frame makes it infinitely more poignant.\n\nWeepiness Level: Letting the credits run completely because you're too busy sobbing to stop them.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe Danish Girl (2015)\n\nReason You'll Cry: The injustice of transphobia + the endurance of unconditional love + the fact that this is a true story. I see no reason not to cry\n\nWeepiness Level: Hugging your pillow to your chest, murmuring, \"It's just not fair\" over and over again.\n\nwatch now\n\nSteel Magnolias (1989)\n\nReason You'll Cry: It's a movie about a group of sister-friends, one of whom dies tragically while fulfilling her dream of having a family (even knowing the potential consequences). If you have a pulse, you will cry. Also, Dolly Parton is in it which is not a reason to cry but it is good to know.\n\nWeepiness Level: Snotty nose-blowing.\n\nwatch now\n\nLittle Women (2019)\n\nReason You'll Cry: All we want is for Jo March to find love and live the life she deserves. There's another big reason you'll cry, but we won't spoil it for you.\n\nWeepiness Level: A couple packs of tissues are necessary.\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nMy Girl (1994)\n\nReason You'll Cry: Even if you're not a chid of the '90s, Macauley Culkin as an adorably sweet dweeb with a fatal bee allergy will ruin you.\n\nWeepiness Level: A few minutes of bawling.\n\nwatch now\n\nHappy as Lazzaro (2018)\n\nReason You'll Cry: You'll fall in love with the innocent yet doomed Lazzaro in Alice Rohrwacher's ethereal, fable-like film. And at the end, you'll be crying not only for him, but also out of frustration that the world is the way it is.\n\nWeepiness Level: *sobs in Italian*\n\nwatch now\n\nInside Out (2015)\n\nReason You'll Cry: In this movie, we have: Robin Williams as the teacher figure you always wanted, a group of young men trying to find there way in this scary unknown world, overbearing parents who just won't quit meddling, and the life-altering power of literature.\n\nWeepiness Level: The kind where you have to hold in your sobs to not draw attention.\n\nwatch now\n\nSad Emotional Movies\n\nOne Day (2011)\n\nReason You'll Cry: Described by several people on the MarieClaire.com staff as \"one of the most manipulative movies of all time\" (in a good-cry way), this story follows Anne Hathaway (with an accent) and Jim Sturgess as two people who meet in college and meet up again on the same day each year for two decades. There is more death than there probably needs to be for something that's such a slow burn. Even telling you the plot might make you tear up.\n\nWeepiness Level: Tears over how unfair life (and this movie) can sometimes be.\n\nwatch now\n\nPieces of a Woman (2020)\n\nReason You'll Cry: A devastating home birth the main character experiences will hit home for a lot of women.\n\nWeepiness Level: Quite a bit of \"ugly crying.\"\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nMary and Max (2009)\n\nReason You'll Cry: This movie captures the essence of intense loneliness, isolation, suicidal depression, and the sheer power of a single, unexpected human connection in a way that no movie with live-action actors ever has.\n\nWeepiness Level: More crying than you ever expected to do for claymation characters, that's for sure.\n\nwatch now\n\nMe and Earl and the Dying Girl (2015)\n\nReason You'll Cry: It's in the title. A girl dies, and even though you know it's coming, the climactic tragedy still rips you apart.\n\nWeepiness Level: The first time I saw this film, I was in a room full of people, and when the lights came back on at the end, every single person quietly had tears on their face.\n\nwatch now\n\nFive Feet Apart (2019)\n\nReason You'll Cry: More than 30,000 Americans live with cystic fibrosis, and we get a glimpse of how the disease takes a toll on young people.\n\nWeepiness Level: At least one box of tissues and a call to your mom after the movie ends.\n\nwatch now\n\nToy Story 3 (2010)\n\nReason You'll Cry: When Andy's toys come face to face with their own, horrifying demise and then just accept that they're going to burn to death in an incinerator, you'll feel the burning pain of your own childhood dying a little. Don't worry, they make it out (is that even a spoiler, since there's a Toy Story 4?). But still.\n\nWeepiness Level: The always-jarring feeling of being forced to acknowledge your own mortality, paired with a setting that makes you consider that through the lens of childhood. BRB, dying inside a little (/a lot).\n\nwatch now\n\nDead Poets Society (1989)\n\nReason You'll Cry: In this movie, we have: Robin Williams as the teacher figure you always wanted, a group of young men trying to find there way in this scary unknown world, overbearing parents who just won't quit meddling, and the life-altering power of literature.\n\nWeepiness Level: The kind where you have to hold in your sobs to not draw attention.\n\nwatch now\n\nAI: Artificial Intelligence (2001)\n\nReason You'll Cry: If you can watch the scene where Haley Joel Osment, playing a robot who believes he's a real boy, begs his human mother not to abandon him as she drives away and leaves him to mourn her love for all eternity, then you might be the robot.\n\nWeepiness Level: Moderate weeping, as this list goes. Luckily, there are less sob-fest parts of the movie, too.\n\nwatch now\n\nChristine (2016)\n\nReason You'll Cry: In Christine, we watch the title character (played by Rebecca Hall) slowly succumb to loneliness until she kills herself on live television. And it's based on a true story.\n\nWeepiness Level: Stunned silence followed by a sudden, drawn-out sob.\n\nwatch now\n\nNever Let Me Go (2010)\n\nReason You'll Cry: Swelling orchestral soundtrack? Check. Romantic, forbidden love triangle? Check. Doomed loves? Check. Postmodern fable about clones based on a (genius) book by Kishuo Ishiguro? Um, also check.\n\nWeepiness Level: A good, transfixed cry.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe Lovely Bones (2009)\n\nReason You'll Cry: Grappling with the murder of a young girl and the lack of answers her family receives about her death throughout the movie, plus experiencing the life she had ahead of her.\n\nWeepiness Level: You'll be calling your parents at least three times after finishing the movie.\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nFruitvale Station (2013)\n\nReason You'll Cry: One of the most realistic and gut-wrenching depictions of an unlawful police shooting ever put to film.\n\nWeepiness Level: Dismayed sobs and a call to your father/brother/son/etc.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe Saddest Movies of All Time\n\nMarley and Me (2008)\n\nReason You'll Cry: It tracks the life of possibly one of the cutest and most energetic dogs on the planet. It's promoted as a comedy, which, trust us, does have its moments, but like we said, \"tracks the life,\" so uh, that also includes the end.\n\nWeepiness Level: Clutching your furry friend's coat while crying.\n\nwatch now\n\nMouchette (1967)\n\nReason You'll Cry: Robert Bresson is known for depicting characters in impossible, dire circumstances, and the sight of this orphaned little girl crying right into the camera, will absolutely set you off.\n\nWeepiness Level: Pausing the movie because you can't hear it over your crying.\n\nwatch now\n\nManchester by the Sea (2016)\n\nReason You'll Cry: Kids dying and lifelong guilt and lost love in cold, coastal New England.\n\nWeepiness Level: The type that's accompanied by physical pain in your chest.\n\nwatch now\n\nSeven Pounds (2008)\n\nReason You'll Cry: We'll try to be as un-spoilery as possible here, but let's just say that when the truth about the main character's random acts of kindness is revealed, crying is guaranteed.\n\nWeepiness Level: Stunned silence and then a steady stream of quiet, body-shaking sobs.\n\nwatch now\n\nIf Beale Street Could Talk (2018)\n\nReason You'll Cry: Childhood friends turned love-struck couple struggle to move forward with their life together when one of them is arrested and put in jail for a crime they didn't commit.

The gist is: Woman meets man, woman marries man, woman lives a perfect life with man, woman dies, man has to keep on going somehow. Even typing that made me well up.\n\nWeepiness Level: A truly traumatizing cry for two minutes, and then the shadow of that cry for the rest of the movie."
