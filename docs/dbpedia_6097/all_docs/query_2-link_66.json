        "text": "Probably one of the best interviews from Hasbro in ages. So much new information, even if some of it is saddled with the typical \"maybes\" and \"possiblys\".\n\nLegacy's multiversal aspect \"not necessarily\" continuing: I think this will result in something of a split between the two Generations toylines: Studio Series will pivot to focus on \"content-accuracy\" as Warden described it while \"Legacy\" (or whatever the non-SS line is called) will focus more on \"general\" characters and designs like G1/BW/UT/RID01 since they all share a similar style in toy and animation. I think the media that is \"show/comic/film/game-first, toyline second\" like Prime and Animated will receive heavier focus in Studio Series than in main Legacy.\n\nFinishing sets a priority: Thank the gods. One thing I hated about Warden's design lead tenure was the overwhelming nature of G1 product meant that teams and subgroups would be incomplete, even when it made no sense not to include them (A line with triple-changing Headmasters and no Apeface or Snapdragon is still baffling to me).\n\n2025 and 2026 are \"linked together\": I think this implies that the Thirteen won't be completed in one line, maybe doing five in one line and six in the next one, with the other Scramble City combiner following suit (Superion and co. for \"Age of the Primes\", Bruticus and the rest for \"Fall of the Primes\" or whatever they call it).\n\nNew Generations storyline: I'm not really interested in that, to be honest. I think the non-Generations aspect of the franchise (Earthspark, One, Skybound, etc.) has this covered. I would prefer Generations to just simply be the \"nostalgia\" line without a backing media component. If they have to though, take a page out of DC's book and do animated films set in previous continuities (and PLEASE get original voice actors back where applicable!).\n\nCore Class lives: Another sigh of relief, though a part of me still thinks the \"price point\" will be quietly phased out. I can see pack-in figures becoming more and more abundant as we get into more Mini-Con/Recordicon territory.\n\n\"Don't think we'll ever run out of Titans\": I'm very curious what they'll do. Animated Omega's definitely confirmed with how prominent he's being mentioned not just in this interview but in online discussion. If he's not 2025's Titan, he's almost certainly 2026's.\n\nNon-Frame Devastator and future Combiners: Good to hear. Menasor really is the sole combiner from the cartoon that explicitly used a frame-like configuration. Superion kiiinda has it too, but it's way easier to finagle a non-frame heavy look out of him than Menasor. The talk of Scramble City integration also has me happy too, though I personally don't expect anything beyond arm-for-arm and leg-for-leg because going further starts to futz with engineering in a way that compromises individual robots, which is the exact opposite of what I want.\n\nRID Megatron: Yes, please!! I love that design and having a nicely sized figure of it would be grand! Of course, that'd mean I'd also have to try and track down a HasLab Omega Prime for a reasonable price...\n\nArmada Jetfire/Overlord/Transtech/Animated Omega/etc. other name-dropped things: Sounds like all of these are happening. I don't think they'd be name-dropped if they weren't on the docket. Transtech, maybe not but I definitely think Animated Omega is happening, as I already said. Armada Jetfire is most likely 2026.\n\nShifting Studio Series to be a general \"content-accurate\" line: Hoooo, yes! That's a winning strategy like I mentioned at the start. Having a line specifically for capturing on-screen/page accuracy without worrying about overarching gimmicks or styles will please a lot more in the community. I think this is the team acknowledging the criticisms of the Legacy Prime/Animated characters' designs.\n\nNo new G1 Metroplex on the horizon: Even though the T30 one sticks out amongst the other Titans, that's fine. Like Warden said, there are other characters \"in line\" to be done at Titan-scale first and I'd much rather they get their time than have another go at Metroplex who isn't in dire need of an update just yet.\n\nMore G1 toy-accurate figures: Eh, I'm not really interested in this. As much as Warden says they're not influenced or inspired by the Missing Link stuff, I think I'd prefer if they didn't retread a lot of what that line is trying to do. If this is more of a way to do G1 characters that were toy-only (like the latter-day stuff), that's more than okay with me. But if Takara does an ML Sunstreaker and then we see a Legacy one, that'd just feel like a waste of time IMO.\n\nMore Studio Series Concept Stuff on the way: Nice, a lot of cool concepts and characters in there. I know he's probably referring to Widow Maker with this hint, but piggybacking off of that, I can totally see her being a pretool of a Movie 07 Arcee, since Widow Maker doesn't have an alternate mode that I know of and Arcee's design could use some solidity that WM provides.\n\nIDW in Studio Series: GODS, YES! I'm excited at this potentially happening down the line. Nautica and the DJD need to be in those first few waves of \"Comic Edition\" product. Nautica is long overdue a proper and good figure of her own and Tarn is lonely without his crew! Also, the tease of Fort Max is great as well; it'd be great to have a \"downscaled\" version of the character for a more manageable collection. Not sure what the 2028 reference for the Lost Light Transformer thing means, but maybe it was an accidental slip that 2028 will be the year of IDW stuff.\n\nMore accessory packs: Another big win, though this is something the design team has been saying is possible for a while now and not much has come up besides pack-ins with figures, which I personally don't count. I think this might be lost in the shuffle with other ideas and concepts and probably won't end up happening.\n\nMulti-pack Mini-Cons: This might be what ends up replacing Core, at least that's what most of the design team seems to be implying whenever the topic is brought up. It makes sense not to pack them in with the figures from an engineering standpoint as you'd have to free up space on the mold for the Mini-Con which would either increase the base price of a figure or severely hamper the figure's design for budget reasons. Individually molded Mini-Cons sold as a set though are a great way to get them out there. I can see one pack being Jolt, Sparkplug and Longarm to fill out the two Armada guys already out and for the one coming in Age of the Primes.\n\nNext Haslab: I honestly don't know what it is, but I hope it's not something I regret missing out on like Omega Prime. A Primus wouldn't really entice me for space and cost reasons, but a Liokaiser would be nice, which is about the only thing I can really think of that'd excite me.\n\nThe \"AI garbage\" is literally standard algorithmic operations that most shopping websites have used for years now. It has nothing to do with ChatGPT or any kind of modern, buzzword \"AI\" ideas.\n\nMany of the Animated figures from back in the day looked the part, but were hampered by some engineering qualms (limited articulation and compromising for gimmicks and electronics for example). Newer figures could take that accuracy angle but apply modern engineering to them, basically just focus on screen accuracy and articulation over gimmicks.\n\nI'm guessing the comic stuff won't be happening until late-2026/2027 at the earliest, then. There's no way they'll skip out on the 86 movie's 40th.\n\nAssuming Comics will be the substitute of 86, there are still characters that could potentially happen in 86 (at least the most noteworthy characters).\n\nKranix and Arblus are all but confirmed; then we have Cyclonus, Rodimus Prime, more Junkions, the Quintesson Judge & Prosecutor, the Alicon and Bailiff, a living Prowl; Corpse Edition Wheeljack, Windcharger, Thundercracker, Skywarp, and Insecticons. They've recently talked about Soundwave and Shockwave."
