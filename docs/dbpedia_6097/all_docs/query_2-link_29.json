        "text": "by Marissa Pomerance\n\nAs we all fumble through adulthood, spending countless hours in therapy unpacking our childhoods and learning to set boundaries, one of the hardest parts of growth is looking inwards to notice how we treat others, learning how to take responsibility for our own behavior when it can be harmful, and pledging to be better, kinder, more empathetic people.\n\nBut there comes a point when being “nice” is no longer serving us. When it’s no longer serving others, either. That’s when it veers into people pleasing. People pleasing isn’t JUST caring about what other people think of us, or going out of our way to help others; we’re humans, we ALL care about what other people think of us.\n\nInstead, people pleasing is putting others’ happiness above ours to such an extreme degree, that we forsake our own needs, desires, and boundaries. “People pleasing occurs when you act, feel, or think a certain way that is not ACTUALLY coming from your true self, but is just to please other people. People pleasing is an act of betrayal against your authentic self,” says Amy Tran, a Ph.D candidate in clinical psychology.\n\nIt’s telling your partner, “no it’s fine, you pick the movie tonight, I don’t care,” when you secretly resent them for always picking the most dramatic, hard-to-watch movie and you just want to watch a lighthearted romcom but don’t want to seem “picky” or “difficult.” Or doing all of the cooking and cleaning in the house despite having no extra time or energy and being afraid to ask for help because you’re afraid of being abandoned if you’re not perfect, and your spouse always tells you how “helpful” and “selfless” you are.\n\nBut people pleasing isn’t just harming our own mental health. It’s making our relationships worse--less authentic, and more resentful.\n\nHere’s why.\n\nPeople pleasing is about anxiety.\n\nThere’s a common perception that people pleasing is simply caring too much about other peoples’ feelings, or more importantly, caring too much about others’ perceptions of us.\n\nBut people pleasing runs deeper than that. According to Tran, common reasons for people pleasing include:\n\nYou fear rejection or abandonment.\n\nYou fear conflict or angry people.\n\nYou fear being unloved, disliked or criticized.\n\nYou fear that if you set limits, you will look mean, rude, or selfish.\n\nYou fear that others won't need you anymore.\n\nDo you see the common thread, here? “Fear.” “Fear and anxiety are emotions that are closely related,” says Tran. “People pleasing is often driven by anxiety. Anxiety is very future-oriented. You experience anxiety because you’re worried about something bad happening in the future. So essentially, you people please to avoid the possibility of a feared outcome actually occurring in the future.”\n\nIn a way, people pleasing helps us mitigate one type of anxiety about our social lives and interpersonal relationships. It helps us control those outcomes to avoid future conflict, or being disliked, or being abandoned.\n\nIt also stems from our attachment styles.\n\nOh look! Some other coping mechanism we used as children to survive that no longer serves us in adulthood and continues to impact our mental health!\n\nIf we continue to dig deeper, we may learn that the sources of our people pleasing come from our attachment styles, which are the ways we learned to trust and relate to other people from our primary caregivers. “Sometimes, people pleasing comes from growing up in an environment where you did not feel unconditionally loved and secure with your caregivers,” says Tran.\n\nAnd specifically, Tran believes people pleasing is most related to the anxious attachment style, which forms when our needs were not consistently met as children. For example, if when we cried, sometimes our caregivers soothed us, and other times they didn’t, we still learn to lean on and trust others, but we become fearful that we’re not worthy to always receive or deserve their love. “Anxious attachment styles are typically characterized as having a negative view of yourself and having a positive view of others. So you people please to feel loved and seem worthy. You may do this by seeking external validation, seeking reassurance, gaining approval, and conforming to the expectations of others. These types of behaviors are actually coping responses you learned as a young child to feel loved, seen, and heard.”\n\nIt’s not serving us. Or our relationships.\n\nPeople pleasers have traditionally been praised as the type of nice, selfless people we should all strive to be in a more generous, kind-hearted society.\n\nBut people pleasing isn’t nice. “Being nice is just a form of self-expression. It is truly coming from within you. You want to be nice without receiving anything in return. No approval, no money, no credit. Nothing. On the other hand, pleasing people is calculated (mostly subconsciously) and serves a function. The exact function that people pleasing serves differs for everyone, but it is usually to avoid a fear or to gain love and approval,” Tran explains.\n\nWhen we put aside our own needs, we’re actually damaging our relationships, even if we’re avoiding conflict in the moment, or briefly making someone else happy. Because the more we bury our needs, the worse our boundaries get, and the more we start begrudge our loved ones. To put it plainly, “when you say ‘yes’ when you really want to say ‘no,’ resentment towards other people can start to build,” says Tran.\n\nFor example, when our well-intentioned, people pleasing partner just agrees to what we want for dinner without expressing their own needs (maybe they didn't want salmon), afterwards, they may be irritable and resentful because they feel like they never get to eat what they want. And all along we would've been fine with having tacos instead of salmon, but we didn't know this because they were afraid of speaking up, asking for tacos, and creating “conflict.” So now they’re resenting us and we’re frustrated that they didn’t clearly express their needs.\n\nAnd if we’re not expressing our needs or our true selves to our closest loved ones, then our relationships can’t be fully honest or authentic."
