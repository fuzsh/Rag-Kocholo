        "text": "Georgia (NIA VARDALOS) is an American professor of classical history who came to teach at Athens University in Greece. But due to cutbacks she has been forced to take a job as a tour guide working for Maria (BERNICE STEGERS) who gives the best tourists to Georgia's competitive coworker, Nico (ALISTAIR McGOWAN), who knows how to appease the wants and needs of his group.\n\nThat's unlike Georgia who wants her tourists to love Greek history and the locales she takes them to as much as she does. That's a losing battle, pointed out to her by her group's \"class clown,\" Irv (RICHARD DREYFUSS), who also realizes that their bus driver, Poupi (ALEXIS GEORGOULIS), has a thing for her.\n\nAmong those traveling with them are American tourists, Kim (RACHEL DRATCH) and Big Al (HARLAND WILLIAMS) who are hoping to take advantage of her currently ovulating, while senior citizen couple Dorcas (SHEILA BERNETTE) and Barnaby (RALPH NOSSEK) are no longer focused on that, especially with Dorcas being a habitual thief.\n\nSpanish divorcees Lena (MARIA ADANEZ) and Lala (MARIA BOTTO) are there looking for a good time, just like college student Gator (JAREB DAUPLAISE). Pancake house executive Marc (BRIAN PALERMO) is always connected back to the office, while teenager Caitlin (SOPHIE STUCKEY) isn't pleased to be traveling with her quarreling parents (CAROLINE GOODALL & IAN OGILVY).\n\nWith Nico making her look bad in comparison with his group, Georgia is frustrated with hers and her life in general. But with help from Irv and ultimately the others, she finds hope for a change for the better, especially in regard to her budding relationship with Poupi.\n\nHere's a quick look at the content found in this romantic comedy that's been rated PG-13. Profanity consists of a slang term for sex, while other expletives and colorful phrases are also uttered. Sexually related dialogue and comedy material (including some that's briefly gay-related) are present, sexual encounters (including an apparent threesome) occur off-camera, varying amounts of cleavage and some scantly clad people are seen, as are various classic-style statutes that show male and female nudity.\n\nThere's some brief, comedy-based physical contact among people, as well as some behavior that might be enticing for kids to copy.\n\nDrinking occurs in various scenes, while there's brief tobacco content. There's a little bit of crude humor, while some comedy-based bad attitudes and tense family scenes are present.\n\nShould you still be concerned about the film's appropriateness for yourself or anyone else in your home, you may want to look more closely at our detailed listings for more specific information regarding the film's content."
