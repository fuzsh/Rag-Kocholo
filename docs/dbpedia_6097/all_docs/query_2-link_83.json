        "text": "After two long years of misery and pain with the Explorer System, in a lucky opportunity, I got an item capable of changing my System. Thus, I obtained the change to \"Multiversal Romantic Scripter System\".\n\nMy first action as a multiversal scripter? Obviously, erasing Issei and taking his place in the story of High School DxD to create my own harem.\n\n[First System Challenge Received!]\n\n[Challenge Objective: Take Rias Gremory's virginity!]\n\n__________\n\nContent Attention:\n\nThe pacing of the story and relationships is slower at the beginning because the system is not OP and nonsense. There are no skills like hypnosis or the like. The MC needs to develop a relationship with the girls before going to bed, but that doesn't mean he can't kiss them before anyone else.\n\n__________\n\nWhat you can expect:\n\nAction, well-developed relationships, an MC who has attitude, a system that evolves, an MC who gets really strong, R18 scenes, Slice of Life, novel content.\n\n__________\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/2pn9Twxrng\n\nP-atreon.com/palmer1998"
