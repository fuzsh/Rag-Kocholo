[Full review in Spanish]\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/5 | Mar 23, 2018\n\nWith its portrait of cranky, uninterested tourists, rowdy Aussies, fat Yanks, dingy hotels, shady merchants and busted buses, Ruins feels like somebody's personal vendetta against the travel industry.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: D+ | May 30, 2013\n\nAs a tour guide, Georgia rates as \"average,\" as a movie star Vardalos rates much the same.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/4 | May 30, 2013\n\nThe story is loaded with cliches and weak characters that are simply too annoying to handle.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 1.5/5 | Jun 27, 2011\n\nVardalos is fine, but Petrie and writer Mike Reiss yoke her to an ossified formula in which various national stereotypes (and the character actors who play them) embarrass themselves in bazaars and at Greek temples.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 1.5/4 | Jul 6, 2010\n\nNia Vardalos is as charming and watchable as ever but this is cliche ridden fluff.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/5 | Oct 4, 2009\n\nHollywood doesn't know what to do with difference, any more than it does with ruins. It's about time Vardalos, or someone, gave the suits a guided tour.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 1/5 | Oct 4, 2009\n\nAs the end of the road finally draws near, you'll need to pull over and throw up.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/5 | Oct 4, 2009\n\nThe film and all its characters are as tacky and charmless at the end as they are on first impressions.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 1/5 | Oct 4, 2009\n\nWhile Vardalos does her big fat best to keep it fresh, the duff characters and uninspired direction make Greece look as appealing as a week-old kebab.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 1/5 | Oct 4, 2009"
