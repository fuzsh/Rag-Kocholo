        "text": "Grab your portable mini fans and spray bottles, folks. This article is going to be hotter than the last time your air conditioning unit broke; hotter than when you open up the oven door to grab your pizza when it’s done; hotter than walking down the Las Vegas strip on a July afternoon.\n\nTrust me: you’re going to need an ice bath after this one, because I’m honoring the Top 10 Hottest Scenes in Cinema*.\n\nYou’re probably wondering: “Corinne, what’s with the asterisk?”\n\nWell, a couple of things, really.\n\nFirst, this list is subjective. The entries and their placement are my own opinions, but … c’mon. Once you read through it, you’re not going to be disagreeing with me. It’s entirely possible that there’s some steamy scenes in movies I’ve never seen… so if there’s anything I’ve neglected, feel free to bring it to my attention. Perhaps I’ll revisit the list, if I feel it’s warranted.\n\nBut, moreover, the asterisk really represents the qualifications for these entries — namely, that we’re playing by Bollywood rules, people. So there can be no kissing, no making out, no nothing! This is only G–rated stuff. Not to say a scene can’t be hot if the characters are kissing. There are plenty of examples I could give you from Casablanca to Notorious … but, sometimes the fact that they’re not kissing makes it even hotter, in my opinion.\n\nIt’s all that tension building up, and you’re rooting for these poor bastards to do something, literally anything, but they won’t because ~drama~ or something. Maybe they kiss later in the movie (and in most of these entries, they do). But, in these scenes, there’s something to be said for the chemistry between the actors, the dialogue, the pacing, the lighting, the mood — in short, everything — when the two love-struck dolts aren’t macking on each other. Again: tension-building.\n\nSo, without further ado, grab the nearest bottle of water and dump it on your head, because we’re diving right in with:\n\n10. Charles follows Julia through the ship in Brideshead Revisited (2008)\n\nThis one is low on the list, to be sure, but it’s still enough to make you put a damp cloth on your forehead. (And, believe me, it’s low on the list for a reason.)\n\nThis sequence is almost the first scene in the movie, and really draws the audience into the mysterious and not-yet-revealed connection between these two. In the scene, Charles (played by Matthew Goode) is stewing in the mixed feelings of his recent success as a painter, which in some respects feels hollow to him. He’s aimlessly smoking a cigarette when he spots an attractive woman (whom we later find out is Julia, played by Hayley Atwell). There’s some unspoken connection between them; they make eye contact across a large room. She leaves. He follows her through the various parts of the cruise ship that they’re on. It ends with them standing in the doorway of her room, greeting each other for the first time in several years. And then we get probably an hours-long flashback-within-a-flashback sequence and find out how these two lovebirds met.\n\nThe pacing, the framing, the music, the set design and costumes, and performances all line up for a very memorable and intriguing scene that piques the audience’s curiosity while also demonstrating the unresolved tension between these two. And all without more than a line or two of dialogue.\n\n9. “Let Me Teach You How to Dance” in Miss Potter\n\nThis is when we really start to get into the nitty-gritty of it all.\n\nMiss Potter is adapted from the real-life story of author Beatrix Potter (played by Renee Zellweger), who doesn’t have much of a social life or any prospects in the way of love. But, she starts to form a connection with her up-and-coming publisher, Norman Warne (played by Ewan McGregor). The two spend a lot of time with each other, but always under the eye of Beatrix’s watchful chaperone. At a Christmas party, Beatrix invites Mr. Warne to her room to give him his present (calm down — it’s just a painting), her chaperone passes out from drinking too much, and he opens a music box playing the song “Let Me Teach You How to Dance.” And they proceed to … dance.\n\nIt’s all very innocent, but the fact that the man she loves is so close to her in such a intimate space and situation… she’s definitely blushing. And when you watch the scene, you’re like Kathy Geiss in 30 Rock cheering: “Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!”\n\nAnd then of course, he tries to take the opportunity to propose to her, and she’s totally unprepared but also so emotional. And, just when you’re starting to fan yourself, her killjoy mom walks in and interrupts them. So close! Still, it’s such an emotionally charged scene, because you’re rooting for these two dumb-dumbs to say how they feel, and… well, I won’t ruin how Miss Potter ends, but, they really needed to say how they felt! Let’s just put it that way.\n\n8. The rainy porch scene in Mogambo\n\nEven though it’s raining in this scene, somehow it’s hotter than the Sahara.\n\nVictor (played by Clark Gable) is a big-game hunter in Africa, and has been hired by Mrs. Nordley (played by Grace Kelly) and her husband to take them on an expedition to find gorillas. Before the Nordleys arrive, we see Vick’s womanizing ways, but when Mrs. Nordley does appear on the scene, Vick falls for her — hard. (Who can blame him? It’s Grace Kelly, after all!) After rescuing her from a trap in the jungle, he’s escorting her back to the main house. A storm comes up, with the wind blowing like crazy. Mrs. Nordley has trouble walking, and Vick picks up her in his arms and carries her back. On the porch, not a single word is spoken between them, but again — unresolved tension. They’re starting to get feelings for each other, but neither wants to admit it. She walks to the door of her room, but stops. He follows her. She’s wearing a headscarf, and he snaps it off her head and puts it around her neck, still holding it in his hands. Her eyes get watery, and she goes into her room.\n\nAll the while, Ava Gardner’s character (who had been Vick’s flame earlier in the movie) has been standing on the porch the whole time, and this little exchange between the man she loves and his new flame visibly effects her. But, believe me, if she hadn’t had emotional stakes in this wordless exchange, she would’ve been stepping out into that rain as a way of cooling herself off, just like the rest of us.\n\n7. “The Point of No Return” in The Phantom of the Opera\n\nSay what you will about this as an adaptation of the hit stage musical, but this is scene in smokin’! It’s a good thing they didn’t add more torches to that stage, because this song couldn’t handle any more heat.\n\nIn case you’ve never seen it, this musical number is toward the end of the movie. Christine (played by Emmy Rossum), her fiance Raoul (played by Patrick Wilson) and the opera managers are trying to capture the Phantom (played by Gerard Butler) by putting on a production of the Phantom’s opera Don Juan, Triumphant. Christine takes the role of the leading lady and becomes the bait, hoping to lure the Phantom out into the open so the nearby police can capture him during the performance. The Phantom kills the lead actor and takes over the role of Don Juan just in time for this number, which is about Don Juan trying to seduce Christine’s character.\n\nIn the POTO stage musical, neither Christine nor the in-universe audience initially realizes it’s the Phantom, because the actor wears a very large cloak that hides his figure and his face. (We in the real world realize it’s the Phantom, because we recognize his voice.) Here, though, the logic doesn’t work the same way, as Christine knows it’s the Phantom the whole time and actually tips off Raoul and the managers to get ready. And somehow that makes it more engaging, and you can see where Christine seemingly starts to fall under the Phantom’s proverbial spell and Raoul is visibly distressed by how Christine seems to be giving into the charade.\n\nAnd while YouTube essayist Lindsay Ellis makes fun of the random tango dancers in the background, I appreciate it, because it helps give the scene more energy and movement. In the stage version, the Phantom and Christine move around a lot more. In the movie, they just walk toward each other, away from each other, and then up a flight of stairs, and then toward each other again. Not really all that dynamic. But, the tango dancers help with that, along with adding to the ambiance and the tension.\n\nAnd, while many POTO purists bemoan Butler being cast as the Phantom — and while I agree with them in some respects — his voice has a good timbre, and he has more sex appeal than someone like Michael Crawford (who originated the role on Broadway). The weird (and admittedly unhealthy) dynamic between Butler’s Phantom and Rossum’s Christine is built up to a climax at this point in the movie, and the chemistry between them absolutely works. In the stage musical, this number comes off as more creepy, in part thanks to the giant cloak that the Phantom wears as Don Juan that makes him look like a fat Ghost of Christmas Future. It’s hard to see that as sexy. However, here, director Joel Schumacher — love him or hate him (and I’m definitely more in the ‘hate him’ camp) — allows the Phantom and Christine to have a more honest and open musical number, which helps turns up the sexiness and tone down the creepiness.\n\n6. A song and shelter from the rain in Twelfth Night\n\nI think what we’ve learned so far is that, if you’re making a movie and you want a really hot scene, throw in some dancing or rain, because the latter makes the list again thanks to the 1996 film adaptation of Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night.\n\nAfter believing her brother to be dead and having been stranded in an enemy land — both of which are thanks to a shipwreck — Viola (played by Imogen Stubbs) decides to disguise herself as a man, and takes the name Cesario and becomes an assistant to Duke Orsino (played by Toby Stephens). Orsino, seeing that Cesario is a handsome youth, recruits him to ask Countess Olivia (played by Helena Bonham Carter) to marry Orsino. Cesario goes, and Olivia ends up falling for Cesario instead of Orsino. Around this point in the play, Orsino is trying to ask Cesario to return to Olivia’s mansion to plead Orsino’s case again, but Cesario — because she’s actually a woman and is in love with Orsino herself — doesn’t want to.\n\nIn this scene, Orsino and Cesario take refuge from a rainstorm in a barn, where they stumble across Olivia’s fool (played by Ben Kingsley), whom Orsino asks to play them a song. As the fool is singing, Orsino looks on at Cesario, who’s across the room and then walks over and puts his arm around Cesario’s shoulder. Cesario/Olivia looks a little uncomfortable at the idea of the man she loves putting his arm around her, but rolls with it. As he sings, the fool looks on, knowing exactly what’s going on between them. Orsino continues looking at Cesario, who is still unsure how to react and quickly keeps glancing over at him as well. Their faces move closer and closer to each other as the fool keeps singing; and, just as Cesario/Olivia and Orsino are about to kiss, the fool stops singing and awkwardly takes a swig of his drink in an “I didn’t see anything” sort of way.\n\nThe dialogue is from the original play, but the film takes creative liberties by changing the location, the dynamic between Cesario and Orsino, and the whole context of what’s happening. That’s the thing about adaptations! It really works here, because at the end of the play, when Cesario is revealed to be a woman, Orsino proposes to her. While their friendship had definitely been built up in the text, whether Orsino felt anything more for Cesario/Olivia beyond friend was never really addressed until after her identity is revealed. But, in this version, the film — and this scene in particular — shows us that Orsino had feelings for Cesario/Olivia beyond simple friendship, which he probably felt he had to repress for a multitude of reasons. And, of course, all that unresolved tension just works to make the scene blowtorch levels of hot!\n\nOf course, all of these above entries are about as cold as a visit to the pool and an ice cream cone on a Sunday afternoon compared to these Top 5 melt-your-face-like-the-Ark-of-the-Covenant levels of heat!\n\n5. The hand-touch scene in Star Wars: The Last Jedi\n\nOh, baby, you better believe that this scene made somebody swoon in the theater the first time they saw it. (Me. It was me. JK. I was close though.) And, again, we have an intimate conversation taking place as one of our poor lovestruck idiots is soaking wet and it’s pouring rain outside. Rian Johnson, girl, you know exactly what you’re doing!\n\nFor some of you reading this, you might be thinking: “What?! Rey and Kylo aren’t a ~thing~.” Kid, have I got several studio executives and actors’ comments, internet essays and fanposts for you to read. As I’ve said before, if you’re going to see The Rise of Skywalker, better be prepared for these fools to make out by the end!\n\nI would like to point out — and I’m not the first to do so — that in The Force Awakens, Rey keeps telling Finn to let go of her hand. Yet, here, we see her willingly reach out to Kylo and allow him to touch hers.\n\nAnd while basically the entirety of their scenes in The Last Jedi could be on this list — including the Praetorian guard fight and the ‘rule the galaxy with me’ proposal — I believe this scene is the culmination of Kylo/Ben and Rey’s relationship thus far, as it shows us the first instance they connected on a deeper level and saw the potential of their lives together. That’s why Rey is so willing to defend Kylo/Ben to Luke. That’s why Kylo is willing to kill Snoke — throwing away everything he’s ever known — to save Rey. Each of them so desperately wants the future they saw, but neither is willing to go over to the other’s side to get it. And, while their destinies seemed to have been intertwined since they met each other in TFA, here is where it goes from ‘intertwined’ to ‘inseparably bound together.’\n\nAnd that’s only one part of why this scene is hotter than forest fire.\n\n4. The dance scene in The Mask of Zorro\n\nC’mon. You had to know this was coming, right? It is the lead art for this article, after all.\n\nWith this scene, everything is so palpable. The passion! The romance! You can feel the chemistry building between these two characters, even though they kinda-sorta just met. It’s enough to make you run into the backyard, turn on the hose, and spray yourself down.\n\nEverything about this scene works — from the dance choreography and music to the costumes and performances. The pacing. The angles. There’s such energy to the scene that absolutely sucks you in, even though our couple doesn’t exchange a word until after the dance is over.\n\nAnd, damn, if dance scenes aren’t like the easiest way to get some sexual tension and physical intimacy — but not too much — into your scene. If Antonio Banderas’ Alejandro/Zorro had been wearing his mask in this scene, we all would’ve swooned the first time we watched it. Thankfully, the screenwriter had pity on us and made sure this all took place when he’s in his ‘I’m a boring rich guy and totally not a vigilante’ persona.\n\n3. The Laendler dance in The Sound of Music\n\nAllow me to take a large gulp of cold water before I talk about this scene.\n\nYes, this scene. You all know exactly the one I’m talking about.\n\nMaria is so innocently trying to teach the children how to do the dance, Captain Von Trapp steps in, and the two flawlessly go through the first minute or two of the dance… until… they’re so close together, basically in each other’s arms, and neither can take their eyes off the other. They stop. And, Maria’s all flustered, saying “I can’t remember the rest,” and visibly blushes, which others nearby point out to her. She makes an excuse: “I’m not used to dancing.”\n\nGirl, you are not used to dancing with a guy as handsome as Captain Von Trapp, that’s what it is. You were in the convent like a week ago, and now the hottest guy on the block is doing the whole Held Gaze thing with you. How do you not plop down on your knee right there and propose to the man? (Oh, I guess, because it’s the early 20th century, and traditional gender roles are still very much a thing. Damn it!) And how did everyone present not go blind from overexposure to pure awesomeness?!\n\nSo, if you need to, I’d recommend you grab an ice pack now, because these next two entries are somehow even hotter than this one. (“Is that even possible, Corinne?” you ask. Yes. Yes, it is.)\n\n2. The library scene in The Scarlet Pimpernel (1982)\n\nIn rewatching this scene — purely as research for writing this article, of course — my reaction was similar to the babbling great-grandma from Rapsittie Street Kids.\n\nThis scene is so hot that, I had to pause half-way through, call an Uber to take me to the airport, book a round-trip ticket to Norway, find a guide who could take me to the coldest frozen tundra in the far north of the country, and then camp out there for a few weeks — because, holy hell, this scene is HOT!!!\n\nWhere do I even begin? How about the fact that they’re both so deeply in love with the other, but because of ~drama~ they’ve come to believe that the other one doesn’t love them and/or is untrustworthy. Or maybe it’s also that it’s a culmination of a lot of the movie’s plots and subplots that have been building up to this point. Or maybe it’s because Marguerite (played by Jane Seymour) finally tells her husband that her family is in trouble and she needs help, even though she doesn’t realize it’s him? She won’t trust Percy (played by Anthony Andrews) as her husband, but she will trust him as the Scarlet Pimpernel. Or when Percy tells her that he’s only a phantom, and she’s all: “You’re so real. I can feel your warmth even now.” You two. are. married!!! It’s like the perfect blend of drama, melodrama and romance!\n\nIt’s absolutely hilarious that she’s in love with her husband, and also sort of in love with the Scarlet Pimpernel, and doesn’t realize they’re one and the same. I also think it would’ve been hilarious if someone had walked in on this super-dramatic moment. Marguerite thinks she’s finally meeting this mysterious hero but can’t turn around to see his face, and Percy’s all walking up behind her and whispering, and they’re having this very serious and emotionally charged conversation. And then some dolt walks in like, “Oh, it’s the Blakeneys! What on earth are you kids up to?”\n\nBut then again, if someone had, it would’ve ruined not only the story but this scene. It’s bad enough that the clock chimes midnight in this ‘the fairy tale is over, Cinderella’ sort of way, and the two have to skedaddle out of the room separately in the hopes that neither will be found out.\n\nEven so, the scene’s conclusion only adds to the tension, because while Percy has learned about Marguerite’s drama, Marguerite has yet to discover that Percy is the Scarlet Pimpernel, which is also a great scene, by the way. But, nothing beats this one.\n\nHoly hell. Excuse me while I find the nearest icy lake, cut a hole in it and jump in before I talk about the No. 1 Hottest Scenes in Cinema*:\n\n1. “Shall We Dance?” in The King & I\n\nsdjfi;aosdi nvjd,nfalsij\n\nNo, that’s not a typo. That’s me, having a bout of heat stroke while rewatching this scene. But, fortunately, I know how to combat it: thinking about all the historical inaccuracies and probably racist / colonialist undertones of this telling of Anna Leonowens and the King of Siam.\n\nStill, all those other entries feel so lukewarm compared to this, which is the cinematic equivalent of the surface of the sun in terms of hotness. And, as the comments on the official YouTube clip demonstrate, I’m not the only one who feels like I should’ve been covering my eyes during this scene, even though they’re both fully clothed.\n\nI don’t know if you’re familiar with the term ‘eye sex,’ but that’s basically what’s going on here. We’ve seen it in some of these other entries, but this scene takes the cake!\n\nI don’t want to dilute the absolute raw magnetism of these performers and the scene as a whole, but I do want to point out that — in addition to what happens in the musical number itself — perhaps one reason why it stands out in our minds is because this is the closest these two people were throughout the entire film. SPOILERS for The King & I, but these two don’t end up together. In fact, this scene is the last time they’re both happy and together. Shortly after this, ~drama~ occurs, and the movie ends with the king’s death. This is the one time they actually got to be a couple, and do ‘couple things’ like dance together. They spent most of their time bickering and arguing and trying to subtly one-up each other. There are a few moments of genuine chemistry and kindness, don’t get me wrong, and this is one of them.\n\nLooking back over this list, only four of these couples are ‘together’ and living happily ever after by the end of their respective movies. (I’m not counting Rey and Kylo/Ben, because even if I think they could end up together in TROS, they aren’t together at the end of TLJ.) There’s a variety of reasons, but it mostly boils down to ‘one of them dies’ or ‘one of them was already in a relationship with someone else.’ Here, it’s the former, and again, perhaps one reason this scene is so iconic — in addition to the music, costumes, choreography, and performances — is because we see what they could’ve been together if ~drama~ hadn’t happened. But, then again, they really could never have been together to begin with, because of how different their cultures and expectations were. And, isn’t the whole idea of couple who loves each other passionately but can never be together one of the hottest tropes there is?\n\nStill, at least we got one scene where they were not only happy and working in tandem, but one that must’ve scorched the film reel whenever they recorded it because this scene IS SO FUCKING HOT!!!!! GAHHAHAH!\n\n*dies from internal combustion*\n\nFADE TO BLACK.\n\nTHE END.\n\nOR: “Why Red & Liz Have a Better Shot Than Most”\n\n“What is the deal with you two, anyways? It’s what everybody wants to know. Some say it’s a daddy-daughter thing. Others swear it’s May/September. I prefer to believe it’s a little of both.”\n\n–Mathias Solomon about Raymond ‘Red’ Reddington and FBI Agent Episode Keen on The Blacklist Episode 3.05 “Arioch Cain”\n\nI’ll admit that when I first saw The Blacklist pilot in 2013, only a few days after it aired, I was confused by the weird dynamic between Red and Liz. Like many, I assumed that he was her father, and that this show was following on the heels of Taken in having a father-daughter crime/action thing going on. However, maybe four or five episodes into the show, I started to see that the father-daughter read of their dynamic was off. And, by the time that Red denied being Liz’s father in Episode 1.10, I was fully on board with the idea that — rather than being a father-daughter pairing — these two were going to be an endgame couple.\n\nAnd, whenever Episode 3.05 aired and we got this fun little fourth-wall- breaking quote from Solomon, asking what the deal was between Red and Liz, it was great to see one of the show’s bigger villains (at that point) acknowledging that Red and Liz can have a dynamic that is something between the two. There can be a kind of mentoring dynamic where he is her elder and is teaching her how to navigate the world, while one or both of them can be in love and want to pursue a relationship with the other person.\n\n(Author’s Note: While I rewrote the above intro, the rest of the article is something I posted on my social media about a year ago and re-posted here with the Nerds’ permission. At the end, it starts talking about the status of Red and Liz’s relationship post-Season 5. I realize that the events of Season 6 change some of the dynamics — with Liz telling Red that she loves him and then subsequently ‘dad-zoning’ him, and then Red and Katarina having a weird sensual moment at the end of the S6 finale, so I threw a little note at the bottom to address the developments in Season 6.)\n\nNow, I have to tell you all that May/September relationships is a trope that frequently pops up in my favorite media or among my favorite fictional couples. And, one day, while trying to plot out another Blacklist-related article, I thought of several other examples of “older men falling in love with younger women” in various books, movies, etc. that I enjoy. Sometimes the relationships work out; sometimes they don’t.\n\nToday, I’d like to use them as examples for why I think Red & Liz have a great chance of being endgame and becoming canon. I think it’d also be helpful for fans who decry that Red’s affection for Liz is paternal and ONLY paternal to see other examples of older men falling for younger women, including some who fall for young ladies in their care (adopted daughters, students, etc.) I could include Bill & The Bride from Kill Bill, but I’ve already done another post about the similarities between Red & Liz and them, so I won’t repeat myself here.\n\nNow, I’m not saying all of the below pairings are HEALTHY relationships, mind you; but this type of dynamic isn’t unprecedented, and the interweaving patterns among them paves a pretty clear path for Red & Liz to become canon. In other words, these examples give us criteria for successful May/September relationships in media.\n\nI’d like to briefly examine the plot details and character dynamics of 10 fictional pairings between older men and women who are AT LEAST 15 years younger than the men (oftentimes, they’re more like 20+ years younger) and where the man has proposed to or professed his love for the young lady in question.\n\nI realize that there are probably other examples of May/September romances that won’t be on this list, but I’m only writing about pairings and media that I’m familiar with. I’m also going through them in no particular order.\n\nAs you read about each pairing — again, remember that not all of them work out — look for patterns in WHY they do or don’t work out. What impediments or obstacles there are to overcome, whether physical, emotional, etc.\n\nSPOILERS FOR ALL THE FOLLOWING MEDIA LISTED\n\nMr. Boldwood, Bathsheba Everdeen from Far From the Madding Crowd\n\nBathsheba, after she inherits a small estate from her uncle, becomes Mr. Boldwood’s neighbor. He initially shows no interest in her; but after she sends him a valentine on a dare, he becomes obsessed and infatuated with her. He makes her an offer of marriage, and she says she’ll consider it. Later, she ends up marrying another man (who’s closer to her in age), and Boldwood becomes enraged at the match. When Bathsheba’s husband goes missing and is presumed dead, Boldwood again offers himself to Bathsheba, and she again says she’ll consider it. Her husband returns and Boldwood flies into a rage and kills him. After Boldwood goes to prison, Bathsheba marries Gabriel Oakes, who had been in love with her before she inherited her estate and moved above him socially.\n\nNow, I’m not entirely sure on the age gap, as I haven’t read the novel. But based on the two miniseries adaptations I’ve seen, I’d guess Bathsheba is around 20, and Boldwood is supposed to be 40+.\n\nIt’s clear that Bathsheba doesn’t dislike Mr. Boldwood, but as the story progresses, she becomes seemingly more and more uncomfortable around him. After her husband goes missing, she really only considers Boldwood’s offer because her estate is doing poorly financially, and marrying him would give her the wealth and resources to help save it.\n\nThe Phantom (a.k.a. Erik), Christine Daae from The Phantom of the Opera\n\nLet me say that there are several versions of the story, but I’m sticking to the story as seen in the original novel, the ALW musical and the Yeston/Koppit musical, as they’re all pretty similar.\n\nWhen Christine comes to the opera house as a young woman (maybe 15-16?), she hears “the Angel of Music” (really the Phantom), who offers to coach her in singing. Eventually, she becomes good enough to take over the leading soprano role in the opera house’s productions. The Phantom is pleased, and reveals himself to her for the first time. At the same time, her childhood sweetheart Raoul also reappears in her life, clearly in love with her. Eventually, there’s a showdown after the Phantom kidnaps Christine and threatens Raoul’s life if she doesn’t marry him. Christine agrees to marry the Phantom, but (after Christine kisses him) he regrets what he’s done and lets them go so they can be together.\n\nIt’s unclear how old Christine was when she first started taking lessons from the Phantom, but she’s probably 18-20 during the ‘present day’ events of the novel. She’s about the same age in both the stage musicals. In the Yeston/Koppit version, we get to see the Phantom coaching her, and I’d estimate that he only does so for a few months before Raoul reappears and the whole ‘love triangle’ thing goes down. It’s also unclear, given the Phantom’s horrid features, to tell exactly how old he is. But (in the novel) the Persian lists the Phantom’s entire CV, and it’s probably fair to estimate he’s about 35-40, if not older.\n\nIt should be noted that Christine doesn’t return the Phantom’s feelings exactly, but in every version, she has some measure of affection, respect and admiration for him. Obviously, she doesn’t love him in the same way that she loves Raoul, but she still has some measure of love for him as her teacher and as a talented musician in his own right. I should mention that in the ALW version, a few times Christine psychologically projects her father’s spirit onto the Angel of Music/The Phantom, and the Phantom (in that version), definitely uses that to his advantage as a way to lure her in and try to get closer to her (physically and emotionally).\n\nJudge Turpin, Johanna from Sweeney Todd\n\nJohanna is Judge Turpin’s ward, whom he took custody of after he sentenced her father to be transported to another country so he could sexually assault her mother. Johanna’s mother goes mad after he does so, and as no one else is around to raise Johanna, Turpin takes her in. As she matures and becomes a young woman, he’s seen to be incredibly possessive of Johanna. He spies on her and fantasizes about her; and when a young man “ganders” at Johanna’s window from the street, Turpin threatens him. He is clearly deranged and perverted. When Johanna tries to run away with the young man, Turpin sends her to the madhouse. Later, he meets his end by Johanna’s father (Sweeney Todd), and Johanna and the young man run off together.\n\nFrom what I can tell of the movie’s flashbacks, Johanna is very young when Turpin takes her in. Probably a year old; maybe younger. And, the bulk of the story takes place when Johanna is about 15. This is when Turpin proposes, or at least, intends to propose to Johanna. It’s not really stated how old Turpin is, but he’s at least the same age as Sweeney Todd (Johanna’s father), if not older.\n\nIt should also be noted that Johanna does not return his affections at all. She tries to respect him, as her guardian, but she’s definitely picked up on his creeper vibes, and doesn’t consider him ‘husband material’ at all.\n\nAlso, this is probably our darkest of the pairings; so apologies for that.\n\nMr. Rochester, Jane Eyre from Jane Eyre\n\nI’ve already compared Rochester/Jane to Red/Liz before, so I’ll try to go through this pretty fast.\n\nJane, fresh out of school, works at Rochester’s house as a governess for his ward. Eventually, Jane and Rochester fall in love and prepare to get married. At the wedding, it’s revealed that Rochester is already married and his wife (who lives in the attic of his house) is an insane woman who has been responsible for a lot of mishaps that have occurred since Jane arrived. With this revealed, Jane leaves Rochester — still in love with him. She wanders around, and eventually settles at a village where the local reverend asks her to marry him so that she might accompany him on his missionary trip. She declines because she doesn’t love him, and eventually goes back to Rochester (who’s wife has now died in an accident, which also left him blind and handicapped). Jane and Rochester eventually get married.\n\nIt’s been a while since I read the book, but Jane is specifically stated to be young enough to be Rochester’s biological child. She’s 18-20; he’s probably in his early 40s.\n\nYou’ll note that this is one of a few examples where the couple actually gets together.\n\nEdmond Dantes (a.k.a. The Count of Monte Cristo), Haydee from The Count of Monte Cristo\n\nAnother comparison that I touched on briefly before, so I won’t spend much time on this pairing.\n\nThe novel skips over a long period of time, from when Dantes escapes prison to when he has Albert (the son of his rival and his former fiancee) kidnapped in Venice. But, during that time, Dantes found Haydee, an orphan, and purchases her to be his slave. Haydee proves to be very crucial in his revenge plot against Ferdinand (his rival); and at the end, Haydee asks to go away with Dantes, that two of them might be ~together~.\n\nIt’s been a long time since I read the book, and the best adaptation I’ve ever seen was an anime version (Gankutsuou). But, from my recollection — and correct me if I’m wrong — Haydee was maybe 6 when Dantes found her. And she’s probably 14-16 at the end of the novel, when the bulk of the story takes place.\n\nDespite being his “slave,” Haydee is really more of Dantes’ ward. He doesn’t force her to do anything, and allows her more freedom than an actual slave would have. In “Gankutsuou,” at least, she seems to have some authority over the other servants in the household. She’s clearly very devoted to Dantes, as he was her savior — the man who gave her a home.\n\nAgain, one of the few examples where the couple ends up together.\n\nPetyr Baelish (a.k.a. Littlefinger), Sansa Stark from Game of Thrones TV Show / A Song of Ice & Fire Book Series\n\nOne of two couples from GOT I’ll be talking about. I realize the show is ahead of the books, so I’ll be drawing on elements from both.\n\nSansa first meets Littlefinger when she comes to King’s Landing with her father in book 1/season 1. Petyr clearly shows some kind of weird interest in her; but it’s not until later — after Sansa is married off to Tyrion — that Littlefinger kidnaps/rescues her and takes her “home” to the Vale (where her aunt lives). After Littlefinger marries then kills Sansa’s aunt, he becomes her defacto guardian. In the books, at this point, Sansa has been hiding out as his bastard daughter Alayne. In the show, Littlefinger goes on to arrange a marriage to Sansa and Ramsay Bolton (who’s a dick). And then after Littlefinger has helped Sansa defeat Ramsay and take back Winterfell (her true home), he declares his love for her. Sansa is unsurprised by this, and rejects his offer but doesn’t kick him out of Winterfell. About a season after this happens, Sansa has him executed for crimes he committed against her family.\n\nYou’ll note that it’s slightly different from book to show, but in the book, Littlefinger sees Sansa (per the author) both as a faux daughter and as a love interest. She is the daughter of Catelyn, the woman he loved as a young boy and whom he has never gotten over. Now, he sees Sansa as the daughter he might’ve had with Cat, while also seeing her as a young Cat.\n\nAnd, again, in the book, Littlefinger acts in a weird mix of paternal and romantic (such as calling her beautiful and kissing her).\n\nAs for the age difference, Littlefinger is a few years younger than Sansa’s mother. So, he’s probably… 30-35. Sansa, meanwhile, was like 11 when she first met him. And she’s 13 or 14 in the upcoming book, The Winds of Winter. In the show, though, she’s probably closer to 18 when Littlefinger ‘proposes’ at Winterfell at the end of Season 6.\n\nIn both the book and the show, Sansa has some measure of gratitude for Littlefinger at various points in the story. She’s grateful to him for his friendship in King’s Landing, as she feels that he’s one of the few people she can trust (in the show). And after he brings her to the Vale, she remarks how he essentially rescued her from the Lannisters in doing so. She clearly doesn’t return his feelings in either book or show; but given that she’s younger in the book and is trying to maintain her cover and stay on his good side, she doesn’t really rebuke him either. His feelings toward her definitely make her uncomfortable in both book and show.\n\nWhile his fate is uncertain right now in the books, given what’s happened to him on GOT, I’d say Littlefinger’s probably not an endgame match for Sansa.\n\nAnd speaking of GOT…\n\nJorah Mormont, Daenerys Targaryen from Game of Thrones TV Show / A Song of Ice & Fire Book Series\n\nDany first meets Jorah at her wedding to Khal Drogo. Jorah is sworn to her brother, but stays at her side as part of her (and her brother’s) entourage. He helps her get to know her new people, the Dothraki, and eventually turns on her brother to serve her. After Khal Drogo dies and Dany ‘births’ dragons, he swears to serve her for the rest of his life, and stays by her side through several subsequent books. All this time, though, Jorah has been spying on Dany and only stops midway through Book 2; she doesn’t find out until late Book 3 (IIRC). She decides to exile him for his betrayal. Again, the exact plot timeline differs from book to show. In the show, Jorah has reunited with Dany after his exile and she has forgiven him. He continues to serve her, and is clearly jealous and upset when she takes on new lovers. In the books, Jorah declares his love to Dany in early Book 3; and in the show, Jorah declares his love for her mid-S6.\n\nAgain, I’m not exactly sure how old Jorah is, but based on the ASOIAF’s internal calendar, he’s about 45 when he meets Dany in Book 1. She, meanwhile, is 13. When exactly Jorah falls in love with her isn’t clear, but I’d say mid-Book 1; in the show, Jorah says he’s loved her since he first saw her.\n\nIn both book and show, Dany has a clear regard for Jorah, although she doesn’t return his affections romantically, and she has other (younger) love interests. She appreciates his protection, his strength, his counsel, his devotion… all of which she says she relies on at some point. In S4, Dany calls him her “most trusted adviser, my most valued general, and my dearest friend.” There’s also a long-running joke among GOT fans that Jorah has been “friend-zoned” by Dany, as she knows by book/season 2 that he’s in love with her, even though he hasn’t said so at that point.\n\nLikewise, while Jorah’s fate is uncertain right now in the books, given what’s happened to him and Dany on GOT, I’d say they’re not going to end up together in the books.\n\nColonel Brandon, Marianne Dashwood from Sense & Sensibility\n\nMarianne, who’s 17, moves with her family to a new cottage; their neighbors introduce them to Colonel Brandon, who immediately falls for Marianne. The guy clearly has a type, as he compares Marianne to another woman he was previously in love with, saying they both have the same intensity of feeling and sweet temperament. When the neighbors inform Marianne that Brandon has fallen for her, she’s awkwarded-out at the idea, as he’s 35 and “too old” for her. She admits that he’s a worthier companion, conversion-wise, than anyone else in the neighborhood, but she seeks to avoid him after his desires are made known to her. Meanwhile, she falls for Willoughby, a younger man who comes into the neighborhood and befriends Marianne and her family. Marianne and Willoughby act close enough that people begin to wonder if they’re secretly engaged, but Willoughby leaves suddenly, leaving Marianne distraught. Anyway, long story short, Willoughby ditches Marianne for another woman with more money and Marianne finds out he’s not at all noble or good, as he’d ruined another woman before meeting her. During the time it was rumored Marianne and Willoughby were engaged, Brandon — upset at the match for multiple reasons — makes it clear that he only wants Marianne to be happy. But, with Willoughby out of the way and Marianne finally starting to get over him, he eventually proposes to her and she accepts.\n\nSo, another thing that’s always weirded me out about the age gap between Brandon and Marianne, is that Brandon has a female ward who’s only two years younger than Marianne. Granted, his ward doesn’t live with him, and he seems to regard her in a distant, paternal way, but I still think it’s weird that he falls for a 17-year-old when he’s the guardian of a 15-year-old. But, yeah, things were different back then.\n\nAnyway, unlike some of these other pairings, it’s made pretty clear to Marianne from the start that Colonel Brandon is a potential romantic match for her. She never sees him in a fatherly way or as a man in a position of authority over her. Even before she knew of his interest in her, she regarded him as a friendly neighbor. And, again, she doesn’t initially hate him or love him; she regards him in a platonic sense. Later, though, she realizes that she’s in love with him and they get married.\n\nElias Ainsworth, Chise Hatori from The Ancient Magus’ Bride\n\nThe only entry on here that’s from a manga/anime. Chise, 15, has special magical properties that make her life difficult. She wants to commit suicide, but someone convinces her to sell herself in a magical auction, where Elias buys her. Elias informs Chise he’s bought her to be his apprentice, and then at the very end of the first episode/chapter, he also announces that — in addition to being his apprentice — he also bought her to be his bride. The two go on a lot of adventures, including finding out about Elias’ dark past and Chise’s traumatic history, and the two eventually get “married.” Elias and Chise also agree that just as Elias teaches Chise about magic, she is to teach him about humans and emotions.\n\nNow I should mention that Elias isn’t technically human; he’s some kind of mix-breed of a magical creature… probably a wendigo. And we’re not exactly sure how old he is. Hundreds of years old, at least, as we see in his backstory. Chise, meanwhile, is 15.\n\nI should also note that their relationship doesn’t start out at all healthy, and they both have to do a lot of work to better themselves individually. Initially, Elias keeps important truths from Chise and also gets jealous of her friends and becomes possessive of her. Chise, meanwhile, becomes very loyal and attached to Elias quite quickly, saying that she’ll always stay with him. She sees him as someone who has provided a home and a sense of security and warmth, which she always desperately craved. He provides her with a sense of belonging — she belongs to him, she belongs by his side, at his home, etc.\n\nAlso note that Elias announces himself as Chise’s romantic interest at almost the same time he announces he’s her guardian/teacher. So, while she might’ve initially seen him only as an authority figure, it’s only a few days later that he announces his full intentions.\n\nMr. John Jarndyce, Esther Summerson from Bleak House\n\nEsther is an orphan who was raised by her aunt, secluded and away from the world. Her aunt dies when she’s 13/14, and she falls into the care of John Jarndyce. Now, she doesn’t actually meet him after her aunt dies; instead, he acts through a lawyer and she accepts his offer to be sent to school. When she’s around 18, Jarndyce sends for her so that she can be companion to another ward of his, Ada. Jarndyce brings Esther, Ada and another ward Rick to his house, and their lives progress somewhat pleasantly. As we find out later in the story, Jarndyce — after he found out about Esther’s existence — had dreamed of one day making her his bride when she was older. Eventually, Rick and Ada pair off, leaving Jarndyce to propose to Esther. She accepts, but they decide to keep the engagement a secret. Meanwhile, Esther has another, younger love interest (Allan Woodcourt), but he went away to sea, and Esther figured they would never meet again. However, after she and Jarndyce are engaged, Woodcourt returns and proposes to her. She refuses, saying she’s already engaged. Jarndyce figures out that Esther and Woodcourt love each other, and breaks off his engagement to Esther so the other two can be happy.\n\nAs far as I can tell, it’s never stated in the novel how old Jarndyce is. It’s safe to assume he’s probably 40+. Esther is about 18 when she comes to live with him at Bleak House, and I’d say at least a year or two passes over the course of the story. Again, remember that Esther might’ve been in Jarndyce’s care from age 14, but she never saw or met him until she was 18.\n\nSo, while Jarndyce clearly has intentions toward Esther from the beginning, Esther always regards him as a very kindly man who has taken her on as her guardian. In the novel, she is constantly calling him “Guardian.” Honestly, it’s really annoying. In the miniseries adaptation, she notes several times that she regards him as a fatherly figure, which makes him uncomfortable. Hell, after he’s proposed and she’s accepted, he asks that they keep the engagement a secret to give Esther time to get used to the idea, because — and I quote Jarndyce’s dialogue in the miniseries here — “You thought of me more as a father; rather than a lover.” Regardless, throughout the whole of the novel, Esther has a powerful regard for him, mainly springing from a tremendous sense of gratitude for what he’s done for her. Jarndyce even mentions this when he breaks off the engagement, saying that he took advantage of her gratitude and affection for him when he proposed to her.\n\n###\n\nWHAT DOES ALL OF THIS MEAN FOR RED AND LIZ?\n\nYou may or may not have picked up on the patterns, but from the above examples, a few things become clear:\n\n1) THE MORE HEROIC, OR AT LEAST SYMPATHETIC, THE MALE CHARACTER IS, THE MORE LIKELY IT IS THAT THE MAY/SEPTEMBER PAIRING WILL END UP TOGETHER.\n\nAs you saw, the more villainous characters didn’t end up with their love interests at all.\n\nTurpin, Littlefinger and Mr. Boldwood all fall into deep ‘villain’ territory. Jorah and The Phantom maybe aren’t pure villains like those three, but they’ve committed pretty serious offenses against their love interests, so that puts them more in ‘anti-hero’ or ‘tragic hero’ camp.\n\nJarndyce is the only purely heroic character who DOESN’T end up with his love interest, but that’s because he falls into the “I want my beloved to be happy” trope — which we’ll discuss more in a minute. Brandon almost goes this route too, but circumstances work out in their favor.\n\nOf course, both Dantes and Rochester are Byronic heroes, who end up with their love interests, but only after some deep self-reflection and maybe even bits of atonement.\n\nLikewise, I wouldn’t say Elias is a Byronic hero exactly, but he is a mixture of heroic and villainous character traits, but with a sympathetic bend. It seems the reader is supposed to root for Elias, but his questionable past and some of his actions in the ‘present day’ indicate that he still has to grow a LOT emotionally for his relationship with Chise to be healthy.\n\n2) THE OLDER THE FEMALE CHARACTER IS WHEN SHE FIRST MEETS THE MALE CHARACTER, THE MORE LIKELY IT IS THAT THE PAIRING WILL END UP TOGETHER … OR, AT THE VERY LEAST, THE MORE LIKELY IT IS THAT SHE WILL ENTERTAIN HIS PROPOSALS.\n\nWith the exception of Haydee, all of our successful couples had met when the young lady was at least 15+. Chise is 15 when she meets Elias; Jane is 18-20 when she meets Rochester; and Marianne is 17 when she meets Colonel Brandon.\n\nAlso of note, Esther finally met Jarndyce when she was about 18; and Bathsheba met Boldwood when she was around 20.\n\nThe longer and the younger the man has known the young lady, the less likely it is that she will see him as a love interest.\n\nYou’ll also note that if the man is in a position of authority (guardian/teacher) over the young woman, it’s LESS likely that they will end up together. Littlefinger acts as Sansa’s father while she’s undercover in the Vale; Jorah is Dany’s adviser; Turpin is Johanna’s guardian; the Phantom is Christine’s teacher and sort of projected-onto father figure; and Jarndyce is Esther’s guardian.\n\nAgain, Dantes/Haydee are the big exception — and Elias/Chise to some degree, but he doesn’t take very long to tell her about his plans to make her his bride.\n\n3) IF THE FEMALE CHARACTER HAS ANOTHER, MORE AGE-APPROPRIATE LOVE INTEREST, THE LESS LIKELY IT IS THAT THE DISCUSSED PAIRING WILL END UP TOGETHER.\n\nLooking at the successful couples, none of them have younger love interests who REALLY compete for the woman’s affection over the older man’s. Haydee doesn’t have a younger love interest, and neither does Chise.\n\nJane does have a false love interest after she runs away from Rochester, but she rejects his offer of marriage as she isn’t in love with him and never could be.\n\nFor a period of time, it does seem to the reader that Marianne and Willoughby are going to end up together. However, after Willoughby’s true character is revealed and he marries another woman, the one plot element stopping Brandon and Marianne from being together is removed, allowing the pairing to eventually work out.\n\nBasically, if the woman DOES have a younger love interest, the best way to get him out of the picture is to have HIM run off with someone else, leaving the May/September pairing to get together.\n\nAnd, looking over the unsuccessful couples, it’s no wonder why they didn’t work out, especially if the younger love interest is more heroic or virtuous than the older man. Turpin, Jorah, the Phantom, Boldwood and even Littlefinger to a degree … all of them lose out to younger, better love interests.\n\nAnd, Jarndyce, likewise pulls the hero move and releases Esther from their engagement so she can be with Woodcourt, the man she loves.\n\n((And unofficially:\n\n4) OBVIOUSLY, THE MORE AFFECTION THE FEMALE CHARACTER FEELS FOR THE MALE CHARACTER, THE MORE LIKELY IT IS THAT THE PAIRING WILL END UP TOGETHER.\n\nThis is pretty obvious, so I won’t go into a lot of detail about it until later.))\n\n###\n\nBasically, if you want to overcome a 15+ year age gap, you need at least 2 of the 3 things in your favor. There’s no successful couple among the 10 pairings discussed who doesn’t have at least two of these three things going for them.\n\nSo, with all that in mind, let’s take a look at how Red and Liz stack up against these criteria for a successful May/September pairing:\n\nRaymond “Red” Reddington (alias), Elizabeth Keen (a.k.a. Masha Rostova) from The Blacklist\n\n1. IS RED A HEROIC, OR AT LEAST SYMPATHETIC, CHARACTER?\n\nAs discussed previously, Red is very much a modern-day version of a Byronic hero, in the same vein as Dantes or Rochester. He has done some wicked deeds, but he is very much a man who craves goodness, redemption and forgiveness.\n\nAnd, like Elias, he’s a very complicated character — a mixture of both heroic and villainous elements, and yet we (as the audience) are supposed to root for him. We are terrified of his dark nature, but realize that he desire to be more human and less monstrous.\n\nSo, is Red heroic? No, I wouldn’t say so. Granted, this show doesn’t have hardly any characters who would be “lawful good” on the alignment chart. Hell, even Cooper has shown that he’s willing to bend the rules in the name of ‘security’ or ‘the greater good.’ So, no, Red’s not a hero. Nobody on this show is; that’s the world that they live in.\n\nBut… is Red sympathetic? Yes. Again, if he’s a Byronic hero, he has as much chance of ending up with Liz as Rochester did with Jane or Dantes did with Haydee. And those pairings worked out. Elias and Chise… also worked out.\n\nTwo flawed, broken people who have a tendency to do darker things than they’d like but have a craving for goodness and righteousness … yeah, I’d say they have a good chance to be together.\n\nNow, it’s possible that Red could fall into ‘Phantom’ territory, as the Phantom is somewhat sympathetic, but, like Red, has done some very wicked and vile things, particularly to his love interest.\n\nBut, let’s maybe take a look at the other criteria first, and for now say that The Blacklist is 1 / 1.\n\n2. DID LIZ FIRST MEET RED WAS SHE WAS OLDER (15+)?\n\nThis is the problem child, right here. Because, technically, Liz FIRST met Red when she was 4 years old.\n\nHowever, unlike Johanna or Dany or Sansa, she wasn’t around Red constantly from there on out. She met him — as far as we know — once, briefly, under dire circumstances and then had her memory of the incident altered. She didn’t recognize him in the pilot; she had no idea they’d ever met before.\n\nIn Episode 2.10, she DOES recall he was at her house The Night of the Fire, but she just says “You were there,” and Red doesn’t deny it. We’re not sure if Liz remembers our Red being there (as he likely would’ve looked very different being 30 years younger and pre-plastic surgery) … or if she remembers “Raymond Reddington” (the real one, her dad) being there.\n\nBut, regardless, they only met the once (again, as far as we know). Liz was thereafter raised by Sam and didn’t REALLY meet Red until she was like 30 years old.\n\nSo, that’s good. Of all our above pairings, the oldest one of our women meeting her older love interest was 20-ish years old (Bathsheba meeting Boldwood). Liz should have a level of maturity, experience and wisdom that none of our above female characters had.\n\nNow, here’s the kicker: all of Season 5, Liz believed Red was her dad. This likely takes place over 2-3 years, based on Agnes’ age the few times we see her. So, for 2-3 years, Liz has believed that this man was her dad.\n\nNow, on the one hand, this definitely made her feel a sense of obligatory, filial love toward him; but on the other hand, if she’d ever had any kind of non-filial / non-platonic thoughts about him pre-Season 5, all of that now would now seem incredibly creepy and unwelcome in her mind.\n\nOf course, now, she knows differently. Even if she’s going to have to keep on acting like Red is her dad around him.\n\nWhile it’s definitely weird, I will say that Liz discovered this when she was an adult, after she’d known Red for years. It’s not like he’d been in her life this whole time, as a guardian-type figure. He’s never REALLY been in a position of authority over her. In the pilot, he specifically remarks that they’re going to be a great TEAM. Shortly after, Liz gets mad at him saying that they’re not a team, and she’s not his partner. So, from the outset, the powers that be were trying to implant in our minds the notion that Liz and Red are equals. Whether they really are is another question; but that was, at least, the intent.\n\nSo, overall… let’s say 0.5 points for this one, giving us 1.5 / 2 total.\n\n3. DOES LIZ HAVE ANOTHER, YOUNGER LOVE INTEREST?\n\nThis clearly would’ve been Tom, except that he’s dead.\n\nYep, the powers that be went the Willoughby route and paired the ~false love interest~ off with someone or, in this case, something else: his coffin, six feet under.\n\nI should note that in all the above examples (with the exception of Linus/Sabrina) all the older male love interests were in the picture BEFORE the younger male interests were. (With Linus and Sabrina, the two brothers entered Sabrina’s life simultaneously.) We never had an instance where the YOUNGER man was there first, and the older man stepped into her life to become her love interest.\n\nBut, what about the possibility of the showrunners giving Liz *another* younger love interest now that Tom’s dead? Well, I mean… I guess they *could*. But comments from the showrunners after Episode 5.08 indicate that Red & Liz are our endgame coupling. I suppose they could have some nice, normal guy enter Liz’s life, she falls in love with him, and they ride off into the sunset with Red’s “I just want my beloved to be happy” blessing, a la The Phantom and Jarndyce.\n\nThey could. But really, they kind of already did that in Seasons 1-5. Red specifically tells Tom that he didn’t kill him at the first wedding because of how much Liz loved him. And, after Liz found out “Red” was her father, Red played along like the ‘father of the bride’ and let Liz and Tom pretty much do their own thing (minus the Bag O’ Bones nonsense).\n\nNo. I don’t think the powers that be are going to give Liz another long-term love interest. They might have her date some other guy(s) to show us that she’s moving on from Tom. Hell, maybe they’ll have her and Ressler hook-up because we just need more weird Grey’s Anatomy / Eskimo brothers and sisters bullshit on this show.\n\nSo… 2.5 / 3. Not bad.\n\nBut, let’s look at that last one:\n\n4. WHAT KIND OF AFFECTION DOES LIZ HAVE FOR RED?\n\nWell, clearly, right now (at the end of Season 5) she hates him.\n\nAny “I care about you, deal with that” … any “Where’s my friend?” … any “Raymond, I do love—”… any “I’ll come for you” … that’s all out the window. She hates Red’s guts right now.\n\nAnd, honestly, I don’t think that’s a bad thing. Under the circumstances, I’d say that’s pretty reasonable. If I found out someone had stolen my dad’s identity and had been playing some kind of game with me… I don’t think I’d want to kill him; but, I definitely wouldn’t want him in my life any more.\n\nLooking back over our above pairings, the only other instance where the young woman completely hates the older man is Johanna and Judge Turpin. And, while I hate to use them as an example, they provide a good contrast for Red & Liz.\n\nTurpin, unlike Red, is a pure villain. He’s a pervert; he abused Johanna’s mother; he basically sentenced her father to death; and his intentions toward Johanna are purely physical and selfish.\n\nRed, on the other hand — while he’s done some dark deeds — has treated Liz like a gentleman should. He does withhold some truths; he does endanger her. But he’s also been willing to give his life for hers several times now; he’s offered to walk away; and he’s helped her in every way he can, including giving her space when she asks him to.\n\nSo, Red has an advantage here.\n\nJohanna has also always regarded Turpin as her guardian; not as a love interest. Liz, on the other hand, was introduced to Red as a grown woman.\n\nAdvantage Red/Liz.\n\nAnd, Johanna had a younger love interest, which Liz currently does not.\n\nSo, while Red and Liz have 2.5 of the 3 boxes checked, Johanna/Tuprin have none, which shouldn’t be surprising to anyone who’s seen Sweeney Todd.\n\nAnyway, my real point here is that Red & Liz are much better off. Characters’ feelings can change very easily (see… the entirety of The Blacklist up to this point). But, having the show’s plot and themes working in favor of the pairing… that’s a lot harder to change retroactively.\n\nAnd, honestly, if Liz didn’t hate Red, I think her character would be unlikable. If she were blindly loyal to him the way Chise is to Elias and Haydee is to Dantes — to the point where readers/viewers argue whether they have any free will of their own — we’d hate her for it.\n\nIf she were like Christine in The Phantom of the Opera, only taking pity on him for what the world’s hatred has made him become… it would be out-of-character for her.\n\nIf she looked on him with filial or platonic gratitude, the way Esther saw Jarndyce, or Dany sees Jorah, or Sansa sees Littlefinger, it would basically mean that Red would forever be in the ‘dad-zone’ or ‘friend-zone.’\n\nNo, her hating him is good, because it means she doesn’t NOT see him as a potential love interest. If she loved him as a father figure or as a friend, TPTB would have her run off to end up with someone else while Red went the Jarndyce/Phantom route.\n\nRight now, Liz is taken aback much in the same way that Jane is when she finds out Rochester’s secret. She feels betrayed, hurt and vulnerable. She’s lashing out by distancing herself from him in an effort to protect herself and her feelings, in the way that both Jane try to run away from their love interests. Granted, Liz’s reaction has much more vitriol behind it, but I think it’s going to cool down eventually once the truth comes out and Red does something to make amends.\n\nYeah, it’d be nice, if like Jane, Liz still had SOME measure of good feeling toward Red. But, I’ll take what I can get. As I said, I think any other reaction like those in the above examples would be out-of-character for her.\n\nRemember: Liz also hated Tom’s guts right after she found out he’d betrayed her, and snapped the dude’s fingers and chained him up on a boat for like 8 months. And then they had a kid together and got married.\n\nIf Liz is already plotting Red’s death, I think it’s safe to say we’ll be hearing wedding bells in no time.\n\nSo, for now, we’ve got like 2.5 out of the 4 overall checkpoints. But, that last one could change very easily.\n\nAuthor’s Note: And, as Season 6 showed us, it already has! Liz has admitted her feelings for Red by telling him that she loves him and by constantly working to save his life after she betrayed him.\n\nAnd, yes, I realize that I said above that it would be bad if Liz ‘dad-zoned’ him, which she seemed to do toward the end of Season 6, by saying that he will always be her and Agnes’ family. I would argue, however, that she only did so because this was her way of forcing Red to be in her life, after he threatened to excommunicate her for betraying him. She basically told him: “You can’t get rid of us because we’re ~family~” and then brought Agnes back into the picture, which almost comes across as emotional blackmail. “You can’t walk away from us now, because I’ve decided to bring Agnes home.” And, we all know that Red would do literally anything for Agnes, just as much as he would for Liz. And where Liz has transgressed, Agnes has not. So, again, emotional blackmail.\n\nPlus, I personally don’t think that Liz seeing Red in this vaguely familial way is a bad thing in this case. Liz has had her walls up against Red, more or less, pretty much since Day 1. She let them down, for sure, when they were on the run together in Season 3, but they went right back up after her name was cleared, she found out she was pregnant, and Red said the fight against the Cabal wasn’t over.\n\nNow, though, she has clearly let him into her and Agnes’ life in a very personal way — meaning that she’s letting down her guard around him. And, as I discussed in my post about why people hate Liz so much, Red has loved Liz far longer and far deeper than she has seemingly ever loved him. So, it’d be great to see her continue to treat him with this modicum of affection that she had for him in Season 3, which has rekindled since she betrayed him in early Season 6. Let’s see Liz put some effort into her ‘relationship’ with Red, rather than just being an inert object that the force of Red’s love acts upon.\n\nAs for his weird thing with Katarina in the Season 6 finale… I hate that scene for a variety of reasons. Even still, I won’t pass judgment on what was happening there until I get more context. Was Red just messing with Katarina? Was he acting in a certain way to win her over and gain information from her — as he did with Madeline Pratt in Season 1? From the little we saw, it didn’t appear that he was really interested in kissing her initially; plus, Red is generally an affectionate guy who has no problem lip-kissing his female friends and cheek-kissing his male friends. So… there’s a lot in the air right now, which is why I’m not going to pass judgment on it just yet.\n\nUntil the final scene in the series finale (which — who knows — could be in May if Season 7 ends up being the last one), I will continue to believe that Red and Liz are the endgame couple for this show. As I said in the title, I think — given everything I wrote about above — these two love birds have a better shot than most of these other pairings.\n\nI’m just curious to see how it’s all going to come about.\n\nI will be the first to admit that I enjoy watching my favorite shows and movie franchises partly because I want to see certain characters get together romantically. One of the things that keeps me excited to watch my programs is for those little moments between these characters – holding hands, meaningful glances, words of affection and care. While I know it doesn’t drive everybody to watch any or all of their favorite shows or movie franchises, I know it’s the driving force behind much of it on the internet, particularly certain social media platforms.\n\nI know that all of this harkens back to age-old storytelling tropes: love triangles, unrequited love, etc., all of which have been around since fucking mythology. And it’s not changing any time soon. And, that’s fine.\n\nBut I also think it’s important that, in the midst of all these ‘shipping’ wars, we don’t lose sight of what often holds – or at least what SHOULD hold – movie franchises and TV shows together: friendships and positive (or sometimes negative) platonic interactions between characters.\n\nI know there are a lot of shows that do this, and do it well. No doubt.\n\nBut, I want to draw your attention to 30 Rock, one of my all-time favorite shows.\n\nThere are a lot of interesting and great and completely platonic relationships between the male and female characters on the show: Liz and Pete. Liz and Frank. Liz and Kenneth. You will notice I’m not including Jenna much on this list because, aside from Pete, she has sex with most of her other male coworkers at one point or other in the show, including Jack, Kenneth and Frank. And, while she doesn’t develop any long-term romantic relationships with any of them and is able to have crucial friendships with all of them (especially Kenneth), I wanted all my examples to be completely platonic.\n\nBut, if you will indulge me, let’s take a deeper dive into the three male-female friendships that were the heart of this show:\n\n(I’m going to go backwards in terms of screen time and importance)\n\n1. TRACY AND JENNA\n\nThis is a dynamic that ultimately works, even though it really shouldn’t on a practical level. Both of these characters are complete narcissists – selfish, self-absorbed, and unintelligent to a degree. Tracy is a buffoon, and Jenna is a diva.\n\nBut the biggest drawback to their dynamic – their egos – is also their starting point and the reason it kinda works, for the most part.\n\nTracy and Jenna bond over their shared experiences of the pressures of stardom and fame. They bond over their shared dealings with Liz, Jack, and Pete. And, despite Jenna being kind of a sex freak, she and Tracy never get together, and to my recollection, neither ever makes the moves on the other.\n\nThey collaborate on various projects – Jenna’s song that gets parodied by Weird Al; Tracy’s Broadway performance for his EGOT; Jenna trying to get back with her ex-boyfriend Paul after her ‘sexual walkabout’ fails; and when they help Liz “problem-solve” her Deal Breakers talk show with Jack, among others.\n\nYet, they fight a lot too, giving the show plenty of drama and conflict to overcome in any given episode; but this also gives the show a sense of realism among its friendship dynamics.\n\nJenna is upset at Tracy for intruding on her show, and she never really gets over it. Tracy is mad at Jenna for various things – but later on in the series, it’s because Jenna starts gaining fame and notoriety after she becomes a judge on America’s Kidz Got Singing.\n\n(You will see that all these friendships have their high and low points: they get along; they support each other; but they also fight, and when they do, they know each other’s weak points to attack. Because that’s what friends do in real life: sometimes they disagree, and when they do it’s ugly. But when they’re going strong, it’s like the best thing ever.)\n\nStill, after being on television together almost every week for seven years, these two have become understandably close. It’s to the point where (SPOILERS), in the finale, they share a tearful hug, and Jenna says, genuinely, that she’s going to miss working with him. He tells her that he’s going out to get cigarettes, and he’ll be back in 15 minutes. (This is a reference to earlier in the episode, where he said he’s in denial about the show ending, and admits that he doesn’t know how to or want to say goodbye to his castmates and friends.)\n\nThis dynamic, while childish and frustrating at times, flourishes because, while these are two people who oftentimes can’t stand each other, Tracy and Jenna ultimately understand what the other is going through better than anyone else on the show.\n\n2. TRACY AND LIZ\n\nThis was sort of the kick-off for the whole series. Tracy Jordan is asked to come on The Girlie Show, and essentially save it. Over the course of the series, Tracy proved to Liz that while he was a good person and cared deeply about his family and friends, he was extremely difficult to work with. He rarely, if ever, took orders. He was selfish, had a huge ego, and serious issues to work through in his personal and professional life.\n\nAnd while Liz supported Tracy through his ordeals more than he supported her, whenever he did offer advice, words of encouragement or assistance, it was always genuine, heartfelt, and second nature for him to do so.\n\nFor her part, while Tracy mostly made her professional and sometimes personal life absolute hell, he (and Jenna) ultimately prepared her for anything. (SPOILERS: In the series’ penultimate episode, she adopts two kids exactly like her two ‘work kids.’)\n\nAnd even though Tracy has an ego, his star power saved her show.\n\nLater in the series, Tracy finds out just how hard Liz Lemon has to work to get him to do his job everyday. And while he doesn’t show his appreciation outwardly, it’s clear he’s grown to respect her even more.\n\nIn one episode, Tracy’s wife demands that he have an affair (to save his image), and he “tries” to “seduce” Liz. It is unsuccessful, for many reasons, but in the conversation that follows, we really start to see why this dynamic works so well, even when they don’t work well together.\n\nLiz admits that she’s jealous of Tracy for having a well-put-together personal life: he has a wife he’s totally devoted to, and kids who see him as their hero. And, even still, as the series progresses so does Tracy’s career (to a degree). Yet he stays on their show.\n\nEven though he has no qualm about making Liz’s day-to-day life hellish, when the chips are down, he does listen to her, follows her advice and obeys her directions.\n\nEach of them has a great respect for the other; it’s just that Tracy is so childish and Liz is so bossy that neither of them expresses or demonstrates it all that often, except in very rare but poignant moments.\n\n3. JACK AND LIZ\n\nUnlike the other two on this list, this one arguably could have been a romantic pairing. Throughout the series, there are several “shippy” moments between these two, starting in the first season, where – after Jack asks her to be his ‘date’ to a black-tie event – she thinks Jack is going to make a move on her. In reality, though, he just wanted back the necklace that he’d lent her, and then he makes it VERY clear that he never intended that, insulting her in the process.\n\nJack’s mother Colleen thinks that Liz would be a perfect match for him, romantically, because she has “strength of character.” There’s the scene where Jack pretends that Liz is his lover, and they act out a soap-opera-esque scene to trick Kathy Geiss in Season 3. Liz has a dream where she’s giving birth to Jack’s baby (weirdly, of course, it’s Meat Cat, a parody of the animated Cheeto’s Mascot) in Season 4. Jack pretends to be in love with Liz in Season 4, but only so her guy-pal Danny will stop paying attention to Liz and start hanging out more with him. They get married (by accident) in Season 5. Avery gets jealous of Jack and Liz’s “special” relationship, after he tells Liz about his and Avery’s possible names for their kid, and listens to her “advice.” There’s the “kiss” between them in Season 6. They share a bed (but nothing else happens) in Season 7, where Liz even asks out loud why nothing ever DID happen between them. And (SPOILERS) one of the last moments in the finale is them saying that they love each other, although Jack makes it very clear that it’s in the platonic sense.\n\nBut, these moments all do a great job of subverting this “will they, won’t they” trope. Hell, even Jeffrey Weinerslav (the HR/hiring guy) says whenever they were “married” that they’ve always given off that vibe, and “It’s been interesting to watch your courtship.”\n\nI think the ultimate reason why is: that’s not who they are. That’s not who they want to be to each other. Jack isn’t attracted to Liz like that, and Liz was always Jack’s subordinate who disagreed with him on several things – politics, life choices, gender roles/expectations, age gap, etc.\n\nBut, that didn’t mean that their relationship wasn’t important.\n\nAfter all, Liz was Jack’s emergency contact as early as Season 1. He oftentimes trusted and relied on her when he wouldn’t trust or rely on anyone else. Despite proclaiming that he had all these powerful, wealthy, and famous friends throughout the series, ultimately, in Season 7, we find out that Liz is the only true friend that Jack really has.\n\nDespite being boss/employee and mentor/mentee, Jack isn’t afraid to let Liz fail. He’s comfortable going out of his way to help her in a way he wouldn’t with many of his other employees (probably because she’s his mentee/friend, which, fair enough.)\n\nIn the episode “Problem Solvers,” when Liz pushes Jack away in an effort to protect herself and explore her professional options, Jack is legitimately offended, and acts likewise with her. He even has a revelation that he “wants to do business” with Liz, rather than anyone else – wanting to change and improve her life, instead of, say, Padma Lakshmi’s. He puts his personal interests over the bottom line, and – as ‘Future Jack’ tells him in a hallucination – that’s ultimately how he becomes happy in life. He used to be a shark, and Liz Lemon “un-shark-ulated” him. But, caring about her (and others) is what makes him a better and happier person, as ‘Future Jack’ demonstrates.\n\nAnd, as he tells Avery, she’s the perfect mentee because she has the Drive, Intelligence, Chaos and Humility (or DICH) in her life to require and accept his mentorship.\n\nAnd, for her part, Liz is comfortable with Jack in a way she isn’t with most people. She tells him everything – her weird foot problems, her relationship troubles, her very awkward and embarrassing secrets – to the point where Jack is “in her head,” and she can predict how he would react and what kind of advice he would give even in hypothetical situations. She goes out of her way to make Jack feel like a part of her family, and a part of her life, as she invites him to go with her to class reunions and meeting up with her family.\n\nWe see over and over that Liz is willing to demean and embarrass herself for Jack’s benefit – taking off her shirt and dancing around as a distraction when he embarrasses himself in front of his colleagues… pretending to be pregnant to keep suspicion off Jack’s wife Avery, who really IS pregnant… calling in bomb threats so his high school crush will stay in town an extra day. And, these are just a handful of examples.\n\nFor someone that Jack looks down on for being a woman, a writer or ‘creative type’, a less-than-model-attractive person, and a relatively unambitious un-shark-like person… Liz comes through for Jack more often than most people do. And, Jack looks out for her, too. He even loses a deal against himself in Season 6, purposely making a mistake in negotiations over Liz’s contract, because he wants to “take care of her.”\n\nThis relationship is the heart of the show, as is clear from both the pilot and the finale. Jack walks in and seemingly ruins Liz’s life. He fires her friend Pete; he forces her to hire Tracy; and he expects much more of her than she believes is right. But, over time they become more than employer/employee… they become the best of friends, to the point where their friendship is the most meaningful one in either of their lives.\n\nIn the penultimate episode, “Hogcock!”, Jack and Liz – both in professional and personal spirals – argue. Liz asks Jack for help finding a new job; Jack says he really can’t, and he won’t, because he’s realized that work will never make either of them really happy. Liz questions what their entire relationship has been about for the last seven years, saying, “I guess you and I were just a boss and his employee.” And Jack agrees.\n\nThis argument sends both of them further down their spirals, as Jack tries to reconcile, as he doesn’t really have anything else he can count on in his life. And, Liz acts in her typical Lemon-esque behavior and refuses.\n\nIn the finale (SPOILERS), Jack’s faux-suicidal behavior forces Liz to overcome her trademark stubbornness and grudge-holding to accept and admit that Jack is someone special whose friendship she doesn’t want to lose, regardless of what happens to them in life.\n\nAgain, this is all stuff that is typical of romantic couples on TV. But, over and over again, 30 Rock subverts these tropes, leading to one of the most poignant and, dare I say, realistic relationships on the show.\n\nThis is one of the reasons I really admire this show: the fact that it had a man and a woman, against all odds, remaining platonic friends, regardless of all the chaos and changes in their lives.\n\nOn TV, it has become commonplace for even workplace acquaintances to hook-up, to the point where everyone is basically ‘Eskimo brothers’ and ‘sisters’ with each other. (See Grey’s Anatomy as an example.)\n\nAnd, while yes, this happens on 30 Rock to some extent, the three main male-female friendships remain ever-sacred in that regard. Jenna sleeps around with many of her male coworkers, but she never makes the moves on Tracy (to my recollection). Jack and Liz are continually implied (by both the audience and in-show characters) to be something more than what they are, but they never become a ‘couple’ in that sense.\n\nAnd, that’s fine.\n\nIt’s perfectly normal, and, dare I say, healthy for people to work together, share office space, daily stress, yearly challenges, and be a major part of each other’s professional and sometimes personal lives without them ever hooking up, or even considering it.\n\nThe fact that Liz and Jack remain platonic throughout seven seasons, and admit, meaningfully, that they love each other in the finale is a huge thing.\n\nI think it promotes a healthy dynamic among straight men and women: it is perfectly normal, healthy, and even ideal for you to have strong friendships with people of the opposite sex.\n\n(For LGBTQ+ folks, this would be people of any sex/gender you’re attracted to. It is possible and healthy for us all to have strong friendships with people, regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, etc.)\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nIn a culture of ‘shipping’ and possible ‘over-sexualization’ of things in our media, it’s become commonplace for us to see a young, handsome, straight guy and want him to end up with the young, beautiful, straight gal, especially if they’re our lead protagonists. And, there’s nothing wrong with that.\n\nBut, I wish more shows would imitate 30 Rock, in that it revolved around a group of friends, who rarely if ever, consider each other in a romantic or sexual way. Yes, they might break that rule on occasion; yes, they might make jokes about it; but ultimately, their friendships are the driving force of the show (both for the audience and in-universe). Friendships between people of different races, personalities, ambitions, socioeconomic backgrounds, upbringings, professions; friendships between employers and employees; friendships between men and women.\n\nPeople can watch their modern-day soap operas disguised as superhero shows or medical procedurals or crime dramas.\n\nThat’s totally fine. I watch them too, and I enjoy it.\n\nBut, I more so enjoy and appreciate those shows that can stand on their own, without relying on “will they, won’t they” dynamics, love triangles, and unrequited love. Shows about friendships and platonic love.\n\nShows like 30 Rock.\n\nFor whatever reason, over the past month, I’ve had about four separate people blast me for never having seen Top Gun. (Don’t worry, that will soon be remedied in an upcoming iteration of “Catching the Classics.”) And, while I understand that Top Gun is a popular and iconic movie, I really don’t think it’s THAT big of a shocker that I haven’t seen it. It came out five years before I was born; it’s not exactly a kids’ movie or a family film, per se, even though it is rated PG; and neither of my parents owned it. And, of course, by the time I was grown up, all the pop culture talk had hyped it up so much and spoiled some of the major plot points for me so that I wasn’t really interested in watching it.\n\nIn doing the “Catching the Classics” series, I’ve come across a lot of movies that, for some reason or another, I had never seen before. Something like Jurassic Park, which came out in my life time and is a sort of family-friendly adventure movie, is hard to excuse, I will admit. But, then there are movies like Unforgiven or The Green Mile, both of which — even though they were released in my lifetime — are rated R. And, as I’ve discussed on the show before, I’m not a fan of dark, violent, brutal, R-rated movies, for the most part. While I enjoyed both films, they’re not the kind that I seek out in my day-to-day movie-watching experience. (Which is a good reason for doing the “Catching the Classics.”) Similarly, The Godfather, while iconic, is rated R and came out decades before I was born. Even my dad had never seen it up until maybe 10 years ago, and even he thought it was overrated. So, why would I have seen it? (Before doing CtC, that is.)\n\nAnyway, because of all this, I wanted to put together a list of 10 movies that are actual classics that I feel like everyone has to have seen by now. (And by “everyone,” I mean your run-of-the-mill middle-class American audiences.) These are movies that — unlike many films on the IMDB Top 250 List or the AFI Top 100 List — are approachable, family friendly and seemingly on TV all the time.\n\nThis isn’t necessarily to say that these movies are perfect or even high-quality. But they’re beloved, for sure. Cult classics, family favorites, and movie marathons kind of stuff.\n\nThese are the movies that, if you haven’t seen them by now, you probably have less of an excuse than I have for never watching Top Gun.\n\nAnd, FYI: You’ll note that I cheated on a few of these entries.\n\n#10: The Sound of Music\n\nGranted, I’ve only ever seen this movie once, but it’s a classic that I know ABC Family or a similar channel used to play every Easter. It’s a long one, yes, made even longer by all the incessant commercials. But, again, I would be surprised if a friend or coworker told me they’d never seen it. Everyone knows “My Favorite Things” and “The Sound of Music” (the song), so that means most people have probably seen the movie at some point in their lives. Plus, it’s from 1965, so that means that even your 60-something coworker has probably seen it, too. And besides, who doesn’t love watching an adorable Austrian family escape the Nazis through the power of song… and some nuns who know how to disable cars?\n\n#9: The Karate Kid (1984)\n\nI feel like I’ve seen this movie on TV several times. It’s so iconic that they remade it in the 2000s with Jackie Chan and Jaden Smith. Everyone knows Mr. Miyagi, the crane kick and “wax on, wax off,” which is unfortunate, because it’s made everyone believe that you can learn martial arts by doing household chores. And, as someone who trained in martial arts for like 8 years, I can tell you: no, that’s not how it works. YOU. DO. NOT. LEARN. TO. BLOCK. BY. PAINTING. A. FENCE. I get that Mr. Miyagi was trying to help Daniel build muscle memory; and while painting fences and waxing cars may be similar movements, as my instructor used to say, “Practice doesn’t make perfect. *Perfect* practice makes perfect.” Meaning that if you want to have accurate muscle memory of the technique, you need to actually learn how to do the technique… not something similar to it. Anyway, sorry, I had to get on my soapbox for a second, but I’d be surprised if someone hadn’t seen this movie, given how accessible and pervasive it is.\n\n#8: Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory\n\nThis is another movie that, yes, while it was based on existing source material, has also been remade. It’s full of iconic songs and other very weird but memorable scenes, some of which have become memes. Plus, I feel like they used to play it on ABC Family all the time, so I don’t know how someone — especially if they’re close to my age — could’ve avoided it.\n\n#7: Either of the good Indiana Jones movies\n\nBetween the star power of Harrison Ford, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, I don’t know why anyone who was alive in 1981 didn’t see Raiders of the Lost Ark when it came out. And, then in 1989, when they added Sean Connery to the roster for The Last Crusade… how could anyone have missed these movies? Even I, who wasn’t alive when either of them came out, had seen each multiple times before I was in high school. Not only have they been on TV a lot as part of Indiana Jones movie marathons, especially when The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull came out in 2008… but I feel like the video cassettes were everywhere back when VCRs were a thing. And, of course anyone over 18 who’s somehow escaped seeing them up to this point can just watch them on Netflix or Amazon Prime, which has made them even more accessible.\n\n#6: The Princess Bride\n\nAbout five years ago now, when I was working at another job, we found out that one of our coworkers had never seen this movie. Of course, my work-friends and I all gave her a hard time, and one of us lent it to her so she could finally watch it. From what I recall, she enjoyed it, but didn’t think it was as good as we all had told her it was. But, for me, I can’t remember how old I was the first time I watched The Princess Bride. It’s a movie that, for many millennials and Gen-Xers, is so integral in our movie-watching lives; and, for myself, I have no idea how that came to be. Did my parents own it that we watched it on video? Did I see it on TV at some point? I’m sure it’s some combination of the two, but I genuinely don’t remember how or when or why I first saw this movie. I know it’s been on TV, and of course I think it’s made the rounds on Netflix at some point recently, but seemingly everyone I know has seen this movie, and I don’t know how. Was it just on TV all the time in the early 90s, and I don’t quite remember it? Or did everyone who was alive in 1987 go see in the theaters, buy it on video and then watch it with their kids when it came out? Who knows? But, it’s mega-popular, and people quote it all the time. So for someone to have not seen it is inconceivable! (Are you proud of me for how long I waited to do that joke?)\n\n#5: Any of the Back to the Future movies\n\nIf you’ve had access to cable TV any time in the last 20 years, you’ve seen any or all of these movies. They are impossible to escape given how often ABC Family or TNT or whatever channel(s) show movie marathons of all three back-to-back-to-back. It’s so well-known that it’s becoming the shorthand for certain time travel concepts in other movies and TV shows like Avengers: Endgame or The Flash. Unlike The Terminator, which I’ve still never seen, this is a family-friendly time travel movie. So, how anyone over 14 hasn’t seen it is beyond me.\n\n#4: The Wizard of Oz\n\nAs someone who is from Kansas, I cannot tell you how many times people have quoted this movie to me. “You’re not in Kansas anymore.” Yeah, no shit, Sherlock. Another classic movie that, given how old it is, I don’t know how people would’ve escaped seeing it on TV at some point. Even people in nursing homes nowadays may have seen it in the theaters when it first came out. This one hasn’t been on TV nearly to the same degree as the BTTF trilogy, but I feel like it’s a movie that if your family didn’t own it on video, your grandparents or aunts or uncles or friends probably did. So, someone who’s never seen it is as scary as flying monkeys and violent trees. Say a person reached 18 and still had never seen The Wizard of Oz. Given how pervasive it is in the cultural zeitgeist, I can’t see how they wouldn’t have checked it out as an adult just to see what all the fuss was about. (In the same way that I had to watch The Godfather, because it’s a ~classic~.)\n\n#3: A Christmas Story\n\nYou all know why this is on the list, don’t you? Because of that frickin’ movie marathon every year on TBS. Really, I feel like movie marathons are sometimes more responsible for giving a movie ‘classic’ status — or at the very least, ‘cult classic’ status — than a movie’s actual quality. (It’s A Wonderful Life is another example of this.) I guarantee you more people between the ages of 20 and 40 have seen this than Unforgiven or Princess Mononoke, both of which are actually good movies. But, again, it comes down to how approachable and accessible a movie is, and not necessarily how good it is. Put a light, fun, holiday-themed movie on TV for 24 hours straight every year since 1997, and everyone will watch it at some point.\n\n#2: Any animated Disney movie\n\nGranted, this is one of those entries where I cheated, as it’s not an individual movie or even a movie series. This is a list of almost 60 separate films going back to 1937. But, there are people out there who don’t really like or watch Disney movies, or animated movies at all for that matter. I remember a few years ago, I was talking to my former editor, and he mentioned how he’d never seen The Lion King or Beauty & The Beast or basically any Disney movie from the last 35 years. Now, I have since clarified with him that he HAS seen some older ones — Bambi, The Jungle Book, etc. But while those are classics, the movies of the Disney Renaissance (1989-1999) are high-quality films that’d be pretty hard to miss, IMO. But, there’s a stigma out there (and granted, it seems to be lessening in recent years) that animated movies are only for kids and families. If you’re a Baby Boomer and you don’t have kids or grandkids, why would you watch Ralph Breaks the Internet or The Princess and the Frog? But, just because they’re animated and “for kids” doesn’t mean they’re not good. I’m an adult with no children or even nieces and nephews, and I still went to go see Moana in the theater. And, I had a great time! I’m sure there’s not many people out there who haven’t seen *a* Disney movie, but given how much I watched them as a kid, how much I still watch them, how pervasive they are in pop culture, and how accessible they’ve been on TV and now on Netflix… how could people possibly have not seen even just one?!\n\n#1: Any of the Star Wars movies\n\nSo, I can think of three people I’ve encountered in my adult life who have never or only recently watched Star Wars movies. And, no, none of them are kids.\n\nOne is a family friend who’s in his 60s now and doesn’t really go to a lot of movies. Still, he would’ve been in his 20s when Star Wars came out in 1977… but he told me, when The Force Awakens came out a few years ago, that he went to see it DESPITE NEVER HAVING SEEN ANY OF THE OTHER STAR WARS MOVIES?!!?!? Then again, at least he’s seen one.\n\nAbout five years ago, when I was still living in Kansas and went to visit my best friend, we were figuring out what we were going to watch for a movie night. Her roommate, whom I was also sort-of friends with, overheard our discussion and made a comment about how she’d never seen Star Wars. Any of them. My jaw hit the floor.\n\nAnd then, as I was writing this, I was chatting with a former coworker (the one who’d lent out The Princess Bride to our other coworker) about this post, and he reminded me that *another* one of my former coworkers still hasn’t seen Star Wars. (This is NOT the same one who hadn’t seen TPB, though.) I did a verbal double-take. “What?! Did you just say she’s never seen Star Wars?” And he reminded me that we’d already had this conversation with her years ago, when I still worked there. “You must’ve blotted it from your memory,” he said, because he knows how outraged I was about it.\n\nGranted, I say this as someone who grew up with two sets of the Star Wars 1995 VHS collection, all sorts of action figures and — once The Phantom Menace came out in 1999 — bed sheets and pillow cases and even more action figures. Like, I shit you not, I had seen every movie in the original trilogy about a half-dozen times each before my first day of kindergarten! I literally do not remember watching any of those movies for the first time, that’s how young I was. (I imagine we’ll talk about this more when The Rise of Skywalker comes out.)\n\nI mean, if people told me they’d never seen The Godfather or Shawshank Redemption or Citizen Kane or Casablanca, I’d kind of understand. The first two are more modern classics, sure, but they’re dark, violent and rated R. And while Citizen Kane and Casablanca are iconic in terms of Old Hollywood and movie tropes and whatnot, I get that not everyone my age grew up with parents who liked old movies. (Gone With The Wind was another one I watched a lot as a kid. My parents are weird.)\n\nBut, if you tell me that you’ve never seen any Star Wars movie — which is not only mega-iconic but there are movie marathons of them on TV all the time — you better be an immigrant or Amish or something, because otherwise, you’ve definitely lost cool points in my eyes. (And, who knows, maybe that doesn’t bother you.)\n\nSome Final Thoughts\n\nI realize, of course, that this is subjective. While I think it’s ridiculous if someone hasn’t seen The Wizard of Oz, others will think it’s insane that I’ve never seen Top Gun. Perhaps they grew up in a home where their mom or dad loved Top Gun and had it on VHS, and they’d seen it 20 times before they were in high school; and maybe they didn’t grow up with cable TV like I did, so they never saw the marathons of A Christmas Story or Back to the Future on TV. Maybe.\n\nOur experiences will differ, obviously. What is a classic in my eyes might be a “I’ve heard people talk about it before but I’ve never bothered to watch it” kind of film for you. And, vice versa. Hence why I’m doing the “Catching the Classics” series.\n\nOf course, I can understand why, if people have gone so long without seeing it, they might not ever want to. With some of these CtC episodes, I’m finding out that watching a movie where plot points and character reveals have been ruined for you by cultural osmosis can be a disappointing or underwhelming experience. “I don’t get why people love this so much. What’s the big deal?” My reaction to watching Se7en for the first time wasn’t so different from my former coworker’s when she first saw The Princess Bride.\n\nAnd, I certainly understand that not everyone has the time or inclination to seek out these missed classics the way I have. But, if you do have the time and energy, you should… if only so you can maybe better understand the people around you and what is is about these movies that they love so much.\n\nAnd, in the case of Top Gun, I’m assuming it’s the shirtless volleyball.\n\nI’m a little ashamed to admit that I’ve been watching a lot of romcoms recently. I say ‘ashamed’ mostly because the genre as a whole has a reputation of dumbing-down human relations into “desperate woman and loser man stumble into romantic relationship” or some version of same. Women like me are often given a pass for watching romcoms because the genre is seen as ‘wish fulfillment’ (and for some reason, action/superhero movies aren’t *eyeroll*)… But even then, intelligent women often have to explain away their favorite movies as a ‘guilty pleasure.’\n\nWell, fuck guilty pleasures and fuck wish fulfillment.\n\nI like romcoms!\n\nIt may be a frowned-upon genre, but every year, millions of people — women AND men — sit down and watch these movies. So, the question is: why can’t they be good? Why, time after time, does Hollywood feed us the same formulaic bullshit and simply switch around the actors, the setting and the minor details, and present it to us in the guise of a new movie? Granted, all genres are starting to see this, with the superhero genre being a timely example, but I don’t want to waste my time watching shitty romcoms, or shitty movies in general. Maybe the reason the genre is frowned upon isn’t because the genre is bad, but because so many of the movies in it ARE.\n\nRomcoms can trace their ‘lineage,’ so to speak, back to Shakespeare and his contemporaries, when confused identities and coincidental mix-ups were the impetus of much — if not all — of the hi-jinks that ensued. So, why is it socially acceptable for me to enjoy a production of Twelfth Night, but not She’s The Man?\n\nOf course, now, many of the typical elements of romcoms are written off as too far-fetched or too contrived. Yes, a woman who waters a former pop star’s plants being secretly talented at writing song lyrics is far-fetched, but a whiny teen gaining the powers of the gods when he literally did nothing to prove himself isn’t? (Can you tell that I’m still underwhelmed by Shazam?) Yes, film is an art form. But, it’s also a form of entertainment. Unless it’s based on a true story or true events, it’s meant for escapism.\n\nAnyway, as I was watching all these movies over the last week or so, I started to ask myself: What should I be looking for in a romcom? What makes one romcom good from another?\n\nOn the 2018 Filmsplosion episode, Henry and I were discussing how in 2018, we started to see a revival in the romcom genre.

Annie wants to leave her little town, be more adventurous and grow as a person outside her relationship with Duncan. Tucker, meanwhile, wants more normalcy and a healthy relationship after having so many unsuccessful ones in his rock-star days. Not only that, but they have great on-screen che"
