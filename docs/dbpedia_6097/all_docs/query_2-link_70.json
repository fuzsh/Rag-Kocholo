        "text": "ROSALINE\n\nOr they are huge fools for earning this level of mockery. I'll make Biron suffer before I go, if only I'd have known how deeply he was in love sooner! How I would make him flatter me, look for me and beg to have me, and wait until the moment that I want and do what seems right to me. I would force his incredible wit to make-up pointless rhymes for me, and would shape him to be just like I want him to be and make him proud to be the object of my jokes! So I would rule over him with my better hand, so that he would be my fool and I would control his fate.\n\nBOYET\n\nUnder the cool shade of a sycamore I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour; When, lo! to interrupt my purposed rest, Toward that shade I might behold addrest The king and his companions: warily I stole into a neighbour thicket by, And overheard what you shall overhear, That, by and by, disguised they will be here. Their herald is a pretty knavish page, That well by heart hath conn'd his embassage: Action and accent did they teach him there; 'Thus must thou speak,' and 'thus thy body bear:' And ever and anon they made a doubt Presence majestical would put him out, 'For,' quoth the king, 'an angel shalt thou see; Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.' The boy replied, 'An angel is not evil; I should have fear'd her had she been a devil.' With that, all laugh'd and clapp'd him on the shoulder, Making the bold wag by their praises bolder: One rubb'd his elbow thus, and fleer'd and swore A better speech was never spoke before; Another, with his finger and his thumb, Cried, 'Via! we will do't, come what will come;' The third he caper'd, and cried, 'All goes well;' The fourth turn'd on the toe, and down he fell. With that, they all did tumble on the ground, With such a zealous laughter, so profound, That in this spleen ridiculous appears, To cheque their folly, passion's solemn tears.\n\nBOYET\n\nI was having a nap in the shade of a sycamore tree for half an hour, when suddenly, my nap was interrupted. I heard the King and his companions talking nearby and I carefully hid in a bush nearby, and heard them discussing what you will hear them tell you again in a minute; that they will be here soon, in disguise. Their messenger is a pretty dishonest attendant, who has learned his message off by heart, using the gestures and the vocal technique that they have taught him. They said to him, \"You must speak like this,\" and \"You must stand like this,\" and they kept worrying that the presence of you, your majesty might confuse him. The King said to him, \"For even though you are going to see an angel standing before you, don't be scared, but speak with courage!\" The boy replied, \"An angel isn't evil so why would I fear her? I would only fear her if she was a devil.\" At that remark they all laughed and patted him on the shoulder, becoming more brave by the minute and adding more and more of this bravery into their praises of you. One of them rubbed his elbow like this, and grinned and stated that he didn't think there had ever been a speech as good as theirs before. Another one of them snapped his fingers and cried, \"Come on! let's do it, no matter what happens.\" The third Lord did a little dance and cried, \"I hope everything goes well.\" The fourth tripped over himself and fell on the ground. At that moment, they all fell to the ground with him, cackling with such a strong laughter, so loud, that their merriment became ridiculous and the serious emotion of passion was forced to stop their silliness.\n\nPRINCESS\n\nWill they now? These men will be tested then. For ladies, we shall all wear masks, so that none of them will have the honor, even when they ask, to see our faces. Hang on Rosaline, you will wear this gift and then the King will flirt with you, thinking that you are me. Here, take this, my sweet, and give me yours, and Biron will also think that I am Rosaline. You two swap your presents too, so that your lovers will woo the wrong women, deceived by these exchanges.\n\nBIRON\n\nThis fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease, And utters it again when God doth please: He is wit's pedler, and retails his wares At wakes and wassails, meetings, markets, fairs; And we that sell by gross, the Lord doth know, Have not the grace to grace it with such show. This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve; Had he been Adam, he had tempted Eve; A' can carve too, and lisp: why, this is he That kiss'd his hand away in courtesy; This is the ape of form, monsieur the nice, That, when he plays at tables, chides the dice In honourable terms: nay, he can sing A mean most meanly; and in ushering Mend him who can: the ladies call him sweet; The stairs, as he treads on them, kiss his feet: This is the flower that smiles on every one, To show his teeth as white as whale's bone; And consciences, that will not die in debt, Pay him the due of honey-tongued Boyet.\n\nBIRON\n\nThis man eats up our wit, like a pigeon pea, and speaks the same line again when the time is right. He is a seller of wit, and makes his money at festivals and parties, meetings, markets and fairs. People like him, who sell wit in large quantities, the Lord knows they don't have the ability to put on a performance like we can. He has complete power over women; if he had been Adam it would have been him who would have tempted Eve, not the other way around. He can also fail to deliver and stutter on his words. The same person who wore his hand out by kissing it so much is also a very polite man, he's Mr Nice Guy. He's so nice that when he plays backgammon, he even tells the dice off politely. He can sing a tenor role fairly well, and when acting as an usher he lets anyone who he thinks can do better try it instead. The ladies call him sweet, and he has climbed up the social ladder easily. He smiles at everyone he sees, to prove that his teeth are as white as ivory; people with consciences, so as not to die in debt, pay him the honor of calling him \"Sweet speaking Boyet.\"\n\nBIRON\n\nThus pour the stars down plagues for perjury. Can any face of brass hold longer out? Here stand I, lady, dart thy skill at me; Bruise me with scorn, confound me with a flout; Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance; Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit; And I will wish thee never more to dance, Nor never more in Russian habit wait. O, never will I trust to speeches penn'd, Nor to the motion of a schoolboy's tongue, Nor never come in vizard to my friend, Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song! Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise, Three-piled hyperboles, spruce affectation, Figures pedantical; these summer-flies Have blown me full of maggot ostentation: I do forswear them; and I here protest, By this white glove;—how white the hand, God knows!— Henceforth my wooing mind shall be express'd In russet yeas and honest kersey noes: And, to begin, wench,—so God help me, la!— My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.\n\nBIRON\n\nTherefore do whatever you want to us for our lies. Can a shameless face like mine last much longer? I stand here, my lady, give me everything you've got. Hurt me with your scorn, destroy me with a joke, make your sharp wit go right through my stupidity. Cut me into pieces with your keen tongue and I will never again invite you to dance and never come to you in Russian clothing again. Oh I will never rely on speeches that we have written, or trust a boy to deliver them. I will never come to my lover wearing a mask, nor woo her with rhymes like the song of a blind harper. I will never use rich phrases, flattering and over-precise words, excessive exaggeration, smart affection, pedantic rhetorical devices. The flies that come out in summer have laid their eggs on me and made me a pretentious show-off. I give these things up and I promise by your white glove, how white your hand is who knows! From here on I shall only woo you in simple ways with honest, plain words. So to begin, wench, may God help me, aha! My love for you is strong, without a crack or a flaw.\n\nBIRON\n\nNeither of either; I remit both twain. I see the trick on't: here was a consent, Knowing aforehand of our merriment, To dash it like a Christmas comedy: Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight zany, Some mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some Dick, That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick To make my lady laugh when she's disposed, Told our intents before; which once disclosed, The ladies did change favours: and then we, Following the signs, woo'd but the sign of she. Now, to our perjury to add more terror, We are again forsworn, in will and error. Much upon this it is: and might not you.\n\nBIRON\n\nI'll have neither of them, I give up both of them. I see the trick you have played on us, knowing that we were coming here, you made a pact to ruin it like a Christmas comedy. It was some kind of tell-tale, a creep, a humble assistant, a gossip, a hanger-on, a fellow who looked old with wrinkles and knows how to make my lady laugh when she wants to be merry that told you of our plan. Once they knew the ladies swapped their gifts and then we, following these gifts, woo'ed the lady that wore them. Now, we have betrayed ourselves even more, and have again broken another oath, by doing this wrong. This is pretty much what has happened.\n\nFERDINAND\n\nHaving so little time left makes a person have to act quickly, and often in these final moments he decides the things that he has debated over for a long time. Even though the sad face of a child that has lost her father doesn't allow you to love, and marriage hardly seems like the first thing on your mind. Yet, since love was just getting started, don't let your sadness push it aside and ignore it, since it is just as important to cry for people we have lost, as it is to rejoice at people we have found.\n\nBIRON\n\nHonest plain words best pierce the ear of grief; And by these badges understand the king. For your fair sakes have we neglected time, Play'd foul play with our oaths: your beauty, ladies, Hath much deform'd us, fashioning our humours Even to the opposed end of our intents: And what in us hath seem'd ridiculous,— As love is full of unbefitting strains, All wanton as a child, skipping and vain, Form'd by the eye and therefore, like the eye, Full of strange shapes, of habits and of forms, Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll To every varied object in his glance: Which parti-coated presence of loose love Put on by us, if, in your heavenly eyes, Have misbecomed our oaths and gravities, Those heavenly eyes, that look into these faults, Suggested us to make. Therefore, ladies, Our love being yours, the error that love makes Is likewise yours: we to ourselves prove false, By being once false for ever to be true To those that make us both,—fair ladies, you: And even that falsehood, in itself a sin, Thus purifies itself and turns to grace.\n\nBIRON\n\nHonest, simple words are a better choice when someone is grieving, so I will try to explain to you what the King means. For you, my beautiful ladies, we didn't pay attention to time and we broke our oaths without thinking. Your beauty, ladies, has changed us, making us act in ways that we never expected. The things we have done seem ridiculous, because love makes people act in ridiculous ways, like a foolish child skipping around. Love is made by the eye, and so, like an eye, it is full of strange shapes, strange behavior and strange appearances, changing from one person to another, just like an eye looks from one thing to another. It was your heavenly eyes that led us to forget our oaths and promises in the first place, and for which we behaved in such a silly way, because we needed to love you. Therefore ladies, because our love belongs to you, you are partly to blame for the mistakes we have made. We too are liars, for going against one vow to try to make another vow for love, for you, our beautiful ladies. Even though we broke our vows, and that was a sin, we have redeemed ourselves and found our virtue again in you.\n\nPRINCESS\n\nA time, methinks, too short To make a world-without-end bargain in. No, no, my lord, your grace is perjured much, Full of dear guiltiness; and therefore this: If for my love, as there is no such cause, You will do aught, this shall you do for me: Your oath I will not trust; but go with speed To some forlorn and naked hermitage, Remote from all the pleasures of the world; There stay until the twelve celestial signs Have brought about the annual reckoning. If this austere insociable life Change not your offer made in heat of blood; If frosts and fasts, hard lodging and thin weeds Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love, But that it bear this trial and last love; Then, at the expiration of the year, Come challenge me, challenge me by these deserts, And, by this virgin palm now kissing thine I will be thine; and till that instant shut My woeful self up in a mourning house, Raining the tears of lamentation For the remembrance of my father's death. If this thou do deny, let our hands part, Neither entitled in the other's heart.\n\nPRINCESS\n\nThis time is too short to make a decision which is going to last forever. No, no my lord, you have broken your oath and are now full of guilt. I will say this though, if you will do anything for my love, though I don't see why you would, then do this for me. I won't trust your oath, but go quickly to some abandoned and unfurnished place, far away from all the pleasures of this world and stay there until a year has gone by and you have made up for what you have done. If this difficult and lonely lifestyle doesn't change the loving offer you have just made me; if the cold and the lack of food, difficult conditions and bad clothes doesn't stop your love from growing, then come and find me at the end of this year, and show me that your love has stayed strong. Come and find me to get what you deserve to have, and by the hand I now kiss, I will be yours. Until then I am going to hide myself away in mourning and weep and cry about the death of my father. If you can't agree to this, let's leave it now, and agree to never be together.\n\nROSALINE\n\nOft have I heard of you, my Lord Biron, Before I saw you; and the world's large tongue Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks, Full of comparisons and wounding flouts, Which you on all estates will execute That lie within the mercy of your wit. To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain, And therewithal to win me, if you please, Without the which I am not to be won, You shall this twelvemonth term from day to day Visit the speechless sick and still converse With groaning wretches; and your task shall be, With all the fierce endeavor of your wit To enforce the pained impotent to smile.\n\nROSALINE\n\nI have heard a lot about you, my Lord Biron, and before I met you, all I knew is what I had heard from rumors and stories. People say that you are a man who always mocks people, you are full of satire and hurtful jokes which you use on everyone you meet to destroy them with your wit. To get rid of this bitterness from your clever mind, and in doing so to win me, if that's what you want, as there is no other way we will be together, you must spend the next year visiting mutes and sick people and speak with ill women. Your task is to use all of the power of your wit to try to make helpless and weak people laugh.\n\nROSALINE\n\nWhy, that's the way to choke a gibing spirit, Whose influence is begot of that loose grace Which shallow laughing hearers give to fools: A jest's prosperity lies in the ear Of him that hears it, never in the tongue Of him that makes it: then, if sickly ears, Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans, Will hear your idle scorns, continue then, And I will have you and that fault withal; But if they will not, throw away that spirit, And I shall find you empty of that fault, Right joyful of your reformation.\n\nROSALINE\n\nWhy, that's how to get rid of your sarcastic nature, which seems to have the same charm as people imagine fools to have. The success of a joke comes with how people hear it, not in how the person says it. So, if sick ears, so fed up of the sounds of their own awful groans, will listen to your pointless jokes, carry on and you will win my love, jokes and all. But if they won't listen to you, then get rid of your sarcasm, and I will think you have been cured and be pleased about how you have changed.\n\nDON ADRIANO DE ARMADO\n\nSPRING.
