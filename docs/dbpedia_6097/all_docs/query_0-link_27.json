        "text": "I’ve seen a few movies lately. Let’s start with the good ones.\n\nLooper\n\nI heard about this in reviews of Time Before Time, since they both feature time travel run by criminals. I think TBT did a better job, but it had more time to develop the idea.\n\nThe main sf idea is kind of a big pill to swallow: in 2074, the mafia needs to dispose of bodies, but it’s a hassle because tracking systems are too good. But they have time travel, so they send victims back in time, where they’re met by a dude who shoots them.\n\nTBT’s hook is way better. But never mind that for now.\n\nAnyway, our man Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a looper, one of these shooter dudes. This is not easy to sympathize with, but he does find himself in an interesting predicament. You see, sometimes the guy sent back in time for a looper to kill is himself. This comes with an extra payment and extra angst. Oh, and this is kind of a spoiler only it’s pretty much given away in the movie poster: this happens to Joe. More shockingly, it turns out Future Joe is Bruce Willis.\n\nI won’t detail the plot, but I’ll highlight a couple things: Jeff Daniels finds a nice new way to play the local mafia boss, a perfect blend of mellow and sinister. The time gap is used in a clever way that makes a hash of causality but it’s used consistently and pays off at the end. The movie is hyperviolent, but it’s enjoyable.\n\nThe premise bugs me the more I think about it, though. 1) Since time is malleable, can the mafia really not think of any other way to use time travel? 2) That really good body tracking never notices that the bodies disappear? 3) It really seems like the procedure has holes in it; indeed, the plot shows this happening twice. But heck, it’s just a setup for the story.\n\nNimona\n\nI read the graphic novel and liked it a lot, and the animated movie looked fun. And it is. Like the comic, the first half is probably the best, as Nimona meets Ballister– here renamed Boldheart instead of Blackheart– and turns his attempts at stealth into a riot of chaos and shapeshifting.\n\nThe plot has been considerably altered… it still centers on the supposedly good Knights, led by Ambrosius Goldenloin, who are still secretly evil, but it’s been streamlined. Curiously the hint that Ballister and Ambrosius were lovers is played up rather than dimmed.\n\nMy one complaint, I think, is that Ballister is turned into something of a nebbish. Both versions are gothic loners, but in the book Ballister seemed like more of an antihero and seemed reasonably competent. The odd-couple comedy still works, but he does feel diminished. They’ve nailed Nimona, though.\n\nI liked the animation a lot– they really had a blast with Nimona’s shapeshifting, and they didn’t make it boringly realistic or CGI-looking.\n\nBounced off these though\n\nI started a couple of movies on Netflix that I couldn’t finish, though everyone else seems to like them.\n\nOne was The Suicide Squad— the 2021 one, which is supposed to be the good one. I enjoyed the first half hour or so: there’s a lot of good banter, and the characters were interesting. Then the squad dramatically kills an entire camp of soldiers they think is keeping one of their members captive. Only it turns out these guys actually rescued their guy, and this is played for laughs.\n\nI get the idea of the squad, and I get that this is cartoon violence… I just couldn’t get past the fact that the filmmakers thought this situation was hilarious.\n\nThe other film was Wonder Woman (2017), which I bounced off of for the opposite reason. The initial scenes are just so damn sappy. I dunno, the whole Amazonian origin doesn’t work for me– it was the weakest part of the comics, too. Utopias are really hard to do, and the whole trope of “these people have Figured It Out and ordinary humans haven’t” is never very deep, usually because the writers’ ideas of what’s wrong with ordinary humans are so shallow.\n\nI’ve only seen a few superhero movies, and I think, well, I’m not the target audience. No judgment if you are. I can enjoy superhero comics, in moderation, but I can take a way larger dose of fantasy in comics form. In movie form, the artificiality and repetition are too much. It’s characters made so overpowered that they have to be given absurd enemies to make a story at all.\n\nOh, and we saw a movie in a theater recently. I think I’ll quietly suppress the name, because neither of us liked it much, and we met the director, so I feel bad giving it a poor review. It’s a Peruvian film, set in the early 1800s, retelling the life of a writer and activist. It’s beautifully shot, has some great material, but it’s an example, I think, of the writer concentrating on precisely the wrong stuff. 2/3 of the movie is about things that ultimately have nothing to do with what she became famous for. Plus, the movie could be a poster child for telling-not-showing. Most of the characters react to the heroine as if she was obviously, immediately captivating and charismatic. And she’s just not shown being that.\n\nNow, maybe making an enlivening film about a writer and activist is tricky… how do you dramatize that? I think the writer figured that exploring her origins and throwing in some romances would do it. But it explains nothing and, when you finally get to her career, there’ no time or energy to do it justice.\n\nFor some reason Youtube kept serving me slices of Colombiana, a 2011 crime & revenge thriller written by Luc Besson and starring Zoe Saldaña. Finally it came to Netflix and I watched the whole thing. I just read a bunch of reviews and wow, it gets mixed reactions. But I enjoyed it, mostly for its over-the-top action sequences. And Zoe Saldaña.\n\nApparently Besson wanted to write a sequel to Léon: The Professional but quarreled with the film company, and wrote this instead. 10-year-old Cataleya watches her minor gangster father and his mother murdered in front of her. She escapes– by the stratagem of pinning the murderer’s hand to a table with a knife– and makes her way to the American Embassy. Her father had given her a computer chip which he says is her passport, and it is– she’s flown to the US. She eludes the feds and finds her uncle, declaring she wants to be a killer.\n\nAnd she does! She grows up to be Zoe Saldaña and spends the rest of the movie taking her revenge. As it happens, I saw most of the good action sequences as Youtube clips; as it also happens, there’s really not much more than those sequences. That is, the non-action parts are kept to a minimum. At root it’s a bunch of bits where Zoe kills a bunch of bad guys who deserve it, showcasing not only her Catwoman-style grace, but an uncanny ability to stay several steps ahead. This is a woman who knows all about Chekhov’s gun, and in fact stashes several copies of it for where she might need them.\n\n(Does everyone still know that trope? Chekhov is famous for saying that if you see a gun in the first scene, it should be used by the end of the story. Besson for sure learned that lesson. Everything here is set up first and pays off later.)\n\nIs this deep? No, and the people who don’t like it complain mostly about the plot and the contrivances… this in a world where the top grossing movies are about men and women in spandex with magic powers. I think it helps to think of this as a Catwoman flick. For instance: Cataleya gets herself thrown in jail; then, late at night, goes through the vents to kill one of her targets. And to do this she changes into a catsuit, which she’s thoughtfully hidden in her hair. This is a trope that goes back more than a hundred years, and it makes no sense at all. If catsuits made sense for thievery, actual thieves would wear them, male and female. They’re restrictive, offer no protection, and make it hard to pee– jeans and a T-shirt would make more sense. But they look great on a beautiful woman and they scream “spy/assassin”, so who cares?\n\nOn the other hand, there’s a scene toward the end where Cataleya faces off against Mr. Murderer (Jordi Molla). They have run out of bullets and have to fight hand to hand, improvising weapons. As action, it’s fine, but what I liked about the scene was how un-superpowered it was. They look desperate and exhausted– a nice touch.\n\nI also like Molla’s approach to the character. He’s a brutal thug, but he almost never raises his voice, and his hallmark is approaching Cataleya, both times he meets her, with a twinge of sympathy. There’s also a moment where Cataleya has unexpectedly gunned down a bunch of his mooks, and Molla just sighs. It’s been a bad day and it’s getting worse. It makes him one of the best #2 guys in movies. (Certainly better then his #1, who’s every stereotypical Latino gang leader.)\n\nOne reason I liked it, probably, is that I don’t see that many movies any more. One thing that I think isn’t widely recognized: you have to see a certain amount of a genre before you like it; but if you see too much of it you’ll dislike 90% of what you see. If you’ve seen hundreds of action flicks, the accumulated tropes are annoying rather than amusing, and you start to laser-focus on flaws. But I like a good action sequence and I respect the pared-down nature of Besson’s script. There’s very little padding: it sets things up, moves from action to action, and doesn’t add complications just to add screen time.\n\nI was looking at Netflix to find something not very heavy, and I did: Green Snake, a Chinese animated movie. Netflix describes it thus: “While trying to free her sister from Fahai’s clutches, Xiao Qing winds up in a dystopian city and meets a mysterious man who can’t recall his past life.”\n\nAll true enough, except that the subtitles call her Verta. In fact she’s 小青 ‘little green’ and the movie is properly 白蛇二：青蛇劫起 “White Snake 2: Trials of the Green Snake.” But we’ll get into that later.\n\nThe movie begins in medias res: two girls, Verta and Blanca, for some reason fight against a Buddhist monk, Fahai, in Song China (i.e. a thousand years ago) He is vastly more powerful, and traps Blanca. When Verta tries to fight back she is banished to another realm, Ashuraville.\n\nThis is the dystopian city of the Netflix description, and at first it looks like it’s going to be a post-apocalyptic movie. She meets the mysterious man, but more important is another new friend, Sun, a girl who teaches her about the important bits of the modern world: computers, guns, and motorcycles. But Sun’s compound is attacked by monsters, and Sun is killed. However, Verta finds new allies. (Verta has lost her magic powers, but she is still preternaturally fast and good at fighting… like pretty much everyone in a Chinese adventure movie.)\n\nVerta soon learns that Ashuraville is some sort of spiritual limbo, inhabited by humans, demons, animal spirits, and monsters, divided into warring gangs. (One faction is called “rakshas”, presumably an attempt at the rakshasas of Indian lore.) They are all spiritual misfits, trapped in the city because they can’t let go of their particular obsession. Oh, and there are kalpas, events where spirits attack everyone regardless of gang affiliation. Verta’s obesssion is clear: she wants to save her sister Blanca from the monk.\n\nNow, I rather liked all of this. It’s messing with mythology, which could be questionable if a Western studio did it– but the Chinese can of course mess with their own mythology. And this mythological plane works pretty well as a crumbling modernist city… anything goes when you’re depicting other realms of being. (Who has the standing to complain that a spiritual limbo isn’t authentic enough?) The action and the frequent fights are fun, Verta is appealing, and I never quite knew where things were going. It’s an adventure flick so it’s not going to be deep, but I appreciate that it owes very little to Tolkien and Lucas and Martin. It’s also refreshing that it has a female protagonist who never gives up, and is defined mostly by her relationship with her sister.\n\nEventually we know, or realize, that Verta and Blanca are demons– in particular, snake demons. But this is kind of a democratic free-for-all sort of spiritual world, not the strict binary of most Western fantasy. Still, there’s a certain tension here: is Fahai in fact the good guy, and the sisters the villains? It doesn’t lean into that direction, but Verta’s character arc definitely touches on what side you are on and who your real friends are.\n\nThe characters are maybe underdeveloped by American tastes. We like our adventure flicks to be full of lovable characters, who quip and quibble until they all bond when fighting the big bad, who probably has a tragic backstory. This movie doesn’t quite fit that; it relies much more heavily on character types. E.g. the mysterious man is nice enough, but it’s obvious that he’s there to fulfill a certain role.\n\nAfter finishing the movie I wanted to know more, so I looked into the film and its folklore. First, it’s a sequel, made in 2021– the first movie, from 2019, is called White Snake and focuses on Bianca and her romance with a human, Xuan.\n\nSecond, and this should be no surprise, the film is based on an ancient legend, 白蛇传 Báishé chuán (Story of the White Snake). It has, of course, been turned into various Chinese operas and no less than 16 films. Apparently it was originally the story of an evil demon, but then turned into a love story between the snake demon (disguised as a beautiful woman) and the human Xu Xian. Fahai is definitely evil, trying to destroy their relationship.\n\nRecently, for some reason, I recalled that William Goldman has written a couple books on his career as a scriptwriter and novelist, and I thought I’d like some of that in my life. So I just read Which Lie Did I Tell? : More Adventures in the Screen Trade (2000). Yes, I started with the second book, because that’s what the library had.\n\nNo one really pays attention to screenwriters who aren’t also directors or actors, so I’d better say who he is. Among other things he wrote The Princess Bride, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Stepford Wives, Marathon Man, All the President’s Men, Misery, A Bridge Too Far, Maverick. He’s also been a script doctor on films including Indecent Proposal, Good Will Hunting, and A Few Good Men. Two Oscars for screenwriting. Oh, and he’s dead.\n\nIf you’re my age, and you’re not, you’ll at least recognize most of these, and admire his range. If you’re younger, you’ll probably be most interested in Princess Bride (he also wrote the novel), and there’s a chapter on it in this book. Not surprisingly, that and Butch are his favorites.\n\nSo how’s the book? Well, if you like movies, it’s like candy. Getting a glimpse behind the scenes is fun, there are some insights on writing and on screenwriting, and he has an amiable, chatty persona. He’s fairly cynical about the movie biz, but he obviously loves movies and is pretty happy with his career. He loves almost all the stars he describes, perhaps for contractual reasons.\n\nThe most entertaining stories, perhaps, are the ones about failure. He had a couple of flops, or unproduced movies, and he tells you all about those. Here he can be a little more honest about those stars. E.g. he notes that when a star reads a script, the changes he wants are always to beef up his character and make them more loveable… which sometimes ruins the movie.\n\nWill you learn a lot about screenwriting? Maybe, maybe not. Apparently his first memoir began “Nobody knows anything.” He’s kind of passionate about what works and what doesn’t in movies, but I’d take that with a grain of salt– though he has impressive range, he does tend to specialize in action flicks with male stars, he appreciates art films and comedies but admits he can’t write them, and sometimes the most unlikely material just takes off due to its quirkiness or an actor you can’t keep your eyes off.\n\nA cute tidbit: he finds it easy to analyze what’s wrong with someone else’s script… can’t do it with his own. He says he writes in an intuitive way, so if he can’t feel his way to an ending, he’s stuck.\n\nIt’s also curious that to write a movie, he more or less has to fall in love with the material. Sometimes the movie works in spite of this rather than because of it. E.g. he fell in love with the Butch/Sundance Kid material… and he made it work, but honestly reading the facts on the page it’s hard to see what he saw in it. (“Two crooks down on their luck hide from a posse by fleeing the country.”) Another of his movies is about a series of lion attacks which held up the construction of a colonial railway. Yawn. Maybe it could be remade today with the lions as the heroes.)\n\nAnother: he’s mildly pissed off because directors and actors get all the attention. E.g. he discusses the plane attacking Cary Grant in the cornfields, from North By Northwest. Everyone credits Hitchcock, but the scene was written by a writer, a guy named Ernest Lehman.\n\nOn the other hand, he also provides the script for the orgasm scene in When Harry Met Sally. And… I dunno, it’s underwhelming on the page. I just watched a clip of it, and sorry, Bill (his friends call him Bill), but what makes the scene work is Meg Ryan’s acting chops. (OK, and admittedly, the great line at the end.)\n\nHe notes that to make a film work, a bunch of people have to be at the top of their game: the writer, the director, the actors, the production manager. Er, and a few more. So, lots of points of failure; no wonder so many movies suck. And a marvel that so many actually do work.\n\nOne of the more interesting bits is a half-written script of his, plus comments from half a dozen colleagues on how to fix it. It’s pretty interesting to hear professionals find the problems and how to fix them. Curiously he could have saved a lot of time if he’d remembered one of his own adages: movies don’t deal well with long jumps in time. His script depends on a bunch of years passing and one character changing unrecognizably during that time, and it’s hard to make that work. (Counter-example: the aging montage in Up. Counter-counter: that scene kind of lessens the rest of the movie.)\n\nI should add that Goldman is a man of his times, and he was born in 1931. He has some old-curmudgeon pages where he thinks movies have gone downhill. And I dunno, maybe they have, I haven’t been keeping up. But isn’t he smart enough to know that old curmudgeons always say stuff like that, and are always wrong? Plus, dwelling on the classic movies, everyone forgets how many stinkers Hollywood has put out.\n\nAnyway, it’s a great book to keep on your bedside table and dip into before sleeping. Not deep, but always fun to read.\n\nWe just finished watching Wednesday, though we did it on Saturdays. It still works.\n\nThis is of course the Netflix TV show, which updates the movie, which updates the ’60s TV show, which updates the ’50s Charles Addams cartoons. That’s a lot of transformations, and I’m leaving out some (the ones I never saw).\n\nI used to watch the TV show when I was a kid– it was already in re-runs. My wife prefers The Munsters, but I liked Addams Family. Both shows had the metajoke that the monster family is actually perfectly benign– if there’s any villainy it’s due to the ‘normal’ people outside. This is actually pretty sophisticated for an era where the typical TV comedy involved a talking horse or a heartwarming sheriff or both.\n\nThe 1991 movie went back to the far more impish cartoons. These roughly fall into two categories:\n\nJokes where the family is just being goth, or reversing normie values:\n\nGrandmama telling a story: “Then the dragon gobbled up the handsome young prince and lived happily ever after”\n\n“Are you unhappy, darling?” “Oh, yes, yes! Completely!”\n\nThe children get a giant iguana as a pet\n\nGomez makes a torture rack with his kids, explaining it’s more fun to make it yourself\n\nLurch serves a two-headed pig for dinner\n\nAnd jokes where the family is hinted as actually being murderous:\n\nFester releasing a hawk while neighbors release pigeons\n\nMorticia borrows cyanide from the neighboring witch\n\nPuggsley has bricked up Wednesday in the furnace\n\nThe family drops boiling oil on carolers\n\nAddams never actually showed the actual murders, and there were never any consequences– Wednesday was evidently not burned up, and just reappears in the next cartoon. This shtick is similar to his cartoon about a patent attorney trying out a client’s invention: “Death ray, fiddlesticks! Why, it doesn’t even slow them up!”\n\nThis grimmer humor is echoed in the ’90s movies, though those are still mostly about normies attempting to swindle the Addamses.\n\nNow to the Netflix show Wednesday, which as you may know focuses on Wednesday. She’s now about 16, and she’s sent to a boarding school, Nevermore, which her parents went to decades ago. It’s built next to a very normie town, Jericho, whose main attracton is called Pilgrim World. Nevermore is intended as a school for “outcasts”, including werewolves, sirens, gorgons, psychics, and vampires. (None of the previous versions of the story leaned quite so hard into the supernatural.)\n\nWednesday is for some reason on the outs with her parents, and initially has trouble fitting into the school. But her attention is drawn by a murder mystery– there’s a monster murdering outcasts and normies alike– and she takes eight episodes to solve the mystery, make some friends, alienate said friends, and then realize at the end that she needs them.\n\nAll of this depends heavily on Wednesday the character, and her actor– fortunately this is Jenna Ortega, who does an amazing job.\n\nWednesday is a carefully balanced fantasy concoction. The character is so antisocial that she’s basically an antihero; but as in (say) Sin City, the narrative trick is to pit her against even worse villains. Then, for comic relief, you contrast her with likeable people who just want to get to know her: her bouncy colorful roommate Enid, the nice normie boy at the coffee shop Tyler, the appropriately goth artist Xavier. Plus a bunch of other relationships that go up and down as the plot dictates– with her parents, with the grumpy local sheriff, with the imperious principal.\n\nI saw an interview with Christina Ricci (the 1991 Wednesday, and a Nevermore teacher in this version) where she praises this Wednesday as, more or less, a feminist superhero. She does what she wants, she refuses to let anyone put her down or stop her, she doesn’t give a fuck about traditional femininity or who disapproves of her. She is smart, witty, plays a mean cello, dances like no one is watching, and duels expertly with the rapier.\n\nAll true, but she also has the ability of the antihero to say and do things that the rest of us can’t– or that we’ll regret if we do. E.g. the series begins when she attacks the boys who have bullied her brother with piranhas. It’s so over the top that it’s more comic than horrible, but really, hasn’t anyone who’s been bullied wished they could fight back that way?\n\nWednesday: I know I’m stubborn, single-minded, and obsessive. But those are all traits of great writers.\n\n(Thing makes a gesture)\n\nWednesday: Yes, and serial killers.\n\nMorticia: We are not the ones who got you expelled. That boy’s family was going to file attempted murder charges. How would that have looked on your record?\n\nWednesday: Terrible. Everyone would know I failed to get the job done.\n\nOne of the characters calls her toxic, and on one level she is. She doesn’t have the psychopath’s or narcissist’s ability to be charming on demand. On the other hand– just like the cartoons– she is more bad attitude than bad behavior. E.g. when she starts hanging out with Eugene, the dweeby bee boy, she is dismissive as usual; but when he’s injured she regularly visits him in the hospital.\n\nAnd honestly, the series leans hard into Wednesday being a teenage girl– far shorter than most of her antagonists, and disarmingly beautiful. Imagine a gender-reversed show called Puggsley. Would a story about a toxic male teenager be nearly as compelling? I think we’ve had all too many of those.\n\nAs many reviews have noted, Ortega rises over the limitations of her monotone and her perpetual unblinking scowl. There are moments of surprise, alarm, and concern… even a few moments of real joy.\n\nA couple more performances stand out. Emma Myers would be too saccharine in a normal story, but she’s the perfect complement to Wednesday, and the sweetest moment in the story belongs to her and Wednesday. Victor Dorobantu only appears as a disembodied hand, but he’s perhaps the most winning character in the series. I liked Joy Sunday as the mean girl who has a change of heart of her own. Hunter Doohan as Tyler is kind of trapped playing a character on loan from a normal teen movie, but he does a good job anyway.\n\nGwendoline Christie plays Principal Weems, and she nails the surface politeness and underlying menace that she should have had as Lucifer in Sandman. I really wonder what happened there– she was stiff and not scary at all. She does great here.\n\nThere were a couple bits that didn’t quite make sense, but I can forgive them because the whole is executed so surely, and it ends well. They give Wednesday no less than three possible love interests, and the plot has to go into convolutions to make them move forward. I like the mystery angle, but also think it doesn’t quite work as a mystery, because it’s mostly a dance to keep everyone a possible suspect as long as possible. Some of the most fun bits of the show are actually unconnected to the plot: Wednesday’s cello solos, the canoe race, the school dance.\n\nThe show has been renewed, and I hope they can continue the magic. It’s going to be trickier than it sounds, because they’re probably going to have to undo some of the high note the first season ended on; and it’ll be frustrating if they undo Wednesday’s character arc.\n\nApparently the show has been very popular, which raises the question: why do normies like it? My guess is that it’s taken in different ways by different audiences. Anyone who feels alienated or oppressed can see themselves in Wednesday, or in the outcasts. But more mainstream audiences can take it as whimsical not-really-horror, like most of Tim Burton’s other work.\n\nIt’s weird for me to watch and review a TV show that’s on now, but it’s on Netflix, so here we are.\n\nI had pretty mixed feelings about the game Cyberpunk 2077; the anime by contrast is pretty good. In fact I feel like this would have been a much better direction for the game itself.\n\nI’m not going to be entirely rapturous, but mostly because I’m not 17 anymore. If you are 17 and read my blog for some reason, no disrepect, this series was made for you and you may find it absolutely cool. It’s basically a heavy metal ballad: live fast, aim high, fuck the bastards and die in glory.\n\nIf you’ve been living in a cave or something, here’s the basics: the series is 10 episodes of half an hour each, focusing on David Martinez, a smart but poor boy living in Night City in 2076, studying to be a corpo. Ep 1 gives you a heady brew of cyberpunk: it starts with a braindance of a guy going cyberpsycho, killing a bunch of cops; we meet David’s hard-working mother, see David’s morose everyday life; he also knows a ripperdoc for some reason; the rich kids at school are bullying him; then life gets even worse. Everything costs money in Night City and when you have none, no one cares. You may play the game and want to live in Night City. Watching the anime, not so much. Kids, only you can prevent libertarianism.\n\nThings pick up in Ep 2 when he meets Lucy, a girl way cooler than him who is nonetheless wasting time stealing chips from corpos on the el. David has recently acquired his first chrome, which allows him (among other things) to move superhumanly fast; it turns out he also has an unusual ability to integrate cyberware with his wetware (his big floppy meat brain). Lucy introduces him to a rising gang of mercs, who don’t like him much at first.\n\nNow, C77 has a sequence of Movin’ Up with Jackie, where you rise from total noob to minor gangster in a five-minute montage. And that’s pretty much what eps 1 to 6 amount to…. and it just underlines the huge wasted opportunity in C77. The game doesn’t really get going until you’re already well established, with your own apartment. It skips what Edgerunners revels in: how easy is to fall out of the grid in Night City, the hopelessness of having nothing and no prospects, the slow climb up the crime ladder because that’s the only exit; slowly acquiring and getting to know your new crew, a la Saints Row.\n\nIn short, I would have watched twice as much David & Lucy on the rise (the interval between Eps 6 and 7, basically), and I would have played the hell out of that as a video game. Instead C77 gives you fucking Keanu.\n\nAt the same time, I’ve been watching Cowboy Bebop for the first time– both versions. They’re very similar: cyberpunk dystopia, lots of violence, heists gone bad, a simmering feud with a vicious enemy, a crew of loveable fuckups. More on this later, but a lot of the comparisons go Bebop‘s way. The characters in Bebop are more likeable, the stories and themes show far more range, and there’s a lot more actual sf going on. I understand that Edgerunners is just focused on doing one thing, and it does that pretty well. But Bebop is the more ambitious show, and it did all this 24 years ago.\n\nThe one thing Edgerunners has going for it is the animation. It’s not perfect– yeah, Studio Trigger, I can tell when you’re saving money– but it’s better, very stylish, and often innovative. (E.g. David’s superspeed is represented by multiple still images… that can’t be what it would actually look like, but it’s a perfect use of the medium.) So, Studio Trigger, please just re-animate Cowboy Bebop, leaving the soundtrack as is, mmkay?\n\nBoth game and anime are all about the ultraviolence. I’m guessing that that’s how the RPG plays too. It still disappoints me a bit because I want the cyber stuff: hacking, detecting, stealth, inscrutable graphics representing the inside of the Net. Otherwise it’s just a gang story where the guns are just, you know, surgically installed in your arm.\n\nNow, while you’re watching, almost everything is cool and exciting– you can just let it all wash over you. But very little of it makes much sense on analysis. The TV Tropes name for this is fridge logic: stuff that you accept until half an hour later when you go to the fridge for snacks. The characters intelligence and skill level varies widely, according to plot needs. Enemy capabilities very even more widely: same. Character chooses to lie or clam up or reveal secrets: same. You can never tell who’s going to have a badass movement and who’s going to fuck up. (Bebop has this problem too.)\n\nNow, some of this is probably intentional: it’s a tragedy, after all: people have to make mistakes and miscommunicate; they’re all damaged people; it’s a biz that encourages a certain reckless bravado. On the other hand, I think it kind of ruins the last two episodes, admittedly a point where they have to cram in a huge amount of plot. Specifically (mouse over to read):\n\nLucy is cool and calculating except when she needs to get captured. David’s new suit can blast through an entire military battalion, but he’s overcome by one guy in a mecha suit. Rebecca can blow up everything until she can’t. Kiwi does a heel turn, then a reverse heel turn, then gets played as a sucker. Arasaka has spent a fortune on this new cyberskeleton instead of just building more Adam Smashers. There is never a shortage of ammo and implants, but you can easily run out of immunosuppressants.\n\nI’m going to show another scene which is a bit of a spoiler but reveals a lot about the show’s attitudes, positive and negative:\n\nDavid is obviously a male power fantasy here, to the point of absurdity. And that’s OK, that’s the story they wanted to tell, and it’s told with a certain self-criticism, or typical Slavic pessimism: this is not a path that leads to a long happy life. It’s lampshaded early on: cyberpunk is about how you die.\n\nLucy is also part of the male fantasy. She is and remains cooler than David– on the whole Edgerunners is pretty good about making its female characters badasses– but she falls for him anyway. Also for some reason female hackers get naked while hacking. And while hanging out at home, apparently. (David does too. Saves on laundry bills, I guess.)\n\nNow, I’m not criticizing Lucy, or the romance– quite the opposite, it’s the one element of sweetness in the story, and a very welcome one. But I do want to ask: why didn’t the writers consider telling Lucy’s story instead? It’s arguably way more interesting. They tell some of it: she started out poor as well, and got trained and nearly killed by Arasaka. Yet she became a very successful hacker, chill and smart and kind and never subject to cyberpsychosis, and she never felt the need for David’s gorilla-grade bulk. It’s the Ginger Rogers thing: she did everything Fred Astaire did, only backwards and in high heels.\n\nIf you want to see that idea taken through its paces– try Arcane, the animated show based very loosely on League of Legends. I’m not sure I’ll do a full review, but it also covers a lot of this ground, though with more a steampunk than a cyberpunk vibe. But it makes the smart decision to focus on the female badasses rather than the male wannabes they inexplicably fall in love with.\n\nIn a departure from my usual unhipness, I’ve been streaming TV shows like a normal human being. I picked up Netflix in order to watch Sandman. It’s only $15 a month!\n\nQuick verdict: it’s great; I’m really hoping now for Season Two. It does justice to the comics. And best of all, my wife likes it, and she is not a big fantasy fan. We just finished the last, bonus episode last night.\n\nTo make something like this work, both the casting and the writing have to hit. They scored big with all the ones they really had to: Dream (Tom Sturridge), Death (Kirby Howell-Baptiste), Lucienne (Vivienne Acheampong), John Dee (David Thewlis), and the Corinthian (Boyd Holbrook). I heard part of the audiobook adaptation and couldn’t buy Dream and Death there, so this is big.\n\nDream is the most challenging of these: he’s perfectly suited for the comics page, where we only have to see his gothic splendor. But most of the comics images (e.g. those starry non-eyes, or the over-flowing robes) would look campy on-screen. Plus– his whole thing is that he’s uptight and a bit of an asshole. Sturridge is just right for all this (once you get used to his prettiness). I was worried at first that he was under-emoting, but I think he does a lot very subtly.\n\nGaiman, and the directors, take the point of view that enormously powerful entities (Sandman, Lucifer, Corinthian) can be calm and elaborately polite. The shouting madman as villain is real, but always conceals an underlying fear, a fear that he will not be taken seriously. The truly powerful person can be quiet because they know their orders will be fulfilled. Sturridge is the positive side of this: a guy where you should worry if he furrows his brow. Holbrook is the evil version, underlining his menace with Southern charm.\n\nDeath is Gaiman’s most perfect, most iconic character, and Howell-Baptiste nails her. She is warm and caring and yet catpures that older-sister ability to make Dream think.\n\nThe set design is good. I like touches like Matthew flying into the ceiling of Dream’s throne room, the painting turning into a 3-D scene; then ending up in Earth’s sky. It’s a nice use of the new medium: comics can show us amazing spaces, but it’s not good at transitions.\n\nThe usual trolls have complained about changes in race and sex. As Gaiman has gleefully pointed out, these folks entirely missed the point of the comics, where it was shown many times that the Endless are shown as they appear to the being observing them, be it human, cat, or alien sentient flower. Even Abel and Cain note that they are not actually human. But the comics, progressive for their time, feel a bit dated in their whiteness, and I’m glad they’ve been updated. The only one that I feel doesn’t quite work is Lucifer. Gwendoline Christie gets the surface suavity and politeness, but not the menace. And there’s something oddly stiff about her bearing, as if she’s being held up by her gowns.\n\nI looked at a few reviews and found them quite weird– I suspect the reviewers a) see too much TV, and b) lack an affinity for the material. I haven’t seen much TV in years, and that probably improves the experience for me. The show isn’t lost in a sea of other fantasy/sf adaptations for me; I’m not bored by the tropes or the actors. E.g. one reviewer thought some episodes were “padded”, which is a weird thing to say when they’re rushing through like 15 comics in 10 hours. Another said Kyo Ra wasn’t that great; I disagree, though my wife didn’t.\n\nSome things hit harder in a live-action version. The horrific abuse of Jed, for instance. It’s almost all taken straight from the comics, but it’s a lot more visceral when you see an actual human being as evil as Barnaby.\n\nI’m going to talk about specific scenes and changes now, so I suggest you put this aside if you’re afraid of spoilers.\n\nA lot of reviews seem to think this was a very tight adaptation. Parts of it are (especially the “cereal convention” bits), but there are quite a few little changes. E.g.:\n\nThe nods to DC heroes are gone.\n\nPoor Gregory!\n\nLyta is now just a friend of Rose’s, not a resident of the Dream Dome. She’s also a sweet helper rather than merely depressive.\n\nEthel doesn’t run away with Ruthven Sykes.\n\nMatthew appears earlier, and his predecessor Jessamy appears in ep 1; it’s rather a shock that Alex kills her.\n\nAlex was relatively trusted in the comics; here he is abused and disdained.\n\nThe Corinthian’s role is greatly beefed up. He instructs Burgess on how to keep Dream safe, and rescues Jed from his horrible foster parents. He interacts with Rose, giving her more options (why not take over the Dreaming?!).\n\nJohanna Constantine gets a whole subplot to show off her powers; and another one to make her relationship to Rachel far more poignant. (Also, wow, she looks better in a trenchcoat than John ever did.)\n\nJohn Dee is quite changed. Rather than simply being a power-mad psychotic, he has a whole theme: an abhorrence of lies, due to the constant lying of his mother. His driver is blessed instead of murdered.\n\nBrute and Glob are gone, replaced by Gault, whose motivations are positive rather than negative.\n\nHell is no longer a triumvirate.\n\nDeath gives more of an explanation of why she is happy to do her job.\n\nBoth Rose and Hob get to show off some self-defense skills.\n\nThere is way less female nudity: in the comics, Calliope was kept naked, Rose is half-nude in her final confrontation with Dream, and Despair wears no clothes. Ironically the only nudity is male: Dream in ep 1, and Ken in his dreams.\n\nAlmost always these changes are for the better, and feel more in line with Gaiman’s work overall. In the first volume of the comics, he was still feeling out his way, and tried too hard to be gross or shocking. Most of the changes create more continuity (e.g. more use of the Corinthian and Matthew), or strengthen the characters, or humanize the villains, or underline Dream’s need to learn empathy.\n\nThe diner episode is more watchable than I feared, probably because it didn’t feel like gratuitous violence… Dee is not just exerting power, but exposing lies… which turns out to be a really bad idea. I couldn’t watch the murder-suicides though. On the other hand the second half of this episode seems rushed: it should should take longer for Dee to believe he’s triumphed and then suddenly realize he hasn’t.\n\nA few things I wasn’t so sure about:\n\nBurgess having to learn from the Corinthian who he’d captured. I’m also not so sure about Burgess dying due to violence rather than just bitter old age.\n\nChantal and Zelda seem way too Addams Family. But the original comic kind of misfires here too: the residents of the house are kind of pointlessly weird. (I loved Hal though.)\n\nI didn’t like Choronzon’s challenge passing to Lucifer. The whole idea was that this petty demon was predictable; it makes less sense that Lucifer was stumped.\n\nI missed Death’s casual remark that she could “patter Romany”. But I’m a language geek.\n\nI kind of miss the gate guardians. But they probably had a limited CGI budget.\n\nEp 10 has too many endings. I’d have left out the whole Hell scene.\n\nThe bonus episodes are not my favorites, but I expect I’m in the minority here. “Cats” is a neat idea wrapped up in a shallow joke. Well animated though. “Calliope” is very 90s: damsel in distress, with her rapist condemned, but humanized more than his victim. They’ve updated it– Calliope is a tad feister, isn’t blonde, and doesn’t have to be naked. The story is strangely anti-writer; it may be Gaiman’s version of the sad boner professor.\n\nRe-reading my own review of the comics, I note that my major complaint was the art. I think that holds up: a lot of the volumes would have worked much better if an artist like J.H. Williams (Sandman Overture) or John Cassaday (Planetary) had drawn them. Maybe the best thing about the TV series is that it corrects that problem– it’s always gorgeous.\n\nAt Mefi there was a posting on FlickChart, a site where you can rate movies. It’s simple: you are presented with two movies and choose which one you like better. (If it gives you a movie you haven’t seen, you just ask for another.) Then you do more and more, till you wonder where your time went. It’s very addictive. (Fair warning: it serves up ads with each choice.)\n\nSo, you’re very soon presented with some very weird choices:\n\nMad Max vs. Animal House\n\nMemento vs. Rocky Horror Picture Show\n\nBest in Show vs. Mulan\n\nBound vs. This is Spinal Tap\n\nPsycho vs. What About Bob?\n\nYou’ll have to develop your own policy on genre comparisons. Is an Important Movie always better than a really well done comedy? Is an eye-candy sf spectacular better than a cleverly written plot?\n\nSome things that I’ve discovered in my own rankings:\n\nThe question that helps me the most is “Which would I see again first?”\n\nReal posers are rare– I can almost always decide immediately.\n\nEven if I liked a trilogy or series, I rank the sequels way down.\n\nI’m definitely a creature of my times. If it was big in the 70s/80s/90s, I probably saw it and think fondly of it.\n\nThough a few of the hits of that time feel hollow in retrospect. Close Encounters, ugh. I can’t imagine watching E.T. again.\n\nDisney movies are my trash bin. That was kind of a surprise, because I’d have felt very differently when I was 10, or 20. But I have little desire to see Pinocchio or Sleeping Beauty again. Pixar holds up better.\n\nYou’re a bit at the mercy of their database, which is skimpy on foreign and obscure films. I’ve now rated 300 films, and my top 20 are:\n\nKill Bill Vol. 1\n\nYoung Frankenstein\n\nThe Fifth Element\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey\n\nMemento\n\nWALL-E\n\nRear Window\n\nThe Princess Bride\n\nPrincess Mononoke\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark\n\nCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\n\nReturn of the Jedi\n\nFantasia\n\nThe Matrix\n\nMulan\n\nA Clockwork Orange\n\nKill Bill Vol. 2\n\nHome Alone\n\nBack to the Future\n\nA Fish Called Wanda\n\nA lot of the list actually seems wrong to me. A lot depends on what actual choices you were presented, and I’m sure I haven’t yet chosen between #20, A Fish Called Wanda and #21, To Kill a Mockingbird, or #22, Black Panther. I don’t know what Home Alone is doing there, either. I’m not sure why Airplane! and Casablanca and The Sting and The Godfather and Galaxy Quest aren’t there, since I feel like I’ve rated them pretty highly. Do The Right Thing only just appeared in the choices, so it hasn’t had a chance to move up. And movies like Tampopo, The Triplets of Belleville, La Gloire de mon père, Blow-up, Allegro Non Troppo haven’t appeared at all. I’ll probably keep playing with the list, and it’ll look very different soon.\n\n(Also, for some reason Youtube has been offering me clips of Kill Bill recently, and I find them pretty cool. I wouldn’t have called it #1 though.)\n\nThere’s a dearth of Important Movies currently, probably because of the pandemic, to say nothing of Trumpism. When my twitter feed is full of catastrophes, I don’t really crave enlightenment and/or education from the movies. I mean, Gandhi really is a deeper, more affecting movie than WALL-E, but if they were both on, I’m afraid I’d switch to the cartoon.\n\nStill, there’s just enough truth in the list to point out two types of movies I really really like. One, visual spectacles, especially ones I’d never seen or imagined before seeing the movie; if they’re spectacular enough they can be forgiven some incoherence. Two, cleverly written movies: mind-blowers like Memento and Rear Window; near-perfect comedies like Young Frankenstein and Princess Bride.\n\nAnyway, if that inspires you to rate your own list, have fun!\n\nSo, tonight I finally saw Black Panther, which you may have heard of. If you haven’t, I suggest you go see it; it’s pretty good. This is actually the first Marvel movie I’ve seen. I hear they have, what, half a dozen by now?\n\nWe’ll get to the actual people below, but they have to work hard not to be upstaged by the set and costume design, which are some of the best to be seen in any sf/fantasy film. E.g. the big reveal of Africa’s biggest city, Wakanda:\n\nWhoops, that is Africa’s biggest city, but it’s the real city of Lagos, Nigeria. Here’s Wakanda:\n\nSo, this is a really cool shot, and it kind of ruins one of my jokes, comparing Wakanda to Numbani from Overwatch. This is far better done, not least because it isn’t just futuristic slabs as in every other movie and video game; it has interesting textures and seems anchored to the natural world. The street scenes are great too– it looks like a lively city that definitely doesn’t look American.\n\nStill, I included the picture of Lagos for a reason– as a reminder of how mind-bogglingly large it is (the metropolitan area houses 21 million people, a little more than New York), and that the continent isn’t the basket case some people depict it as. (Nigeria’s per capita income is about the same as India, which today we think of, or should, as a rising power.)\n\nThe movie itself has a lot to say about oppression and unfairly divided wealth, especially as it relates to Black people, but its view of Africa outside Wakanda is uniformly negative. It’s the “Third World” that Wakanda hides itself as; the only scene set in non-Wakandan Africa is a human-trafficking operation. Not every movie can be everything, but in this area the movie is maybe a little too American.\n\nNow, superhero movies are kind of forced to have a stereotyped and somewhat dumb structure. First you have to show that the superhero is awesome: they go and beat up normal mooks in amazing ways. But since 90 minutes of beating up mooks would get old, you have to have a supervillain, and the hero has to be beaten, and it’s hard not to make them look incompetent. Finally they get to be awesome again and the villain is decisively overcome.\n\nThis was a major problem in The Dark Knight, and Black Panther can’t quite escape it. Chadwick Boseman gets his early awesome scenes, but he also spends a lot of the movie looking kind of lost.\n\nThere’s also a special problem with the Black Panther character, which– to be honest– was created by a couple of white guys with pretty retro ideas about Africa, full of rhinos and kings and acacia trees. That is, he’s a superhero but also a traditional king His country is supposed to be wealthy and technologically advanced, yet also an absolute monarchy. (The main driver of the movie’s plot is that the king is chosen via a fight to the death.) The political contradiction was faced in the comics by Ta-Nehisi Coates, but he and Boseman both have problems humanizing the king– both T’challas are regal and austere and a little humorless. On the other hand, that does give him a real character arc, and by the end of the movie he does have something to smile about.\n\nFortunately for T’challa and the movie, he’s also surrounded by badass women who don’t have to go through that act-two round of doubt and defeat. The standouts here are his sister Shuri (Leticia Wright) and his main general Okoye (Danai Gurira). I would gladly watch a movie centering on either of them. Okoye is beautiful to watch, making the superheroics look effortless. Shuri has great fight scenes too, but she’s also Wakanda’s Q, its scientific heart, and there’s nothing like her smirky smile when she’s carelessly explaining some tech she knows her listeners won’t understand.\n\nThe main antagonist, Erik Killmonger, is unusually good for a supervillain, because Ryan Coogler (director and co-writer) gives him an intelligent ideology and plan. (And at least at first, he’s more likeable than T’challa.) He wants to fight back— he wants to use Wakandan technology to take over the world and “run it right.” When he get a chance to confront the Wakandans, he asks them what they were doing when Africa was being carved up and millions of its people enslaved. No one answers, because they have no answer. They were protecting their little turf and that’s it.\n\nNow, the dude apparently wants to use terrorism to create this empire– his plan consists of shipping out weapons, which he’s hoping will be used to kill a lot of people. So, that’s pretty bad. But he’s useful as a critique of Wakandan complacency, and an object lesson in why alpha-male combat might not be the best political system. And again, all this is way more sophisticated than most superhero stories, which are mostly about supercriminals with no relation to actual crime, and near-supernatural threats with no relation to actual global threats.\n\nA few minor cavils:\n\nBits of the plot were obviously storyboarded, but not thought out. E.g. the operation in Busan (hi D.Va!) made no sense at all: the artifact wasn’t recovered, not enough operatives were sent, and Klaue was not secured.\n\nT’challa asks his frenemy M’baku to safeguard his mother while the capital is held by Killmonger. Then, to push an alliance, he says Killmonger will come after M’baku. These statements don’t seem compatible…\n\n“Hanuman”? Yikes.\n\nEven more than the set design, the costume design is consistently great. Okoye and the rest of the all-female royal bodyguard are especially striking in their red armor. The designer went to the trouble of creating designs for each of Wakanda’s five tribes… most viewers won’t notice, but there’s a reason (e.g.) Lupita Nyong’o always wears green. This is great worldbuilding: it adds depth without getting in the way, and it rewards deeper viewing and re-viewing.\n\nEdit: Gaze, if you dare, on Tom & Lorenzo’s overview of the costumes of Okoye, Nakia, and Shuri in particular. Ruth Carter deservedly got an Oscar for this.\n\nFinally, a word on diversity, which is that it’s awesome. If you’re a Hollywood exec, rather than rebooting Batman for the 119th time, let some people tell stories that weren’t often given that chance before. The novelty and passion will make a better film. Also, trust me, give Shuri her own movie."
