        "text": "Walking among ancient stones and walls wakes up a strange feeling of connection. Isn’t it a magnificent experience, to touch something that has been there for centuries, or even millennia? It belongs to a time long forgotten, yet here I am, standing where pharaohs, emperors, or kings once stood.\n\nI can touch it.\n\nI can even pick up a paper cup someone threw on the ground and put it in the garbage bin. Immersive experience!\n\n“We are so different from them. You know, there was a time when people lived in ruins,” a friend once told me, as carefully climbed a cold, green fallen tower of a medieval keep.\n\nIt’s true, though I rarely thought of it. We, the people of today, are used to calling them museums, archaeological sites, and “old towns.” It all comes from the desire of a Homo Modernus to study and preserve. An act rather new to humanity. Merely five centuries ago, preserving historical monuments and constructions was not considered necessary. Walking among them, daydreaming, or inhaling inspiration didn’t exist as a concept.\n\nUnlike UNESCO, ruins were there forever. Countless fallen empires and cities were rummaged through and left in burning decay. And then, those who came and conquered — stayed.\n\nIf you are a Roman general who has just invaded a new city, the first thing you think about is how to repopulate it. You need roads, public spaces, forums, houses. An aqueduct would be nice if you plan to have water. And you better have water. What are you, a caveman?\n\nLeaving the city in ruins to “invite visitors and sell tickets,” is simply impractical from your perception of the world. And so you build, using everything you can find. On top of destroyed temples, new ones rise. Lycian baths turn into Roman baths (told you the aqueduct would come in handy!)\n\nA sultan of the Ottoman Empire has little concern about the previous owners of this fine capital he has just ruthlessly occupied. Tearing down a basilica and using the stones for a new road seems like an obvious thing to do.\n\nEventually, people appear, walking the ruins, organizing markets, town meetings, and entertainment. Living. A town is reborn on what’s left of its predecessor. It is the natural order.\n\nI love ancient sites. My friends keep calling them boring, but I’m creative. I can work with boring. The best thing I came up with is to picture my life there. Ignore temples, palaces, and monuments and concentrate on simple day-to-day objects — shops, pipes, theatres, toilets, and crossroads.\n\nSince I wrapped my head around the fact previous inhabitants didn’t preserve historical sites, hardly considering them “historical,” I gained a whole new perspective. If I’m a Roman, I live among Greek ruins. If I’m a barbarian, I have Roman leftovers at my disposal. I’m not being geographically accurate, but we can have a little stretch for the sake of proving a point.\n\nIt’s often said that the Great Pyramids were as ancient for Romans as ancient Romans are for us. But we surround Roman constructions with metal fences, put an information plaque on them, and hire a grumpy man to yell “No touching.”\n\nRomans (Egyptian folk from the imperial province, to be accurate), on the other hand, lived among the Pyramids with little to no concern for their value other than cult importance.\n\n- Look, Antonia, Pyramids.\n\n- Yeah, is the shop in the big one still open? I need leeches, my back is killing me.\n\nNot very long ago, technology allowed people to have free time. It was way before Flappy Bird and Instagram, so people had to fill it with something, anything as long as it was spiritual, cultural, or educational. From that rose an idea to turn old forgotten stones into places of cultural importance. Instead of inhabiting them, people decided to admire them.\n\nAs I often write stories in the dystopian fiction genre, I tend to imagine worlds of the distant future and how people will remember past times. Often there is some sort of a doomsday event that destroyed the world, or a good part of it. But the irony is that the “world” had already been destroyed more than once.\n\nHere I am, facing a millennia-old wall. No one lives here anymore, there are no shops (apart from a little shack with magnets), no houses, nothing. It was dug up a century ago and turned into a museum.\n\nIsn’t that a world from one of speculative fiction tales? We are those people from a distant future. The remains of ancient might lie under our feet giving way to technology. We preserve and rebuild the silent reminders of those different times and different people. Unlike our ancestors, we don’t live among ruins anymore.\n\nWe look at them."
