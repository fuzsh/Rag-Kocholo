        "text": "Occasionally, my pacifist political beliefs are challenged. In America’s entire history, there have been a grand total of four wars we were involved in that I felt were justified military conflicts. The American Revolution, the Civil War (in so far as it ended slavery and no matter what revisionist historians tell you, it would not have ended naturally any time soon), World War II, and Afghanistan (at first. not so much 10 years later). In pretty much every other conflict, we should have just minded our own business and stayed out of affairs that weren’t our own. There are, in my opinion, two justifications for military action. Either we’ve been attacked and are defending ourselves to the point that we ensure the offending nation won’t target us again while simultaneously not embroiling ourselves too deeply in the nation’s domestic affairs or we are stopping a genocide or ethnic cleansing (with the assistance of the U.N. none of that unilateral Iraq bullshit). So, actually our involvement in Serbia/Kosovo is okay in my book as well. The film Black Hawk Down is the true story of a U.S. military involvement that I support theoretically but to say that the execution of this plan was a clusterfuck would be an understatement, and Ridley Scott’s vision of the hell that was Mogadishu makes for gritty and compelling cinema even if there is virtually no meat on this film’s bones.\n\nIn the 90s, the U.S. (with U.N. assistance) commenced an operation to take down a Somalian warlord whose tyrannical control of his nation had led to the deaths of over 300,000 Somalian citizens from civil war as well as starvation (because the warlord viciously hoarded the food supplied by the U.N.). After weeks of little results (and increasing frustrations with U.S. military presence in Africa at home when the public saw no tangible benefit for our presence), the U.S. military (specifically the Rangers and Delta Force) go on a daring mission right into the heart of Mogadishu, the heavily guarded base of operations for the warlords and his seemingly endless forces. It’s supposed to be a routine mission that will take little more than 30 minutes, but when a stray RPG from Somalian forces causes one man to nearly fall to his death from a helicopter, it’s immediately obvious that things won’t be that simple. The U.S. military comes under constant fire, and when not one but two black hawk helicopters get shot down, the mission to rescue these stranded warriors leads to nearly a day of fighting in the streets of Mogadishu with not enough ammo, water, or men.\n\nRidley Scott’s direction is as visceral and gut-wrenching as its ever been. I may have felt absolutely no connection to any character in this film (save Josh Hartnett’s role), but Ridley Scott’s eye for harrowing and graphically realistic depiction of war is only surpassed by Band of Brothers and Saving Private Ryan. Those productions are infinitely superior to Black Hawk Down, but I’ll get to that in a second. The cinematography is immensely impressive. This is probably one of the least impressive films substantively that I’m willing to say this for, but Ridley Scott definitely deserved his Best Director nomination at the Oscars. This movie is 2 and a half hours long and I didn’t know the names of nearly anyone on the screen. I just recognized their actors. But, Ridley Scott’s realistic and heart-breaking of the massive debacle that was the Mogadishu mission kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. It’s really a shame that the writing was so shallow and the characterizations so non-existent that I couldn’t add any emotional layer to my connection to what was happening on screen.\n\nI think I should read the non-fiction book that the film is based on. It’s written by Mark Bowden, who also wrote Killing Pablo which I enjoyed despite its flaws. This film was all bang and no insight. People may accuse me of reading too deeply into this, but I got some slightly racist undertones from it as well. We only saw the genocidal Africans in this. We got no insight (or even display) of the Africans that these soldiers were there to protect. There was some not so subtle political propaganda in the movie. At the end of the day, as an action film, it succeeded. I don’t enjoy action films but this one kept me riveted the entire time. However, as an engaging and intellectually stimulating look at one of the most remarkable military debacles since Prickett’s Charge at the battle of Gettysburg, it was less than impressive.\n\nFinal Score: B-\n\nWhen Watchmen came out, it marked my formal introduction into films that people either loved or hated. There was little in the way of indifferent responses to the movie. Essentially, you either loved the movie and thought it was one of (if not the greatest) superhero films of all time or you thought it was boring and pointless and as my sister referred to it “a three hour segment of my youth I’ll never get back.” Generally, these kinds of films elicit either a “got it” or “didn’t get it” reaction from audiences (though some of Watchmen‘s haters tended to hate seeing their beloved graphic novel poorly displayed on the big screen though I essentially thought it was a frame for frame recreation). Last night, I watched 2001’s Wet Hot American Summer which seemed to feature almost every single B-List comedy actor who would eventually feature in some small or large role in a Judd Apatow film, and it appears to be nearly as divisive as Watchmen. While I would certainly never call this one of the greatest comedies ever (or even a great comedy), it was still a raucous and absurdist parody of the camp genre of the 1980’s and I laughed my ass off the entire film. At the same time, my dad just thought it was stupid, and that seems to be the generally divided reactions to the film. Well, if you appreciate truly surreal and off-kilter comedy, this hidden cult classic might be for you.\n\nIn 1981, summer is coming to an end at Camp Firewood, a Jewish summer camp in Maine. It’s the last day of camp, and everyone is itching to find that special someone to share the night with. Told almost exclusively through the eyes of the camp’s counselors, Wet Hot American Summer is over-the-top and outrageous satire of films like Meatballs and Heavyweights. Camp Director Beth (Janeane Garofalo) has the hots for dorky astrophysicist Henry (Frasier‘s David Hyde Pierce). Coop (Michael Showalter) hasn’t found a girl all summer, and while trying to receive relationship advice from gorgeous Katie, they form a romantic bond even though she’s dating bad boy Andy (Role Model‘s Paul Rudd). You’ve got the potentially psychotic Vietnam War veteran Gene (Oz‘s Christopher Meloni in the role that steals the whole film) as well as Ben (The Hangover‘s Bradley Cooper) and Susie (Parks and Recreation‘s Amy Poehler) who are organizing the talent show and think they’re directing Broadway. Over the course of this last day, counselor’s make out, campers go generally unsupervised, and everyone tries to get laid.\n\nOne of the real selling points of this film is that it is a who’s who of under-appreciated comedy character actors. In addition to the littany of names I mentioned below, you have A.D. Miles who played the enthusiastic Big Brother in Role Models. There’s Ken Marino who you may recognize from Reno 911 as well as Role Models. Joe La Truglio who was the squeaky gym trainer in I Love You, Man as well as the creepy party guy in Superbad plays a counselor who gets involved in a hilariously epic motorcycle chase. Elizabeth Banks has a small role in this film before she ever got famous, and one can’t help but wonder if the use of KISS’s “Beth” during a moment in this film had anything to do with its inclusion in the other Paul Rudd/Elizabeth Banks feature, Role Models. Fans of I Love The (Insert Decade Here) programs on VH1 will enjoy seeing Michael Ian Black as Bradley Cooper’s homosexual lover. Sam Levine (Bill on Freaks and Geeks) even voices the host of the camp’s radio show, and no one will be able to forget Molly Shannon as the recently divorced arts teacher of the camp who finds redemption through her campers.\n\nWhat really sells the movie for me though is simply how absurd and surreal it can be. When it first begins, you don’t really know exactly what kind of movie this is going to be, and you would be forgiven for thinking during it’s first 20 minutes or so that you were watching a conventional summer camp film. However, some of the camper’s leave to go to town for a bit, and from that point forward, it becomes the movie’s goal to see just how far they can push things and just how outrageous the next joke can be. Whether it’s driving campers off away from the camp and throwing them out of moving vehicles so they don’t know one of the kids died or going into town and becoming heroin junkies or stopping a comet from hitting the camp with a Dungeons and Dragons D20 or a Kenyan marathon runner showing up during the capture the flag segment, this movie firmly cements itself as crazy satire. The silly tone almost never lets up and while certain jokes fall flat, this movie is still consistently hilarious once you actually figure out what kind of movie you’re watching, and any moment that Christopher Meloni was on screen was pure comedy gold.\n\nIf you need conventional jokes and punchlines or a story that needs to make any semblance of a sense and a setting that is rooted in anything resembling real life situations, this isn’t for you. But if you’re a fan of intentionally outlandish and surreal comedy (Monty Python for example), then you should eat this movie up. It was lambasted by critics when it came out (Entertainment Weekly’s Owen Glieberman almost the sole exception), but it’s developed a loyal cult following over the years, and now I’m a convert. Few movies are willing to take themselves so lightly and in such a deliberately silly manner that it’s great to know there are still comedies out there that aren’t afraid to be truly unique and out there. It wasn’t a perfect film as I’ve said, and when the jokes didn’t work, they failed hard, but for the most part, few films have been able to make me laugh so hard with such bizarre material and I can’t think of many better compliments.\n\nFinal Score: B+\n\nI finished this book on Tuesday at work, and I’ve been putting off actually reviewing it because I’ve gotten incredibly side-tracked with Skyrim (again). I want to spend the rest of my evening reviewing music from 2011 because I have a big interview in NYC on Tuesday with music journalism website called baeblemusic.com about an editorial internship for the spring, but I really need to get this review out of the way (as well as my review for this week’s Glee which I’ll start on as soon as I finish this). Hopefully, after these two reviews, I’ll have time for one more album, and then I’ll be able to go to bed with a clear conscience. Back to my review. When I first started out college, I was originally a double major in political science as well as criminology & investigations. A fan of The Wire in high school (and not yet aware [because I was a moron or something] that the basic message of the show was that the war on drugs was a waste of time), I wanted to work in the FBI’s anti-drug division or to get a job with the DEA. I’m a big fan of true crime novels, and they generally serve as interesting history lessons/parables. Vincent Bugliosi’s Helter Skelter remains the definitive work on Charles Manson. I bought Mark Bowden’s (Black Hawk Down) Killing Pablo many years ago, and I never got around to reading it until last week when I finally started it for the first time. While it was certainly an interesting tale, I was often put off by Bowden’s comfort level with some of the atrocities that were committed in the eventual murder of Pablo Escobar as well as his inability to immerse the reader in the culture the book was centered on or to help the reader come away with any insights into one of the most intriguing manhunts in human history.\n\nKilling Pablo is the story of the circumstances surrounding the eventual manhunt and murder of notorious Columbian cocaine kingpin, Pablo Escobar. At the height of his wealth, Pablo Escobar was one of (if not the) richest men in the world with an income rumored to be in the billions (all estimates by outsiders are considered extremely conservative). Having amassed several lifetimes of fortune through the booming cocaine industry, Pablo Escobar was an international icon for the cocaine industry. Using a system known as plomo o plato (silver or lead), Pablo either bribed all of the politicians, cops, and judges to ignore his legal trespasses or he killed the one’s who wouldn’t take his money. Pablo’s ambitions got the better of him (as they do almost all criminals), and his political aspirations finally brought the unavoidable attention of Columbia’s legal system. Pablo waged a systematic war against the state of Columbia killing thousands of individuals, injuring countless more, and doing millions upon millions of dollars in property damage. With the help of U.S. special forces, the Columbian government conducted one of the most expensive and thorough hunts in the history of man while facing untold public corruption, the constant threat of assassination by Escobar’s hitmen, the introduction (though likely helped by the Columbian police) of brutal vigilante groups that were murdering Pablo’s family and associates in the streets, and constant last-second failures and escapes.\n\nBowden assuredly writes with evocative detail, and after reading the book, you may feel as if you know the countryside of Columbia and the slums of Bogota and Medellin as well as Delta Force, but the book raises far too many moral questions that Mark Bowden only passingly deals with by the book’s end. While I’m a firm believer in the decriminalization of drugs (after I finally got what The Wire was actually about and for other more libertarian reasons), Pablo Escobar wasn’t a businessman. He was a terrorist and one of the most accomplished mass murderers in history that wasn’t involved in racial cleansings or world wars. Yet, the Columbian government often acted in ways so brutal and merciless that they came across nearly as bad as Pablo. Whenever the Search Bloc (which was the Colombian police unit in charge of the hunt for Escobar) found one of Pablo’s men, they would summarily execute him even if he surrendered rather than offering him a trial (because by their logic, their legal system was so corrupt that he would just walk). The Search Bloc fed information to Los Pepes (the vigilante group that was committing gruesome murders of innocent family members of Escobar) so that they knew Pablo was constantly on edge to make him more likely to make mistakes. The U.S. government, especially the D.E.A., knew all of this was happening and yet we still supplied the Columbian government with tech support and occasional manpower (even though assassinating foreign figures that we aren’t at war with is illegal by our own laws). Bowden often exhibited the same type of “ends justify the means” mentality as many of the people in the book, and it’s upsetting that there wasn’t more moral outrage about the loss of the moral high ground in the hunt for this criminal.\n\nMaybe I’ve been spoiled too much by Tom Wolfe’s The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, but this book was just too cut and dry for me. It was almost like a text-book, and this situation is so interesting and there are so many ethical quandaries that arise that you really just expect Mark Bowden to have put more work into delving deeper beyond the surface of what happened and beyond the facts and instead get to the soul of the issue. Yes, I now know much, much more about Pablo’s rise to power and the way he muscled himself into the cocaine business. I know about his sexual appetites and the way that he thought of himself as a man of the people (or at least projected that image to get their support) and that it was this same desire to be visible and respected that cost him everything. I was able to form my own opinions about the many lines that the Columbian and U.S. governments crossed in the hunt for Pablo, but none of that came across in the tone of the book. Those realizations came because of my natural political leanings and my belief in an honest and true legal system, not the sham that Columbia had which became criminal in order to catch a criminal and in the process simply traded Pablo Escobar’s regime for that of the Cali cartel which was allowed to exist because it wasn’t engaging in full-blown warfare against the state. When I finished The Electric Kool-Aid Test, I felt like I had ridden the bus and Tom Wolfe had crafted a magical mystery tour that captured the essence of the 60’s. Mark Bowden doesn’t achieve anything similar for the era when coke was king.\n\nMaybe, I’m crazy, but the picture above this paragraph really says it all. If you’re the kind of person that can take a visceral pleasure in a “by any means necessary” tale of revenge, then you’ll love this book. Mark Bowden will give you that machismo, action fix that you need. For the rest of us who believe that in order to have any moral imperative to decide when someone has crossed the line and become a criminal you have to follow your own rule of law, then you may be incredibly disturbed by what you read. Pablo Escobar was a terrible person and something had to be done to stop his rampant acts of terrorism. However, President Obama proved with the capture of Osama Bin Laden that you don’t have to sell your soul to stop the bad guys, and I wish that Mark Bowden simply had more to say on that subject. The book is upsettingly incomplete without that kind of commentary.\n\nFinal Score: B\n\nIn the realm of movies, it’s not uncommon to encounter directors (and writers) whose absolute love for their medium shines through in every frame of their films. Quentin Tarantino’s near encyclopedic knowledge of cinema is evident in every second of his glorious odes to the genre films he knows and loves. While simultaneously deconstructing the entire medium of film, much of David Lynch’s most famous works, Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive specifically, are full to the brim of subtle nods and references to the 1950’s and film noir classics he so clearly adores. The way in which his characters spend large swaths of his films discussing in pain-staking detail the most irrelevant sections of classic science fiction and fantasy films, it’s impossible to deny Kevin Smith’s passion for his field. British author Neil Gaiman (the classic Sandman graphic novel series as well as the novels Stardust and Good Omens with Terry Pratchett) is the literary equivalent of a genre enthusiast. With a rich and indelible knowledge of mythology and fantasy, Gaiman has spent the last two decades weaving rich historical and fantastical narrative tapestries around the myths and fairy tales that form the core of the fantasy experience, and in his 2001 novel American Gods, Neil Gaiman hones his craft to near perfection.\n\nWeaving the grandly mythical with the everyday, American Gods is a tale quite unlike anything you’ve encountered before. Shadow is a gym trainer who has spent the last three years in prison for aggravated assault. Just as he is being released on parole for good behavior, Shadow is shocked to discover that his wife Laura (the light of hope that got him through his prison years) has died in a car accident. On the plane ride back to his hometown for his wife’s funeral, Shadow meets the mysterious Mr. Wednesday, who seems to know more about Shadow than is humanly possible. Wednesday offers Shadow a job as his driver, protector, and errand boy, and after witnessing Wednesday’s seemingly impossible powers first hand, Shadow accepts. What follows is a Jack Kerouac reminiscent road trip across the United States as man meets myth in a world where all of the gods that have ever lived still walk the Earth, as long as there is someone left to remember them. It is a world where the old gods and creatures of Norse and Irish and Egyptian and countless other mythologies face extinction at the hands of the new gods of technology and big business. At the core of the novel remains Shadow, the man with much more than meets the eye who finds himself enmeshed in this ever-growing conspiracy.\n\nFor those who have read Gaiman’s Sandman series (and if you haven’t, you simply must right now), it should come as no shock that this novel falls firmly in the realm of urban fantasy, which is to say fantasy tales set in the Earth we currently occupy. Using a seemingly limitless number of real places as the continuing setting of his road trip into the heart of America, Gaiman keeps readers on their toes by seamlessly integrating more gods, cultural icons, and mythical creatures into the story than you may even notice (if you aren’t intricately familiar with mythology). What makes this feat so impressive is the way he accomplishes all of this while still maintaining a well defined and comprehensible set of rules and logic to this mythical universe he creates. Gaiman’s abilty to deftly weave a riveting and engaging fantasy epic alongside asides on the nature of myth and belief with existentialist undertones on the nature of god’s relationship to man all wrapped in a tale that is pure Americana (told by a Brit no less) simply makes this one of the most unique and rewarding tales I have encountered in a long time.\n\nFor those concerned that my sales pitch for the book makes it seem inaccessible and overly intellectual, let me assuage those worries. At no point in this tale does Gaiman sacrifice readability or entertainment value for long-winded pretension. His prose is simple and clear and is as thoroughly readable as anything written by Stephen King. One of the many things that makes Gaiman so special is the puts this deeply accessible prose to the service of a grandly complex tale which can be enjoyed on a surface level as a fantasy adventure, but for those who wish to dig deeper into Gaiman’s words and themes, there is a whole world of mythology and Americana to dissect. Over the course of a 6 hour shift at work, when customers would regularly interrupt my reading, I still managed to devour 300 pages of American Gods in one sitting, and I could only think of how much more I wanted to read. American Gods is a page-turner in every sense of the word, and once it gets its claws in you, you won’t be able to put it down.\n\nStephen King famously declared Neil Gaiman to be one of the most talented storytellers we have working today, and I would have to confer. His Sandman graphic novel series is not only my favorite comic book series of all time but also my favorite book series, period. Compared to the dark, deconstructionist bent of George R. R. Martin (which I appreciate as well), Gaiman represents as intellectual and ambitious a force in the fantasy market, but he puts forth his love of fantasy and mythology without leaving the genre in tattered ruins in his wake. For everyone who grew up devouring classical mythology as a child and never out grew their sense of wonder and discovery, American Gods is a guaranteed catalyst to your mythological pleasure principle. Fans of the great urban fantasy tales of our generation (such as Stephen King’s Dark Tower novels or the works of Joss Whedon) will find the true master of the genre in Gaiman. There are few things I am willing to whole-heartedly recommend to every subset of my audience, but as long as you have even the most remote interest in fantasy storytelling (and even if you don’t but still love intellectual mind games), this book is for you.\n\nFinal Score: A\n\nWell, Season 6 has finally drawn to its suitably epic close. The season might have been extremely inconsistent for most of its duration, but damn, were the last two discs excellent. Sometimes, Joss Whedon stutters in the arc filler department, but boy does he know how to draw his stories to awesome closes. Graduation, Buffy sacrificing herself to save Dawn from Glory, Buffy killing Angel, the bat shit insanity that was “Restless”. Buffy has some consistently awesome season finales, and Season 6 was no exception. This season placed a much needed emphasis on characterization and the deviation from its standard plot structure paid off in spades when the climax finally arrived. I’m really sad that I’m about to start the final season of the series. After all of the time I’ve spent in Sunnydale, I’m going to be really sad to leave the Hellmouth behind.\n\nFor the first time since the season premiere, we got one story told over the course of multiple episodes; in this case, that would specifically be three episodes. After Tara is murdered by Warren (who also nearly kills Buffy in the process), Willow’s whole “not using magic” thing goes out the window. Willow immediately absorbs all of the magic in the dark magic books at the Magic Box and goes off on a roaring rampage of revenge Beatrix Kiddo style. Despite the best efforts of her friends to stop her, Willow finds Warren and flays the skin from his body and then incinerates him. She tries to kill Jonathan and Andrew as well but is stopped this time when Anya casts protective magic on those two while Buffy and Willow get in the best girl on girl ass kicking contest since Buffy and Faith in Season 3. After Willow has convincingly kicked Buffy’s ass, Giles shows up with super magic power granted by a coven of witches in England to stop Willow. But he also gets his ass kicked by Willow. Willow absorbs his magic but then goes crazy with the world’s pain and decides to end the world. Only, a “the power of friendship” speech from Xander is able to stop her and bring Willow back down to Earth. Also, Spike gets his soul back!\n\n“Villains” gets serious props if for no other reason than the incredibly gruesome (and graphic) way that Willow kills Warren. Like, Jesus Christ. I didn’t think you could do something that graphic on network television. You saw a fleshless, meat sac version of Warren. It was gross. “Two to Go” has the awesome fight between Buffy and Willow. Willow rarely gets chances to be a bad-ass and so watching her get into a hardcore kick ass battle with Buffy was nice. Plus, Giles surprise return at the episode’s end was awesome. I probably could have done without the disruptive switches to Spike’s trial to get his soul back, but at the same time, without those moments, we wouldn’t get Spike with his soul back so I guess it was worth sitting through. “Grave”, much like the climactic battles from Season 4, did have the season’s big problem solved by the power of friendship, which could have been lame, but this was really moving and beautiful. The scene with Xander and Willow on the cliff was really touching, and it had me in tears.\n\nLike I said in my first paragraph, given the entirety of the season to look back on, this season placed characterization first and epic fantasy storytelling second (until the end anyways). That was good when the show was doing characterization well. Buffy doesn’t just have one writer so it’s inevitable that storytelling and quality are going to be radically inconsistent. It had problems here and there. Some times the story telling was really heavy-handed (“Smashed”, “Wrecked” and “Gone”) or just annoying (Dawn’s episodes), but then there were moments where it was fantastic. Tara really came into her own this season (only to die 😦 ) and the Buffy and Spike storyline was done well and horribly simultaneously. The Spike rape scene was bordering on unwatchable but in a good way. Also, Xander was given some real emotional depth. Things were just sort of hit or miss.\n\nI’m glad Giles is back. I’m glad Willow is back to normal. I’m really going to miss Tara, and I’m excited to see what’s going to happen with Spike now that he has a soul. I’ve really been enjoying the time I’ve spent watching these seasons of this show for the first time. Most fantasy is by its very nature escapist and emotionally shallow. Much like Game of Thrones, Joss Whedon isn’t content with meeting expectations. He will subvert your expectations, create compelling characters, and break your heart by ripping out of your chest. But he will craft stellar television in the process. I’ve heard from a lot of people that Angel was even better than Buffy, so I’m really excited to get to start it soon. That should be a lot of fun.\n\nDisc Score: A\n\nGod damnit Joss Whedon. You are the cruelest emotional puppet master in all of television. I always thought it would be difficult for him to top the sudden and nearly nonchalant way he killed off Wash in Firefly. Well… I was wrong. Although I knew about the major twist that came at the very end of this disc, knowing did practically nothing to stop a certain death from causing me to yell at my TV about how much I (momentarily) hated Joss Whedon. Besides the big, dark moment, this was one of the most adult and mature discs of the entire series and also one of the consistently best. While this season has been wildly inconsistent in terms of quality and tone, Joss Whedon proved here that when he sets his mind to it, he can make some of the most compelling drama on television.\n\nWe get another set of four distinct but thematically and chronologically consistent stories on this disc. The first episode is about Xander and Anya’s wedding. Except, we’re in Sunnydale, and nothing can go right. Xander is visited by a man claiming to be him from the future where he shows Xander a future where his marriage with Anya makes Xander hate himself and Anya. Rather than face this possible future, Xander calls off the wedding and Anya goes back to being a vengeance demon. In the next episode, the Trio summons a demon which infects Buffy with a poison that makes her believe she is actually a patient in a mental hospital and that everything that’s happened in Sunnydale has all been part of her schizophrenic imagination. The episode ends with the implied possibility that the alternate universe might actually be reality. In the third episode, Anya returns to town in all her vengeance demon glory trying to get revenge on Xander, except she is reminded by Halfrek that vengeance demons can’t fulfill their own revenge schemes. Anya and Spike sleep together, mostly to spite Xander and Buffy and everyone learns about Spike and Buffy’s relationship. And finally, in the last episode, Spike attempts to rape Buffy but then flees Sunnydale in horror of what he’s done. The Trio is finally broken when Jonathan and Andrew take the fall for a bank robbery foiled by Buffy while Warren escapes. Willow and Tara are back together, only for Warren to accidentally shoot Tara while attempting to kill Buffy as revenge for foiling his plans. Also, Buffy is shot. Shit, just got real (especially since Willow had some serious evil eyes going on at episode’s end).\n\nIn terms of the quality of individual episodes, they were all pretty great. “Hell’s Bells” was a deeply tragic (but as always comic) end to the long-lasting relationship between Xander and Anya. I know everyone feels awful for Anya in this scenario, but I felt almost equally as bad for Xander as he has to make the incredibly painful and hurtful decision to end things with Anya and that perhaps he never wanted to marry her in the first place. “Normal Again” is one of the best episodes of the series. It was full of so much meta-commentary and mind screw that much like “Restless”, there was something essentially “Lynchian” about the story. Also, it was great to see Kristine Sutherland as Joyce one last time. “Entropy” was mature in a way that not counting “The Body” I would have told you this show was incapable of being. The stories between Anya and Xander as well as the continued dissolution of Buffy and Spike’s relationship was handled in a very adult manner and quite realistically (except for Spike being a vampire and Anya being a demon obviously). When Xander learns that not just Anya but also Buffy slept with Spike, you feel heartbroken for the guy. However, Willow and Tara’s reunion at the episodes end made all of the angst nearly worth it. And then there’s “Seeing Red”. It was possibly one of the darkest episodes in the series. Spike’s attempted rape of Buffy was nearly too much for me to watch and Tara’s death is simply heart-breaking.\n\nSpeaking of “Seeing Red,”, seriously Joss Whedon, What The Hell!? I knew Tara’s death was coming, and until it finally occurred, I wasn’t sure how I would feel about its place in the series mythos. I have less a problem with her death itself and maybe more of a problem with how Joss handled the death. Tara has been a fairly important cast member ever since Season Four. Yet, in all that time, she never made an appearance in the opening credits of the show. Apparently, Joss Whedon thought it would be hilarious to kill her off in the episode where she finally made the opening credits. Also, would it have killed you Joss to let Willow and Tara have a little more time together before you so violently ripped her out of the show? I get that her death was necessary for setting up Dark Willow, but damn, you really love to fuck with your audience’s emotions.\n\nWay back when Tara was first introduced, I was not a huge fan of her character, but the longer she stuck around on the show and the more and more depth that her relationship with Willow was given, I grew quite attached to her. I’m really sad to see her go, but that’s Joss Whedon’s thing. He kills off beloved supporting characters because he thinks it will hurt more than losing a main character. And he might be right. Anyways, I’ve got three episodes left of this season. Then, finally, I will be on the show’s last season, and I can bring the epic saga of the Slayer, the Scoobies, and Sunnydale to a long-awaited close. Of course, I’ll be immediately jumping into Angel, so it won’t be a radical departure.\n\nR.I.P. Tara\n\nDisc Score: A\n\nWell, it’s never taken me this long to review a single disc of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. This isn’t a comment on the season but simply the fact that I’ve moved to Morgantown and back to school but my sister is still in Philippi until school officially starts again at the end of August. So, I resisted my urges to continue watching the season without her out of some misplaced loyalty. However, there’s an ever-growing possibility that she won’t be able to live with me at the house we were supposed to be sharing because Residential Education at WVU is stupid. If it turns out she’s living at the dorms and not at our house, then I’m finishing Buffy without her. I’m sure she’ll understand.\n\nWe got a series of fairly distinct stories over this run although they all fit with the season’s style of having one distinct over-riding myth arc or theme drawing the whole season together (specifically, finally becoming an adult). In the first episode, Buffy gets a job at a fast-food restaurant but quickly becomes convinced that the company is feeding its patrons human beings. The second episode has the Trio constructing a device which allows them to turn women into their own mindless sex slaves. Warren uses the device on his ex-girlfriend from last season, but the device malfunctions and when Katrina realizes that Warren had basically mind raped her, she tries to escape to tell the police but Warren murders her. Using magic and demons, the Trio convinces Buffy that she was actually responsible for the death and riddles her with insane amounts of guilt. The third episode has Dawn unknowingly invoking the powers of vengeance demon Halfrek and making it impossible for anyone to leave her house once they entered. Finally, Riley returns from South America hunting a dangerous demon and he brought his new bride along for the ride.\n\nThis particular disc was extremely variable in the qualities of the episodes. It was like a disc of Glee. I never knew if I was going to get something great or terrible. “Doublemeat Palace” is in the running for the worst episode of the entire series (that I’ve seen so far). It was awful and boring. I really couldn’t care less the entire time. The only interesting thing to happen was when Amy forced magic on an unwilling Willow and Willow had to resist the urge to fall back to her old ways. Of course, then “Dead Things” comes along and provides one of the series’ darkest moments. The Trio were just terribly incompetent and mostly harmless villains to this point. And then Warren just crosses the moral event horizon and then some. Kudos to the performances of Jonathon and Andrew’s actors as they really played the sudden realization of the terrible thing they’ve done quite well. “Older and Far Away” was hilarious. Clem is quickly becoming one of my favorite recurring minor characters. The episode also managed to be both dark and funny so that’s Joss Whedon for you in a nutshell. “As You Were” was just mediocre. I’m glad that Joss made Riley’s wife likeable though. It would have been too easy to make her a bitch or incompetent. She was in fact almost as big a bad ass as Buffy.\n\nI almost feel as if this season has been some strange deconstruction of the entire point of the series. Throughout every season, Buffy inevitably saves the world from some impending apocalypse. There’s been no saving the world scenario this season. Buffy has had to fight evil but they’ve almost all been some extension of personal demons or an allegory for whatever is troubling her in her personal life. I know that she does actually have to save the world at the end of the season, but that’s a development that literally doesn’t occur until the last disc of the season. This season has been much more personal and small-scale. That isn’t a bad thing. It’s just an observation of how it is. With the exception of “Once More with Feeling”, this season hasn’t had any truly memorable moments so far though. Although, it’s still probably the second best season of the show. This one is or the third season. I’m not sure.\n\nI’m really hoping that Nicole and I get to actually finish the series together. She’ll be really pissed off at me if I end up watching the rest of Buffy without her. Watching a new disc was quickly becoming a tradition for the two of us, and whenever we watched Buffy, we definitely weren’t fighting (which is always a good sign). However, I will most likely have to finish it without her. I started watching Buffy my sophomore year of college. I’m entering my 5th year. It’s time I actually bring this series to a close. I’ve got two discs left of season 6 and then the final season itself (not counting the comics which I will eventually get around to reading). My time in Sunnydale is drawing to a close.\n\nDisc Score: B+\n\nI’ve watched my fair share of dark films for this blog. Films that were so dark it seemed as if no rays of light could possibly escape it. The Savages and Tess spring immediately to mind. However, the film I just watched, 2001’s Storytelling is a black hole of never-ending despair that make the darkest films I’ve reviewed for this blog seem like brightly-colored neon rainbow fireworks, and in a bit of confusing irony that I can’t really explain, the film’s ostensibly a comedy, but in that ironic, cynical, depressing way that somehow works. This film is far from something I can recommend for even the most jaded and cynical of my readers, but at the same time, I thought it was very well-made and thought-provoking even if I feel I need to take a shower to wash the grime of this film off of me.\n\nThe plot of Storytelling is broken into two short films that don’t interact or (as far as I could tell) have anything to do with each other. The first film “Fiction” is about a girl in a college creative writing class named Vi (Selma Blair) who is dating one of her classmates, a boy with cerebral palsy named Marcus (Kids‘ Leo Fitzpatrick). Marcus’ short story is eviscerated by his classmates and their masochistic professor, the Pulitzer Prize winner Mr. Scott (The Wire‘s Robert Wisdom), and in a moment of spiteful rage, he dumbs Vi. Vi decides to get over her relationship with Marcus by having sex with Mr. Scott who she runs into at a bar. However, Mr. Scott is as masochistic in the bedroom as he is in class and his rough treatment of Vi flings her right back to Marcus. Vi writes about her sexual experience for a story for the class but none of her classmates find the story believable and rip her story apart as well.\n\nThe other section (and far more involved story) is that of a boy named Scooby Livingston (Mark Webber) who has practically no aspirations in life, except perhaps to be Conan O’Brian’s sidekick. This is a serious problem for his archetypically suburban parents (one of which is a quite frightening John Goodman). Mark gains the attention (completely on accident) of a struggling documentary film-maker, Toby Oxman (the always brilliant Paul Giamatti), who wants to explore what the reality is for high school students in the new millennium. Without wanting to ruin what all happens during this particular story, let’s just say that things start out miserable and end up at truly horrific.\n\nThe film is grounded in its stellar cast. I know Robert Wisdom primarily as Bunny Colvin on The Wire, where he played one of the most morally grounded people in the series (even if he did legalize drugs in Hamsterdam). Seeing him play such a complete dick was a real shock and he nailed the role. My familiarity with Selma Blair’s ouevre is restricted to the terrible chick flicks she’s made like Legally Blonde and The Sweetest Thing. To see her play such a vulnerable and sexual character was quite a role reversal as well. Paul Giamatti is my favorite character actor on the planet, bar none, and no one plays nebbish, neurotic losers better than he does (except maybe Woody Allen), and Toby was another role he was simply born to play. This wasn’t Sideways or American Splendor, but those are also his two best roles so that’s a lot to live up to. I haven’t seen John Goodman be this scary since Barton Fink where he played a serial killer so it was interesting.\n\nThe primary question you should ask yourself if you plan on watching this is do you have a pure soul. If you do, it won’t be pure by the time this film is over. It will suck the life out of you, and you will have to play with puppies and babies in order to become happy again. If that sounds like your kind of movie, then go ahead and watch it. It’s easily the most darkly comic film I’ve ever watched and I’ve watched my fair share of those types of films. I will probably never watch this ever again, but that doesn’t mean I didn’t think this was an incredibly compelling and interesting film. It just means my soul can only handle so much.\n\nFinal Score: B+\n\nHoo boy. Sometimes you watch a movie or listen to an album, and it is simply impossible to come to any conclusion other than that its creators had consumed large quantities of psychedelic drugs during the creation process. Panda Bear’s Person Pitch, Pink Floyd’s The Wall (album or movie. but especially the film), Thomas Pynchon’s Gravity’s Rainbow, Rocko’s Modern Life, and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (which was confirmed as being written on crazy amounts of drugs) all spring to mind. With the possible exceptions of the first opening episodes of Gurren Lagann, I’ve never really watched an anime that made me momentarily question if someone had slipped some lysergic acid diethylamide into my Dr. Pepper. I’ve never watched the anime equivalent of a David Lynch film where I simply gave up on trying to completely digest the plot and just sort of went with the flow. I never realized that was a hole in my anime needs that I was missing. I didn’t realize it, at least, until I watched Studio Gainax’s incomprehensibly bizarre (but equally awesome) FLCL (also known phonetically as “Foolly Coolly”. Only 6 episodes long on a single disc, I had no idea what I was getting myself into when I started this series, but boy, am I glad I watched it.\n\nTrying to explain the plot of FLCL to someone who hasn’t watched the series would be like trying to jump into the final season of Lost without having seen the rest of the series, but here goes. Basically, it’s a coming of age story centered around 6th grade boy Naota, who is going through the typical angst and turmoils of puberty. Emotionally detached and obsessed with being “mature”, Naota is engaged in an odd relationship with the girlfriend of his older brother who is away in America playing baseball. Mamima is 19 years old but romantically obsessed with Naota and is a juvenile delinquent as well as an orphan. Naota’s life gets very odd (understatement of the century) when he is run over by a woman on a vespa armed with a bass guitar (that she uses as a weapon) named Haruhara Haruko who is an alien intent on releasing an alien force being kept captive here on Earth. After Haruhara hits Naota with her guitar, giant robots begin to sprout from his head, with each robot having increasingly bizarre and epic characteristics that Naota and Haruhara then have to battle with the help of good robot, Canti (who the townspeople apparently don’t realize is a robot) which Naota can merge with. That’s probably all anyone could ever hope to understand of the plot of the show.\n\nOne of the things the series has going for it is some stellar animation but you really should never expect less from Studio Gainax (except that whole awkward period where they ran out of money on Neon Genesis Evangelion and the show started to look like shit). These are the same people that gave us Gurren Lagann which never failed to look pretty, so it looks great. It even experiments with different visual styles for its miles a minute puns that never seem to end. It went chibi, it went with styles that I don’t know the names for, it momentarily played out as a manga, and it even went South Park for a few scenes. You also get a rocking J-Rock soundtrack that accompanies practically ever action scene, along with elements that can only be descried as hallucinogenic in nature. It was just the trippiest anime that I’ve ever watched, and I mean that as the highest compliment\n\nIf you need comprehensible story-lines and satisfying logical conclusion, you can go ahead and let this one pass on by. FLCL challenges you to comprehend what is going on and then throws its head back and laughs at your utter failure. If people thought the ending of Neon Genesis Evangelion was vague, imagine that on cocaine for nearly every scene. I like that kind of thing. I appreciate the fact that there are just a lot of things in life we’ll never comprehend and I like my art to indulge the unknowability of life. This wasn’t as great as Gurren Lagann or NGE, but those are ridiculously high standards for a 6 episode series with a barely conceivable plot to meet. If you want a good, fun romp, I give FLCL my high recommendation. It might be a niche show, but I’m part of that niche and it filled a void I never even knew existed.\n\nSeries Score: A-"
