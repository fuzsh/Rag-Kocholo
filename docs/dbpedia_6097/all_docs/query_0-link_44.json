The rules have now been relaxed to allow a few more sentences if merited, so long as they’re clearly indicated, to avoid the creative punctuation many of us have used to stay within the limit.\n\n“Charlotte’s Most Terrifying Prophecy,” from Saga VII (the 2000s) of my magnum opus Cinnimin, depicts the events of 9/11 and their immediate aftermath on that day. Cinnimin’s 23-year-old granddaughter Mancika Laurel had one close escape after another all morning, and is now heading for the waterfront with her best friend and future husband Ammiel Garfinkel.\n\nMancika and Ammiel were lucky enough to be granted access to their Tribeca apartments so they could pack. They put almost all of their luggage in a large laundry cart. For the first time in over a century, the only way out of Manhattan is by boat.\n\nThe Lower Hudson River piers were swarmed with crowds so numerous Mancika couldn’t see the waterline. Thousands upon thousands upon thousands of people stretched out in a line that seemed to go on around the entire bottom tip of the island, standing and sitting at least a dozen deep. Many of the other domestic refugees were also coated in that foul dust, and the incessant smell was barely less strong than it had been at the heartbreaking hypocenter.\n\n“Would you like some bottled water?” a middle-aged woman in an official-looking uniform asked. “We also have medical masks.”\n\n“Some good a damn mask will do me now, after hours of breathing in that stench.” Mancika tried to keep a level tone of voice, knowing this volunteer was just trying to help, though she desperately wanted to snarl. “It won’t magically cleanse my lungs, nostrils, and throat or take away the cough I’ve had all day.”\n\n“No, it can’t reverse what’s already happened, but it can minimize further side effects.”\n\n“Wouldn’t the dust immediately get into the water?” Ammiel asked.\n\nThe ten lines end here. A few more follow to finish the scene.\n\n“That stuff is everywhere.”\n\nMancika set down the grocery bags and grabbed a seventeen-ounce bottle of Poland Spring from the box. Predictably, the dust coated on her fingers got all over the cap when she untwisted it, but it weren’t as though she’d be licking it. She tilted the bottle slightly and angled it entirely inside of her mouth, to minimize the chance of it coming into any contact with that frightening dust still floating through the air.\n\n“Would anyone here like to appear on camera?”\n\nMancika turned in the direction of a dust-covered man and woman, respectively holding a videocamera and a Nikon film camera. “Take a picture of me! The entire world needs to see exactly what happened today, while the evidence is still fresh! I won’t change clothes or wash myself until someone, anyone, documents this!” She began heavily coughing.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nWelcome back to Weekend Writing Warriors and Snippet Sunday, weekly Sunday hops where writers share 8–10 sentences from a book or WIP.

Cinnimin’s 23-year-old granddaughter Mancika Laurel has had one close escape after another, most recently when she started falling into the still-burning pile of ruins. Her best friend and future husband Ammiel rescued her before the worst could happen.\n\nNow they’re going back to their apartment (where they live in separate units) to pack their belongings so they can get out of this destroyed city.\n\nMancika clung to Ammiel’s arm for dear life as they staggered towards the former dry goods store that housed their apartments. The entire walk up from the sprawling, stinking pile of destruction, she’d been unable to stop coughing. She hoped she didn’t have lung cancer or some other serious health issue from all the poisonous smorgasbord of debris she’d been inhaling for the last few hours. In her wildest, most hysterical nightmarish visions, her lungs and nostrils had become thickly coated with shards of glass and wood, human ashes and bone fragments, asbestos, pieces of electronics and wires, pulverized concrete, aluminum, fiberglass, and whatever else was mixed up in that foreboding mystery dust.\n\nHeaps of dust so thick it could be cut with a knife, commingled with twisted pieces of metal, hunks of cement, and all that other debris rendered beyond recognition, were piled up all over the streets. When Mancika briefly looked down, she realized for the first time the dust was so thick it left footprints and muffled the sound of all footsteps. People walked in complete silence not just from the shellshock, but also from the physical inability to make any noises against the pavement.\n\nSeveral buildings on their strip of Greenwich St. had gashes torn in them, and fires crackled inside some. Though their apartment didn’t appear to be burning or damaged, there were flames shooting through the windows of an old textile factory two doors down, and the roof of a low-rise brick artists’ studio three doors up had partially collapsed.\n\n“May we please go inside, Officers?” Ammiel asked the NYPD cops standing outside of their apartment.\n\nThe ten lines end there. A few more follow to finish the scene.\n\n“We live here, and we need to pack our things so we can evacuate. Both of us are on the first floor. As soon as we’re packed, we’re getting out of here.”\n\n“Have you seen my roommate?” Mancika begged. “She worked at the World Trade Center, and she must’ve gotten home by now unless she was taken to the hospital. Her name’s Courtnie Elizabeth Goldfarb, and she has blue eyes and wavy blonde hair a bit above her shoulders. She’s wearing a sky-blue dress with a knee-length hemline and elbow-length sleeves, and her purse is a denim Dolce and Gabbana embroidered with flowers. I didn’t take note of the shoes she put on this morning, but they’re probably high-heeled sandals.”\n\nAll of the cops shook their heads.\n\n“If your roommate got out of the building uninjured, she probably came here to grab her things as quickly as possible and then left,” an auburn-haired cop said. “You’ll find each other as soon as all this chaos settles down. In the meantime, the two of you need to also get in and out without dawdling. Remember, the most important things to pack are necessities, valuables, and irreplaceables.”\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nWelcome back to Weekend Writing Warriors and Snippet Sunday, weekly Sunday hops where writers share 8–10 sentences from a book or WIP. The rules have now been relaxed to allow a few more sentences if merited, so long as they’re clearly indicated, to avoid the creative punctuation many of us have used to stay within the limit.\n\n“Charlotte’s Most Terrifying Prophecy,” from Saga VII (the 2000s) of my magnum opus Cinnimin, depicts the events of 9/11 and their immediate aftermath on that day. One of the main characters, Cinnimin’s 23-year-old granddaughter Mancika Laurel, has had one close escape after another, and now courts danger again by going to the fresh pile of ruins to look for her roommate Courtnie and family friend Raizel.\n\nAmmiel is Mancika’s best friend and future husband. Later in the scene, it comes out that the cop is named Harry Baron, after his great-grandfather who was also a cop. The original Officer Baron is a character in my Russian novels.\n\nThough most people know the ruins as Ground Zero, New Yorkers called it The Pile.\n\nAs she neared the top of this macabre miniature mountain, she lost her footing and pitched forward on both knees. She screamed as she began sinking down into the toxic, tragic morass faster than she could react, inches away from a patch of flames in front of her and ominously rising smoke on both her right and left. When she put her hands out to try to break her fall, they landed right on a very hot piece of steel.\n\nIn the next instant, someone grabbed her under the shoulders from behind. As she was slowly pulled backwards, the flames in front of her leapt higher and rose to the exact place her face had been seconds ago.\n\n“It’s me, Ammiel. I’ve been so worried about you all day, and thought I might’ve lost you.” His voice was choked with emotion, and he sounded as if he were about to cry.\n\nMancika shrieked as she started falling forward again, her face millimeters away from the hot, dancing flames now starting to fan out to the right and left.\n\n“Help me!” Ammiel shouted.\n\nThe ten lines end here. A few more follow to finish the scene.\n\n“I can’t hold her and pull her out all by myself!”\n\nMancika leaned back as far as possible while Ammiel pulled her and someone behind Ammiel in turn pulled him. Her heart raced, her limbs shook, and her head pounded during the ensuing seconds that felt like hours it took to pull her back onto her feet, while that grotesque smell continued choking the air and lodging deep in her nostrils and lungs.\n\nShe very slowly turned around, careful not to bear any weight through portions of the rubble that felt unstable underfoot, and saw her second rescuer was the cop she’d spoken with twice. Ammiel grabbed her left arm and the cop grabbed her right arm as she started sinking into the macabre morass all over again.\n\n“Why did you let this woman onto the site?” the cop shouted at a group of firefighters standing nearby. “She could have gotten seriously hurt or become another casualty!”\n\n“We assumed she was a Red Cross volunteer or something,” the tallest one stuttered. “This search and rescue mission needs as many hands on deck as possible.”\n\n“I just wanted to look for two of my friends,” Mancika said as Ammiel and the cop painstakingly walked her off of the smoky, stinking mound. “I wasn’t trying to cause trouble.”\n\n“Every time I’ve seen you today, I’ve told you it’s not safe to be here. I understand your instincts to worry about missing friends, but you won’t find out what happened to them any faster by trying to do the work of trained rescue workers.” He cast his gaze back at the sprawling heap of smoking, flaming ruins and rubble as they finally stepped off of it. “It’ll take months to clear all of this away, and working on this site will be a big occupational hazard.”\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nWelcome back to Weekend Writing Warriors and Snippet Sunday, weekly Sunday hops where writers share 8–10 sentences from a book or WIP. The rules have now been relaxed to allow a few more sentences if merited, so long as they’re clearly indicated, to avoid the creative punctuation many of us have used to stay within the limit.\n\nI’ve returned to “Charlotte’s Most Terrifying Prophecy,” from Saga VII (the 2000s) of my magnum opus Cinnimin. When we last saw 23-year-old Mancika Laurel (Cinnimin’s granddaughter) in September, she had just been dragged into a pizzeria while fleeing from the collapse of the North Tower on 9/11. She tripped over a bicycle frame and was frozen by fear when she tried to pull herself back up.\n\nNow she’s gone to the still-smoking pile of ruins to look for her roommate Courtnie and family friend Raizel. Though most people know the ruins as Ground Zero, New Yorkers called it The Pile. The strange chirping Mancika hears is coming from Personal Alert Safety Systems on dead and trapped firefighters.\n\nMancika kept her hand pressed tightly over her mouth and nose as she walked on trembling legs towards the remains of the World Trade Center complex, trying her best to ignore the sharp, stiff pain in her knees. That noxious smell was still saturating the air, and dust and debris continued to float around even after the monstrous mushroom cloud had broken up and drifted off to another part of the Financial District. But even with her mouth and nostrils covered, she could still smell the commingling of burnt plastic, burnt tires, the ashes of paper, mystery chemicals, something stronger than gasoline she guessed must be jet fuel, molten metals, asbestos, burning office furniture, and the faintest base scent of whatever the dust was composed of. She had brushed off her hair, clothes, and bags repeatedly, but the foreign matter just kept cascading through the air and falling onto her all over again.\n\nIt was impossible to make heads or tails of the tragic pile of burning rubble and twisted metal ruins, which seemed to have neither beginning nor end. The remains of the city’s tallest buildings extended as far as the eye could see, representing untold thousands upon thousands upon thousands upon thousands of pounds of debris. If Mancika hadn’t witnessed what happened, she’d think an atomic bomb had detonated and destroyed everything in its immediate wake. The only thing missing was the black rain that had fallen after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nAs the sprawling mass of wreckage came closer into view, Mancika noticed some of the people walking around on top of it wore normal street clothes, not just police and firefighting uniforms. That must mean ordinary volunteers were allowed to conduct searches too.\n\nThe ten lines end here. A few more follow to finish the scene.\n\nHer heart thumped as she slowly took her first step onto it.\n\nThe moment her foot made contact with the rubble, an intense wave of heat and smoke assailed the sole of her shoe. When she put her other foot down, the same thing happened. The rubble quivered under her feet, as if it were molten lava or boiling quicksand threatening to suck her under if she couldn’t find secure footing.\n\n“Courtnie, Raizel, are you here?” She had to shout over the strange, high-pitched chirping scattered all over the site and emanating from unseen places below. “It’s me, Mancika. I’ve been watching for you all day, and I’m not going home until I know both of you are safe.”\n\nWhen there was no response, she climbed towards the top of a heap of pulverized metal, wood, and paper intermingled with shattered glass and ripped-off pieces of the tower walls. The smell became ever more oppressive with every step she ventured, and she had to dodge a few fireballs raining down from the crushed remains of the other buildings in the plaza.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nWelcome back to Weekend Writing Warriors and Snippet Sunday, weekly Sunday hops where writers share 8–10 sentences from a book or WIP. The rules have now been relaxed to allow a few more sentences if merited, so long as they’re clearly indicated, to avoid the creative punctuation many of us have used to stay within the limit.\n\nI’ve returned to “Charlotte’s Most Terrifying Prophecy,” from Saga VII (the 2000s) of my magnum opus Cinnimin. When we last left off in September, 18-year-old Raizel Brandt-van Acker was carried out of the collapsing North Tower of the World Trade Center on 9/11 with seconds left to spare, and was temporarily blinded by debris in her eyes. Soon afterwards, she was hit on the head by a heavy falling object and blacked out.\n\nRaizel revived to a violent, splitting pain emanating through her entire head and squeezing it tightly in an iron vise, alongside an overpowering wave of nausea that increased a hundredfold as soon as the foul smell hit her nostrils. Almost immediately, the throbbing, crushing pain in her legs and ribs announced itself anew, cruelly occupying every nerve in those bones and joining with the pain in her head to create a cacophonous symphony of agony.\n\nThe next thing she became aware of was the depressing grey blanket smothering the sky and all light. She had expected her first sight after regaining her vision would be the beautiful bright blue canopy interspersed with soft, pure white clouds the sky had been painted with only a few hours ago. A jolt of fear and confusion pulsed through her heart when she realized the ground was covered in piles of burning rubble and the flaming, torn-apart remains of buildings that had once stood many stories higher. This couldn’t possibly be the same plaza she had exited onto.\n\n“What happened to all the buildings? Where are we?”\n\n“To be honest, I’m no longer exactly sure where we are,” an auburn-haired woman in a green pantsuit said.\n\nThe nine lines end here. A few more follow to finish the scene.\n\n“After the second tower collapsed, we had to immediately evacuate our triage station a safe distance away. Both collapses released giant clouds of smoke and debris that extended in every direction. We’re moving everyone to NYU Downtown Hospital as fast as we can.”\n\n“Collapses? When did that happen?”\n\n“You were among the last people to evacuate the North Tower. The building was already starting to collapse when you came out. You were saved by mere seconds.”\n\nRaizel stared in quiet horror at the decimated plaza that had been full of magnificent marvels of modern engineering and architecture when she arrived this morning. She dared not wonder if there had still been people inside when all these collapses and fires happened. That was too awful to contemplate. She had to make herself believe everyone else had been saved too, or if there had been some stragglers and people too injured to move, they would all be pulled alive from the rubble by rescue teams as soon as possible. Any other scenario was too monstrous, too tragic, too horrific to be possible in this brand-new millennium that was supposed to represent the pinnacle of human progress and civilization.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
