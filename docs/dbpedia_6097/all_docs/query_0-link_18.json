        "text": "Robots is both inventive and underrated. Blue Sky Studios proved themselves with Ice Age, but it was 3 years before their next computer animated feature. If Ice Age and Ice Age: The Meltdown represent Toy Story and Toy Story 2, then Robots is the A Bug’s Life in the middle. Both are big ensembles with a large celebrity voice cast focusing on characters that are apparently easy to render. Robots is also directed by Chris Wedge, but it was originally intended to be a Christmas movie. Until the movie somehow transformed into a world populated by robots. I was 9 when my dad took my brother and I to see Robots, but I don’t think I assumed it was a Pixar movie. Even though the concept feels like something they would’ve done before WALL·E came around.\n\nThe animation is a huge improvement over Ice Age with creative designs for each sentient robot. Jokes are mostly robot puns with a lot of sneaky innuendo. The cast is a who’s who of celebrities who were popular in the 2000’s. Including but not limited to: Ewan McGregor, Robin Williams, Halle Berry, Mel Brooks, Greg Kinnear, Amanda Bynes, Drew Carey, Jennifer Coolidge, and Jim Broadbent. Stanley Tucci and Dianne Wiest voice Rodney Copperbottom’s parents who spend the opening literally making their son. The robot world isn’t given much explanation outside of robots needing parts and/or upgrades to live. Rodney is your basic aspiring inventor with dreams of making it in Robot City. It’s there that he hopes to meet his spherical hero Bigweld. Wonderbot is his faithful invention that he hopes will help his dishwasher father.\n\nWhen Rodney does go to the big city, he meets a whole motley crew of outmoded robots. Fender is essentially Williams’ entire comedy shtick rolled into one accident prone robot. Bynes shines as his tomboy sister Piper. There’s also the cynical Crank, soft-spoken Lugnut, and voiceless Diesel. All of whom are taken in by the caring Aunt Fanny (basically one big butt joke). Rodney’s main conflict is trying to find Bigweld in order to rescue less fortunate robots from the money hungry Ratchet and his evil chop shop running mother Madame Gasket. Along the way teaming up with hopeful Bigweld executive and eventual love interest Cappy. Robot City has a fun Rube Goldberg design that works for the crazy climax. The ending more so follows in DreamWorks footsteps with a big party set to “Get Up Offa that Thing.” Although lukewarm upon release, Robots shines no matter what the critics say.\n\nIce Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is when the franchise officially started going downhill. Blue Sky Studios remained relatively consistent with movies like Horton Hears a Who!, but they couldn’t let go of their most profitable property. Dawn of the Dinosaurs felt like it was jumping the shark ever since it was first announced. Since I was 14 at the time, the progressively tame and/or juvenile jokes didn’t impress me much. Yet my brother and I remained just as dedicated as we were with Pixar or DreamWorks. At least the computer animation has gotten much more realistic since The Meltdown. Scrat has another mostly disconnected subplot, but there’s more of a running theme than there was before. Now Scrat has a spunky female saber-toothed flying squirrel love interest voiced by Blue Sky animator Karen Disher.\n\nScrat and Scratte fight for the acorn in tar pits until they eventually fall in love. Except Scrat realizes he loves the acorn more. As for the herd, Manny, Sid, Deigo, Ellie, Crash, and Eddie are one big happy family that get seperated for most of the movie. Despite the franchise being named Ice Age, there’s also barely any snow. Dawn of the Dinosaurs obviously refers to the sudden appearance of presumably extinct dinosaurs. The dinosaurs have creative designs, but they feel like an easy route for a prehistoric series like this. The herd once again deals with separate problems of varying importance. Manny is extra worried about Ellie since they’re about to have a baby. Diego wants to leave the herd since he feels like he’s losing his edge. I’ll admit it’s a better storyline for him than being afraid of water.\n\nSid wants to experience motherhood, so he adopts a trio of eggs that end up being T-Rexes. A mother T-Rex takes Sid and her babies deep underground to a convoluted lost world beneath the ice. Crash and Eddie were tolerable before, but now they’re a little too annoying. Although not as insufferable as new character Buck. A crazy adventurous weasel with one eye who hunts dinosaurs. Simon Pegg is usually pretty funny, but Buck is more cringy than anything. Crash, Eddie, and even Diego’s hero worship doesn’t help. Their journey takes them through carnivorous plants, across a pit of laughing gas, above oceans of lava, and against Buck’s archenemy Rudy. Ellie giving birth to the adorable Peaches is the only highlight for me. Save for the catchy Queen Latifah song “Walk the Dinosaur,” Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is an adventure too big for its own good.\n\nPreceded by: Ice Age: The Meltdown & Followed by: Ice Age: Continental Drift\n\nIce Age: The Meltdown is a lukewarm sequel with enough to offer. Blue Sky Studios is its own unique computer animation company, but it still follows the Pixar and DreamWorks model of putting more emphasis on their biggest hit. After experimenting with Robots, Ice Age: The Meltdown caught up with everyone’s favorite unlikely herd. 4 years made a big difference with the animation going from partially rendered to practically life-like. Although The Meltdown does stray from the original with more swearing and crude jokes, I still enjoy it just as much as I did when I was 10. My brother and I even played the official video game. Scrat continues to steal the show with his own completely separate acorn chasing subplot. Such highlights include being sprayed by water, getting trapped in ice, fighting a school of vicious piranha, and dealing with a baby vulture in a nest.\n\nScrat has almost no interaction with the main characters until the end where he unknowingly saves the day, dies, and goes to acorn Heaven. Though he does survive long enough to star in another Oscar nominated short called No Time for Nuts. Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, and Denis Leary are closer than ever as Manny, Sid, and Diego. They spend more time with a community of prehistoric animals in a resort-like iceberg. The conflict this time is global warming. The Meltdown refers to a massive flood that will fill up the ice bowl they live in. Traveling to find a boat is an obvious Noah’s Ark reference. Jay Leno voices the doom bringing armadillo Fast Tony and Will Arnett confirms it as an ever-present vulture. Each herd member has their own problems to deal with.\n\nSid feels disrespected and ends up being worshipped by an out of nowhere tribe of technicolor sloths. Diego’s problems are downgraded to facing a fear of water. Only Manny is dealing with something more massive. When everyone convinces him he’s the last mammoth, he meets a female mammoth named Ellie. Since Ice Age was a bit of a dude fest, it was nice to have Queen Latifah join the cast. Ellie is a sweet, but delusional mammoth who thinks she’s a possum. Her twin brothers Crash and Eddie are a fun-loving pair that aren’t too annoying. Though it is odd to have Seann William Scott or Josh Peck not paired with their usual co-stars. Their new herd faces broken ice, precarious cliffs, and two mindless prehistoric sea serpents. Manny’s primary goal is to save the species, but his relationship with Ellie grows the way you’d expect. Ice Age: The Meltdown is the only sequel that has heart and a relatively believable story.\n\nPreceded by: Ice Age & Followed by: Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs\n\nIce Age brings a little warmth to the coldest period in history. Before Disney unfairly shut it down, Blue Sky Studios was my third favorite computer animation company. Ice Age isn’t a huge game changer, but it was suitable competition for Pixar and DreamWorks. Earning it an early Academy Award nomination for Best Animated Feature. The idea for Ice Age is as old as the now defunct 90’s 20th Century Fox animation studio. It was originally meant to be a more dramatic traditionally animated adventure with Don Bluth in mind. Although it would’ve been different, I’m glad they switched to a more comedic computer animated buddy film.\n\nBlue Sky got its start as a special effects company before evolving into a movie studio. Director Chris Wedge showed what he could do with the Oscar winning short film Bunny, but Ice Age was a major step forward for computer animated animals. Although crude by today’s standards, it was unique for featuring a cast of talking prehistoric creatures. I’ll never forget seeing the movie for the first time when I was 6. My dad intended to take my brother and I to Ice Age, but we ended up seeing The Time Machine instead when the former was sold out. Ice Age has been a childhood favorite ever since that little setback was straightened out…\n\nIce Age isn’t exactly an accurate depiction of the Pleistocene era. Aside from their stylized appearances, many of the prehistoric animals didn’t co-exist. Yet animators closely studied natural history museums in order to correctly capture the time period. Snow and ice feels cold without being overly realistic. Ice Age begins in the snow with its breakout character front and center. Scrat is a Cronopio, or saber-toothed squirrel that’s more like a cross between a squirrel and a rat. Although intended as a one off character, Scrat is too fun not to have his own subplot throughout the movie. Only occasionally interacting with the main characters. Scrat is a mute fidgety creature voiced by Chris Wedge himself. All he wants is a spot to bury his beloved acorn, but he constantly faces humorous setbacks.\n\nSuch highlights include causing a crack in the ice that creates a massive avalanche, getting struck by lightning, popping his acorn in a fire, and being unfrozen 20,000 years in the future. He even stars in the Oscar nominated short Gone Nutty. A whole herd of prehistoric animals are only seen in an opening migration. It’s there that we’re introduced to the most unlikely herd you’ll ever see. Manfred, or Manny represents the ice age the best as a well known woolly mammoth. He’s first depicted as a grumpy loner who heads away from civilization. Despite mostly being known for TV, Ray Romano has the deep voice of an elephant mixed with witty sarcasm. Manny seems mean at first, but there’s really a big heart hidden under all that fur. His patience is really tested when Sid the Sloth enters his life.\n\nSid is a Megalonyx, or ground sloth that I never heard of before the movie. Although you’d expect a sloth to be slow, John Leguizamo turns him into a blabbermouth with a distinct lisp. Sid is abandoned by his own family and chased by angry prehistoric rhinos voiced by Stephen Root and Cedric the Entertainer. They’re forever stuck together when Manny saves his life, but their odd couple dynamic is only complete when Diego joins them. Diego is a Smilodon, commonly known as a saber-toothed tiger. As a predator, Diego’s motivations are a lot more complex. Only Denis Leary is sardonic enough to keep you questioning his true intentions. Diego is secretly working for throwaway villain Soto. Your basic predator out for revenge on mankind.\n\nIce Age is the only film in the franchise to depict early humans. Their tribe is ambushed by Soto and his pack of distinct saber-toothed tigers. Diedrich Bader is the smarter Oscar, Alan Tudyk is the fatter Lenny, and Jack Black voices his first animated character as the unhinged Zeke. Diego goes after the chief’s infant son Roshan, but fails to attack his mother. Ice Age is a hilarious comedy, but her sacrifice is what really gives the movie heart. Diego smooth talks his way into the herd by promising to find the kid’s father. Ice Age is basically Three Men and a Baby with a mammoth, sloth, and saber. Since the cast was allowed to improvise, most scenes are comedy gold. I couldn’t stop laughing at the diaper changing scene and the melon scene that follows. Their encounter with dottos is especially funny since they keep dying.\n\nThe frozen tundra is only seen again at the 39 minute mark. The herd starts to bond more in a fun montage set to “Send Me on My Way” by Rusted Root. They eventually enter a cave that correctly predicts every sequel in the franchise. Leading to a thrilling ice sliding sequence. Sid is the same lovable doofus by the end, but Manny and even Diego really start to care about the kid overtime. Manny’s most touching scene is reliving past trauma through cave drawings. After Manny saves him from falling into lava, Diego changes when he chooses his new herd over his old pack. Diego was supposed to die, but the franchise wouldn’t be the same without him. When the kid is returned, Manny, Sid, and Diego head off into the sunset joking about global warming. Ice Age is uncommon and exactly what an up and coming animation studio needed to become successful.\n\nFollowed by: Ice Age: The Meltdown\n\nKing Kong (2005) is the most affectionate remake I’ve ever seen. After the immense success of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, everyone wondered what Oscar winning director Peter Jackson would do next. I don’t think anyone was expecting the third remake of a 1933 classic. As I said in my King Kong (1976) review, the rights were split between two seperate studios. Universal first approached Jackson with a Creature from the Black Lagoon remake in the 90’s, but changed their strategy when they learned King Kong (1933) was his favorite movie of all time. Even as a child Jackson had nothing but sympathy for the big ape. Skull Island is actually referenced in his movie Braindead.\n\nWhen Godzilla (1998) failed and other ape remakes started to come out, production was halted. Until The Return of the King made Jackson the most bankable director in Hollywood. King Kong (2005) is a rare passionate remake made with nothing but love and respect for the original. All Jackson did was give it the same level of dedication he did with The Lord of the Rings. Detail in every frame, breathtaking special effects, three-dimensional characters, and a lengthy 3 hour & 21 minute runtime. King Kong (2005) was a major obsession for my brother and I growing up. After our mom showed us the original, the three of us saw the remake in theaters and fell in love with it. I had a Kong doll, a Skull Island field guide, and my brother was especially obsessed with completing the official tie-in video game…\n\nKing Kong (2005) is part homage, part epic. Only Peter Jackson could take an hour and a half film and make it three hours. Even though there are several new additions that could’ve been trimmed down or removed, I can safely say I was never bored. The perfect three-act structure is maintained with each act being roughly an hour long. That means more than an hour until we finally get a glimpse of Kong. In the meantime, an almost excessive amount of time is spent in New York and on a very long boat ride. Unlike the 1976 remake, King Kong (2005) is a period piece set in 1933 like the original. Basic ideas are either elaborated upon or given added depth. Ann Darrow is now a struggling vaudeville actress who falls on hard times during the Great Depression. Naomi Watts looks the part of the classic beautiful blonde woman, but Ann is more than just a pretty face. Her motivation for accepting a movie role is much more understandable.\n\nCarl Denham has the same passionate motivation to complete his picture on Skull Island, but his recklessness gets him blacklisted and nearly arrested. Casting singer/comedian Jack Black as the iconic 1930’s director is one of the most bizzare casting choices of all time. Most of the time I can accept his Orson Welles-esque performance, but other times it feels like he could go full School of Rock any minute. Denham hires Ann with the promise that she’ll meet her favorite playwright. Rather than a strapping first mate action hero, Jack Driscoll is now an average screenwriter forced to stay on the Venture. Adrien Brody is more than capable of playing the charming love interest and the unlikely hero. The Venture is full of mystery and a crew with far more characterization.\n\nCaptain Englehorn is now a no-nonsense hands on German ship captain played by Thomas Kretschmann. Colin Hanks plays Carl’s undervalued personal assistant Preston. Jamie Bell is given an entire subplot as a troublemaking teenager named Jimmy who wants to prove himself. Evan Parke plays his African American mentor Hayes who has World War I training. Andy Serkis does double duty by physically playing the crusty ship’s cook Lumpy. Lord of the Rings composer Howard Shore originally returned before he was replaced by James Newton Howard. The role of strapping action hero is literally filled by Kyle Chandler as famous actor Bruce Baxter. Some of the more sexist dialogue from the original is cleverly worked into the remake as a scene in Denham’s picture. Jack has nothing but respect for Ann as he writes her a play and they fall in love. When they finally reach Skull Island, Englehorn is adamant about turning back.\n\nDenham leads a small crew through what appears to be the ruins of a lost civilization. The always necessary island natives are a no win situation no matter the interpretation. These natives are much more tribal and savage. Their skin is dark brown, but each native is actually portrayed by a variety of non-white ethnicities. They kill crew members before returning to capture Ann. Her sacrifice is grander with a complex bridge extending from their great wall. Kong is at first veiled in shadow, but his first full appearance doesn’t disappoint. Kong is often labeled a monster due to his burly upright appearance. Jackson instead made the creative decision to focus on a Kong that was essentially a massive 25 foot tall silverback gorilla. This Kong is still a little monstrous with black fur, sharp teeth, and many battle scars. My very in-depth Skull Island field guide explains Kong’s origin as a 100 year old Megaprimatus who is the last of his kind.\n\nThis is by far the most sympathetic King Kong ever put to film. His relationship with Ann is more than mere infatuation. Ann screams at first, but they come to form a deep mutual understanding. She even surprisingly makes him laugh by performing her vaudeville routine. Kong’s lifelike ape mannerisms are thanks to the always brilliant stop-motion work of Andy Serkis. After Gollum, Serkis was sure to bring just as much dedication to even the most subtle gorilla movements. The CGI is absolutely stunning on Kong, Skull Island, and a 1930’s New York. It’s part of the reason King Kong (2005) was the most expensive movie made at the time. Just as much detail is given to the dinosaurs that inhabit Skull Island. Each with a fictional name like Vastatosaurus rex that separates it a bit from something like Jurassic Park.\n\nThe only iffy effect is a herd of stampeding Brontosaurus baxteri that Denham and his crew are somehow able to survive. They’re also chased by raptor-like Venatosaurus saevidicus. Other terrifying creatures like the Piranhadon didn’t make the final cut. What did make the final cut was a scene that was originally intended for the 1933 original. After Kong overturns a log with the crew, they fall into a disturbing pit full of giant insects. The Carnictis worm thing that eats Lumpy is particularly icky. King Kong (2005) doesn’t recreate everything, but the fight between Kong and a T-Rex was an absolute must. The primal fight is increased big time with not one, not two, but three V. Rexes against Kong. It’s a truly exciting match that sees Kong juggle Ann from his hands to his feet in a desperate attempt to fend off the beasts. Each are killed one by one until Kong breaks the last ones jaw just like the original. Concluding with a satisfying chest pound.\n\nAnn willingly stays with Kong and even teaches him the sign for beautiful. She’s still rescued by Jack when Kong is distracted by attacking rat-bats called Terapusmordax. Although I still wouldn’t label him a villain, Denham does begin to make rash decisions when his camera is destroyed. He lures Kong to the wall where the natives are nowhere to be seen. Not that Kong doesn’t kill a few of the attacking crewmembers. When stunned by chloroform, Denham makes his classic declaration to put “Kong, the Eighth Wonder of the World!” on broadway. The New York show has all the familiar beats of Denham making a statement, Kong chained up on stage, and everyone in town coming to see it. Since Ann feels for Kong, she doesn’t take part in the show. A stage number pays homage to the dancing natives, but Kong breaking loose is now caused by another actress playing Ann. Kong rampages through the city with most of his anger focused on Jack. Kong does grab blonde women that look like Ann, but he drops them from a safer distance.\n\nUnlike any other interpretation, Ann walks directly to Kong and they enjoy a moment together before the military arrives. Kong makes his way to an epic climax atop the Empire State Building. The sequence honors the original by having Peter Jackson cameo as an airplane pilot. The fight is both thrilling and emotional. Much like the V. Rex battle, Kong manages to take out three airplanes instead of one. Ann desperately pleading for them to stop and Kong falling to his death makes me cry everytime. In fact, Jackson loves Kong so much that he created an alternate ending where he survives just for the video game. Unfortunately, Kong meets his iconic fate and Denham delivers his final line that “It wasn’t the airplanes, it was Beauty killed the Beast.” Something Fay Wray nearly said before passing away. Although not the same kind of Academy Awards favorite as The Lord of the Rings trilogy, King Kong (2005) nevertheless won 3 Oscars. Best Sound Editing, Sound Mixing, and of course Visual Effects. King Kong (2005) is a larger than life companion piece that appreciates cinematic history.\n\nRemake of: King Kong (1933)"
