It was expected to be the studio's big summer movie after Johnny Depp's $100 million budget \"Transcendence\" flopped. <span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\"> </span>\n\n<p class=\"p1\">I think we know the real reason the reported $175 million Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis movie was moved.\n\n<p class=\"p1\">\"Jupiter Ascending\" is terrible.\n\n<p class=\"p1\">Don't take my word for it.\n\n<p class=\"p3\">In addition to press, there was a number of general audience members in attendance who received free advance tickets to the media screening. (This is normal. You can usually get these through websites like GoFobo.)<span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\"> </span>\n\n<p class=\"p3\">Here are some of the things viewers were saying as they headed out of the screening:\n\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\"It wasn't bad ... it was horrible.\"\n\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\"It was embarrassing.\"\n\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\"That's what they spent $150 million to $200 million on?\"\n\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\"I can't even explain the plot. You kill humans &#133; so you can use their genes?\" (more on this in a bit)\n\n<p class=\"p1\">The movie follows Kunis as Jupiter Jones, your not-so-average looking maid who cleans houses for a living with her obnoxious Russian family. One day, she finds out there's a bunch of other species living outside of Earth and that she's actually the ruler of our planet. Two groups of different people, one led by Titus (Douglas Booth) and another by Balem (Eddie Redmayne), are out to capture and murder her so they can have control of the planet.\n\n<p class=\"p1\">Why do they want control of the planet? To harvest humans. The aliens have apparently been using human cells to create a regeneration serum for some time.\n\n<p class=\"p1\">Yep. That's it. The whole movie is about aliens wanting to preserve their youth by killing humans.<span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\"> </span>\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\"><img src=\"http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/54d3769e6bb3f7c005836c98-1200-924/jupiter-ascending-3.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"jupiter ascending\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">In a point that's sort of glossed over quickly, but better explained in the film's production notes, Jupiter is what is known as a \"recurrence.\" She's born with the exact genetic DNA as a royal that just passed away and for some reason this now makes her the reincarnation of that person.</span></span>\n\n<p class=\"p1\">But, unless I missed something, it's not clear how anyone knows Jupiter even exists. It's not like her father or mother were royalty. Jupiter has no clue she's royalty, and once she learns she is, she doesn't find out that she has any secret, magical powers. So the basic premise of the film, where aliens are worried about Jupiter, a lowly, humble, toilet scrubber overthrowing all of them, is pretty thin. <span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\"> </span>\n\n<p class=\"p1\">I don't remember the last time I've said \"What is going on right now?\" (not in those actual words) so many times during a film screening to myself. This isn't because I couldn't follow the movie's plot, it was just because what was occurring on screen: the dialogue, the acting, the strange-looking characters were all so bizarre at points that there was no other way to react.<span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\"> </span>\n\n<p class=\"p1\">Here are a few of the things I'm talking about:\n\n<p class=\"p1\">1. There's a ridiculous bee scene\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><img src=\"http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/54d373f5ecad040e2c592761-1200-600/jupiter-ascending-bees-1.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"jupiter ascending bees\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Early on, when Jupiter is learning she's royal, there's a scene where a group of bees start to follow her. (Why are there bees hanging around? Why not?) The group slowly builds until there's a giant swarm surrounding her, but not stinging. When she moves her arms, they move with her. When she asks why they do that, you're sitting there waiting for a good response. Instead, the answer we receive is that the bees sense royalty. The audience cracked up at this in disbelief. To add insult to injury, this was followed up with the line, \"Bees don't lie.\" </span>\n\n<p class=\"p1\">I've never wanted to relive the Nicolas Cage bee scene from the 2006 \"Wicker Man\" remake, but this was all I could think of:\n\n<biembeddedobject id=\"f6cdf464-0b30-47b7-864b-1a385077b472\"></biembeddedobject>\n\n<p class=\"embed-spacer\"> 2. Random egg selling\n\n<p class=\"embed-spacer\"><img src=\"http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/54d373646da811045554bbea-1200-600/jupiter-jones-mila-kunis-1.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"jupiter jones mila kunis\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">There's a crazy subplot early in the film where Jupiter considers selling her own eggs at the behest of her sleazy cousin (you can't make this stuff up) to make some easy cash. He wants to buy a big flat screen TV and Jupiter has her sights on a $4,000 telescope on eBay. What? </span>\n\n<p class=\"p1\">3. Mila Kunis slaps a sanitary pad onto Channing Tatum to patch up a wound.\n\n<p class=\"p1\">I guess this was supposed to be humorous. It's not. It's kind of just gross, especially when Sean Bean, who plays a secondary character, later tears it off on screen, waving it at Kunis. <span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\"> </span>\n\n<p class=\"p1\">4. Channing Tatum is a half-human, half-wolf\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><img src=\"http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/54d374dc6da8111f5b54bbea-1200-600/channing-tatum-jupiter-ascending-1.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"channing tatum jupiter ascending\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">You read that right. He doesn't have a tail, but he does have a keen sense of smell, some pointed ears, and, yes, he does growl a few times in film. Honestly, he looks ridiculous, and because of that, and some added eyeliner, it's difficult to take Tatum, seriously. Even his name is Caine, an obvious reference to canine. </span>\n\n<p class=\"p1\">5. Kunis' character continually hits on half-wolf Tatum, and it makes for the most awkward screen time and dialogue ever\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><img src=\"http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/54d3723eecad040b2959275e-1200-600/jupiter-caine-jupiter-ascending-1.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"jupiter caine jupiter ascending\">The two actors have chemistry; however, the romance between the two feels so overtly forced, even the audience could tell. There's a scene in the movie where Jupiter says she's into Caine. Here's how that conversation goes down.\n\n<p class=\"p1\">Caine: \"I have more in common with dogs than I do with you.\"\n\n<p class=\"p1\">Jupiter: \"I love dogs.\"\n\n<p class=\"p1\">The audience burst out laughing at this. Later in the film, there's even an overt reference to \"Beauty and the Beast,\" to describe their relationship.\n\n<p class=\"p1\">6. The creatures are terrifying.\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><img src=\"http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/54d373256bb3f75c7b836c98-1200-600/jupiter-ascending-aliens-1.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"jupiter ascending aliens\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">An early scene in the film shows a group of short aliens trying to abduct a woman. These are some of the creepiest things I've ever seen on screen, and it's probably why you haven't seen a trace of them in marketing. The film's production notes say they're supposed to \"resemble classic grey ETs.\" </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\"> </span>\n\n<p class=\"p1\">The same goes for a bizarre lizard/dragon mashup with wings. <span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\"> </span><img src=\"http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/54d3726c6da8112e4f54bbed-1200-600/jupiter-ascending-monster-1.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"jupiter ascending monster\" style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">\n\n<p class=\"p1\">Some of the characters just look like knockoffs of other sci-fi animals. There's an elephant-looking creature that pops up a few times that looks like a mix between Ten Numb and Max Webo from \"Star Wars.\"\n\n<p class=\"p1\">You can sort of see him here in the background.<img src=\"http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/54d372b169beddad3c59275e-1200-667/jupiter-ascending-elephant-creature.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"jupiter ascending elephant creature\" style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">\n\n<p class=\"p1\">7. And then there's Eddie Redmayne's character, Balem Abrasax, who is on a completely different level of crazy in this film.\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><img src=\"http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/54d372db6bb3f74177836c9f-1200-600/eddie-redmayne-jupiter-ascending-1.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"eddie redmayne jupiter ascending\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">After a masterful Oscar-nominated performance in 2014's \"The Theory of Everything,\" Redmayne gives a pitifully poor performance as a spoiled brat. He comes across as a fragile, strange creature, who speaks in eerily calm, creepy whispers. Then there would be these disjointed moments when he would scream out loud at people. Audiences laughed every time this occurred. </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\"> </span>\n\n<p class=\"p1\">It was as if Redmayne was actually channelling the awkwardness of Michael Sheen's vampire character Aro in the \"Twilight\" movies. It was essentially the same role.\n\n<biembeddedobject id=\"4cd18b59-7ea7-4861-8cc5-04e5a4d124f3\"></biembeddedobject>"
