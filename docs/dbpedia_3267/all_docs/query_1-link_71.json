        "text": "Rating: 1 out of 5 stars\n\nGenre: Science Fiction, Fantasy, Adventure\n\nRun Time: 2 hours 7 minutes, Rated PG-13\n\nStarring: Mila Kunis, Channing Tatum, Eddie Redmayne, Sean Bean, Douglas Booth, Tuppence Middleton\n\nWritten and Directed by Andy & Lana Wachowski (Cloud Atlas, Speed Racer, The Matrix Trilogy)\n\nâ€‹Harsh criticism is nothing the Wachowski Siblings haven't dealt with before...they are used to being bashed. Their last film, Cloud Atlas, was a box office flop and was universally hammered by critics (for the most part anyways...I on the other hand, stand by naming it not only a good film, but the best film of 2012). And if I found Cloud Atlas to be akin to a mesmerizing albeit ambitious acrobat act, where spinning plates are skillfully and beautifully placed on each appendage one by one in perfect symmetry and union, never once allowing any of them fall, then the Wachowski's latest effort, Jupiter Ascending (opening today), can be likened to a bull rushing full-speed into a china shop."
