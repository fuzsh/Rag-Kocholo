        "text": "We sat down with the gorgeous young talent and asked him who would be the actor or actress he would love to work with. And without being presumptuous, we did think he would answer along the lines of Jennifer Lawrence, Margot Robbie, or maybe Ryan Gosling or Daniel Craig, so imagine our surprise when he came up with ….a much loved British actress.\n\n“I have always wanted to work with Judy Dench and that hasn’t happened yet, so that would be fun”. How, erm, dench!\n\nDouglas obviously loved watching Birdman because he added that he would also like to work with Michael Keaton and Edward Norton – in fact all of the film’s cast.\n\nWe asked him what he thought about the potential Oscar chances of his Jupiter Ascending co-star Eddie Redmayne for his performance in “The Theory of Everything”.\n\n“I think he [Eddie] is definitely the front runner….yes, him and Benedict, hopefully one of them will cross the line!”"
