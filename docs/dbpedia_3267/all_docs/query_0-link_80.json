        "text": "'Jupiter Ascending' sinks like a stone\n\nEarly on in the deeply misguided sci-fi epic \"Jupiter Ascending\" you know you're going to be in for a long cinematic ride when one a character whips out a sanitary napkin out of a car's glove box and uses it to stop our hunky hero's bleeding wound.\n\n\"Thank god the owner of this car was a woman,\" observes Mila Kunis as she whips out said feminine hygiene product.\n\nThat the head-slapping sanitary napkin scene isn't the most (unintentionally?) funny moment in \"Jupiter Ascending\" is testament to the film's ineptitude. That award goes to Eddie Redmayne's over-the-top, scenery-chewing performance as the intergalactic villain.\n\nMost of Redmayne's performance involves him either him whispering out threats to minions or throwing hissy fits. With his on-screen swishing and vamping for the screen, Redmayne resembles a male model throwing a tantrum because he didn't get the right salad rather than an intergalactic force capable of destroying a planet.\n\nTo describe the plot of \"Jupiter Ascending\" is a losing proposition. It involves an intergalactic corporation/empire that runs like a cross between Ancient Rome and a Fortune 500 company.\n\nEarth, it seems, is just another ledger on the asset sheet waiting to get plundered for its resources. There are subplots about clones, reincarnation, intergalactic bounty hunters, family feuds and dynastic politics.\n\nNone of this is ever remotely interesting even when the overstuffed plot is interrupted by a series of repetitive action scenes revolving around Channing Tatum flying around in some sort of gravity boots that make him look like a hyperactive rollerblader.\n\nTatum plays an intergalactic bounty hunter tasked to hunt down Earth-bound Jupiter Jones (Kunis), who we learn after some tortuous exposition is some sort of reincarnated queen at the center of infighting among a dysfunctional family.\n\nThe problem here is that, at least written and directed by the Wachowski siblings, \"Jupiter Ascending\" feels like a series of vaguely connected ideas that sounded cool on paper but never come together on screen.\n\nIt's clear the Wachowskis want to say something about corporate greed, how the super rich feed on the masses and the importance of standing up to power.\n\nBut those messages are weighed down by so much plodding storytelling, the Wachowskis' political points sink like a stone.\n\nTake one unfunny sequence in which Jupiter tries to file some paperwork to claim her inheritance in some sort of intergalactic government bureaucracy. The sequence drags on for what feels like an eternity and adds nothing to the story.\n\nKunis, who when used properly can be charismatic, isn't given much to do here aside from run around and get saved by Tatum's hunky bounty hunter with pointy ears.\n\nIt is amusing, though, to see the plot twist itself into knots to get Tatum into situations where he is required to take off his shirt —something the movie does frequently.\n\nThe Wachowskis' track record has been spotty. They've made great movies such as the thriller \"Bound\" and the sci-fi epic \"Cloud Atlas,\" some so-so films such as \"The Matrix\" and some awful efforts such as (gulp) \"Speed Racer.\"\n\nSadly, you can add \"Jupiter Ascending\" to the awful list.\n\n★ ½ ☆ ☆\n\n'Jupiter Ascending'\n\nNow playing: Tulare Galaxy 10; Visalia Stadium 10\n\nMPAA rating: PG-13 for some violence, sequences of sci-fi action, some suggestive content and partial nudity\n\nFilm facts: Stars Mila Kunis, Channing Tatum, Eddie Redmayne, Sean Bean and Douglas Booth. Directed by Andy Wachowski and Lana Wachowski. 123 minutes."
