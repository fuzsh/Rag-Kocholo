        "text": "On February 6th, the movie Jupiter Ascending (PG-13) hit theaters. As a film created by the Wachowski siblings (the minds who brought us movies like The Matrix (1999), V for Vendetta (2005), and Cloud Atlas (2012)), the stakes set for this movie by its predecessors were high. With this in mind, Jupiter Ascending is, oddly enough, both a success and a failure.\n\nIn the past, the Wachowskis have brought audiences sci-fi thrillers rife with intellectual significance and mental intrigue. Jupiter Ascending delivers nothing of the sort. Imagine a movie comprised of all of the ridiculous characters and places you dreamed up as a child — bring those together with a $176 million budget and you get Jupiter Ascending. While this has been referred to as a flaw by numerous film critics, it isn’t as negative a thing as one might expect. It instead adds a strange sort of appeal to the film, placing it in a similar rank of movie with cult classics like Labyrinth (1986) and the Fifth Element (1997).\n\nThe film follows Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) as she leaves Earth and goes to space in order to save it and her family from the clutches of greedy space royals who each wish to claim it as their own. Watching this movie inspires nostalgia and enjoyment – its carefree attitude when handling its plot (at least when it recalls that is has a plot) is similar to the sci-fi movies of the past. The characters, while ridiculous, are fun to watch and easy to root for as they fight it out over Earth, which is sought after by aliens due to its abundance of the galaxy’s most valuable resource: lives (which are needed to create a youth serum produced and used by the most elite to maintain their immortality).\n\nAs a plus, it is female led. According to the LA Times, only 15% of lead characters in movies made in 2014 are female. Forget movies dominated by men — it is important for female viewers to have the chance to watch somebody of their own sex kick some butt for once (excusing the scene where the Jupiter is placed in a damsel in distress situation, but you get my point). Along with the leading lady, there are numerous other female characters that break this mold in the film, including Diomaka Tsing, a female spaceship captain, who is responsible for saving everybody’s lives.\n\nThe heroine of the story, Jupiter, has a fairy tale storyline, starting out as a maid from humble origins and eventually discovering that she is in fact the reincarnation of an intergalactic matriarch. Her love interest, Caine (Channing Tatum), is a space werewolf hybrid bounty hunter with a tragic desire to find a pack who has — wait for it — a pair of hovering roller skates. He, naturally, immediately becomes attached to Jupiter.\n\nTheir relationship may be predictable and cheesy but, hey, who can help rooting for them? Especially when the writers seize opportunities for golden lines such as “Who’s a good boy?” and ply audiences with a 15-minute scene featuring Channing Tatum’s bare chest.\n\nIn addition to the space princess and her dog-man boyfriend, there are other characters that highlight this movie. Stinger (Sean Bean), who is an ex-soldier, lives in a house covered in bees (yes, you read that correctly). Titus Abrasax (Douglas Booth), a power-hungry playboy who is third-in-line for the intergalactic throne, has a major Oedipus complex and murderous tendencies. Another, and my personal favorite at that, is Balem Abrasax (Academy Award winner Eddie Redmayne), the bitter son of Jupiter’s former reincarnation who will stop at nothing to claim Earth. He brings a flair of the dramatic to the story with runway-style outfits and a Voldemort esque attitude, holding his head high and looking down on everyone around him, including his younger sister, Kalique, and brother, aforementioned Titus.\n\nAlong with colorful and imaginative characters, the set, effects, and costume and creature designs are breathtaking and whimsical. Creatures such as the “reptilians” and the “tiny green men” inspire childlike joy, clearly drawn from classic aliens and monsters of the past.\n\nAccording to InStyle, approximately 1.3 million Swarovski crystals were used to create the runway-ready outfits worn by Mila Kunis and even Eddie Redmayne. In a scene where Jupiter is about to be tricked into an unfortunate political marriage, her dress has been edited so that the numerous blossoms on it appear to be blooming.\n\nTo compliment the detailed effects, there were enough fight sequences in Jupiter Ascending to please even the most action-hungry of people. There were matrix-caliber dodges, loud explosions, and even a fight between Caine and a UFO in the streets of Chicago."
