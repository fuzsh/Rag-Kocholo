Read on for more.\n\nBy PaulRom -\n\nFiled Under: Sci-Fi\n\nSource: Variety\n\nAccording to Variety, young actor Douglas Booth has signed on to join the already impressive cast for Andy and Lana Wachowski's (The Matrix) upcoming sci-fi film Jupiter Ascending. Channing Tatum, Mila Kunis, Eddie Redmayne and Sean Bean (who was announced earlier this week) are also on board to star in the Warner Bros.-distributed movie, which will also be written by The Wachowskis. Booth will soon be seen in Paramount Pictures and Darren Aronofsky's Biblical epic Noah, and he (as well as Redmayne, coincidentally) was reportedly up for the Harry Osborn role in The Amazing Spider-Man 2. Specifics on his character in the film are currently unknown. Jupiter Ascending \"is set in a time where humans are at the bottom of the evolutionary ladder, and it follows a woman who has been targeted for assassination by the queen of the universe.\" No release date has been set yet, and the film is set to be released in 3D.\n\nFollow @PaulRomCBM\n\nDISCLAIMER: ComicBookMovie.com is protected under the DMCA (Digital Millenium Copyright Act) and...
