        "text": "Jupiter Ascending\n\nThereâ€™s no excuse for actively willing a film to fail, but sometimes it just seems written in the stars â€“ when all the planets align for a colossal mess of galactic proportions â€“ and, in that instance, all you can do is hope that the film is so ludicrous in its concept and execution that it becomes that rare creation: a film so unintentionally hilarious, it provides the funniest movie experience of the year. With Channing Tatumâ€™s Spock ears and gravity roller skates, Eddie Redmayne playing a raspy villainous fopp and Sean Bean playing a half-man-half-bee (oh yes), it seemed that Jupiter Ascending couldnâ€™t fail to fail."
