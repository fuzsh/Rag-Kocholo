        "text": "LATEST NEWS\n\n'Skyfall' DP Roger Deakins Wins ASC's Best Cinematography Award\n\nFinally, a celebrated win for the cinematographer who shot the best looking movie of 2012! It's time for the American Society of Cinematographers award, honoring the talented people behind the camera. The 27th Annual ASC Outstanding Achievement Awards were held last night in Hollywood, and the big 2013 winner was Roger Deakins, taking top prize for his work on James Bond's Skyfall. Deakins just lost the BAFTA award to DP Claudio Miranda for Life of Pi this weekend, but this is finally a deserving win, the one where even his peers have come to recognize how stunning the cinematography in Skyfall really is. Bravo!\n\nBen Affleck & 'Argo' Win Best Director & Film at 2013 BAFTA Awards\n\nAffleck wins again! Can Argo be stopped? What a year of awards! This weekend in London, the BAFTA (or British Academy of Film and Television Arts) held their annual show, the BAFTA Awards, honoring the finest in film and television from 2012. This year's biggest winner was quite a surprise, but nonetheless yet another sweet victory. Ben Affleck and Argo won Best Director and Best Film, along with Best Editing, but nothing else. Most of the other technical wins were split up between Tom Hooper's Les Miserables and Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained, with a few for Amour and Silver Linings Playbook snuck in there.\n\nWriters Kasdan & Kinberg Chat Vague 'Star Wars' Details & Fandom\n\n\"There was a chance to capture some of the spirit of the original trilogy that I'd worked on. I thought there's an audience out there -- my grandchildren, lots of original Star Wars people -- and there always will be. It's only good that we try to do some more great ones.\" After all the news about Star Wars recently, I'm glad we get to hear some updates directly from the people involved. Thanks to a tip from SlashFilm, it was IGN who was lucky enough to catch both Star Wars screenwriters Lawrence Kasdan and Simon Kinberg at the Final Draft Big Break screenwriting awards and get some interesting, if not vague, quotes out of them.\n\n'Noah' Star Douglas Booth Joins Tatum & Kunis in 'Jupiter Ascending'\n\nAndy and Lana Wachowski's Cloud Atlas was my favorite movie of 2012, but it was a total dud at the box office. The sweeping connected story of love, rebellion and redemption didn't connect with a mass audience at all, so the filmmaking duo is returning to their roots: the science fiction action genre. Up next is Jupiter Ascending, an epic action tale starring Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis, that recently added \"Game of Thrones\" star Sean Bean and Les Mis actor Eddie Redmayne to its cast. Now Variety reports that another actor has hopped aboard the project, as Douglas Booth just signed on for an unknown role. More below.\n\n'Hot Tub Time Machine' Director Gets 'Shore Leave' for DreamWorks\n\nFollowing his retro comedy Hot Tub Time Machine, director Steve Pink has been busy setting up new projects. In addition to being at the helm of Bad Santa 2, the filmmaker is also finishing a remake of About Last Night, or rather a new adaptation of David Mamet's play Sexual Perversity in Chicago on which the 80s film was based, and also a potential sequel to the aforementioned time traveling jacuzzi film (but without John Cusack). Now Deadline has word that Pink is taking Shore Leave at DreamWorks, another male-driven comedy that throws some action into the mix this time, but the story is currently under wraps.\n\nMichael Shannon, Nicholas Hoult & Two More Join 'Young Ones' Sci-Fi\n\nIt's been over a year since we heard anything about the indie sci-fi film called Young Ones being written and directed by Jake Paltrow, brother of actress Gwyneth Paltrow, who directed The Good Night in 2007. The story is set in a future were water has become a rare and precious resource, and violence has erupted in this drastically different society. Now Variety has word that Nicholas Hoult, Michael Shannon and Kodi Smit-McPhee (Let Me In) have all joined the cast along with once attached Elle Fanning who has been confirmed for a role in the film looking to start production in the South African desert next month.\n\nUniversal and Illumination Remaking 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas'\n\nAfter teaming up to bring Dr. Seuss' tales such as The Lorax and Horton Hears a Who to the big screen, Universal Pictures and Illuminaton Entertainment are teaming up again to animate one of the authors rhyming stories. However, this time will mark the first collaboration adapting a book that has already seen two different versions made. Variety reports How the Grinch Stole Christmas is on the docket for an animated adaptation that will be more faithful to the book, which actually lends itself better to the three act structure of a film, making it so less original material has to be created to pad out a feature film adaptation.\n\nActress Ellen Page To Make Her Directorial Debut with 'Miss Stevens'\n\nShe's played a precocious pregnant teen in Juno, a legitimate superhero in X-Men 3, a wannabe superhero in Super, and a dream architect in Inception, but now Ellen Page is taking on her most challenging role yet: director. Deadline reports the 25-year-old actress is stepping behind the camera to make her directorial debut on a movie called Miss Stevens, and she's secured Scary Movie maven Anna Faris to play the title role. Julia Hart (The Keeping Room) wrote the screenplay, and the film will be produced by Gary Gilbert (Garden State) and Jordan Horowitz (The Kids Are All Right), so Page is in good very hands.

Later this year he's heading into raunchy comedy with The Internship, marking the reunion of Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, but he's not done with adventurous family fare yet. Fox has just announced that Levy will directed Night at the Museum 3 for release on December 14th, 2014. The first two films saw Ben Stiller getting involved in the nightlife of a couple museums when the exhibits come to life. With scripts from Robert Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon, it's been quite a fun romp. Read on!\n\nMelissa McCarthy & Ben Falcone to Direct Road Trip Comedy 'Tammy'\n\nBridesmaids star Melissa McCarthy is having a hell of a week. Her new movie Identity Thief hits theaters tomorrow, and just yesterday we wrote about how she and her husband, Ben Falcone, started a brand new production company and are developing three new projects as starring vehicles for the actress. Variety has just added one more piece of good news to the pile, as McCarthy and Falcone will make their directorial debut by co-directing a comedy they wrote called Tammy that has McCarthy set for another lead role. This project has been in the works since 2011, and, like Identity Thief, it's another road trip comedy. Read on!\n\nThe Weinstein Company Picks Up 'The Grandmaster' for US Release\n\nI don't find it very surprising to hear that The Weinstein Company has secured rights to release Wong Kar Wai's martial arts epic The Grandmaster, starring Tony Leung. It's a film we've been covering for a few years and was already released in Asia earlier this year. We expected this to premiere in Cannes, which is Harvey's home territory, but it's actually premiering at the Berlin Film Festival this week and they seem to be rather pleased with it. The film will have a perfect home at The Weinstein Company, who usually picks up kick ass genre films like this (see Dragon/Wu Xia), I just hope they'll give it a strong release. More below!\n\nLe Carre's 'Tinker Tailor' Sequel & 'Our Kind of Traitor' Coming Soon\n\nIt's been over a year since Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy hit theaters in 2011, but before the film even had a wide release and buzz on the awards circuit, there was talk about the subtle, quiet spy thriller becoming a franchise. In September of 2011, Oldman theorized about which John Le Carre books might be adapted into films (or maybe even one film), and now word comes from ScreenDaily, after speaking with StudioCanal Chairman and CEO Olivier Courson and Ron Halpern from international productions and acquisitions, that the sequel Smiley's People is gearing up to begin shooting in 2014. But who's coming back? More below!"
