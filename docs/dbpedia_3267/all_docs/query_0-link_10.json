        "text": "Highest Rated: 85% Loving Vincent (2017)\n\nLowest Rated: 14% LOL (2012)\n\nBirthday: Jul 9, 1992\n\nBirthplace: London, England, UK\n\nThe exceedingly handsome actor Douglas Booth - one of a select group of British up-and-comers like Robert Pattinson and James McAvoy - never accepted other's perceptions, going on to star in a variety of esteemed projects on both sides of the Atlantic. The former teen model first rose to prominence in his native country when cast as notorious pop idol Boy George in \"Worried about the Boy\" (BBC, 2010) and earned further plaudits for his work in \"Christopher and His Kind\" (BBC Worldwide, 2010), leading to his first Hollywood role in \"LOL\" (2012), opposite Disney star Miley Cyrus. Booth gained additional attention for his turn as Pip opposite Gillian Anderson's Miss Havisham in a BBC miniseries of Charles Dickens' \"Great Expectations\" (2011). Booth's star potential earned him several Hollywood assignments, including roles in Carlo Carlei's version of \"Romeo and Juliet\" (2013) and Darren Aronofsky's biblical epic, \"Noah\" (2014). Booth showed intelligence and diversity in his early career choices, the sort of foresight that usually proved naysayers wrong and resulted in career durability.\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n75% Noah 74% The Limehouse Golem 72% My Salinger Year 68% Shoshana\n\n66% Batched\n\n65% Unwelcome 47% Pride and Prejudice and Zombies 41% Mary Shelley\n\nPhotos\n\nJUPITER ASCENDING, Douglas Booth, 2015. ph: Murray Close/© Warner Bros.
