        "text": "Review: 'Jupiter Ascending'\n\nNo one is going to confuse Andy and Lana Wachowski with Orson Welles, but they continue to face a similar struggle.\n\nThe brilliant Welles spent his career trying to live up to the genius of his first film, \"Citizen Kane,\" a movie so inventive and influential as to be revolutionary. The Wachowskis, meanwhile, will always face comparisons to their second film, \"The Matrix,\" revolutionary in its own way, with a mind-bending mix of effects and metaphysics. Welles made other great movies, like \"The Magnificent Ambersons,\" but never again matched his first film.\n\nThe Wachowskis, on the other hand, are still plugging away, looking for good stories to help make sense of life and existence, poking around in all corners of the universe. But they keep coming up empty. \"Jupiter Ascending,\" their latest film, is no exception.\n\nMila Kunis stars as Jupiter Jones, a Russian immigrant whose father — murdered in Russia before Jupiter was born — predicted big things for her. But she's working as a maid with her mother and their family in Chicago when the film begins, scrubbing toilets and hating her life.\n\nAll this changes with the arrival of Caine Wise (Channing Tatum), a wolf-human hybrid (check out the ears) who zips in on shoes that allow him to fly, saving Jupiter from bad guys she didn't even know were bad.\n\nJupiter, you see, is a part of a much bigger blueprint for the universe. Earth, it turns out, is just a kind of farm planet. The universe is made up of many such properties, as it were, valuable for different reasons. The planets are divvied up among siblings Kalique (Tuppence Middleton), Titus (Douglas Booth) and the oldest, Balem (Eddie Redmayne, doubtless having no idea the movie would be delayed months, and thus come out just as Oscar voters are considering his nominated performance in \"The Theory of Everything\").\n\nThe three have a cavalier attitude toward Earth and human life, since it's just another property to be fought over to them; they sound like a family of slumlords fighting over a crumbling-but-profitable tenement project.\n\nThe whys and what-fors you will have to discover for yourself. You won't find spoilers here — not because it's the right thing to do to avoid them, but because the story is so convoluted it's incredibly difficult to understand and impossible to explain. If you figure it out, let me know.\n\nThe short version is that Jupiter shares DNA with the siblings' mother, so she is not just royalty but a kind of reincarnation. This does not prevent her newfound relatives from wanting her dead, or rescued, or dead again, all for different reasons. She's a pawn in their jealous games, a story that has been told before but not, to my knowledge, on the planet Jupiter.\n\nThere are some big ideas tossed about here, most having to do with time. But nothing really has a chance to take hold; there is too much of a rush to get to another visually striking chase or explosion or other worldly skyline. (Jupiter is heavily influenced by the steampunk movement, from the looks of it. The planet. Not the woman.)\n\nThere are also a few laughs, including a bit where we learn that bureaucracy is a bane no matter what planet you live on. (Look for Terry Gilliam in a cameo, a sweet touch considering his classic \"Brazil\" was the last word on the dangers of bureaucracy.)\n\nBut the weight of these ideas proves far too heavy for the story to support. The acting doesn't help. When the range extends from confused to bored, it's not a good sign. And these are good actors. They are just given silly things to do. Not as silly as Tom Hanks and Halle Berry muttering in the made-up gibberish created for the Wachowskis' last film, \"Cloud Atlas.\" But there's nothing of substance the cast can latch onto.\n\n'Jupiter Ascending'\n\nDirectors: Andy and Lana Wachowski.\n\nCast: Mila Kunis, Channing Tatum, Eddie Redmayne."
