Now grown, Jupiter dreams of the stars but wakes up to the cold reality of a job cleaning toilets and an endless run of bad breaks. Only when Caine, a genetically engineered ex-military hunter, arrives on Earth to track her down does Jupiter begin to glimpse the fate that has been waiting for her all along—her genetic signature marks her as next in line for an extraordinary inheritance that could alter the balance of the cosmos.",

        "text": "“Jupiter Ascending” is a unique movie because it deals with sci-fi themes, but it is also very much a film about people who struggle and deal with day-to-day life. Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis), a Russian immigrant, gets up early to do the thankless job of cleaning, including cleaning toilets. No wonder she says, “I hate my life.” But things change for Jupiter when Caine Wise (Channing Tatum) arrives on Earth.\n\nWise has come because Jupiter is the genetically reincarnated matriarch of a royal family. This royal family has a bit of a stronghold on the universe. Titus (Douglas Booth) and his siblings Balem (Eddie Redmayne) and Kalique (Tuppence Middleton), do not want Jupiter to upset their carefully laid plans. Caine puts it all together, realizing that Jupiter could take the throne. He seeks out a man named Stinger (Sean Bean) to solicit his help, even though they did not part previously on good terms.\n\nThe film is interesting enough, if a bit different. The human factors—such as putting the past behind and family jealousies—are well played out in the movie. And Caine is a protector, looking out for Jupiter. But the language, violence and nudity prevent us from awarding the movie our Dove “Family-Approved” Seal."
