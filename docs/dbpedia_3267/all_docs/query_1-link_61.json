        "text": "Welcome back to your favorite podcast about some of the biggest bombs in cinematic history. On this week’s episode, we once again find ourselves in sci-fi town with the 2015 space opera film Jupiter Ascending. Boasting a budget north of $200M, Jupiter Ascending left general audiences bewildered by the lack of character development, terrible script, nonexistent performances, dodgy CGI, and whatever Eddie Redmayne was doing on screen. This film is a misfire on all aspects. One starts to wonder just how it all went wrong and how The Wachowskis could go from The Matrix to a dog-man “surfing” with gravity boots. Woof!\n\nJupiter Ascending is directed by The Wachowskis and stars Channing Tatum, Mila Kunis, Sean Bean, Eddie Redmayne, and Douglas Booth.\n\nIf you want to leave feedback or suggest a movie bomb, please drop us a line at NotABombPod@gmail.com or Contact Us - here.
