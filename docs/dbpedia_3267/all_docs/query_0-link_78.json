        "text": "The most exhilarating creature features are not only driven by an emotionally compelling family story, but also terrifying creatures that represent a warped reflection of humanity. That’s certainly the case for the upcoming horror film, ‘Unwelcome.’\n\nThe drama was directed by Jon Wright (‘Grabbers,’ ‘Tormented’), who also co-wrote the script with Mark Stay (‘Robot Overlords’). ‘Unwelcome’ stars Hannah John-Kamen (‘Ant-Man and The Wasp,’ ‘Ready Player One,’ ‘Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City’), Douglas Booth (‘The Dirt,’ ‘Jupiter Ascending’), Colm Meaney (‘Con Air,’ the ‘Star Trek’ franchise) and Kristian Nairn (‘Game of Thrones’).\n\n‘Unwelcome’ follows a couple, Maya and Jamie (John-Kamen and Booth) as they escape their urban nightmare in London to mvoe the tranquility of rural Ireland. However, upon their arrival, they’re surprised to hear stories of mysterious beings who live in the ancient wood at the foot of their new garden. As warned by their new neighbors, in Irish lore the Redcaps will come when called to help souls in dire need of rescue, but it’s crucial to remember that there’s always a dear price to pay for their aid.\n\nWell Go USA will release the movie, which is currently on Digital, on Blu-ray and DVD on Tuesday, May 9. In honor of ‘Unwelcome’s disc and Digital distribution, Film Factual is offering four lucky winners a Blu-ray copy of the feature.\n\nTo enter the giveaway, follow us on Facebook or Twitter (also find us using hastag @FilmFactualSite on both websites). DM us on either account and let us know that you’re entering to win the ‘Unwelcome’ Blu-ray giveaway in the message. You have until May 9, the day of the drama’s release, to enter, and you can DM us once daily on each account. On May 9, we’ll pick the winners at random, and notify them through DM on each account. Good luck!\n\nThe movie’s Blu-ray has a SRP of $29.98, and the DVD has an SRP of $19.99. Both discs are currently available for pre-order. The discs feature bonus materials, including a Behind-the-Scenes featurette.\n\nFun Film Fact: ‘Unwelcome’ was shot in 2020, only a few months after the outbreak of COVID-19. The UK had been on complete lockdown, and ‘Unwelcome’ was one of the first independent movies to go into production with the support of the UK government-backed insurance system that was aimed at supporting productions throughout the pandemic."
