        "text": "Jupiter Ascending is the latest sci-fi action film from the Wachowski siblings. This one stars Mila Kunis as a nobody on Earth who turns out to be someone very special in the galactic empire that’s operating all around without any Earthlings’ knowledge.\n\nChanning Tatum plays the hunky, genetically engineered warrior charged with protecting her and Eddie Redmayne is the vicious heir to the empire’s throne who wants to clear his path to ascendancy.\n\nThe Wachowskis had a great run with The Matrix, but as I say in my video review above, it’s been awhile since one of their films really worked. This one is no different, except maybe worse.\n\nSean Bean, Tuppence Middleton and Douglas Booth also star in Ascending. Warner Bros. is handling distribution, and rolling the film out across much of the planet simultaneously this weekend (it has already opened in a few territories this week, but WB hasn’t released box office numbers).\n\nWatch my review. Will you go see the movie? Tell us what you think."
