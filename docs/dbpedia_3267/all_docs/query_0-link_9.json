        "text": "Andy and Lana Wachowski's Cloud Atlas was my favorite movie of 2012, but it was a total dud at the box office. The sweeping connected story of love, rebellion and redemption didn't connect with a mass audience at all, so the filmmaking duo is returning to their roots: the science fiction action genre. Up next is Jupiter Ascending, an epic action tale starring Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis, that recently added \"Game of Thrones\" star Sean Bean and Les Mis actor Eddie Redmayne to its cast. Now Variety reports that another actor has hopped aboard the project, as Douglas Booth just signed on for an unknown role. More below.\n\nAs a quick refresher, the plot centers on a young female Russian immigrant (Kunis) who scrubs toilets for a living, unaware that humanity is being watched from afar by more evolved humans on distant planets. She possesses the same perfect genetic makeup as the Queen of the Universe, threatening the Queen's immortal rule. When an assassin (Tatum) is sent to kill the girl, he ends up falling for her instead, and they have to go on the run from more advanced humans who have been crossbred with animals to heighten characteristics: soldiers getting strength and a pack mentality from wolves, workers gaining their work ethic from bees, etc.\n\nBooth isn't a household name quite yet, but Darren Aronofsky cast him last year in the role as a son of the title character in his upcoming Biblical drama Noah, so we'll all be familiar with him by the time Jupiter Ascending lands in theaters in 2014+. Booth also has a remake of Romeo and Juliet in the works opposite True Grit's Hailee Steinfeld, so he's hitting the romance genre as well. No one is quite sure exactly what he'll be doing in the Wachowskis' space saga, but if The Matrix is any indication, the writer/directors know how to create quality roles even for smaller players in the cast, so we're excited to see what they have cooked up."
