        "text": "One thing about Jupiter Ascending is undeniable: It’s the biggest movie of the weekend. It’s got the biggest stars—Channing Tatum, Mila Kunis, Eddie Redmayne. It’s got the biggest directors—the Wachowskis, Andy and Lana, of The Matrix fame. It’s got the biggest effects (watch downtown Chicago get wasted!), and of course, the biggest budget—$175 million, which sounds like enough to pay for an actual ascent to Jupiter. Pundits are already speculating that it’s also going to be the year’s biggest bomb—“SPONGEBOB” TO MOP THE FLOOR WITH “JUPITER ASCENDING,” predicts Variety—but I’m not ready to label it DOA. So instead of burying Jupiter Ascending, I have some questions for you to ponder as you watch:\n\n1. Where do you stand on the title?\n\nKunis plays a young Russian émigré named Jupiter who starts out the movie cleaning toilets. Through one of those bits of science fiction legerdemain, she turns out to be an intergalactic royal so innately regal that bees rise to salute her (really). Naturally, this makes her a target for other members of the cosmic elite, who pluck her into outer space. So Jupiter not only rises in the social order but also goes up into space—she’s ascending, get it? Does this make the title clever or stupid? For comparison, back in the early nineties Janet Jackson starred in Poetic Justice playing a poet named Justice.\n\n2. What’s the worst performance ever given within a month of receiving the Best Actor Oscar?\n\nNow, we can’t yet be absolutely sure that Eddie Redmayne will win for The Theory of Everything—though I’m betting on him—but he nails the other side of the question here. As the pallid, deathly Balem, perhaps the most twisted dude in the entire cosmic elite, he gives a performance of such risibly limp, whispery villainy that I kept blinking in disbelief. To be fair, Redmayne’s not killing the movie, the movie’s killing him. You can feel this fine actor trying to do something, anything, to force-feed some originality into an Etch-a-Sketch of a character.\n\n3. What is it with the Wachowskis and women?\n\nI don’t mean in real life—I don’t know them. But man, has this movie got some freaky adolescent stuff: sanitary pad gags, a queasy-jocular plotline about Jupiter selling her eggs for a pittance, a gratuitous shot of **Tuppence Middleton’**s very naked bottom. Weirdest of all, the wonderful Kunis (who is not photographed flatteringly) is given nothing to do. Where Keanu Reeves in The Matrix undergoes training as “The One” and proceeds to do great things, Jupiter—who’s presented as a miraculous, once-in-a-century figure—spends Jupiter Ascending watching men clobber one another, getting suckered by fast talkers, and falling in love with Tatum. When you see the job this regal heroine chooses at the end of the movie, you may find yourself wondering: Why do so many futuristic movies have the sexual politics of something from the 1820s?\n\n4. Can you spot the influences and allusions?\n\nThe Wachowskis are cultural magpies, lifting ideas from all over the place. I don’t mean this as a rebuke. They are very good at taking things and recombining them, as when The Matrix brought together Philip K. Dick, cyberpunk, and Hong Kong action pictures. They’re up to the same tricks in Jupiter Ascending, where Tatum’s character—the part-man, part-beast Caine—taps into the current cult of books about Angels without Wings. Can you spot anything else they’ve appropriated? Hint: In the long, supposedly funny riff on the DMV, one of the officious paper-pushers is played by the famous filmmaker they’re nodding to.\n\n5. Is Channing Tatum a movie star?\n\nI’m extremely fond of him and he won my vote for Actor of the Year in 2014 for his funny work in 22 Jump Street and his angry, confused performance in Foxcatcher, where he’s better than most of the Oscar nominees. But does he have that transcendent quality that makes people go to the movies just for him? And if so, does he deliver in this movie what viewers want? In a way, Jupiter Ascending isn’t a fair test because Caine—like all the film’s major characters—lacks even the depth of a Marvel hero like Thor. Would this movie be any different if he’d been replaced by Chris Hemsworth?\n\n6. Isn’t “Less is more” supposed to be common knowledge?\n\nThere are some spectacular things to look at in Jupiter Ascending—the CGI has an impressive crispness—and the scene with Tatum flying through the Windy City air in his antigravity shoes is really a gas. But as with the two painfully overblown sequels to The Matrix, the Wachowskis seem to think that if something is great once, it’ll be even greater if you do it nineteen times and bigger. And so in this 127-minute movie that doesn’t find time to let its heroine do anything, the fight sequences with the lizard men get longer, the flying CGI glass shatters more extravagantly, and the antigravity boots carry Caine even farther through the air. While all this “thrilling” stuff was happening during the endless 20-minute battle royal at the end, my wife—who liked the movie better than me—fell asleep.\n\n7. Doesn’t anybody in the future ever learn anything?\n\nIt’s a striking feature of lousy science fiction, and of Jupiter Ascending in particular, that while humanity can conjure up a futuristic universe filled with breathtaking achievements—medicines that instantly heal wounds, elixirs that let one live for millenia, spaceships that can materialize in a shimmer—human consciousness is still the same old, same old. Redmayne’s Balem and his selfish siblings—played by Middleton and prettyboy Douglas Booth—may run the universe, but you have to wonder, “How?” Far from being masterminds, they bicker and scheme at a level that would get them laughed off Game of Thrones.\n\n8. Are the Wachowskis actually trying to make a blockbuster movie?\n\nEven if you don’t like their movies, it’s hard not to like the idea of the Wachowskis. Here are two Chicago siblings who always want to thrill and bedazzle you, whether they’re making an action picture like this one or their nutso-ambitious adaptation of Cloud Atlas. They’re not allured by pre-existing comic-book heroes like Iron Man, they want to make stuff up. In their own way, they’re as cussedly true to their own taste as, say, the Coen brothers, which may help explain some of the more strikingly offbeat stuff here. But unlike the Coens, the Wachowskis' private dreams have a grandiosity that demands huge budgets they can only justify by drawing huge audiences. How long can they keep getting money by making movies like this one?"
