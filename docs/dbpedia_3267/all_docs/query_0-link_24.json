        "text": "GLAMOUR's Leanne Bayley has been wooed by the gorgeous, handsome and well-spoken Douglas Booth. To celebrate her new-found love for the actor, Leanne decided to gift the star of Jupiter Ascending an early Valentine's Day card because, well, why the hell not!?\n\nScroll down to watch...\n\nDouglas Booth was in the UK to promote his new sci-fi movie Jupiter Ascending. The 22-year-old stars alongside Channing Tatum, Mila Kunis and Eddie Redmayne in the science fiction adventure movie created by filmmakers Lana and Andy Wachowski (the guys behid The Matrix).\n\nLeanne asked Douglas Booth all about the new movie (well, one question - sorry not sorry), whether he'd be up for starring in Magic Mike 3 if Channing asked*, and* if he'd play opposite his mate Emma Watson in Beauty and The Beast. And of course we couldn't leave without giving him a present - a Valentine's Day card.\n\nIf you haven't got time to watch the video, here is what Douglas exclusively told GLAMOUR...\n\nDouglas on... his role in Jupiter Ascending\n\n\"I don't think I necessarily channeled anything particular as it were, I think it was the Wachowskis created a world for me. They showed me all of these storyboards, they showed me what my spaceships were like, they showed me the people that I'd be hanging around with. They were like, 'these are your handmaidens, these are your servants, these are the people you've surrounded yourself with'. So, they gave me a world to play in and I kind of created my character inside that. So you've got to bear in mind that I've been alive for thousands of years so that affects the way that you move, the way you talk, you don't rush for anything ... there's no rush for anything in life. You have everything at your fingertips, so they kind of gave me the world to play in and I kind of created my character with that.\"\n\nDouglas on... starring in Magic Mike 3 (if it were to happen, and if Channing would call to ask)\n\n\"If he asked me to do it, I would definitely think about it, but I think I'd have to be in the gym for, um, a rather long time to keep up with him [Channing] and his abs, to be honest.\n\nDouglas on... playing a Disney Prince\n\n\"Yes is the answer. I probably would. There are some great stories there, and all of these Disney stories have come from old tales and old myths, and there are the older stories that we actually know. But I would only really do it if there were an interesting film maker involved, someone who would bring a new dimension.\"\n\nDouglas on... starring with Emma Watson in Beauty and The Beast\n\n\"Yeah, there we go! I'll have to give Emma a call. Give me a job, Emma (laughs).\"\n\nDouglas on... the British invasion in Hollywood & Eddie Redmayne's Oscar nom\n\n\"Yeah, I'm very very excited for him [Eddie Redmayne]. I'm friends with him and Benedict [Cumberbatch], so I've got to be careful what I say. It would be so amazing if either one of those guys could win, but also Birdman was amazing - there are some other great contenders there, but fingers crossed for the British talent and I think we're doing well. It's funny because when you're a young actor and you see some people like Eddie going and winning all of those awards, y'know, he's ten years older than me, it makes it all feel possible. The world suddenly feels a bit smaller. You're like, 'Oh, my mate's up there winning this, and winning that, so...' yeah, it's really exciting for me.\"\n\nDouglas on... his Valentine's Day from GLAMOUR\n\n\"Oh thanks. Thank you so much.\"\n\nDouglas on... his Valentine's Day woes\n\n\"Y'know, I've never got involved with Valentine's Day so much. I didn't get a single Valentine's Day card last year, thanks everyone.\"\n\nJupiter Ascending is out now."
