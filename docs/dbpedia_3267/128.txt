Jupiter Ascending star Douglas Booth got into the spirit of playing wild rocker Nikki Sixx by biting filmmaker Jeff Tremaine during a night out.

The Jackass director insisted the actors he had selected to take on the members of Motley Crue for his film The Dirt bonded before the shoot started - and he took Booth and Machine Gun Kelly, who portrays Tommy Lee in the biopic, out for drinks one night in New Orleans, Louisiana.

"Jeff demanded that we go out and have beers and really bond," rapper and actor Machine Gun Kelly tells Billboard. "Within the first 30 minutes, Doug was like, 'Iâ€™m Nikki Sixx, b**ch!' and bit Tremaine's shoulder so hard he still has bite marks and purple rings around the bite marks.

"As soon as Doug bit the director, we knew that it was going to be a ride."

The two young stars joined Iwan Rheon and Daniel Webber, who play Mick Mars and Vince Neil respectively in the much-anticipated biopic, which briefly brought the estranged bandmates back together last year.

They regrouped to record new material for the soundtrack to the film adaptation of the group's biography, The Dirt - Confessions Of The World's Most Notorious Rock Band. Neil flagged the surprise reunion on social media on 13 September (18), and Sixx followed up with more details.

Calling the band's new tracks "ball-busters", the bass player tweeted, "Everybody can relax. We're soon gonna smack you upside the head with some killer new tracks. Bob Rock is producing. It's our movie. We know what we're doing."

Sixx and drummer Tommy Lee hit the studio with Rock and posted shots from the mini-reunion on Facebook.

Meanwhile, Neil recently teased the film's trailer will debut during the Super Bowl telecast next month (Feb19).
