The Royal Australian Navy (RAN) is the naval branch of the Australian Defence Force. Established in 1911, the RAN was formed out of the Commonwealth Naval Forces to become the small navy of Australia after federation, consisting of the former colonial navies of the new Australian states. The Royal Navy of the United Kingdom continued to provide blue-water defence in the Pacific until World War II, when expansion of the RAN saw the acquisition of aircraft carriers, and other large surface vessels.

After World War II, the RAN was focussed on forward defence in South East Asia, therefore the RAN was structure to provide a carrier battle group to a NATO, or SEATO command. This was centred around the carrier HMAS Melbourne. After withdrawal from Vietnam, Australia changed its focus to a Two-Ocean Navy which would operate indpendently in home defence.

This was to be focussed around 2 carrier battle groups (one for the Pacific Ocean, the other for the Indian Ocean) with 4 large destroyers (the term 'cruiser' was avoided for political reasons, however the ships sought had a displacement of over 9000 tons), patrol vessels in the North, and submarines for survellance, interdiction, and special forces support. This led to an expansion and modernisation of the RAN.

In the event, the 'large destroyers' were not proceeded with until the mid-1990s, by which time they were ordered as Guided Missile Cruisers

The Daring class destroyers to be replaced and the Perth class guided missile destroyers were to be supplemented by a new guided missile destroyers. The new destroyers, the Ballarat class, were based on the British Type 42 destroyer, but with American weapons, and a different layout.

Two frigate roles were defined, escort and patrol. The RAN determined that to fulfill both roles, that at least 12 frigates were required. The patrol role was less important, and River class frigates were transferred to this role as Adelaide class frigates became available to replace them as escorts. The admission of New Zealand into the Commonwealth of Australia increased by frigate force by two ships, HMNZS Waikato and HMNZS Canterbury, which were similar to the RAN's existing River class destroyer escorts.

By 1990, the Royal Australian Navy had a substantial combat force force including:

2 Australia class Aircraft Carriers (R)

4 Ballarat class Guided Missile Destroyers (DDG)

3 Perth class Guided Missile Destroyers (DDG)

6 Adelaide class Guided Missile Frigates (FFG)

6 River class Destroyer Escorts (DE)

2 Leander class Frigates (F)

6 Oberon class Submarines (SSG)

15 Fremantle class patrol boats (PB)

Today the RAN is one of the largest naval forces in the Pacific region and has a significant presence in the Indian Ocean, and has undertaken operations in support of military campaigns and peacekeeping missions worldwide.

Today's fleet consists of around 60 vessels including cruisers, destroyers, frigates, submarines, patrol boats and auxiliary ships. The RAN today is one of the most modern in the Pacific and is tasked with the ability to defend Australian waters and undertake operations in distant locations.

The RAN's major ships are derivatives of Western designs. They frequently include Australian improvements, for example, the Adelaide class Frigates are based on the American Oliver Hazard Perry frigates, but include such improvements as an 8-cell Mk 41 VLS for Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles. Unlike American ships, they retained their Mk 13 launchers, the capabilities of which are extended by the integration of SM-2MR, and Harpoon Block II.

Australia's Hobart class cruisers are Australian made conbatants based on the American Ticonderoga class. They are considered among the most powerful surface combatants in the world.

The ANZAC class Frigates were originally intended as light patrol frigates by the Labor government of the late 1980's, but have been progressively upgraded. Upgrades include adding an extra 8 Mk 41 VLS cells (bringing the total to 16), adding 8 Harpoon launchers, and a new mine avoidance system. An active phased array radar is slated for installation from 2009.

The RAN has two primary bases for its fleet;

Fleet Base East, which is located at HMAS Kuttabul near Sydney, NSW.

Fleet Base West, located at HMAS Stirling near Perth, WA.

In addition, there are three other ports which are home to the majority of the RAN's minor war vessels (patrol craft, mine warfare craft);

HMAS Coonawarra, at Darwin, NT.

HMAS Cairns, at Cairns, QLD.

HMNZS Philomel, at Devonport, NZ.

Vice Admiral Sir Russ Shalders, AK is the current Chief of the Naval Staff and was appointed to this position in 2005.

All Royal Australian Navy ships and shore stations use the prefix Her Majesty's Australian Ship. Some shore establishments in New Zealand retained the designation Her Majesty's New Zealand Ship, but all warships were redesignated in 1988.

Combat organisation[]

The surface fleet is organised into two Carrier Battle Groups (CBG East, and CBG West), each based on an Australia class aircraft carrier, and four Surface Action Groups (SAG Alpha, SAG Bravo, SAG Charlie, SAG Delta), each based on a Hobart class cruiser. Each battle group has a Battle class destroyer, and one or two frigates assigned

Fleet Air Defence

Anti-Surface Warfare

Land Attack

Anti-Submarine Warfare

Reconnaissance

Vertical Replenshment

Coastal maritime patrol

Amphibious Operations (transport of troops and supplies, aerial fire support, and air defence)

Clearance Diving Teams[]

The Clearance Diving Teams (CDT) of the Royal Australian Navy also act as commando frogmen: they consist of naval personnel who are qualified in diving, demolitions, underwater repairs, and reconnaissance. Clearance Divers can deploy from surface ships, aircraft, and submarines. They fulfil a Maritime Counter-Terrorist role as part of the waterborne troop of the Tactical Assault Group East (TAG EAST).

The Clearance Diving Teams are usually under the control of Australian Special Operations Command.

The CDT's have the following roles

Mine Counter Measures (MCM) and Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), including:-

Location and disposal of sea mines in shallow waters

Rendering safe and recovering enemy mines

The search for and disposal of ordnance below the high water mark

Clearance of surface ordnance in port or on naval facilities

Search for, rendering safe or disposal of all ordnance in RAN ships and facilities, including the removal of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs)

Maritime Tactical Operations including:-

Clandestine hydrographic survey of an amphibious beach

Clandestine clearance or demolition of sea/land mines and/or obstacles

Clandestine placing of charges, demolitions for the purpose of diversion or demonstration

Underwater Battle Damage Repair

Support of TAG EAST (4RAR (Cdo)) in maritime terrorist incidents

List of Clearance Diving Teams[]

Clearance Diving Team One (AUSCDT ONE); assigned to the east of Australia and based at HMAS Waterhen in New South Wales

Clearance Diving Team Four (AUSCDT FOUR); assigned to the west of Australia and based at HMAS Stirling in Western Australia

Uniforms[]

The Royal Australian Navy has several different uniforms. The Service Dress uniforms are generally identical to those worn by the Royal Navy, with the exception of the title "AUSTRALIA" appearing on jacket shoulders, and rank slides. Junior sailors however have a different summer uniform, consisting of straight line white trousers, and a button-up white shirt.

Most sailors wear a grey coverall with safety boots as a working dress. Blue cotton drill shirts (called Action Working Dress) and trousers can also be worn (generally ashore, grey tends to be worn on ship).

Clearance Divers are involved in ground combat, and therefore wear DPCU, or DPDU as their working dress. Other naval personnel are issued DPCU and DPDU as required.

Grey coveralls and AWD are being replaced with a fire retardant variation on DPCU called Disruptive Pattern Naval Uniform (DPNU). DPNU in the AUSCAM pattern, with various shades of grey and green replacing the greens and browns of DPCU.

The Future[]

The Royal Australian Navy currently has requirements to replace the Australia-class aircraft carriers, and their aircraft. The RAN also requires replacements for the Kanimbla class amphibious transport ships.
