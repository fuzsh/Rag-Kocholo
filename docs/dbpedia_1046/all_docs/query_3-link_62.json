        "text": "The current Chief of Navy, Vice Admiral Michael Noonan, AO, took up his position on 6 July, 2018. With previous postings as the Deputy Chief and also head of Border Force, he is now not only in the job at a time of enormous activity, but also while one of the largest peacetime increases in Australian naval capability is taking place. He was kind enough to bring APDR up to date on a variety of topics.\n\nKym: Looking at the year that’s gone, what have\n\nbeen the major activities for Navy? And what do\n\nyou anticipate happening in 2020?\n\nAdmiral Noonan: I think it would be fair to say 2019\n\nhas been yet another busy year for us overall – with a\n\nlot of that activity going very well. A quick run around\n\nthe bazaars: we’ve had our ongoing commitment\n\nto Operation Resolute, the standing operation for\n\nmaritime border security. We’ve had consistently five\n\nto six boats in that program all year.\n\nThen there is our ongoing commitment to Middle\n\nEast operations through Operation Manitou. We\n\nsaw HMAS Ballarat up there for a good part of the\n\nback end of last year and into this year. They had\n\nsome very significant activity with respect to drug\n\ninterdiction – including a couple of record drug hauls.\n\nCloser to home, we saw the Indo-Pacific Endeavour\n\n2019 activity with a significant presence of five ships\n\nand almost 1200 Defence personnel visit seven\n\ncountries in the region – which was a great activity.\n\nThis is now the third time that we’ve done the Indo-\n\nPacific Endeavour.\n\nHowever, the most significant change, Kym, has\n\nbeen the Government shift in terms of focus to the\n\nregion, especially since October last year when the\n\nGovernment committed to the Pacific Step Up. The\n\nramifications for Navy are that we have now had\n\nan almost continuous presence in the Southwest\n\nPacific. Since February this year I’ve had a vessel\n\nin Papua New Guinea waters – and I’ve had at least\n\na second vessel, if not more, operating through the\n\nSouthwest Pacific.\n\nI think that’s going to be part of the new normal\n\ngoing forward. So, 2019 started busy, and it got\n\nbusier. With respect to next year, I would expect that\n\nwe will build upon all of those activities. I believe some\n\nhighlights of that will be that the Pacific step-up will\n\nbe maintained and we will do another Indo-Pacific\n\nEndeavour. Regarding other major exercises, 2020\n\nwill be a RIMPAC year so we will deploy a number of\n\nships to Exercise RIMPAC.\n\nAt home, we will host exercise Kakadu off Northern\n\nAustralia in the July – August timeframe next year.\n\nMost significantly, Kym, we’ve seen the Prime\n\nMinister’s announcement last month, with respect\n\nto Australia’s involvement in the US led International\n\nMaritime Security Construct. What this means for\n\nour Navy is that HMAS Toowoomba will deploy to the\n\nPersian Gulf in January next year.\n\nWe’re likely to see her employed in that maritime\n\nsecurity role, which will be defined over the coming\n\nmonths. But it will be a shift in the focus in employment\n\nof that frigate from what would have been activities\n\nwith Combined Task Force 150, which has been\n\nfocussed around the counter narcotic and counter\n\nillicit material and arms trade to what is going to be\n\na new focused operation around providing security\n\nand escort duties around shipping – namely fuel\n\ntankers transiting the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nKym: I assume that Navy will continue to support\n\nAustralian border security operations as well, just\n\nas part of your normal activities?\n\nAdmiral Noonan: Yes, absolutely Kym. There’s\n\nno foreseeable change to that occurring – and our\n\ncommitment to that remains enduring. Of course as\n\nwe look to introducing future capabilities – particularly\n\nthe offshore patrol vessels – we want to ensure they\n\nare designed with that enduring commitment in mind.\n\nKym: Just that quick overview indicates that you\n\nhave a lot happening – and I assume that you\n\nhave to keep something in reserve to deal with\n\nunplanned events?\n\nAdmiral Noonan: Yes, that’s very astute, Kym –\n\nwhat I just described to you is largely what has been\n\nour off-the-Australian-station commitment. On top of\n\nthis, we have other national commitments in terms\n\nof not just responding to crises or exercises, but the\n\nday-to-day raise, train and sustain commitments we\n\nhave, which have typically seen between 20 and 27\n\nships at sea at any one time through 2019.\n\nKym: That’s impressive.\n\nAdmiral Noonan: Which means every day,\n\nwe’ve had somewhere between 2,000 and 2,700\n\nAustralian men and women at sea from our Navy.\n\nThis represents a significant proportion of our overall\n\nforce in terms of our sustained commitment. So yes,\n\nwe’re pretty busy at the moment.\n\nKym: It certainly sounds like it. Turning to\n\nacquisitions, you have at least three major\n\nprograms underway: OPVs, future submarines\n\nand future frigates. It is a long time since so many\n\nlarge projects were running in parallel. Does this\n\ngive rise to particular challenges?\n\nAdmiral Noonan: I think in terms of the magnitude of\n\nwhat we’re doing, you’re spot on, it is unprecedented.\n\nIn terms of overall capability, clearly this is the\n\nsingle biggest capitalisation of the Navy since the\n\nSecond World War. But even back then, we weren’t\n\ndoing things like building submarines in parallel with\n\nfrigates and other vessels.\n\nSo in terms of challenge, absolutely it’s a huge\n\nchallenge. But it’s a challenge that I share with\n\nmy colleagues in the Capability and Sustainment\n\nGroup. I share that challenge with the Australian\n\nship building industry. I share that challenge with the\n\nEstate and Infrastructure Group who are responsible\n\nfor providing the shore support services.\n\nAnd to a large degree I also share that challenge\n\nwith my colleagues in the Air Force and Army as\n\nmany of these capabilities will have tri-service usage\n\nas we develop them. In some cases the Acceptance\n\nAuthorities, the Test and Evaluation Authorities,\n\ncome from other parts of Defence as well.\n\nSo while I’m certainly not at all trivialising the\n\nchallenge that we have, I do feel both excited by it\n\n– and I’m also well supported across the enterprise.\n\nAs we look at Governments’ commitment to it, and\n\nthe amount of the resource that they are putting into\n\nnot just the Navy but the entire Defence enterprise at\n\nthis very important time, I think it really does underpin\n\nthe Governments’ commitment to the ADF, and also\n\ntheir understanding of what is the evolving strategic\n\ncontext Australia finds itself in.\n\nKym: All three of these major acquisitions are\n\nin the relatively early stages. Are there any\n\nheadaches or standouts?\n\nAdmiral Noonan: I think that in terms of the three\n\nmajor programs, look they’re in great shape. With the\n\nOPVs, the first two are being built in South Australia,\n\nand we’ll see the third through to the 12th vessel\n\ncommence production in Western Australia next\n\nyear. So that’s a great news story. I think in absolute\n\nterms, there is very little risk to that program.\n\nThe Hunter class frigates – I’m very comfortable\n\nwith where we’re at with the build of those. Obviously,\n\npart of developing that capability is building the\n\nshipyard where the frigates will be constructed. That\n\nyard will be up and running early next year. And also\n\nlater next year we’ll start the prototyping of the first\n\nhull for the Hunter class and then we’ll split the build\n\nwith the first ship commencing in 2022.\n\nSo in terms of de-risking activities and industry’s\n\nengagement, we’re very well advanced. And of\n\ncourse we have the ability to learn lessons through\n\nBAE Systems construction of HMS Glasgow,\n\nhappening in Scotland as we speak. We’ve had\n\nregular contact there – I visited that dockyard late\n\nlast year.\n\nI certainly took away some great insights\n\nin terms of things that we need to be planning for in\n\nour Navy.Rear Admiral Pete Quinn, my Head of Navy\n\nCapability, was there only last week. And so we’re\n\nasking tough questions, but we’re asking the right\n\nquestions of BAE – and that’s all designed around\n\nensuring that we are a very informed customer and\n\nwe are taking a hands-on approach.\n\nTurning to the Attack class: there is not a day that\n\ngoes by that I don’t think or talk about submarines.\n\nThat project is pretty exciting too, in terms of what\n\nit represents for our Navy and the nation. Certainly\n\nit’s complex. It’s ambitious, but it’s absolutely vital.\n\nThe process that we’ve gone to, to get to where we\n\nare now has been very, very robust indeed. Design\n\nwork for that submarine is proceeding very well.\n\nI expect that we will see construction of NUSHIP\n\nAttack commencing in 2023. And we’ll take delivery\n\nof that first submarine in the early 2030s.\n\nIn parallel with that, we’ve now got both of the two\n\nnew supply ships in the water. They’re being built in\n\nSpain, with the second of those vessels launched\n\njust a few weeks ago. The first ship will be HMAS\n\nSupply, and we’ll take delivery of the capability in the\n\nfirst half of next year.\n\nKym: I guess sometimes we forget about the\n\nsupply ships because they’re not bristling with\n\nweapons, but they’re a pretty important part of\n\nthe overall mix.\n\nAdmiral Noonan: Absolutely. In terms of being able\n\nto achieve and maintain the mission that I’ve set for\n\nour Navy in 2022, it’s all about being able to conduct\n\nsustained operations as part of the joint force. And\n\nthat sustained increase absolutely is underpinned by\n\nnot just our national logistics mechanisms, but also\n\nour ability to replenish our ships at sea from things\n\nlike our tanking ships.\n\nKym: As an aside, I was lucky enough to spend\n\na few days on board ESPS Cantabria for a NATO\n\nelectronic warfare exercise a couple of years ago.\n\nAdmiral Noonan: Well that’s great Kym, and\n\ngiven your firsthand experience, which is even more\n\ncurrent than mine, I look forward to reading your very\n\nimpressive summary of the capabilities of our new\n\noilers! The Spanish have been terrific in terms of their\n\nsupport for the realisation of our own capability.\n\nIn 2013, Cantabria spent three or four months in\n\nAustralia and we received a great understanding of\n\nthe capability of the ship and in the lead up to taking\n\ndelivery of Supply we’ll have a small team over there\n\nlearning how to operate her as well.\n\nKym: I understand you are particularly interested\n\nin the Air Warfare Destroyers?\n\nAdmiral Noonan: Yes, and I hope it’s something\n\nyour readers are interested in! I’m absolutely\n\nthrilled with the progress that we’ve made with the\n\nHobart class destroyers. I was able to declare initial\n\noperating capabilities for HMAS Hobart earlier this\n\nyear. And that was after she deployed to the West\n\nCoast of the US late last year and conducted her\n\ncombat system sea qualification trials.\n\nI would go as far as saying the results of those\n\ntrials exceeded our expectations in a number of\n\nareas. Hobart’s now back in Australia, and she’s just\n\ncompleted her first maintenance cycle, following her\n\nIOC declaration. What that’s allowed her to do is to\n\nconduct some complex missile firings off the East\n\nCoast of Australia.\n\nWhat that now allows me to do is certify her to\n\ndeploy off the Australian station. She will do that\n\nas part of a task group in the September – October\n\nperiod. I’m really proud that Hobart will lead the\n\nAustralian task group into the South China Sea and\n\nwill also participate in the Japanese Fleet Review\n\nsoon after that.\n\nIn terms of the second ship – Brisbane – she\n\ncommissioned last year. She sailed out a month\n\nago on her way to the US to do a similar set of\n\ncertification trials to Hobart. Ultimately she will be\n\nready to deploy operationally from about the start of\n\nnext year.\n\nThe third ship NUSHIP Sydney, she’s well\n\nadvanced, she’s about 90% crewed and complete,\n\nso we’re looking to accept her later this year and\n\ncommissioned her into Navy service early next year.\n\nThey’ve been a tremendous success in terms of the\n\ndelivery of those programs – and their operational\n\nperformance has been absolutely first class.\n\nKym: I had a look at Sydney earlier this year when\n\nthe decision had been taken to incorporate the\n\nMH-60R helicopter modifications while she was\n\nstill there.\n\nAdmiral Noonan: Yes – I took a deliberate decision\n\nto recommend to Government to leave her there a\n\nlittle bit longer, and get those mods in, which really\n\nramps up the overall final operational capability of the\n\nclass by about nine months.\n\nKym: Next on my list is the Collins life extension\n\nprogram. There seems to be some uncertainty\n\nabout numbers: whether it will be five or six. Can\n\nyou clear that up?\n\nAdmiral Noonan: It’s not my decision to make,\n\nKym. Ultimately it’s a decision for Government – and\n\nmy recommendation has been that we upgrade at\n\nleast five of the six. I’ll let analysts and reporters\n\ncontinue to debate that. Ultimately the point that I’d\n\nunderline around the Life Extension Program is that\n\nit’s fully funded.\n\nThe capabilities that we will put into that boat are\n\ntwo fold. One is ensuring that the capability of the\n\nCollins class remains at the cutting edge, and also\n\nthat we’re de-risking capabilities that we will build\n\ninto the Attack class. Now, at some point there a\n\nfunding envelope will dictate the number of boats\n\nthat we upgrade, but also the nature of the systems\n\nthat we put into that life of type extension.\n\nI’m very confident that those boats will continue\n\nto serve us at the high end of submarine capability\n\nuntil we see the introduction of the Attack class. But\n\nclearly some of the details around what systems,\n\nand how many boats we extend are yet to be\n\ndecided by Government.\n\nThe current plan is that the first boat will\n\ncommence the life extension program as part of its\n\nfull cycle docking in 2024.\n\nKym: Now, to personnel. How are things looking\n\nthere? I recall reading a report recently of an\n\nAnzac frigate being tied up because of a crew\n\nshortage. Can you clarify what is going on there?\n\nAdmiral Noonan: Sure – it’s absolutely my\n\nsingle most important focus is our people and\n\nour workforce. In terms of the ship that you’ve\n\ndescribed, that’s HMAS Perth. She’s not tied up,\n\nshe’s out of the water. She’s actually sitting on the\n\nhardstand at the Henderson facility in Western\n\nAustralia and she’s been there for two years.\n\nShe’s now part of the Anzac capability upgrade\n\nprogram – so in terms of absolute manning, she\n\nwouldn’t be manned at this point anyway. But my\n\npredecessor took the decision to put Perth into\n\nextended availability on the requirement that we\n\nsimply didn’t have the complete workforce to man\n\nher in a sustainable way.\n\nWe could’ve put that ship to sea, and it would’ve\n\nbeen probably at around about a 70% manning\n\nlevel – and that would have seen good people\n\noverworked, and a capability not fully realised.\n\nSo part of a very deliberate strategy that we have\n\nbeen enacting now for the last two years is about\n\nrebuilding our workforce. I’m delighted to say that\n\nthe inroads that we’ve made over the last 12 months\n\nhave been significant in terms of our workforce\n\nregeneration.\n\nI monitor the health of our workforce daily – and\n\neach fortnight as we pay our people, I track our\n\nnumbers. Last Thursday, we paid 14,682 people.\n\nWhich highlights the steady growth that we’ve\n\nenjoyed over the last 12 months, which has been\n\nabout a nett increase of 700 people overall.\n\nBut there’s two things to add: as you’ve alluded\n\nto, we’ve had workforce shortages and part of my\n\nbiggest challenge is that we’ve got a Navy workforce\n\nthat’s been critically hollow in the mid ranks. I’m\n\nabout a 1,000 people short the ranks of Leading\n\nSeaman to Petty Officer, Lieutenant Commander.\n\nSo while recruiting is going gangbusters at the\n\nmoment, overall, it will still take time to rebuild the\n\nexperience off the Navy to get us to the full, currently\n\nauthorised strength. I expect that we will hit the\n\nauthorised strength of our Navy, which is currently\n\n14,774. We’ll hit that pretty soon.\n\nBut in terms of being sustainable, and being able\n\nto deploy capability, we need to get experience and\n\ndepth back in the workforce.\n\nThat’s going to require two things. I need to\n\ncontinue to grow the workforce. And I need to work\n\nvery hard at retaining the men and women whose\n\nskills we rely upon every day.\n\nSo we’ve undertaken a number of very targeted retention initiatives to\n\nensure that we provide a great opportunity for\n\npeople to continue to serve beyond what has\n\nbecome an average length of service of around\n\nabout seven years.\n\nThat seven year average is not sustainable in\n\nterms of the future capabilities that we’ve got\n\ncoming towards us. As part of the force structure\n\nplanning activity that’s currently under way through\n\nthe Department, one of the biggest things that I’ve\n\nput on the table, is to grow the Navy workforce. And\n\nhow I’ve gone about that is through careful analysis\n\nof what our future fleet looks like.\n\nWe have to plan for how we will look in 2035 –\n\nand we’ve got a very clear understanding of what\n\nthe fleet is going to look like. We’ve probably got a\n\nless certain view of what we’ll be doing. But some\n\nof those things that we spoke about at the start of\n\nthe interview, gives you a sense of where I think\n\nwe’re going. And so my belief, and my advice to\n\nGovernment is that we need to significantly increase\n\nthe number of people in our Navy.\n\nI’ve stood up a new directorate within Navy that’s\n\nabsolutely committed to understanding what our\n\nfuture workforce needs to look like. And developing\n\nthose strategies to ensure that we can achieve it\n\nonce we get approval from government to grow.\n\nKym: A supplementary question on that,\n\nbecause it’s obviously a vital topic. Do you have\n\nan ultimate figure in mind of how much larger\n\nyou’ll need to be in terms of personnel say at the\n\nend of the decade when platforms like the future\n\nfrigate and the future submarines start to come\n\nonline?\n\nAdmiral Noonan: The Director General Future\n\nNavy Workforce and his team have commenced\n\ndetailed analysis of this very question, and I will\n\nbe seeking to provide input to the force structure\n\nplanning process currently being led by the Vice\n\nChief of Defence Force in the coming months. But\n\nit would be fair to say that I expect that the Navy\n\nwill need to grow in the coming years in order to\n\nfully exploit the capabilities which will be delivered,\n\nwhich I expect Navy to be directed by Government\n\nto undertake.\n\nKym: There has been a bit of publicity about\n\nnetworking Air Force and Army assets – is that\n\njust as important for the RAN?\n\nAdmiral Noonan: Bottom line, absolutely! In as\n\nmuch, Kym, as that we don’t deploy as a Navy, we\n\ndeploy as part of a joint force. This is certainly the\n\ncase if you’re looking at it through experiences such\n\nas the recent Exercise Talisman Sabre. If you peel\n\nback what we achieved out of that exercise, it was\n\nall about being part of a networked enabled force.\n\nWe were actually operating the two LHDs together\n\nfor the very first time – and that has allowed me now\n\nto progress towards the final operating capability of\n\nthe LHD platform. But moreover, we’re talking about\n\nthe amphibious ready group – and that’s all about\n\ncommand and control and networks.\n\nIt’s all about being able to plan in an aggregated way. Sharing\n\ninformation between land systems, air systems and\n\nmaritime systems. That really is now the way that we\n\ndo business. The end state for me, as I reflected earlier,\n\nin terms of Plan Pelorus 2022 is about being able to\n\nconduct those sustained operations in the joint force.\n\nThe things that we are looking at in terms of future\n\nNavy and maritime capabilities, are well beyond\n\neven networking. The opportunities around cyber;\n\naround advanced ICT systems; around space;\n\naround satellite protocols.\n\nWe’re thinking about those every day. Even some\n\nof the trials that HMAS Brisbane will conduct during\n\nher time in the US, will be a step up from what\n\nHobart’s done previously in terms of their networked\n\nabilities. In terms of sharing targeting information\n\nfrom the third party and real-time activities that\n\nabsolutely make full use of the electro-magnetic\n\nspectrum.\n\nKym: Any final messages? I assume you will be\n\nlooking forward to discussing this at the Pacific\n\nConference?\n\nAdmiral Noonan: Yes – and my only final comment\n\nwould be to say thanks for this opportunity – and\n\ncertainly going forward in the context of the Sea\n\nPower Conference and Exhibition, I’m delighted that\n\nwe’ve got this opportunity to engage with industry\n\nand engage with our academic colleagues – who I\n\nnow see as being not just part of the commentary,\n\nbut they’re truly integrated partners in the capability\n\nthat the Navy is fielding.\n\nI see this relationship developing in the future –\n\nand certainly my hopes and expectations for this\n\nupcoming Sea Power Conference is that everybody\n\nleaves feeling that they are part of a very important\n\ntime of our Navy’s history.\n\nAnd I certainly look forward to receiving advice – I\n\nget plenty of that!"
