Admiral Franchetti will sit down with Dr. Kathleen McInnis, Director of the Smart Women, Smart Power Initiative, for a discussion on the U.S. Navy’s priorities as they operate far forward, around the world and around the clock, from seabed to space, in cyberspace, and in the information environment to promote our nation’s prosperity and security, deter aggression, and provide options to our nation’s leaders. Additionally, the pair will discuss Admiral Franchetti’s approach to mentorship, recruitment, and retention within the force.\n\nAdmiral Franchetti assumed the duties as 33rd Chief of Naval Operations on November 2, 2023, becoming the first woman on the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Notably, she commanded USS Ross (DDG-55); led Destroyer Squadron 21 (DESRON 21) while embarked on USS John C. Stennis (CVN-74); and the USS George Washington (CVN-73) Carrier Strike Group.\n\nAshore, Franchetti’s highlights as a flag officer include commander, U.S. Naval Forces Korea; commander, Carrier Strike Group 15; chief of staff, Strategy, Plans and Policy (J-5) Joint Staff; commander, U.S. 6th Fleet, Naval Striking and Support Forces NATO; deputy commander, U.S. Naval Forces Europe and Africa; and director for Strategy, Plans and Policy (J-5), Joint Staff.\n\nThis event is made possible by general support to CSIS."
