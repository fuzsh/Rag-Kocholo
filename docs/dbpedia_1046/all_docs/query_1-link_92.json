Marco said yesterday that Struhs would have been “suffering for days” due to her condition.\n\nAn ambulance was not called before she died and father Jason Struhs only reported her death on 8 January, Marco said, with paramedics arriving that evening. Police and paramedics who attended the house found about 20 members of the Saints at the house praying and singing as the child lay dead, she said.\n\nThe court heard a work colleague of one of the group later told a member that the names of Elizabeth’s parents had been released to the media. He replied that it was great news because it meant more people would be shocked when Elizabeth comes back from the dead, the court heard.\n\nMarco said the mother, Kerrie Struhs, had recently been released from prison for a previous incident involving Elizabeth. She was due to meet her parole officer on 6 January, but told them she was unwell and had it rescheduled, the court has heard.\n\nThe trial continues.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 06.44 CEST\n\nScope of NSW inquiry into greyhound racing announced\n\nDavid Harris outlined the scope of the inquiry as follows:\n\nGreyhound welfare and the care of greyhounds by Greyhound Racing NSW, including management and compliance with welfare standards and any welfare concerns relating to Greyhound Racing NSW’s management of greyhound adoption and rehoming programs, including facilities and its other functions under the Act.\n\nGreyhound Racing NSW’s processes and management, including procurement and recruitment practices, concerns regarding any alleged or identified conflicts of interest and the management of conflicts of interest.\n\nThe accuracy and reporting by Greyhound Racing NSW in relation to greyhounds, and whether that reporting represents the true state of the greyhound racing industry – including the welfare of greyhounds and the state of related programs under Greyhound Racing NSW’s control, awareness, and oversight.\n\nThe performance and effectiveness of Greyhound NSW’s function under the Act, and the Greyhound Racing NSW operating licence, in relation to racecourse safety, management, and compliance with minimum track standards.\n\nGreyhound Racing New South Wales’ management’s response to complaints or concerns regarding organisational and workplace culture and conduct, or any other related matters, arising in the inquiry, and any other matters arising in the course of the inquiry into the matters above that the acting commissioner considers relevant.\n\nThe acting commissioner will have until 13 December to report back, Harris said.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 06.22 CEST\n\nRacing minister officially announces inquiry into Greyhound Racing NSW\n\nThe NSW minister for gaming and racing, David Harris, is announcing a public inquiry into greyhound racing in the state – as he flagged yesterday.\n\nHarris said he has appointed mediator and investigator Lea Drake to oversee the inquiry.\n\nDrake has more than two decades’ experience as a member of the fair work commission and served a 5-year term as inaugural commissioner of the law enforcement conduct commission, as well as sitting on civil and administrative and sports misconduct-related tribunals.\n\nThe inquiry will examine complaints about Greyhound Racing NSW’s governance and operations, track safety, and animal welfare issues – including claims made by whistleblowers.
