        "text": "Remember the federal Labor government’s commitment to creating a ‘Strategic Fleet’? How did the Department of Defence kill off this half-good idea? Sent to a working group with instructions to hide until the next federal election? Perhaps a long brief to the government saying the Department is disinterested? Or simply the idea is wandering in the realm of Limbo between political announcements and bureaucratic actions? … “An Albanese Labor Government will strengthen Australia’s economic sovereignty and national security by building an independent Strategic Fleet to secure our ongoing access to fuel supplies and other essential imports.” “As a first step, an incoming Albanese Labor Government will appoint a Taskforce to guide it on the establishment of the Fleet as quickly as possible. While these ships will likely be privately owned and operate on a commercial basis, we will ensure they are available for use by the Defence Forces in times of national crisis, whether that be natural disaster or conflict.” https://lnkd.in/eawz_WCX\n\n\"Glad to be here\"! Thank you, John Foley, for sharing your insights and clearly explaining the importance of this mindset and the relevance of the Diamond Performance Framework to high-performing teams. Thank you Alexander Robinson for sharing! Here are few quotes that resonated with me: Closing the Gap • “Sustained success requires constant improvement.” 🔄 The Brief—Focused Preparation • “In the real world, nobody is telepathic or psychic. If you want people to understand what you’re trying to accomplish, you have to explain it—in detail.” 🧠 • “The brief contains the relevant details that people need before they get started.” 📋 Contracts—Disciplined Execution • “Execution through trust” 🤝 The Debrief—Celebrate Your Victories • “The debrief is an inward look for an outward result.” 🔍➡️🌟 • “The key to the debrief is total honesty.” 🗝️🗣️ • “It is the most important facet of the Diamond Performance Framework and should be embedded firmly in your organization’s culture.” 💎 • “You cannot improve your performance unless you are totally honest about what you did right—and what you did wrong.” 📈📉 The Drive for Continuous Improvement • “With training and practice, I kept getting better—and so can you!” 🚀 The Yellow Helmet • “A culture of excellence doesn’t exchange one set of skills and values for another—it builds on those skills and values, raising them to a higher level.” ⛑️🌟 Read more below 👇 hashtag #highperformance #teamdynamics #GladToBeHere #leadership\n\nDid someone say Rotary Training? I know I have. I think I have said it on more than one occasion today. As well as #crewresourcemanagement, I’ve said that a few times as well. How many times do you mention safety training in what you do? One of the old favourites is “we’ve always done it like that” Have you heard that before? If you have did you question it or did you just crack on and ignore it. Worth thinking about. At JD2E we are always talking about how we can make it better. Why don’t you let us help you understand how to do it better. We can help with the complete training package. Why not get in touch and discuss how. #rotary #helicopter #training #missionsystems #flyingtraining Royal Navy Royal Air Force (RAF) British Army #drone #winching #crewman #hoistoperator #humanfactors #fleetairarm #navalaviation UK Ministry of Defence (Picture of my Naval Air Squadron flying overalls name badge)\n\n\"Glad to be here.\" If you've seen the newly released Blue Angels documentary, you may have picked up on this utterance in between the phenomenal aerial sequences. At any time there are seven US Navy (and United States Marine Corps) aviators that make up the Flight Demonstration Squadron, out of more than 7,000 current naval aircrew. Fewer than 300 pilots have ever served in The Blues, far less than the number of aviators that have graduated TOPGUN. The Blue Angels are special, but the 158 active duty sailors and marines that constitute the team don't view themselves as that. They are a part of something greater, and extraordinarily grateful to be a part of that special team each and every day. The Blue Angels’ greeting, motto, mindset, and ethos is fundamentally \"Glad to be here.\" The phrase is deeply embedded in their high-performance culture, and the attached document by former Blue Angels lead solo pilot John Foley illustrates the power of those four words, for The Blues, and others who seek perfection as a team. If I’m having a bad day at work, or if I ever view myself as being more important than the team and organisation, “Glad to be here” is a grounding statement. #pilottraining #blueangels #aviation #usnavy #navalaviation #teamwork\n\nHello Radio Reconnaissance Platoon I see a lot of posts on military recruitment and quality of life for Marines and sometimes wonder if HQMC or the public at large understand a different aspect of Marines not often discussed, and likely not popular unless you've experienced how what many call a better quality of life (QOL) negatively impacts camaraderie. I was honored in the 90's as a 2nd Lieutenant to be the Platoon Commander for 1st Radio Reconnaissance Platoon at Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii. RRP was the last of our Battalion to live in open squad bays, which meant a couple dozen Marines from Lance Corporal to Sergeant living in one very large room. There were no private showers or heads (bathrooms). Every day, I watched a half dozen or more RRT Marines pile into a Corporals jeep and head to the beach or a bar or whatever. On Field day, every Marine in the platoon, whether they lived in the squad bay or not, had to field day the barracks. When we finally were forced to move the platoon into two-man rooms, I seldom again saw more than a couple Marines in that beautiful red Jeep Wrangler. You could feel the difference in camaraderie within the platoon as they began to become less cohesive with all the Marines that once shared one large room. I don't think young people join the Marine Corps because they are looking for comfort or want to live the campus life. Their is an intersection where QOL and camaraderie intersect, and I realize it's too late to rewind the clock, but the two man barracks campus life was the first time I felt a disconnect between what Marines were really looking for as Marines, and what the Generals were giving them as a QOL. #radioreconnaissance #veterans #leadership #veteranshelpingveterans #marines"
