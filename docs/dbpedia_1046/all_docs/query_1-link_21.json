        "text": "New research reveals the ranks of senior officers in the Australian military has almost doubled over the past twenty years, despite a steady decline in overall numbers of enlisted defence personnel.\n\nAnalysis prepared by the Parliamentary Library confirms the number of \"star-ranked\" officers in the Australian Defence Force now totals 219, up from 119 in 2003.\n\nThe figures, commissioned by the Greens Party, confirm that for every senior Australian Defence Force (ADF) officer, there is just 260 other lower ranked officers or regular personnel serving below them.\n\nStar-ranked officers, or 'flag officers' are those who serve at the Commodore, Brigadier or Air Commodore level and higher in the Navy, Army, and Air Force respectively.\n\nIn the United States there are 863 star-ranked officers, with the ratio of one senior officer for every 1526 personnel, while in the United Kingdom the proportion is one star-ranked officer for every 1252 other enlisted members.\n\nGreens Senator and Defence spokesperson David Shoebridge says the \"top-heavy\" nature of the ADF is laughable given the declining numbers of overall military personnel.\n\n\"When you have so much gold braid and so few troops it feels like a satire, not a military,\" Senator Shoebridge tells the ABC.\n\n\"Every time there's a national security announcement, we get a new general or we get a new admiral, or we get a new Air Marshal, but often it's not connected to a new boat, a new plane, or a new tank.\"\n\nAccording to the research, there are now 68 senior officers in the Royal Australian Navy, consisting of 50 Commodores, 15 Rear Admirals, and 3 Vice-Admirals which include the Chief of Navy, the Vice-Chief of Defence, and head of the Australian Submarine Agency.\n\nThe Australian Army, which boasts more than 27,000 personnel, has a total of 58 Brigadiers, 22 Major-Generals, 5 Lieutenant-Generals (including the ADF’s Chief of Joint Operations) and one General, Angus Campbell, who serves as Chief of Defence.\n\nIn the Royal Australian Air Force, there are currently 50 Air Commodores, 14 Air Vice-Marshals, and two Air Marshals — one who serves as RAAF chief, while the other was recently stood aside as the government’s National Cyber Security Coordinator.\n\nThe data compiled by the Parliamentary Library also records total enlisted numbers for the ADF falling backwards from 62,429 in 1983 to just 57,218 full time members in 2023.\n\n\"Senior Defence leadership have failed to meet a single recruiting target for the last decade while they have quietly doubled their own senior ranks — this is literally rewarding failure,\" Senator Shoebridge argues.\n\n\"The ADF has a whole lot of people with gold braid bossing around a shrinking group of enlisted members in khaki, blues and whites.\"\n\nThis year Australia’s Chief of Defence will collect a salary of over $1 million, far higher than the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the United States who earns $329,304 and the UK Chief of the Defence Staff who is paid $534,509.\n\nThe ABC has approached Defence Minister Richard Marles for comment."
