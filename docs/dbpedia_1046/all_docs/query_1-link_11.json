It is a two-star rank.\n\nRear admiral is a higher rank than commodore, but lower than vice admiral. Rear admiral is the equivalent of air vice-marshal in the Royal Australian Air Force and major general in the Australian Army.\n\nSince the mid-1990s, the insignia of a Royal Australian Navy vice admiral is the Crown of St. Edward above a crossed sabre[lower-alpha 1] and baton, above two silver stars, above the word \"AUSTRALIA\".[1] The stars have eight points[lower-alpha 2] as in the equivalent Royal Navy insignia. Prior to 1995, the RAN shoulder board was identical to the UK shoulder board. The UK shoulder board changed in 2001.\n\nRear Admiral Robyn Walker AM RAN became the first female admiral in the Royal Australian Navy when she was appointed Surgeon-General of the Australian Defence Force on 16 December 2011.[2]\n\nSee also[]\n\nRanks of the Royal Australian Navy\n\nAustralian Defence Force ranks and insignia\n\nReferencesand notes[]\n\nNotes[]\n\nReferences[]"
