How well we assist regarding transition into that ''horrible'' thing called civilian life. Then the difficulty in finding work, in coping with the difference, the void between our training and our service and adjusting to so called normality. In combating alcoholism, drugs abuse, domestic violence and homelessness.\n\nALL of these issues are directly relevant to the Royal Commission and we need everyone with any ADF experience, or the families of personnel, to write in and to make a submission.\n\nI was taken aback when my (dare I say) favourite CPO advised me recently how he almost took his own life, and why, and he is a Vietnam veteran.\n\nThis Royal Commission is OUR chance to be heard, to force politicians, bureaucrats and even the public to face up to the realities of what loyal service in the ADF can do to men and women in a negative way. Then, to ensure that measures are at long last taken to reduce these tragic circumstances.\n\nBOTH sides of politics have ignored many past inquiries even though they tended to have identical recommendations.
