        "text": "Vice Admiral David Johnston will lead Australia's armed forces as chief of the defence force, pending the approval of the governor-general.\n\nVice Admiral Johnston will replace General Angus Campbell, who has served as defence chief since 2018.\n\nHe takes on the role as the defence forces undergo a once-in-a generation strategic shift.\n\nAnnouncing the appointment, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said it was an \"easy decision\".\n\n\"It is indeed very significant that Vice Admiral Johnston is being appointed as chief of the defence force, because of his experience not just as a navy officer but as deputy [chief],\" Mr Albanese said.\n\n\"His service career has spanned a period of profound change in our defence force, in our region, in the very nature of the challenges confronting our national security.\"\n\nThe appointment comes as Australia considers expanding its key partnership with the United States and United Kingdom, AUKUS, to include Japan in some of the alliance's military projects.\n\nThe AUKUS agreement for Australia to acquire nuclear-powered submarines will be one of the most significant projects Vice Admiral Johnston takes on, with the first stages of construction due to begin late this decade.\n\nDefence Minister Richard Marles said it was \"worth noting that David Johnston will be the first Navy chief of the defence force in 22 years\".\n\n\"David has been at the very heart of reshaping the Australian Defence Force both in terms of culture but also importantly as vice chief of the defence force in terms of the platforms and capabilities that we are seeking to acquire.\n\n\"This is a moment where we need a safe pair of hands and deep experience to take our defence force forward.\"\n\nVice Admiral Johnston thanked the prime minister and defence minister for his nomination.\n\n\"I am very conscious of the responsibility that comes with the role, the strategic environment in which we face ourselves, and most particularly the responsibility I have to the extraordinary men and women in the Australian Defence Force and the families who support them.\"\n\nMr Albanese and Mr Marles also thanked outgoing chief General Campbell, who will have been the longest-serving chief in Australia's history when his service ends in July.\n\n\"[General Campbell] has earned the respect and deep gratitude of Australia, and we wish him all the very best,\" Mr Albanese said.\n\nIn a statement, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton extended congratulations to Vice Admiral Johnston on behalf of the Coalition, and thanked General Campbell for his service.\n\nVice Admiral Johnston is the current vice chief of the defence force.\n\nAir Marshal Robert Chipman will be recommended to be the new vice chief."
