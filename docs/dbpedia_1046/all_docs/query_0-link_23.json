Issued with her own #AusNavy uniform, Cerberus mascot Rani stands on parade as one of the Ship‚Äôs Company at the West Head Gunnery Range. Residing in the administration building, Rani has free range, with beds in various locations including beside the security guard and under the Officer In Charges desk. To keep her socialised, #OurPeople who work with Rani are able to take her home overnight or at weekends.\n\nSee more comments\n\nTo view or add a comment, sign in"
