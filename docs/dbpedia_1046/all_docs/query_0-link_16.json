        "text": "Photo: Royal Navy\n\nThe Royal Navy has helped lay the foundation for its Australian ally to acquire a nuclear-powered submarine capability, including through the country’s first UK trained nuclear submarine engineers.\n\nThree Royal Australian Navy officers graduated alongside their British counterparts after nine intensive months of training at HMS Sultan in Gosport.\n\nLieutenant Commander James, Lieutenant Isabella and Lieutenant Steve will now go on to serve in Astute-class submarines side-by-side with Royal Navy crews, adding practical experience to all they have learned on the Nuclear Operator Course.\n\nTheir success marks a significant milestone in developing the skilled workforce to operate Australia’s future nuclear-powered submarine capability.\n\nThe three officers are part of a pioneering cohort who will be among the first to operate Australia’s future conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered submarines, having gained education, experience and training in both UK and US shipyards, facilities and warships.\n\nPassing out, they were watched by Vice Admiral Mark Hammond, the Chief of the Royal Australian Navy – and a submariner – and Vice Admiral Jonathan Mead, Director General of the Australian Submarine Agency, while the Royal Navy’s Second Sea Lord Vice Admiral Martin Connell took the salute.\n\nVice Admiral Hammond praised the “exceptional dedication” of the trailblazing trio of officers for their success – and the Royal Navy for the “world-class training” it has provided.\n\nHe continued: “This demonstrates the exceptional skillset and knowledge of our people undertaking this unique training from the Royal Navy – a long-standing partner and friend to the Royal Australian Navy.\n\n“The graduation marks another significant step forward for the Royal Australian Navy’s ability to operate, maintain and support Australia’s future nuclear-powered submarine capability.”\n\nAs the first nuclear engineers to go through the UK training programme in their navy’s history, the Australian trio have been under the spotlight, with regular visits from senior officers to check on their progress.\n\n“It’s been great that they’ve continually shown interest in what we’re doing,” said 29-year-old Lieutenant Steve.\n\n“I was a weapons engineer, but nuclear engineering is a completely different ball park. I wanted a challenge, something interesting. It’s been very challenging, but also fascinating and much more interesting than conventional engineering.”\n\nAt 33, Lieutenant Commander James is an experienced submarine and marine engineer. “I was doing staff work, but it could be a bit mundane, so when the advert went out for nuclear engineers, I volunteered – I wanted to keep myself busy and active. And it’s been very worthwhile.”\n\nHe will be assigned to the Royal Navy’s newest hunter-killer submarine, HMS Agamemnon, nearing completion in Barrow.\n\n“The experience of bringing her out of construction, going through trials and training will be hugely important down the line for our programme,” Lieutenant Commander James added.\n\nHe and his fellow 16 students have undergone six months of academic training learning how a nuclear reactor works and how to control it, covering diverse, complex subjects including nuclear physics, metallurgy, advanced mathematics, thermodynamics and nuclear safety management.\n\nThat’s followed by three months of practice: learning the inner workings of nuclear systems and control room simulators to correctly respond to possible incidents and emergencies.\n\nInstructor Lieutenant Joe Roberts said the course was one of the most demanding in the Navy – students frequently drop out.\n\n“It’s a course which demands the best and the brightest – and the Australians have sent them, three outstanding students who will go far,” he continued.\n\n“It’s been something of an honour because these are the AUKUS pioneers. They will go on to lead their country’s future nuclear submarine programme.”\n\nLieutenant Kris Waldram, aged 40, from Cornwall, was one of the 14 Royal Navy students who successfully completed the course alongside the Australian trailblazers.\n\n“We have helped each other through the course. A submarine is regarded as being more complex than the Space Shuttle, so there’s an incredible amount of information to grasp,” he said.\n\n“I’ve been able to share my experience of my 23 years on nuclear submarines, the Australians helped with maths and the academic side of things when necessary. I think we’ve all benefitted from being on the same course.\n\n“The banter has been brilliant throughout – we’re very much on a similar wavelength – finishing with an Australian-themed end-of-course dinner, and the room filled with inflatable kangaroos.”\n\nLieutenant Steve added: “I think what’s been most surprising has been the parallels with the Brits – you can just jump in there, get started. Yes, we take the mickey and there’s banter, but at the end of the day we’re all best mates.”\n\nTheir success marks a significant milestone in developing the skilled workforce needed to operate Australia’s future conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarine capability being developed under the AUKUS tri-lateral security partnership between the UK, Australia and the US.\n\nIt was a topic high on the agenda during the Prime Minister’s first conversation with his counterpart, Anthony Albanese over his inaugural weekend in office.\n\nThe leaders also discussed key challenges facing the region, including strategic competition, climate change and agreed to build on the already strong AUKUS partnership."
