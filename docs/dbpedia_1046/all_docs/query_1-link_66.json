        "text": "Synopsis\n\nChief of Naval Staff Admiral R Hari Kumar on Tuesday said they have approached the Defence Ministry for an approval of changing the nomenclature of various ranks as they now have women sailors also. He also expressed hope that since gender neutrality has been introduced in the Indian Navy, it will have a woman chief in 30-35 years.\n\nPANAJI: Navy chief Admiral R Hari Kumar announced on Tuesday that a proposal to alter rank nomenclature and make them gender-neutral has been submitted to the Defence Ministry following the inclusion of women as sailors.\n\nSpeaking at the inauguration of the new administrative building of the Naval War College (NWC) in Verem, North Goa, the Chief of Naval Staff highlighted the Navy's shift towards gender neutrality and expressed optimism about the emergence of a female Naval chief in the foreseeable future.\n\n\"We follow all roles, all ranks. Hoping that 30-35 years down the line we will have a woman chief of naval staff speaking to you all,\" Admiral Kumar said.\n\nHe noted the current presence of a female commanding officer of a ship based in Goa and the introduction of women sailors within the ranks.\n\nAddressing the need for inclusive terminology, Admiral Kumar stated, \"Women cannot be sea-men,\" proposing designations such as 'nausainik class I' or 'nausainik class II' to ensure gender neutrality in rank titles\".\n\nHe underscored the Navy's commitment to aligning with the policies of the Government and embracing the concept of \"nari shakti\" (women's power) within the force.\n\nAdmiral Kumar emphasised the Navy's openness to women across all branches, including roles as marine commandos, based on their capability, confidence, competence, and ability to fulfil naval duties.\n\n\"We have women in the ranks for the first time since last year, and within a year-and-a-half, we have 1,124 women sailors. They are going to board ships shortly,\" he said.\n\nHe also stressed the importance of honouring India's heritage and shedding colonial legacies within the Navy.\n\n\"The effort is to move all the old things that we have inherited, the colonial stuff, and bring in pride based upon our viraasat (heritage),\" the Navy chief added.\n\nEstablished in 1988 as the College of Naval Warfare at INS Karanja, Mumbai, the institution was renamed the Naval War College in 2010 before relocating to Goa in 2011.\n\nThe college plays a crucial role in providing advanced professional military education to Indian Navy officers, with a focus on fostering future leadership through collaboration and training.\n\nIn line with the vision of 'SAGAR' - Security and Growth for All in the Region, the Naval War College conducts a maritime security course involving military officers from India's maritime neighbourhood.\n\nSince its inception, the college has trained 2,000 defence officers and 40 foreign officers.\n\nThe college has a mix of officers from all three services who are prepared for future leadership roles.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n3 key things Nirmala Sitharaman can do to restore Buddha’s legacy, draw global tourists\n\nWhy a new Sebi paper is making options traders sweat\n\nSpotted a flying saucer?
