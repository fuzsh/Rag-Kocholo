        "text": "A navy officer will lead the nation’s military for the first time in over two decades as Japan, Canada and other nations clamour to gain access to the technology-sharing benefits of the AUKUS pact.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese said it was an “easy decision” to elevate Australian Defence Force vice chief David Johnston to the top job, while Defence Minister Richard Marles praised him as a “safe pair of hands”.\n\nHowever, critics questioned whether Johnston would be able to drive major reform inside the ADF given he will serve a truncated two-year term in the role at his request, rather than the usual four years.\n\nJohnston, who has been Australia’s second most senior military figure since 2018, will replace long-serving Defence Force Chief Angus Campbell in July, with current Air Force Chief Robert Chipman promoted to ADF vice chief.\n\nThere had been speculation that Navy Chief Mark Hammond or Defence Force Chief of Joint Operations Greg Bilton would be given the assignment.\n\nInstead, Bilton will depart the Defence Force altogether and Hammond will remain in his current position as navy chief.\n\nJohnston will be the first naval officer to helm the Australian Defence Force since Chris Barrie in 2002, and comes to the job as Australia commits up to $368 billion over 30 years to acquire a nuclear-powered submarine fleet through AUKUS, a security pact with the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe three AUKUS nations on Tuesday agreed to begin talks to allow other nations to join the so-called “pillar II” of the pact, beginning with Japan.\n\nAs opposed to AUKUS pillar I – which focuses on the nuclear-powered submarines – the second pillar refers to collaboration on advanced technologies such as hypersonic weapons, quantum computing and artificial intelligence.\n\nLoading\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau indicated his nation also wanted to collaborate with the AUKUS nations on technology sharing as he flagged that Canada may need to invest in nuclear-powered submarines to patrol its waters.\n\nNew Zealand has also expressed interest in “pillar II”, while South Korea has also been mooted as a possible member.\n\nAlbanese stressed that co-operation on pillar II initiatives would be made on a “case-by-case” basis, and that AUKUS would remain a trilateral pact.\n\n“What is not proposed is to expand the membership of AUKUS,” he said.\n\nFormer prime minister Scott Morrison, who spearheaded the creation of AUKUS, said it was a “natural progression” to expand pillar II of the pact and that it made sense to begin with Japan.\n\nAnnouncing a suite of new defence appointments including promotions for senior female officers, Marles said that “this is a moment where we need a safe pair of hands and deep experience to take our defence force forward and there is no person who meets those qualities better than David Johnston”.\n\n“In the Indo-Pacific, Iraq and Afghanistan, Vice Admiral Johnston has consistently distinguished himself with his capacity to ensure that different elements of defence work together,” he said.\n\nJohnston joined the Defence Force in 1978, rising through the ranks after serving as a commanding officer on the HMAS Adelaide and HMAS Newcastle warships.\n\nFormer Defence official Michael Shoebridge criticised Johnston’s appointment, describing him as “the comfortable continuity candidate”.\n\nLoading\n\n“This appointment represents steady-as-she-goes and continuity at a time when we require urgent change,” he said.\n\n“This shows a disturbing complacency on behalf of the government.”\n\nShoebridge, director of Strategic Analysis Australia, said he would have preferred to see Bilton appointed to the role as he was more likely to drive significant reform within the ADF.\n\nPeter Dean, director of foreign policy and defence at the United States Studies Centre, countered: “David Johnston is a man of integrity with more knowledge than anyone else inside the ADF... He knows the system better than anyone else, which makes him ideally placed to reform the system.”\n\nRetired army major general Fergus McLachlan said he was unsurprised by Johnston’s appointment and that it made “eminent sense” for a navy officer to be appointed to the role.\n\n“He’s very well-respected, a consummate professional and a decent human being,” he said.\n\nOpposition Leader Peter Dutton and opposition defence spokesman Andrew Hastie congratulated Johnston on his appointment, saying: “As Australia faces increasing challenging strategic circumstances, we need strong leaders who will ensure our ADF is well-equipped with the capabilities and personnel needed to defend our nation.”\n\nMarles praised Campbell for leading the Defence Force through a period of “necessary and difficult change” since 2018, a period that included the handing down of the Brereton report into alleged war crimes by special forces soldiers in Afghanistan.\n\n“He oversaw the drawdown of Australian troops in the Middle East region and reorientation of our military focus to the Indo-Pacific,” Marles said.\n\n“He has been a strong advocate for operational accountability, strengthening our alliance and regional relationships, supporting the wellbeing of ADF personnel, and maximising the power and effectiveness of an integrated force.”\n\nCut through the noise of federal politics with news, views and expert analysis from Jacqueline Maley.
