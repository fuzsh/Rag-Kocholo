        "text": "Australia's highest-ranking military officer has talked down the prospect of an imminent war with China, but again warned the defence force must improve its recruitment and retention.\n\nSpeaking from Darwin, where he has been observing Exercise Pitch Black activities, the long-serving naval officer praised the capacity of Australia's defence force.\n\nHe told ABC News Breakfast his personnel were ready to support the region in a range of tasks.\n\n\"We have a remarkable Australian Defence Force, it's improving every day, Admiral David Johnston said in his first interview since taking on the top job of defence chief less than a month ago.\n\n\"We're bringing space and cyber and new equipment in, we have a 'ready ADF', we ready for the roles that the government may ask us to do.\"\n\nAsked about the possibility of military escalation with China and whether he was prepared to be a \"wartime defence chief\", Admiral Johnston said he did not think a major armed conflict involving Australia and its largest trading partner was imminent.\n\n\"We don't think that scenario you painted is in our imminent future but we're ready — from being able to support our community as we've done it [after] bushfires and other circumstances, through to supporting our region where they may need it.\"\n\nIn April, the federal government announced General Angus Campbell would be succeeded by his deputy, Vice Admiral David Johnston, for a two-year term as chief of defence, aligning with the other service chiefs — but he has hinted he can stay longer if needed.\n\n\"By the time my two years comes through, I will be the longest-serving three-star or four-star we've ever had, so I think there's a part of me that says, 'Well, that's a point in itself,' … Government will need to make a decision and I'll need to make a decision,\" Admiral Johnston said.\n\nDefence chief says ADF security vetting adequate\n\nSince becoming the first naval officer to assume command of the ADF in 22 years, Admiral Johnston has nominated growing the military's workforce as one of his biggest priorities for his term.\n\n\"We know we need to do more to improve our recruiting,\" he said.\n\n\"We're working really hard to keep the people that we have and to provide as good a set of conditions for them.\n\n\"Between making sure we're ready for the environment in which we might be required to operate and doing everything that we can to make sure we have the workforce that we need, that will keep me pretty busy for a while.\"\n\nThe long-serving military officer, who joined the navy as a teenage midshipman in 1978, said the organisation's culture was improving but the work to make that happen was \"continuing\".\n\n\"All of it makes us a better force. [It] makes us able to go into countries with an understanding of what it's like to bring people together.\"\n\nA Brisbane soldier was arrested last month on espionage charges.\n\nAdmiral Johnston said the ADF was always working to improve its security-vetting procedures but its current settings were adequate and foreign recruits were crucial.\n\n\"We do need to have dual citizens in the ADF,\" he said.\n\n\"There are many dual citizens in our community. We need to be representative of the community that we are, but we need to have confidence that our vetting procedures work well.\"\n\n\"In that particular matter, it was our systems that helped flag there were issues, so we're confident that the processes are sound, but we will keep working to make them better.\""
