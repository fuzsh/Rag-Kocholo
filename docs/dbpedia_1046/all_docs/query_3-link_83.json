        "text": "An Italian joint venture, Orizzonte Sistemi Navali (ONS), has been commissioned to build two additional FREMM frigates – an evolved (EVO) version – for the Italian Navy.\n\nCombining the expertise of Fincantieri (51%) and Leonardo (49%), ONS will produce two EVOs worth approximately €1.5bn ($1.61bn).\n\nCurrently, eight regular FREMM ships have been delivered to the service as part of a contract for ten units going back to November 2005. The final two of these frigates will be delivered by the end of 2025. This original order included ships for France, which ordered eight units, all of which have been delivered.\n\nFREMM EVO\n\nThe two new units will exploit important technological advancements already undertaken as part of recent programmes under the Defence Act, as well as the Mid-Life Upgrade project for Italy’s four Horizon-class destroyers, which will be available from 2027 onward.\n\nSpecifically, modernisation will concern the combat system, upgrading it to the SADOC 4 Cyber-resilient; radar sensors (specifically with fixed-face X-C dual-band radars) able to support defence against TBM threats; electronic warfare; artillery and missile systems; sonar suite; communication system and tactical data links capable of ensuring high level of itneroperability.\n\nIn addition, these two units will include the latest counter-uncrewed aerial system capabilities and the capacity for operational management of uncrewed systems across three dimensions (above the surface, on the sea and below the surface).\n\nMoreover, ONS will construct the two vessels at Fincantieri’s Integrated shipyard in Riva Trigoso and Muggiano, with the first ‘FREMM EVO’ due to be delivered in 2029 followed by the second unit in 2030. Simultaneously, Fincantieri will also construct Italy’s four future NFS U212 submarines at the Muggiano yard.\n\nA changed world\n\n“The acquisition of the two next-generation FREMM EVO frigates is part of the broader renewal… to adaptively, promptly, and effectively respond to current and future scenarios in a world that has rapidly changed in recent years,” explained Admiral Enrico Credendino, Chief of the Italian Navy.\n\nThe changing maritime scenario has seen the proliferation of uncrewed systems above, on and below the surface, and their effective use by asymmetric Ukrainian units in the Black Sea.\n\nThis will prompt navies to bolster their fleets according to the new types of threats encountered today.\n\nIn the coming weeks, ONS will finalise sub-contracts with Fincantieri and Leonardo, with a value respectively of around €690m and approximately €415m."
