        "text": "Destroy All Monster\n\nMy rating: 3 out of 5 stars\n\nDestroy All Monsters, the ninth film of the Godzilla franchise was released in 1968 and saw the return of Ishiro Honda as the director and essentially remade his last outing in the franchise. Honda used the screenplay written by himself and frequent collaborator Takeshi Kimura– credited under the pen name Kaoru Mabuchi—whose only work with the franchise was essentially a remake of Invasion of Astro-Monster and was actually good.\n\nAt the close of the 20th century, all of the Earth’s kaiju have been collected by the United Nations Science Committee and confined in an area known as Monsterland, located in the Ogasawara (Bonin in subtitles) Islands. A special control center is constructed underneath the island to ensure that the monsters stay secure and to serve as a research facility to study them.\n\nWhen communications with Monsterland are suddenly and mysteriously severed, and all of the monsters begin attacking world capitals, Dr. Yoshida of the UNSC orders Captain Yamabe and the crew of his spaceship, Moonlight SY-3, to investigate Ogasawara. There, they discover that the scientists, led by Dr. Otani, have become mind-controlled slaves of a feminine alien race identifying themselves as the Kilaaks, who reveal that they are in control of the monsters. Their leader demands that the human race surrender or face total annihilation.\n\nGodzilla attacks New York City, Rodan invades Moscow, Mothra lays waste to Beijing, Gorosaurus destroys Paris (although Baragon was credited for its destruction), and Manda attacks London. The attacks were set in to motion to draw attention away from Japan, so that the aliens can establish an underground stronghold near Mount Fuji. The Kilaaks then turn their next major attack onto Tokyo and, without serious opposition, become arrogant in their aims until the UNSC discover, after recovering the Kilaaks’ monster mind-control devices from around the world, that they have switched to broadcasting the control signals from their base under the Moon’s surface. In a desperate battle, the crew of the SY-3 destroys the Kilaak’s lunar outpost and returns the alien control system to Earth.\n\nWith all of the monsters under the control of the UNSC, the Kilaaks call King Ghidorah, who is dispatched to protect the alien stronghold at Mount Fuji, battling Godzilla, Minilla, Mothra, Rodan, Gorosaurus, Anguirus, Kumonga and Varan. While seemingly invincible, King Ghidorah is eventually overpowered by the combined strength of the Earth monsters and is killed. Refusing to admit defeat, the Kilaaks produce their ace, a burning monster they call the Fire Dragon, which begins to torch Tokyo and destroys the control center on Ogasawara. Suddenly, Godzilla attacks and destroys the Kilaaks’ underground base, revealing that the Earth’s monsters instinctively know who their enemies are. Captain Yamabe then pursues the Fire Dragon in the SY-3 and narrowly achieves victory for the human race. The Fire Dragon is revealed to be a flaming Kilaak saucer and is destroyed. With the Kilaaks defeated, Godzilla and the other monsters eventually return to Monsterland to live in peace.\n\nThe 88-minute runtime made this one of the shorter films so far in the franchise, but there was a lot of action to make things up. This film was from the beginning meant to feature monster fights and the human subplot was only there help push things to feature more monsters because frankly the scenes featuring just humans were pretty lame though when the aliens were there they were okay. I’ve said before this was a remake of Invasion of Astro-Monster and everything from humans exploring space to space aliens taking over the monsters, to the monster fighting Ghidorah at the end essentially shows that but unlike the previous film there were no plot holes and for Hondo no comedy and anthropomorphizing of Godzilla. There were some other technical bits like some of the miniatures not being up to the earlier franchise standards or the costumes not looking good, but frankly I don’t care as this was just a fun film to watch and one that I will rewatch if given the chance to.\n\nDestroy All Monsters is just a fun monster fight movie that is a vast improvement from several of the last few entries of the franchise including the film it essentially remade Invasion of Astro-Monster."
