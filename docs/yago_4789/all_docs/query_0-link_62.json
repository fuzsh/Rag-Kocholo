        "text": "films seen\n\n25/51\n\naverage score\n\n1.98*\n\nMovies\n\nMatango\n\nby Ishirô Honda\n\n1963 / 89m - Japan\n\nFantasy, Horror, Mystery\n\n3.0*/5.0*\n\nOne of Honda's most serious films. The camp is almost entirely absent, which is a curse as well as a blessing. The plot is still pretty cheesy, but the execution is very straight-faced. Overall it's moodier and more atmospheric compared to his other work, but the radioactive mushroom stuff is just too goofy to be taken seriously. Quite fun though.\n\nBattle in Outer Space\n\nby Ishirô Honda\n\nUchu Daisenso\n\n1959 / 90m - Japan\n\nSci-fi\n\n3.0*/5.0*\n\nI'm not sure whether spectacular is the right word, with so much obvious model work involved, but Battle in Outer Space is of Honda's bigger undertakings. There are lots of space scenes and the film has a strong focus on action, sci-fi and adventure, keeping the drama and conversations to a minimum. Read all\n\nBattle in Outer Space looks surprisingly competent for a Honda film, that doesn't take away that you're clearly looking at small-scale models. Don't expect realistic-looking space battles here, but if you appreciate the charm of Honda's trademark model work then there's plenty to enjoy. After a somewhat slow start, the film really delivers a barrage of pleasant cheese.\n\nDestroy All Monsters\n\nby Ishirô Honda\n\nKaijû Sôshingeki\n\n1968 / 88m - Japan\n\nSci-fi, Action\n\n2.5*/5.0*\n\nFeels like a classic Godzilla best-of film. All the monsters are here, there's a bunch of weird sci-fi stuff and some random extraterrestrial interference. Some Godzilla entries can be a little slow and tepid in between the fighting, there's simply so much happening here that they didn't have the time or money to waste film on any serious conversation. Good fun, but very, very cheesy.\n\nGodzilla vs. Monster Zero\n\nby Ishirô Honda\n\nKaijû Daisensô\n\n1965 / 93m - Japan\n\nSci-fi, Adventure\n\n2.5*/5.0*\n\nThis was pretty fun. You get a kaiju film and a space exploration film rolled into one. It's all very cheesy and cardboard-like of course, but there's hardly a dull moment and some there are some truly stand-out scenes. Apart from the original Godzilla film, this is one of the best Honda films I've seen so far.\n\nGorath\n\nby Ishirô Honda\n\nYôsei Gorasu\n\n1962 / 88m - Japan\n\nSci-fi\n\n2.5*/5.0*\n\nA lesser known Honda film. Gorath isn't the name of a giant monster, but of a star that is on a collision course with Earth. Don't worry though, it's a vintage Honda film that has everything you'd expect to see in his films. Yes, even a giant monster (no matter how random his appearance may be). Read all\n\nThe first half hour is a bit sluggish, but once Honda is allowed to go crazy with his trademark miniatures sets and vehicles, Gorath becomes a lot more interesting. Add to that a giant sea lion and some good old destruction fun (poor Tokyo) and what you have is a pretty cheesy yet entertaining film.\n\nMothra\n\nby Ishirô Honda\n\nMosura\n\n1961 / 101m - Japan\n\nFantasy, Adventure\n\n2.5*/5.0*\n\nGodzilla is by far Honda's most popular property, but Mothra may very well have an even bigger cult following. I've seen the creature before in several Godzilla films, but never managed to catch the original one. While it fits very well within Honda's oeuvre, Mothra has a slightly different focus that may suprised seasoned Godzilla fans. Read all\n\nMothra is probably one of Honda's cuter creatures, looking more like a cuddly teddy bear than a fearsome monster. It appears slightly more menacing in its caterpillar state, but it never measures up to Godzilla's angrier adversaries. The start is pretty slow and 100 minutes it's a bit long for a film like this, but once Mothra finally take center stage there's enough Honda magic for faithful fans. Not bad, but I prefer Honda's crazier films.\n\nGodzilla\n\nby Ishirô Honda\n\nGojira\n\n1954 / 96m - Japan\n\nSci-fi, Horror\n\n2.5*/5.0*\n\nTerror of Mechagodzilla\n\nby Ishirô Honda\n\nMekagojira no Gyakushû\n\n1975 / 79m - Japan\n\nSci-fi, Action\n\n2.0*/5.0*\n\nHonda's final film is another decent entry in the Godzilla franchise, without bringing anything too special or out of the ordinary. There's a lot of sci-fi cheese to brighten things up and the battles between Godzilla, Mechagodzilla and Titanosaurus are plentiful, but there's not enough to make it stand out from the many other entries in the franchise.\n\nYog: The Space Amoeba\n\nby Ishirô Honda\n\nGezora, Ganime, Kameba: Kessen! Nankai no Daikaijû\n\n1970 / 84m - Japan\n\nSci-fi, Adventure\n\n2.0*/5.0*\n\nLatitude Zero\n\nby Ishirô Honda\n\nIdo Zero Daisakusen\n\n1969 / 105m - Japan\n\nSci-fi, Adventure\n\n2.0*/5.0*\n\nAn Ishiro Honda film with a more international setup, but that doesn't really change a whole lot. I'm watching his films for the cheese and the cute model work, and both are available in spades here. It's a pretty decent adventure too, with a tad more happening than is usually the case. Read all\n\nThere's a bit of everything here, from lost/hidden worlds to laser fights and mutant animals. It makes little sense, but it allows Honda to play around like the giant kidult he is. It also makes sure there are few dull moments. It's not the most glorious or fancy cinema, but there's an undeniable charm that makes these films quite easy to watch.\n\nKing Kong Escapes\n\nby Ishirô Honda\n\nKingukongu no Gyakushû\n\n1967 / 96m - Japan\n\nSci-fi, Adventure\n\n2.0*/5.0*\n\nThe War of the Gargantuas\n\nby Ishirô Honda\n\nFurankenshutain no Kaijû: Sanda tai Gaira\n\n1966 / 92m - Japan\n\nAction, Horror\n\n2.0*/5.0*\n\nFeels slightly more serious than most entries in the Godzilla franchise, at the same time also a little less entertaining. It's a decent film that is going to please fans of Honda, but the Frankenstein creatures aren't as enigmatic as Godzilla and even though the film is short, it does drag a little in places. Not bad, but not a stand-out Honda either.\n\nFrankenstein Conquers the World\n\nby Ishirô Honda\n\nFurankenshutain Tai Chitei Kaijû Baragon\n\n1965 / 87m - Japan\n\nSci-fi, Horror\n\n2.0*/5.0*\n\nA typical Honda film, with a couple of huge monsters battling it out after a relatively lengthy intro and a drawn-out middle part. Of course the atom bomb has its role to play in the setup of the story, but ultimately these films are all about campy fun and elaborate destruction. It's decent filler, but I don't think I'll ever become a big fan of Honda's work.\n\nGhidorah, the Three-Headed Monster\n\nby Ishirô Honda\n\nSan Daikaijû: Chikyu Saidai no Kessen\n\n1964 / 85m - Japan\n\nAction, Adventure\n\n2.0*/5.0*\n\nGhidorah may be one of the most appealing monsters within the Godzilla universe, his introduction to the series is rather plain. Mothra and Rodan are present for the battle, but all they really do is flick stones at each other, in a rural landscape. The result is a pretty plain and uneventful entry in the Godzilla franchise.\n\nVaran the Unbelievable\n\nby Ishirô Honda\n\nDaikaijû Baran\n\n1958 / 87m - Japan\n\nHorror, Adventure\n\n2.0*/5.0*\n\nA very simple Godzilla knock-off by Honda, the Kaiju master himself. If you like giant lizards with spiky backsides and grueling howls, destroying Japanese villages (small and large), this film has everything you need. The monster is somewhat pointless though and the film is extremely predictable, but it's fun enough while it lasts.\n\nThe Mysterians\n\nby Ishirô Honda\n\nChikyû Bôeigun\n\n1957 / 85m - Japan\n\nSci-fi, Action\n\n2.0*/5.0*\n\nRodan\n\nby Ishirô Honda\n\n1956 / 82m - Japan\n\nSci-fi, Horror\n\n2.0*/5.0*\n\nNot too long after releasing the original Godzilla movie, Honda came with Rodan. It's a pretty classic Kaiju film that neatly sticks to genre conventions. Then again, Honda is the one who created half of these conventions, so that probably shouldn't come as a big surprise. The result is a little basic, but good fun nonetheless. Read all\n\nMen in rubber suits, miniature sets that get trashed, a tiny bit of adventuring and some war tactics. The human vs nature theme is also very present, making this a very typical early Kaiju flick. It's not one of Honda's more inspired films, the monster itself is a bit too boring for that, but there's enough cheesy charm to fill the short runtime.\n\nAll Monsters Attack\n\nby Ishirô Honda\n\nGojira-Minira-Gabara: Oru Kaijû Daishingeki\n\n1969 / 70m - Japan\n\nAction, Adventure\n\n1.5*/5.0*\n\nA nonsensical Godzilla film that slaps two unrelated plot lines together and still manages to get some additional Godzilla action in there. There's a lot of different monsters present, but they only appear in a kid's dream, and they're just battling it out on their own territory. It feels pretty cheap, but at least it's short and the scenes on Monster Island are decent.\n\nDogora\n\nby Ishirô Honda\n\nUchû Daikaijû Dogora\n\n1964 / 83m - Japan\n\nSci-fi, Crime\n\n1.5*/5.0*\n\nOne of Honda's lesser-known kaiju films. It's not that different from his other work, apart from some minor details. Too much time is spent on human squabbles, and not enough attention goes to the kaiju. The effects are cheesy but fun, but seeing how they only feature in a small part of the film, the cheese doesn't quite work. Read all\n\nThe alien concept is pretty cool, but the effects are way too obvious and the monster scenes are way too scarce for a film of this caliber. The performance and the human drama are horrible. I do understand the budgetary and technical limitations, but the balance is just off. Not the best Honda, but the kaiju bits are still fun.\n\nMothra vs. Godzilla\n\nby Ishirô Honda\n\nMosura tai Gojira\n\n1964 / 89m - Japan\n\nSci-fi, Action\n\n1.5*/5.0*\n\nAtragon\n\nby Ishirô Honda\n\nKaitei Gunkan\n\n1963 / 94m - Japan\n\nSci-fi, Adventure\n\n1.5*/5.0*\n\nKingu Kongu tai Gojira\n\nby Ishirô Honda\n\nKingu Kongu tai Gojira\n\n1962 / 97m - Japan\n\nFantasy, Action\n\n1.5*/5.0*\n\nThe H-Man\n\nby Ishirô Honda\n\nBijo to Ekitainingen\n\n1958 / 79m - Japan\n\nHorror, Crime\n\n1.5*/5.0*\n\nA pretty disappointing Honda. I even had to double-check whether I got the right film, as it starts as a plain police/crime thriller. Not really what I expected from a Honda film, later on minor horror elements are added and his signature style starts to shine through a little, but overall it remained quite boring. Read all\n\nThe effects are crummy, Honda isn't really suited to direct cop thrillers and the performances are quite poor. It's just a very sluggish and dull film. The finale quarter is slightly better as things heat up (quite literally), but watching transparent goo isn't as much fun as seeing someone prance around in a rubber suit. Not a fan.\n\nEagle of the Pacific\n\nby Ishirô Honda\n\nTaiheiyô no Washi\n\n1953 / 119m - Japan\n\nWar\n\n1.5*/5.0*\n\nA pre-Godzilla, and so pre-Kaiju film from Honda. Honda's main draw has always been his miniature work, which still comes in handy when doing a war flick. Without the Kaiju cheese though, it's not really the same thing. Eagle of the Pacific is a more serious take on the Pearl Harbor attack. Read all\n\nThe first hour is pretty slow, it isn't until the second half that the war scenes introduce some much-needed action. With people like Mifune and Shimura on board this was certainly not an inconspicuous project, though it's not a film that really stands out as majestic nowadays. I'm not surprised Honda took a different path after this.\n\nDreams\n\nYume\n\n1990 / 119m - Japan\n\nFantasy\n\n0.5*/5.0*"
