Gojira) is the roaring, stomping, fire-breathing granddaddy of all monster movies! Japan’s biggest domestic box-office hit of the 1950s, Godzilla is a pointedly allegorical creature feature (or “kaiju”), made when the country was reeling from nuclear attack and H-bomb testing in the Pacific. Its rampaging radioactive beast, the poignant and terrifying embodiment of an entire population’s fears, stuck a chord with audiences around the world, becoming an international icon of destruction and spawning countless sequels and remakes. Directed by the great Ishiro Honda (who went on to make other kaiju classics like Rodan and Mothra), and starring Kurosawa-regular Takashi Shimura as the leading human (although we all know who the real star is!), the original Godzilla is a genuinely frightening tale that’s miles away from the campy tone of later installments, while still delivering the big monster fun thanks to the beloved “suitmation” special effects by legendary effects artist Eiji Tsuburaya. See where it all began and prepare to be thrilled and chilled, because after all, they don’t call Godzilla the “King of the Monsters” for nothing! (Dir. by Ishiro Honda, 1954, Japan, in Japanese with English subtitles, 98 mins., Not Rated)"
