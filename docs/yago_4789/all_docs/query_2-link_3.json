        "text": "when a Monster is born too tall, too strong, too heavy, that is a tragedy.\n\nâ€• Honda, speaking about his film Rodan\n\nIshiro Honda was a Japanese film director known for directing and writing many films in Toho's Showa era. He is most famous for directing eleven Godzilla films, including the Original 1954 film, as well as other kaiju films such as Rodan and The Mysterians.\n\nHe was born on May 7, 1911, and ended up passing away on February 28, 1993, at the age of 81.\n\nLife[]\n\nHonda is probably best known for his tokusatsu films including several entries in the Godzilla series. He directed the original Godzilla film along with King Kong vs. Godzilla, Mothra vs. Godzilla, Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster and many others until 1975. He also directed tokusatsu films such as Rodan and Mothra. His last feature film was Terror of Mechagodzilla.\n\nThe following years were spent directing various sci-fi TV shows. The superhero shows Return of Ultraman, Mirrorman and Zone Fighter were also his. In addition, he directed the cult film, Matango.\n\nAt the end of his career, he returned to working as an assistant director for his old friend, legendary director Akira Kurosawa. Allegedly one segment of the Kurosawa film, Dreams, was actually directed by Honda following Kurosawa's detailed storyboards.\n\nHis most memorable quote: \"Monsters are born too tall, too strong, too heavy, that is their tragedy,\" when he spoke of his film, Rodan. This statement alone would give fans the impression that his intent was to give all kaiju a distinct personality instead of just being a monster-on-the-loose.\n\nFilmography[]\n\nGodzilla (1954)\n\nRodan (1956)\n\nThe Mysterians (1957)\n\nH-Man (1958)\n\nVaran (1958)\n\nBattle in Outer Space (1959)\n\nMothra (1961)\n\nGorath (1962)\n\nKing Kong vs. Godzilla (1962)\n\nMatango (1963)\n\nAtragon (1963)\n\nMothra vs. Godzilla (1964)\n\nDogora (1964)\n\nGhidorah, the Three-Headed Monster (1964)\n\nFrankenstein Conquers the World (1965)\n\nInvasion of Astro-Monster (1965)\n\nWar of the Gargantuas (1966)\n\nKing Kong Escapes (1967)\n\nDestroy All Monsters (1968)\n\nLatitude Zero (1969)\n\nAll Monsters Attack (1969)\n\nSpace Amoeba (1970)\n\nThe Return of Ultraman (selected episodes, 1970-1971)\n\nTerror of Mechagodzilla (1975)\n\nTrivia[]\n\nIshiro Honda was reportedly supposed to direct Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II in 1993, but he passed away earlier that year.\n\nIshiro Honda said in an interview conducted only months before his death that his favorite film he worked on was The Mysterians.[1]\n\nReferences[]"
