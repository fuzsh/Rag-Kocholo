        "text": "“\n\nMonsters are tragic beings. They’re not bad [willingly]. They’re born too tall, too strong, too heavy; that’s their tragedy. They don’t attack [mankind] voluntarily, but because of their physical dimensions they cause danger and grief; therefore man defends himself against them. After several stories of this type, the public finds sympathy for the monsters.\n\n„\n\n— Ishiro Honda, speaking of his film Rodan\n\n“\n\nWhether for good or bad, Godzilla decided the course of my life.\n\n„\n\n— Honda on the impact Godzilla had on his career\n\nIshiro Honda (本多 猪 (い)四 (し)郎 (ろう), Honda Ishirō), frequently miscredited as Inoshiro Honda (本多 猪 (いの)四 (し)郎 (ろう), Honda Inoshirō), was a Japanese film director and screenwriter. He is most famous for directing eight Godzilla movies, including the 1954 original, as well as other Toho kaiju films such as Rodan and The Mysterians.\n\nBiography\n\nIshiro Honda is probably best known for the many science fiction films which he directed for Toho, including eight entries in the Godzilla series. He directed the original Godzilla along with King Kong vs. Godzilla, Mothra vs. Godzilla, All Monsters Attack and many others throughout the 1950s and 1960s. He also directed other tokusatsu films for Toho such as Rodan and Mothra during this time. Aside from the original Godzilla, the 1963 cult horror film Matango is widely considered Honda's greatest work. Honda was a frequent collaborator of the legendary special effects director Eiji Tsuburaya, who directed or received credit for the effects for all of Honda's kaiju films until he passed away in 1970. Due to Tsuburaya's failing health during filming for All Monsters Attack, Honda directed the film's special effects sequences himself with assistance from Teruyoshi Nakano, with Tsuburaya still receiving honorary credit as the film's special effects supervisor.\n\nAfter directing the kaiju film Space Amoeba in 1970, Honda spent the following years directing episodes of various sci-fi TV shows. Episodes of the superhero shows Return of Ultraman, Mirror Man and Zone Fighter were directed by Honda. Honda also served as the editor for the reissues of films that were screened during the Toho Champion Festival in the early 1970s. His final feature film came with 1975's Terror of Mechagodzilla, which would also prove to be the final entry in the original Showa series of Godzilla films.\n\nAt the end of his career, Honda returned to working as an assistant director for his old friend, legendary director Akira Kurosawa. It is sometimes alleged that Honda directed one of the segments of the 1990 Kurosawa film Dreams, \"The Tunnel,\" in which a company commander faces the ghosts of his platoon after World War II. This has not been proven; however, Honda's wife Kimi was convinced that his nightmares inspired the segment.\n\nSelected filmography\n\nDirector\n\nGodzilla (1954)\n\nHalf Human (1955)\n\nRodan (1956)\n\nThe Mysterians (1957)\n\nThe H-Man (1958)\n\nVaran (1958)\n\nSampo (1959) [1962 Japanese dub]\n\nBattle in Outer Space (1959)\n\nThe Human Vapor (1960)\n\nMothra (1961)\n\nGorath (1962)\n\nKing Kong vs. Godzilla (1962)\n\nMatango (1963)\n\nAtragon (1963)\n\nMothra vs. Godzilla (1964)\n\nDogora (1964)\n\nGhidorah, the Three-Headed Monster (1964)\n\nFrankenstein vs. Baragon (1965)\n\nInvasion of Astro-Monster (1965)\n\nThe War of the Gargantuas (1966)\n\nKing Kong Escapes (1967)\n\nDestroy All Monsters (1968)\n\nLatitude Zero (1969)\n\nAll Monsters Attack (1969)\n\nSpace Amoeba (1970)\n\nReturn of Ultraman (TV 1970-1971) [episodes 1-2, 7, 9, 51]\n\nMirror Man (TV 1971-1972) [episodes 1-2]\n\nEmergency 10-4, 10-10 (TV 1972) [episodes 5-6, 20-21]\n\nThunder Mask (TV 1972) [episodes 1-2, 4-5, 14-15]\n\nZone Fighter (TV 1973) [episodes 3-4, 12-13, 18-19, 23-24]\n\nTerror of Mechagodzilla (1975)\n\nUnproduced works\n\nSpace Mons (1962) [became Dogora][6]\n\nThe Flying Battleship (1966)[7]\n\nDaimajin (1984)\n\nNew Godzilla (1992)[9]\n\nScreenwriter\n\nGodzilla (1954) [with Takeo Murata]\n\nThe War of the Gargantuas (1966) [with Kaoru Mabuchi]\n\nDestroy All Monsters (1968) [with Kaoru Mabuchi]\n\nEditor\n\nKing Kong vs. Godzilla (1970) [Toho Champion Festival reissue; uncredited]\n\nMothra vs. Godzilla (1970) [Toho Champion Festival reissue; uncredited]\n\nThe Great Monster War: King Ghidorah vs. Godzilla (1971) [uncredited]\n\nGodzilla, Mothra, King Ghidorah: The Greatest Battle on Earth (1971) [uncredited]\n\nEbirah, Horror of the Deep (1972) [Toho Champion Festival reissue; uncredited]\n\nGodzilla: The Great Blitz Operation (1972) [uncredited]\n\nSon of Godzilla (1973) [Toho Champion Festival reissue; uncredited]\n\nKing Kong Escapes (1973) [Toho Champion Festival reissue; uncredited]\n\nMothra (1974) [Toho Champion Festival reissue; uncredited]\n\nThe Great Undersea War: Latitude Zero (1974) [uncredited]\n\nThe Mysterians (1978) [Toho Champion Festival reissue; uncredited]\n\nActor\n\nGodzilla (1954) as power station worker [uncredited]\n\nToho Unused Special Effects Complete Collection (1986) as himself, interviewee\n\nRebirth of Mothra (1996) [photo; posthumous]\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nAll Monsters Attack (1969) - Director of special effects [uncredited; with Teruyoshi Nakano]\n\nGallery\n\nHonda directing Eagle of the Pacific\n\nHonda (right) with Akihiko Hirata (left)\n\nHonda with Eiji Tsuburaya\n\nHonda with a Godzilla puppet\n\nHonda directing on set for Half Human\n\nHonda directing on set for King Kong vs. Godzilla\n\nHonda with Kumi Mizuno\n\nHonda (right) with Akira Kurosawa (left)\n\nHonda with Martin Scorsese on location for Akira Kurosawa's Dreams\n\nHonda's cameo in Rebirth of Mothra\n\nVideos\n\nIshiro Honda filming Ran\n\nYoshimitsu Banno interviews\n\nIshiro Honda in 1990\n\nTrivia\n\nIshiro Honda visited the set of several Heisei Godzilla films before his death in 1993, and despite rumors that he was slated to direct Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II, Honda expressed no interest in returning to the series, content with his work on Akira Kurosawa's films.\n\nHonda stated in an interview conducted only months before his death that his favorite film he worked on was The Mysterians.[13]\n\nDr. Ishiro Serizawa, a character in Godzilla (2014) and Godzilla: King of the Monsters, is named after Honda. In the June 2012 revision of the Godzilla script, he was called \"Doctor Honda.\"\n\nA fictionalized version of Honda appears in the fifth episode of the fourth season of the TV series DC's Legends of Tomorrow, played by Eijiro Ozaki.\n\nStar Wars: The Clone Wars writer Henry Gilroy named the pirate Hondo Ohnaka after Ishiro Honda and actor Seiji Onaka.
