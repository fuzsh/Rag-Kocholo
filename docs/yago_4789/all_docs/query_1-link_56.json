        "text": "In the far-off future of 1999, man and kaijū co-exist peacefully, with the giant monsters confined to an island known as Monsterland. An alien race, the Kilaaks, invades Earth, mind-controlling Godzilla and co, and setting them loose upon the world’s major cities. Humanity works to free the monsters from their controlling invaders but, before peace can be restored, they must team-up to take on the aliens’ secret weapon: the all-powerful space monster, King Ghidorah!\n\nFeaturing Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan, Anguirus, Baragon, Manda, Gorosaurus and more, this all-out monster showdown brings together creatures from across the many kaijū movies produced by Tōhō following the success of Godzilla (1954). This is the Avengers Assemble of giant monster flicks, way before Marvel built their own cinematic universe and with a heck of a lot more rubber suits.\n\nIn response to waning cinema attendance in Japan, Destroy All Monsters seeks a more family friendly appeal, trading seriousness for silliness. By this point in the franchise, the portrayal of Godzilla and other monsters had changed from frightening forces of nature to heroic figures that protected Earth from alien invaders.\n\nWith the thoughtful, contemplative nature of the series’ origins long gone, the emphasis is now placed elsewhere: more monsters, more fighting, and more action in an effort to emulate professional wrestling, which was wildly popular in Japan at the time."
