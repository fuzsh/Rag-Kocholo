Click here to learn more about accessibility at the Tomorrow Theater.\n\nTHE EXPERIENCE\n\nContinue the Godzilla birthday celebration with a spectacular assembly of kaiju! Rodan, Mothra, King Ghidorah, and many more make an appearance in this battle of the century. Local VFX supervisor and production designer Joshua Cox will give a talk before the film, in honor of Godzilla’s recent VFX Oscar win.\n\nON SCREEN: Destroy All Monsters\n\n1968. Directed by Ishirô Honda and Jun Fukuda. Runtime: 88 minutes. Rated G.\n\nThe original Godzilla team of director Ishiro Honda, special-effects supervisor Eiji Tsuburaya, and composer Akira Ifukube reunited for this 1968 kaiju extravaganza, which features no fewer than eleven monsters. Set in the remote future of 1999, when the people of Earth have achieved world peace by confining destructive creatures to Monsterland (until—spoiler alert—an alien race intervenes), Destroy All Monsters mounts a thrilling display of innovative action sequences and memorable images that have made it a favorite for generations of viewers."
