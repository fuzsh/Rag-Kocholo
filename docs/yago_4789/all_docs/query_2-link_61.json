        "text": "(Check out Part One HERE)\n\nHere we are, heading into what some consider the best decade period for the Godzilla film series. The 1960’s were the height of the Showa era features, and have some absolute classic entries into the series. We will also see that even though Godzilla is usually considered a leading monster in the creature feature genre, in this decade other classic Toho monsters will make their first appearances. Now, there are some monsters, particularly fan favorites such as Mothra and Rodan, who had already been establish as monster of their own films, but being under the production umbrella of Toho, found most of their success within the Godzilla franchise.\n\nTHE 1960's:\n\nSeven films fill up this decade, and my what a collection they are. The variety within these seven films is very interesting as well. We have some films that are classics and aside from the original Gojira, are considered possibly the best the series as a whole has to offer. Also, we have some more kid oriented films that fell a little flat (we know Gamera is the true friend of all children). Another fun thing to note is that Godzilla's name only falls in the official title of three of the films, while the others are either feature another monster or boast of a entire cast of monsters. This really shows how in the 1960's, kaiju-mania was going stronger than ever. Let's delve into the films of the decade.\n\nKING KONG VS. GODZILLA\n\n1962\n\nDIRECTED BY ISHIRO HONDA\n\nAfter a 7 year drought of Godzilla films, he came roaring back in this epic clash of the monsters. Originally set to be King Kong versus a different monster, it found its way to Toho in the development stages and Godzilla fell into the role of antagonist in this film. Classic battles and excellent cinematography highlight this feature as we follow two monsters finding their way to Japan. A drunk Kong is captured by some men for a TV company, while a newly awoken Godzilla heads to mainland Japan to wreck havoc. Kong escapes his capture, but comes ashore to find Godzilla. The two eventually engage in a true clash of the titans at the summit of Mt. Fuji that ends with a tumbling bout into the sea.\n\nThis film was a fantastic way for the 1960's to offer a sort of rebirth to the Godzilla franchise, and this is a key turning point as well. King Kong vs. Godzilla was such a well attended film, that Toho found themselves looking a profitable franchise. From here, the films went on a nearly decade and half run of being a constant in Japanese cinema, and finding its way all around the world.\n\nMOTHRA VS. GODZILLA\n\n1964\n\nDIRECTED BY ISHIRO HONDA\n\nIn the first of many encounters with each other, we find Mothra pitted against Godzilla with the fate of Japan in the balance. After a typhoon brings a good amount of debris onshore, a giant egg is found. An entrepreneur manages to buy it away from the locals, and looks to exploit it for his own gains. Little does he know that this is the egg of Mothra, and sure enough the famous tiny twins of Infant Island come to try to get it back. After being denied, they ally up with the journalistic duo, and find more than they bargain for as within the debris is Godzilla himself! After pleading with the twins to get Mothra to help, eventually an old, and near death, Mothra makes one last stand as Godzilla leaves devastation behind him as he heads for the egg. Mothra dies in battle, but two new Mothra larva burst from the egg, and manage to subdue Godzilla with their silk spray.\n\nThis is truly the start of a strange but wonderful relationship that evolves over the years. A rough beginning, for sure, but so many small hallmarks can be seen in this one film. From the sacrificial Mothra to the David vs Goliath feel of Godzilla vs the larva, we find these happen a few more times as these kaiju will cross paths as both allies and enemies in many films to come.\n\nGHIDORAH, THE THREE HEADED MONSTER\n\n1964\n\nDIRECTED BY ISHIRO HONDA\n\nThis one really embraces the sci-fi aspect of the Godzilla franchise, and also introduces what many see as Godzilla's biggest rival, Ghidorah. We have everything for UFO conferences, meteors, possession of people by fleeing entities of Venus, and an assassination plot all wrapped up around a huge kaiju battle. We follow the exploits of the Prophetess, a refugee from Venus, who came to Earth in retreat of Ghidorah. His prophecies all come to be valid, and what it leads to is the arrival of Ghidorah. Mothra attempts to bring both Godzilla and Rodan together to fight a golden monstrosity, but they do not join immediately. After Mothra heroically tries to fend off Ghidorah alone, both Godzilla and Rodan put aside their difference to drive Ghidorah from Earth.\n\nThe heavy doses of sci-fi elements really make this film a stand out in the series. Quite possibly the best thing about the franchise as a whole is the variety in themes. From political to environmental, from dark tones to kaiju smash-em-ups, each one has its own essence. This film also gives a glimpse of the kind of team ups and mixtures of kaiju that will come to pass.\n\nINVASION OF ASTRO-MONSTER\n\n1965\n\nDIRECTED BY ISHIRO HONDA\n\nAnother sci-fi heavy thriller, we find two astronauts landing on a newly discovered Planet X, and they encounter a humanoid alien race, know as the Xiliens. They showcase their struggles against Monster Zero, who turns out to be King Ghidorah. They offer a cure for cancer in exchange for the assistance of Godzilla and Rodan from Earth to stop Monster Zero. The swindle is on as the Xiliens actually use it all as a ploy to get Godzilla and Rodan to their planet and put all three monsters under mental control to take over Earth. The invasion begins but can only be thwarted by the combined efforts of the astronauts, scientists, and an inventor. A final battle rages on Earth between all three kaiju engage in a spectacular finish.\n\nThe second film in a row to feature King Ghidorah, it also boasts of one of the more memorable alien races. The Xilien's out of this world outfits and driving force in the film have put them in high regard among Godzilla fans. We also are treated to the Godzilla jump-dance meme in this film, which for better or worse will never go away. That is one thing that also is endearing with Godzilla films, is that the films tread both a serious and comical tone seemingly at once. The situation, model cities, and kaiju sequences can be everything from intense to laughable, but always add something to the franchise regardless.\n\nEBIRAH, HORROR OF THE DEEP\n\n1966\n\nDIRECTED BY JUN FUKUDA\n\nA very unique entry into the Godzilla series, the plot revolves around a search for a lost brother at sea until they are attacked by Ebirah, a large lobster like kaiju. This attack leaves the four men shipwrecked on a Pacific Island run a by the terrorist group called Red Bamboo. Red Bamboo are making heavy water to sell for the creation of WMD's, and are using slave native workers from nearby Infant Island to do their dirty work. The group of men and some natives work together to awaken Godzilla, who is found to be hibernating on the island. The native's call for help is also headed by Mothra, who comes to aid them as well. Red Bamboo launch attacks with jets and a giant condor, but Godzilla fights them off and engages Ebirah in a brutal sea battle. The men find the lost brother just in time as Mothra comes to airlift the natives off the island. Godzilla tries to intervene, but Mothra holds him off long enough for the dramatic escape to be finalized as a bomb goes off, destroying the island and its terrorist foundations.\n\nThis was originally set to be a King Kong film, but as its development went through many rejections, Toho took it and inserted Godzilla in Kong's role. The film also has a different feel to it, being set mainly on an island and not on mainland Japan. The role of the organization Red Bamboo also adds to its uniqueness, and makes this film feel more like a action thriller than the recent sci-fi heavy films that lead to it.\n\nSON OF GODZILLA\n\n1967\n\nDIRECTED BY JUN FUKUDA\n\nOur first look into Godzilla as a family man is here. Scientists on an island work on weather altering experiments, they accidentally release radiation that makes giant mantis, called Kamacuras, get even bigger. The Kamacuras dig up an egg, containing a baby Godzilla. Its psychic cries bring Godzilla to its aid, who fights off the Kamacuras and takes the youngling in as his own. Godzilla goes through a long montage of trying to teach his son, now named Minilla, how to be a true kaiju. Eventually, Minilla manages to awaken a giant spider, Kumonga. Kumonga attempts to kill Minilla in his web, but Godzilla arrives just in time. Both Godzilla and Minilla work to defeat Kumonga, and the scientists activate their weather-altering device as they leave, covering the island in a blizzard, and sending Godzilla and Minilla into a hibernation state.\n\nAnd so we meet the family. This film was done to hit a little bit of a different crowd, and had a lower budget than normal, but it still succeeds in being a solid showing. The puppetry and marionette work done with Kumonga are quite impressive, and it definitely feels like something both kids and adults can enjoy watching. A little lighthearted, but still a Godzilla film through and through.\n\nDESTROY ALL MONSTERS\n\n1968\n\nDIRECTED BY ISHIRO HONDA\n\nBefore the Avengers, there was Destroy All Monsters. By far the biggest ensemble of monsters on screen, this film goes all out. With most of the monsters now living in peace on an island called Monsterland, the world is calm. Suddenly, the monsters start branching out and attacking major cities across the globe. We find the reason behind this is a female alien species known as the Kilaaks, who have put all the monsters under mind control (a reoccurring theme for sure) and will destroy the Earth unless it surrenders. Scientists and the spaceship Moonlight SY-3 work to find the a solution to the attacks. After collecting the mind control devices, the Kilaaks plans and bases of operations are discovered. The Kilaaks have one last ace up their sleeve, King Ghidorah. Ghidorah attacks, but is no match to the huge cast of monsters waiting for him. The Kilaaks are defeated, and the monsters return to the island in peace.\n\nThis film is often praised for its monster action and criticized for its plot. All this is truly fair, as it is a seemingly rinse and repeat of other Godzilla stories, but the main attraction, being the multitude of kaiju, is where it shines. This is the film that the kid inside me still loves to this day, despite what shortcomings it does have. A total of eleven Toho kaiju are seen in this film, and that far exceeds any previous entry. It truly banked on that fact alone, but it’s just as memorable for it.\n\nALL MONSTERS ATTACK\n\n1969\n\nDIRECTED BY ISHIRO HONDA\n\nIshiro Honda directs his sixth Godzilla film of the decade, and unfortunately, the last entry in the decade falls a little flat. It feels like more of a children's film about bullying. We follow the exploits of a latchkey kid named Ichiro. Ichiro has to deal with being home alone quite often, and with neighborhood bullies. His only escape is to dream of Godzilla and his son Minilla, and sees himself there interacting with them. Ichiro and Minilla form a bond in his dream, and what seems to happen to Ichiro is mirrored into experience for Minilla. Ichiro is chased by bullies and ends up in a old warehouse, where he accidentally takes the ID of some robbers who are hiding out in the warehouse. They track down Ichiro, and take him hostage. Ichiro goes back and forth from the real world to seeking help from Godzilla and Minilla, and finds Minilla is able to stand up to the bully monster Gabara, and Ichiro then finds it in himself to stand up and stand strong. Ichiro manages to outsmart the robbers and stand up to his bullies, and the movie ends on a high note.\n\nThe film plays out in an odd way, as all of the monster action is within Ichiro's dreams. A good amount of noticeable reused footage fills a good portion of the action as well, and the antagonist, Gabara, has a somewhat simple design. It's definitely a different take on a Godzilla film, but not one that holds high regard with Godzilla fans.\n\nNow the 1960's had come and gone, leaving us with 8 Godzilla films. A heavy amount of sci-fi and alien action was the highlight, as more and more characters began to fill out the Godzilla universe. As the decade came to the close, a bit of Godzilla fatigue began to set in, and continued into the 1970's, which we will see leads to the true end of the first era of Godzilla films."
