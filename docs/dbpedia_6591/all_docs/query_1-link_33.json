It drags McNamara’s book into the 21st Century while echoing life in “small town Ireland”. The title has become a well-known phrase for nosey neighbours and twitching curtains.\n\nWith music by 18th Century Irish composer John Field played live, and an electronic score by Michael Scott the production creates a great evening of theatre that will put you on the edge of your seat.\n\nMacNamara in his depiction of a small Irish village, joins Synge and O’Casey who were despised for their depiction of West of Ireland people and the “Dublin working class”.\n\nThe production opens on 28th of October, and plays until the 2nd of November 2024\n\n“The novel while ground breaking in its day needed the new brush strokes that Scott and his energetic empathetic cast brought to the two and half hours of the story…”"
