        "text": "WICHITA FALLS, Texas (KAUZ) - An award-winning feature film based in Wichita Falls is headed to San Antonio this weekend to screen at one of the largest film festivals in Texas.\n\nBLOOD DRIED HANDS (2024) is a thriller movie that was filmed by WCSO Deputy Sheriff Jason Vandygriff, using sets and props provided by our very own Wichita County Sheriff’s Office. The feature film, which has screened internationally and won over 100 film festival awards, follows a series of murders carried out by a strange serial killer and investigated by a detective battling her own trauma.\n\nYou might recognize the cast of actors from films such as Killers of the Flower Moon, 1883, The Chosen, Fear the Walking Dead, and more. Leading actor Chance Gibbs is an MSU alumnus, while supporting actress Sydney Wisdom is a Wichita Falls native and long-time lead performer at the Wichita Theater.\n\nScenes were filmed in real jail cells and investigator’s offices at the Law Enforcement Center and retired Jail Annex of Wichita Falls. The cast even wore real uniforms and badges from the WCSO.\n\nThe film’s most recent screening took place in Electra at the Cowpokes International Film Festival, where it took home 9 awards including Best of Fest and Best Director. BLOOD DRIED HANDS has also screened internationally in Japan, China, England, France, Italy, Spain, Germany, Sweden, the United Arab Emirates, and more.\n\nThe upcoming San Antonio screening is a six-day affair which will feature over 200 movies in total. BLOOD DRIED HANDS will begin screening at 9:30 p.m. on August 3 at the Carlos Alvarez Theater, located in the Tobin Performing Arts Center on the Riverwalk. Interested persons who will be in the area can purchase tickets here."
