        "text": "12 spy films set in Germany\n\nFrom James Bond to Ethan Hunt, many cinematic secret agents spent time in Germany. Steven Spielberg's film \"Bridge of Spies\" is set in Berlin and was filmed there, too - but others just reproduced the city.\n\nImage: 2014 Twentieth Century Fox\n\nTom Hanks among spies in Berlin\n\nMany parts of Steven Spielberg's movie were shot in and around Berlin. It re-enacts the first of a series of spy swaps that took place on Glienicke Bridge, which became known as the \"Bridge of Spies,\" hence the title of the film. Spielberg isn't the first filmmaker to portray secret agents in Germany. Here are more examples.\n\nImage: 2014 Twentieth Century Fox\n\n'5 Fingers'\n\nThe film \"5 Fingers\" (1952), directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, is about a famous secret agent during World War II who worked for the Nazis - widely known by his code name, Cicero. Although other spy movies were filmed on location, this one was mainly shot in the studio.\n\nImage: picture-alliance/dpa/akg-Images\n\n'Spy for Germany'\n\nThis West German thriller, originally titled \"Spion für Deutschland\" (1956), also depicts the actions of a German secret agent during World War II. Starring Martin Held and Nadja Tiller, it was filmed both in Berlin and the US.\n\nImage: picture-alliance/dpa\n\n'The Dirty Game'\n\nWerner Klinger, who directed \"Spy for Germany,\" was also among the four filmmakers who helmed this 1965 anthology spy film. It is made up of stories directed by a German, a French, an Italian, and a British filmmaker. Shot in Berlin, it starred Henry Fonda and Robert Ryan.\n\nImage: picture-alliance/dpa/United Archives/IFTN\n\n'Torn Curtain'\n\nAlfred Hitchcock filmed his spy thriller \"Torn Curtain\" in the studio in 1966. However, some scenes were shot on location in Berlin. Camera crews filmed in the German capital and sent their footage to Hollywood so Hitchcock could use the material in his movie. The cast included German actors Wolfgang Kieling and Hansjörg Felmy, along with US stars Julie Andrews and Paul Newman.\n\nImage: picture-alliance/dpa/United Archives/IFTN\n\nJames Bond in Berlin: 'Octopussy'\n\nA large part of the 13th movie of the most popular secret agent in film history, James Bond, was shot in Berlin in 1983. Agent 007, depicted by Roger Moore, is seen at Checkpoint Charlie, in front of the Berlin Wall, and does a chase scene on the AVUS highway. Bond's love scenes were filmed in the studio, though.\n\nImage: picture-alliance/dpa/ KPA\n\n'The Innocent'\n\nIn 1993, John Schlesinger filmed on location in Berlin. \"The Innocent\" is based on the Cold War \"Operation Gold,\" where CIA and MI6 agents built a tunnel under the Russian sector of Berlin. Anthony Hopkins, Isabella Rossellini and Campbell Scott star in the film.\n\nImage: picture-alliance/dpa/United Archives/IFTN\n\n'Mission: Impossible III'\n\nFor the third film in the \"Mission: Impossible\" series, director J.J Abrams and star Tom Cruise initially planned to film in the German Reichstag. But the German government didn't allow them to shoot in the building - a council decided it should not be used in commercial films. The crew had to build sets in Babelsberg Studio, just outside Berlin.\n\nImage: picture-alliance/dpa\n\n'The Good German'\n\n\"The Good German\" (2006) by Steven Soderbergh also demonstrates how studio sets can replace actual locations. The story is set in post-war Berlin, but was filmed in Los Angeles. However, Soderbergh built in archive material of the actual war-torn city in his gloomy film shot in black-and-white.\n\nImage: picture-alliance/dpa\n\n'Spy Game'\n\nThis 2001 spy thriller starring Robert Redford and Brad Pitt is set in Berlin, but it wasn't shot in Germany either. Locations in Budapest were used to reproduce the German capital. This can actually be noticed in some scenes: Some elements in the background do not exist in Berlin.\n\nImage: picture-alliance/dpa\n\n'The Man from U.N.C.L.E.'\n\nCurrently in theaters, the secret agent comedy \"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\" contains many scenes set in Berlin in the 1960s. Henry Cavill depicts an American secret agent competing with a Russian spy. The film beautifully recreates the atmosphere of divided Berlin - yet everything was done by computer.\n\nImage: 2015 WARNER BROS. ENTERTAINMENT INC. AND RATPAC-DUNE ENTERTAINMENT LLC ALL RIGHTS RESERVED/Daniel Smith\n\n'Homeland'\n\nThe fifth season of the popular TV series \"Homeland\" was shot in Berlin, too. Agent Carrie Mathison is no longer working for the CIA and is hired by a German private security firm. Filming was also done in Babelsberg Studios and in Brandenburg.\n\nImage: picture alliance/landov/K. Smith\n\nOn location: Glienicke Bridge\n\nSteven Spielberg filmed his spy movie on location in Berlin. After all, the legendary and mysterious Glienicke Bridge also inspired the title of his film, \"Bridge of Spies.\" Sometimes the actual location simply beats all studio sets and digital reproductions.\n\nImage: imago/Camera4\n\n13 images\n\n1 | 1313 images\n\nJochen Kürten / eg10/15/2015October 15, 2015\n\nhttps://p.dw.com/p/1Gmnr\n\nAdvertisement"
