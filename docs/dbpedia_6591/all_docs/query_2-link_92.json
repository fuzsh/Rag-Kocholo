        "text": "Here are the greatest extraterrestrial visitations that have ever hit the big screen. Because not all encounters are created equal, we ranked them by CNET sister site Metacritic's Metascore. You're welcome.\n\nFor the record, yes, we know Superman and Thor are aliens. We're not including comic book movies in this roundup.\n\nMetacritic score: 59\n\nSo, why would an alien species that can't deal with water even stop for gas on Earth? Also, is the humidity in Pennsylvania not serious enough to dissolve these creatures? So many questions.\n\nMetacritic score: 62\n\nIn James Cameron's first journey to the bottom of the ocean, Ed Harris plays a submarine foreman who mans the USS Montana with his estranged wife... right into the path of the submerged alien ship surrounded by benevolent aquatic forces.\n\nMetacritic score: 63\n\nAbout 200 years have passed since the conclusion of Alien 3, and Sigourney Weaver still looks like she's never seen a Xenomorph in her life. That, of course, is because she's been cloned by military scientists. Clone-Ripley is thrust into a conflict to, once again, save Earth from an alien invasion.\n\nMetacritic score: 65\n\nSet in 2089, this is a prequel to the Alien franchise. It features a party of scientists who go on a deep space journey to uncover humanity's predecessors, the \"Engineers.\" What could possibly go wrong?\n\nMetacritic score: 67\n\nIf you've never seen this movie but the name Khan sounds familiar, it's probably because the character was reimagined for the 2013 film Into Darkness, but this 1982 film was the first time Khan did battle with Kirk and Spock.\n\nMetacritic score: 70\n\nThis cult classic takes on the intergalactic sci-fi genre in truly meta fashion. The cast of a once-popular science fiction show is caught up in a conflict between an alien race called the Thermians and an evil Ninja Turtle-esque space villain.\n\nMetacritic score: 71\n\nThe good guys dress in black, remember that? Black suits with black Ray-Bans on! Will Smith plays a New York City cop who is recruited for by a secret government agency to combat alien threats. Just one year earlier, Smith had saved the planet from hostile extraterrestrials in Independence Day.\n\nMetacritic score: 71\n\nTom Cruise plays a desk-bound military officer who receives his first combat assignment when aliens invade Earth. For better or worse, his character gets stuck in a time loop that allows him to die over and over again, while he learns the best way to defeat the aliens and save the world.\n\nMetacritic score: 71\n\nPicture it: you're a grieving widow living in Wisconsin. One night, a mysterious orb appears and takes on the form of your dead husband. This person who looks like your dead husband begins reciting a United Nations message inviting aliens to visit Earth. And the alien needs a ride.\n\nJeff Bridges was nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal of the humanoid Starman, who crash-landed in rural Wisconsin.\n\nMetacritic score: 72\n\nThis 2011 film is like the love child of Stranger Things and Cloverfield. If you love late '70s nostalgia, impressive kid-actor performances and the drama of an enormous alien pillaging 20th century electronics to rebuild its ship, this is the movie for you.\n\nMetacritic score: 76\n\nWithout giving away too much about this awesome arthouse flick, there's a boy, a dad and an extended chase that involves the FBI, the army and a healthy fear of sunlight. If you haven't seen it, cancel your plans and watch.\n\nMetacritic score: 81\n\nDistrict 9 isn't just another alien encounter movie. This one challenges viewers to question how welcoming they would be if aliens arrived on Earth in need of our help. Events in the film were inspired by the real-life District Six, a region in Cape Town where tens of thousands of non-white residents were forcibly removed from their homes in the 1970s after the neighborhood was declared a \"whites only\" area.\n\nMetacritic score: 82\n\nA family struggles to survive when Earth is overrun by blind aliens who hunt using sound. The temptation to hold your breath while watching this movie is real. Make sure to breathe. The aliens can't hear you.\n\nMetacritic score: 87\n\nSigourney Weaver has been floating in space in \"stasis\" for almost six decades when she is once again charged with saving everyone from the stomach-hitchhiking alien species.\n\nMetacritic score: 91\n\nFrom the iconic imagery of the Devils Tower to the five-note musical phrase used to communicate with the UFOs, this movie will stick with you long after you watch it."
