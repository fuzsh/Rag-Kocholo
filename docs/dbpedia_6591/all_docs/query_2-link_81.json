        "text": "New arts venue in Stevens Point\n\nIn the Pines Studio and Create Portage County will present an evening of sci-fi cinema at 7 p.m. Friday, Aug. 16.\n\nThe evening will begin with “The Shaver Mystery,” a short 2024 documentary by local filmmaker Dean Bertram, followed by “Metropolis,” the silent 1927 classic by Fritz Lang.\n\n“The Shaver Mystery” is a 14-minute film about Richard Shaver, a science fiction writer who lived in Amherst and claimed his stories, about an ancient, subterranean alien civilization and alien abductions, were true. Published in the 1940s in the pulp magazine “Amazing Stories,” Shaver’s work paved the way for modern UFO mythology. The film also focuses on Raymond Palmer, the editor who worked with Shaver.\n\n“We are excited to be able to share ‘The Shaver Mystery’ with our audience,” said Winter Williams, actress and founder of In The Pines Studio. “It’s a fascinating documentary about the strange claims and cultural significance of two local residents, who, unfortunately, have been all but forgotten.”\n\nA masterpiece of German Expressionism, “Metropolis” tells the story of a future city where the privileged elite live in elegant skyscrapers and the workers live in squalid conditions underground. The main characters are a woman who inspires hope in the downtrodden workers, a robot who is made to look like the woman and foments rebellion, and a young idealistic man who leaves the skyscrapers to join the workers.\n\nThe special effects in “Metropolis” are decades ahead of their time. Fritz Lang, the director, fled to the United States after the rise of Hitler. Thea von Harbou, the screenwriter, remained in Germany and made propaganda films for the Nazis.\n\nSnacks and drinks will be provided. A donation of $5 is suggested.\n\nSeating is limited, so go to bit.ly/3SC7kTM to make reservations.\n\nIn the Pines Studio is located at 6746 Lone Pine St., in Stevens Point."
