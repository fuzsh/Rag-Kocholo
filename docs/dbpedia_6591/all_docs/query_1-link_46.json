Reilly. The plot centers around a family with marital troubles embarking on a whitewater rafting adventure that is intercepted by two criminals on the run from the law. In the opening The River Wild scene (spoiler alert!), we are introduced to Gail and Tom Hartman (Meryl Streep and David Strathairn), a married couple that hails from Boston. Gail, an experienced river guide, plans a rafting trip in Idaho, taking along their son Roarke and their dog Maggie. At the last minute, Tom decides to surprise Gail, Roarke, and Maggie by showing up in Idaho prepared to join them on their rafting trip. As the family begins their journey, they are joined by three other rafters named Wade (Kevin Bacon), Terry (John C. Reilly), and Frank (William Lucking.) During a break, the Hartmans meet the other rafters again and take note that Frank is not with Wade and Terry any longer. The other rafters share that an argument took place, and Frank decided to leave. Since Frank was the tour guide for the trio, Gail tells them she will assist them with finding their way to the end of the river. Following a full day on the river, the group stops to prepare a camp for the evening. Wade is acting unusually, and Gail and Tom become suspicious of him. The couple decides that they should separate from Wade and Terry and continue on their own. Their plans are changed when Wade and Terry ask Roarke to join them and head off ahead of the others with Roarke on board. Wade shows Roarke that he has a gun with him. When the group stops for a rest, Gail and Tom try to get Roarke onto their own raft and to head out ahead of Wade and Terry. Wade notices their efforts and points the gun at Tom. Tom and Wade struggle and Wade attempts to shoot Maggie. Wade and Terry insist the Hartmans take them down the river by keeping them at gunpoint. That night, Tom attempts to get the gun from Terry. He takes off into the river, and Wade runs after him to try to catch him. Tom gets away. Upon returning to camp, Wade informs Gail and Roarke that Tom died. Tom locates Maggie and runs along the canyonâs edge to try to get in front of the course of the raft. After a rough ride through the rapids, Gail, Roarke, Wade, and Terry pass safely through the Gauntlet. Tom surprises the group and upends the raft. Tom begins to wrestle with Terry as Gail successfully gains access to the gun. Gail shoots Wade, killing him.\n\nThe River Wild Locations\n\nThere are several main filming locations for The River Wild that are seen throughout this beloved action-adventure film.

Set against the beautiful backdrop of the soaring orchestration of âThe Water is Wide,â Gail continues her morning row with the stunning scenery of Boston surrounding her. As she nears the cityâs center, the music becomes more frenetic, her rowing more intense, and the sounds of rush hour traffic intensifies. She finishes her rowing, ready to begin her day. Though this scene contains no dialogue, the music that flows in tandem with Gailâs every paddle stroke communicates two things to the audience: the peace and serenity of the before and the coming troubles of the after. This scene segues to a new The River Wild location, the familyâs home in Boston where Gail is frustrated with Rourkeâs lackadaisical approach to getting ready for school. The scene opens with Gail talking to Rourke: Gail: Roarke! Roarke! I'm tellin' you for the 157th time, turn that d**ned music off! It's singeing my hair!

Wade speaks with a tense jocularity when Gail assumes the lead position and instructs the duo as to what they need to do. Unaware of the trouble yet to come, Gail sets out in front of Wade and Terry. Instead of heeding Gailâs instructions, Wade insists on steering the raft to the left into dangerous rapids. The raft capsizes, and both men are thrown into the water. Terry is returned to Gailâs boat, and the group frantically tries to find Wade who Terry says cannot swim. Tom removes his life jacket and plunges into the water in search of him. He finds him, and Wade grabs onto him, and the two begin to struggle. It is intimated that Wade is attempting to cause Tom to drown. In order to bring both of them to the surface, Tom punches Wade, knocking him out. He then is able to get a hold of Wade and swim to the raft, saving Wadeâs life. When Wade is pulled onto the raft, he flops to the ground on his back. Roarke says to him, âWow! You almost drowned!â To which Wade responds with equal parts of sarcasm and menace, âWELLLL! One of these days, I have GOT to learn how to swim.â The filming location for this The River Wild scene takes place just outside the town of Libby in an undisclosed section of the Kootenai River in Montana.

Roarke tells the dog to run, and Maddy runs into the woods, narrowly escaping a bullet fired by Wade. Wade goes over to a weeping Roarke and tells him he is disappointed that he told his parents about the gun as he considered Roarke a friend.

Wade begins to beg, and Gail, feeling pity for him, pulls the trigger with the gun pointed in the air only to discover the gun did not fire. Wade, thinking Gail has nothing to defend her family with, tries to kill the Hartmans. This exchange takes place between the two: Wade: I'm in charge now. I could bury you and Roarke tonight. I could do anything I want with you. Gail: Then go ahead. Don't keep telling me how tough you are, Wade, just show me. Following this speech, Gail notices she did not turn the revolver before firing the first time, turns it, and shoots Wade dead. As with many of the river scenes in this popular film, the finale of this movie is shot at Middle Fork, Flathead River."
