        "text": "ANNOUNCER: Cameron County is the birthplace of silent film cowboy Tom Mix.\n\nIt is also well known as what?\n\nThe rarest and most valuable baseball card in history is of what Pennsylvania-born ballplayer?\n\nFind out as we all play The Pennsylvania Game.\n\n[music playing, applause] The Pennsylvania Game is made possible in part by Uni-Marts, Incorporated, with stores in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia.\n\nServing you with courtesy and convenience every day of the year.\n\nUni-Marts, more than a convenience store.\n\nNow, let's get the game started.\n\nHere's the host of The Pennsylvania Game, the woman who says there's no such thing as a stupid question, only stupid answers, Lynn Cullen.\n\nThank you, thank you.\n\n[applause] You notice I'm starting to be tentative about those steps?\n\nYou see, there's bound to be a time where I come tumbling down.\n\nI made it one more time.\n\nThank you, thank you, thank you.\n\nExcuse me.\n\nSomething's pulling on my earring.\n\nWelcome to The Pennsylvania Game, where spontaneous things are happening all the time.\n\nSo don't take your eyes off that television set.\n\nYou never know what's going to happen.\n\nLet's meet our panel.\n\nOh no, not him again.\n\n[laughter] The-- yes, the irrepressible Brian Allen, back to, well, I guess-- Lose again.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Yeah, back to lose another game.\n\nThe host of Penn State Hoops, color commentator for Penn State basketball, Brian Allen.\n\n[cheering, applause] Oh man, the girls love him.\n\nShe has worked as a professional editor, writer for the past 20 years, currently working on a book that says you can be a failure at dog training and still love your pet.\n\nShe's also a returning panelist.\n\nWelcome Bonny Farmer.\n\n[applause] And now, the new kid on the block, never been here before.\n\nLee Grenci is an instructor of meteorology at Penn State, a member of the weather communications group, which creates the daily weather page for the New York Times, and an on-air meteorologist for Weather World on WPSX.\n\nWeather, weather, weather.\n\nLet's see whether you guys can play the game.\n\nFirst question, please.\n\nANNOUNCER: Remote Cameron County in northcentral Pennsylvania, where the bear and the elk still roam, is well known as the birthplace of silent film cowboy Tom Mix.\n\nIt is also known as, A, God's country, B, the land of milk and honey, C, fisherman's paradise, or D, the divorce capital of Pennsylvania?\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Excuse me.\n\nHow did that get in there?\n\nGod's country, the land of milk and honey, fisherman's paradise, or the divorce capital of Pennsylvania Cameron County?\n\nDo we-- well, most of us don't know anything, do we, Brian?\n\n[laughter] Exactly, right.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Yeah, that's what I thought.\n\nI was-- I was fighting either B or D, and I thought the divorce capital of Pennsylvania sounded a little bit better than the land of milk and honey.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: You know, I know you.\n\nSo I knew you were going to pick D. You should have asked me.\n\nBRIAN: 'Cause we're here, Lynn.\n\nI know.\n\nBRIAN: We're here.\n\nI know, I know.\n\nIt's frightening to me.\n\nBonny, what did you pick?\n\nI chose, A. Cowboys, white hats-- what else could it be?\n\nLYNN CULLEN: God's country.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Lee, your first question, your first answer.\n\nBRIAN: Pressure.\n\nThe pressure is on.\n\nPressure.\n\nActually, I've driven through Cameron County, and it really is God's country.\n\nOK, well, there you have it.\n\nAnd as usual, Brian, you're out on a limb all there by yourself in the lonesome.\n\nMight be the place to be.\n\nLet's find out.\n\nANNOUNCER: The answer is D, the state's divorce capital.\n\n40 marriages are dissolved for every one that's united in this rural Pennsylvania county of 5,900 people.\n\nLawyers from Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and elsewhere throughout the state discovered in 1982 that they could save time and money by filing their no fault divorce papers in Cameron.\n\nThe county charges just $39 to process a new divorce, a fraction of what other areas charge.\n\nCameron's cottage industry has been controversial, especially among its clergy, but it's also been a bonanza.\n\nLast year alone, the divorce by mail capital processed 6,000 divorces and netted more than $250,000.\n\n6,000 divorces.\n\nI bet there aren't even 6,000 people in Cameron County.\n\nSo they have figured out a little niche for themselves.\n\nStrange, didn't know that.\n\nNow you do.\n\nCancel my tickets to Reno.\n\nI won't be using them.\n\nThere's some place closer.\n\nBy the way, Pennsylvania's divorce rate is among the lowest in the nation.\n\nThere you have it.\n\nCongratulations to all of you still together.\n\nI'm sort of coming apart myself.\n\nLet's do another question, please.\n\nANNOUNCER: The most valuable and rarest baseball card in history is a cigarette card of a Pennsylvania-born ballplayer known by many as The Greatest Shortstop in Baseball History.\n\nIs the baseball card of, A, Stan Musial, B, Honus Wagner, C, Connie Mack, or D, Roberto Clemente?\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Well, if you're a baseball fan, chances are you're going to be able to figure this one out.\n\nIs it Stan Musial, Honus Wagner, Connie Mack, or the great Roberto Clemente?\n\nBonny.\n\nYes, we're going to start with me.\n\nI chose B because it just sounded like an old enough name to be on a cigarette card.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: OK, that's smart.\n\nSee, you're using your noggin.\n\nYou got to pick up on every little clue.\n\nThat's smart.\n\nLee.\n\nStan Musial was a first baseman.\n\nRoberto Clemente was a right fielder.\n\nBut I don't know about B and C. Connie Mack had a stadium built after him, so I chose B. OK, you went with C. Well, there your baseball wisdom paid off for you.\n\nYou know, I know you know basketball and you know baseball.\n\nOf course I know baseball.\n\nHa!\n\nOf course.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: So what's the answer here?\n\nI'm going with Honus Wagner.\n\nWayne Gretzky owns it, I think.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Wayne Gretzky owns the card?\n\nYes.\n\nDo you think?\n\nBRIAN: I'd play half a million for it.\n\nDon't believe a thing he says.\n\nI don't-- let's find out.\n\nBRIAN: I'm feeling like a brainiac now.\n\n[laughter] ANNOUNCER: The answer is B, Honus Wagner of the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\nWagner, who was religious and non smoking, was upset at the use of his image on a cigarette card.\n\nIn 1909, his lawyers forced the tobacco company that issued the card to cease production, but not until 20 cards had already been circulated.\n\nToday, one of those Honus Wagner baseball cards is worth more than $200,000.\n\nWow, a statue of him outside Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh.\n\nLet's get to meet these people a little bit more.\n\nAs if I need to know you more than I do, Brian.\n\nBrian, what's this I hear about you meeting with Montel Williams?\n\nTell us about this.\n\nOh yeah, I have a friend that's one of his producers.\n\nAnd I went to the show.\n\nAnd he came out and he started talking.\n\nAnd he started talking about scuba diving.\n\nAnd I told him I scuba dived, or dove, or have has or had dove-- I don't know the correct tense.\n\nBut we kind of hit it off.\n\nAnd he asked me if I had a girlfriend, and I said no.\n\nAnd he felt sorry for me.\n\nSo he said he's going to have me on the show as a eligible bachelor.\n\nYou're kidding.\n\nHey, the pity thing works, the pity thing works.\n\n[laughter] Lonely guy.\n\nSo he'll get you a date, finally.\n\nYeah.\n\nMontel Williams.\n\nWe have to go national in television, but we'll do it.\n\nBRIAN: You gotta take it to the top.\n\nIt's like a telethon just for you.\n\nBRIAN: That's right.\n\nOK. Bonny, what is this?\n\nYou could be a failure at dog training and still love your dog.\n\nWill your dog love you?\n\nThat's a good question.\n\nI mostly am designing it for people kind of like me.\n\nYou know, the sort of person who goes home, sees trash all over the kitchen, dog wedged into the garbage cans, spaghetti sauce from its ears.\n\nDog looks at you and says, I didn't do it.\n\nIt was the cat.\n\nAnd you believe the dog, even though you don't have a cat.\n\n[laughter] So-- I know people like you.\n\nI usually avoid their homes, too.\n\nThanks for being here today.\n\nBONNY: Any time.\n\nHey, Lee, you've written a book too-- World of Weather, Fundamentals of Meteorology.\n\nSounds like a real snoozer to me.\n\n[laughter] Just kidding.\n\nWhat is this, Rocky Balboa made his way into the book?\n\nThere's a ring of truth to that, yes.\n\nBRIAN: Ooh!\n\nLYNN CULLEN: You remember that, right?\n\nRocky Balboa is into meteorology?\n\nYeah.\n\nTo explain how precipitation forms in the atmosphere, you need to establish that water can exist at the same time as a gas, liquid, and solid.\n\nAnd in that famous meat scene where he's pounding the beef, you can see his breath that's liquid.\n\nHis breath evaporates, so you know there's water vapor.\n\nAnd they're in a freezer, so there's got to be some ice there.\n\nSo I worked that in into rain, believe it or not.\n\nWow.\n\n[laughter] Wow.\n\nI don't know about you, but I'm getting out of here right now.\n\nFrom meteorology to geography.\n\nWe're supposed to all be geography nitwits in this country.\n\nLet's find out if you're representative.\n\nThe panel, that is.\n\nANNOUNCER: At 283 miles long, 160 miles wide, Pennsylvania ranks 33rd in size among the states.\n\nHow many states share a border with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania?\n\nA, four, B, five, C, six, or D, seven?\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Think about it.\n\nGet that map in your head.\n\nHow many states share a border with us?\n\nWe really are supposed to be geographically challenged.\n\nI once had a producer who said, how do you get the international operator?\n\nAnd I said, well, what do you need the international operator for?\n\nAnd she said, I have to call New Mexico.\n\n[awkward silence] Anyway, you don't understand that.\n\nNew Mexico is in the United States.\n\nLee, Lee.\n\nWell, to show you how my day is going, I wanted to say five, which is B, but I just press C. LYNN CULLEN: Ooh, poor Lee.\n\nWell, I'm sorry, it's C. Do I get partial credit?\n\nLYNN CULLEN: No mercy.\n\nYou have a C, it is C. That's it.\n\nLEE: I meant B. I'm tough around here.\n\nYou meant B, but he said C. What did you mean?\n\nWell, I went with D, seven.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Seven.\n\nYes.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Uh-huh.\n\nUh.\n\nWell, never mind.\n\nJust be quiet.\n\n[laughter] Really, just forget it.\n\nBonny?\n\nI did a quick count of my fingers and toes and came up with C, six.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Six?\n\nSo you actually visualized it?\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nUh-huh.\n\nWell, see, she had six, Lee, and she meant to say six.\n\nOnly that I meant to say it.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Six might be right.\n\nOr-- LYNN CULLEN: Maybe.\n\nMaybe.\n\nANNOUNCER: The answer is six.\n\nOhio, West Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, and New York.\n\nOnly the Delaware River on the east at about 40 miles of Lake Erie in the northwest corner form natural boundaries.\n\nOther state boundaries were established in the charter granted to William Penn by King Charles II of England, although it was 1787 before land and Border disputes were settled and Pennsylvania took clear title to its land.\n\nThe most famous border dispute was with the State of Maryland.\n\nThat dispute was ultimately settled when the English Crown accepted the Mason-Dixon line in 1769, a border which, in subsequent years, became the symbolic demarcation in the United States between North and South.\n\nThere you have it.\n\nLittle known that Mason-Dixon, it was named after Jackie Mason and Jean Dixon, I believe.\n\n[laughter] Didn't know that.\n\nAll right, let's get the score.\n\nIt's time now to check out how these guys are doing.\n\nAnd you know what?\n\nThey're not doing badly at all.\n\nYou really aren't.\n\nIt's a tie game.\n\nYou all have 2, which is OK.\n\nI think we've only asked three questions.\n\nThat's very good.\n\nTechnically, I only have 1.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Yeah.\n\nTechnically, you only have one, but we're giving it to you.\n\n2, 2, and 2.\n\nAll right.\n\nI need the help, not Lee.\n\n[applause] LYNN CULLEN: All right.\n\nHere's where we separate the men from the boys, the girls from the women.\n\nThe Mystery Pennsylvanian.\n\nGet it on this clue, the first clue, you get three points at the end of the game.\n\nGet it on the second clue, two points.\n\nThe last clue, one point only.\n\nHe was raised in Altoona, Pennsylvania, the product of a family he describes as being neither musical nor athletic.\n\nSee, that's a little clue there, being neither musical nor athletic.\n\nYou see that little light bulb just went off in Brian's head.\n\nIt doesn't happen often, but-- [laughter] OK, you think about that, OK?\n\nIf you get it right this time, scribble it down there on line 1, and you will get three points at the end of the game.\n\nBut meanwhile, we must continue.\n\nAnd here's a doozy just for you.\n\nANNOUNCER: Pennsylvania lawmakers continually add new laws to our already thick law books.\n\nHowever, little attention is paid to repealing old laws.\n\nAll but one of the following were laws in Pennsylvania until 1992.\n\nDo you know which one was not?\n\nWas it, A, a person may not sleep in a refrigerator in Pittsburgh, or B, it's illegal to carry a skeleton into a tenement house in Erie, or C, no one may throw dead animals into the Schuylkill River between Fiar Rock and Fairmont Dam, or D, no one may boil bones or store dead animals in the 1st or 26th Ward in Philadelphia?\n\nWow.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Yeah, wow is right.\n\nMan, they were boiling bones like mad in the 3rd Ward, I know that, and it was perfectly OK. How can this be true?\n\nThree of those four are, in fact-- were, in fact-- let's get the tense right-- laws in Pennsylvania.\n\nOnly one of those is a pretender.\n\nI'm not even going to attempt to go through those again.\n\nBut one had to do about sleeping in refrigerators.\n\nThere was something about dead animals, carrying skeletons, and bones in wards in Philadelphia.\n\nWeird, huh?\n\n[mumbles] LYNN CULLEN: Hey, Brian.\n\nOh, you're going to put it on me first?\n\nWell, I am.\n\nWhich one-- which one of those-- Well, I know I've been cited for sleeping in a refrigerator in Pittsburgh before, so that can't be it.\n\nSo I just decided that, C, throwing dead animals.\n\nNow, you can throw it in the Allegheny, but the Schuylkill River, yeah, that had never come up before.\n\nNo, absolutely.\n\nApparently not.\n\nYeah, C. He doesn't know a thing.\n\nBonny, what do you think?\n\nThey've let me sleep in lots of refrigerators, so I said A. LYNN CULLEN: You did say A?\n\nI said A. LYNN CULLEN: Very dangerous to sleep in refrigerators, Bonny.\n\nDo you sleep in the crisper or do you favor-- I just like the wire racks.\n\nIt gives you a lot of support.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: OK, just asking.\n\nBecause I have, you know, my what I like to do in refrigerators myself, but we won't get into that.\n\nBRIAN: We'll talk after the show.\n\nYes, Lee.\n\nI have a lot of skeletons in my closet and I make no bones about it, D. LYNN CULLEN: Argh.\n\n[audience booing] BRIAN: I like that one, I like that one.\n\nThat was good.\n\nAll right, so what?\n\nSo you didn't go with the one about skeletons.\n\nYou went with-- Well, the boil bones.\n\nI mean-- LYNN CULLEN: Oh, boil bones.\n\nBoil bones.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: You went with D. Boil bones.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: OK, so we have a C, A, and a D. We have a CAD.\n\nBrian, look that up.\n\nAh.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: I know.\n\nLet's get the correct answer.\n\nANNOUNCER: The answer is B.\n\nIt is illegal to carry a skeleton into a tenement house, but only in New York City.\n\nThe others are just a few of the outdated and unusual laws that were on the books in Pennsylvania until former State Representative Sam Hayes Jr. devised a plan called Operation Repeal, which eliminated all laws that cluttered up the state's law books.\n\nMany of these laws were passed as health and safety efforts in the 17 and 1800s.\n\nIn 1992, Act 108 repealed nearly 50 laws in Pennsylvania that were either useless or required payments in shillings and pounds.\n\nYeah.\n\nWell, listen to this, the penalty for cursing in Pennsylvania is a $0.40 fine.\n\nAnd if you mention God while you're cursing, the fine is $0.67.\n\nNow, what occurs to me is why don't they enforce that?\n\nIf that is-- I mean, the state treasury would be burgeoning.\n\nWhy don't they enforce that, damn it?\n\nAnd then they could-- ANNOUNCER: [indistinct] Oh, sorry.\n\nWell, it's $0.40.\n\nIt was just $0.40.\n\nIt's $0.40 for me right there, see?\n\nWouldn't that be smart?\n\nBRIAN: I'd be in debtor's prison.\n\nI know you would.\n\nSo I want to thank Violet Weber of Lancaster for sending us that wonderful, wonderful question.\n\nHow's about another?\n\nWhy not?\n\nWhat else are we going do?\n\nBONNY: As long as we're here.\n\nANNOUNCER: On September 23, 1938, former state Senator Fred Bailey, a native of Wellsboro, Pennsylvania, unveiled a bronze statue on the green in Wellsboro in loving memory of his late wife Elizabeth.\n\nWas the statue of, a, Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love, B, General Ulysses S. Grant, C, the family dog, a Great Dane, Or D, Wynken, Blynken, and Nod?\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Excuse me?\n\n[laughter] What-- how do we get-- Aphrodite, General Grant, the family dog, or Wynken, Blynken, and Nod?\n\nGood.\n\nWho comes up with these things?\n\nThis is a good question.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: OK, Bonny, you have it.\n\nCome on.\n\nGet that quizzical, pained look off your face.\n\nI'm sure this is the right answer.\n\nI said D, because in my heart, I know she was a good mother.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: OK, that's it.\n\nWynken, Blynken, and Nod.\n\nLee.\n\nWhen you mention a dog, you get right to my heart, so I chose C. LYNN CULLEN: OK, you went with the Great Dane.\n\nAnd you, sir.\n\nBeing that I have problems getting dates, I stayed away from the Aphrodite.\n\nI went with Wynken, Blynken, and Nod, which probably described their life in the bedroom.\n\n[laughter] [bell rings] LYNN CULLEN: Excuse me?\n\nCan we just go to the answer, please, now?\n\nANNOUNCER: The answer is D, Wynken, Blynken, and Nod.\n\nWynken, Blynken, and Nod, written by Eugene field, is considered by many to be the most perfect poem ever written.\n\nTo commemorate his wife's love of the poem, Fred Bailey, a former state senator from Colorado, gave the statue sculpted by Mabel Torrey as a gift, especially with children in mind.\n\nBy 1989, the statue was in desperate need of cleaning, so a committee was formed to restore and preserve the statue.\n\nIn the spring of 1990, work was completed and the statue was restored to its original beauty.\n\nAw.\n\nIt's enough to bring tears to your eyes, so is our score.\n\n[chuckles] No, no, no, no, no.\n\nActually, Brian, this may come as a shock to you, but you're in first place-- tied with Bonny.\n\nBonny and Brian both have three correct answers at this juncture.\n\n[cheering, applause] Lee has 2.\n\nAnd here's an opportunity to get some more, our second clue for the Mystery Pennsylvanian.\n\nThis former Penn State defensive tackle received All-Pro honors with the Cincinnati Bengals, the Bengals-- or the Bungles, as we like to call them in Pittsburgh.\n\nOK, raised in Altoona, Pa, product of a family he described as being neither musical nor athletic.\n\nHe's a former Penn State defensive tackle, All-Pro Cincinnati Bengal.\n\nBonny's tearing her hair out.\n\nBrian is feeling like a champion.\n\nAnd we are going to move on to the next question.\n\nANNOUNCER: Pithole in northwest Pennsylvania was once a city of 15,000 people.\n\nToday, it is one of the state's many ghost towns.\n\nFor what resource is Pithole City known?\n\nIs it, A, lumber, B, oil, C, limestone, or D, anthracite coal?\n\nLYNN CULLEN: L-u-m-b-e-r, lumber, oil, limestone, or anthracite coal?\n\nIt's one of those.\n\nThe lovely town of Pithole.\n\nNice name for a town, huh?\n\nHi, how are you?\n\nI'm from Pithole.\n\n[laughter] Gee.\n\nWell, I'm from Pittsburgh, so I guess not much better.\n\nWho are we going to first?\n\nLee.\n\nWell, I guess I can dig C. LYNN CULLEN: [forced laugh] [laughter] [booing] Humor him.\n\nCome on, shh.\n\nLimestone.\n\nThat's very good.\n\nThat's fine, that's fine, that's fine.\n\nBrian, no puns.\n\nJust give me an answer.\n\nWell, I mean, Pithole City, I expected to have, you know, places where Brian Allen lives as a choice, but I'm going to go with anthracite coal.\n\nOK.\n\nYes.\n\nOK, we've got limestone.\n\nWe have anthracite coal.\n\nAnd we have Bonny Farmer.\n\nBasically, he's just cheating and listening to my answers in advance, because I said anthracite also.\n\nYou had anthracite coal, too?\n\nYeah.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Well, hate to break this to you, but guess what?\n\nThey're all wrong.\n\nAbsolutely wrong.\n\nANNOUNCER: The answer is B, oil.\n\nOn January 7, 1865, the first oil well in Pithole City at Holden Farm came in at 650 barrels a day.\n\nMen looking for a quick fortune flocked to Pithole.\n\nAnd by September of 1865, the population of this oil community had risen to 15,000.\n\nSuburbs such as Balltown, Prather City, and Plummer sprang up on the ridges that surrounded the city to accommodate the people who could not find a place to live in one of Pithole's 60 hotels.\n\nBut in barely a year, oil production fell and continued to drop steadily.\n\nFortune seekers and professionals moved away.\n\nIn all, the town went from boom to bust in only 500 days.\n\nToday, only cellar holes, streets, and abandoned wells can be found at the site of one of the nation's greatest boom towns.\n\nPathetic, boom to bust in 500 days.\n\nListen to this, one of the hotels caught on fire in 1866.\n\nAnd they came, and they got water from nearby pumps, And they're pumping away.\n\nAnd you know what came out of the pumps?\n\nAUDIENCE: Oil.\n\nOil, yeah.\n\nNot a good idea.\n\nOh well.\n\nAnyway, out of the fire and into the dead of winter with our next question.\n\nJE Morgan Knitting Mills of Schuylkill County provided the 1994 US Olympic luge team with an important part of their gear.\n\nIn fact, JE Morgan is the world's leading producer of this product.\n\nIs it, A, long underwear, B, insulated gloves, C, woolen hats, or D, double-layered knit socks?\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Well, it's the knitting mills.\n\nWhat do they make?\n\nLong underwear, insulated gloves, woolen hats, or double-layered knit socks?\n\nAll of which that luge team I'm sure has wanted at one point or another.\n\nBrian, which one did you pick?\n\nI went with A, long underwear, because, you know, it's cold out there.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Well, if you're sliding around on ice, I would imagine so.\n\nYeah, sure.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Bonny.\n\nI thought my feet would get the coldest, so I said D, double-layered socks.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: OK. And what part of your body freezes first, Lee?\n\n[laughter] Sorry, sorry.\n\nNo, I'm not sure, I'm not sure.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Excuse me.\n\nI think-- I think I like the idea that A really \"sleighed\" me.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: OK. BRIAN: Oh!\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Oh no!\n\nBRIAN: He's rolling.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: All right, he's out here.\n\nHe's out of here.\n\nI think you got it, Bonny.\n\nAll right.\n\nWe got two long underwears and a something else-- and I don't know.\n\nAnd let's get the answer.\n\nANNOUNCER: The answer is A, long underwear.\n\nThe JE Morgan Knitting Mills were founded in 1945 in Tamaqua by John Morgan.\n\nJE Morgan is the largest manufacturer of thermal underwear in the United States, and with 1,400 workers, is the largest employer in Schuylkill County.\n\nThe company supplied the 1994 Olympic luge team with three sets of two ply stretch thermal underwear for each of the 45 members of the US team which competed in chilly Lillehammer, Norway.\n\nLast chance.\n\nLast call.\n\nMystery Pennsylvanian.\n\nFinal clue.\n\nWell known in country music circles, he received ASCAP's Song of the Year Award in 1986 for Lost in the Fifties.\n\nHe was an interesting character.\n\nHe's winning Song of the Year awards in '86, and he's also an All-Pro with the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nWas raised in Altoona.\n\nHe says family was neither musical nor athletic.\n\nWho is this musical star football player?\n\nI'm going first to you, Bonny, so finish up that last letter there.\n\nI'm writing as fast as I can.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: All right.\n\nWhat do you have?\n\nI didn't know.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: What do you mean, you don't know?\n\nYou just wrote it.\n\nI wrote like crazy.\n\nI have to go.\n\nNow let's see.\n\nLet me get it.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: We have Richard Rodgers.\n\nWe have Big Bear Johnson.\n\nAnd we have Tony, the Good Old Boy Singing Tiger.\n\n[laughter] It might be right, it might be.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: We'll give you a point for creativity.\n\nThat's right.\n\nLet's hear it for Bonny.\n\nOh god.\n\nHe's obviously lost the game.\n\n[laughter] Lee, what do you have?\n\nOh, I feel guilty about this one.\n\nI went to school with Mike Reid.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: So you're sure of yourself, are you?\n\nBRIAN: Cheater, cheater.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Mike Reid, Mike Reid, Mike Reid-- 1, 2, 3.\n\nIf you get it on the first one, that's three points for this upstart.\n\nWhat about you, Brian?\n\nWell, the first person that I knew from Altoona was my old teammate, Mike Juzzolino.\n\nBut he didn't play football.\n\nHe played basketball.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: And then you got Reid on the second.\n\nWell, the second clue was, you know, it's a dead giveaway.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Now what does that do?\n\nI think-- well, I don't know.\n\nWait a minute.\n\nIs it Mike Reid?\n\nYou guys are awfully sure of yourselves.\n\nI don't want to date myself, but Lee was my professor in college.\n\nAnd this would be such a thrill if I could beat him.\n\nOK, well, let's see.\n\nIt'll be a thrill, for Brian.\n\nMike Reid?\n\nANNOUNCER: Mike Reid grew up in Altoona, Pennsylvania.\n\nAt age six, he began taking piano lessons.\n\nAnd by age 12, he had invested in a $1,500 organ.\n\nBut by the time he paid it off, football had him in its clutches.\n\nIn college, Reid co-captained, the undefeated 1969 Penn State Nittany Lions.\n\nAnd although he was one of the smallest defensive tackles in the game, he was the Cincinnati Bengals' number one draft choice.\n\nBut after five seasons with the team, he had had his fill.\n\nHe announced his retirement from football at age 27.\n\nMusic once again became his focal point.\n\nHe began doing gigs around Cincinnati and even performed for a while with the Cincinnati Symphony.\n\nBut his true interest was in songwriting.\n\nIn 1981, he signed on with

don't you?\n\nBONNY: Wasn't me.\n\nNo?\n\nWe have a tie, ladies and gentlemen.\n\nA tie with-- AUDIENCE: Arm wrestle.\n\n--with the two-- Arm wrestle?\n\nWe're gonna arm-wrestle?\n\n[laughter] We've got both Brian and Lee.\n\nAnd I'm not sure what we're going to do here with our little goodie bag, because, you know, we do have a prize for the winner.\n\nWe're going to give them each one, or we're going to make them fight over it?\n\nAw.\n\n[applause] All right, hre are the prizes.\n\nAnd we want to thank Janet Johnson, the owner of JJ's Basket Delights in Mechanicsburg.\n\nA basket full of
