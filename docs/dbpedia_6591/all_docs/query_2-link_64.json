Django Unchained is a 2012 American western film directed by Quentin Tarantino and starring Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Kerry Washington. Set in the antebellum era of the Deep South, this film chronicles the journey of a liberated slave as he embarks on a dangerous mission to save his beloved wife from the clutches of a ruthless plantation owner. The film revolves around Django (Jamie Foxx), a freed slave who teams up with Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), a bounty hunter from Germany. Together, they embark on a mission to capture the notorious Brittle brothers. Along their journey, they encounter Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his aide Billy Crash (Walton Goggins) at Candie's plantation, Candyland, and attempt to free Django's wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). The movie garnered praise from critics, particularly for the outstanding performance of Waltz and Tarantino's exceptional direction and scriptwriting. However, it sparked controversy due to its extensive usage of racial slurs and vividly violent scenes. It was acknowledged with several awards and nominations, triumphing in two categories of five at the 85th Academy Awards. Waltz's remarkable acting earned him numerous accolades, including Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards, Golden Globes, and BAFTAs.\n\nDjango Unchained Locations\n\nThe 2012 classic film Django Unchained, starring Jamie Foxx and Leonardo DiCaprio, was produced with the help of various iconic locations across the United States. Most of the film was shot in California, Louisiana, and Wyoming. For Django Unchained, the crew utilized a variety of iconic locations that created the perfect backdrop for the movie. Scenes for the film were captured at several distinct locations in California, including the iconic Melody Ranch Motion Picture Studio in Newhall, the expansive Upper Las Virgenes Canyon Open Space Preserve, Ahmanson Ranch, and Evergreen Plantation. Each location brought something unique: the Melody Ranch Motion Picture Studio was designed as a western town replica, and Ahmanson Ranch offered vast ranch landscapes. At the same time, Evergreen Plantation provided the backdrop of a sugarcane field. In Louisiana, the forested region of Independence, located near I-395, was utilized for filming purposes. Finally, the crew also utilized the landscape of Wyoming for some of the filming. Visiting all the locations for Django Unchained would be a worthwhile experience. From the western town of Melody Ranch to the sugarcane fields of Evergreen Plantation to the forested region of Independence, each location brings a unique charm and atmosphere to the film. The trip would be enriching for anyone keen on learning more about the production of the 2012 classic.\n\nThe film opens in 1858 with a scene that sets the tone for the rest of the movie. Django (Jamie Foxx), a slave, is chained to other slaves and marched toward his new owner's estate in Texas by the Speck brothers. These scenes were filmed in the Alabama Hills at Lone Pine in Central California, known for their breathtaking rock formations. The Alabama Hills, located east of Sierra Nevada, is a public protected habitat popular with filmmakers for its unique and photogenic landscapes. To get to this location, one should head to the small town of Lone Pine on I-395, between Ridgecrest and Bishop. Take the Whitney Portal Road heading west from Main Street in Lone Pine. Upon reaching Movie Road, you'll know you've arrived at the right area. With its distinctive rocky wilderness, this location played a significant role in creating the authentic, raw backdrop for these key scenes in Django Unchained.\n\nCalifornia Filming Locations Tour\n\nAt nightfall, a German man in a dentist cart named Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) hails the Speck brothers. He tells them he is looking for a slave to identify a band of wanted fugitives known as the Brittle brothers. Django (Jamie Foxx) announces that he knows the Brittle brothers and can identify them. The first meeting of Django and Dr. Schultz was filmed in the woods of Independence, located on I-395 about 15 miles north of Lone Pine. Independence is the county seat of Inyo County, California. The magnificent Inyo County Courthouse, built in 1927, sits grandly in the center of town and is one of a select group of county courthouses listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Independence offers plenty of trails and a Greek campground, making it an ideal destination for fans of Django Unchained to visit and enjoy the atmosphere of the movie's opening scene. To get to Independence from Las Vegas, take US-95 N towards Reno. Then, merge onto I-15 S towards Los Angeles and continue onto CA-58 W until you reach US-395 N. Independence can be accessed via the Independence off-ramp. Public transportation is also an option; however, traveling by private car offers the fastest way to reach your destination.\n\nCheck California Video Shoot Locations\n\nThe scene begins with the two traveling through the streets, where townspeople stop to stare in disbelief at the sight of a black man on a horse, much to Schultz's (Christoph Waltz) confusion. After tying his cart down at a hitching post, Schultz checks some papers to make sure he's in the right place, and the two then walk into a saloon even though Django (Jamie Foxx) is forbidden from doing so. The scene where Django and Schultz arrive in the small town of Daughtrey near El Paso was filmed at Melody Ranch Studio in Newhall, near Santa Clarita, California. For over a century, Melody Ranch Studio has been a captivating backdrop for thrilling shoot-em-up films. Its rich history and rustic charm make it ideal for Western parody classics like Django Unchained. The studio boasts an impressive on-site prop house, complete with meticulously crafted western set dressing, both inside and out. Fans can visit the location and tour there, providing an exciting opportunity for those who love westerns. To get to Melody Ranch Studio, visitors can take the I-5 North from Los Angeles and exit onto Lyons Avenue, then drive about six miles to reach the studio. Moreover, there is public transportation available to reach your destination. With several bus transfers, you can arrive within a 2-hour journey from Los Angeles.\n\nUncover Santa Clarita Filming Locations\n\nWhile bathing, Django (Jamie Foxx) confesses to Schultz (Christoph Waltz) that his main goal, once liberated, is to buy freedom for his wife, Broomhilda von Shaft (Kerry Washington), who was sold into slavery after an escape attempt. Carrucan (Bruce Dern), their owner, disapproved of their marriage and was cruel. The Brittle brothers captured the couple, who tortured and branded them with a small \"R\" on their right cheeks. The bath scene where Django shares his heartbreaking story with Schultz was filmed at Kelly Warm Springs, with a few additional shots recorded in the National Elk Refuge. Kelly Warm Springs boasts an average temperature of 80 degrees Fahrenheit, setting it apart as a refreshingly cooler option among other hot springs. Families frequently indulge in delightful picnics on the lush meadow that envelops the pool. However, it is advised to exercise caution and refrain from entering the warm spring. During the spring season, bison and elk can be seen lingering by the pool as the grass greens up early. Visitors can drive north on Highway 191 for approximately 15 miles to Kelly Warm Springs from Jackson. The drive offers stunning views of the Grand Teton National Park, and the journey's final stretch involves a gravel road. Despite its secluded location, Kelly Warm Springs is still open to tourists, providing an exciting opportunity to experience a filming location from Django Unchained firsthand.\n\nExplore Filming Locations\n\nIn Gatlinburg, Django (Jamie Foxx) questions his escort, Betina (Miriam F. Glover), about the Brittles. When she admits to not knowing them, Django becomes suspicious that they are using a false name. Betina subsequently discloses that within the last year, a trio of overseer brothers, commonly referred to as the Schaeffers, made their arrival. She points out the first one in the field, whom Django sees through his telescope as Ellis (Doc Duhame). Django is overwhelmed by a powerful memory when he sees this, returning him to a vivid recollection of his attempt to escape with Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). In this haunting memory, Django pleads with Big John (M. C. Gainey) to spare her from the cruel whip, but his desperate pleas go unanswered. The memory concludes with Big John uttering, \"I like the way you beg, boy.\" The filming of this scene took place at the Evergreen Plantation, a functioning sugar cane plantation situated at 4677 Hwy 18 in Edgard, nestled between New Orleans and Baton Rouge. Although cotton was not cultivated on the plantation, fava bean plants were carefully tended to and adorned with cotton heads specifically for the film. Regrettably, Evergreen Plantation is currently not open to visitors. However, it has been transformed into a hub for research and education. In the meantime, they have graciously provided a fascinating virtual tour of the plantation, allowing you to explore its beauty from the comfort of your home. Fans can still catch a glimpse of the exterior from a distance. To get to the Evergreen Plantation from New Orleans, visitors can take I-10 west, head north on LA-3127, and continue on LA-3127 N until reaching the plantation.\n\nNew Orleans Filming Locations Exploration\n\nSchultz (Christoph Waltz) and Django (Jamie Foxx) plan to rescue Broomhilda (Kerry Washington); they bring her to Schultz's room, where he explains to her in German that he and his \"friend\" are here to rescue her. Django enters the room, and Broomhilda faints with joy upon seeing him. Impressed with Broomhilda's intelligence, Schultz starts the next phase of his plan. The 'Candyland' home of Calvin Candie, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, was specially built for the film. The setting of the exterior was carefully arranged to provide a picturesque view of the sprawling sugar cane fields at Evergreen Plantation. This historic plantation can be found at 4677 Highway 18 in Edgard, as mentioned before. However, the interior was built on a stage at Second Line Stages studio in New Orleans, Louisiana's largest studio and the country's first independent green film studio. Unfortunately, tours of the studio are not available. To reach Second Line Stages studio from central New Orleans, take Magazine St. Road. In just 10 minutes, you will arrive at your destination. Public transportation options are also available for your convenience.\n\nDiscover New Orleans Video Shoot Locations\n\nThe filming of Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained traversed diverse landscapes across California, Louisiana, and Wyoming, each contributing uniquely to the film's visual richness and authenticity. California's landscapes, including the rugged terrain of Alabama Hills and the iconic landmarks of Lone Pine, set the stage for pivotal scenes, evoking the essence of the Old West. Louisiana's Evergreen Plantation, with its striking antebellum architecture, added depth to the film's portrayal of the Deep South, capturing the haunting reality of that era. Lastly, the snowy expanses of Wyoming lent a raw and untamed beauty to the wintry scenes, emphasizing the harshness of the journey. The meticulous selection of these locations not only provided historical accuracy but also served as poignant backdrops that heightened the film's emotional intensity. The fusion of these three distinct regions culminated in a cinematic masterpiece, showcasing the visual tapestry of America's diverse landscapes and underscoring the importance of location authenticity in storytelling. Django Unchained stands as a testament to the power of location in creating an immersive and compelling cinematic experience."
