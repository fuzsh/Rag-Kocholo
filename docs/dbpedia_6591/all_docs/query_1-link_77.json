        "text": "Posted by Ra Moon\n\nIn the first season, The Wheel of Time was filmed in the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Croatia, and Spain.\n\nIn addition to the Eastern European countries, the second season was also shot in Italy, the Canary Islands (Spain), and Morocco.\n\nThe story, set in a world where only the Aes Sedai women are allowed to control the power of magic, is based on Robert Jordan's fantasy novels, the second best-seller series after The Lord of the Rings.\n\nShowrunner Rafe Judkins revealed that a total of eight seasons have already been planned, with a budget of over $10 million per episode.\n\nWelcome to our spoiler-free guide to all the filming locations of The Wheel of Time. You'll find the new season 2 updates below in the report.\n\nThe Wheel of Time Filming Locations\n\nMany of the landscapes that appear in the series were created by incorporating additional elements to the scene via CGI.\n\nIn the pilot episode, a pack of Aes Sedai led by Liandrin Guirale (played by Kate Fleetwood), are chasing two Jason Momoa-looking men.\n\nThe sequence was filmed somewhere in the Czech or Slovenian countryside, but what catches our attention are the huge stone pillars in the background.\n\nThis pinnacle scenery is the Zhangjiajie National Forest Park in China, as you can check out in the screenshot pictured on top, compared to a real photograph of this stunning place, which inspired James Cameron's Avatar.\n\n(You can open all the locations on Google Maps by clicking on the links below in the captions ↴)\n\nImage courtesy of Amazon Studios and Carlos Adampol - Map\n\nIn the next scene with a group of women of the first episode, “Leavetaking”, the small stone bridge over a stream is located in the Rakov Škocjan Valley in Slovenia.\n\nThis beautiful karst caves area is situated near the town of Cerknica, approximately 27 miles (44 km) south of the capital city, Ljubljana.\n\nImage courtesy of Sony Pictures Television - Map\n\nThe local Wisdom, Nynaeve (played by Zoë Robins), pushes Egwene (Madeleine Madden) off a cliff into the river.\n\nEgwene has to let the river guide her into the wild waters of the Great Soča Gorge (Velika Korita Soče), in the municipality of Bovec in northwestern Slovenia.\n\nYou can also experience the Soca River by taking a rafting tour, although for the less hard core there is a wonderful hike following the emerald green stream.\n\nImage courtesy of Amazon Studios - Map\n\nTwo Rivers, the remote village in the mountains where the four candidates to The Dragon reincarnation come from, was built in a quarry 40 kilometers outside of Prague.\n\nThe houses on this large set were built to be burned down after the Trolloc attack.\n\nAccording to the Czech Film Commission, the first season, which has been in production since 2019, required a total of 145 days of filming.\n\nThe scene where Rand and Egwene are sitting together on a rock, overlooking the mountains around the town, was filmed at Mangart Saddle in Slovenia.\n\nThis impressive mountain pass with spectacular views is located near the Italian border in the Julian Alps, at a height of 2,070 meters (about 6800 feet).\n\nImage courtesy of Amazon - Map\n\nThe other stone bridge, featured in a couple of scenes of the first episode, is Napoleon’s bridge across the Nadiža river in Slovenia, built in 1812 during the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nImage courtesy of Amazon Studios - Map\n\nThe company escapes from the Dark's One Army, the Servers of the Dark, also known as the Riders of Fade, or simply, the Trollocs, through the Julian Alps and the Soca River.\n\nIt looks like New Zealand, Lord of the Landscapes, doesn't it?\n\nMany scenes with the characters riding on horses have the Slovenian Alps mountain range as a backdrop.\n\nImage courtesy of Sony Pictures Television - Map\n\nIn episode two, \"Shadow's Waiting\", the group headed by Moiraine (Rosamund Pike) and Lan Mandragoran (Daniel Henney) spends the first night at Jeskyně Rozbořenka, and the second at Dolský mlýn (pictured).\n\nJeskyně Rozbořenka is an 18th-century excavated house, located in the Kokořínsko landscape protected area in the Central Bohemia region of the Czech Republic.\n\nThe picturesque ruins of Dolský mlýn comprise a mill house and a bridge, located at the Bohemian Switzerland National Park in the north of the Czech Republic.\n\nImage courtesy of Amazon Studios - Maps: Jeskyně Rozbořenka - Dolský mlýn\n\nThe waiting list for production space in Prague was so long that the showrunners decided to create their own studio from scratch, the Jordan Studios.\n\nThese studios, named after the writer of The Wheel of Time books, Robert Jordan, were set up in an old massive complex previously occupied by the Avia Motors company on the outskirts of Prague, in the Letňany district.\n\nThe sets of the White Tower, the city of Tar Valon, and the fallen city of Shadar Logoth, featured in the second episode, were also hosted here.\n\nImage courtesy of Amazon Studios - Map\n\nThe abandoned city of Shadar Logoth is a CGI composition loosely based on the traditional architecture of Rajasthan, capital Jaipur, India’s northern state.\n\nThe interior of the temple is a real location filmed at the former German Church of St. Wenceslas in Výsluní, in Czechia's Chomutov District.\n\nThe front of the altar, the gates, and some other sections of the church were modified with Indian-esque film props.\n\nThe run-down aspect of the structure has attracted other productions to film here, including The Borgias series and a video clip of Rammstein, \"Feuer Frei!\".\n\nImage courtesy of Sony Pictures Television - Map\n\nIn the third episode, \"A Place of Safety\", Rand (played by Josha Stradowski) and Mat (Barney Harris) are hiking the Velebit Nature Park mountains in the Balkans, situated on the Adriatic coast of Croatia.\n\nImage courtesy of Amazon Studios - Map\n\nAfter the trek, Rand and Mat arrive at the mining village of Breen's Spring.\n\nThe town was filmed at Quarry Great America (Velká Amerika), also known as the Czech Grand Canyon.\n\nAtlas of Wonders tracked down this spectacular former quarry near Mořinka when it was featured in the Sky Atlantic series Britannia. In fact, the set with the wooden bridge and some cottages resembles it.\n\nImage courtesy of Amazon Studios - Map\n\nPictured, a scene with Lan Mandragoran filmed at Pravčická brána, the famous archway formation in the Bohemian Switzerland area, also in the Czech Republic.\n\nThis location was also featured in Britannia and Carnival Row.\n\nImage courtesy of Sony Pictures Television - Map\n\nThe city of Ghealdan from episode four, \"The Dragon Reborn\", is actually Segovia in Spain.\n\nThe castle in this scene with Logain Ablar (played by Álvaro Morte, 'The Professor' from Money Heist) is the Alcázar of Segovia, a fortress and palace of medieval origin, turned into a military museum.\n\nImage courtesy of Amazon and Santiago Lopez-Pastor - Map\n\nThe fifth episode, \"Blood Calls Blood\", is the introduction to Tar Valon and the White Tower, a CGI creation that recalls Game of Thrones' King's Landing.\n\nThe graphic designers inserted the almost perfect silhouette of the Concepción Volcano on the island of Ometepe Lake in Nicaragua as the Dragonmount mountain in the background.\n\nHow do we know this? Because of the smaller cone of Maderas volcano, on the right of the image, and because I've been there.\n\nImage courtesy of Amazon and Bluesy Pete - Map\n\nThe White Tower seems inspired by the Bahá'í House of Worship in Wilmette, Illinois.\n\nThis intricate, nine-sided structure and lush gardens were built to create a welcoming space for people of all faiths to come together in reflection and unity.\n\nImage courtesy of Amazon and Michael D Photos / Map\n\nSome more findings: Is the fallen city of Shadar Logoth the dark version of Tar Valon?\n\nLooking at the streets of both cities, you can see that the showrunners used the same movie sets in the studio, changing a bit some sections.\n\nCompare the square window on the left in the upper picture with the building in the center of the lower image.\n\nThe spot where the Whitecloacks find the Tinkers and capture Egwene and Perrin (played by Marcus Rutherford) is the area of the caves and rock reliefs of Harfenice near Želízy in the Czech Republic.\n\nAll these sandstone sculptures were carved by a guy called Václav Levý just for fun from 1840 to 1845.\n\nImage courtesy of Amazon Studios - Map\n\nIn episode seven, \"The Dark Along the Ways\", the company arrives at the fortress city of Fal Dara after crossing The Ways.\n\nThe exterior scenes in the last bastion against the Blight were filmed in Terezín, a 18th-century military walled town in Czechia.\n\nImage courtesy of Amazon Studios - Map\n\nIn episode eight, Moiraine and Rand arrive at a circular pit - The Eye of the World.\n\nThis spot and the back of the wall in Tarwin's Gap were inspired by the awesome stepwells from western India.\n\nThese monumental structures, built to ensure water during periods of drought, were accessed by a series of descending sets of steps.\n\nImage courtesy of Amazon and Adam Cohn - Map\n\nThe last scene on the far western shore of the continent was filmed at Benijo Beach in Tenerife, Canary Islands (Spain).\n\nImage courtesy of Amazon Studios - Map\n\nThe New Second Season Locations\n\nAs the local press reported, Adeleas and Verin's home in the countryside is a historic masseria called Lo Spagnulo, located near Ostuni in Puglia, Italy.\n\nToday, this 18th century fortified farmhouse is a 3-star hotel where you can stay for about 260 euros ($280) per night.\n\nImage courtesy of Amazon - Map\n\nAlso in the first episode, \"A Taste of Solitude\", Perrin and Loial search for the Horn with the Shieneriens.\n\nThe scene pictured was filmed in the Calanchi Di Aliano, a lunar-like area located near Matera in Basilicata, Italy.\n\nImage courtesy of Amazon - Map\n\nThe scenes in The Foregate, Cairhien, were all filmed at the Barrandov Studio, located outside of Prague in the Czech Republic.\n\nImage courtesy of Amazon - Map\n\nThe estate of the dead Fade in the second episode, \"Strangers and Friends\", is the Kestřany Fortress, a 14th-century Gothic structure also located in the Czech Republic.\n\nImage courtesy of Amazon - Map\n\nWoTSeries reported that these scenes with Rand and Logain in a medical facility were filmed at the Chotěšov Abbey near Pilsen in the Czech Republic.\n\nImage courtesy of Amazon - Map\n\nThis village was a large set built somewhere in the Mělník District of Czequia.\n\nThe first scene with Ishamael in the fourth episode \"Daughter of the Night\", was filmed at the Adršpach Rocks.\n\nLocated near the border with Poland in the Czech Republic, this stunning natural wonder is characterized by towering sandstone formations and deep canyons.\n\nImage courtesy of Amazon - Map\n\nThe Masseria Borzone near Montalbano in Apulia (Italy) is featured in the scenes with Lan, Alanna and her warders.\n\nImage courtesy of Amazon - Map\n\nIn the fifth episode, \"Damane,\" the city of Falme appears for the first time, partially filmed on a set located at Atlas Studios in Ouarzazate, Morocco.\n\nThe lower scene is a screenshot from the 7th episode of the third season of Game of Thrones, where Daenerys arrives in the desert city of Astapor.\n\nImage courtesy of Amazon and HBO - Map\n\nThe establishing shot for the scene in Tel'aran'rhiod with Lanfear and Rand is the circular rock formation Gara Medouar near Rissani in Morocco.\n\nFrom the 11th century, defensive walls were erected and this round mountain became a fortress.\n\nImage courtesy of Amazon - Map\n\nAlso in the sixth episode, \"Eyes Without Pity\", the temple to the Forsaken is the Mansion Rock (or Panská skála) in Kamenický Šenov in Czechia.\n\nLike the Giant's Causeway in Ireland, this little wonder is an ancient volcanic formation of basalt columns.\n\nImage courtesy of Amazon and Miloslav Rejha - Map\n\nThe shallow-water beach and the cliffs far from Falme were filmed in the Dakhla Bay area, located at the southernmost tip of the Moroccan-claimed Western Sahara.\n\nThe bay's expansive lagoon, framed by windswept dunes and dramatic cliffs, is the perfect destination for windsurfing and kitesurfing enthusiasts.\n\nImage courtesy of Amazon - Map\n\nSeveral scenes in city of Falme from the season finale, \"What Was Meant to Be,\" were filmed in Essaouira, on Morocco's Atlantic coast.\n\nThe tower was created by casting digital magic over the city's walls and ramparts.\n\nEssaouira has been featured in other big productions including Game of Thrones, Jack Ryan, and John Wick 3.\n\nImage courtesy of Amazon -

In the ones with Egwene and Perrin?\n\n4- Anonymous - Dec 5, 2021, 9:55 PM\n\nWhere is the sacred pool from the 1st episode, was it CGI?\n\nReply\n\n5- Ra Moon - Dec 6, 2021, 15:35 PM\n\nI would say it's a set built in the studios.\n\n6- LLLD - Dec 22, 2021, 3:33 AM\n\nWhere is the throne room where the Aes Sedai meet located?\n\nReply\n\n7- Ra Moon - Dec 22, 2021, 12:50 AM\n\nIt's part of the set built at the studios near Prague.\n\n8- Cedric - Dec 25, 2021, 3:17 PM\n\nGood work, thanks.\n\n9- Anonymous - Dec 25, 2021, 3:17 PM\n\nThe scene with Rand and Egwene sitting together on a mountain overlooking the town was shot at Mangart Saddle in Slovenia.\n\n10- Sarah - Jan 6, 2022, 4:37 AM\n\nDoes anyone know the location of three huts with Rand and Egwene in between those huge cliffs in the last episode? (Or if it was a set?) Thank you!\n\n11- Anonymous - Jan 8, 2022, 9:48 PM\n\nMuch of the interior pillars and such were like those of Indian temples and step wells. Looks up BAPS temples and Rani Ki Vav.\n\n12- Anonymous - Oct 2, 2022, 4:56 AM\n\nA perfect cone-shaped volcano. Must be in Albay, Philippines, and not in Nicaragua.\n\n13- Tyrion Trakand - Jul 14, 2024, 12:33 PM\n\nThe Game of Thrones scene filmed at the same site as Falme was Astapor, not Yunkai. They are close geographically and culturally very similar, though.\n\nRa Moon\n\nAtlas of Wonders is looking for wonderful Filming Locations all around the world.
