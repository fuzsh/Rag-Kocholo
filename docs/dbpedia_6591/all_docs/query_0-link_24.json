The week of 19 Nov 1979, the Strelzyks and the Wetzels traveled to Los Angeles, CA, where they recorded twenty hours of interviews for Leetch, associate producer Marc Stirdivant, and writer John McGreevey. At this time, the film was referred to by an unofficial working title, The Balloon Movie.\n\nOn 25 Apr 1980, DV reported that actor David Soul arranged to meet with Disney executives to be considered for starring role in the film, which had been named The Last Flight to Freedom. A 3 Sep 1980 HR brief announcing the involvement of director Delbert Mann also indicated that the title had been twice changed, from Wind to the West to Night Crossing.\n\nAccording to a 25 Feb 1981 Var article, filming was scheduled to begin 1 Sep 1980 in Munich, Germany, but an eight-week Screen Actors Guild (SAG) strike delayed production until 27 Oct 1980. Production notes in AMPAS library files listed the German cities of Landsberg, Mühltal, Harthausen, and Munich among the filming locations. In the town of Eulenschwang, the production team recreated a $300,000, half-mile section of the border between East and West Germany. Near Lake Constance in Friedrichschafen, Germany, filmmakers transplanted 300 pine trees, 150 cubic yards of soil, and 6,000 square yards of black plastic to transform a large fair exhibition hall into a contained forest set. The construction project took two weeks and cost $150,000. Additional interior filming took place at Munich’s Bavaria Studios. Glendale, CA’s Balloon Ventures, Inc., owner, Gary Cerveny, created seven balloons for the picture, six of which were authentic recreations of the Strelzyk and Wetzel’s actual balloon, with material and technical changes made to appease Federal Aeronautic Administration regulations. The remaining balloon was a smaller utility aircraft used for preliminary tests and aerial photography. One balloon reportedly required 12,453 square feet of material. The 25 Feb 1981 Var reported that unexpected snowfall caused delays during the final week of filming, and production completed the week of 18 Jan 1981, at least a week behind and over budget. The final cost was estimated at more than $10 million.\n\nAlthough domestic release was originally scheduled for Christmas 1981, a 29 Dec 1981 DV item announced that the U.S. opening had been rescheduled for 5 Feb 1982 in 600 theaters, prior to which Disney would host its first-ever press junket in mid-Jan 1982, including a preview of the film and interview sessions with the cast. Positive test screenings had reportedly been held in Seattle, WA, and White Plains, NY, and a 29 Jan 1982 Albuquerque Journal advertisement indicated that the film was also shown in Albuquerque, NM. On 16 Feb 1982, DV and HR stated that Night Crossing had its European premiere in Hamburg 11 Feb 1982, followed by another premiere in Berlin, Germany, 12 Feb 1982, which took place just before the Berlin International Film Festival (BIFF). The articles reported that BIFF director Moritz de Hadeln refused to admit the picture as the festival’s opening feature for fear of offending East Germany. Despite protests from the film’s German distributor, Twentieth Century-Fox, and German newspaperman Axel Springer, de Hadeln defended the film’s quality but still refused its inclusion for “artistic reasons.”\n\nThe picture was released in Germany under the title With the Wind to the West; the 21 Jan 1982 DV scheduled its North German opening in sixty theaters before later expanding to 200 South German theaters and opening in the U.S. 5 Feb 1982.\n\nLess\n\nIn Poessneck, East Germany, on 4 April 1978, teenager Lukas Keller is excused from school to stand on the street gathering signatures for the East German Democratic Republic.

A few months later, Peter and Günter plan to run away in a homemade hot air balloon, but their wives laugh at the idea. The two men withdraw their savings in order to buy thousands of yards of fabric, which they claim will be used in constructing tents for a camping club. As Günter sews, his wife, Petra Wetzel, worries that the neighbors are becoming suspicious. Peter builds a burner, but discovers it is too weak to provide sufficient inflation for the balloon. One day, Josef returns from his grief-driven isolation and tells Peter he must cut off all contact with the Strelzyk and Wetzel families in order to protect them. Although Peter’s work on the burner progresses, by December 1978, Petra becomes anxious with fear and convinces Günter to back out of the plan. Günter agrees to stop speaking to the Strelzyks as Peter moves ahead with preparations. The following April, Peter, his wife, and his children successfully inflate the balloon in a secluded field. On the night of 3 July 1979, the Strelzyks say goodbye to Doris’s mother and attempt to escape. After a few minutes in the air, the gas tank fails, and the balloon crashes in the woods. Hoping to have cleared the border, the family falls out of the basket, and the balloon floats away. However, Peter realizes they have landed within the border zone, and they quietly sneak away, clean up the launch site, and return home. In the morning, border patrolmen confiscate the deflated balloon and the SSD begins an investigation to discover its origin. Later that day, Peter breaks into tears about failing to lead his family to safety, but the children encourage him to try again. On 11 July 1979, Peter visits the Wetzels to borrow Günter’s trailer so he can rebuild and transport the balloon. Meanwhile, at SSD headquarters, lead investigator Major Koerner anticipates the would-be escapees will make another attempt. Günter convinces Petra to let him help Peter’s efforts, and the two families race to finish constructing the balloon before the police can catch them. The fabric store owner who sold Peter and Günter the original cloth describes the men to Major Koerner, while a second store owner becomes suspicious of Peter’s request for more material and telephones the authorities. Peter sneaks away before the SSD arrive, and as a result, the family members take turns buying batches of fabric to continue sewing. On 15 September 1979, Major Koerner discovers a bottle of blood pressure medication near the crash site, which Doris dropped in the woods the night of the escape. After the town pharmacist gives Major Koerner a list of names of people who use the medicine, the SSD spend the entire day investigating each patient. Minutes after the Strelzyks and Wetzels leave with the balloon in tow, Major Koerner arrives at the Wetzels’ home and speaks with their suspicious neighbor, who confirms their scheming. As the eight family members climb into the basket and lift off the ground into the night sky, the balloon catches fire and damages the fabric. Meanwhile, Major Koerner tracks their trajectory from a helicopter, but loses sight of them when the hot air burner goes out. The balloon slowly descends, and the families land in a forest. As the women and children hide among the trees, Peter and Günter find a police officer, who confirms they are in West Germany. Sending up a signal flare, the Strelzyk and Wetzel families embrace and rejoice in their success.\n\nLess"
