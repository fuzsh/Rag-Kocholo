        "text": "No spy has been to more places: James Bond is roaming the big screen since 60 years and has hunted villains across the globe. Here are the most iconic James Bond Film Locations!\n\nWhen James Bond saved the world for the first time on the big screen in “Dr. No”, he already set a cinema standard: 007 will be a traveling agent. Starting in London, he is sent to Jamaica to fight evil in paradise. The formula hadn’t been changed ever since. Bond had missions in Brazil, Japan and Turkey, visited Madagascar, Mexico and Morocco – and even went to space. While other productions filmed in studios or their own backyard, EON always put Bond on the front line and went to real places around the world.\n\nIn 60 years of film making a breathtaking variety of fascinating James Bond film locations congregated. We are following in 007’s footsteps since 2011, trying to visit all those places. Now in honor of the 60th anniversary of the screening of “Dr. No” we compiled our list of the most iconic movie locations. A lot of villain lairs and romantic hotels made it into the collection. But unsurprisingly, places in both Switzerland and the Caribbean fill the top spots more than once. Bond is after all – like his creator Ian Fleming – a man of both: the mountains and the sea.\n\nThis is our ranking of the most iconic James Bond Film Locations:\n\n60th – Mount Asgard on Baffin Island, Canada\n\nA 9-hour-flight from Montréal to Pangnirtung, a 30 kilometer boatride up the fjord towards Akshayuk Pass and another 25 kilometers on foot: There probably isn’t a more remote and harder to reach Bond location then Mount Asgard in Canada. The cylindrical plateau was used for the iconic opening stunt in “The Spy Who Loved Me” – so don’t forget your skiers and parachute.\n\n59th – Crocodile Farm at Falmouth, Jamaica\n\nJamaica is one of Bond’s home turfs and the Swamp Safari Crocodile Farm at Falmouth stands out as one of the most thrilling locations there. In “Live and Let Die” 007 escapes some henchmen in a jump and run scene across some crocodiles – then performed by farm owner Ross Kananga.\n\n58th – Château de Chantilly, France\n\n“A View To A Kill” baddy Max Zorin resides in the stunning Château de Chantilly outside Paris, his horse hippodrome just nearby. Bond has his fair share with regal French mansions – this is the most luxurious!\n\n57th – Maiden Tower in Istanbul, Turkey\n\nThe climax in “The World Is Not Enough” takes place at the Bosporus – with Istanbuls Maiden’s Tower – or in Turkish Kız Kulesi – at the center. The island hosted an 18th century light house and is full of mystery. (Read more about our visit here.)\n\n56th – Grachtengordel in Amsterdam, the Netherlands\n\nThe “Grachtengordel” is Amsterdams canal belt in the old city center – and a place filled with magic. Tiffany Case lives here in a small house in “Diamonds Are Forever”, near the famous Rembrandtsplein with many bars, pubs and restaurants and the infamous Red Light District. (Read more about our visit here.)\n\n55th – Seebühne Bregenz, Austria\n\nBond is a natural at the opera – but this opera house is special. Situated open air at Lake Constanze, the Seebühne Bregenz hosts magnificent displays ever season. The iconic big eye for their “Tosca” performance can be seen in “Quantum of Solace”. (Read more about our visit here.)\n\n54th – Coral Harbour on New Providence, Bahamas\n\nYou can’t think Bond without scuba diving scenes – most prominently in “Thunderball”. Almost every water action over the years had been filmed at the south west reefs of New Providence off Coral Harbour. The remains of the Vulcan Bomber prop are a dive site till today. (Read more about our visit here.)\n\n53rd – Villa Arabesque in Acapulco, Mexico\n\nIn “Licence To Kill” they were going loco in … Mexico. And the finale took place in this weirdly beautiful estate with its lush gardens, disco and funicular railway. The daliesque interior design is one of a kind.\n\n52nd – The city of Cadiz, Spain\n\nWant to visit Cuba without traveling all the way to Cuba? Cadiz in southern Spain is your choice! In “Die Another Day” the small costal town doubles for Havanna and is full of some fine James Bond Film Locations – and still a truly relaxed town.\n\n51st – La Tour Eiffel in Paris, France\n\nSometimes Bond is off the beaten track, sometimes he visits famous landmarks. But then in style: In “A View To A Kill” 007 is atop the Eiffel Tower, dining at the luxurous peak restaurant – before engaging in a adrenaline chase. (Read more about our visit here.)\n\n50th – Schönbrunn Palace Theater in Vienna, Austria\n\nIn “The Living Daylights” Kara is allowed to performs Tchaikovsky at the end of the movie – in one of the most beautiful theaters in Vienna. The small theatre inside the Schönbrunn Palace is the one, where late emperor Franz Joseph I and his wife “Sissi” sat in. It’s not always open for public – but we know how to get in. (Read more about our visit here.)\n\n49th – Key West at Florida, USA\n\n“Licence to Kill” makes good use of the US’ southernmost point – with a visit to the famous home of Ernest Hemingway as well as scenes along the Seven Mile Bridge and raunchy pubs. (Read more about our visits here.)\n\n48th – Corfu Island, Greece\n\nBond is a fan of Italy, but sadly hasn’t been around Greece much. Lucky exception: the splendid island of Corfu, used excessively for locations both in Greece and Spain in “For Your Eyes Only”. The iconic Citroen chase was filmed in the olive plantations around Pagi. (Read more about our visits here.)\n\n47th – Taj Mahal in Agra, India\n\nThe Taj Mahal is an embodiment of love, a marble mausoleum built by a 17th century shah for his late wife. When Bond came to India in “Octopussy” he flew by the Taj Mahal near Agra – though his place of action, Udaipur, is almost 600 kilometers away. We can’t blame him. This beauty has to be visited. (Read more about our visit here.)\n\n46th – Iguazu Falls, Argentina\n\nAfter a thrilling boat chase through the Brazilian jungle, Bond escapes down the huge Iguazu Falls in “Moonraker”. The massive landmark is placed directly at the border to Argentina – and a natural site not to be missed.\n\n45th – Elrod House in California, USA\n\nThe Elrod House is a very exclusive estate, designed by American architect John Lautner – and place of the showdown between Bond, Bambi and Thumper in “Diamond Are Forever”. Lautner integrated the surrouding nature and rocks into the building, forming a spectacular home.\n\n44th – The city of Estoril, Portugal\n\nThe classy seaside resort Estoril in western Portugal is one of the main attractions in “On Her Majesty’s Secret Service”. Bond stays at the Hotel Palacio Estoril with the casino vis-a-vis. Nearby is Praia do Guincho, the other fella’s beach.\n\n43rd – Hotel Atlantic in Hamburg, Germany\n\nIn “Tomorrow Never Dies” Bond comes to Hamburg and stays at the chic Alster hotel Atlantic. He has to escape the henchmen over the roof, climbing along the iconic illuminated Atlas statue. There is a hidden balcony behind – and we know a trick how to visit the place. (Read more about our visit here.)\n\n42nd – Thunderball Grotto, Exumas, Bahamas\n\nIn “Thunderball” the nuclear warheads are hidden inside a fictional underwater cave – and guarded by vicious (and also fictional) “golden grotto sharks”. The place is real though: A cave at the Staniel Cay in the Exumas. And instead of sharks you’ll find swimming pigs nearby.\n\n41st – Metéora at Kalambaka, Greece\n\nGreece’ mountainous hinterland is home to some monasteries and nunneries near Kalambaka. In “For Your Eyes Only” one was used as a hideout and Bond had to climb the steep mountain. Metéora means “in the heavens above” in Greek – and the name fits. Stay overnight for a beautiful sunrise. (Read more about our visit here.)\n\n40th – Jökulsárlón, Iceland\n\nJökulsárlón is Icelandic for “glacial river lagoon” – and the name doesn’t quite cover the beauty of the place. Icy mountains, rough lands and a harsh beauty offer an everchanging scenery. And a dramatic backdrop for car chases, like in “Die Another Day”.\n\n39th – Checkpoint Charlie in Berlin, Germany\n\nSure, Checkpoint Charlie is a touristic hotspot and was barely visible in “Octopussy”. But the place in once divided Berlin stands for a whole era of espionage and Cold War shenanigans. Bond is usually larger than life, but this locations stands for the more realistic and grounded parts of the movie series.\n\n38th – Trafalgar Square in London, UK\n\nYou probably wont get more James Bond Film Locations crammed together at one place. Trafalgar Square in the heart of London has locations from “Skyfall”, “Spectre” and “The Living Daylights” both above and underground – and Whitehall with much more locations is just down the road.\n\n37th – Grandhotel Pupp in Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic\n\nIn “Casino Royale” Bond takes part at a high stakes poker game, based in a French resort in the book – but changed to Montenegro in the movie. Filming took place in this petite Czech city and it fits perfectly. Both the Grandhotel Pupp and the neighboring Kaiserbad spa doubling as the casino offer a nice faded grandezza. (Read more about our visit here.)\n\n36th – Grand Bazaar in Istanbul, Turkey\n\nIstanbuls Kapalı Çarşı – or Grand Bazaar – is one of the world’s biggest covered markets. The small alleys and buzzling small invite for thrilling spy games. Or motorcycle chases. So Bond came here twice, in “From Russia With Love” and “Skyfall”. (Read more about our visit here.)\n\n35th – Trøllanes, Kalsoy, The Faroer Islands\n\nIn “No Time To Die” James Bond has time to die – and does so on a small islandbetween Russia and Japan. In reality is the Faroer Islands Kalsoy, in the North Sea. The small fishing village Trøllanes got CGI-enhanced to be the remote lair of Safin. Now a fictional tomb stone remembers the franchise-changing scene.\n\n34th – Rajadamnern Stadion in Bangkok, Thailand\n\nThe Rajadamnern Stadion is home to the fiercest Muay Thai fighters of Thailand – and was used for a spy encounter in “The Man With The Golden Gun”. The atmosphere is thrilling: Sharp fights, drunk gamblers, lots of action. But the event comes at a high price: Many fighters are underaged, some boys look as young as 12 or 13. (Read more about our visit here.)\n\n33rd – Piazza San Marco in Venice, Italy\n\nBeautiful Piazza San Marco is the heart of Venice and a place to see even without a Bond connection. With the St Mark’s Basilica, the clocktower and the Doge’s Palace adjacent, you have many of Venice’s landmarks around. Sure, Bond has to visit both in “Moonraker” and “Casino Royale“.\n\n32nd – Casino de Monte Carlo, Monaco\n\nIn “Goldeneye” the agent comes to Monaco to gamble and to set himself on the trails of Janus. It is classy, exuberant, full of gold: The casino of Monte Carlo is a place right our of Bond lore.\n\n31st – Stoke Park Country Club in Buckinghamshire, UK\n\nYou don’t need fast cars or shoot-outs to produce suspense and show the malevolence between the hero and the villain. Sometimes a golf game is enough. The course at Stokes delivers a perfect setting in “Goldfinger”.\n\n30th – Taj Lake Palace, Udaipur, India\n\nThe Taj Lake Palace in Udaipur is “A Thousand and One Nights” come to life: Once a Maharaja palace, the nowadays luxury hotel treats its guests like royals. And the regal rowboat used in “Octopussy” can now be booked for excursions and candle-light dinners. (Read more about our visit here.)\n\n29th – The French Quarter in New Orleans, USA\n\nA joyous funeral parade with the deceased still alife – at least till the parade reaches him. The opening of “Live and Let Die” offers a gruesome scene and sets the tone for a voodoo-esque movie. Better visit this beautful city in bright daylight.\n\n28th – Hashima Island, Japan\n\nBond villains love their remote islands – the weirder, the better. Probably the most absurd island is the one inhabited by Silva in “Skyfall”. Once a working colony off Japan, it is now a derelict ghost town in the middle of the Pacific. Filming never really took place there, but the island is real and can be visited.\n\n27th – The “Dragon Garden” Villa in Hong Kong\n\nPack your third nipple and try to get access to this gem: The Dragon Garden at Castle Peak Road in Hong Kong is normally not open to public. But the beauty of villa used in “The Man With The Golden Gun” is hard to beat.\n\n26th – Sugarloaf Mountain, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n\nThe intense cable-car fight in “Moonraker” is a beautiful action piece – met with a spectacular view at Rio and its beaches. It might be a crowded tourist attraction, but it is full of Bond galore.\n\n25th – Villa La Gaeta, Lago di Como, Italy\n\nAt the end of “Casino Royale”, Daniel Craigs Bond says his signature line for the first time – at beautiful Villa La Gaeta in northern Italy. Access to the luxury lake house comes at a high price, but you can always opt for a view from the lake with a rental boat.\n\n24th – Liguanea Club in Kingston, Jamaica\n\nWhere it all began: The Liguanea club house in the northern part of Kingston hosted Strangway’s bridge game. With the murder in the parking lot cinemas longest movie franchise began its magic.\n\n23rd – The city of Matera, Italy\n\nThe City of Stone, Matera, is the setting of Bond’s sort-of-honeymoon in “No Time To Die”. The small roads and cave houses nestled between the hills are perfect for a romantic setting – and a DB5 car chase.\n\n22nd – Cala di Volpe, Sardegna, Italy\n\nCala di Volpe is one of the iconic landmarks at Costa Smeralda and the main hub for the rich and famous. The luxury hotel from “The Spy Who Loved Me” is close to Capricciola Bay, offers great Martinis and a fine cuisine in a truly Bondian atmosphere. (Read more about our visit here.)\n\n21st – The Winter Palace in St. Petersburg, Russia\n\nThe Winter Palace was the official residence of the Russian Emperor for ages – and now hosts the magnificent Hermitage Museum. Wandering the imperial halls is a dream. But probably not so much for Bond: In “Goldeneye” he encountered the Russian defense minister here.\n\n20th – Himeji Castle, Japan\n\nHimeji-jo is a vast hilltop samurai castle complex fit for martial arts training. In “You Only Live Twice” Bond preps with the Japanese secret service for his encounter with Blofeld. The castle is the largest in Japan – and one of the most precious.\n\n19th – Hotel Danieli in Venice, Italy\n\nIn “Moonraker” Bond bands together with CIA agent Holly Goodhead – in the exclusive Doge Dandolo Royal Suite from famous Hotel Danieli. The luxury hotel is situated right at the entry to the Canal Grande and the San Marco Piazza, offering great views on Venice.\n\n18th – One & Only Ocean Club on Paradise Island, The Bahamas\n\nNew Providence and it’s neighboring Paradise Island are cramped with exhausting gambling hotels. The One & Only from “Casino Royale” is a quaint exception, nestled between a white sand beach and sculpture garden. Their take on the famous Vesper Martini is great as well! (Read more about our visit here.)\n\n17th – Giza Pyramids near Cairo, Egypt\n\nOld, but sturdy – the pyramids are the last of the seven world wonders to still stand in the Egyptian desert. The city of Cairo might have crawled close over the years, but once you stand before the huge monuments, the noise and filth magically disappears. And the evening show seen in “The Spy Who Loved Me” is still on. (Read more about our visit here.)\n\n16th – Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, USA\n\nSome of the best action stunts in the Bond franchise revolve around famous landmarks – with the finale from “A View To A Kill” at the Golden Gate Bridge definitly earning a top spot.\n\n15th – Sölden, Austria\n\nThis famous ski hub in the Austrian Alps was home to the remote Hoffler clinic in “Spectre” – and made good use from the Bond fame. Nowadays a superb exhibition atop the mountain brings you in the right vibe for ski chases and a relaxing Martini at “ice Q” restaurant afterwards. (Read more about our visit here.)\n\n14th – Zocalo Square in Mexico City, Mexico\n\nThe one-shot opening from “Spectre” is a cineastic masterpiece and culminates in some fine helicopter stunts above the crowds at the Zocalo. The huge square is breathtaking itself, more so during the Day of the Dead, when the city stages parades like seen in the movie. And actualy only since the movie – as the parades where totally fictional beforehand.\n\n13th – Villa Balbianello, Lago di Como, Italy\n\nAfter a brutal torture, Bond recovers at this lakeside gem in “Casino Royale”. Villa Balbianello was once a Franciscan monastery from the 13th century,and is today one of the most romantic spots at Lago di Como. It is open to the public, so come before the crowds for a golden morning sun.\n\n12th – Arecibo Observatory, Puerto Rico\n\nNestled into the jungle of Puerto Rico is the Arecibo Observatory – once with a cable-mounted huge telescope. The cables cracked 2020, demolishing the whole observatory. But the setting from “Goldeneye” still is awesome.\n\n11th – Piz Gloria on Schilthorn, Switzerland\n\nBlofeld had his mountain lair atop Schilthorn in “On Her Majesty’s Secret Service” and the folks in Switzerland make good use of the fame: Nowadays a revolving restaurants with memorabilia and lots of Bond stuff celebrate the movie.\n\n10th – Erfoud, Morocco\n\nBlofeld also had another mountain lair in the nowhere of the Moroccan desert. In “Spectre” the weird-shaped mountain is supposed to be a meteor crater – in reality the middle isn’t as flat and definitly hasn’t room for all of Blofelds buildings. Traveling there still is an adventure! (Read more about our visit here.)\n\n9th – Shinmoe-dake Vulcano, Japan\n\nWe were talking about mountain hideouts? In “You Only Live Twice” Blofled chooses a vulcano, including a rocket-launching plattform. Bond infiltrates the place with Little Nellie and later on hiking. You can go for the second option as well, the whole area around Shinmoe-dake is a natural park.\n\n8th – MI6-Headquarter in London, UK\n\nThere probably wouldn’t be a Bond without this building. The MI6 Building at Vauxhall Cross is home to the real British Intelligence Service and was used in numerous Bond films – including it’s destruction in “Spectre”. (Read more about our visit here.)\n\n7th – Khlong Rangsit outside Bangkok, Thailand\n\nA backwater canal on the outskirts of megacity Bangkok, merely some wooden huts adjoining. This is spectacular? It is! In “The Man With The Golden Gun” the astro spiral jump was filmed here – and a small tarmac between all the unpaved roads used for acceleration still commemorates the stunt place. (Read more about our visit here.)\n\n6th – Glen Etive, Scotland, UK\n\nDo you have to life a sad childhood to become a blunt instrument? Maybe. At least we understand, why Bond is driven to visit the most exotic places when he grew up between misty mountains in Scotland. But lets be true: The valley seen in “Skyfall” is both iconic and in its own way beautiful.\n\n5th – Verzasca Dam, Switzerland\n\nIn “Goldeneye” Bond infiltrates a Russian army base with a spectacular 220 metres jump from Verzasca Dam. The dam is actually located in southern Switzerland – and an operator offers bungee jumps in Bond style. (Read and see more about our visit – and jump – here.)\n\n4th – Les Ambassadeurs Casino in London, UK\n\nThe name? “Bond. James Bond”. The first time ever, 007 mutters these iconic lines is in “Dr. No” at Les Ambassadeurs in London, introducing himself to his new love affair Sylvia Trench. “Les A” is a members only gambling club, which makes it even more natural to give it an exclusive spot in this ranking.\n\n3rd – James Bond Island at Phang Nga Bay, Thailand\n\nDubbed by many location hunters as the holy grail to James Bond film locations, Scaramangas island hideout in “The Man With The Golden Gun” really is a must-see. Sure, a whole tourism industry revolves around it, but if you arrive early, you might have time for a little Bond vibe at the beach. (Read more about our visit here.)\n\n2nd – Furka Pass, Switzerland\n\nThe Aston Martin DB5 is the one car best associated with Bond. And in “Goldfinger” it is presented in the most beautiful way – with the pursuit through the Swiss Alps. The winding roads at Furka Pass oer great views and invite for some iconic re-enactment photos.\n\n1st – Ocho Rios Beach, Jamaica\n\nThis location doesn’t really need an explanation, does it? It was here where Honeychile Rider emerged from the sea in the first ever Bond movie “Dr. No”. Bond started his charming “Mango Tree” tune. Was he looking for shells? No, he was just looking.\n\nAnd hopefully he will keep on looking… as the world is not enough.\n\nStill want more?\n\nCheck out our location map with all James Bond Film Locations right here!\n\n© 2022 HuntingBond"
