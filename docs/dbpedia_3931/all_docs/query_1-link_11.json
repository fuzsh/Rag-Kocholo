        "text": "Fred Astaire did not make very many nonmusical films. This was his second after ON THE BEACH, and it felt like a musical without the songs and dances. The original play role was done by Cyril Ritchard, and although it was not a hugh success in New York or London, it remains an enduring play that is often seen in little theaters, dinner theaters, and, because the content is so squeaky clean, at schools. Astaire is a playboy who returns to San Francisco after not having been there or seen his daughter, Reynolds, for 15 years. She had forgotten how suave her dad was and is now immensely captivated by his charm, which eludes his former wife, Palmer. It's just a few days before Reynolds' wedding, and Astaire takes over, altering the plans, changing arrangements, etc. Reynolds is engaged to Hunter, a wealthy but unsophisticated rancher, and the difference between the two men is instantly evident. She soon finds Hunter to be rather boorish, and arguments erupt. Astaire doesn't think Hunter is worthy of Reynolds and is happy at this turn of events. Palmer is now married to Merrill, a rich man, and Astaire does his best to break that up as well. Merrill begins to be jealous of the way Astaire has insinuated himself into the lives of everyone. The group visits Hunter's spread and Astaire sprains one of his limbs. Reynolds aborts the wedding and tells everyone that she intends spending the next few years traveling with Astaire and helping him through his dotage. Astaire, who had never thought of himself as being old, is not enthused at Reynolds' declaration and bids the wedding go on. It does, and Astaire departs taking two souvenirs, a photograph of Reynolds as a child and Merrill's superb house boy, Fong. They are happy and depressed about Astaire. While he was there, he was a disturbing influence, but he was so darned interesting that there was no doubt about the pleasure of his company. Ruggles chimes in with some good comedy timing as the remaining grandfather, and the picture always seems to be on the verge of song and dance, but, aside from the title song, there is none. Edith Head does a cameo as a dress designer."
