And while many people may never pick up a book of poetry or attend an open mic, we all watch movies.\n\nColumbus poet and Streetlight Guild founder Scott Woods has organized a series of three nights of film and poetry readings that illuminate the often-overlooked benefits—and pleasure—of poetry, quality cinema, and the marriage of the two as a communal experience. Each night will include a film screening, a reading by Woods, and a reading by another Columbus poet."
