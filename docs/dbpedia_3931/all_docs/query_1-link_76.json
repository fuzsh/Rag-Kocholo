        "text": "It's hard to imagine a more luscious, melodic, beguiling and captivating romantic comedy score than what Alfred Newman delivered for The Pleasure of His Company. The score gets off to a stunning start with a great Newman theme, \"Lullaby in Blue\"a theme that is the cornerstone of the score and will reappear at frequent intervals. The main secondary theme occurs soon thereafter, Newman's Pleasure of His Company theme. There's a wonderful theme for Astaire, a kind of \"traveling music\" that is infectious and fun. And there are other lovely themes along the way to the happy ending. The score is like a sparkling glass of champagnesophisticated, lush, witty, tender and pure Newman.\n\nThis is the first CD release for The Pleasure of His Company and we present the complete score, the source music, and some demo cues, mostly in stereo from the original session masters housed in the Paramount vaults. A world premiere score release by Alfred Newman is always cause for celebrationso, pop open the champagne and be prepared to be charmed by one of the greatest film composers who ever lived.\n\nThis release is limited to 1000 copies."
