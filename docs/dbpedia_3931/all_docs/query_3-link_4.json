        "text": "Samuel Taylor’s screenplay, based on the Broadway comedy Cornelia Otis Skinner and he concocted, is the sort of property that rises or falls with the comic conduct of the cast and the calibre of the direction. George Seaton’s direction, for the most part, indicates verve and humorous perception, letting down only briefly in the picture’s lethargic midsection. Most of the performances are bright and keen-witted, and in one or two cases downright inventive.\n\nFred Astaire plays the role originated by Cyril Ritchard on the stage, that of the prodigal, middle-aged playboy papa who returns after a 15-20 year absence to visit his wealthy ex-wife (Lilli Palmer) and daughter (Debbie Reynolds) just prior to the latter’s wedding. Balance of the film consists of a contest of sorts in which Astaire more or less vies with his daughter’s fiance for her affection over the protestations of the shrewd, knowing Palmer and the vexations of her present husband.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nIt is Palmer who steals the show. Her reactions are responsible for the picture’s strongest comedy wallops, and she comes through equally fine during the weaker sentimental passages. The venerable Astaire isn’t very far behind."
