        "text": "MILFORD, Pa. - Tab Hunter, 86, fresh from winning a blue ribbon at a horse show, enjoyed dinner and was interviewed Friday night at the Black Bear Film Festival Gala at the Hotel Fauchere. The appearance by the film star of the 1950s and '60s came as the festival, on its opening night, screened \"Tab Hunter, Confidential,\" a documentary about his life. The movie's producer, Allan Glaser, appeared with him at the screening at the Milford Theatre.\n\n“It took seven years to make the film, five to talk Hunter into it,” said Glaser, who is also Hunter's longtime partner. “He’s a little shy.”\n\nHunter, a teen idol early in his career and known for starring roles in movies like \"Battle Cry,\" \"The Burning Hills\" and \"The Pleasure of His Company,\" was mucking stalls at 14, when he was discovered by an agent.\n\n“If I hadn’t become an actor, I would have been an equestrian,” said Hunter, noting that his last name came from his hobby of riding hunter-jumper on horseback.\n\nThe festival continues Saturday, beginning with a children’s animated feature with serious undertones, “My Life as a Zucchini,” followed by “A Good Day To Die,” a documentary about a combat photographer. Two films by Pennsylvania filmmakers follow: a drama filmed in Promised Land State Park, and a documentary about the Mexican state of Yucatan. Filmmakers will appear for question-and-answer sessions after screenings. Then comes a period drama by TV producer Tom Fontana, and “The Normal Heart,” about the AIDS epidemic, written by Larry Kramer, who will take questions afterward. The night ends with a mystery drama and horror film.\n\nSunday features three documentaries: one about educating women in Indonesia, by Pennsylvanian Sue Useem, who will appear for discussion; one about urban development, followed by a local panel; and a third about pianist Cy Walter.\n\nMeanwhile, all weekend, free salons go on at Milford Public Library and Good Shepherd Episcopal Church, with a wide variety of presentations and short films.\n\nTickets for festival screenings at the Milford Theatre, 114 East Catherine St., are $10 in advance, $12 at the door. The free salons are at Good Shepherd Epsicopal Church, 321 Fifth St., and Milford Public Library, 119 East Harford St. For more, visit blackbearfilm.com or call 570-409-0909."
