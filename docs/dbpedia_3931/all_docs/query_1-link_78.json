        "text": "In the 1950s, Tab Hunter was one of Hollywood's hottest stars.\n\nNot only was he No. 1 at the box office, he was No. 1 on the record charts. But underneath the glitz and glamour of stardom, Hunter had a secret.\n\nIn a world that did not yet accept sexual diversity, he was gay.\n\n\"That word wasn't around in the '50s,\" Hunter says. \"There was a scandal that came out and I thought it was going to ruin my career.\"\n\nIn September 1955, Confidential reported Hunter's 1950 arrest for disorderly conduct at a gay party. The magazine followed with a second article focusing on Rory Calhoun's three-year prison record as a youth for theft.\n\nBoth stories were the result of talent agent Henry Willson making a deal with Confidential, which had threatened to publish an expose about Rock Hudson's secret homosexual life. Hudson was Willson's most prominent client, so Willson made a deal to disclose information about Hunter and Calhoun in exchange for the magazine dropping the story on Hudson.\n\n\"The rag magazines blew it way out of proportion, especially Confidential magazine,\" Hunter says. \"I thought it was going to ruin my career.\"\n\nBut there was no scandal as a result of the story. In fact, a few months later, Hunter was named Most Promising New Personality in a nationwide poll sponsored by the Council of Motion Picture Organizations.\n\nIt was another career high for the former Arthur Gelien.\n\n\"I was born in New York City,\" Hunter says. \"My father was very abusive to my mother, and she left and took my brother and me to California when I was 2. We grew up in San Francisco, Long Beach and Los Angeles.\"\n\nHunter worked as a stable boy, where he met his closest friend, actor-turned-agent Dick Clayton.\n\n\"He later became the agent for Jimmy Dean, Jane Fonda and Angie Dickinson,\" Hunter says. \"He loved horses and that's where the friendship started out. He told me, 'You should become an actor.'\"\n\nAs a teenager, Hunter was a figure skater who competed in both singles and pairs. At 15, he lied about his age to join the U.S. Coast Guard, where he was nicknamed \"Hollywood\" because he'd rather watch movies than go to bars while on liberty.\n\nThe stage name \"Tab Hunter\" was given to him by his first agent. His first role was in the film \"Island of Desire\" with Linda Darnell.\n\n\"I was so bad I couldn't get arrested,\" Hunter says. \"Then I got under contract with Warner Bros. and tested for 'Battle Cry.' That one really started me.\"\n\nThe 1955 World War II film launched Hunter's career.\n\nIn \"Battle Cry,\" released in 1955, he played Danny, a young Marine who has an affair with an older woman, but marries the girl next door. The role launched him as a romantic lead.\n\nHis other hit films include \"The Burning Hills\" with Natalie Wood, \"That Kind of Woman\" with Sophia Loren, \"Gunman's Walk\" with Van Heflin and \"The Pleasure of His Company\" with Debbie Reynolds.\n\nIn 1957, Hunter recorded the No. 1 hit, \"Young Love\" for Dot Records.\n\n\"I used to sing in the church and the shower,\" he says. \"Everybody sounds good in the shower with the echo.\n\n\"Natalie Wood and I were on tour. A DJ named Howard Miller asked me if I ever sang.\n\n\"Randy Wood was president of Dot Records, which recorded Pat Boone and Gale Storm,\" Hunter says. \"He gave me a song called 'Young Love.'\"\n\nThe Jordanaires, Elvis Presley's background singers, were hired to do backup for Hunter. The record sold more than 1 million copies.\n\n\"I first heard it in my car on Sunset Boulevard,\" Hunter says. \"I almost hit a palm tree, I was so excited. By then, I was in contract with Warner Bros.\n\n\"Mr. Warner said, 'We own you for everything,'\" Hunter says. \"I said, 'You don't have a recording studio.' He said, 'We do now.'\"\n\nIn fact, Jack L. Warner enforced Hunter's contract by banning Dot Records from releasing a follow-up album he had recorded for them. Warner established Warner Bros. Records specifically for Hunter.\n\n\"Warner Bros. Records really started to take off,\" Hunter says. \"Sinatra, the Everly Brothers and many others began recording for Warner.\"\n\nDespite his many talents, Hunter was shy when he first started in show business.\n\n\"My older brother kind of helped me move forward,\" he says. \"He was the one who introduced me to the love of my life - my horses.\"\n\nOn July 9, 1960, \"The Tab Hunter Show\" debuted on NBC, opposite \"The Ed Sullivan Show.\" The show had moderate ratings and was canceled after one season, but it was a huge hit in the United Kingdom, where it ranked as one of the top situation comedies of the year.\n\nIn the 1960s, Hunter starred in a series of spaghetti westerns. In the 1980s, he became a cult star by appearing in \"Lust in the Dust,\" \"Polyester\" and \"Grease 2.\"\n\nHunter had a major role in the 1988 horror film \"Cameron's Closet.\" He also wrote and starred in \"Dark Horse\" in 1992.\n\nOver his career, Hunter starred in more than 40 major films. He prefers some of his roles over others for different reasons.\n\n\"I like 'Damn Yankees,'\" he says. \"It was my first musical and I was the only outsider who wasn't in the original Broadway production.\n\n\"My first opportunity to play a heavy was in the movie 'Gunman's Walk' with Van Heflin. I was in 'That Kind of Woman' with Sophia Loren.\n\n\"The director of that was Sidney Lumet,\" Hunter says. \"That was in the days of live television with great shows like 'Playhouse 90.'\"\n\nDespite his sexual orientation, Hunter was romantically linked with several actresses, including Wood, Reynolds and Loren.\n\n\"We were only kids, but we looked up to Gary Cooper, Marlene Dietrich, Bette Davis,\" he says. \"Nowadays, large corporations own the studios and throw such a huge amount of money into pictures that don't elevate thinking at all.\n\n\"Occasionally, a good picture will come along,\" Hunter says. \"I liked 'A Theory of Everything' last year, and 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' was good. They're not playing down to people.\"\n\nIn 2006, Hunter confirmed he was gay in his autobiography, \"Tab Hunter Confidential: The Making of a Movie Star,\" co-written with Eddie Muller. The hardback became a New York Times best seller, as did the paperback edition in 2007.\n\n\"I really was terribly hesitant about writing a book,\" Hunter says. \"My partner said, 'Somebody's going to do a book about you. You should do it first.'\n\n\"I decided people should get it from the horse's mouth and not some horse's ass after I'm gone. Other people try to put a spin on your life that is not true.\n\n\"After the book became a New York Times best seller, the response was quite amazing,\" he says. \"Allan said he wanted to do a documentary on it.\"\n\nHunter's partner of more than 30 years, Allan Glaser, is the producer of the documentary, \"Tab Hunter Confidential,\" which was directed by Jeffrey Schwarz. It will be screened during the Savannah Film Festival on Oct. 26 at the Lucas Theatre.\n\n\"It's just a wonderful insight into Hollywood,\" Hunter says. \"We're just opening in New York, doing PR on it, then we're working down to Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and Savannah.\n\n\"I'm really looking forward to coming to Savannah. I love the architecture there and always have. Unfortunately, it's going to be a very quick trip.\n\n\"We're going to have a Q-and-A after the documentary,\" he says. \"Unfortunately, we leave the next morning.\"\n\nHunter has some simple advice for young actors and filmmakers.\n\n\"Be thankful for everything that comes along and try to grow,\" he says. \"When you're a young person, you think you're bulletproof.\"\n\nToday, Hunter has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2007, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars was dedicated to him.\n\n\"I'm not an out-there, in-your-face kind of guy,\" Hunter says. \"My mother was German, religious, and a strong, lovely woman.\n\n\"She said, 'nothing for show,' so I ended up in show business. She planted some wonderful seeds in my life.\n\n\"I felt closest to God with a pitchfork in my hand with my horses,\" he says. \"They're very important to me, still to this day, they are.\"\n\nIn spite of his success, Hunter remains modest and humble.\n\n\"I'm not impressed by a lot of things that go on,\" he says. \"People are too quick to be negative on everything.\n\n\"I was brought up to believe you are what you think, so think positive. I don't like the negativity that's going on in the world.\n\n\"I'm an old man now and it's been a fabulous journey,\" Hunter says. \"Hopefully I've developed mentally and physically along the way.\"\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nWhat: Savannah Film Festival screening of \"Tab Hunter Confidential\"\n\nWhen: 5:30 p.m. Oct. 26\n\nWhere: Lucas Theatre, 32 Abercorn St.\n\nCost: $5"
