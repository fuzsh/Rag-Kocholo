        "text": "Studios cashing in on full length movies on TikTok? Sort of. The explosion of accounts cutting full episodes of shows like Ugly Betty, South Park, and most recently Mean Girls into 3-minute parts (known as TikTok Parts)are driving massive influence over viewing choices — and streamers are getting in on the game. And while the average TikTok user might open the app with the intention of scrolling, a stray part of an episode on a for-you-page can spark an hourslong binge of a show over dozens of TikToks. THE UGLY BETTY FACELIFT Ugly Betty was a perfect example of early 2000s television, a popular show filled with a now-in-their-primes cast — but without any of the online engagement of older series like The Office, 30 Rock, or Gilmore Girls. Google Trends shows interest in the series increased by 500 percent, and hashtags related to Ugly Betty have over 5.5 million views on TikTok, with the top 15 most popular edits all made after Aug. 1. A STEP FURTHER W/ MEAN GIRLS On October 3rd, Paramount Studio went all in with Mean Girls on social, giving the entire movie away for free over 23 parts on a custom TikTok emblazoned with the bio “Get In Losers, We’re Going Shopping.” Already considered a promotional grand slam (with a perfectly executed cultural takeover on a date significant to the film) Mean Girls now sits at over 12 billion views. Mean Girls remains available to watch on Paramount+. WHAT DO YOU THINK? At first, short form platforms like TikTok feel at odds with 90-minute movies, but after seeing a clip from Ugly Betty it’s become my go-to guilty pleasure before bed. Maybe next step time I’ll just watch the full episode there….what other franchises should, could, or have taken advantage of this move?

Now the 12-year-old Texan is going to release a movie in theaters nationwide. Ryan’s World the Movie: Titan Universe Adventure will debut on Aug. 16 on more than 2,000 screens across the US. Taking a page from Taylor Swift and her concert movie, Kaji’s parents and their partners at PocketWatch Inc. will release the film without the help of a major studio. At least one of the largest theater chains has agreed to show the movie, said PocketWatch Chief Executive Officer Chris Williams. The movie is part of a trend in which big YouTube channels look to traditional film and TV to sustain their businesses. Universal Pictures is making a movie based on Cocomelon, the No. 1 kids’ property on YouTube. Amazon just ordered a TV show starring MrBeast, the most popular YouTube creator in the world. Releasing a movie without a major studio is a risk. Companies like Warner Bros. and Universal have global distribution networks and marketing teams. The movie will test the mainstream appeal and marketing of Ryan’s World, with more than 61 million subscribers across his accounts. Yet Williams is confident that he can drive viewers to buy tickets. PocketWatch has already used its network to sell toys, mobile games and a TV show, and movie studios already use popular YouTube channels to promote their projects. Kaji is not Swift, but he also doesn’t have to be. Given the movie’s budget, grossing tens of millions of dollars would be a success. Ryan’s World will be the only kids’ movie coming out in a six-week stretch from early August to mid-September. The movie will combine Japanese anime with live-action storytelling, and will star Kaji alongside family members and other YouTubers like magician Dan Rhodes. In the film, Kaji’s sisters Emma and Kate get sucked into a comic-book universe, forcing their brother to jump in and save them. His parents produced the movie alongside PocketWatch’s Albie Hecht, who also serves as director. Hecht described the movie as “a wonderful combination of an Avengers action movie and family reunification.” There are signs Kaji’s popularity may have peaked. Forbes named Kaji the highest-earning YouTuber in the world in 2020. In 2022, he was No. 17 among all social media creators. (He still made an estimated $35 million.) Yet making a movie is a proven strategy. Paramount (nee Viacom) has done it with Paw Patrol, Rugrats and SpongeBob Squarepants. If the movie is successful, it will add to the momentum building for film and TV projects that stem from social media. While social-media personalities have appeared in movies and TV shows – TikTok star Addison Rae was the face of a Netflix movie — few have had success making a TV show or movie based on their YouTube projects.

But it’s easy to understand how #TikTok users get sucked in. For starters, there’s the #community aspect: users can discuss the shows in the comments section, akin to the way #LoveIsland viewers often live-tweet while episodes are airing. “It’s fun to watch something and see funny comments, or see a take on something you hadn't thought of before,” one user explains. Ed agrees, adding that watching on TikTok means “you get to read #comments on stuff which is a bit more fun than just watching on your own.” Another large part of the appeal is the ability to skip through the boring parts of movies and shows. “TikTok usually shows the best bits of the film, so I don't have to sit through the boring bits,” Habiba says. Ed and Don both feel similarly. “Reality TV is full of pointless filler storylines that I just do not care about,” Ed says. Don adds that he “hated” his experience in 2018 of watching Love Island ‘normally’ – that is, on television – and describes watching the show in full as “a waste of time”. This year, Don says he managed to keep up with the series solely by watching snippets online. Some might argue that there’s something more sinister behind this trend, and that it’s further proof that #GenZ ’s brains have been so corrupted by growing up in the age of #instantgratification that we can’t even bear to watch a moment of ‘boring’ TV or film anymore. Others dispute that.' #mediaconsumption #behavioralinsights #digitalculture"
