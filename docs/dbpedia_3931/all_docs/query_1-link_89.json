        "text": "(aka: Wedding Daze)\n\nJP:\n\nPaul:\n\nA strange festival choice, a Farrelly Brothers-like comedy, we both liked Jason Biggs and Isla Fisher (who is destined to become a huge star) in the leads. With some hits and some misses laugh-wise. Even though the old bag next to me laughed throughout the entire film (you know who you are), to the point where she had trouble breathing, it wasn’t that funny, but it did have it’s moments and some decent performances. The crowd went ape-shit which lead to us liking it less because you know… movie audiences are stupid.\n\nGet Flash to see this player."
