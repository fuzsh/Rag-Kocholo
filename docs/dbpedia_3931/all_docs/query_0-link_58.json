        "text": "by Gillian B. Anderson, Music Specialist\n\n“Film music is like a small flame put under the screen to help warm it.” Aaron Copland\n\nDrawing heavily on recollections by the participants as well as on contemporary accounts, this introduction provides a context for the film scores and cue sheets of the silent era in America. Not surprisingly, these musical artifacts are only the tip of the iceberg, remnants of a vast music-making machine that took over thirty years to develop, but only two years to wipe out.\n\nMusic for the Earlier Silent Films\n\nFrom the beginning, Thomas Edison saw the mechanical reproduction of sound and image as inextricably bound. His earliest motion pictures were visual recordings and even came in the same cylinder format as his sound recordings. Some of his moving pictures came with sound recordings, Jack’s Joke (1913), for example. Other manufacturers also released moving pictures with a recording. Poor John and Waiting at the Church (Belcher and Waterson, 1907) featured the vaudevillian, Vesta Victoria, singing the songs “Poor John” and “Waiting at the Church.” However, the successful presentation of a mechanically produced, synchronized sound track and image took over thirty years to develop—the span of the silent film era. In the meantime live music from vaudeville, ballet, symphony, and opera accompanied silent films, and the earliest days of silent movies saw a variety of combinations of music and image.\n\nOne combination resulted from films about musical works. For example, the French film Mozart’s Last Requiem (Gaumont, 1909) described—in ten minutes—the composition of Mozart’s final, unfinished work. Mendelssohn’s Spring Song (Imp, 1910) purportedly told the story of Mendelssohn’s composition of that work.\n\nAnother combination of music and image resulted from films that illustrated the stories in popular songs. For example, Mother (World, 1914) dramatized the temperance song, “Where Is My Wandering Boy Tonight.” Edison released the picture songs Love and War and The Astor Tramp, which used several songs in sequence as well as stereopticon slides and reading matter. His catalog of 1906 announced:\n\nWe have at last succeeded in perfectly synchronizing music and moving pictures. The following scenes are very carefully chosen to fit the words and the songs, which have been especially composed for these pictures… [Love and War] presents this beautiful song pictures in six scenes, each of which has a separate song, making the entire series a complete and effective novelty.\n\nThe musical accompaniment was a soloist, a quartet, or an orchestra.\n\nThe Astor Tramp was presented with or without music, the explanatory text being spoken or sung. Continuing the same tradition, but much later in the silent film era, popular songs on slides or films were accompanied by a theater organist and the audience. Max Fleischer’s My Old Kentucky Home (Inkwell, 1926), for example, was an animated, follow-the-bouncing-ball film.\n\nAs the presentation of silent films became more set, two general styles of accompaniment became perceptible: simple and elaborate. They depended on the financial resources of each theater or theater chain, and these resources affected every aspect of film music presentation from synchronization to organ repair. Obviously, Edison had been concerned with a close synchronization of sound and image. However, such synchronization was hard to achieve, and as time went on, the numbers of theaters and performers involved in silent film presentation made it even more unlikely. In the classiest movie houses with the biggest staffs or in the large theater chains, close synchronization appears to have been both possible and practiced. In the smaller, less elaborate houses it probably was not.\n\nOrchestral forces had been available for silent film accompaniment since the moving pictures were first presented in vaudeville theaters. However, D. W. Griffith’s presentation of The Birth of a Nation (1914) with a full symphony orchestra playing a score that was extremely closely synchronized and based on the operatic compositional practice of leitmotifs was a watershed. Large orchestras became a necessity in fancy movie palaces.\n\nHollywood’s Aspiration to the Ultimate in Theatrical Grandeur\n\nToday, we associate star quality and dazzling effects with motion pictures. In the early days of film, however, the world of opera and opera singers occupied this position. Thomas Edison in his first printed statement about his new invention predicted that it would spread opera far and wide. In 1904 he released a twenty-two-minute version of Richard Wagner’s four-hour opera, Parsifal. A slide show and lecture tied the eight filmed highlights together. A piano score was available for the accompaniment. Edison also distributed a shorter version of Friedrich von Flotow’s opera, Martha.\n\nThis film shows a quartette of well-known opera singers acting and singing their parts in this ever popular opera. The subjects are taken with the greatest care and the films manufactured by the Edison Manufacturing Company. Managers can arrange to produce this exhibition throughout the country, and can obtain a quartette of church singers to remain behind the scenes and sing the parts and produce a remarkably fine entertainment, besides giving a local interest to the same by utilizing local talent. If it is desired to do so, however, the quartette can be engaged to travel with the exhibition.\n\nEdison was not the only filmmaker with operatic aspirations. In 1916 Thomas Dixon’s The Fall of a Nation, with its score by Victor Herbert, was advertised as the first grand opera cinema.\n\nIn 1915, Hollywood enjoyed one of its first encounters with the real world of opera singers. Agnes DeMille, niece of Cecil B. DeMille as well as a great choreographer in her own right, noted the results:\n\nOur second summer Uncle Cecil brought [Geraldine] Farrar to Hollywood to play Carmen and I had my first model to aspire to… Grand Opera meant far more in those days than it does now or possibly ever will again. It represented the ultimate in theatrical grandeur, honor, permanence and splendor and Farrar was among its most dazzling names… She visited…first on a Sunday morning and we were all on hand, the executives and their families…I was enthralled…The electricians, the carpenters, the cowboys also adored her. Everyone at the studio from executive to assistant prop-boy, spoke of her as “Our Gerry”…\n\nOnce every summer she came to dinner at our house. I was not permitted, of course, to eat with her, but very nearly ran a temperature at the prospect of having her under our roof.\n\nAfter dinner there was music. Farrar…played the piano…brilliantly, improvising as she went, talking and laughing…The sound of the music and the laughter woke my sister and me and we crept in our nightgowns to the stairs and sat there with faces pressed against the ballustrade, shivering at the glory below.\n\nIn 1915 Hollywood regarded a great opera singer as it regards a movie star today. Clearly, Hollywood aspired to opera’s position, to use DeMille’s words, “the ultimate in theatrical grandeur…and splendor,” and music was used to realize this aspiration.\n\nOrdinary and Deluxe Film Presentations\n\nRarely since the silent film era ended have film images and music shared equal prominence and worked as successfully together. Many accompaniments for sound films declare their role in the titles found on copyright deposits of the scores: “Background Musical Score for…” Before the silent film era ended, however, music was often in the foreground of an audience’s attention. The following eloquent account by Jean Paul Sartre attests to this.\n\nOn rainy days, Anne Marie would ask me what I felt like doing. We would hesitate for a long time between the circus, the Chatelet, the Electric House, and the Grevin Museum. At the last moment, with calculated casualness, we would decide to go to the movies… The show had begun. We would stumblingly follow the usherette. I would feel I was doing something clandestine. Above our heads, a shaft of light crossed the hall; one could see dust and vapor dancing in it. A piano whinnied away…\n\nAbove all, I liked the incurable muteness of my heroes. But no, they weren’t mute, since they knew how to make themselves understood. We communicated by means of music; it was the sound of their inner life. Persecuted innocence did better than merely show or speak of suffering: it permeated me with its pain by means of the melody that issued from it. I would read the conversations, but I heard the hope and bitterness; I would perceive by ear the proud grief that remains silent. I was compromised; the young widow who wept on the screen was not I, and yet she and I had only one soul:\n\nChopin’s funeral march; no more was needed for her tears to wet my eyes. I felt I was a prophet without being able to foresee anything: even before the traitor betrayed, his crime entered me; when all seemed peaceful in the castle, sinister chords exposed the murderer’s presence. How happy were those cowboys, those musketeers, those detectives; their future was there, in that premonitory music, and governed the present. An unbroken song blended with their lives, led them on to victory or death by moving toward its own end. They were expected: by the girl in danger, by the general, by the traitor lurking in the forest, by the friend who was tied up near a powder-keg and who sadly watched the flame run along the fuse. The course of that flame, the virgin’s desperate struggle against her abductor, the hero’s gallop across the plain, the interlacing of all those images, of all those speeds, and, beneath it all, the demonic movement of the “Race to the Abyss,” an orchestral selection taken from the Damnation of Faust and adapted for the piano, all of this was one and the same: it was Destiny. The hero dismounted, put out the fuse, the traitor sprang at him, a duel with knives began; but the accidents of the duel likewise partook of the rigor of the musical development; they were fake accidents which ill concealed the universal order. What joy when the last knife stroke coincided with the last chord! I was utterly content, I had found the world in which I wanted to live, I touched the absolute. What an uneasy feeling when the lights went on: I had been wracked with love for the characters and they had disappeared, carrying their world with them. I had felt their victory in my bones; yet it was theirs and not mine. In the street I found myself superfluous.\n\nSartre’s account describes an ordinary silent film presentation—piano and film, what most people still think of as the only form of musical accompaniment for silent films. However, between 1894 and 1929 the accompanying forces ranged from piano or organ to piano, violin and drums to twenty-two- to seventy-piece orchestras, and the relationship between film image and music ranged from entirely improvisational to minutely synchronized and orchestrated. The differences between the ordinary and deluxe presentations are described in an article entitled “South, South, South” published in 1926:\n\nWe no longer go to see movin’ pictures. We now see Presentations Just like New York or Dodge City. There is a difference… Movin’ Pitchers mean an enclosure with or without a roof, seats or benches, a booth accommodating a youth called an “operator” and one or more devices that click like a roomful of telegraph instruments and from whence issue fitful shadows which appear on a white cotton sheet as horsemen riding frantically up the sides of canyons and shooting in the air with several pistols. At times the sheet becomes a blank and blinding white area while the operator joins a ruptured fillum. A custard comedy is included in the program which is followed by two cracked slides extolling the cooling qualities of the ice cream at the Elite Drug Store and the wearing qualities of shoes obtained at Pinchem’s Boot Shoppe. During the picture Miss Iva Rea Key plays Ben Hur’s Chariot Race by E. T Paull and other selections in keeping with the sentiment and action of the picture. She does this seven hours a day on a piano or if in towns as large as Butte, on a Unit Orchestra [theater organ], Largest in the State, cost $75,000.\n\nThis account, while violating the letter, no doubt is true to the spirit of most performances in small movie theaters. The account goes on to describe how deluxe theaters worked by comparison.\n\nA Presentation is divided into Units which are reclassified as DeLuxe Shows and just shows. Here also is a difference. The plain show uses only the lesser talent at the organ while the orchestra lolls in the Green Room, while at stated intervals a DeLuxe performance is given which is supposed to be the peak of the entertainment. The Chief Organist is seated at the Organ, the right foot planted on the Grand Crescendo Pedal, the leader’s baton (pronounced battongh) is poised aloft—and the Overture (unit No. 1) is under way. This is ended with a storm of applause, the Chief Conductor bows, retires, and the assistant conductor takes charge during the News Reel which is unit No. 2. After the President has thrown the first baseball and all the battleships are launched, we come to Unit No. 3. This is the Organ Novelty. A spotlight is turned on the Chief Organist, a slide is thrown on the screen announcing the name and the featured music number, which “Why don’t you kiss me when I pucker my lips,” in six slides and two choruses played on the Sleigh-bells, Tibia, and Vox Humana.\n\nThe slides are beautifully colored cartoons of the Mutt and Jeff type with a portion of the poem on each.\n\nWe now come to Unit No. 4, a piece de resistance including some wild acrobatic dancing and still wilder singing, and always a ballet dancer and her partner. Her regulation costume seems to be some beads, quantities of white powder, and what is known among African Explorers as a breach clout. We are now treading dangerous ground and will pass on to Unit No. 5 which is the Feature Picture costing $1,000,000 to produce and takes 30 minutes to introduce the cast, directors, writers, fillum cutters, and 300 others vitally concerned with the production or the Super-Special.\n\nThere is not much shooting. Probably only once. This is in the big scene and is carefully cued by the drummer and followed by quivering silence. We hasten now to say that somebody is clinched in somebody else’s arms at the end and we reach the conclusion of a Presentation.\n\nHugo Riesenfeld’s presentations at two of the largest theaters in New York, the Rialto and Rivoli, followed the deluxe pattern outlined in this account. On May 2, 1920, for each of the four shows the overture was Goldmark’s Sakuntala. The first picture was Shackleton’s South Polar Expedition. It was followed by a violin solo, Stahl’s Indian Beauty. The next picture was a current film news pictorial. Then came Meyerbeer’s “O paradiso” for tenor solo, followed by the feature film, The Dancin’ Fool (Wood, 1920), and a comedy. The program concluded with an organ solo, Theodore Dubois’s Toccata.\n\nIn several of the deluxe theaters the show business went well beyond the entr’actes and musical accompaniments. Here is an account of the presentation of The Thief of Bagdad (Fairbanks, 1924):\n\nOnce more that worthy showman Mr. Sid Grauman has proved his genius in the presentation of this most remarkable picture at his Hollywood Theater. From the first step into the large court of the theater Bagdad atmosphere is rampant, so to speak. Life size paper elephants stand here and there swinging their bulky ears and emitting strange noises, probably begging for the succulent tuber which the visitor is forbidden to offer. Veiled sheikesses are mounted on the gaily decorated howdahs and others entertain with palmistry or that “Wish it was over” look. The oriental flutist and his tom tom assistant produce atmospheric music including the popular oriental ballad “It ain’t goin’ to rain no more” in their scant repertoire. The interior of the theater has been practically rebuilt and one does not have to even bother his imagination to find himself in an oriental city looking out on a Bagdad street, for here Mr. Grauman has introduced another innovation—the curtain is up, the natives are strolling along the street, and one hears a hidden flutist long before the prologue is presented.\n\nThe somewhat lengthy prologue is splendidly staged and the singing and dancing in the scene were very entertaining and most commendable.\n\nFirst class theaters generally had more seats (the Roxy in New York had 6,214), charged higher prices for admission, and had larger orchestras and better organs. The second and third class houses were small, charged lower prices, showed shortened versions of some films, had smaller (or no) orchestras, smaller organs, more slapstick comedies, and often got the films long after their premieres.\n\nThe Schedule and Working Conditions in Deluxe Movie Theaters\n\nTheaters, whether deluxe or ordinary, would open at noon and close at midnight. In the early 1920s there might have been four shows a day, seven days a week. Toward the end of the era, there were more likely to be two shows. In deluxe houses the same feature film might run for months, as happened in 1923, for example, with the film The Covered Wagon (Famous Players Lasky, 1923). In the bigger houses, however, the shows probably changed twice a week on average. In the smaller theaters they changed every day! And remember that by the word show we mean the five- to eight-unit program that was repeated four times each day. In 1927 some of the Broadway theaters instituted a midnight show as well.\n\nThe pit orchestras in 1929 at the best houses cost between $3,000 and $10,000 a week. At the Roxy Theater the bill was between $15,000 and $20,000 a week. The average first class house had an orchestra of between twenty and eighty players plus organ. The small orchestras consisted of six violins, two violas, two cellos, one bass, flute, oboe, clarinet, two horns, two trumpets, one trombone, drums, and piano. The large orchestras had full woodwind and brass sections, larger numbers of strings, harp, and percussion, and no piano.\n\nIn 1920 the salaries of theater organists ranged from $1.50 to $2.50 an hour for from thirty to fifty hours of work a week. In 1921 in New York all the movie palace musicians went on strike when the managers attempted to reduce their salaries to $56 a week, a 20 percent reduction. All the musicians were replaced. Only three of the six organists were rehired after the strike. By 1926 the musicians in the Broadway houses were earning $83 a week, in the vaudeville houses $63 a week. It was said that one of the best New York theater organists had been offered $1,000 a week to play on the West Coast, but the average salary by 1929 was $75 to $125 a week. By that time only the famous Mr. and Mrs. Jesse Crawford, the organ playing team, commanded $500 to $1,000 a week.\n\nIn 1922 Hugo Riesenfeld estimated that five hundred moving picture theaters had full orchestras. The Rialto and Rivoli orchestras in New York each had forty-five players. Each theater had two organists. There were five conductors. In 1920, Riesenfeld’s music budget for these two theaters and the Criterion Theater was $500,000. He estimated (perhaps on the high side) that five million people a year saw their productions. The public paid ten to fifty cents for admission and over a dollar for deluxe presentations of special feature films like The Thief of Bagdad.\n\nObviously, the instrumentalists at the Rialto and Rivoli could not play constantly for twelve hours a day. The schedule started at noon with two hours and ten minutes of solo organ. A five-minute break was followed by two hours of orchestra with organ. A fifteen-minute break was followed by organ alone for two hours. A thirty-minute break was followed by three hours of orchestra and organ followed by one and a half hours of organ alone. Additionally, during the orchestral periods the organ frequently gave the instrumentalists a fifteen- to thirty-minute break.\n\nThis schedule was followed regardless of what was on the screen, so it was common for the orchestra to stop in the middle of a film and for the organ to take up alone. The switchover was disconcerting unless handled very carefully, which it frequently was not. No amount of care would allow a smooth transition between organ and orchestra if the organ had not been voiced properly. By 1921 the organ at the Rialto had been adjusted, but The American Organist reported that formerly it had been “10 feet out of tune” and that the woodwind section had turned purple in the face every time the organist had played the woodwind stops.\n\nIt is not surprising that the six hours a day, seven days a week use caused the middle portions of the organ manuals at the Rialto to wear out and need replacement. It was estimated that in six months the average theater organ got as much use as a church organ did in twenty years.\n\nTheater Organs and Organists\n\nDuring the First World War, droves of people used to go to the Rialto Theater in New York “just to hear and see Hugo Riesenfeld conduct a fine overture…the very best music for 50 cents a seat. This beat Carnegie Hall…” As the silent film era progressed the unit orchestra or theater organ played an increasingly greater role in silent film accompaniment. Initially, the theaters with full orchestras employed church style pipe organs, known as “straight” organs, but eventually these organs were replaced by the dramatically more flexible Wurlitzer, Kimball, Morton, Moeller, and other makes of theater or “unit” organs.\n\nOne difference between the two types of organ involved the unit organ’s use of electrical circuitry to reuse part of a rank of pipes instead of adding another rank of pipes of the same size. They frequently used a higher wind pressure, fewer ranks of pipes, and more percussion stops than comparable straight or church organs. The heavily tremulated wind gave them their characteristic sound. The changeover from straight to unit organs was accompanied by a furious debate about the merits of unit versus straight organs.\n\nWhere the regular organ is dignified, sonorous, appealing, reverent, the theater organ shouts vengeance, frantically claws the enemy, wails with impassioned grief, screams with victory, sobs thickly with love, moans with remorse, cries like a baby, giggles like a young girl, does a Charleston, barks like a dog, and finally shoots itself with a bass drum.\n\nAn increased reliance on the unit organ also brought several new musical developments, one of which was the original organ novelty. Before or between the films, the organist would accompany illustrated slides with a selection of popular tunes and would invite the audience to sing along. Audiences loved the sing-alongs, which after the First World War spread from the West Coast all over the United States. In addition, many players of the unit organ film accompaniments drew more on popular songs and dance music than on the classical repertory. Their musical style was more generally accessible and associated with vaudeville. Many Easterners deplored these developments, the taste of West Coast theater organists, and the unit organ:\n\nThe tones of this organ were…the kind you hear in the merry-go-round affair that makes you think the pipes must be screwed into the wind chest to keep them from blowing out. The whole sound a riot of immodest vulgarity that was an absolute shock to the senses and that made it impossible to fix your attention on the picture.\n\nWestern organists on the other hand accused the Easterners of elitist snobbery.\n\nSome day, before long, there will be organized in the grand and glorious West from where I came a society of theater organists who will stand for the best in organs, music for the people and a helping hand instead of suppression such as this bunch of insects of New York City who are taking up banners under that magic word Society of Theater Organists—nice ladies all of you must be.\n\nEven theaters which had relied on the ubiquitous piano (or piano, drum set, and occasional violinist) began to purchase organs and feature an organ accompaniment. As a result, the demand for trained theater organists exceeded the supply. A school for theater organists was started in Chicago in 1921; later one opened in Boston and two in New York. In the twenties in the deluxe theaters the organs and the orchestras were placed on separate lifts which rose and fell for dramatic effect.\n\nThe impact of the first Organ solo presentation I heard [Jesse Crawford] play there [New York Paramount Theatre in Times Square] over 40 years ago is indelibly imprinted on my memory. I had been brought up in a small Canadian town, and in January 1929 I went to New York to take a six month electrical course. The bright lights of Broadway fascinated me, but my first visit to the Paramount was without doubt one of my life’s most memorable events. The lofty lobby with its beautiful staircase and the marble pillars was crowded, but I pushed on through to a seat in the center of the orchestra section. The picture had just finished, when from the left side of the orchestra pit rose a gorgeous ivory and gold Organ console, illuminated by brilliant arc spots. At the massive console, on the Howard seat, was the one and only Jesse Crawford. It seemed that I was completely surrounded by the most beautiful music. He took over the same musical number with which the picture had just finished, but the contrast in the tone quality was almost unbelievable. The gorgeous sound of this the greatest of all the Wurlitzers, in the full stereo of these shallow chambers, a near perfect acoustical environment, made the puny sounds of the screen characteristic of that period seem like a collection of tin cans by comparison.\n\nOrganists like Iris Vining (San Francisco) improvised an accompaniment to each picture; others like Jesse Crawford played original scores or scores compiled from popular songs, dance tunes, and the light and serious classics. They played their accompaniments—whether improvisational or written out—before, during and after the pictures. C. Roy Carter of Los Angeles, California made the following claim:\n\nThe tremendous popularity of the Pipe Organ in the Moving-Picture Theatre has undoubtedly put this wonderful instrument in the first place to stay as the most perfect accompaniment to the Silent Drama. Its superiority over the orchestra for this means is undisputed, not only because of the Organs greater flexibility and range of tonal expression but because under the control of an artist it can do all and much more than a large orchestra, greatly surpassing it in power and grandeur and even variety of tone.\n\nCarter went on to describe how to imitate the following effects on the organ: “The Snore, Laughter, Yell or Scream, The Kiss, R.R. Train, Aeroplane, Thunder and Rain Storm, Steam Whistle, Policeman’s or Other Shrill Whistle, Prize-Fight, Gong, Dog Bark, Dog Yelp, Cat Meow, Lion Roar, Cow’s Moo, Rooster Crow, Pig Grunt, Cuckoo, Bag Pipes, Music Box, Banjo, Hand Organ, Accordion-Harmonica, Telegraph-Typewriter.”\n\nBy 1924 many organists from the deluxe theaters were featured regularly on the radio. After 1929, some theater organists continued as accompanists for radio.\n\nThe Music Director in Deluxe Theaters—Hugo Riesenfeld\n\nDuring the silent film era the music director of a theater played an important role in determining the quality of the film accompaniment. In the deluxe theaters the music director controlled a large staff of musicians. Several conductors and accompanists helped with the selection of music as well as with its performance. In the smaller theaters the music director might be the only musician, either an organist or a pianist. Those that had the time controlled the selection of music and its execution, particularly its volume and synchronization. Hugo Riesenfeld described the process of musical selection in his deluxe theaters:\n\nI resort mainly for themes to the songs of the period of the particular film for which I am arranging the score. For instance, with the Rough Riders, I have taken “Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight,” “Break the News to Mother,” “Good-Bye Dolly Gray,” and “The Blue and The Gray,” as themes. Some of these, to be sure, were old before the [Spanish-American] war, but the others sprang into popularity during it… When arranging a certain score, I usually divide the film into sections according to moods. For instance, sentimental, pastoral, dramatic, heavy…ominous, or—even every day life. Then I have hundreds of compositions representative of the pastoral, the dramatic, etc. My course is to go through these and eliminate. My leading themes come in between these miscellaneous selections and may be as elaborate or as simple as the action requires. Once, perhaps, they are heroic; again sentimental, then allegro—all sorts of variations of the same theme…\n\nIn this very general account Riesenfeld alludes to the theme songs associated with silent film accompaniments. Sometimes these songs were not just “of the period of the particular film” but original compositions. They became quite popular, just as they do today, and were used to sell the picture (although sometimes the picture sold them). “Charmaine” from What Price Glory (Fox, 1926) and “Diane” from 7th Heaven (Fox, 1927) sold over a million copies. “Ramona” was credited with contributing to Ramona’s (Inspiration Pictures, 1928) $1 million gross. The sheet music covers of the theme songs often featured photographs of the actors or stills from the movies themselves.\n\nRiesenfeld’s account is not very specific about either theme songs or what went into the synchronization of music and movies. T. Scott Buhrman, editor of The American Organist, describes Riesenfeld’s selection and synchronization procedures in far more detail:\n\nTo visit a projection room during the musical scoring of a film is an interesting experience. At one end of a twelve by thirty-foot room is a screen possibly six feet square; in the wall at the opposite end are two holes for the machines and two for the operators to peep through or stick their heads through for an occasional conference with the director: directly under these holes are half a dozen comfortable wicker chairs with a long table-like bench conveniently in front and a swinging phone within grabbing distance; to the right is an upright piano; around the walls are cabinets of piano scores and violin scores all carefully assorted under proper heads, “love scenes,” “home scenes,” “waltzes,” “Russian,” “Overtures,” “suites,” “military marches,” etc., ad infinitum; and in the ceiling is an electric light of excellent power which keeps going full force through the entire operation.\n\n“There are millions of ways,” says Hugo Riesenfeld, who scores all the pictures of the Rialto, Rivoli, and Criterion programs, “of selecting music to serve as accompaniment for a picture, but there are only two ways that a good musician would choose. One is to select beautiful music that is appropriate for the scenes of the picture, and the good musician, inexperienced in motion picture presentation would undoubtedly follow this course. The second course, and the one that requires the hardest work, is to select music such as would be chosen in the first mentioned way, but with an ear to subjugation. There may be half a hundred waltzes that would go prettily with certain scenes, but the experienced scorer of motion pictures will, after listening to the piece, know whether it is too striking—or even too beautiful.” And all through the few hours when I had the privilege of observing the scoring process under Mr. Riesenfeld’s magic hand, I witnessed this “subjugation” in actual fact. “Not so fast,” “Slower, please,” “Oh, not so fast,” “Take it this way,” and the director would hum the tune or whistle it or beat it out on the table with his thumb; in every case the music was “toned down,” “subjugated” to the picture. Had it not been done I imagine the effect would have been one of frivolity, if not completely grotesque; but subjugated in this way, and ultimately in many other ways of which only Hugo Riesenfeld can give the clue, music of the most attractive kind—attractive to musicians—lends itself admirably to the screen.\n\nThe success of the Riesenfeld productions is not only a matter of the films selected; I question if the films have even fifty per cent of the credit. In fact I know of one case where Mr. Riesenfeld scored a picture, after cutting up the film and showing it as he wanted instead of as the producers photographed it, with success, while the same picture in its original form under the management of other producers in other houses fell a failure.\n\nAt half after ten on a Monday night, when most people were beginning to seal up their day as well done and turn their thoughts to hot or cold showers according to taste, and feather pillows, I got safely by the guards (an iron gate that works with difficulty) and climbed two flights of stairs at Broadway and 42nd Street. In the director’s private projection room were already gathered the operators, conductors, pianist, and librarian, with Mr. Riesenfeld seated in his comfortable chair ready to “make” another Riesenfeld production. Mr. Riesenfeld had already seen the picture once, of course, so he began his search for music of a certain well defined type. Piece after piece (only a little of each, of course) was played on the piano as this or that conductor would pick out one as a suggestion, and all that could be gotten out of Mr. Riesenfeld was “No,” “Not that,” “No, that won’t do,” “Oh, no, not that”—and all the while the cameras were waiting to click their first inch of the film, not a picture as yet having gone to the screen; the director had his head stuck deep in a folio of possibly two hundred selections of a given type, every one of which he glanced through in his search for the “right” one. Finally it was found; and what a relief. “Slower; oh, not so fast,” then “Ah, that’s it, that’s it,” and the ready amanuensis jotted down a few abbreviations to show that when the picture was ready to begin the music would be this piece, and that so much of it would be used. A mark was put lightly on the score. All that work for about sixty seconds’ worth of music! To the question, “What is Hugo Riesenfeld?” we might answer, “Infinite capacity for taking pains.” The piece, before being laid aside, was again played on the piano at proper tempo, that is at Mr. Riesenfeld’s own tempo; the director pushed the button, the picture announcement began, and I almost thought I was going to see a free picture show at this time. But no, I read some words announcing the title of the picture, and some other words telling who photographed it, and still more words advising me all about the people who acted in it; and then the fatal button was pressed and the “show” stopped. Then the search for music began all over again. Soon something was tried which pleased Director Riesenfeld and as the pianist started to play it again the button was pressed and the picture resumed its course just where it left off. That is, resumed it for another two seconds till the emotions of the screen drama changed and with it changed the emotions of this highly-strung bit of human machinery who controlled the fatal button—and the picture went dead again till some new bit of music could be found to suit the new emotions… And this only tells a small part of the story; it forgets all about the cuts, the arrangements, the slides and glides and skips and hops through all musicdom in order to make these things go together in a proper sequence of keys as one piece.\n\nAfter little snatches of the film are thus projected and music fitted intimately with the moods of each, with proper record made of each separate bit of film and the music corresponding with it, Mr. Riesenfeld takes the music under his wing and spends laborious hours over it, marking, timing, cutting, trimming, fitting and preparing it to time rightly with the film. When this is done and the librarians and orchestrators have arranged and written such things as are needed for the film, the film itself is taken in hand for revision. Projection machines can be made to run at variable speeds to suit the occasion, and these speeds can be arbitrarily set by a projector without interfering in any way with the picture; I doubt if any but a very skilled man would be able to detect the many changes Mr. Riesenfeld must get from his operators. Many times the titles and joints in the film are deleted to just the right amount to make the film time exactly with the music, while at other times, the speed accomplishes the result. Thus after the music is first fitted to the picture, the picture is then fitted exactly to the music.\n\nRiesenfeld’s library consisted of 6,000 orchestral scores and thousands of pieces of unorchestrated music. In the scoring of the film Everywoman (Paramount, 1919) he and his four conductors “worked four full hours merely on the selection of music for one of the eight reels, one eighth of the film” At the peak of the silent film era, the Loew’s Theater chain employed six hundred orchestral musicians and two hundred organists of which almost a hundred organists were in New York City. Their music library alone consisted of 50,000 scores, and their music department sent out 167 compiled scores with parts per week.\n\nMusical Repertory in the Deluxe Movie Palaces\n\nIn addition to the accompaniments for the films, deluxe theaters presented every kind of music imaginable before and between the films. A list follows of the orchestral overtures conducted by Hugo Riesenfeld between 1918 and 1921. They were played at the beginning of each of the four shows, seven days a week, either by the orchestra, the organ, or both.\n\nOrchestral Overtures Played at the Rialto Theater New York, 1918-July 1921 Title Date Von Suppe—Pique Dame January 6, 1918 Wagner—Lohengrin January 13 Goldmark—Queen of Sheba January 20 Wagner—Tannhaeuser January 27 Liszt—Symphonic Poem No. 3 February 3 Rimsky-Korsakov—Capriccio Espagnol February 10 Goldmark—In the Spring February 24 Tchaikowsky—Capriccio Italien March 3 Tchaikowsky—Romeo and Juliet April 7 Verdi—Aida April 21 Liszt—Mazeppa April 28 Rimsky-Korsakov—Semiramide May 5 Rimsky-Korsakov—Scheherazade May 19 Verdi—Sicilian Vespers May 26 Massenet—Manon June 23 Tchaikowsky—Symphony No. 4 (movements 2, 4) August 4 Verdi—Rigoletto August 11 Tchaikowsky—Solonelle [1812] September 8 Dvorak—New World Symphony (movement 2, finale) September 15 Rimsky-Korsakov—Capriccio Espagnol October 6 Tchaikowsky—Pathetique finale October 13 Rossini—William Tell October 20 Liszt—Second Rhapsody October 27 Liszt—Sixth Rhapsody December 1 Saint-Saëns—Danse Macabre December 8 Goldmark—Sakuntala December 15 Beethoven—Leonora No. 3 January 19, 1919 Liszt—First Rhapsody January 26 Tchaikowsky—March Slav February 9 Sibelius—Finlandia February 16 Gounod—Faust February 23 Thomas—Mignon March 2 Liszt—Les Preludes April 6 Herbert—Natoma April 13 Liszt—Second Rhapsody April 20 Balfe—Bohemian Girl May 4 Tchaikowsky—Romeo and Juliet May 18 Weber—Euryanthe June 1 Mendelssohn—Midsummer Night’s Dream June 15 Liszt—Thirteenth Rhapsody July 6 Massenet—Manon July 13 Weber—Freischuetz August 3 Verdi—Aida August 10 Saint-Saëns—Spinning Wheel {Le Rouet d’Omphale] August 17 Liszt—Ideale August 31 Wagner—Tannhauser September 21 Tchaikowsky—1812 Overture September 28 Rossini—William Tell October 5 Goldmark—Sakuntala October 12 Verdi—La Traviata October 19 Liszt—Sixth Rhapsody November 16 Tchaikowsky—March Slav November 23 Weber—Oberon November 30 Liszt—In Vienna December 14 Liszt—First Rhapsody December 28 Wagner—Rienzi January 4, 1920 Dvorak—Carneval February 15 Mascagni—Hymn to Sun March 14 Liszt—Les Preludes April 11 Liszt—Sixth Rhapsody April 18 Mendelssohn—Ruy Blas April 25 Tchaikowsky—Capriccio Italien May 1 Liszt—Second Rhapsody May 23 Wagner --Tristan June 6 Massenet-Phaedre June 20 Thomas --Mignon June 27 Mendelssohn—Midsummer Night’s Dream July 4 Rimsky-Korsakov—Scheherazade July 11 Massenet—Manon July 18 Goldmark—Queen of Sheba August 29 Liszt—Fourth Rhapsody September 5 Verdi—Aida September 12 Rossini—William Tell September 19 Wagner—Tannhauser October 3 Weber—Euryanthe October 10 Tchaikowsky—March Slav October 17 Mortimer Wilson—New Orleans\n\n(A $500 first prize overture composed by Mr. Wilson\n\nfor the Hugo Riesenfeld competition,\n\nconducted by Mr. Wilson\n\nat the first presentation of this week) [October 24?] Wagner—Lohengrin October 31 Goldmark—Sakuntala November 7 Liszt—Thirteenth Rhapsody November 28 Wagner—Die Meistersinger December 5 Wagner—Rienzi January 2, 1921 Elgar—Pomp and Circumstance February 6 Tchaikowsky—1812 Overture February 13 Liszt—Les Preludes February 20 Weber—Freischuetz February 27 Liszt—First Rhapsody March 20 Liszt—Ideale March 27 Rossini—Barber of Seville April 3 von Suppé—Poet and Peasant April 10 Liszt—Sixth Rhapsody April 17 Liszt—Second Rhapsody May 29 Gounod—Faust June 19 Massenet-Phèdre June 26 Auber—Masaniello July 10 Verdi—La Forza del Destino July 17 Massenet—Manon July 24 Von Suppé—Beautiful Galatea July 31\n\nIn addition to these overtures, in 1920 Riesenfeld presented fifteen-minute operatic selections. At other times there were xylophone novelties, barber shop quartets, Miss Ruth Brewer playing fourteen instruments, Ben Bernie and his jazz band in 1925 at the Rialto for a half-hour entertainment, and Eddie Elkins’ jazz band in 1926. There was a piano trio (three pianists) playing Rimsky-Korsakoff”s Song of India and Ray Henderson’s Georgette. Sometimes drummer Max H. Manne would be the featured soloist; sometimes it would be a harmonica player.\n\nOn one occasion a pianist, Carlo Marx, was featured playing Liszt’s Concerto in E Flat which the revie wer reported was “applauded more heartily than any of the more or less elaborate opera excerpts have been for many months.” Percy Grainger played and sold Duo-Art pianos for a week at the Capitol Theater in 1921. On another occasion, in 1925, Hugo Riesenfeld had a string quartet play on rare instruments for a week during a New York convention of violin makers.\n\nSome of the most famous musical interludes played between films were Riesenfeld’s own arrangements of what he called “Classical Jazz.” For the program of March 26, 1923,\n\nRiesenfeld staged a “Classical Jazz” performance that showed the close connection of Jazz with what is known popularly as “the classics”--…Mr. Riesenfeld dug up four good melodies from Chopin, Gounod, and Puccini, had his orchestra play them as scored by “legitimate” musicians, and then had the orchestra play Jazz selections which were apparently built wholesale on them.\n\nThese performances were often elaborately staged and lighted. The following is another account from 1923:\n\nOne of the players…was playing a sweet little solo tune accompanied by the rest of the orchestra, and he was required to stand while playing, the spot light being thrown on his musicianly form. When he finished, the spot-light went out and he sat down; but then the composer began playing with the theme the soloist had just finished, treating it contrapuntally and chasing snatches of it hither and thither among the various instruments and groups of instruments; as each player or group of players got the melody or snatch to play, they bobbed up double quick, played their snatch, the spot-light picked them up with a shot and went out as they finished the snatch and sat down; the whole thing going like lightning, with players bobbing up all around, and spot-lights shooting out like fire-flies, brought down the house with a roar.\n\nThe Failings of Films and Accompanists\n\nTheater musicians could change the film directors’ intentions by varying the speed of the projectors, by reorganizing the films’ sequences or by deleting whole scenes. More frequently, however, through their choice of the entr’actes and movie accompaniments photoplayers could reinforce or contradict intended dramatic context, emotional effects, film rhythms, scenic structure, and the overall pacing of films. Their accompaniments could simulate speech patterns, accents, calls and responses, and could move people and conjure up associations; in other words, they could become an almost living, independent character commenting on the pantomimed drama on the screen. At their best, film accompaniments could intensify the effects and reinforce the inherent structures of a good film. For the average film, however, the desired effect for music was different, according to an article in The Metronome.\n\nWhat the enthusiastic protagonists of musical interpretation of motion pictures persist in overlooking really is the crux of the whole situation. Motion picture masterpieces are exceedingly rare, while the lurid “hoakum” of the picture screen is plastered in a thick and viscid layer over a large part of the habitable globe. It is right here that the lavish application of music truly justifies itself—as an anaesthetic. At the present stage of enlightenment of motion picture patrons, the experienced picture showman does not dream of opening his program until the audience has been rendered insensible to pain. He can’t very well chloroform his paying patrons, so he employs the seductive, and equally efficacious, anaesthetic know as music. By the time the screen reveals the first sticky close-up of the brave and noble-minded hero, Hercules Hoakum, and of our very own precious sweet and tearful heroine, Lotta Bunk, the audience has been filled so full of the Bach-Gounod Ave Maria or In the Gloaming that it actually would enjoy an operation for appendicitis where it sits. From this on, comparatively small quantities of musical anaesthetic are guaranteed to transform what normally would be the most unbearable mental anguish into a condition of celestial beatitude.\n\nMost film accompanists were not as patient, thorough, or gifted as Hugo Riesenfeld or as organized as the Loew’s theater music department. Not unexpectedly, their musical mistakes were numerous. Under the heading “Misfits,” May Meskimen Mills warned novice theater organ players about such pitfalls:\n\nIf you are playing pictures, do so intelligently. To give you an idea of how easily a wrong number can be chosen for a scene, a man and a woman were shown on the screen in each other’s embrace. The organist began playing a silly love song, only to find that the couple were brother and sister. Here is another example: during the late war, an army of soldiers were shown marching in the distance. Immediately the organist began playing “Three Cheers for the Red, White and Blue.” Naturally the audience rose to their feet only to find that they were greeting an army of German soldiers instead. The audience seeing the mistake gradually slipped into their seats but the organist tore madly through the number not noticing the difference. I once heard in a prominent theatre in one of the Eastern cities, an organist play “I Am Always Chasing Rainbows” when Salome was chasing John the Baptist in the picture. There is no logical reason for one playing a drinking song such as “How Dry I Am” on an echo or cathedral chimes. Yet you hear it done and many other things equally as ridiculous. Persons of good taste would not be seen in a bathing suit at a church wedding, yet players do just as absurd things in the fitting of pictures.\n\nThere were often complaints about incompetent organists. Orchestras and organs were often accused of being too loud. Brass often did not play during the feature films on Broadway because they could not play softly enough. Strings were considered the one tone quality most audiences could stand for any length of time. Some claimed that the average theater orchestra could be beaten by any live theater organist with a halfway acceptable organ. Vocalists were vilified:\n\nThe vocal solos were diaphramatic writhings on da-me-ni-po, or some equally intelligent sounds, so over-accompanied by the orchestra that it was fortunately not compulsory to listen to the vocal gurglings much of the time.\n\nThe changeover between the playing by the orchestra and that by the organ could be ghastly:\n\nSome conductors stop the orchestra anywhere in a number, like applying the emergency brakes at full speed. Sometimes, not trusting the men to watch them, they snap out the lights suddenly which makes the score a series of jolts and jars.\n\nAnd the synchronization could be terrible:\n\nThe music should be as closely joined to the picture as in the Phono-film, where the two cannot become separated… We often hear the organist, after the cue for a change has appeared, end the previous number rather indecisively, ramble around in a few aimless chords, fix the stops and finally float into something fitting the scene—when it is half over.\n\nOn the other hand, the conditions for photoplayers were not ideal either.\n\nThe conservatories which turned out graduates for the theater…overlooked some important details. [The graduates] had never been taught under the conditions which [they] had to face later in actual experience. [They] had never been taught to play a Chopin Nocturne “with great feeling” while accompanied by extraneous sounds such as peanut cracking, ribald jeers, and popping gum…\n\nThere were some directors, like D. W. Griffith and Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., who controlled the musical accompaniments that went with their films and thereby attempted to control the affect their films had on the public. More often than not, however, movie directors had almost no time to think about music, and individual musicians had no time to do anything but keep playing. Through the amount of time and money they had and were willing to spend, music directors and theater managers, more than any other people, controlled the type and quality of accompaniment given to each picture. From the accounts of the Rialto and Rivoli theaters in New York, it is clear that Hugo Riesenfeld exemplified the outstanding music director.\n\nTheater Managers and Film Music\n\nSome of the theater managers also are legends: S. L. Rothapfel (“Roxy”) in New York and Sid Grauman in Los Angeles. Rothapfel, when at the Capitol Theater in New York, employed the then unknown Eugene Ormandy, first as the concert master of his orchestra and then as its conductor. Later he opened the enormous and short-lived cathedral of movie palaces, the Roxy, where his musical expenses were as elephantine as everything else about the theater’s operations. In 1927 he offered classical violinist Fritz Kreisler $12,500 for one week’s appearance.\n\nThese legendary managers were exceptional. The problems presented by the run-of-the-mill theater managers are summarized in an article entitled “Managers of Heavenly Descent: Photoplaying isn’t an art but the enjoyment of an investment. They bought the darned things and pay us to use them. Full steam ahead and no pax vobiscum.”\n\nThere is, sad to say, a larger class about whom nothing praiseworthy can be said except that they know the film market. These are the Bad Boys who make the organist take to drink, go back to the dance orchestra, or start selling vacuum cleaners at back doors…\n\nMy first indictment against them is that they think the organ is a great deal like the furnace; once bought you need do nothing more to it than engage someone to run it. Maybe tune it once every two years or so, and then again maybe not. Who can tell the difference?... The only thing that will make a dent in his code of laisser faire is a cipher on the 16’ Trombone, assuming for the moment the unlikely possibility that the organ has a 16’ Trombone…\n\nThe luckless organist innocently enters [the manager’s office] with a confident request for service to get this Trombone cipher fixed… “What!” yells the outraged boss, “I should pay five dollars for a one pipe to fix? What kind of organist are you that don’t know how to fix one pipe?”…\n\nThis unexpected cataclysm presents three alternatives to the organist. He can either go back to the job and pretend the cipher is the noise of some motor on the premises, or he can play all his music in that key and pretend it requires a sustained Pedal Point on that note, or he can leave the picture flat while he climbs into the organ chamber, tears his pants, bumps his head, gets dirt all over his hands and clothes and a smudge on his nose, and wrastles with the Grampa of Trombone pipes, knocking the tuning slide a minor third out of pitch, stepping on a few small pipes getting in and out, and leaving an eight-inch pressure leak that will be handy for the tornado episodes in the picture but slightly annoying the rest of the time…\n\nManagers who thus reduce overhead by eliminating necessary organ repairs can logically do so on no other grounds than that music is a necessary evil endured only so that the show will not be run in dead silence. Granting this assumption, it then becomes good business to keep the music going at a minimum of expense, with quality a perfectly extraneous factor…\n\nThe whole philosophy is similar to that of a manager I once knew who installed a ventilating system that proved to be more expensive than efficient. Instead of an indirect system which unobtrusively freshened and renewed the air, there was an enormous fan above the proscenium which blew such a draft down upon the heads of the patrons that it was no uncommon thing to see strong men sitting there with overcoats on and collars turned up, and even hats on if there was no one directly behind to object. It is a fact that heavy velvet draperies at the front of the house were blown out and held at a conspicuous angle from the floor. Furthermore, the air, which was sucked in from the roof, was hot in hot weather and cold in cold weather, with the natural result that the fan could always be relied on to make the inside temperature more uncomfortable than that on the street….”Hadn’t we better stop the fan, sir?” said the electrician one chilly day. “The house is down to 65, and we’re getting complaints.” I herewith append the [manager’s] reply for what it is worth: “Keep that fan going. I’m going to give ‘em their twenty thousand dollars’ worth of ventilation if I have to freeze ‘em to their seats.” Thus with the music.\n\nClearly, music in the silent film era was as prominent as the images, for better or for worse.\n\nAt the beginning of the silent film era, music had been used to mask the sound of the projector and to offset the “ghostliness” of the images. For the most part the accompaniments were a stream of accompanying sound. Often they were a string of popular tunes or what some people uncharitably referred to as commercialized noise. By the 1920s in many theaters sophisticated accompaniments were being used to achieve a full range of effects, and direct control over a film’s accompaniment could be achieved through the distribution of cue sheets, compiled scores, and original scores.\n\nCue Sheets\n\nIn 1909 the New York Daily Mirror reported that the Edison and Vitagraph companies had been circulating printed programs of instrumental music suitable as accompaniment to their films. Between 1910 and 1912 movie companies, music publishers, and the trade press began to make and distribute musical cue sheets for films. Cue sheets presented a list of film actions and intertitles in the order in which they appeared in the film. After each cue or title there was a timed reference to a specific musical composition which in a sort of shorthand referred to a specific publication. Vast series of incidental music, timed and classified by mood and tempo (such as “Highly dramatic agitato” and “Agitato furioso”), were published to meet the needs of photoplayers. Cue sheet compilers relied heavily on these series.\n\nCue sheets thus could save time and provide a modicum of musical control. However, the quality of the cue sheets was a source of debate among experienced photoplayers, some of whom argued that cue sheets were only useful to the completely inexperienced movie accompanist and then only if they were by cue sheet compiler S. M. Berg.\n\nThe cue sheets did have drawbacks. If a musician did not have a piece cited by the cue sheet, a substitution had to be made. An enormous library of incidental music was required. All the music needed to be assembled and arranged. Often only two minutes of a five-minute piece were called for and harmonic transitions from one key to another were lacking. The arrangement process took time. Sometimes the cue sheet was incomplete, and sometimes the taste of the cue sheet’s compiler would differ from that of the photoplayer. Often the cue sheets appeared in print too late for big city screenings of the films. And if the same music library was used over and over again, the accompaniments became monotonous.\n\nThe cue sheet for Ramon Novarro’s Across to Singapore (MGM, 1928) is an example of the shorthand employed by cue sheet compilers to present the organization of the film and the music that was to fit it. The cue sheet begins with the notation “1 AT SCREENING…Symphonic Color Classic No. 5 (Marquardt) (YELLOW)…1 ½ Min.” Six measures of music follow and conclude with “Copyr. 1925 Music Buyers Corp.” Item 2 is “(Title) AMONG THE UNSUNG DEEDS…A.B.C. Dram. Set No. 13-A1 (Luz)…1 ¼ Min.” Another six measures of music follow and conclude with “Copyr. 1916 Photo Play Mus. Co.” Item 3 is “(Title) SWIM…A.B.C. Dram. Set No. 13-B2 (Luz)…1/2 Min.” Seven measures of music follow and conclude with “Copyr. 1916 Photo Play Mus. Co.” Item 4 is “(Title) IT WAS THE BEST…Symphonic Color Classic No. 5 (Marquardt) (GREEN)…1 Min.” which is followed by seven measures of music and concludes with “Copyr. 1925 Music Buyers Corp.” and so on for forty-seven segments.\n\nThese shorthand notations translate into the following:\n\nAT SCREENING—P.A. Marquardt. A Twentieth Century Romance (N.Y., Music Buyers Corp., 1925; No. 5 in the Series Symphonic Color Classics), fifth movement (YELLOW). Over 80 measures of music to fit 90 seconds of film. Arranged for full or small orchestra (the latter: flute, clarinet, 2 cornets, trombone, timpani/drums, violin I and II, viola, cello, bass, and piano).\n\nAMONG THE UNSUNG DEEDS—Ernst Luz. Agitato-Hurry (N.Y., Photoplay Music Co., 1916; No. 13 in the series A.B.C. Dramatic Set), first section. 117 measures to fit 75 seconds of film. Arranged for flute, clarinet, 2 cornets, trombone, drums/timpani, violins I and II, viola, cello, bass, piano, and organ.\n\nSWIM—Ernst Luz. Plaintive (N.Y., Photoplay Music Co., 1916; No. 13 in the series A.B.C. Dramatic Set), second section. 16 measures to fit 30 seconds of film. With published parts as above for AMONG THE UNSUNG DEEDS.\n\nIT WAS THE BEST—P. A. Marquardt. A Twentieth Century Romance (N.Y., Music Buyers Corp., 1925; No. 5 in series Symphonic Color Classics), fourth movement (GREEN). 48 measures to fit 60 seconds of film. Arranged for full or small orchestra with published parts as above in cue AT SCREENING.\n\nand so forth.\n\nWith such cue sheets and a vast library of incidental music (the A.B.C. Dramatic Set exceeded twenty-five numbers and many series had over one hundred separate numbers), theater musicians could concoct the musical accompaniments specified by the movie producers, music publishers, or the makers of cue sheets. If they had a full orchestra and all the printed parts, they could put together a compilation of music that followed the cue sheet exactly. They could use as many or as few instruments as they had on hand, or they could even improvise on the themes that were printed on some cue sheets instead of sticking to the printed arrangements.\n\nCue sheets left a lot of room for individual variation, but they also left a lot to be desired. For the photoplayer who performed four shows a day in a theater whose pictures changed every day or two, there could never be enough time to put together a compiled score of any sort, much less to screen each new film before accompanying it. Often, too, during their travels through the theaters, films were damaged. The damaged sections were cut, and the remaining sections were spliced together. After a while cue sheets no longer contained an accurate representation of the films’ timings or even of their organization.\n\nCompiled and Original Scores\n\nA few directors obtained a somewhat greater degree of control over their musical accompaniments by commissioning and circulating scores with their films. This practice may have begun quite early. Charles Gilbert reported that the Film Division of the Australian National Library in Canberra was presented with the original score written for Soldiers of the Cross, a 3000-foot film made by the Salvation Army in Melbourne in 1900. T. M. F. Steen submits that the earliest example of original film music must be Gaston Paulin’s 1892 score for Emile Reynaud’s Pantomimes Lumineuses. Camille Saint-Saëns wrote an original score for the ten-minute L’Assassinat du Duc de Guise (1908). Thomas Dixon may have been the first American producer to commission an original score (from Victor Herbert for The Fall of a Nation in 1916). However, Walter Cleveland Simon may have been the first American to compose an original film score, for Arrah Na Pough (1911).\n\nThe practice of hiring a composer to compile a score from preexisting classical and popular music and of circulating the score with the picture was continued most notably in the late teens and early twenties by D. W. Griffith. Like cue sheets, these scores were liberally sprinkled with action and intertitles. Instead of the timings (one and one-half minutes of x music, 30 seconds of y, etc.) there were metronome markings (Section X will go at the quarter note equals 120, Section Y at eighth note equals 96, etc.). All these devices were intended to help the conductor stay in sync with the film.\n\nD. W. Griffith, The Birth of a Nation, and Way Down East\n\nD. W. Griffith was one of the first American directors to maintain careful control over the selection and distribution of the musical accompaniment for his films. They premiered in only one city at a time. He travelled with the film and the orchestral parts to each new theater, overseeing the whole presentation of each new premiere. He participated in the selection of the music, and then organized the images, the music, and the sound effects for his film presentations. He firmly established the practice of using a full orchestral accompaniment in American movie theaters. Musically, he also may have been the most knowledgeable of the early directors. Karl Brown in Adventures with D. W. Griffith tells many stories about Griffith’s knowledge of music:\n\nGriffith’s personal habits of shadowboxing, dancing whenever Miss Geesh [Lillian Gish] was available, or singing at the top of his lungs went on as usual. Up to this picture he had been content to sing the most effective parts of the more flamboyant operatic arias. Canio’s famous “Vesti la giubba,” from I Pagliacci, got a thorough working over, but only in open tones, not Italian. He would sometimes also observe, in full voice, that the stars were brightly shining, this from Tosca.\n\nAnother time Griffith’s obsession with music showed itself was when we took a very long shot of the battlefield strewn with dead and with Lillian Gish running from corpse to corpse, looking for her beloved. Correction: she fluttered from corpse to corpse. A lot of little quick steps, a pause, a look, then some more quick little fluttering steps, another look, and so on. It was during the making of this scene that Griffith exclaimed, with a sense of sudden inspiration, that the Lohengrin Wedding March, the familiar “Here comes the bride,” was in exactly the same time and rhythm of the equally familiar Funeral March from the Chopin sonata. It seemed to astonish him that two such opposite sentiments, the extreme of happiness and extreme grief, should be couched in exactly the same musical terms, except that one was in the major mode, the other in the minor.\n\nOn the opening night of The Birth of a Nation (1914), Brown heard both of these tunes in the accompaniment for this scene.\n\nGriffith not only knew a lot about music, he knew enough to be able to articulate his desires to composer Joseph Carl Breil during the production of The Birth of a Nation.\n\nThe two men had many disagreements over the scoring of the film. “If I ever kill anyone,” Mr. Griffith once said, “it won’t be an actor but a musician.” The greatest dispute was over the Klan call, which was taken from “The Ride of the Valkyries” by Richard Wagner. Mr. Griffith wanted a slight change in the notes. Mr. Breil fought against making it.\n\n“You can’t tamper with Wagner!” he protested. “It’s never been done!”\n\nThis music wasn’t primarily music, Mr. Griffith explained. It was music for motion pictures.\n\nArt historian Irwin Panofsky elegantly summarized these problems of collaboration:\n\nIt might be said that a film, called into being by a cooperative effort in which all contributions have the same degree of permanence, is the nearest modern equivalent of a medieval cathedral… And if you speak to any one of [the] collaborators he will tell you, with perfect bona fides, that his is really the most important job—which is quite true to the extent that it is indispensible…\n\nKarl Brown, apprentice cameraman to D. W. Griffith during the shooting of The Birth of a Nation, had read Thomas Dixon’s novel, The Clansman, upon which the movie is based. Throughout the shooting he had doubted that Griffith could make this racist story into a successful film. However, his account of opening night speaks worlds about the impact of a musical accompaniment (although his description may be in error on certain points):\n\nMy first inkling that this was not to be just another movie came when I heard, over the babble of the crowd, the familiar sound of a great orchestra tuning up. First the oboe sounding A, then the others joining to produce an ever-changing medley of unrelated sounds, with each instrument testing its own strength and capability through this warming-up preliminary. Then the orchestra came creeping in through that little doorway under the proscenium apron and I tried to count them. Impossible. Too many. But there were at least seventy, for that’s where I lost count, so most if not all of the Los Angeles Symphony orchestra had been hired to “play” the picture.\n\nNot that I hadn’t known about a special score having been prepared for the production. Joseph Carl Breil had been around the studio a lot, talking with Griffith, so I knew what was up. But Carl Breil was no Beethoven. Thus far he had produced only one song, “The Song of the Soul,” which had become a great favorite among those who like that kind of music, but he was no great shakes as a composer in the grand manner. Oh, he was capable enough in his own limited way. He was a musician, there was no denying that. He could arrange, he was good at instrumentation, and he could conduct. He could do just about anything known to music except think up tunes. Well, maybe Griffith had supplied that lack. We’d soon find out, because the orchestra pit was crammed to overflowing with the finest performers in Los Angeles and more, many more instruments of different kinds than I had seen anywhere before except at full-dress, all-out symphony concerts. He had the big doghouse, as we called the double basses, and a lot of little doghouses, as the cellos were called, with as many fiddles as there was room for and enough brass to make up a full brass band all by itself. And as for the kitchen, or hardware shop, as the drum section was called, there was everything known to percussion, while at the console of the massive pipe organ sat a little man lost in a maze of stops and manuals, ready to turn on the full roar of that monster at the tip of a baton. Yes, it was a complete orchestra, all right. I even glimpsed two or three banjos in that crowded orchestra pit. But what they could be doing there was more than I could imagine.\n\nThe house lights dimmed. The audience became tensely silent. I felt once again, as always before, that strange all-over chill that comes with the magic moment of hushed anticipation when the curtain is about to rise.\n\nThe title came on, apparently by mistake, because the curtain had not yet risen and all I could see was the faint flicker of the lettering against the dark fabric of the main curtain. But it was not a mistake at all, because the big curtain rose slowly to disclose the title, full and clear upon the picture screen, while at the same moment Breil’s baton rose, held for an instant, and then swept down releasing the full impact of the orchestra in a mighty fanfare that was all but out-roared by the massive blast of the organ in an overwhelming burst of earth-shaking sound that shocked the audience first into a stunned silence and then roused them to a pitch of enthusiasm such as I had never seen or heard before…\n\nThe orchestra sort of murmured to itself during the titles, as though to assure the audience that they couldn’t last forever. And then…the picture, gliding along through its opening sequences on a flow of music that seemed to speak for the screen and to interpret every mood. The audience was held entranced,…\n\nWhat unfolded on that screen was magic itself. I knew there were cuts from this and to that, but try as I would, I could not see them. A shot of the extreme far end of the Confederate line flowed into another but nearer shot of the same line, to be followed by another, and another, until I could have sworn that the camera had been carried back by some sort of impossible carrier that made it seem to be all one unbroken scene. Perhaps the smoke helped blind out the jumps. I don’t know. All I knew was that between the ebb and flow of a broad canvas of a great battle, now far and now near, and the roaring of that gorgeous orchestra banging and blaring battle songs to stir the coldest bloke, I was hot and cold and feeling waves of tingling electric shocks racing all over me.\n\nThe Confederate charge was simply magnificent. Once again, there was nothing choppy about it, no sense of scenes being cut into another. That whole line of men simply flowed across the field, stumbling and dropping as they ran somehow into solid sheets of rifle fire from the Union entrenchments, while bombs, real bombs and not Fireworks Wilson’s silly little powder puffs, burst with deafening roars among these charging heroes. Oh yes; I knew. I knew perfectly well that the backstage crew was working furiously to create these explosion effects just behind the screen, but I was too caught up in the magnificence of the spectacle to care how it was achieved.\n\nAnd that scene with Walthall snatching up the flag and racing forward with it: holding it high and waving it defiantly as he ran with it in one hand and his drawn sword in the other straight at the cannon, to mount the parapet, and then—in a single, magnificent, overwhelming glimpse of one man, alone against a sky full of bursting bombs, thrusting that standard down the cannon’s throat and shouting his defiant yell, while the trumpets in the orchestra split the air. Nor were those trumpets alone. I think every man in the packed audience was on his feet cheering, not the picture, not the orchestra, not Griffith but voicing his exultation at this man’s courage—defiant in defeat, and all alone with only the heavens for his witness…\n\nI was forced to admit to myself over again how pitifully little I knew about anything at all. There was that scene of Lillian Gish fluttering and running, fluttering and running over the death-strewn battlefield looking for her beloved, not as any human being would make such a search but as a ballet dancer might pictorialize it. I thought it was awful when it was being shot. But it was heartbreakingly effective on that night upon that screen before that particular audience, especially with the orchestra, that beautiful orchestra, interweaving the twin themes of love and death, just as Griffith had thought of them at that one magic moment o the battlefield. For she wasn’t a woman at all but a spirit, a will-of-the-wisp, floating over the field of death. She was even more than that: she was the spirit of all the women of the Civil War, who still lived in the memories of their daughters and granddaughters, whose hearts had been searching among the dead for the living after every one of the many major battles…\n\nAnd yet it wasn’t the finish that worried me so much as the long dull, do-nothing stuff that I knew was slated for the bulk of the second half. Stuff like the hospital scenes, where Lillian Gish comes to visit Henry Walthall, she in demurest of dove gray, he in bed with a bandage neatly and evenly wrapped around his head. Now what in the world can anyone possibly do to make a hospital visit seem other than routine?... Since this was an army hospital, there had to be a sentry on guard… Well, Lillian passed before him and he looked after her and sighed. In the theater and on the screen, that sigh became a monumental, standout scene… Breil may not have been the greatest composer the world has ever know but he did know how to make an orchestra talk, and that sigh, uttered by the cellos and the muted trombones softly sliding down in a discordant glissando, drove the audience into gales of laughter…\n\nBrown cites a number of other such examples and then concludes:\n\nSomewhere in this welter of…images came a new concept of Griffith… What he really was—it seemed odd to think so—was a great composer of visual images instead of notes. What I had seen was not so much a motion picture but the equivalent of Beethoven’s Eroica or his Fifth. That picture had been perfectly orchestrated and the instrumentation flawless.\n\nIn 1914 The Birth of a Nation established the use of a full orchestra for film accompaniment in the United States. The East Coast premieres had a score that was a combination of original music by Breil and arrangements of popular and classical music. The score on the West Coast was by Carli Elinor and although it is lost, it must have contained a similar combination of music. Griffith’s Way Down East (1920) also had a specially fitted score that:\n\ndidn’t consist of the usual hackneyed, thumb-worn numbers. Most of it seemed to have been written for the production, except the old tunes directly called for. Scores are apt to be slapped together in a hurry, a mechanical routine of publishers’ lists and card-indexes. The storm and ice music was the weak spot—bald and crude of content. The fragments from Flying Dutchman and Les Preludes were the only blood and thunder touch in the score. There should have been the maximum sonority, but that of a symphonic orchestra—whirring strings relieving the boiler-factory din of the brass, and easing up on the huskies back-stage. The gatling-guns and bombs still surviving behind (or before) the scenes in some houses are a public menace.\n\nOtherwise the music was a marvel of repose and placidity. No lashing of tempos, blurring of passage-work, hurrying-to-catch-a-train spirit. This hectic, neurasthenic style has a bad effect on the individual and collective playing of orchestra and organists. The pause was used often and effectively. The picture being well directed, it was possible to have a smooth and flowing score.\n\nThe leit-motif system was used to advantage, although it is capable of unlimited development, following the interweaving of emotions and mental states. A motif can be varied in instrumentation, introduced stealthily and subtly in one part, like the baleful movements of the villain. But the course of this story is simple and direct, far from metaphysics or psychoanalysis. The gossip’s theme was characteristic and expressive. Especially appealing were the several themes for the mishaps and tribulations of Anna. The youthful Innocence motif was delightful. How much better than using some sentimental melody already played to death…\n\nThe music of “Way Down East” seemed written for this play alone; the next time we went the play seemed written for the music. The music and the story were like ivy clinging to a tree. The score was always on the job, fitting the action, like skin-tights, all the time, not like a hoop-skirt, touching only here and there. Score-makers, conductors, and organists, should throw themselves into the work as the great actors do, and make themselves the creators of the characters and story, till it becomes a living flesh and blood organism. But they need better pictures to project themselves into…\n\nThe natural evolution of the picture business then points to a renaissance of the Greek drama, with Wagnerian music-setting. The screen reveals the actors, dialogue, and stage-settings, the orchestra gives a continuous tonal version of the story.\n\nClearly, the carefully chosen and well synchronized music of William Frederick Peters and Louis Silvers, although rather lightweight musically, was refreshing and impressive to a musically sensitive, frequent filmgoer. One can infer from this account that the constant reuse of the same music was common and tedious and that sloppy synchronization or abrupt transitions between keys detracted at least a little from some people’s enjoyment.\n\nA British presentation of Way Down East in 1923 elicited a totally negative reaction to the music:\n\nMost of the music was of such undistinguished character that [Mr. Albert Marchbank, conductor of the orchestra at the Tower Cinema, Rye Lane, Peckham, London] had to practically rescore the musical fitting… The music for the big storm-scene especially was bad, and this was replaced entirely by him. In addition to the music being of a low standard, the score is “peppered” with leit-motifs for each of the six main characters. The airs of “I love you” and “Believe me” are scored each time the heroine appears. There is a further theme announcing the arrival of the chatterbox neighbor, and this theme alone appears forty times in the original score. If this is supposed to be the latest advancement in film-music, I look with apprehension to its future! It is appalling to see these blundering attempts at imitating great masters. Truly, a little knowledge is dangerous. I am glad Mr. Marchbank refused to perform this rubbish and made a clean sweep of both the music supplied with the films and the innumerable cues which appeared about every ten bars or so. The inevitable result was a veritable musical victory. For the house has been playing to capacity night after night and thousands of people had to be turned away as there was no further accommodation. This success was due in a large measure to the masterly musical setting by Mr. Marchbank. The storm-music provided the greatest sensation, and this, together with the wonderful effects supplied with the film, absolutely “brought the house down.” There were, for instance, realistic lightning effects for which a special electric installation had been laid on. This lightning Mr. Marchbank—like Zeus—controlled (from the organ), evoking thunderous replies from the lower regions of the orchestra. There were also ice-breaking machines, waterfall, rain, wind effects and what-not. All these effects, manipulated in the right way, combined with the wonderful setting of the music, played superbly by the orchestra, as a musical illustration of the drama on the screen, produced a whole which was a stunning triumph of perfect film-presentation and worthy of the highest praise.\n\nD. W. Griffith never could leave any of his pictures alone. After their initial release, he constantly cut and rearranged them. (Even after he gave his collection to the Museum of Modern Art, he still recut the films in the projection booth after each screening until finally the Museum ordered the projection booth locked.) By 1923, probably as much as 25 percent of Way Down East had been cut or changed. Cut marks through the score and parts testify to the constant tinkering. In all probability, the score no longer fit the 1923 version like “skin-tights” or “ivy clinging to a tree,” and Mr. Marchbank was well advised to use different music. Although the tastes in the two reviews differ with respect to the Peters-Silvers score, the ideal for film music is the same—“continuous tonal version of the story” and “musical illustration of the drama on the screen.”\n\nThe scores for D. W. Griffith’s films were compiled, arranged, and created by knowledgeable composers, but the majority of the scores for his films relied heavily on arrangements of preexisting music. Intolerance (1916), for example, uses an entire chorus from Verdi’s Aida (twice), a vocal quartet version of “My Wild Irish Rose,” and music from Delibes’s ballets. By comparison, the commissioning of totally original scores, especially for feature films, became increasingly common in the 1920s. It led to such landmark scores as Mortimer Wilson’s for The Thief of Bagdad (1924), William Axt’s for Don Juan (1926) and Leo Pouget and Victor Alix’s for La Passion de Jean D’Arc (1928).\n\nThe Thief of Bagdad\n\nThere were those, however, who preferred scores compiled from preexisting material.\n\nSomething the professional critics have kindly failed to mention is the ultra oriental music score accompanying this wonder picture [The Thief of Bagdad]. Marcelli and his orchestra and Mr. Scholl worked for many weeks preparing the music written by Mr. Mortimer Wilson and their performance of the score is above criticism. They are all able, conscientious musicians and capable of handling even worse scores than this one though I hope it will never be necessary for them to do so. The press agent has termed the score a “harmonic fealty,” “a vital emotional symphony,” “a fitting note for every gesture,” “written like a grand opera,” “a motive for every theme” reminiscent of an intended quotation we once saw on the screen reading “And never the two shall twain.”\n\nFoibles of art and music are excusable at times but a valid excuse for this Bagdad music score must be extraordinary, if any. When the music of the world is at the disposal of an arranger and the libraries are rich in beautiful numbers, written by renowned composers, suitable for accompanying such a delightfully fantastic picture, why worry any one man to write a new “note for every gesture?” Strains from the modern writings of Ravel, Debussy, Korsakow, Puccini, Ornstein, Grainger, Irvin Cobb or Paul Whiteman would have been welcomed, somewhere a few beautiful harmonic passages from MacDowell would have been enjoyable and made more fitting contrast for some of the bizarre extensions, augmentations, depleted sixteenths, vigorous minor forte passages and other incongruous music idioms under the guise of oriental music… Technically the score may be symphonic, but most successful symphonies have melodies that have lived for a considerable period… A few good rich dominant seventh chords might have saved part of the wreck of “Bagdad” but perhaps they never used such implements in Bagdad. When there are such successful arrangers in the field as Luz, Schertzinger, Bradford and others whose scores are a pleasure to play and easy to hear, why issue such a potpourri as this “Bagdad” music and expect any one capable of music appreciation to enjoy listening to it even in the hands of the most capable musicians?... Unless an original score is such that it can be handled by small orchestras or organists on short notice, it is liable to be a detriment to the picture, as the musician conscientiously wishes to use an accompanying score. I feel quite sure that there is going to be some wonderful first night atmospheric creations when Doug comes to town with his “harmonic fealty.”\n\nThis review was followed by T. S. Buhrman’s editorial postscript:\n\nMr. Medcalfe does not appear to like Mr. Wilson’s score. That’s too bad. The New York critics, if we may be pardoned for mentioning these creatures, were unanimous in according the Wilson “Bagdad” score the highest praise. Perhaps the incident merely emphasizes the age-old difference in taste between N.Y. and L.A. Anyway, it has been said in these pages—modesty forbids my saying who said it—that a N.Y. organist could not make good in L.A. nor an L.A. organist make good in N.Y. I’d be tickled beyond my ability to endure if a score of mine were to be praised as highly as Mr. Wilson’s was and by men of the reputation these acclaimers enjoy.\n\nIn one respect, the biased Los Angeles reviewer was correct. The score to The Thief of Bagdad was not something that just any orchestra could field. It was technically extremely difficult, particularly for the string players, and there were virtuoso solos on the trumpet and French horn. A cue sheet was concocted to accompany the film, and it must have been used instead of the original score in many theaters.\n\nAs the editor of The American Organist pointed out, the high quality of Mortimer Wilson’s score for The Thief of Bagdad received immediate recognition from the New York critics. The veteran music critic of the New York Evening Post thought it a masterwork:\n\nWhere the eyes are kept so busy every second, it is difficult to listen to every detail of the music, but I have learned to do so, land it was with increasing admiration that I followed the evolution of Mr. Wilson’s score, noting the freshness and inexhaustible variety of the musical invention, its appropriateness to every situation and the clever avoidance of awkward gaps. Everything synchronized to perfection, Mr. Wilson to some extent uses leading motives; he is a master of orchestral coloring, and yesterday, he conducted the score as only the creator of a work—if he happens to be also a born leader—can conduct it.\n\nTheodore Stearns, writing in the New York Morning Telegraph, shared this view: “The score is undeniably beautiful. It has lofty sentiment, warmth and tenderness, and feelingly portrays the fundamental idea of The Thief of Bagdad, that true happiness must be earned.” He especially admired the continuity of the music, contrasting it with the patchwork effect of the usual silent-film accompaniments, especially those using snippets of preexisting music:\n\nWhat has handicapped the few real composers of original scores to accompany a big movie, up to date, has been that producers and directors eternally insist upon the music changing instantly with the changes in the picture. Inasmuch as The Thief of Bagdad is made up of some 2,000 “cut-ins,” [that] would mean changing the musical idea at the rate of once a minute for two and a half hours. This attempt is made, however, in most moving-pictures, and the result—nine times out of ten—is a hodgepodge of something commenced, nothing ever satisfactorily finished…\n\nWilson’s music for The Thief of Bagdad provides numerous examples of the composer’s inventiveness, melodic gifts, and skill at musical development and scoring. Stearns’s review in the Telegraph is gratifyingly specific:\n\nIn the Shiraz bazaar—in the Isle of Wak—in all the subsequent adventures of the Thief searching for the magic casket Mr. Wilson logically develops his former musical ideas, altering them and fitting them to the symbolism of the picture rather than to the tempo of the camera.\n\nBut characteristic gestures—even expressions—of Douglas Fairbanks are nicely mirrored in the orchestra. As the flying carpet is brought forth, just a single flute trill delicately portrays it. There is no “Flying Dutchman” hurry and bustle—no inane tremolos on the cymbal of strings.\n\nAs the Thief is passing through the ordeal by fire and slays a dragon that would turn Siegfried green with envy, there is no Ride of the Valkyries idea—merely a restless movement in the music. The snake and the magic apple are coldly pictured by a ponticello on the strings—which always gives a shiver down the spine.\n\nThe final reunion of the Thief and the Princess is marked by the highly artistic return of the Mosque music. Ordinarily, a composer, certainly the general run of movie directors—would naturally insist upon using the former love duet or barcarolle music. But, in a sense, the happiness of the lovers was earned through sacrifice and pain. Moonlight and magic carpets did not bring them together so much as did renunciation and patience.\n\nThe Los Angeles critic aside, Wilson’s score is a landmark in the history of motion picture music.\n\nAccording to Wilson’s son, Mortimer Wilson, Jr., the composer had to use some preexisting music for the first performance of the work because of pressure from someone who disliked the idea of a completely original score. Gradually he slipped all his original music back into the work, and nobody noticed. The first edition of the score and parts contains a number of ossias (additional pages) that are meant to substitute for some of the numbers, and in every case the additions are musically more effective. The second edition of the score and parts incorporated all these changes, and paid more careful attention to bad page turns in the parts. However, for the entrance of the magic army at the end of the film the first edition corresponds to the longer, premiere print of the film. The second edition corresponds to the shorter print that was distributed throughout the country. In any event the battle between compiled and original scores was never resolved during the silent era.\n\nIn the meantime a vast industry had been generated to supply movie theaters with trained musicians, theater organs, music scores, music libraries, and cue sheets. Many of the production companies, through their house periodicals—Paramount’s Progress-Advance (1914-20), for example—published cue sheets. The motion picture trade journals similarly printed cue sheets, The Motion Picture Exhibitor (1918+), for example. The American Organist instituted a regular “Photoplaying” column in 1920 which carried articles by noted theater organists, reviews of theater orchestra and organist performances, and cue sheets. George Eastman founded the Eastman School of Music in 1921 to train theater organists. Many of the major music publishers established special movie music departments and published vast libraries of incidental music, organized by mood, tempo, and duration.\n\nMusic Played During the Shooting of Silent Film\n\nStarting in the late teens music also played a role during the shooting of films. Geraldine Farrar may have introduced this practice.\n\nI asked Mr. DeMille if we might have music during our scenes, as I was so accustomed to orchestral accompaniment for certain tempi and phrasings, I felt I could better pantomime the rhythm of the effects. A little piano was hastily wheeled on the set and the talented Melville Ellis…inspired all my scenes with his impromptu playing. I believe this started the habit for music “off stage” for all later aspirants to emotional appeal. At any rate, from that time on I always had a musician at my elbow whose soulful throbs did more to start my tears than all the glycerine drops or onions more frequently employed by less responsive orbs.\n\nAbel Gance, the French director of Napoleon (1927), agreed:\n\n“I always had music on the set,” said Gance, who employed an organist, a violinist and a cellist, “not only to give the mood, but to keep everyone quiet. You can capture their attention more easily by the use of music. In the scene where the young Napoleon lies on the cannon…he had to cry in that scene. He couldn’t, until the musicians played Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata.”\n\nJoseph von Sternberg used music during the shooting of his last silent film, The Docks of New York (1928):\n\nFrom the darkness behind the big sun-arcs a violin wailed and a harmonium grunted like a passionate duet between a musical hyena and a melodious warthog. The director allowed a few moments for this stimulus to work on the feelings of the actors, then through the megaphone, bellowed “Go!” The actors sprang into motion. But von Sternberg was not satisfied. He bellowed “Stop” through the megaphone, and, turning the instrument towards the musicians, shouted, “That tune’s no good. Stir us up a bit. Put more battle spirit into it. Gee, nobody feels like fighting to a damned waltz!\n\nMusic was not used during the shooting of Carl Dreyer’s La Passion de Jeanne D’Arc (1928) nor during the shooting of D. W. Griffith’s films, but by the 1920s it was standard on most movie lots. Lillian Gish, whose orbs were surely as responsive as Geraldine Farrar’s was initially surprised and distracted by such music when after leaving D. W. Griffith’s employ, she started acting for Paramount:\n\nI could not impose my kind of rehearsal on the others, nor could I object when they wanted music for their scenes. I had never had music before, and I simply had to close my ears and continue working. The music was fine, of course, when I wasn’t trying to concentrate on a scene.\n\nOccasionally, a large ensemble was used, for example, Rudolph Berliner’s Palm Court Orchestra for Cecil B. DeMille’s The Ten Commandments (1923).\n\nThe film’s most dangerous scene was the giant pursuit of the Exodus by the charioted army of Egypt, played by members of the Eleventh Cavalry. They made a heroic spectacle in their golden tunics, metal cuirasses gleaming in the sun, their gilded helmets tossing with multicolored plumes. In the van of the chase was a span of black thoroughbreds which DeMille had bought in Kansas City for fifty thousand dollars. When the stampede was over, four men lay in the sand, severely injured. Horses were lamed. Sand swirled with the wreckage of broken chariots ground up by the horses’ hooves. One horse ran screaming about, its flesh flapping like a red scarf.\n\nDeMille had insisted upon a thirty-piece Palm Court orchestra, playing martial music, to sit in a special enclosure just off camera “to keep everyone in the right mood.” It was conducted by the unfortunate Rudolph Berliner, DeMille’s childhood friend who had been installed comfortably as Director of the Palm Court orchestra of the Ritz-Carlton in New York for the past few years. The flying horses headed, many of them riderless, straight for the band, which gallantly went on playing in evening dress, seemingly more frightened of DeMille than of the advancing horde. A moment later the chariots and horses crashed into them, leaving a heap of broken instruments and badly bruised men and women.\n\nEven when they were not being subjected to severe bruises and cuts, Berliner and his orchestra were constantly in distress, playing in the teeth of a gale which blew sand into the trombones and trumpets, clogging them up, and into ears, and mouths.\n\nMGM estimated that it spent $52,000 on set musicians in 1927. By 1928, phonograph records had replaced these musicians (records cost only $1,500 a year).\n\nWhile film music was not absolutely always present during the silent era, the vast majority of films were accompanied by some sort of music, which, for better or worse, played an important part in a film’s presentation. It also played an increasing role in setting the mood during the shooting of silent films.\n\nSound on Film\n\nIn 1923 the phonofilm was demonstrated at the Rivoli by Dr. Lee De Forest. The reviewer’s reactions were:\n\nIt sounds like a phonograph. For certain purposes, and even for certain portions of feature film, now and then, the device could be of practical use; but anything that sounds like reproduced music instead of like the original is inferior and not to be accepted.\n\nIn 1926 the Warner Theater presented the feature film Don Juan (Warner Bros.). The music by William Axt was recorded on a Vitaphone disc which was synchronized to the film. Admission was two dollars. The American Organist’s reviewer reported that some thought the sound a very great improvement over De Forest’s phonofilm. Others thought that is was “still the product of the tin-can and can not compete with music.” Most reviewers still focused on the music; they had yet to see the great potential of the new medium for the reproduction of speech.\n\nBy 1928, the handwriting was on the wall. An article appeared entitled “Vitaphone et al. An examination of the results of filmized music and a few reflections on the whole pack of inventions.” After discussing the various drawbacks of the sound film, the writer said:\n\nOn the other hand, anyone who saw Richard Dix in the baseball picture and heard the film’s results in reproducing the contagious racket of the Yankee Stadium, will agree that here the device has produced something that is entirely beyond the realm of possibility for organists and orchestra… There is to be said, further, in behalf of the vocalized film, that when a picture is made and a score set by a man like Hugo Riesenfeld, and played for records by an adequate orchestra under such a man’s direction, the resultant audible and visible film is infinitely superior to the accompaniments of the piano-drum-fiddle combinations so universally used in smaller houses.\n\nAt the end of 1929, the Loew’s Theater chain announced there would be no organists in their theaters in the future. One of the major New York theater organists, J. van Cleft Cooper, “acquired the duty of creating cross-word puzzles, at the rate of two a day, for a newspaper service that reaches 1100 papers.” A few of the major Broadway houses retained their organists to play in case the sound system failed, or between the films, or along with the sound films to boost their volume. Many composers, arrangers, and songwriters moved to Hollywood. Between 1928 and 1930, 10,000 musicians, half of all those playing in movie houses, lost their jobs.\n\nThere were some who felt that the photoplayers were getting what they deserved:\n\nThe present invasion of the Vitaphone and canned music into our picture theaters is causing the organists and orchestral musicians a great deal of worry as to the future. Most of these good people brought the storm down on their heads by their own action. The miserable so-called organ playing and the poor type of orchestral music undoubtedly cause a reaction in favour of the canned variety of a better type. Still, after talking with many men of the theatrical and musical professions, I feel that though the speaking picture is probably here to stay, the music accompaniment will again be given by the organists and instrumentalists. Only let us hope that they have learned their lesson, that the public will no longer tolerate the faking of standard compositions and the ruthless murder of classics which we have been compelled to endure in the past.\n\nUndoubtedly, well-synchronized performances of well-selected music or brilliantly improvised music could be heard throughout the 1920s. However, the average performance in the average theater was probably not well synchronized and not well played. The music did not intensify the film experience, which was enjoyed probably as often as not in spite of the music and even the film.
