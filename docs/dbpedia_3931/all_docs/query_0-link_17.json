        "text": "Footloose jumps with spirit, dazzling dance numbers and an electrifying musical score. It portrays the timeless struggle between innocent pleasure and rigid morality, when city-boy Ren McCormick (Kevin Bacon) finds himself in an uptight Midwestern town where dancing has been banned. Ren revolts with best friend Willard (Chris Penn) and the minister's daughter (Lori Singer). A treasury of Top 10 songs-Kenny Loggins \"Footloose,\" Shalamar \"Dancing In The Sheets,\" Deniece Williams \"Let's Hear It For The Boy,\" Bonnie Tyler \"Holding Out for A Hero,\" and the Footloose love theme, \"Almost Paradise.\""
