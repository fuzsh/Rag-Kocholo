He is delighted by Jessica, and captivates her in return. He makes peace with Katharine, and even wins over Toy, the Doughertys' prized cook, though not Jim and Roger.\n\nBut Pogo is still as irresponsible as before. He invites Jessica to come away with him and \"see the world.\" He even tries to break up her engagement, to Katharine's dismay.

Pogo and Katharine share a heartfelt smile and gaze into each other's eyes. Pogo boards a plane – with Toy.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nAt the time this film was released, Fred Astaire had given up dancing on screen.
