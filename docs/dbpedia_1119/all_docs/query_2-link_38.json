        "text": "Legendary singer, songwriter and keyboardist Howard Jones has announced that he will be hitting stages across North America this summer with ABC and special guest Haircut 100. The show will feature a dazzling array of beloved hit songs, sure to delight any 80s alternative music fan. The event is made even more special by the return of Haircut 100, who will be playing to North American audiences for the first time in 40+ years with their original band line-up. Please click here for the confirmed Tour Dates and Tickets with more dates to be added soon...\n\nOf the exceptional tour, Howard Jones commented, \"I'm very excited to be hitting the road with my friends ABC and Haircut 100. Our audiences can look forward to some seriously top tunes night after night! Bring your celebratory selves to the party.\" ABC frontman Martin Fry stated, \"ABC in the USA. Very excited to hit the road alongside Howard Jones and Haircut 100 for an electrifying summer tour across the USA! Get ready for an unforgettable musical journey as we bring the hits to stages nationwide. Let's make memories and rock the house together!\" Haircut 100's Nick Heyward added, \"Ever since our last tour in 1982 we've been pining to play in North America again, so this is a dream come true for us. Come down early and get your dancing shoes on, because there's a lot of catching up to do.\"\n\nHoward Jones will be joined onstage by his longtime stellar backing band: Nick Beggs (bass), Robin Boult (guitar), Dan Clarke (keyboards) and Robbie Bronnimann (keyboards and tech).\n\nElectronic music pioneer Howard Jones has been a constant presence on the international touring scene for the past four decades, playing live in a number of different configurations including intimate solo shows and dates with his full high-tech band set-up. He first burst upon the contemporary music scene in 1983, with his very English songwriting and pioneering synthesizers with 'New Song'. His first two albums HUMAN'S LIB and DREAM INTO ACTION were worldwide hits. HUMAN'S LIB reached #1 in 1984 in the UK and featured the hits 'New Song,' and 'What Is Love?' In 1985, Jones released the follow-up, DREAM INTO ACTION, which quickly became a Top Ten Platinum album in the United States and featured the smashes: 'Things Can Only Get Better,' 'Life In One Day,' 'No One Is To Blame,' and 'Like To Get To Know You Well.'\n\nHoward Jones has sold upwards of 10 million albums worldwide and continues to make new music and tour the world. Jones has performed on NBC's top-rated morning and nighttime shows respectively, Today and The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. His ubiquitous hits can be heard in such high-profile television series and films such as 'Stranger Things,' 'Breaking Bad,' 'Watchmen,' 'The Carrie Diaries', 'Superstore' and 'Bumblebee'. Howard Jones' most recent album is DIALOGUE, which was released in September 2022. DIALOGUE is the third album in a trilogy of electronic releases from Jones with multi-media project ENGAGE released in 2015 and studio album TRANSFORM, released in 2019. DIALOGUE garnered serious coverage in outlets such as Spin, Stereogum and more.\n\nTo celebrate the 40th anniversary of Howard's recorded music career, our friends at Cherry Red Records are delighted to release a brand new 'Very Best Of' compilation. For his 40th anniversary, Howard wanted to create a truly unique collection. 'Celebrate It Together The Very Best Of Howard Jones 1983-2023' is the first anthology that looks at his entire catalogue, from the original version of 'New Song,' all the way to a 2023 Elephant Talk remix of it that recasts it within a modern electronica context.* It includes songs from his classic Warner-era catalogue, as well as work from his independent Dtox label. For 'Celebrate It Together', Howard has personally chosen to group the songs into four categories: 'Popular Hits,' 'Electro,' 'Chill,' and 'Curiosities.' He wanted to elevate this selection of songs beyond the typical chronological approach and create themes that mix and match different pieces from different eras, with the overall listening experience top of mind. The Celebrate It Together - The Very Best of Howard Jones 1983-2023 is released on 6th of October as a 2CD, 4CD Clamshell Box Edition and a 2LP Translucent Mint Green Edition. (*4CD and 2CD formats only.)\n\nTo order your copy of this release, visit the Cherry Red store here."
