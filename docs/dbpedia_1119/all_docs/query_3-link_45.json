        "text": "Madonna\n\nAmerican singer and actress\n\nMadonna (born August 16, 1958, Bay City, Michigan, U.S.) is an American singer, songwriter, actress, and entrepreneur whose immense popularity in the 1980s and ’90s allowed her to achieve levels of power and control that were nearly unprecedented for a woman in the entertainment industry. A major pop culture icon, Madonna is also known for her ever-changing fashion style and for her provocative public persona.\n\nEarly life and career\n\nMadonna was born into a large Italian American family, and in 1963 at age five she lost her mother to breast cancer. She has said that this event, more than any other, drove her to pursue success and fame as an adult. In the 1970s Madonna studied dance at the University of Michigan and with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater in New York City before relocating briefly to Paris as a member of Patrick Hernandez’s disco revue. Returning to New York City, she performed with a number of rock groups before signing with Sire Records. Her first hit, “Holiday,” in 1983, provided the blueprint for her later material—an upbeat dance club sound with sharp production and an immediate appeal. Always ambitious and confident in herself, she famously told Dick Clark in an appearance on American Bandstand in 1984 that she wanted “to rule the world.”\n\nMusic career of the 1980s and early ’90s\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\n90s Music Quiz\n\nMadonna’s melodic pop incorporates catchy choruses, and her lyrics concern love, sex, and relationships—ranging from the breezy innocence of “True Blue” (1986) to the erotic fantasies of “Justify My Love” (1990) to the spirituality of later songs such as “Ray of Light” (1998). Criticized by some as being limited in range, her sweet girlish voice nonetheless was well suited to pop music.\n\nMadonna was the first female artist to exploit fully the potential of the music video. She collaborated with top designers (Jean-Paul Gaultier), photographers (Steven Meisel and Herb Ritts), and directors (Mary Lambert and David Fincher), drawing inspiration from underground club culture or the avant-garde to create distinctive sexual and satirical images—from the knowing ingenue of “Like a Virgin” (1984) to the controversial red-dressed “sinner” who kisses a Black saint in “Like a Prayer” (1989). By 1991 she had scored 21 top 10 hits in the United States and sold some 70 million albums internationally, generating $1.2 billion in sales. Committed to controlling her image and career herself, Madonna became the head of Maverick, a subsidiary of Time Warner created by the entertainment giant as part of a $60 million deal with the performer. Her success signaled a clear message of financial control to other women in the industry, but in terms of image she was a more ambivalent role model.\n\nFilm career and projects of the 1980s and ’90s\n\nIn 1992 Madonna took her role as a sexual siren to its full extent when she published Sex, a soft-core pornographic coffee-table book featuring her in a variety of “erotic” poses. She was criticized for being exploitative and overcalculating. (Writer Norman Mailer said she had become “secretary to herself.”) Soon afterward Madonna temporarily withdrew from pop music to concentrate on a film career that had begun with a strong performance in Desperately Seeking Susan (1985), faltered with the flimsy Shanghai Surprise (1986) and uneven Dick Tracy (1990), and recovered with Truth or Dare (1991, also known as In Bed with Madonna), a documentary of her boundary-breaking Blonde Ambition tour, and A League of Their Own (1992). Truth or Dare, in particular, came to be regarded as a seminal music documentary for its honest depiction of life on tour and of Madonna’s maternal relationship with her gay backup dancers. She scored massive success in 1996 with the starring role in the film musical Evita. That year she also gave birth to a daughter, Lourdes Leon, whose father is personal trainer and actor Carlos Leon.\n\nMusic career of the late 1990s and 21st century\n\nIn 1998 Madonna released her first album of new material in four years, Ray of Light. A fusion of techno music and self-conscious lyrics, it was a commercial and critical success, earning the singer her first musical Grammy Awards, among them the award for best pop album (her previous win had been for a video). She won another Grammy the following year, for the song “Beautiful Stranger,” which she cowrote and performed for the movie Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999). Her experimentation in electronica continued with Music (2000). In 2005 she returned to her roots with Confessions on a Dance Floor, which took the Grammy for best electronic/dance album, and produced the hit track “Hung Up.”\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nDespite a marriage in the 1980s to actor Sean Penn and another to English director Guy Ritchie (married 2000; divorced 2008), with whom she had a son, Rocco, Madonna remained resolutely independent. (She also later adopted four children from Malawi: David Banda, Mercy James, Stella, and Estere.) That independent streak, however, did not prevent her from enlisting the biggest names in music to assist on specific projects. This fact was clear on Hard Candy (2008), a hip-hop-infused effort with writing and vocal and production work by Justin Timberlake, Timbaland, and Pharrell Williams of the hit-making duo the Neptunes.\n\nWith MDNA (2012), which features cameos from rappers M.I.A. and Nicki Minaj, Madonna continued to prove herself a shrewd assimilator of cutting-edge musical styles. Rebel Heart (2015), featuring production work by Diplo and Kanye West and guest appearances from Minaj and Chance the Rapper, was an ode to her career. In 2019 Madonna released her 14th studio album, Madame X, which was inspired by her 2017 move to Lisbon, Portugal, and contained music influenced by Latin pop, art pop, and hip-hop.\n\nIn 2008 Madonna was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. That same year she embarked on another the Sticky & Sweet Tour, which broke the record for the highest-grossing concert tour by a female performer, until it was surpassed by Beyoncé and then Taylor Swift in 2023. In 2016 Madonna was honored as Woman of the Year at the Billboard Women in Music event, during which she gave a powerful speech calling out the sexism, misogyny, and, later, ageism she had faced in her career. In 2023 Madonna launched her 12th world tour, the Celebration Tour, a retrospective of her musical legacy. It wrapped up in Rio de Janeiro in May 2024 with a free concert on the beach that was attended by 1.6 million fans, making it the largest standalone concert event in history by a recording artist.\n\nFilm career and projects of the 21st century\n\nIn addition to continuing to act in movies—she also starred in the romantic comedy The Next Best Thing (2000) and in Ritchie’s Swept Away (2002)—Madonna pursued work behind the camera in the 21st century. She cowrote and directed Filth and Wisdom (2008), a comedy about a trio of mismatched flatmates in London, as well as the drama W.E. (2011), which juxtaposed the historical romance between Wallis Simpson and King Edward VIII with the fictional story of a woman in the 1990s researching Simpson’s life. Madonna has also published several children’s picture books, including The English Roses and Mr. Peabody’s Apples (both 2003).\n\nLucy M. O'Brien"
