        "text": "It’s never too late to turn over a new leaf and bow down to the queen. If there was ever one group of the most dedicated superfans, Beyoncé’s BeyHive would be at the top of the list. From recreating Bey’s video choreography to dressing up like her on Halloween to interacting with Bey’s mom, Tina Lawson, on Instagram to defending their queen at any chance, it's safe to say that any member of the Beyhive is a true superfan.\n\nSinger Taylor Swift has been one of the most popular artists over the last decade, and she has her loyal fan base, the Swifties, to thank for it. Since the beginning of her career, she’s been known to thank her fans personally through Tumblr messages, recruit fans to dance with her in music videos and surprise fans at their homes and weddings. There’s something special when artists go out of their way to show appreciation.\n\nHip-hop newcomer Cardi B gained a nice social media following after posting funny videos, and then she became a fan favorite on VH1’s \"Love & Hip Hop: New York.\" Once she left the reality TV show, she started taking her music career to the next level and it skyrocketed. When she started gaining even more popularity, she decided to call her devoted fans, the Bardi Gang.\n\nK-pop boy band BTS has one of the most dedicated fan groups, known as the A.R.M.Y., which stands for “Adorable Representative MC for Youth.” They will not only support fellow fans, but they also will buy BTS concert tickets within minutes after going on sale. The A.R.M.Y. will show up bright and early to wait in line for hours before doors open for a BTS show — dedication at its finest.\n\nTrue fans will support an artist's endeavors until the end of time. Rihanna has made quite a name for herself as a businesswoman over the last few years, but it’s been three years since she released her last album, \"ANTI,\" and her fans, known as the Navy, will continue to ask her about new music until it comes out. Rihanna knows the Navy is patiently anticipating new tunes, but when she does release them, they will be there waiting.\n\nPop sensation Justin Bieber has been winning hearts since his first hit single, “Baby,” crushed the music charts back in 2010. Bieber’s fans, the Beliebers, set streaming records, attend sold-out tours and engage with screaming fans everywhere. It’s been four years since Bieber released his last solo album, and his Beliebers are patiently waiting for his next project.\n\nTrue Katy Perry fans are known as KatyCats. Over the years, Perry has continued to make her fans dreams come true. For example, when she found out that one of her biggest fans couldn’t attend her concert due to brain surgery, Perry visited the fan in the hospital and created an unforgettable moment.\n\nPop sensation Bruno Mars and his fan name started at the beginning of his career. His debut album was titled \"Doo-Wops & Hooligans,\" his band's name is the Hooligans and he eventually decided to give the name to his biggest supporters. The one thing that Bruno can attest to is that his fandom includes supporters of all ages. From toddlers to great-grandparents, these Hooligans will attend his show, singing along to a little “24K Magic.”\n\nLady Gaga is known for being eccentric, flamboyant and creative, and pop fans easily flock to her. Gaga started calling her fans the Little Monsters at her live shows, and the fandom name inspired other artists to follow.\n\nIt was a sad day when the Jonas Brothers decided to break up a few years ago and pursue solo careers. Well, the brothers are finally back as a group, and so Jonatics can breathe once again.\n\nSince Nicki Minaj came onto the scene, she’s been known to have a number of alter-egos such as the Harajuku Barbie. From rocking pink threads to dawning herself in colorful wigs to showcasing her girly-girl personality, this is the alter-ego fans want to be around. It caught on, and Nicki started calling her fans the Barbz. Not only will fans attend her events in similar fashions and wigs, but they also will handle any trolls online who disrespect Nicki’s name and legacy.\n\nChris Brown’s fans are true blue down to the bitter end. Brown is undoubtedly one of the most talented musicians of this generation and although he’s had a lot of ups and downs in his personal life, his fans, known as Team Breezy, continue to stand by him. While the media tries to tear him down, his fans are always by his side.\n\nPop princess Ariana Grande is the girl-next-door who inspires young fans everywhere. Her fan base went through a number of names, such as the Ariana Army and Tiny Elephants, before settling on the Arianators. Grande has been known for getting fans’ opinions on music before officially releasing it to the public and enjoys communicating with her Arianators on a personal level.\n\nOnce Kanye West started discussing his political views over the last few years, it seemed like he lost a connection with some of his fans. However, there are still plenty of them who simply believe in his genius as a musician — the one who gave them \"The College Dropout\" and \"Late Registration\" is still around, and they will argue his contribution to hip-hop any day.\n\nSelena Gomez was once the most followed celebrity on Instagram, and it was all due to her fans known as the Selenators. Although her last solo album was released back in 2015, she continues to be one of the most streamed artists on Spotify.\n\nRapper Eminem may not have a particular name for his fan base, but he gave the world the meaning behind the word “Stan.” A \"Stan\" is basically an obsessive and overzealous fan whom many artists can attest to having encountered in their careers. One thing about Eminem is that it doesn’t matter how long of a hiatus he goes on, once he drops an album, it’s an instant top seller and he has his true fans to thank for it.\n\nDrake is undoubtedly one of the biggest names in hip-hop. If he drops a song, a mixtape, tour announcement or the #InMyFeelingsChallenge, he’s instantly a trending topic. When he recently dropped a project filled with unreleased tracks, not only were fans reminiscing with stories on Twitter, but the album went to No. 1. If Drake is involved, it becomes a movement thanks to his fans.\n\nPop singer Camila Cabello put the world on notice as she became part of the group Fifth Harmony back in 2012. After the group announced Cabello’s departure in 2016, she went on to try her efforts at a solo career, and her fans, known as the Camilizers, showed their support.\n\nBoy band One Direction became a pop heartthrob back in 2010 and went on to be a top-selling act. Although the group has been on a hiatus since 2016, the fans, known as the Directioners, are true believers that the band will return with new music.\n\nJ. Cole is one of the few rappers who personally shows his appreciation for his fans, the Dreamvillians. In the past, he launched his Dollar And A Dream tour, which charged fans only one buck for entrance to his show. He also invited a few fans to his childhood home for an exclusive listening session before releasing his album to the public. Cole is a firm believer in keeping a solid artist-to-fan connection."
