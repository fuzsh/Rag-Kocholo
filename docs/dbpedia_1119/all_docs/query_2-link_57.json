        "text": "Peg Parnevik, Janice, Moonica Mac, Eva Dahlgren, Kayo, Gladys del Pilar, Sharon Dyall and Augustine are some of the artists who will join us at Grand Hôtel on May 21 to celebrate our Laureates!\n\nThe ceremony is broadcast on TV4 Play in Sweden and on Youtube for our international audience, 18:00 CEST.\n\nThe banquet is broadcast live on TV4 at 20:00 CEST.\n\nThis year, Polar Talks invites Laureates Nile Rodgers and Esa-Pekka Salonen together with Merck Mercuriadis, founder of Hipgnosis, for an afternoon of live interviews on May 20.\n\nPolar Talks will be streamed live on Youtube from 16:00 CET on May 20.\n\nThe 2024 Polar Music Prize is awarded to Nile Rodgers from the USA. Dance music has been played for thousands of years. However, there are few in history, if any, who have composed dance music as sophisticated and subtly arranged as Nile Rodgers. It is fitting that his group was named Chic: elegance is part of his musical hallmark. As a composer, producer and guitarist, Nile Rodgers turned disco and funk into an art form. His chop chord style of guitar playing, which he calls chucking, creates a hypnotic swing that has kept millions grooving on the dance floor. The songs created by Nile Rodgers for Chic, Sister Sledge, Diana Ross, David Bowie, Madonna, Daft Punk and many others are so well-crafted that they will outlive us all.\n\nThe 2024 Polar Music Prize is awarded to Esa-Pekka Salonen from Finland. His breakthrough came in 1983 when he conducted Mahler’s Symphony No. 3. As a composer, Esa-Pekka shares many similarities with Gustav Mahler. They have been equally prominent both as conductors and composers, and characterised by the same artistic curiosity. On stage and in the studio, Esa-Pekka Salonen embraces technological innovations, not simply for the sake of experimentation, but as a way to help people discover great music in the constantly changing world of media. Esa-Pekka Salonen is a master of tone in soul and heart. With his resolute baton, he not only guides symphony orchestras but points the way for all classical music."
