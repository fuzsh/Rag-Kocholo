For tickets and information, please visit www.rollingstones.com.\n\n“I’ve been waiting for them to call for sixty years. They finally found my number!” says the legendary Bettye LaVette. Hailed by The New York Times as “one of the great soul interpreters of her generation, Bettye is a soul survivor who burst onto the Detroit scene in 1962, and her latest LP, the Grammy-nominated LaVette!, is her third with producer Steve Jordan. “Bettye LaVette is like a combination of Frank Sinatra, Billie Holiday and Miles Davis,” says Jordan. “When Bettye gets a hold of a song, it becomes her song. It’s like she wrote it. She’s a great messenger.” During what Bettye calls her ‘Fifth Career,’ she has recorded The Stones “Salt of the Earth” (2010) and “Complicated” (2015), and Keith Richards plays guitar on her versions of “It Ain’t Me Babe” (2018) and “Political World” (2018).\n\nThe Rolling Stones are going back on the road with a brand-new tour performing in 16 cities across the U.S. and Canada."
