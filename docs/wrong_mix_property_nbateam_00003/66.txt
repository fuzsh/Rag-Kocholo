Basketball star Steve Nash was named winner of the Lou Marsh Trophy on Thursday.

In May, Nash became the first Canadian to earn the NBA's Most Valuable Player award.

The six-foot-three-inch Phoenix Suns playmaker was only the second point guard to be named MVP by the league in the last 40 years.

Nash, 31, was a unanimous choice for the Lou Marsh. The other nominees were Pittsburgh Penguins rookie Sidney Crosby, diver Alexandre Despatie, curler Randy Ferbey, long-track speed skater Cindy Klassen and soccer player Christine Sinclair.

The award, decided by a panel of sports editors and broadcasters, is given annually to Canada's outstanding athlete by the Toronto Star. It is named after that paper's former sports editor.

Adam van Koeverden, who won a gold and bronze medal in kayaking at the 2004 Athens Olympics, won the award last year.
