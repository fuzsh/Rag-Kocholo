In the 2005-06 NBA season, Steve Nash led the Phoenix Suns to a league-best 54-28 record and was awarded his second consecutive NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) award. However, his second MVP award was met with controversy and debate, as it redefined what it meant to be the league's most valuable player.

At the time, Nash's back-to-back MVP awards made him the first point guard to win the award in consecutive seasons since Magic Johnson in 1989-90. While Nash's impressive statistics were undeniable, with averages of 18.8 points, 10.5 assists, and 4.2 rebounds per game, the question remained: was he truly the most valuable player in the league?

The argument against Nash's MVP candidacy centered around the fact that he played on a team that emphasized an up-tempo, high-scoring offense, which inflated his statistics and made him appear more valuable than he actually was. Critics pointed to other players who had similarly impressive numbers, but played on teams with inferior records, such as Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers, who averaged 35.4 points per game, or LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers, who put up 31.4 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 6.6 assists per game.

However, Nash's supporters argued that his impact on the Suns went beyond just his statistics. Nash's ability to control the pace of the game and set up his teammates for easy baskets was crucial to the Suns' success, and his leadership and unselfish play were integral to the team's chemistry. The Suns were also one of the most exciting teams to watch, and Nash's style of play was a major factor in that.

Despite the controversy surrounding his second MVP award, Nash's impact on the NBA cannot be denied. His unselfish style of play and emphasis on ball movement and team play inspired a new generation of players, and his success as a two-time MVP paved the way for other nontraditional MVP candidates, such as Russell Westbrook and James Harden, who have won the award in recent years despite not leading their teams to the best record in the league.

Looking back, it is clear that Nash's second MVP award was a pivotal moment in NBA history, as it redefined what it meant to be the league's most valuable player. While the debate over his candidacy will continue, Nash's impact on the game and his legacy as one of the greatest point guards of all time are undeniable.
