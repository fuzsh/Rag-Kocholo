        "text": "25 high school students surprised with scholarships during El Valle Puede Celebration\n\nPHOENIX – In a tip-off celebration honoring the achievements of this year’s high school graduates, Helios Education Foundation and the Phoenix Suns/Phoenix Mercury Foundation awarded 25 scholarships to Arizona high school seniors of Latino heritage. Many of these scholarship recipients will be first-generation college students, and they all plan to attend an Arizona university or community college.\n\nThe students were honored alongside more than 1,000 soon-to-be high school graduates across Arizona at the El Valle Puede Celebration to tip-off Arizona Decision Day at Footprint Center on Monday. Arizona Decision Day, which extends through graduation this year, empowers students to take charge of their futures by making plans beyond high school, whether it’s college, trade school, military, or the workforce.\n\n“Arizona Decision Day is an opportunity to recognize the determination and commitment of our high school seniors as they embark on the next chapter of their lives,” said Vince Roig, founding chairman of the Helios Education Foundation Board of Directors. “We commend their dedication and celebrate their future endeavors.”\n\nFunded by a $1 million grant from Helios Education Foundation, El Valle Puede scholarships will be awarded over the next five years. The 25 scholars recognized today come from high schools across the state with a demonstrated financial need, receiving a total of $350,000 in scholarships.\n\nDuring the event, Governor Katie Hobbs addressed students through a video message, expressing her support and recognition for Arizona Decision Day.\n\nArizona Decision Day this year is of particular importance due to challenges arising from the overhaul of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), causing delays in students’ post-high school decisions. Kicking off Decision Day now is essential to ensure students have adequate time to make informed decisions about their postsecondary options.\n\n“I am full of hope and happiness for all graduating seniors and the future that awaits them,” said Arizona Board of Regent Chair Cecilia Mata. “As a first-generation college student and immigrant to the United States, my education was the cornerstone of my career and success. On behalf of the board, I congratulate all Arizona seniors and extend the best wishes for the future as they pursue their dreams.”\n\nFor more information about Arizona Decision Day and ways that high school principals, counselors, teachers, and others can celebrate the graduating Class of 2024, visit College Ready AZ’s website.\n\nIf you’d like to schedule an interview with one of the scholars, contact Griselda Zetino via cell (480) 734-8083 or email gzetino@helios.org"
