        "text": "Jul 13, 2024; Las Vegas, NV, USA; Fans walk outside the Thomas & Mack Center before the start of an NBA Summer League game between the Portland Trailblazers and the San Antonio Spurs. Mandatory Credit: Stephen R. Sylvanie-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Indiana Pacers and Phoenix Suns battle it out in NBA Summer League action Tuesday evening at 4 p.m. ET on ESPNU.\n\nNeither the Suns nor the Pacers have won a game at the Las Vegas Summer League yet. Phoenix fell to Golden State while the Pacers have fallen to Minnesota and Brooklyn.\n\nSee the Indiana Pacers vs. Phoenix Suns odds, picks, and predictions for Summer League play on Tuesday.\n\nBoth the Phoenix Suns and Indiana Pacers are still searching for their first NBA Summer League win Tuesday afternoon at 4 p.m. ET on ESPNU. The Pacers fell in close games to Brooklyn and Minnesota while Phoenix struggled mightily with Golden State in their lone showing.\n\nBelow you can find the latest odds for tonight’s matchup, as well as a look at the top players, rosters for both teams and a prediction.\n\nIndiana Pacers vs. Phoenix Suns Odds\n\nThe Pacers are considered moderate favorites for tonight’s matchup in Las Vegas, owning a -5.5 line on Caesars. Indiana sits at -210 to win outright with Phoenix sitting at +175. As mentioned earlier, both these teams are still searching for their first win in Las Vegas.\n\nThe Over/Under for this matchup has been set at 178.5 according to Caesars, a number the Pacers have surpassed twice but Phoenix has fell short of in their respective Summer League contests. The Pacers have scored 90+ in both previous games while Phoenix failed to crack 75 in their loss to Golden State.\n\nOdds as of July 16 at Caesars (Code: SBD1000). Check out the top NBA betting apps for 2024 Summer League.\n\nJohhny Furphy, Tristen Newton, David Roddy Highlight Players to Watch\n\nAdmittedly, there are Summer League matchups with more firepower on the docket for Tuesday evening.\n\nJohnny Furphy and Tristen Newton should be able to put on a show by themselves for Indiana, though. The Pacers draft picks out of Kansas and UConn respectively have played well to start their NBA careers, especially Furphy. He dropped 18 points with 7 rebounds, 2 steals and 2 blocks against the Timberwolves. Newton struggled to score against Minnesota but flashed his playmaking potential with 7 assists.\n\nHere’s a full look at Indiana’s Summer League unit:\n\nPhoenix’s squad, I’m sorry to say, is among the worst in the Summer League. Their 2 draft picks, Oso Ighodaro and Ryan Dunn, combined for just 12 points, 9 rebounds and 2 assists in Game 1, though they did both perform well on the defensive end.\n\nDavid Roddy (12) and Michael Devoe (19) led the way for the Suns in their first outing, though Phoenix was only able to score 73 points in total. Also on the roster is former Northwestern star Boo Buie and veteran Quinndary Weatherspoon.\n\nPacers vs. Suns Picks & Predictions\n\nI’m picking Indiana against the spread in this matchup and it’s frankly one of the easier decisions I’ve had to make in recent weeks.\n\nI’m just not sure about this Suns roster, and though the Pacers have lost both games they’ve been right there the entire way. Not to mention, Indiana has had no problem scoring with multiple different options and I’m not quite sure who will lead the Suns in that department.\n\nRyan Dunn and Oso Ighodaro are defense-first players for the Suns. Boo Buie, who could provide some spark on offense, was noticeably absent in the Suns’ first summer league game. Michael Devoe or David Roddy might need to have a 20+ point night for Phoenix to make this interesting.\n\nPHX vs. IND picks:"
