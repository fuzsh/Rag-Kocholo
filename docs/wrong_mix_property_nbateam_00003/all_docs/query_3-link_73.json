        "text": "As the 2024 NBA playoffs get underway, the league's standout players from the past season will be individually honored for their accomplishments over the coming weeks.\n\nFollow our tracker below to see who takes home 2023-24 NBA MVP, Most Improved Player, Defensive Player of the Year, Coach of the Year and more!\n\nNikola Jokić wins 3rd NBA MVP award in 4 seasons | Undisputed\n\n[2024 NBA Playoff Bracket: Updated schedule, scores, standings]\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMost Valuable Player: Nikola Jokic, Denver Nuggets\n\nJokic has secured third MVP over the past four seasons, cementing his status as one of the defining basketball superstars of his era. The Nuggets big man turned in another spectacular season after winning his first NBA title last year, tying his career high with 26.4 points per game to go along with 12.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists per game, one assist shy of a averaging a triple-double.\n\nJokic is now the ninth NBA player to win at least three MVP awards in league history. He joins Magic Johnson, Larry Bird and Moses Malone with three MVP wins, with only LeBron James (4), Wilt Chamberlain (4), Bill Russell (5), Michael Jordan (5) and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (6) ahead of them.\n\nJokic also joins Abdul-Jabbar, Russell, Chamberlain, James, Johnson and Bird as the only players to win three NBA MVPs in a four-year span.\n\nDefensive Player of the Year: Rudy Gobert, Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nThis marks the fourth time the 31-year-old Gobert has won the honor and first since the blockbuster trade that sent him to Minnesota from the Utah Jazz in 2022. Gobert bounced back this past season to average 12.1 total rebounds and 2.1 blocks per game after both of those averages took dips last year.\n\nHis return to dominance in the interior came as 22-year-old teammate Anthony Edwards broke out as a superstar guard, and the two along with fellow star big man Karl-Anthony Towns have led the Timberwolves to the second round of the postseason for the first time in 20 years. Gobert is now the oldest player to win this award, and he is now tied with Hall of Famers Dikembe Mutombo and Ben Wallace for the most Defensive Player of the Year awards in NBA history.\n\nRookie of the Year: Victor Wembanyama, San Antonio Spurs\n\nWembanyama finished his rookie season averaging 21.4 points, 10.6 rebounds, 3.9 assists and 3.6 blocks per game in 71 starts. The 7-foot-4 power forward became just the fourth player, and first rookie, to finish a season with at least 1,500 points, 250 assists and 250 blocked shots as he began to deliver on the hype that made him one of the most anticipated draft picks in professional sports history.\n\nThe No. 1 overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft was a massive betting favorite to win the Rookie of the Year before the season at -145. Wembanyama received all 99 first-place votes, making him the first unanimous NBA Rookie of the Year since Karl-Anthony Towns in the 2015-16 season. He is the first international winner of the award since Dallas’ Luka Doncic in 2019 and the fifth such winner in the last 10 seasons.\n\nCoach of the Year: Mark Daigneault, Oklahoma City Thunder\n\nDaigneault was promoted from head coach of the Thunder's G-League affiliate in 2020, tasked with shepherding a young, rebuilding Oklahoma City team. That rebuild paid off in a major way this past season, as the Thunder finished with a 57-20 record and secured the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference.\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander cemented his status as one of the best players in the NBA — becoming an MVP finalist — second-year players Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams took a major leap in the frontcourt, and fellow starters Lu Dort and Josh Giddey continued to show off their two-way abilities under Daigneault's tutelage. All five regular Thunder starters averaged double-digit points per game during the regular season.\n\nClutch Player of the Year: Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors\n\nThe 10-time NBA All-Star and four-time NBA champion finished first in points (189), made field goals (59) and made 3-pointers (32) in the clutch this season, defined by the NBA as the last five minutes of a game in which the score is within five points.\n\nCurry shot 49.6% from the field and 45.7% from 3-point range in these scenarios, and the Warriors were 23-20 with him in the lineup.\n\nIn February, the two-time NBA MVP became the first player to reach 3,600 career 3-pointers. The 36-year-old will join Team USA men's basketball this summer in Paris for his Olympic debut.\n\nSixth Man of the Year: Naz Reid, Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nNaz Reid flourished off the bench for the Minnesota Timberwolves this season, averaging 13.5 points, 5.2 rebounds and 1.3 assists per game — all career-highs — in 24.2 minutes per game. Reid also notably shot 41.4% from 3-point range on 5.0 attempts per game. A little less than half of his field goal attempts came from beyond the arc.\n\nReid beat out Sacramento Kings guard Malik Monk for the award. Monk was the betting favorite to win at -280, followed by Reid at +230. Monk led the league in points off of the bench with 15.4 PPG.\n\nMost Improved Player: Tyrese Maxey, Philadelphia 76ers\n\nFollowing the Sixers' trade of James Harden to the Clippers in October 2023, Maxey quickly became the No. 2 scorer on the team behind reigning league MVP Joel Embiid while also blossoming into his role as Philadelphia's starting point guard. The 23-year-old former first-round pick out of Kentucky was named to his first All-Star game in February, and averaged 25.9 points, 6.2 assists and 3.7 rebounds per game in the 2023-24 regular season.\n\nMaxey, who was +1100 in betting odds to win the Most Improved Player award before the season, has three 50-plus point games in his career, with his latest being a 52-point performance in April against the San Antonio Spurs. He finished the season averaging 25.9 points and 6.2 assists per game, helping the Sixers reach the playoffs again as the No. 7 seed after beating the Miami Heat in the play-in tournament.\n\n[Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?
