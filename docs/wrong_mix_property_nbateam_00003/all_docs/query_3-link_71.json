        "text": "For the third time in four seasons, Nikola Jokic has won the MVP.\n\nAnd at the same time, Jokic has been given the expected treatment of success fatigue, a natural ailment for most successful athletes, coaches or teams in the four major sports.\n\nThe alternative argument was made last year, which saw Joel Embiid win the award to prevent a three-peat from Jokic.\n\nBut in 2024, it was a toss up between Jokic, Luka Doncic, and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, and the numbers speak for themselves.\n\nJokic:\n\n17 WS | 79 G | 26.4 PPG | .583 FG% | .359 3P%| 12.4 TBR | 9.0 AST | 926 MVP Points\n\nGilgeous-Alexander:\n\n14.6 WS | 75 G | 30.1 PPG | .535 FG% | .353 3P%| 5.5 TBR | 6.2 AST | 640 MVP Points\n\nDoncic:\n\n12 WS | 70 G | 33.9 PPG | .487 FG% | .382 3P%| 9.2 TBR | 9.8 AST | 566 MVP Points\n\nBut, numbers only tell part of the story. So here is an argument in favor for the Joker joining elite company.\n\nIn the 2020-2021 season, Nikola Jokic hoisted the MVP trophy for the first time in his young career. Despite receiving MVP votes in the two seasons prior, it felt like the national media was finally appreciating the soon-to-be best player in the world.\n\nHowever, Jokic’s best year being in the shadows of the Covid season may have limited the appreciation to where he then ranked in the landscape of NBA superstars.\n\nSo when he followed it up with an even better season in 2021, becoming just the 12th player in NBA history to win back-to-back MVPs, he had officially announced himself as the best in basketball.\n\nBut by the following season, the fans of the Association were ready for a new face of the league.\n\nThis being paired with a “step-back” for the Jokic expectations, only averaging 25/12/9 in 69 games, allowed the writers to vote for Embiid. This was a welcome change, but Embiid is not a universally-beloved player.\n\nDoncic and SGA are, so NBA fans were none too pleased to see the big man win it again.\n\nHowever, similar to the Embiid MVP season, if the decision was truly neck-and-neck, Jokic would be the odd-man out for the sake of parody.\n\nBut thanks to these three factors, Jokic separated himself enough to be deemed the best.\n\nFor one, Jokic managed to improve the Nuggets’ regular season record by two wins despite having a lesser supporting cast than in 2023.\n\nThe starting rotation stayed the same over the past two years, but the loss of Bruce Brown was felt from the secondary unit. Reggie Jackson had to step up into the six-man role, while players like Christian Braun and Peyton Watson did not fill the needs of the role players like Bones Hyland were in their championship season.\n\nThis forced Jokic to do more throughout the regular year, which is his second factor for being named the best in the NBA.\n\nThis year, Jokic posted career-highs in minutes per game with 34.6 a night, and played one game less than his career-high set in 2018. In a gauntlet of a Western Conference, Jokic needed to do more during the regular season this year.\n\nAnd while it was still not enough to obtain the #1 seed, it still adds a feather in the cap for Jokic’s resume.\n\nThe Nuggets finished tied with the Oklahoma City Thunder for the best record in the West, while the Dallas Mavericks finished 5th in the Western Conference, just 7 games back of the #1 seed.\n\nWhile this initially seems like a point in favor of SGA deserving the MVP, if you look deeper in the numbers throughout the year, Jokic bringing the Nuggets this close to the #1 seed is more impressive than it seems.\n\nFor one, the youthful Thunder team had significant injury luck all season, as 4 of their 5 starters played over 75 games, with Jalen Williams playing the least at 71.\n\nDenver was without number 2 option Jamal Murray for 23 games this year, where the team went 13-10. Jokic averaged 28.1 points per game in these games, with a +/- of +123.\n\nRegardless of where you stand on the debate, any of the three would be a good option.\n\nAt the same time, the run that Jokic is on right now should not be taken lightly, even if you do not believe that he was the most valuable in 2023-24.\n\nJokic has done all he has in his career before turning 30. He is currently on pace to surpass 29,000 career points, 14,000 rebounds and 9,000 assists, even if he only plays 9 more seasons.\n\nWhile the list of young players turning into superstars is what makes this sport so great, and the idea of another young player adding career accolades while on their first contract turns journalists into creative writers.\n\nHowever, the appreciation of SGA and Luka’s career-years can coincide with Jokic’s masterpiece of a campaign, which was a back-and-forth debate online, but according to the votes were not as tight."
