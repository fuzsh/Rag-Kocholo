        "text": "Newly Named Foundation Awards First Series of Grants to Nonprofit Organizations in Arizona\n\nPHOENIX – The Phoenix Suns and Phoenix Mercury today announced the rebranding of Phoenix Suns Charities to Phoenix Suns/Phoenix Mercury Foundation. The newly renamed foundation, which recognizes both the Suns and Mercury’s community efforts, will award its first series of significant grants to seven nonprofit organizations in Arizona.\n\n“Phoenix Suns/Phoenix Mercury Foundation celebrates the positive impact both the Suns and Mercury teams make on and off the court,” said Sarah Krahenbuhl, executive director of Phoenix Suns/Phoenix Mercury Foundation. “These grants will support our community partners and provide the resources to make a difference in the lives of children across Arizona.”\n\nThe selected organizations represent Phoenix Suns/Phoenix Mercury Foundation’s mission to use the platform of basketball to support, strengthen and bring together the diverse communities across Arizona.\n\nThe grant recipients are:\n\nJunior Achievement of Arizona: For more than 60 years, the organization has prepared Arizona students to succeed in work and life with JA BizTown, a hands-on program that introduces 4th, 5th, and 6th graders to economic concepts, workplace skills, and personal and business finances in a student-sized town built just for them. With support from Phoenix Suns/Phoenix Mercury Foundation, the first-ever Suns and Mercury space will open at JA BizTown where students will put their skills to work at the on-site learning “city” amongst 40 different businesses and industries.\n\nMath Hoops: A dynamic learning experience that leverages the game of basketball and the NBA/WNBA brands to develop algebra readiness and social-emotional competency and features physical and digital basketball-themed games, a mobile app, classroom curricula and a community event series. The impact of the Phoenix Suns/Phoenix Mercury Foundation grant will be extended thanks to the generosity of longtime partner, Annexus, who is matching the grant to help the program reach approximately 5,000 students across Arizona this year.\n\nMarcus Graham Project (MGP): Through iCR8™ programs, MGP’s goal is to provide diverse aspirants in the field of marketing and media, with the exposure and experience necessary to solidify careers within the industry. The Phoenix Suns/Phoenix Mercury Foundation grant will support a five-day workshop to provide diverse professionals with networking, training and exposure to the Suns and Mercury brands to further their career interests within the advertising, media and marketing industry.\n\nPositive Coaching Alliance: The nonprofit provides research-based training and resources for coaches, parents, athletes and leaders to ensure a positive youth development experience for all kids in all sports. Support from Phoenix Suns/Phoenix Mercury Foundation will fund services and help offset the cost of workshop programming for basketball-specific organizations over the next year.\n\nSolano’s No Limit Hoops: Solano’s No Limit Hoops creates a safe and accessible environment for disadvantaged youth to play basketball and learn leadership qualities. The grant supports program costs including gym rentals, equipment and apparel.\n\nSpecial Olympics Arizona: Phoenix Suns/Phoenix Mercury Foundation’s funding will support Special Olympics Arizona’s mission to provide year-round sports training and athletic competition in a variety of Olympic-type sports for children and adults with intellectual disabilities. The year-round support offers basketball athletes continuing opportunities to develop physical fitness, demonstrate courage, experience joy and participate in a sharing of gifts, skills, and friendship with their families, other Special Olympics athletes and the community.\n\nUMOM New Day Centers: UMOM provides shelter, services and affordable housing for single women and families experiencing homelessness in the Metro Phoenix area. The Phoenix Suns/Phoenix Mercury Foundation grant will fund the repair of a full basketball court at its downtown Phoenix facility.\n\nPhoenix Suns/Phoenix Mercury Foundation has donated more than $43 million in its 35-year history and positively impacts more than 400,000 children annually through hundreds of Suns and Mercury player appearances, volunteer opportunities and by hosting numerous community events throughout Arizona.\n\nTo learn more about Phoenix Suns/Phoenix Mercury Foundation, visit Suns.com/Foundation.\n\nFor more off-the-court news and updates on the Suns and Mercury’s community efforts, follow @phxoffcourt on Instagram."
