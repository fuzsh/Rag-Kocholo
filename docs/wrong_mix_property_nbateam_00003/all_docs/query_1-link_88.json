        "text": "It's expected to be the closest most valuable player vote in NBA history, and when the ballots are counted up, Canadian Steve Nash of the Phoenix Suns could be the winner.\n\nRELATED: Steve Nash bio\n\n<>>\n\nThe official announcement will be made Sunday afternoon.\n\nRELATED:\n\nThe ESPN report isn't a complete surprise â€“ Nash and O'Neal have been among the favourites to win the NBA's top player honour since the beginning of the season, plus the league's office has been a virtual leaky balloon of information about its year-end awards.\n\nReports earlier this week revealed Ben Wallace of the Detroit Pistons would win the defensive player of the year, Ben Gordon of the Chicago Bulls would capture the sixth man award and Emeka Okafor of the Charlotte Bobcats would win rookie of the year.\n\nAll of the leaks were spot on.\n\nShould this \"report\" ring true, Nash would be the first Canadian to capture NBA MVP honours.\n\nHe would also be just the third point guard in more than four decades to win the league's most-coveted individual prize. Magic Johnson and Oscar Robertson are the others.\n\nThe ESPN report follows up an earlier poll conducted by the Arizona Republic newspaper Friday, which indicated Nash held a slim lead over O'Neal for the league's MVP award.\n\nThe Republic surveyed 106 of the 127 writers and broadcasters who voted for this year's NBA MVP award and found that Nash had 53 first-place votes while Shaq had 51 votes. The other two votes went to Phoenix power forward Amare Stoudemire and San Antonio Spurs centre Tim Duncan.\n\nNash made an immediate impact with the Suns since joining the club in the off-season from the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nWith Nash running the point, the Suns made an alarming 33-win improvement from last season and went from being out of the playoffs in 2003-04 to the Western Conference's top regular-season team in 2004-05.\n\nThe six-foot-three-inch, 195-pound all-star is the spark plug of the Suns' run-and-gun offence, which led the NBA in most points per game this year. Not only is Nash having the best season of his career (league-leader in assists per game with 11.5 and total assists with 861), but he's also helped elevate the games of teammates Stoudemire and Shawn Marion.\n\nO'Neal, meanwhile, brought his seven-foot-one-inch frame from the Los Angeles Lakers to the Heat in the off-season, which many basketball people predicted would bring star power and respect back to the Eastern Conference.\n\nThe experts were right. O'Neal found himself at home in the East, providing his usual dominance under the hoop and giving the Heat another scoring threat outside of dynamic guard Dwyane Wade.\n\nWith O'Neal in the lineup this season, the Heat made a 17-win improvement from last year and claimed the Eastern Conference crown.\n\nWhile Nash edged O'Neal by a whisker in the Republic's poll, the newspaper speculated the timing of Sunday's MVP announcement could mean Nash is the out-right winner.\n\nThere's history to support that speculation. The NBA awarded the previous five MVPs when the winner was off, and on a day before each had a playoff game.\n\nNash and the Suns are expected to start their second-round playoff series Monday, while the Heat are scheduled for a Sunday start depending on the outcome of the Washington-Chicago game Friday.\n\nThe last MVP to not receive the award the day before a playoff game was Karl Malone in 1999 when his Utah Jazz were already eliminated."
