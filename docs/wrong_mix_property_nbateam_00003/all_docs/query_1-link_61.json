        "text": "NBA legend Steve Nash is one of the best players to ever play the game of basketball. During his prime years, Nash battled it out with multiple superstars and the late Kobe Bryant was one of his biggest rivals. Bryant has won 5 NBA titles with the Los Angeles Lakers. During his illustrious career, he has won multiple individual accolades as well. But Bryant has won the regular season MVP only once in 2008.\n\nSteve Nash had won the 2004-05 MVP award playing for the Phoenix Suns. And it raised a few eyebrows because Nash’s scoring average was just 15.5 points. The next year was even more controversial.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nDespite putting up legendary numbers, Kobe Bryant failed to win the 2005-06 season MVP award to Steve Nash. And the Suns’ legend became back-to-back NBA MVP.\n\nIn spite of their battles, Kobe Bryant and Steve Nash came together as Nash joined the Lakers in 2012. While their partnership on the court didn’t materialize, it paid off the court. As per reports, Bryant helped Nash with his investments.\n\nREAD MORE – When A Young Steve Nash Compared His Impact With Michael Jordan Even After Getting Booed On His NBA Draft Night\n\nNash reportedly earned $144 million in NBA salaries and Bryant helped him with his ideas. The two discussed entrepreneurship and various ventures. Some of Nash’s best investments are Vancouver Whitecaps, Meathawk- a film production company, RCD Mallorca – a Spanish Soccer team, and Bullish – a venture fund and creative agency.\n\nNBA career of Steve Nash\n\nThe Phoenix Suns drafted Steve Nash as the 15th pick in the 1996 NBA draft. The Canadian barely made any impact in his rookie season as he averaged just 3.3 points and 2.1 assists per game. And his struggles continued in the next season as well, even though he showed some improvement.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nSo the Suns decided to trade him to the Dallas Mavericks in 1998. He only started 11 games for the Suns. But the Mavs gave him the much-needed game time for his development. In his first season for the Mavs, Nash started all 40 games he played. Next season, his minutes took a small hit, but he showed improvement.\n\nThen the third season was his breakout season. He started all 70 games he played that season. And Nash averaged double digits in points for the first time in his career. He averaged 15.6 points and 7.3 rebounds per game. He almost doubled his scoring average from the previous season.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nWATCH THIS STORY – Giannis Antetokounmpos Family: All you need to know about his wife and two kids\n\nThere was no looking back from there as he rose to NBA stardom. Even though he didn’t win an NBA title as a player, he was a great player. And his back-to-back MVP award is no easy feat. Furthermore, he has won two NBA titles as a player development consultant for the Golden State Warriors in 2017 and 2018."
