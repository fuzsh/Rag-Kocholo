        "text": "Internal basketball team award\n\nThe Ring of Honor is an award given to prominent players and employees of the professional basketball team, the Phoenix Suns of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Awardees are selected to recognize the significant role the individual has had for the Suns organization (not specifically their prominence in the NBA). While Phoenix retired numbers early in the franchise's history, recent players inducted into the Ring of Honor had their names and numbers displayed at the Suns' home arena, Footprint Center, but the numbers could be reused in the future.[1][2] However, beginning in the 2023–24 season, under new owner Mat Ishbia, the Suns resumed retiring jersey numbers on the Ring of Honor starting with No. 31 for Shawn Marion and No. 32 for Amar'e Stoudemire. Numbers who were previously deemed \"honored\" by the franchise were once again considered retired.[3]\n\nThe Ring of Honor was opened on April 18, 1999. Tom Chambers was honored that day, joined by Connie Hawkins, Dick Van Arsdale, Alvan Adams, Paul Westphal and Walter Davis, who were moved from the Banners for Retired Numbers section at then-named America West Arena into the new ring. At the time, the Suns' Tom Gugliotta was already wearing No. 24, Chambers' former number, and would be the last player to date to wear the number.[4] In 2001, Phoenix added Kevin Johnson to the ring while also making an exception and retiring his No. 7.[5] Since Johnson's number retirement, former athletic trainer Joe Proski, Dan Majerle, Charles Barkley, former coach Cotton Fitzsimmons, former team owner and general manager Jerry Colangelo, Steve Nash, and broadcaster Al McCoy were also honored by the Suns, though the numbers for Barkley, Majerle, and Nash were only honored and not officially considered retired numbers at the time. However, with the Phoenix Suns Ring of Honor being \"reimagined\" and unveiled with permanent banners and murals once again on October 28, 2023, the numbers worn by Barkley, Chambers, Majerle, and Nash are considered properly retired.[6] Shawn Marion joined the Ring of Honor on December 15, 2023,[7] while Amar'e Stoudemire's #32 joined on March 2, 2024.[8]\n\nKey * Retired number[9][10] Inducted to the Basketball Hall of Fame\n\nInductees[9] Honoree Jersey No. Position Tenure Initial Date of Honor/Jersey retired Notes Alvan Adams 33* C 1975–1988 November 9, 1988 Played entire career as a Sun, NBA Rookie of the Year, Phoenix's career leader in games played (988), minutes played (27,203), rebounds (6,937) and steals (1,289) Charles Barkley 34* F 1992–1996 March 20, 2004 One of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA history; Hall of Famer; gold medalist with the Dream Team at the 1992 Olympics; won the NBA MVP award in 1993 and led Suns to NBA Finals the same year; is an Emmy award winning broadcaster for the NBA on TNT Tom Chambers 24* F 1988–1993 April 18, 1999 Four-time NBA All-Star (three as a Sun); works in Suns community relations; is a broadcaster for Suns games Jerry Colangelo — GM, coach, owner, executive 1968–2004 November 4, 2007 Four-time NBA Executive of the Year, Hall of Famer, youngest general manager in US professional sports Walter Davis 6* G 1977–1988 April 3, 1994 Gold Medalist at the 1976 Olympics, NBA Rookie of the Year (1978), Phoenix's all-time leading scorer (15,666), six-time NBA All-Star Cotton Fitzsimmons — Coach 1970–1972, 1988–1992, 1996 March 18, 2005 Suns head coach with a 341–208 record, two times NBA Coach of the Year (with Suns, 1988–89 season), Missouri Basketball Hall of Famer, National Junior College Hall of Famer, Missouri Sports Hall of Famer Connie Hawkins 42* F 1969–1973 November 19, 1976 American Basketball League's MVP (1962), Harlem Globetrotter (1964–66), American Basketball Association champion (1967's Pittsburgh Pipers), Hall of Famer, worked in Suns community relations until his death in 2017.
