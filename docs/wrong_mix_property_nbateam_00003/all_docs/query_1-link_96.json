        "text": "The Suns inducted Steve Nash into the organization’s Ring of Honor on Friday, a recognition bestowed upon influential front-office executives, coaches and players throughout the team’s history. Nash, who formally announced his retirement in March at 41, was honored at halftime of Phoenix’s 110–92 home victory over Portland.\n\nThe two-time MVP and future Hall of Famer joined former Suns players Alvin Adams, Charles Barkley, Tom Chambers, Water Davis, Connie Hawkins, Kevin Johnson, Dan Majerle, Dick Van Arsdale and Paul Westphal as Ring of Honor members. Nash was drafted by the Suns in ’96 and spent two seasons in Phoenix before he was traded to the Mavericks. He later returned in ’04 and guided the “Seven Seconds or Less” Suns to the Western Conference finals three times before he was traded to the Lakers in ’12. All told, Nash ranked third in games played, first in assists and seventh in points in Suns franchise history.\n\nThe Ring of Honor ceremony was highlighted by a speech from Nash, who joked that he was given “a lot of drinks” as soon as he received the microphone. He went on to thank former coaches Mike D’Antoni and Alvin Gentry, his parents, his children, his former Suns teammates, and the Suns’ well-regarded training staff.\n\n• Week in Review: Best plays and more | Suns wear Nash Stance socks\n\n“I love being a part of a team,” Nash said. “I love being a teammate. I love building something. I love putting the pieces together. I love thinking, ‘I’m not very good at this, but I am good at this, so what can I do to help you be better at this.’ Trying to find a way to make it all work, to encourage and support and be creative and try to figure out how to make this thing better than it looks. My teammates were amazing, they were incredible.”\n\nA banner bearing Nash’s last name, his face and his jersey No. 13 was unveiled by the Suns’ Gorilla mascot at the conclusion of Nash’s speech, which ran 13 minutes long and delayed the start of the second half.\n\nSome of Nash’s other notable lines included ...\n\nOn his mother: “She is tough as nails. ... I could never p--- out on anything because I know my mom would give me the side eye.”\n\nOn his young children: “I wish they could have seen me do my thing. But they’ll have to go to YouTube.”\n\n​On his teammates: “When people ask me about my career and what I remember, I remember the locker room, the plane, the cold tub, the weight room, the bus, dinners on the road. That’s what I remember. I don’t remember the baskets or the series.”\n\nOn the Suns’ training staff: \"They took care of me day after day after day. ... I wanted to punch their lights out every five seconds but at the same time wanted to hug them the next minute. They took amazing care of me and I’m so grateful. They’re teammates.”\n\n• JENKINS: Nash’s overflowing legacy | Numbers validate Nash’s career\n\nOn the Suns’ fans: “I feel like I’m in my living room right now. ... The biggest thing I want to say is that you guys are the best. The fans you supported me, loved me, we went through bad times together, great times together. It’s incredible to think you guys up there on the top shelf, you couldn’t even tell what my number was, you would come out every game, the arena was always sold out, it was always loud, you’d always be in jerseys. For you guys to make that commitment, I will never, ever, ever be able to tell you how much that meant to me. You really touched me.”\n\n​On his fellow Ring of Honor members: “Squad! ... I think of them like my idols.”\n\nOn Charles Barkley: “I’m not as good of a speechmaker as the Chuckster. I wasn’t as good of a basketball player as the Chuckster either.”\n\nOn his lasting friendships: “I had incredible friends that supported me and were there for me. They would come and watch me play all over the place, get in fights with fans in other arenas. They really motivated me. Two of my buddies were flying to Sacramento to see this playoff series, and they were going to get really drunk and cause a lot of problems. I appreciated that.”\n\nPhotos: Classic shots of Steve Nash\n\nRare Photos of Steve Nash\n\ncirca 1975\n\nThe two-time NBA MVP was born in Johannesburg, South Africa on Feb. 7, 1974.\n\n1980s\n\nHis father played professional soccer and the family lived in a number of places before setting in Victoria City near Vancouver.\n\n1980s\n\nLike most Canadian boys, Nash quickly fell in love with hockey. His favorite team was the Vancouver Canucks and his favorite player was Wayne Gretzky. He also played lacrosse and rugby, but didn't discover basketball until the eighth grade.\n\n1995\n\nThough he was one of the top basketball players in Canada, Nash was not highly regarded as a recruit. The only scholarship offer he received was to Santa Clara, on the condition that Nash improve his suspect defense.\n\n1995\n\nNash was an immediate hit on the court, leading Santa Clara to its first NCAA Tournament appearance in five years. The No. 15 Broncos upset Arizona in the first round before losing to Temple the following game. Despite the loss, Nash had Santa Clara on the national radar. He would lead the team to two more tournament appearances over the next three years as he garnered a reputation as one of the nation's top point guards.\n\n1996\n\nNash was selected by Phoenix with the 15th pick in the first round. He was considered the best pure point guard in the draft, compared to the natural scorers like Allen Iverson and Stephon Marbury, who were also listed at the position.\n\n1997\n\nNash also competed for the Canadian National Team, culminating in the team's appearance at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. He also captained the team in 2004, but it did not qualify for an Olympic spot. In this photo, Nash drives around Cuba's Yudi Abreu during a Tournament of the Americas game in Montevideo, Uruguay.\n\n2001\n\nAfter two mediocre seasons in Phoenix, Nash was traded to Dallas for Martin Muursepp, Bubba Wells, Pat Garrity and a first-round draft pick. The Mavs struggled at first, but the drafting of Dirk Nowitzki and the acquisition of Michael Finley and Juwan Howard turned the Mavericks into contenders.
