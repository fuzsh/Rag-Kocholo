        "text": "Kobe Bryant (born August 23, 1978) is a famous professional NBA basketball player and is one of the game's greatest scorers. Kobe has won five NBA championships with the Lakers and is an 18-time all star champion, 15-time member of the All-NBA Team and 12-time member of the ALL-Defensive team. In the NBA, Kobe Bryant holds the record for the most seasons played for one franchise for an entire career. In 2002 Kobe had a lot of friends such as one member of the team, Shaquille O'Neal, who was traded to the Miami Heat in 2004, after losing the 2004 NBA finals. That's when Kobe stepped up and became a new leader, he led the NBA in scoring a career high of 81 points in a single game, against the\n\nMost people know him as an 11 time NBA Champion, 5 time MVP, 12-time All-Star and he were the centerpieces of the Celtics dynasty during his 13-year career. Bill Russell ended up as the most successful player in the history of the NBA and formed the centerpiece of the greatest dynasty in the history of the league. For his accomplishments in the Civil Rights Movement on and off the court, Barack Obama awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011. Bill was outstanding at everything he ever put his mind to. For all that he accomplished on and off the field, Bill Russell is definitely one of the all-time great players of Basketball.\n\nThe Boston Celtics had 29 wins the season before they drafted Bird. The team improved by 32 games to go 61-21 in Bird's first season. The main reason they won so many more games was because of Larry Bird. Bird was not just a shooter, he was also a great passer and rebounder too, which in turn made his teammates better as a whole. In his second year in the NBA, Bird and Celtics won the NBA Championship against the Houston Rockets. Larry Bird would go on to win two more championships with the Celtics. He would also win the Most Valuable Player award three times. This is what Larry Bird said after his second Most Valuable Player award, \"While I was still trying to figure out how I could improve my game for the next season, I was notified that I had been selected as the league MVP for the second year in a row\"(Bird and Ryan 153). Larry Bird after being in the league for seven years and winning two straight MVPs was still trying to find ways to get better. Bird proved that perseverance and dedication to the sport he loved would lead to a successful and rewarding\n\nHis career highs so far are with the Timberwolves. He played in 57 games, his field goal (2-point shots) percentage is at .421, his 3-point percentage is at .304, his free throw percentage is at .641, and he has his high in rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks also. The only record he has broke since then was his free throw percentage that changed to .900 with the Raptors. In his whole career so far he has played in 151 games, has 472 rebounds, given 77 assists, has 58 steals, has 27 blocks, and 658 points. He has only played in four seasons, so this is impressive. Although he hasn’t won any championships, he has great achievements and who knows how his future will\n\nFor a span of about four seasons, Archibald was among the ten best players in the league. In that span he was a three-time All-Star and appeared on four All-NBA Teams (3x First Team, 1x Second Team). He is only player in NBA history to lead the league in scoring one season and assists the next. His 25.3 points per game as a member of the team is second behind only Robertson’s 29.3.\n\nThe 76ers had a record of 68-13 and the Lakers had a record of 69-13 which was “the two best marks in NBA history until the Chicago Bulls’ 72-10 record in 1995-96” (Sachare 28). The Lakers also had “33 straight victories with an average winning margin of 12.3 points, best in NBA history [Note: the record for average winning margin has been broken since the writing of this article by the San Antonio Spurs in 2015-2016]” (“Wilt was larger than life…”). Wilt Chamberlain carried the 76ers team, leading them in every important statistical category. Despite the Lakers team having legends such as Jerry West and Gail Goodrich, they probably wouldn’t have set the records in win streak or average win margin without Wilt. Although a few teams have gotten a better record than Wilt’s championship teams, Wilt is the only one"
