        "text": "Grayson Allen has been one of the most impactful players for the Phoenix Suns this season, so it felt right when the team gave him the Dan Majerle Hustle Award ahead of their game against the Los Angeles Clippers on Tuesday.\n\nThe annual honor has been presented at the end of each regular season since 2003 to a player who personifies grit and toughness with which Dan Majerle played when he was playing for the Phoenix Suns in the 1990s.\n\nBefore Grayson Allen, the previous winners were Bo Outlaw (inaugural), Casey Jacobsen, Shawn Marion, Raja Bell, Leandre Barbosa, Grant Hill, Lou Amundson, Jared Dudley, Sebastian Telfair, PJ Tucker, Alan Williams, Josh Jackson, Mikal Bridges, Jevon Carter, and Josh Okogie.\n\nGrant Hill, PJ Tucker, and Mikal Bridges are the only repeat winners of this particular award.\n\nGrayson Allen finds a new home with the Phoenix Suns\n\nAfter spending the first six years of his NBA career with the Utah Jazz, Memphis Grizzlies, and the Milwaukee Bucks, Grayson Allen joined the Phoenix Suns last offseason as part of a blockbuster three-team trade that sent Damian Lillard to the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nIn his first season with The Valley, the former Duke star relished his 3-and-D role, with season averages of 13.4 points, 3.9 rebounds, and 3.0 assists per game, shooting 49.5 percent from the field and a career-best 45.6 percent from three-point land.\n\nHis drastic improvement from three-point land has made him a valuable weapon for the Phoenix Suns. This was evident in their March game against the Philadelphia 76ers, where he dropped 32 points, including nine three-pointers.\n\nAs of this writing, Grayson Allen is two triples away from reaching the 200 three-pointers threshold, which was only done by three players in Phoenix Suns history â€“ Quentin Richardson (226), Raja Bell (205), and Gerald Green (204)."
