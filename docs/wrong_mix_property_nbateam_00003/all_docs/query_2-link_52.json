        "text": "Steve Nash Biography\n\nSteve Nash is arguably the greatest Canadian professional basketball player of all-time. Nash was born in South Africa in 1974. He earned a scholarship to Santa Clara University in California and throughout his four seasons there, the Broncos made the NCAA Tournament three times while Nash was named West Coast Conference Player of the Year twice. Leaving a lasting impression with the Broncos while leading the team in assists, Nash was drafted in the first round of the 1996 NBA Draft by the Phoenix Suns. He continued to play point guard throughout his professional career for the Dallas Mavericks, Phoenix Suns again, and currently for the Los Angeles Lakers. Nash has earned an endless amount of the prestigious titles, including NBA Most Valuable Player in 2005 and 2006, NBA All-Star for eight different seasons, All-NBA First Team for three consecutive years, and All-NBA Second Team for two years. Nash also led the NBA in assists for five years, averaging 11.5 assists per game. In addition, he won the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award in 2007 for his tremendous character on and off the court.\n\nBook Steve Nash for your Next Event\n\nDisclaimer: AthleteSpeakers assists companies seeking to hire talent like Steve Nash for speaking engagements, virtual meetings, appearances, product endorsements, and business sanctions.
