        "text": "Understanding historical change is easy after the fact. Spotting a historical change and having the courage and insight to adapt to it is a far harder trick. This courage and insight won Steve Nash, Canada’s most famous basketball player, his first of two NBA MVP awards.\n\nIn 2004 the NBA recognized that a rule change was in order. The game had slowed down. Largely because point guards were getting blocked and shoved as they dribbled from the 3-point line to the net. Consequently, when on offense, teams would set up at the three point line and pass the ball around till they found an opening. The result was that the game was getting boring to watch. So the NBA instituted the Hand-check rule. Now, anyone who used their hand to guide or shove the dribbler would get a foul called on them.\n\nThis rule change allowed point guards to dribble towards the net more aggressively creating more exciting scoring opportunities.\n\nNash’s numbers before and after the rule change highlight the impact. He went from 6 assists and 10 points per game (PPG) in 2003 to MVP levels of 10 assists and 17 PPG. More importantly, for a point guard, was that he made his team far better. The Phoenix Suns went from a 29-win season in 2003 to 62-wins in 2004.\n\nSteve Nash, as the commentators have noted while writing about his retirement, is incredibly hard working and a basketball genius. However, that was the case before his two MVP seasons. And, all of the other point guards in the league had the same information about hand-check rule change.\n\nWhat earned him the first MVP was the courage and insight to take advantage of the rule change.\n\nWhen he realized the rule change was coming, changed another number: his weight. In the off-season he lost 15 pounds. Why? With the new rule he would no longer have to fight to get close to the basket so the muscle was unnecessary; he needed to be lighter and faster as he drove to the basket to score, draw a foul or make a stunning assist. And, his coach, Mike D’Antoni reorganized the Phoenix Suns offense around Steve’s newfound mobility.\n\nWhen the world changes, the prize goes to those who recognize and adapt fastest. What is the hand-check rule change in your world? Oil prices dropping ? Millennials disrupting the market? The disappearance of full time employment? Whatever it is, the courage and insight to adapt are far greater advantages than your prior success."
