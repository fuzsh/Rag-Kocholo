        "text": "Bobble of the Day\n\nPlayer: Steve Nash\n\nTeam: Phoenix Suns\n\nYear: 2012\n\nManufacturer: Forever Collectibles\n\nI really miss Nash playing in the NBA as this dude was one of the greatest point guards in the history of the game. Stevie Nash had the finesse as a sleek PG and a long range shot that was smooth as a baby’s ass.\n\nHere we have Steve Nash’s Back to Back MVP (2005/2006) bobble. Never mind getting 1 MVP award, this dude did it in back to back years. It’s a crazy thought but it’s been done and Nash definitely deserved it. The lower part of the base is outlined with a sharp purple color and above the purple lies a bright orange color. Stevie’s name is printed white with raised letters which offsets the two Suns colors. On top of the base sits his number 13 along with the Phoenix Suns logo which is a dope feature. In both arms sits Nash’s back to back MVP trophies close to each shoulder."
