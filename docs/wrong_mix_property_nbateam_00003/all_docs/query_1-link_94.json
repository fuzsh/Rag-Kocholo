The basketball champs, feeling hurt, seek revenge by paying a surprise visit to Stoolbend and putting Cleveland in his place.\n\nRobert and Raymond\n\nIn the season premiere, it's an inspiring story of not one, but two amazing transformations. Chris and Heidi Powell return as the transformation specialists and trainers for EWL, plus NBA greats Kobe Bryant, Steve Nash, Byron Scott and James Worthy."
