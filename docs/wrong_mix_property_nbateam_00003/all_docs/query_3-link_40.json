        "text": "Phoenix Suns guard Devin Booker was chosen as the winner of the 2020-21 Seasonlong NBA Cares Community Assist Award, the league announced Wednesday.\n\nCavaliers forward Larry Nance Jr. was one of 10 finalists for the honor, determined by a 12-day public fan vote and an NBA executive panel.\n\nBooker will be recognized before Thursday night’s Game 2 of the NBA Finals and his Devin Booker Starting Five Initiative will receive $25,000 from the league and Kaiser Permanente.\n\nLast season, Booker donated 500,000 to five Arizona community groups — Arizona Autism United, Central Arizona Shelter Services, YMCA of Southern Arizona, GAP Ministries and Elevate Phoenix. His initiative has given a total of $2.5 million over five years to different non-profits serving youth. In 2020, Booker was named a Special Olympics Global Ambassador.\n\nNance's nomination was prompted by a jersey auction that raised over $222,000 for 72 small businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMore: 'A hometown hero': Small businesses laud Cavs' Larry Nance Jr. for pandemic support\n\nRevere High School graduate Nance wore gear from an area business to each Cavs game and auctioned off game-worn jerseys, with Nance and the Cavs matching the auction total. Cavs corporate partner Westfield also matched the winning bid, making a $100,000 donation to the Urban League of Greater Cleveland and the Akron Urban League, which support minority-owned businesses.\n\nNance's project earned him the first B/R Kicks Community Award, which was announced on June 25.\n\nThe other NBA Cares Community Assist Award finalists were DeAndre’ Bembry (Toronto Raptors), Joel Embiid (Philadelphia 76ers), Jrue Holiday (Milwaukee Bucks), Damian Lillard (Portland Trail Blazers), Patty Mills (San Antonio Spurs), Donovan Mitchell (Utah Jazz), Josh Richardson (Dallas Mavericks) and Russell Westbrook (Washington Wizards).\n\nThe finalists included the offseason winner, six monthly winners and three additional players selected by the league.\n\nMarla Ridenour can be reached at mridenour@thebeaconjournal.com.
