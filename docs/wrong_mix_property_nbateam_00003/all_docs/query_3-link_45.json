        "text": "Grayson Allen’s career year in the NBA is now coming with a sizable financial reward.\n\nThe former Duke basketball star, now in his sixth season in the NBA, has agreed to a four-year, $70 million extension with the Phoenix Suns, according to a report Monday from ESPN.\n\nAllen was set to become an unrestricted free agent this summer, but was reportedly “eager” to sign on long term with the Suns, who have one of the most star-studded cores in the league with Kevin Durant, Devin Booker and Bradley Beal.\n\nThe 28-year-old Allen enjoyed the most statistically productive and efficient regular season of his NBA career this year, his first with Phoenix. Allen posted career highs in scoring average (13.5 points per game), assists (three per game), rebounds (3.9 per game), minutes (33.5 per game), field goal percentage (49.9%) and 3-point percentage (46.1%). His 3-point percentage led all qualifying NBA players, putting him just ahead of his former Duke teammate, Luke Kennard of the Memphis Grizzlies, who was second on the list at 45%.\n\nREQUIRED READING: Phoenix Suns guard Grayson Allen 'very honored' to receive 2024 Dan Majerle Hustle Award\n\nThough his college career, at least outside Durham, is perhaps best remembered for his propensity for tripping opponents, Allen was a valued contributor throughout his four years with the Blue Devils, from 2014-18.\n\nAs a freshman, Allen enjoyed a breakout performance with 16 points off the bench in Duke’s 68-63 national championship game victory over Wisconsin in 2015. He was a first-team all-ACC selection and a third-team Associated Press all-American as a sophomore in 2016 before earning third-team all-conference honors in 2018.\n\nThe No. 21 overall selection by the Utah Jazz in the 2018 NBA Draft, Allen previously spent one season with the Jazz, two with the Grizzlies and two with the Milwaukee Bucks before joining the Suns last offseason as part of the blockbuster three-team trade that most notably send Damian Lillard to the Bucks.\n\nPhoenix finished the regular season 49-33 and earned the No. 6 seed in the Western Conference for the 2024 NBA Playoffs, where it will face off against the No. 3 seed Minnesota Timberwolves."
