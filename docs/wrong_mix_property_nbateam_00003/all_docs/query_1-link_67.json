        "text": "Basketball star Steve Nash was named winner of the Lou Marsh Trophy on Thursday.\n\nIn May, Nash became the first Canadian to earn the NBA's Most Valuable Player award.\n\nThe six-foot-three-inch Phoenix Suns playmaker was only the second point guard to be named MVP by the league in the last 40 years.\n\nNash, 31, was a unanimous choice for the Lou Marsh. The other nominees were Pittsburgh Penguins rookie Sidney Crosby, diver Alexandre Despatie, curler Randy Ferbey, long-track speed skater Cindy Klassen and soccer player Christine Sinclair.\n\nThe award, decided by a panel of sports editors and broadcasters, is given annually to Canada's outstanding athlete by the Toronto Star. It is named after that paper's former sports editor.\n\nAdam van Koeverden, who won a gold and bronze medal in kayaking at the 2004 Athens Olympics, won the award last year."
