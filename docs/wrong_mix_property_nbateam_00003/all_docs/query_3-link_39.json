        "text": "Phoenix Suns head coach Monty Williams may have had a little more pep in his usual post-practice workout on the exercise bike in the team's practice facility Monday.\n\nWilliams found out prior he won the NBA Coach of the Year award as his wife, children and players created a unique ceremony he didn't even realize was unfolding when Chris Paul started talking about celebrating everything after Monday's practice.\n\n\"The players knew, my family knew,\" Williams said. \"As usual, I was the clueless one in the group and found out after everybody else was already aware. It was a pretty cool moment and just grateful to be able to share that with everybody that I work with every single day and a few of my family members. I thought that was priceless.\"\n\nThe top-seeded Suns play Game 5 of the Western Conference semifinals Tuesday versus fourth-seeded Dallas at Footprint Center with the series tied 2-2.\n\nThe award will be presented to Williams before an expected sellout crowd of 17,071 at the arena at some point Tuesday.\n\n\"I've often said about my life God knocks the ball out of the park and I get to run the bases,\" said Williams, who finished second to Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau last year for the award.\n\nDevin Booker and Chris Paul both tweeted the news before the NBA announced the award later Monday afternoon.\n\n\"WD > WS&mldr;Congrats Coach Mont on Coach of the Year!\" Paul tweeted.\n\nWilliams led the Suns to the NBA's best record this season at 64-18, which was also a franchise record for most wins in a single season.\n\n\"Phoenix Suns coach Monty Williams has been voted the NBAâ€™s COY, book tells sources. A formal announcement is expected later today.\" Booker tweeted.\n\nWilliams racked up 81 of the 100 first-place votes, 17 second-place votes and two third-place votes to finish with 458 points in a landslide victory.\n\n\"Monty Williams is an outstanding coach with impeccable integrity and character and a great leader of men,\" said former NBA head coach Avery Johnson, who won the award in the 2005-06 season with the Dallas Mavericks \"Well deserving of the 2022 NBA Coach of the Year.\"\n\nGrizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins finished second with 270 points (17 first-place votes) and Heat coach Erik Spoelstra placed third with 72 points (one first-place vote).\n\nCeltics first-year head coach Ime Udoka received the only other first-place vote.\n\nThe award is voted on by 100 media members worldwide.\n\n\"Shoutout to Monty Williams,\" said Jenkins during his Zoom pregame availability, as second-seeded Memphis plays at third-seeded Golden State in Game 4 of their conference semifinals series Monday.\n\n\"What a special season the Suns have had. Remarkable what him and his coaching staff are doing. Just want to give him a lot of props on receiving Coach of the Year award. He's doing a hell of a job.\"\n\nWilliams said his wife knew last week he had won the award as she helped coordinate Monday's celebration after practice.\n\n\"They had worked it out,\" Williams said. \"Somehow, someway, they told the players and a couple of them knew. So Lisa had coordinated a couple of my girls to fly in.\"\n\nWilliams said his oldest daughter, Lael, who works for the NBA as a merchandising and licensing coordinator, was in New Orleans with Pelicans coach Willie Green and his wife, Terrah, Sunday, but she was also headed to Phoenix to celebrate with her dad.\n\n\"And they sent me a picture of her yesterday, and I was like, oh, Lael is in New Orleans,\" Williams said. \"So when I saw her walk through the doors at the gym, I was like, what are you doing? It caught me off guard and then I realized what was going on.\"\n\nWilliams's second oldest daughter, Faith, was with him in Dallas as the Suns lost Game 4 Sunday to the Mavericks. She didn't give any indication about Monday's plans.\n\n\"She just played it off so smoothly,\" Williams said. \"I had no idea what was going on. So when she walked through the entry way, I was like, 'you guys.' That's when I kind of knew. Then my son, Micah, had (the award) in his hands. To see the players and everybody in that moment, it spoke to the character and the care factor of our team. Everybody on our team cares about everybody.\"\n\nWilliams is the third Suns coach to win the award, along with the late Cotton Fitzsimmons (1988-89), who coached him in college at Notre Dame, and Mike D'Antoni (2004-05) being the first two.\n\nIn his third season in Phoenix, Williams has won the National Basketball Coaches Association's Coach of the Year award the last two seasons.\n\nWilliams was fired as head coach in New Orleans in 2015 after five seasons. Given a second chance, Williams has a greater appreciation for not only the job, but enjoying moments like Monday's with family and the team.\n\n\"And allowing everybody to enjoy it,\" Williams said. \"II think 10 years ago or when I was in New Orleans, if I were to win something like this, I would probably take the award and put it in my closet and then get back to work and not even let my family like enjoy it.\"\n\nHave opinion about current state of the Suns?
