        "text": "Dale! Pitbull is confirmed to headline the halftime show at the 2024 AT&T WNBA All-Star Game, taking place Sat. July 20 at Footprint Center in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\n“We have an opportunity to use AT&T WNBA All-Star to showcase an incredible league and some of the greatest athletes in the world,” Mat Ishbia, owner of Phoenix Mercury and Phoenix Suns, said in a press statement. “It’s important everything we do, on and off the floor, is at the same level as the superstars who will be playing. Pitbull is one of the world’s most dynamic artists and I wanted a halftime performer who reflects the same excitement, passion and incredible fandom of the WNBA.”\n\nDemonstrating his admiration and support for the Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA), the Cuban-American global star added: “I was raised by a woman, and a woman made me a man. It’s an honor to make history and perform at the WNBA All-Star Game. Here’s to all the powerful women of the WNBA. So buckle up and get ready to have a good time, Dale!”\n\nFans can tune in at 8:30 p.m. ET on Saturday (July 20) via ABC.

Lil Jon will also join the tour in select cities."
