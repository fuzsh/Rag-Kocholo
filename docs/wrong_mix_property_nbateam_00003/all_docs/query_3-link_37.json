        "text": "Duke legend Grayson Allen made a strong impression in his first season with the Phoenix Suns.\n\nOn a team with players like Kevin Durant, Devin Booker, and Bradley Beal, the Suns chose to honor Allen with the team’s Dan Majerle Hustle Award due to his effort during the year.\n\nThe team has given out the award every season since 2003 to the player who impresses with his work and, well, hustle, every night.\n\nAllen, now 28 years old and in his sixth NBA season, has started 72 games for Phoenix this year. He’s averaging a career-high 13.4 points and he’s making 45.6% of his 3-point attempts this season, also the best mark of his career. This is his fourth straight season averaging at least 10 points.\n\nThe four-year Blue Devil has the most points by any Duke basketball player since 2010.\n\nThe Suns, currently the 7th seed in the NBA’s Western Conference, have a 47-33 record as the season draws to a close. They are a half-game behind the New Orleans Pelicans as the No. 6 seed gets to avoid the play-in tournament."
