The Cleveland Cavaliers have obtained Channing Frye from the Orlando Magic as part of a three-team trade with the Portland Trail Blazers, as confirmed by ESPN's Marc Stein and Chris Broussard.

The Cavs will send aspiring Sideshow Bob lookalike Anderson Varejao along with a conditional first round pick to Portland. and The Magic will receive a second round pick from the Blazers and Oakland native Jared Cunningham from Cleveland.

According to ESPN Frye is under contract for three seasons and is set to make $8.2 million this year, $7.8 million next year and $7.4 million the year after that. Varejao is owed $9.7 million this year and $9.3 million next year.

The injury riddled Varejao has played an average of 34 games over his last five seasons. With the addition of a stretch-forward such as Frye, Cleveland will be able to space the floor and give LeBron James more room to operate in the paint.

While Frye is an obvious upgrade on the offensive side of the ball, the Cavs lose a tenacious rebounder in Varejao who is playing a career low ten minutes per game this season.
