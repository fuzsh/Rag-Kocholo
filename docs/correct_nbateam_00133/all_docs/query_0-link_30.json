        "text": "All puns aside, Channing Frye’s perspective on wine is downright refreshing. The 37-year-old has an NBA title with the Cleveland Cavaliers as the highlight of a notable 14-year career, but his passion for the grape seems to eclipse all of those accomplishments on the hardwood. “Whether I like the bottle or not, I appreciate all wine,” Frye says. “It’s like tasting a painting of that specific year and that’s when you begin to appreciate all of those little details that go into the story.”\n\nThis is, in part, why Chosen Family Wines became involved with the inaugural One Barrel Challenge, an initiative including seven Oregon wineries each donating the equivalent of one barrel of wine to raise funds for wine industry scholarships. The scholarships will be facilitated through the Maurice Lucas Foundation, and will focus on increasing the diversity and range of voices at many levels of Oregon’s wine business. Other wineries include Portland Trail Blazer star CJ McCollum’s McCollum Heritage 9, Adelsheim and Hazelfern.\n\nFrye said he wants to see Curry take the Warriors to the Finals without all of his great teammates surrounding him. “Until the Warriors go back without him, it’s like, ‘Well, you had to have a stacked team with five Hall of Famers on it.’ … This is the question, and this is unfair, but can Steph do that now?” Frye’s criticism definitely made the rounds, and it was something Steph’s brother Seth heard. After Steph scored 62 points, Seth joked about how his brother has 60 more games this season to determine his legacy.\n\nCurry is one of the most prolific 3-point shooters of all time, but the Warriors’ dismal play has led to some brash reactions from NBA insiders and analysts alike. That includes 13-year NBA veteran Channing Frye, who recently discussed Curry’s legacy with the noted absence of Klay Thompson. “Until the Warriors go back [to the Finals] without him, it’s like, ‘Well, you had to have a stacked team with five Hall of Famers on it.’ ” Frye said. “This is the question, and this is unfair, but can Steph do that now?”\n\nCJ McCollum: Then I began to go to other wineries and check out different places and have tastings. That’s when I realized I was living amongst a gold mine. And, obviously, Kevin Love [basketball player for the Cleveland Cavaliers], he was born here. He was telling me more about Oregon specifically. [Former Trail Blazer] Channing Frye was out here in the summertime. There are a lot of guys who already had a great appreciation for wine. I was just kind of tapping into their knowledge, asking around, checking in with friends."
