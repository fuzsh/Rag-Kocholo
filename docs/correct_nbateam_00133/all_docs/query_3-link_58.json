        "text": "Position: Forward\n\nAge: 33\n\nYears at UA: 2001-05\n\nDrafted: No. 8 in 2005 by New York Knicks.\n\nThis season: Frye has gotten hot from 3-point range in the playoffs, shooting 58 percent from long range, after playing similar minutes off the bench for both Orlando and Cleveland this season. He averaged 6.1 points and 3.3 rebounds while shooting 38.7 percent from three-point range during the regular season.\n\nHow he got here: He played the first year and a half of a four-year, $32 million deal he signed with Orlando in 2014, then was traded in February as part of a three-team deal that also involved Portland.\n\nAlso played for: Magic (2014-16), Suns (2009-14, but did not play in 2012-13 because of a heart condition), Blazers (2007-09), Knicks (2005-07).\n\nHe said it: “I’ll think about it maybe at the end of my career. But for me, I’m just out there playing, trying to play the right way.” — Frye, on reaching the finals, to the Akron Beacon-Journal.\n\nSubscribe to stay connected to Tucson.
