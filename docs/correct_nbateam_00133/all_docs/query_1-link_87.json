        "text": "The final installment of the best Trail Blazer at every number includes one of the most memorable snapshots in franchise history and probably the best trade in franchise history, while also acknowledging the jersey in the rafters of the player who owns many Trail Blazers’ firsts.\n\nPart 1 | Part 2 | Part 3 | Part 4\n\nNo. 42 — Kermit Washington\n\nKnown mostly as a Laker and for his 1977 punch that broke the face of Houston’s Rudy Tomjanovich and resulted in a 60-day suspension from the NBA, Washington had a notable two-plus seasons in Portland. He came to Portland from San Diego in 1979 as part of the return for the Blazers sending Bill Walton to the Clippers, and in both full seasons he played in Portland, Washington was a second-team All Defensive player. He also made the 1980 All-Star Game. A power forward, Washington averaged 13.4 points and 10.5 rebounds his first season and 11.4 points and 9.4 rebounds his second season before retiring in 1982 because of back and knee problems that limited him to 20 games.\n\nRunner-up: Robin Lopez\n\nOthers: Terry Dischinger, Greg Lee, Wally Walker, Kim Anderson, Wayne Cooper, Walt Williams, Theo Ratliff, Shavlik Randolph.\n\nNo. 43 — Mychal Thompson\n\nThe first overall pick in the 1978 draft, Thompson had seven stellar seasons in Portland, even after missing all of his second season because of a broken left ankle. He came out of the gate smoking, recording 23 points and 10 rebounds in his rookie debut, followed by a 37-point, 13-rebound game his second game before finishing his rookie season with averages of 14.7 points and 8.3 rebounds. His best season was 1981-82 when he averaged 20.8 points, 11.7 rebounds and 4.0 assists, but he played in the forgotten era between the 1977 title team and the 1989-1992 glory years, when the Blazers won only two playoff series.\n\nOthers: Bill Smith, Anthony Tolliver\n\nNo. 44 — Brian Grant\n\nOne of the more indelible moments in franchise history involves Grant standing face-to-face with Utah forward Karl Malone while exchanging some not-so-pleasant words in Game 5 of the 1999 Western Conference semifinals. Ask any die-hard Blazers fan about Grant and that’s the image that comes to mind because it captures the never-back-down toughness the power forward displayed during his three seasons in Portland.\n\nSome background: In Game 1, Malone was fined $10,000 by the NBA for elbowing Grant in the mouth, even though Grant was called for a foul on the play. Then in Game 5, Malone again landed an elbow, this time above Grant’s right eye in the first quarter, opening a gash that required six stitches. Grant came back to play, albeit with a bloodied band-aid, and in the fourth quarter, Grant was called for a technical for throwing an elbow into the air in the direction of Malone. The technical incensed coach Mike Dunleavy, who ran onto the court in protest (he was ejected), and during that chaos, Grant approached Malone and stood face to face, with his nose nearly touching Malone’s nose, while delivering some choice words.\n\nThe Blazers lost Game 5, but when they returned to Portland for Game 6, much of the Rose Garden crowd wore band-aids on their forehead in salute to Grant, who responded with perhaps his best defensive game ever. Grant held the future Hall of Famer to eight points on 3-of-16 shooting as the Blazers won and advanced to the Western Conference finals.\n\nRunner up: Drazen Petrovic\n\nOthers: Gary Gregor, Ollie Johnson, Jacky Dorsey, Clemon Johnson, Kevin Kunnert, Harvey Grant, Ruben Boumtje-Boumtje, Channing Frye, Anthony Tolliver, Luis Montero, Mario Hezonja.\n\nNo. 45 — Geoff Petrie\n\nA 6-foot-5 guard, Petrie was the Trail Blazers’ first draft pick, first Rookie of the Year, first All-Star and was the second player to have his number retired by the franchise. In 1973, he twice scored 51 points, which stood as the franchise record for points in a game for 32 years until Damon Stoudamire scored 54 in 2005. Petrie ranks eighth in franchise scoring and sixth in assists. His 24.9 scoring average in 1972-73 was the best in franchise history until Kiki Vandeweghe averaged 26.9 in 1986-87. After he was the eighth overall pick out of Princeton, Petrie was named co-Rookie of the Year with Boston’s Dave Cowens. Petrie later served as the top basketball executive for the Blazers from 1990-1994.\n\nOther: Geoff Crompton\n\nNo. 48 — Walt Gilmore\n\nGilmore played on the first Trail Blazers team as a 23-year-old rookie out of Fort Valley State. A second-round draft pick (25th overall), the 6-foot-6 forward appeared in 27 games, averaging 2.1 points and 2.7 rebounds. His best game was 11 points and six rebounds at Seattle. He was waived after the season and never again played in the NBA.\n\nNo. 50 — Zach Randolph\n\nIt was the first round of the 2003 playoffs and things were bleak in Rip City. Dallas had just whooped Portland in the Rose Garden to take a 3-0 series lead. Big man Arvydas Sabonis was creaking in pain, Scottie Pippen’s knees were throbbing so badly he couldn’t play, and the Blazers couldn’t stop the pick-and-roll duo of Steve Nash and Dirk Nowitzki. A sweep seemed certain.\n\nBut then came a coaching move that changed the series and kick-started a prolific career: Maurice Cheeks inserted little-used forward Zach Randolph into the starting lineup for Game 4. In his second season and still baby-faced, Randolph played 41 minutes in Game 4 and had 25 points and 15 rebounds as the Blazers staved off elimination. In Game 5, he had 22 and nine as the Blazers won in Dallas. Then he had 21 and 10 in Game 6 as the Blazers became the third team in NBA history to force a Game 7 after losing the first three games. In Game 7, the Blazers led by two entering the fourth quarter, but lost, as Randolph had 21 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nRandolph’s surprise 2003 playoffs set the stage for his arrival as a factor the next season, as he averaged 20.1 points and 10.5 rebounds while being voted the NBA’s Most Improved Player. He would go on to become the only player to lead the Blazers in scoring and rebounding four consecutive seasons.\n\nRunner-up: Greg Anthony\n\nOthers: Chris Engler, Joe Binion, Tom Scheffler, Robert Reid, Caleb Swanigan.\n\nNo. 51 — Michael Ruffin\n\nThe only player to wear No. 51 for the Blazers, Ruffin was a 6-foot-8 forward who played in 11 games during the 2008-09 season, scoring six points in 35 minutes.\n\nNo. 52 — Buck Williams\n\nIf it wasn’t the best trade in franchise history, the 1989 deal to bring Buck Williams to Portland was certainly the most impactful. And the players knew it practically from Day 1. In fact, both Williams and Clyde Drexler say they will never forget the day when Drexler gave Williams a ride home from one of the team’s first training camp practices.\n\n“We were coming home and he looked at me and said, ‘We can win a championship with you,'” Williams told me in 2009.\n\nDrexler’s proclamation sounded ridiculous to Williams, who was coming off seasons in which he won 26, 19 and 24 games with the Nets. And it’s not like the Blazers were some juggernaut either. They had been bounced out of the first round of the playoffs four consecutive seasons and were coming off a 39-43 record. But during those initial training camp workouts, Drexler said he could tell Williams was just what the Blazers needed, and he felt he needed to establish a mindset within Williams during that car ride home.\n\n“I had just seen what he could do all week in training camp, and he was exactly what we needed,” Drexler said. “And I was trying to tell him that I thought we would have the best team in the West. And that we could win it all.”\n\nBoth said there was a long moment of silence after Drexler spoke.\n\n“You could see a light go off in his head,” Drexler said.\n\nAdded Williams: “It got me starting to think in those terms.”\n\nThe Blazers won 59 games that season and advanced to the NBA Finals, where they were beaten in five games by Detroit. The next season, Portland won a franchise-record 63 games. And the season after that, they were back in the Finals, where they lost to Chicago in six games. And while Drexler was the star, and Terry Porter the playmaker, and Jerome Kersey the hustler, it was Williams who made it all click. He was efficient on offense, leading the NBA in field-goal percentage in 1990-91 and 1991-92, and a rock on defense. He is the only Trail Blazer to be named to the All-Defensive team three times.\n\n“We got Buck and he became the glue,” coach Rick Adelman said in 2009. “Suddenly, we went from also-rans to contenders, just like that.”\n\nAnd the price to get this game-changing power forward? Sam Bowie and a first-round pick that ended up being Mookie Blaylock.\n\nRunner-up: Greg Oden\n\nOther: Jim Brewer\n\nNo. 53 — James Edwards\n\nFour years after he was the starting center on the Detroit Pistons team that beat the Blazers in the 1990 NBA Finals, James Edwards played 28 games for the 1994-95 Blazers, averaging 2.7 points and 1.5 rebounds in fewer than 10 minutes a game. He is still the best at No. 53 because the only other to wear the number was Alton Lister, who appeared in seven games in the 1997-98 season.\n\nOther: Alton Lister\n\nNo. 54 — Dale Schlueter\n\nOne of the original Trail Blazers, the 6-foot-10 center recorded two triple doubles and once had 21 rebounds in a game. He was the fourth-leading scorer on the 1971-72 team, averaging 11.7 points and 10.6 rebounds. After two seasons, Schluter was traded to Philadelphia but he returned to Portland for the 1977-78 season and played in 10 games.\n\nOthers: Tom Piotrowski, Reggie Smith, Brian Skinner, Tim Quarterman\n\nNo. 55 — Kiki Vandeweghe\n\nOne of the great scorers in franchise history, Vandeweghe began his Blazers career with a bang, scoring 47 points in his first game after being traded from Denver in the summer of 1984. With huge hands and a quick first step, Vandeweghe was at times unstoppable on offense. He averaged 22.4, 24.8 and 26.9 points a game in his first three seasons before injuries limited his final two seasons. At the time, his 26.9 points in 1986-87 was a franchise record for a season, but it lasted only one season as Clyde Drexler averaged 27.0 the next season.\n\nOther: Will Perdue\n\nNo. 83 — Craig Smith\n\nKnown as “The Rhino” for his sturdy build, Craig Smith played 47 games for the Blazers in the 2011-12 season, averaging 3.3 points and 2.3 rebounds. He is the only player to wear No. 83 in Portland.\n\nNo. 88 — Nicolas Batum\n\nThe Frenchman wore No. 88 because it was the year he was born, and during his seven years his game was as unique as his number. Batum was a good defender, reliable 3-point shooter and capable facilitator, which made him an invaluable piece as the starting small forward on teams that four times won 50 or more games. Batum recorded four triple-doubles before he was traded to Charlotte in 2015.\n\n(Photo: Sam Forencich / NBAE via Getty Images)"
