        "text": "In a three-team trade, the Cleveland Cavaliers acquired power forward/center Channing Frye; the Orlando Magic acquired combo guard Jared Cunningham and a future 2nd-round draft pick (from the Portland Trail Blazers); and Portland acquired center/power forward Anderson Varejao and a conditional 1st-round draft pick in 2018 (from Cleveland).\n\nWhat does it give the Cleveland Cavaliers?\n\nThis season Varajao has been struggling to fill the same rebounding role he used to, so he gets replaced here by Frye (who is much more of a perimeter player who can stretch opposing defenses). Essentially this is the Cavs trading defense for offense. Frye's fairly hefty deal has two years left on it after this one, but it's roughly the same term and price as Varejao's was. Meanwhile, Frye can take some pressure off Kevin Love at power forward as a floor-stretching big guy.\n\nWhat does it give the Orlando Magic?\n\nThe Magic has been busy lately, first acquiring vets Brandon Jennings and Ersan Ilyasova, and now moving Frye. Ultimately this is a cost-cutting move, however, since Cunningham isn't expected to stick around. The second-round pick isn't much in return for Frye, but at least Orlando is saving significant money over the next two seasons by moving him.\n\nWhat does it give the Portland Trail Blazers?\n\nThe surprising Trail Blazers are still in the playoff picture in the West, and adding Varejao gives them much-needed veteran depth up front--if they keep him, that is. He hasn't been productive at all this season and injuries have taken their toll. If he does stick around Varejao can provide needed leadership, rebounding, and defense (when healthy). All that said, the key here for the young Blazers is the condtional 1st-round pick in '18 (their prize for taking on all that salary from Varejao's deal)."
