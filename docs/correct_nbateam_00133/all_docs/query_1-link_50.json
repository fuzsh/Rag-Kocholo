(Joshua Gunter, cleveland.com)\n\nCLEVELAND, Ohio -- Channing Frye played his final NBA game Tuesday night in a Cavaliers jersey, a jersey in which he's happy to be retiring.\n\n\"I appreciate you guys,\" Frye said in a video to Cavs fans. \"I wouldn't want to retire anywhere else. My heart is here in Cleveland. My championship is here in Cleveland. So I just want to say thank you. I embrace this community. You guys have embraced me. And I'm glad to be going out a Cav.\"\n\nFrye was selected as the eighth overall pick in the 2005 NBA draft by the New York Knicks. He spent two years in the Big Apple before being traded to the Portland Trail Blazers in June 2007.\n\nFrye spent time in Portland, Phoenix and Orlando before being traded to the Cavaliers in 2016, providing the Cavs with a much-needed big man who could spread the floor and hit outside shots.\n\nIn the trade for Frye, the Cavs sent center Anderson Varejao and a conditional first-round pick to the Blazers. Cleveland also traded guard Jared Cunningham in the deal, sending him to Orlando along with a second-round pick from Portland.\n\nFrye had an immediate impact, helping the Cavs become a true team and playing a key role in the championship run. He was known in the locker room as the glue that kept the team cohesive.\n\n\"I'm humbled to be a part of this community. You changed my life. I'm a champion and so are you guys,\" Frye added.\n\nHere's a look back at his short but positive impact on the Cleveland Cavaliers organization.\n\nCleveland Cavaliers forward Channing Frye warms up before the game against the Detroit Pistons, his first game at Quicken Loans Arena as a Cavalier.
