        "text": "CLEVELAND: The Cavaliers nearly landed Channing Frye in free agency two years ago. Given a second chance, General Manager David Griffin got his man.\n\nThe Cavaliers acquired Frye from the Orlando Magic in exchange for Jared Cunningham and sent Anderson Varejao to the Portland Trail Blazers in Thursday’s three-team deal. The Cavs also sent a protected 2018 first-round pick to the Blazers and received back a second-round pick that was also shipped to the Magic.\n\nFrye will come off the bench and boost a reserve unit that has struggled to produce a consistent scorer, but he comes at a heavy price. The Cavs burned a first-round pick in what amounted to a money dump and they traded away a fan favorite in Varejao.\n\n“There’s a risk, certainly,” Griffin said. “This isn’t something we did lightly. … The fact Channing is under contract for three years (two more after this season) with a really clearly defined skill set, the number of people his size that can make playoff 3s is really small.”\n\nFrye, 32, is averaging 5.2 points and 3.2 rebounds for the Magic. He is another stretch-4 who is shooting 40 percent from 3-point range this season and he’s a 39-percent career shooter from deep.\n\nGriffin has liked Frye since their time together in Phoenix. He pursued Frye in free agency two years ago and even said Thursday the two sides had agreed on a deal, but the Cavs couldn’t make the money work because of the cap space they needed to preserve in the hopes of signing LeBron James.\n\nThe Cavs were privately pessimistic as late as Wednesday night they could get something done for Frye because they needed to move money first and they believed the Magic would find a better deal elsewhere.\n\nWhen the Los Angeles Clippers balked at the deadline, the Cavs swooped in.\n\n“His value to us both in Phoenix in the playoffs and on every team he has been on has been greater than people have anticipated,” Griffin said. “We hope that continues. This is a complementary piece that fits our existing group very well.”\n\nCoach Tyronn Lue believes Frye’s range will allow the Cavs to play small and still have a 7-footer on the floor. Lue wasn’t ready to declare whose minutes Frye will take, but it is believed within the organization Timofey Mozgov is likely to suffer the most, although Frye will also take minutes from Richard Jefferson and James Jones.\n\nJones played with Frye in Portland in 2008.\n\n“Great guy, skilled man. He’s a shooter,” Jones said. “More than anything he’s a smart player. Very, very smart.”\n\nThe Cavs have tried unsuccessfully for weeks to dump Varejao’s contract with no luck. But the Trail Blazers, one of two teams in the league with ample cap space, absorbed the remainder of his $9.7 million this season and his $9.3 million next season in exchange for a first-round pick that is top-10 protected for two years.\n\nThe Cavs are expected to save more than $10 ­million in luxury taxes this season with these moves, while the team internally calculated they’ll save more than $70 million by moving Varejao’s contract. A large portion of that is negated, ­however, by Frye’s deal. He’s earning $8.2 million this ­season and is guaranteed a total of $15.2 million over the next two seasons.\n\nVarejao, 33, spent his entire 12-year career in Cleveland and wanted to retire with the Cavs. He signed a three-year extension prior to the start of last season, then tore his Achilles. He returned healthy this year, but has played sparingly behind Kevin Love, Tristan Thompson and Timofey Mozgov.\n\nVarejao leaves Cleveland with career averages of 7.6 points and 7.5 rebounds, although injuries have wrecked the second half of his career.\n\n“I think [Varejao] exemplified everything we want a Cavalier to be about,” Griffin said. “Andy is a player, both in addition to what he did for us as a player and his basketball talent, his diligence in getting back from injury year after year, his hard work, his effort, his intensity, those are things that are going to be remembered here and they are incredibly appreciated. It made this trade an incredibly difficult one to do from a human level.”\n\nThe Cavs fit Frye into their $10.5 million trade exception and have about $2.3 million of it remaining if they choose to work another deal this summer around the draft. They also created another $9.7 million trade exception that is valid for one year.\n\nCunningham was making less than $1 ­million, but would’ve cost the Cavs a few million in luxury taxes. His deal was strictly a money dump.\n\nFrye is expected to be available when the Cavs play at the Oklahoma City Thunder on Sunday."
