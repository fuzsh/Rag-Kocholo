Second round pick and guard Jared Cunningham was traded to the Orlando Magic in exchange for Frye.\n\n“Anderson is a special player, teammate and person,” said Cavaliers General Manager David Griffin. “Few players have earned the respect, support and admiration of an entire organization, fan base and community as Andy did here. Those are all things that made this a difficult deal to do. At the same time, we have a deep obligation to do whatever we can to reach our ultimate goal and we believe this was a deal that improves our team now and positions us better in the future as well. We thank Andy for his hard work, dedication and contributions to the Cavaliers and our community and wish him and his wife, Marcelle, the very, very best.”\n\nDuring his tenth season with the NBA, Frye appeared in 44 games for the Orlando Magic, averaging 5.2 points and 3.2 rebounds, according to the Cavs. He is also shooting .97 from the three-point line and .905 from the foul line. Over his career, the forward played in 701 games with New York, Portland, Phoenix, and Orlando.\n\nThe Cavs said Varejo spent his enter 12-year NBA career with their team. Among franchise leaders, he ranked third in offensive rebounds, fifth in defensive rebounds, fifth in total rebounds, seventh in games played, tied seventh in blocks, and eighth in steals. He appeared in 31 games in the 2015-2016 NBA season.\n\nCunningham, who signed on as a free agent after the 2015 Cavs training camp, appeared in 40 games for the Cavs this season."
