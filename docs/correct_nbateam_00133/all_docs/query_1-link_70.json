        "text": "Back in May, Damian Lillard said he wouldn’t play in the NBA return if the Portland Trail Blazers did not have a fair chance to make the playoffs. But after the NBA announced that there will be eight games for teams to catch up, Lillard said he would participate. Ever since, a lot of experts and players have said that the Blazers pose the biggest threat to the number one seed, the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nCharles Barkley and Danny Green talked about it before. Now former NBA champion Channing Frye has also mentioned how the Trail Blazers could do serious damage to the Lakers. While speaking on the NBA Hang Time podcast, Frye said, “(Rajon) Rondo going down is huge for the Lakers, because playoff Rondo and everyone says it, and I’ve seen it, is an absolute different beast.” “I don’t care if anybody agrees or not. I’m telling you this. Playoff Rondo would have been difficult for Damian Lillard or CJ (McCollum).”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nFrye retired last year, after spending over a decade in the league. He played for the Blazers back in 2007 and also for the Lakers in 2018. But he won his only championship on the Cavaliers, back in 2016.\n\nWill the Los Angeles Lakers be able to contain Lillard and McCollum?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nFrye says that without Rondo, the Lakers don’t have a matchup for either Lillard or McCollum. “But now that he’s not playing, that’s a tough first-round matchup for the Los Angeles Lakers to go against a physical, battle-tested team. Where, yes, LeBron (James), is the best player on the court and then AD (Anthony Davis). But then on the other side, the Lakers have no answer for CJ and Dame. So, I’m taking my chances.”\n\nRondo’s replacement, Alex Caruso, has shown he can be a good defender, but Lillard is a four-time All-NBA player. He can pull up from anywhere on the court and can pick out a pass better than most players. Caruso will certainly have a tough time. As for McCollum, Danny Green is an excellent defender. He may be getting old, but he still can clamp up his opposition.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nAs it stands, the Blazers are the ninth seed, 3.5 games behind the Grizzlies who hold the last playoff spot. They will need to be at their best and hope the Grizzlies and the tenth seed Pelicans can stumble."
