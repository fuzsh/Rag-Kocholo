        "text": "Arizona Wildcats alumnus Gilbert Arenas and former USC stadnout Nick Young appeared on the Road Trippin’ Podcast this week, along with two fellow ex-Wildcats in Channing Frye and Richard Jefferson.\n\nFrye, Arenas and Jefferson related multiple hilarious stories about some of Arizona’s best teams at the turn of the century. Many of the stories related to Arenas’ troublemaking reputation, including the best tale of the bunch ... which may not be true.\n\nFrye told a tale of their first day of classes at the UA, in which Arenas decided to stick with Frye throughout their very first class. Arenas loudly proclaimed that he was bored with the class, and stomped out of the auditorium, turning off the lights as he went.\n\nHere is a clip of the story posted to Road Trippin’s Twitter page.\n\nHere’s the thing: Arenas and Frye didn’t actually attend UA at the same time. Arenas was there from 1999-2001, entering the 2001 NBA Draft (and going 31st overall to the Golden State Warriors. Frye arrived at UA that fall, staying four seasons before getting taken in the first round of the 2005 draft by the New York Knicks.\n\nMaybe Arenas decided to hang out with Frye on campus in between Summer League and NBA preseason? Who knows, the story is still funny even if it turns out to be made up."
