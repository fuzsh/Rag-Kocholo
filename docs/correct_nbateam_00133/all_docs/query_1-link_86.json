        "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio - As Channing Frye tantalized Cavaliers fans with his long-distance aim on Wednesday night in splashing four 3-pointers to help his new team take down the Charlotte Hornets, it was a night and has been a career that almost didn't happen.\n\nInitially, shooting threes was just a dream of his.\n\nAt 25 during the 2008-09 campaign, the 6-11 forward/center wasn't allowed to take threes. He was playing for the Portland Trail Blazers. It was his second stop after being taken by the New York Knicks at No. 8 in the 2005 draft.\n\nNate McMillian was the coach of the Trail Blazers at the time. Frye's role was to stay down on the block, set solid screens and on occasion the ball would get dumped down to him for scoring opportunities. That's the typical workload for a power forward, especially during those times.\n\nExcept those responsibilities didn't fit Frye's skill set, and it showed in the limited minutes he received.\n\nHe tried to make his case to roam beyond the 3-point arc and add another dimension to his game and for his team, but he was vetoed. He was in his mid-20s and hadn't yet carved out a niche. The Trail Blazers were a young, exciting team trending upward. He played 63 games that year and only hoisted 33 3-pointers. They won 54 games -- making it difficult to pout about his game being held back.\n\n\"I just felt like it wasn't the right situation for me at the time,\" he told cleveland.com. \"There were other guys. They had just paid Travis Outlaw, they had Joel Przybilla, Greg Oden, they had LaMarcus [Aldridge] and so there just weren't any minutes for me. I wanted to go somewhere after four years (in the league) where I could really establish myself.\"\n\nFrye was a free agent at season's end, and his career was at a crossroads.\n\n\"Yes and no I was frustrated,\" Frye said. \"I think any time that you are playing on a team as talented as that, you just want to try to fit in and you feel like you have to trust the coach. But for me, it was trying to figure out what he's trying to accomplish and how I'm going to be successful and earn minutes.\n\n\"At times, it was just figuring things out. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't, but I just stayed true and worked on my game. The assistant coaches were very supportive of me working on other parts of my game. I just got the chance to do that when I went to Phoenix.\"\n\nDuring the free-agent process that summer, Frye said it wasn't about finding a team that would allow him to expand his game. At that point, he wasn't a proven commodity. It was merely about finding a team that saw some value in him.\n\nThe Suns would end up seeing far more than what they were expecting, and Alvin Gentry, the head coach then and currently head coach of the New Orleans Pelicans, is responsible for recognizing Frye's best weapon.\n\nIn a practice session earlier in the season, Frye was participating in a 3-on-3 game when Gentry came over to observe. He eventually abruptly stopped the game.\n\n\"He said, 'Why are you shooting that bad two? Just take a step back,'\" Frye remembered. \"And he goes, 'Keep shooting them until you can't shoot anymore.' And he was like, 'If you keep missing, they'll blame me. Just keep shooting that ball.'\"\n\nThat was the encouragement Frye waited five years to hear. He took heed, launching 392 3-pointers and splashing them in at a blistering 43 percent rate. In his previous four seasons, he had 70 total attempts behind the arc.\n\nWhen I covered the Trail Blazers, Frye was always a player fans brought up as \"the one they let get away too soon.\" He was beloved even though he only played two seasons there, and the feeling was mutual. Frye loved Portland so much that he made it his off-season residence.\n\nThat 3-point shot he added to his game turned him into a valuable talent, and that was before the evolution of the stretch-power forward. He's now 10 years in and still letting them fly from deep and hitting them with regularity at 39 percent for his career.\n\nHad it not been for Gentry, would Frye have experienced such longevity?\n\n\"I don't really know, to be honest,\" Frye said. \"With the way the NBA is going, I was luckily ahead of the curve. Right now, being able to guard most fives and space the floor is a unique ability, especially when you have such big three- and four-men now. It's a skill that I honed and here we are.\"\n\nFrye is here in Cleveland, creating more havoc for the opposition. Playing free with the coach's support is a player's dream. Frye has been living that dream out for the second half of his career and now he's hoping his talent aids in bringing a title to Northeast Ohio.\n\nFrye and the Cavaliers can thank one individual.\n\n\"Gentry, without a doubt saw something nobody else did. 100 percent,\" Frye said."
