        "text": "Sales of fruited IPA in honor of retired Cavs star will benefit charity\n\nChanning Frye is known for his 3-point shot. Well, that and winning an NBA championship with the Cavaliers.\n\nSoon, he may be known for craft beer, too.\n\nFrye, who retired this year from the Cavs after a 13-year NBA career, is teaming up with Sibling Revelry Brewing in Westlake to brew a special fruited IPA. Proceeds will benefit Athletes vs Crohn’s & Colitis, a charity founded by current Cavalier Larry Nance Jr. and Noah Weber.\n\nFrye and Nance stopped by the brewery last week to spitball ideas.\n\n“We spent the entire afternoon sipping beers and talking about what [Frye] wanted in a beer,” brewer Pete Velez said. “He was very specific and very cool. … He’s no slouch when it comes to craft beer. He knows what he’s talking about.”\n\nThe beer — which doesn’t have a name yet — will be available on draft and in six-packs of cans. Velez expects that it will hit the market in June.\n\nHe added that they are still working out which fruit to use.\n\n“We’re testing a few different flavors,” he said.\n\nFrye wasn’t available for comment.\n\nSibling Revelry teased the collaboration on Facebook, saying, “As Channing Frye kicks off his retirement, we’ve teamed up on a very cool project for a great cause. Keep an eye out for official details very soon — you won’t want to miss it!”\n\nThe collaboration came about after Sibling Revelry noticed that Frye was drinking one of its beers during his retirement announcement. The brewery then reached out to him to see if they could work together.\n\nVelez, who had never hung out with professional athletes before, described both Frye and Nance as down to earth.\n\n“They could not have been cooler guys,” he said. “It made it more exciting to work with them.”\n\nPrison beer fest\n\nPour One Nine — the only Ohio beer festival held on the grounds of a former state prison — returns Thursday to the Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield.\n\nThe event, which runs from 5:30 to 9 p.m., will showcase the following breweries: BrewDog, Great Black Swamp, JAFB, Laxton Hollow, Little Fish, Phoenix, Stein, Twin Oast and Uniontown. There also will be wine, music, tours of the cell blocks and a ghost hunt after dark.\n\nThe Ohio State Reformatory opened in 1896 and housed prisoners until 1990. It’s most famous for serving as the prison in the movie \"The Shawshank Redemption\" and attracts thousands of tourists each year. In addition to \"Shawshank\" tours — this year marks the 25th anniversary of the film — it hosts paranormal ghost walks and Halloween haunts.\n\n\"Shawshank\" wasn’t the only movie shot at the prison. \"Tango & Cash,\" \"Air Force One\" and the upcoming action movie \"Escape Plan 3: Devil’s Station\" filmed scenes there.\n\nGeneral admission tickets are $45. Early entry tickets are $55.\n\nFor more details or to buy tickets, go to: https://pouronenine.com/pour-one-nine-osr.\n\nSaison affair\n\nBookhouse Brewing wants to honor saisons.\n\nThe brewery, 1526 W. 25th St., Cleveland, will host \"Grande Fête Saisonnière\" — a celebration dedicated to farmhouse ales, saisons, bieres de garde and grisettes — from noon to 4 p.m. May 26.\n\nIn addition to Bookhouse beers, the event will showcase brews from Butcher and the Brewer, Brick and Barrel, Terrestrial, Noble Beast, Jolly Scholar, Akronym, BottleHouse, Jackie O's and Saucy.\n\nTickets are $35 in advance or $45 the day of the event. Tickets will include a waffle made to order by Waffle Bar.\n\nFor more details or tickets, go to: www.facebook.com/bookhousebrewing.\n\nGreat Lakes wins\n\nGreat Lakes Brewing Co. won two medals at the 2019 World Expo of Beer Commercial Competition.\n\nThe event, held in Frankenmuth, Michigan, coincides with the World Expo of Beer festival, which will take place May 17-18. The judging was held April 20.\n\nEdmund Fitzgerald won a silver in the “Brown British” category, while Holy Moses took home a bronze in the Belgian category. Great Lakes, located in Cleveland, was the only Ohio brewery to earn medals in the event.\n\nThe best of show award went to Lumber Baron’s 1842 Pilsner. There were 803 entries."
