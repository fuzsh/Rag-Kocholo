        "text": "Channing Frye sees more than just Phoenix Suns' surprising 6-0 surge in the NBA restart.\n\n\"When you have a mix of culture, talent and discipline, wins are going to start happening,\" he said Tuesday morning. \"And once they figured out how hard it was to win, they took it the next level. You're seeing this in the bubble. They came there with a different attitude than most other teams. They believe they can win.\"\n\nFrye is impressed with his former team and hometown Suns (32-39), believes they'll win their final two regular-season \"seeding\" games, but doesn't see them reaching the playoffs for the first time since 2010.\n\n\"I do think they win out for sure,\" said the NBA analyst for Turner Sports. \"... Even though they might not make it because I think the (Portland Trail) Blazers are a better team. I think the Blazers are built for the playoffs, I think next year, the Suns have a chance. They just need maybe one or two bigger players, but other than that, I'm impressed. Everyone is impressed. They are the talk of the bubble.\"\n\nOnly a game behind eight-place Memphis (33-38) and a half game behind ninth-place Portland (33-39), Phoenix faces Philadelphia today and concludes its seeding schedule Thursday against Dallas at 1 p.m. on TNT.\n\n\"The Suns expect to compete and beat everyone and that is a huge transition from having a losing culture,\" Frye said. \"If you have guys where they don't know what their job is every night, then you start seeing guys, they don't give each other high-fives. They don't communicate when there are miscues. They just kind of look at each other and try to blame each other. Looking for answers, but this team, when they make mistakes, they huddle together. They get it right. They talk.\"\n\nFrye credits Suns head coach Monty Williams, General Manager James Jones and members of the front office for putting together collection of talent that defends, \"plays the game the right way\" and is hungry.\n\n\"This is who we are,\" Williams said after Saturday's win over Miami. \"We've been this competitive all year. We've been a scrappy team all year long. We play hard, we share the ball. We try to make the right plays. We're trying to stick to our DNA and not get outside of it.\"\n\nFrye was on the last Suns team to reach the postseason as that 2009-10 squad started 14-3 en route to winning 54 games in the regular season under Alvin Gentry. They defeated Portland and swept San Antonio in the playoffs to set up a conference finals showdown against Kobe Bryant and the defending NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers.\n\n\"We came in that season, we looked around like, yo, we got something here and we believed,\" said Frye, the former Arizona star who averaged 11.2 points and shot 43.9% from 3 that season in Phoenix.\n\n\"Our attitude was, we have a style that everyone liked playing. Our chemistry was some of the best I ever played with in my career and we believed.\"\n\nThe Suns were looking to take a 3-2 series lead as they came back from 18 points down to tie the game on an Jason Richardson 3 with 3.5 seconds left in regulation.\n\nEveryone in Staples Center knew Bryant was taking the shot after the timeout, but who thought he'd airball it.\n\nFrye didn't\n\n\"Most of the time, you expect Kobe to hit the rim or anything or pretty much make it,\" Frye said.\n\nUnfortunately for the Suns, Ron Artest caught the Bryant misfire and scored with no time remaining to give the Lakers an 103-101 win and 3-2 series lead going back to Phoenix.\n\n\"I was like, oh my lawd,\" said Frye, who was boxing out Gasol on the Bryant shot. \"I said, damn.\"\n\nSteve Nash drew attention for essentially saying the Suns would win Game 6 to force a decisive Game 7 back in Los Angeles.\n\nPhoenix probably would've done so if it wasn't for Bryant.\n\nThe Hall of Famer scored nine of his game-high 37 points in the final two minutes in leading the Lakers to an 111-103 victory that left Frye at a loss.\n\n\"I've smoked a cigarette twice in my life and one was after that game just because it was ridiculous,\" Frye laughed. \"I've never seen anyone go to that level of playing basketball until I played with Kyrie (Irving) and Bron (LeBron James), but we gave Kobe the chance to be Kobe and that was our fault.\"\n\nTen years later, Phoenix is looking to return to the playoffs with a player who idolizes Bryant and has displayed a Mamba Mentality in the bubble â€“ Devin Booker.\n\nAveraging 30.3 points through six seeding games, Booker has arguably been the best player in the bubble, a crown Frye said was being worn by former Suns forward T.J. Warren before having an off game in Indiana's loss Monday to Miami.\n\n\"I feel like we expect that from Devin Booker,\" Frye said. \"I think that's the only difference. Do I think he's playing at a super high level? Obviously. If it wasn't T.J. Warren getting 50, it would definitely be Booker.\"\n\nFrye believes Suns are getting contributions from \"guys we haven't even heard of\" to help out Booker, but he is noticing the first-time All-Star's growth in terms of sharing the ball and defending.\n\nTo Frye, that's all centered around one word.\n\nTrust.\n\n\"He wanted to be a winner,\" Frye said. \"And now they've put winners around now him and you're starting to seem them win games because he's freaking good and he allows other players to be good also.\"\n\nHave opinion about current state of the Suns?
