        "text": "By: Redding Longaker\n\nStanding at 7’0”, a three point machine with post moves that are unstoppable, introducing Channing Frye!\n\nIn the NBA Frye played for 14 years for six different teams. One was the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\n“It was amazing to play for the Blazers. I got to play with a young Brandon Roy and Lamarcus Aldridge,” said Frye. “The Blazers are good but the west has a lot of good teams this year, including the Lakers, the Clippers, the Rockets, the Nuggets and the Timberwolves, so it’s gonna be rough for them,” he said. “This year I think that they will make the 5th or 6th seed in the playoffs; because the west is stacked this year [the Blazers] will probably make a 1st round exit.”\n\nFrye’s strength in the NBA was shooting. His average 3 point percentage throughout his career was 38.8 percent. This might seem low, but the average NBA three point percentage is just 40 or 42%. He also had a high field goal percentage of 44 percent; in the NBA the average field goal percentage is between 43 and 46 percent. Lastly he had a very high free throw percentage, 82 percent. The NBA average is 75 to 78 percent.\n\nIn his final season in the NBA 2018-19, Frye played for the Cleveland Cavaliers. He averaged a low field goal percentage of 36 percent (the average field goal percentage of the 2018-19 season was 46.1 percent), but he had a high three point percentage of 40.5 percent and the average three point field goal percentage was 35.5% so he really dominated that stat. He also had a high free throw percentage of 78.6% (the average free throw percentage was 76%).\n\nThe 6 teams that Frye played for were the New York Knicks for the 2005-06 to 2006-07 season, Portland Trail Blazers for the 2007-08 to 2008-09 season, Phoenix Suns for the 2009-10 to 2011-12 season, Phoenix Suns again for the 2013-14 season, Orlando Magic for the 2014-15 to 2015-16 season, Cleveland Cavaliers for the 2015-16 to 2017-18 season, Los Angeles Lakers for the rest of the 2017-18 season. He ended his career with the Cleveland Cavaliers for the 2018-19 season.\n\n“To play in the NBA was a dream come true,” said Frye. “I always worked as hard as I could and challenged myself everyday to be better than I was the day before. I am an NBA champion and to reach that level, that not a lot of players have that feels even better.”\n\nCurrently Frye is living on a farm with his wife and four kids. He still travels all around the world to do TV basketball broadcasting and also to travel for fun, for example last weekend Frye went to Nebraska with Dwyane Wade to see a Corn Huskers football game.\n\nHe isn’t ready to talk about his future career plans.\n\n“Honestly it’s a surprise,” said Frye. “I’m still involved with basketball, but I want to keep my next job a secret until the last moment, LOL.”"
