        "text": "Channing Frye belongs to another era of Portland Trail Blazers basketball.\n\nHe was a role player—if an unusually charismatic one, the type to write movie reviews in his free time—in middle of the Brandon Roy years. It was a post-Sheed, pre-Dame era when the front office was as interested in moral fiber as shot percentage.\n\nAs Casey Jarman wrote in WW's 2008 cover profile of Frye:\n\nTimes have changed for Frye. For one thing, he overcame a huge health scare that threatened his career. For another, he got a championship ring with LeBron.\n\nThis week in the Players' Tribune, Frye writes about how he joined the Cleveland Cavaliers mid-season, en route to a dramatic NBA Finals win over the Golden State Warriors.\n\nThe secret, says Frye? Breakfast burritos.\n\nFrye goes on even more about the burritos and the French toast. In fact, the essay is entitled Let's Enjoy This Wonderful French Toast.\n\nThis is a wake-up call. A city with as much brunch pride as Portland shouldn't be getting punked this badly in the breakfast-burrito department.\n\nUPDATE, 3 pm Sunday: Challenge accepted! Trail Blazers digital reporter Casey Holdahl notes that the team's shootaround food is much improved since 2009.\n\n\"The post-practice catered spread (for the players) at the practice facility is ridiculous,\" Holdahl says. \"A lot has changed since Frye left.\"\n\nWillamette Week"
