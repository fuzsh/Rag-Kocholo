        "text": "Orlando Magic veteran forward Channing Frye has been one of the most talked about players around the NBA leading up to the 2016 NBA Trade Deadline. There has been a lot of buzz about him potentially going to help address a need with the Los Angeles Clippers, but the Clippers' reluctance to make a deal with the Magic ultimately cost them as Frye is now reportedly heading to the Cleveland Cavaliers in a three-team trade.\n\nAs first reported by the Sam Amick of USA Today Sports, Frye will be going to Cleveland from Orlando with Cavs center Anderson Varejao winding up with the Portland Trail Blazers in the trade:\n\nAs for the other pieces involved in the deal, the Magic will get at least a second-round pick from the trade:\n\nThere's no word just yet as to what other pieces are involved in this trade, but it would appear on the surface that Cavaliers general manager David Griffin has pulled off a bit of a coup with this deal. Not only is acquiring a useful rotation player that can stretch the floor in Frye in exchange for Varejao, a player whose salary they were actively looking to dump leading up to the deadline.\n\nWe'll update with developments on the deal, including what other pieces are involved."
