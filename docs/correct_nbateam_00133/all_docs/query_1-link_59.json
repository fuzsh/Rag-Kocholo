        "text": "Channing Frye makes gains in comeback from heart issue\n\nPHOENIX — It was no sure thing that Channing Frye would be cleared to participate in training camp until two days before it started.\n\nEven then, Frye warned that he would probably have to do things to the side and not be a full-court participant for a while.\n\nOn the third day of camp, last week, Frye was playing in a scrimmage.\n\nEven then, Frye said that would not mean he would be ready to play in Saturday's intrasquad scrimmage.\n\nFrye logged 24 minutes in the 40-minute game.\n\nEven then, Frye scoffed at the idea that he might play in a preseason game. After all, he was a mere week into resuming basketball activity after missing a season for an enlarged heart.\n\nFrye scored 14 points in 16 minutes of the Suns' 104-98 preseason victory Wednesday night at the Portland Trail Blazers, his former team — and his off-season home. Frye made three of his four three-point attempts but his shot was even better than the box score shows because his first two baskets were shots with his toes on the three-point line.\n\n\"I talked to (Suns coach) Jeff (Hornacek) and the training staff and they were all like, 'Channing, you're a lot better than you think you are,' \" Frye said Thursday. \"I trust Jeff and our coaching staff a lot to keep my minutes to where I was comfortable. Go figure, I wanted to play some more. I felt great. I was pretty shocked at myself. Even though it's just preseason, it's growing and progressing for me.\"\n\nFrye's confidence in what he was capable of doing grew with each camp day, starting with his first day when he outshot nearly every teammate in an exhausting post-practice drill.\n\nFrye said he needs the preseason work to become cohesive with new teammates, learn how opponents will play him and get his game conditioning back.\n\n\"We practice, but with 18 people, it's tough to get enough time to play,\" Frye said. \"Practice is one pace, like a seven or eight. A game is like a 10 or 11. Playing against different people and how I don't know their scouting report or how teams will play me is really going to help speed up this process. I have to continue to get stronger but this will help.\"\n\nFrye checked in Wednesday with 9:24 remaining in the second quarter to little fanfare at Moda Garden — but for his cheering section of 30 friends and relatives.\n\nA few seconds later, Frye screened for Goran Dragic and popped open to the three-point line. Dragic kicked it out and Frye sank the shot, albeit for a long 2-pointer.\n\n\"I definitely had a gut bomb, like a gut bomb as in, 'Don't be nervous,' \" Frye said. \"Goran knows. Just give me one shot early and it'll calm me down.\"\n\nThat looked to be true when he set a side screen for Eric Bledsoe and slid to the corner for another swished long 2-pointer. Even when he had to reach far left to catch a Marcus Morris pass later, he sank his first three without hesitation. His only miss was a three that rattled out but he added two more second-half threes, one bouncing high off the front rim and in and the other from well beyond the arc.\n\n\"I was just comfortable there,\" Frye said of playing in Portland. \"Anytime you play a city that you live in or a team that you used to play for, you have a chip on your shoulder. I just don't like losing to the Blazers or the Knicks or the Lakers or the Spurs.\"\n\nHis return is more than a warm fuzzy. The Suns need to see Frye with new teammates because he brings a different element to the front line as the team's best shooter. His three-point ability spreads the floor for a team laden with rim attackers.\n\n\"You can't have five guys in the paint if you have guys like that,\" Frye said. \"People will say, 'Why don't you get in the paint?' and I say, 'Well, as soon as you find somebody who shoots better threes than me, then I'll go in there.' I've got to do my job for our team to win.\"\n\nFrye was not always nimble on defense. He grabbed one rebound in 16 minutes and fouled twice. He had trouble in a post-up against guard Wesley Matthews and got stripped when he was double-teamed. It was not perfect but it was far beyond expectations for a man who last played 18 months ago.\n\nAnother gut bomb is coming when he checks into a game at US Airways Center in front of fans who already touched him.\n\n\"I'm continually amazed by the support of people,\" Frye said. \"A lot of people are like, 'Channing, you're inspiring.' I just love playing basketball. I just love the challenge. I'm not going to be crisp or super juicy — maybe sort of juicy.\""
