Former Trail Blazers big man Channing Frye addressed his offseason intentions on Friday. The 35-year-old center and current Cavaliers reserve, cleared the air regarding his retirement. According to Frye, the 2018-19 season will serve as his final NBA campaign.

Frye landed in Portland as part of the trade that sent Zach Randolph to the Knicks prior to the 2007-08 season. Once with the Blazers, the former Arizona standout was featured in 141 regular season games (21 starts). His time in Portland coincided with the ascension of Blazers legend Brandon Roy.

After bouncing around the league, Frye was a member of the Cavsâ€™ title-winning team in 2016. Frye has appeared in 29 games this season and is currently averaging 9.5 minutes per game.
