Portland Trail Blazers forward Channing Frye will likely miss the start of the NBA season after having surgery to remove bone spurs from his left ankle.

The arthroscopic surgery was performed Monday in Southern California, and the team said he is expected to miss eight to 10 weeks.

The six-foot-1-inch Frye averaged 6.8 points in 78 games last season and is expected to again be a key reserve, backing up power forward LaMarcus Aldridge.

Frye, selected eighth overall by the New York Knicks in 2005, was dealt to Portland in June 2007 as part of the Zach Randolph deal.

Forward Ike Diogu, who was acquired from the Indiana Pacers earlier this summer, could see additional time in Frye's absence.

Portland opens the 2008-09 campaign Oct. 28 in Los Angeles against the Lakers.
