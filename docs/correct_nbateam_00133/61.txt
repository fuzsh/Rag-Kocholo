The Portland Trail Blazers have been part of plenty of trade rumors lately. Channing Frye knows this. One player in particular whose name is being thrown around is superstar guard CJ McCollum.

It is unclear if the team is actually considering trading the star. If they are though, the question has to be – just how much can they get for him? Well according to NBCSports.com, former NBA player Channing Frye has an idea on that.

Frye spoke about what he believes the trade value of McCollum is. Spoiler warning, he feels it's very high.

The former NBA player used the Boston Celtics as an example. He said that if you wanted McCollum from Frye, he would want Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart in return.

Frye does say that he would throw someone in with McCollum, but that should tell you just how highly he thinks of the guard.

There is an obvious reason to be so high on the Portland star. Last season, he put up great numbers. That includes 22.2 points per game, 4.2 rebounds per game and 4.4 assists per game. Meanwhile, he shot 45.1% from the field and 37.9% from three.

The rebounds and assists per game were both career-highs. Meanwhile, the points per game was the second highest of his career.

The big thing last season was that 37.9% from three. That's actually quite a bit lower than CJ McCollum's career average of 39.7%. So if he can get that number back up, just imagine how good his numbers could be.

CJ McCollum also just turned 29 in September. There are still quite a few great years left in him.

All of that combined has to make CJ McCollum a coveted prize. If Portland is actually considering trading him, it will likely bring something great back in return.
