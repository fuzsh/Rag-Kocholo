        "text": "There are 6 parts in total to this writing: *One: Paleolithic or Old Stone Age in China and Different Approaches to Defining Civilization *Two: Early Neolithic China: Ritual, Religion, and Civilization *Three: Middle Neolithic China: Ritual, Religion, Elites, and Language *Four: Late Neolithic and Bronze Age China: Ritual, Religion, Elites, Language, and Empires *Five: Bronze Age and Ancient China: Ritual, Religion, Elites, Language, and Empires *Six: Ancient China: Ritual, Religion, Elites, Language, and Empires\n\nThe following bibliography is a byproduct of the named authors’ article on “Northwestern Medieval Chinese” published in The Encyclopedia of Chinese Language and Linguistics (ECLL). In its current form it primarily covers publications in Chinese, English, French, German and Japanese. It will be expanded and corrected in the future – any comments are welcome. Sven Osterkamp, Bochum [sven.osterkamp@rub.de] Christoph Anderl, Ghent [christoph.anderl@ugent.be] For producing this second expanded draft version, many thanks for corrections and suggestions for additions are due to: CHÉN Huáiyǔ 陈怀宇, D. Neil SCHMID, Kirill SOLONIN and WÁNG Dīng 王丁. Furthermore, special thanks for their generous support in procuring copies of several difficult-to-obtain publications go to TAKEUCHI Yasunori 武内康則 and YOSHIDA Yutaka 吉田豊.\n\nThe volume, The Oxford Handbook on Early China, offers a rich assembly of pioneering research on pre-imperial China. The study is a coordinated, multidisciplinary approach focused on the period before the establishment of imperial rule, encompassing the whole span of time from the Neolithic through Eastern Zhou eras, ca. 5000–250 bce. Our approach is multidisciplinary in encompassing fields ranging from archaeology, anthropology, art history, architecture, metallurgy, literature, religion, paleography, cosmology, prehistory, to history. This interdisciplinary perspective of 33 authors profoundly enhances our understanding of early China and its cultural achievements in multiple directions."
