They oppose Israeli policies that undermine the livelihoods, human, civil and political rights of the Palestinian people and support the right of Israelis to live in freedom and security within Israel’s 1967 borders (see: http://jfjfp.com/?page_id=2 , http://jfjfp.com/?s=nevegordon and Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews_for_Justice_for_Palestinians ) .\n\nJews for Justice for Palestinians: “Jews for Justice for Palestinians is a network of Jews who are British or live in Britain, practising and secular, Zionist and not. We oppose Israeli policies that undermine the livelihoods, human, civil and political rights of the Palestinian people.\n\nWe support the right of Israelis to live in freedom and security within Israel’s 1967 borders.\n\nAs well as organising to ensure that Jewish opinions critical of Israeli policy are heard in Britain, we extend support to Palestinians trapped in the spiral of violence and repression. We believe that such actions are important in countering antisemitism and the claim that opposition to Israel’s destructive policies is itself antisemitic.\n\nWe cooperate with other organisations on specific issues without necessarily endorsing everything they do.\n\nWe work to build world-wide Jewish opposition to the Israeli Occupation, with like-minded groups around the world and are a founding member of European Jews for a Just Peace, a federation of Jewish groups in ten European countries a federation of Jewish groups in ten European countries whose principles include: condemnation of all violence against civilians in the conflict, no matter by whom it is carried out; recognition of Israel’s 1967 ‘green line’ borders; commitment to the Palestinians’ right to a state in the territories currently occupied by Israel in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza; calling on Israel to acknowledge its part in the creation of the Palestinian refugee problem and its obligation to negotiate a just, fair and practical resolution of the issue.” [1].\n\nAs of 1 October 2013 there were 1,729 signatories ([2].\n\nSignatories as of 1 October 2013 [2]:"
