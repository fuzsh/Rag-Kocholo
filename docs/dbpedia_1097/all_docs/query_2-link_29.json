        "text": "Rudolf Hermann, wind tunnels and aerodynamics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLundquist, Charles A.; Coleman, Anne M.\n\n2008-04-01\n\nRudolf Hermann was born on December 15, 1904 in Leipzig, Germany. He studied at the University of Leipzig and at the Aachen Institute of Technology. His involvement with wind tunnels began in 1934 when Professor Carl Wieselsberger engaged him to work at Aachen on the development of a supersonic wind tunnel. On January 6, 1936, Dr. Wernher von Braun visited Dr. Hermann to arrange for use of the Aachen supersonic wind tunnel for Army problems. On April 1, 1937, Dr. Hermann became Director of the Supersonic Wind Tunnel at the Army installation at Peenemunde. Results from the Aachen and Peenemunde wind tunnels were crucial in achieving aerodynamic stability for the A-4 rocket, later designated as the V-2. Plans to build a Mach 10 'hypersonic' wind tunnel facility at Kochel were accelerated after the Allied air raid on Peenemunde on August 17, 1943. Dr. Hermann was director of the new facility. Ignoring destruction orders from Hitler as WWII approached an end in Europe, Dr. Hermann and his associates hid documents and preserved wind tunnel components that were acquired by the advancing American forces. Dr. Hermann became a consultant to the Air Force at its Wright Field in November 1945. In 1951, he was named professor of Aeronautical Engineering at the University of Minnesota. In 1962, Dr. Hermann became the first Director of the Research Institute at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH), a position he held until he retired in 1970.\n\n27 CFR 9.71 - Hermann.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-04-01\n\n...

Theâ¦\n\nSir Hermann Bondi KCB\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRoxburgh, Ian W.\n\n2007-12-01\n\nHermann Bondi was an Applied Mathematician of distinction who will be remembered by fellow scientists for his outstanding contributions to astronomy, cosmology and General Relativity, and particularly for his pioneering contributions to our understanding of gravitational waves, his foundational work on accretion, and as co-creator with Tommy Gold and Fred Hoyle of the steady state theory of cosmology. But Hermann had an equally important second career in scientific administration: advising the UK Government on the Thames Barrier, as Director General of the European Space Research Organisation (ESRO; now the European Space Agency (ESA)), as Chief Scientific Advisor to the UK Government on Defence and then on Energy, as Chairman of the Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC), and finally as Master of Churchill College, Cambridge. He was knighted in 1973. He continued his research on gravitational radiation throughout his administrative career and published his 16th paper in the series on gravitational waves in 2004. Hermann will be remembered not only for his contributions to science and administration, but for his outstanding communication skills and as a charismatic, warm, and stimulating person.\n\nHermann the Dalmatian as Astronomer\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDadic, Z.\n\nHermann the Dalmatian was the subject of great controversy for philosophers, and here his work and translations are considered. As far as Hermann's work are concerned his prime interest for astronomy and astrology is stressed. Astrological \"predictions\" interested him primarely as predictions of events which are related to global questions, i.e. predicting the future course of events in the universe or destiny of nation as a whole, rather then the destiny of indivinduals. On the other hand it is also evident that Hremann with his knowledge of the Eastern, Arabic scientific tradition and the European spiritual tradition, become one of the most important scientists of his times. Hermann archieved a fruitful syntesis between the two traditions and opened new concepts in science. So he stands as a basic figure at the turning point of European science and the scientific endeavours from the 12th to the 15th century.\n\nSex and the city in decline: Midnight Cowboy (1969) and Klute (1971).\n\nPubMed\n\nCorkin, Stanley\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThis essay looks at two popular and influential films of the late 1960s and early 1970s, which were both shot in New York City: Midnight Cowboy (1969) and Klute (1971). It places them in film history, New York City history, and U.S. urban history more generally, finding that they offer an update on earlier century narratives of the connections between urban areas and deviant sexuality. In this modern version, it is not just a moral tale but also an economic one, where, because of the historical decline of the U.S. city and of New York in particular, sex work becomes a plausible, if unsettling means of support. These films find both narrative and spatial terms for advancing the contemporary antiurban narrative, envisioning New York as an impinging vertical space and seeing possible redemption only in the protagonists leaving the city.\n\nWortschatzliste und Synonyme: Hermann Hesse, \"Siddhartha\" (Vocabulary List and Synonyms for Hermann Hesse's \"Siddhartha\").\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nSchwartzburg, John A.\n\nThis vocabulary and synonym list for Hermann Hesse's \"Siddhartha\" (presently on the German Advanced Placement Program required reading list) is keyed to the Dunham and Wensinger edition published by the Macmillan Company.

(English Title: Hermann Oberth in Italy: \"Kid stuff\")\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBalestrieri, R.\n\n2017-10-01\n\nAfter the Second World War, Italy sought to equip itself with surface-to-air missiles: first with its own projects, then acquiring equipment already developed by the USA. The LAGO Project of the Marina Militare was born for defensive purposes: it was defined with Hermann Oberth in 1950 and was developed in La Spezia from 1951 to 1953.\n\nThe 'chemistry of space': the sources of Hermann Grassmann's scientific achievements.\n\nPubMed\n\nPetsche, Hans-Joachim\n\n2014-10-01\n\nAlbert Lewis's article (Annals of Science, 1977) analysing the influence of Friedrich Schleiermacher on Hermann Grassmann, stimulated many different studies on the founder of n-dimensional outer algebra. Following a brief outline of the various, sometimes diverging, analyses of Grassmann's creative thinking, new research is presented which confirms Lewis's original contribution and widens it considerably. It will be shown that: i. Grassmann, although a self-taught mathematician, was at the centre of a hitherto understated intellectual trend, which was defining for Germany. Initiated by Pestalozzi's concept of elementary mathematical education and culminating in the modern mathematics of the late 19th Century, it was reflected in the contributions of Grassmann, Riemann, Jacobi and Eisenstein. ii. Hermann Grassmann, his father Justus, and his brother Robert were all demonstrably influenced by Schleiermacher's dialectic; however the two brothers responded to it in very different ways. iii. Whilst the more philosophical parts of Hermann's 1844 Extension Theory are characterised by the influence of Schleiermacher and also by the mathematical knowledge of his father, the entire development of this work is the unfolding of a single idea based on the father's interpretation of combinatorial multiplication as a 'chemical conjunction', which was developed largely dialectically by Hermann.\n\nHermann Paul and General Linguistic Theory\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nKoerner, E.

The IRS distinguishes between the recruiting and the retention of physicians and perimts incentives beyond reasonable compensation in the former but not the latter circumstance. This new agreement, while not legally precedential, nevertheless provides guidance for healthcare organizations seeking safe harbor protection.\n\nHermann Mooser, Typhus, Warsaw 1941.\n\nPubMed\n\nLindenmann, Jean\n\n2002-01-01\n\nHermann Mooser (1891-1971), a Swiss rickettsiologist, sent his friend Peyton Rous (1879-1970) of the Rockefeller Institute (New York) a telegram on November 3, 1941, asking for financial help for the manufacture of typhus vaccine in Zurich for the Warsaw Ghetto. His explanatory letter from November 4 reached Rous too late to have any influence on the negative decision (by the Rockefeller Foundation and the American Red Cross) in this matter. Contrary to Weindling's affirmation Mooser was neither in Warsaw in 1941, nor was he a member of the Swiss Sanitary Missions to the eastern front.\n\nFundamentals--Rudolf Virchow and modern medicine.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nReese, D M\n\n1998-01-01\n\nThe 19th century pathologist Rudolf Virchow was a physician, scientist, and revolutionary. The preeminent medical investigator of his day, Virchow remains best-known for his theory of cellular pathology, which laid the conceptual foundation for modern scientific medicine. Less appreciated are Virchow's numerous accomplishments in public health, anthropology, and European politics, including his quest for social justice and democracy in Imperial Germany. The study of Virchow's life and writings may provide contemporary physicians with a powerful role model as we grapple with the complexities of the modern medical enterprise. PMID:9735691\n\n20.

In 1888, he published a paper that outlined how the assessment of music skills in patients with aphasia could lead to a better understanding of aphasia and language. Oppenheim conducted the first comprehensive music assessment as part of a neurologic examination and presented the first case series of music in aphasia. His paper was widely cited and had significant influence over the next 30 years. Although largely unrecognized as such, Oppenheim was an important historical figure in the study of music and neurology.\n\nOn the Path towards Thinking: Learning from Martin Heidegger and Rudolf Steiner\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nDahlin, Bo\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThis paper is a philosophical study of the nature of thinking based on the philosophies of Martin Heidegger and Rudolf Steiner.

The assessment is intended to improve understanding of spatial and temporal variability of aquatic habitat, including habitats thought to be critical for the endangered pallid sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus). Physical aquatic habitat - depth, velocity, and substrate - was assessed around 9 wing dikes and adjacent to the U.S. Route 19 bridge, at discharges varying from 44,000 cubic feet per second (cfs) to 146, 000 cfs during August 2000-May, 2001. For the river as a whole, velocities are bi-modally distributed with distinct peaks relating to navigation channel and wing-dike environments. Velocities predictably showed an increasing trend with increasing discharge. Substrate within wing dikes was dominated by mud at low discharges, whereas the navigation channel had patches of transporting sand, rippled sand, and coarse sand. Discharges that overtopped the wing dikes (about 93,000 cfs, March 2001) were associated with increases of patchy sand, rippled sand, and coarse sand within the wing dikes. When flows were substantially over the wing dikes (146,000 cfs, May 2001) substrates within most wing dikes showed substantial reorganization and coarsening. The habitat assessment provides a geospatial database that can be used to query wing dikes for distributions of depth, velocity, and substrate for comparison with fish samples collected by US Fish and Wildlife Service biologists (Grady and others, 2001). In addition, the assessment documented spatial and temporal variation in habitat within the Hermann reach and over a range of discharges. Measurable geomorphic change--alteration of substrate conditions plus substantial erosion and deposition--was associated with flows equaled or exceeded 12-40% of the time (40-140 days per year). Documented geomorphic change associated with high-frequency flows underscores the natural temporal variability of physical\n\nHermann Hankel's \"On the general theory of motion of fluids\".

Finally, we give a short biography of Hermann Hankel with his complete bibliography.\n\nThe Hermann Weyl Prize - Laudatio for Guilio Chiribella\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\ndel Olmo, M. A.\n\n2011-03-01\n\nThe Hermann Weyl Prize was created in 2000 by the Standing Committee of the International Group Theory Colloquium. The purpose of the Weyl Prize is to provide recognition for young scientists (younger than 35) who have performed original work of significant scientific quality in the area of understanding physics through symmetries. The Hermann Weyl Prize consists of a certificate citing the accomplishments of the recipient, prize money of $500 and an allowance towards the attendance of the bi-annual International Group Theory Colloquium at which the award is presented. The previous winners of the award were: Edward Frenkel (2002), Nikita A Nekrasov (2004), Boyko Bakalov (2006) and Mohammad M Sheikh-Jabbari (2008). The Selection Committee of the Weyl Prize 2010 consisted of S T Ali (Concordia University), E Corrigan (Durham Univeristy), P Kulish (St Petersburg Mathematical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences), R Mosseri (CNRS Paris) and M A del Olmo (University of Valladolid, chairman). This committee has made the following announcement: The Weyl Prize for the year 2010 was awarded to Dr Giulio Chiribella, in recognition of his pioneering work on the application of group theoretical methods in Quantum Information Theory. In particular, for providing a general solution to the problem of optimal estimation of symmertry transformations based on the notion of quantum entanglement between representation and multiplicity spaces, for the derivation of optimal protocols for the alignment of quantum reference frames, for the characterization of extreme quantum measurements in finite dimensions, for the proof of equivalence between asymptotic cloning and state estimation and for the proof of the optimality of measure-and-reprepare for quantum learning of unitary transformations.

Weber's velocity-dependent force law were forced to confront the issue of energy conservation. One attempt to formulate a conservation law for such forces was due to Carl Neumann, who introduced a model employing retarded potentials in 1868. Rudolf Clausius quickly pointed out certain problems with the physical interpretation of Neumann's mathematical formalism. The debate between the two men continued until the 1880's and illustrates the strictures facing mathematical approaches to physical problems during this prerelativistic, pre-Maxwellian period.\n\nForeign Language Teaching in Rudolf Steiner Schools.

Initially, these isolates were characterized as representing Campylobacterfetus subsp. fetus by multiplex PCR and partial 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Further whole- genome characterization revealed considerable differences compared to other Campylobacter species. A polyphasic study was then undertaken to determine the exact taxonomic position of the isolates. The three strains were characterized by conventional phenotypic tests and whole genome sequencing. We generated robust phylogenies that showed a distinct clade containing only these strains using the 16S rRNA and atpA genes and a set of 40 universal proteins. Our phylogenetic analysis demonstrates their designation as representing a novel species and this was further confirmed using whole- genome average nucleotide identity within the genus Campylobacter (~80â%). Compared to most Campylobacter species, these strains hydrolysed hippurate, and grew well at 25âÂ°C but not at 42âÂ°C. Phenotypic and genetic analyses demonstrate that the three Campylobacter strains isolated from the western Hermann's tortoise represent a novel species within the genus Campylobacter, for which the name Campylobactergeochelonis sp. nov. is proposed, with RC20T (=DSM 102159T=LMG 29375T) as the type strain.\n\nThe Receding Animal: Theorizing Anxiety and Attachment in Psychoanalysis from Freud to Imre Hermann.\n\nPubMed\n\nMarinelli, Lydia; Mayer, Andreas\n\n2016-03-01\n\nArgument Animals played an important role in the formation of psychoanalysis as a theoretical and therapeutic enterprise. They are at the core of texts such as Freud's famous case histories of Little Hans, the Rat Man, or the Wolf Man. The infantile anxiety triggered by animals provided the essential link between the psychology of individual neuroses and the ambivalent status of the \"totem\" animal in so-called primitive societies in Freud's attempt to construct an anthropological basis for the Oedipus complex in Totem and Taboo. In the following, we attempt to track the status of animals as objects of indirect observation as they appear in Freud's classical texts, and in later revisionist accounts such as Otto Rank's Trauma of Birth and Imre Hermann's work on the clinging instinct. In the 1920s and 1930s, the Freudian conception of patients' animal phobias is substantially revised within Hermann's original psychoanalytic theory of instincts which draws heavily upon ethological observations of primates. Although such a reformulation remains grounded in the idea of \"archaic\" animal models for human development, it allows to a certain extent to empiricize the speculative elements of Freud's later instinct theory (notably the death instinct) and to come to a more embodied account of psychoanalytic practice.\n\nHermann Carl Vogel's report on a tour to England, Scotland and Ireland in the year 1875.

W.\n\n2004-12-01\n\nWe briefly describe the life of the astronomer Hermann Kobold, who lived from 1858 to 1942. He worked at the observatories of O'Gyalla, Strasbourg and Kiel, and was also involved in the observations and reductions of the German Venus transit project, 1874/82. His autobiography spans the time between his youth and his leave from Strasbourg in 1902. The subsequent time as observer and professor in Kiel and long-time editor of the Astronomische Nachrichten is not covered. The autobiography \"Blaetter der Erinnerung\" (Leaves of memeory), presented in the subsequent article, was written in his late age when he was already blind, using a special device. We also present some photographs of Kobold and his contemporaries, taken in Gottingen, O'Gyalla, Aiken (South Carolina), and Strasbourg.\n\nFission-track dating of pumice from the KBS Tuff, East Rudolf, Kenya\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nHurford, A.J.; Gleadow, A.J.W.; Naeser, C.W.\n\n1976-01-01\n\nFission-track dating of zircon separated from two pumice samples from the KBS Tuff in the Koobi Fora Formation, in Area 131, East Rudolf, Kenya, gives an age of 2.44??0.08 Myr for the eruption of the pumice. This result is compatible with the previously published K-Ar and 40Ar/ 39Ar age spectrum estimate of 2.61??0.26 Myr for the KBS Tuff in Area 105, but differs from the more recently published K-Ar date of 1.82??0.04 Myr for the KBS Tuff in Area 131.

For example, individuals translocated during reinforcement programmes may not adapt to their novel host environment and may exhibit elevated chronic levels of stress hormones and/or decreasing body condition. Conversely, successful conservation actions should be associated with a lack of detrimental physiological perturbation. However, physiological references fluctuate over time and are influenced by various factors (e.g. sex, age, reproductive status). It is therefore necessary to determine the range of natural variations of the selected physiological metrics to establish useful baselines. This study focuses on endangered free-ranging Hermann's tortoises ( Testudo hermanni hermanni ), where conservation actions have been preconized to prevent extinction of French mainland populations. The influence of sex and of environmental factors (site, year and season) on eight physiological parameters (e.g. body condition, corticosterone concentrations) was assessed in 82 individuals from two populations living in different habitats. Daily displacements were monitored by radio-tracking. Most parameters varied between years and seasons and exhibited contrasting sex patterns but with no or limited effect of site. By combining behavioural and physiological traits, this study provides sex-specific seasonal baselines that can be used to monitor the health status of Hermann's tortoises facing environmental threats (e.g. habitat changes) or during conservation actions (e.g. translocation). These results might also assist in selection of the appropriate season for translocation.\n\nBody condition and habitat use by Hermann's tortoises in burnt and intact habitats\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLecq, S.; Ballouard, J.-M.; Caron, S.; Livoreil, B.; Seynaeve, V.; Matthieu, L.-A.; Bonnet, X.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIn Mediterranean regions, fires threaten terrestrial tortoises. Nevertheless, varying proportions of adults survive fire; these surviving individuals can play a central role for population recovery. The regions devastated by fire often include important habitat of Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni hermanni), so assessing the ability of survivors to persist is essential for conserving the species. Body-condition indices provide an integrative estimate of how well individuals cope with environmental variations and impacts, including fires. Between 2002 and 2009, we monitored Hermann's tortoises in intact and burnt habitats in southeastern France. In summer 2003, a strong fire ravaged half of the surveyed zone, providing an opportunity to compare body condition of tortoises between intact and burnt areas over time. Six years later, the impact of fire on vegetation was still marked; large trees were abundant in the intact area, whereas open shrub vegetation prevailed in the burnt area. In both areas, the mean body condition of tortoises fluctuated over time; however, there were no differences between the two areas. A radio-tracking experiment demonstrated that individuals from each area were residents, and not vagrants commuting between areas. We also assessed changes in body condition and microhabitat use in radio-tracked individuals. We found no significant differences between the tortoises living in the burnt and intact areas, despite subtle differences in habitat use. In conclusion: (i)â surviving tortoises in an area ravaged by fire can maintain their body condition like individuals living in an intact area, and thus, individuals from burnt areas should not be translocated to supposedly better areas; and (ii)â depopulated burnt areas are likely to be appropriate for population-augmentation programmes.

This article aims to contribute to recent efforts to overcome the gaps in the historiography of contemporary psychology, which are the result of an empiricist bias. To this end, we present an analysis of the way in which Hermann von Helmholtz's theory of perception resonates with Johann Gottlieb Fichte's Ego-doctrine. It will be argued that this indebtedness is particularly clear when focusing on the foundation of the differential awareness of subject and object in perception. In doing so, the widespread reception of Helmholtz's work as proto-positivist or strictly empiricist is challenged, in favor of the claim that important elements of his theorizing can only be understood properly against the background of Fichte's Ego-doctrine.

Hermann Weyl's contribution to neutrino physics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDe Bianchi, Silvia\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThis paper focuses on Hermann Weyl's two-component theory and frames it within the early development of different theories of spinors and the history of the discovery of parity violation in weak interactions. In order to show the implications of Weyl's theory, the paper discusses the case study of Ettore Majorana's symmetric theory of electron and positron (1937), as well as its role in inspiring Case's formulation of parity violation for massive neutrinos in 1957. In doing so, this paper clarifies the relevance of Weyl's and Majorana's theories for the foundations of neutrino physics and emphasizes which conceptual aspects of Weyl's approach led to Lee's and Yang's works on neutrino physics and to the solution of the theta-tau puzzle in 1957. This contribution thus sheds a light on the alleged \"re-discovery\" of Weyl's and Majorana's theories in 1957, by showing that this did not happen all of a sudden. On the contrary, the scientific community was well versed in applying these theories in the 1950s on the ground of previous studies that involved important actors in both Europe and United States.\n\nThe life of Rudolf Nissen: advancing surgery through science and principle.\n\nPubMed\n\nFults, D W; Taussky, P\n\n2011-06-01\n\nRudolf Nissen (1896-1981) was a surgeon whose career began in Germany during the first third of the 20th century, a period of rapid progress in biomedical technology, during which neurosurgery, anesthesiology, and other specialties emerged. A protÃ©gÃ© and later close colleague of thoracic surgery pioneer Ferdinand Sauerbruch (1875-1951), Nissen resigned from the Berlin CharitÃ© Clinic and left Germany in 1933, in response to the rise of Nazi fascism. Throughout his subsequent career in Istanbul, Turkey, the American cities of Boston and New York, and finally Basel, Switzerland, Nissen developed innovative surgical techniques, advocated for patient-centered medical education, and promoted surgical subspecialization. A lifelong proponent of clear scientific writing, Nissen expressed, in extensively published work, his philosophy that progress in surgery depends critically on rigorously applying the scientific method, upholding professional integrity, and respecting human dignity.\n\n[\"With paper, pencil, and slide rule.\" Cancer specialist Hermann Druckrey in internment camp Hammelburg (1946-1947)].\n\nPubMed\n\nWunderlich, Volker\n\n2008-01-01\n\nAfter World War II, Hermann Druckrey and Karl KÃ¼pfmÃ¼ller spent many months in allied internment camps in Germany. In camp Hammelburg, the scholars formed a research collaboration which resulted in two very important publications. Druckrey informed Adolf Butenandt about the co-operation in personal letters which have recently become accessible. Through this new source, the origins of the Druckrey-KÃ¼pfmÃ¼ller papers of 1948-1949 have been confirmed and some further details have been added.\n\n[Scientific theoretical founding of medicine as a natural science by Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-1894)].\n\nPubMed\n\nNeumann, J N\n\n1994-01-01\n\nIn this study an attempt will be made to discuss the epistemological problems in the theory and practice of modern technical medicine in the writings of Hermann von Helmholz. An inquiry into the relationship between von Helmholtz' thinking and the critical philosophy of Immanuel Kant is followed by the characteristics of von Helmholtz' philosophy of science which he himself called \"empirical theory\". The question of medicine as a science finally leads to the main problem of medical epistemology, viz., the relationship between theoretical knowledge and practice in medicine. In this context the anthropological dimension is brought into consideration.\n\nWhy is the World four-dimensional? Hermann Weylâs 1955 argument and the topology of causation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDe Bianchi, Silvia\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThis paper approaches the question of space dimensionality by discussing a neglected argument proposed by Hermann Weyl in 1955. In Why is the World Four-Dimensional? (1955), Weyl offered a different argument from the one generally attributed to him and presented in Raum-Zeit-Materie. In the first sections of the paper, this new argument and its features are spelled-out, and in the last section, I shall develop some useful remarks on the concept of topology of causation that can still inform our reflection on the dimensionality of the world.\n\nThe Hermann-Hering grid illusion demonstrates disruption of lateral inhibition processing in diabetes mellitus.\n\nPubMed\n\nDavies, Nigel P; Morland, Antony B\n\n2002-02-01\n\nThe Hermann-Hering grid illusion consists of dark illusory spots perceived at the intersections of horizontal and vertical white bars viewed against a dark background. The dark spots originate from lateral inhibition processing. This illusion was used to investigate the hypothesis that lateral inhibition may be disrupted in diabetes mellitus. A computer monitor based psychophysical test was developed to measure the threshold of perception of the illusion for different bar widths. The contrast threshold for illusion perception at seven bar widths (range 0.09 degrees to 0.60 degrees) was measured using a randomly interleaved double staircase. Convolution of Hermann-Hering grids with difference of Gaussian receptive fields was used to generate model sensitivity functions. The method of least squares was used to fit these to the experimental data. 14 diabetic patients and 12 control subjects of similar ages performed the test. The sensitivity to the illusion was significantly reduced in the diabetic group for bar widths 0.22 degrees, 0.28 degrees, and 0.35 degrees (p = 0.01). The mean centre:surround ratio for the controls was 1:9.1 (SD 1.6) with a mean correlation coefficient of R(2) = 0.80 (SD 0.16). In the diabetic group, two subjects were unable to perceive the illusion. The mean centre:surround ratio for the 12 remaining diabetic patients was 1:8.6 (SD 2.1). However, the correlation coefficients were poor with a mean of R(2) = 0.54 (SD 0.27), p = 0.04 in comparison with the control group. A difference of Gaussian receptive field model fits the experimental data well for the controls but does not fit the data obtained for the diabetics. This indicates dysfunction of the lateral inhibition processes in the post-receptoral pathway.\n\nTeaching Mathematics in Rudolf Steiner Schools for Classes I-VIII.

The term \"querulents\" first appeared in the General Order of the Court for the Prussian States (Allgemeine Gerichtsardnung fÃ¼r die Preussischen Staaten) from July 6, 1793. From there on, the spectrum of juridical measures undertaken against the so-labeled litigators included classifying these persons as ineligible for legal action and psychiatric hospitalization. The paper discusses to what extent Hermann Bahr rearranges psychiatric and legal knowledge about this special type of the complainer in his tragi- comedy Der Querulant, premiered in 1914. This concerns, first, the theatricality of the body and speech, secondly, the use of cultural techniques of writing and, thirdly, conflict- ing notions of justice. Therefore, the paper analyzes the aesthetic function of querulous behavior in the dramatic structure of the play from the point of view of both media theory and literary theory.\n\nMemorial Hermann: high reliability from board to bedside.\n\nPubMed\n\nShabot, M Michael; Monroe, Douglas; Inurria, Juan; Garbade, Debbi; France, Anne-Claire\n\n2013-06-01\n\nIn 2006 the Memorial Hermann Health System (MHHS), which includes 12 hospitals, began applying principles embraced by high reliability organizations (HROs). Three factors support its HRO journey: (1) aligned organizational structure with transparent management systems and compressed reporting processes; (2) Robust Process Improvement (RPI) with high-reliability interventions; and (3) cultural establishment, sustainment, and evolution. The Quality and Safety strategic plan contains three domains, each with a specific set of measures that provide goals for performance: (1) \"Clinical Excellence;\" (2) \"Do No Harm;\" and (3) \"Saving Lives,\" as measured by the Serious Safety Event rate. MHHS uses a uniform approach to performance improvement--RPI, which includes Six Sigma, Lean, and change management, to solve difficult safety and quality problems. The 9 acute care hospitals provide multiple opportunities to integrate high-reliability interventions and best practices across MHHS. For example, MHHS partnered with the Joint Commission Center for Transforming Healthcare in its inaugural project to establish reliable hand hygiene behaviors, which improved MHHS's average hand hygiene compliance rate from 44% to 92% currently. Soon after compliance exceeded 85% at all 12 hospitals, the average rate of central line-associated bloodstream and ventilator-associated pneumonias decreased to essentially zero. MHHS's size and diversity require a disciplined approach to performance improvement and systemwide achievement of measurable success. The most significant cultural change at MHHS has been the expectation for 100% compliance with evidence-based quality measures and 0% incidence of patient harm.\n\n[The Base of the Skull. Rudolf Virchow between Pathology and Anthropology].\n\nPubMed\n\nSeemann, Sophie\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThroughout his scientific career, the pathologist and anthropologist Rudolf Virchow (1821-1902) examined countless skulls, gradually changing his perspective on this object of research. Initially, he was mainly concerned with pathologically deformed skulls. From the 1850s onwards, he gradually developed a more anthropological approach, and anthropology increasingly came to dominate his scientific interest. This article shows how different influences became central for the establishment of his specific and dynamic model of the human skull development and its successful application in anthropology. Crucial for this process were Virchow's collaboration with his teacher Robert Froriep (1804-1861) in the department of pathology of the CharitÃ©, his research on cretinism and rickets, as well as his description of the base of the skull as the center of skull development. His research work was attended by and showed a reciprocal interaction with the buildup of large skull collections. This article uses Virchow's original publications on skull pathology as well as his still preserved skull specimens from the collection of the Berlin Museum of Medical History at the CharitÃ© for an integrated text and object based analysis.\n\n[Fatal diseases and \"imaginary\" suffering. \"Hypochondria\" and \"consumption\" in the correspondence between Jean Paul and Johann Bernhard Hermann, with a perspective on Jean Paul's literature and aesthetics].\n\nPubMed\n\nMeier, Monika\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe German writerJean Paul (Johann Paul Friedrich Richter, 1763-1825) and his friendJohann Bernhard Hermann (1761-1790) became acquainted with the thoughts of late Enlightenment at the University of Leipzig. They particularly appreciated the anthropology of Ernst Platner, who taught philosophy and aesthetics as well as medicine. Their confidential correspondence contains reflections on their respective situation and well being. Both write about feeling ill and label their illness \"hypochondria\". In the course of the correspondence Jean Paul's understanding of hypochondria evolves from an illness of the entrails as he follows Hermann, who supports the modern concept of hypochondria as an illness of the nerves. Two important themes from this correspondence recur in Jean Paul's novels and tales: firstly, his way of expressing comfort is related to his aesthetics, and secondly, the satirical way of portraying at least certain aspects of illness as imaginary reappears in his first successful novel \"The Invisible Lodge\" (1793).\n\nHelmholtz and the psychophysiology of time.\n\nPubMed\n\nDebru, C\n\n2001-09-01\n\nAfter having measured the velocity of the nervous impulse in the 1850s, Helmholtz began doing research on the temporal dimensions of visual perception. Experiments dealing with the velocity of propagation in nerves (as well as with aspects of perception) were carried out occasionally for some fifteen years until their final publication in 1871. Although the temporal dimension of perception seems to have interested Helmholtz less than problems of geometry and space, his experiments on the time of perception were technically rather subtle and seminal, especially compared with experiments performed by his contemporaries, such as Sigmund Exner, William James, Rudolf Hermann Lotze, Ernst Mach, Wilhelm Volkmann, and Wilhelm Wundt. Helmholtz's conception of the temporal aspects of perception reflects the continuity that holds between psychophysiological research and the Kantian philosophical background.\n\nHermann Karsten, pioneer of geologic mapping in northwestern South America\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAalto, K. R.\n\n2015-06-01\n\nIn the late 19th century, a regional map of Nueva Granada (present-day Colombia, Panama and parts of Venezuela and Ecuador) was published by German botanist and geologist Hermann Karsten (1817-1908). Karsten's work was incorporated by AgustÃ­n Codazzi (1793-1859), an Italian who emigrated to Venezuela and Colombia to serve as a government cartographer and geographer, in his popular Atlas geogrÃ¡fico e histÃ³rico de la Republica de Colombia (1889). Geologic mapping and most observations provided in this 1889 atlas were taken from Karsten's GÃ©ologie de l'ancienne Colombie bolivarienne: VÃ©nÃ©zuela, Nouvelle-Grenade et Ecuador (1886), as cited by Manual Paz and/or Felipe PÃ©rez, who edited this edition of the atlas. Karsten defined four epochs in Earth history: Primera - without life - primary crystalline rocks, Segunda - with only marine life - chiefly sedimentary rocks, Tercera - with terrestrial quadrupeds and fresh water life forms life - chiefly sedimentary rocks, and Cuarta - mankind appears, includes diluvial (glacigenic) and post-diluvial terranes. He noted that Colombia is composed of chiefly of Quaternary, Tertiary and Cretaceous plutonic, volcanic and sedimentary rocks, and that Earth's internal heat (calor central) accounted, by escape of inner gases, for volcanism, seismicity and uplift of mountains. Karsten's regional mapping and interpretation thus constitutes the primary source and ultimate pioneering geologic research.\n\nIntroduction to the special issue Hermann Weyl and the philosophy of the 'New Physics'\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDe Bianchi, Silvia; Catren, Gabriel\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThis Special Issue Hermann Weyl and the Philosophy of the 'New Physics' has two main objectives: first, to shed fresh light on the relevance of Weyl's work for modern physics and, second, to evaluate the importance of Weyl's work and ideas for contemporary philosophy of physics. Regarding the first objective, this Special Issue emphasizes aspects of Weyl's work (e.g. his work on spinors in n dimensions) whose importance has recently been emerging in research fields across both mathematical and experimental physics, as well as in the history and philosophy of physics. Regarding the second objective, this Special Issue addresses the relevance of Weyl's ideas regarding important open problems in the philosophy of physics, such as the problem of characterizing scientific objectivity and the problem of providing a satisfactory interpretation of fundamental symmetries in gauge theories and quantum mechanics. In this Introduction, we sketch the state of the art in Weyl studies and we summarize the content of the contributions to the present volume.\n\nHermann Cohen's Das Princip der Infinitesimal-Methode: The history of an unsuccessful book.\n\nPubMed\n\nGiovanelli, Marco\n\n2016-08-01\n\nThis paper offers an introduction to Hermann Cohen's Das Princip der Infinitesimal-Methode (1883), and recounts the history of its controversial reception by Cohen's early sympathizers, who would become the so-called 'Marburg school' of Neo-Kantianism, as well as the reactions it provoked outside this group. By dissecting the ambiguous attitudes of the best-known representatives of the school (Paul Natorp and Ernst Cassirer), as well as those of several minor figures (August Stadler, Kurd Lasswitz, Dimitry Gawronsky, etc.), this paper shows that Das Princip der Infinitesimal-Methode is a unicum in the history of philosophy: it represents a strange case of an unsuccessful book's enduring influence. The \"puzzle of Cohen's Infinitesimalmethode,\" as we will call it, can be solved by looking beyond the scholarly results of the book, and instead focusing on the style of philosophy it exemplified. Moreover, the paper shows that Cohen never supported, but instead explicitly opposed, the doctrine of the centrality of the 'concept of function', with which Marburg Neo-Kantianism is usually associated.

The history of a controversy].\n\nPubMed\n\nHinterhuber, Hartmann\n\n2007-01-01\n\nIn both his The Psychopathology of Everyday Life and his Lectures Sigmund Freud derived the terms unconscious, preconscious and conscious, particularly from slips in speech, slips in reading and forgetfulness. In these slips, Freud recognised parallels to dreams. In the work mentioned, he analysed these in depth as part of mental motivation. In the papers referred to, Sigmund Freud paid tribute to Rudolf Meringer and Carl Mayer's study which was published in 1895. Meringer and Mayer showed as phenomena reversals and rearrangement of whole words, syllables or sounds, along with pre-tones or anticipations and echoes, word contaminations and word substitutions as responsible for slips of the tongue. The present work demonstrates how passionately these three scientists have contributed to the controversy of their standpoints. For modern psycholinguistics and the psychology of language, speech errors are always an expression of a momentary malfunction of the human speech production system: for the cognitive process of speech production slips of the tongue offer an insight into speech processing. Pre-tones and echoes, serialization errors, as Meringer and Mayer recognised, represent the vast majority of slips of the tongue. They do not reveal any hidden point. But with lexical-semantic slips of the tongue the question of mental motivation is admissible. This short paper is a sign of appreciation and gratitude: firstly, a modest birthday gift for Sigmund Freud, secondly homage to Carl Mayer, who influenced generations of neurologists in his 40 years of chairing the Psychiatric-Neurological Clinic in Innsbruck, so that Hans Ganner rightly spoke of a \"Carl Mayer School\". But lastly, this short study is also-and especially-a late recognition of Rudolf Meringer, the great Austrian linguist. The view an individual has concerning mental processes and the \"topology of the psychic apparatus\" is decisive as to the power of determination attached to the unconscious.\n\nA contemporary look at Hermann Hankel's 1861 pioneering work on Lagrangian fluid dynamics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFrisch, Uriel; Grimberg, GÃ©rard; Villone, Barbara\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe present paper is a companion to the paper by Villone and Rampf (2017), titled \"Hermann Hankel's On the general theory of motion of fluids, an essay including an English translation of the complete Preisschrift from 1861\" together with connected documents [Eur. Phys. J. H 42, 557-609 (2017)]. Here we give a critical assessment of Hankel's work, which covers many important aspects of fluid dynamics considered from a Lagrangian-coordinates point of view: variational formulation in the spirit of Hamilton for elastic (barotropic) fluids, transport (we would now say Lie transport) of vorticity, the Lagrangian significance of Clebsch variables, etc. Hankel's work is also put in the perspective of previous and future work. Hence, the action spans about two centuries: from Lagrange's 1760-1761 Turin paper on variational approaches to mechanics and fluid mechanics problems to Arnold's 1966 founding paper on the geometrical/variational formulation of incompressible flow. The 22-year-old Hankel - who was to die 12 years later â emerges as a highly innovative master of mathematical fluid dynamics, fully deserving Riemann's assessment that his Preisschrift contains \"all manner of good things.\"\n\nHermann Wilhelm Abich im Kaukasus: Zum zweihundertsten Geburtstag\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSeibold, Ilse; Seibold, Eugen\n\n2006-11-01\n\nHermann Abich was born in 1806 in Berlin and died in 1886 in Graz. He grew up in a wealthy family which had friendly relations with famous scientists like Alexander von Humboldt, Leopold von Buch or Carl Ritter. After his studies in Heidelberg and Berlin he turned to extended fieldwork at the volcanoes of Italy. In 1833 1834 he published excellent petrological/chemical results and got soon a good scientific reputation. Thus he was nominated as Professor for Geology and Mineralogy of the prestigious Russian University in Dorpat (now Tartu, Esthonia) in 1842. In 1844 he was sent to Armenia by the Russian authorities. For the next three decades his fieldwork with about 190 publications was concentrated on the Great and Lesser Caucasus. This was a period of Russian expansion to the South with long-lasting regional fights. But he enjoyed the support of powerful governors. He was an indefatigable and enthusiastic explorer and a precise observer and designer. His interests covered many fields: morphology, glaciology, structural geology, volcanology with Thermal Springs, mineral resources from hydrocarbons, coal, salt to ores, stratigraphy and paleontology as a base for geological maps. But he also gave advice for practical problems, and he was active in meteorology, botany and archaeology. Alltogether he became âthe Father of Caucasus Geologyâ. The following sketch stresses only on three aspects of his activities. He was one of the first pioneers in hydrocarbon exploration, especially around the anticlines with the mud volcanoes near Baku. In many respects, however, his fundamental ideas were erronous. He explained the structure of the Great Caucasus by the traditional theories of Leopold von Buch and Elie de Beaumont. The Caucasus anticline âwas elevated by forces acting from beneathâ. Following them he tried to discover regularities in the strike of mountain chains. Similarily he treated volcanism like Alexander von Humboldt and Leopold von Buch with their two\n\nExcerpt from Medicinische Psychologie oder Physiologie der Seele by Dr Rudolph Hermann Lotze.\n\nPubMed\n\nBerrios, G E\n\n2005-03-01\n\nHermann Lotze (1817-81) is a neglected figure in the history of psychiatry although it has been claimed that his early views were influential, for example, on the young Griesinger. Trained as a physician, psychologist and philosopher he saw better than many the impending epistemological crisis that was to affect disciplines such as psychology and medical psychology as they were being taken over by the natural sciences. The problem he endeavoured to resolve was double-headed. On the one hand, Lotze believed that the mechanisms proposed by physiology and other relevant natural sciences were essential to the explanation of human behaviour provided that its meaning and context were respected; on the other, he wanted to do away with the mysterious (metaphysical) explanations such as 'vital force' which in his time were still popular in biology. The solutions he eventually offered can understandably be seen as a weak compromise and one which statisfied no one. Materialists Ã outrance such as Vogt, BÃ¼chner, Lange and Ribot though he was too 'metaphysical'; spiritualist philosophers believed that he had surrendered too much to biology. It is likely that Lotze remained, in fact, a metaphysician as can be ascertained by studying his concept of Seele (soul, mind) into which he packed enough furniture to make many believe that he was an idealist thinker. This paper discusses some of these issues and justifies the choice of classic text, namely, Lotze's illuminating Introduction to his book Medicinische Psychologie oder Physiologie der Seele.\n\n[From the library of the Netherlands Journal of Medicine. Rudolf Virchow: Die Cellularpathologie in ihrer BegrÃ¼ndung auf physiologische und pathologische Gewebelehre; 1858].\n\nPubMed\n\nMolenaar, J C\n\n2003-11-08\n\nWith the publication of Die Cellularpathologie in ihrer BegrÃ¼ndung auf physiologische und pathologische Gewebelehre in 1858, the author Rudolf Virchow (1821-1902) originated the idea that each cell in each living organism, both plant and animal, originates from another cell and that the origin of disease can only be located in the cell. The book laid the foundations for cell pathology as a scientific discipline and was the most important publication by Virchow, who as doctor and statesman gathered so much fame that he became almost a mythical figure in his own time. The finding that every cell originates from another cell and does not develop from amorphous interstitium is actually attributable to Robert Remak.\n\nHematologic and plasma biochemical changes associated with fenbendazole administration in Hermann's tortoises (testudo hermanni).\n\nPubMed\n\nNeiffer, Donald L; Lydick, Dianna; Burks, Kyle; Doherty, Donna\n\n2005-12-01\n\nToxicosis associated with benzimidazole anthelmintics has been reported with increasing frequency in zoologic collections. Clinical signs, clinicopathologic abnormalities, and gross and histologic lesions are primarily the result of damage to the gastrointestinal and hematopoietic systems. Profound leukopenia, especially granulocytopenia, is the most common and severe clinicopathologic change associated with benzimidazole administration. Death usually occurs from overwhelming systemic bacterial and/or fungal infections secondary to severe immunosuppression. In this 125-day study, six male Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni) were treated orally with two 5-day courses of fenbendazole 2 wk apart at a dosage of 50 mg/kg. Serial blood samples were used to assess hematologic and plasma biochemical changes before, during, and following the treatment period. Although the tortoises remained healthy, blood sampling indicated an extended heteropenia with transient hypoglycemia, hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, and equivocal hyperproteinemia/hyperglobulinemia, which were considered to be in response to fenbendazole administration. Changes in several other clinicopathologic parameters appeared to correlate with fenbendazole administration. The hematologic and biochemical changes seen in the healthy animals in this study should be considered when treating compromised tortoises with fenbendazole. Hematologic and plasma biochemical status of tortoises/reptiles should be determined before treatment and monitored during the treatment period. The risk of mortality of an individual from nematode infection should be assessed relative to the potential for metabolic alteration and secondary septicemia following damage to hematopoietic and gastrointestinal systems by fenbendazole.\n\nA response to Rudolf Klein: a battle may have been won but perhaps not the war.\n\nPubMed\n\nHunter, David J\n\n2013-08-01\n\nThe British National Health Service (NHS) is undergoing possibly the most far-reaching set of changes in its sixty-five-year history. While some commentators (like Rudolf Klein) insist that little of substance is likely to change, others consider that the politics of reform may prove quite different on this occasion. The coalition government is committed to restructuring the welfare state and public services and to rolling back the state. The NHS as a popular monopoly public service runs counter to its neoliberal ideology. While (for now) remaining committed to a publicly funded system of health care that is largely free at point of use, the government wishes to encourage much greater diversity in the provision of care, including a much larger role for the for-profit private sector. Despite significant opposition to its proposals, few concessions have been forthcoming, and the legislation that passed onto the statute book in March 2012 remained essentially unchanged. Notwithstanding the lack of convincing evidence, the government is wedded to encouraging greater competition and choice. Thosewho believe the changes will amount to far less than its architects hope for are being too complacent and overlooking the strength of the government's ideological convictions. These threaten to dismantle the NHS and replace it with a more costly, fragmented, and less effective system of care that is driven by profit in place of the public interest.\n\nArthur Simons (1877-1942) and Tonic Neck Reflexes With Hemiplegic \"Mitbewegungen\" (Associated Reactions): Cinematography From 1916-1919.\n\nPubMed\n\nHoldorff, Bernd\n\n2016-01-01\n\nTonic neck reflexes were investigated by Rudolf Magnus and Adriaan de Kleijn in animals and men in 1912 and eventually by Arthur Simons, a neurologist in Berlin and coworker of Hermann Oppenheim. Simons studied these reflexes in hemiplegic patients, who were mainly victims of World War I. This work became his most important contribution and remained unsurpassed for many years. The film (Filmarchiv, Bundesarchiv [Film Archive, National Archive] Berlin) with Simons as an examiner shows 11 war casualties with brain lesions that occurred between 1916 and 1919. The injuries reveal asymmetric neck reflexes with \"Mitbewegungen,\" that is, flexion or extension on the hemiplegic side. Mitbewegungen is identical with Francis Walshe's \"associated reactions\" caused by neck rotation and/or by cocontraction of the nonaffected extremities, for example, by closing of the fist (Walshe).

Both were Viennese-born and trained intellectuals who received doctorates in the human sciences from the University of Vienna in 1937. Both were deeply identified with lay analysis, emphasizing that for psychoanalysis to perpetuate itself it needed to promote serious and rigorous forms of research. Because Bettelheim was the better known of the two, this introduction focuses on Ekstein's family history, with special emphasis on his experience of loss and trauma and his capacity to recover from personal and educational obstacles. It argues that Ekstein was a representative product of Austro-Marxism in the period between the wars, embracing the ethical brand of democratic socialism and group solidarity that was integral to the theory and practice of Austrian Social Democracy. It discusses Ekstein's training with Moritz Schlick in philosophy and his immersion in the Vienna Circle of logical positivism. From Schlick, Ekstein evolved into a philosophical thinker who learned how to think his own thoughts. Ekstein joined the circle of psychoanalytic pedagogues who clustered around the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society, under the tutelage of Willi Hoffer, August Aichhorn and, above all, Anna Freud. The clinical component of psychoanalysis emanated from his commitment to understanding the inner world of the child. Bettelheim and Ekstein first became aware of each other from reading the analytic literature and finally met in America in the 1950s. They shared a professional interest in conducting research and doing clinical work on severely disturbed children and adolescents, including those with psychotic, borderline and autistic diagnoses. They debated the value of milieu therapy versus psychoanalytically oriented psychotherapy on such children. As their relationship evolved, the two collaborated and began a fascinating\n\nGeneral criteria for the validity of the Buckingham-Darcy Flow Law\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSposito, G.\n\nA detailed, first-principles study is undertaken on the exact equation of linear momentum balance for water in an unsaturated soil. An approximate momentum balance equation (Raats and Klute) demonstrates that the flow of water through a rigid, homogeneous, isotropic, unsaturated soil will obey the Buckingham-Darcy Law within 10/sup -12/ to 10/sup -5/ sec after a gradient in the total potential of soil water has been applied. The Raats-Klute equation will be accurate if (1) the water mass density and mass flux density vector constitute a complete set of strongly coupled, macroscopic dynamical variables, and (2) the time scale over whichmoreÂ Â» these 2 variables change significantly is much longer than that over which any other dynamic quantities vary. If these 2 conditions are met, then, according to statistical mechanics, the flow of water through unsaturated soil will be described accurately over all macroscopic intervals by the Buckingham-Darcy law.Â«Â less\n\n[Story of three SS dentists during World War II: Pr Hugo Blaschke, Dr Hermann Pook and Dr Willy Frank].\n\nPubMed\n\nRiaud, Xavier\n\n2006-12-01\n\nThis story of three SS dentists shows very clearly that the medical code of ethics, under a totalitarian regime, ends where ideology begins. Professor Hugo Blaschke provided dental care to the most eminent Nazi leaders, but he also was the senior SS dentist. He was in charge of dental care in the Waffen-SS, and therefore, he had responsibility for the stocks of dental gold collected from the mouths of those who died in the concentration camps, in order to make dentures for his soldiers. Dr Hermann Pook was the dentist in charge of all the other dentists practising in the concentration camps. He was responsible for gathering statistics on the dental care provided for prisoners in the camps. His instructions were very clear: \"No conservation or restorative treatment. Only extractions, and with no anaesthesia!\" He was also in charge of gathering the gold that was collected in the camps, for the financial department of the SS. Dr Willy Frank, an Auschwitz dentist, took part in the selection of some of the convoys for the gas chambers. His participation in the collection of gold from the mouths of the dead was also established. These three men were sentenced to prison for War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity.\n\nIN MEMORIAM: Hermann Anton Haus, 1925 2003\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\n2004-08-01\n\nPhotograph Hermann Anton Haus, an Institute Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), was to have been a Keynote Speaker at the Fluctuations and Noise in Photonics and Quantum Optics Conference, from which the papers in this special issue derive. Sadly, on May 21, 2003 - less than two weeks before the conference - Professor Haus succumbed to a heart attack after arriving home in Lexington, Massachusetts, from his regular, 15-mile commute by bicycle from MIT. He was 77. Throughout his lengthy and illustrious career, Professor Haus had repeatedly and very successfully addressed problems of fluctuations and noise, with special focus on the fundamental issues that arise in quantum optics. To honour Professor Haus' legacy to our technical community, this special issue of Journal of Optics B: Quantum and Semiclassical Optics is dedicated to his memory. Professor Haus was born in Ljubljana, Slovenia, in the former Yugoslavia, on 8 August 1925. After attending the Technische Hochschule, Graz, and the Technische Hochschule, Wien, in Austria, he received his Bachelor of Science degree from Union College in Schenectady, New York in 1949. In 1951, he graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering, and came to MIT, where he earned his Doctorate of Science and joined the faculty in 1954. He was promoted to Associate Professor in 1958, to Professor in 1962, and to Elihu Thomson Professor in 1973. In 1986, he was conferred the honour of Institute Professor. Professor Haus had a lifelong fascination with noise. While still an undergraduate at Union College, he became aware of Norbert Wiener's theories of statistical phenomena - the new mathematics needed to understand and quantify the random fluctuations we refer to as noise. So it was that noise theory formed the core of Professor Haus' research during the 1950s: noise in electron beams, noise in microwave amplifiers, and noise in amplifier cascades.

The topics discussed in this issue extend from fundamental physics to applications of noise and fluctuational methods from quantum to classical systems, and include: bullet Quantum measurement bullet Quantum squeezing bullet Solitons and fibres bullet Gravitational wave inferometers bullet Fluorescence phenomena bullet Cavity QED bullet Photon statistics bullet Noise in lasers and laser systems bullet Quantum computing and information bullet Quantum lithography bullet Teleportation. This Special Issue is published in connection with the SPIE International Symposium on Fluctuations and Noise, held in Santa Fe, New Mexico, on 1-4 June 2003. The symposium contained six parallel conferences, and the papers in this Special Issue are connected to the conference entitled `Fluctuations and Noise in Photonics and Quantum Optics'. This was the first in a series of symposia organized with the support of the SPIE that have greatly contributed to progress in this area. The co-founders of the symposium series were Laszlo B Kish (Texas A&M University) and Derek Abbott (The University of Adelaide). The Chairs of the `Fluctuations and Noise in Photonics and Quantum Optics' conference were Derek Abbott, Jeffrey H Shapiro and Yoshihisa Yamamoto. The practical aspects of the organization were ably handled by Kristi Kelso and Marilyn Gorsuch of the SPIE, USA. Sadly, less than two weeks before the conference, Hermann A Haus passed away. Hermann Haus was a founding father of the field of noise in optics and quantum optics. He submitted three papers to the conference and was very excited to attend; as can be seen in the collection of papers, he was certainly present in spirit. In honour of his creativity and pioneering work in this field, we have\n\nRoutes towards an abstract thermodynamics in the late nineteenth century\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBordoni, Stefano\n\n2013-12-01\n\nTwo different traditions of research emerged from Rudolf Clausius's version of thermodynamics. While James Clerk Maxwell and Ludwig Boltzmann pursued the integration of thermodynamics with the kinetic theory of gases, others relied on a macroscopic and more abstract approach that set aside specific mechanical models. This second approach blossomed in about two decades in different countries of Europe and in the United States. FranÃ§ois Massieu, Josiah Willard Gibbs, Hermann Helmholtz, and then Pierre Duhem explored the connections between the contents of thermodynamics and the formal structures of analytical mechanics. Others like the young Max Planck and Arthur von Oettingen pursued a sort of formal symmetry between thermal and mechanical variables. In the British Isles, Joseph John Thomson developed a dynamical approach to physics and chemistry, making use of the tools of abstract mechanics without excluding microscopic motions. Some developments were logically interconnected, as it was for Massieu's, Gibbs's, Helmholtz's, and Duhem's, even though they occurred in a largely independent manner. Duhem put forward the most original and most systematic reinterpretation of thermodynamics, which involved a bold upgrading of analytical mechanics and a bold mathematical unification of physics and chemistry. A strong commitment to unification was one of the hallmarks of all these theoretical researches.\n\n[Without sense and understanding? Rudolf Virchow's strategy of collecting by the example of his pathological museum].\n\nPubMed\n\nSchnalke, Thomas\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe Berlin pathologist Rudolf Virchow (1821-1902) has been called a \"m anic\" collector in the most recent studies on the history of science and culture because of his collection of over 23,000 pathoanatomical wet and dry specimens. A closer look at Virchow's collecting efforts, however, reveal that there was system behind the relative abundance of objects. This contribution will attempt to reconstruct Virchow's collection concept as well as his ideas about a meaningful arrangement of the specimens in the museum he founded in 1899. The study follows a reference of Virchow's to the corresponding specimen collections in the English hospital schools, which Virchow had always seen as exemplary. In this connection, the strategies and concepts of the British pathologist Thomas Hodgkin (1798-1866) will be investigated more closely as they relate to the specimen collection he administered at Guy's Hospital in London. There, abnormally changed organ specimens were presented along the two axes of anatomy and nosology. Virchow encountered this practice under the CharitÃ© prosector, Robert Froriep (1804-1861), where he experienced his socialization as collector and presenter in pathology between 1844 and 1847. In his second Berlin phase between 1856 and 1902, he expanded his institute at the CharitÃ© to a worldwide renowned center for pathology. During this time, Virchow added a third dimension to his collection strategy under the heading \"progression\", in order to document whole series in the developmental process of all diseases in all primarily and secondarily affected organs. After the opening of his Pathological Museum on the grounds of the CharitY, he strove until his death to arrange his specimens in the form of a three-dimensional textbook. Various structural conditions, a dearth of exhibition cases, as well as his decreasing vitality limited the scope of Virchow's achievements. The most essential reason why Virchow realized only a small portion of his exhibition\n\nThe Unknown Generals - German Corps Commanders in World War 2.\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1988-06-03\n\nRudolf Schnundt: 1.10.42-29.10.44.

M. CelÃ¢l; Bernoulli, Daniel\n\n2011-07-01\n\nRudolf TrÃ¼mpy (1921-2009) was one of the great Alpine geologists of the twentieth century and an influential figure in the international geological community. He played a dominant role in the change of opinion concerning the Alpine evolution by showing that normal faulting dominated the early development of the Alpine realm from the Triassic to the early Cretaceous. This provided a convenient model for later plate-tectonic interpretations of collisional mountain belts. His further recognition of strike-slip faulting during all stages of the Alpine evolution presaged the realisation that the Alps were not built by a simple open-and-shut mechanism. TrÃ¼mpy was educated during an intellectual lull, a time when simplistic models of the earth behaviour inherited from the middle of the nineteenth century became prevalent under the influence of a close-minded, positivist approach to geological problems. This period, which we term the Dark Intermezzo, lasted from about 1925 to 1965. The grand syntheses of Suess and Argand which preceded this period were viewed from this narrow angle and consequently misunderstood. It was thought that earth history was punctuated by global orogenic events of short duration taking place within and among continents and oceans whose relative positions had remained fixed since the origin of the planet. These views, summarised under the term `fixism', were developed when the ocean floors were almost totally unknown. When data began coming in from the post World War II oceanographic surveys, the world geological community was slow to receive and digest them. TrÃ¼mpy followed these developments closely, realising that his work was important in placing the geology of the mountain belts within the emerging, new theoretical framework. He adopted the position of a critic and emphasised where detailed knowledge of the Alps, unquestionably the best known mountain belt in the world, supported and where it contradicted the new ideas. His voice was\n\nForaging recruitment by the Giant Tropical Ant Paraponera clavata (Hymenoptera, Formicidae)\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nBarrett, Bruce A.; Jorgenson, Clive D.; Looman, Sandra J.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nIncreased foraging of an exceptionally abundant, but ephemeral, food source by ants can result from foraging excitement that does not include pheromone trails, tandem running, or from recruitment of other workers along pheromone trails (Carrol and Janzen, 1973). They also provided rationale for two types of short-lived pheromone trails resulting in mass or group recruitment. These both seem to fall into the Type II foraging strategy described by Oster and Wilson (1978). Neither of these discussions conveniently allow for pheromone recruitment by relatively small colonies of a primitive monomorphic species such as Paraponera clavata. Our observations suggest that recruitment to an abundant ephemeral food source does occur naturally and can be induced artificially in colonies of P. clavata.Paraponera clavata is considered primitive (Wilson, 1958), particularly in foraging habits (Young and Hermann, 1980; Young, 1977). Hermann (1973, 1975) reported the P. clavata, unlike more advanced species, forages independently; following shot periods of apparent group activity outside of the colony (Young and Hermann, 1980). It reportedly does not return to a food source when only part has been harvested. After returning to its colony with booty, a single worker resumes foraging independently, with no observable tendency to return to partially harvested booty or without recruiting additional workers to collect the remaining food (Hermann, 1973; Young and Hermann, 1980). Reports of independent foraging, lack of forager recruitment, and apparent lack of food source fidelity resulted in the assumption that P. clavata probably lacks an effective pheromone trail communication system (Young and Hermann, 1980).\n\nCan Personality-Type Instruments Profile Majors in Management Programs?\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nRowe, Fred A.; And Others\n\n1992-01-01\n\nResults of completion of 4 instruments (Myers-Briggs Type Inventory, Strong Interest Inventory, Hermann Brain Dominance Inventory, and Learning Styles Inventory) by 75 accounting, business administration, and public administration graduate students suggest that the Hermann (and to some extent the Strong) inventory has potential value forâ¦\n\nTerminal Blackout: Critical Electric Infrastructure Vulnerabilities and Civil-Military Resiliency\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2013-10-01\n\nWilliam R.

C.\n\n2016-04-01\n\nBy choosing to major in soil physics at Wageningen now exactly 60 years ago, I could combine my interest in exact sciences with my experience of growing up on a farm. I never regretted that choice. In the first twenty years, I profited much from close contacts with members of the immediate post-WW II generation of soil physicists (especially Jerry Bolt, Arnold Klute, Ed Miller, Champ Tanner, Wilford Gardner, John Philip, and Jan van Schilfgaarde), chemical engineers (especially at UW Madison the trio Bob Bird, Warren Stewart and Ed Lightfoot) and experts in continuum mechanics (especially at Johns Hopkins Clifford Truesdell and Jerald Ericksen). As graduate student at Illinois with Klute, to describe flow and transport theories in soil science I initially explored as possible framework thermodynamics of irreversible processes (TIP), but soon switched to the continuum theory of mixtures (CTM), initiated by Truesdell in 1957. In CTM, the balance of forces gave a rational basis for flux equations. CTM allowed me to deal with swelling/shrinkage, role of inertia, boundary conditions, and structured soils. Later, I did use TIP to deal with certain aspects of transfer of water and heat in soils and selective uptake of water and nutrients by plant roots. Recently, a variety of theories for upscaling from the pore scale to the Darcy scale have clarified the potential, limits and common ground of CTM and TIP. A great advantage of CTM is that it provides geometric tools suited for kinematic aspects of flow, transport, and growth/decay processes. In particular, the concept of material coordinates of the solid phase that I used in my PhD thesis to cope with large deformation due to swelling/shrinkage of soils, later also turned to be useful to deal with simultaneous shrinkage and decay in peat soils and compost heaps, and the growth of plant tissues. Also, by focusing on the material coordinates for the water, it became possible to describe transport of solutes in unsaturated\n\nPhysiological optics and physical geometry.\n\nPubMed\n\nHyder, D J\n\n2001-09-01\n\nHermann von Helmholtz's distinction between \"pure intuitive\" and \"physical\" geometry must be counted as the most influential of his many contributions to the philosophy of science. In a series of papers from the 1860s and 70s, Helmholtz argued against Kant's claim that our knowledge of Euclidean geometry was an a priori condition for empirical knowledge. He claimed that geometrical propositions could be meaningful only if they were taken to concern the behaviors of physical bodies used in measurement, from which it followed that it was posterior to our acquaintance with this behavior. This paper argues that Helmholtz's understanding of geometry was fundamentally shaped by his work in sense-physiology, above all on the continuum of colors. For in the course of that research, Helmholtz was forced to realize that the color-space had no inherent metrical structure. The latter was a product of axiomatic definitions of color-addition and the empirical results of such additions. Helmholtz's development of these views is explained with detailed reference to the competing work of the mathematician Hermann Grassmann and that of the young James Clerk Maxwell. It is this separation between 1) essential properties of a continuum, 2) supplementary axioms concerning distance-measurement, and 3) the behaviors of the physical apparatus used to realize the axioms, which is definitive of Helmholtz's arguments concerning geometry.\n\nModeling Evacuation of a Hospital without Electric Power.\n\nPubMed\n\nVugrin, Eric D; Verzi, Stephen J; Finley, Patrick D; Turnquist, Mark A; Griffin, Anne R; Ricci, Karen A; Wyte-Lake, Tamar\n\n2015-06-01\n\nHospital evacuations that occur during, or as a result of, infrastructure outages are complicated and demanding. Loss of infrastructure services can initiate a chain of events with corresponding management challenges. This report describes a modeling case study of the 2001 evacuation of the Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston, Texas (USA). The study uses a model designed to track such cascading events following loss of infrastructure services and to identify the staff, resources, and operational adaptations required to sustain patient care and/or conduct an evacuation. The model is based on the assumption that a hospital's primary mission is to provide necessary medical care to all of its patients, even when critical infrastructure services to the hospital and surrounding areas are disrupted. Model logic evaluates the hospital's ability to provide an adequate level of care for all of its patients throughout a period of disruption. If hospital resources are insufficient to provide such care, the model recommends an evacuation. Model features also provide information to support evacuation and resource allocation decisions for optimizing care over the entire population of patients. This report documents the application of the model to a scenario designed to resemble the 2001 evacuation of the Memorial Hermann Hospital, demonstrating the model's ability to recreate the timeline of an actual evacuation. The model is also applied to scenarios demonstrating how its output can inform evacuation planning activities and timing.\n\nGenome Wide Gene by Environment Interaction Analysis Identifies Common SNPs at 17q21.2 that Are Associated with Increased Body Mass Index Only among Asthmatics\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2015-12-16\n\npolymorphisms (SNPs), a candidate gene association study was conducted to identify shared genetic variants between childhood asthma and obesity , but no SNP was...10):969â 76. doi: 10.1093/aje/kwh303 PMID: 15522853. 33. von Kries R, Hermann M, Grunert VP, von Mutius E.
