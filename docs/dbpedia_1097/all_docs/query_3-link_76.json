        "text": "On October 7, Hamas committed the worst massacre of Jews in one day since the Holocaust. More than just a massacre, Hamas brutally tortured their victims, including raping Israeli women, young and old.\n\nYet, so many who have been vocal feminists, and strong voices for the #metoo movement have remained silent. And that silence is deafening.\n\nThe silence comes despite eyewitness accounts of the horrors of that day, physical evidence documented from the bodies of injured and dead women, and Hamas itself using cameras and phones to record and share the atrocities they committed, as they celebrated their crimes against humanity.\n\nThe silence comes from the otherwise vocal cohort of feminists, with the exception of a few who push horrific and blatant conspiracy theories questioning “the unverified accusation that Palestinians were guilty of sexual violence.”\n\nSilence is complicity.\n\nAs women, no matter our religion and background we are coming together to implore you to use your voices.\n\nWhy is it “believe all women”, with the asterisk being Israeli women?\n\nWhy is the me too movement not using their voices to stand with the victims of Hamas’ sexual violence?\n\nIf you are an advocate for victims of sexual violence, then that shouldn’t be dependent on whether you agree with the government of the country from which the victim comes.\n\nToday, just days since the UN Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women and Girls, during the 16 Days of Activism against Gender- based Violence, we the undersigned call on you to join with us, in condemning the use of rape as an act of terrorism by Hamas."
