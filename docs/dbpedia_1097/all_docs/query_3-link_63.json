We show how Kepler's third law can be reproduced using planetary data from NASA. We will also be using Newton's Gravitational law to explain why Kepler's three laws exist as they do.\n\nNewton's Path to Universal Gravitation: The Role of the Pendulum\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBoulos, Pierre J.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nMuch attention has been given to Newton's argument for Universal Gravitation in Book III of the \"Principia\".

A modified expression of Newton's law is known in the literature, but lacks a clear connection with existing gravitational theory. Newton's law in the presence of a homogeneous material medium is herein derived on the basis of classical, Newtonian gravitational theory and by a general relativistic use of Archimedes' principle. It is envisioned that the techniques presented herein will be most useful to graduate students and those undergraduate students having prior experience with vector analysis and potential theory.\n\nTurning around Newton's Second Law\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nGoff, John Eric\n\n2004-01-01\n\nConceptual and quantitative difficulties surrounding Newton's second law often arise among introductory physics students. Simply turning around how one expresses Newton's second law may assist students in their understanding of a deceptively simple-looking equation.\n\n3, 2, 1 â¦ Discovering Newton's Laws\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLutz, Joe; Sylvester, Kevin; Oliver, Keith; Herrington, Deborah\n\n2017-03-01\n\n\"For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.\" \"Except when a bug hits your car window, the car must exert more force on the bug because Newton's laws only apply in the physics classroom, right?\" Students in our classrooms were able to pick out definitions as well as examples of Newton's three laws; they could recite the laws and even solve for force, mass, and acceleration. However, when given \"real world\" questions, they would quickly revert to naive explanations. This frustration led to an examination of our approach to teaching Newton's laws. Like many, we taught Newton's laws in their numerical orderâfirst, second, and then third. Students read about the laws, copied definitions, and became proficient with vocabulary before they applied the laws in a lab setting. This paper discusses how we transformed our teaching of Newton's laws by flipping the order (3, 2, 1) and putting the activity before concept, as well as how these changes affected student outcomes.\n\nGeneral Relativity Exactly Described by Use of Newton's Laws within a Curved Geometry\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSavickas, David\n\n2014-03-01\n\nThe connection between general relativity and Newtonian mechanics is shown to be much closer than generally recognized. When Newton's second law is written in a curved geometry by using the physical components of a vector as defined in tensor calculus, and by replacing distance within the momentum's velocity by the vector metric ds in a curved geometry, the second law can then be easily shown to be exactly identical to the geodesic equation of motion occurring in general relativity. By using a time whose vector direction is constant, as similarly occurs in Newtonian mechanics, this equation can be separated into two equations one of which is a curved three-dimensional equation of motion and the other is an equation for energy. For the gravitational field of an isolated particle, they yield the Schwarzschild equations. They can be used to describe gravitation for any array of masses for which the Newtonian gravitational potential is known, and is applied here to describe motion in the gravitational field of a thin mass-rod.\n\nInfinity and Newton's Three Laws of Motion\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLee, Chunghyoung\n\n2011-12-01\n\nIt is shown that the following three common understandings of Newton's laws of motion do not hold for systems of infinitely many components. First, Newton's third law, or the law of action and reaction, is universally believed to imply that the total sum of internal forces in a system is always zero. Several examples are presented to show that this belief fails to hold for infinite systems. Second, two of these examples are of an infinitely divisible continuous body with finite mass and volume such that the sum of all the internal forces in the body is not zero and the body accelerates due to this non-null net internal force. So the two examples also demonstrate the breakdown of the common understanding that according to Newton's laws a body under no external force does not accelerate. Finally, these examples also make it clear that the expression `impressed force' in Newton's formulations of his first and second laws should be understood not as `external force' but as `exerted force' which is the sum of all the internal and external forces acting on a given body, if the body is infinitely divisible.\n\nOn Time-II: Newton's Time.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nRaju, C.

Demonstration of Newton's Third Law\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFeldman, Gerald\n\n2011-02-01\n\nAn operational understanding of Newton's third law is often elusive for students. Typical examples of this concept are given for contact forces that are closer to the students' everyday experience. While this is a good thing in general, the reaction force can sometimes be taken for granted, and the students can miss the opportunity to really think about what is going on. In the case of magnetic forces, however, the notion of action at a distance actually requires a careful inspection of the forces involved and thereby promotes a more detailed analysis of the situation. In this paper, a simple demonstration of Newton's third law is presented in the context of a magnet falling through a hollow conducting tube. The results are unambiguous and lead the students to an irrefutable verification of Newton's third law.\n\nCan Newton's Third Law Be \"Derived\" from the Second?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGangopadhyaya, Asim; Harrington, James\n\n2017-04-01\n\nNewton's laws have engendered much discussion over several centuries. Today, the internet is awash with a plethora of information on this topic. We find many references to Newton's laws, often discussions of various types of misunderstandings and ways to explain them. Here we present an intriguing example that shows an assumption hidden in Newton's third law that is often overlooked. As is well known, the first law defines an inertial frame of reference and the second law determines the acceleration of a particle in such a frame due to an external force. The third law describes forces exerted on each other in a two-particle system, and allows us to extend the second law to a system of particles. Students are often taught that the three laws are independent. Here we present an example that challenges this assumption. At first glance, it seems to show that, at least for a special case, the third law follows from the second law. However, a careful examination of the assumptions demonstrates that is not quite the case. Ultimately, the example does illustrate the significance of the concept of mass in linking Newton's dynamical principles.\n\nCalibration of gravitational radiation antenna by dynamic Newton field\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSuzuki, T.; Tsubono, K.; Kuroda, K.; Hirakawa, H.\n\n1981-07-01\n\nA method is presented of calibrating antennas for gravitational radiation. The method, which used the dynamic Newton field of a rotating body, is suitable in experiments for frequencies up to several hundred hertz. What is more, the method requires no hardware inside the vacuum chamber of the antenna and is particularly convenient for calibration of low-temperature antenna systems.\n\nThe Newton constant and gravitational waves in some vector field adjusting mechanisms\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSantillÃ¡n, Osvaldo P.; Scornavacche, Marina, E-mail: firenzecita@hotmail.com, E-mail: marina.scorna@hotmail.com\n\nAt the present, there exist some Lorentz breaking scenarios which explain the smallness of the cosmological constant at the present era [1]â[2]. An important aspect to analyze is the propagation of gravitational waves and the screening or enhancement of the Newton constant G {sub N} in these models. The problem is that the Lorentz symmetry breaking terms may induce an unacceptable value of the Newton constant G {sub N} or introduce longitudinal modes in the gravitational wave propagation. Furthermore this breaking may spoil the standard dispersion relation Ï= ck . In [3] the authors have presented a model suggesting thatmoreÂ Â» the behavior of the gravitational constant is correct for asymptotic times. In the present work, an explicit checking is made and we finally agree with these claims. Furthermore, it is suggested that the gravitational waves are also well behaved for large times. In the process, some new models with the same behavior are obtained, thus enlarging the list of possible adjustment mechanisms.Â«Â less\n\nNewton's Law of Cooling Revisited\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nVollmer, M.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe cooling of objects is often described by a law, attributed to Newton, which states that the temperature difference of a cooling body with respect to the surroundings decreases exponentially with time.

Ecosystems are fundamentally different from machines, where individual components contain complex organisms instead of identical nonliving entities. Because of heterogeneity, diversity, self-organization, and openness, imbalances abound in nature. These are reflected in entropy increase over time (S > 0) and gradient persistence over space (F > 0). In this paper, three modified Newton's laws of change for ecosystems are suggested, and examples of imbalances from landscape-soil-water-ecosystem-climate will be illustrated. â Newton's 1st law of motion: âF=0 â dv/dt=0. i.e., if net force acting on an object is zero, then the object's velocity remains unchanged. Modified Newton's 1st law of change (imbalance #1): âF>0 â dv/dtâ¥0. i.e., unavoidable forcing exists in nature (âF>0), thus change always happens; however, with inertia/resistance in some systems or minimum threshold needed to change, dv/dtâ¥0. â Newton's 2nd law of motion: âF=ma. i.e., acceleration is inversely proportional to body mass. Modified Newton's 2nd law of change (imbalance #2): âFâ ma. i.e., either 1) it is hard to make change because of resilience, self-adjustment, nonlinearity of interactions-feedbacks in living systems (âFâ¥ma), or 2) there is possible threshold behavior or sudden collapse of a system (âFNewton's 3rd law of motion: âF(a,b)=-âF(b,a). i.e., for every force acting on a body, there is an equal (in magnitude) but opposite (in direction) reacting force. Modified Newton's 3rd law of change (imbalance #3): âF(a,b)â -âF(b,a). i.e., to every action, there is an opposite but not necessarily equal reaction (because of energy dissipation and/or self-organization, among other\n\nWeber's gravitational force as static weak field approximation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTiandho, Yuant\n\n2016-02-01\n\nWeber's gravitational force (WGF) is one of gravitational model that can accommodate a non-static system because it depends not only on the distance but also on the velocity and the acceleration. Unlike Newton's law of gravitation, WGF can predict the anomalous of Mercury and gravitational bending of light near massive object very well. Then, some researchers use WGF as an alternative model of gravitation and propose a new mechanics theory namely the relational mechanics theory. However, currently we have known that the theory of general relativity which proposed by Einstein can explain gravity with very accurate. Through the static weak field approximation for the non-relativistic object, we also have known that the theory of general relativity will reduce to Newton's law of gravity. In this work, we expand the static weak field approximation that compatible with relativistic object and we obtain a force equation which correspond to WGF. Therefore, WGF is more precise than Newton's gravitational law. The static-weak gravitational field that we used is a solution of the Einstein's equation in the vacuum that satisfy the linear field approximation. The expression of WGF with Î¾ = 1 and satisfy the requirement of energy conservation are obtained after resolving the geodesic equation. By this result, we can conclude that WGF can be derived from the general relativity.\n\nDemonstrating Newton's Third Law: Changing Aristotelian Viewpoints.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nRoach, Linda E.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nSuggests techniques to help eliminate students' misconceptions involving Newton's Third Law. Approaches suggested include teaching physics from a historical perspective, using computer programs with simulations, rewording the law, drawing free-body diagrams, and using demonstrations and examples. (PR)\n\nTeaching Newton's Third Law of Motion in the Presence of Student Preconception\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nPoon, C. H.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe concept of interaction that underlies Newton's Laws of Motion is compared with the students' commonsense ideas of force and motion. An approach to teaching Newton's Third Law of Motion is suggested that focuses on refining the student's intuitive thinking on the nature of interaction.\n\nNewton's Laws, Euler's Laws and the Speed of Light\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nWhitaker, Stephen\n\n2009-01-01\n\nChemical engineering students begin their studies of mechanics in a department of physics where they are introduced to the mechanics of Newton. The approach presented by physicists differs in both perspective and substance from that encountered in chemical engineering courses where Euler's laws provide the foundation for studies of fluid and solidâ¦\n\nOrigins of Newton's First Law\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHecht, Eugene\n\n2015-02-01\n\nAnyone who has taught introductory physics should know that roughly a third of the students initially believe that any object at rest will remain at rest, whereas any moving body not propelled by applied forces will promptly come to rest. Likewise, about half of those uninitiated students believe that any object moving at a constant speed must be continually pushed if it is to maintain its motion.1 That's essentially Aristotle's law of motion and it is so \"obviously\" borne out by experience that it was accepted by scholars for 2000 years, right through the Copernican Revolution. But, of course, it's fundamentally wrong. This paper tells the story of how the correct understanding, the law of inertia, evolved and how Newton came to make it his first law.\n\nGeneral relativity exactly described in terms of Newton's laws within curved geometries\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSavickas, D.\n\n2014-07-01\n\nMany years ago Milne and McCrea showed in their well-known paper that the Hubble expansion occurring in general relativity could be exactly described by the use of Newtonian mechanics. It will be shown that a similar method can be extended to, and used within, curved geometries when Newton's second law is expressed within a four-dimensional curved spacetime. The second law will be shown to yield an equation that is exactly identical to the geodesic equation of motion of general relativity. This in itself yields no new information concerning relativity since the equation is mathematically identical to the relativistic equation. However, when the time in the second law is defined to have a constant direction as effectively occurs in Newtonian mechanics, and no longer acts as a fourth dimension as exists in relativity theory, it separates into a vector equation in a curved three-dimensional space and an additional second scalar equation that describes conservation of energy. It is shown that the curved Newtonian equations of motion define the metric coefficients which occur in the Schwarzschild solution and that they also define its equations of motion. Also, because the curved Newtonian equations developed here use masses as gravitational sources, as occurs in Newtonian mechanics, they make it possible to derive the solution for other kinds of mass distributions and are used here to find the metric equation for a thin mass-rod and the equation of motion for a mass particle orbiting it in its relativistic gravitational field.\n\nMilgrom's revision of cosmic dynamics: Amending Newton's laws or Keplers?\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nFelten, J. E.\n\n1983-01-01\n\nMilgrom's recent revision of Newtonian dynamics was introduced to eliminate the inference that large quantities of invisible mass exist in galaxies. Simple examples show that a Milgrom acceleration, in the form presented so far, imply other far-reaching changes in dynamics. The momentum of an isolated system is not conserved, and the usual theorem for center-of-mass motion of any system does not hold. Naive applications require extreme caution. The model fails to provide a complete description of particle dynamics and should be thought of as a revision of Kepler's laws rather than Newton's. The Milgrom acceleration also implies fundamental changes in cosmology. A quasi-Newtonian calculation adapted from Newtonian cosmology suggests that a Milgrom universe will recollapse even if the classical closure parameter theta is less than 1. The solution, however, fails to satisfy the cosmological principle. Reasons for the breakdown of this calculation are examined. A theory of gravitation needed before the behavior of a Milgrom universe can be predicted.\n\nMilgrom's revision of Newton's laws - Dynamical and cosmological consequences\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nFelten, J.

P.\n\n2006-09-01\n\nDeviations from Newton's inverse-squared law at the micron length scale are smoking-gun signals for models containing supersymmetric large extra dimensions (SLEDs), which have been proposed as approaches for resolving the cosmological constant problem. Just like their non-supersymmetric counterparts, SLED models predict gravity to deviate from the inverse-square law because of the advent of new dimensions at sub-millimeter scales. However SLED models differ from their non-supersymmetric counterparts in three important ways: (i) the size of the extra dimensions is fixed by the observed value of the dark energy density, making it impossible to shorten the range over which new deviations from Newton's law must be seen; (ii) supersymmetry predicts there to be more fields in the extra dimensions than just gravity, implying different types of couplings to matter and the possibility of repulsive as well as attractive interactions; and (iii) the same mechanism which is purported to keep the cosmological constant naturally small also keeps the extra-dimensional moduli effectively massless, leading to deviations from general relativity in the far infrared of the scalar-tensor form. We here explore the deviations from Newton's law which are predicted over micron distances, and show the ways in which they differ and resemble those in the non-supersymmetric case.\n\nPlausibility Arguments and Universal Gravitation\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nCunha, Ricardo F.

Physics has a heavy emphasis on trying to alter students' misconceptions about how things work in the real word. In chemistry and microbiology this is not an issue because the topics of discussion in those classes are a new experience for the students. In the case of physics the students have everyday experience with the different concepts discussed. This causes the students to build incorrect mental models explaining how different things work. In order to correct these mental models physics teachers must first get the students to vocalize these misconceptions. Then the teacher must confront the students with an example that exposes the false nature of their model. Finally, the teacher must help the student resolve these discrepancies and form the correct model.

The results reported here indicate that this method of eliciting the misconception, confronting the misconception, and resolving the misconception is successful with Newton's third law, but only marginally successful for first and second laws.\n\nMaking More Plausible What is Hard To Believe: Historical Justifications and Illustrations of Newton's Third Law.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nGauld, Colin\n\n1998-01-01\n\nReports that many students do not believe Newton's law of action and reaction and suggests ways in which its plausibility might be enhanced.

Wilhelm and Tycho must share the credit for renewing astronomy with very accurate observations of positions of stars by new instrumentation and new methods. Tycho's observations of planets during 20 years enabled Johannes Kepler to derive the laws of planetary motion.

While some students' somewhat naive, pre-existing models of Newton's third law are largely eliminated following a semester of teaching, we find that a particular inconsistent model is highly resilient to, and may even be strengthened by, instruction. If test items contain words that cue students to think of Newton's second law, then students are more likely to apply a \"net force\" approach to solving problems, even if it is inappropriate to do so. Additional instruction, reinforcing physical concepts in multiple settings and from multiple sources, appears to help students develop a more connected and consistent level of understanding. We recommend explicitly encouraging students to check their work for consistency with physical principles, along with the standard checks for dimensionality and order of magnitude, to encourage reflective and rigorous problem solving.\n\nWhen Newton's cooling law doesn't hold\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nTarnow, E.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nWhat is the fastest way to cool something If the object is macroscopic it is to lower the surrounding temperature as much as possible and let Newton's cooling law take effect.

As part of these efforts the Force Concepts Inventory (FCI) has been given to students in both the algebra-based and calculus-based introductory physics sequences. In addition, the algebra-based introductory physics sequence is taught in both a SCALE-UP and a traditional lecture format. The results of the FCI have been analyzed by individual question and also as categorized by content. The analysis indicates that students in both algebra and calculus-based courses are successful at overcoming Aristotelian misconceptions regarding Newton's Third Law (N3) in the context of a stationary system. However, students are less successful on N3 questions involving objects in constant motion or accelerating. Interference between understanding of Newton's Second and Third Laws as well as other possible explanations for lower student performance on N3 questions involving non-stationary objects will be discussed.\n\nThe gravitational analog of Faraday's induction law\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZile, Daniel; Overduin, James\n\n2015-04-01\n\nMichael Faraday, the discoverer of electromagnetic induction, was convinced that there must also be a gravitational analog of this law, and he carried out drop-tower experiments in 1849 to look for the electric current induced in a coil by changes in gravitational flux through the coil. This work, now little remembered, was in some ways the first investigation of what we would now call a unified-field theory. We revisit Faraday's experiments in the light of current knowledge and ask what might be learned if they were to be performed today. We then review the gravitational analog for Faraday's law that arises within the vector (or gravito-electromagnetic) approximation to Einstein's theory of general relativity in the weak-field, low-velocity limit. This law relates spinning masses and induced ``mass currents'' rather than spinning charges and electric currents, but is otherwise remarkably similar to its electromagnetic counterpart. The predicted effects are completely unobservable in everyday settings like those envisioned by Faraday, but are thought to be relevant in astrophysical contexts like the accretion disks around collapsed stars, thus bearing out Faraday's remarkable intuition.

M.; Tiengo, A.\n\nThe detection of the first gravitational wave (GW) transient GW150914 prompted an extensive campaign of follow-up observations at all wavelengths. Although no dedicated XMM-Newton observations have been performed, the satellite passed through the GW150914 error region during normal operations. Here we report the analysis of the data taken during these satellite slews performed two hours and two weeks after the GW event. Our data cover 1.1 and 4.8 deg{sup 2} of the final GW localization region. No X-ray counterpart to GW150914 is found down to a sensitivity of 6 Ã 10{sup â13} erg cm{sup â2} s{sup â1} in the 0.2â2moreÂ Â» keV band. Nevertheless, these observations show the great potential of XMM-Newton slew observations for searching for the electromagnetic counterparts of GW events. A series of adjacent slews performed in response to a GW trigger would take â²1.5 days to cover most of the typical GW credible region. We discuss this scenario and its prospects for detecting the X-ray counterpart of future GW detections.Â«Â less\n\nMass and Motion: Topics at the Interface of General Relativity and Newtonian Gravitation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWeatherall, James Owen\n\nThere is a long tradition, originating with Aristotle, of philosophers interested in the nature of unforced motion. How do bodies move in the absence of any external influence, and why? The modern answer to the \"how'\" half of this question is the subject of Newton's first law of motion, which states that in the absence of any external forces, a body traverses a straight line at constant velocity. Newton's first law, however, does not appear to provide an answer to the \"why\" half of the question. Indeed, many physicists and philosophers of physics, Einstein included, have held that this question cannot be answered until one moves to general relativity---and more, that general relativity is distinctive among spacetime theories precisely because it \"explains\" unforced motion, in the sense that the geodesic principle---the geometrical version of Newton's first law---can be proved as a theorem. In this dissertation, I argue that Newtonian gravitation provides an explanation of inertial motion almost identical to that of general relativity. However, the details of both cases are remarkably subtle, and considerable attention must be paid to the sense of \"explain\" being used. Four chapters of the dissertation are devoted to these considerations. The final chapter of the dissertation addresses a slightly different topic. In standard Newtonian gravitation, there are two distinct notions of mass: \"inertial mass\" and \"(passive) gravitational mass\". Yet it is an empirical fact that for any body, the values of these masses are always equal. Historically, many physicists have taken this fact to call for explanation. A natural place to look for an explanation of the coincidence of inertial and gravitational mass would be general relativity. In general relativity, however, there is no coherent notion of gravitational mass. This chapter shows how it is that gravitational mass arises as a distinct property of matter in the Newtonian limit of general relativity, and moreover, shows\n\nTeaching Newton's Laws with the iPod Touch in Conceptual Physics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKelly, Angela M.\n\n2011-04-01\n\nOne of the greatest challenges in teaching physics is helping students achieve a conceptual understanding of Newton's laws. I find that students fresh from middle school can sometimes recite the laws verbatim (\"An object in motion stays in motionâ¦\" and \"For every actionâ¦\"), but they rarely demonstrate a working knowledge of how to apply them to observable phenomena. As a firm believer in inquiry-based teaching methods, I like to develop activities where students can experiment and construct understandings based on relevant personal experiences. Consequently, I am always looking for exciting new technologies that can readily demonstrate how physics affects everyday things. In a conceptual physics class designed for ninth-graders, I created a structured activity where students applied Newton's laws to a series of free applications downloaded on iPod Touches. The laws had been introduced during the prior class session with textual descriptions and graphical representations. The course is offered as part of the Enlace Latino Collegiate Society, a weekend enrichment program for middle and high school students in the Bronx. The majority of students had limited or no prior exposure to physics concepts, and many attended high schools where physics was not offered at all.\n\nStudents' Concept of Force: The Importance of Understanding Newton's Third Law.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBrown, David E.\n\nThis paper analyzes the misconceptions high school students have about force and suggests that the misunderstanding of Newton's third law is the key to these misconceptions.

However, the time of death can be an important piece of information in some coroner's cases, especially those that involve criminal or insurance investigations. It has been known almost from the beginning of time that bodies cool after the internal mechanisms such as circulation of the blood stop. A first attempt to link this phenomenon to the determination of the time of death used a crude linear relationship. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, Newton's law of cooling using body temperature data obtained by the coroner was used to make a more accurate estimate. While based on scientific principles and resulting in a better estimate, Newton's law does not really describe the cooling of a non-homogeneous human body. This article will discuss a more accurate model of the cooling process based on the theoretical work of Marshall and Hoare and the laboratory-based statistical work of Claus Henssge. Using DERIVEÂ®6.10 and the statistical work of Henssge, the double exponential cooling formula developed by Marshall and Hoare will be explored. The end result is a tool that can be used in the field by coroner's scene investigators to determine a 95% confidence interval for the time since death and, thus, the time of death.\n\nAn insight into Newton's cooling law using fractional calculus\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMondol, Adreja; Gupta, Rivu; Das, Shantanu; Dutta, Tapati\n\n2018-02-01\n\nFor small temperature differences between a heated body and its environment, Newton's law of cooling predicts that the instantaneous rate of change of temperature of any heated body with respect to time is proportional to the difference in temperature of the body with the ambient, time being measured in integer units. Our experiments on the cooling of different liquids (water, mustard oil, and mercury) did not fit the theoretical predictions of Newton's law of cooling in this form. The solution was done using both Caputo and Riemann-Liouville type fractional derivatives to check if natural phenomena showed any preference in mathematics. In both cases, we find that cooling of liquids has an identical value of the fractional derivative of time that increases with the viscosity of the liquid. On the other hand, the cooling studies on metal alloys could be fitted exactly by integer order time derivative equations. The proportionality constant between heat flux and temperature difference was examined with respect to variations in the depth of liquid and exposed surface area. A critical combination of these two parameters signals a change in the mode of heat transfer within liquids. The equivalence between the proportionality constants for the Caputo and Riemann-Liouville type derivatives is established.\n\nHow Spherical Is a Cube (Gravitationally)?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSanny, Jeff; Smith, David\n\n2015-02-01\n\nAn important concept that is presented in the discussion of Newton's law of universal gravitation is that the gravitational effect external to a spherically symmetric mass distribution is the same as if all of the mass of the distribution were concentrated at the center.1,2 By integrating over ring elements of a spherical shell, we show that the gravitational force on a point mass outside the shell is the same as that of a particle with the same mass as the shell at its center. This derivation works for objects with spherical symmetry while depending on the fact that the gravitational force between two point masses varies inversely as the square of their separation.3 If these conditions are not met, then the problem becomes more difficult. In this paper, we remove the condition of spherical symmetry and examine the gravitational force between two uniform cubes.\n\nNewton's laws of motion in the form of a Riccati equation.\n\nPubMed\n\nNowakowski, Marek; Rosu, Haret C\n\n2002-04-01\n\nWe discuss two applications of a Riccati equation to Newton's laws of motion. The first one is the motion of a particle under the influence of a power law central potential V(r)=kr(epsilon). For zero total energy we show that the equation of motion can be cast in the Riccati form. We briefly show here an analogy to barotropic Friedmann-Robertson-Lemaitre cosmology where the expansion of the universe can be also shown to obey a Riccati equation. A second application in classical mechanics, where again the Riccati equation appears naturally, are problems involving quadratic friction. We use methods reminiscent to nonrelativistic supersymmetry to generalize and solve such problems.\n\nSnowboard Jumping, Newton's Second Law and the Force on Landing\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nO'Shea, Michael J.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nAn application of Newton's second law to a snowboarder dropping off a vertical ledge shows that the average normal force during landing (force exerted by the ground on the snowboarder) is determined by four factors.

Jane\n\n2016-03-01\n\nWhy do animals move the way they do? Bacteria, insects, birds, and fish share with us the necessity to move so as to live. Although each organism follows its own evolutionary course, it also obeys a set of common laws. At the very least, the movement of animals, like that of planets, is governed by Newton's law: All things fall. On Earth, most things fall in air or water, and their motions are thus subject to the laws of hydrodynamics. Through trial and error, animals have found ways to interact with fluid so they can float, drift, swim, sail, glide, soar, and fly. This elementary struggle to escape the fate of falling shapes the development of motors, sensors, and mind. Perhaps we can deduce parts of their neural computations by understanding what animals must do so as not to fall. Here I discuss recent developments along this line of inquiry in the case of insect flight. Asking how often a fly must sense its orientation in order to balance in air has shed new light on the role of motor neurons and steering muscles responsible for flight stability.\n\nThe Discovery of Gravitational Repulsion by Johannes Droste\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMcGruder, Charles Hosewell; VanDerMeer, B. Wieb\n\n2018-01-01\n\nIn 1687 Newton published his universal law of gravitation, which states that the gravitational force is always attractive. This law is based on our terrestrial experience with slowly moving bodies (v << c). In 1915 Einstein completed his theory of general relativity (also referred to as Einsteinâs Theory of Gravitation), which is valid not just for slowly moving bodies but also for those with relativistic velocities. In 1916 Johannes Droste submitted a PhD thesis on general relativity to his advisor, H.A. Lorentz. In it he calculated the motion of a particle in what he called a âsingle centerâ and today we call the Schwarzschild field and found that highly relativistic particles experience gravitational repulsion. Thus, his thesis written in Dutch and never before translated contains the discovery of gravitational repulsion. Because of its historical importance we translate the entire section of his thesis containing the discovery of gravitational repulsion. We also translate his thesis in the hope of clearing up a major historical misconception. Namely, that David Hilbert in 1917 discovered gravitational repulsion. In fact, Hilbert rediscovered it, apparently completely independent of Drosteâs work. Finally we note that one of the biggest mysteries of astrophysics is the question of how highly energetic particles in relativistic jets and cosmic rays are accelerated. It has been suggested that gravitational repulsion is the mechanism responsible for these phenomena. An historical understanding of gravitational repulsion is therefore pertinent.\n\nTeaching Newton's 3rd law of motion using learning by design approach\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAquino, Jiezel G.; Caliguid, Mariel P.; Buan, Amelia T.; Magsayod, Joy R.; Lahoylahoy, Myrna E.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThis paper presents the process and implementation of Learning by Design Approach in teaching Newton's 3rd Law of Motion. A lesson activity from integrative STEM education was adapted, modified and enhanced through pilot testing. After revisions, the implementation was done to one class. The respondent's prior knowledge was first assessed by a pretest. PPIT (present the scenario, plan, implement and test) was the framework followed in the implementation of Learning by Design. Worksheets were then utilized to measure their conceptual understanding and perception. A score guide was also used to evaluate the student's output. Paired t-test analysis showed that there is a significant difference in the pretest and posttest achievement scores. This implies that the performance of the students have improved during the implementation of the Learning by Design. The Analysis of variance also depicts that the low, average and high benefited in the Learning by Design approach. The results of this study suggests that Learning by Design is an effective approach in teaching Newton's 3rd Law of Motion and thus be used in a Science classroom.\n\nStudents' Understanding on Newton's Third Law in Identifying the Reaction Force in Gravity Interactions\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nZhou, Shaona; Zhang, Chunbin; Xiao, Hua\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIn the past three decades, previous researches showed that students had various misconceptions of Newton's Third Law.

Here, we first derive the existing Heisenberg equations of motion from Newton's laws and the uncertainty principle using only the equations F=\\\\frac{dP}{dt}, P=m\\\\frac{dV}{dt}, and [X, P] = i. Then, a new expression for the propagator is derived that makes a connection between time evolution in quantum mechanics and the motion of a classical particle under Newton's laws. The propagator is solved for three cases where an exact solution is possible: (1) the free particle; (2) the harmonic oscillator; and (3) a constant force, or linear potential in the standard interpretation. We then show that for a general for a general force F(X), by Taylor expanding X(t) in time, we can use this methodology to reproduce the Feynman path integral formula for the propagator. Such a picture may be useful for students as they make the transition from classical to quantum mechanics and help solidify the equivalence of the Hamiltonian, Lagrangian, and Newtonian pictures of physics in their minds.\n\nTexas Science Teacher Characteristics and Conceptual Understanding of Newton's Laws of Motion\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBusby, Karin Burk\n\nMisconceptions of Newtonian mechanics and other physical science concepts are well documented in primary and pre-service teacher populations (Burgoon, Heddle, & Duran, 2009; Allen & Coole, 2012; Kruger, Summers, & Palacio, 1990; Ginns & Watters, 1995; Trumper, 1999; Asikainen & Hirovonen, 2014). These misconceptions match the misconceptions held by students, leaving teachers ill-equipped to rectify these concepts in the classroom (Kind, 2014; Kruger et al., 1990; Cochran & Jones, 1998). Little research has been devoted to misconceptions held by in-service secondary teachers, the population responsible for teaching Newtonian mechanics. This study focuses on Texas in-service science teachers in middle school and high school science, specifically sixth grade science, seventh grade science, eighth grade science, integrated physics and chemistry, and physics teachers. This study utilizes two instruments to gauge conceptual understanding of Newton's laws of motion: the Force Concept Inventory [FCI] (Hestenes, Wells, & Swackhamer, 1992) and a custom instrument developed for the Texas Regional Collaboratives for Excellence in Science and Mathematics Teaching (Urquhart, M., e-mail, April 4, 2017). Use of each instrument had its strengths and limitations. In the initial work of this study, the FCI was given to middle and high school teacher volunteers in two urban school districts in the Dallas- Fort Worth area to assess current conceptual understanding of Newtonian mechanics. Along with the FCI, each participant was asked to complete a demographic survey. Demographic data collected included participant's sex, years of service in teaching position, current teaching position, degrees, certification type, and current certifications for science education. Correlations between variables and overall average on the FCI were determined by t-tests and ANOVA tests with a post-hoc Holm-Bonferroni correction test.

Newton's universal theory of gravity only used the observations of the motion of planets in our solar system. Hubble later used observations of fixed stars in the universe, and showed that the fixed stars were actually galaxies with very large numbers of stars. Newton's universal law of gravity could not explain these new observations without the mystery of dark matter for the additional gravity. In science, when a theory is not able to explain new observations it is necessary to modify the theory or abandon the theory. Rubin observed flat (constant velocity) rotation curves for stars in spiral galaxies. Dark matter was proposed to provide the missing gravity. The equation balancing gravitational force and centripetal force is M*G=v*v*r and for the observed constant velocity v this requires M*G to be a linear function of distance r. If the linear dependence is instead assigned to G instead of M to give a new value for Gn as G+A*r, this will explain the observations in the cosmos and also in our solar system for small r.

Their meaning is discussed in advanced undergraduate and graduate courses such as solid state physics, nuclear physics and quantum field theory. Here I discuss how these concepts may be introduced together with the discussion of Newton's second law of motion.

The orbits of spiraling solitons under a long-range interaction are given explicitly and demonstrated to follow Newton's second law of motion and the Binet equation by numerical simulations. The condition for circular orbits is obtained and the oscillating orbits are proved not to be closed. We prove the analogy between the nonlocal nonlinear optical system and gravitational system and specify the quantitative relation of the quantity between the two models.\n\nIntegrating Scientific Methods and Knowledge into the Teaching of Newton's Theory of Gravitation: An Instructional Sequence for Teachers' and Students' Nature of Science Education\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nDevelaki, Maria\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe availability of teaching units on the nature of science (NOS) can reinforce classroom instruction in the subject, taking into account the related deficiencies in textbook material and teacher training.

B.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nFor over 90 years scientists have tried to explain how tornadoes form and function. The present general consensus is that a tornado is just a function of the thunderstorm. Much research has been done to find the answer and numerous articles and papers have been written, all to no avail. This research explores the fact that a tornado cannot be just a function of a thunderstorm, as there is no opposite force within the thunderstorm to the air drawn up by the tornado, so there must be some external force involved in a tornado's formation. To have compliance with Newton's Third Law of Motion we must see an equal downforce or some other force within the thunderstorm, to that drawn up by the tornado. And if there was a downforce, that force would be virtually as damaging as the tornado itself. But we don't see this downforce or any other opposing force within the thunderstorm. Therefore, we must look for some other force that could cause a tornado's formation. And if that opposing force is not within the thunderstorm we need to be looking for some external force, outside the thunderstorm, that could cause a tornado. Also the fact that we have Waterspouts, Landspouts and Gustnadoes all without a thunderstorm, but since they all look and function just like a tornado, tells us that there must be some other force that is responsible for causing a tornado just like a Waterspout, Landspout or Gustnado. My research shows that there is one other force of energy that could cause all of these vortexes and is most likely the source of energy for a tornado's formation. That force is the High Velocity Overhead Jet Stream. My research shows a direct relationship between the High Velocity Overhead Jet Stream and Tornadogenesis as well as Waterspouts, Landspouts and Gustnadoes. Therefore, with the High Velocity Overhead Jet Stream providing the Action, at its interface with the tornado in the stratosphere, the Reaction is what we see on the ground as a tornado. With this explanation we\n\nGravitation and Special Relativity from Compton Wave Interactions at the Planck Scale: An Algorithmic Approach\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBlackwell, William C., Jr.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nIn this paper space is modeled as a lattice of Compton wave oscillators (CWOs) of near- Planck size. It is shown that gravitation and special relativity emerge from the interaction between particles Compton waves. To develop this CWO model an algorithmic approach was taken, incorporating simple rules of interaction at the Planck-scale developed using well known physical laws. This technique naturally leads to Newton s law of gravitation and a new form of doubly special relativity. The model is in apparent agreement with the holographic principle, and it predicts a cutoff energy for ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays that is consistent with observational data.\n\nStudent's preconception and anxiety when they solve multi representation concepts in Newton laws and it's application\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCari, C.; Suparmi, A.; Handhika, J.\n\n2016-11-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to describe of preconceptions and anxieties students in solving the representation concepts in newton laws and it's application. This research was conducted for junior undergraduate student's in physics department (36 Students) and physics education (31 Students). The method used in this study is a qualitative descriptive. The data was collection using test for multirepresentation concept, questionnaires for anxiety, and interviews. Based on the analysis it can be concluded that (1) the higher is anxiety, the higher is unconsistency (67,16%), (2) the higher is anxiety, the higher is consistency but wrong answer (29,85%), (3) the lower is anxiety, the higher is consistency of right answer (2,98%).

Inflation is not a recent date phenomenon, but it has existed ever since money emerged in world's first economies. With the development of economy and market, inflation developed as well. Today, even though there is a considerable number of research papers on inflation, there is still not enough knowledge about all factors which might cause inflation, and influence its evolution and dynamics. Regression analysis is a powerful statistical tool which might help analyse a vast amount of data on inflation, and provide an answer to the question about the factors of inflation, as well as the way those factors influence it. In this article Newton's Law of Cooling was applied to determine the long-term dynamics of monetary aggregates and inflation in Serbia and Croatia.\n\nHow College Students' Conceptions of Newton's Second and Third Laws Change Through Watching Interactive Video Vignettes: A Mixed Methods Study\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEngelman, Jonathan\n\nChanging student conceptions in physics is a difficult process and has been a topic of research for many years. The purpose of this study was to understand what prompted students to change or not change their incorrect conceptions of Newtons Second or Third Laws in response to an intervention, Interactive Video Vignettes (IVVs), designed to overcome them. This study is based on prior research reported in the literature which has found that a curricular framework of elicit, confront, resolve, and reflect (ECRR) is important for changing student conceptions (McDermott, 2001). This framework includes four essential parts such that during an instructional event student conceptions should be elicited, incorrect conceptions confronted, these conflicts resolved, and then students should be prompted to reflect on their learning. Twenty-two undergraduate student participants who completed either or both IVVs were studied to determine whether or not they experienced components of the ECRR framework at multiple points within the IVVs. A fully integrated, mixed methods design was used to address the study purpose. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected iteratively for each participant. Successive data collections were informed by previous data collections. All data were analyzed concurrently. The quantitative strand included a pre/post test that participants took before and after completing a given IVV and was used to measure the effect of each IVV on learning. The qualitative strand included video of each participant completing the IVV as well as an audio-recorded video elicitation interview after the post-test. The qualitative data collection was designed to describe student experiences with each IVV as well as to observe how the ECRR framework was experienced. Collecting and analyzing data using this mixed methods approach helped develop a more complete understanding of how student conceptions of Newtons Second and Third Laws changed through completion of\n\nZero-Totality in Action-Reaction Space:. A Generalization of Newton's Third Law?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKaram, Sabah E.\n\n2013-09-01\n\nIn order to present the universe as a zero-totality the key concepts of nothingness and duality are required. Diaz and Rowlands introduce processes of conjugation, complexification, and dimensionalization using a universal alphabet and rewrite system to describe a physical universe composed of nilpotents. This paper will apply the concept of conjugation to the Newtonian duality actionreaction by introducing associated dual spaces called action space-reaction space. An attempt to generalize Newton's third law of motion, utilizing the concept of dual spaces, will follow in a manner suggestive of the zero-totality fermion-vacuum relationship.\n\nApplying the Science of Learning to the Learning of Science: Newton's Second Law of Motion\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nLemmer, Miriam\n\n2018-01-01\n\nScience teaching and learning require knowledge about how learning takes place (cognition) and how learners interact with their surroundings (affective and sociocultural factors).

The study, conducted at Rochester Institute of Technology, involved students from the first and third of a three-quarter sequence. Construction of a response curve reveals subtle dynamics in student learning not captured by simple pre/post testing. We find a a significant positive effect from direct instruction, peaking at the end of instruction on forces, that diminishes by the end of the quarter. Two quarters later, in physics III, a significant dip in correct response occurs when instruction changes from the vector quantities of electric forces and fields to the scalar quantity of electric potential. Student response rebounds to its initial values, however, once instruction returns to the vector-based topics involving magnetic fields.\n\nConceptual and Laboratory Exercise to Apply Newton's Second Law to a System of Many Forces\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMungan, Carl E.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nA pair of objects on an inclined plane are connected together by a string.

While there are several possibilities for lab activities addressing the functional relationship among net force, mass, and acceleration, the qualitative understanding of the connection between forces and acceleration can still be lacking,2 leading to poor performance in problem solving and in assessments such as the Force Concept Inventory3 and Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation.4 There is a need for strong conceptual understanding of the relationships between net force and acceleration and between acceleration and velocity in order to effectively address common force-motion misconceptions;5 there is a large literature concerning student understanding of force and motion.6\n\nElectrostatics of proteins in dielectric solvent continua. I. Newton's third law marries qE forces\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStork, Martina; Tavan, Paul\n\n2007-04-01\n\nThe authors reformulate and revise an electrostatic theory treating proteins surrounded by dielectric solvent continua [B. Egwolf and P. Tavan, J. Chem. Phys. 118, 2039 (2003)] to make the resulting reaction field (RF) forces compatible with Newton's third law. Such a compatibility is required for their use in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, in which the proteins are modeled by all-atom molecular mechanics force fields. According to the original theory the RF forces, which are due to the electric field generated by the solvent polarization and act on the partial charges of a protein, i.e., the so-called qE forces, can be quite accurately computed from Gaussian RF dipoles localized at the protein atoms. Using a slightly different approximation scheme also the RF energies of given protein configurations are obtained. However, because the qE forces do not account for the dielectric boundary pressure exerted by the solvent continuum on the protein, they do not obey the principle that actio equals reactio as required by Newton's third law. Therefore, their use in MD simulations is severely hampered. An analysis of the original theory has led the authors now to a reformulation removing the main difficulties. By considering the RF energy, which represents the dominant electrostatic contribution to the free energy of solvation for a given protein configuration, they show that its negative configurational gradient yields mean RF forces obeying the reactio principle. Because the evaluation of these mean forces is computationally much more demanding than that of the qE forces, they derive a suggestion how the qE forces can be modified to obey Newton's third law. Various properties of the thus established theory, particularly issues of accuracy and of computational efficiency, are discussed. A sample application to a MD simulation of a peptide in solution is described in the following paper [M. Stork and P. Tavan, J. Chem. Phys., 126, 165106 (2007).\n\nThe Generation Model of Particle Physics and Galactic Dark Matter\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRobson, B. A.\n\n2013-09-01\n\nGalactic dark matter is matter hypothesized to account for the discrepancy of the mass of a galaxy determined from its gravitational effects, assuming the validity of Newton's law of universal gravitation, and the mass calculated from the \"luminous matter\", stars, gas, dust, etc. observed to be contained within the galaxy. The conclusive observation from the rotation curves of spiral galaxies that the mass discrepancy is greater, the larger the distance scales involved implies that either Newton's law of universal gravitation requires modification or considerably more mass (dark matter) is required to be present in each galaxy. Both the modification of Newton's law of gravitation and the hypothesis of the existence of considerable dark matter in a galaxy are discussed. It is shown that the Generation Model (GM) of particle physics, which leads to a modification of Newton's law of gravitation, is found to be essentially equivalent to that of Milgrom's modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) theory, with the GM providing a physical understanding of the MOND theory. The continuing success of MOND theory in describing the extragalactic mass discrepancy problems constitutes a strong argument against the existence of undetected dark matter haloes, consisting of unknown nonbaryonic matter, surrounding spiral galaxies.\n\nThe influence of implementation of interactive lecture demonstrations (ILD) conceptual change oriented toward the decreasing of the quantity students that misconception on the Newton's first law\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKurniawan, Yudi; Suhandi, Andi; Hasanah, Lilik\n\n2016-02-01\n\nThis paper aims to know the influence of implementation of ILD conceptual change oriented (ILD-CC) toward the decreasing of the quantity of students that misconception on the Newton's First Law. The Newton's First Law misconceptions separated into five sub-misconceptions. This research is a quantitative research with one group pretest-posttest design. The samples of this research were 32 students on 9th grade of junior high school in Pandeglang, Banten, Indonesia. The diagnostic test is a multiple-choice form with three-tier test format. The result of this study found that there was decreasing of the quantity of students that misconception on the Newton's First Law. The largest percentage in the decreasing of the number of the students that misconception was on the Misconception 4 about 80, 77%. The Misconception 4 is \"The cause of tendency of the body passenger that sat upright on the accelerated bus from motionless bus suddenly to backward be a backward force\". For the future studies, it suggested to combine other methods to optimize the decreasing the number of students that misconception.\n\nRamsey's method of separated oscillating fields and its application to gravitationally induced quantum phase shifts\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nAbele, H.; Jenke, T.; Leeb, H.\n\n2010-03-15\n\nWe propose to apply Ramsey's method of separated oscillating fields to the spectroscopy of the quantum states in the gravity potential above a horizontal mirror. This method allows a precise measurement of quantum mechanical phaseshifts of a Schroedinger wave packet bouncing off a hard surface in the gravitational field of the Earth. Measurements with ultracold neutrons will offer a sensitivity to Newton's law or hypothetical short-ranged interactions, which is about 21 orders of magnitude below the energy scale of electromagnetism.\n\nAdvanced nursing practice and Newton's three laws of motion.\n\nPubMed\n\nSturgeon, David\n\nThis article considers the reasons for the development of advanced practice roles among nurses and other healthcare professions. It explores the implications of financial constraints, consumer preferences and the development of new healthcare services on the reorganization of professional boundaries. It makes use of Sir Isaac Newton's three laws of motion to demonstrate how professional development in nursing has taken place in response to a number of external influences and demands. It also considers the significance of skill mix for the nursing profession, in particular the development and likely expansion of the physician assistant role. The application of different professionals and grades within a healthcare team or organization is central to the Government's Agenda for Change proposals and nurses have successfully adopted a number of roles traditionally performed by doctors. Nurses have demonstrated that they are capable of providing high quality care and contributing directly to positive patient outcome. Advanced nursing roles should not only reflect the changing nature of healthcare work, they should also be actively engaged in reconstructing healthcare boundaries.\n\nFrom Newton's Second Law to Huygens's Principle: Visualizing Waves in a Large Array of Masses Joined by Springs\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nDolinko, A.

A search for non-Newtonian behavior of weak-field gravity\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBoynton, Paul; Moore, Michael; Newman, Riley; Berg, Eric; Bonicalzi, Ricco; McKenney, Keven\n\n2014-06-01\n\nEmpirical tests of Einstein's metric theory of gravitation, even in the non-relativistic, weak-field limit, could play an important role in judging theory-driven extensions of the current Standard Model of fundamental interactions. Guided by Galileo's work and his own experiments, Newton formulated a theory of gravity in which the force of attraction between two bodies is independent of composition and proportional to the inertia of each, thereby transparently satisfying Galileo's empirically informed conjecture regarding the Universality of Free Fall. Similarly, Einstein honored the manifest success of Newton's theory by assuring that the linearized equations of GTR matched the Newtonian formalism under \"classical\" conditions. Each of these steps, however, was explicitly an approximation raised to the status of principle. Perhaps, at some level, Newtonian gravity does not accurately describe the physical interaction between uncharged, unmagnetized, macroscopic bits of ordinary matter. What if Newton were wrong? Detecting any significant deviation from Newtonian behavior, no matter how small, could provide new insights and possibly reveal new physics. In the context of physics as an empirical science, for us this yet unanswered question constitutes sufficient motivation to attempt precision measurements of the kind described here. In this paper we report the current status of a project to search for violation of the Newtonian inverse square law of gravity.\n\nComplex large-scale convection of a viscous incompressible fluid with heat exchange according to Newton's law\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGorshkov, A.

This system describes layered BÃ©nard-Marangoni convective flows of an incompressible viscous fluid. The third-kind boundary condition, i. e. Newton's heat transfer law, is used on the boundaries of a fluid layer. The obtained solution is analyzed. It is demonstrated that there is a fluid layer thickness with tangential stresses vanishing simultaneously, this being equivalent to the existence of tensile and compressive stresses.\n\nNewton's absolute time and space in general relativity\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGautreau, Ronald\n\n2000-04-01\n\nI describe a reference system in a spherically symmetric gravitational field that is built around times recorded by radially moving geodesic clocks. The geodesic time coordinate t and the curvature spatial radial coordinate R result in spacetime descriptions of the motion of the geodesic clocks that are exactly identical with equations following from Newton's absolute time and space used with his inverse square law. I show how to use the resulting Newtonian/general-relativistic equations for geodesic clocks to generate exact relativistic metric forms in terms of the coordinates (R,t). Newtonian theory does not describe light. However, the motion of light can be determined from the (R,t) general-relativistic metric forms obtained from Newtonian theory by setting ds2(R,t)=0. In this sense, a theory of light can be related to absolute time and space of Newtonian gravitational theory. I illustrate the (R,t) methodology by first solving the equations that result from a Newtonian picture and then examining the exact metric forms for the general-relativistic problems of the Schwarzschild field, gravitational collapse and expansion of a zero-pressure perfect fluid, and zero-pressure big-bang cosmology. I also briefly describe other applications of the Newtonian/general-relativistic formulation to: embedding a Schwarzschild mass into cosmology; continuously following an expanding universe from radiation to matter domination; Dirac's Large Numbers hypothesis; the incompleteness of Kruskal-Szekeres spacetime; double valuedness in cosmology; and the de Sitter universe.\n\nDiscovery Science: Newton All around You.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nPrigo, Robert; Humphrey, Gregg\n\n1993-01-01\n\nPresents activities for helping elementary students learn about Newton's third law of motion.

We show that the Newton-Cartan space-times are unstable under the general Kodaira deformation of the twistor complex structure. The Newton-Cartan connections can nevertheless be reconstructed from Merkulov's generalisation of the Kodaira map augmented by a choice of a holomorphic line bundle over the twistor space trivial on twistor lines. The Coriolis force may be incorporated by holomorphic vector bundles, which in general are non-trivial on twistor lines. The resulting geometries agree with non-relativistic limits of anti-self-dual gravitational instantons.\n\nCool in the kitchen: Radiation, conduction, and the Newton ``hot block'' experiment\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSilverman, Mark P.; Silverman, Christopher R.\n\n2000-02-01\n\nDespite frequent reference to Newton's law of cooling in physics and math books, the paper in which Newton reported this law is quite obscure and rarely cited. We have managed to acquire a copy of this paper and discuss the interesting experiment that Newton did in his kitchen. Surprisingly, the paper contains no procedural details or data of any experiments measuring the rate at which a hot object cools. We have performed our own kitchen experiments to investigate the cooling of (a) the burner of an electric range and (b) a block of Styrofoam. Newton's law provides a poor model for both systems, whose th! ! ermal energy loss we can much better understand by examining closely the effects of radiation and conduction.\n\nAstronomical and Cosmological Symbolism in Art Dedicated to Newton and Einstein\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSinclair, R.\n\n2013-04-01\n\nSeparated by two and a half centuries, Isaac Newton (1642-1727) and Albert Einstein (1879-1955) had profound impacts on our understanding of the universe. Newton established our understanding of universal gravitation, which was recast almost beyond recognition by Einstein. Both discovered basic patterns behind astronomical phenomena and became the best-known scientists of their respective periods. I will describe here how artists of the 18th and 20th centuries represented the achievements of Newton and Einstein. Representations of Newton express reverence, almost an apotheosis, portraying him as the creator of the universe. Einstein, in a different age, is represented often as a comic figure, and only rarely do we find art that hints at the profound view of the universe he developed.\n\nXMM-Newton study of the lensing cluster of galaxies CL 0024+17\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhang, Y.-Y.; BÃ¶hringer, H.; Mellier, Y.; Soucail, G.; Forman, W.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nWe present a detailed gravitational mass measurement based on the XMM-Newton imaging spectroscopy analysis of the lensing cluster of galaxies CL 0024+17 at z=0.395.
