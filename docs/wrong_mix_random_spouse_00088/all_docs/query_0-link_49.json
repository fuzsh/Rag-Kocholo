        "text": "May 9, 2024\n\nThe Annual Houston Antiques Dealers Association (HADA) Lecture in Honor of Katherine Howe / Speaker: Alice Cooney Frelinghuysen, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York\n\nThis lecture offers a behind-the-scenes preview of a magnificent leaded-glass window. The three-part Garden Landscape, recently acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, is scheduled to be unveiled in New York this fall. Commissioned by a woman, conceived by a woman, and largely crafted by women, the window brings focus to the significant—yet largely unknown—role of women in the art of renowned glass artist Louis Comfort Tiffany. At the same time, it sheds light on the innovations of the glass chemists and workers at Tiffany Studios and the extraordinary illusionistic effects they achieved.\n\nPlan Your Visit\n\nIncluded with Museum admission.\n\nThis lecture takes place in Brown Auditorium Theater on the lower level of the Law Building. Seating is available on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nParking Information | Museum Hours | MFAH Campus Map\n\nAbout the Speaker\n\nAlice Cooney Frelinghuysen is the Anthony W. and Lulu C. Wang Curator of American Decorative Arts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

She has curated exhibitions and authored publications on a wide range of topics, including the Herter Brothers with Katherine Howe of the MFAH. Frelinghuysen’s long-standing work on Tiffany has resulted in many publications, exhibitions, and lectures.\n\nThis MFAH lecture is endowed by the Houston Antiques Dealers Association.\n\nAll Learning and Interpretation programs at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, receive generous support from H-E-B; Institute of Museum and Library Services; Sempra Foundation; the Brown Foundation, Inc.; the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo; the Joe Barnhart Foundation; the Cockrell Family Fund; the CFP Foundation; Macey and Harry Reasoner; the Texas Commission on the Arts; and the Junior League of Houston, Inc.\n\nEndowment funds are provided by the Louise Jarrett Moran Bequest; Caroline Wiess Law; Windgate Foundation; the William Randolph Hearst Foundation; Cyvia and Melvyn Wolff; the National Endowment for the Humanities; the Fondren Foundation; BMC Software, Inc.; the Wallace Foundation; the Neal Myers and Ken Black Children’s Art Fund; the Eleanor and Frank Freed Foundation; Medha and Shashank Karve; Virginia and Ira Jackson; Jesse H.
