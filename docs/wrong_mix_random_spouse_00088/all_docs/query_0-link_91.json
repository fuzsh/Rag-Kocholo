His interest in the outdoors began to flourish through his journey in completing his Bachelor's degree in Geosciences from Humboldt State University. Jesse has worked as a seasonal education technician and interpretive park ranger for the National Park Service for the past four years. He has designed and presented several educational programs, ranging in subjects from cultural history, ecology, geology, music, and wildlife.

He has participated in several night sky related events and has played an integral role in designing two astronomy festivals. Additionally, he loves hosting nightly telescope sessions, leading hikes during the Full Moon, and guiding constellation tours across the night sky.\n\nAt his most recent assignment at Voyageurs National Park, he discovered the Voyageurs Conservancy. As an advocate for science and stewardship of the land, he quickly realized that this organization's mission closely aligned with his own values. In December 2021, Jesse was invited on board as a proud member of the team. He is beyond excited to utilize his skills with the goal of improving accessibility and sharing the beauty of science with everyone.\n\nEmail: jgates@voyageurs.org\n\nMoss has always fostered a passionate curiosity about learning and nature.
