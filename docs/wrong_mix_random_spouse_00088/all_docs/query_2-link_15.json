        "text": "The Kat Slater actress will be temporarily written out of any upcoming storylines\n\nEastenders star Jessie Wallace was reportedly suspended from the show after an 'incident' during filming.\n\nMirror Online reports the actress, who has played Kat Slater for nearly 20 years, was hauled in front of show bosses for her behaviour.\n\n‌\n\nA source claims Jessie, 48, was pulled into a 'crisis meeting' - but the details of the incident remain unclear.\n\nShe will be written out of any upcoming storylines on the show after being suspended from the popular BBC1 soap, according to the Mirror.\n\n‌\n\nLiverpool Echo Icon\n\nSign up to FREE email alerts from ECHO Daily News\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you’ve consented to and improve our understanding of you.

More info\n\nIt is believed her suspension from the show is expected to last two months, following 'crunch talks' with bosses.\n\nSpeaking to Mirror Online, the show insider said: “Bosses were left with no choice but to discipline her. During the meeting she was told to sort herself out before returning to work.\n\n‌\n\n“Scriptwriters are currently coming up with a storyline to explain Kat’s temporary exit from Walford.”\n\nThe mum-of-one is understood to have already filmed her scenes for the soap’s 35th Anniversary Special on February 19.\n\n‌\n\nShow bosses have already confirmed that the anniversary storyline will involve one character dying in a boat tragedy.\n\n‌\n\nThe source said: “She’s one of EastEnders’ biggest stars and this huge anniversary is such an exciting time for everyone working on the show.\n\n“There’s a real buzz around the set, as everyone is very much looking forward to celebrating the milestone.\n\n“Thankfully all of the episodes she appears in on the boat along the Thames have been shot, so her suspension didn’t cause any chaos to the soap’s big birthday week.\n\n‌\n\n“Nonetheless it’s such a shame Jessie’s out for a while because this really is such an exciting and historic time for everyone working on the show.\n\nShe’s one of the most talented actresses out there and her character is a soap icon.\n\n“Yet now she won’t be a part of all the celebrations being planned behind the scenes.”\n\n‌\n\n‌\n\nAn EastEnders spokeswoman said last night when asked about the suspension: “We do not comment on artists’ contracts.” A spokesperson for Jessie declined to comment.\n\nThe actress has been at the centre of some of EastEnders’ biggest storylines since arriving with the rest of the Slater clan in 2000.\n\nShe was involved in one of the soap’s most iconic moments when daughter Zoe yelled at her, “You ain’t my muvva”, and Kat screamed back, “Yes I am”."
