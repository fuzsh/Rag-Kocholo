Could she play a vital role in Bobby's exit storyline?\n\nActress Laurie Brett said of her short return: \"It’s been so long since we last saw Jane that I was keen to know what the story would be to bring her back. So, I had a meeting with Chris Clenshaw (executive producer), and he laid out the story for me and why they’d love me to be a part of it. By the end of that chat, I was in.\n\n\"I was excited to work with Adam again, as well as Michelle and Clay. It was also great to be reunited with Thomas Law, who I’ve known since he was a child – although these days, I have to look up to speak to Tom, and I’m tall myself! It was just lovely.\"\n\nDean Wicks (Matt Di Angelo)\n\nWhen is Dean Wicks leaving? Mid-2024.\n\nActor Matt Di Angelo has revealed that he has finished filming as villain Dean Wicks in EastEnders as the character is soon to go on trial for the murder of Keanu Taylor.\n\nWhile Dean may be innocent of killing Keanu, he has escaped justice for countless other crimes, so could this be him finally getting his comeuppance?\n\nSpeaking to The Sun at the RadioTimes.com Soap Awards 2024, Di Angelo revealed: \"There is a trial. I know the result of the trial, because we've filmed it already. I can tell you - but I won't because it would ruin the television.\"\n\nThe actor said Dean is \"a fun character to play\" but added that he can \"handle a bit of him every six years or so, and then after a week you're like, 'OK enough of this'.\"\n\nSo, maybe this exit won't be quite as final as it appears...\n\nRETURNING\n\nChrissie Watts (Tracy-Ann Oberman)\n\nWhen is Chrissie Watts returning? Autumn 2024.\n\nTracy-Ann Oberman is set to reprise her classic role as murderous Chrissie Watts later this year for a short guest stint.\n\nThe character was last seen in 2005 after being convicted for the murder of husband \"Dirty\" Den Watts.\n\nTracy-Ann Oberman said about her return to EastEnders: \"Chrissie Watts was such a great character to play – a victim or a villain.\n\n\"She is a real fan favourite, so when Chris Clenshaw asked me to come back and re-visit her and see what has happened in the last 19 years, I jumped at the chance. The scripts are fantastic and I hope the viewers enjoy her as much as I am enjoying playing her again.\"\n\nChris Clenshaw, Executive Producer, added: \"I’m delighted to welcome the immensely talented Tracy-Ann back to the iconic role of Chrissie Watts.\n\n\"Although the character hasn’t been seen on screen for almost 20 years, Chrissie is cemented in EastEnders’ rich history for her murder of Walford’s most infamous villain, and Sharon’s beloved father, Dirty Den.\"\n\nDavid Wicks (Michael French)\n\nWhen is David Wicks returning? Autumn 2024.\n\nWalford icon David Wicks will return for a short stint on EastEnders later this year as actor Michael French reprises his role.\n\nDavid is famously the son of Pat Butcher (Pam St. Clement) and Pete Beale (Peter Dean), the half-brother of both Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) and Simon Wicks (Nick Berry), the former lover of Ian’s wife Cindy Beale (Michelle Collins), and the father of fellow Walford icon Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer) and his children with former wife Lorraine Wicks (Jacqueline Leonard) – Joe (Paul Nicholls) and Karen Wicks.\n\nIn his most recent stint in Walford, David had a romantic reconciliation with Bianca’s mother and his childhood sweetheart Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson) amid her journey with breast cancer and they became engaged, however, their romance broke down as their wedding fell apart.\n\nDiscussing his return as David Wicks after a decade away, actor Michael French said: “I feel honoured to be asked to reprise the role of David Wicks once again. It may only be a brief visit, but we know from his past that David never fails to create a lot of drama in a very short time.”\n\nMeanwhile, executive producer Chris Clenshaw added: “David Wicks is undoubtedly one of EastEnders’ most beloved rogues, and we are thrilled to welcome the talented Michael French back to the legendary role as we lead up to the show’s 40th anniversary. David’s character was never shy of drama during his previous stints, and I can assure you this return will be no different.”\n\nShirley Carter (Linda Henry)\n\nWhen is Shirley Carter returning to EastEnders? TBC.\n\nEastEnders fan-favourite Shirley Carter made a surprise departure from Walford just after Christmas in 2022 following the apparent death of her son Mick Carter.\n\nDeciding that there was nothing left for her in Walford, Shirley walked out of the Square with Lady Di the dog to stay with daughter Carly Wicks and her family, having said goodbye to friends Jean Slater and Denise Fox.\n\nWe then heard of Shirley in February 2023 when we learned that she had also reunited with her previously estranged son Dean Wicks off-screen, the man who had raped Mick's true love, Linda Carter.\n\nWhen Dean made his horrific return on Halloween, he claimed that Shirley had experienced a mental breakdown and had been institutionalised and after Linda wasn't in contact with her, changed her number and wanted nothing to do with her.\n\nLinda was distrustful of Dean's claims but was unable to get through to Shirley, meaning her fate remains mysterious.\n\nActress Linda Henry is taking an extended break from the show and has been off our screens for over a year.\n\nHowever, the BBC confirmed to RadioTimes.com at the time of her exit that Shirley had not left the soap for good and would return.\n\nChris Clenshaw also told us in Autumn 2023: \"So, Linda Henry is currently taking a break from the show.\n\n\"But you know, when she walked off with Lady Di last year, in the wake of Mick’s disappearance, it won't have been the last you see of her. I can say that for sure.\"\n\nWill Shirley return before Dean leaves Walford for good?\n\nWhich characters departed EastEnders in 2024?\n\nThe following characters have departed EastEnders in 2024.\n\nAshton (Guest)\n\nHarold Martin (Guest)\n\nSam Mitchell\n\nKaren Taylor (Guest)\n\nKeanu Taylor (Guest)\n\nLucas Johnson (Guest)\n\nBen Mitchell\n\nGloria Knight (Guest)\n\nEddie Knight (Guest)\n\nKeeley Wainwright (Guest)\n\nBritney Wainwright\n\nDolly Dean-Hudson\n\nWhitney Dean\n\nMonique Knight (Guest)\n\nXavier Knight (Guest)\n\nWhich characters departed EastEnders in 2023?\n\nThe following characters have departed EastEnders in 2023.\n\nDCI Samantha Keeble (Guest)\n\nRicky Butcher (Guest)\n\nScarlett Butcher\n\nEdward \"Jed\" Chadwick (Guest)\n\nRyan Malloy (Guest)\n\nDr Ash Kaur\n\nVi Highway\n\nShifty Shiv (Guest)\n\nRoxy Mitchell (Guest)\n\nDuncan Boyd (Guest)\n\nLola Pearce-Brown\n\nLauren Branning (Guest)\n\nLouie Beale (Guest)\n\nFinlay Baker\n\nJo Cotton (Guest)\n\nPeggy Taylor (Guest)\n\nLisa Fowler (Guest)\n\nArthur \"Fatboy\" Chubb (Guest)\n\nGraham Foster (Guest)\n\nDorian Gates (Guest)\n\nNadine Keller (Guest)\n\nTheo Hawthorne\n\nKaren Taylor\n\nMitch Baker\n\nBailey Baker\n\nMia Atkins\n\nMackenzie Atkins\n\nKeanu Taylor\n\nTom \"Rocky\" Cotton\n\nWhich characters departed EastEnders in 2022?\n\nThe following characters departed EastEnders in 2022.\n\nIqra Ahmed\n\nMila Marwa\n\nKioni Marwa\n\nGray Atkins\n\nKeegan Baker\n\nTiffany Butcher\n\nIsaac Baptiste\n\nAaron Monroe\n\nNancy Carter\n\nAvery Baker\n\nRainie Highway\n\nRoland Highway\n\nStuart Highway\n\nDana Monroe\n\nFrankie Lewis\n\nDr Nina Gupta\n\nKheerat Panesar\n\nLofty Holloway (Guest)\n\nMary Smith (Guest)\n\nDisa O'Brien (Guest)\n\nIan Beale (Guest)\n\nColin Russell (Guest)\n\nBarry Clark (Guest)\n\nKirsty \"Dotty\" Cotton\n\nJada Lennox\n\nAlyssa Lennox\n\nMick Carter\n\nJanine Carter\n\nShirley Carter\n\nEastEnders airs Mondays to Thursdays at 7:30pm on BBC One and from 6am on BBC iPlayer.
