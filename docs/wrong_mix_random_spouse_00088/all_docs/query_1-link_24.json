        "text": "1. Jerry Nadler\n\nMember of Congress\n\nRep. Jerry Nadler has had a lot of ups and downs in the last year. Redistricting threw him into New York’s battle of the titans, and he came out on top, defeating longtime Rep. Carolyn Maloney to represent a new district spanning Manhattan’s West Side and East Side. At the same time, the new GOP majority in Congress cost Nadler being the chair of the Judiciary Committee. On the policy front, Nadler led approved legislation such as the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act and the Fairness for 9/11 Families Act. Additionally, Nadler secured more than $22.6 million that will go to funding 15 community projects across his old Manhattan and Brooklyn district.\n\n2. Adriano Espaillat\n\nMember of Congress\n\nRep. Adriano Espaillat is serving his fourth term in Congress, where he is on the influential Appropriations Committee overseeing the federal government’s spending. He is co-chair of the relaunched Congressional New Americans Caucus and, in June, led the New York delegation in securing another $104.7 million in FEMA funds to support relief efforts for asylum-seekers. Locally, Espaillat is a known kingmaker who’s an ally of New York City Mayor Eric Adams and has successfully backed Dominican American candidates to occupy seats representing Upper Manhattan.\n\n3. Liz Krueger\n\nState Senator\n\nIn two decades, state Sen. Liz Krueger has gone from narrowly losing a state Senate race to being a key Albany power player. The influential chair of the state Senate Finance Committee was instrumental in shaping the state’s contentious (and late) $229 billion budget this past session. Among the approved budget priorities were increased penalties on unlicensed pot businesses, which Krueger championed personally, funding for the battered Metropolitan Transportation Authority and a modest minimum wage hike. She is co-sponsoring a bill to restore the old-time champerty law as a means to rein in Wall Street hedge funds.\n\n4. Alvin Bragg\n\nManhattan District Attorney\n\nHarlem native Alvin Bragg was elected as Manhattan’s chief prosecutor in 2021 amid a rising desire for reform-minded prosecutors against conservative practices rooted in New York City’s justice system – an environment that has made him a prime target for progressives and conservatives alike. Bragg is now in the midst of carrying out the biggest case of his career yet: leading New York’s criminal case against Donald Trump over the former president’s alleged hush money scheme following his March indictment.\n\n5. Brad Hoylman-Sigal\n\nState Senator\n\nState Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal chairs the powerful state Senate Judiciary Committee, which placed him at the center of the successful effort on the left to scuttle Hector LaSalle’s nomination for state chief judge this year. As one of New York’s highest-ranking out gay elected officials, Hoylman-Sigal has passed multiple equal rights protections, including the Gender Expression Non-Discrimination Act supporting transgender people. Following the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling that limits protections for LGBTQ+ customers, the state senator wrote, “New York will continue to stand as a refuge for LGBTQ people and I’ll do whatever I can to keep it that way.”\n\n6. Cordell Cleare, Kristen Gonzalez, Robert Jackson, Brian Kavanagh & Jose M. Serrano\n\nState Senators\n\nState Senate Housing, Construction and Community Development Committee Chair Brian Kavanagh has been at the forefront of a number of major housing policy changes since Democrats took control in 2019, but this year’s legislative ended with little to show on that front. Kavanagh supported Gov. Kathy Hochul’s recently announced inclusion of 1,200 housing units at 5 World Trade Center.\n\nAfter overcoming a primary challenge from a candidate backed by Rep. Adriano Espaillat last year, state Sen. Robert Jackson returned to Albany advocating for increasing taxes on the ultrawealthy and requiring schools to inform parents about bullying. Jackson is also a longtime proponent of increased school funding.\n\nThe Senate majority conference chair and longtime chair of the Senate Cultural Affairs, Tourism, Parks and Recreation Committee, state Sen. Jose M. Serrano pushed for increased state commitment to the arts.\n\nState Sen. Cordell Cleare, who took office in 2021 after winning a special election, has pushed for the elimination of the statute of limitations on sex trafficking and advocated for the passage of “good cause” eviction legislation.\n\nThe city’s only tri-borough state senator is Kristen Gonzalez, a Democratic Socialists of America-backed lawmaker elected last year who has been pushing for progressive measures such as the Build Public Renewables Act, a version of which was included in the state budget this year. She chairs the Internet and Technology Committee.\n\n7. Kathryn Wylde\n\nPresident and CEO, Partnership for New York City\n\nKathryn Wylde is a preeminent business leader with deep political connections that she has nurtured for the past two decades as head of Partnership for New York City. An ally of Mayor Eric Adams, Wylde heads a group that supports public transit policies and initiatives that push economic growth, such as congestion pricing and the Transit Tech Lab, which her group launched with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Wylde also has advocated for passing the Clean Slate Act, which she argues would help overcome the state’s worker shortage.\n\n8. Al Sharpton\n\nPresident and Founder, National Action Network\n\nA prominent civil rights leader whose approval is regularly sought by political candidates courting support in Harlem’s predominantly Black districts, the Rev. Al Sharpton wields undiminished influence in New York and nationwide. He decried the U.S. Supreme Court ruling against race-based affirmative action as “a dagger in the back of Black America,” and advocated policies to mitigate police violence during mental health crises. In May, Sharpton delivered an impassioned eulogy for Jordan Neely, who was killed during a mental health episode on a subway car by a bystander.\n\n9. Diana Ayala, Gale Brewer & Keith Powers\n\nNew York City Council Members\n\nSome people just know how to brew power. These Manhattan lawmakers may have been rivals in the previous race for the New York City Council speakership, but in the end they all backed Adrienne Adams and joined her leadership team. Gale Brewer, a former borough president, chairs the powerful Oversight and Investigations Committee; Diana Ayala is deputy speaker and General Welfare Committee chair; and Keith Powers is the majority leader. In July, the City Council voted 42-8 to override Mayor Eric Adams’ veto on a slate of bills meant to address housing and homelessness, a key Ayala priority. It was the first council veto override since the Bloomberg era.\n\n10. Mark Levine\n\nManhattan Borough President\n\nAs a borough president representing 1.6 million Manhattanites, Mark Levine is largely focused on redevelopment. Earlier this year, the former New York City Council member unveiled his plans to address Manhattan’s housing crisis, which involve utilizing abandoned plots across the island, and, in June, opened calls for public proposals as part of the East Harlem Downtown Revitalization Initiative. Levine said that he backs redevelopment plans for Penn Station that would require shrinking – not razing – Madison Square Garden.\n\n11. Damian Williams\n\nU.S. Attorney, Southern District of New York\n\nU.S. Attorney Damian Williams broke barriers as the first Black U.S. attorney for the prestigious Southern District of New York, which covers Manhattan, the Bronx and a few Hudson Valley counties. He has taken on the cryptocurrency industry, toppled a lieutenant governor and called for a federal takeover of Rikers Island. As an assistant U.S. attorney, he was involved in the high-profile prosecutions of former Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and Ghislaine Maxwell. Williams also chairs the Attorney General’s Advisory Committee, an advisory group to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland.\n\n12. Alex Bores, Manny De Los Santos, Inez Dickens, Harvey Epstein, Charles Fall, Eddie Gibbs, Deborah Glick, Grace Lee, Daniel O’Donnell, Linda Rosenthal, Rebecca Seawright, Tony Simone & Al Taylor\n\nAssembly Members\n\nAssembly Member Deborah Glick – New York’s first out LGBTQ+ state lawmaker – traded her longtime perch atop the Higher Education Committee for the Environmental Conservation Committee’s gavel this year, putting her in the thick of debates over everything from climate policy to whether or not there should be cash prizes for hunters. Assembly Member Linda Rosenthal, who became the first woman to chair the Housing Committee as of this year, will have to wait at least until next year to address a number of key housing issues that went unaddressed, including creating a housing voucher protection fund.\n\nAssembly Member Rebecca Seawright assumed the chair of the People with Disabilities Committee this year and has outlined an ambitious policy agenda.\n\nAssembly Member Daniel O’Donnell promoted increased state investment in the arts in his role chairing the Tourism, Parks, Arts and Sports Development Committee.\n\nAssembly Member Harvey Epstein is pushing for increased funding for reproductive education programs for medical interns and access to abortion pills on CUNY and SUNY campuses.\n\nAssembly Member Grace Lee touted an increase to $30 million in the state budget for the Asian American Pacific Islander community, and she also introduced legislation with state Sen. John Liu to mandate AAPI history in public school curriculums statewide.\n\nAssembly Members Alex Bores and Tony Simone have had unique first years in Albany. Bores passed measures to mandate gender-neutral terms in state law and to create new judgeships from Manhattan to Niagara Falls. Simone found himself in a feud with James Dolan over the use of facial recognition to bar attorneys suing him from entering Madison Square Garden.\n\nAssembly Member Manny De Los Santos, a former school social worker, is pushing for protections for retail workers from violent crime, while Assembly Member Eddie Gibbs, New York’s first formerly incarcerated state lawmaker, wants to rename city properties in Harlem named after Thomas Jefferson.\n\nAssembly Members Inez Dickens and Al Taylor fell short in a high-profile New York City Council race in Harlem won by newcomer Yusef Salaam.\n\nAssembly Member Charles Fall represents a newly drawn district that includes part of Staten Island and Lower Manhattan.\n\n13. Dan Goldman\n\nMember of Congress\n\nRep. Dan Goldman represents the new lower Manhattan and Brooklyn district. The first-term lawmaker occupies a seat on the influential House Oversight and Accountability Committee, where the former prosecutor has not shied away from clashing with his GOP counterparts. He has called for Rep. George Santos’ removal and teamed up with Rep. Ritchie Torres to file an ethics complaint against Santos. Alongside Rep. Jerry Nadler, Goldman was a major proponent of Manhattan’s approved congestion pricing plans. Goldman is well known for his love of bagels and showing Washington a world outside of Bethesda Bagels.\n\n14. Michael Dowling\n\nPresident and CEO, Northwell Health\n\nMichael Dowling has led Northwell Health for two decades, making him one of New York’s most seasoned and influential health care executives. As the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, Dowling has shifted his focus toward another less tangible yet equally pressing public health concern: gun violence, which has emerged as the country’s leading cause of death among children. In addition to Northwell’s forum on gun violence prevention this year, Dowling helped create the National Health Care CEO Council on Gun Violence Prevention and Safety.\n\n15. Sid Davidoff & Keith Wright\n\nFounding Partner; Director of Strategic Planning, Davidoff Hutcher & Citron\n\nBoth Sid Davidoff and Keith Wright are veterans of New York politics. Davidoff, who co-founded the law firm in 1974, was counsel to the New York City Council and various city agencies. Wright currently chairs the Manhattan Democratic Party and served 23 years in the Assembly. Wright was a key force behind Yusef Salaam’s victory over two state legislators in the race for a New York City Council seat in Harlem. Since October, the firm has been embroiled in an unusual legal fight with Madison Square Garden after nearly 60 of the firm’s lawyers were banned from the venue following a separate case by its client against MSG.\n\n16. Shaun Abreu, Erik Bottcher, Carmen De La Rosa, Kristin Richardson Jordan, Christopher Marte, Julie Menin & Carlina Rivera\n\nNew York City Council Members\n\nNew York City Council Member Julie Menin became the Upper East Side’s representative after holding three key leadership posts in the de Blasio administration and a stint chairing Manhattan Community Board 1 following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The former Manhattan borough president candidate passed major legislation this year creating the new New York City Office of Healthcare Accountability.\n\nCouncil Member Shaun Abreu, an ally of Rep. Adriano Espaillat, has passed legislation to ban height and weight discrimination in the workplace and is touting city funding he brought to his district. Council Member Erik Bottcher, an out gay lawmaker representing a district long held by members of the LGBTQ+ community, has been a stalwart supporter for drag queen story hours, in spite of protesters storming his Chelsea apartment building. Bottcher has also worked on cleaner streets and homeless services issues.\n\nFour other Manhattan representatives are part of the City Council’s Progressive Caucus: Carlina Rivera, Carmen De La Rosa, Christopher Marte and Kristin Richardson Jordan. Coming off an unsuccessful run for Congress last year, Rivera won 60% of the June primary vote for her reelection. As the Criminal Justice Committee chair, Rivera has focused on closing Rikers Island. Marte also fended off a primary challenge in June and continues to advocate for such issues as limiting overdevelopment and shifting some police funding to social services. De La Rosa, the Civil Service and Labor Committee chair, backed Mayor Eric Adams’ controversial plan to move city retirees to a new health insurance plan, while also pushing City Hall to implement the city’s new climate law targeting building emissions.\n\nRichardson Jordan announced she wouldn’t seek reelection following a tumultuous two-year tenure marked by battles over real estate development and policing.\n\n17. Bill Thompson & Félix V. Matos Rodríguez\n\nChair; Chancellor, CUNY\n\nBill Thompson and Félix V. Matos Rodríguez are CUNY’s top brass, overseeing a system hosting nearly half a million students as it remains among the nation’s top public colleges – even after a brutal pandemic. CUNY won $32 million back to the public college’s funding in the city’s budget amid fears of cuts. Like other higher education institutions, CUNY is in the midst of a contract battle with staff and faculty unions. Thompson, a former New York City comptroller, enters his seventh year on the job while Matos Rodríguez, the first Latino to lead the institution, has begun his fourth year as chancellor.\n\n18. Mike Bloomberg\n\nFounder and CEO, Bloomberg LP\n\nMike Bloomberg may no longer be New York City mayor – the only one with enough juice to demand a third term despite the city’s two-term limit – but his influence remains strong. The billionaire was a big backer of Eric Adams’ successful mayoral campaign, with some of his former advisers now embedded in Adams’ administration, and shelled out $10 million to the House Majority PAC to support Democrats during midterms. His charity, Bloomberg Philanthropies, may soon get a hefty financial boost as he reportedly intends to surrender Bloomberg LP to the foundation.\n\n19. Steven Roth\n\nCEO, Vornado Realty Trust\n\nSteven Roth made headlines this summer with his proclamation that Fridays in the office are “dead forever.” The return of office employees in Manhattan is certainly top of mind for Roth, who leads one of New York’s largest real estate investment firms. But business for the prolific political donor is still booming: Beyond the $1.2 billion Penn Station project he paused, Roth’s firm closed on related leasing deals with Citadel and Rudin that include a $1.4 billion buyout option. However, a plan to partner with the state on an overhaul of Penn Station has been dropped.\n\n20. James & Merryl Tisch\n\nPresident and CEO; Board Chair, Loews Corp.; SUNY\n\nThe Tisch family name remains one of the most powerful in New York. Merryl Tisch, a seasoned education executive, has served as SUNY chair since 2019 and is on the New York City Public Design Commission. James Tisch, meanwhile, is chief executive of the family’s conglomerate jewel, Loews Corp., and holds prominent seats on multiple boards, including as recurring co-chair for Mount Sinai Health System. A top Manhattan power couple, James and Merryl Tisch are both trustees of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, and their foundation holds a reported $59 million in assets.\n\n21. Jeff Blau & Bruce Beal Jr.\n\nCEO; President, Related Companies\n\nWith over $60 billion in assets, Related Companies continues to be a leader in Manhattan and the country’s real estate industries. Jeff Blau and Bruce Beal Jr. are leading the development company’s new push to win a downstate casino license in conjunction with Wynn Resorts. The proposal includes a 1,700 room resort hotel, an office tower and a high-end shopping and dining district next to Related-owned Hudson Yards. Related Chair Stephen Ross has been focused lately on South Florida development, where he believes New Yorkers will be relocating due to concerns over taxes and crime.\n\n22. Steven Rubenstein\n\nPresident, Rubenstein\n\nSteven Rubenstein leads public relations juggernaut Rubenstein, founded by his late father, Howard, in 1954. Under the younger Rubenstein, the firm has continued to flourish with a portfolio of 400 clients that includes the likes of Estée Lauder, the Walt Disney Co. and the Museum of Modern Art. The University of Pennsylvania graduate serves as chair of the Association for a Better New York and sits on a plethora of executive boards including the Mayor’s Fund to Advance New York City and the Partnership for New York City.\n\n23. Suri Kasirer & Julie Greenberg\n\nFounder and President; Executive Vice President, Kasirer\n\nKasirer is New York City’s top lobbying firm by revenue, pulling in nearly $15.5 million from clients last year. Driving its ongoing success is founder Suri Kasirer, whose connections and business savvy have landed notable clients like the Hotel Association of New York City, Lincoln Center and SL Green Realty Corp. A key member of Kasirer’s leadership team is Executive Vice President Julie Greenberg, whose prior work in the Assembly has proven beneficial to the firm’s work with intergovernmental agencies.\n\n24. Emily Giske & Violet Moss\n\nSenior Partner; Partner, Bolton-St. Johns\n\nEmily Giske and Violet Moss have been instrumental in the success of the lobbying firm Bolton-St. Johns, which is now the second-ranking lobbying firm in New York City by revenue. Both have political ties across the city and state. Giske – who helped push the passage of New York’s Marriage Equality Act in 2011 – is a longtime member of the Democratic National Committee and serves as a vice chair for the New York Democratic Party, the first out LGBTQ+ person to do so. Moss, meanwhile, served as a senior legislative analyst for the Assembly Health Committee before pivoting to the private sector to work for top firms like Mercury and The Parkside Group.\n\n25. James Capalino\n\nFounder and CEO, Capalino\n\nJames Capalino was embedded in New York politics even before launching his lobbying firm, Capalino, now among the top-earning firms in New York City while raking in $5.5 million last year. He helped former New York City Mayor Ed Koch win reelection twice and fostered a close relationship with then-Mayor Bill de Blasio during his administration. Capalino’s firm has been involved in high-stakes real estate developments like Hudson Yards and secured deals for clients such as Related Companies, Somos Community Care and UPS.\n\n26. James Whelan\n\nPresident, Real Estate Board of New York\n\nJames Whelan is among New York’s top real estate power brokers. The Real Estate Board of New York, which Whelan has led since 2019, has been significant in advancing the interests of developers. Amid efforts to revive New York’s 421-a tax break incentive and block a state “good cause” eviction proposal, the trade group is also looking at broker fees as lawmakers push to shift the cost away from tenants. Whelan sits on the Fordham Real Estate Institute’s executive advisory council alongside other influential real estate executives to support the school’s talent retention.\n\n27. Ed Wallace, John Mascialino & Jonathan Bing\n\nCo-Chair, New York Office; Shareholders, Greenberg Traurig\n\nThis trio from Greenberg Traurig is hypertapped into New York politics. Ed Wallace, who runs the global firm’s Manhattan office, was a New York City Council member and serves as general counsel to the Citizens Budget Commission. John Mascialino, who oversees the firm’s New York Government Law and Policy Practice, served under various city agencies including as counsel and deputy chief of staff for deputy mayor for operations. And Jonathan Bing is a former Assembly member. The firm represented SL Green Realty Corp. in its major purchase of 450 Park Ave. and a $300 million partial sale of the Lipstick Building to the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.\n\n28. Luis Miranda Jr.\n\nFounding Partner, MirRam Group\n\nLuis Miranda Jr. is a seasoned politico. He served as an adviser to former New York City Mayor Ed Koch and was involved in the successful U.S. Senate campaigns of Democratic bigwigs like Hillary Rodham Clinton and Chuck Schumer. The Puerto Rico native was the founding president of the Hispanic Federation before launching his own consulting and lobbying firm, MirRam Group, in 2000, while serving high-profile elected officials as a campaign adviser. He also enjoys strong ties in New York’s art circles – Miranda was elected unanimously as the new chair of The Public Theater’s board of trustees last fall.\n\n29. Rob Speyer\n\nPresident and CEO, Tishman Speyer\n\nRob Speyer is heir to the Tishman Speyer real estate empire and has taken on key civic roles like chairing the advisory board of the Mayor’s Fund to Advance New York City under three different mayors, including Mayor Eric Adams. Among his priorities for the firm is the revitalization of Manhattan’s iconic Rockefeller Center, which could see a future hotel addition. This year, Tishman Speyer locked in a $1.1 billion property deal in Shanghai and secured $750 million in financing to build Harvard’s research campus.\n\n30. Yusef Salaam\n\nNew York City Council Democratic Nominee\n\nYusef Salaam’s life story as a political newcomer is quite unique. He was one of five Black teenagers who were wrongfully convicted over the rape of a white woman in Central Park in the 1980s. The convictions were overturned after Salaam spent nearly seven years behind bars. Now, Salaam is poised to represent Harlem in the New York City Council after a shock victory in a primary where he defeated two state legislators, including one who had previously held the council seat. Cutting the school-to-prison pipeline was a motivating factor of his candidacy.\n\n31. Allen Roskoff\n\nPresident, Jim Owles Liberal Democratic Club\n\nThe Jim Owles Liberal Democratic Club is one of a handful of LGBTQ+ political clubs in New York and is named for the late gay rights icon Jim Owles, who founded the Gay Activists Alliance. Longtime club leader Allen Roskoff this year invited Mary Trump – who is out gay and a vocal critic against her uncle, former President Donald Trump – to headline the club’s winter dinner. In a show of its political force, all but one of the Democratic candidates endorsed by the club in the June primaries won their races.\n\n32. Larry Silverstein & Marty Burger\n\nChair; CEO, Silverstein Properties\n\nLarry Silverstein is the latest real estate mogul to join the bidding war over New York City’s planned casinos, proposing his firm’s plot four blocks west of Times Square as the location for a new gambling hub. Silverstein Properties owns over $10 billion in commercial and residential real estate, and is the engine behind the World Trade Center’s decades long rebuilding as the site’s primary leaseholder. The firm’s CEO, Marty Burger, oversees its business activities, which recently include the acquisition of 55 Broad Street, which the company will convert to residences, and the recently approved residential tower at 5 World Trade Center.\n\n33. Jessica Lappin\n\nPresident, Alliance for Downtown New York\n\nA former New York City Council member representing the Upper East Side, Jessica Lappin now devotes her efforts toward the prosperity of lower Manhattan as head of the Alliance for Downtown New York. Last year was a busy year for the group as its area saw about 12 million visitors, representing a 59% hike from 2021. Lappin’s group launched a business incubator for small entrepreneurs and helped secure $4.2 billion for environmental projects through the Clean Water, Clean Air, and Green Jobs Bond Act.\n\n34. William Floyd & Angela Sung Pinsky\n\nSenior Director, U.S. State and Local Government Affairs and Public Policy; Head of Government Affairs and Public Policy, New York, Google\n\nGoogle has been maintaining strong relations with New York officials as it wraps up construction on a new 1.3-million-square-foot headquarters, and William Floyd and Angela Sung Pinsky are at the heart of the company’s government affairs and public policy. Google can rest easy after a U.S.-EU deal was reached over the flow of data sharing between tech companies in the separate jurisdictions this summer. Meanwhile, the company’s New York priorities have included building economic and educational opportunities as the state continues through its post-pandemic recovery.\n\n35. Jessica Walker\n\nPresident and CEO, Manhattan Chamber of Commerce\n\nJessica Walker has become among New York City’s biggest supporters and critics over its efforts to bring back business to the Big Apple. She has praised Mayor Eric Adams’ business-friendly governing style but has been vocal about the need for increased government support. Walker joined other chamber leaders in Albany to lobby for further criminalization of shoplifting offenses, a key priority for retail businesses. She has also come out against congestion pricing, which she believes could hurt Manhattan’s recovery.\n\n36. Wellington Chen\n\nExecutive Director, Chinatown Partnership Local Development Corp.\n\nWellington Chen spearheads development initiatives and interagency collaborations as head of the Chinatown Partnership Local Development Corp. A longtime leader among New York City’s Chinese American communities, Chen is often privy to the city’s development plans including how redeveloping Citi Field stadium’s parking lot could take shape. Chen has called for government support to build a Chinatown archway for decades and finally secured its funding as part of $20 million in state funding dedicated to Chinatown’s post-coronavirus pandemic revitalization.\n\n37. Christine Quinn\n\nPresident and CEO, Win\n\nChristine Quinn has been a trailblazing Manhattan power player since her New York City Council days, where she served two terms as the first woman and first out gay speaker. Now Quinn runs Win, the city’s largest family shelter and supportive housing provider. She has pushed Mayor Eric Adams to increase funding for housing and showed she knows how to get stuff done in City Hall, with the City Council approving her plan to give those in shelters housing vouchers earlier than the previous 90 day wait and expanding voucher eligibility – which overwhelmingly passed despite Adams’ objections.\n\n38. Douglas Durst\n\nChair, The Durst Organization\n\nIn addition to carrying on the work of his family’s third-generation business, Douglas Durst chairs the powerful Real Estate Board of New York. Despite industry woes over Manhattan’s vacancies, Durst’s company plans to move from its flagship One Bryant Park tower to its old digs on 1155 Sixth Ave. – which went through a $150 million makeover – to accommodate its expanding workforce. Durst believes that building conversions, expanded housing vouchers and development incentives like the 421-a program are key to addressing the housing shortage.\n\n39. Robert Grossman\n\nDean and CEO, NYU Langone Health\n\nDr. Robert Grossman is not afraid to push the envelope, evidenced by his move to provide full-tuition scholarships to all NYU Grossman School of Medicine five years ago. That tenacity lives on through the evolution of NYU Langone's award-winning health care system under Grossman’s stewardship. The hospital recently teamed up with researchers at Brown University to study the impact of the overdose prevention centers opened in New York and Rhode Island, and it has begun experimenting with artificial intelligence-assisted treatment for patients using a program dubbed NYUTron.\n\n40. Steven Corwin\n\nPresident and CEO, NewYork-Presbyterian\n\nNew York-Presbyterian stayed afloat during the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic in large part thanks to Dr. Steven Corwin’s strong leadership, with the hospital shelling out $1 billion to cover protective gear and other measures to keep staff safe.

In addition to greenlighting the hospital’s revamped marketing campaign, Corwin secured a $35 million boost to support and expand its behavioral health services and extra funding for its Iona School of Health Sciences in Bronxville.\n\n41.

Anthony Marx\n\nPresident and CEO, New York Public Library\n\nIn a time when books are being banned and politicized, public spaces like New York’s iconic public library system hold a greater impact. New York Public Library President and CEO Anthony Marx and his city library counterparts led an effort to dodge a $36 million cut in this year’s city budget after a vigorous campaign to draw public support against the cuts. But the tussle has left library executives like Marx, who raked in a salary of upward of $1 million in 2020, as potential targets for future budget considerations.\n\n43. S. David Wu\n\nPresident, Baruch College\n\nBaruch College has a lot in the works and spearheading it all is its president, S. David Wu. In addition to launching an independent entrepreneurship department, Wu wants to expand the college’s successful community college partnerships, which Wu said would allow for Baruch to further diversify its student body. Baruch so far has pipeline partnerships for its business academy with Borough of Manhattan Community College, Queensborough Community College and LaGuardia Community College.

Contreras, a proud Dominican American, had been with NYC Health + Hospitals for 26 years before taking over the Metropolitan branch in East Harlem. In June, Contreras joined Rep. Adriano Espaillat to host U.S. Health and Human Services Department Secretary Xavier Becerra on a tour of facilities in a bid to secure funding for the hospital’s emergency department.\n\n49.

Katrina Armstrong\n\nCEO, Columbia University Irving Medical Center\n\nDr. Katrina Armstrong has had a full plate since her appointment last year as CEO of Columbia’s prestigious medical center, where she also pulls double duty as dean of its Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons.

Louis Shapiro & Bryan Kelly\n\nCEO; President and Surgeon-in-Chief, Hospital for Special Surgery\n\nThe Hospital for Special Surgery is a world-class musculoskeletal health medical center.

The school has partnered with Baruch College to guarantee enrollment for students transferring into Baruch’s Zicklin School of Business if certain academic requirements are met.\n\n59. Laura Rosenbury\n\nPresident, Barnard College\n\nWith Sian Beilock departing Morningside Heights for Dartmouth College – and taking former Bill de Blasio chief of staff Emma Wolfe with her – Barnard College looked south for its new president.

Javits Convention Center\n\nThe Javis Center played a huge role at the COVID-19 pandemic’s height. By late March 2020, it had transformed from a mass exhibition hall into New York’s medical station, where 1,000 beds were set up to help overburdened hospitals. The Javits Center lost $200 million in revenue from canceled events, but CEO Alan Steel and his team are working to draw more clients back to the recently expanded venue – and have already closed a deal to host Anthony Scaramucci’s SALT conference in September. Related Companies’ casino proposal for adjacent Hudson Yards would bring a 1,700-room hotel to the neighborhood.\n\n61. Eva Moskowitz\n\nFounder and CEO, Success Academy Charter Schools\n\nEva Moskowitz’s charter schools were caught in the crossfire of budget battles over the state’s regional caps, which Gov. Kathy Hochul had pushed to eliminate in order to facilitate the opening of more charter schools in New York City.

But that won’t thwart Moskowitz from growing her academic empire, as Success Academy Charter Schools plans to double its enrollment through a $25 million donation from Citadel founder Ken Griffin.\n\n62. George Fontas\n\nFounder and CEO, Fontas Advisors\n\nA native of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, George Fontas is the founder and head of government relations firm Fontas Advisors, which boasts clients such as LeFrak and Intel.

James Dolan\n\nExecutive Chair and CEO, Madison Square Garden Entertainment Corp.\n\nJames Dolan is no stranger to controversy. The businessperson has garnered a combative reputation after using facial recognition tech at Madison Square Garden to ban his adversaries – everyone from irate Knicks fans to the lawyers representing his legal foes – from the famous venue. The iconic venue now faces scrutiny over the tech’s legality at a time when Dolan is negotiating with New York City officials over the Garden’s future. The city will renew the Garden’s permit if they cooperate with plans about the future of Penn Station.\n\n67. Seth Pinsky\n\nCEO, 92NY\n\nManhattan’s 92nd Street Y has a compelling history: evolving from a Young Men’s Hebrew Association where newly arrived Jewish immigrants connected and became part of New York’s social fabric to a community space for all New Yorkers to participate in a myriad of arts programs and events. The space – rebranded as 92NY under CEO Seth Pinsky – is undergoing a major $200 million face-lift set to be completed in time for the organization’s 150th anniversary next year.

Gigi Li\n\nVice President, New York City Economic Development Corp.\n\nBefore arriving at the New York City Economic Development Corp., Gigi Li was a counselor and a domestic violence advocate. She dove into politics, first as chief of staff to New York City Council Member Margaret Chin in Chinatown before making an unsuccessful bid to succeed her boss following Chin’s exit from the council. Li, whose family is from Hong Kong, went back into government at NYCEDC, where she oversees engagement and outreach efforts for Manhattan projects like the $1.6 billion life sciences development of SPARC Kips Bay.\n\n94. Marie Boster\n\nPresident, Fifth Avenue Association\n\nLuxury retailers were not immune to hemorrhaging during the COVID-19 outbreak, and no place was that clearer than Fifth Avenue. By 2021, 32 storefronts were emptied out on Manhattan’s luxury row. Marie Boster, the new president of the Fifth Avenue Association, said the pandemic showed how essential luxury retailers are to New York’s economy – and some believe their rebound may be the boost needed for economic recovery. The Fifth Avenue Association is part of the team working with New York City Mayor Eric Adams to reimagine the future of the world-famous luxury retail hub.\n\n95. Blair Duncan\n\nPresident and CEO, Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone Development Corp.\n\nBlair Duncan is a seasoned economic development executive with 20 years of experience under his belt. He first joined the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone Development Corp. as a general counsel before rising through its ranks. The neighborhood has seen $1 billion in private investments and nearly 10,000 jobs created thanks to the organization’s work. Previously, Duncan held senior roles at HSBC and Merrill Lynch.\n\n96. Damon LoSchiavo\n\nVice President, Customer Success and Implementation, T-Mobile\n\nA former AT&T executive, Damon LoSchiavo now serves as T-Mobile’s vice president of customer success and implementation. But running a telecom behemoth isn’t without hiccups: T-Mobile had multiple data breaches and a nationwide network outage this year. Still, T-Mobile continues to expand with its acquisition of Ka’ena Corp. and subsidiaries, which includes actor Ryan Reynolds’ Mint Mobile, and fiber services in New York with Pilot Fiber, a company that already serves fiber broadband to more than 700 New York City buildings.\n\n97. Jessie Lee\n\nManaging Director, Renaissance Economic Development Corp.\n\nA former bank analyst, Jessie Lee made the career shift to work in community economic development over two decades ago. Renaissance Economic Development Corp. was selected as one of New York City’s eight lending partners to distribute $75 million in low-interest capital to hundreds of New York’s small businesses. This year, Lee’s organization was recognized by the federal Community Development Financial Institutions Fund for its community impact and launched a second application cohort for its six-month mentorship program in digital marketing for small-business entrepreneurs.\n\n98. Noah A. Rosenblum\n\nAssistant Professor of Law, New York University School of Law\n\nLaw professors don’t normally end up on political power lists, but New York politics is anything but normal. New York University School of Law’s Noah A. Rosenblum was among those spearheading public opposition against Gov. Kathy Hochul’s controversial nomination of Hector LaSalle to be the state’s chief judge. Rosenblum had previously tried to stop another nomination by former Gov. Andrew Cuomo to the state Court of Appeals, a campaign that failed but led Rosenblum to build a rapport with Democratic lawmakers intent on keeping an eye on New York’s courts. When Rosenblum isn’t helping make New York legal history, he is a frequent commentator on constitutional law and legal history.\n\n99. Shirley McKinney\n\nSuperintendent of Manhattan Sites, National Park Service\n\nShirley McKinney accompanied Vice President Kamala Harris during her June visit to the Stonewall National Monument, a visit Harris made amid attacks in other states on LGBTQ+ rights. McKinney was crucial in facilitating the agreement which led to the Stonewall’s planned new visitors center. As superintendent of Manhattan sites, McKinney stewards a wide array of National Park Service sites in Manhattan including, Liberty Island, Federal Hall and Hamilton Grange National Memorial, Alexander Hamilton’s former abode.\n\n100. John Tuttle\n\nVice Chair; President, New York Stock Exchange; NYSE Institute\n\nThe 1-year-old NYSE Institute is the thought leadership arm of the New York Stock Exchange. John Tuttle was promoted from NYSE chief commercial officer to lead the institute as it promotes commerce in the U.S. and abroad. Tuttle, a former U.S. Department of State staffer, could be leaving New York to run as a Republican for U.S. Senate in his native Michigan. Tuttle would be following in the footsteps of former Georgia Republican U.S. Sen. Kelly Loeffler, the wife of his boss, Jeffrey Sprecher, the CEO of NYSE’s parent company."
