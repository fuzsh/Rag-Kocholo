        "text": "How \"charitable\" foundations kill babies, and what we can do about it.\n\nby Lynn K. Murphy\n\nAbortion is the leading cause of death in the United States, causing 46% of all deaths. Abortion lowers the average life expectancy from 75 years to 40. One baby is killed by abortion for every three who are conceived.[1]\n\nYet annually, American foundations dole out millions of dollars to organizations which advocate abortion, litigate to keep it legal, or kill babies directly. Foundations dole out additional millions to provide sex education, which also leads to killed babies.\n\nResearch which is verifiable from \"The Foundation Grants Index\" shows a general rise in grant money given for abortion and sex education. This money goes from U.S. foundations to other organizations based in the U.S.:\n\nYear Dollars Given 1987 $14,700,000 1988 18,600,000 1989 29,100,000 1990 22,200,000 1991 not available\n\nThese figures would be approximately doubled if grants from U.S. foundations to organizations based elsewhere throughout the world were included. In the text which follows, only grants from U.S. foundations to U.S. organizations will be discussed.\n\nWho gave, and how much?\n\nIn 1990, 115 foundations each gave at least one $10,000 grant to pro-death organizations. Because of space limitations, they cannot all be listed, but the accompanying chart shows the 36 top givers--those that gave $100,000 or more in 1990.\n\nSince 115 foundations gave about $22,000,000 in 1990, the average foundation examined in this study gave about $191,000. This does not mean $191,000 per grant, however; these foundations made a total of 289 grants. Thus, the average grant size was about $76,500.\n\nThe Ford Foundation was the biggest killer, and The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation was second. The Ford Foundation is headquartered at 320 East 43rd St., New York, N.Y., 10017. The Hewlett Foundation (like the Packard one, ninth on our list) comes from a founder of the Hewlett-Packard Company, now famous for its laser printers. The Hewlett offices are at 525 Middlefield Rd., suite 200, Menlo Park, CA, 94025.\n\nRank Foundation Name Donation 1 The Ford Foundation $4,268,000 2 The Wm. & Flora Hewlett Foundation 2,640,000 3 The William Penn Foundation 1,715,819 4 The Harry & Grace Steele Foundation 975,000 5 The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation 932,666 6 Robert Sterling Clark Foundation, Inc. 820,000 7 Wallace Genetic Foundation, Inc. 575,000 8 Jessie Smith Noyes Foundation, Inc. 575,000 9 The David & Lucille Packard Foundation 570,100 10 Buffett Foundation 553,779 11 The Pew Charitable Trusts 500,000 12 Public Welfare Foundation 455,800 13 The James Irvine Foundation 445,000 14 The George Gund Foundation 405,000 15 The Minneapolis Foundation 338,050 16 The Rockefeller Foundation 330,000 17 The Educational Foundation of America 270,000 18 General Service Foundation 262,000 19 Carnegie Corporation of New York 246,000 20 Horace W.

In 1990, they had 99 killing centers, admitted to killing (my word) 121,000 babies (my word), and referred another 100,000 for painful destruction (my words).\n\nPro-life organizations, which counsel for more choices than do \"pro-choice\" organizations, received foundation grant money totaling $164,000 in 1990. This is 1/135th as much as the death-choice agencies received.\n\nSome grant descriptions\n\nThe present writer's source of information, the \"Foundation Grants Index,\" describes the reasons most of the grants were given. Very few were for abstinence sex education. Here are some of the more typical and offensive reasons:\n\n$100,000 to Planned Parenthood for prenatal services.\n\n$200,000 to Planned Parenthood for operating support.\n\n$135,000 to Planned Parenthood for general support.\n\n$250,000 to Planned Parenthood for a building campaign (to house more killing).\n\n$25,000 to the National Abortion Rights Action League for public education on the importance of access to legal abortion, and for training speakers and community leaders, to develop pro-choice spokespeople and organizers.\n\n$100,000 to the American Civil Liberties Union for litigation and advocacy efforts to defend citizens' rights to family planning services and legal abortion.\n\n$100,000 to Planned Parenthood for public education, litigation and advocacy efforts toward defending and strengthening the Title X federal family planning program.\n\n$200,000 to Planned Parenthood for reducing adolescent pregnancies, preserving individual reproductive rights, preventing violence and harassments at clinics, strengthening international family planning and providing reproductive health education and services for teenagers and poor.\n\n$150,000 to the American Civil Liberties Union for its Reproductive Freedom Project.\n\n$625,000 to the American Civil Liberties Union for litigation and public education aimed at preserving women's access to comprehensive reproductive health services, particularly for low-income women and teenagers.\n\n$625,000 to the American Civil Liberties Union for a supplement to the above grant.\n\n$375,000 to the National Organization for Women as a supplement to an organization working to advance women's legal rights.\n\n$650,000 to the National Organization for Women as a supplement to the same purpose (women's legal rights).\n\n$1,500,000 to the Alan Guttmacher Institute as a supplement for research and public policy programs on reproductive health, maternity care, sex education, teen pregnancy prevention and contraceptive choice.\n\n$50,000 to the Legal Clearinghouse, which assists member groups in pursuing legal remedies to \"harassment and violence\" aimed at pro-abortion organizations and abortion providers.\n\nIs the reader offended by that last one? I certainly am. Pro-lifers don't practice violence. We try to stop it. These foundations are funding atrocities--wholesale violence against millions of unborn babies and mothers.\n\nSex-ed/abortion connection\n\nEarlier, it was intimated that sex education kills babies, too. These are some of the reasons:\n\n(1) Sex education often aggressively teaches children to be loose, promiscuous and sexually active.\n\n(2) Sex education encourages the use of birth-control devices. Intrauterine Devices (IUDs) always work by killing a fertilized egg, i.e., a human being. Birth control pills often work by preventing the embryos from implanting.\n\n(3) Often birth control devices are not used. Often birth control devices fail. The very high level of sexual activity caused by teaching promiscuity therefore causes additional pregnancies.\n\n(4) Sex education generally promotes abortion as a desirable alternative to pregnancy. Often, other alternatives are not even mentioned.\n\n(5) Sex education fools students and parents into thinking that 'pregnancy prevention' only means preventing pregnancy from beginning. But it also means preventing it from continuing i.e., it means abortion.\n\nThose who doubt that sex education increases the abortion rate should take the word of the abortion advocates.\n\nIn a report on sex education programs made to the U.S. House Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families, it was noted that pregnancy and abortion rates are higher among teens who participated in family planning programs. Those states which spent the most on family planning showed the largest increase in abortions and births out of wedlock. Those which didn't participate in these programs had lower rates. States which emphasized sex education programs found that abortion, not contraception, was reducing births among teens.[2]\n\nThese points are confirmed by authoritative pro-abortionists. For instance, pro-abortion researcher Malcolm Potts says, \". . .those who use contraception are more likely than those who do not to resort to induced abortion . . .\"[3]\n\nSex researcher Alfred Kinsey wrote that \". . .we have found the highest frequency of induced (deliberate) abortion in the group which, in general, most frequently uses contraceptives.\"[4]\n\nThe former President of Planned Parenthood, Dr. Alan Guttmacher said, \"We find that when an abortion is easily obtainable, contraception is neither actively nor diligently used . . . there would be no reward for the woman who practices effective contraception . . . Abortion on demand relieves the husband of all possible responsibility; he simply becomes a coital animal.\"[5]\n\nDr. Guttmacher later said (after Roe v. Wade was decided), \"Then how can the Supreme Court decision be absolutely secured? The answer to winning the battle for elective abortion once and for all is sex education.\"[6]\n\nHow YOU Can Reduce the Killing\n\nThe \"charitable\" foundations that are financing the killing of babies and otherwise ruining our children's lives are found all over the United States. Very likely, there is one or more in your region. This is what you can do to stop them:\n\nPray.\n\nMail educational material to all pro-death foundations and to their boards of directors.\n\nFind out how the directors are chosen, and support a pro-life nominee.\n\nGet on the board of directors yourself to provide a pro-life vote.\n\nPicket the foundations.\n\nBlockade the foundations.\n\nRemember: the average foundation that dabbled in pro-death causes gave away $191,000, which can kill a lot of babies. Often, the board of director's decision to finance killing was made by a slender majority, even a majority of one. If YOU don't tell that person why he or she should say NO to killing, who will?\n\nThose wanting more information on how to stop the flow of foundation money to organizations that kill and pervert children may call Lynn Murphy at (510) 676-2929 (Pacific Time).\n\nENDNOTES\n\n1. According to \"Accident Facts, 1986,\" by the National Safety Council (which got its data from the National Center for Health Statistics of the Public Health Services Department of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services), the first six causes of death (excluding abortion) killed 1,626,157 people. They were, in order of greater to lesser killers: heart disease (765,490), cancer (469,376), stroke (149,643), accidents (95,277), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (76, 559), and pneumonia (69,812). They equal 1,626,157. Adding all other non-abortion deaths brings the total to 2,105,361.\n\nSince the abortion deaths are approximately 1,800,000 per year (including illegal, unreported abortions), they are more than the next six causes of death combined. The figure of 46% is found as follows: Actual total deaths are 1,800,000 + 2,105,361 = 3,905,361. 1,800,000/3,905,361 x 100 = 46.1%.\n\nLowering life expectancy from 75 to 40 is found as follows:\n\nIn a given year, the number of years that 2,105,361 people had lived to age 75 is 2,105,361 x 75 = 157,902, 075. In a given year, the number of years the preborn babies had lived outside the womb is 1,800,000 x 0 = 0. The total number of these (people times years) is 157,902,075 + 0 = 157, 902,075. The total number of people dying is, from previous paragraph, 3, 905,361. Therefore, the life expectancy is (157,902,075 people-years)/(3,905, 361 people) = 40.4 years per person.\n\n2. \"The Forum,\" Nov., 1991, p. 3. The Forum's address is P.O.
