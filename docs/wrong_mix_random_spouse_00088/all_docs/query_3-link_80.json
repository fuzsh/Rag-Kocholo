        "text": "BBC EastEnders fans have rushed to gush over Jessie Wallace's \"beautiful picture\" with her fiance. EastEnders star Jessie, 51, best known for playing Kat Slater, shared a loved-up selfie with rarely-seen Justin Gallwey on Instagram.\n\nJessie gazed happily at the camera as Justin caught the snap. \"Beautiful people,\" replied Lee. James Bye, the BBC Strictly Come Dancing and EastEnders star, replied: \"A young Marlon Brando… Justin… not you Jess.\" Heather Peace said: \"Gorgeous pic of you both.\"\n\nCaroline wrote: \"Beaut pic.\" Natalie Cassidy replied: \"Beautiful pic.\" James Farrar said: \"LOVELY.\" Emily Cappell said: \"Lovely photo.\" Gazza Jord said: \"That is a gorge photo @jessie.wallace_official.\" Kate wrote: \"Love that smile of yours gal keep it up xxx.\"\n\nREAD MORE Met Office and BBC announce final hot weather of year and confirm exact dates\n\nWendy Sloan said: \"Beautiful picture, the happiness is real\" Oisin Stack said: \"So great to see you so happy !!\" Nicola Lloyd wrote: \"Beautiful.\" It comes after Jessie sparked speculation her engagement with Justin is off - after she was spotted out and about without her engagement ring.\n\nHowever, a close friend of Jessie said: \"Jessie simply popped out without her ring on, as she often does if she's working as she obviously can't wear it whilst filming, it's nothing more than that, they're very much together.\" The engaged couple have been together for at least a year.\n\nIn 2004, Jessie began dating cop David Morgan after he accompanied her to court when she was facing drink driving charges. The couple welcomed a daughter the same year but split in 2005. She then began a relationship with catering manager Vincent Morse and the pair became engaged after three months of dating - but called things off before the nuptials.\n\nLast year she became a grandmother after Tallulah gave birth to a baby boy. Sharing a black and white image of the new arrival in a since-deleted post, Wallace wrote: “Welcome to the world, my grandson SJ. You are loved, cherished and adored.”"
