        "text": "EASTENDERS legend Jessie Wallace has undergone surgery after struggling for years with ‘excruciating pain’.\n\nThe 52-year-old surprised fans when she revealed she had her foot operated on and shared a snap of herself bandaged up.\n\nJessie, who added a series of high heel emojis, told her followers: “Thank you RNOHT for my Silastic Arthroplasty. After years of excruciating pain I am FREE!.”\n\nThe surgical procedure replaces some or all of a joints in her feet with an artificial joint, which in Jessie’s case is made from rubber.\n\nShe was inundated with supportive messages from fans wishing her well.\n\nHer co-star Shane Richie couldn’t resist making a cheeky comment, joking: “After all our years together I never knew that all your piggies literally f**ked off to the market!”\n\nJessie’s character in EastEnders – Kat Slater – is well known for always wearing high heels.\n\nIt comes just days after she shared a rare snap of her fiancé Justin Gallwey and branded him ‘her love’.\n\nThe couple are thought to be gearing up to tie the knot this year, having known each other since they were teenagers.\n\nLast year, a source said: “Jessie is over-the-moon about her engagement and is starting to put plans in place for her wedding.\n\n“At the moment it is looking like early next year in the UK and there could be a possible magazine deal in the works.\n\n“Naturally she will have some of her EastEnders co-stars there, Shane of course.\n\n“It is quite funny that when she ties the knot, Jessie will have Shane there as their characters have walked down the aisle twice.\n\n“Others likely to get an invite include Natalie Cassidy who is a friend of Jessie's and Emma Barton.\n\n“It is a really special time for her and everyone is incredibly happy for Jessie.”"
