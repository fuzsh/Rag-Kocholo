His research links natural and social science with innovation and governance to address dynamic coastal conservation challenges of the 21st century. Senko works with multiple stakeholders in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans to develop, test, and implement innovative approaches that protect sea turtles and other vulnerable marine megafauna while ensuring coastal livelihoods. His research has been published in leading biology, conservation, fisheries, social science, and policy journals as well as featured in CNN, The New York Times, Reuters, National Geographic, Smithsonian Magazine, The Economist, NPR, The Guardian, BBC News, USA Today, Bloomberg, Forbes, Nature, Science, and other major outlets. A winner of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Theodore Roosevelt Genius Prize, Senko is a member of the IUCN Marine Turtle Specialist Group and consults internationally on fisheries sustainability and sea turtle conservation. He majored in fisheries and wildlife sciences at the University of Connecticut, received his master's in wildlife ecology and conservation from the University of Florida, and earned his Ph.D. in biology from Arizona State University.\n\nEducation\n\nPhD, Biology, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ\n\nMSc, Wildlife Ecology and Conservation, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL\n\nBSc, Fisheries and Wildlife Sciences, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT\n\nVideo\n\nResearch Website URL\n\nResearch Interests\n\nApplied marine ecology and conservation; fisheries and seafood sustainability; conservation technology and innovation; marine megafauna ecology and conservation (especially sea turtles); animal behavior, sensory ecology, and movements; community-based conservation; human dimensions of conservation; participatory learning; social responsibility\n\nResearch Group\n\nThe Senko Lab for Sea Turtle Conservation and Bycatch Innovation trains the next generation of conservation leaders while developing and testing innovative approaches that protect sea turtles and other vulnerable marine megafauna while ensuring coastal livelihoods. We conduct field and laboratory-based research projects in the following Pacific and Atlantic Ocean regions:\n\nPacific Mexico: We partner with fisher leaders in Baja California Sur, Jalisco, and Sinaloa Mexico to co-develop responsible fishing solutions that reduce bycatch of sea turtles, sharks, and crocodiles while maintaining coastal livelihoods, including developing and testing new fishing gear innovation. Additionally, we study the human dimensions of bycatch innovation and coastal fisheries sustainability.\n\nNorth Carolina, USA: Our research in Core Sound, NC tests sensory-based sea turtle and shark bycatch reduction technologies in coastal pound net fisheries, while assessing environmental factors that lead to sea turtle and other non-target species bycatch in NC gillnet and pound net fisheries.\n\nTrinidad and Tobago: Our research at this field site, which supports the world’s largest and most dense leatherback turtle nesting beach, examines how density dependence affects leatherback hatchling production. This research has important conservation implications for leatherback turtles at both regional and global scales.\n\nSt. Lucie Nuclear Power Plant, Jensen Beach, Florida, USA: Our research at this unique study site assesses the behavioral responses of sea turtles to sensory cues, fishing gear, and bycatch reduction technologies. Due to the large number of sea turtles captured at the St. Lucie Power Plant and its facility with large entrainment canals and tanks, this site allows us to conduct controlled trials quickly and efficiently. By having a detailed understanding of sea turtle behavior in relation to fishery hazards and deterrents, our experimental approach at this unique site has the potential to contribute to “fine tuning” of bycatch innovation.\n\nPublications\n\nCollaborators: ‡international, #domestic, **undergraduate student mentored, *graduate student mentored, +fisher/citizen scientist\n\nYochum N, Karlsen J, Senko JF, #Wang JH, Melli V, Luca Geraci M, Utne-Palm AC, Breen M, Bayse SM, Somerville J, Hermann A, Edridge A, Mackenze EK, Ljungberg P, Chladek J, Opstal MV, Watson D, Oliver M, Lomeli M (In press, 2024) Guidelines for evaluating artificial light to mitigate unwanted fisheries bycatch.
