        "text": "Thriving Leaders, Thriving Schools: Policies for Effective School Leader Preparation\n\nPrincipals play a key role in K–12 schools, shaping student learning and teacher working conditions in ways that impact teacher effectiveness and retention as well as student achievement. Research shows that high-quality preparation and professional development can strengthen these impacts, a critical need in this moment when addressing staff shortages and learning recovery are at the forefront of education agendas. Principals’ access to high-quality preparation and professional development has improved over the last two decades, but there is still substantial work ahead before all principals have ready access to consistent, high-quality learning opportunities.\n\nSo how can preparation programs support aspiring and current school leaders to create schools in which students and teachers thrive?\n\nThe fourth annual EdPrepLab Policy Summit focused on preparing and developing effective school leaders for school transformation. This year’s virtual summit explored effective policy efforts that can help increase access to high-quality, comprehensive school leader preparation and development programs. Leading experts on educator preparation policy and practice shared examples and discuss research-based approaches to school leader preparation.\n\nFeatured Speakers\n\nDanny Carlson, Chief of Staff, Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, U.S. Department of Education\n\nRebecca Cheung, Assistant Dean, University of California, Berkeley School of Education Leadership Development programs\n\nLinda Darling-Hammond, President and CEO, Learning Policy Institute; Charles E. Ducommun Professor of Education Emeritus, Stanford University\n\nAman Dhanda, Chief Engagement Officer, National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP)\n\nWill Jordan, Research Officer, The Wallace Foundation (moderator)\n\nMarjorie Wechsler, Principal Research Manager, Learning Policy Institute\n\nEdPrepLab is supported by the Carnegie Corporation of New York, Ibis Group, Skyline Foundation, Spencer Foundation, W.
