        "text": "WALLACE, James Corteen (Jim)\n\nPassed away unexpectedly at the age of 70 on September 10, 2013 at his home in Coquitlam, B.C. James was born in Victoria to James and Jessie Wallace on April 2, 1943 and attended school in North Burnaby. He enjoyed a diverse career in the millwork industry beginning at Weldwood Canada and culminating in his ownership of a window manufacturing company, eventually retiring from a fourteen year career in automotive finance. James is survived by his two children, Noel Wallace (Alison) and Carla Emery (Colin), their mother Eleanor Wallace, and his three grandchildren, Makaela, Riley and Payton Emery, as well as siblings, Jeanne, Joyce, Jerry and Jeffrey. He will always be remembered by all who knew him as an outgoing, charismatic and fun loving individual. A celebration of his life will be held on September 21, 2013 in the Social Room at 3070 Guildford Way, Coquitlam, from 11:30 am to 3:00 pm. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made in memory of James Wallace to the Alzheimer Society of B.C. and/or B.C. Heart and Stroke Foundation.\n\nPublished online September 14, 2013\n\nPlant a Living Memorial\n\nIn Memory of JamesHow does it work?\n\nSend Flowers: When Is the Ordering Deadline?\n\nNext-Day Delivery\n\nANY DAY OF THE WEEK\n\nOrder any time up till the day before\n\nSame-Day Delivery\n\nMON-FRI Order by 2:00PM\n\nSAT & SUN Order by noon\n\nMorning Delivery\n\nTUES-SAT Order by 3:00PM\n\nThe day before\n\nSAT & SUN Order by Saturday\n\nNote: These are general guidelines; some florists may not be able to operate within these timelines.
