A third wrote, 'Love that smile of yours gal keep it up xxx'\n\nEven her EastEnders co-stars joined the chorus of admiration. Balvinder Sopal, who portrays Suki Panesar, described them as 'Beautiful people.'\n\nEarlier this year, The Sun on Sunday reported the news of their engagement, stating that the couple were set to tie the knot after a year of dating.\n\nA close source told the outlet, 'Jessie has been proudly wearing the ring.'\n\nFurther confirmation came from Jessie herself as she shared a sunny snapshot of her and her future husband, captioned 'My fiancé and moi.'\n\nFans were ecstatic, with one writing, 'Congratulations to you both you suit happy it beams out of you.'"
