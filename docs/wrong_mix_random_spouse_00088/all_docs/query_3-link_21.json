But he made an enemy of Phil Mitchell in the process.\n\nSpeaking about returning to EastEnders, Shane Richie said: “It’s an absolute honour and privilege to be asked back to my TV home of Albert Square.\n\n“I’m looking forward to catching up with some old castmates and meeting some new ones.\n\n“The new exec producer Chris Clenshaw has been instrumental in wanting to bring Alfie Moon back with some wonderful storylines… and who am I to say no? I can’t wait.”\n\nWant more spoilers from EastEnders?
