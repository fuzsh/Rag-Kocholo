        "text": "Founder & Director; Instructor in Ballet\n\nNatalia Alonzo-Brillante, was born in Bushwick, Brooklyn and began her journey with dance at the age of three. Her background includes extensive training in classical ballet, modern dance, and Flamenco. Natalia studied ballet with the late David Howard, Nancy Bielski, Marina Stavitskya, Michael Vernon, and Anna Lederfeind, among others. She studied contemporary dance at the Martha Graham School and has spent over 30 years of her career learning and performing the technique and repertoire of Isadora Duncan. Natalia trained in flamenco and classical Spanish dance with the late Jose Molina, Mariano Parra, and Liliana Morales. After graduating high school Natalia continued her professional training at the Martha Graham School of Contemporary Dance while completing a BA in foreign languages at Hunter College. Upon completion of her dance studies, she was invited to partake in the premier historic reconstruction of Martha Graham’s 1934 ballet “Panorama” in which she performed with the Graham Company for two consecutive seasons at New York’s City Center as well as the Spoleto Festivals in the United States and Europe. Natalia danced with the Metropolitan Opera Ballet at Lincoln Center for 5 years in productions of La Traviata, Turandot, Tannhauser, I Vespri Siciliano, and Carmen. Her performing career also includes work with numerous local dance companies including Dances by Isadora, Catherine Gallant Dance, The American Bolero Dance Company, Danzas Espanolas, the Off-Broadway production “Flamenco Extravaganza” and Ballet Fiesta Mexicana, among others.

She began teaching in 1994 at Ballet Academy East and Discovery Programs in NYC. In 1996, at the age of 25, she accomplished her childhood dream of opening American Youth Dance Theater. Since then, the school has undergone four expansions and continues to grow. Over the years, Natalia’s greatest joy as a teacher has been seeing children of all ages, backgrounds, and levels of ability discover the gift of self-expression through dance and music. It has been a special and joyful experience to witness students growing from the toddler programs all the way through high school graduation, and seeing how involvement in the arts helps children develop into disciplined and dedicated young adults with a strong sense of respect for self and others. Along with directing American Youth Dance Theater, Natalia has also guest taught and conducted multicultural dance performances and lecture demonstrations in public and private schools throughout New York City through programs including Young Audiences and Arts Connection. Natalia’s favorite movie is the Japanese version of “Shall We Dance?” because it is about ordinary people discovering the joy of movement. She believes that if we all spent a little more time dancing, the world would be a happier place!\n\nFun Fact: My favorite hobby is gardening.\n\nGlobal Footprint: Natalia is one of the co-founders of the SFDS Social Justice/LGBTQ Alliance at St Frances de Sales Church in Manhattan, working to promote inclusion of all people who are born into or called to the Catholic community.

The Musical and The Turkeys Go on Strike, the equity showcase of MANIFESTO: The Diaghilev Project and the Merkin Concert Hall performance, When Broadway Went to Hollywood. Austin has also danced all around the city in productions at venues such as Steps on Broadway, Helen Mills Theater, and Manhattan Movement and Arts Center. He has been seen dancing on screen in some music videos and the feature film Bad Education.\n\nAustin’s choreography has been selected to perform in dance festivals like the Jazz Choreography Enterprise Dance Project, and awarded at dance competitions all around the country. He has choreographed several productions in NYC including The Drowsy Chaperone, The Addams Family, and A Chorus Line. He has also taught for several studios around the country and in the musical theatre department at Marymount Manhattan College, where he also received his degree in musical theatre.\n\nAustin uses his background in acting and fitness, along with his dance training to give his students the ability to not only grow in their understanding of their anatomy and become physically stronger, but also to explore emotion and storytelling through movement as well. He strives to give his students the tools to become confident in their abilities, to take risks in their explorations, and to find community and support in their classes. Austin encourages his students to take every opportunity they have to learn and grow as artists—to believe in themselves and never waste a moment!\n\nFun Fact: As a fitness instructor, Austin was featured training members of the Real Housewives of New York for an episode on season 12 of the hit show.\n\nGlobal Footprint: \"Recently, many of our eyes have been opened to the blatant and disturbing amount of hate and injustice that has always been present in our country and is still running rampant. As an educator, I have always felt a responsibility and necessity to spread a message of equality and acceptance in my classrooms, but now, more than ever, I feel there is a dire need to bring these topics to the forefront of every lesson. I am an avid supporter of Black Lives Matter and fighting to bring justice for the BIPOC community that has not had the same protection and opportunities that the majority of us have been given. I believe in the power of educating ourselves and others to understand and fight against the systemic issues that have held our country back towards ever reaching equity. I pledge to do my part in staying informed and educated, speaking up when necessary, using my privilege to elevate others, and spreading knowledge in order to come closer to having justice for all.\"\n\nInstructor in Pre-Ballet, Broadway Jazz, and Tap\n\nTaylor Wallace is a performer, choreographer, and teaching artist based in NYC.

Some of her past credits include Kiss Me, Kate, A Chorus Line, Once Upon A Mattress, and Zelda: An American Love Story. Taylor has also worked as a dancer on the set of the 2017 film Hello Again.\n\nGrowing up, Taylor’s mom would always tell her to “let her light shine” and “follow her joy”. Those words guided her approach to every performance, audition, or class: always bring a grateful heart and determined mind. She learned that her light shines the brightest when embracing the “joy” of doing what she loves, which is why she strives to never take dance for granted—Taylor knows how lucky we are as dancers to exercise our bodies in demanding and dynamic ways. This mentality causes her to yearn to learn more and constantly set new goals for herself.\n\nWhen it comes to working with other dancers, her mission is to bring the spark and energy from her current and past experiences to each class—creating magic, encouraging artistry and boosting enthusiasm in all the dancers she works with.\n\nA note from Taylor: I was lucky to have inspiration growing up, and now I love to inspire others to shine their own light and follow their joy. I will always have a huge smile on my face and a sunny attitude while teaching. How could I not?! Loving my job as much as I do allows me to view it not as work, but as another opportunity to create something beautiful.\n\nFun Fact: In elementary school, I used to wear big fancy party dresses; I never understood why the other kids in my class were not getting dressed up for school too, but it didn’t bother me; I loved getting dressed up. Fast forward to today and nothing has changed. Oscar Wilde once said, “you can never be overdressed or over-educated” I think he was on to something :)\n\nGlobal Footprint: We all want to leave this world a better place, which is why I am so passionate about being a teacher. My relationships with my students extends beyond teaching them how to dance. I aspire to cultivate self confident, loving, knowledgeable individuals who will embrace challenges with a positive outlook and fierce determination. I believe all children should be given the same chance to be inspired no matter their socioeconomic status and I will continue to fight for enriching and encouraging children's’ lives for the rest of mine.\n\nInstructor in Hip Hop\n\nKenny Smith, also known as KennyD is a Pittsburgh native with a strong infatuation for the arts.

During this time of pause, I have been able to meditate and reflect on how I better fit into my community. I have been enjoying connecting with my Crown Height community through their Mutual Aid program. I have been reminded that listening can be more valuable than speaking. That amplifying the voices of others, by way of platform, can be more important than all of us yelling at once.
