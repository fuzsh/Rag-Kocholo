        "text": "Apparently after a brief return in the New Year Kat will leave EastEnders permanently. If the Cockney lot don't want her I think she'd be a great asset to Coronation Street.\n\nI rewatched The Road to Coronation Street when it was repeated recently and she was a revelation, a magnetic performance as Pat Phoenix. I think she could create a modern take on an Elsie type, she has thar aura about her. I know some would be against her because of the strong EE connection but I think if she altered her hair colour and dropped the Cockney accent she'd be fine.\n\nI assume Kate Oates will be looking to bring in some new blood to freshen things up and Jessie Wallace has proven herself a fine actress outside of EE. Bringing in Michelle Collins flopped but Wallace is a better actress and conveys warmth and humour more naturally. I think she'd be a better fit.\n\n0"
