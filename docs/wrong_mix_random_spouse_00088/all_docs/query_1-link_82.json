        "text": "Alpha Chi Omega is a national women’s organization that enriches the lives of both its collegiate and alumnae members through lifetime opportunities for friendship, leadership, learning, and service.\n\nREAL. STRONG. WOMEN.\n\nThe purpose of Alpha Chi Omega, as stated in the Constitution, is “to encourage the true spirit of sisterhood, to develop through personal effort a high moral and mental standard, and to advance the appreciation and practice of fine arts among its members.” There are 131 chapters, from coast to coast, with nearly 12,000 collegiate members giving back to their community, developing life-long learning habits, and making friends that will last a lifetime.\n\nThe members of Alpha Chi Omega are scholars, leaders, and work to serve others. They are involved in athletics, organize and lead numerous clubs, and are members of academic honor societies. Together, the members of Alpha Chi Omega are bonded by sisterhood. Sisterhood activities include, a fall retreat, both a winter and spring formal, numerous socials in cooperation with Greek life and various other organizations on campus, movie nights, dinners, and many other sisterhood activities.\n\nDomestic violence is both a national and a worldwide crisis. The consequences of domestic violence can cross generations and truly last a lifetime.\n\nDomestic Violence Awareness\n\nAlpha Chi Omega’s national philanthropy is Domestic Violence Awareness.\n\nThe national month of awareness is October, and this is our most active time of awareness and support of victims. Our chapter works hard to inform people of the often silenced violence that takes place so close to home. Awareness is key when it comes to Domestic Violence, which is why we partake in several endeavors to use our voices for the silenced.\n\nDuring October, we “Purple Out” campus with decorations, ribbons, and signs to get people asking. This is a great way for us to spread information and give people every day reminders as the walk about the campus. In the past, we have also had recruitment activities that entailed making care packages of toiletries and first aid materials for the women and children.\n\nWe also hold an annual Casino Night to raise money for the cause. Our Casino Night is a black-tie event, in which the sisters put together a mock casino. There are standard card games, a roulette table, cash bar, and poker chips by the cup! Our loving chapter sweethearts are the perfect gentleman running these tables, while our sisters sell chips, raffle tickets, assist guests, and man the silent auction. Our silent auction is an arrangement of many baskets all donated or sister created that are bid on. Highest bid gets the baskets and all the money goes to our cause. Each basket has a theme and many contain donations from the wonderful businesses in our very own Chestertown!\n\nAll money from our philanthropic fundraisers goes to Mid-Shore Council. MSCFV creates healthy opportunities to break the cycle of domestic violence through intervention and prevention by providing shelter, counseling, services and advocacy for victims and abusers.\n\nIn the spring, we try to hold awareness events to remind people that this happens year round, not just in October!! This spring, we are looking to join Soroptomists and hold an empowerment speaker and a Vigil for those affected by domestic violence. We are also working on bringing self-defense workshops to campus!\n\nAnd although not part of our national philanthropy, Alpha Chi Omega likes to service other needs in our community. To achieve this, we spend many hours at the local Humane Society volunteering. We also partake in adopting a highway for highway cleanup to better our environment. Lastly, our other major event in Cinderella’s Closet (also known as Gown Giveaway), in which we collect new or gently worn dresses and gowns to donate to a local high school for students who cannot afford their own. There is truly nothing more heart-warming then putting on dressing room boutique for these beautiful ladies and giving them the chance to have the magical night that we all fondly look back on.\n\nIf you would like to learn more about our philanthropy, check out the The Mid-Shore Council for Family Violence website.\n\nArthritis is the most common cause of disability in the USA. More than 350 million individuals with arthritis have severe limitations in function on a daily basis.\n\nArthritis Awareness\n\nAlpha Omicron Pi’s international philanthropy is Arthritis Research and the Juvenile Arthritis Foundation.\n\nOsteoarthritic, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, lupus and osteoporosis are just a few of the various types of arthritis and related conditions that are more prevalent in women. The term, “arthritis,” encompasses more than 100 diseases and conditions that affect the joints, the surrounding tissues and other connective tissues. This disease is the nation’s leading cause of disability. Since 1967, over 1.5 million dollars has been raised by AOII’s and donated through the Foundation to support the mission of conquering arthritis once and for all!\n\nArthritis effects nearly 70 million American adults, forty-one million of these adults are women and 300,000 are children. During 2017-2019, AOII Chapters and members raised $1,750,000 for the Arthritis Foundation for research and education!\n\nSigma Tau raises money each year for Arthritis through our “Pi in the Face” Fundraiser, Spike Out Arthritis events, and Blue Week!\n\nIf you would like to learn more about our philanthropy, check out the Arthritis Foundation website.\n\nQueen of the Roses 5K\n\nJasmine Dora Queen was an amazing sister who passed away in August 2008. She is missed greatly by every member of our chapter. The Sigma Tau Chapter decided to honor Jasmine by endowing a scholarship in her name through the AOII Foundation.\n\nWe were told that $20,000 had to be raised over 5 years to endow a scholarship. The Queen of the Roses 5K race was born to raise money for this scholarship. In the first year, we were able to put together an amazing event and raised an outstanding $12,000 with the help of the Washington College community. The Queen of the Roses 5K was a great success and a lot of fun! The event was even featured in our international magazine, To Dragma!\n\nThis fall we will be having an alumni luncheon with Jasmine’s family in honor of Jasmine and to help raise money for the Jasmine Queen scholarship. In the Spring, we will be having a flag football event for the community and Washington College students and faculty to come play. The proceeds of the event will go towards the Jasmine Queen scholarship.\n\nInternational History\n\nAlpha Omicron Pi is an international fraternity recognized by the National Panhellenic Council. It was founded on January 2, 1897 at Barnard College by four women, Helen St. Clair Mullan, Jessie Wallace Hughan, Elizabeth Heywood Wyman and Stella George Stern Perry, determined to make a society, which allowed them to maintain lifelong friendships. With their determination and dedication, the first chapter, Alpha, was founded.\n\nToday, Alpha Omicron Pi is an international women’s fraternity, with 189 collegiate chapters and 320 alumnae chapters in Canada and the U.S.A. Its international headquarters is located in Brentwood, Tennessee and it is a member group of the National Panhellenic Conference, which is the governing council of the 26 member women’s fraternities and sororities.\n\nThe object of the Fraternity shall be to encourage a spirit of Fraternity and love among its members; to stand at all times for character, dignity, scholarship, and college loyalty; to strive for and support the best interest of the colleges and universities in which chapters are installed, and in no way to disregard, injure, or sacrifice those interests for the sake of prestige or advancement of the Fraternity or any of its chapters.\n\nChapter History\n\nThe Sigma Tau chapter at Washington College was chartered on May 14, 1938, thus becoming the second NPC group on campus. 26 charter members were initiated by International President, Mary Dee Danielson Drummond (Alpha Phi).\n\nEleven years after its founding, Sigma Tau was awarded the Jessie Wallace Hughan Cup, which honors the top collegiate chapter for two years. We are also proud to claim Sally Wagaman (Sigma Tau), who served as International President of AOII from 2003-2005.\n\nOther Chapters in Maryland\n\nTheta Beta - Towson University\n\nPi Delta - University of Maryland\n\nThe Gamma Beta chapter of Zeta Tau Alpha strives to intensify friendship, foster the spirit of love, to make a difference in the lives of its fifty members and teach them the nobility of serving.\n\nSeek the Noblest\n\nThe Zeta Tau Alpha at Washington College prides itself in our strong sisterhood. A day never goes by without having a friendly conversation with at least one sister while on campus. Our sisterhood extends beyond our weekly chapter meetings, and we are always spending time together simply because we genuinely love one another. Our sisterhood sets us apart because we support one another not just as students, but as people. We want all of our sisters to be the best versions of themselves and we all help each other meet those goals. Also, many of our sisters are all involved in various organizations, athletics, and clubs across campus showing how ZTA likes to stay connected with its school community.\n\nSisterhood for ZTA sisters does not just end with activities, the sisters of ZTA are bonded in friendship, tradition and service which allows each one to grow making our world and campus a better place. While partnered with the NFL, Bright Pink, and the American Cancer Society, Gamma Beta’s service does not stop there.\n\nSisters participate in community events, volunteering at charities; helping with blood drives as well as other service events. The sisters of ZTA encourage you to take a look at their website link on the Washington College Site and leave a message on our message board and allow us to share with you our love for WAC and ZTA."
