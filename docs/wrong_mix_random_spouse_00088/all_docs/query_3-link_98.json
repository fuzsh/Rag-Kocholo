Featuring memorable music and lyrics by Grammy Award winner Sara Bareilles, the story centers on Jenna, a baker who dreams of escaping her job, small town and rocky marriage. Adapted from the 2007 film, it’s a satisfying celebration of friendship, motherhood and the magic of a homemade pie. A Muny and Midwest regional premiere.\n\nWaitress depicts title character Jenna’s story of liberation and transformation as she bakes her way through a rocky marriage, unplanned pregnancy and comical love affair with her OB-GYN. Jenna seeks escape by entering a pie contest, while a dynamic cast of diner colleagues work through their own quirky romances.\n\nRatings and age restrictions are not issued for The Muny’s professionally licensed shows, but we offer the following notes regarding content that may have a bearing on patron comfort.\n\nLanguage • The words shit, ass, hell and damn are each used many times. The word piss is used twice; bastard and hussy are each used once.\n\nSexual Innuendo • Many lines of dialogue and lyrics refer to sex, and sex is dramatized in several scenes.\n\nDrugs and Alcohol • Alcohol is mentioned or shown in a few instances.\n\nViolence • Jenna’s abusive husband has an outburst.\n\nMature Content • Unplanned pregnancy and marital infidelity are recurring themes. In one line of dialogue, Jenna’s doctor offers to refer her to a doctor who performs abortions."
