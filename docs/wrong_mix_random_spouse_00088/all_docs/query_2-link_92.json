        "text": "A\n\nAndrew F. & Mary H. Anderson Scholarship Endowment\n\nMary H. Anderson, who founded the Delta College Flute Choir in 1974, established this endowment in memory of her husband, Andrew F. Anderson. The Anderson Family has long connections to Delta College – Mr. Anderson’s father, Oscar, was a member of the “Committee of 300” (considered to be the College’s founders) and a Charter Member of the Delta College Board of Trustees, and his sister, Annette Diebel, served on the Board of Trustees from 1975 until 1993. The family also has strong connections to the automotive industry – Oscar Anderson started Northern Automotive – later renamed Northern Supply Company – an automotive parts company in Bay County and, upon his semi-retirement in 1962, his son became president and served until he passed away in 2000. Contributions from the Andersons also made possible the “Currents” sculpture on Delta College’s main campus, and created the Delta Sculpture Walk, in honor of the College's 50th anniversary in 2011.\n\nAthletic Scholarship Endowment\n\nFrom 1996-2014, the Delta College Foundation organized an annual Delta College Golf Classic. This event raised money for men's and women’s athletic scholarships and equipment needs. Although the event has been discontinued, the accumulated proceeds are held in an endowment that support Delta College's athletes.\n\nB\n\nMary Ann (McGregor) Badour Scholarship Endowment\n\nMary Ann (McGregor) Badour, a well-known realtor in the Saginaw area, opened Marshall Realty in 1972 and merged her business with Keller Williams Realty in Saginaw. She was born in Saginaw, and is the mother of one daughter, Leslie Ann Lowell. She believes in education and realizes the difference it can make in a person’s life. And, she is interested in helping area students achieve their dreams and reach their educational goals.\n\nJames W. & Joy A. Baker Scholarship Endowment\n\nJames W. Baker was a longtime attorney who joined his father’s law practice in 1951 with his brother, Oscar, and voluntarily left the firm in 1987 to promote better communication between African-Americans and whites. Joy A. Baker taught school in Bay City for more than 20 years before becoming the Bay City Public Schools' first female African-American administrator. She also taught as an adjunct faculty at Delta College. Mr. Baker passed away in 2003. Mrs. Baker passed away in 2012. The couple's longtime friends, Jack and Alice Wirt, established this scholarship endowment as a tribute to the Bakers.\n\nBarney and Gerry Ballor Family Scholarship Endowment\n\nBernard “Barney” and Geraldine “Gerry” Ballor were married on October 9, 1948 and were together for 61 years. Barney worked for Saginaw Steering Gear for 27 years, beginning as a junior draftsman and retiring as a senior plant engineer. Through his work, Barney supervised many co-operative education students from a variety of colleges, but he said that “bar none, the best students came from Delta College.” Gerry was known for her strong work ethic and worked as a secretary for the City of Bay City in the zoning and planning department. Barney and Gerry have two children, Doug and Karen, and are very proud of their educational and career successes. This scholarship supports a variety of academic majors including nursing, engineering and skilled trades. The Ballors had personal interactions with workers trained in all these areas over the years and find each to be a valuable career option for students to consider.\n\nBay City Central High School Class of 1941 Scholarship Endowment\n\nIn 1941, 550 students graduated from Bay City Central High School. December 7, 1941 – when Japanese planes attacked the U.S. Naval Base at Pearl Harbor and launched World War II – changed their course of life. After the war, many went on to college and became educators, businessmen, authors, doctors, dentists and musicians. They are very proud of their accomplishments, and established an endowment to help today’s students who are struggling to achieve their goals and dreams.\n\nElzie S. & Muriel D. Beaver Scholarship Endowment\n\nElzie S. and Muriel D. Beaver were very interested in young people and education. Mr. Beaver, who passed away in 1980, loved fishing, and later became quite adept as a gem cutter and woodworker. Mrs. Beaver, who passed away in 1996, was a fine pianist and a national honor recipient at Saginaw’s Arthur Hill High School. Following graduation, she worked for Basin Oil Company, where she met and later married Mr. Beaver. She also had the welfare of Delta students and their educational future in her plans, making provisions in her will to establish a scholarship endowment honoring her late husband's memory.\n\nEric “Q” Beckman Memorial Scholarship\n\nEric “Q” Beckman was an associate professor at Delta College where he was respected and much beloved by his colleagues and students, both in and outside of his economics classes. He inspired all who knew him to be the very best version of themselves and to follow their own path. Q came to Delta as an adjunct instructor and respected the way faculty and staff were invested in making Delta the kind of place where everyone was proud to work. He valued fellow adjuncts, and, after he became a professor, championed opportunities for them to participate in professional development. Eric adopted the nickname “Q” when he was working at Mt. Pleasant’s La Senorita restaurant during college and was responsible for changing the lettering on the sign that advertised the daily specials. He felt sorry for the letter Q because it never got used much, so he would leave it up in the corner of the board, and the letter – and the name it inspired – stuck. Q passed away unexpectedly on July 15, 2021. His mother and stepfather created this endowment to honor Eric’s passion for seeing others succeed – especially those who may not have previously viewed college as a possibility.\n\nLeonard & Esther Bergstein Scholarship Endowment\n\nLeonard and Esther Bergstein moved from Detroit to Midland in 1930 and established the Community Drug Stores. Both were extremely active in the community. Mr. Bergstein was elected as a trustee of Delta College as it was formed, and devoted the remainder of his life to furthering the planning, development and opening of the college. He passed away in 1964. Mrs. Bergstein passed away in 1974. The Bergsteins' son, Stuart, and daughter-in-law, Ruth Ann, established the endowment to honor the lives of their parents.\n\nDarrell R. Berry Scholarship Endowment\n\nIn 1969, Darrell Berry started teaching in the Technical Division at Delta College. During his 25 year career at Delta, Mr. Berry served as an instructor and rose through the ranks to become Dean of Occupational Education. Throughout his career, he never lost sight of the important contributions that blue collar workers and journeymen make to business and industry. He was an excellent teacher and mentor, and epitomized the \"spirit of cooperation\" and sought the best for Delta College. Mr. Berry passed away in 1994.\n\nAlfred J. Bladecki Scholarship\n\nMr. Bladecki was a long-time employee of Consumers Power Company. He started working for Consumers at the Bay City Division in 1950. After Mr. Bladecki’s death in 1978, his wife, Delight Bladecki, a member of Delta College’s nursing faculty, created this scholarship in his memory. Delight’s Delta College colleagues contributed to the scholarship fund, along with friends and relatives. This scholarship helps students in nursing clinicals achieve their dreams of working in the medical field.\n\nMartin & Emma Block Scholarship Endowment\n\nMartin and Emma (Spindler) Block were long-time Saginaw County business owners.
