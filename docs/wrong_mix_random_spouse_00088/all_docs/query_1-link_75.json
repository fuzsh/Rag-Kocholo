        "text": "Hawaii Community Foundation offers a wide range of funds to provide maximum flexibility to meet the philanthropic goals of our donors and the needs of our community. Five types of funds are included in the list below:\n\nUnrestricted Funds have the greatest potential to respond to new and emerging needs in our community. Donors of these funds give full discretion to Hawaii Community Foundation Board of Governors to authorize grants that provide the greatest impact.\n\nDonor Advised Funds are charitable vehicles that allow donors maximum flexibility to recommend grants to benefit the community. Donors are free to focus on the rewards of giving while the Hawaii Community Foundation manages the administrative details.\n\nDesignated Funds are endowed by individuals and organizations to ensure that their charities of choice continue. In each case contributors selected one or more nonprofit organizations to benefit from the grants for as long as the charities exist.\n\nField of Interest Funds are created by contributors who stipulate that grants be made in a particular field or to benefit a certain group of people. This type of fund assures the flexibility to adjust to future changes. The organizations or charities serving that field may change, merge, or cease to exist, but the need will continue.\n\nScholarship Funds are created by private foundations, individuals, businesses, and organizations to assist Hawaii residents in achieving their educational goals.\n\nHawaii Community Foundation is honored to be entrusted with these funds and deeply appreciates the donors whose generosity created them.
