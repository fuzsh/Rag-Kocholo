        "text": "“ In my family, I'm the pretty one. My eyes and my smile, my body. I mean, you should see me without a shirt on. It's kinda ridiculous. But my family is smart, driven, and crazy over-achievers. And they look like they're smart. They don't look like me, which has its perks. Except that my family treated me like I was pretty. They expected nothing from me, ever. Never pushed me, never thought to. So I had to push myself. Hard. ”\n\n— Jackson Avery\n\nJackson Avery is the former Head of Plastic Surgery and attending ENT at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital and was one of the staff members who joined from Mercy West Medical Center after the merger. He is also a former member of the board and the de facto board chairman. Jackson was married to April Kepner with whom he has a daughter and a deceased son. He relocated to Boston to take over the Catherine Fox Foundation and work towards achieving equity in medical care. A newly divorced April and their daughter, Harriet moved with him so he could continue being an active and present father. While in Boston, he and April rekindled their romance.\n\nHistory[]\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nJackson is the grandson of Dr. Harper Avery, one of the most famous surgeons in the country and the namesake of the prestigious Harper Avery Award. He grew up hearing about the nobility of being a surgeon at his grandfather's dinner table, which inspired him to become a surgeon. His family never pushed him academically, so he pushed himself; he didn't even tell his family that he had taken the MCAT until he aced it.\n\nNot much is known about Jackson's life before he became a surgeon, but it is known that although he looks up to his grandfather, he detests being compared to him. He also refuses to use his name in order to progress in his career. Jackson is no doubt a \"mama's boy\" and is extremely protective of the people he cares about – specifically April Kepner, whom he claims is his only remaining friend in Seattle.\n\nShooting at the Hospital[]\n\nDuring the shooting at the hospital, Jackson and Cristina performed emergency surgery on Derek Shepherd, saving his life. At one point during the surgery, grieving widower, Gary Clark held them at gunpoint. Jackson saved everyone’s lives by making it seem as though Derek had flatlined. This pleased Gary Clark and he was then convinced to leave them in peace.[1]\n\nBefore the shooting, Jackson was friends with fellow Mercy West resident, Charles Percy. Percy was killed during the shooting and this had a great impact on Jackson. For months following the shooting, he had nightmares about the event. He and April Kepner also moved into Meredith's house as both their friends had been killed and Meredith felt they needed support.[2]\n\nThere was later a shooting at a local college and Jackson, alongside Drs. Altman and Yang found out they were operating on the shooter. He refused to continue and walked out of the OR, likely a response to the Gary Clark shooting. However, he's later admonished by Alex, who reminds him that mass shooters are sick people with a family that still love them. After this, Jackson sits down with the shooter's mother and reassures her that her son was still alive.[3]\n\nRelationship with Lexie and The Plastics Posse[]\n\nAt the request of Mark, Jackson attempted to get close to Lexie as Mark wanted to find out if she was miserable without him. However, Lexie and Jackson actually grew closer to one another and eventually had sex in the shower, which marked the start of their relationship. Mark didn't want to let go of Lexie but eventually did so, though Jackson kept noticing that Lexie couldn't seem to get over him, despite her claims that she had. When Mark noticed Jackson's interest in and talent for plastic surgery, Jackson decided to pursue that specialty. However, he avoided surgery with Mark because of Lexie's lingering feelings for Mark. This bugged him and he decided to break up with Lexie. He offered her the chance to tell him that he shouldn't do it, but she couldn't bring herself to do so.\n\nJackson then dove into plastics and quickly formed The Plastics Posse with Mark, who was eager to teach him.\n\nAftermath of the Plane Crash and Owning the Hospital[]\n\nAfter Arizona, Derek, Meredith and Cristina sued Seattle Grace Mercy West because of the plane crash, the hospital was forced to pay out a multi-million dollar settlement. After Owen and Alana Cahill tried to make some cost-cutting changes, they determined it wasn't enough and they'd be forced to sell the hospital. Alana brokered a deal to sell to Pegasus while the doctors from the settlement worked together to come up with the money they needed to buy it themselves. To stop the deal from going through before they could get the money together, they quit en masse, causing Pegasus to pull out of the deal. They then went to Catherine Avery, who put up the rest of the money and helped them purchase the hospital. As part of the deal, she put Jackson on the hospital board.\n\nFeelings For April and Wedding[]\n\nOn the day of April's wedding, Jackson runs into April at the hospital as she is looking for Meredith and Cristina and asks him if he is coming to her wedding. After realizing that she really wants him there, Jackson decides to go. When Jackson and Stephanie arrive at April's wedding, Jackson picks up a box that contains a butterfly and as it flies into the air, Jackson remembers what April told him about wanting butterflies at her wedding, but brushes it off. As April is walking down the aisle, Jackson smiles at the beautiful bride. When the priest asks everyone if they agree to support Matthew and April's marriage, April locks eyes with Jackson as he begins to realize what is really happening. Everyone says yes except Jackson. He then turns to Stephanie and says \"I'm sorry\" then stands up then sits back down. Finally, Jackson takes a deep breath and stands up again and says, \"I love you. I always have. I love everything about you - even the things that I don't like, I love. And I want you with me. I love you and I think that you love me, too. Do you?\" Matthew is visibly upset, Jackson looks scared and vulnerable, and April looks like she is in shock and takes a deep breath.[4]\n\nApril's Pregnancy and Loss of Samuel[]\n\nNot too long after their wedding, Jackson and April got into a fight about how they would raise their hypothetical children, especially regarding religion and beliefs. April was offended and felt that Jackson loved her despite her religion and therefore just tolerated her. April then left their home and went to live with Arizona and Callie for a while.\n\nUpon running into April as she came to retrieve her iPod, Jackson expressed regret over the ridiculing her beliefs. He said they loved one another and made vows to push through conversations like this, as it was one they would have to have at some point. He stressed they ultimately shared the same values. She agreed, except that he would not agree if she were to tell their future children that their Creator loved. He asked her to take a break from their hypothetical children, but she revealed they couldn't as she was pregnant.\n\nThe couple started to prepare for their child. Their world was shattered when Jackson overheard a conversation between Stephanie and Nicole Herman about their son, as they discussed the possibility of the baby suffering from osteogenesis imperfecta. Jackson had to break the news to April, who avoided it by diving into work. At the end of the day, Jackson took her outside to talk and she broke down in his arms as she revealed the sex of their baby to him. They then consulted with Arizona and Nicole to find out which type of OI their baby was suffering from. Unfortunately, their son was diagnosed with type II, meaning he would die mere hours after birth and was also at risk for intrauterine fractures. Guided by Catherine, Jackson and April decided to induce labor, baptize their boy, and hold him until his final breath. April initially agreed to the plan, but she took her faith and started praying for a miracle. Jackson brought up that wouldn't happen and April revealed her anger and disappointment in God. Jackson then went to the chapel to ask God to show up for April. April found her faith again through a patient who had lost her husband earlier that day. She then decided to name their boy Samuel Norbert Avery, the final step she had to take to come to terms with the plan. Jackson agreed to the name and their plan was put into motion. Jackson and April held their son and soaked in every moment with him until his passing. Afterward, Jackson took April home, where he continued to care for her. He decided to give her space as he felt she needed it in order to come to terms with what had happened.\n\nApril first returned to the hospital for Nicole's surgery. Jackson stayed by her side all day until he went to check on a patient of his in the ICU. She returned to work not long after, and choose to avoid dealing with her pain by becoming a tougher version of herself. She wanted to have sex all the time, which had Jackson worried, but she assured him she didn't need the space and that she was still herself. Jackson filled the void in his life by turning to teaching, recruiting Ben to join the new version of the Plastics Posse.\n\nDivorce[]\n\nApril joined the army as a doctor and did a tour in Jordan with Owen Hunt. While she was gone her marriage with Jackson deteriorated. She became pregnant with their second child, Harriet, and they later divorced and have joint custody of their daughter.\n\nFinding His Father[]\n\nJackson tracked down his father and took a case in the nearby Avery Medical Center--Bozeman. He requested Meredith to join him, but knowing the real reason behind his trip, Catherine had April take her place as she would offer a better support system. After hitting a dead end on the case, Jackson spent the night at his father's diner and got drunk. April eventually found him there, but he yelled at her and left. April ended up talking with Robert Avery and discovered his identity. She then went to confront Jackson about this and pressed him to talk to his father. Jackson went to do so and told him the truth. They sat down and Jackson updated him about his life. Robert talked about how he met Catherine and how he walked out because of her crushing expectations. Jackson was overwhelmed and left after realizing Robert didn't know who he was as a person. After coming up with a fix for the case, Jackson returned to the diner to tell his father that he was glad they met, but there wouldn't be a next time because Robert broke the promise you make when you become a parent. He told Robert he wasn't his father and left.[5]\n\nFeelings for Maggie, Harper's Death, and Surgical Contest[]\n\nFollowing the death of his grandfather, Jackson inherited a quarter billion dollars. He bought a boat to relax on and then decided that he felt sidetracked lately, so he talked to Bailey and asked her to accept a large donation in order to set up a surgical contest that would fund projects rather than just award one surgeon like the Harper Avery Award. His name couldn't be anywhere near it since he wanted to participate. Bailey accepted and later got Richard to run it, since she wanted to participate, too.\n\nJackson also realized he had feelings for Maggie, and after learning that she reciprocated them, they began a relationship. After Maggie saved April's life, his and Maggie's relationship deepened, especially after April left the hospital and got remarried to Matthew. Though Jackson and Maggie hit a bump in their relationship over Jackson's newfound interest in religion and faith, they eventually reconciled when they learned about Catherine's tumor. Maggie helped Jackson through the process, using the death of her own mother as a guide.\n\nDiscovering His Spirituality and Catherine's Cancer[]\n\nJackson prayed to God to bring April back after she fell into a ravine with a river that left her asystolic and severely hypothermic. She recovered without deficits. That left Jackson to look for spirituality in his own life.\n\nThe day after Alex and Jo's wedding, he noticed a hungover Maggie and Andrew and wondered why people numb life's most beautiful moments with alcohol. He decided they would all walk to work together to enjoy the weather. He was intrigued by April's spontaneous wedding, as their own wedding had been, too, and wondered if that was how faith worked. Andrew pulled him and Maggie out of the way of a car that was about to hit them. While checking on the driver and Nisha Chopri, who was hit, Jackson thanked Andrew for saving their lives. At the hospital, Jackson worked on Nisha's leg and he wondered if Nisha getting hit by her own matchmaker was the beginning of a chain of events that were meant to be, even hinting that God may be behind it, working in mysterious ways. That night at home, Jackson confided in Maggie that, much to his own surprise, he had started to believe in something and that he felt it pulsating through him. He wanted to leap and trust that something would catch him as April and Matthew did. Maggie pointed out they got married. He said he wanted to trust it. Thinking he was proposing, Maggie claimed they were out of milk and ran out.[6]\n\nJackson himself returned to the hospital because Nisha spiked a fever. Nisha flirted with him. Jackson had to resuscitate Cece while Nisha also became tachycardic and eventually septic. Jackson and Meredith agreed Cece was too aggressive with her matchmaking attempts. Nisha was found to have necrotizing fasciitis. He and Levi debrided her wound in the hyperbaric chamber and Jackson found out through him that Maggie was avoiding him because she thought he had proposed. Unfortunately, Nisha went into V-fib. Jackson performed CPR for 35 minutes before calling the time of death. Distraught over the loss and the apparent lack of a deeper meaning behind the accident, he wanted to get out, but he had to wait for the chamber to depressurize. After work, Jackson and Maggie talked. He had trouble understanding why they got to live while Nisha didn't. Maggie suggested he had some PTSD after his family empire crumbled and April leaving. Jackson pointed out there were also good things in his life and told her that he loved her. She reciprocated. He apologized for the accidental proposal and said he had some stuff to figure out.[7]\n\nHe decided to go on a spontaneous spiritual quest. He took a leave of absence and left Maggie a voice mail to tell her he needed to take a step back from his life and look at the bigger picture. He didn't tell her face to face because he knew he couldn't leave if he saw her face when he told her he needed time to find answers to his big life questions.[8] He traveled to national parks to find himself in nature. He sent Maggie a picture of a tree.[9]\n\nHe briefly returned to the hospital to operate on Rafi Elshami, a boy with extensive scapular osteochondroma. Rafi and his father Aamir shared their s'mores with him by a creek in Oregon so in return, Jackson arranged the surgery pro bono. Before surgery, he invited Maggie to talk over dinner, but she avoided him with her patients as an excuse. Pathology revealed the tumors were malignant, so they prepared to remove the scapula altogether, but Maggie inspired Jackson to try extracorporeal radiation to save Rafi's mobility. The plan worked. Afterward, Jackson visited Maggie in her lab and told her he was done with his trips as doing his work made him feel more connected to something larger than him, and Maggie was a huge part of that. He apologized for the way he left so abruptly. She forgave him and they shared a kiss.[10] He remained on his best behavior to make up for his trips by bringing Maggie coffee and food in her lab. On Day of the Dead, she found herself missing her mother and wanting to be alone, so he gave her some time while bringing marigolds to the lab.[11]\n\nTheir relationship flourished until Maggie saw texts from a woman named Kate on his phone that included heart emojis. Maggie assumed he was cheating, but he explained he was just a friend he had met during his nature trips. The nature helped him with his PTSD and he ran into Kate, who was doing similar trips to process her brother's death. He showed her all the texts and explained it was nice to talk to people who had been through the same as him. She inquired about those people and he admitted he still talked to April from time to time. Maggie admitted she never pictured him blowing up their relationship. He was surprised she ever pictured their relationship ending. Jackson then confessed he talked to other women because Maggie never shared her feelings about anything. Maggie told him that she imagined he'd find a priest on his spiritual quest and come back with answers, but instead, he came back with more questions, which he then took to other women. She had always been five steps ahead of everyone in her life, which is why she never learned to communicate her feelings, but now she felt like he was five steps ahead of her and she didn't know how to catch up. She inquired about what he talked about with Kate. He replied that the only thing he and April never saw eye to eye on was God and now that he finally believed, April had married someone else. He had realized he needed to grieve the end of that marriage and what Harriet had lost because of it, and he didn't know how to talk to Maggie about it. Upset, Maggie got her stuff and left the penthouse.[12]\n\nWith a windstorm heading towards the city, Jackson avoided Maggie at work. He scrubbed in with Teddy and Owen and witnessed her telling him about her pregnancy with his child. Owen was baffled while Teddy was paged away to the ER, but Jackson told him that even though he was the last to find out about Harriet, it was the best thing that ever happened to him. Jackson's patient and his wife had a tumultuous history with lots of fighting, which made Jackson find Maggie to discuss their first big fight. However, Jackson was surprised when Maggie told him that his mother had a grade III chondrosarcoma on her spine.[13]\n\nShe showed him the scans and he felt helpless. Jackson tried to reach his mother, but it went straight to voicemail. He then focused on getting the elevators back on, which had been stuck ever since a power outage caused by the storm. Jackson saved Jed Lundberg's legs when they were crushed when an elevator suddenly started working again. Afterward, Jackson found Richard and inquired if he had heard from Catherine at all. Since he hadn't, Jackson took him someplace quiet to tell about her cancer.[14]\n\nRichard and Jackson had dinner with Catherine as soon as she flew back to Seattle, but they avoided talking about the cancer. Jackson had a hard time accepting the diagnosis, rendering him unable to properly share his feelings with Maggie. The next day, they had a special pelvic exenteration together that would spare the uterus using a technique developed by Catherine. In surgery, the doctors hit a snag when the uterine tissue proved too friable to spare the uterus, disrupting their entire plan. They performed a hysterectomy. Catherine angrily left the OR when Jackson suggested taking over for her. After the surgery, he and Richard found Catherine fuming in a lounge. She said she hadn't told them because she wasn't ready to talk to them about it yet, because it would make the cancer painfully real for her. They assured her they could handle the bad news and that they would support her as her family. She then broke down as reality hit her and they comforted her.[15]\n\nOn the day of the surgery, Jackson visited Catherine with Harriet. She asked him and Richard to refrain from being doctors around her and instead support her as her son and husband. Tom and Amelia came in to explain their approach. Catherine needed a moment to herself and went to an empty OR. Jackson followed her there and she shared that ever since her first solo surgery, she had been singing \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\" in her head to help her get through stressful situations. He said he had sung to himself, too, in his first solo surgery. She revealed she had snuck into the gallery to see it and they made a deal to sneak into the gallery together to see Harriet's first surgery. Afterward, Catherine gave Jackson documents declaring him the leader of the Foundation in case she didn't make it out alive as well as a detailed party plan in case the surgery would be a success. Jackson then walked her back to her room. Right before the surgery, Jackson surprised her by playing \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\" in the OR. After a dance with the entire staff, Catherine got settled on the table.\n\nA nervous Jackson kept pacing up in the gallery. While he wanted to see, he grew increasingly frustrated by Tom's laid-back attitude and took a walk. He sat down on a gurney and Maggie sat down with him. He told her his mother had always been larger than life. He couldn't imagine a room without her in it after all the meddling she had done in his life and thinking about her not being there made him feel like a scared little kid. She understood the feeling and comforted him as he broke down in tears. The surgery went relatively well, leaving behind a small piece of the tumor as to not damage Catherine's brachial plexus and save her career. Catherine was relieved that they saved her life and her career and announced that they would still have the success party, albeit in a few months so that she could dance. Later that night, Maggie brought Jackson a beverage as he sat by his mother's side.[16]\n\nWhile Catherine was positive right after the surgery, her attitude worsened as she was facing a tough recovery over the holidays. She went to bed early on Christmas Eve and continued to refuse help. Jackson and Maggie attended the Karevs' NYE party, but Maggie noticed his head was elsewhere, so they went home to watch the ball drop from their bed. During one of their visits to Catherine and Richard's house, Jackson and Maggie witnessed as Catherine fell on the treadmill and broke down crying. Jackson couldn't stand to see her like that and went to take a walk in the garden. Maggie suggested a movie night to celebrate Valentine's Day to distract him. She knew he was hurting but didn't know how to make it better. He didn't know either. She confessed she had a fleeting thought of wanting to kill herself in the worst moments of her mother's illness and how the pain and fear were so strong that she experienced physical discomforts, which Jackson recognized.[17]\n\nMaggie worked on sharing her feelings more, which Jackson appreciated. Jackson saved the hand of a kid who got shot at a parade, which added to Jackson's fear of Harriet getting shot in public.[18] Jackson surprised Maggie by turning a weekend away she agreed to into a camping trip. He packed his car with supplies and assured her she'd love it. However, Maggie canceled the trip when she decided to stay to support Amelia, who was having a rough time when Betty turned up amongst the overdoses flooding the ER. Jackson took care of an unhoused man's injured feet and felt guilty for having talked about his camping trip and three pairs of ski boots in front of him. He tried to find a shelter for him so he could continue to care for his feet but to no avail. He then decided to give Ralph all of his camping equipment, hoping it would last him through the waitlist period before landing a place at a shelter.[19]\n\nJackson hosted a party for Catherine at his penthouse in honor of Amelia and Tom, whom he didn't particularly like given his history with April. Catherine didn't want to attend and took a long time to get there. When she finally did, Jackson gathered everyone for a speech, but it was interrupted by Tom and Owen fighting and then smoke coming from the kitchen. The penthouse was evacuated and Ben later informed Jackson they found plastic in the oven. Out on the street, Catherine told her son she hadn't meant to be ungrateful. She then suggested the two of them and Richard and Maggie celebrate in the limo, which they did with burgers, fries, and champagne. Having learned to enjoy every moment from Bailey, Catherine decided she wanted to celebrate every scan with her family that way.[20]\n\nAfter the fire, Jackson temporarily moved in with Maggie and her sisters and cooked them dinner. At work, Jo was ranting about how Alex's mother was pushing her to have kids now and how kids were terrible, which offended Jackson. She later apologized and he told her that kids can give you a reason to live when life tries to ruin you.[21]\n\nAs part of his spray-on skin research, Jackson initiated a project with tilapia skin to treat severe burns with less scarring than the usual methods. Meanwhile, he supported Maggie as she prepared herself to appear on Good Morning Seattle to talk about herself after she let slip her parentage in a medical podcast, which made for big news in the medical community. During Maggie's interview, Jo took it as a sign that she needed to find her own parents. Jackson warned her it could go badly, citing his own experience with his father, which only caused him more pain. Afterward, Maggie visited him in his lab. While kissing, they got a little competitive over their innovative projects, both striving to be the best.[22]\n\nCatherine's road to recovery remained difficult. She opted not to return to work when planned, only telling her family \"cancer card.\" Jackson worried about her and started thinking Richard was keeping something from him about her, but Richard assured him that wasn't true. They worked on a gender non-binary patient together, which required Jackson to teach Richard the right pronouns.[23]\n\nJackson and Meredith lured Catherine back to work with a triple transplant patient, for whom they finally found a match. The transplant included the abdominal wall, a penis, and a scrotum. Jackson and Meredith teamed up to go retrieve the organs at another hospital. On their trip, Meredith shared that Richard had caught her and Andrew together at the party and that she was nervous because Richard was overseeing Andrew's first solo surgery. Jackson remembered him walking in on him and Maggie once, so he could imagine how nervous Andrew would be. The procurement went well, but when they returned, they discovered Catherine had called off the surgery because the patient had lied about his support system, which she had come to value a great deal since her cancer. Owen talked with the patient and convinced Catherine to move forward with the surgery. While operating, Jackson told Meredith that was he was constantly worrying over Catherine and how he also worried about how it affected Richard, as Meredith did. During the last part, Catherine promised Jackson she wouldn't keep it from him if she got worse. He appreciated that and she thanked him for the surgery.[24]\n\nOn Jo's first day back, Jackson invited her to help him out on her project since Meredith asked him to check up on her. He brought up her having met her birth mother, but she didn't want to talk about it. He insisted and she said she shouldn't have gone looking like he told her to. He replied she went looking anyway so she must have felt like she needed to do it. Looking back, she didn't understand why because she had everything and she threw it all away for nothing. He pointed out she still had everything, but she knew Alex wasn't happy with her anymore and she was convinced talking to him about her experience would only hurt more. Jackson revealed he knew that she was drunk and, after she refused to talk any more, told her she would not be met with compassion if she ever came to work drunk again. Jackson informed Alex about what happened. Inspired by Jo, he sought out Maggie in her blue room and asked her to move in with him because he did not want to take love for granted.[25]\n\nMaggie didn't accept right away because she wanted to talk it over with Meredith first. Jackson didn't understand why she needed her permission, but Maggie just wanted to clear it with her first because Meredith depended on her with the kids and she was a buffer between her and Amelia sometimes. After a conversation with Lucas Ripley, she came to tell him that the only right answer was yes. She just needed him to weigh the pros and cons with her, because that was who she is and she wanted to make sure that he could accept her being her. Jackson agreed, but again invited her to go camping with him first.[26]\n\nBreaking Up with Maggie[]\n\nThey went on their trip. He poured her coffee in the mornings and they made out in their tent. While not entirely enthusiastic, she agreed to go hiking with him so he could show her a special spot. He appreciated her doing her best and she enjoyed seeing him in his element. Their hike was cut short when she was bitten by a bug and twisted her ankle while running away from it. They made it back to the tent to take care of the swollen bite while she had decided that they should just accept what the other person liked and not try to get the other one to like it, too. They then found out that Alex had been trying to reach her for their shared patient Gus Carter. Maggie decided they needed to go, but while packing up their stuff, they received word that Teddy had gone into labor, meaning her service was no longer covered. They decided to leave their stuff behind and come back for it later, but a downpour prevented them from taking off.[27]\n\nThey waited it out in their tent and took off for the car. While walking, she had trouble trusting he knew the way and freaked out when he slipped and fell into a creek, which sparked a fight between them. She blamed him for forcing her to come with while he hated how she was assigning blame to him for everything while he just wanted her to come explore something he loved. He ended up carrying her and said he only wanted her to expand, not change. He suggested she had missed out on some aspects of life while buried in books during her formative years. She fired back that they were in this situation because his privilege prevented him from learning about consequences. She said the money couldn't get them to Gus. He was offended at her calling him \"Mr. Monopoly\" and concluded she did not respect him while she realized he didn't like her for who she was.\n\nThey made it to the car, but they got stuck in traffic caused by thick fog covering the city. He grabbed a flashlight and headed out to explore the situation, telling her to stay in the car where she was safe and knew exactly what would happen in the near future. She watched him disappear into the fog. When he didn't return for quite some time, she went after him and called his name, but he didn't respond.[28]\n\nDuring his walk, he heard Mari Prishna calling for help and found her holding onto a rope that was attached to her unconscious husband Jai Prishna, who was dangling off the edge of a cliff with broken legs. Jackson took over for her and called 911. Maggie went to look for him. She found him right when Victoria Hughes arrived on the aid car with supplies. Together, they pulled Jai up and transported him to the hospital. After Jai and Mari were taken into the ER, Jackson and Maggie sat in the ambulance in silence. They agreed to let their tempers settle before talking about their fight. Jackson worked on both Mari and Jai with Link and they managed to save them. A week later, Jackson tried to talk to Maggie, but she was still angry at him for abandoning her in the car on an unfamiliar road in the woods, so they planned on talking later.\n\nA week later, Jai suffered from what appeared to be a stroke. While studying their scans, Maggie came in and Jackson told her that Mari had held onto Jai for so long that a tree sliced up her nerves and almost cut off her arm, only for him to end up on life support after excruciating surgeries. They knew there was something broken beyond repair in Jai that landed him there, but they had no idea what. It made Jackson wonder if Mari should have let go back at the cliff. Maggie realized he meant that their relationship had broken beyond repair and that he wanted to let go.\n\nJackson ran into Vic in the ambulance bay and thanked her for helping him back at that cliff. She stated she was just doing her job, but she appreciated hearing how Mari and Jai were doing. Jackson invited her for burgers, but she had to work. They did meet up for lunch after a week. He talked about the fat embolus syndrome that they had diagnosed Jai with. Then they both admitted they were just getting out of a serious relationship and that it wasn't a good time to start something new. The experimental protocol that the doctors had started was a success and Jai recovered without deficits. Jackson shared the good news with Vic, which Maggie witnessed. She asked him how long this thing between him and Vic had been going on. He told her they were just friends, even though it was none of her business. She agreed since they didn't like each other and therefore were not friends anymore.[29]\n\nShortly after the breakup, Jackson shared a post on social media with #Freedom. Maggie was bitter because of this and mocked Victoria's intellect, stating he now got to feel superior all the time instead of dating an intellectually challenging woman. He learned Bailey had taken action to improve the residents' skills and Tom added to Jackson's dislike of him by dismissing teaching residents. Per Meredith's request, Jackson performed a biopsy of a nodule in Robin Jones's neck. He also assured Levi he would cover for him if Bailey were to discover he had brought hospital supplies to Meredith for her street clinic, stating he was not afraid of getting in trouble if it allowed Meredith to help people. The biopsy revealed cancer, which, while treatable, faced Robin with the choice between bankruptcy and death, confirming Jackson had been right to help Meredith out. Later, he ran into Maggie and told her that she had been wrong about Vic, who was smart and brave. Maggie apologized for her mean comments but pointed out his post was spiteful, even if he hadn't meant it that way.[30]\n\nJackson and Vic continued to spend more time together. They went hiking together and she impressed him with her strength by removing a fallen tree from the path by herself. Later, he ran into her after she had dropped off a patient at the ER and noticed she had a facial lac. He suggested he stitch it up, eager to show her his skills. While suturing, he countered her teasing him about being stronger than him by stating his training was about zeroing in on the smallest detail. He flirtatiously said it was his job to take care of his patients' every need. After he finished, she pulled him in and kissed. He suggested they take it slow but neither was in the mood to do that, so they continued to make out.[31]\n\nWhen an article was published under Meredith's name that inadvertently trashed Grey Sloan, Tom arranged for Jackson to do a pro bono surgery on a 3-year-old girl with a severe case of craniosynostosis in exchange for the parents allowing them to film the surgery and the family's experience to get the hospital some positive, free publicity, which he hated. Throughout the day, Jackson noticed Tom was more concerned about getting good footage for the report than putting the parents at ease, so after Jo pointed out Meredith was doing the right thing without worrying about optics, Jackson decided to do the same. He replaced Tom with Amelia and operated on the girl pro bono without filming it as he knew they were actually uncomfortable with that. During surgery, Tom burst in and tried to pull rank to step in for Amelia and bring in the camera crew. However, Jackson said he himself was the Foundation and also the majority shareholder of the hospital, pointing out that he was, in fact, Tom's boss, and forced him to leave. The surgery was pulled off without a hitch. Later, when he was checking up on the girl in post-op, Vic stopped by and admitted she was impressed by his work. They then went for dinner in the cafeteria together.[32]\n\nOn Halloween, Jackson treated Mary Rose Hawkins-Garrett, who suffered from xeroderma pigmentosum and had burns from apparent UV exposure, even though she maintained she hadn't been exposed. He had to disappoint Mary Rose by telling her she wouldn't get to leave in time for trick-or-treating but assured her the parade on the peds floor was great. Levi informed him there was no parade since Alex was gone so Jackson bestowed that task onto him. After surgery, Jackson again tried to get Mary Rose to admit that she had been exposed but she only said she wanted Alex, who had treated her before. Jackson then did his best Alex impression, which made her laugh. She then admitted she had been exposed when she was chasing her new cat. Jackson said this was her one pass. He used this case to point out to Andrew, who had been having trouble with Zola, that kids always have a reason for their behavior.[33]\n\nWhen his mother came back into town, Maggie approached him to talk. He tried to brush her off but she insisted on talking. She told him Catherine was still unaware of their break-up. They started bickering until Maggie noticed a woman she thought had a striking resemblance to her. Jackson commented he'd have to see her scowl first.[34]\n\nJackson came to support Meredith at her hearing before the medical commission. While there, he ran into Richard, who had just returned to town after Sabrina's funeral. Richard told him his family wasn't ready to see anyone from Seattle, which is why he hadn't reached out. Jackson was surprised to learn that his mother hadn't attended the funeral either. Jackson followed the hearing, which was interrupted when Paul Castello had a seizure. During the recess, Jackson found a drunk Maggie in the hotel bar beating herself up over Sabrina's death. He decided to take her home. Over wine, he asked her about Richard and Catherine but she didn't know anything about their problems. Jackson then got a text that Meredith got to keep her license. Maggie realized she hadn't helped at all but he pointed out she had helped by not testifying drunk. They laughed, which led to his admitting that he missed talking with her about their lives. They nearly kissed until he said he couldn't. She then threw him out.[35]\n\nCatherine caught Jackson leaning into Vic in the ambulance bay. She introduced herself to Catherine and left on the aid car. Catherine commented on his getting cozy with the paramedic. He later found her in a conference room and clarified that he wasn't cheating as he and Maggie had broken up months ago. He promised her it wouldn't affect her marriage but Catherine wasn't sure how long he'd still have to worry about that. She told him about Gemma. Jackson likened it to her past with Tom but she pointed out she didn't have a history of cheating. Jackson tried to reassure her and pointed out that she had a habit of retreating when she had an idea in her head that she didn't like. When she said they hadn't spoken in weeks, he asked if they hadn't spoken or if she just hadn't listened. He met up with her again later at the bar after she went to see Richard. She downed an entire gin and tonic when she entered the bar and ordered three more. She told him that he had Gemma in his office and that an intern called Gemma Richard's wife. Jackson tried to calm her down and said it sounded more like a miscommunication, also adding that those problems began when she stood back and let Bailey fire him. She didn't like his defending Richard and brought up his new girlfriend. Jackson pointed out it wasn't relevant to her business but she disagreed since he had chosen to date her husband's daughter. He wasn't willing to be held responsible for both her and his own relationships. Jackson was still at the bar when a car suddenly crashed into it.[36]\n\nCOVID-19 Pandemic and Racial Inequity[]\n\nAfter working the frontlines during the COVID-19 pandemic, Jackson was confronted with severe racial inequity in medicine. He began to wonder why the Foundation had not done more and collaborated with Alma Ortiz to come up with ideas to help the underprivileged citizens of Seattle. When he confronted Catherine about her neglecting his pitches, she pointed out all the work they had accomplished through the Foundation and said change takes time. He was not satisfied and began pondering possibilities to make serious changes. He got the idea to take over the Foundation from his mother and move to Boston, leaving behind his life and surgical career. He took a sudden leave of absence and sought out his father to see if walking away from his life was the right path for him. His father reinforced his plan. Jackson drove home to tell his mother that he was taking over the Foundation and then went to see April and ask her to move her family to Boston with him since he could not leave Harriet behind, like his father had left him. April was not supportive of his plan since he was uprooting his whole life and asked her to do the same over something that he had actively rejected for as long as she had known him. However, after his passionate speeches about his ideas, she agreed to make the move with him and revealed that she and Matthew had split up during the pandemic. They were excited for new horizons and started planning their move to Boston. While in Boston, April and Jackson rekindled their relationship.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nAs a child, Jackson often listened to stories about his grandfather, Harper Avery, and ever since then, he has always wanted to be a surgeon. Jackson is very forward, often saying what's on his mind even if it hurts someone's feelings. He is also intelligent, kind, and very protective of the people he cares about like his mother, Catherine Fox, and his best friend and later wife, April Kepner.\n\nRelationships[]\n\nRomantic[]\n\nCristina Yang[]\n\nWhen Jackson first arrived at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, he developed a small crush on Cristina Yang and kissed her while inebriated at a party. However, Cristina did not return any intimate feelings towards him. Instead, she broke the kiss immediately and told him that it never happened.\n\nLexie Grey[]\n\nJackson and Lexie Grey developed a relationship after Mark Sloan bribed Jackson with surgery in exchange for information on how Lexie was doing. Jackson got the information he wanted but didn't tell Mark about it because he'd developed feelings for Lexie and wanted to respect her privacy. Mark did, however, still allow Jackson to perform the surgery he was promised. Lexie and Jackson eventually became a couple, sleeping together all over the hospital and Meredith's house, very much to April's dismay. They attended Callie and Arizona's wedding together.[37] However, when Jackson's mother came to town, Jackson sent Lexie to go visit her sister Molly in fear that his mother would somehow ruin their relationship.[38] Throughout their relationship, Lexie's ex-boyfriend and mentor to Jackson, Mark Sloan was still in love with Lexie and was uneasy seeing the two together. Lexie and Jackson broke up when Jackson realized that Lexie was still in love with Mark.\n\nMara Keaton[]\n\nWhen Catherine Avery came to SGMW for a bladder transplant, she brought along Mara Keaton, a Urology fellow at Mass Gen. Catherine asked Jackson to tour Mara around the hospital, which made him suspect that his mother was pushing him into a relationship with her. Mara felt that Catherine could be really annoying also. He encouraged Mara to stand up to his mother. Mara did stand up to her, but Catherine was not mad at Mara. Jackson was pleased with what Mara had done and after that, he slept with her in the on-call room.[39]\n\nApril Kepner[]\n\nOn the night before his medical board exams, Jackson and April Kepner engage in a bar fight and later have sex. Jackson was leery at first, due to the fact that April was a virgin, but she promised him it was okay and she wanted to do it. Later, however, April told Jackson that the reason she had been a virgin so long is that she was celibate. She was completely heartbroken and distraught at what happened between them, which caused Jackson to feel extremely guilty. They had another sexual encounter in the men’s room during a break from their medical board exams, which helped both Jackson and April calm down.[40] However, it was too late for April and she failed. When she was let go from the hospital, Jackson comforted her, but April perceived it as him pitying her and told him to leave her alone.[41]\n\nWhen Jackson accepted the job at Tulane, he told April he felt sick at the thought of leaving her behind. He postponed his move, however, when he heard about the plane crash. When Mark Sloan showed signs of recovery, April told Jackson the only reason she stayed was to make sure Mark was okay, and now that he was, she would be leaving for home.[42]\n\nWhen April was rehired by Owen Hunt, she told Jackson she was in the process of revirginizing. Although Jackson didn't approve because he felt she was trying to pretend they never happened, he promised to help in any way that he could. However, they couldn't resist each other and continued their relationship until finally breaking it off. The two went their separate ways, which culminated in them seeing other people.\n\nDuring a massive storm near the hospital, a bus flipped and the doctors had to rush in and evacuate as many people as possible. The doctors believed they got to everyone, but Jackson stayed behind because he noticed a small pink shoe. When April noticed Jackson wasn't with them, she began to panic and rushed back towards the bus as it lay there ablaze. Suddenly, the bus exploded. Thinking Jackson was in the explosion, April became hysterical. When he emerged from the fire with a small child, she ran to hug him but was stopped by Matthew.\n\nWhen Jackson was being treated by Callie for his injuries, April walked in furious, screaming at him for almost dying, but was quickly removed. Thinking she had lost Jackson made her realize her true feelings for him. When everyone calmed down, she went back in to see him. She told him that she wanted him, which Jackson quickly rebuffed by telling her she was marrying Matthew soon. April then told Jackson to give her a reason not to.\n\nAlthough Jackson may have still had feelings for April, he did not give her a reason to leave Matthew. Instead, he exploded at April, telling her the only reason she wanted him was because he had moved on. This put a small strain on their friendship, but they still spoke occasionally. April even admitted that Jackson set her straight and she was happy to be getting married to Matthew.[43]\n\nWhen the time came for April to send out wedding invitations, she purposely left out Jackson's name. She said she did this because she feared it would upset Matthew. Instead, she invited Stephanie, hoping she would bring Jackson as her guest. After speaking with Matthew and April, Jackson realizes that April truly wants him to be at her wedding so he decides to go and they share a brief hug, re-establishing their friendship.\n\nDuring the ceremony, however, Jackson apologized to Stephanie before telling April that he loves her and that he always has loved her in front of the entire crowd.[44] It is later revealed that April chose Jackson and decided to marry him.[45]\n\nAfter working on Jill Kasliner, Jackson and April fought about how they would raise their children. April walked out and ended up staying with Arizona and Callie for a few days. She came back to retrieve her iPod and told Jackson that they couldn't table the discussion about how they'll raise their children any longer because she's pregnant.[46] They later discover that their unborn son has Osteogenesis Imperfecta type 2 and decide to induce labor at 24 weeks. Shortly after giving birth and holding their son, Samuel Norbert, he died in their arms.[47]\n\nAfter the death of Samuel, April left Jackson to go overseas with Owen to join the Army as a trauma surgeon. She was originally supposed to be gone for only three months but ended up staying away for a whole year.[48]\n\nApril came back and things between them were rocky because Jackson felt like he had been abandoned by April during the time he needed her most. When April decided to take another tour, Jackson said that if she did, he wouldn't wait for her, although he said he loves her.\n\nApril came back from her second tour and Jackson told her to move out of their apartment. She refused because they were married and she didn't want to give that up. He eventually left and stayed with Bailey and Ben for a while. He told April he wanted a divorce and after some sexual encounters and four weeks of marriage counseling, April was served with divorce papers in the middle of the emergency room.[49]\n\nRight before reluctantly signing the divorce papers, April discovered she was pregnant for a second time, yet chose to not inform Jackson and proceeded with signing the papers. Even after the divorce, she continued to keep her pregnancy a secret from Jackson and everyone else (with the exception of Arizona and Alex) until Arizona took the liberty in telling Jackson herself.[50] Jackson was very upset with April for lying to him and having to hear the news from someone else, but he was particularly bothered by the fact that April knew even before they signed the divorce papers, allowing their divorce to be finalized while she was withholding this important information. April confessed that she decided not to tell him because she knew he would change his mind about the divorce and she didn't want him to stay with her just for the baby.[51]\n\nLater, she hooked up with Jackson while they were in Montana to work on a case.[52]\n\nApril agreed to move with Jackson to Boston for Harriet to be near her father. While in Boston, April and Jackson rekindled their relationship.\n\nStephanie Edwards[]\n\nJackson started a relationship with the new intern, Stephanie, after hooking up in a car during Bailey's wedding, but he claimed it was purely sexual and only for fun. However, Stephanie seemed to think their relationship was more serious than that, stating that she would follow him if he were to find a job at a different hospital.\n\nJackson introduced Stephanie to his mother and the couple became more serious than they were.\n\nStephanie confronted Jackson about any residual feelings between him and April, which he denied.\n\nJackson indirectly broke up with Stephanie at April's wedding, telling her \"I'm sorry,\" before standing up, interrupting April's wedding, and professing his love for her.[53]\n\nPriya[]\n\nJackson briefly dated a woman called Priya, a human rights lawyer who travels a lot. When Jackson was invited to Maggie's game night, he decided to bring Priya. They played and had fun, but the night was abruptly ended when Clive's wife showed up, shocking everyone. After Clive and his wife left, Jackson called the night and took Priya home. He decided then to end things with her because of his feelings for Maggie.[54]\n\nMaggie Pierce[]\n\nMaggie and Jackson began developing romantic feelings for each other during her mom's treatment for breast cancer at Grey Sloan Memorial. The two developed a stronger friendship after her mom's passing. Her mom, Diane, left Jackson in possession of pictures she wanted Maggie to have. April pointed out during the fire at the hospital that Jackson had feelings for Maggie, and Maggie had feelings for him too. Maggie later confronted Jackson, quickly calling such suggestions, \"silly.\" But soon after, Jackson and Maggie started growing closer to each other.\n\nShe then later declined his offer for a drink, citing that his mom and her biological father, Richard, are married and that it's complicated. However, after discovering that Maggie's boyfriend Clive was married, Jackson ended his time with Priya, unable to deny his feelings for Maggie. Jackson returned to Meredith's house, confessing his attraction for Maggie and the two shared their first kiss, beginning a romantic relationship.[55]\n\nJackson and Maggie's relationship had been going strong, with them having conversations about Jackson's loss and pain and Maggie's difficulty in opening up to him. Maggie comforted Jackson during his mom's cancer treatment, while he encouraged her to be more open in their relationship. After they dated for a while, Jackson asked Maggie to move in with him, and she agreed.\n\nWhile they were camping, Maggie got stung by something, causing her to freak out and injure herself. After a bit of arguing about being in the woods, Jackson tried to explain that he didn't want Maggie to change just to grow and that Maggie missed out on some aspects of life due to her being so young when she graduated everything. Maggie called Jackson privileged and said that Jackson's family is so rich that he couldn't possibly know what consequences were. After this fight Jackson broke things off, saying their relationship was broken beyond repair.[56]\n\nVictoria Hughes[]\n\nVic met Jackson when she responded to a call and found him holding Jai Prishna, who was dangling from a rope over a cliff. She helped him wench Jai up to safety. Later, when she was at the hospital to drop off another patient, he asked her to go get burgers, but she said maybe another time. Later, they had lunch together in the park and talked about Jai. She told him about Lucas dying and he told her about his recent breakup with Maggie. They both agreed that it wasn't a great time for either of them to start a new relationship. Despite this, they continued to see each other, though it remained mostly platonic.[57]\n\nJo Wilson[]\n\nJo wanted a bridge from Alex to something new so she asked Jackson to sleep with her to go over that bridge which he accepted. Later that day they tried to but Jo started crying. Weeks after during the pandemic they wanted a reboot of their friendship and Jo ended up falling asleep on the couch. When they woke up, they slept together. They then kept on sleeping together for a while during covid.\n\nFamilial[]\n\nCatherine Fox[]\n\nJackson perceives his mother as a lunatic, constantly butting in on his personal life, mostly romantic and professional life, which he was especially annoyed at during his residency.\n\nWhen Catherine came to Seattle Grace Mercy West to perform the country's first penile transplant, she grilled him on his romantic life and criticized his girlfriend.[58]\n\nFriendships[]\n\nMeredith Grey[]\n\nMeredith and Jackson's friendship started when she discovered that he was the grandson of Harper Avery and son of famed urologist Catherine Avery. Familiar with the pressure of successful surgeon parents, she defended him when others teased him about it, and when he struggled to embrace or hide his legacy. They found more common ground when Catherine and Richard started dating and got married as Richard became a father figure in Jackson's life like he had been for Meredith.\n\nTheir friendship includes regularly teasing one another, such as her being protective of her at-the-time boyfriend Andrew DeLuca. She confided in Jackson that she had a bad feeling about Andrew's research with her father, while she did her best to be supportive of him. When he started dating Maggie, Meredith warned him not to cheat on her.\n\nAtticus Lincoln[]\n\nJackson befriended Link after working a few cases together. They developed a special handshake between them.[59]\n\nJo Wilson[]\n\nJackson and Jo developed a friendship mainly after she got married to Alex. During a particular surgery, Jo was venting about Alex's mother pushing her to start thinking about having kids. In her rant, she called kids monsters, which offended Jackson. Jo later apologized to him and asked if the cute things outweigh the terror kids and cause. Jackson admitted to her that kids could be monsters, but they also give you the feeling that everything's right. He told her kids can ruin lives but also give you a reason to live when life tries to ruin you.[60]\n\nWhen Jo started thinking about finding her parents, Jackson warned her it could go badly as his finding his own father only caused him more pain.[61]\n\nProfessional[]\n\nMark Sloan[]\n\nDuring Jackson's relationship with Lexie, he and Mark Sloan developed a mentor/student relationship, which continues to grow even after Lexie and Jackson split. Mark often referred to them as the \"Plastics Posse\" - much to Jackson's embarrassment. They later became inseparable and were often teased about their bromance by the other doctors. After Mark's tragic death, Jackson promised him that the \"Plastics Posse\" would live on.\n\nCareer[]\n\nJackson was initially a surgical resident at Mercy West Medical Center, until the merger with Seattle Grace. Upon his transfer to Seattle Grace, Jackson has rotated over the services of several surgical departments, such as neurosurgery, cardiothoracic surgery, and plastics. Jackson took a shine to Plastics and that is now his specialty.\n\nJackson is one of four doctors to pass their medical board exams, and he is currently employed at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital following the death of Mark Sloan. When the hospital was reorganized as Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital and instituted a new board, Jackson became the de facto board chairman as he is the board representative for the Harper Avery Foundation, the majority shareholder of the hospital.\n\nSometime in Jackson's third-year as an attending, he was promoted to the department head of plastic surgery.\n\nNotes and Trivia[]\n\nJackson originally declared cardiothoracic surgery as his specialty during his intern year.[62]\n\nJackson loses his composure and gets nervous when on camera. A similar event happened during his high school graduation.[63]\n\nHe has nightmares, especially after the shooting at Seattle Grace.[64]\n\nHe had a lucky pencil before it was broken during his medical board exams.[65]\n\nJackson played baseball in high school[66] and football in college.[67]\n\nJackson is pro-choice.[68]\n\nJackson lost his virginity when he was 17 to Sarah Richardson and Penny Cairo at his junior prom at the same time. He said he knew exactly what he was doing.[69]\n\nApril named a pig after him.[70]\n\nJackson was originally board certified in general surgery.[71] But as Jackson had Mark Sloan as a mentor, skilled both in plastics and ENT, Jackson can perform ENT-procedures in addition to Jackson's plastics abilities. @GreysMedical twitter confirmed that Jackson is, like his mentor, double-board certified. This was later confirmed in dialogue.[72]\n\nIn the real world, this would be impossible in the timeframe provided because no such fellowships exist. After his General Surgery Board Certification, Jackson would have to complete a Plastic Surgery Residency for six years, and then complete an Otolaryngology fellowship for five years.\n\nJackson was the Gunther.[73]\n\nJackson was an atheist but he professed a possible belief in God while April was in critical condition after an accident. Since then, he has now found faith in God.[74]\n\nStephanie told him that he has an \"angry face\" when he's thinking.[75]\n\nHe suggested the hospital should be renamed to Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital in memory of Lexie Grey and Mark Sloan.[76]\n\nHe likes waffles.[77]\n\nHe doesn't eat leftovers because he thinks it's depressing to eat food out of Tupperware containers.[78]\n\nHe hates gambling.[79]\n\nHe hates throw pillows.[80]\n\nHe's a slow reader.[81]\n\nHis favorite uncle is named Norbert.[82]\n\nHe started calling Dr. Warren and himself the \"Plastics Posse\" in honor of Mark Sloan.[83]\n\nJackson has one of the American Express Black Cards as he offered it as a form of payment to procure a private jet to transport a device for Lincoln McNeil.[84]\n\nIt was later revealed that Avery has access to the Harper Avery Foundation private jet.[85]\n\nIn an alternate universe, Jackson severely injured his hand which prevented him to practice surgery for at least two years.[86]\n\nAs of season twelve, Jackson's badge has been updated so that the department line shows \"Reconstructive Surgery\" as opposed to \"Plastic Surgery\" in seasons nine through eleven.[87]\n\nHe ordered takeout every single night while April was in Jordan.[88]\n\nJackson was promoted off-screen to the head of plastic surgery sometime after Walking Tall as he does not mention himself as a department head when Amelia, Maggie, Callie, Arizona, and Owen were pointed out as heads of their respective departments.\n\nHe was prom king four years in a row.[89]\n\nHe had an imaginary friend named Frodo, who was half-troll, half gremlin, and feasted on the tears of his imaginary enemies.[90]\n\nHe likes to listen to Michael Jackson.[91]\n\nHe once broke up with a girlfriend who kept calling him Jackie.[92]\n\nJackson is good at math.[93]\n\nJackson is a Gryffindor,[94]\n\nGallery[]\n\nNotable Episodes[]\n\nThese episodes are Jackson-centric or otherwise informative about his life.\n\nGet Up, Stand Up\n\nTake It Back\n\nAll I Could Do Was Cry\n\nThe Me Nobody Knows\n\nUnbreak My Heart\n\nWho Is He (And What Is He To You)?\n\nLook Up Child\n\nTradition\n\nMemorable Quotes[]\n\nJackson: I love you, April. I always have. I love everything about you. Even the things I don't like, I love. And I want you with me. I love you, and I think that you love me too. Well, do you?[95]\n\nJackson: In my family, I'm the pretty one. My eyes and my smile, my body. I mean, you should see me without a shirt on. It's kinda ridiculous. But my family is smart, driven, and crazy over-achievers. And they look like they're smart. They don't look like me, which has its perks. Except that my family treated me like I was pretty. They expected nothing from me, ever. Never pushed me, never thought to. So I had to push myself. Hard.[96]\n\nJackson (to April): You wait and let him get to know you. Then he's gonna wanna follow you anywhere. Trust me.\n\nCatherine: Nepotism is for the weak.\n\nJackson: That's what my birthday cards always said.[97]\n\nAppearances[]\n\nGrey's Anatomy, Season 6 #01 \"Good Mourning\" #09 \"New History\" #17 \"Push\" #02 \"Goodbye\" #10 \"Holidaze\" #18 \"Suicide is Painless\" #03 \"I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watchin' Me\" #11 \"Blink\" #19 \"Sympathy for the Parents\" #04 \"Tainted Obligation\" #12 \"I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked\" #20 \"Hook, Line and Sinner\" #05 \"Invasion\" #13 \"State of Love and Trust\" #21 \"How Insensitive\" #06 \"I Saw What I Saw\" #14 \"Valentine's Day Massacre\" #22 \"Shiny Happy People\" #07 \"Give Peace a Chance\" #15 \"The Time Warp\" #23 \"Sanctuary\" #08 \"Invest in Love\" #16 \"Perfect Little Accident\" #24 \"Death and All His Friends\"\n\nGrey's Anatomy, Season 7 #01 \"With You I'm Born Again\" #09 \"Slow Night, So Long\" #17 \"This is How We Do It\" #02 \"Shock to the System\" #10 \"Adrift and at Peace\" #18 \"Song Beneath the Song\" #03 \"Superfreak\" #11 \"Disarm\" #19 \"It's a Long Way Back\" #04 \"Can't Fight Biology\" #12 \"Start Me Up\" #20 \"White Wedding\" #05 \"Almost Grown\" #13 \"Don't Deceive Me (Please Don't Go)\" #21 \"I Will Survive\" #06 \"These Arms of Mine\" #14 \"P.Y.T.
