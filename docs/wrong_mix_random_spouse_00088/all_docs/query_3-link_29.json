        "text": "The actress, best known at Kat Slater, will play jail matron Mama Morton\n\nEastEnders actress Jessie Wallace will take on the role of feisty Mama Morton in a new stage production of the award-winning musical Chicago when it comes to Liverpool this autumn.\n\nThe soap favourite, best known for playing Albert Square’s Kat Slater, will play the no-nonsense corrupt matron of the county jail block who reminds female inmates ‘When you’re good to Mama, Mama’s good to you!’”\n\n‌\n\nREAD MORE: EastEnders actress joins Wizard of Oz cast in St Helens\n\nShe will star alongside John Partridge as Billy Flynn, Hayley Tamaddon as Roxie Hart and Sophie Carmen-Jones as Velma Kelly in the show which will run for a week at the Empire from Monday September 12 to Saturday September 17.\n\n‌\n\nLiverpool Echo Icon\n\nSign up to FREE email alerts from ECHO Daily News\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you’ve consented to and improve our understanding of you.

A sell-out hit, it is currently playing in New York where it holds the record as the longest running musical revival and also the second longest running musical in Broadway history.\n\n‌\n\n‌\n\nAs the tough but sexy Mama Morton, Jessie - whose stage credits include Rent Remixed in the West End - will follow in the footsteps of Queen Latifah who played the role in the multi-Oscar winning film version, and Modern Family’s Sofia Vergara who made her Broadway debut as Mama in 2009."
