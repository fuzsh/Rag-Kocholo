        "text": "The Institute has released a new edition of The Essays of A.J. Muste, first published in 1967. The twenty-eight essays in this nearly 600-page volume are presented as written during the many decades of A.J. Muste’s activism. “Sketches for an Autobiography” eloquently describes his life as a radical pacifist, political organizer, minister and pragmatic philosopher. There are entertaining and historically important accounts of his work with other civil rights, antiwar, and labor leaders and of his international travels to promote peace. The essays paint a clear picture of how Mr. Muste and the pacifist left became the “glue” that held so many, often disparate, factions together during many era’s of progressive organizing in the United States. His political analyses make an excellent foundation for both studying and building effective movements for peace and social justice.\n\nOn the current edition:\n\n“Muste did not write to be studied in the abstract. The Essays call to the conscience of each reader to engage in ‘responsible living . . . being engaged in the struggle against injustice and tyranny’ as he expressed in his ‘Sketches for an Autobiography.’ When Muste died, the notice read: ‘in lieu of flowers, friends are requested to get out and work-for peace, human rights, for a better world.’ This reissue of his Essays is a fitting way to renew that request.” - Jo Ann Ooiman Robinson, from her Preface\n\nOn the first edition:\n\n“A.J. Muste stands out in our time, and I believe that he will stand out in history, as a great leader of a pacifism which is anything but passive. He is a man who believes that real victories for peace and social justice must, and can, be won by nonviolent means. This book . . . vividly illustrates the change and growth in thought of a man whose steadfastness of purpose and dedication to his fellow men were constant.” - Norman Thomas\n\n“Historians of the future who want to know what it meant to live with integrity in the twentieth-century era of wars and revolutions will very likely begin with the life of A.J. Muste. He has confronted the violence which threatens to destroy us with the whole of his life. I am one of the many who has learned from him the virtues of grace under pressure, and how to bring to bear wit and compassion simultaneously.” - Staughton Lynd\n\n“To our most bitter opponents we say: ‘We shall match your capacity to inflict suffering by our capacity to endure suffering. We shall meet your physical force with soul force. Do to us what you will, and we shall continue to love you. We cannot in all good conscience obey your unjust laws, because noncooperation with evil is as much a moral obligation as is cooperation with good. Throw us in jail, and we shall still love you. Bomb our homes and threaten our children, and we shall still love you. Send your hooded perpetrators of violence into our community at the midnight hour and beat us and leave us half dead, and we shall still love you. But be ye assured that we will wear you down by our capacity to suffer. One day we shall win freedom, but not only for ourselves. We shall so appeal to your heart and conscience that we shall win you in the process, and our victory will be a double victory.'” (from “Loving Your Enemies”)\n\n“I have paid no poll-tax for six years. I was put into a jail once on this account, for one night; and, as I stood considering the walls of solid stone, two or three feet thick, the door of wood and iron, a foot thick, and the iron grating which strained the light, I could not help being struck with the foolishness of that institution which treated me as if I were mere flesh and blood and bones, to be locked up. I wondered that it should have concluded at length that this was the best use it could put me to, and had never thought to avail itself of my services in some way. I saw that, if there was a wall of stone between me and my townsmen, there was a still more difficult one to climb or break through, before they could get to be as free as I was.”\n\n“The other day one of these lorries was drawn by a team of buffaloes instead of horses. I had never seen the creatures close at hand before. ... They are black, and have huge, soft eyes. The buffaloes are war trophies from Rumania. The soldier-drivers said that it was very difficult to catch these animals, which had always run wild, and still more difficult to break them in to harness. ... Unsparingly exploited, yoked to heavy loads, they are soon worked to death. The other day a lorry came laden with sacks, so overladen indeed that the buffaloes were unable to drag it across the threshold of the gate. The soldier-driver, a brute of a fellow, belabored the poor beasts so savagely with the butt end of his whip that the wardress at the gate, indignant at the sight, asked him if he had no compassion for animals. “No more than anyone has compassion for us men,” he answered with an evil smile, and redoubled his blows. ... The one that was bleeding had an expression on its black face and in its soft black eyes like that of a weeping child—one that has been severely thrashed and does not know why, nor how to escape from the torment of ill-treatment. ... The suffering of a dearly loved brother could hardly have moved me more profoundly than I was moved by my impotence in face of this mute agony. ... Poor wretch, I am as powerless, as dumb, as yourself; I am at one with you in my pain, my weakness, and my longing.”\n\n“In the geography class, we learned as children how to bound the country in which we live. By the map we were taught to orientate ourselves nationally. To most of us those boundary lines and coast lines still represent the limits of our country, and we feel that we have no concern with what lies beyond them. At any rate, we rested in that illusion until the bitter awakening which recently overtook us. It seems now that we must forthwith go to school again and learn about boundaries in a wholly different kind of way, namely, that they do not represent the end of the good citizen’s responsibility but also a beginning. Boundaries are contacts as well as limits. At what point do the interests of our country meet and possibly conflict with those of other countries? What are our real interests anyway and are they worth a war for their protection? And are the interests in question those of the nation as a whole or merely those of a small group of men or even of a single man? Are such clashes anyway settled better by heat and conflict or by a reasonable adjustment?”\n\n—Jeannette Rankin, “Peace and the Disarmament Conference” (In “Two Votes Against War” and Other Writings on Peace)"
