        "text": "She may have a tumultuous romantic life on TV but Jessie Wallace is about to get her happily ever after it seems.\n\nIt had been recently reported that the EastEnders actress was engaged to her boyfriend of one year, Justin Gallwey.\n\nToday's top videos\n\nThe actress, who is best-known for playing Kat Slater in the BBC One soap, appeared to confirm that the rumours are true with her latest picture.\n\nIn the image, the couple looked very much loved-up as they enjoyed a trip to the beach together.\n\n'My fiancé and moi. ❤️,' she announced in the caption.\n\nRumours had begun to swirl last summer that the soap star had actually secretly tied the knot with the carpenter just two months into their relationship.\n\nRecent images obtained by The Sun reignited engagement rumours as the 51-year-old TV star was spotted rocking a dazzling diamond ring on that finger after leaving a supermarket in North London.\n\nThe publication wrote at the time that the couple were 'getting hitched after at least a year together'.\n\nShe had been 'proudly' wearing her ring, a source close to the happy couple also told The Sun.\n\nJessie and Justin are said to have known each other since they were teenagers and in the past he has described their relationship as being a 'close' one.\n\nShe had fans asking if they had already said their 'I do's' after she shared a sweet picture of them cosied up in a pub where she called him 'her hubby'.\n\nJessie has had a number of boyfriends in the past and she was previously engaged to catering boss Vince Morse.\n\nShe called off their wedding in 2011 just hours before she was due to walk down the aisle after she learnt that he had sent explicit images of her to his ex-girlfriend."
