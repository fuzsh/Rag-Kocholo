        "text": "EastEnders actress Jessie Wallace has confirmed that she is engaged to carpenter Justin Gallwey.\n\nWallace, who has played Kat Slater on the BBC One soap on and off since 2000, uploaded a photo to her Instagram yesterday (February 19), confirming that they are planning to tie the knot.\n\n\"My fianc√© and moi,\" she wrote in the caption, alongside a picture of the couple together.\n\nRelated: Former EastEnders star Nigel Harman reflects on Dennis Rickman's death\n\nA number of EastEnders co-stars shared well wishes in the comments, with Lacey Turner posting a number of heart emojis and Emma Barton saying: \"Beautiful (heart emoji)\".\n\nEmmerdale's Lisa Riley wrote: \"CONGRATULATIONS (clapping hands emojis). Great news (heart emojis)\", while Tamzin Outhwaite added: \"Congratulations darling. Happy days ahead which you deserve (heart emojis).\"\n\nLast year, Wallace posted a photo in which she called Gallwey her \"hubby\" leading some to speculate that they had already got married, but the latest post confirms that the happy day is yet to take place.\n\nAt the moment on the soap, Kat and Phil Mitchell recently had a disastrous attempt at a wedding, but scenes due to air this week will see them set another date for their big day. Will it go better the next time around, considering the current rough patch it's going through?\n\nRelated: EastEnders reveals huge new spoilers for anniversary episode\n\nMeanwhile, in real-life, current EastEnders guest star Patsy Kensit announced over the weekend that she has also recently got engaged, sharing a photo of a beach proposal by Patric Cassidy and a short video joking about the weight of her huge diamond engagement ring.\n\nEastEnders airs on Mondays - Thursdays at 7.30pm on BBC One. The show also streams on BBC iPlayer."
