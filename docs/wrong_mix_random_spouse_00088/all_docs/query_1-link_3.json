        "text": "Ever wonder how a surgeon prepares for heart surgery? I loved learning more about our new Chief of Cardiac Surgery, Dr. Pierre Voisine, and his process. Read the full letter from Dr. Voisine here and learn more below: https://lnkd.in/ekh4SVYD #ottawa #cardiaccare\n\nHappy National Nurses Week! I loved working on this profile. Read here: https://lnkd.in/g3ffXrxt It is said that if you save one life, you’re a hero. But if you save 100 lives, you’re a nurse. This National Nursing Week, we honour our exceptional, smart, and hardworking cardiac nurses The University of Ottawa Heart Institute Foundation University of Ottawa Heart Institute It just so happens that Nursing Week also overlaps with Mother’s Day. We're thrilled to highlight veteran nurses and mothers whose children are following their footsteps at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute, like Alyssa, a new nurse here. Alyssa practically grew up at the Heart Institute, assisting her aunt Erika, a former nursing manager, by filling up the patient's water glasses during her visits. The Grass Family graciously matches gifts for both Mother’s Day and National Nurses Week. Donate today: bit.ly/NursingWeek2024 #cardiaccare #ottawa #nationalnursingweek #mothersday Erika MacPhee\n\nIn this photo, my husband Scott was dazzled by my athleticism (I'm completely kidding). We had the best time this past Sunday at the second annual Ottawa Pickleball Classic The University of Ottawa Heart Institute Foundation I was a complete beginner, and I'm thankful for the great people I played with and got to hear their heart story. What a beautiful event benefiting cardiac care, education, and research University of Ottawa Heart Institute. Huge kudos. I can't wait until next year.
