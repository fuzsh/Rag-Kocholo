        "text": "Meet Sarah Jesse, the new campus minister for the Baldwin Wallace Campus. Sarah is actually returning to her hometown diocese. She grew up in Westlake, OH and earned both her Bachelor Degree in Theology and Psychology and an Master of Art in Theology from the University of Notre Dame. Prior to coming back to the Cleveland area, Sarah worked as a rector for a women’s residence hall at the University of Notre Dame. Prior to that, she served a chaplaincy at the University College Cork in Ireland.\n\nWhen asked why she chose Newman Campus Ministry, Sarah answered, “I love working in universities, where students encounter new ideas & identities and open a new chapter of personal growth. It is such an exciting atmosphere, and I believe that it is crucial to bring all of this discovery to the Lord, Who Is a Mystery of Love, and to keep God up to date with who you are and who you are becoming. Adult faith takes curiosity and community, and Newman is just the place to engage both!”\n\nSarah joins the team that includes A.J. Hoy at College of Wooster and Oberlin College, Sarah Rose at Cleveland State, John Szarwark at University of Akron, Nate Ediger at Ashland University, and Steve Perry at Case Western Reserve University."
