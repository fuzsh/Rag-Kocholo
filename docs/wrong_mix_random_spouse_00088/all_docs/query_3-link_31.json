Resisting war requires that we trust each other, know each other, and share alignment in values.\n\nAs we move into our 97th year we want to know more about what you care about, how you’re engaging in antiwar work, and what your hopes and dreams are.\n\nTo help us celebrate our birthday this year, will you take 4-5 minutes to take our membership survey?\n\nBe one of the first 97 people to respond and we'll enter 12 tickets to our 32nd Annual Raffle for Resistance in your name. See below for prizes and more details!\n\nThanks for helping us celebrate 97 years of resistance and for all you do!\n\nIn Solidarity,\n\nEmma\n\nFrom vintage movement memorabilia to popular education packages and a weekend getaway, our raffle is a WRL community staple and grassroots fundraiser we’re glad you participate in each year!
