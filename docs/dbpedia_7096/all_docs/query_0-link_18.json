        "text": "Tax Inequities: The Case of Foreign vs. U.S. Cruise Lines\n\n1593 Words | 4 Pages\n\nCurrently, foreign cruise liners operate almost completely outside of the scope of the U.S. tax system, and this arguably has a discriminatory impact on U.S. cruise lines. Generally, if a foreign corporation is deemed to have a permanent establishment in the United States, they are subject to a tax on the portion of their income that is attributable to the U.S. For example, if a foreign clothing company, had just one small store in Miami where there could be “continuous and systematic” presence, it would be viewed to have a permanent establishment and taxed 30%. Since foreign cruise corporations fall into the category of “shipping,” the headquarters they have in the U.S. aren’t considered a permanent establishment. Therefore, the U.S. isn’t\n\nSummary Of Maureen Montgomery's Natural Distinction\n\n572 Words | 2 Pages\n\nSubsequently, many of the upper class subjugated various forms of cultural capital to expand social distinction and prestige to their financial fortunes. The “culturally rich” embraced this lifestyle of extravagance, luxury, and travel as a means to climb up the social ladder. As the popularity of these transatlantic voyages grew, European travel quintessentially became the Bourgeois experience and a common manner of discovering the American heritage. These prevalent excursions grew into a means of breaking the monotony of everyday life and an “instrument of social leverage in a ferociously competitive economy” by the end of the eighteen seventies (9). Montgomery goes on to describe the sheer paradox of the American excursions with her depiction of two American women traveling through southern Italy. She uses their offensive description of the local inhabitants as “dirty, shiftless, and dishonest” to show the sheer irony that came with these extravagant and prodigal trips (9). In doing so, she is able to quickly uncover the underlying issues that resonated at home during this time and the sheer arrogance that followed the American Bourgeois\n\nThe Shipwreck Sailor Case Study\n\n1714 Words | 4 Pages\n\nIn the first case the judge would like to show the 3 men sympathy but he believes he isn’t above the law, he sentences the death penalty. The philosophical label of this judge is legal positivism. One thing that the judge says to back this up is “As much as I would personally wish that these men could return to their families and put this tragic event behind them, I cannot permit them to do so. I am not free to make the law”. This quote showed that this judge was a legal positivist because he says that he wants to show them sympathy and let them return to their families, but he is not free to make the law and he is not above the law. Another quote to back this up is “I have sworn an oath to apply the law that authorized legislators have enacted”. Similar to the last quote, the judge is showing that whether he wants to be sympathetic or not he cannot because he has sworn an oath to the law that he cannot break. One weakness of this theoretical approach is that it is very ruthless. These men did not have a choice, killing Ozzie was the only way for the men to\n\nImmigration To American Immigration\n\n1787 Words | 4 Pages\n\n“The open deck space reserved for steerage passengers is usually very limited, and situated in the worst part of the ship, subject to the most violent motion, to the dirt from the stacks and the odors from the hold and galleys... the only provisions for eating are frequently shelves or benches along the sides or in the passages of sleeping compartments. Dining rooms are rare and, if found, are often shared with berths installed along the walls. Toilets and washrooms are completely inadequate; saltwater only is available.” (Hillstrom)\n\nDhow Cruise: Why You Cannot Miss It !\n\n763 Words | 2 Pages\n\nDhows are the traditional vessels that are remodeled to meet the needs of modern day travelers.

Currently, SGC is only advertising to travel agencies. Coupled with segmentation, SGC’s current advertising strategy has hurt SGC in the sense that consumer awareness is considerably low. Only a small portion of the population even knows that Sea Goddess exists. SGC is only targeting those who travel frequently. They may want to target the portion of the population that wants to travel, but is unsure of where to go or what to do. In order for SGC to reach the consumer, new efforts must be made in the advertising plan. Mere travel agency recommendations are not going to be enough to keep SGC alive in the marketplace. Other vehicles are going to be necessary to spread SGC’s message about the luxuries and benefits of this extraordinary cruise. At the present time, only a small number of all travel agencies have the sufficient knowledge that it takes to make an informative sell to the consumer. It may be profitable for SGC to employ some hi...\n\nMaldives Transport And Contracting Company Case Study\n\n1237 Words | 3 Pages\n\nMaldives Transport and Contracting Company, (MTCC) was incorporated in 1980.

The once brisk morning was getting hotter by the second. My friend Kristi and I looked towards our left and there she was, the Norwegian Sea. The cruise liner that we would be on for the next week. It was the biggest ship I had ever seen up close. Ten stories high and nearly 1000 feet long. It had an intimidating presence that took one's breath away."
