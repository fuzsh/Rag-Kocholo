        "text": "At the beginning of the 1950s, Britain still had significant commitments, both politically and strategically, throughout the Far East, East Africa and the Mediterranean. To transport service personnel between Britain and the Empire, a fleet of troopships was managed by British shipping companies on behalf of the Ministry of Transport. Many of these troop transports were ageing German war prizes, whilst the remainder were pre-war British vessels.\n\nIn 1952 the British Government entered into an agreement with the British India Steam Navigation Company and the Bibby Line to replace and supplement these vessels. Each company would build a ship specifically for the transport of troops and their families. The first ship to enter service was British India's Nevasa. The Oxfordshire, built for the Bibby Line, began her career on 13 February 1957.\n\nThe Oxfordshire had accommodation for 1,000 troops and 500 dependents. The cabin accommodation could be divided into three classes when fare-paying passengers were carried. The troop accommodation was superior to that of any previous British troopship, with three-tiered bunks replacing hammocks and much greater space for exercise and recreation. Given that it was intended that the Oxfordshire would spend much time in the Far East, special attention was paid to the ventilation system, although only the hospital spaces were actually air-conditioned.\n\nOn her completion for the Bibby Line, she was placed on a 20-year charter to the Ministry of Transport. In 1962, after a mere five years' duty, her trooping career came to an abrupt end. The British Government decided that all future troop movements would be made by air. The contract with the Bibby Line was prematurely cancelled, and she carried her last troops from Malta to Southampton in December 1962. She was laid up in the River Fal, and the Bibby Line advertised her for charter or for sale.\n\nIn May 1963 the Sitmar Line took her on a six-year charter with an option to purchase, and the almost new liner was placed on the UK-Australia service for assisted-passage migrants. She was refitted at the Wilton-Fijenoord N.V. shipyard in Holland for Â£2.3 million and was renamed Fairstar. In March 1964, Sitmar purchased the ship outright from the Bibby Line. This was to overcome the stipulation in the charter party which stated that British officers and Indian seamen must crew the ship during the term of the charter.\n\nShe made four return voyages each year via the Suez Canal, carrying 1,868 passengers, all in one class. She had a crew of 460, and full air-conditioning had been installed. With the closure of the Suez Canal in 1967, the Fairstar made her southbound voyage via the Cape of Good Hope, returning to the UK via the Panama Canal.\n\nEvery five years the Australian Government put the contract for the carriage of British migrants out to tender. Sitmar had held the contract since 1955, but in 1970 the Chandris Line was successful. At a stroke Fairstar had lost the bulk of her southbound passengers. Worse still, on the assumption that it would retain the contract, Sitmar had just purchased Cunard's redundant Carinthia and Sylvania to add to capacity on the Australian migrant trade.\n\nInitially Fairstar remained on her regular route from the UK to Australia carrying fare-paying passengers, but from September 1973 she was switched to full-time cruising from Australia with restricted passenger numbers of 1,280.\n\nIn the 1990s, now operated by P&O, Fairstar suffered from increasing mechanical problems brought on by her advancing years, but she consistently retained her position as the most successful cruise ship operating from Australia.\n\nIn April 1996 it became clear that large sums of money would need to be spent on her engines if she were to remain in service, and there would be further expense in bringing the old ship up to the standards required by new SOLAS regulations. P&O therefore reluctantly decided to retire her on 31 January 1997.\n\nShe is seen here in Southampton, tied up adjacent to Mayflower Park.

Perhaps more fortytwenty or twentythrice! But then I can't remember what it felt to be like when I was twenty, or forty....or fifty nine. Perhaps my mind is going. But it is a number that makes you stop and think. Eric Bristow, five times World Darts Champion died yesterday. Dropped dead aged 60. Ray Wilkins, football legend, died a few days earlier aged 61. Both had heart attacks. It's on my mind. Ok, no, I'm not about to write my own obituary (I hope), but I thought I might just summarize where the last sixty years went because I can't remember it all.\n\nI don't feel that old, but on those online pages you fill in for some official application or form where you have to scroll back to your date of birth I'm finding it seems an indecent long way I have to scroll down the page, and continue off the bottom of the page to find the year 1958. Wow, weren't things different then?\n\nI was born in the stunning village of Richmond, North Yorkshire, with its huge 950 year old Norman fortress. My father was a Royal Signals officer, based at Catterick garrison. But military life in those days was such that after a short life in two different homes there we took the great HMT (Her Majesty's Troopship) \"Nevasa\" all the way to Singapore via every British Empire dominion on the way: Gibraltar, Malta, Cyprus, Suez (Egypt), Aden (Yemen), Bombay (Mumbai, India), Colombo (Ceylon/Sri Lanka), Rangoon (Burma/Myanmar), Port Klang in Malaysia and down to Singapore.\n\nI was just a baby and my fair skin was often sunburnt under the blazing sun where we lived on the Equator. I started to walk and swim there and spotty and jerky cine films my dad made showed me enjoying playing in my pedal car, which I never pedalled and always 'drove' backwards. It also shows my mother doing speed trials in our family car, tight manoeuvres in and out of cones, with short sprints against the clock. I was brought up loving the thrill of speed. At that time my father also raced in the Singapore Grand Prix, but it was a very different event to today's Formula One!\n\nI believe we had four different homes in Singapore. Although my father was an Army Officer, he spent long periods with the Royal Air Force flying in Shackleton maritime patrol aircraft out over the South China Sea, as the RAF were short of radio officers and my father had the necessary skills. He also killed a venomous snake that came into the house and was making its way across the carpet towards me.\n\nAfter four years we flew back to Britain on a Britannia turbo prop aircraft. I don't know how many stops there were on the way or how long it took, but it was a slow aircraft, at least 200mph slower than today's jets. And of course everyone could smoke as much as they liked so that your arms sat in the overflowing ashtrays.\n\nBack in Britain we were posted to the little town of Tywyn in mid Wales where my father was adjutant at the nearby Tonfanau camp. Boys of 15 could leave school and join the Army, finishing off education whilst training as Junior Leaders. It was a way in which boys struggling with their direction in life could be given some self respect and discipline and make them into men who could lead by example. I went to school in Tywyn and remember trying to learn Welsh. Our large Army detached house on Morfa Crescent still stands, with a fantastic view out towards the almost 3000 feet tall Cadair Idris mountain. I still remember the fish and chip van, playing on the beach, collecting fallen coal by the railway line, and taking the train to the bookshop in Barmouth. I also remember my time in Aberystwyth hospital where I nearly died from blood loss after a botched operation to remove my tonsils and adenoids, as was standard practice in those days.\n\nBut soon we were on the move again, and we were based in four places in northern Germany......four more different homes in Minden, Bad Oeynhausen, Bunde and Lubbecke. I think in those years I never really settled at school. I barely remember any of them. Not the teachers, not even any friends, with the possible exception of one boy called Simon Panton, who I have never heard of since. I certainly can't visualise any of the schools or even any brief friends I might have had. Life was so transient. We lived in Army housing estates, nice spacious houses, but we didn't mix with the German kids and certainly not with the Russian military and their families who lived in 'hostage' enclaves near us, like human shields in the event of war. And we were right in the front line of the Cold War at that time of my life, where all the Forces did regular turnouts to exercise for immediate action on a regular basis. It used to be quite a sight, endless convoys of trucks and armoured vehicles heading out of base to their battle positions. What do I remember from Germany? Nice ice cream, trying on lederhosen, playing in the woods, my bicycles, grey towns, the adult's Sunday lunch drinks parties after church, learning a bit of German, hot summers swimming outdoors, great sledging in winter. And long, long car journeys from Germany to Caithness and back to visit my mother's parents in either a Rover P5 or Austin Westminster\n\nAnd I remember starting prep school at Brambletye in Sussex at the age of nine, and flying to and from Germany on my own, to stay at school normally 3 months, sometimes more, without seeing my parents at all. My time spent at Brambletye is written up elsewhere on flickr and mysteriously has accumulated over a million views.\n\nWhilst I was at school in West Sussex my parents and brothers moved again, this time to Dorset where my father was based at Royal Signals HQ in Blandford. I remember a very modern house there and a very chalky landscape but not much else. But it was also whilst I was at boarding school that my parents moved from Dorset nearly 800 miles north to Caithness in the extreme north of Scotland. My father left the army and became a farmer, on the farm that my grandfather, and my great grandfather, and his father farmed on, called North Calder. Having lived in so many different places this became the place I finally called 'home', the place where I had time with my parents, and brothers, to grow up in a stable family and the wild expanse of barren Caithness on the doorstep.\n\nBy the age of 13 I was finished at Prep School and my class mates moved on, many to elite private schools such as Eton, Westminster, Harrow, Wellington, etc. I went to Thurso High School comprehensive. But I was lucky. This was the nuclear age, and at nearby Dounreay Britain's best nuclear physicists and engineers were being sucked in to develop the worlds first Fast Breeder reactor and engines for nuclear submarines. I was phased into the top stream at school with all the sons and daughters of these brilliant minds, and whilst always towards the lower end of that 'A' stream class the standard was so high that something like 30 out 32 went to University and that was back in 1975 when there were only five Universities in Scotland. I grew up a farmer's son, heavily involved from the age of 13 in harvesting work, feeding and managing the livestock. The landscape was open. Wild sea to the north stretching all the way to the North Pole, and a line of mountains to the south. Mid summer days were so long, yet mid winter so dark, wet and cold. It is one of the windiest places in the world. But whilst life up there was brilliant for a soul that loved freedom, I could never chain myself to a farm for ever. I wanted to travel.\n\nBut I went to University like all the others, but all it did was make me decide I couldn't take any more of being in a classroom. Fortunately my lack of focus on studies meant I only stayed a year and that forced my hand. I wanted an adventure. In our family every other male before me had stood in uniform, and it was natural for me, partly with my military style upbringing at boarding school, to look to the Forces for a career. I really wanted to be a pilot, a fast jet pilot, hugging the contours of the land at high speed as was the tactic of those days to get under the radar. I knew I would qualify as a pilot on pretty well every criteria but to my dismay I found that the distance from my elbow to fingertip was a fraction outside the limit prescribed to ensure I could operate every control whilst strapped in an ejector seat in a high G turn. But I was also extremely keen to be an Infantry Regiment officer and again I knew all I had to do was apply. But by this time the Army was facing severe cutbacks and there wasn't such an allure to patrolling the streets of Belfast during the Troubles. I wanted to see the world.\n\nAnd so I joined the Merchant Navy as a trainee Deck Officer (Navigator). Sure enough it gave me the travel and adventure I had dreamt of, seeing amazing sights, experiencing wondrous events and weather, and taking me literally to every corner of the world. I had no idea that some of those experiences would even ensure that the BBC and numerous newsmedia would keep coming back to me repeatedly for forty years looking for new angles on some of the stories I was involved in. But in all it meant that by the age of 22 I had already been to well over 50 different countries in North, South and Central America, Africa, Europe, Scandinavia, Middle East, Asia and Australia, New Zealand, and with a crew, top news story in the UK.\n\nIt had been quite a journey to get to that point, But that was the first third of my life. What's happened in the last two thirds? Where have I been, what have I done? In some ways it has been the 'consolidation' phase of my life. A hazy rush of work, wife, family and more work. But now at the age of 60 that part is coming to an end. It's the next bit I have to work on now. The end game, the last chance to have fun and enjoy myself. And do it before I end up like Eric Bristow and Ray Wilkins. I must. I've got just one life!\n\nWho am I? With an English father and a Scottish mother, born in Yorkshire and having lived so far in 26 different places that have been my 'home', I can only call myself 'British'.\n\nWhat am I?\n\nI'm still just a boy.\n\nPS. I feel like I want to have the life of the 100 year old man who jumped out of the window and disappeared. If you have never read the book I can't recommend it highly enough. Adventure. Exploratation. Humour. Chance, opportunity and coincidence. An amazing life. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hundred-Year-Old_Man_Who_Climbe...\n\nHaven't seen the movie, for those who don't have sufficient time or imagination, but it looks quite amusing too: www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-k7DUQPHfQ\n\nGold finger ring from Ancient India. Kushan period, early 3rd century AD. Solid gold ring, of typical Roman shape, fabricated rather than cast. The intaglio bezel was made separately and carefully fitted into the ring (the join visible only in a slightly damaged area on the edge of the bezel). The bezel is decorated with vis-Ã -vis portraits of Septimius Severus (laureate head left) and Julia Domna (draped bust right with elaborate coiffure), beneath which is a Gupta Brahmi inscription in a characteristic square-serif style: Damputrasya Dhanguptasya ([Seal of] Dhangupta son of Dama). Very fine condition, a slight edge bruise, matte surface characteristic of river deposition.\n\nThe use of gold, the method of fabrication, and the fine quality of the engraving all suggest than the owner was a person of significant wealth and position. The portraits of the imperial couple are reminiscent of Severusâ dynastic coin designs, although this actual design does not appear on his coins. The use of imperial portraits may reflect the ownerâs relationship, perhaps as a client, to the emperor. The characteristic surface texture, indicating deposition in water, suggests that the ring may have been formally dedicated, perhaps in a holy river, once it had outlived its original function.\n\nThere was a tradition in north West India for Greek rulers to adopt Indian names. King Menander was called Milinda, and is referred to as such in the famous Milindapanha. Similarly, Demetrios is called Dattamitri, Appollodotus is Apaladatas, Azes is Aya, Azilezes is Ayilisha, and Gondophares is Devarata Gudupphara. Therefore, it is not unlikely that the Damaputrasya on this ring meant the son of Dama or, more appropriately, the son of Domna -- Julia Domna herself whose picture is in situ. This meaning of Dama as Domna is also supported by the fact that the word Dama means money in the Indian language, and such a name was not given to a person. The full name containing the word Dama could be Damabhadra or Damamitra, but never just Dama. The important person, the owner of the ring, thus associates himself with the Roman imperial family.\n\nRoman trade in India was on large scale during the Severan period. Periplus says that the traders of the Roman Empire exported gold and silver bullion to the coastal parts of the Indian peninsula. In addition, Roman coins were exported for use by the Roman traders. This does not prove that Roman coins could never have been used as bullion, but suggests that Roman coinage was required for some specific purposes. The Yavana traders were not content to carry merchandise to the Indian harbors and return with products of Indian origin; they also maintained actual settlements in various ports of southern India, which were emporia, oriental market towns, lying on or near the seacoast. These prosperous settlements can be compared with the factories established by European traders in India during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Archaeological and epigraphic evidence has verified at least two of these settlements: Pondicherry (Arikamedu), identified as the Podouke emporia referred to by Ptolemy, and Muziris, where the Peutinger â Tables (AD 222) record that the Romans had built a temple of Augustus and maintained a force of two cohorts to protect their trade. The latter shows the nature of the authority of the Roman traders over the emporia.\n\nArchaeological discoveries from a number of sites in Deccan and the extreme South distinctly reveal the impact of Roman trade on contemporary society. Finds at Arikamedu include amphorae and Arretine Ware (which led Wheeler to pinpoint the period of trade activity at this South Indian port to the first centuries BC-AD); a warehouse with Roman jars (which chemical examination has shown to possibly have contained wine of Italian origin), Roman lamps, and glassware; and gems carved with intaglios, some of which were signed by Graeco-Roman gem-cutters (suggesting presence of Western craftsman at the site). Finds of Rouleted Ware are quite significant, as it was a technique that influenced the style of pottery in India over a wide area, particularly the coastal regions. All of these finds suggest a substantial influence of the Mediterranean world resulting from trade.\n\nOn the western coast there is considerable evidence of Roman contact that can be inferred from archaeological finds. Pottery specimens of Roman origin or ceramics influenced by Roman types have been recovered from the early centuries of the Christian era at Nasik, Baroda, Akota, Bhokardan, Kolhapur, Malwer, Nagara, Nevasa, Shamlaji, Deoni Mori, and Ter. Objects such as amphorae, Red Polished Ware, Samian Ware, Rouletted Ware, Roman glass, Roman lamps, figures of Eros, caltrops (the peculiar painted spike of the Roman world), bronze statuettes of Poseidon, and the presence of Graeco-Roman artistic features on local art and architecture at some of these sites are conclusive evidence of the influence of Mediterranean culture on life in the southwestern parts of the peninsula. Only the constant presence of a Graeco-Roman community over a wide area for a considerable period of time can satisfactorily account for such an impact. Similarly, finds at sites in the south and southeast, like Dharanikota, Yeleswaram, Uraiyur, Kanchipuram, Alagarai, and Kaveripattinam, display the influence of Roman techniques on some of the local pottery types, and likewise testify to the power of the Graeco-Roman culture.\n\nThe Graeco-Roman trading communities maintained cordial relations with the local rulers, the Satavahanas, Cheras, Cholas, and Pandyas. Nevertheless, the long presence of these settlements, with their protective garrisons of troops, exhibited a superior military strength that could have easily led the monarchs of South India to be intimidated by their might, similar to the reverential fear that the East India Company used to instill in the hearts of the local Indian potentates.\n\nThe rulers of Peninsular India did not have the resources to strike gold coins, or seals, and it is not unlikely that the foreign traders were allowed to use their coins to facilitate smooth and quick commercial transactions, particularly on a large scale. Similarly, the rulers may have allowed the traders to use gold seals, such as that present on this ring, to approve transactions. Comparable terracotta bullae are abundantly known from Indian sites as mentioned in the references sited below.\n\nO.
