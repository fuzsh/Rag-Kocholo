        "text": "Luxury cruise experience leader, Crystal, has signed a Memorandum of Agreement with Fincantieri to construct two new, groundbreaking ships.\n\nThe planned 690-passenger (based on double occupancy), 61,800-gross tonne ship will feature a host of amenities and innovative designs that ensure unparalleled comfort and indulgence for guests.\n\nShip designs will be led by architectural firms, Studio Ibsen and Prof. and architect Adriana Granato as well as Studio Gem headed by naval architect Giacomo Mortola and naval Engineer Lorenzo Mortola. An international design firm, yet to be appointed, will also be joining the team.\n\nInterior design will feature the precious marbles, Italian fabrics, and natural materials that offer a level of research and sophistication reserved for high-end private residential properties. A standout feature includes a promenade that extends through the ships’ perimeter for leisurely strolls.\n\nCulinary options include a variety of dining options that showcase a variety of world-class cuisines such as Umi Uma and the recently announced Beefbar. Crystal also continues its legacy of offering exclusive entertainment with a sophisticated casino that includes an array of gaming options in an elegant setting.\n\nCrystal cruises debuts new Beefbar menu\n\nShips will feature a comprehensive spa and state-of-the-art fitness centre to provide guests with wellness and relaxation options. Families with children can also take advantage of a dedicated area designed to provide a safe area for engaging activities.\n\nAccommodation on the ship features private verandas for all suite and single occupancy categories. The line said it highlights its commitment to passenger comfort, complemented by one of the highest crew-to-passenger ratios in the segment.\n\n“This order is another milestone in the 40 years of productive collaboration between Fincantieri and my family, which started with Sitmar Cruises, continued with Silversea and is now flourishing again with Crystal,” executive chairman of A&K Travel Group, Manfredi Lefebvre d’Ovidio, said.\n\nCEO of A&K Travel Group, Cristina Levis, added: “Our aim is to continue setting a new standard in cruising, offering our guests an unmatched level of service and sophistication. These new ships will receive the same level of attention I have reserved for my own house.”\n\nThe expected delivery of the first ship will be in the northern spring of 2028 with the second ship’s construction and delivery time to be announced at a later date.\n\nEmail the Travel Weekly team at traveldesk@travelweekly.com.au\n\nCrystal Fincantieri\n\nPlease wait while we sign you in with LinkedIn.\n\nThis may take some time.\n\nPlease be patient and do not refresh the page.\n\n(A new window from LinkedIn should open for you to authorize the Travel Weekly login.
