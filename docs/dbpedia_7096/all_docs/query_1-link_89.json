Gunnar Blomdahl, managing director of Stena Line said, “This investment is another stage in Stena Line’s ongoing multi million pound investment programme which aims to take the Stena Line fleet to the next level. I’m convinced that the changes on this route will be very positive for our customers between Scotland and Northern Ireland.” Before the ships are deployed on the route, both vessels will be given extensive refits to ensure that they deliver a great experience with new attractive onboard concepts for restaurants and public areas and as well as providing complete flexibility for freight operators. The upgrades will include the provision of extra deck height to cater for the trend towards higher vehicles and hauliers increased use of double-deck freight units. Dermot Cairns, Stena Line’s general manager for travel on the Irish Sea, said, “The new ships will be the largest vessels ever to operate between Scotland and Northern Ireland and will provide Stena Line with increased operational efficiency by replacing three ships with two. The unique combination of speed, capacity, increased deck height, great onboard facilities and modern ports at each end of the journey will greatly enhance the ferry travel experience for all our customers. We have a commitment at Stena Line to do travel differently; we call it Making Good Time. Modern travel doesn’t have to be stressful - it can also be fun and enjoyable.” www.stenaline.co.uk"
