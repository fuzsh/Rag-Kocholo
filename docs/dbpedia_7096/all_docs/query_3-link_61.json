Every avenue of trade is under-consumption, the contrast between the felt the stimulating influence. False hopes were activity of a year ago and the complete absence of encouraged, false ideas embraced. And in this era it now finds adequate and abundant explanation. One other point made by Mr. Whitney deserves to of unparalleled expenditure, based on expectations of everlasting advances in the stock market, there be stressed. We cannot recall that it has been occurred, not over-production, but over-consumption, raised by anyone before. Much has 'been made of the SEPT. 13 1930.] FINANCIAL CHRONICLE relative stability of commodity prices during the whole of the period when stock prices were being carried to such reckless extremes and not a few have referred to this as evidence of the soundness of underlying trade conditions. In Mr. Whitney's view, and it has much to sustain it, this vaunted stability of commodity values was itself the product of artificialty and except for the meretricious efforts to hold values at unwarranted levels, prices would unquestionably have moved lower in the ordinary course and in an orderly way. The importance of the matter lies in the fact that now that the artificial props which held up these commodity values .have been removed, the violent declines, which sum now proving so disturbing, are occurring. Here are his observations on that point: \"One element in the trade depression, as well as in the boom which preceded it, deserves more than passing consideration. I refer to the level and the trend of commodity prices. The average price of wholesale commodities proved remarkably stable from 1925 to 1929. While the price of particular commodities declined, this was currently offset by the rise in others. Students of business continually assured us that there was no commodity price inflation. Actually these commodity price averages were highly deceptive and most difficult to interpret correctly, because, while consumption during these years continued to balance production, at the same time the constant lowering of the cost of production in so many lines of business tended, with the stable price levels, to make production more and more profitable, and to place a constantly increasing premium on expanding output. As subsequent events have shown, our recent depression would have been lessened had commodity prices during these years declined more steadily than they actually did. But the resistance to such a decline in commodity prices was widespread. Great efforts were made to maintain prices by various artificial expedients. Unconsciously business drifted into an era characterized to a large extent by manipulated price levels. \"It was the artificial price structure created by such methods and not clearly revealed in the indices of commodity prices, which has been responsible for the unexpected weakness of commodity prices during recent months. Business is thus to-day paying the price for unsound attempts to maintain price levels in the face of decreasing production costs. This trying experience shows that the law of supply and demand cannot be disregarded. It also proves the necessity of free and open markets, and should force the general realization that production and consumption cannot maintain a desirable equilibrium if the usefulness of prices as the regulators of production are to be vitiated by artificial means. Living as we do in a world of rapidly changing conditions, the movements of both commodity and security prices must freely and naturally respond to the changes occurring in the production, the distribution, and the consumption of goods. Resistance to such natural price changes can in the long run only result in an economic explosion.\" No exception can be taken to the- foregoing observations of Mr. Whitney, but it does not appear to have occurred to him that except for the debauch in the stock market, and the wild era of inflation which grew out of the same, no such state of things as he describes would have been possible. Eugene Meyer has now been definitely named by President Hoover as Governor of the Federal Reserve Board in succession to Roy A. Young, who recently resigned his post. The nomination is an 1603 excellent one, and the President is to be congratulated upon having gained Mr. Meyer's consent to take the position. During and since the war Mr. Meyer has rendered creditable service—in the War Industry Board, the War Finance Corp., and the Federal Farm Loan Board; he has also shown in all these different capacities sound judgment and, what is equally important, a spirit of independence which made him impervious to outside pressure, which last should stand him in good stead as head of the Reserve Board. Not much is required of the Federal Reserve Banks at the present time. Money rates are ruling extremely low, and there is a superabundance of ordinary banking credit far in excess of needs. In these circumstances there is little occasion for resort to the use of the facilities of the Federal Reserve System. This fact should be recognized, and the Reserve authorities will be well advised if they pursue a let alone policy and stop meddling with the country's banking credit through their open market operations. They should also refrain from attempts to regulate the world's gold currents. That is no part of the functions of Reserve System and should be left to the action of the ordinary course of events, free from outside interference. The Secretary of ;the United States Treasury has the present week offered an issue of one-year Treasury certificates of indebtedness bearing only 2%70 interest—the lowest rate ever named in an issue of certificates—and has had great success in floating the issue. He offered $325,000,000, or \"thereabouts,\" and received subscriptions aggregating $1,237,000,000. At the June offering of $400,000,000 certificates running for a year the rate of interest was 2/ 78%. Such an outcome as in this instance is very gratifying, all the more so as no governmental agency suffered more severely as the result of the tension in the money market than did the United States Treasury. It is hard to believe that as recently as June of last year the Secretary of the Treasury put out an issue of certificates bearing 1 2%. The present week's issue a rate as high as 5/ was announced on Sunday night, Sept. 7, and subscription books were closed at the close of business on Tuesday, Sept. 9. The certificates are dated and bear interest from Sept. 15 1930, and mature Sept. 15 1931. In announcing the offering, one departure was made from previous practice. The Secretary announced that Treasury certificates of indebtedness of Series TS-1930 and Treasury bills dated July 14 1930, both maturing Sept. 15 1930, would be accepted in payment for the new certificates, but it was added—and that contituted the departure from custom—that \"such subscriptions would not be given preferred allotment.\" In connection with the offering it was stated that $350,000,000 of old Treasury certificates of indebtedness, about $51,000,000 in Treasury bills, and about $35,000,000 in interest payments on the public debt would be payable on Sept. 15. Another event of the week, also evidencing the ease in the money market, was the announcement which came from the Treasury Department on Wednesday that a call had been issued for the redemption 1 2% Treasury notes on Mar. 15 1931 of all of the 3/ of Series A-1930-32 and Series B4930-32. The Series A 3/ 1 2% notes were issued on Mar. 15 1927, and were made redeemable on six months' notice on any in. iterest payment date on or after Mar. 15 1930. Of 1604 FINANCIAL CHRONICLE the $1,360,456,450 originally issued, $649,076,350 remained outstanding on Sept. 1. Series B notes were issued on Sept. 15 1927 and made redeemable on six months' notice on any interest payment date on and after Sept. 15 1930. Of the $619,495,700 originally issued, there remained outstanding on Sept. 1, $500,303,700. The Secretary therefore is calling for redemption altogether over $1,149,000,000 of these 31/ 2% notes. How the means are to be provided for retiring this large amount of obligations, has not yet been announced. [voL. 131. of corn; in that year the crop was only 1,523,000,000 bushels.

There were declines in all the corn belt States excepting Nebraska and Kansas.

This was issued at Washington on Monday of the present week. A production of 14,340,000 bales of cotton from this year's growth is now indicated. The latest estimate is based on an indicated condition as of Sept. 1 of 53.2% of normal. The decline in condition during August was nine points, or from 62.2% on the first day of last month. A year ago, on Sept.1 1929, the condition of the cotton crop harvested last year was 55.4% of normal, and the decline during August was no less than 14.2 points. Yet there was no unusual suffering from drouth at that time. The estimate of the crop to be raised was then placed at 14,825,000 bales, while the actual harvest, as based on the ginnings, proved 14,828,000 bales. August is always a precarious month for the cotton crop, and a decline of 10 or 15 points in the condition of the crop is no unusual occurrence. If the drouth this year had any effect on cotton beyond what is ordinarily to be expected in August, there is no sign of it in the latest return. The probable yield per acre is put at 153.2 pounds, against 155 pounds last year and 155.1 pounds the 10-year average. The abandonment of acreage since the July 1 estimate for this year is estimated at only 2.2% as compared with 3.5% the 10-year average covering the same period. Allowing for the abandonment of acreage this year, the area remaining for picking is now placed at 44,791,000 acres. That the production this year may be in excess of the September estimate is not at all improbable, for such was the case in eight of the 10 years prior to 1930, and in two years, 1925 and 1926, the final yields were considerably more than 2,000,000 bales higher than the September estimate. Last year the area harvested was 45,981,000 acres, but the area planted in that year was unusually large, being close to the record of 1926. As to the important cotton States, the condition is reported very low in Louisiana, Arkansas, and Oklahoma, and the decline during August in condition for these three States was quite marked, but was exceptionally heavy in Arkansas and Oklahoma, with a much lower production indicated than last year. Texas shows a slight reduction in condition during August, but still leaving it higher than a year ago and close to the 10-year average. Furthermore, the area left for picking for Texas as of Sept. 1 this year shows an increase over Aug. 1. The estimated production for that State, however, is now somewhat less than was promised a month ago, though considerably above last year's harvest. Picking in that State is now progressing actively, and ginning figures are exceptionally high. There is no telling what the production of cotton in Texas is to be until picking is completed, which not infrequently continues through the winter months into the spring. Some falling off in condition during August occurred in the Atlantic coast States and in Alabama and Mississippi, but the decline was below the average. For most of the States last mentioned production promises very well, especially for Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi. Boll weevil activity, the Department reports, has generally been held in check by the hot, dry weather. The loss this year from weevil promises to be less than in any previous year reported, excepting only 1925, when the reported reduction in yield due to weevil was 4.1%. In the Carolinas weevil are present in considerable numbers, but this is the exception. The crop generally 1605 is maturing and opening quite rapidly, and some unripe bolls are opening prematurely, especially in the central parts of the belt, due to dry weather. Ginnings to Sept. 1 this year are 1,878,253 bales against 1,568,434 bales a year ago, and 956,577 bales in the corresponding period of 1928. Insolvenciel continue very numerous, and the number for August is in excess of the previous record for that month. Total liabilities are also heavy, although in August they are somewhat smaller than for most of the earlier months of this year. The number of mercantile defaults in the United States for the month just closed, as shown by the records of R. G. Dun & Co., was 1,913, involving $49,180,653 of indebtedness; for August a year ago the number was 1,762, and the liabilities P3,746,452. The increase in the number for August of 8.6% over that of last year compares with an increase of 13% for the eight months of 1930 in the comparison with the corresponding period of 1929. In this there is seen some improvement for the month just closed. Furthermore,1,913 insolvencies in August this year compares with 2,028 for July, a decrease of 5.6% for the latest month. Ordinarily commercial failures in August are smaller in number than in July as well as for each of the preceding months back to the first of the year. Such happens to be the case this year, though for August of 1929 there was a small increase over the preceding month. For the eight months of this year commercial failures in the United States numbered 17,712 against 15,686 for the same period in 1929, while the liabilities this year to date of $425,096,153 compare with $298,300,907 a year ago.. The increase for August this year over the report for that month in 1929 applies to both the manufacturing and trading divisions, but as to the indebtedness it is mainly in the first mentioned class that a marked increase is shown. For the month just closed there were 566 manufacturing defaults involving $22,734,635 of liabilities; 1,234 trading failures owing $17,829,159, and 113 insolvencies in the division embracing agents and brokers for $8,616,859. In August of last year the manufacturing defaults numbered 482, involving $13,856,696; trading failures, 1,163 for $16,001,656, and agents and brokers, 117, owing $3,888,100. The increase this year in the liabilities of the latter was also quite heavy, and both in the case of manufacturing concerns and in the third division it was due mainly to a number of large defaults. In the manufacturing class there was quite an increase in the clothing section; also, in that embracing the printing trades and in the leather division. For the lumber manufacturing class a small decrease appears as to the number, but the liabilities in August were heavy as they were a year ago. For the large machinery division, a decrease also is shown this year in the number of defaults, which is likewise true as to the important milling line. In the trading section the clothing division leads most of the other classes in the increase for August, both as to number of defaults and the indebtedness, the same as for the manufacturing lines. Other trading classifications showing a gain for August this year include dry goods dealers, the shoe trades, furniture, hardware, drugs, and hats, furs and gloves. There was a decrease last month in general stores, in grocers, hotels and restaurants, jewelry and books and stationery. Some large failures in the hotel lines, however,added 1606 FINANCIAL CHRONICLE [Vor., 131. materially to the liabilities for that class in the but there also have been 44 new highs for the year.

Public discussion of the Briand plan for a system of European federal union was finally launched by high official representatives of 27 European countries in Geneva this week, most of the Foreign Ministers and many Premiers of the continent assem hling in the League city for the purpose Monday. •Consideration of the proposal was begun at a special :meeting held, for convenience, concurrently with the opening of the League Council session and two days in advance of the League Assembly gathering. At the insistence of the Foreign Secretary of Great Britain, Arthur Henderson, only the question of procedure was raised in the special meeting. The debate that followed resulted in a unanimous resolution whereby the entire project was referred to the League of Nations and placed on the agenda of the Assembly. With the matter thus safely inside the League, much in accordance with British views, wider discussion of the plan was started in the current Assembly Thursday, by the French Foreign Minister, who made an impassioned plea in support of the idea which he was the first to espouse off!daily. A warm reference to the plan was thereafter made by Foreign Secretary Henderson, and further discussion is thus assured for the proposal which M. Briand placed before the European governments at a special luncheon in Geneva just one year ago. M. Briand's difficulties with his ambitious project began somewhat in advance of the three-fold assemblage at Geneva this week. Approval of his steps in the matter was first won from the French Cabinet at the customary meeting late last week. Approval of his outline of policy was given by Premier Tardieu and his Ministers, with the reservation that due respect must be exercised for existing treaties. Some incidental support was given the scheme by the European Customs Union, which presented to the delegates of the 27 European nations a fully formulated plan for economic collaboration along the lines suggested by M. Briand. Foremost among the suggestions made, a dispatch to the New York \"Times\" said, was a plan for the early formation of two strong commissions with broad powers to integrate the internal and external markets of Europe. A preliminary warning that the British attitude as expressed in the London note of July 15 to M. Briand had not changed was, however, issued by Viscount Cecil of Chelwood, causing some concern regarding the success of the plan as outlined by Foreign Minister Briand. Lord Cecil stated emphatically that Great Britain could have nothing to do with any form of European federation unless it was an integral part of the League of Nations and was directed by the Council of the League and the Secretariat. [VOL. 131. After these not entirely auspicious preliminaries, representatives of 27 European nations gathered around the table in Geneva last Monday afternoon and held a three-hour secret discussion of the project. M. Briand is said to have desired a public meeting for the reading of his report in which he summed up the 26 replies received in July to his memorandum of May 17. Mr. Henderson opposed him and won his point. Press dispatches, accordingly, contained little more than a description of the meeting and the text of the resolution that was made public afterward. In the resolution representatives of the European countries took note of the results of the inquiry instituted by M. Briand and expressed their conviction that \"close collaboration of European governments in all international activities is of capital importance for the maintenance of peace throughout the world.\" They were unanimous in their belief that such collaboration should be carried out in complete agreement with the League of Nations and, accordingly, decided to place the question on the agenda of the Assembly. M. Briand was delegated to bring the matter up in the Assembly meeting. Following the secret meeting on Monday, Foreign Minister Curtius of Germany issued a statement to the press in which he gave earnest support \"in principle\" to the Briand plan. Dr. Curtius revealed that the general opinion of the conference, in addition to the support given the proposal for further discussion in the Assembly, was that a special European committee should be established to study the idea and put concrete proposals before the Assembly in 1931. The long-expected address of M. Briand in support and explanation of his project for a European federal union was made before the entire Assembly, Thursday. Contrary to general expectations his address was a very general one, in which definite suggestions and recommendations were almost studiously avoided. The veteran statesman contented himself throughout his discourse of an hour with arguing the necessity of some closer federal bond among European nations and in asserting emphatically that neither the League of Nations, the United States, nor any other regional or diplomatic group would find it inimical. \"I persist in seeing with a profound hope,\" he told his hearers. He then described vividly the long struggle for a final worldpeace and definitely placed his project for European federation within the scope of these endeavors. With an incidental reference to the desultory naval negotiations between France and Italy, he remarked: \"I am quite decided in my desire to seek the day when there will be no more.war.\" He turned then to what he described as his greatest work for peace—the proposed federation. When he first laid the idea before the world a year ago, he said, he insisted that the federation must take place within the framework of the League. He repeated that it must rest there. \"The proposal is now before the world,\" he continued. \"A year's study by the nations of Europe has brought to light, it is true, certain difficulties which were not foreseen at first, but I am satisfied to know from the replies to my memorandum that the response was firm in adherence to the principle of European collaboration.\" He concluded with a further admonition that his plan was designed to accomplish peace. Foreign Secretary Henderson of Great Britain, who followed with a general address to the Assembly,remarked in the course of his speech SEPT. 13 1930.] FINANCIAL CHRONICLE that M.Briand's exposition was both interesting and eloquent. \"The world's economic ills,\" he added, \"could be healed only by international co-operation, and Great Britain will support all means to this end. We hope it will lead to the most practical results which M. Briand hopes to attain.\" Delegates of 51 nations assembled at Geneva, Wednesday, for the opening session of the eleventh annual gathering of the League of Nations Assembly. A smaller meeting of diplomats preceded this gathering on Monday, when the League Council began its customary September discussions, but since the Assembly has progressively overshadowed the Council in recent years, most attention was directed to the more comprehensive sessions. Moreover, the special meeting of European representatives in connection with M. Briand's plan for a European federation caused a crowding of the Council deliberations into the two mornings of Monday and Tuesday, placing them still further in the background. In the first meeting the Council debated the controversy between the Mandates Commission and the British Government over the 1929 Palestine outbreak, with the result that the Commission was fully upheld in its criticisms of the affair. Tuesday's meeting was almost entirely routine, the only exchange of any importance taking place between Foreign Ministers Briand of France and Curtius of Germany, who discussed withdrawal of 250 railway guards from the Saar basin. This question was again raised in a short Council meeting yesterday, and a decision was reached on this occasion for withdrawal of the remaining French and Belgian forces within three months. The action was taken on the recommendation of Signor Scialoja of Italy. The Assembly session was started Wednesday in an atmosphere of considerable uncertainty, occasioned by the sudden departure for Rome of the Italian Foreign Minister, Dino Grandi. No satisfactory explanation of this step was issued, but a subsequent reference by Foreign Minister Briand of France threw some light on the matter. The initial meeting of the Assembly was devoted, as usual, to the appointment of an Assembly President, the election of commissions, and speeches by the Council representative and the new Assembly head. Cesar Zumeta, Venezuelan representative on the Council, opened the Assembly gathering with a rather gloomy review of the past year. Nicolas Titulescu, Rumanian Minister to London, was elected President of the Assembly, and he started the gathering off with an extremely short speech. He called upon the Assembly to discuss questions of greater moment than any which have hitherto presented themselves, adding in explanation that all countries of the world are faced with difficulties of an economic character. \"This is not the time for speeches; this is the time for actions,\" he said in conclusion. Foreign Minister Briand of France made the first of the formal speeches before the Assembly on Thursday. As already remarked, lie devoted his address almost entirely to a deft intertwining of a plea for peace with his project for a system of Federal union in Europe. Only by means of such a union can peace be maintained on the Continent, he said. A revealing reference to Foreign Minister Grandi of Italy was made by M. Briand, who said, \"I have recently been in conversation with a foreign friendly power and I am hopeful of soon completing the agreement 1609 started at London.\" It was assumed 'in Geneva, in consequence of this comment, that Signor Grandi had returned to Rome to discuss the Franco-Italian naval situation with Premier Mussolini. Foreign Secretary Henderson of Great Britain,. who followed, paid tribute to the Briand plan, but the keynote of his speech was a call for disarmament and the conclusion of a general disarmament treaty in 1931. In direct contrast to the French thesis that security must precede disarmament, Mr.. Henderson declared that \"it is vain to hope for security until a general scheme for disarmament is a reality.\" Security, moreover, was held impossible if cumulative military preparations continue as they are going on to-day. Reference was made by Mr. Henderson to the London naval treaty of 1930, which he described as merely a preliminary step toward the great goal to which the League members should direct their energies. With more specific regard to capital ships, he said: \"We hope that agreements will be made before 1936 by which, no more of these monsters of war will ever be constructed.\" The League members were reminded by the British Minister of their obligations under the League Covenant to accept a general reduction and limitation of national forces by international treaties. Although incurred 11 years ago, the obligation has not yet been honored, he pointed out. As an immediate practical step he urged the Assembly to ratify the amendments for harmonizing the Kellogg-Brian& treaty and the League Covenant. He also stated that Britain is ready to support a treaty for financial assistance to countries that are victims of aggressors in war time. A bewildering and dramatic series of events in Buenos Aires was capped late last Saturday by a sudden overturn of the reorganized civil government of Argentina and establishment in full control of a military junta headed by General Jose Francisco TJriburu. Acting with great speed and apparently with the full consent of the populace, the military opponents of the deposed President, Hipolito Yrigoyen, organized a provisional government with General Uriburu as President. Some disorders occurred Tuesday when the new President took the oath of office, reports indicating that seven persons were killed and about 50 wounded in the rioting, looting and shooting. The actual overturn of the civil government last Saturday also occasioned some brief fighting in which a half-dozen fatalities occurred, but with these exceptions the country re. mained orderly. The new government rapidly consolidated its position and announced a number of steps in the course of this week designed to facilitate the country's quickest possible return to normal conditions. Of primary importance was a statement made by the provisional President, Wednesday, in which he indicated that close co-operation with the United States and close participation in activities of the Pan-American Union were to be keynotes of his administration. This represents a complete volte face from the isolationist policy of Senor Yrigoyen, who left even the important ambassadorial post at Washington unfilled. The developments in Argentina were similar in many respects to those in Bolivia late in June, and in Peru last month, military juntas in every case overthrowing presidents who wielded dictatorial powers with little, if any, popular support.

Rumors of revolt in Brazil have been current for several weeks, but all the reports have come by way of neighboring countries. Official statements were issued by the Rio de Janeiro Government last week and again early this week denying the reports of a precarious political situation and giving assurances of order and stability. In Cuba attempts have been made to organize plots for overthrow of military garrisons as forerunners of a more general military revolt, according to Havana reports. Martial law was declared in the city of Palma Soriano, Oriente Province, Monday, in order to frustrate one of these plots. Panama also has been visited by some disturbances, but the atmosphere in that country cleared to some degree last Monday when the resignations of three Cabinet members were announced. The remaining members of the Cabinet handed their resignations to President Arosemena, Tuesday, and the latter began the task of forming a new Cabinet more in sympathy with the aims of the present regime.

The two Moderate envoys admitted that their peace efforts ended in complete failure. The Nationalist leaders, Mr. Gandhi, the Pandits Molllal and Jawarhalal Nehru, Vallabhai Patel and Mrs. Sarojini Naidu, drafted demands in conferences at Yerovda prison in which they called for a full national government, responsible only to the people of India, and with the right to secede at any time from the British Empire. In addition, they stipulated that the government should have control of defense forces as well as full economic control, that it be given the right to refer to an independent tribunal such British claims and concessions, including the Indian public debt, which seemed to them unjust, and that political prisoners not found guilty of violence should be released and their confiscated property restored. The Nationalists left the question of representation at the Londay round-table conference on India to be decided after these \"preliminaries\" had been agreed to by the Viceroy. Lord Irwin, however, dismissed the proposals as \"impossible,\" saying that \"no useful purpose can be served by any attempt to deal with the suggestions in detail.\" The prospects of the Indian conference are thus considerably dimmed, the London \"Times\" remarking last Saturday that the Hindu politically-minded classes in British India will be under-represented in London without the Nationalist Congress leaders. Announcement ,was made at London Wednesday that the conference will open at St. James's Palace on Oct. 20, with a Indians of all religions and all parties except the Nationalist Congress present. No invitations were extended to the imprisoned leaders of the civil disobedience campaign. The gathering is expected to last about three months. Reliable estimates of the fearful losses sustained by the city of Santo Domingo in the hurricane of last week were finally made available Thursday, more than a week after the destructive storm swept over the Caribbean city. With roads and communications clogged, and water, food and medical supplies all desperately needed, attention has been directed by innumerable relief agencies to the task of rendering primary aid. The damage was confined almost entirely to the capital, but that city of 45,000 inhabitants was wiped almost out of existence. A Government survey showed that approximately 2,700 are dead from the hurricane, while 8,000 are injured. Among the latter are said to be 1,000 gangrene cases.

The official rate for call money on the Stock ExChange was 23/2% throughout, but progressively greater offerings were reflected in the unofficial \"Street\" market where overflow funds were placed at widening concessions. Withdrawals by the banks of approximately $25,000,000 Monday prevented any outside offerings of call money, but a concession of 1A% or a rate of 2% was named Tuesday and maintained Wednesday despite further withdrawals of $15,000,000. Still greater ease was apparent in the Street trading Thursday and again yesterday, funds being available in both sessions at 1%%. There were several occurrences during the week which convinced money brokers that a termination of the present period of extremely easy money is not yet in sight. Most important of these was a Treasury offering, announced Monday, of $325,000-, 000 one-year certificates of indebtedness with a coupon of only 2/%. Subscriptions received totaled almost four times the offering. Both the Dallas and Minneapolis Reserve Banks, moreover, reduced their rediscount rates to 33i% from the previous level of 4%. With the exceptions of the 23'% New York rate and the 3% Boston level, all Reserve Banks are now quoting 33%. Brokers' loans registered an increase of $33,000,000 in the statement of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York covering the week ended Wednesday night. The gold statement of the bank for the same period showed exports of $3,000,000 to Canada, and imports of $2,354,000 from Latin American countries. No net change was reported in the stock of gold held earmarked for foreign account. Dealing in detail with the call loan rate on the Stock Exchange from day to day, all loans every day of the week have been at 23'%, this including renewals. The demand for time money has shown little or no improvement during the week, Occasional transactions of minor importance have been reported but the aggregate business has been small. Rates for 30 day loans were marked up on Wednesday from 2@23.1.% to 23'i.@23/2% and the rate for 60-day bills from 234@23'% to 23/2@2%%.

Rates are unchanged, extra choice names of four to six months' maturity being quoted at 3%, while names less well known are offered at 334.0g33'%• The market for prime bank acceptances continued active, but transactions were somewhat curtailed by the limited supply of paper available. The 12 Reserve Banks further increased their holdings of acceptances during the week from $170,395,000 to $193,120,000. Their holdings of acceptances for foreign correspondents further declined from $459,830,000 to $458,450,000. The posted rates of the 1614 FINANCIAL CHRONICLE American Acceptance Council continue at 2% bid and 1-A% asked for bills running 30 days, and also for 60 and 90 days; 23/8% bid and 2% asked for 120 days, and 2V% bid and VA% asked for 150 days and 180 days.

From Saturday to Tuesday Montreal funds were at 9-64 of 1% premium; on Wednesday and Thursday at 5-32 of 1% premium, and on Friday was again 9-64 of 1% premium. Present shipments of gold to Canada bring the total to $21,500,000 since the first shipment was made on July 22. It is thought that further shipments may be made within the next few days. Canadian grain is moving well, creating a demand for Canadian dollars. Referring to day-to-day rates sterling exchange on Saturday last eased off.

All the Continental currencies alike feel the sudden cessation of tourist requirements, while at present bankers state that there is an increased demand for dollars owing to the improvement in the security markets on this side, and that there is some repatriation of American investment money from London and Berlin.
