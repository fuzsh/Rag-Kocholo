        "text": "Princess Cruises is a premium travel brand and a subsidiary company of Carnival Group, making it one of the 10 cruise shipping lines and travel brands owned by currently the world's biggest cruise shipowner - Carnival Corporation. As part of the conglomerate, the Princess brand brings ~20% of the Group's revenue.\n\nCompany History and Changes\n\nPrincess Cruises (princess.com) was founded in 1965 by Stanley McDonald who chartered the Alaskan ship SS Princess Patricia (1948-built/1995-scrapped, IMO 5284924) for roundtrips to the Mexican Riviera from Los Angeles during the off-season (winter). In 1967, Princess started to charter the ship MS Italia (1967-built/2012-scrapped, IMO 6513994), which had a modern design, numerous innovations, more spacious upper decks, larger public areas (midship/ by placing the engines aft).\n\nIn December 2025, the company celebrates its 60th anniversary.\n\nThe new \"Princess Italia\" again operated the Mexican Riviera from LA (the Princess logo on the funnel was placed for the first time in 1967). In 1969 the ship made its inaugural season in Alaska with roundtrips from San Francisco. When the charter ended (in 1973), Princess chartered the \"Carla C\" ship (from Costa Cruises) and unofficially renamed it \"Princess Carla\".\n\nThe company's modern-times history commenced in 1974 when it was acquired by P&O UK. The new owner transferred its \"Spirit of London\" ship (renamed Sun Princess) and 3 more boats bought from \"Flagship Cruises\" for the Princess brand - \"Sea Venture\" (Island Princess), Island Venture (Pacific Princess) and MS Kungsholm (Sea Princess). The first newbuild (specifically for Princess) was Royal Princess (1984, also served Princess under the name \"Artemis\").\n\nA major company asset is \"Princess Tours\" (Alaska division acquired in 1986) with 10 luxury railcars for scenic tours of Mt McKinley and daily capacity 700+ passengers. With the acquisition of Sitmar Line (1988), P&O added to the Princess brand 3 more vessels (then under construction) - in 1989 (Star Princess/2021-scrapped as Columbus) and in 1990 (Crown Princess, Regal Princess), plus 2 former Cunard liners (renamed Dawn Princess, Fair Princess) and Sitmar's \"Fairsky\" ship (renamed Sky Princess).\n\nThe \"P&O Princess Cruises\" company was established in 2000 (October 23rd). It subsequently merged with Carnival Corp in 2003 (April 17th) into \"Carnival Corporation & plc\". The USD 5,4-billion-dollar merger created the largest cruise shipping company in the world ever, grouping 11 different travel brands as subsidiaries.\n\nCurrently, Princess Cruise Lines Ltd (USA) is transferred to Carnival's American division (Holland America Group), but the brand's marketing and sales in the UK are under Carnival plc (aka Carnival UK) which also manages Cunard Line.\n\nThe company's current President is John Padgett (assigned in October 2021) who reports directly to Holland America Group's President (Jan Swartz). John Padgett was employed by Carnival Corporation (2014-2021, as Chief Experience and Innovation Officer) and by Walt Disney Parks & Resorts (1996-2014).\n\nThe company's other top executives include Terry Thornton (CCO/Chief Commercial Officer), Jim Berra (CMO/Chief Marketing Officer), Carmen Roig (VP of Sales), Vicki Johnson (Senior VP of Communications).\n\nThe world's most romantic attention the Princess cruise brand received by the participation of its vessels (first Island and Pacific, later Royal, Sun, and Sea) in the onboard filmed TV-series \"The Love Boat\" (ABC-aired from 1977 until 1986).\n\nIn May 2018, the cast of \"The Love Boat\" (ABC TV series run 1977-1986) and Princess Cruises was presented a Hollywood Walk of Fame star plaque. The honorary plaque is located in front of Dolby Theater's main entrance on Hollywood Blvd.\n\nFollowing the pilot show (May 5, 1977), the cruise ship-themed series continued for 10 seasons (until May 24, 1986).\n\nThe Princess brand became famous and commonly known as \"the Love Boat cruise line\". In the series were used the Princess-owned ships Island Princess (2017-scrapped as \"Discovery\"), Royal Princess (now Artania) and Sea Princess (2016-scrapped as \"Veronica\") cruising to exotic destinations around the world.\n\nOne of the most famous features of Carnival's Princess brand is its \"Personal Choice Cruising\" program - an unstructured and individualized approach to the ship vacation travel by the innovative \"if you want it - when you want it\" concept. The brand's travel style provides an exceptional feeling of choice and flexibility giving passengers the opportunity to customize their vacation in a way that most fits their personal interests and desires. Implemented in the mid-90s (on the Sun-class Princess ships), this unique concept of passengers being in control of their voyages and vacation experiences was realized via multiple shipboard dining venues, flexible entertainment options and affordable balcony staterooms.\n\nCompany changes 2024\n\nIn April was announced that starting September 14 (2024) fleetwide would be introduced 3 distinct main dining /table service options – Traditional, Reservable, and Walk-in Anytime. On each ship will be allocated 3 separate dining rooms - one for traditional dining (offering early and late dinner seating), one with reservable times, and one for open seating. The new options are integrated with the OceanNow service, allowing anything to be ordered anytime, and delivered anywhere onboard.\n\nIn July, in partnership with Anthony Felix Gemignani (American chef, restaurateur, author), Princess Cruises set the GUINNESS WORLD RECORD title for the \"World's Largest Pizza Party\". The record was achieved simultaneously across multiple venues (fleetwide), with passengers enjoying 60,000+ slices of freshly oven-baked pizza. Chef Tony Gemignani crafted two exclusive for Princess Cruises pizzas featuring the combinations of Soppressata sausage with hot honey, and agave pesto with fresh goat cheese. Additionally, he shared three of his unique pizza recipes. In summer 2024, Gemignani's freshly oven-baked pizzas were introduced (at the specialty restaurants Alfredo's and Gigi's, and the Lido Deck's complimentary Slice Station fleetwide.\n\nIn August was introduced the MedallionNet Max (Wi-Fi package), in addition to MedallionNet Classic. Like MedallionNet Classic, MedallionNet Max costs US$25 per day (single-device plan) and US$45 per day (multi-device plan) but provides better/faster connectivity. However, it is available only to passengers purchasing the Princess Plus (US$60) and Princess Premier (US$80) beverage packages.\n\nCompany changes 2023\n\nOn March 23, 2023, Princess announced the partnership with Luigi Lavazza SpA (1895-founded, Turin Italy-based manufacturer of coffee products) as the brand’s \"Official Coffee Partner\". By the deal, Lavazza products and services are offered fleetwide and include coffee-themed dinners, Lavazza-based recipes, educational sessions, coffee tastings/samplings and food pairings.\n\nOn June 24, 2023, were announced new onboard \"Princess Perfect Weddings\" packages and the appointment Randy Fenoli (1964-born American TV host and fashion/bridal designer best known for his TV show \"Randy to the Rescue and Say Yes to the Dress\") as Princess Cruises' Love and Romance Ambassador. Also was announced that he will host a bridal fashion-themed voyage on Regal Princess (leaving from Galveston TX on Dec 3rd) with signature events like meet & greets and wedding gown consultations. As brand ambassador, Fenoli developed the exclusive \"Randy Fenoli Weddings\" package.\n\nIn October 2023, the company announced a shift in its pricing strategy, ensuring that only early bookings get the best-priced deals possible (by eliminating last-minute cruise booking discounts) and also introduced the Best Price Guarantee and Princess Promotions.\n\nRail & Sail\" (train+cruise) program 2024\n\nIn April was introduced the \"Rail & Sail\" (train+cruise) program providing swift and seamless access to Princess' ships homeported in Florida (Fort Lauderdale and Port Canaveral/Orlando). The program is via a partnership with Brightline/BLFX (high-speed intercity passenger railway in Florida connecting Miami with Orlando).\n\nThe program significantly reduces pre- and post-cruise travel time compared to conventional road travel options. A Brightline train with four custom-designed cars displays Princess' signature logo and images of popular call ports. Princess' branding is also prominently displayed within Brightline's five Florida train terminals.\n\nWith the Rail & Sail program was also introduced a luggage express service allowing cruise tourists to check their bags at their Brightline station and find them securely waiting in their stateroom. Princess guests also receive up to 15% discounts when booking \"Smart and Premium Rail & Sail\" packages through Brightline's website. Brightline offers Princess cruise passengers access to a comprehensive train schedule (daily departures) providing 16 roundtrip transits between Orlando and Fort Lauderdale.\n\nBrightline's train travel options are two - Southbound (Orlando to Fort Lauderdale, with stops at West Palm Beach and Boca Raton) and Northbound (Fort Lauderdale to Orlando, stops at Boca Raton and West Palm Beach). Residents of South Florida can also utilize Brightline's services from downtown Miami and Aventura terminals, with stops in Fort Lauderdale or Orlando.\n\n(NEW) Ship boarding/embarkation system (2023)\n\nOn August 1, 2023, Princess Cruises implemented fleetwide a new boarding process aiming to make it easier for tourists to board the ships. As a result, the scheduled arrival times on embarkation day were eliminated.\n\nThe new embarkation system requires all passengers to complete the necessary steps (via Princess App) prior to the voyage.\n\nGreen Lane qualified are passengers who have completed all the Travel Checklist's steps and have received their Medallion device by mail (only in the USA and Puerto Rico). Green Lane provides the most streamlined embarkation/fastest boarding. Note: Passengers who are Green Lane-eligible but choose not to have their Medallions shipped to them are classified as Blue Lane.\n\nBlue Lane qualified are passengers who have completed (some, none or all) Travel Checklist's steps but have opted not to have their Medallions mailed to them. Blue Lane guests still enjoy an expedited check-in but must pick up their Medallion at the cruise terminal.\n\nAccessibility Lane is for passengers experiencing mobility/accessibility difficulties. They have a separate/dedicated lane for faster check-in, regardless of their color designation.\n\nThe new embarkation system no longer requires selecting a specific arrival group time. Instead, guests can arrive within the designated check-in window at a time that suits them. However, Princess Cruises strongly recommends all guests to provide travel arrangement information via OceanReady (MedallionClass app and the Cruise Personalizer). The check-in details can be found in their travel summary.\n\nSince August 2023, the company also improved the Digital Boarding Pass which is available in the Princess app (11 days prior to the ship departure date). The updated boarding pass now includes the deck and stateroom number.\n\nPrincess Upgrade (new cabin upgrades program)\n\nIn August 2022 was announced the \"Princess Upgrade\" program that allows passenger cabin upgrades on a regular basis (not as promos) and for all types of staterooms and categories.\n\nThe new program was officially launched on September 6, 2022, on just 5x USA-based Princess boats (Caribbean, Discovery, Enchanted, Regal, Ruby). By the end of October (2022) the program was rolled out fleetwide.\n\n\"Princess Upgrade\" is only for bookings within Final Payment and when the full payment has been made. Then customers receive an invitation to submit a bid on any cabin type and category that is above the currently booked. The bid can be changed or canceled at any time before being accepted.\n\nShipboard retail shopping\n\nIn September 2021, Princess and Harding signed a deal for the entire fleet's onboard retail shopping business to move under Harding’s management.\n\nHarding+ (Bristol UK-based global travel and cruise retail group) in 2020 was acquired by Davidson Kempner Capital Management LP (1983-founded, NYC-based investment management firm with USD 34+ billion in managed assets). Harding has hubs in Bristol (England), Miami (Florida USA) and Sydney (NSW Australia).\n\nThe existing Princess retail team joined Harding's as part of the transition.\n\nEach of the Princess boats has an onboard shopping arcade named \"Shops of Princess\".\n\nNew ships\n\nIn April 2016, Princess' owner Carnival Corporation signed a shipbuilding order for 2 new boats scheduled for deliveries in 2019 (Sky Princess) and 2020-2021 (Enchanted Princess). Sky and Enchanted are 4th and 5th ROYAL-class ships (same-designed as Royal,Regal, Majestic) all constructed at Monfalcone yard as part of a previous agreement with Fincantieri (shipbuilder). At that time, Carnival Group had a total of 16 shipbuilding orders, with scheduled deliveries between 2016-2020. These 3670-passenger vessels have 80% balconied staterooms and some fleet-first features.\n\nIn late-January 2017, Carnival Corporation announced 2 more orders for the fleets of Princess (Royal-class) and Holland America Line (Pinnacle-class). Carnival signed an MoA (memorandum of agreement) with Fincantieri to construct both units, with deliveries in 2021 (Nieuw Ryndam-Rotterdam for HAL, at Marghera yard) and 2022 (Discovery Princess, at Monfalcone yard). When both contracts were finalized (February 2017), Carnival Corporation had a total of 19 newbuilds scheduled for deliveries in 2017-2022.\n\nIn July 2018 were ordered 2 new-class (larger than Royal-class) liners with GT tonnage/volume 175000 and passenger capacity 4300. These are the fleet's first dual-fuel (MGO and LNG) powered vessels. The contract with Fincantieri (Monfalcone) was signed in March 2019, with scheduled deliveries in 2023 and 2025. Princess in 2018 had 5 newbuilds on order with Fincantieri. The 2023-2025 units were Carnival Group's 10th and 11th LNG-powered ships.\n\nBy 2019, during drydock refurbishments (part of the company's USD 450 million fleet renovation program), 45000+ \"Princess Luxury Beds\" were rolled out fleetwide (to 22000+ staterooms / on all liners). The custom-made \"Princess Luxury Bed\" implements the latest sleep science technologies and was developed via partnership with Dr. Michael Breus (The Sleep Doctor) and Candice Olson (Canadian designer).\n\nIn December 2019, Princess signed with Panasonic Corporation a deal to deliver 4K laser projectors for the entire fleet (first unit was installed on Sky Princess). All liners will be outfitted with Panasonic PT-RQ50KU (4K Laser Projector with Solid Shine technology) to be used for the new 5-Skies production show featuring UHD imagery.\n\nIn September 2022 Princess signed with Xponential Fitness Inc (Irvine CA USA-based, 2017-founded company) a 5-year exclusive licensing agreement. Xponential Fitness is currently the world's largest global franchise group of boutique fitness brands. As of 2022, Xponential franchises 10 fitness brands (Club Pilates, pure barre, CycleBar, StretchLAB, Row House, YogaSix, Rumble, AKT Dance, STRIDE Fitness, BFT) and has 2220+ gym studios in 48 American states and 13 countries. The deal with Xponential, together with the partnership with OneSpaWorld (providing gym professionals and wellness staff and services) made Princess the first major cruise company to offer multiple premium fitness brands for personalized and customizable gym/training experiences. During the agreement period (2022-2027), at least 8x Xponential brands are available on each Princess boat (120 licensed gym studios fleetwide).\n\nIn 2024 (Sun Princess) and 2025 (Star Princess) debut the fleet's ever-largest (SPHERE-class) vessels, with GT-tonnage/volume ~175,000 tonnes.\n\nEach boat has 21 floors, 2157 staterooms, and the signature (fleet-first ) facilities The Dome (top-deck entertainment space covered by a glass roof) and Piazza Atrium (3-deck-high, outward-looking midship suspended space with comfortable seating, 360-degree outside views, huge LED screen/movable, to allow live entertainment). Both SPHERE Princess ships also have new for the fleet cabin types - Signature Collection Suites (exclusive access to Signature Restaurant-Lounge & Bar-Sundeck) and Reserve Collection Staterooms (exclusive restaurant).\n\nPrincess ships with MedallionNet WiFi Internet\n\nIn early-September 2018 was introduced (on Caribbean Princess) Carnival Corporation's OceanMedallion technology - wearable devices allowing passengers access to \"virtual concierge\" services and amenities, as well as interactive entertainment. The new technology also includes the MedallionNet - (SES Networks-powered) Wi-Fi connectivity via access points installed in all staterooms. Passengers on MedallionClass cruise liners experience land-like Internet connection quality allowing streaming of movies, music, videos, video phone calls, real-time sharing on social media platforms.\n\nAll MedallionClass ships (Princess' entire fleet) feature touchless embarkation/disembarkation (homeport), keyless cabin entry, frictionless commerce, contactless capabilities (way-finding, on-demand service delivery), shipboard family and friends locator, interactive entertainment (first-run movies, live TV, events, activities planner).\n\nIn 2018, MedallionNet was installed on the Princess liners Caribbean, Regal, Royal and Ruby. In 2019, MedallionNet received the liners Coral (Apr 5), Island (May 15), Crown (Jun 30), Emerald (Aug 3), Sky (Oct 12), Golden (Dec 20). In 2020 were upgraded the liners Grand (Feb 21), Diamond (Mar 15), Majestic (Apr 18), Star (Jun 12), Enchanted (Jun 15) and Sapphire (Jul 27).\n\nIn 2021 was introduced \"Ocean Sportsbook\" (a real-time sports betting option available fleetwide/on all boats) which allows betting on sports like football, basketball, baseball, hockey, cycling, car racing, boxing, martial arts and other competitions.\n\nWhen the cruise ship is in international waters, passengers can use the MedallionClass app to wager on sports and place bets during live events that occur during the voyage and also place bets on future sports events - that occur after the voyage. With USD 20+ billion in wagers placed with USA's sportsbooks in 2019-2020, online sports betting is expanding and expected to reach USD 155+ billion by 2024.\n\nOcean Sportsbook is via partnership with Miomni Gaming Ltd (1998-founded software developer) and available on all vessels since 2021. Ocean Sportsbook is part Ocean Casino's digital platform that lets wagers be placed beyond the ship's Casino Lounge (indoor-outdoor venues, sundecks/pool decks, wellness complex, staterooms, etc) on games including slots, poker, blackjack, roulette, bingo, lottery, keno.\n\nIn June 2021 the cruise company introduced the industry's first CrewCall. The on-demand service is via the cabin's smart HDTV (and the MedallionClass app) and allows passengers to call a crew (to their current onboard location) for assistance or to request services. The app's \"CrewCall Chat\" allows texting (via smart devices) a specific question or making requests to the crew member.\n\nCruisetours / Shore Excursions\n\nSince 2017, Princess Cruises offers \"Shore Excursions Best Price Guarantee\" for tours in all ports of call. The program was launched fleetwide in Dec 2016 and guarantees if passengers booking through Princess find the same tour/excursion elsewhere at a lower price, they will receive 110% of the difference as non-refundable OBC (onboard credit). In such cases, an email request must be submitted at least 7 days prior to departure (at shoreexcursions@princesscruises.com) to be reviewed by the company's Shore Excursion team. Within 2 business days, booked passengers are notified if their request meets the criteria.\n\n\"Best Price Guarantee\" applies only to tours/shore excursions that are publicly available (priced online).\n\n\"Best Price Guarantee\" applies to all excursions, excepting those in Asia and also excepting private vehicle/driver excursions in all ports.\n\nPrincess Shore Excursions program offers over 4,000 land tours/excursions in 360 destinations and over 150 itineraries.\n\n\"Discovery\" and \"Animal Planet\" themed excursions are also available as part of the new \"Discovery at Sea\" cruise tour program (via an exclusive partnership with Discovery Communications). These tours are unique, can't be booked independently and are available only through Princess. The program includes over 1,000 such tours worldwide.\n\nThe company's most popular/purchased cruise package is \"Princess Plus\" (cost US$50 per person/per day). The package is inclusive of premium beverages, unlimited WiFi Internet (for 4x devices), selected specialty restaurant dining, digital photos (+ 3x printed/8x10 cm), Princess Prizes, daily crew gratuities.\n\nIn 2022 was introduced the \"Princess Premier Package\" (cost US$75 pp per day) that is inclusive of unlimited WiFi Internet (for 4x devices), premium/top-brand liquors-wines-cocktails-coffees, specialty dining (2x meals per person), digital photos (unlimited, plus 3x printed), crew gratuities.\n\nPrincess Alaskan lodges (cruisetour packages)\n\nDenali Princess Wilderness Lodge is a 663-room complex located approx 2 km (1 ml) from Denali Park's entrance. The building has an expansive deck overlooking Nenana River and views into the nature park. Accommodations are available exclusively to Princess Cruises customers, offered as optional pre-/post- Alaskan cruise tour packages.\n\nIn 2019 (company's 50th year in Alaska), Denali Princess Wilderness Lodge debuted the 180-seat restaurant \"Fannie Q's Saloon\". The new dining venue serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner, offering locally inspired, authentic dishes (Braised Pork Shoulder, Bison Sliders, Bear-Lard Pie). The modern saloon has indoor and outdoor seating, with live entertainment in the evenings. Outside Fannie Q's Saloon is the Fireside Patio with 3 new BBQ firepits and selling refreshment drinks. Grizzly Burger (formerly Grizzly Bar and Grill) now offers the company's signature \"Ernesto\" - exclusive ribeye burger created by Ernesto Uchimura (Japanese celebrity chef).\n\nLike outdoor activities, Princess cruise tour passengers can meet mountain climbers (who have conquered Mt Denali) in the Mt McKinley Princess Wilderness Lodge (Denali State Park). Outside the lodge, there is a retired airplane.\n\nFishing and sledge dog puppies activities are both complimentary. Lodge's Denali show costs USD 20 per person.\n\nPlaying with sledge dog puppies on a cruise ship is probably the last thing one would ever imagine doing. However, it is one of the new activities available on all Princess Cruises Alaska itineraries. The company's \"North to Alaska\" enrichment program debuted in 2017 and gives passengers the chance to take photos and interact with baby sledge dogs in the ship's Atrium (lobby) area. Dog handlers are on hand to talk about this Alaskan sport.\n\nThe \"Puppies in the Piazza\" experience is available on all Princess Alaskan cruise ships and roundtrip itineraries. Also new is the chance to taste your own catch of the day for dinner. New fishing excursions allow passengers to select their preferred preparation by ship's culinary team.\n\nDuring the company's 2018 Alaskan program was inaugurated the custom-designed wilderness treehouse built at Mt McKinley Princess Wilderness Lodge. The treehouse allows guests to view Mt Denali while enjoying themed activities.\n\nThe treehouse was built during Discovery Channel's Animal Planet episode \"Treehouse Masters\", which premiered in August 2017. It was the first-ever treehouse in Alaska, being designed and built by Pete Nelson. Powered by solar panels, the facility provides Princess cruise ship tourists with a unique \"Alaskan land tour\" experience. Sized approx 500 ft2 (46 m2), the treehouse can be accessed by hiking the \"hill trail loop\".\n\n(NEW) Princess cruise gratuities\n\nSince May 21, 2019, the company's daily gratuities (per person/pp) were raised fleetwide as follows:\n\nUSD 14,50 (from $13,50 pp) - interior, oceanview, balcony staterooms, both adults and kids\n\nUSD 15,50 (from $14,50 pp) - mini-suites, Club Class staterooms\n\nUSD 16,50 (from $15,50 pp) - suites\n\nSince January 2023, non-suite passengers pay USD 16 pp per day, while suite passengers pay USD 17-18 (depending on stateroom category).\n\nOn ships deployed in Australia and New Zealand, gratuities are not compulsory.\n\nDaily gratuity is an automatic service charge added to the passenger's onboard account each day.\n\nPassengers can prepay gratuities. The amount of gratuities is split between the ship's staff (dining, housekeeping, cabin stewards).\n\nPrincess Cruises bear mascot Stanley\n\nSince summer 2017, Princess Cruises ships feature a most special onboard attraction - the company's mascot bear Stanley.\n\nThe sensationally cute bear mascot was named in a Facebook contest with over 9,000 entries, Mascot's name honors Stanley McDonald (1920-2014). In 1965 he founded Princess Cruises and expanded it into one of the world's largest cruise ship companies. In 1975, he sold Princess to P&O Cruises (back then named \"Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company\") and remained its Chairman until 1980.\n\nAs the bear fell in love with ship cruising, he decided to skip winter hibernation and became a stowaway. So since 2017 Stanley travels around the world on all Princess ships. Stanley also made \"surprise\" appearances on the company's \"Chinese ship\" Majestic Princess in July 2017 during the inaugural festivities in Shanghai China. From China, Stanley the Bear embarked on all Princess itineraries.\n\nDuring the day, Princess' \"cruise ship bear\" wears themed apparel, which is tied to the ship's current itinerary destination. On Alaskan cruises that would be his lumberjack outfit. In China, he wears a traditional Tang suit and cap. In Japan, he wears a Yukata outfit. On formal nights, the bear dresses up in the Captain's uniform. The Stanley bear appears on all Princess ships. He interacts with passengers through various entertainment activities with engaging photo opportunities. Stanley also holds storytime hours for kids at the ship's youth facilities.\n\nOn the ship, passengers can participate in the daily contest \"Where on the ship is Stanley\". The mascot is also present on the special Welcome Aboard shows throughout the voyage. Souvenir Stanley bears plush toys are available for purchase in the onboard shopping arcade \"Shops of Princess\". The toy's price is USD 25. A portion of the proceeds from the toy's sales goes to \"Princess Animal Welfare Sponsor\".\n\nPrincess cruise ship passengers can share their travel adventures with Stanley using the social hashtag #StanleyAtSea.\n\n(Coronavirus crisis) passenger shipping pause 2020-2021-2022\n\nDue to the COVID pandemic, Princess suspended its fleet's passenger shipping operations by canceling all voyages with pre-scheduled departures in the period March 12, 2020, through July 2021.\n\nNext are listed Princess Cruises' first departures by ship/homeport - CARIBBEAN (Nov 28, 2021/Fort Lauderdale), CORAL (June 16, 2022/Sydney Australia), CROWN (May 7, 2022/Alaska from Seattle), DIAMOND (September 1, 2022/West Coast USA and Mexico from San Diego), DISCOVERY (March 27, 2022/Maiden Voyage/Mexican Riviera from Los Angeles), EMERALD (Oct 15, 2021/Panama Canal from Los Angeles to Fort Lauderdale), ENCHANTED (Nov 10, 2021/Maiden Voyage/Fort Lauderdale), GRAND (Sept 25, 2021/Los Angeles), ISLAND (April 27, 2022/Panama Canal from Fort Lauderdale to Los Angeles), MAJESTIC (July 25, 2021/Alaska from Seattle), REGAL (July 31, 2021/Southampton UK cruises to nowhere), ROYAL (May 2, 2022/Alaska from Vancouver), RUBY (Oct 31, 2021/San Francisco), SAPPHIRE (Sept 24, 2022/Hawaii and Mexico from Los Angeles), SKY (Aug 30, 2021/Southampton UK cruises to nowhere).\n\nDIAMOND's Asia 2021 program (roundtrips from Yokohama to Korea and Japan) and South America 2022 program (from Buenos Aires Argentina and San Antonio Chile) were canceled.\n\nMAJESTIC's Alaska 2021 program (from Seattle) was first canceled then scheduled again (July 25 thru Sept 26).\n\nSAPPHIRE's Australia 2021 program was canceled and replaced with LA roundtrips to Hawaii-Mexico-California Coast.\n\nCROWN's Panama Canal 2021-2022 winter season (from Fort Lauderdale) was canceled.\n\nISLAND's \"World Cruise 2022\" (112-day roundtrip from Fort Lauderdale) was canceled.\n\nCORAL's \"World Cruise 2022\" (108-day roundtrip from Australia/Sydney-Brisbane) was canceled.\n\nThe 2021-built ENCHANTED's entire inaugural Mediterranean 2021 season (July 3 thru Nov 15/departures from Barcelona and Rome, including the Transatlantic crossing Europe-USA) was canceled.\n\nDISCOVERY's maiden voyage (Nov 3, 2021/Mediterranean from Rome) was rescheduled for March 27, 2022 (Mexican Riviera from Los Angeles).\n\nDue to Canada's ban, Princess Alaska 2021 program was entirely canceled, affecting the schedules of 6 ships (Grand, Majestic, Royal, Crown, Coral, Emerald).\n\nThe Princess-operated Alaskan wilderness lodges and transportation (trains and buses) remained closed in 2020 and 2021.
