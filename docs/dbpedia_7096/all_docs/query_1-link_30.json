        "text": "\"After joining the MM&P [Masters Mates and Pilots Union] in Providence, Rhode Island in June 1962, I lived in the YMCA. The forty dollars I had at graduation from New York Maritime ran out, and my parents wired me twenty-five more. My first ship was the SS Oakey L. Alexander, a coal burning Victory Ship built late in World War II ... operated by the Pocahontas Fuel Company. I felt competent with all the bridge equipment. However I had to develop confidence in my ship handling ability as we carried coal from Norfolk to Fall River, Massachusetts. My memory is of a dingy coal boat, where my clothes were always dirty.\n\nA bit of research reveals that coal from the Pocahontas mine in West Virginia was hauled by rail to Norfolk, where it was loaded aboard ship for transport to ports in New England. Pocahontas had a small fleet of these coastal colliers, all having coal fired boilers.Schindler, then a third mate, was aboard the second ship named SS Oakey L. Alexander, the first one having gone aground and wrecked off the coast of Maine in 1947.\n\nTo replace the wrecked coal carrier, Pocahontas Fuel Company obtained the SS Laconia Victory, a VC2-S-AP2 built in 1945 but laid up due to boiler damage. The oil burning boilers were replaced with new coal fired ones and the ship extensively rebuilt. Cargo booms were removed and the holds were turned into coal bunkers. The ship used its cargo to fuel the boilers!\n\nAccommodations were installed to carry eight passengers."
