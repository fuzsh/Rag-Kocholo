        "text": "Cairo Collection Heading Home\n\nLike many wealthy Egyptians before the 1952 revolution, Mohammed Khalil, president of the Egyptian Senate in the 1930's, admired European art. His collection of more than 300 works is one of Cairo's lesser known attractions.\n\nWilled to the state at his death in 1955 on condition they remain in his villa in Giza, the works were moved in 1971 when Anwar el-Sadat, then President, bought the mansion next door. Seven years after Mr. Sadat's assassination, the Khalil collection is finally returning, though for the coming year it will remain in a neo-Islamic resthouse on Gezira Street next to the Marriott Hotel in Zamalek.\n\nAmong the paintings are five Monets, six Renoirs, three Gauguins, two Degas, one Van Gogh and a Toulouse Lautrec. There are also maquettes for several Rodin statues including ''The Thinker.''\n\nBy Cairo standards, the museum is in good shape; another Government-owned European collection is in a state of disarray at the Egyptian Civilization Museum next to the new opera house. The present Khalil Museum is worth a visit in its own right for its Islamic architecture, Chinese porcelains, Turkish tiles, inlaid cabinets and a marble bathroom on the second floor.\n\nOpen 9 A.M. to 2 P.M. and 5 to 8 P.M. daily except Friday. Entry fee: about 50 cents. Passport numbers must be recorded for security reasons. Telephone: 3418672. U.S. Widens Inspection Fee\n\nMore cruise passengers will have to pay a $5 inspection fee imposed by the Immigration and Naturalization service as the result of a revised interpretation of a 1986 law. The change is mostly affecting passengers on Caribbean cruises.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
