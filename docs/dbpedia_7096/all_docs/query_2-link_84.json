Will the Minister take steps to accelerate the inquiry into cyclamatic acids and, if necessary, take positive action to ban their use if there is the slightest risk of their being a health hazard?\n\nDr FORBES:\n\nMinister for Health · BARKER, SOUTH AUSTRALIA · LP\n\n– As the honourable gentleman will be aware, this matter is being considered by the National Health and Medical Research Council. I shall see what can be done to speed up its consideration of the subject’.\n\npage 107\n\nQUESTION\n\nFUNDS FOR VIETCONG\n\nSir JOHN CRAMER:\n\nBENNELONG, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– Will the Prime Minister make to the House a statement giving the facts concerning the published decision of the Monash University Labor Club to raise funds to help the Vietcong in the war in South Vietnam and in the killing of our own Australian soldiers? Is this Labor Club an authorised body of the\n\nAustralian Labor Party? What action can be taken against those responsible for such a traitorous act - assisting our enemies to destroy us? Will the Prime Minister make it possible for his statement to be debated so that the Opposition can state clearly its attitude to the Labor Club’s action?\n\nMr HAROLD HOLT:\n\nPrime Minister · HIGGINS, VICTORIA · LP\n\n– I am not able to say with any authority what relationship the Labor Clubs at the universities bear to the Australian Labor Party. But 1 can say that this Government condemns the decision that the honourable gentleman has mentioned. 1 can assure the House that we shall do everything in our power to prevent effect being given to that decision and to prevent any material aid from being conveyed to the Communist National Liberation Front for South Vietnam. The Government recognises that the situation in Vietnam is highly complex and is a matter for widespread discussion. We have never sought to prevent discussion or to repress dissent from the Government’s policies. My colleague, the Minister for Defence, expressed himself in pungent terms on this very matter three weeks ago. What he said then is, in essence, the Government’s view today.\n\nBut we have not regarded this decision of the students as representative of Australian student opinion, and I personally have not wished to magnify this matter out of its proper proportion, because if this were done not only might a false picture be given both inside and outside this country, but the very objectives of those who are seeking to attract prominence to themselves in this fashion would be served. Ordinarily one recognises the fact that on the extreme fringes of university opinion excesses are to be expected, but we are disposed to take a more serious view of the matter in current circumstances for two important reasons. One is that there is undoubtedly in Australia today a campaign of psychological warfare directed against the Government’s policies in Vietnam, and I am seeking information on the various aspects of this campaign. I would like to see how the student activities mentioned by the honourable member phase in, if they do, with any organised campaign of the kind to which I have referred. The second consideration, which weighs most heavily with this Government, is that young Australians are serving in Vietnam and giving effect to the policies of a government democratically appointed from a democratically elected Parliament, a government which enjoys a record majority in this place which it attracted because of the policies it has been pursuing in relation to Vietnam. We want these young men to know that they have the full backing of this Government and, I believe, of the overwhelming majority of the Australian people who, whatever their views on Vietnam, would condemn action by fellow Australians designed to assist those who are in military conflict with the young men of this country. So my colleague, the AttorneyGeneral, at the request of the Cabinet, has been studying the legal aspects of this matter, and it may be necessary for him or for me or for some other appropriate Minister to make a more detailed statement later on.\n\nI think it would be fitting for me to remind the House and the country of the origins of the so-called National Liberation Front. We have previously said that it is not national in any true sense, nor does it propose to liberate in any true sense as we understand that term. The plan to form a liberation front in South Vietnam was formulated at a congress of the North Vietnam Communist Party in September 1960. The National Liberation Front is a creature of the North Vietnamese Communist Party and does not constitute an organisation of internal revolt independent of Hanoi. It is an instrument of external aggression and subversion and, together with the regular forces of North Vietnam, is directed from Hanoi. That being the character of the organisation, any Australian who would knowingly give material aid to this body, and do so at the hazard of Australian lives, deserves the utter condemnation of this Parliament, and from this Government should expect appropriate action both to prevent material aid going forward and to deal appropriately with these activities wherever they are engaged in.\n\nMr WHITLAM:\n\nWERRIWA, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– I ask the Prime Minister a question supplementary to that asked by the honourable member for Bennelong. I ask it particularly in view of the reply of the right honourable gentleman that he did not have authoritative information about that part of the honourable member’s ques tion which related to the Australian Labor Party. Has the Prime Minister’s attention been drawn to the fact that yesterday at about 2 o’clock, after a meeting of my Parliamentary executive, a Press statement was released in which the executive pointed out that the Labor Clubs, so named, at the Monash, Melbourne and Australian National Universities are not connected with the Australian Labor Party and have never been connected with that Party, and further that the executive disagreed with the decisions and attitudes of the clubs? Has his attention also been drawn to the fact that at its meeting this morning the parliamentary Party as a whole passed a resolution the terms of which were released at about 11 o’clock this morning?\n\nMr HAROLD HOLT:\n\n– The honourable gentleman asks whether 1 know of statements made by his Party’s executive and whether I am privy to the proceedings of the Party’s caucus.\n\nMr Whitlam:\n\n– It was a public statement, a Press statement after each meeting.\n\nMr HAROLD HOLT:\n\n– Well, it has not come to my notice. I am sure that the Parliament will welcome the statements by the Leader of the Opposition that the Labor Clubs have no connection with the Australian Labor Party. I am not clear whether such statements have previously been made by the Leader of an Australian Labor Party. If they have not, the Party has taken a long time to dissociate itself from groups which, on the face of it anyhow, are working in support of the Party. I put this quite bluntly to the honourable gentleman: I frankly do not see all that much difference in principle between what these young students are proposing to do and the terms that came out of the Adelaide conference in which the Leader of the Opposition joined in decisions to serve an ultimatum on the allies of Australia in Vietnam under threat of withdrawal of Australian troops if that ultimatum were not observed.\n\npage 108\n\nQUESTION\n\nEDUCATION\n\nMr FULTON:\n\nLEICHHARDT, QUEENSLAND\n\n– I ask the Treasurer a question. Is it a fact, as reported in the Queensland Press during the recent recess and attributed to the Queensland Minister for Education, that Queensland spends less per capita on education than does any other\n\nState? Is the reason for this that the Commonwealth Government denies Queensland the same amount of money for education by way of loans and grants as it provides to the other States?\n\nMr McMAHON:\n\nTreasurer · LOWE, NEW SOUTH WALES · LP\n\n– The honourable gentleman should know that at the last Premiers Conference and meeting of the Australian Loan Council a greater amount of money was made available to the States in terms of percentage increases than we have made available for many years. The States were treated with generosity. If the honourable gentleman had listened to my Budget speech last night he would know that so far as education is concerned the Commonwealth’s contribution this year will increase to SI 94m. That is an increase of 35% compared with the contribution last year. If the honourable gentleman had chosen this morning to read the newspapers he would have seen that almost every newspaper in the country has praised the Commonwealth Government for the attitude it has taken.\n\nMr Fulton:\n\n– This is an allocation to all States.\n\nMr McMAHON:\n\n– Queensland gets its share in the same way as every other State. All States get their proper share. I remind the honourable gentleman that only a few years ago the Commonwealth Government increased Queensland’s revenue grant by a special allocation of $2m a year. Over the period of the grants agreement that increase, compounded, adds up to about $27m more than under arrangements applying to other States. I will check the figures and let the honourable member know the exact amount. I remind him of one other factor so that he may see everything in perspective: When this Government took over from the Chifley Government the amount that was allocated by the Commonwealth for education was comparatively only thousands.\n\npage 109\n\nQUESTION\n\nCHOWILLA DAM\n\nMr GILES:\n\nANGAS, SOUTH AUSTRALIA\n\n– I ask the Minister for National Development a question about the request for a cessation of work in South Australia on the Chowilla Dam. Is the Minister aware that no State or country has a better record of exploiting its meagre water resources than has South Australia?\n\nCan he assure the people of South Australia that sufficient supplies of water will be made available to them until such time as the Chowilla Dam is completed?\n\nMr FAIRBAIRN:\n\nMinister for National Development · FARRER, NEW SOUTH WALES · LP\n\n– As I am sure the honourable member would know, under the River Murray Waters Act tha South Australian Government is entitled to a share of water which, I think, speaking from memory, is 1,254,000 acre feet per annum, and this it will receive whenever there is adequate water in the river. The River Murray Waters Act states that in periods of restriction the water available shall be shared in the proportions of five to New South Wales, five to Victoria and three to South Australia. In other words, South Australia gets three-thirteenths of the available water in the River Murray at Albury. I point out to the honourable member that with the completion of some of the Snowy Mountains Authority works, there will be a considerable diversion of water inland. This eventually will reach about two million acre feet per annum additional water which will go into the headwaters of the Murray and Murrumbidgee Rivers. This will tend to reduce the number of periods of restriction.\n\npage 109\n\nQUESTION\n\nPENSIONER MEDICAL SERVICE\n\nMr COSTA:\n\nBANKS, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– I direct a question to the Minister for Health regarding the refusal of doctors to co-operate with the Government in the pensioner medical service. This lack of co-operation affects 41,000 pensioners who were brought into the scheme when the means test was amended last April. Will the Minister inform the House how the matter now stands? Does he think the action by the doctors is strike action? If so, will he see that the doctors are penalised in the same way as were Post Office employees when they went on strike for one day?\n\nDr FORBES:\n\nLP\n\n– The honourable gentleman will be aware that the pensioner medical service, ever since its inception, has been based on an agreement between the Government and the Australian Medical Association. When, earlier this year, I made my second reading speech on the National Health Bill which was designed to confer the benefits of the pensioner medical service on a new group of pensioners, I informed the House that the\n\nAustralian Medical Association had advised me that it was necessary that the question of the admission of any new group of pensioners be determined by the federal assembly of the organisation.\n\nThe honourable gentleman has asked where things stand. The federal assembly of the Association met in May and decided to defer a decision, pending an examination of questions of principle that were involved. I, of course, immediately sought a meeting with the federal executive and out of the discussions emerged a number of points. The first was that the Association had deferred a decision on the admission of the new pensioners, not refused to admit them as the honourable gentleman alleged when he asked his question. Secondly, the Association made it clear that the level of fees paid by the Government is not the reason for the deferral of a decision. What the Association is worried about are questions of principle which it believes to be important.\n\nIt is also clear that the Association has not yet formulated a policy based on those questions of principle. It has advised me that it expects to do so in the near future. For my part, I have told the Association that the Government would be willing and ready to examine any proposals it may have in respect of the long term future of the scheme but that in the meantime the Government believes the Association should treat the question of the admission of the additional pensioners as a separate question. The present position is that discussions with the Association are continuing. When they are completed the Government will consider its position. I assure the House that it is the objective of the Government to have these pensioners admitted to the service as speedily as possible.\n\npage 110\n\nQUESTION\n\nBENALLA MIGRANT CENTRE\n\nMr HOLTEN:\n\nINDI, VICTORIA\n\n– I address my question to the Minister for the Army, who will be aware that the Minister for Immigration last week announced that the Benalla migrant centre will not be required by his Department after 8th December of this year and that the Army is considering taking over the establishment. Is the Minister for the Army in a position to make a definite statement on the future use by his Department of the establishment at Benalla?\n\nMr Malcolm Fraser:\n\nWANNON, VICTORIA · LP\n\n– -I can tell the honourable member that, because of the increased use of accommodation and training centres by the Army in Victoria, the Army will have a use for the Benalla centre when it is no longer required by the Department of Immigration. We have not yet worked out in precise terms the use to which it will be put, but it is likely to be used for Citizen Military Forces and cadet camps. When further information is available I will provide it to the honourable member.\n\npage 110\n\nQUESTION\n\nAID TO VIETNAM\n\nDr J F Cairns:\n\nYARRA, VICTORIA · ALP\n\n– I ask the Prime Minister a question and preface it by reminding him that he announced a little while ago that he and the Attorney-General will be examining the position of certain university students who proposed to give aid to the National Liberation Front. In view of the Government’s basic proposition that Australian forces in Vietnam are not fighting the South Vietnamese but the North Vietnamese and China, will he, with the Attorney-General, also examine whether those people who sold $7m worth of tallow and steel to North Vietnam and $500m worth of wheat to China should be brought within the scope of any action that is proposed?\n\nMr HAROLD HOLT:\n\nLP\n\n– The honourable member for Yarra quite consciously has misrepresented and distorted the position. I have tried to make it clear that the examination my colleague will make is wider in its scope than the position of what I would view as a handful of university students. Certainly the overwhelming body of students in the universities and colleges concerned rejected the action that was proposed by the Labor Clubs there. As to our general position in Vietnam, the honourable gentleman knows that we are not at war with China and that there is no declared state of war between Australia and North Vietnam. What we are doing is to aid the Government and people of South Vietnam to resist aggression proceeding from North Vietnam and directed by the Communist Government in Hanoi. We are doing this in association with our allies to make the people of South\n\nVietnam secure and, importantly, to help maintain the security of South East Asia generally. I believe that the position is well understood by the Australian people. They rejected the alternative offered by the Party to which the honourable gentleman gives his support and of which he is a senior member. In those circumstances I do not know why the honourable gentleman tries to draw some parallel between the position of people inside Australia who propose to give material aid and the other instances that he has mentioned. He knows very well that exports to North Vietnam are prohibited by the decision of this Government.\n\npage 111\n\nQUESTION\n\nDISALLOWED QUESTION\n\n(Mr Wentworth having directed a question to the Prime Minister) -\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n– What is the number of the question?\n\nMr Whitlam:\n\n– Question No. 426.\n\nMr Bryant:\n\n– Question No. 43 1 also relates to this matter.\n\nMr Whitlam:\n\n– In addition, questions Nos 364 to 369 inclusive refer to this subject.\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n– Order! A question on the notice paper and the question asked by the honourable member are basically the same. Consequently, the question is disallowed.\n\npage 111\n\nQUESTION\n\nCHARTER FLIGHTS\n\nMr HAWORTH:\n\nISAACS, VICTORIA\n\n– I ask the Minister for Civil Aviation a question. I refer to two British charter airlines, Caledonian and Lloyd International, which want to fly relatives of British migrants to Australia for holidays and to fly migrants back to Great Britain for holidays. A fare of $500 has been mentioned. Will the Minister explain why these British charter lines have been refused the opportunity to provide this service?\n\nMr SWARTZ:\n\nMinister for Civil Aviation · DARLING DOWNS, QUEENSLAND · LP\n\n– This subject was raised also by the honourable member for Bonython just prior to coming into the House and I indicated to him that some investigations are being made into the matter at the moment. It is a fact that applications were received from two British charter operators for permission to provide a series of charter services for this purpose between Europe - particularly Britain - and Australia. The original applications for charter licences were not approved. In circumstances such as these it is normal for full investigations to be made.\n\nFairly regularly we have applications from charter operators in a variety of countries, and even from within Australia, to operate charter services, sometimes in direct competition with the international airlines, including our own international operator Qantas Airways Ltd. We considered this matter because of our desire to see an extension of travel to Australia, both for group purposes and for tourist purposes. Australia, through Qantas and through our own departmental representatives at discussions with the International Air Transport Association, has continually pressed for a reduction in fares. During last year we were successful in obtaining agreement to a reduction in fares for groups of this type. At the present time it is possible to carry people on a charter basis through the regular airlines at a rate down to 70% of the economy fare. In addition to this special arrangements are made for groups of people under the age of twenty-six years. So to some degree the persons referred to by the honourable member are covered by the existing arrangements which are quite legal within the terms which are agreed to by all countries in IATA and to which we subscribe very strongly.\n\nWe have to consider this matter from a variety of points, one of which is the protection and liquidity of our own international operator as well as the integrity of the other international operators who have rights to operate here, who operate on a regular basis to a regular time table and who provide a standard of operational safety which we insist on being the highest. Such a standard cannot be maintained in some circumstances by some charter operators.\n\nIn view of all the circumstances and as a refusal had been given in a number of other cases the decision was made at the time not to approve these two applications. However, we are continuing to look at this aspect to see whether, in addition to the success we had last year in reducing these particular charter or group rates, there is any other way in which they can be reduced further. It is our objective to encourage as many people as possible to use international air travel, for this purpose or for any other purpose.\n\npage 112\n\nQUESTION\n\nCIVIL AVIATION\n\nMr GRIFFITHS:\n\nSHORTLAND, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– My question is addressed to the Minister for Civil Aviation. Has his Government two civil airport policies: One for cities with limited trade and small populations and the other for Newcastle which is our third largest trading port in New South Wales? Has the Minister finally determined that Hexham is out for airport purposes for upwards of twenty years? Did he suggest that other areas south of the city might be suitable for that purpose? If so, will he say whether the Government will provide finance for the development of any such suitable area? Did the Minister recently visit the Shortland electorate and tell members of the Liberal Party that a site at Redhead might be suitable? If so. who was his adviser and was the statement a political one designed to embarrass the honourable member for Shortland. As I represent 30,000 Newcastle city electors and 32,000 lakeside electors, will the Minister tell the House why he and other Ministers have consistently shut me out of negotiations on an airport for Newcastle? Finally, when can I expect an answer to my telegram of a few weeks ago concerning what the Minister has in mind for Redhead?\n\nMt SWARTZ- Perhaps I should deal first with the latter part of the question. I did write to the honourable member, as he is aware, before I visited Newcastle about a fortnight ago advising that 1 would be there and indicating that I would be inspecting Williamtown and some other airports in the vicinity. This followed a meeting between representatives of the Royal Australian Air Force, my own Department and the local authorities in Newcastle when the difficulties of developing Hexham under the existing circumstances of the Williamtown RAAF Base were pointed out quite clearly. I visited the site and 1 confirmed that in a discussion with the City Council. I also met the honourable member for Hunter at Cessnock. We had a look at the area there. He assured me that this would be the best locality for an airport for the district. The proposals which were made by the honourable member and also by the local authorities there of course are naturally being examined at the present time.\n\nIt is a fact also that the local branch of the Liberal Party wrote to me and asked whether its representatives could see me when I was there. I saw them and they raised the matter regarding the Redhead and Pelican areas at which I had looked previously. The Council also raised as an alternative to Hexham another site in, 1 think, the Wallsend area. I have asked it to submit details regarding this site for consideration and examination. However, the problem is still the same regarding air space. The difficulties of civil operation from Hexham rule ii out at the present time. We have agreed with the Royal Australian Air Force on an extension of time for the use of the Williamtown base for civil operations. We hope that as a result of this agreement a better service will be provided there before very long. When I receive advice from the City Council in Newcastle regarding the alternative site we will examine the situation and contact the Council again at that time. The question of ownership is one which we will have to discuss further after some particular site has been selected as suitable outside of the controlled area. I do not doubt that under these circumstances we would have to discuss the question of local ownership.\n\nMr James:\n\n– The honourable member for Hunter was mentioned by the Minister for Civil Aviation. I claim that I was misquoted and I wish to explain.\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n– I suggest that the honourable member resume his seat at the present time and that when question time is finished he will be able to make a personal explanation.\n\npage 112\n\nQUESTION\n\nCIVIL AVIATION\n\nMr BOSMAN:\n\nST GEORGE, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– My question also is directed to the Minister for Civil Aviation and it refers to the cross-charter agreement that recently terminated between AnsettANA and Trans-Australia Airlines. Is it true the Viscount aircraft that were returned from Ansett-ANA to TAA were lacking in maintenance and restoration, firstly, in breach of the terms of the general agreement between the two parties and, secondly, in comparison with the DC6B aircraft that were returned by TAA to Ansett-ANA?\n\nMr SWARTZ:\n\nLP\n\n- Mr Speaker, I did see a report fairly recently in relation to the cross-charter arrangement made about two or three years ago which, as the honourable member said, terminated at the end of last year. The arrangement was for three Viscount aircraft to be leased to AnsettANA by TAA and two DC6B aircraft to be leased to TAA from Ansett-ANA. When the cross-charter arrangement terminated the aircraft were handed back and I can give a very definite assurance there were no maintenance problems whatsoever with either group of aircraft. I might mention that one of the Viscount aircraft, as honourable members are aware, was lost in Botany Bay, so only two of those were returned. Some work was done - and this may have been the basis of the report that appeared - because of some change in the layout of the flight deck. When the aircraft were returned both TAA and Ansett-ANA had to spend a certain amount of money converting the flight decks to their altered configuration. That was the only Change made at the time, and the maintenance on both sides was up to the standards required.\n\npage 113\n\nQUESTION\n\nSUEZ CANAL SHIPPING\n\nMr DUTHIE:\n\nWILMOT, TASMANIA\n\n– Does the Prime Minister recall my considerable correspondence with him since Sth July regarding the fifteen ships trapped in the Suez Canal and the representations I have made asking the Government to try to help solve this problem, especially on behalf of the fruit growers, who have 379,000 cases of apples and pears from four Australian States on four of the ships, including 200,000 cases from Tasmania? Has the Prime Minister any more to report regarding the negotiations over insurance that I understand are being carried out by the Australian Apple and Pear Board? If insurance negotiations fail and the growers suffer loss, will the Federal Government compensate the apple and pear growers for losses sustained under these unusual, unfortunate and unique circumstances?\n\nMr Harold Holt:\n\n– The Minister for External Affairs will answer this question.\n\nMr HASLUCK:\n\nMinister for External Affairs · CURTIN, WESTERN AUSTRALIA · LP\n\n– As the honourable member for Wilmot has reminded us. he has been in correspondence with the Government on this subject over recent weeks. The position is that there is fruit consigned from Australia to England in three out of four ships that are trapped in the Suez Canal as a result of the conflict in the Middle East. None of these ships is either owned or registered in Australia and none of them has aboard now any Australian crew members. Therefore, any negotiations with the Government of the United Arab Republic concerning the freeing of the ships would necessarily be done either by the owners or by the country of registration. We have no standing even to make representations regarding the conditions on board these ships because there are no Australians on board. The clearance of the Suez Canal and the shipping in it is something that is inextricably linked with the general termination of hostilities and negotiation of a settlement in the Middle East. So far as it can, the Government is keeping the matter under constant review and will certainly not spare any effort to ensure that Australian interests are observed.\n\nOn the question of compensation for those who may have suffered loss as a result of this unforeseen and unavoidable action, so far as the Australian Government is concerned I think that is a question that would involve both points of law and points of policy and would need the attention both of the Attorney-General and o£ the Government.\n\npage 113\n\nPERSONAL EXPLANATION\n\nMr JAMES:\n\n– Mr Speaker, I claim that during question time-\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n-Order! Does the honourable member claim that he has been misrepresented?\n\nMr JAMES:\n\n– Yes. In answer to a question asked by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Griffiths) the Minister for Civil Aviation (Mr Swartz) stated that I said that Cessnock was a better site for an airport than Hexham. I am afraid that I have been misquoted by the Minister. What I did say to the Minister was that if Hexham was not to be developed I considered that Cessnock was an excellent alternative. 1 might add that both myself and the Cessnock Council were very grateful-\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n-Order!

Honourable members will recall the suggestions which have been made that a government sponsored life insurance scheme should be introduced. Generally this proposal has been advanced in the context of the benefits available to servicemen arising from war service and has frequently been associated with claims that there are double standards in assessing compensation - that is, a superior standard in common law and an inferior one for war service.\n\nThere are difficulties, of course, in comparing repatriation benefits, which provide pensions and a wide range of other assistance, with lump sum awards, but I suggest that such comparisons as have been made are not supported by an adequate survey of the facts. I have had some calculations made of the present capital values of repatriation pensions and allowances. The amounts are substantial. They range up to about $15,000 for a married general rate war pensioner without children whose disability does not in fact preclude him from working though it may well reduce his earning capacity and prospects. For a married pensioner without children who is totally and permanently incapacitated, the amounts range beyond $50,000. I should emphasise, Sir, that these calculations take no account whatever of the repatriation benefits payable in respect of children, non-cash benefits such as medical and hospital treatment, which could represent a considerable sum over the life of the beneficiary, or of the increases in rates and values of benefits certain to occur over the beneficiary’s lifetime.\n\nA case in which a serviceman who was injured, rendered quadriplegic, and was awarded $82,000- actually $81,055- at common law has been referred to on many occasions as indicating in itself a need to review the level of repatriation benefits. That award included over $11,000 for loss of wages and hospital and medical expenses incurred prior to the court’s award. As the soldier injured in Vietnam is kept on full pay and provided with all medical treatment by the Army until repatriation benefits commence, the amount for comparison with repatriation benefits would be $70,000. At a conservative estimate, the present value of repatriation benefits, if payable in this case, would have exceeded $70,000. The Government has carefully reviewed the benefits provided under repatriation arrangements, which include a comprehensive system of compensatory pensions, medical treatment and related benefits, and a wide range of other assistance. We have concluded that the arrangements are working effectively and that they make appropriate provision for those who suffer incapacity due to war service and for the dependants of those whose deaths are caused by war service.\n\nSo far as personal life insurance is concerned, 1 have previously informed the House of advice received from the life offices that they will insure a permanent serviceman or national serviceman at normal premiums up to the date he is actually posted for service overseas in a battle zone or combat area. As stated by the former Prime Minister in 30th November 1965 there is, however, no uniformity of practice regarding the type of policy which may be obtained or the maximum sum which may be insured for. Some companies will issue only endowment insurance contracts under which the sum insured is payable at the end of a fixed term of years or on prior death; other companies have no restrictions on these aspects.\n\nDuring World War II it was customary for war clauses to be inserted in new policies issued during the continuance of that conflict. Frequently, however, the limitations imposed by such clauses could be reduced or removed by payment of an extra premium at a rate varying with the risks involved. During the 1950s, similar conditions applied in the case of servicemen who were under notice of posting to Korea or Malaya, and the position is substantially the same today in the case of servicemen proceeding to South Vietnam. The matter of life insurance for servicemen has been examined on several occasions and each time the Government of the day has concluded that having regard to Australian conditions adequate prevision was made under legislation to meet the immediate and future needs of dependants of personnel killed on active service. After further close examination, we are satisfied that this conclusion remains valid today and we have therefore decided against the introduction of a government sponsored life insurance scheme.\n\nThe Government has decided, however, as I announced in the Budget Speech, to seek an amendment of the legislation governing defence forces retirement benefits to admit to the benefits of the scheme certain categories of servicemen who are now excluded because they enlisted for periods of less than six years. This extension of the scheme will give cover to national servicemen, who are enlisted for two years. If any of these servicemen now to be covered is discharged through invalidity or dies, he or his widow and children will receive the same pensions or other benefits as permanent members of the forces. On norma] discharge, these servicemen will receive a refund of contributions. As I pointed out in the Budget Speech, servicemen are, in addition, covered by the repatriation legislation while serving in special areas such as Vietnam. Thus, for example, a married private soldier totally and permanently incapacitated as a result of war service will receive a pension of $3 1.50 per week under the defence forces retirement benefits legislation, together with a basic tax free pension of $34.55 per week under the repatriation legislation. In addition, of course, further repatriation benefits are provided in respect of children and by way of medical and hospital treatment. The details of the extension of the defence forces retirement benefits scheme are now being settled and the legislation will be introduced as early as possible.\n\nI present the following paper:\n\nDefence Forces Retirement Benefits - Ministerial Statement, 16 August 1967- and move:\n\nThat the House take note of the paper.\n\nDebate (on motion by Mr Barnard) adjourned.\n\npage 115\n\nQUESTION\n\nASIAN AND PACIFIC COUNCIL\n\nMinisterial Statement\n\nMr HASLUCK:\n\nMinister for External Affairs · Curtin · LP\n\n– For the information of honourable members I present papers relating to the Second Ministerial Meeting of the Asian and Pacific Council which was held in Bangkok from 5th July 1967, and I ask for leave to make a brief statement on the same subject.\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n– There being no objection, leave is granted.\n\nMr HASLUCK:\n\n– Last month in Bangkok I represented Australia at the Second Ministerial Meeting of the Asian and Pacific Council. The papers which I have tabled are: the joint communique, which was signed by the ten Ministers who were present; a copy of the statement I made on behalf of Australia at the public opening session; and a precis of a statement I made in closed session during the debate. The reason why I give only a precis of the third of these documents is that I do not feel at liberty to publish part of the confidential records of the Council, but at the same time I thought that the Parliament was entitled to have an outline of the subjects on which ( spoke.\n\nIn the spirit of ASPAC each nation expresses its views fully in the way that it thinks best without necessarily seeking to commit other nations to its views. Where, as the result of discussion and consultation, we reach a consensus that consensus is expressed in the communique.\n\nDiscussion on all matters of regional interest are an essential part of the intention with which ASPAC was formed. It provides a process of continuous consultation. It also provides the opportunity for cooperation in all matters of common interest, both inside the various regional and global organisations to which all members belong and within the framework of ASPAC itself.\n\nASPAC already includes nine members, namely Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Republic of China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, New Zealand and Australia, and one observer nation, Laos. It is our hope that, as the usefulness of the council is appreciated, other nations of the region will feel disposed to join in our discussions. Because of that hope we have hitherto avoided taking up rigid positions on matters under discussion-\n\nI should like to emphasise that ASPAC is an outward-looking organisation which is not directed against any State or group of States. It is a free association of likeminded countries who believe that through close co-operation they can contribute to the well-being of the nations in the broadest sense. It is an association of equal partners and, from our own point of view, it is particularly encouraging that so many countries of Asia have shown that they want Australia to be their full partner in these discussions.\n\nI had the honour of being elected vicechairman of the session in Bangkok and, later in the meeting, it was decided that the next meeting of the council would be held in Canberra. One consequence of this decision is that, throughout the next twelve months, the Standing Committee of ASPAC, which acts as the means of consultation between Ministerial meetings, will be meeting regularly in Canberra under my chairmanship. Thus, pending the holding of the third Ministerial meeting here in Canberra next July this city has become the diplomatic hub of an important Asian organisation.\n\npage 116\n\nQUESTION\n\nCHOWILLA DAM\n\nMinisterial Statement\n\nMr FAIRBAIRN (Farrer - Minister for\n\nNational Development) - by leave - In 1962 the River Murray Commission investigated a proposal to construct a dam on the Murray at Chowilla with a capacity of approximately 5m acre feet. Their investigations showed that without this dam all States bordering the Murray would be subject to water restrictions in drought periods but that the construction of Chowilla would result in a very considerable reduction in the frequency and severity of these restrictions. The estimated cost of the dam was $28m and the Commonwealth Government and the Governments of New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria, which all would be contributing equally to the cost, gave their approval to proceed with the project.\n\nAfter detailed site investigations the design of the dam was completed by the constructing authority - the South Australian Government - and tenders were called in October 1966. The estimated cost at that time was $43m. On receipt of tenders in April 1967 it became apparent to the Commission that the actual cost of the dam would be in the vicinity of $70m. In view of this greatly increased cost the Commission decided to reassess the benefits to be gained from Chowilla, taking into account the changes in basic data and operating procedures that had occurred since 1962. Major alterations in data or procedure which were considered in this study included: (a) A requirement to maintain certain minimum flows at Mildura to reduce the saline content of the river to an acceptable level for irrigation. (b) The evaporation loss from Chowilla was now estimated as much greater than assumed in 1962. (c) The capacity of the Blowering Dam on the Murrumbidgee River system had been increased from 0.8m to1. 3m acre feet.\n\nVery complete studies were carried out using a newly developed computer programme which gives a month by month simulation of the river system for the last fifty years. The studies showed that benefits equivalent to that received from the proposed dam could be derived from a smaller storage at Chowilla or possibly some other site in the Murray basin.\n\nIn these circumstances the River Murray Commission at its meeting on Friday, 11 tt August resolved that:\n\nHaving regard to the changed relationship between costs and benefits of the Chowilla project since it was previously assessed in 1962 the River Murray Commission recommends to contracting Governments that the project be deferred pending further investigations. Further, in view of the fact that the South Australian constructing authority is holding tenders for this work, it be asked not to accept any tender currently held and arrange to reduce all expenditure on the Chowilla project to a minimum as rapidly as possible.\n\nThe Commission is pursuing urgently its studies to provide the best solution to the problem of River Murray regulation. These will include further consideration of a storage at Chowilla in conjunction with other potential storages in the River basin.\n\nIn conclusion I should mention that the Prime Minister (Mr Harold Holt) received representations by telephone on this matter from Mr Dunstan, Premier of South Australia, on Monday, 14th August. He then asked Mr Dunstan to set out his views in writing and assured him that they would he thoroughly considered when received. 1 present the following paper;\n\nChowilla Dam Project - Ministerial Statement, 16 August 1967- and move:\n\nThat the House take note of the paper.\n\nMr WHITLAM:\n\nLeader of the Opposition · Werriwa\n\n– by leave - I should like to ask the Minister for National Development a couple of questions which I feel are important not only for the purpose of any resumed debate on this matter but also for the purpose of debate on the Budget or Estimates. Honourable members would be assisted in considering this matter if the Minister could say how much money has already been spent on this project, which the House approved in October 1963, and how much of that expenditure, as far as can be estimated now, would be rendered superfluous or redundant by the alternative schemes which the Minister has outlined. As regards the alternative schemes, is it proposed to introduce legislation to amend the Act which both Houses unanimously passed in October 1963?\n\nMr FAIRBAIRN:\n\nMinister for National Development · Farrer · LP\n\n– by leave - As 1 understand the situation, according to the South Australian constructing authority the amount expended on the site at present is about $5m. Obviously if the dam is not to be built that $Sm would be very largely a loss, although undoubtedly there would be some recompense from the sale of equipment.\n\nMr Whitlam:\n\n– Who would meet that loss?\n\nMr FAIRBAIRN:\n\n– The four parties to the agreement. If on the other hand the decision is, as appears possible - I would not say likely - that a dam, perhaps slightly smaller, is to be built on the Chowilla site, I would anticipate that nearly all of the $5m would be represented in work which was required in any case because it was mainly spent in site preparation of the foundations. As regards the introduction of other legislation, it would be my understanding that this would be required, but I am afraid that in the absence of a decision by the River Murray Commission and without technical knowledge On this matter I would not like to state so definitely.\n\nMr CHANEY:\n\nPerth\n\n– by leave- The Minister for National Development stated that Mr Dunstan, Premier of South Australia, had made representations to the Prime Minister (Mr Harold Holt) concerning this matter. Will the Minister agree that Government supporters representing South Australian electorates also have made strong representations on this subject?\n\nMr FAIRBAIRN (Farrer- Minister for National Development) - by leave - This is so. I referred to the representations made by the Premier of South Australia because it was a Premier to Prime Minister approach and the Prime Minister wanted this fact recorded. I acknowledge that representations have been made to me and to the Prime Minister by representatives of South Australian electorates. There has also been a great deal of interest shown from Victoria.\n\nDebate (on motion by Mr Whitlam) adjourned.\n\npage 117\n\nSTATES GRANTS (WATER RESOURCES MEASUREMENT) BILL 1967\n\nBill presented by Mr Fairbairn, and read a first time.\n\nSecond Reading\n\nMr FAIRBAIRN (Farrer- Minister for\n\nNational Development) [3.40] - I move:\n\nThat the Bill be now read a second time.\n\nThis Bill concerns financial grants to the States over this and the succeeding two financial years to accelerate the measurement of the flow of rivers and the investigation and measurement of underground water resources. Honourable members will know that, as a result of a recommendation by the Australian Water Resources Council, the Commonwealth and State Governments three years ago adopted an accelerated programme of surface and underground water investigations. The aim of the programme is to achieve a comprehensive basic network of stream gauging stations and to improve knowledge of underground water resources. Besides implementing its own accelerated programme in the Northern Territory, the Commonwealth has been assisting State programmes by making available, under the States Grants (Water Resources) Act 1964, grants totalling as much as $2.75m over the three year period 1964-65 to 1966-67. This three year period ended on 30th June last and, accordingly, the States have prepared programmes of proposed works for the next three years. These programmes have been endorsed by the Water Resources Council, with a recommendation that the Governments take action for their implementation.\n\nIn deciding three years ago to collaborate with the States in the accelerated programme of water resources assessment, the Commonwealth Government accepted the need for a ten year programme of construction of stream gauging stations in order to establish at least a basic network, and also accepted the need for an accelerated programme of underground water investigations. Thus, when the Government was considering the forthcoming three year period, the only question requiring decision was the extent of Commonwealth assistance and we have decided to increase our contribution by a significant margin.\n\nBefore I proceed to give the Government’s proposals in detail and to outline the provisions of the Bill, I think it would be helpful if I were to review briefly progress made so far under the programme. During the three-year period of the State Grants (Water Resources) Act 1964, programmes submitted by the States for stream gauging activities have provided for the improvement of 163 existing stations and the construction of 368 new stations, and annual expenditure has increased from less than $lm in 1962-63 to $1.8m in 1966-67. Of the latter figure the Commonwealth has provided over one third. Total expenditure in the three year period was approximately $4.9m. There are now about 1,600 stations in operation.\n\nIn the period 1962-63 to 1966-67 annual expenditure on underground water assessment has increased from approximately $lm to about $2. 2m. Of the latter figure, the Commonwealth has provided $350,000. Activities on a large range of projects in most areas of all States have been stimulated. Total expenditure in the three-year period was approximately $5.8m. Progress with the work of underground water assessment has been such that in the light of new knowledge the Water Resources Council has asked for preparation of a new underground water map of Australia to replace that published with the ‘Review of Australia’s Water Resources, 1963’.\n\nThe success of the overall programme is exemplified by the fact that in the year just completed, the States undertook programmes considerably in excess of requirements to attract the full Commonwealth subsidy. This was particularly so in the case of underground water. The Governments involved have reason to be well satisfied with the progress made so far. However it was apparent to the Water Resources Council that, if the objectives of the programme as envisaged three years ago were to be achieved, a further expansion of effort was needed; and this is reflected in the programmes planned by the States for this and the next two years.\n\nThe surface water programmes total $6.6m, which is an increase of $1.8m on the programmes for the period just completed and $800,000 more than the estimates given in the original ten year programmes which were based on costs in 1962-63. Apart from a general increase in the cost of materials and labour which has occurred since the original estimates were made, the State authorities are experiencing a rise in the unit cost of establishing and operating each stream gauging station as these activities extend into the more remote areas and involve the more difficult streams. The underground water programmes also total $6.6m which is an increase of $1.6m on the programmes covered by the 1964 Act.\n\nThe Government now proposes to make available a total of S4.5m by way of grants to the States, to enable the planned programmes to be achieved in the next three years. I might say, and it gives me some pleasure to do so, that this figure represents an increase of 60% over the level of Commonwealth aid in the past three years. In making this increased contribution, the Commonwealth contemplates that the States will increase their own contributions in order that the objectives endorsed by the Water Resources Council may be achieved. The current legislation does not of course cover the Northern Territory. Arrangements are being made by my colleague, the Minister for Territories (Mr Barnes), for a continuation of the accelerated programme of water resources measurement in the Northern Territory.\n\nThe distribution of Commonwealth funds over the three years is set out in the schedules of the Bill, but for the convenience of members I give the figures briefly now. For surface water the totals are: 1967-68 - $770,500; 1968-69 - $830,900; 1969-70 - $926,000. For underground water the totals are $625,100, $663,350 and $684,150, respectively.\n\nI turn now to the Bill itself, the provisions of which are similar to the 1964 Act which it is designed to follow. Provision for grants in respect of expenditure by the States on stream gauging is contained in clause 4. Commonwealth grants will be provided, in accordance with the details specified in the First Schedule, to assist the States to attain the programme of expenditure necessary for the establishment of the basic network of gauging stations by 1974. In respect of each State, the Commonwealth grant will be the amount by which the expenditure exceeds the base year figure, until the base expenditure is doubled, after which the grant is on a dollar for dollar basis up to the ceiling set out in the schedule.\n\nFinancial assistance for underground water investigation and measurement is provided for in clause 5 of the Bill. In this case the Commonwealth pays two-thirds and the State one-third of the expenditure over and above the base amount up to the maximum shown in the Second Schedule. The Commonwealth totals have been allocated between the States on the basis of the States’ own proposed programmes of water resources assessment for this and the next two years.\n\nThe Bill also contains a number of machinery provisions of the kind normally incorporated in measures of financial assistance to the States. These include provision for approval of the proposed programmes by the Minister, provision for the making of advance payments to the States, and provision for submission of progress reports. The provision of works to conserve and use our water resources must be preceded by thorough investigation of the resources involved, so that adequate basic data for rational development are available. The programme of water resources assessment which all governments are undertaking has been devised with this end in view. I have much pleasure in commending the Bill to the House.\n\nDebate (on motion by Mr Luchetti) adjourned.\n\npage 119\n\nHAYMARKET TELEPHONE EXCHANGE, SYDNEY\n\nApproval of Work - Public Works Committee Act\n\nMr KELLY:\n\nMinister for Works · Wakefield · LP\n\n– I move:\n\nThat, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1913-1966, it is expedient that the following proposed work be curried out without having been referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works: Construction of three additional equipment floors and one plant and amenities floor to the Haymarket Telephone Exchange, Sydney.\n\nIn October 1956 the Public Works Committee reported favourably on the proposal to erect a six-storey telephone exchange building in Haymarket, Sydney, and recommended that provision be made to strengthen the foundations and frames to take additional future floors. The building was constructed accordingly. Additional accommodation is now required urgently and it is proposed to complete the building by the addition of three equipment floors and one floor accommodating air conditioning and other plant and amenities at an estimated cost of $820,000. The design of the extensions will follow closely that of the existing building.\n\nMr CHANEY:\n\nPerth\n\n– As the Minister for Works (Mr Kelly) said, in 1956 the Public Works Committee reported on the original building and recommended to the Government that it should strengthen the foundations to enable the work now proposed to be undertaken when necessary. The recommendation now is that the further floors be added. In the circumstances, little will be gained by the Committee undertaking a further study of the proposal and it supports the motion.\n\nMr WENTWORTH:\n\nMackellar\n\n– I think that the motion should be supported and the work undertaken as a matter of urgency because of the difficulties that could arise in the telephone system in Sydney if the work is not carried out speedily. I am given to understand that the work will provide for 15,000 new metropolitan telephone lines, for 3,000 new automatic telex services, for 20,000 trunk and junction channels and for 4,000 trunk switching inlets. I have spoken in the House previously about the inadequacy of the plans of the Postal Department to make telephones available in the city of Sydney and the extravagance involved in emergency measures that may become necessary in the future because of the lack of foresight. Anything that is done now to provide new services is to be commended.\n\nOne feature that should weigh favourably with the House is that this new installation will allow a greater subscriber trunk dialling service, known as STD, in the centre of Sydney. Sydney has not been fairly served with STD by the PostmasterGeneral’s Department in the past. I have here a letter from the Department, dated 4th July last, which says that STD in Sydney is available to 11.5% of subscribers, in Canberra to 100%, in Melbourne to 50.6%, in Adelaide to 8.2% - a little worse than Sydney - in Brisbane to 78% and in Perth to 88.6%. It is shocking that Sydney, the premier city of Australia, should have been allowed to lag behind in this way.\n\nThis is not fair treatment. It is quite evident from the statistics provided to the House by the Postmaster-General (Mr Hulme) earlier in the year that Sydney has not had a fair go. The shortage of lines in Sydney, which is revealed by the number of deferred applications, is quite out of proportion with the position in Brisbane, a town favoured by the Postmaster-General, and in Melbourne, a town favoured by his Department. It is ridiculous that Sydney should have STD access for only 11.5% of subscribers whereas Melbourne has access for 50.6%, Brisbane 78% and Perth 88.6%. This is not a fair position. It shows that the Postmaster-General’s Department has not provided as well for the future in Sydney as it has in certain other capital cities. 1 ask the Postmaster-General for a specific statement as to what he intends to do in the course of the next few years to provide more STD channels for Sydney subscribers and how he proposes during the next two years to narrow the unfortunate and unfair gap that exists between Sydney and Melbourne and between Sydney and Brisbane. The Postmaster-General is in the House. This is an important matter. No doubt he will have the figures at his fingertips and will be in a position to make a statement to the House in a moment. 1 content myself at this juncture by commending the motion to the House. The proposed work may be an inadequate means of closing the present gap and giving Sydney a fair go, but at least it is a step in the right direction and perhaps we should be thankful for the small mercies - they are small mercies - that Sydney receives from the Postmaster-General’s Department.\n\nMr BOSMAN:\n\nSt George\n\n– I feel bound, for two reasons, to support the proposition put by the Minister for Works (Mr Kelly). I am a member of the Public Works Committee and I recognise the significance of the points that have been made by the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth). It is obvious that the Postmaster-General’s Department recognises the urgent need for this work to be done at the Haymarket telephone exchange. I may be accused of extravagance and exaggeration if I say that the Public Works Committee in 1956 should have recommended that this work be done then. However, the Committee acted wisely in recommending that the foundations be strengthened to enable the extra floors to be added after the building had been completed. However, the Postmaster-General’s Department may have erred by being too cautious in not seeking to have this work done in 19S6.\n\nThe information given by the honourable member for Mackellar is quite correct. However, he omitted to say that the 11.5% in Sydney covers 62,000 services. He pointed out that the proposed work will enable another 20,000 services to be provided. Easy calculation shows that this will mean an increase of only 4%. Even when the work is finished, only 15% of subscribers in Sydney will have access to STD services. 1 have waxed long on the need for the Pitt Street exchange and 1 know that the Minister for Works and the Postmaster-General (Mr Hulme) are trying to speed up the construction of this building. But unquestionably what the honourable member for Mackellar said is true. The telephone system in Sydney is a long way from meeting requirements. The PostmasterGeneral has made statements on the position in Sydney, but we cannot get away from the fact that a lot of mileage has yet to be made up in the Sydney metropolitan area. I commend the Minister for Works for recommending that the proposed work be carried out without having been referred to the Public Works Committee and I hope that the work will be undertaken quickly. I understand that tenders can be called by November and that the work may even be concluded by June next year. I sincerely hope that this project will come to fruition as planned by the Department and that we will see some effort made to make up the leeway. Perhaps a reflection of the action by the Treasurer (Mr McMahon) in the last few days for a reconstruction of the Postmaster-General’s Department, together with efforts by the Minister for Works and the PostmasterGeneral collectively will result in a new era in which we can overtake or at least reduce the leeway in the standard of service in Sydney and also in the availability of services in Sydney, particularly in the telecommunications field.\n\nQuestion resolved in the affirmative.\n\npage 121\n\nWIRELESS TELEGRAPHY BILL 1967\n\nSecond Reading\n\nDebate resumed from 10 May (vide page 1929), on motion by Mr Hulme:\n\nThat the Bill be now read a second time.\n\nMr WEBB:\n\nStirling\n\n– This Bill, which was introduced in the latter stages of the last sessional period, is to amend the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1905-1966 to deal with pirate radio stations which could be established beyond Australian territorial waters but close enough to broadcast programmes to Australian audiences. There have been a few attempts to establish pirate radio stations near our shores. Two recent attempts have come to our notice; one was off the coast near Sydney and the other off the Gold Coast of Queensland. The one off the coast of New South Wales was planned to transmit programmes from three miles outside the Sydney Heads. It was reported that the Sydney university students who planned this station gained the technical information needed for its construction from the Postmaster-General’s Department. One of the students wrote to the Department saying that he was writing an essay on British pirate radio stations and needed technical information. The PostmasterGeneral’s Department was good enough to supply the information which was required to build the transmitter.\n\nIt is surprising how these pirate radio stations have been named after the gentle sex. Pirate broadcasting commenced off the Dutch coast in 1962 when Radio Veronica started beaming to Dutch audiences. Veronica came to a sad end when the ship was seized by the Dutch Government. Radio Caroline had two ships, one operating off the Essex coast and the other off the Isle of Man. I do not know whether she was able to seduce the Isle of Man, but this station seems to have been quite a problem to the British Government. We have not had much experience of pirate radio stations operating near Australia. The first one which was planned by the group of students to which I have referred was christened Radio Gloria. She was not much of a lady because, according to Press reports, she came on the air with a ninety second raspberry and then lapsed into silence. The report did not say whether the raspberry was directed against the Postmaster-General (Mr Hulme) who had indicated that he intended to jam the station. It is possible that the station operators had some foreknowledge of the proposed increased postal charges which were announced at about the same time as the Wireless Telegraphy Bill. The PostmasterGeneral may be able to inform the House why these stations are named after ladies. After all, we usually name our atmospheric disturbances after members of the fair sex. Hurricanes have been named Dora, Elsie and Gloria. We never seem to be able to find out why.\n\nApparently this legislation is directed more towards the syndicate planning to operate a pirate radio station off the Queensland coast. The ‘Australian’ of 6th March 1967 carried the following item:\n\nA spokesman for the syndicate, Mr J. K. McCarthy, said: ‘We will not be breaking any law of the Commonwealth Constitution in transmitting from international waters.\n\nIf Mr Hulme is convinced the station will be illegal, why isn’t he planning court action instead of trying to jam us out of existence?’\n\nThe report went on to say that this pirate station was being backed by sixteen prominent Gold Coast businessmen and that it would broadcast from a ship anchored seven miles off the Surfers Paradise coast. We have not heard any more of the station recently - at least I have not heard of it - so perhaps it has gone out of existence or the idea has been dropped. The PostmasterGeneral was faced with the problem of how his Department could legally deal with these pirates. There is a deal of information from the United Kingdom and some European countries which have been faced with the problem of pirate radio stations. As I have mentioned already, the Dutch Government was the first one to be faced with this problem. That was in 1962. Although Mere was some doubts about the legality of the move, the ship was seized by the Dutch Government.\n\nAnother station was operated by Lord Sutch from a fort in the Thames. The venture ended with one person being drowned and another marooned at the fort, if I remember the reports correctly. In 1964 Radio Caroline and two others were started near the British coast. According to reports Radio Caroline said that it cost £Stg275,000 per year to run its two ships and that advertising revenue amounted to £Stg750,000. These stations were so suc cessful in Britain because of advertising. As is well known, cigarette advertising is banned on television and radio in Britain because of its harmful effects on teenagers. The pirate radio stations were able to broadcast cigarette advertising in a big way. Because the stations were catering for the young, the cigarette companies were providing quite an amount of the revenue for advertising which had an appeal to the teenager. The pirate stations here would not have that source of revenue to the same extent because we have no ban on cigarette advertising, either on television or on radio. In fact the Government encourages our teenagers to smoke by allowing glamorous advertisements, particularly on television, in which we often see lovely looking girls in bikinis advertising not only their wares but also different brands of cigarettes.\n\nDespite the recommendations of the National Health and Medical Research Council regarding the banning of the advertising of cigarettes on television and radio the Postmaster-General so far has evaded his responsibilities in this direction. It is well known that the Government collects a lot in excise from the sale of cigarettes and that this is a source of revenue which is most important to the Government. Apparently it is more important than the health of our young people. The cigarette companies do not need pirate radio stations here to advertise their cancer causing goods because the Government enables them to advertise on commercial television and radio.\n\nIn January 1964 Britain and ten European countries, signed an agreement to outlaw broadcasts transmitted from outside national territory. Britain is now internationally committed to the ending of pirate radio stations. The agreement is known as the European Agreement for the Prevention of Broadcasts Transmitted from Stations outside National Territories. We in Australia are fortunate that the same problem does not arise because we are not close enough to other countries to be worried by other pirate radio stations. The only ones that we are concerned with are pirate radio stations which may be established here. It is important to remember that these stations can be a real danger to shipping because their transmissions can be on the same wave length as a ship to shore radio. In this way ships can be endangered. The safety of life at sea and navigation makes this legislation most important, provided that it is armed with sufficient teeth to do its job. Of course, we are not opposing the legislation but we will propose certain amendments to it.\n\nI now wish to refer to a publication entitled ‘Legal Aspects of Pirate Broadcasting - A Dutch Approach’ by a Professor of International Law at the University of Leyden. He had this to say:\n\nThe very nature of radio and television broadcasting requires its regulation by governmental authority. Unlike Press and film, the use of which is - in principle - available to everyone, the limited number of broadcasting frequencies available makes it impossible to establish an unlimited number of broadcasting stations. Hence the need for ‘traffic control’. Without such control, the indiscriminate use of the available wave lengths, disregarding the legitimate interests of existing broadcasting stations and the needs of sea and air wireless communication and of radio navigation, would lead to chaos in the ether and harmful interferences with other radio stations, and might even endanger human life.\n\nThat gives some indication as to why it is important to have this legislation.\n\nThe Postmaster-General pointed out that Australia is a signatory to the International Telecommunication Convention and the associated radio regulations. One regulation specifically prohibits the establishment and use of broadcasting stations on ships. Another regulation lays down that no transmitter may be established or operated without an authorisation from the government in question. This Bill seems to meet the provision of the Convention and the regulations. It makes it an offence to establish or maintain a transmitter on a ship for an unauthorised purpose. It also makes it an offence to assist in unauthorised broadcasts or to render service for the operation of the ship and transmissions. It goes on and extends the jurisdiction of the courts in the States and Territories in order to cover these offences.\n\nIn the final paragraph of his second reading speech the Minister said that the Bill was less comprehensive than the legislation which it was found necessary to introduce in Great Britain. That is true enough. This legislation does not go as far as the British legislation. The United Kingdom legislation, for example, provides that a person is guilty of an offence if he advertises or invites another to advertise on a pirate radio station. The publishing of any advertisement relating to a station from which broadcasts are made or are to be made or the times at which a broadcast is to be made is an offence. We on this side of the House propose to introduce an amendment which will provide that a person shall not enter into any contract, agreement or arrangement for advertising knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that it was done in connection with an unauthorised broadcast. That would bring the legislation somewhat into line with the United Kingdom legislation. These stations could not operate if it were not for advertisements. So I think it is very important that we should give consideration to this amendment which would deal with the source of revenue of these stations.\n\nThe pirate stations in the United Kingdom were making a fortune. They appealed to the teenager. There were no talks on these stations, no weather reports and no news - just pop music which was served up by disc jockeys who were teenagers or near teenagers themselves. They talked the same language as their audience. With the records that were used free of copyright and with the low advertising rates the pirates were doing very well indeed. Radio London, for example, is said to have made a profit of £500,000 sterling a year. Many manufacturers have found the pirates a useful media for advertising their products. Maxwell House, Horlicks, the International Publishing Corporation and cigarette companies have made use of these stations.\n\nIt is interesting to note that in the report of the debates in- the House of Commons the main debate seemed to centre around the question of advertisements. The Tories seemed anxious to save the advertisers from any punishment as a result of supporting these stations by advertising on them. Here, of course, the Government has looked after those who would be advertisers, if a pirate station were ever established, by not providing any penalty for illegal advertising on these stations. The Minister himself has indicated that there are weaknesses in the Bill. This is one of them. I hope that he will have another look at this matter and perhaps have some second thoughts about it during the course of this debate. lt is true that there may be some difficulty regarding international advertisers, as happened in London, but an advertiser located in Australia could easily be caught. In the House of Commons debate the point was raised that the Gillette company possibly could get away with illegal advertising because the parent company was located in the United States of America whereas the Wilkinson Sword company would be effectively prevented from advertising its razor blades because it was a British company. But that does not alter the fact that we should follow the British Act and treat advertising on a pirate radio station as an offence. The British Act also makes it an offence if a newspaper publishes any advertisement relating to a station from which broadcasts are made. For example, the publishing of a programme of an illegal station is banned. We do not go that far. If we were faced with that situation we could do something about it. It would be an intolerable situation if a newspaper were allowed to publish advertisements or programmes on behalf of some pirate radio station which in fact was committing an illegal act. As I have said, this happened in the United Kingdom and action had to be taken in a Bill to make this practice an offence. Incidentally, I understand that the legislation which was passed last year came into effect only yesterday.\n\nIn the debate in the House of Commons the Tories used the argument that the Government was interfering with the freedom of the Press. They were quite prepared to allow the Press to defeat the will of Parliament. The British Act makes it quite clear that anybody in the country who gives assistance to pirate stations is liable to conviction under the Act The Opposition will propose an amendment the terms of which have been circulated. I shall deal with this question of illegal advertising on pirate radio stations when that amendment is debated in the Committee stage.\n\nA further amendment that we will propose provides that there should be a higher penalty for the main offender and a lesser penalty for an offender who may be an accessory. The Minister has all of the offences jumbled up together in the BilL Everyone, whether he be the main offender or somebody who may have supplied that person with some gear, would suffer the same penalty. In our amendments we also provide for trial by jury, but I shall not deal with that matter at the present time. It will be better dealt with when we are discussing the amendments. Possibly the Minister has had an opportunity during the recess to study these amendments. He might be prepared to indicate that some of them are acceptable to the Government. I sincerely hope that they are acceptable because I cannot see anything in them that would do anything but assist in making this legislation much better for the purpose for which it is being introduced.\n\nMr CONNOR:\n\nCunningham\n\n– The House is indebted to the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Webb) for his interesting and informative dissertation. 1 propose to deal with other aspects of this measure which we do not oppose fundamentally but in respect of which we think certain amendments ought to be accepted by the Government. One of the main points that I want to stress is the unique nature of this legislation. It illustrates some of the difficulties and limitations arising from our present limited Commonwealth Constitution. Our Constitution has been described as having been drafted by 1890 parliamentarians using as a model legislation of the United States of America of the 1780s. The Australian Constitution has been altered less than that of possibly any other country of similar advanced economic circumstances. In point of fact, our Constitution was drafted and adopted during a period when many of the modern means of communication were unknown. We live today in an age of revolution in communication; we live in an age when there is instant intercommunication between the whole of the human race. Our Constitution was never intended to deal with the present situation; it was framed before television, before radio, before earth satellites, before space exploration, before the complete change in the dissemination of information, before the changes in reading habits and in communications generally that have resulted from the scientific revolution of the last fifty years. As <a matter of fact, it is generally agreed among constitutional lawyers that our Constitution had to be strained to the limit - and good sense had to be used in the process by the High Court Bench - to enable even the existing legislation on wireless telegraphy to stand up to the assaults of the various people who had vested interests in subverting it. The chaos which exists today in certain parts of the world is typical of the failure of the human race to get together and act in concert.\n\nEven this legislation is delightfully vague in its drafting. It might well have been patterned on that of the United Kingdom. I refer in particular to the preamble to the Bill, which describes it as a Bill for an Act to deal with broadcasting from ships in waters adjacent to the territory of Australia. To where do the territorial limits extend? It is true that the PostmasterGeneral has cited the provisions of an international convention on telecommunications, but we are coming to the point where there almost needs to be some ceding of national powers to an international body to deal with situations such as will arise in the implementation of this legislation. At present there is only the threat of pirate stations operating substantially off the Australian coast. Nevertheless the Government has chosen to be prompt and vigilant in introducing legislation that is pretty stern and sharp in the penalties that it provides - much sterner as to penalties than the comparable legislation in the United Kingdom.\n\nIt is worth examining the differences between this Bill and the English Act. For instance, our proposed legislation deals solely with broadcasting from ships. It does not deal with broadcasting from aircraft and it certainly does not deal with broadcasting from other stations that could be constructed - and I cite the work that is going on in the Bass Strait today - off the coastal waters of Australia and outside the territorial limits. In other respects, too, the United Kingdom legislation is infinitely more precise than this Bill. For instance, it does not try to cast a very wide net and so leave itself open to the legal challenges that would undoubtedly occur at a later stage. The United Kingdom legislation is precise in its definitions. The prohibition on operation in the case of the United Kingdom legislation relates to stations on any ship or aircraft within United Kingdom territorial limits. There is a further prohibition on United Kingdom ships or aircraft that are elsewhere, and I think that that is quite a reasonable approach. There is also a prohibition on operation from ships or aircraft that are within certain United Kingdom waters. The United Kingdom legislation also attacks the problem from another viewpoint entirely; it applies to citizens of the United Kingdom who are operating broadcasting stations on nonUnited Kingdom ships or aircraft on or over the high seas or from objects on the high seas. These are a much better approach and a much fairer definition.\n\nI fully support the strictures of the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Webb). Here we have a situation under our Bill where a party to a crime - you might say, in a certain sense the principal in the crime - is exonerated, and the accessories through whom the crime is to be perpetrated are made the principals in the crime. There is no justification for the Government to bypass the terms of the English legislation. I quote clause 6 (2) of the Marine, etc., Broadcasting (Offences) Bill, which was passed in 1966 by the United Kingdom Legislature, as follows:\n\nWhere an offence under this Act which has been committed by a body corporate is proved to have been committed with the consent or connivance of, or to be attributable to any neglect on the part of, a director, manager, secretary or other similar officer of the body corporate, or any person who was purporting to act in any such capacity, he, as well as the body corporate, shall be guilty of that offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against accordingly.\n\nThe English Act goes on to provide that proceedings may be instituted at any time within two years of the commission of the offence. No time limit is prescribed in this Bill. Presumably the law of the State in which a prosecution is instituted will apply. In addition to that, the penalties provided are very stringent indeed and far exceed those in the United Kingdom legislation. In particular, there is a sweeping provision whereby an offending person may be fined very heavily or committed to a term of imprisonment not exceeding five years. That provision is loose in its terms. How the prosecution shall be instituted is virtually at the discretion of the Commonwealth. Section 9 of the Act in its present form provides:\n\nProceedings for any offence against this Act may be instituted in any Court of Summary Jurisdiction, and any person proceeded against under this section may be dealt with summarily or may be committed for trial.\n\nWe will be moving an amendment to provide that the accused person will at least have some discretion as to whether or not he will be tried by a magistrate, because if this provision is applied in its present form we will have the outrageous situation where power is conferred on a stipendiary magistrate, a police magistrate or a bench of magistrates to commit a man to prison for five years. In most States of Australia I think the limit in summary jurisdiction is two years’ imprisonment, and in many cases it is even less than that. I would like to hear from the Minister the justification for giving a magistrate in a summary jurisdiction the extreme power to impose such a savage, penalty. The alternative to this, of course, is the badge of freedom known as the jury system. This is something that has been fought for and won over the centuries. It is something which at present certain bureaucratic thinkers desire to circumvent. We hear arguments advanced that in certain civil actions the right of trial by jury should be abolished. In the matter before us a person has no right whatever to elect whether or not he will stand his trial before a jury of his fellow men. After all, a jury is a cross section of public opinion and in the final analysis it is from the jury that we get a true expression. There must be unanimity amongst those twelve men, and every man who is up for trial for his liberty is entitled to that elementary protection.\n\nThe Minister in his second reading speech referred to problems arising from the present situation. He referred particularly to the radio frequency spectrum being public property. He also said that the public was entitled to an assurance that appropriate control was being exercised. Certainly, the Opposition would agree with these most laudable sentiments. However, is that any justification for an attempt to hand out a penalty to the extent that is envisaged? Let us have a look at the penalties that are provided for in the English legislation. There, the penalty in a case that is covered by summary jurisdiction is a fine of £100 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding three months, or both. In the case of a conviction on indictment the penalty is a term of imprisonment not exceeding two years or a fine or both. What justification does this Government have for asking that a five year penalty be imposed by a magistrate in summary jurisdiction, in contra distinction to the English legislation? Undoubtedly in England there are pirate radio stations which are a humbug and a menace. The House of Commons after mature consideration has decided on penalties which are considered to be fair and reasonable in all the circumstances. I do, not propose to address myself further to the Bill at this stage. However, I will deliver my further observations during the Committee stages.\n\nQuestion resolved in the affirmative.\n\nBill read a second time.\n\nIn Committee\n\nThe Bill.\n\nMr WEBB:\n\nStirling\n\n– I refer to clauses 4 and 6 of the Bill, which read:\n\nAfter section 6 of the Principal Act the following section is inserted: - “ 6a. - (1.) Except as authorized by or under this Act, a person shall not, on a ship outside Australia but in waters adjacent to Australia -\n\nestablish, maintain or use any station or appliance for the purpose of transmitting broadcast programmes by means of wireless telegraphy, or\n\ntransmit a broadcast programme by means of wireless telegraphy. “ (2.) A person shall not, in Australia or in waters adjacent to Australia -\n\nsell or otherwise supply to another person any goods knowing, or having reasonable cause to believe, that the goods are for use -\n\nin or in connexion with the making of unauthorized broadcasts; or\n\nin or in connexion with the navigation, working, operation or maintenance of a ship used, or to be used, in or in connexion with the making of unauthorized broadcasts;\n\nmaintain or install, or do any act or thing in or in connexion with the maintenance or installation, of any appliance or apparatus knowing, or having reasonable cause to believe, that the appliance or apparatus is used, or is to be used, in or in connexion with the making of unauthorized broadcasts;\n\ndo any act or thing in or in connexion with the navigation, working, operation or maintenance of any ship which the person knows, or has reasonable cause to believe, is used, or is to be used, in or in connexion with the making of unauthorized broadcasts; or\n\ntransport any goods to a ship which the person knows, or has reasonable cause to believe, is used, or is to be used, in or in connexion with the making of unauthorized broadcasts. “ (3.) In the last preceding sub-section, ‘ unauthorized broadcast’ means the transmission, except as authorized by or under this Act, of a broadcast programme by means of wireless telegraphy from a ship outside Australia but in waters adjacent to Australia.\n\nPenalty: One thousand dollars or imprisonment for a term not exceeding Five years.”.\n\nSection 9 of the Principal Act is amended by inserting in sub-section (1.), after the words “ Court of Summary Jurisdiction “, the words “having jurisdiction with respect to the offence”.\n\nI seek leave to move four amendments.\n\nThe CHAIRMAN (Mr Lucock:\n\nLYNE, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– There being no objection, leave is granted.\n\nMr WEBB:\n\n-I move:\n\nIn clause 4 -\n\nAfter sub-section (1.) of proposed section 6a insert the following penalty: “ Penalty: One thousand dollars or imprisonment for a term not exceeding Five years.”.\n\nAt the end of sub-section (2.) of proposed section 6a add the following paragraph:\n\nenter into any contract agreement or arrangement for advertising, knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that such advertising is to be done in or in connection with an unauthorised broadcast.”.\n\nIn sub-section (3.) of proposed section 6a omit the penalty, insert the following penalty: “ Penalty: Five hundred dollars or imprisonment for a term not exceeding One year.’.”.\n\nIn clause 6 -\n\nOmit the clause, insert the following clause: “ 6. Section 9 of the Principal Act is amended -\n\nby inserting in sub-section (1.), after the words ‘ Court of Summary Jurisdiction ‘, the words ‘having jurisdiction with respect to the offence; and\n\nby omitting all words after’ section’ in subsection (1.) and inserting in their stead the words ‘maybe committed for trial or, “with his consent, dealt with summarily’.”.\n\nAt the outset I draw attention to the first amendment. The Opposition does not oppose the Government’s amendment in clause 6. After sub-section (1.) of proposed section 6a, the Opposition wants the words Penalty: One thousand dollars or imprisonment for a term not exceeding Five years’ inserted. This proposed section deals with the principal offender. He is the person who has established, maintained or used the station or appliance for the purpose of transmitting or broadcasting programmes. The penalty in this case may be considered in that regard.\n\nOur amendment of sub-section (2.) directs attention to the fact that the people con cerned are secondary offenders and that although they may be culpable as accessories they should not suffer the same penalty as the principal offenders. Proposed sub-section (2.) (a) states that a person shall not: sell or otherwise supply to another person any goods knowing, or having reasonable cause to believe, that the goods are for use -\n\nin or in connexion with the making of unauthorised broadcasts; and so on. Paragraph (b) states that a person shall not: maintain or install, or do any act or thing in or in connexion with the maintenance or installation, of any appliance or apparatus . . .\n\nParagraph (c) states that a person shall not: do any act or thing in or in connexion with the navigation, working, operation or maintenance of any ship which the person knows, or has reasonable cause to believe, is used, or is to be used, in or in connexion with the making of unauthorised broadcasts.\n\nFinally, paragraph (d) provides that a person shall not: transport any goods to a ship which the person knows, or has reasonable cause to believe, is used, or is to be used, in or in connexion with the making of unauthorised broadcasts.\n\nFor instance, the person concerned may only have been providing provisions for the ship without giving any thought to the fact that he was committing an offence. Some offences committed under proposed section 6a, sub-section (2.), could be quite minor ones compared to that of the main offender. Such offences would not warrant the threat of a $1,000 fine or five years imprisonment. The Opposition is not opposing what the Government seeks to do in sub-section (2.). However, we are opposed to the same penalty being applied to the secondary offender as is applied to the main offender. We think that there should be a different penalty. I shall refer to this shortly.\n\nI want to draw attention to our second amendment which relates to new paragraph (e). We want this to follow paragraph (d) in clause 4 of the Bill. Our amendment is designed to provide that a person shall not: enter into any contract agreement or arrangement for advertising, knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that such advertisingis to be done in or in connexion with an unauthorised broadcast. [ mentioned this matter a while ago. I again point out that these illegal stations could not operate if it were not for advertisements. However, there is not a penalty in this Bill for those who may supply the advertisements. In the United Kingdom most of the advertisements appeal to the teenager. I pointed out earlier that these stations do not broadcast talks or weather reports. They are interested only in the teenagers. Of course advertisements are actually making this form of broadcasting available. I think the lack of penalty for advertisers is a weakness in the Bill. It is one of the weaknesses to which the Minister referred in his second reading speech. I repeat that the British Act makes it an offence for a newspaper to publish advertisements relating to a pirate station from which broadcasts are made. The publishing of programmes is barred and the British Act makes it quite clear that anyone in the country giving assistance to pirate stations is guilty of an offence. In this legislation we should do likewise. I still do not think that the offence in the case of a secondary offender is as serious as that of the major offender.\n\nAs I said earlier, I do not think that a secondary offender should be subject to a $1,000 fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years. Our third amendment seeks to omit the penalty and to insert Penalty: Five hundred dollars or imprisonment for a term not exceeding One year’. This means that a lesser penalty would apply to what could be construed as the lesser offence. We say that the penalties that appear in the Act at present are far too severe to meet all cases. The penalty for the secondary offender should not be as severe as that for the principal offender. The. honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Connor) pointed out that the British legislation lays down different penalties. He pointed out that on summary conviction a person is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months or to a fine not exceeding £100, or both. Upon conviction on indictment, the penalty in Britain is imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or a fine, or both. In comparison, the penalty provided for in this Bill is very severe, particularly for those who commit the secondary offence. That is why we suggest that something should be done about the matter. The penalty appropriate to a particular case is decided by the court. We in this Parliament are responsible only for setting the upper limit to the penalty. In our opinion, the upper limit for the worst kind of offence covered by proposed new section 6a (1) of the principal Act should be higher than the upper limit for the secondary offences dealt with in proposed new section 6a (2).\n\nI turn now to another provision in the Bill and to our proposed amendment, which was mentioned at the second reading stage by the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Connor). We propose an amendment to section 9 (1) of the Act which, in conjunction with that proposed to be inserted by this Bill, will have the effect of making the sub-section read:\n\nProceedings for any offence against this Act may be instituted in any Court of Summary Jurisdiction having jurisdiction wilh respect to the offence, and any person proceeded against under this section may be committed for trial or, with his consent, dealt with summarily.\n\nAt present no option is given to the individual charged. This Act relates to very serious offences as well as to secondary offences. Let us consider the position of a person charged with a serious offence for which he may be fined $1,000 or be imprisoned for a term not exceeding five years. As was mentioned in a debate in another place during the last sessional period, the thread that runs through all our laws is the principle that when a citizen is charged with a serious offence he has the right to trial by jury. Section 9 of the Act affects a person who may have committed an offence which, at the option of the prosecution, may render him liable to imprisonment for five years on conviction by a jury. But, without the person charged having any say in the matter, the court can deal with him without a jury. In other words, he may be dealt with in summary jurisdiction before a magistrate and, on conviction, may be imprisoned with or without hard labour for any period specified in the Act.\n\nThe serious feature of this situation is that a person charged may be proceeded against without being accorded the right of trial by jury despite the fact that he is charged with a major offence. The Crimes Act contains a provision that in most instances specifies that a person may be dealt with summarily only with his consent. Similar provision does not exist in this Act. The amendment that we propose will make this kind of provision. As the Act stands, a person charged with a serious crime could be summarily tried. He may be innocent of the crime and he may say: ‘I am not concerned about whether the punishment on conviction is imprisonment for six months or for five years. What I am concerned about is proving that I am innocent. I consider that if I am to do this I should have the right to trial by jury.’ The proper principle for us to adhere to is that a man charged with a serious offence is entitled to trial by jury. We want to ensure that an)’ person in such a situation has that right and we appeal to the Minister to look at the matter from that standpoint.\n\nMr HULME:\n\nPostmaster-General and Vice-President of the Executive Council · Petrie · LP\n\n– Mr Chairman, I want to make only one short reference to my second reading speech. At the end of it, I stated:\n\nThe Bill is much less comprehensive than the legislation which it has been found necessary to introduce, for example, in Britain in order to deal with the pirate radio problem in Europe. Nevertheless, it is expected that the Bill will be adequate to deal with the situations which are likely to arise in the Australian env"
