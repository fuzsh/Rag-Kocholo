        "text": "Fairsea (1941)\n\nSitmar Line\n\nDimensions: 492 x 69 ft (150 x 21.1 m)\n\nBeam: 21,1 m\n\nRegistered Tonnage: 11,833 tons gross (13,432 tons after 1958)\n\nBuilt: 1941 Sun Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co, Chester, Pennsylvania, USA\n\nOperator: Sitmar, Genoa\n\nSpeed: 16 kn\n\nPropulsion: Doxford geared diesels / single screw\n\nPassengers: 1,460\n\nShipping Line: Sitmar Line\n\nFormer names: Rio De La Plata 1941, Charger 1942-1949\n\nIn February 1939, an American shipping company, Moore-McCormick Line, ordered four cargo ships, with accommodation for about 70 passengers, to operate from New York to the east coast of South America. They were to be the first American passenger vessels to be fitted with diesel machinery, in this case two 6-cylinder Doxfor diesels geared to a single shaft.\n\nLaunched on March 1, 1941, the originally named Rio de la Plata, was taken over by the US Government in October and was fitted out as an escort carrier for the U.S. Navy. Handed over to the Royal Navy under the Lend-Lease agreement, she was renamed HMS Charger and was commissioned on March 3, 1942. Later in 1942, the vessel was returned to the Americans and placed into U.S. Navy service in the Pacific, serving with distinction as the USS Charger.\n\nCharger was released from naval service on March 15, 1946, and returned to the U.S. government and placed under the management of the Moore-McCormack Line who proceeded to remove her flight deck and converted her to carry troops. This service was brief and she was soon mothballed together with other ships of her class in the James River. Like her many sisters, she was placed on the market.\n\nIn 1949, she was purchased by Alexander Vlasov, founder of Sitmar Lines who placed her under the management of the Alvion Steam Ship Company. Renaming her the Fairsea, she headed for Genoa where she was reconstructed as a emigrant passenger ship with very basic and austere accommodations for a massive 1,900 persons. Its purpose was to transport displaced people and refugees from Europe to Australia on the Bremerhaven-Sydney route.\n\nFairsea laid in wait for a short time while a contract was obtained from the International Refugee Organisation (IRO), before beginning her life as an immigrant ship.\n\nCarrying 1,896 displaced perons, she departed Naples, Italy for her maiden immigrant voyage to Australia on May 11, 1949, reaching Melbourne on June 9. The second voyage left Naples on July 21, going to Newcastle, where the 1896 passengers left the ship on Agust 20. The third voyage, from Naples on September 21, berthed in Melbourne on October 19, while the fifth trip only went as far as Fremantle, arriving on March 3, 1950 with 1,898 passengers.\n\nOn January 22, 1951, Fairsea disembarked 1,902 passengers in Melbourne, but on its next voyage, it was carrying only 1,393 displaced persons when it arrived in Melbourne on April 24, 1951.\n\nIn February 1952, when the IRO contract ended, Sitmar opened an office in Sydney to take advantage of the lucrative Australian trade and began to offer paid passage on the Fairsea to Australia. On April 7, 1952, Fairsea departed Amsterdam and sailed by way of the Panama Canal to Australia for the first time, but the route later reverted to departures from Bremerhaven. After a number of these trips, in April 1953, Fairsea was taken off the Australian trade to make six round trips between Bremehaven and Quebec, offering accommodation for 40 first class and 1,400 tourist class passengers.\n\nIn November 1953, a fire broke out of the engine room which was quickly extinguished, but required rapid cleanup of the flooded engine room in order to continue her voyage. In December 1953, she received some cosmetic changes, including to her funnel and mast.\n\nIn 1955 the Fairsea was sold to Sitmar (Societ√É Italiana Trasporti Marittimi) and was charted by the Australian Government to transport assisted British migrants to Australia for Southampton-Sydney service, later Greenock-Quebec, Bremen-Greenock-Quebec-Montreal-New York. She was the first non-British ship to be allocated to do so. Chartered by the Australian Government to transport assisted immigrants from Britain. On December 6, 1955 left from Southhampton for the first time. In February 1957, she crossed the Tasman for the first time to visit New Zealand, then crossed the Pacific for its first transit of the Panama Canal. In July 1957, Fairsea the first of three round trips from Bremerhaven to New York, then was withdrawn for six months to undergo an extensive refit in Trieste.\n\nWith the 1957-8 refitting, the external appearance of the ship was changed considerably and her lines more pleasing. Her superstructure was raised by one deck, and the forward section was plated in, with extensions forward and aft of promenade deck adding new public rooms. Internally, the accommodations were improved and full air conditioning was installed. Emerging in April 1958, the tonnage had been increased to 13, 432 gross. The refitted Fairsea offered accomodation for 1,460 tourist class passengers, and was transferred from Panamanian to Italian registry, and to the ownership of Sitmar Line.\n\nThe Australian Government charter was renewed and she continued operating as an immigrant ship carrying British migrants to Australia, and also making voyages to New Zealand.\n\nIn 1961, Fairsea was given another extensive refit - the accommodation was further upgraded, and capacity reduced to 1,212 in one class. On December 18, 1962, Fairsea departed Sydney on the first Sitmar Line cruise, visitinig Brisbane, Noumea, Tonga, Suva and Auckland. Subsequently, she made occasional cruises from Sydney.\n\nIn 1968, Fairsea reverted to Panamanian registry with the registered owners being Passenger Liner Services Inc., while still operating as a unit of the Sitmar fleet due to be withdrawn in 1970.\n\nFinal Voyage\n\nOn January 14, 1969, Fairsea left Sydney for New Zealand and Southampton with 986 passengers on board. On January 23, located around 900 miles west of the Panama Canal, midway between Tahiti and Panama, she suffered a fire in the engine room. The ship and most of her vital facilities, such as the galley, air-conditioning, toilets, water distilling equipment were all disabled, and she listed. \"After a number of days of reasonable hardship, considering the crowd onboard, a sea-going tug reached our ship and they proceeded to pump the diesel oil from the ship to the tug, but they then discovered that the fuel was unsuitable for the tug and now we had another situation, for suddenly the tug itself was left helpless and drifting.\"\n\nFortunately, the U.S. freighter Louise Lykes, on its way home from Viet Nam, arrived on the scene on January 29 and towed both the Fairsea and the tug behind it to Balboa. Sadly, the strain was so great that Fairsea's captain, Ciro Cardia committed suicide in his cabin. Upon arrival in Balboa on February 3, the passengers were then flown to their destinations from Panama, while Fairsea was inspected to decide her fate.\n\nBeing one of a very few ships to have been fitted by Doxford-geared diesels, spare parts were no longer available. Repairs were thereby considered to be uneconomical, so the vessel was sold to shipbreakers in Italy. On July 9, 1969, Fairsea left Panama under tow by the tug Vortice, arriving on August 6, 1969 at La Spezia where the ship was broken up.\n\nThe Fairsea made a total of 81 voyages to and from Australia between 1949 and 1969.\n\nImmigrant Passenger Experiences\n\nBefore the 1957 refit, the minimal conditions of the Fairsea were not lost on her passengers - many immigrants remember the large open dormitories and stark surrounds.\n\nFrank Kriesl migrated from Hungary in 1951:\n\n'The Fairsea was huge, a converted troop ship with no cabins, just huge big open spaces with triple decked bunks, so cramped you couldn't sit up straight in them. Men were assigned to one section, women to the other. The toilet and shower facilities were one huge long one . and everywhere you went there was an awful reek of 'White King'. People threw up because of the smell not just the swell!'.\n\nDifferent voyages created a variety of different experiences. For some passengers, the journey on the Fairsea was an adventure.\n\nDoreen Hakowski (formerly Sillett) migrated from England in 1956:\n\n'The Fairsea - our home for 5 weeks, was the best part of my early life. I had been born in an air-raid shelter in London, so only knew destruction around me. My trip was very exciting. We had lovely meals, dances, entertainment, deck games, swimming and many other pastimes. We stopped off in Aden and rode a camel through the streets. I can't even remember feeling sad at leaving my home country, England.'.\n\nSee also:\n\nShip Voyages of World War II Refugees to Australia\n\nImmigrant ship voyages Fremantle, Australia:\n\nhttp://www.immigrantships.net/v3/1900v3/fairsea19500302.html\n\nSources:"
