The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10 a.m. in Room SR-253, Russell Senate Office Building, Hon. John D. Rockefeller IV, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IV, U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA The Chairman. Good morning. We have, as usual, a complicated, potentially fluctuating morning schedule. I know that one thing will not fluctuate and that's the 11:00 o'clock vote, and I'd like to get as much of this done but will come back if more members, I hope, will appear. We have Georgia and Alaska and West Virginia, which should be enough to cover the country but there ought to be more people here and they probably will be here. And I'm very glad that you are and first of all, I want to say to the Coast Guard that I feel very sad about the helicopter crash that happened in Mobile Bay, and it was just Tuesday night, wasn't it? Admiral Salerno. Yes, sir. The Chairman. My thoughts and the Committee's thoughts are with the families and also with the Coast Guard on this because the Coast Guard is a family unto itself. Admiral Salerno. Thank you, sir. The Chairman. I got that correct, didn't I? All right. Let me give my opening statement. Senator Rubio will be along and Senator Isakson has a one-hour-and-three-quarter speech. One minute? OK. I knew that actually. It's fun teasing you. He's a good friend. He's a Braves fan. The cruise ship industry is large, it's successful and it's very profitable. The industry's revenues top $25 billion a year. Nearly 13 million Americans, including a couple of my own children, took a cruise last year, although I think they did it the year before. But they enjoyed it. The industry is growing with larger and larger ships entering service every year. Some ships will carry over 5,000 passengers and a crew, and I can't speak for Alaska and Georgia but in West Virginia terms that would be a modern cruise ship carrying the entire population of most West Virginia towns. So they're floating private cities. A unique and complex set of international rules governs the operations of the ship and the safety of the passengers. This is a safety committee, the Commerce Committee. We are a safety committee. We do many things but safety is always on top. I believe that these rules work, really, to protect the companies more than to protect their passengers. If there are those who disagree with it, I'm sure they will so say. In any event, we're here today to examine whether existing regulations are in fact sufficient to protect the health and safety of passengers and the fragile ocean environment in which they operate, and I recognize some of you testified yesterday before the House and this is something that I've wanted to do for a long time and so please don't be troubled by so much attention. Or be troubled by so much attention. In addition to reviewing the industry's safety and environmental record, I believe that we must ask why an industry that earns billions and uses a really very wide variety of Federal services from the Coast Guard to the Customs Bureau to the Centers for Disease Control pay almost no corporate income taxes at all. Good morning, Senator. I just started. Senator Rubio. Good. I was watching you on TV. The Chairman. Trust me, when something goes wrong with a cruise ship, it is always the Coast Guard that comes to the rescue, and this is a time when the Coast Guard is fighting for revenues, has 45-year-old ships which are trying to break up ice in Alaska in northern territory and we can't get the money to build new ships. It's an embarrassment, and they're strapped for cash because they don't get the same attention that the Marines do or that the Air Force does. But they do in this committee. We care about the Coast Guard a lot. And the Coast Guard is struggling. The entire Federal Government is struggling to maintain critical missions. Everybody's cutting back. All of our offices here are streamed into every day by people who are making very legitimate requests for projects that need to be funded in our various states and we can't always give them very good news. We have to tell them the truth about what's happening here. But in any event, in spite of all of this, it's inconceivable to me that with this amount of Federal help that comes to the help of a cruise ship when it runs into trouble that this industry doesn't pay some part of a fair share of the services they're getting for it. I think it's sort of unique that way. For any mode of transportation, safety must be priority number one. That's the way we look at things here. We're very, very glad when companies make a lot of money and we're very, very glad when passengers are very safe, and we tend to focus more on the second than on the first because that's more of our mission. The rarity of major cruise ship accidents suggests, in fact, that an industry has an excellent safety record, and let that be on the record. But the recent sinking of the Costa Concordia off the Italian coast is, in fact, a stark and tragic reminder that no mode of transportation is 100 percent safe. There aren't so many cruise ships around that when you have an incident with two or three that it doesn't represent a disproportionately large share of difficulties. The reports from the survivors of the Costa Concordia do not inspire confidence, at least in this Senator, in the industry's ability to respond to a major accident. There's a wonderful person, Martha Manuel, who is a constituent of mine who was a passenger on board this particular ship and she said that there was a clear lack of communication from the ship's staff. She survived the accident because she refused to follow the instructions, which were to go back to her room, which could have been the end of her, and so she went elsewhere and survived. But the point, obviously, isn't just what happened to her. But is there a pattern of safety? What do you do when there's a crisis? Is the crew trained? Do they practice the training? There are hundreds and hundreds of crew members, I think maybe 900, 800 crew members on these ships, and they have to-- from the captain on down--they have to properly train so that passenger evacuation procedures not are only in place but have been practiced and therefore do work. When accidents do occur and lives are tragically altered, passengers have little recourse against the cruise ship operators. Complicated ticket contracts limit passenger rights and antiquated laws prevent passengers from collecting fair compensation. Our laws have not kept up with the changes in the industry and I believe that we must revisit them. Although major accidents are, in fact, rare, and let that be understood, the environmental damage caused by cruise ships happens not so rarely. Happens all the time, and it's a particular source of angst for me. These floating cities produce enormous volumes of sewage and solid waste, and just three miles from shore they can do that because then they're out of our jurisdiction as a country. A cruise ship can discharge thousands of gallons of raw sewage and they sp do, and they dump a significant amount of solid waste at sea. I've often joked without humor about having a hearing on one of these floating, you know, two or three square miles of just trash and awful things that float in various parts of our world's oceans. Obviously, I'm not going to do that. That would be unwise and I would no longer be Chairman and I like being Chairman. But the dumping of all of this waste really gets to me because it's against the law, it is not in tune with what a modern industry should be doing and a profitable industry should be doing. So the practices of the industry, I think, have to come under scrutiny. Unfortunately, the Coast Guard, as I've indicated, has very limited resources to police against these discharges. Where in the world would they be happening? They can't follow all of these ships. And there may be a possibility of seeing them from eyes in the sky, and my guess is you probably could see them. But the point is we cannot continue to let our oceans fill with trash and fill with debris. It's a little bit like space. We have so much stuff up in space now that it's dangerous not only for our country for falling debris but also for other spaceships that are up there. It's just getting dangerous. Americans consider debris a part of their heritage and cultural pursuit. It's not a wise idea for any of us. So I think we have to adopt stronger laws to protect our fragile marine ecosystem, which is part of what this committee is charged with. As taxpayers, we deserve to have the industry pay its fair share. Without numerous government services, the industry could not operate and it's time that they contributed to the cost of helping with the expense of the government services they receive. So just in ending, I think our children and grandchildren deserve an ocean environment free of trash--I believe that very deeply--and sewage and hazardous materials. The industry needs to do more to protect the environment for future generations and so we will talk about this and other subjects. [The prepared statement of Senator Rockefeller follows:] Prepared Statement of John D. Rockefeller IV, U.S. Senator from West Virginia The cruise ship industry is large, successful, and vastly profitable. The industry's revenues top $25 billion a year.

It is time that they contributed to the costs that they impose on the government. Our children and grandchildren deserve an ocean environment free of trash, sewage, and hazardous materials. The industry needs to do more to protect the environment for future generations. Now, I turn to Senator Rubio for his opening remarks. The Chairman. And I turn now to my distinguished colleague, Senator Rubio, for his opening remarks. STATEMENT OF HON. MARCO RUBIO, U.S. SENATOR FROM FLORIDA Senator Rubio. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to begin by thanking you for holding this hearing and for all of you for being a part of it, especially Director Bill Johnson from the Port of Miami, my hometown. So I appreciate you being here today. Just want to also let you know I'll be back and forth today because there's also a hearing going on in Foreign Relations regarding Syria, which is critically important as well but I definitely wanted to be here for the start of this and I've read all of your testimony on this important issue. Let me begin by just offering my condolences to the Heil family who lost two family members, Barb and Jerry, on the January 13th, 2012, Costa Concordia cruise ship off the coast of Italy. The sad thing about it is that from all indications it's a tragedy that could have been avoided. As Captain Doherty points out in his testimony later today, ships run aground because someone made a terrible mistake or was negligent, and in this case, while I understand we're still waiting for the final report, all the indications point to a captain who not only crashed a ship but abandoned it before ensuring the safety of any of the passengers. Despite this, I commend both the Coast Guard and our domestic cruise line industry for their quick response to the incident. The Coast Guard immediately offered assistance to the government of Italy, and through the Cruise Lines International Association the industry immediately made corrections to their own mandatory muster drills and continue to search for voluntary improvements through their own cruise industry operational safety review that was launched in January, late January, in response to the incident. The industry's quick response I think is a testimony to the industry's self-accountability, and rightfully so. This bad news hurts the industry more than anyone else. This is whether it's bad news from time to time when you turn on the television and hear about some people getting food poisoning on a cruise to these kinds of things. The cruise industry has always taken this stuff seriously because above all else it is about customer service. And the cruise industry is largely built on return customers and people just won't come back if they had a bad experience or if they watch the news and think they're going to have a bad experience. And so that's why we see such a high level of self-accountability in the industry and I think that's a very positive thing. What we'll hear in today's testimony is that the industry has, in addition to its long history of ensuring through voluntary policies, the stewardship of both the safety of the passenger and also environmental protection, you'll also hear that we have a very robust and safe cruise industry that supports thousands of jobs in Florida and across the United States. There are more than 230 ships worldwide in the cruise ship fleet and 176 of them, over 75 percent of those cruise vessels, were operating in North America in the year 2010. The North American cruise industry generated $37.85 billion in the U.S. in economic benefits and supported nearly 330,000 jobs here in America in the same year. That's a bright spot in our bleak economy, and in Florida, particularly in our port cities, I can tell you firsthand the impact that this industry has on the real lives of real people. I'm proud to say that the state of Florida accounts for 60 percent of all U.S. cruise embarkations and we hope to make that 61 percent and growing. And so we're excited about that and we're excited about expansions in some of our ports that will allow for an expansion in this. So as we hear today from Bill, the Port of Miami is one of the busiest cruise ports in the world. It handled more than 4 million passengers in the year 2011 and the Port of Miami is just one of several ports in Florida that support the cruise line industry--Port Canaveral, Jacksonville, Tampa, and others. So overall, the industry accounted for about $6.3 billion in my state and direct spending in 2010 that generated over 123,000 jobs in Florida. It means 123,000 families who make their living off the safety, the accountability and the prosperity of the cruise industry. So it's an important industry. It brings valued and high-paying jobs to it and, again, as we all hear this testimony today let's just remember that they've consistently shown their willingness to voluntarily make themselves one of the safest industries in our country. With that, Mr. Chairman, thank you for holding this hearing on an issue so important not just to our country but especially to my home state and, again, I've read all the testimony here today and look forward to asking some questions and I'll look forward to that in a few moments. Thank you. The Chairman. Thank you very much, Senator Rubio, the Ranking Member. And now I'm going to call on Johnny Isakson because he represents Georgia, which is bigger than our two states. And then I'm going to call on you, Senator Begich. Senator Begich. Only by population. STATEMENT OF HON. JOHNNY ISAKSON, U.S. SENATOR FROM GEORGIA Senator Isakson. Absolutely correct. You got a lot more mileage at sea than we do too. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for calling this hearing. I want to commend you on the timely calling of this hearing and I think it's a very important hearing for the Commerce Committee to conduct. Like Senator Rubio, I have another commitment so I will be in and out as well. But I started off here because I wanted to be sure and submit for the record and ask unanimous consent that the testimony of Lynda D. Sanford, a resident of my state who lost her mother on the high seas in a cruise in 2001, be entered for the record in this hearing. The Chairman. Absolutely. [The information referred to follows:] To: John Clark Rayfield, Republican Staff Director U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation From: Lynda D. Sanford Survivor of Capsizing on July 13, 2001 with Loss of Life U.S. Coast Guard Report 16732Subject: Written Testimony of Lynda D. Sanford Hearing on Cruise Ship Safety Lessons from the Costa Concordia AccidentDate: February 29, 2012 It has been more than a decade since I managed to survive the boating accident that killed my mother and 2 other cruise ship passengers and injured me and 13 other cruise ship passengers. I filed charges of negligent homicide against the boat driver and escorted the three corpses back to Los Angeles, California where I questioned what went wrong. The cruise line told me that our tragedy was a ``freak accident''. After burying my mother in Texas, I returned home to Atlanta, Georgia and contacted the cruise line attorney who had been flown to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico to interrogate me about my mother's death. The cruise line would not provide me with any more information and ignored my family's requests for answers. I was devastated after having flown across the United States to meet my mother in California for a 7-day mother-daughter cruise and returning with her corpse and no explanation for her death other than a ``freak accident''. I acquiesced to my family's request to sue the cruise line because our mother had died and was horrified to learn that we could not do so because all of my mother's children were adults. The Death on the High Seas Act (DOHSA) of 1920 did not allow us to sue for negligence resulting in the death of our mother, her pain and suffering as she drowned or the loss of her contribution to society as a bilingual, special education teacher and mother who raised five children without child support from our deadbeat dads. The U.S. Congress had allowed the cruise line industry to influence it when DOHSA was amended in 2000. Consequently, DOHSA by Wrongful Act entitles these legal remedies only to commercial aviation victims. The Death on the High Seas Act (DOHSA) of 1920 entitled my mother's corpse to receive only burial expenses! In 2006 and 2007 my Congressman, Congressman John Lewis of Atlanta, Georgia, co-sponsored Death on the High Seas Act amendments introduced by Congressman Lloyd Doggett for cruise ship victims. These bills held cruise lines accountable for negligent deaths regardless of the age of the victims. The amendments became a part of the original legislation of the Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act. However, again, the cruise lines' paid lobbyists successfully pressured the U.S. Congress to allow the cruise line industry to evade accountability. All of the protections of the Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act were in jeopardy in 2010 if DOHSA was not removed. So, DOHSA was removed and the Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act became law in July 2010-- including the requirement that all cruise ships have a man-overboard system within 18 months. The United States Coast Guard acknowledged in February 2012 that the cruise line industry has not implemented this provision of the law. Freedom of Information Act requests indicate that the U.S. Coast Guard spent over $900,000 for just two searches for cruise ship passengers whose bodies were never found. American taxpayers pay for these searches. The cost to the cruise line is nothing. Despite cruise line claims of safety, a 2008 U.S. Senate hearing divulged that cruise lines did not know how many passengers had died or disappeared from foreign-flagged cruise ships using American ports. The cruise lines did not keep count of the dead or missing because they were not required to do so. Consequently, complaints of negligent death when the deceased has no dependents continue to be dismissed from court because DOHSA does not allow surviving adult family the right to sue for the death of their loved one. The family of the deceased does not have the opportunity to have the facts of their loved-one's death heard and decided by a jury. Unlike DOHSA of 1920, state tort laws have evolved to reflect the value of human life in commercial maritime deaths. Every state in the United States has laws that allow victims to sue for financial damages for wrongful death. Some states also allow surviving family members to recover damages for the conscious pain and suffering of the deceased. Others also impose punitive damages for serious wrongdoing and to serve as a deterrent. In the case of wrongful maritime deaths, state law is superior to Federal law. It is inequitable, unfair, and inhumane to force cruise ship victims to apply the antiquated Death on the High Seas Act of 1920 to their loved one's death. My mother's life is no less valuable than an airline passenger's life and my family's grief is no less painful than the grief of any airline victims' family. The U.S. Supreme Court has recommended that Congress correct this inequity for maritime victims and there are no costs associated with making this change. By continuing to force maritime victims to do so, the U.S. Congress is telling survivors that the life of their loved is worthless in comparison to that of an aviation victim! The result is that cruise ship victims are victimized not only by cruise lines but by the United State Congress. I urge Congress to do what is was intended to do-- represent its people--by correcting the injustice of DOHSA of 1920 during the 100 year anniversary of the RMS Titanic tragedy that took more than 1,600 lives.

And I thank the industry for being represented. To Admiral Salerno, thank you for the many things the Coast Guard contributes to the safety and security of the citizens of our country on the high seas and thanks for what you do for the country. And to the others testifying, we look forward to hearing your testimony although I, like Senator Rubio, read it all last night because I knew I would be in and out. So Mr. Chairman, this is a very timely hearing on a subject that's of great interest to the people of my state and I appreciate your letting Ms. Sanford's statement be entered for the record. The Chairman. Thank you very much, Senator Isakson. As always, you're to the point and effective. Senator Begich, followed by Senator Nelson. STATEMENT OF HON. MARK BEGICH, U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA Senator Begich. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will be brief because I'm anxious for the opportunity to hear the testimony but also for the questions and answers. I have a state that has an enormous amount of impact with the cruise industry, 15,000 jobs approximately in our state, related to the cruise ship industry a $1 billion-plus economic impact. But along with that, we have the largest single Coast Guard base in the country in Alaska. So I'm anxious to have this hearing. I know in Alaska we have taken exceptional steps in Coast Guard, relationships with our cruise ship industry and our local community in making sure we have not only, I think if not the highest standards pretty close to the top highest standards of environmental standards that the cruise ship industry worked with us on as well as safety standards where we were able to do some things where we put pilots on the cruise ships, which is very unique to a lot of ports. So I think we have a lot to talk about today but also from Alaska's perspective I think a lot to show off of steps we have taken. We consider ourselves a domestic port. Many people consider us an international port in a lot of ways because the coastline is so diverse and lengthy. So, again, Mr. Chairman, thank you for this opportunity. I'm anxious to hear the dialogue and discussion and then, of course, as you know, Mr. Chairman, I will always be bragging about Alaska's unique steps that we've taken to improve another industry that's so important to our country. The Chairman. I thank you, and actually Alaska probably gets a pretty large percentage of these boats because that's spectacular territory. Senator Begich. We're getting more every day and that's why I was a little concerned when Senator Rubio said he wants to grow his to 61 percent. We want him to go down, ours go up. So we're working it. The Chairman. All right. Well, you two guys work that out on your own. [Laughter.] The Chairman. Senator Nelson. STATEMENT OF HON. BILL NELSON, U.S. SENATOR FROM FLORIDA Senator Nelson. Mr. Chairman, thank you for doing this. Senator Rubio and I have the busiest cruise port in the world, which is Miami, and when you combine all the cruise ports that we have--Everglades, which is at Fort Lauderdale; Cape Canaveral, which has become famous because of the Disney cruises, although Carnival is there and other lines as well; Jacksonville, another major cruise port, as well as Tampa-- these are major cruise lines and ports. And so we've got our port director here of Miami, Bill Johnson. He's going to be contributing mightily to this conversation. And, of course, this cruise industry produces 120,000 jobs in Florida and untold amounts of economic activity because of this phenomenon that cruise guests fly in and they stay a night or two, getting ready for the cruise, and then they go to the cruise. Now, with Disney, of course, they've got this incredible thing. They take them to the park. Then they go on the cruise, or vice versa, and this just generates phenomenal economic activity. Back a couple years ago we passed the Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act, which is going to continue to protect the traveling public, and I really appreciate you calling the hearing and giving the cruise lines the opportunity. I'm looking forward also to the Coast Guard's presentation today. I think that will be very, very helpful. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Nelson. And Senator Lautenberg has just arrived and he is Chairman of the Subcommittee. Senator Lautenberg. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thought I'd have a more dramatic entrance than this. The Chairman. It was pretty dramatic. [Laughter.] The Chairman. Sort of threw off the rhythm of the hearing, you know. STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG, U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY Senator Lautenberg. Thanks, everybody, for being here. The industry is so important, as we've now learned, and well, we may talk about some improvements in safety and security that we'd like. When a passenger steps onto a cruise ship, their expectations--relax, enjoy time off from the pressures of everyday life. No one comes aboard expecting to enter a real live nightmare. That's what happened in January when the Costa Concordia, a 950-foot luxury liner, slammed into rocks, capsized off Italy's Tuscan coast. More than 4,000 passengers, and if this was said before please repeat it--forgive me, I think it's worth repeating--more than 4,000 passengers and crew members were aboard this ship when it crashed, killing at least 25 people, injuring more than 20 others and the survivors included a young married couple from Brick Township, New Jersey. The couple told reporters the scene was chaotic and confusing, that they received little instruction from the captain and the crew as they rushed to get life vests, endured long panic-filled waits for instructions and information and crammed onto lifeboats. In chaotic moments like this, passengers look to their ship's captain for leadership and that, as we now know, the Costa Concordia's captain abandoned ship after the crash. And I've got to be clear--crashes like this, though few and far between--are pretty significant when a tragedy of this magnitude occurs, and we've got to ask the tough questions and get honest answers. And we owe it to the public to make sure that only the safest vessels are allowed to cross our seas and that only the best qualified, best trained crew members are operating these ships. Additionally, we've got to make sure that passengers receive their own proper safety and evacuation training and we also need a better understanding of whether international standards are being followed and where improvements are needed. It's not, after all, the first time the questions have been raised about the cruise ship industry. In 2010, Congress passed cruise ship safety legislation aimed at protecting passengers from crimes on cruise ships, and this legislation recently went into effect but we still have serious concerns. For example, one of the law's key objectives is to have all serious crimes reported and posted online but there are indications that it's not happening. So I'm going to have questions, Mr. Chairman, for the witnesses about whether the public is being informed and made fully aware of the crimes, that are taking place. The bottom line is that while cruises are intended to be a time of relaxation and fun, safety can never take a vacation. I took 20 members of my family on a trip last year and it was a spectacular trip all and will be remembered for long, long years. We felt safe and comfortable and I hope that's the way all passengers will feel on cruise ships in the future and I trust that you will help us to do that. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Lautenberg, very much, not just for this but for your hard and productive work on your subcommittee. You produce a lot of good stuff. I'm going to start with the questions and we'll keep it to about 3 or 4 minutes each. Voice. Testimony. The Chairman. Yes, I do that very frequently. [Laughter.] The Chairman. It's an ego problem, I think. [Laughter.] The Chairman. But I start asking questions before I've listened to you and this is exactly the opposite of what we want to present, that we're interested, that we want to hear what you have to say and that you probably don't want to hear what I have to say. So I've been duly corrected. I apologize to all and, Admiral, you should start. STATEMENT OF VICE ADMIRAL BRIAN M. SALERNO, DEPUTY COMMANDANT FOR OPERATIONS, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY, U.S. COAST GUARD Admiral Salerno. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Rubio, distinguished members of the Committee. Thank you for this opportunity to appear before you and to discuss issues related to cruise ship safety. Thank you also, Mr. Chairman and committee, for your expression of sympathy for the tragedy the Coast Guard suffered earlier this week. We continue to search for our three missing colleagues and, as you can imagine, in a small service this is always a very painful time for us. So thank you. Every year over 170 large passenger ships operate from United States ports and they embark approximately 11.7 million passengers. The safety of these passengers and the crews which operate these vessels has been a long-standing focus of the Coast Guard. Every year, we conduct thorough examinations of these vessels to ensure that they comply with all United States and international safety, security and environmental standards. In my role as the Deputy Commandant for Operations, I'm responsible for setting the safety, security, and environmental standards for all U.S. flag vessels, commercial vessels, as well as for the foreign vessels which operate and visit our ports. I'm responsible for conducting investigations when accidents or violations of our standards occur and I'm responsible for setting policy regarding the conduct of search- and-rescue activity. For all of these reasons, the recent casualty involving the Costa Concordia is of great interest to us. We are certain that there will be much to learn from this casualty and we are open to the possibility that our regulations and the international standards produced by the International Maritime Organization may need to be strengthened based on the outcome of the investigation now being conducted by the Italian government. Accordingly, we have offered to assist in Italy's investigation as an interested party due to the significant number of American citizens who were on board, including the two who remain missing. This was a tragic accident and all of us in the Coast Guard extend our heartfelt condolences to the families and friends of the passengers who are lost and who remain missing. This year marks the 100th anniversary of the loss of the Titanic. Despite a century of technological improvements in maritime passenger safety, the Costa Concordia reminds us that our new technologies, as beneficial as they are, cannot be taken for granted, that they are only as good as the human systems that operate and maintain them and the regulatory regimes which enforce the rules. To improve passenger safety on a global scale, the Coast Guard leads the U.S. efforts at the International Maritime Organization where world maritime safety standards are set. This focus on international standards is important because, just as in the Costa Concordia case, American citizens are frequently passengers on vessels which otherwise have no U.S. connection. As the agency responsible for verifying the safety of foreign vessels in our ports, the Coast Guard has established the most rigorous port state control program in the world. All foreign flag cruise ships which embark passengers in the U.S. must undergo a controlled verification examination before they are permitted to operate. This examination is comprehensive in nature. It includes preconstruction concept reviews of the ship design. It includes examinations of the hull and tests of safety systems during construction of the ship followed by annual and periodic examinations for however long that ship is operating from a U.S. port. It is during these examinations that we also verify compliance with environmental standards and security procedures, including those procedures required under the Cruise Vessel Safety and Security Act. In 2009, the Coast Guard established a Cruise Ship National Center of Expertise. This center is the focal point for providing Coast Guard marine inspectors with the in-depth technical knowledge of cruise ship design and operations and it serves as an indicator of just how seriously we take this responsibility. One of our greatest safety challenges that we could potentially face is a mass rescue operation involving a cruise ship. While we work diligently with the cruise lines to minimize the risk of such an event ever occurring, we have also developed and we continually refine our search-and-rescue and mass rescue contingency plans. We undertake this level of emergency planning in conjunction with the cruise industry. We hold copies of cruise ship emergency plans and we periodically test them to ensure seamless coordination in the event of an actual emergency. Over the last 5 years, the Coast Guard has conducted 36 mass rescue exercises involving passenger vessels. Each Coast Guard district has specific positions identified, authorized by Congress, to focus on this responsibility. As mentioned, we do not yet have the facts in the Costa Concordia accident. However, as an immediate measure, I have directed Coast Guard field inspectors to witness passenger muster drills required by the International Safety of Life at Sea Convention whenever they are on board a ship for an annual or periodic examination. This contrasts with the international requirement for a muster drill within 24 hours of leaving port. I'm also very pleased to see that the cruise industry itself has announced new emergency drill policies requiring mandatory muster drills for embarking passengers prior to departing from port. Again, this is exceeding the international requirement. In closing, I want to assure the Committee that the Coast Guard views the safety of passengers as its highest marine safety priority. We have the best port state control program in the world for verifying the safety of vessels and for safety of passengers embarking from our ports, and through IMO we work diligently to enhance the safety of U.S. passengers regardless of where in the world they may embark a vessel. And meanwhile, we've also undertaken measures to implement the Cruise Vessel Safety and Security Act and are engaged in additional regulatory efforts to give full effect to that law and to enhance the personal protection of passengers on cruise ships. Coast Guard looks forward to working in continued cooperation with this committee, with passenger victims groups and with the industry itself to maximize cruise vessel safety, security and environmental protection. So thank you again for the opportunity to testify today and I look forward to your questions. [The prepared statement of Admiral Salerno follows:] Prepared Testimony of Vice Admiral Brian M. Salerno, Deputy Commandant for Operations, Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Coast Guard Introduction Good morning Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Hutchison, and distinguished members of the Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you to discuss issues related to cruise ship safety. In my role as the Coast Guard's Deputy Commandant for Operations, I am responsible for setting standards for safety, security, and environmental stewardship for commercial vessels, facilities and mariners, ensuring compliance with those standards, and conducting investigations of violations and accidents. I am also responsible for policy regarding the conduct of Search and Rescue (SAR). I'll touch on each of these areas in my testimony today in the context of foreign flagged cruise ships operating in U.S. waters. While it is still too early in the investigation to comment with any certainty on the cause of the tragedy involving the cruise ship Costa Concordia, or the conduct of the passengers and crew after the initial incident and during the evacuation of the vessel, as mariners and safety professionals--all of us in the U.S. Coast Guard extend our heartfelt condolences to the families and friends of the loved ones lost in this tragic event. Impetus for Safety Requirements To understand where we are today with respect to passenger vessel safety, we should look at the lessons the past has taught us. The 100th anniversary of the sinking of the RMS Titanic in April 1912 is only weeks away. The Titanic tragedy prompted overwhelming international response which resulted in the first Safety of Life at Sea Convention, also known as SOLAS 1914. This first version focused on lifeboats, emergency equipment, and radio watches. Improvements to the Convention made in 1929, 1948, and 1960 added requirements for subdivision, stability, machinery, firefighting, lifesaving, communications, and navigation systems. SOLAS is the key international maritime agreement focused on safety. For the most part, large passenger vessels visiting the United States before the 1960s were in liner service, with the primary purpose of transporting passengers from one part of the world to another. With the advent of commercial airlines, the international passenger vessel industry evolved from transportation to entertainment, and liners became cruise ships. In the 1960s, a number of serious cruise ship fires, involving heavy loss of life, brought the issue of cruise ship safety to the attention of maritime authorities worldwide. These fires involved the older passenger ships Lakonia, Yarmouth Castle, and Viking Princess, which had superstructures that contained some combustible materials, allowing the rapid spread of flames and total destruction of passenger spaces. In May 1966, the Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) of the Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organization (IMCO), now called the International Maritime Organization (IMO), met to consider measures to improve the fire safety of passenger vessels. The committee first directed its attention to the problem of fire safety in older passenger vessels and crafted the 1966 amendments to SOLAS 60, which included additional fire protection standards for existing passenger vessels. Congress showed great interest in this work, especially since the Coast Guard had conducted a Marine Board of Investigation into the 1965 Yarmouth Castle fire. On November 2, 1968, Public Law 89-777 (R.S. 4400(c); 46 U.S.C. 362(c)), Fire Safety Standards for Foreign and Domestic Passenger Vessels, came into effect, which required the Coast Guard to verify that foreign cruise vessels complied with the 1966 fire safety amendments. In 1968, the United States unilaterally required all passenger vessels with overnight accommodations for 50 or more passengers to meet the 1966 fire safety amendments or U.S. passenger vessel requirements. The Coast Guard promulgated Navigation and Vessel Inspection Circular 2-68, which provided implementing guidance on how to conduct a control verification examination on foreign flag cruise ships, specifying that ``this verification may necessitate a degree of plan review, removal of panels, ceilings, etc., in addition to the testing of construction materials.'' On August 26, 1983, Public Law 98-89 provided additional authority for the Coast Guard to verify that foreign flag cruise ships embarking passengers in U.S. ports comply with SOLAS convention requirements. The Coast Guard made improvements to its vessel examination program in 1985 and 1993, which further expanded examination requirements and provided much more detailed guidelines for control verification examination procedures on foreign cruise ships. Since 1993, cruise ship designs have continued to evolve, growing in size and complexity with the capability of carrying thousands of passengers and crew, and the Coast Guard has frequently updated guidance for plan review and control verification examinations necessary for foreign cruise ships operating out of U.S. ports. Last year, there were 143 cruise ships, sailing under foreign registry, that operated out of U.S. ports and carried over eleven million passengers. Modern Standards for Cruise Ships Over the past decade, the international shipping community, through the IMO and with Coast Guard leadership, has moved decisively toward a proactive approach to passenger ship safety. With cruise ships growing progressively in size and capacity, in May 2000, the IMO agreed to undertake a holistic examination of safety issues pertaining to passenger ships, with particular emphasis on large cruise ships. The outcome of this proactive initiative is an entirely new prevention and survivability based regulatory philosophy for the design, construction, and operation of cruise ships. The U.S., through the efforts of the Coast Guard, has taken a very active leadership role throughout this initiative, putting forward many of the recommendations for action taken by the various IMO Sub- Committees. The effort identified a number of areas of concern related to cruise ships, and resulted in substantial amendments to major IMO conventions, including SOLAS, International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution From Ships (MARPOL) 73/78, International Tonnage, Standards for Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping (STCW) and Load Line conventions. These conventions provide internationally accepted standards for the design, construction, outfitting, and operation of ships. They address surveys, structures, stability, machinery, fire safety, lifesaving equipment, communications, navigation equipment, safety management, maritime security, pollution prevention, crew competency, watertight integrity, and safe loading. Significant improvements under the five main pillars of the initiative entered into force in July 2010: Prevention: Amendments to the STCW Code and supporting guidelines focus on navigation safety and resource management; Improved survivability: New SOLAS requirements for the ``safe return to port'' concept address essential system redundancy, management of emergencies, and casualty mitigation, including the new concept of dedicated shipboard safety centers to manage emergencies; Regulatory flexibility: Amendments to SOLAS provide a methodology for the approval of new and innovative safety technologies and arrangements; Operations in areas remote from SAR facilities: Guidelines on external support from SAR authorities, as well as guidance to assist seafarers taking part in SAR operations have been developed; and finally Health safety and medical care: Guidelines on establishing medical safety programs, and a revised Guide on Cold Water Survival. Other recent improvements include stability and survivability of cruise ships through new probabilistic subdivision and damage stability regulations, and flooding detection systems; improved voyage planning, particularly in remote and high latitude areas; and voyage data recorders. As a separate initiative, stemming from the 2006 fire aboard the Star Princess, significant improvements have been made to the fire safety features of external areas on cruise ships. Overall, the past decade has been an enormous leap forward in cruise ship safety measures and has been largely proactive as opposed to reactive to casualties as has generally been the case in the past. Coast Guard's leadership in the international community with respect to cruise ship safety measures and our support to foreign casualty investigations evidences our dedication to U.S. passenger safety whereever our citizens embark on cruise ships. The Safety, Security, and Environmental Protection Net The IMO conventions form the bases for the international safety, security, and stewardship net designed to ensure consistent standards across the worldwide fleet of cruise ships. The owners and operators, flag states and port states each have distinct roles in ensuring compliance with those standards. Flag states have the primary responsibility to ensure vessels of their flag meet international and domestic standards. They often achieve this through recognized third party organizations who certify that vessels meet design, construction, operating, and manning requirements throughout the life of the vessel. Port states verify substantial compliance with international standards and ensuring compliance with applicable domestic requirements for vessels of all flags calling in their ports. As the port state authority for the U.S., the Coast Guard has established a robust control verification program that subjects cruise ships calling in U.S. ports to a much higher level of scrutiny than other foreign flag vessels, and much higher than any other port states require for foreign flag cruise ships in their ports. Coast Guard Control Verification Program for Foreign Flag Cruise Ships The Coast Guard has a very robust port state control program for cruise ships. All foreign flag cruise ships arriving in the United States that embark passengers or make a U.S. port call while carrying U.S. citizens as passengers must participate in the control verification process. Cruise ships that return to U.S. service after a prolonged absence are treated as if they had never been in service in the U.S. and must undergo the entire process again. The Coast Guard control verification program includes initial, annual, and periodic examinations for foreign flag cruise ships calling in our ports. It includes concept review during the very earliest stages of design, pre-construction plan review by Coast Guard naval architects and fire protection engineers, mid-construction inspections at the builder's yard by Coast Guard marine inspectors, an initial operational inspection of the vessel upon completion of construction, and at least annual inspections while the vessel is in service in U.S. ports. This regime allows the Coast Guard to determine that the vessel is in substantial compliance with all applicable international and domestic standards. The engineering review of plans for structural fire protection arrangements provides a great level of assurance that shipboard fire safety arrangements meet international standards. After review, these same engineers visit the ship and confirm that the actual arrangements on the vessel are the same as those shown on the structural fire protection plans. No other port state provides this level of attention to detail for cruise ships. On the basis of this initial examination, the Coast Guard issues a certificate of compliance that allows the vessel to operate in U.S. ports. The annual examination ensures that foreign cruise ships continue to maintain all the systems the Coast Guard previously examined during the initial exam in proper operating condition and that the flag administration has performed annual renewal surveys as required by SOLAS. Inspectors focus on firefighting, lifesaving, and emergency systems and witness a comprehensive fire and boat drill by the crew. In addition, inspectors examine the vessel for modifications that would affect the vessel's structural fire protection and means of escape. They also check for modifications completed without the vessel's flag administration approval. After a satisfactory annual examination, the Coast Guard re-issues a certificate of compliance. Periodic examinations are also conducted, typically midway between the annual examinations. These examinations are limited in scope and build on the more comprehensive annuals, and they are intended to ensure vessels are being operated in a safe manner. The periodic examinations focus on the performance of officers and crew, with specific attention paid to their training on and knowledge of the ship's emergency procedures, firefighting, lifesaving systems, and performance during the drills. To ensure the overall material condition of the ship has not appreciably changed since the annual examination, inspectors randomly select sample items for examination. Inspectors also vary the scope of the examination depending upon the material condition of the vessel, the maintenance of the vessel, and the professionalism and training of the crew. At every Coast Guard examination of a foreign cruise ship, the inspectors will determine whether the vessel is in substantial compliance with the international convention standards. As a result of the Costa Concordia incident, I have directed Coast Guard field inspectors to witness the passenger muster required by SOLAS whenever they are onboard a cruise ship conducting an initial, annual, or periodic examination. Our personnel will witness these musters either immediately before or during vessel departure from port. I am pleased to see that the cruise industry associations announced a new emergency drill policy requiring mandatory muster for embarking passengers prior to departure from port. Investigations Foreign vessels operating in U.S. waters are required by U.S. law to report accidents immediately. Upon accident notification, we proactivly investigate to determine causes and issue safety recommendations to prevent recurrences. It is a continuous improvement process which incorporates lessons learned from accident investigations to enhance cruise ship safety and ensure compliance with national and international laws. After the Costa Concordia incident, the Coast Guard immediately offered technical expertise and support to the Government of Italy's marine casualty investigation. The Coast Guard's expertise in marine casualty investigations will prove helpful as we move forward with the investigation. Currently, Coast Guard teams are conducting interviews with the U.S. passengers to ascertain the vessel's crew level of preparedness and response. Information gained from the Costa Concordia investigation may assist in identifying marine casualty causal factors that could have broad application. It is long standing practice to cooperate in all manner of accident investigations involving different flag and coastal states and the Coast Guard routinely acts in this accord. Search and Rescue (SAR) and Mass Rescue Operations (MRO) The Coast Guard has maintained a good relationship with the cruise lines regarding search and rescue and medical evacuations. For the Coast Guard, a Mass Rescue Operation involving a cruise ship casualty offshore, with potentially thousands of passengers and crew forced to evacuate into lifeboats and the water, presents our greatest search and rescue challenge. Working with cruise line and passenger vessel companies, the Coast Guard continues to develop and improve SAR and MRO contingency plans. In addition to internal Coast Guard SAR plans, the Coast Guard holds a copy of cruise ship SAR plans and is able to incorporate the cruise ship plans into our overall SAR planning in the event of an emergency. The Coast Guard also meets periodically with cruise line medical personnel to discuss plans for medical emergencies, which pays dividends during actual medical evacuations. For example, many of the 857 medical evacuations performed by the Coast Guard last year, were conducted from cruise ships. evacuations last year. In addition to working directly with cruise lines, Coast Guard has been working in partnership with the passenger vessel industry associations, including Cruise Lines International Association and the Passenger Vessel Association. Coast Guard works with the associations to develop, coordinate and represent Coast Guard policies and positions related to passenger vessel mass rescue plans, coordination, and exercises. Recently, Coast Guard led a Department of Homeland Security sponsored interagency table top exercise for Federal agency representatives involving a cruise ship emergency in the Arctic. Mass rescue planning involves support from many of our Federal agency and State partners. In 2002, Congress appropriated funding for 22 permanent billets for the Coast Guard's Passenger Vessel Safety Specialist/Mass Rescue Operation Program. These billets provide the Coast Guard with increased capacity and capability to help coordinate and promote passenger vessel prevention plans, manage risk and maintain a state of readiness in response to the impressive growth in foreign and domestic passenger vessels over the past decade. Planning for a mass evacuation of a cruise ship carrying thousands of passengers and crew involves intense preparation and extensive coordination to meet the varying types of emergencies that could arise. Coast Guard passenger vessel safety personnel at each of our Districts assist in the conduct and coordination of Coast Guard mass rescue exercises. Over the last 5 years, the Coast Guard conducted thirty-six mass rescue exercises involving passenger vessels, three of which involved a cruise ship. The Coast Guard has an agreement with CLIA to include an actual cruise ship as part of these exercises every 2 years. Since 2007, CLIA has fulfilled this partnership agreement by providing a cruise ship every other year for a full scale exercise. The purpose of these exercises is to assist the Coast Guard, other Federal, state and local search and rescue authorities and cruise ship industry partners in exercising mass rescue plans, practice interagency/industry cooperation and coordination and identify ways to improve the overall response to a major maritime disaster. Mass rescue exercises have been structured around a 5-year cycle. In 2010, the Coast Guard directed that, at a minimum, each Coast Guard District conduct and/or participate in one discussion based (e.g., seminar, workshop, game, or tabletop) and one operations based (e.g., drills, functional, full scale) mass rescue exercise over a 5-year period. To meet this exercise requirement, beginning this year, the Coast Guard has planned a 5-year mass rescue exercise series known as ``Black Swan.'' The exercise series will begin this year with a cruise ship seminar in New Orleans, followed by a functional drill in 2013, also in New Orleans, and full scale mass rescue exercises in Miami in 2015 and Norfolk in 2017. The scope of these exercises provide a valuable opportunity to identify and resolve the difficulties associated with rescuing hundreds or thousands of people at once. It is also a chance to address the unique challenges posed by off shore mass rescues. The Black Swan mass rescue exercise series will focus on the exercise of Coast Guard mass rescue plans, coordination with other authorities and industry partners, notification and information processes, personnel accountability, embarking thousands of survivors on rescue ships from the water, lifeboats and rafts, and rescued passenger and crew support. Cruise Ship Security and Crime September 11, 2001 spurred the development of the Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA) and the IMO International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code, both of which are rigorously enforced by the Coast Guard. Prior to the MTSA and ISPS, only the cruise ships that visited the U.S. and cruise terminals were required to have security plans in place. The requirement for cruise ship and facility security plans in the United States had come into effect as a result of the 1985 Achille Lauro terrorist incident in the Mediterranean Sea, resulting in the murder of Leon Klinghoffer--a wheel-chair bound U.S. citizen. The Coast Guard examines every cruise ship that visits the U.S. for compliance with MTSA and ISPS requirements at the same time it carries out annual and periodic examinations. Overall, cruise ship compliance records have been extremely good, with only three security-related detentions in approximately 1,800 security examinations since July 2004. Notwithstanding this security compliance regime, there have been serious incidents and crimes that have affected U.S. citizens aboard foreign-flagged cruise ships, however, this has led to an increased focus on protecting our citizens both in port and while they are at sea. In 2010, Congress bolstered passenger safety and security with respect to such incidents and crimes by enacting the Cruise Ship Security and Safety Act of 2010 (CVSSA). Since then, the Coast Guard has worked diligently to implement the provisions of this act. The CVSSA prescribes security and safety requirements for designated cruise ships and is the authority for a rulemaking now under development by the Coast Guard. CVSSA amended Title 46, United States Code, by adding passenger vessel security and safety requirements, and crime scene preservation training requirements for passenger vessel crewmembers. CVSSA addresses many areas that affect personal safety and security, including: ship design; better public access to information about crime aboard cruise ships; improved precautions, response, medical care, support for victims of sexual assault; preservation of evidence necessary to prosecute criminals; and more consistent and complete reports about criminal activities. A large number of these requirements went into effect when the President signed the legislation on July 27, 2010; however, there are areas that require implementation through the publication of regulations. Thus far, the Coast Guard has completed the following actions with respect to implementing the CVSSA: In June 2011, the Coast Guard published policy establishing guidelines for Coast Guard Marine Inspectors examining cruise vessels for compliance to include physical requirements, such as: rail heights; door peep-holes as one commonly sees on hotel doors, which allow cabin occupants to see who is outside before opening their cabin door; and the passenger security guide. The Coast Guard established an Internet-based portal ([email protected]) to facilitate electronic submission of crime reports. The Coast Guard established a web link to publish cruise ship sexual assault and criminal activity data received from the the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in accordance with the act: http://www.uscg.mil/hq/cg2/cgis/. An Inter-agency workgroup consisting of Coast Guard, FBI, and the Maritime Administration personnel completed development of a model course addressing crime scene preservation standards and curricula. In July 2011, the Coast Guard published policy promulgating training standards and curricula for the certification of passenger vessel security personnel. Closing As I close, let me emphasize that the Coast Guard places the highest priority on vessels that embark passengers in the United States; and embark U.S. passengers worldwide. We have a strong and effective port state control program for foreign cruise ships and ensure that vessels that visit the United States are in substantial compliance with applicable international and domestic standards. We participate in casualty investigations, even those taking place overseas, and we lead efforts at IMO to improve maritime safety, security, and environmental protection standards. Furthermore, we have one of the best Search and Rescue programs in the world and we work closely with the industry on SAR planning and medical evacuations. We have efforts underway to plan for mass rescue operations. We are taking measures to implement the CVSSA. We have accomplished much, but additional work must take place. As a result of the Costa Concordia incident, we have also put into place a regime to witness passenger musters as part of our mandatory vessel examination program. As the investigation unfolds, the Coast Guard will capture lessons learned and incorporate them into our safety regime. The Coast Guard also looks forward to continued cooperation with this committee, passenger victims groups, and the passenger vessel industry to maximize cruise vessel safety, security, and environmental protection. Although we are not asking for, or recommending to Congress, new legislation at this time, we may do so in the future once we have had the opportunity to review the Costa Concordia investigation. Thank you again for the opportunity to testify today. I will be pleased to answer any questions you may have. The Chairman. Thank you, Admiral. And we call now on Bill Johnson, Seaport Director, Port of Miami. STATEMENT OF BILL JOHNSON, DIRECTOR, PortMiami, MIAMI-DADE COUNTY Mr. Johnson. Good morning. Chairman Rockefeller and honorable members of the Committee, first, I want to thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today. I am especially pleased to be invited to appear before our two great senators from the state of Florida, Senator Bill Nelson and Senator Marco Rubio. Both our senators, as they've stated, are keenly aware of the importance of the cruise industry to the state of Florida. My name is Bill Johnson and I'm the Director of the Dante Fascell Port of Miami, now known as PortMiami. I also serve as the Chairman of the Florida Ports Council, which has responsibility for coordination with Florida's--all of Florida's 15 deepwater ports. I also have the privilege of serving as the third Vice President of the International Association of Ports and Harbors where we work on issues of national and global concern including issues pertaining to the cruise industry. Believe me, I cannot emphasize enough that safety is the cruise industry's number one priority. I underscore that. Safety and security is also my highest priority as the director of the world's busiest cruise port. As a way of some quick background, the Port of Miami, PortMiami, we're a small little port. We're about 518 acres located right in the beautiful part of downtown on Biscayne Bay between the City of Miami and the City of Miami Beach. Our port is governed by our county mayor, Carlos Gimenez, and our Board of County Commissioners serve as our board of directors. We're a public port but we operate with a private sector mentality. Last year, PortMiami generated over $18 billion, direct and indirect, to the economy of our community, our state and our nation, and we generated in excess of 180,000 jobs in south Florida, in our state, and these are, I would like to add, are high-paying jobs. The average job through the Port of Miami with a high school education is approaching $56,000 a year. So the maritime industry and, specifically, cargo and crews, are very high paying important jobs. As stated, PortMiami is the world's busiest cruise port. We've just completed our fourth consecutive year exceeding 4 million passengers. In addition, our community, Miami-Dade County, is the global headquarters of five of the world's largest distinguished cruise lines including Carnival Cruise Line and its parent, Carnival Corporation, Royal Caribbean Cruise Limited, Norwegian Cruise Lines, Oceania, Regent. The importance of having these global headquarters in Florida but, most importantly, in America I cannot stress enough, and I'm sure we'll come back to that issue in a few minutes. PortMiami, again, and its cruising really is the bread and butter of the economy of my town and a strong piece of the economy of my state. While there are 15 deepwater ports in Florida, five of those ports, as indicated I think by Senator Nelson, five of those ports have a heavy emphasis on cruise and cruise-related business. During the recent several years in the downturn of our economy, the cruise business in America and in Florida remained a strong and a continued, if you will, strong presence to the economy, protecting local and state jobs and companies in a significant way. I'd like to present, if I would, just a few statistics. In 2011, over 13 million overnight visitors came to Miami --13 million. The number is growing. In the state of Florida, it was over 82 million visitors, in 2011. In Miami, those visitors spent over $20 billion last year. They stayed an average of almost six nights, those visitors. And of this number, over 7 percent were cruise passengers. These visitors spent an average of roughly $265 a day while in our community and they stay--this is important--an average of 2.4 nights per cruise. That is the single--the cruise industry is the single largest contributor to overnight stays, to occupancy of hotels, in our community. When you examine how they spend their money, these cruise passengers spend approximately 35 percent for lodging in our motels and hotels, nearly 26 percent for food, for meals, 15 percent for entertainment, unfortunately only 10 percent for shopping. We'd like that to be higher. Of course, this is just the tip of the iceberg. Of the more than 4 million passengers last year and, literally, within the next 2 years will be at 4.5 million passengers and by the end of the decade we're projected to be over 5 million cruise passengers at Miami, but of those 4 million cruise passengers who visited PortMiami last year, 60 percent--this is very important--60 percent passed through my sister agency, Miami International Airport, the second largest international gateway into America, obviously infusing millions, untold millions of additional revenues to the U.S. economy through airlines, OK, and million more, if you will, in terms of passenger fees, meals, sales tax, et cetera, et cetera. PortMiami, obviously, is a critical job creator--a job incubator, if you will, for our state, again, generating over 180,000 jobs just in Miami alone, direct indirect. This number will continue to increase. Three new lines, including Disney, have announced that they're going to call Miami as a home port--three new brands. We're clearly excited. Also, the maritime industry workers, as I've told you, are some of the highest paid in our state and in my community, averaging close to $56,000 a year. I'd like to say that, of course, these workers, some of these are, again, both in public and private sector employment. We have over 1,200 International Longshoremen alone at the Port of Miami. In Florida as you've heard over $6 billion a year goes to cruise industry service and these are providers, This is another benefit, the provisioning of these cruise ships. Royal Caribbean--and one of the senators made this point, a very strong point, RoyalCaribbean alone uses more than 2,000 suppliers. These are American companies. Two thousand suppliers. Three hundred and fifty--in my community, 350 are located in Miami. They spend over $400 million in my town, Royal Caribbean alone, on shipboard products. Carnival Cruise Line has a fleet of 20, just the line--Carnival Cruise Line has a fleet of 23 ships. On average, they serve eight meals and snacks a day to between 2,000 and 3,000 guests, to a crew of between 1,000 and 1,500 daily. When you look at that, as the point was made, they're serving--it's like a floating city. There's as many people and staff on these ships consuming product. It's huge for the American economy. The Chairman. Mr. Johnson? Very respectfully---- Mr. Johnson. Yes? The Chairman. If you could kind of begin to---- Mr. Johnson. Sure. The Chairman. OK. Mr. Johnson. Moving in the direction in terms of provisioning, the point I'm trying to make is it's not just the cruise passenger. It's the related industries that impact the, if you will, the economy of our state, our nation. And we see the opportunity for this to increase even more significantly as the cruise industry continues to flourish. The comment I'd like to make is that I interact with these cruise executives--fortunately, they're headquartered in my town--from the CEOs and the presidents of these cruise lines all the way down. We are on a weekly basis working with our cruise partners, working--and it's incredible support we receive from the U.S. Coast Guard. I cannot say enough about the importance of the Coast Guard, their role, the importance of U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the safety and security of our ports. I can assure you--I can testify about the commitment not just of your ports but of the leadership of these cruise lines and these executives to safety and to environment, and during the question and answer I'd be happy to get into some of the responses on both of those issues from the PortMiami perspective. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Mr. Johnson follows:] Prepared Statement of Bill Johnson, Director, PortMiami, Miami-Dade County Chairman Rockefeller, Ranking Member Hutchison, and honorable members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today. I am especially pleased to be invited to appear before our two great senators from the State of Florida, Senator Bill Nelson and Senator Marco Rubio, who are keenly aware of the importance the cruise industry brings to the Sunshine State. My name is Bill Johnson, and I am the Director of the Dante B. Fascell Port of Miami, now known as PortMiami. I also serve as the Chairman of the Florida Ports Council and serve as the Vice President of the International Association of Ports and Harbors where we work together on issues of national and international concern. Believe me, and I cannot emphasize this enough, safety is the cruise industry's top priority. Background The Miami-Dade County Seaport Department, PortMiami, is a 518-acre facility located in mid-Biscayne Bay between the City of Miami and Miami Beach. PortMiami is governed by Mayor Carlos Gimenez and the Miami-Dade County Board of County Commissioners under a strong mayor form of government. PortMiami is the busiest cruise port in the world, handling more than 4 million passengers in 2011 for the 4th consecutive year in a row. In addition, Miami-Dade County is the global headquarters for five of the world's largest and most distinguished cruise lines: Carnival Cruise Lines, Norwegian Cruise Line, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises. Thus, at PortMiami, cruising is our bread and butter and lifeblood of the local economy. During the recent downturn in the economy, the cruise business in Florida remained strong and at present continues to grow, protecting our local and state economy from an even larger economic disruption. Economic Impact With your indulgence, I would like to present the following numbers--in 2011 Greater Miami had over 13.4 million overnight visitors who spent $20 billion dollars and stayed an average of 5.8 nights. Of those visitors, 7.1 percent or 951,400 were cruise passengers. These visitors spent an average of $264.58 per day and stayed an average of 2.4 nights. When examining how their money was spent, it breaks down as: 35 percent for lodging, 25.6 percent for meals, 15.2 percent for entertainment, 10.2 percent for shopping, 7.5 percent for local transportation; and 6.3 percent for parking. But that is only the tip of the iceberg. Of the more than 4 million cruise passengers who visited PortMiami last year, over 60 percent of them passed through our sister department, Miami International Airport, infusing millions of additional revenue to U.S. airlines and millions more into the state and local economy via items such as passenger fees, meals, and sales taxes. PortMiami is a critical jobs incubator for the state, supporting over 180,000 jobs, and that number will increase with three new cruise brands coming to our port over the next 22 months. Also, maritime industry workers at the port have one of the highest incomes in the County. For persons with a high school degree, salaries average around $52,000 per year, a good salary for South Florida. Jobs created by the port are in both the public and private sectors, including over 1,200 members of the International Longshoremen's Association. In Florida, over $6 billion a year goes to cruise industry service providers, suppliers and vendors according to an economic impact study commissioned by the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA). Royal Caribbean alone uses more than 2,000 suppliers, 350 of which are local to South Florida and spends more than $400 million annually in South Florida on shipboard products ranging from fuel, food and drinks, to furniture. Carnival Cruise Lines, PortMiami's largest cruise tenant, has a global fleet of 23 ships, where 8 meals and snacks are served every day to 2,000-3,000 guests per ship (along with 1,000-1,500 crew members). Celebrity Cruises' Constellation, at full capacity, feeds 3 meals a day to over 2,000 passengers and more than 1,000 officers and crew, comparable to the provisions that any small town might consume in 1 week. Provisioning of ships gets real money flowing into the economy--helping small and medium sized businesses not only survive, but thrive. Ship Chandlers range in size and product specialization, and include nationally recognizable names like Coca-Cola and Cargill, to local and state businesses such as the American Fruit and Produce Corp., and Sysco. American Fruit and Produce, a fruit and vegetable supplier based in Miami-Dade County has 125 employees and over 45 years experience working with the cruise industry. With annual revenues of over $100 million, they get 30-40 percent of their business from the cruise industry, supplying lines such as Norwegian, Carnival and Royal Caribbean throughout Florida, in New Orleans and along the Gulf Coast. These suppliers support local jobs throughout the South, jobs that would disappear if we did not have a robust cruise industry. Although standard fare such as bananas and tomatoes are still in high demand, more and more ships are changing menus to include organic and specialty foods, providing additional new business opportunities for U.S. farmers. Every cruise ship leaving from PortMiami has a multiplier effect that also includes 486 companies providing ground transportation, including bus and limousine services, and thousands of taxi trips between Miami International Airport, local hotels, and PortMiami on a typical cruise weekend. The cruise industry also supports jobs ranging from companies involved in refueling ships, harbor pilots guiding ships into the harbor, tugboat operators, waste removal, and landscaping, as well as terminal security services. In Florida as a whole, these numbers expand exponentially. Florida is the number one cruise state in the nation, and according to CLIA, the industry accounted for $6.3 billion in direct spending in 2010, generating 123,255 jobs and wages totaling $5.4 billion. Florida's five cruise ports handled 5.8 million embarkations, which accounted for nearly 60 percent of all U.S. cruise embarkations. The jobs are not just on-port, they include travel and transportation services, hotel and hospitality services, food provisioning, ship repair services, advertising agencies, engineering companies, manufacturers of machinery and metal, interior designers, and computer consultants, just to name a few. Safety and Security Safety and security must always be our top priority. While serving as director, I have focused on enhancement of our public safety and security protocols. I am pleased that our Port is a leader in the state and nation regarding security. Ensuring our passengers safety is the number one concern at PortMiami. In addition to the separate private security hired by cruise lines, we are close partners with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the U.S. Coast Guard, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, Miami-Dade Police Department and Miami-Dade Fire- Rescue. We take the threat of terrorism seriously, as well as preventing crime on port and providing a safe and secure environment for passengers, workers and visitors alike. We conduct regular training drills with our Federal, state and local partners to ensure readiness for any emergency, be it natural like a hurricane, or man-made. We also work closely with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Department and the U.S. Department of Agriculture as well as the Florida Department of Agriculture to protect against entry of insects or disease that could harm U.S. interests. For example, PortMiami has initiated a ``Don't Pack a Bug'' program with the USDA to protect U.S. farms and produce. In another innovative program, we have also partnered with a group called Kristi House in Miami, implementing a plan to train the personnel at the seaport to identify and respond to children in transit who may be victims of human trafficking and/or sexual exploitation. In addition, the plan includes partnering with the cruise lines and private security companies to facilitate the training of their personnel as well. The Port is compliant with all International Maritime Organization standards that govern the operations of cruise vessels. Our lines follow the safety standards of the Convention on the Standards of Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping which deals with crew training regarding safety procedures. Our close cooperation with the U.S. Coast Guard assures passenger safety with the examination of each new cruise vessel when it first enters service at a U.S. port, three of which will be coming to PortMiami in the coming year. There are also thorough Coast Guard examinations of cruise ships when ships reposition from foreign to U.S. ports, as well as mandatory quarterly inspections. These inspections emphasize structural fire safety and the proper life saving equipment along with being present for fire and abandoned ship drills. I applaud Congress for passing the Cruise Vessel Security and Safely Act of 2010 in furtherance of efforts to carry out the upmost passenger safety, including updating ships safety, the installation of ship rails, visual identification means on entry doors, integration of technology used to detect any passengers fallen overboard, and the new protocols regarding reporting crimes aboard. Environmental PortMiami continues to be at the forefront in environmental responsibility. Our well-thought-out vision embraces public and private input and is consistent with the objectives of County government and maritime industry needs. Our Port is surrounded by a unique and fragile, maritime ecosystem which ranges from sea grass beds to natural coral reefs. These waters provide our community with the strong tourism base that South Florida thrives on, including the cruise industry. The Port has taken steps to ensure that the value of commerce in our community is supported by an aggressive and proactive environmental program. Just last year, the Port completed over 40 acres of mangrove restoration at Oleta River State Park in Northern Biscayne Bay. We have also installed storm water treatment systems to improve water quality of the Bay. To conserve energy, PortMiami has implemented a series of on-going projects to reduce energy consumption onsite, including the installation of `variable frequency drives' on the air handlers in older facilities, retrofitting all lamps from watt reduction throughout the Port, along with installing computerized panels for controlling the lights in cruise terminals. To reduce our carbon footprint, we have replaced cars with hybrids and provided for the separation of cargo and cruise traffic to decrease idling time and reduce emissions. We also incorporate green performance standards in our Cruise Capital Improvement Program, with our most recent renovations using furniture manufactured with products using renewable and recycled materials and canopies utilizing a fabric that is 100 percent recyclable. All re-roofing projects have reflective roof measures, such as reflective coating and membranes with a solar reflectance that keep terminals cooler, even in our tropical climate. Our vision is to continue a tradition of leadership concerning environmental issues and to practice sustainable green development. By carefully balancing environmental, social and economic factors into our business planning and decisionmaking processes, we will ensure a favorable workplace today and a healthy environment tomorrow. Conclusion PortMiami is where the modern cruise industry was born starting in 1972, when cruise shipping pioneer Ted Arison acquired his first passenger ship and founded what has become the highly successful business called Carnival Cruise Lines. We look forward to continuing the growth of the cruise industry in Miami, and welcome new innovations and best practices with gusto. The safety and security of our passengers is priority number one. I would like to thank you for allowing me to speak today and welcome input regarding this most important of industries. The Chairman. Thank you very much, Mr. Johnson. Now, Captain William H. Doherty is the Director of Maritime Relations, NEXUS Consulting Group. STATEMENT OF CAPTAIN WILLIAM H. DOHERTY, DIRECTOR OF MARITIME RELATIONS, NEXUS CONSULTING CORPORATION Captain Doherty. Good morning, Chairman, Senators. Thank you for having me here today to review the issue of cruise line safety. From my background, I'm a proud graduate of Massachusetts Maritime Academy. I hold two degrees from that institution. I'm a master mariner in the United States Merchant Marine and a retired commander in the U.S. Navy. I served 49 years in this industry including safety manager for one of America's largest cruise lines just prior to retirement. As my submitted testimony notes, there's a number of issues where the international cruise industry has fallen short of its responsibility to maintain safety and security of the passengers and crew. In recent days, it's become glaringly obvious that there are some serious issues within the cruise industry pertaining to operating safety and security which need to be resolved. Just 2 months into 2012, we've already seen at least 34 deaths--one on the Liberty of Sea, one on Carnival Fantasy and at least 32 on Costa Concordia. We've also seen two sinkings-- the Rabaul Queen off of Papua, New Guinea, and the Costa Concordia in Italy. We've seen hundreds of pounds of illegal drugs seized on three cruise ships; most recently, yet another cruise ship losing power in the middle of pirate-infested waters due to reported engine room fire. That ship left passengers in peril on the sea in a terrible place. These are only the few known reported incidents on cruise ships in 2012. However, what we can reliably assume from these reports coming to light only after the Costa Concordia is that there is every reason to believe that many more incidents have gone either unreported or grossly underreported, making it almost impossible to validate incident data and draw an actual picture of the state of affairs regarding security and safety on today's cruise ships. There's no one specific enforcement agency or mechanism which regulates or enforces the Law of the Sea in this international fleet. The maritime domain is regulated by the International Maritime Organization. More particularly, with respect to safety, the framework of operational management safety and environmental protection is covered through IMO- mandated International Safety Management, or ISM, standards. These mirror the ISO, or International Standards Organizations, ashore. That's to say that an industry as a whole is expected to establish its own standards. It's regulated by how closely they meet those standards. Again, to paraphrase would be say what you're going to do, do what you say. The regulators of these standards are usually in administration of the country where the ship is registered, otherwise known as the flag state, under the IMO worldwide. Unfortunately, quite often the country for which the ship is registered, or the flag state, outsources its authority to contracted agencies, or classification societies. That was the case in the Costa Concordia where Italy outsourced its country's compliance program to the private entity RINA, and they are a private entity. Sadly, these weak checks and balances have led to a sort of the fox guarding the henhouse model of governance, you know, at the expense of passengers, crew and the environment and the maritime domain as a whole. What I have called for is a greater focus to be lent in three areas--obviously, passenger safety; second, strict shipboard compliance and flag state industry oversight, and you'll see in my testimony how I've outlined some of those. I've noted various specific areas of improvement and change which include, for one, zero tolerance with respect to drugs and alcohol for everyone, all crew on passenger ships. We also recommend a passenger-initiated distress system and we strongly recommend worldwide contingency planning, funding an organization for future mega cruise ship disasters. Cruise ship operators and owners must fully comply not only with the letter but the spirit of the IMO standards of training, certification and watch standing, otherwise known as STCW, specifically, the requirements of Bridge Resource Management, or BRM, to prevent navigational disasters. While none of us could have ever envisioned the specific events leading up to the loss of the Concordia and, tragically, 32 lives, there was a clear indication that the root cause of the grounding was a fatal failure on behalf of the captain and his senior officers to follow and comply with the procedures of Bridge Resource Management. We don't need to reinvent the wheel to bring these necessary changes and improvements to maritime safety around. You know, we've got the framework already in place with the Cruise Ship Security Act and Safety Act of 2010. This is good legislation but it lacks strict criminal penalties and addresses more individual crimes against cruise vessel passengers and as yet does not address strong penalties or criminal sentencing for reckless abandonment. We have to decentralize the manner in which emergencies are reported. The Costa Concordia only lost 34 lives because a few passengers and crew members were able to call loved ones and report the distress. Mind you, a ship member needed to phone out to report the distress, clearly afraid of reporting it, clear afraid that it wasn't reported by his own ship and that the signal would go unheeded. If the survivors weren't lucky enough to be within cell range, who knows how much larger the death count would have been? The Office of the Costa Concordia was still only reporting to the Italian authorities that they had a power outage, not that they had run aground within the first few calls from the Coast Guard to the ship. That totally should have been the other way around. We're calling for legislation to mandate passenger distress signals. This would empower passengers to alert the outside rescue authorities if they feel their lives are in danger and they're not sure proper distress messages were sent, for whatever reason, by the ship personnel. Passengers able to initiate distress signals. Thank you, Senators, for your time. I'd be happy to answer any questions with this or my written testimony.
