        "text": "St Vincent de Paul Orphanage was established by the Catholic Church in 1866 in Gilberton. In 1867 it took in Catholic children from the Grace Darling Hotel. The Orphanage moved to Adelaide in 1868, to Mitcham in 1872, Burnside in 1875 and Millswood in 1888. The Orphanage was run by the Orphanage Board from 1866 to 1872, The Sisters of St Joseph, 1872 to 1889 and the Sisters of Mercy, 1889 to 1975. Between 1949 and 1957, 54 migrant girls were brought to the Orphanage from England and Malta. The St Vincent de Paul Orphanage closed in 1975 and was replaced by a number of cottage homes known as the St Vincent Group Homes.\n\nThe St Vincent de Paul Orphanage was first established by the Catholic Church in 1866. In the mid 1800s some members of the Catholic Church became concerned that orphans of the faith under government care were often placed with non-Catholic families. They believed that these children's spiritual welfare needed to be protected through the establishment of a Catholic orphanage. The orphanage was funded via a statewide appeal and a large house in Gilberton, known as Oberlin House, was secured for the purpose. Situated on the corner of Walkerville and Park Terraces, directly opposite the Buckingham Arms Hotel, the house had a large dining hall, two downstairs rooms for dormitories, two upstairs bedrooms and a large kitchen. There was also a paddock adjacent to the building, approximately one acre in size.\n\nThe Orphanage officially opened on 16 August 1866 and was managed by a board which included Catholic priests and laymen. A lay matron took charge of the first children sent to the Orphanage. A newspaper of the time reported the rules for the management of the Institution as follows:\n\n1. Children to rise from bed at 7o'clock a.m.; 2. Breakfast at 8 o'clock, an hour being allowed for washing, dressing, and prayer; 3. School to commence with prayer at 9.30 a.m., and to close also with prayer at 3 p.m. ; Dinner at 12 o'clock, the previous half-hour being allowed for play; 5. Supper to be served at 5 o'clock p.m. - young children allowed food when necessary; 6. Bed-hour (after prayer) for children of four years and over at 9 o'clock and 8 o'clock for those under that age; 7. Girls to be instructed in needlework, cookery, and other necessary domestic employment; 8. Boys to be employed at useful work, and to be carefully educated as to fit them for trades and other employment; 9. The matron shall neither receive nor allow any children to be taken out of the Orphanage unless by a written order from the Board signed by the Secretary; 10. Domestic servants and all others residing in the Orphanage to be strictly obedient to the command of the matron.\n\nIn 1867 the government approached the Catholic Church and pressured them to give shelter to Catholic children from the badly overcrowded state orphanage situated at that time in the Grace Darling Hotel at Brighton. In May of that year the St Vincent de Paul Orphanage was gazetted as an industrial school so that the government could pay a subsidy for each child admitted. In the first half of 1867 thirty-eight children moved from Brighton to Walkerville. As the government sent more children to the Walkerville home, it was soon found to be too small for the demand. A building known as Boston Cottages on King William Street South was leased and opened as a branch orphanage for the girls. Children accommodated there, although under the direct care of a lay matron, were supervised by of the Sisters of St Joseph. In June 1868 the girls moved again to a row of cottages on the corner of Franklin and Grey Streets in the City. At this time a number of the Sisters moved in to care for them. The boys were also moved to these premises in August 1868.\n\nDuring this period government sponsorship became intermittent and in 1872 ceased completely. However, the orphanage continued to run supported entirely by the church. In 1872 the children were moved from the City to a house in Mitcham, recently vacated by St Joseph's Refuge, which provided grounds as well as a building.\n\nIn November of 1872 the Orphanage Board ceased operating and the running of the Orphanage fell to the Sisters of St Joseph. Three years later, when the ownership of the Mitcham property changed hands, a larger premises known as Knightsbridge House was secured in Burnside and the children moved once again. In 1883 the Board was reconstituted as the Orphanage Committee, and they began the search for a more suitable property. This was found in 1888 and the children made their final move to a 12-13 acre (5 hectares) property secured by the Adelaide Archbishop on the corner of Mitchell Street and Goodwood Road, Millswood. The residence was renovated and new buildings added. One year later, by the order of Archbishop Reynolds, the Sisters of Mercy took over the running of the orphanage from the Sisters of St Joseph.\n\nDuring the early 1900s further additions were made so that the home could accommodate up to 120 children. Another new wing was opened in 1924.\n\nIn 1947 the Archbishop of Adelaide, Archbishop Beovich, requested that 50 Catholic migrant English girls be brought to Adelaide to be accommodated at the St Vincent De Paul Orphanage. Renovations and improvements were made to the Orphanage buildings in order to accept the girls. The United Kingdom and Commonwealth Governments recognized St Vincent De Paul Orphanage, Goodwood, as an 'approved organisation' for the introduction of child migrants under the free and assisted passage schemes in August 1948. On 17 December 1948 twenty-eight girls between the ages of 6 and 14 years left England on the 'Ormonda'. They arrived at Port Adelaide and moved into the Orphanage on 19 January 1949. In May a further 14 girls arrived on the 'Mooltan', and in June 1950 four more on the Otranto. Although this fulfilled only 46 of the originally 50 girls that were to make up 'Group Nomination S.G. 10' it was later agreed that the nomination had been fulfilled.\n\nIn September 1950 Archbishop Beovich began negotiations for 12 Maltese girls to come to St Vincent De Paul Orphanage, Goodwood. It was not until April 1954, however, that the first 3 girls arrived from Malta aboard the 'Surriento'. In October of that year 3 more girls arrived aboard the 'Fairsea'. Only two more girls were sent from Malta, 1 arriving on the 'Arosa Star' in January 1955 and the last on the 'Castel Felice' in February 1955.\n\nBy 1960 ninety-nine children were resident in the orphanage. This number dropped to 52 in 1970 and at its closure in 1975, only 20 children were in residence. The role of St Vincent de Paul Orphanage was replaced by a number of suburban cottage homes know as the St Vincent Group Homes.\n\nThe Children in State Care Commission of Inquiry in South Australia heard allegations from women about being sexually abused as girls living at St Vincent de Paul Orphanage, from the 1940s to the 1970s.\n\nLocation\n\n1866 - 1868\n\nLocation - St Vincent De Paul Orphanage was situated at Walkerville Terrace, Gilberton.

She was listed as “Hull 818” and her keel was laid down on March 18, 1945 and was launched and named Vassar Victory on May 4, and was delivered twenty-four days later on May 28, 1945.\n\nBeing the identical tonnage as her sister, the SS Vassar Victory was also handed over based on Lend Lease terms to Great Britain and like her sister, she also was sent to England where she was fitted out as a troop transport ship. But once again upon completion, she was also requested to return to the United States and operate to repatriate American troops from Europe. SS Vassar Victory made eight return voyages between Europe and North American ports and she returned to Baltimore concluding her duties on April 4, 1947. She was laid up in the James River and was duly placed on the market.\n\nThe SS Vassar Victory was then sold to Vlasov’s “Compania Argentina Navegacion de Ultramar” and she was reregistered to Panama. She departed Boston and headed for the Adriatic port of Ancona, arriving on July 19, 1947. The day after her arrival she was renamed “Castlebianco” and her registration was transferred to the Italian flag and her funnel was painted yellow with that famed big blue V being the “Vlasov” logo. At first she was used as a simple cargo ship.\n\nThe cargo ship, SS Castlebianco departed Ancona on August 16, 1947 for an around the world voyage, which became to say the least a horrific voyage! Amazingly she was collided twice with two other freighters, in addition she was grounded at one stage and heading for Sydney she was caught in a severe storm damaging her badly. She finally arrived in Sydney on April 23, 1948 and remained there for a two months in order to make the necessary repairs. Whilst at the Sydney’s Shipyard’s, the Australian’s were able to give her a partial interior refit in order to install some humble accommodations for 480 passengers.\n\nIt would not be until October 14, 1948 that the Castlebianco arrived for the very first time in Genoa, Italy with a crew complement of forty-four. Again, with the company having signed a contract with the IRO, the Castlebianco had taken on board a full complement of refugees and made ready to depart, which she did on October 19, 1948 and she headed for Sydney, Australia, where she arrived on November 19. Castlebianco, as did the SS Wooster Victory, was called to head for Shanghai where she was filled to capacity with Russian Jews who were fleeing persecution in China.\n\nSS Castlebianco continued voyages from Genoa via Naples sailing via the Suez Canal, Melbourne and Sydney, with emergency voyages to the East Indies (Indonesia) to collect Dutch citizens who were suffering persecution, after the nation had proclaimed its independence, and thus they and Indonesian’s who preferred to depart also would sail to Amsterdam or Rotterdam The ship operated on this service until April 19, 1950, for thereafter Bremerhaven would become her homeport for the Australian service!\n\nFirst Major Refit in 1950:\n\nThe Castlebianco arrived in Genoa from Bremerhaven after returning from a voyage to Australia on July 13, 1950 and she was placed at the Calata Sanita Fit-Out berth where she would undergo a radical transformation to become a passenger Liner.\n\nShe was fitted steerage accommodations for 1,132 passengers with a crew of 122Whilst the deckhouse aft of her smokestack was enlarged where a new Social Lounge was fitted, whilst other public facilities were located elsewhere. In addition her hull was painted white and a full row of portholes were added in her hull. Besides her original four lifeboats an additions eighteen lifeboats were added, six located forward of her main superstructure and twelve aft making a total of twenty-two lifeboats.\n\nOnce completed, the SS Castlebianco headed for Bremerhaven and on September 4, 1950 she departed for Sydney and she remained on the Australian service in accordance with the IRO schedule.\n\nHowever, soon she would undergo another refit that would the largest transformation take place!\n\nSecond Major Rebuild & Refit in 1952/53:\n\nThis was one of the largest refits undertaken and much was learned, for the Castle Verde’s refit was undertaken a year later.\n\nAs SS Castlebianco had offloaded her passengers from Australia service on August 30, 1952, the very next day she arrived at Monfalcone Italy and the Cantieri Riuniti Dell’Adriatico Shipyards where she would undergo her very last major and most extensive rebuilding programme of her entire career! Topside there would be a new two deck superstructure, Boat and Sun Decks, surmounted by a central House, Added. The masts and cargo booms had been removed and the raised Bridge was given a new mast. A new Upper Shelter Deck or Saloon Deck was constructed in front of the original superstructure, thus extending the decks. In addition even more portholes were opened up in the hull allowing more new cabins to be fitted; as there were 111 with a porthole and 175 inside cabins. The dormitories were now reduced in size, as they were now either with 20 beds, or 42 beds. Total Accommodations was; 477 passengers in cabins, and 717 emigrants in dormitories.\n\nB Deck: This being the lower deck is where the dormitories were located and these were segregated and all had their own facilities close by.\n\nA Deck & Promenade Deck: This is where we find the vast majority of cabins for the full fare paying passengers, 56 cabins having private facilities.\n\nSaloon Deck: contained the two Dining Rooms, the Reading and Writing Room, the Ladies Room, as well as the Children’s Facilities and deck space, but outside this deck was encircled by the Promenade!\n\nBoat Deck: had eight cabins forward, but aft of these was the Ballroom, Lounge with a Bar and aft a Lido Deck with an open Swimming Pool.\n\nUpon completion her name was officially altered to Castel Bianco and she departed Monfalcone and arrived in Genoa late on March 3, 1953 after her six-month massive overhaul and she looked superb. Many said that this ship was just no longer recognisable from what she was, and there is no doubt about the huge changes made to the old Victory ship! Although there was just one problem, she was simply top heavy and thus the Castel Bianco became known as one of the “Worst of all the Sitmar rollers” for she would roll even in smooth seas! Thus it was no wonder when they rebuilt her sister ship in 1953, they did not build her up as high!\n\nShe departed Genoa on March 7, 1953, but she inaugurated a new service for Sitmar sailing from Genoa via the Canary Islands to Willemstad in Curacao and La Guaira in Venezuela and return. She was very successful and soon the company’s flagship SS Castel Felice joined became her running mate! Although during this time she did make several sailings to Canada with Hungarian migrants in the autumn of 1953. She continued the South American service until she was transferred to the Italy to New York service.\n\nIn 1956 the SS Castel Verde made her very visit to Australia Australian sailed into Sydney Harbour on Thursday November 15, 1956 although unlike other final visits no one was aware, thus no crowds to see her arrive, except for family members dockside and the same for those returning to Europe.\n\nAlthough, the Castel Bianco was the last of these two remarkable ships to visit Australia under the Sitmar Line banner, for her sister the Castle Verde made her last call to Sydney in 1954. Yet both ships would return to Australia in their next guises!\n\nConsidering the slowing down of the South American trade and the age of these ships, Sitmar decided to dispose of the Castel Bianco as well as her sister for Sitmar was still operating three fine ships the SS Castel Felice, MS Fairsea (1) and the SS Fairsky the new flagship on the Australian service, with occasional Trans-Atlantic voyages to New York and/or Canada.\n\nThus the SS Castel Bianco was laid up on February 17, 1957 and placed on the market. However within weeks a Spanish buyer came to inspect the ship and decided that she would be perfect for The Spanish Line as Cruise ships!\n\nThus, SS Castel Bianco was officially sold to “The Spanish Line” on March 17, 1957 who renamed her “Begona” and she departed for Barcelona where she would receive refit of not only improving her public facilities, but also deleting all dormitories and construction new and superior cabins thus reducing her passenger capacity 830 accommodated in comfortable cabins. It would be a month later that The Spanish Line would also obtain the Castel Verde and convert her.\n\nIn May 1957 the refit on the SS Begona had been completed and her inaugural voyages under the Spanish flag voyage would take her as far as Sydney Australia where she arrived on June 20, and she returned to Europe on July 19, 1957.\n\nAfter her Australian voyage she operated on the Canary Islands, Caribbean and Venezuela service based mostly in Southampton, with occasional voyages commencing and ending in Spain.\n\nTragically, October 4, 1974 she suffered a massive engine failure and she drifted for a several days, until the German tug “Oceanic” took her in tow to Bridgetown, Barbados. There she remained laid up there and it was considered that it was not worthwhile repairing her and thus she would be sold for scrap. She finally departed the next year for Castellon in Spain where she was broken up in 1975.\n\nSpecifications:\n\nBuilt: 1945 Bethlehem-Fairfield, Baltimore, USA.\n\nHull No: 818.\n\nTonnage: 7,223 GRT (1947).\n\n. 10,139 GRT (1954).\n\nLength: 138,7m.\n\nBeam: 18,9m.\n\nDraught: 10,49m.\n\n. 1 H.P. & L.P.

Fu indicata come \"Hull 818\" e la sua chiglia fu impostata il 18 marzo 1945, fu varata e chiamata Vassar Victory il 4 maggio, e fu consegnata ventiquattro giorni dopo, il 28 maggio 1945.\"\n\nAvendo lo stesso tonnellaggio della sorella, anche la SS Vassar Victory fu consegnata in base ai termini del Lend Lease alla Gran Bretagna e, come sua sorella, anche lei fu inviata in Inghilterra dove fu allestita come nave da trasporto truppe. Ma ancora una volta al termine, le è stato chiesto di tornare negli Stati Uniti e operare per rimpatriare le truppe americane dall' Europa. La SS Vassar Victory compì otto viaggi di andata e ritorno tra l'Europa e i porti del Nord America e tornò a destinazione a Baltimora concludendo le sue funzioni il 4 aprile 1947. Fu posta in disarmo ed è stata regolarmente immessa sul mercato.\n\nSS Castelbianco:\n\nLa SS Vassar Victory fu venduta alla “ Compannia Argentina Navegacion de Ultramar” di Vlasov e fu reimmatricolata a Panama. Se n'è andata da Boston e si diresse verso l'Adriatico porta Di Ancona, arrivando il 19 luglio 1947. Il giorno dopo il suo arrivo fu ribattezzata “Castlebianco” e la sua targa fu trasferita sulla bandiera italiana e il suo fumaiolo fu dipinto di giallo con quel famoso grande blu V è il logo \"Vlasov\". Inizialmente venne utilizzata come semplice nave da carico.\n\nL\n\nLa nave mercantile SS Castlebianco è partita da Ancona il 16 agosto 1947 per un viaggio intorno al mondo, che divenne a dir poco un viaggio orribile! Sorprendentemente, si è scontrata due volte con altri due mercantili, inoltre è rimasta a terra e si stava dirigendo verso Sydney è stata sorpresa da una forte tempesta che l'ha danneggiata gravemente. Finalmente è arrivata a Sydney il 23 aprile 1948 e vi rimase due mesi per effettuare le necessarie riparazioni. Mentre al Sydney's Shipyard's gli australiani sono stati in grado di provvedere ad un parziale rinnovamento degli interni per installare alcuni umili alloggi per 480 passeggeri.\n\nNon sarebbe stato fino al 14 ottobre 1948 che il Castlebianco è arrivato per la prima volta a Genova, Italia con un equipaggio di quarantaquattro persone. Anche in questo caso, avendo la compagnia firmato un contratto con l'IRO, la Castlebianco aveva preso a bordo l'intero equipaggio di profughi e si era preparata a partire, cosa che fece il 19 ottobre 1948 e si diresse verso Sydney, Australia, dove arrivò il 19 novembre. Castlebianco, come la SS Wooster Victory, fu chiamata a dirigersi verso Shangai dove era piena di ebrei russi che fuggivano dalle persecuzioni in Cina.\n\nLa SS Castlebianco continuò i viaggi da Genova via Napoli passando per il Canale di Suez, Melbourne e Sydney, con viaggi di emergenza nelle Indie Orientali (Indonesia) per raccogliere cittadini olandesi che soffrivano persecuzioni, dopo che la nazione aveva proclamato la propria indipendenza, e quindi loro e gli indonesiani; chi preferiva partire salpava anche per Amsterdam o Rotterdam. La nave operò su questo servizio fino al 19 aprile 1950, poiché da allora in poi Bremerhaven sarebbe diventata il suo porto di partenza per il servizio australiano!\n\nPrimo grande restauro nel 1950:\n\nArrivò il Castlebianco a Genova da Bremerhaven al ritorno da un viaggio in Australia il 13 luglio 1950 e venne sistemata presso l' attracco Calata Sanità dove subirà una radicale trasformazione per diventare una nave passeggeri.\n\nÈ stata dotata di alloggi di timoneria per 1.132 passeggeri con un equipaggio di 122 persone, mentre la tuga a poppa della ciminiera è stata ampliata dove è stata allestita una nuova sala sociale, mentre altre strutture pubbliche sono state situate altrove. Inoltre lo scafo è stato dipinto di bianco e sullo scafo è stata aggiunta una fila completa di oblò. Oltre alle quattro scialuppe di salvataggio originali, furono aggiunte diciotto scialuppe di salvataggio, sei situate a prua della sovrastruttura principale e dodici a poppa, per un totale di ventidue scialuppe di salvataggio.\n\nUna volta completata, la SS Castlebianco si diresse verso Bremerhaven e il 4 settembre 1950 e partì per Sydney e rimase sul servizio australiano secondo il programma IRO.\n\nTuttavia, presto sarebbe stata sottoposta ad un altro restauro che avrebbe avuto luogo con la trasformazione più grande!\n\nSeconda grande ricostruzione e ristrutturazione nel 1952/53:\n\nQuesto fu uno dei più grandi lavori di ristrutturazione intrapresi e si apprese molto, poiché il restauro del Castello Verde fu intrapreso un anno dopo.\n\nDa quando la SS Castlebianco aveva scaricato i suoi passeggeri in Australia in servizio dal 30 agosto 1952, il giorno successivo all'arrivo a Monfalcone Italia ai Cantieri Riuniti Dell'Adriatico dove sarebbe stata sottoposta al suo ultimo importante e più ampio programma di ricostruzione di tutta la sua carriera! Sulla parte superiore ci sarebbe una nuova sovrastruttura a due ponti, Boat e Sun Decks, sormontata da una casa centrale. Gli alberi e i bracci da carico erano stati rimossi e al ponte rialzato era stato dato un nuovo albero. Un nuovo Upper Shelter Deck o Saloon Deck è stato costruito davanti alla sovrastruttura originale, estendendo così i ponti. Inoltre sono stati aperti ancora più oblò nello scafo consentendo l'allestimento di nuove cabine; poiché erano 111 con oblò e 175 cabine interne. I dormitori erano ora di dimensioni ridotte, poiché ora avevano 20 letti o 42 letti. Gli alloggi totali erano; 477 passeggeri nelle cabine e 717 emigranti nei dormitori.\n\nPonte B : Essendo il ponte inferiore, era il luogo in cui si trovavano i dormitori, che erano separati e tutti avevano le proprie strutture nelle vicinanze.\n\nA Deck & Promenade Deck : è qui che troviamo la maggior parte delle cabine per i passeggeri paganti la tariffa intera, 56 cabine con servizi privati.\n\nPonte Saloon : conteneva le due sale da pranzo, di Lettura e la sala di scrittura, la stanza delle donne, così come le strutture per i bambini e lo spazio sul ponte, ma fuori da questo ponte era circondato dalla Promenade!\n\nPonte della barca : aveva otto cabine a prua, ma a poppa di queste c'era la sala da ballo, il lounge con un bar e a poppa un ponte Lido con una piscina all'aperto.\n\nAl termine il suo nome fu ufficialmente cambiato in Castel Bianco e se ne andò da Monfalcone e siamo arrivati a Genova alla fine del 3 marzo 1953, dopo la massiccia revisione durata sei mesi, aveva un aspetto superbo. Molti dicevano che questa nave semplicemente non era più riconoscibile da quello che era, e non ci sono dubbi sugli enormi cambiamenti apportati alla vecchia nave Victory! Anche se c'era solo un problema, era semplicemente troppo pesante e così il Castel Bianco divenne noto come uno dei \"peggiori di tutti i rulli Sitmar\" perché rotolava anche con mare calmo! Non c'era quindi da meravigliarsi che quando ricostruirono la sua nave gemella nel 1953, non la costruirono così in alto!\n\nSe n'è andata da Genova il 7 marzo 1953, ma inaugurò un nuovo servizio per Sitmar partendo da Genova attraverso le Isole Canarie a Willemstad a Curaçao e La Guaira in Venezuela e ritorno. Ebbe molto successo e ben presto l'ammiraglia della compagnia; SS Castel Felice si unì a lei diventando la sua compagna di corsa! Anche se durante questo periodo fece diversi viaggi verso il Canada con gli emigranti ungheresi nell'autunno del 1953. Continuò il servizio in Sud America fino al trasferimento A New York .\n\nNel 1956 la SS Castel Verde fece la sua vera visita in Australia. entrò nel porto di Sydney giovedì 15 novembre 1956 anche se, a differenza di altre visite finali, nessuno ne era a conoscenza, quindi non c'era folla ad assisterla, ad eccezione dei membri della famiglia in banchina e lo stesso per coloro che ritornano in Europa.\n\nTuttavia, la Castel Bianco fu l'ultima di queste due straordinarie navi a visitare l'Australia sotto l'insegna Sitmar Line, per sua sorella il Castello Verde ha fatto la sua ultima chiamata a Sydney nel 1954. Eppure entrambe le navi sarebbero tornate in Australia nelle loro prossime sembianze!\n\nConsiderando il rallentamento del commercio sudamericano e l'età di queste navi, Sitmar decise di cedere la Castel Bianco così come la sorella, poiché Sitmar gestiva ancora tre belle navi, la SS Castel Felice, la MS Fairsea (1) e la SS Fairsky la nuova ammiraglia del servizio australiano, con occasionali viaggi transatlantici verso New York e/o Canada.\n\nCosì la SS Castel Bianco venne dismessa il 17 febbraio 1957 e immessa sul mercato. Tuttavia nel giro di poche settimane un acquirente spagnolo venne a ispezionare la nave e decise che sarebbe stata perfetta per The Spanish Line come nave da crociera!\n\nLa SS Castel Bianco fu così ceduta ufficialmente il 17 marzo 1957 alla “Linea Spagnola” che la ribattezzò “Begona” e partì perBarcellonadove avrebbe ricevuto una ristrutturazione non solo migliorando le sue strutture pubbliche, ma anche eliminando tutti i dormitori e costruendo cabine nuove e superiori, riducendo così la sua capacità di 830 passeggeri alloggiati in cabine confortevoli. Un mese dopo anche la Linea Spagnola ottenne il Castel Verde e la convertì.\n\nNel maggio 1957 i lavori di ristrutturazione della SS Begona erano stati completati e i suoi viaggi inaugurali sotto bandiera spagnola l'avrebbero portata fino a Sydney, in Australia, dove arrivò il 20 giugno e fece ritorno aEuropail 19 luglio 1957.\n\nDopo il suo viaggio in Australia ha operato nelle Isole Canarie, nei Caraibi eVenezuela servizio basato principalmente a Southampton, con viaggi occasionali che iniziano e finiscono aSpagna.\n\nTragicamente, il 4 ottobre 1974 subì un grave guasto al motore e andò alla deriva per diversi giorni, finché il rimorchiatore tedesco “Oceanic” la portò a rimorchioBridgetown, Barbados. Là rimase lì a riposo e si ritenne che non valesse la pena ripararla e così sarebbe stata venduta per rottamazione.
