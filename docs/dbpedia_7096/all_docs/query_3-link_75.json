No Napkin, in title, is a nod to previous pacts whereby a group of family and friends inked their agreement for a different cruise on a nearby dinner napkin. This time around, with only family at side, no mouth linens were necessary as the exploration is about kinfolk, clans, Vikings, and heritage. Through uncompromising detail, you will feel as though youâre already on vacation, albeit without the jet lag and sea legs. Travel enthusiasts and vacation aficionados alike will appreciate how this guidebook takes you from port to port witnessing important culture while also preparing your mouth and mind to taste local cuisine. From the unsolved murders in Copenhagen to the Depeche Mode bar in Tallinn, from the SurstrÃ¶mming (fermented herring) in Stockholm to the Butterkuchen and FischbrÃ¶tchen in WarnemÃ¼nde, there is something bound to entice the adventurous to the finickiest in everyone. For our California team of novice globetrotters albeit travel zealots who spent countless hours reading endless archives on the web, writing, and exploring in our minds, this has been an adventure already. Uncovered in these pages are uncounted hours researching and discerning the best places to go, how to get from the port to all the sights, whilst being able to find yourself historically relevant in the countryâs culture. The narrative considers the layout of the boat, excursion-effecting times the sun will rise and set, and how many seasons of clothes weâll need considering the variance in weather (âdet fins ikke dÃ¥rlig vÃ¦r, bare dÃ¥rlige klÃ¦râ). We hope you enjoy this Baltic primer and literary exploration before your actual journey. This book will help you navigate your own individual course and give you the insights for proper preparation and packing. Anchors aweigh! Bon voyage and see you in June!

Up Your Travel Game Page | 15\n\nP:16\n\nWhy STEP? The Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) is a free service to allow U.S. citizens and nationals traveling and living abroad to enroll their trip with the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate. Enrolling in STEP has many benefits such as: â¢ Receive important information from the Embassy about safety conditions in your destination country, helping you make informed decisions about your travel plans. â¢ Help the U.S. Embassy contact you in an emergency, whether natural disaster, civil unrest, or family emergency. â¢ Help family and friends get in touch with you in an emergency. Who Should Register for STEP? The primary purpose of STEP is to keep American citizens safe. While you probably donât need to register if youâre taking a weekend trip to Canada, here are a few reasons to consider signing up: â¢ Youâre traveling to an area thatâs politically unstable or prone to violence. â¢ Youâre taking an extended trip (several weeks or months long) where you may have limited internet access. â¢ Youâre traveling for a major event, summit or conference (like the World Cup) that might become the target of protests or attacks. â¢ Youâre a minority traveling to an area where you might be targeted as an outsider. â¢ Youâd like an additional safety resource during your trip, no matter the destination. In the event of a rapidly deteriorating situation, such as a coup or natural disaster, STEP can connect you with evacuation efforts, or provide important safety information and help you take care of yourself. The Bottom Line STEP is a lot like travel insurance: If all goes well, youâll never need to use it and you might even forget you have it. But unfortunately, bad things do still happen all the time, all over the world. When things go wrong and your local US embassy or consulate kicks into high gear to make sure all Americans in their jurisdiction are safe and accounted for, STEP notifications can be incredibly important. Since the entire sign-up process takes less than five minutes, you should really just sit down and do it. First things first, create an account.

The Johnson clan (Ole Olson FjÃ¸se & JÃ¸ran TÃ¸rjersdatter Buserud â Donald Gerhard Johnson) and relatives lived in the Numedal Valley in Buskerud County. * In 2017 the Norwegian government decided to abolish some of the counties and to merge them with other counties to form larger ones, reducing the number of counties from 20 to 11, which was implemented on January 1, 2020. The colored map below shows the newly combined counties. Nowadays, The Johnson clan (Donald Gerhard Johnson) and relatives lived in Viken County.* Page | 34\n\nP:35\n\nIn Buskerud County, most of the ancestral (Donald Johnson) farms were located in the Numedal Valley between Flesberg and Kongsberg (see dotted circle in image below). Numedal is a valley and a traditional district in Eastern Norway located within the county of Buskerud. It traditionally includes the municipalities Flesberg, Nore og Uvdal and Rollag. Administratively, it now also includes Kongsberg. Numedal is the southernmost valley of the major valleys in Eastern Norway. Numedal is largely a U- shaped valley. Most of the area is mountainous, especially west of the main valley, with steep valley sides. Running northâsouth, it extends between Flesberg in the south to RÃ¸dberg in the north, passing through the municipalities of Flesberg, Rollag and Nore og Uvdal. The NumedalslÃ¥gen, the third-longest river in Norway, flows through the valley before discharging into Oslofjord at Larvik. The area along the NumedalslÃ¥gen from Flesberg up to the Hardangervidda through the valley has a large number of examples of Medieval Scandinavian architecture. There are still over 40 historic timber buildings and four stave churches: Flesberg Stave Church, Rollag Stave Church, Nore Stave Church and Uvdal Stave Church. Numedal was also the location of one of the \\\"Nordmann's trails\\\" (Nordmannsslepene), which were the old main roads between east and west over Hardangervidda. On the marked paths, remains of Stone Age dwelling places, bog iron works and grave mounds can be seen. Numedal also has several museums including Nore og Uvdal Open Air Museum (Nore og Uvdal Bygdetun) in Uvdal, Rollag Open Air Museum (Rollag Bygdetun) in Rollag, and DÃ¥set Open Air Museum (DÃ¥set bygdetun) at Flesberg. These are collections of historic buildings, mostly built in the traditional style common for the valley. Page | 35\n\nP:36\n\nElsie Johanna Berg was born in Wahoo Saunders County, Nebraska to Thomas Otto Berg and Helga Christine Karlson â who emigrated from Norway. Thomas Otto Berg, 23, and Helga Christine Karlson, 25, both lived and worked in Oslo, Norway. They had agreed to get married, but first, they wanted to get to America. Helga's sister, Frieda, 18, was also set to go with them. Thomas was a sailor and had been on American shores. Helga and Frieda already had two brothers and a sister in America. In 1903, Conrad Karlson, then 14, and Hilda Karlson, 16, had come to America with their passage being furnished by an uncle, Frank Edvall, who lived in Nebraska. In 1907 Conrad sent money to 16-year-old Oscar so he could join him there. Thomas Berg Family On September 30, 1921, Thomas, Helga, and Frieda sailed away from the shores of their homeland, not knowing if they would ever set foot on it again. They docked in New York on October 10th, were processed through Ellis Island (in their words, âan awful placeâ), and that night they boarded a train headed for Nebraska. It was still a four-day journey. They began to realize just how vast America truly was. Finally, on October 14, 1921, three tired Norwegian immigrants stepped off the train in Wahoo. As Conrad drove them the 10 miles from Wahoo to his farm they became very conscious of the difference between the world they had left and the world they had chosen. The rolling fields were as different from the mountains, forests, and the ocean as anything could possibly be. Helga went to work on a neighboring farm. Frieda went to work for the Akersons, who had homesteaded near Colon. She married their son, Otto, in 1925. Thomas worked for Conrad on his farm. There was much for a sailor to learn about farming! Thomas and Helga were married on April 12, 1922. They rented a farm 7 miles northeast of Wahoo and started farming. They had five daughters, Elsie, twins Eleanor and Evelyn, Genevieve and Violet (Evelyn died at 2Â½ years when she inhaled a nail into her windpipe). The children all graduated from Mead Consolidated School. In the spring of 1963, Tom and Helga retired from the farm and bought a home in Wahoo. Thomas took the job of Custodian at Bethlehem Lutheran Church. One of the happiest times for their grandchildren was helping Grandpa ring the church bells at 6:00 every Saturday evening. Thomas and Helga Berg now rest forever in the Marietta Cemetery in Saunders County, Nebraska.

Fun fact: Thomas Otto Bergâs father, Marius Berg, is from a mountainside farm near Ski. Marius was actually born Marius Nilsen â but the name of the place where they lived was Berget so he took the name Berg. Thomas was actually born in Hammerfest Finnmark Norway (pretty much the tip of the country). FYI â Thomasâ birthday is 01/25 (to carry on the crazy connections with Bekki and Danâs family)!!

From a Swedish childrenâs song, Rida, rida ranka literally translates as ride, ride a rocking horse - it also means to sit and ride on someone's lap, like a child would do.* Rida, rida Ranka til Mollarnâs hus Ride, ride Ranka to the Millerâs house Det var ingen hjemme uten lite katte puss Nobody home but little pussy cat The Miller ground feed Mollarn mor And the rooster crowed Og toppen gor And a dog sat under the bench Og sat der en hund under benken And rattled his chain Og skrammla i lenken Woof, woof, woof, woof Woof woof woof woof Wooldry, wooldry, woof, woof Wooldry wooldry woof woof WOOF WOOF Original Swedish version of Rida, rida, ranka was by Hans Henrik HallbÃ¤ck (1838-1885), after the story by Zacharias Topelius (1818-1898). Rida, rida ranka, Rider, rider, rocker*, hÃ¤sten heter Blanka. Horse is named Queen Blanka**. Liten riddare sÃ¥ rar Oh, little knight, sweet and dear, Ã¤nnu inga sporrar har. Riding spurs, still to appear. NÃ¤r han dem har vunnit, When you've won them at last barndomsro fÃ¶rsvunnit. Childhood's peace shall be past.

Horse is named Queen Blanka. Andra famntag Ã¤n av mor Once grown, not hugs of mother's frÃ¶jda dig, nÃ¤r du blir stor. Bring you joy, but another's. NÃ¤r du dem har vunnit, When you've won them at last mandomsro fÃ¶rsvunnit. Manhood's peace shall be past.

Take a closer look at that small, rectangular booklet in your hand. Depending on where youâre from, its color could tell you a lot about the country you call home. Although there are no strict international guidelines for passport colors, the shades are by no means random. Countries typically choose colors that pay tribute to their culture, politics, or faith, Claire Burrows of De La Rue, a British passport- making company, told the Economist. For example, Islamic countries often use green passport covers because the color is important in their religion. Member countries of ECOWAS (the Economic Community of West African States) cover their passports with various shades of green, too. Members of the European Union, on the other hand, use burgundy-colored passports, as do countries who would like to join the EU, such as Turkey. The United States tends to march by the beat of its own drum, and its passportâs hue is no different. While the country flipped between beige, green, and a variety of reds into the latter half of the 20th century, it finally settled on blue in 1976. As for the shade? It matches the blue on the American flag, according to the Economist. Citizens of many Caribbean and South American countries, including Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay, also carry blue passports. Smaller organizations have their own passport colors, as well. Interpol provides its members with black travel documents, while the UN passportâs pacific blue matches the helmets of its peacekeeping force. But why all of the dark shades? Darker colors are preferred because they can hide dirt, provide a nice contrast with the crest, and appear more official. There are some exceptions, of course. Baltic connection: If youâre a Swedish national who lost your passport, the country will send you an emergency travel documentâin pink.

Then, collect your luggage and take it through Customs by walking through an open doorway labelled \\\"Nothing to declare\\\".

The Metro has 37 stations, 24 of which are underground. In 2019, the Metro carried 79 million passengers. The original 20-kilometer system opened in 2002 serving nine stations on two lines: M1 and M2. The entrance to the Metro station is located near the end of Terminal 3. From the Arrivals exit of Terminal 3, walk straight across the terminal. At the end of the terminal, follow the signs for the Metro and take the escalator up one level. Continue straight to reach the entrance to the Metro. The airport station is a terminal station of Line M2 on the Copenhagen Metro. Donât worry about getting on the wrong metro train as all trains departing from here head in the same direction. The metro heads towards VanlÃ¸se Station with stops in central Copenhagen such as NÃ¸rreport Station and Christianshavn Station. The metro does not stop at Copenhagen Central Station; however, it does take you to nearby NÃ¸rreport, also in the central part of the city. During the day and evening, the metro runs every 4 to 6 minutes. At night the metro runs every 15 to 20 minutes. Tickets for the Metro can be purchased at machines in the baggage claim area, machines near the DSB ticket sales counter inside Terminal 3, or at the entrance of the Metro station. These machines only accept coins and some credit cards or debit cards with PIN. You should pick up the following Metro line to get to the city center of Copenhagen: VanlÃ¸se NÃ¸rreport (zone 1) will cost you 36 DKK (about $6 USD) if you havenât purchased the Copenhagen Card and should take about 15 minutes (not too shabby!).

Both the ISO code \\\"DKK\\\" and currency sign \\\"kr.\\\" are in common use; the former precedes the value, the latter in some contexts follows it. The currency is sometimes referred to as the Danish crown in English, since krone literally means crown. Historically, krone coins have been minted in Denmark since the 17th century. One krone is subdivided into 100 Ã¸re, the name Ã¸re possibly deriving from Latin aureus meaning \\\"gold coin\\\", or more plausibly from Latin as \\\"bronze\\\". Altogether there are eleven denominations of the krone, with the smallest being the 50 Ã¸re coin (one half of a krone). Formerly there were more Ã¸re coins, but those were discontinued due to inflation. The krone is pegged to the euro via the ERM II, the European Union's exchange rate mechanism. Adoption of the euro is favored by some of the major political parties; however, a 2000 referendum on joining the Eurozone was defeated with 53.2% voting to maintain the krone and 46.8% voting to join the Eurozone.

Discovery On Friday morning, February 20th 1948, domestic help Mrs. JÃ¸rgensen arrived at Peter Bangs Vej 74 in Frederiksberg, a leafy neighborhood in Copenhagen, Denmark. She went up the kitchen stairs as usual but found the kitchen door locked and the security chain on, which was very unusual. Instead, she went around and entered the 3rd floor apartment through the main door. As she went down the hallway inside the apartment, she passed the \\\"gentlemen's room\\\" where she saw what looked like a pair of pants and a pair of mens shoes. She didn't think too much of that and continued to the bedroom. There, she discovered the bloody body of Mrs. Jacobsen, her employer. Panicked, she ran to the next door neighbor and together they called the police. First at the scene was Detective LÃ¼tken-Larsen. He saw that the pants and shoes in the gentlemen's room was actually the body of Mr. Jacobsen. With a potential double homicide on his hands, he called the station for backup. The first to arrive was the police chief himself, Mr. Parker. He insisted that he be let inside. A few minutes later, more policemen arrived and suddenly the apartment was swarming with police. Mr. Jacobsen Vilhelm Jacobsen was 54 years old and worked as an office manager. He and his wife belonged to the upper middle class. He was described by people who knew him as introverted and as a man of few words. He never went into lengthy discussions and no one knew with whom he had sympathized during WWII. One of his interests was betting on horses and he could often be found at the race track. Page | 89\n\nP:90\n\nHe was found lying on his back covered by a blanket. Two towels were tied around his neck and a rolled-up woman's stocking was pushed into his mouth. From his neck and down around his right arm was a light-blue bed spread that had been tied on the middle. Beneath his head was a pillow, and beneath the pillow there was a bouquet of tulips. An armchair which had had some parts ripped off was placed across the body. Above Mr. Jacobsen's head a walking stick had been placed. The walking stick had been taken from the couple's own collection and had once belonged to Mrs. Jacobsen's late father. There was blood everywhere on the floor and across the furniture. Mr. Jacobsen's right wrist had been cut to the bone. Later, a bloody kitchen knife, taken from the Jacobsens' kitchen, was found beneath his right arm. By his left side was a lamp with the wire cut off, a pair of glasses with broken lenses and another single, broken lens. The cause of death was determined to be blunt force trauma to the head. His wrist had not been cut until after he was dead. Mrs. Jacobsen Inger Margrethe Jacobsen was 52 years old and was a housewife. She didn't engage much in housekeeping though, as they had domestic help. Instead, she spent her days preparing dinner parties and visiting friends. Mrs. Jacobsen was described as extroverted and very talkative. She and her husband never had children but appeared to be happily married. Page | 90\n\nP:91\n\nShe was found on the floor lying on her stomach, her head pointing towards the door. Beneath her head there was a pillow and a bed spread, and she was was covered with two duvets. A bloody towel was placed across her left shoulder and down her back. A walking stick had been placed across her body. This too came from their collection; this one had belonged to Mrs. Jacobsen's mother. Her head was covered in blood and the carpet beneath her was soaked in blood too. She was wearing two pairs of undergarments, both put on inside out. There were no signs on her body that she had been sexually assaulted.She too had died of blunt force trauma to the head. The room in the bottom right corner is where Mr. Jacobsen was found; the other X marks the bedroom Blood traces on where Mrs. Jacobsen was the floor found. indicated that Other findings Mrs. Jacobsen's The curtains had body had been been drawn in the dragged living room, the through the bedroom and the apartment. gentlemen's room. Wires had been cut throughout the apartment, even those behind heavy furniture. Some trinkets on one window sill appeared to have been moved around. In the living room an odd exhibit had been made on a shelf above the radiator: a couple of fake teeth, a couple of earrings and two combs. All of these things were smeared with blood. They were quickly discovered to have belonged to Mrs. Jacobsen. Also in the living room there was a large pool of blood with long human hairs in it. The rest of the apartment was, with a few exceptions, untouched, and nothing appeared to have been removed despite there being several valuable antiques and jewelry. Some bottles in the wine collection had been moved around and one small bottle had been emptied. The mail slot on the main door appeared loose, as if someone had removed to be able to reach through and unlock the door, but it was never established whether it had been that way before or not. Page | 91\n\nP:92\n\nIn the dining room there was a key in the top drawer of a cabinet. Only Mr. Jacobsen had access to this drawer, and he always carried the key to it in his pocket. In the drawer there was a new checkbook, with two checks missing. On the stub of the first one it said (translated) \\\"Febraury 19th 1948 - 8,500 DKK - myself\\\"; nothing was written on the second stub. Police were not able to establish whether it was Mr. Jacobsen's handwriting or not. The checks were never cashed nor found. Also missing were 216 DKK that Mr. Jacobsen had been paid from his office the previous afternoon. The police felt certain that the lamp that had been found next to Mr. Jacobsen's body had been the murder weapon. It was a heavy porcelain lamp with a bottom made from lead that weighed several kilograms. Bits of blood and human tissue was found on the lamp. The downstairs neighbor testified that on the 19th, she had heard several loud bumps from the Jacobsens' apartment between 4 pm and 5 pm. Then it had been quiet until around 11.30 pm when she started hearing heavy, dragging footsteps from a man who went to and from the kitchen and the rest of the apartment. She could also hear water running. The footsteps continued until at lest 12.30 am - at that time the neighbor had taken a sleeping pill and gone to sleep. Mr. Erik Ramdahl A few hours after the police had arrived at the apartment, a well- dressed man appeared at the apartment. He introduced himself as Erik Ramdahl and told the officers that he and his wife were the Jacobsens' best and oldest friends. He offered to share his knowledge of the couple with the police. He was invited inside the apartment and spent about an hour there talking about the couple and also identifying the bodies. Whodunnit? Despite pouring in huge amounts of effort and man-hours, the police never found the murderer (or murderers). There are, however, several theories: Theory No. 1 The first theory concerns Mr. Ramdahl. In 1954, a detective realized that his alibi had never been tested. Sadly, by that time it was too late. But looking through his interviews, an oddity appeared: he had told the police that every Friday he had brought some raw liver to Mrs. Jacobsen who would eat it to treat some blood disease. However, her doctor knew nothing about said blood disease. The police theorized that Mrs. Jacobsen had already been dead by the time Mr. Jacobsen returned from work on the 19th. As such, the killer would have needed an excuse to be alone in the apartment. Mr. Ramdahl would fit that bill, being a close friend. He also had a club foot which caused him to drag one leg. He also changed his alibi over the years. Mr. Ramdahl was a member of a music club which met every Thursday. He had told police that he had not gone there on the 19th, due to feeling unwell. This part was actually the one part of his alibi that the police were able to verify: the music club confirmed that Mr. Ramdahl had not been there that night. But 25 years later, he suddenly said that he had gone to the music club. And then, three years later, he said that his wife, who was dead by then, had come along too. Page | 92\n\nP:93\n\nTheory No. 2 The second theory concerns a phone number found in Mrs. Jacobsen's address book. There was no name written with it, just the number. It belonged to a factory owner. It was speculated that the factory owner was Mrs. Jacobsen's lover. His alibi was never verified by the police and they took a very gentle approach during interrogations. However, a couple of witnesses might corroborate this theory. The first witness was a girl who on the day before the murders had looked out of her window. Her apartment building shared a yard with the Jacobsens' apartment building, and on that day she saw a man standing there looking at the Jacobsens' windows. Her description of the man matched that of the factory owner. The other witness was the local greengrocer, who had seen a big car parked in the street on the day of the murders. The factory owner did have a big car. The theory is that Mrs. Jacobsen had some information that could prove detrimental to the factory owner's businesses and that he had gone to the apartment to silence her. And then he had to stay and kill Mr. Jacobsen too. Theory No. 3 The third theory is quite convoluted, so I won't go into too much detail. In short, it builds on an unconfirmed suspicion that Mr. Jacobsen was involved in black market trading during and after WWII. There was a big case in Denmark surrounding black market trading called \\\"Edderkopsagen\\\" or \\\"The Spider Case\\\". This case not only stretched far into the criminal world but involved several police officers as well - 15 officers were convicted in the trial. The case started rolling in 1948. The theory is that Mr. Jacobsen was somehow involved in the case too and that the police covered up several details surrounding the murders. Theory No. 4 Others close to the mystery have uncovered another reality, and describe how Inger Margrethe Jacobsen often flirted openly with other men to her husband's enormous frustration.And she didn't stop at just flirting. In the last months of her life, she sought out several fortune tellers and media, whom she confided that she had begun a relationship with a younger married man who had a child. One in particular was Gudny Westfjord. In the last weeks of her life, Inger Margrethe Jacobsen seemed worried and she was taking some nerve medication. Vilhelm Jacobsen, too, seemed tense in the last days of his life - something he always did when his wife flirted blatantly. This man may have visited Inger Margrethe Jacobsen in the apartment on Peter Bangs Vej, where they cared for their intimate relationship, which she found increasingly troublesome - also because he often wanted money from her. This gentleman was divorced and had custody of a daughter who, incidentally, is still alive. Before Vilhelm Jacobsen returned home from work on February 19, several witnesses saw him with a woman in the Botanical Garden. The woman had a dog with her, and the witnesses' signaling of her fits very well with the killerâs ex- wife. She told Vilhelm Jacobsen about the wife's affair with the alleged killer? What the two talked about has never been clarified. She subsequently died under very mysterious circumstances.

Some researchers have been granted access - and now also 44-year-old journalist Peer Kaae. Unknowns On the 10th anniversary of the reduction of Vilhelm and Inger Margrethe Jacobsen's urns at SÃ¸ndermark Cemetery in Frederiksberg - one day only very few known - something very strange happened.
