Fire on a ship is probably the greatest danger any ship's crew can face. Fortunately for the 347 passengers on board Le Boreal, the fire was confined to the engine room, and the ship remained stable, with all on board safe. Considerable effort goes into making ships as safe as possible, and the fact that no lives were lost in the Le Boreal incident shows how effective safety measures on modern ships are. And although the fire on board the car ferry Norman Atlantic almost a year ago, in December 2015, was far worse, with at least 13 people known to have died, hundreds more were brought to safety. Despite the safety culture dominating the shipping industry, mechanical breakdowns are not uncommon, with the former Cal Mac The luxury cruise ship Le Boreul in difficulty after a fire on board when she was in the southern oceans. i r vessel Suilven's capsize off Fiji a case in point, although the reasons for her capsize are unknown. Around the same time, the cargo vessel Skog also suffered engine failure, when off Orkney, and had to be towed to safety. As well as reports on these and all the latest happenings in the shipping world, we have two features which I found of particular interest (pages 36 to 43). They provide a contrast between cargo vessels of the early to mid-20th century and today's boxboat giants. What I found worth remembering was the fact that the ships seen in Shanghai in the 1970s were built to do the samejob that the 18,000TEU container ships do today, even though the vessels themselves could not be more different.

Steven Duff FEBRUARY 2016 • Volume 51 • N0.2 New on the Clyde TUGS Clyde Marine Services has taken delivery of its first Damen ASD Tug. The Damen ASD 2310 CMS Warrior will join a 12-strong fleet of tugs and crew tenders at the Scottish company. Based in Creenock, Clyde Marine Services was established in 1913 and has a long history of working with Damen vessels. The company's five harbour tugs service all ports on the Clyde, including Campbeltown. The Damen ASD 2310 Tug has a 52-tonne bollard pull ahead, and has spacious accommodation for six crew. She is a versatile vessel, suitable for all kinds of Jobs, with proven quality, making the cost of ownership very reasonable. ACCIDENT The former Cal Mac ferry Suilven, remembered from introducing drive- on/off vehicle services to the Isle of Lewis over 40 years ago, capsized off Fiji on 24 November 2015. About 27 crew members were on board the 41-year-old inter-island ferry, which is still named Suilven, when she started to sink and all were rescued. The vessel got into trouble at the entrance to Suva Harbour, and Rescue Units were placed on stand-by in and around the Harbour. The ferry was completely under water within an hour and tug boats from the nearby wharf, as well as the Fijian Navy, were dispatched to the area. The ship was no longer a passenger ship and was carrying cargo only, so no passengers were on board when the sinking occurred. The vessel was sailing into Suva from Fiji's Northern Division. The Maritime Safety Authority of Fiji are investigating the incident. Built in 1974, Suilven was operated for 21 years by Cal Mac. Suilven's original name was retained after sale to Fiji operator Bligh Water Shipping in 2005 and also following a further switch to freight work for Venu Shipping from August 2012. SUILVEN SHIPPING Suilven (l974/3638gt) arrives back in harbour following sea trials after a spell of refurbishment in the drydock at VT Fitzroy in Auckland, when working in New Zealand waters. She is now operated by venu Shipping of Fiji but her capsizing pobaby spells the end for this historic vessel, trevor coppock/seapixonline.com Cows helped by coaster FREIGHT In November 2015 farmers on the outer Orkney island of Westray were struggling to maintain breeding cow numbers. They were short of fodder due to the exceptionally wet summer so they were unable to put the cattle out to grass due to waterlogged conditions, which also meant they were unable to make hay or silage to feed the livestock over the winter. Such was the demand for straw that it was more economical to ship it directly by sea and the coaster Burhou 1, which normally works on the timber log trade in western Scotland, sailed to Montrose on 1 November to load the first of three 180-tonne emergency shipments of straw in bales, before setting off on the 20-hour voyage to Westray. The three shipments of fodder to Westray were all carried by Burhou 1, having been organised by the Royal Scottish Agricultural Benevolent Institute, who paid 50 per cent of the transport costs, in conjunction with the Angus National Farmers' Union to help the farms. RC Tilbury success for P&O ABOVE The 1999-built ro-ro ferry Norsky is one of two operated out of Tilbury by P&O Ferries. She is owned by Bore Sky and operated by P&O Ferries, company photo FREIGHT FERRY In November 2015 P&O Ferries carried its millionth unit of freight out of the port of Tilbury, after an increase in volumes of almost 300 per cent since it launched the North Sea route to the continent eight years ago. The company is on course to carry a record 210,000 units of freight between Tilbury and its Zeebrugge hub this year, up from 70,000 units in the first full year of operation in 2008. Demand for importing and exporting consumable goods, such as paper, steel, food, detergents and machinery into a portjust 25 miles from central London and seven miles from the M25, has grown rapidly. Tilbury is the closest sea port to London and P&O Ferries offers 24 sailings a week direct to Zeebrugge. Helen Deeble, Chief Executive of P&O Ferries, said: 'The key to the route's success is that exporters of consumables such as paper, steel, food, detergents and machinery, want to get their products as close to London as possible. We ship cars between Europe and Britain, and we have also seen a significant increase in handling hazardous cargoes.' P&O Ferries operates two ships, Norstream and Norsky, between Tilbury and Zeebrugge. Both are well suited for operating on the Thames, with the capacity to double-stack containers and also offering cabins. 6 * February 2016 • www.shipsmonthly.com Transform Tasmania Spirit of Tasmania l, and sistership spirit of Tasmania ll, have both undergone major refurbishments, with upgraded pubiic areas and new cinemas added.

RP New berth for Poole Aframax arctic tanker ABOVE The hull of a new Aframax tanker designed for the Arctic would be equipped with an Ice Load Monitoring System which would provide the bridge staff with the specific Ice load on the hull while operating In heavy Ice. aker arctic technology inc NEWBUILDS Finland's Aker Arctic Technology Inc, In collaboration with compatriot company Deltamarin Ltd, has completed the design of a 266m by 46m Aframax- slzed tanker capable of transporting crude oil and oil products In the Arctic. The 118,000dwt Arctic Aframax tanker would be built to Ice class PCS and be capable of continuously breaking Ice greater than a meter thick using two controllable-pitch propellers and shafts directly coupled to twin slow- speed diesel engines. A focus has been on developing an Improved command bridge, where the new Aker Arctic ARC Bridge Concept was used. The mechanical configuration, which could also Incorporate LNC burning dual-fuel engines, would give the design an economical open water speed of 15.5 knots and allow the vessel to operate on the Northern Sea Route during the extended summer months and, with Icebreaker assistance, even longer. During the winter months the ship could be employed In sub-Arctic areas such as the Baltic and Sakhalin Seas.

She carried a 2015 total of 11,350 passengers, representing an increase of 15 per cent, along with 2,200 cars. She provided an alternative to a four-hour road journey from Clasgow to Campbeltown. Last year's growth was achieved despite the disruption of sailings as a result of technical issues, bad weather and industrial action. This will be taken into account as l3St year's passenger statistics are considered by consultants carrying out a detailed survey to help Transport Scotland evaluate the pilot operation.

WILLIAM MAYES Another old-timer goes east VERONICA Veronica, the elegant former liner Kungsholm, which was launched on 14 April 1964, arrived at Alang under tow on 16 November 2015, with breaking commencing three days later. Having entered service on 24 April 1966, she lasted almost 50 years and was one of the very last surviving passenger ships to have been built on the Clyde. Her final years were something of a mixture, as she was used for cruising, and latterly as an accommodation ship, but when John Brown built her in 1966 she was a luxurious combined transatlantic liner and cruise ship. She was the fourth Swedish American Line ship to bear the Kungsholm name. Passenger services were in decline, and although the ship had been built mainly for cruising, by 1975 the company had decided that it could no longer profitably operate passenger ships. She was later sold to Flagship Cruises, who continued to operate her as Kungsholm, but under Liberian registry. In 1978 P&O bought the ship and she was rebuilt, emerging as Sea Princess, with her cruising capacity increased from 450 to 750. She was not popular in Australia and was replaced in 1981 by Ghana. Sea Princess then operated for Princess Cruises and P&O Cruises before being renamed Victoria in 1995. P&O sold her and she went to the German market as Mona Lisa. In 2007 she sailed for Louis Cruises as Oceanic II and later became The Scholar Ship.

Le Boreal was on passage from Crave Cove on West Falkland to South Ceorgia at the time of the incident. Although the fire was eventually extinguished by the crew, a full evacuation was ordered as the ship was without power and drifting in a north-westerly gale towards Cape Dolphin on East Falkland. Two RAF Sea King search and rescue helicopters were despatched to the scene and between them winched 79 people from the ship and from life rafts. The patrol vessel FIMS Clyde also sped to the area and assisted more than 200 other passengers and crew in lifeboats. These were later transferred to Le Boreal's sistership L'Austral, which was also in the area. The total number of persons on board was 347. Le Boreal was later taken in tow by the Dutch tugs Dintelstroom and Ciessenstroom (both on charter to the Ministry of Defence) and arrived at the Royal Navy base at Mare Flarbour on East Falkland during the afternoon of 19 November 2015. There were no casualties during the evacuation, and damage to the ship was being assessed prior to a decision on where repairs would be carried out. Balconies for Boudicca FRED. OLSEN CRUISE Fred.

In November 2016 she will reposition to Barbados, from where she will undertake seven- day port-intensive cruises with no sea days. Thomson Discovery will be 20 years old when she joins the Thomson fleet, but even at that age she will be their newest ship. Mein Schiff 1 and 2, which are of a similar vintage, will be transferred from TUI to Thomson in around 2019-20, probably replacing the 1982-built Thomson Spirit and 1991-built Thomson Majesty, both of which are chartered from Louis. More Vikings ordered VIKING OCEAN CRUISES As Viking Ocean Cruises' first ship. Viking Star, completes her first six months in service, it seems that the combination of her success, together with advance booking both for her and the next two sisterships, has given the company the confidence to place orders for fifth and sixth ships.

The Navy has now created an Auxiliary Platforms and Payloads Council to investigate other roles for the class. The Pentagon is considering using the them as platforms for Marines' afloat command and control requirements. This could see them equipped with unmanned vehicles for intelligence and surveillance missions. US NAVY • The next Littoral Combat Ships to deploy overseas are to be fitted with over-the-horizon surface-to- surface missile systems as part of efforts to increase the firepower of the class. USS Freedom is to deploy to the western Pacific early in 2016 and USS Coronado later in the year. One ship is expected to mount the tried and tested Harpoon anti-ship system, the other the Kongsberg Naval Strike Missile. The Norwegian system was test-fired on Coronado in 2014. RUSSIAN NAVY • The navy is to receive ten Buyan-M class missile corvettes by 2019, which is more than originally planned. The 950-tonne vessels can be equipped with eight vertically launched Kalibr missiles, the weapon that was so effectively demonstrated in attacks against Islamic State militants. Despite economic troubles and international sanctions, Russia has embarked on a US$325 billion programme to modernise 70 per cent of its military by 2020.

RC Russian Navy buys cargo SHIP PURCHASES The Russian involvement in Syria has resulted in a significant increase in both naval and merchant traffic between Russian Black Sea ports and Tartous in Syria, and in October 2015 the Russian Navy purchased two general cargo vessels to carry military equipment to Syria. These were the 7,250dwt Turkish-built Dadali (1985), which was renamed Vologda-50, and the 6,388dwt Alican Deval (1985), which had been previously operated by Deval Shipping & Trading of Turkey. Alican Deval was docked in Novorossiysk on 11 October and renamed Dvinitsa-50, and passed through the Bosphorus on 14 October 2015 to deliver military cargoes to Syria. In addition to these, the Austrian-built sea/river class vessel Georgiy Agafonov (1987) is operating as Kazan-60 for the Russians. RC Croatia building LNG ABOVE Europe's first LNC-fuelled container ships are under construction at Croatia's Brodosplit yard for Brodosplit Navigation Ltd. BOXBOATS Construction has started at Croatia's Brodosplit shipyard in Split on four 184.43m by 27.5m LNC-fuelled container ships for Brodosplit Navigation Ltd with a steel-cutting ceremony in Split on 12 November 2015. The 24,000dwt vessels will accommodate 2,000TEUs and travel at a service speed of 18 knots using low- speed, two-stroke dual-fuel engines of 11,060kW output. These are to be manufactured by the Brodosplit diesel engine factory under licence from MAN, while the ships themselves will be classed by DNV CL. Brodosplit expects these LNC-powered vessels to be more attractive in the global market due to new international regulations. JS 16 • February 2016 • www.shipsmonthly.com Designs for the feeder ships for the future Economical container feeder vessel designs have been on the minds of naval architects and shipowners recently, and both Deltamarin Ltd and Wartsila of Finland have come up with several possibilities. Deltamarin's entrant is the A.Delta2300, the first in a series of feeder vessel designs that the Finnish company says offers 'best-in- class' cargo capacity along with trading flexibility and fuel economy. Deltamarin has been working with China's AVIC Weihai Shipyard, which is associated with Deltamarin through its current Chinese ownership, to make sure its new concept is as shipyard production-friendly as possible. At the same time, classification society DNV CL has reviewed the design concerning latest international regulations and industry practices. Using three series of model tests carried out at the Hamburg Ship Model Basin, the A.Delta2300 hull form has been optimised to ensure low resistance combined with high propulsion efficiency. This has resulted in an expected fuel burn rate of 42 tons per day at 19 knots. The proposed 188.6m by 30.95m ship offers a container capacity of 2,322TEU (1,700TEU at 14 tonnes per loaded TEU), 500 of which could be refrigerated, in five cargo holds and on deck with a readiness for conversion to LNC fuel. Finland's Wartsila has introduced designs for a series of four container feeder vessels that, like the Deltamarin design, incorporate optimal fuel efficiency while being compliant with all known current and future environmental regulations. Each design is available in three versions, with a conventional design using heavy fuel oil (HFO), an environmental design using HFO with exhaust cleaning scrubber systems, and a clean design with dual-fuel capability and running mainly on LNC. The largest of the Wartsila ships, a 3,800TEU capacity vessel, would be 738ft in length and be powered by an 24,400hp W6X72DF dual-fuel engine drawing LNC from three tanks of a combined 1,950m^ capacity set in the lower aft section of the hull. JS Crowley names first of four TANKER In early November 2015 Crowley Maritime Corp christened the first of four new, Jones Act product tankers at the Tampa Cruise Terminal. The 50,000dwt 330,000-barrel capacity ship Ohio is the first tanker ever to receive the American Bureau of Shipping's (ABS) LNC-Ready Level 1 approval, meaning Crowley has the option to convert the tanker to LNC propulsion in the future. Over 100 guests watched as Pamela Beall, president of MPLX, a Marathon Petroleum Corporation subsidiary, performed the traditional christening by breaking a ceremonial bottle of champagne across the vessel's hull. Ohio was constructed by Aker Philadelphia Shipyard, Inc (APSI), with construction management services provided by Crowley's Seattle-based naval architecture and marine engineering subsidiary Jensen Maritime. The remaining three product tankers are also being built by APSI for Crowley and have planned deliveries through 2016. The new tankers are based on a proven Hyundai Mipo Dockyards design which incorporates numerous fuel efficiency features, flexible cargo capability and the latest regulatory requirements. ABOVE The 600ft-long tanker Ohio is the first of four newly built, LNC-ready product tankers for the US coastwise trade and can carry crude oil or refined petroleum products, crowley ABOVE Europe's largest LNC bunker and feeder tanker will be placed in service by Skangass during the first quarter of 2017. wArtsiU\\ Scandinavians go LNC BUNKER TANKER Sirius Veder Cas AB, a joint venture formed between Sirius Rederi of Sweden and the Anthony Veder Croup of the Netherlands, expects to take delivery of Europe's largest LNC bunker and feeder vessel, the 5,800m^ capacity Coralius, from Holland's Royal Bodewes in the first quarter of 2017. The new ship is to be powered by a Wartsila propulsion package consisting of a six-cylinder Wartsila 34DF dual-fuel main engine, capable of running on either LNC or diesel, driving a Wartsila controllable pitch propeller through a reduction gearbox fitted with power take-off. When delivered, the ship will be operated on long-term charter by Skangass to serve the Baltic and Scandinavian LNC markets. In addition to supplying bunkers to LNC fuelled ships, the new vessel will distribute LNC to areas that do not have access to natural gas via pipeline. It is expected to load LNC in Norway and Sweden for distribution in the Baltic area.

Now it is all over, and Russell Plummer looks at the career of the operation's popular vessel, island Escape, which had previous service going back to the early 1980s. A n intriguing chapter in British cruising history closed on 27 October 2015 when Island Escape returned to Palma, Majorca at the end of her 30th itinerary of 2015 and the very last in 12 years of Mediterranean trips which had an emphasis on informality. This was the ship where set times for meals and formal dress code were forgotten and, with all- inclusive cruising introduced in recent times, thousands of passengers flew out from Britain to enjoy a unique on- board atmosphere with, as the original Island Cruises management put it. Island Escape at Genoa during an Island Cruises Western Mediterranean itinerary, russell plummer 'traditions thrown to the winds.' In the early days, a 'fly on the wall' ITV documentary series caused considerable interest in the Island Cruises approach. As well as attracting first timers to cruising. Island Escape also had a loyal band of regulars, many making several trips each year to enjoy three restaurants, six bars, three lounges, a casino, nightclub, a good- sized swimming pool and sun decks. Thomson/TUI have owned Island Cruises since 2009 and, after trumpeting the June 2016 debut of Thomson Discovery, currently Splendour of the Seas (1 996/69,1 30gt), in what becomes a single brand five- ship Mediterranean line-up, confirmed that Island Cruises would cease at the end of the 2015 programme, with Island Escape leaving the fleet.

Island Escape was built at Nantes in France as Scandinavia and delivered in August 1982 for an ambitious but spectacularly unsuccessful bid by DFDS offshoot Scandinavian World Cruises to establish a service from New York to the Bahamas with onward connections from Freeport to Fort Lauderdale. As a foreign-flag vessel, the 1,606-berth/530-car Scandinavia could not sail direct from New York to Florida and, although some New York-Bahamas traffic was picked up, Americans could not be persuaded to put to sea with their cars instead of driving south. Sailings were extended to call at Nassau from June 1983, but five months later the plug was pulled and Scandinavia moved across the Atlantic to the DFDS Copenhagen-Oslo route, starting on 19 December 1983. Scandinavia became an instant hit, but with passengers less eager to use her route partner Dana Regina (1 974/1 0,002gt), traffic became unbalanced, and in early April 1984 DFDS sold Scandinavia to Sundance Cruises. The vessel left as Stardancer, after a Flamburg refit by Blohm+Voss, to begin cruises from Vancouver to Skagen in Alaska in June 1985, with winter sailings from Los Angeles to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Sundance Cruises, originally created by Seattle businessman Stanley McDonald with involvement from Silja Line partners Johnson Line of Stockholm and the Finland Steamship Company (EFFOA), was absorbed by Eastern Cruises to form Admiral Cruises in 1987. Two years later it was acquired by RCCL, with Stardancer becoming Viking Serenade. Between January and June 1991, while the ship was at the Southwest Marine yard in San Diego, the stern- loading vehicle decks were converted to cabin areas and the trademark RCCL Viking Crown Lounge was added behind the funnel. Viking Serenade completed over a decade of RCCL service before arriving at the Setubal Yard in Lisbon for refit prior to launching Island Cruises from Majorca in March 2003. There were onboard changes in 2008, when the swimming pool's retractable roof was removed and additional space for sun loungers and a sports area were created at upper deck level. Aft, the 24-hour Beachcomber Restaurant was extended to the full width of the hull and the seating area of the Sailaway Bar on the deck above doubled in size.

The centre of this expansion was and still is North America, which remains by far the largest market, with almost 12 million cruisers in 2013, but the next region of expansion is China, where more and more cruise companies are sending new ships purpose-built for the area. Cruising holidays have been taking place since the latter part of the 19th century, when passenger liners were used in their off season or during slack times between line voyages. It was considered to be a holiday for the more affluent, a perception that continued right through until the modern cruise era. In the mid-1960s several entrepreneurs believed there was a business opportunity to change this perception and provide affordable vacations for a very much wider customer base. They began in four ways: building new cruise ships; converting existing passenger liners into cruise ships; purchasing passenger liners that were already converted into cruise ships; or chartering suitable ships. Many of these companies are the household names of the modern cruise industry, although mergers and ownership changes have inevitably taken place. Princess Cruises’ Stanley Macdonald and Norwegian Caribbean Lines (NCL, now Norwegian Cruise Lines) were the initiators, the former by chartering an off-season ferry in 1965 and the latter starting in 1966 by building Sunwcird, their first ship, followed in 1968 by Star ward and by Skyward in 1969. NCL was followed by Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCCL, now RCl), which built Son^ of Norway^ Nordic Frince and Sun Viking. Meanwhile, three companies joined forces to build three sisterships. Royal Viking Star^ Royal Viking Sky^ and Royal Viking Sca^ and formed Royal Viking Lines. Two more Norwegian companies built two ships to form Flagship cruises. Traditional British shipping companies Cunard and P&O also built new ships, with the former building two and the latter one. Cunard already operated Queen Elizabeth 2 as both a transatlantic liner and a cruise ship.

The ships that could not be converted to cruising were disposed of, and those that could were transferred to cruise operations in either Europe or Australia, but not in North America, apart from Arcadm doing some cruises on the West Coast to Mexico, Alaska and Hawaii and a brief and unsuccessful attempt in 1973 to cruise Canberra out of New York. There were companies that ran older tonnage in the North American market, such as Carnival, Sitmar, Costa, Home lines, Lauro Lines and Chandris. Norwegian American Lines also operated their two new but more traditionally designed ships, Sa^afjord and Vistafjord^ in North America. These early years did not yield satisfactory profits, as evidenced by P&O in 1972 picking up NCL’s half- built fourth ship and completing her as Spirit of London^ and then two years later purchasing the two Norwegian- owned ex-Llagship Cruises sisterships. Island Princess and Sea Venture. One executive at this time stated that a company required at least six ships to financially justify its shoreside administrative staff, and very few cruise companies had six ships. It took another decade and some mergers before companies approached this figure. Most new ships in the 1970s were in the 10,000gt to 20,000gt range and carried around 700 passengers. But the economies of scale required for a satisfactory profit V - required larger ships carrying larger numbers of passengers, something that did not materialise until the late 1980s, 1990s and into the 2000s. The early cruise ships, whether new or old tonnage, had basically the same passenger facilities: a main show lounge; a smaller lounge or lounges; a cinema facility; a disco or late night lounge; a single dining room; a slot machine area or a small casino. www.shipsmonthly.com • February 2016 • 23 The iconic Queen Elizabeth 2 arriving in Southampton.

She cruised until the end of 1974 and in 1975 went to scrap in Taiwan. although some had no casino; maybe a small room with exercise equipment; a sauna, with adjacent massage rooms; and a hair dressing salon. Of the newbuilds, the Royal Viking ships were considered the most upmarket. Entertainment was provided by a small cruise staff, a five- piece band, a musical trio, a male singer, a female singer and a comedian. This was the basic set-up, but there could be an additional duo or a magic act. They may all have come together for a production based on a Broadway or West End show. Eood was a major feature and advertised extensively to attract passengers. It was often described as gourmet standard, and although that may have been an exaggeration, it was very good. The modern self- service buffets and speciality restaurants were unheard of Italian chefs, service and cuisine were used by many of the lines. The pizza cafes in Sitmar’s ships were widely acclaimed. The now defunct midnight buffet was ubiquitous, with each company trying to outdo the others in their offerings. Even the nationality of the ships’ officers was used to try to entice passengers. The British- operated ships boasted of their British officers, while the Norwegian companies touted their Norwegian officers, and the same went for the Italian- and Greek-manned ships. The British ships followed their passenger liner tradition of officers hosting passenger tables at dinner. Norwegian, Italian and Greek ships had their own hosting arrangements, which were equally popular. The competing companies also focused on particular marketing and cruising areas: NCL, RCI, Carnival and Costa targeted the US East Coast for passengers to the Caribbean; Sitmar, Holland America Line (HAL) and Princess Cruises focused on the US West Coast, with cruising to Mexico and Alaska, with the latter operating Panama Canal cruises and a one-ship seasonal operation based in the Caribbean. Cunard operated their ships in the Caribbean as well as Alaska. Royal Viking Line’s three ships undertook longer worldwide cruises. Itineraries and ports were a major factor; for example, it was important for Caribbean- based ships to call at St Thomas in the US Virgin Islands, and an itinerary that did not call there was at a disadvantage in attracting prospective passengers. Ports of call Ports also needed to improve their facilities to attract the cruise ships, which provided significant extra income. Berthing space was at a premium, particularly in more popular ports, while anchoring was a necessary but unpopular alternative. Most ports would allow the pre- booking of berths, so it was important for companies to prepare their itineraries well in advance in order to book a berth. Some ports worked on a first come first serve basis, such as Puerto Vallarta on the west coast of Mexico, where ships raced to get to the pilot station first and secure the only berth, leaving the loser at anchor. On a Saturday, the most popular day for seven-day cruises to start, the terminal ports had to arrange a strict arrival schedule, with ships in line astern as they embarked their pilots. With more ships entering the market, companies searched for new destinations, preferably exclusive ones, to attract passengers, starting 24 * February 2016 • www.shipsmonthly.com SHIPS CLOCK SHOP Days of the Week Clock £55.00 P&P £6.75 UK Time & Tide Clock £67.75 P&P £6.75 UK 24 Hour Clock £55.00 P&P £6.75 UK Signal Flag Clock. £55.00 P&P £6.75 UK The dimension of all the above clocks are 6.26 inches diameter overall, 5 inch dial, supplied mounted on mahogany plinth 7.8 inches square.

Royal Caribbean set up an exclusive call in Haiti, while Princess Cruises made an exclusive arrangement with a small privately-owned island in the Grenadines. Officially charted as Prune Island, for marketing purposes the name was changed to Palm Island. Other companies followed suit with their own exclusive places. The scenic grandeur of Alaska was an untapped market, and Holland America Lines, Princess Cruises and Sitmar Cruises focused on it. The Alaskan ports had basic facilities, so the ships berthed either at wooden jetties or anchored, but the scenery was magnificent, particularly the US National Park of Glacier Bay. With only a few ships cruising in Alaska, permits for Glacier Bay entry were available. Ships cruised in a leisurely manner through the National Park all day, and lifeboats were often lowered to pick up small pieces of floating glacial ice, to be exhibited outside the restaurant. Nowadays, with many more ships calling, permits are strictly limited, as is time spent in the bay, and calls are tightly regulated. Meanwhile, apart from the North American market, there were still niche cruising operations in Europe and Australia. P&O operated its educational cruises out of the UK, using Nevasa and while Andes offered traditional cruises for the UK market. Andes epitomised the perception of cruising being for the affluent, which it was, with service to match and a staff to passenger ratio of almost one to one. Unfortunately, but perhaps unsurprisingly, there were insufficient passengers to maintain this financially, and in the early 1970s she was withdrawn from service. Throughout the 1970s it was only P&O Princess of the major companies that met the six-ship rule of thumb criteria. Sitmar Cruises came close, but most cruise lines’ profits were small. As more people took to cruising, they also wanted more for their money, whether it was entertainment, catering or other facilities.

The newly-named Norway also carried about two or three times the number of passengers of other cruise ships. P&O Cruises’ Canberra carried a large number of passengers, but the cabins, many of which did not have private facilities and some with four berths (‘friendly fours’), were not well suited for the competitive North American market. However, Canberra did bring cruising to a new generation of Britons. In the half century since Stanley Macdonald started Princess Cruises with a chartered ferry, and Knut Kloster and Ted Arison founded Norwegian Caribbean Lines, both the ships and the companies have grown, from Sunward - 8,666gt, carrying 700 passengers - to Royal Caribbean’s Allure of the Seas, which is 225,000gt and carries 5,400 passengers. Many of the original companies are still operating, notably NCL, RCI and Carnival, while others have gone by the wayside. Carnival is the biggest, with over 100 cruise ships under its various brands, which include HAL, Princess Cruises, Cunard, Costa and P&O Cruises. Q3 caused what was colloquially called ‘crew creep’. Additional facilities required more crew, but the ships were built with a business plan for a certain product, with specified crew and passenger numbers. Additional crew had to be accommodated in what were originally passenger cabins, and of course more crew meant fewer passengers and thus lower profits. Royal Viking Lines’ and Royal Caribbean Cruises’ Wartsila- built ships readily adapted to being ‘stretched’, with the addition of a midship section, adding more accommodation and passenger areas. France to Norway Once again it was NCL that made a bold move in 1979, when the company bought the laid-up French transatlantic liner Franee. Converting the liner for cruising addressed the economies of scale in the North American market: she was large enough to accommodate major theatre shows and all the staff required for them, as well as the other facilities that cruise passengers wanted, and it started the trend of the ship itself being the destination.

On land, scrubbers have been widely used in electricity generation and other industries for a number of years, but the transition to marine use has been less successful due to the size of the units needed. Scrubbers work by removing the sulphur content from the emissions, as well as helping to reduce nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. This can be undertaken in two basic ways: either through washing with seawater (wet) or by using lime (dry). This is undertaken after combustion, taking the exhaust gas before it enters the atmosphere through the funnel. The first generation systems were large, and required extra emissions from ships New emission reguiations mean owners and operators have to reduce exhaust gases produced by ships. One answer is to fit scrubbers, as Krispen Atkinson expiains. S ince 1 January 2015 ships operating in Northern European waters and around the coast of North America have been required to comply with vigorous emission rules. These rules have left shipowners with three basic options: burn fuel with less sulphur content, use a cleaner fuel such as LNG, or find a way of cleaning the exhaust gases before they enter the atmosphere. The third option means fitting SOx abatement systems, more commonly known in the industry as ‘scrubbers’. Although probably not aesthetically pleasing, they are purposeful. Shipowners began partnering with system providers, using experimental systems which would lead to full installations. These began with partial conversions, retrofitting the scrubber to a smaller piece of machinery, such as an auxiliary generator. This occurred on vessels such as P&O’s Dover to Calais ferry Fride of Kent and Holland Ficaria Seaways was the first ship in the dfds fieet to be fitted with scrubbers, and the company has since invested heaviiy in the technoiogy. d u: if / 28 * February 2016 • www.shipsmonthly.com ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY Steelwork to enclose them. This meant that some ships have had to undergo major alterations to their funnels to incorporate the installations. But as the technology has developed, newer, more compact scrubbers have come on the market, which do not require such drastic alterations to the funnel and surrounding area. Open and closed loops Open loop scrubbers operate by taking seawater, and washing the exhaust gases. The waste water is discharged into the sea, where the acidic nature of sulphur is neutralised by the alkalinity of the seawater. With ongoing environmental concerns, some scrubber manufacturers are now providing systems which clean the waste water before it leaves the ship, with the sludge waste removed in port and disposed of safely onshore. Closed loop scrubbers see only bleed water leave the ship. The system uses caustic soda to neutralise the sulphur within the exhaust gas, with the waste stored on the ship until it can be disposed of. This type of scrubber is advantageous in waters where the alkalinity levels are low, and therefore cannot be used to neutralise the sulphur. This is the case in the Baltic and in river estuaries. Another form, but not as popular as the wet systems, is the dry system. Using lime granules, the exhaust gas passes through the lime, which absorbs the sulphur. This system is quite large, requiring storing of both reserve granules, which are placed in the system via a hopper, and the waste material. The waste material from this system can be used as an agricultural fertiliser or as gypsum. A commonly utilised system is the hybrid scrubber. This is a The mam unit of the scrubber is fitted inside the extended funnei of one of DFDS'S Fiower ciass ro-ros. DFDS Scrubbers in widespread use By the end of 2015 180 ships had been fitted with scrubbers, with many more pianned. The capitai outiay for a shipowner on a scrubber is in the region of $2-3 miiiion per vessei, depending on the engine size. For ferries and cruise ships, this can be upwards of $10 miiiion, due to the size of the engine instaiiation. There is aiso the time out of service to consider, as instaiiations take around four weeks to compiete, aithough they are often pianned around a scheduied dry-docking. But these factors have not deterred owners from taking up the option or retrofitting scrubbers, with vesseis spending most of their time inside the Emission Controi Area (EGA) being prime candidates, and they are abie to take advantage of cheaper fuei with higher suiphur content. ABOVE Clearly showing the widened funnel, which incorporates the scrubber, Containership VI heads for Rotterdam on the service from the Baltic. form, where the alkalinity level is suitable, but can switch to closed loop in waters which are either low in alkalinity, or where environmental regulations prevent the discharge of waste water into the sea. Scrubbers in service DFDS have spent a considerable amount on retrofitting their fleet with scrubbers. Being a European operator, the ships generally spend all their time within the EGA. Tor Ficaria (later Ficaria Senwoiys) became the first vessel in the fleet fitted with a scrubber, while she was being lengthened in Bremerhaven in July 2009. She used a system developed by Aalborg Industries, later to be known as Alfa-Laval Aalborg, and at the time it was the largest marine installation. DEDS were impressed with the results, and retrofits soon followed on Ficaria^s sisters as well as other members of the company’s fleet, the conversions being undertaken in Poland. www.shipsmonthly.com • February 2016 • 29 4 lEiomsAwm w , S I I ^ ^ I 1 1 irmii i|[[|r r DFDS SEAWAYS rrmrirf i r- ABOVE The ro-ro cargo ship Plyca (28,289gt) was the first of Transfennica's six container ro-ros to be fitted with scrubbers, by widening the funnei.
