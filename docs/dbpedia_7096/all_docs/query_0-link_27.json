        "text": "MV Adriana\n\nAdriana is a small cruise ship operating tours around the Mediterranean. She was built as ‘Aquarius’ in 1972 for Hellenic Mediterranean Line and served for many years before being sold for scrap in 2019.\n\nMV ADRIANA’S PAGE IS COMING SOON BUT PRINTS ARE NOW AVAILABLE\n\nSS AMERICA\n\nDesigned by acclaimed naval architect William Francis Gibbs, the SS America was, at the time of her introduction in 1939, one of the most modern and forward-thinking liners afloat.\n\nSS AMERIKANIS\n\nOriginally launches as SS Kenya Castle, Amerikanis was one of Chandris’ ever-popular cruisers. Amerikanis was a regular sight in hundreds of ports from New York to Bergen. After a lengthy career she was finally laid-up in 1996 and scrapped in 2000.\n\nM/s Aurelia\n\nOriginally serving as a German cargo vessel during the Second World War, Aurelia was rebuilt by Italy’s COGEDAR line and served as a reliable immigrant liner between Europe and Australia.\n\nM/N Australia\n\nAustralia was the first of three sisters ships commissioned and built to capitalise on the growing post-war migrant trade to Australia for Italy’s Lloyd Triestino line. These virtually identical sisters were the first ships built post-war for the Italian line and were a remarkable step forward in modernising the fleet.\n\nRHMS AUSTRALIS\n\nSS Australis - formerly the SS America - is a ship with a legendary career and one fondly remembered by thousands. Over her extraordinary fifty-year-long career she served as an ocean liner, troop transport and cruise ship.\n\nSS Begoña\n\nOriginally ‘SS Vassar Victory’, a cargo vessel serving through World War Two (and later serving as Sitmar Lines’ ‘SS Castel Bianco’), Begoña earned a name for herself in peacetime after an important voyage to Australia from Greece in 1957 - bringing a shipload of brides to the country.\n\nSS Begoña’s PAGE IS COMING SOON BUT PRINTS ARE NOW AVAILABLE\n\nSS BRITANIS\n\nBritanis started life at Matson Lines’ ‘Monterey’, and Chandris added her to their fleet well after her sister Ellinis. Britanis began her career for Chandris on the immigrant run before converting to full-time cruise duties well into the 1990s.\n\nRMS Carpathia, one of Cunard's utilitarian combination cargo-passenger steamers from the turn of the last century. Most famous for rushing to the rescue of RMS Titanic in April 1912.\n\ntSS CANTON\n\nCanton operated a lucrative service between Britain and Hong Kong for many years earning the little liner a fond place in the hearts of many former passengers and crew.\n\nss cephée\n\nCephée began life as a German combination vessel carrying both cargo and passengers before being awarded to France’s Messageries Maritimes line as war reparations after 1918. She served in this configuration as an immigrant vessel carrying many families fleeing the beleaguered European continent to Australia in the 1920s.\n\nss cephéE’S PAGE IS COMING SOON BUT PRINTS ARE NOW AVAILABLE\n\nTSS CHUSAN\n\nChusan was one of a new generation of liners built for P&O after the Second World War. Introduced in 1950 for the Line’s Far East route, she would go on to have a stellar career and came to be known as “the Happy Ship”.\n\nt/n GALILEO GALILEI\n\nGalileo Galilei, along with her sister Guglielmo Marconi, was like a space-age leap for Lloyd-Triestino when the pair were introduced in the mid-1960s. Initially operating the Italy-Australia run, the two sister ships had long careers and, like so many others, became popular cruise ships in the later part of the century.\n\nt/n guglielmo marconi\n\nThe second of two famous and stylish sister ships, Marconi served only a relatively short 15-year career with Lloyd Triestino before begin sold and converted to full-time cruise ship with Costa Cruises. Renamed ‘Costa Riviera’, she was finally laid-up and scrapped in 2001.\n\nT/N GUGLIELMO MARCONI’s page is coming soon but prints are now available\n\nss kronprinzessin cecilie\n\nThe last of the ‘Four Flyers’ and the final German ship to carry four funnels, Kronprinzessin Cecilie had a relatively brief career as a transatlantic liner before world events were to outrun her. Captured by the forces of the United States, Cecilie was re-named ‘USS Mount Vernon’ and put to work as a troop transport before being indefinitely mothballed.\n\nrms mooltan\n\nMooltan and her sister Maloja were constructed just after the First World War and went on to capitalise on the growing ‘Tourist’ market of the 20s and 30s. The vessels made frequent voyages between Australia and Britain after serving as troopships in the Second World War, taking part in the ‘Ten-Pound Pom’ scheme in the 1950s.\n\nm/n neptunia\n\n‘Neptunia’ was one of three sisters ships commissioned and built to capitalise on the growing post-war migrant trade to Australia for Italy’s Lloyd Triestino line. These virtually identical sisters were the first ships built post-war for the Italian line and were a remarkable step forward in modernising the fleet.\n\nM/N NEPTUNIA’s page is coming soon but prints are now available\n\nMS NELLY\n\nNelly was originally a C3 cargo vessel ‘Mormacmail’ before conversion to an aircraft carrier for the United States Navy in World War Two. As ‘Nelly’ the ship operated regular services from Europe to Australia and brought many migrant families - she was the first vessel to carry German migrants to Australia. She was eventually renamed ‘Seven Seas’ and served as a popular cruise ship.\n\nMS NELLY’s page is coming soon but prints are now available\n\nSS NEW AUSTRALIA\n\nThis vessel was originally launched as the ‘Monarch of Bermuda’ and was a popular liner to that nation until she was gutted by a fire. The hulk was purhcased and rebuilt into the ‘New Australia’, operated by the Shaw-Savill Line until the late 1950s, playing a major role in the ‘Ten Pound Pom’ scheme. After this she was sold to the Greek line and renamed ‘Arkadia’.\n\nSS NEW AUSTRALIa’s page is coming soon but prints are now available\n\nMS Oceania\n\n‘Oceania’ was one of three sisters ships commissioned and built to capitalise on the growing post-war migrant trade to Australia for Italy’s Lloyd Triestino line. These virtually identical sisters were the first ships built post-war for the Italian line and were a remarkable step forward in modernising the fleet.\n\nMS OCEANIa’s page is coming soon but prints are now available\n\nRMS OLYMPIC\n\nThe first of what was planned to be a major trio of luxurious liners, Olympic went on to have one of the most legendary careers of any passenger ship.\n\nRMS PRETORIA CASTLE\n\nPretoria Castle was one of Union Castle Lines’ sleek vessels operating regular services between Britain and South Africa. She was built by the famed shipyard Harland and Wolff in 1947 and had a 19-year long career with her original owners.\n\nRMS PRETORIA CASTLE’s page is coming soon but prints are now available\n\nrms queen mary\n\nOne of the most famous ocean liners of all time and the first of Cunard’s ships to bear the ‘Queen’ prefix, today she is thankfully preserved for the public to visit.\n\nM/V Romanza\n\nCOGEDAR Lines’ ‘Aurelia’ was sold to Chandris Lines and converted into a cruise ship. In this configuration the plucky little vessel ran regular Mediterranean cruises into the 1990s before being scrapped after a fire.\n\nSS Strathaird\n\nStrathaird was one of the first two original ‘White Sisters’ along with Strathnaver. The vessel had a successful career spanning decades, being a popular liner and cruise ship in the 1930s before serving in the War as a troopship. Post-war she was modernised and resumed services between Australia and Britain.\n\nTSS STRATHAIRd’s page is coming soon but prints are now available\n\nSS Stratheden\n\nOne of P&O’s most successful immigrant liners of the 50s and 60s, Stratheden was the largest of her running mates at the time.\n\ntSS STRATHNAVER\n\nStrathnaver was one of the first two original ‘White Sisters’ along with Strathaird. The vessel had a successful career spanning decades, being a popular liner and cruise ship in the 1930s before serving in the War as a troopship. Post-war she was modernised and resumed services between Australia and Britain.\n\ncan’t find what you want?\n\nThe Liner Designs fleet is always growing in size.
