Noonsite endeavors to keep abreast of all new developments, however, if you encounter something different to the guidelines outlined below, please post a comment with your experience.\n\nPRE-ARRIVAL\n\nImmigration:\n\nImmigration have a pre-arrival form that all visitors must complete in advance: https://apps.migracioncolombia.gov.co/pre-registro/en. However, in 2024 the maritime tick box is not active, therefore this can only be completed if arriving by air. Do check prior to departure for Colombia, in case the maritime tick box has now become active, in which case it should be completed.\n\nBe sure to check if you or any of your crew need a visa to enter the country, which must be obtained in advance. See the Immigration section for more details.\n\nOutward Clearance Document from your Last Port:\n\nA “Zarpe” (outward clearance document) from the previous country/port is required in order to clear into Colombia. Not having one could result in costly legal action as well as having clearance into Colombia rejected. Those leaving US ports for Colombia (where departing international clearance documents may not be required) should take particular note (see the departure section in US formalities for details on how to get a Zarpe).\n\nThere are multiple types of “Zarpe” depending on your next destination (regional vs. national vs. international departure documents). Make sure this is specified and don’t divert from the plan once underway (excepting emergencies).\n\nMaritime Agencies:\n\nAn approved agent is required for clearing into and out of Colombia when dealing with the Port Captain. This is because they do not deal directly with yacht crew.\n\nWhile neither the Oficina de Migracion (Immigration) nor DIAN (Customs) requires an agent as an intermediary, you would probably do better to leave the entire clearance process to your agent especially if you do not speak very good Spanish. The process can appear daunting with all the paperwork in Spanish.\n\nIt is a good idea to contact several agents before arrival to ensure clearance charges are made clear together with other services on offer. The charges from one agency to another can vary significantly. There is no need to appoint an agent prior to arrival if you don’t want to, however you will need to name an agent as you enter your port of entry. The agency can be changed on arrival no problem as long as it does not delay entry procedures.\n\nThe agent will need all crew passports, vessel registration and the zarpe from your last port of call specifying your port of entry in Colombia.\n\nClub de Pesca Marina in Cartagena , Marina Santa Marta and Marina Puerto Velero in Barranquilla, work with their own agents or act as agents for their customers to avoid abuse and over charging by agents.\n\nRecreational vessels of 150 tons or more should certainly contact an agent in advance since special entry rules may be applicable.\n\nThe agent will contact DIMAR to give them Notice of Arrival for your vessel.\n\nFor more about agents see Clearance Agents.\n\nAnchoring in Colombia before clearing-in:\n\nOn the way to Santa Marta from Aruba, it is no longer possible to anchor along the Colombian coast prior to clearing into Colombia. Five Bays and the Tayrona Park are now open to cruisers, however, a permit is required and there are associated fees, all easily acquired via an agent (see restrictions for further details). It is common practice for vessels arriving from Panama to make a day/night stop at the San Bernardo and Rosario islands (also occasionally Isla Fuerte). For those making the passage to Cartagena in daylight, this is the only option and it is doubtful the authorities would object.\n\nColombia Navy:\n\nIt’s highly likely as you approach the coast of Colombia you will be intercepted by the Colombia Navy who will want to come on board and see your papers and inspect the boat for drugs.\n\nARRIVAL FORMALITIES\n\nGeneral Process:\n\nOn arrival in Colombia, yachts must go to the nearest Port of Entry, with the Q and courtesy flags flying. Be sure that the Colombian port of entry you have stated on your Zarpe, is the one you are clearing in at. Officials will be very suspicious as to why you have gone somewhere else than what was on your paperwork.\n\nSee Documents for a list of all the paperwork required for clearance.\n\nAll the below authorities must be dealt with, however, your agent will manage everything and advise you of where you need to be and when.\n\nDistrict Health: Will require all crew members to complete a Maritime Health Declaration. No Covid paperwork is required, except in Santa Marta where Covid vaccination certificates must be presented for all crew.\n\nICA: Will want to see a list of provisions.\n\nPort Captain’s Office: Visiting yachts must clear in with the Port Captain via an agent who is authorized to deal with the Port Captain. He will issue the “Acta de Visita” (entry permit issued on arrival).\n\nMigracion Office: Immigration will issue visas and in almost all cases a 90-day visa will be issued. See the Immigration section for more details.\n\nIf staying for approx. one week, the above 2 steps are all that is necessary. However, if staying more than a week or hauling out your vessel, the following extra steps need to be taken:\n\nDIAN/Customs: Go with your Acta de Visita, port entry clearance and visas to obtain a Temporary Importation Permit (TIP) valid for 1 year with a possibility to extend a further year. Application for the TIP must be made within 4 days from your first arrival in Colombia. The actual process may take several days but the application must be made on time. The clock starts from first arrival. It does not stop while you are sailing between ports! Be sure to check with your agent if moving on to another port that import papers can be finalized in your next port of call. There is no charge for the TIP.\n\nPort Captain’s Office: Once the TIP is issued go to see the Port Captain (again via the Maritime Agency) to get a Certificado de Permanencia (Cruising Permit) valid for 1 year and extendable to the limit of the TIP.\n\nBoth the TIP and Cruising Permit are valid for all of Colombia. See Documents for more details.\n\nInternational clearance can take between 5-7 days in some Colombian ports and it can be slow and frustrating having to wait for your paperwork to be in order. Immigration and Port Captain must issue their paperwork first and visas before Customs can be visited to arrange for the TIP and finally the cruising permit. If planning a haul out, call the agent and yard in advance to expedite temporary import.\n\nLocal authorities and service providers have been discussing procedures to both ease procedures and reduce the costs of clearing into the country. Some progress has been made in extending the period of the initial cruising permit to 1 year, but much remains the same.\n\nSee Fees for details of clearance charges.\n\nDomestic Cruising:\n\nIn Colombia, the yacht must clear in and out between major ports (i.e. separate port authorities such as Santa Marta & Cartagena).\n\nAn outward clearance (Zarpe) is required to proceed to the next port. Except when extensions are needed, Customs and Immigration formalities are completed only in the first and last ports visited. Skippers must clear in with the Port Captain in each port (via an agent who is authorized to deal with the Port Captain).\n\nCLEARING OUT\n\nFor both domestic and international clearance, agents will need 48 hours notice at least.\n\nWhen leaving the marina report on both VHF Ch. 72 (dock staff) and VHF Ch. 16 (Maritime Authorities).\n\nIt is important to report all vessel movement within Santa Marta to the authorities.\n\nDomestic Clearance:\n\nRemember that if moving to a port in a new port authority, you will need to use an agent again to complete the port arrival procedures. Most agents charge the full suite of services to clear in and out upfront. It is important that the Zarpe lists your next port of call – as stopping at a port not listed (or missing out on one) can cause severe difficulties.\n\nIn Cartagena from mid-December 2021 DIMAR require that SITMAR (https://appn.dimar.mil.co/Sitmar/) be used to submit float plans for local navigation (i.e. to visit Cholon or the Rosario Islands). These destinations previously did not require a zarpe to visit. This will also require the use of an agent. See Cartagena for more details.\n\nInternational Clearance:\n\nClearing out of Colombia can take at least 24 hours. When you decide to leave, you must contact your agent to get the clearance to sail out of Colombia. You should request the Zarpe 2 days before leaving. An exit stamp in all passports from the Migracion office must be obtained on departure.\n\nWhen you leave Colombia you can anchor off the coast or islands en route to your next destination providing that you do not go ashore.\n\nFloat Plan:\n\nIn order to improve the security for yachts cruising this coast, the Port Captains ask that a voluntary float plan is lodged with the Captain when a Zarpe is issued, by email to navesmcp05@dimar.mil.co. A form for this is included in the Cartagena Guide for Cruisers.\n\nLast updated: November 2023\n\nIf you have information for this section, or feedback on businesses used, please let us know at editor@noonsite.com.
