        "text": "“The White Arrow”, “The Dove of the Orient”, “The Ship of Maharajahs”... these were some of the epithets which were given to the motorship Victoria of the Lloyd Triestino. At the end of the 'Twenties, the company's technical office was faced with a complex but obvious problem: the design of a new liner which would replace the two already obsolete vessels Helouan and Vienna, born before the First World War which, with the exception of those wartime years, had served with dignity on the express route between Italy and Alexandria in Egypt.\n\nThe higher speeds obtainable with the latest generation of propulsion machinery, the competition posed by the Società Italiana di Servizi Marittimi (SITMAR) of Genoa which was running its two most recent steamships, Esperia and Ausonia, on the same route, a worrying contraction in traffic and, finally, the restructuring of the Lloyd Triestino by Lloyd Sabaudo, persuaded the company to order just a single ship; the possibility of a sister ship would have to wait for more favourable economic times. Following a favourable experience with some diesel-driven combi-ships, it was decided that the new flagship should be a motor vessel: four powerful Sulzer diesels, built at the famous Fabbrica Macchine Sant'Andrea of Trieste, were connected directly to the same number of propellers with the intention of giving the ship a service speed of 20 knots.\n\nThe Victoria (a name chosen after consideration had been given to Alessandrina and Cleopatra) was also one of the very first passenger ships in the World built to the new standards of Safety of Life At Sea (SOLAS 1929); in addition to a cellular double bottom which extended from the fore to the stern peak, she was divided into eleven watertight compartments with the engine room in the middle section and the forward and aft sections devoted to cargo. There was also a garage for cars accessible over a ramp connected to the quay. Despite being much smaller than the great transatlantic liners, the Victoria attracted international attention for several reasons: apart from her speed, she had a particularly graceful and streamlined appearance, her interiors were in the Modern style and the first class main lounge was fitted with air-conditioning: she was indeed the first passenger ship in the World to have this amenity thanks to a plant designed by the Carrier company of America and built in England.\n\nFor more information please visit www.italianliners.com/victoria-en\n\nThe ship was the property of Lloyd Triestino, originally founded as Österreichischer Lloyd, which is a shipping company with its head office in Trieste, Italy, and run by Evergreen Marine Corporation.\n\nIt was founded as \"Österreichischer Lloyd\" (or \"Austrian Lloyd\") in 1836 and became one of the world's biggest shipping companies by managing most oversea trade and passenger travel of Austria-Hungary until 1918. The Austrian Lloyd was running regular services from Trieste to the Near East, India, China and the Far East, Brazil, the USA and Northern Europe. It also was one of the first to use steam ships.\n\nThe company's name was changed to \"Lloyd Triestino\" in 1919, when Trieste became a part of Italy. At this time, the company also faced major restructuring in order to recover losses incurred during World War I. By the end of the 1930s, Lloyd Triestino, with its offshoot Marittima Italiana, was once again a major world shipping power, owning a fleet of 85 vessels with 17 services to east Africa, southern Africa, Asia, and Australia.[2] The company was once again crippled by the devastation of World War II in the 1940s. During the War, Lloyd Triestino lost 68 ships and 1,000 sailors. At the end, they were reduced to a fleet of just 5 ships and were once again faced with a massive recovery operation. By 1956, the Lloyd Triestino fleet had grown to 31 ships.\n\nLloyd Triestino entered into a partnership with Taiwanese shipping giant, Evergreen Marine, Corp., in 1993.[3] This successful partnership has grown over the years, and now also includes Evergreen's British based line, Hatsu Marine Ltd., which was created in 2000.\n\nOn March 1, 2006, Lloyd Triestino's name officially changed to Italia Marittima. Ship names are gradually being changed from the prefix \"LT\" to \"Ital\" to reflect this change (e.g. LT Cortesia and Ital Contessa).\n\nFor further information please visit en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italia_Marittima and www.italianliners.com/lloyd-triestino-en\n\nThis painting was just one of many fascinating exhibits at a special exhibition titled “Lloyd. Trieste and its Ships round the World\" which we visited back in April this year.

To transport service personnel between Britain and the Empire, a fleet of troopships was managed by British shipping companies on behalf of the Ministry of Transport. Many of these troop transports were ageing German war prizes, whilst the remainder were pre-war British vessels.\n\nIn 1952 the British Government entered into an agreement with the British India Steam Navigation Company and the Bibby Line to replace and supplement these vessels. Each company would build a ship specifically for the transport of troops and their families. The first ship to enter service was British India's Nevasa. The Oxfordshire, built for the Bibby Line, began her career on 13 February 1957.\n\nThe Oxfordshire had accommodation for 1,000 troops and 500 dependents. The cabin accommodation could be divided into three classes when fare-paying passengers were carried. The troop accommodation was superior to that of any previous British troopship, with three-tiered bunks replacing hammocks and much greater space for exercise and recreation. Given that it was intended that the Oxfordshire would spend much time in the Far East, special attention was paid to the ventilation system, although only the hospital spaces were actually air-conditioned.\n\nOn her completion for the Bibby Line, she was placed on a 20-year charter to the Ministry of Transport. In 1962, after a mere five years' duty, her trooping career came to an abrupt end. The British Government decided that all future troop movements would be made by air. The contract with the Bibby Line was prematurely cancelled, and she carried her last troops from Malta to Southampton in December 1962. She was laid up in the River Fal, and the Bibby Line advertised her for charter or for sale.\n\nIn May 1963 the Sitmar Line took her on a six-year charter with an option to purchase, and the almost new liner was placed on the UK-Australia service for assisted-passage migrants. She was refitted at the Wilton-Fijenoord N.V. shipyard in Holland for £2.3 million and was renamed Fairstar. In March 1964, Sitmar purchased the ship outright from the Bibby Line. This was to overcome the stipulation in the charter party which stated that British officers and Indian seamen must crew the ship during the term of the charter.\n\nShe made four return voyages each year via the Suez Canal, carrying 1,868 passengers, all in one class. She had a crew of 460, and full air-conditioning had been installed. With the closure of the Suez Canal in 1967, the Fairstar made her southbound voyage via the Cape of Good Hope, returning to the UK via the Panama Canal.\n\nEvery five years the Australian Government put the contract for the carriage of British migrants out to tender. Sitmar had held the contract since 1955, but in 1970 the Chandris Line was successful. At a stroke Fairstar had lost the bulk of her southbound passengers. Worse still, on the assumption that it would retain the contract, Sitmar had just purchased Cunard's redundant Carinthia and Sylvania to add to capacity on the Australian migrant trade.\n\nInitially Fairstar remained on her regular route from the UK to Australia carrying fare-paying passengers, but from September 1973 she was switched to full-time cruising from Australia with restricted passenger numbers of 1,280.\n\nIn the 1990s, now operated by P&O, Fairstar suffered from increasing mechanical problems brought on by her advancing years, but she consistently retained her position as the most successful cruise ship operating from Australia.\n\nIn April 1996 it became clear that large sums of money would need to be spent on her engines if she were to remain in service, and there would be further expense in bringing the old ship up to the standards required by new SOLAS regulations. P&O therefore reluctantly decided to retire her on 31 January 1997.\n\nShe is seen here in Southampton, tied up adjacent to Mayflower Park.
