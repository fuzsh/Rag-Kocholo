I know we are looking forward to cruising with our family and friends. Important facts to remember:\n\nPassports: Please verify all information on your passport for our cruise, October 22, 2016. Check that the name on your invoice matches the name on your passport. This must match the ship’s manifest.\n\nInvoices: Check all information is correct and current. Verify the cabin type you requested and invoice charges.\n\nCabin Assignments: Royal Caribbean has set a date of June 1, 2016 for every cabin to have paid their $500.00 deposit.

If you have special diets, food allergies, gluten free, sugar free, walkers, wheel chairs or assistance needed.\n\nTravel Insurance: Insurance is not required, but some cruisers have asked about it. There are a number of companies that offer insurance. For many years Sherry and I have gone with CSA Travel Protection. For us, they have gotten a little pricey. This year we went with Royal Caribbean. Call me and we’ll discuss.\n\nWe’re looking at getting better hotel rates for those wishing to fly in on Friday and maybe a pre cruise dinner. I need to know who is interested in order to make room requests. We’ve had good luck with Holiday Inn Express and have used them on numerous occasions.\n\nIt’s easier to make corrections and changes early instead of the last minute when trying to board the ship.\n\nSherry and I will do everything we can to make this an enjoyable experience and we are really looking forward to cruising with our church family and friends.\n\nSherry &"
