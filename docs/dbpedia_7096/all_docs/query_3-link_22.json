        "text": "<strong>TEN</strong> <strong>POUND</strong> <strong>AUSSIES</strong> <strong>By</strong> <strong>Stephen</strong> <strong>Yarrow</strong>. ©<strong>Stephen</strong> <strong>Yarrow</strong>, <strong>2005</strong> Chapter 14: Ships of the Lines Commencing with the First fleet in 1788, there was a steady stream of ships bringing migrants predominantly from Europe to Australia until the 1970s, the flow of which was interrupted only by the two world wars. <strong>By</strong> the 1970s, the Boeing 747 aircraft or Jumbo Jet as it was affectionately known, had so revolutionised intercontinental travel, much of the travelling public had abandoned ocean liners for any kind of travel except recreational cruising. The Australian Government, which was still subsidising most fares of migrants coming to Australia, had been the shipping lines' biggest customer. But when airfares became cheaper than sea travel, it began bringing migrants to Australia by air. As its charter contracts with the shipping companies expired, they were not being renewed. This fall off in business, combined with a jump in fuel prices caused by the oil crisis of the early 1970s, forced the shipping lines servicing the Australian migrant runs to have a major rethink about how they did business, and embark on radical restructuring and rationalisation to avoid bankruptcy. Two operators, Lloyd Triestino and Shaw, Savill & Albion, along with Matson lines whose vessels serviced the trans Pacific Ocean run, actually withdrew from the passenger ship business altogether, selling off their liners and focusing on other areas of activity. Others, like P&O and the Orient Line who had already merged in the early 1960s to stay competitive, sent all their older ships to the scrap yard and retained just a handful of newer vessels to maintain and develop their cruising business. The era of migrant sea travel to Australia from Europe finally came to a close in 1977 when Chandris Line's migrant charter expired. The line's Australis made its last voyage on the Southampton-Piraeus-Australia migrant run in October 1977, bringing to a close a 189-year era in Australia's history. The vessels listed here were the main carriers of migrants to Australia during the post-World War II boom period from the 1950s to the withdrawal of migrant passenger ships in 1978 and the total withdrawal of the assisted passage migrant scheme three years later. Other vessels were used from time to time (they are listed at the end of this section), but it is mainly the names of these ships that are recalled when families and friends get together and reminisce about that life-changing voyage across the world that brought them to a new life in Australia during the post-war years. ORIENT LINE The Orient Line, along with the Peninsula and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, were the two British based shipping lines that pioneered and dominated the passage of migrants by sea to Australia and other colonial outposts in the Orient, such as India, Malaysia and Hong Kong since the 1850s. In May 1960, the Orient Line was integrated into the P & O Orient! ! Line. RMS Orontes (1929 - 1962)"
