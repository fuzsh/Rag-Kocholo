Pier 80 is one of the Port’s largest, busiest and most versatile terminals. It was built in 1967 to handle container as well as breakbulk cargoes. Then, In 1976 it underwent a $7 million remodeling to increase its container capabilities and to add facilities for accommodating roll-on/ roll-off cargo. “Now, Pier 80 is one of the most ver- satile piers on the entire West Coast,” says Jack Dant, president of States Steamship Company. Located at the foot of Army Street and Marin Street on the north side of Islais Creek, Pier 80 has over 5,000 feet of berthing space and can handle seven vessels at one time. All berths are acces- sible by rail with double trackage running the entire perimeter. The giant pier has the facilities to load, iunload, handle and store diverse cargoes. Two rail-mounted container cranes freely circle the terminal for ac- cess to any berth. Storage consists of four transit sheds, totaling nearly 700,000 square feet, with dear-span for easy load- ing or unloading of breakbulk, plus 68.5 acres of open space for storing cargo such as machinery, lumber and steel. Re- frigeration outlets for containerized cargo provide additional storage capabilities. Cargo can also be serviced by the Container Freight Station (CFS) located on the pier. CFS allows cargo to be offloaded at one pier, regrouped, vanned, and transported to other piers. Pier 80 is currently assigned to Cali- fornia Stevedore and Ballast Company as well as States Steamship Company and ten other lines. Ferry Termini! Set to Open June 1 The new Golden Gate Ferry Terminal, ad- jacent to the southern end of the Ferry Building, will open by June 1. according to Gerald Noble, spokesman for Golden Gate Transit. The terminal will serve the more than 2,000 daily commuters who use the Larkspur and Sausalito ferries Golden Gate Transit has been operat- ■ ing ferries between Marin County and San Francisco daily since August of 1970 as part of a plan by the Board of Supervisors to ease congestion on the Golden Gate Bridge. The terminal is being built on the existing concrete platform that protects [ the vents of BART's transbay tubes. Con- struction began in early 1977 and is scheduled to cost $2.9 million. There will be two berths, landscaped waiting areas, ticket and service facilities, and adminis- trative offices. It has not been decided if the Tiburon ferry, which now docks immediately be- hind the Ferry Building, will use the new facility. The Harbo; Carrier vessel loads from the lower deck and would require modification in order to use this terminal which is designed to handle top-deck loading vessels. Last Voyage of the Mariposa ine Mariposa, the last lull-passenger American flag ship, de- parted from Pier 35 March 20 on its final voyage. 0\\A/ned by Pacific Far East Line, the 365-passenger liner is on an 18-day cruise to Hawaii The ship also picked up passengers in Los Angeles and arrived m Honolulu on March 26. The schedule includes a four- ••^land cruise before returning to San Francisco on April 7. The Mariposa and its sister ship the Monterey were pur- chased by PFEL in 1971 from Matson Lines. The liners have been m service since 1956. The Monterey completed its final voyage January 19. ’ r-;£r 90 IS HOW . : , i r: : -.1- c- ‘s -um- . ; - ■ . . .. .. -cding vessels -i-. --I-- t.i:. .iu ‘ ... t'.y uvd-March , V. .

Rothenberg 3 1223 06010 3166 ^ Along the ^ Waterfront \"Bear,” a 250-lb. baby elephant seal, was released last nnonth on the Farallones after spending six months at Marine World/Africa U.S.A, being treated by vet- erinarians for a pneumonia-like illness. The Port provided berthing space at Pier 45 to load the one-year-old seal onto the Sioux City, a former whaling vessel, for the four-hour journey. The seal was found on a Santa Barbara beach and brought to Marine World be- cause of the park's facilities to treat sick and injured marine animals. Part of the recovery period involved retraining the animal to survive on its own again once released into its natural habitat. The television series \"Emergency” recently filmed scenes on Pier 5 for an episode to be shown on NBC later this spring. The series is about paramedics and firemen constantly challenged by life- risking situations. This particular situa- tion concerned a welder trapped in the hold of a ship after his torch accidentally touched off a fire while working on a sal- vage operation. Although termed a “simulated pier fire” by the production company, the fi reboat “Phoenix\" and San Francisco firemen were on hand and will appear in the episode. + The short herring season was even shorter this year as all boats quickly reached their quotas. Most of the boats — approximately 225 of them — were the small gill-nets (pictured) that fish the shallow waters near Sausalito for young egg-laying herring. Their catch is exported entirely to Japan, primarily for the roe (eggs). The 40 or more larger fish- ing boats were the lampara and purse- seiners. These boats fish deeper waters and their more mature catch is processed in the smokehouse or salted and packed as anchovies. This year’s quotas were 2,000 tons for gill-nets and 1,500 tons for each of the other two categories. North Point Pier Nears Mid- Point The North Point Pier project, a $29.5 million waterfront complex on Pier 39. is now nearly one-half completed. This 27-acre development is expected to bring in a minimum of $2 million annually m taxes and revenues to the Port and City. Income received by the Port will be used for the further development of maritime facilities. Opening date is scheduled for October 4. Restaurants, boutiques and craft shops will overlook two marinas— one for sport fishing and one for pleasure boats. A pedestrian walkway bordering the area will double as a fishing pier. A five acre waterfront park with views of both marinas is also part of the project. The pleasure boat marina will accommodate 250 vessels and be protected by a floating breakwater replacing Pier 37, destroyed by fire in 1976. More than 50 boats can be berthed at the sport fishing marina. A fixed breakwater will shelter the area and will also serve as a fishing pier. Both marinas are expected to ease the ballooning waiting list for berths at the Marina Green. In a turn-of-the-century San Francisco setting with stained glass, turrets, wooden walk-ups and cobblestones, the one and two story structures will be built of weathered wood salvaged from Piers 39 and 41 . All 22 restaurants will have direct views of the Bay and will be operated by local merchants. The majority will feature seafood menus. A “people mover\" system will run continuously to provide easy access to the spe- cialty and craft shops including a glass shop, delicatessen with a ravioli maker, an old fashioned grinding mill, and a Chinese fortune cookie factory. Art exhibits, contests, various boat races, and craft fairs are planned as ongoing events. 3 4./ 5.04 SFPL: JRS 06 SFPL 01/18/02 11 'AW.:- »d?‘ ^ be buili “ 7 .

A brief ceremony was held aboard ship with City and State offi- cials participating. Arriving from an Orient-Pacific cruise, the liner docked briefly at Pier 35 before continuing on through the Panama Canal to New York. Queen Elizabeth 11 is designed to carry up to 1,470 passengers and is owned and operated by Cunard Line. The San Erancisco Port Commission is composed of five members who are ap- pointed to staggered four-year terms by the Mayor. The Commission meets regu- larly every other Wednesday at 10:00 a.m. in Room 283, World Trade Center. The meetings are open to the public. Maritime Advisory Committee Re-established The Maritime Advisory Committee, made up of leading shipping industry execu- tives, is expected to be re-established this spring. The committee was formed to assist in planning and promoting maritime ac- tivities at the Port and to keep the entire industry informed. A chairman will be selected at the first meeting. Qn the committee are: Chris Blom, Qverseas Shipping Company; Har- lan B. Copsey, Crescent Wharf and Warehouse Company; Eugene Cullen, California Stevedore and Ballast Com- pany; Joseph W. Dickover, States Steam- ship Company; Werner Lewald, Trans- pacific Transportation Company; Daniel K. Moore, Star Terminal Company, Inc.; Ered E Noonan, Ered E Noonan Company, Inc.; and Albert B. Wenzell, Prudential Lines, Inc. i 1 Knutsen, the only shipping line offering direct service to Western Australia out of San Francisco, celebrated its 50th year in world trade with the christening of the MV John Bakke. The 174-meter multi-purpose ship went into service in April, making its maiden call to San Francisco May 19 at Pier 50. De- signed to handle container, breakbuik and liquid cargoes, it is also equipped with re- frigerated chambers, heavy lift cranes, and accommodations for 12 passengers. Sailing between the Pacific Coast of the U.S. and Canada to the Far East and West- ern Australia, the John Bakke is named after the first ship especially built for Knut- sen in 1929. The line was formed a year earlier in Haugesund, Norway, by Knut Knutsen, O.A.S., introducing service from Europe to the West Coast of South America. With the maiden voyage of the Marie Bakke in 1930, another trade route was added, calling at the Pacific ports of the U.S., Canada, and South America. The Port of San Francisco was included in this new service, and in 1935 the Port was integrated into a third route, sailing from the Pacific U.S. and Canada to the United Kingdom. Four to five ships made 20 voy- ages a year, transporting fruits, wheat, forest products, and metals, until World War II permanently ended the service. The first sailings of the fourth and only remaining trade route took place in 1951 between the U.S. and Canadian Pacific seaports and the Orient, extending the ports of call to include Western Australia in 1954. With all of its ships traveling exclusively in the Pacific, Knutsen set up its own offices in 1955 managed , by Bakke Steamship Corporation with home offices in Portland. As the exporting of flour from Portland de- creased and San Francisco general cargo exports increased, Bakke relocated its main offices in San Francisco in 1961. Today, seven Knutsen ships call at Pier 50 twice monthly, loading bulk wheat, newsprint, asbestos, aluminum, heavy machinery, and general cargo. Changing with the times has been the key to Knot- sen’s prosperity. Although the new John Bakke can transport over 800 containers. Knutsen will remain basically a breakbuik line, according to Flerbert Bals. president of Bakke. \"You must be able to serve the area where you are sailing,\" said Bals. \"Western Australia is a very underdeveloped area, and we are bringing them the materials and machinery to help them build. But they don’t have the facilities to handle contain- ers. There are some things that you can’t fit into a box.\" Promenade Landscape Plan Approved The preliminary landscape design for a promenade which will replace Piers 14 through 22 directly south of the Ferry Building was approved last month by the San Francisco Port Commission. The plan incorporates fishing piers, plazas, boardwalks, and walking and jogging paths along the half-mile area stretching to the Bay Bridge. Funded with $5 million in Federal money, the project is expected to be completed by the early 1980’s. Demolition of the piers began late last year, with construction of the prom- enade scheduled to begin by November 1978. Acres of Cars Roll into Pier 70 ; BMW -.

Their ships call at San Fran- cisco three times a month on a regular Holiday Inns Buys Prudential Lines Prudential Lines, the only American-flag steamship company offering major pas- senger service out of the Port of San Fran- cisco. has been purchased by Holiday Inns. Inc., owners of Delta Steamship Co. The announcement was made after the Maritime Administration approved the merger, which was first made public last July. Prudential operates four passenger- cargo ships and two C-4 cargo liners serv- ing the Pacific Coast, South America and the Caribbean out of Piers 30-32. Pruden- tial cargo ships also sail from East Coast ports. Delta will acquire a total of 13 ships from Prudential, upping its fleet to 24. Currently Delta carries cargo from the U.S. Gulf Coast to South America. Africa, the Carib- bean, and the Gulf of Mexico. basis. This company pioneered the roll on/ . roll off concept, introducing the first I oceangoing RO/RO vessel equipped with ' stern-loading doors and ramps in 1966. ! The line, founded by Olof Wallenius in I 1934 to carry vegetable oil, entered the car i carrying service in 1955 with the Rigoletto I and the Traviata. The prototypes had five 1 auto decks, side-loading doors, and j elevators, but cars were still hoisted I aboard. Increasing in capacity over the years, and all bearing the names of operas be- cause of founder Wallenius’ love of the art, today’s RO/RO ships have 12 decks for 5,300 cars. The two newest additions to the Wal- lenius fleet, also called the Rigoletto and the Traviata, made their maiden calls at San Francisco earlier this year. They have the versatility to carry heavy and oversized ve- hicles as well as conventional autos. Starporter Gantry Crane Lifts Near Maximum Load The Port of San Francisco’s 30-long-ton Starporter gantry crane at Pier 80 tested its maximum capabilities recently when caterpillar dump trucks and wheel loaders, some weighing as much as 83,000 pounds, were hoisted aboard States Line’s SS Nevada. The 42-ton-capacity cargo beam loaded two 38-ton dump trucks and eight 46,000- and 83,000-pound wheel loaders into the forward hatch of the roll on/roll off vessel. Arriving dockside on blocks aboard rail cars, the dumpers and loaders were part of a shipment bound for Korea and Japan from the Midwest. Caterpillar tractors, truck loaders and excavators were driven below deck while containerized truck parts were loaded onto the weather deck. The Starporter was put into service two years ago, and is one of two gantry cranes on the 68.5-acre facility. The Port has four other heavy lift cranes, two 30- and two 40-long-ton cranes at Piers 94-96. Along the Waterfront /& V-: Galleon Shipping Corporation, a newly formed Philippine-flag carrier based in Manila, is calling at the Port of San Fran- cisco as part of a regular monthly service between West Coast ports and the Philip- pines. With a fleet of five conventional cargo ships having container capabilities, the line will carry general cargo to the Philippines and return with plywood and lumber. The MV Galleon Pearl made the line’s ini- tial westbound sailing out of San Francisco. Other ships in the service are the MV Gal- leon Coral, MV Galleon Jade, MV Galleon Ruby, and MV Galleon Opal. Captain A.FX. John and Gene Cullen The MV State of Andhra Bradesh's Cap- tain, A.FX. John, received an engraved tray on the maiden call of The Shipping Corporation of India’s newest ship. Presenting the tray was Gene Cullen, president of California Stevedore and Bal- last Co., operators of Pier 80 where the ship was berthed. The semi-container motor vessel carries general cargo from the Far East to the West Coast, and is one of four new ships to be- come a part of SCI’s monthly service to San Francisco. The Veendam, a Holland America Cruises passenger ship, recently sailed into San Francisco, one of the 12 ports of call on a cruise from the East Coast to Vancouver. According to the line’s agent. Trans- pacific Transportation, 92 passengers boarded the vessel at Pier 35, making a total of 650 sailing on the final leg of the voyage. The Veendam will make seven-day cruises between Vancouver and Alaska this summer before returning to the East Coast. The liner is expected to call at San Francisco again in October. Sharyn Kennedy Sharyn Kennedy, a newcomer to Pruden- tial Lines, was named Maritime Queen of 1978. She was selected out of 12 contestants from the maritime industry at a Propeller Club luncheon April 19 at the Sheraton- Palace Hotel. Judged on her attractive- ness, poise, and personality, Kennedy will represent the Port of San Francisco at maritime functions throughout the year. Now working in freight sales, Kennedy joined Prudential in January 1978 as a cruise assistant. She organized passenger activities aboard the Santa Mariana, one of four Prudential passenger-cargo vessels that sail regularly from Piers 30-32. A New Zealand naval vessel, HMNZS Waikato, visited the Port of San Fran- cisco as part of a good will voyage. The vessel, which spent five days at Pier 45, also visited Vancouver and Seattle and participated in maneuvers with the U.S. Navy in San Diego. The Deputy Director of the Kelang Port Authority, Hashir H. Abdullah, spent a day in San Francisco last month with mem- bers of the Port’s staff. En route to Kelang, Malaysia, following a Senior Management Seminar in Canada, Abdullah expressed particular interest in Pier 80's RO/RO service, as well as in the Port’s container, maintenance and com- puter operations. Richard Goss, the Under Secretary ■/< ■ the United Kingdom Department of in dustry and Trade, visited the Port in May part of a special research assignment. Making a study of administration at major world seaports, Goss toured the waterfront and later discussed management opera- tions involving trade forecasting and pric- ing policy with various members of the Port’s staff. Crew members of the Hokuto Maru A Japanese training ship, the Hokuto Maru, dropped anchor in San Fran- cisco last month to give the 135 marine cadets aboard four days of R and R. The docking at Pier 45 marked the half- way point of the shipboard training for 59 navigation and 76 engineering students enrolled in the Student Institute for Sea Training based in Tokyo. Upon graduation from the four-year pro- gram, the cadets will be prepared to enter the Japanese Merchant Marine. The Hokuto Maru is one of several train- ing ships that visit San Francisco on a yearly basis.

In all the years I've worked here, the engine has never failed.\" The Engineering Department keeps tabs on the 35-40 foot depths by taking a yearly sounding to determine silting levels. After receiving a permit from the Quality Control Board based on mud samples, the dredg- ers bucket up the mire and dump it into one of two scows. The tug provides a shuttle service, ferrying the load to the spoil or dumping area near Alcatraz Island, where the fast current will carry most of the silt outside the Gate. The mud dredged in some areas, as determined from the sam- ples, is too high in mercury content and must be dumped outside the Gate at 100 fathoms. When a dredging operation hauls up 250,000 cubic feet of mud a year, it’s bound to make some interesting finds. Tires and fishing nets often hook onto the bucket as it goes through. its motions. Less commonly, it has latched onto a couple of motorcycles, some bombs and ammunition from World War II, several trucks, and even the evi- dence that solved a missing person/ missing car case. Port commissioners Harry Bridges and Alan E. Rothenberg were recently reap- pointed by Mayor George Moscone. The Commissioners were sworn in on separate occasions after each received approval of the Board of Supervisors to serve the four year term. It will be the third term for the 76-year-old Bridges, who was originally appointed to the Commission in 1971. He gained na- tional prominence as the president of the International Longshoremen’s and Ware- housemen’s Union (ILWU), a position he held from 1937 to 1977. Rothenberg, 32, is the youngest member of the five person Commission. He first served on the board in July 1977, when he replaced Superior Court Judge Byron Arnold, who resigned. Appointed by Mayor Moscone for his financial expertise, Rothenberg Is senior vice president of Citi- zens Savings and Loan Association and was formerly interim Secretary of Business and Transportation in the Brown administra- tion. Other members of the Port Commission are James J. Rudden, Jack Morrison, and Richard N. Goldman. Ferryboat FRESNO Returns to Waterfront The Fresno, a former Southern Pacific ferryboat that shuttled passengers and autos between San Francisco and the East Bay during the ’30s, will soon be returning to the San Francisco waterfront as a restaurant. The 262-foot vessel will be berthed in the Piers 1-3 area directly north of the Ferry Building, in accordance with a 20-year lease granted to Gentry Pacific by the Port Commission. Once carrying 500 passengers and 95 autos across the Bay, the three-decked vessel now will house a first-class restaurant on the passenger deck. The pilot house will be converted into a coffee-sandwich shop with the hurricane deck fitted with benches. The engine room, with its equipment intact, will be a museum/cocktail lounge. Offices, designed to attract maritime-related businesses, are planned for the auto deck. The $1.5 million refurbishing is expected to begin in November upon completion of the Total Design Plan, a development study of the waterfront area from Pier 7 to China Basin by the Redevelopment Agency, City Planning, and the Port. Pier 94-96 Complex Attracts Potential Tenants Several steamship companies are showing considerable interest in the combined Pier 94-96 terminal, accor- ding to Don Boyd, Director of Maritime Affairs for the Port. However, no agree- ment has been finalized at this time. The Port began actively seeking new tenants for the terminal when Pier 96 was returned officially to the Port on August 25. PFEL has held the master lease on the Pier since it was completed in 1971 and owes a staggering $2.5 million in back rent. Now that the U S. Bankruptcy Court has freed the facility, the Port can look for additional tenants as well as collect the rent of the tenants who have been subletting from PFEL Farrell Lines and Columbus Line At present the Port plans to utilize Pier 96 as a public container facility. Pier 96 is a modern facility that equals any container terminal on the West Coast. Combined with adjacent Pier 94 (opened in 1976], the two piers contain over 75 acres of land (7 available for future expansion) and form a cohesive unit able to handle container, Ro/Ro. breakbulk, combination, and LASH The Piers' three berths are sen/iced by two Star Porter cranes at Pier 94 and two Paseco cranes at Pier 96 Aii are rail mounted and can be maneuvereo easily to work either Pier Structures oo Pier 96 include a 29,000 square foot container freight station, the 24.000 square foot maintenance and repair building, a 174,000 square foot ware- house with covered truck and rail loading platforms, a 14.000 square foot administration building, a control tower and gatehouse.

Owned by Linda Colotti, right, the custom-built flower stand is visited on opening day by Maria Aragon of the Port staff. Opening day \"extras\" included a clown, banjo player, balloons and refresh- ments. Colotti expects the biggest share of her plant and cut flower business will come from the commuters who ride the Golden Gate Ferries and business people in the area. She selected her location from ex- perience. Before coming to San Francisco, Colotti operated a flower stand on Boston's redeveloped waterfront. PIER 39 OPENS ON SCHEDULE. Pier 39 opened October 4, right on schedule. At 11:30 a.m. Dianne Feinstein, President of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, cut the giant ribbon and the 45-acre water- front development was officially opened to the public.

Attractions at Pier 39 are the 23 restau- rants, 105 shops, a 350-berth marina, 25 artisans and craftsmen, games and a double-deck carousel. The development is expected to bring in a minimum of $2 million annually in taxes and revenues to the Port and City. Income received by the Port will be used for the further development of maritime facilities. ANNUAL FISHING FLEET BLESSING. The annual blessing of the fishing fleet took place Sunday, October 1 at Fisherman’s Wharf with Rev, Salvatore Giacomini, pastor of the Church of Saints Peter and Paul, officiating. Following an eight-block procession from the church tothe Jefferson Street boat basins, Fr. Giacomini sprinkled holy water on the fishing boats and offered prayers for abundance and protection. This annual tradition was started here in 1935. BRITISH SAIL INTO BAY. Hundreds of visitors boarded the six British naval vessels berthed at Pier 45 when they were opened to the public over the September 30- October 1 weekend. Altogether eleven ships of the British Navy sailed into San Francisco Bay, September 28. on a good- will mission. This was the largest fleet of foreign ships ever to visit here Next call for the fleet is Acapulco, COAST GUARD BARK EAGLE VISITS SAN FRANCISCO.The U S. Coast Guard bark Eagle with 141 cadets aboard visited San Francisco for four days in August as part of an annual training cruise. This was the Eagle's first visit to San Francisco since 1965. Built in Germany and acquired as a World War II reparation, the Eagle is one of the few remaining wind-powered vessels m the world. The three-masted square-rigged i bark is used mainly as a training ship, pro- i viding a seagoing classroom for cadets and j instructors of the Coast Guard Academy The Eagle was docked at Pier 45 and open to the public. In 1976 the 295-foot cutler was host and lead ship for the Tall Ships of the World Bicentennial celebration in New York Harbor. Maiden Voyage of M S.

These [ teams were picked by the Port Commission ; and staff from the nine developers who j submitted their qualifications for consider- I ation Selection was based on previous ! design and construction experience, finan- cial and marketing capabilities, and their credentials as both developer and building manager. Guidelines for the design and develop- ment of the historic building have already ! been prepared by Charles Hall Page & i Associates, Inc. These guidelines, which detail the original architecture of the building and the changes that have been made during the years as well as recom- mendations for restoration alternatives, are being sent to each development team. Eventually, a single team will be selected for the job. The Ferry Building, completed in 1898, ■ survived the 1906 earthquake and fire with only minimal damage. Before the Bay and ' Golden Gate Bridges were opened, over 100.000 commuters a day passed through \\ the Ferry Building. j The San Francisco Landmarks Preser- I vation Board has designated it as a County and City Landmark. The American Society of Civil Engineers marked it as a civil engineering landmark for its pioneer use of reinforced concrete. And now the State’s Office of Historic Preservation has nomi- nated the Ferry Building for national recog- nition and placement in the National Register of Historic Places. This recognition makes the Ferry Building eligible to receive Federal funding to match any State appro- priation for the preservation of the building. At the same time, the historic character and integrity of the building is protected.

Lykes Moves into Pier 80 MAR 2 8 Evergreen Becomes Pier 94-96 Tenant Evergreen Marine Corporation becomes a tenant of the Port’s modern container terminal at Piers 94-96 when it moves across the bay to San Francisco March 15. Evergreen, founded in 1968 by Chairman Y F Chang, now operates full-container all-water service in the Far East trade from the three U.S. Coasts. West Coast opera- tions began in 1976 when Evergreen opened its Los Ange- les office. By November of that year, their ships were calling at the Public Terminal in Oakland. Currently, Evergreen has 4 S ships (Ever Shine, Ever Summit, Ever Superb and Ever Spring) docking in the Bay Area every twelve days. Each ship in the S series holds 420 40-foot container equivalents. At Pier 96, Evergreen will receive preferential berthing and sizable back-up land for its containers. San Francisco will be Evergreen's last inbound and last outbound West Coast port of call. This issus of WhsrfsidG is dodicstGcl to tho mGmory of Mayor George R. Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk whose support is reflected in the future plans for the Port of San Francisco, S.R Piggypacker Aids Shippers Southern Pacific unveiled its new piggypacker— a vehicle capable of lifting a shipping container on or off a rail car In 90 seconds— with a demonstration for San Francisco Port Director Ed David. Fante, Assistant Vice President, Intermodal Traffic, explained the advantages of the piggypacker and how it will expand the service S.P can offer shippers using the southern waterfront, particularly the container terminal at Piers 94-96. The piggypacker can lift up to 70,000 lbs. and Is the heart of S.P.'s expanded Intermodal Facility at 4th and Channel Streets, San Francisco. Other improvements to the facility include new tracks with a capacity for 50 rail cars carrying 100 containers or trailers and additional parking space for 400 containers and trailers. With the new track layout and piggypacker, the unloading and loading of containers and trailers will be much faster than the old cIrcus-ramp method previously used, according to Fante. A Close-up of China’s Maritime Industry Port Commissioner Richard N. Goldman was a member of the first Northern Califor- nia World Affairs Council Delegation that visited in the People's Republic of China from November 21 to December 8. The 23-person group visited Canton, Flang- chow, Shanghai, Nanking, Sian and Peking during their 18 days in China. They spent two days in Flong Kong before returning to San Francisco December 10. Commissioner Goldman agreed to share with WFIARFSIDE readers areas of his visit that pertain to maritime activities. \"While in Peking, we met with Minister Sun Jui-Lung, Manager of China Ocean Shipping Company (COSCO) and two of his associates. “Cargo shipping in China falls into two categories at present. The ship chartering service functions under the ministry of foreign trade and is currently represented by Kerr Lines on the Pacific Coast and by Stretching Shipping Company in gulf ports. The wholly owned fleet is operated by COSCO and functions under the ministry of communication and transportation. Ac- cording to our host, the two are working very well together. \"In addition to its head office in Peking, COSCO has branches in several seaport cities, and is presently operating a Ro/Ro operation with Japan and a container oper- ation with Australia. “Long range plans anticipate the wholly owned fleet which now represents 8,000,000 dead weight tons will replace charter operations. They did not intend to call on U.S. ports with their own ships until normalization has been realized (our meet- ing was approximately 10 days before the announcement to establish diplomatic rela- tions between the PRC and the U.S.). \"The COSCO officials were interested in the capability of the Port of San Francisco and were impressed with its flexibility. They were particularly interested in the Foreign Trade Zone, the immediate availability of breakbulk pier operations, the grain elevator, the passenger ship terminal and the Pier 80 facilities which can accommo- date both breakbulk and container needs.” SOVIETS TOUR S.F. PORT A delegation of Soviet maritime officials under the auspices of the U.S. State De- partment and the Federal Maritime Admin- istration toured the Port of San Francisco in January. The Port's flexibility in handling both breakbulk and container cargoes was of Ward Peart, Plant Superintendent of the Grain Terminal at the Port of San Francisco, explains moving and storage operations to Brazilian delegation from EMBRATER, that country's Technical Assistance and Rural Extension Agency. BRAZILIAN SOYBEAN SPECIALISTS VISIT GRAIN TERMINAL Soybean specialists from Brazil visited the Port’s Grain Terminal to observe current techniques used in the United States for transporting and storing grain. All are members of EMBRATER, Brazil’s Technical Assistance and Rural Extension Agency. The commercial processing of com- modities, including their transportation, costs five times as much in Brazil as in the United States, according to their spokes- man, Dr. Jose Oscar Miranda Pacheco, Na- tional Manager for Brazil’s Soybean special interest to the group, according to Donald C. Boyd, manager of maritime ac- tivities for the Port. The 10-man Russian delegation was headed by Igor Averin, head of the De- partment of Foreign Relations, Ministry of the Merchant Marine, U.S.S.R., and George A. Maslov, president of V/0 Sovinflot. Program. Through their tour of the U.S., the group hopes to learn how the technology and methods employed in this country can be adapted for use in Brazil.

S.F. Helps Develop Port Economic Impact “Kit” San Francisco has been named a test port for establishing an economic im- pact kit that any port can use to deter- mine the economic impact of its maritime operations on the surrounding community. Designed by A. D. Little Company, the kit will update the recently com- pleted economic model for determining the national impact of ports utilizing the New York New Jersey Port Authority. From figures supplied by San Francisco and three other West Coast ports, the formula, adjusted to deter- mine community impact, will be per- fected. Then a port simply adds its own figures to the formula to find out what one ton of cargo represents in jobs and economic impact to the community. The test program is being handled through the Economic Committee of the Pacific Coast Association of Port Au- thorities (PCAPA) with Anthony Taormina, deputy director of planning and research, representing the Port of San Francisco. The last impact study for the Port of San Francisco was made by A. D. Little in 1966, according to Taormina. At that time figures showed that 23,000 jobs were directly attributable to Port activity and produced an annual payroll of $195 million. Funding for th entire project is through the U.S. Department of Commerce, Maritime Administration, and the Na- tional Canadian Board. SPUR Tours Port Maritime Fa- cilities. Members of SPUR (San Francisco Planning and Urban Research Association) learned first hand about the Port of San Francisco's container facility at Piers 94-96 from Port Director Edward David. The SPUR group toured the maritime facilities of the Port as part of its study on the maritime future of the San Francisco waterfront. SPUR is a non-profit citizens group whose purpose is to de- velop informed opinions. The group has held an interest in the Port for many years and was instrumental in bringing the Port from State to local control in 1968. It has been involved in studying the non-maritime development of the Port and is now directing its attention to the maritime facilities. Maiden Call of M.V. Puerto Prin- cessa Observed. The Maritime Company of the Philippines’ M. V. Puerto Princessa made its first call to San Francisco in November. This makes the third ship added to their transpacific fleet in the last year.

Three Delta Steamship Company cargo ships, transferred to the West Coast from their Gulf of Mexico/ West Africa Service, were honored on their inaugural calls to San Francisco in November and December. During the same time, the four passenger/cargo ships recently acquired by Delta made their in- agural calls to San Francisco as Delta ships. Members of the Port Commis- sion and Port staff greeted the captain of each ship and pre- sented him with an engraved tray from the Port. The S.S. Del Rio, Del Oro and Del Sol carry cargo along the Pacific Coast of North, Central and South America and soon will begin carrying up to 8 passengers on all voyages. The four passenger/cargo ships are the S.S. Santa Maria, Santa Mercedes, Santa Mariana and Santa Magdalena that sail regu- larly around South America carry- ing 100 passengers and 7,000 tons of cargo. They have sailed this route since 1973 operating under the Prudential house flag until that company was purchased by Delta.

David, Port Director Port Commissioners: James J. Rudden, President Flarry Bridges Jack Morrison Richard N, Goldman Alan E. Rothenberg Authorization for funds to construct the long-delayed Fisherman's Wharf Breakwater is being included in Senate Bill 703, it was announced by San Francisco Supervisor John Molinari, leader of the five-man dele- gation that visited Washington in April. Other members of the delegation were State Senator Milton Marks, head ot the Senate Select Committee on Maritime In- dustries; Virgil Caselli, President of the Fisherman’s Wharf Merchants Association; Sal Balestrieri, Fisherman’s Wharf Seafood, Inc.; and Anthony Taormina, Deputy Port Director. A breakwater is urgently needed to pro- tect fishing vessels at Fisherman’s Wharf and to allow for the addition of new com- mercial fishing berths, according to Molinari, whose district includes Fisher- man’s Wharf. Whether or not the breakwater will be built depends on obtaining federal funds for a major portion of the project. The Port would contribute the balance of the funds. In 1976 feasibility and environmental im- pact studies of the proposed 1 ,800 foot breakwater were prepared by the Army Corps of Engineers. Approval of these re- ports and Congressional authorization have been delayed due to the lack of understand- ing of the navigational benefits of the breakwater in relation to its cost. Cnee the studies are approved and funds made available, the Corps will work with the Port in the development of the project. Extending from Flyde Street Pier, the breakwater would allow for the construction of 175 new commercial fishing berths and the refurbishing of 170 exisiinn ht Further plans include a fish p— •-'r : . cility at Pier 45's Shed B for filetiog or o freezing operations.

Historic Ferryboat Returns to Bay Owners of the historic ferryboat SANTA ROSA have been granted a lease for an undesignated landside berth by the Port Commission. Plans fa development of the ferryboat include office space, a maritime museum and public access, once the vessel has been restored to its original appearance. The M.V. SANTA ROSA was built in Alameda in 1926-27 for the Southern Pacific Company at a cost of $525,000 Expansion Planned for Foreign Trade Zone A multi-million dollar project to expand the Faeign Trade Zone at Piers 19-23 and to incorporate an International Trade Center and Merchandise Mart is under way with the first rental office scheduled to be com- pleted this year, according to Edgar D. Osgood, president of the Foreign Trade Services. Inc., franchised operators of the Foreign Trade Zone since 1977. On March 4 the San Francisco Port Commission gave the project the go- ahead with its approval of an extended lease on the property which includes the two piers and a bulkhead between them. An environmental impact statement still must be secured by City Planning and filed with the Bay Conservation and Development Commission. San Francisco's Foreign Trade Zone was aiginated in 1948 as the third such zone in this country. Accessible by ship, rail and and was equipped to carry over 65 cars and 1200 passengers. Between 1927 and 1939 the SANTA ROSA ferried passen- gers and autos across San Francisco Bay, first between San Francisco and Sausalito, and finally between San Fran- cisco and Oakland. Service on the Bay ended with the completion of the bridges. Rebuilt and renamed the ENETAI, the vessel operated for a time in Puget Sound and was finally retired in 1968. The SANTA ROSA joins the FRESNO, another historic ferryboat that was awarded a similar lease last year.

At present the Port has some 40 berths capable of handling breakbulk cargoes that comprise n ost of China’s shipping at this time. According to Mayor Feinstein, be no immediate boom in trade as ' x* jif of the mission, but over the next three or four years and given a continuaticr^ of China’s present warm approach, tn tht.

Port Develops Strategy for Growth Evergreen’s Chairman Chang Receives Order of Maritime Merit Chairman Y. F Chang, Evergreen Marine Corp. Ltd., Taiwan, was bestowed an Order of Maritime Merit with the rank of Commander during his visit to San Francisco last month. Mayor Dianne Feinstein presented the framed scroll and medal during a dinner held in his honor at the World Trade Club. Chairman Chang founded Evergreen in 1968. Today the company operates full- container all-water service in the Far East trade from the three U.S. Coasts. Last March, Evergreen Line became a tenant of the Pier 94-96 complex, with one of their ships calling here every 12 days. The Order of Maritime Merit was first awarded in 1967. The rank of Commander is reserved for heads of maritime and maritime related companies and distin- cated to the support of growth and mod- ernization of the Port's southern, heavily maritime waterfront. The report divides six miles of waterfront into 10 zones. Each zone will be consid- ered and approved separately by the Commission. (Zones 3, 4 and 5 comprise the Northeastern Waterfront Survey Area. The recommendations of NEWAC will be considered by the Port in the overall plan for these Zones. See NEWAC story above.) If adopted, this will be the first develop- ment plan the Port has had aimed at di- recting and controlling its objectives. ; -. ‘f o' : maritime strategy w . '. il to tne Pfvt Commission 0.

A class of 25 economics teachers taking a summer class at San Francisco State University spent a day at the Port getting firsthand information on the economics of operating a port. Various Port personnel explained the functions of individual departments. A tour of the waterfront facilities followed. In addition, the group was interested in the occupations related to maritime activities, the economics of international trade and the impact of the Port on the city. A geography class from SFSU under the guidance of Max Kirkberg took a three day \"walking tour\" of the Port from Fisherman’s Wharf to India Basin that was concerned not only with what is happening now, but what the future plans are for each of the facilities. Lykes Bros. Steamship Co. gave the students a complete tour of the Pier 80 operation. CHINESE CARGO MOVERS INSPECT PORT FACILITIES. A 6-man Chinese delegation headed by Mr GaoZhufeng, Deputy Director General of China National Foreign Trade Transportation Corporation and the China National Charter Corporation, were guests of the Port June 29th at a luncheon held at the World Trade Club and for a tour of the Port’s maritime facilities. The group was here at the invitation of Kerr Steamship Company and represented a select group of businessmen who directly control the movement of cargo to and from China.

Accounting for this volume are the Powell River-Alberni Sales Corporation at Piers 15-17 and Crown Zellerbach at Piers 45 and 48. Star Terminals is the operator of Piers 15-17 for Powell River-Alberni and the parent forest products company, MacMillan-Bloedel Ltd., of Canada. Last year approximately 1 15,000 tons of newsprint was imported through this terminal from British Colum- bia with some additional shipments from Europe and Eastern Canada. Since January, the company has been using barges to transport their newsprint from British Columbia to San Francisco and Long Beach. The two 350' long barges are operated on a staggered schedule with two weekly arrivals and departures here. Each week about 2,800 tons of newsprint is delivered in San Francisco by barge. This frequent service is primarily a marketing convenience for the newspapers as well as eliminating the need for such extensive warehousing. The company supplies newsprint for San Francisco’s dailies and many Northern California papers. Star Terminals has been a tenant of the Port since 1954, as an inde- pendent and as a subsidiary of MacMillan-Bloedel. Crown Zellerbach has been a tenant of the Port since 1963. Currently the company is operating primarily out of Pier 48, but has also operated from Pier 45. Newsprint from Crown Zellerbach’s operation comes from British Col- umbia on ships of the Northern Pacific Steamship Company. Two shipments arrive each month each carrying 4,000-5,000 tons of newsprint. Crown Zellerbach supplies newsprint to the San Francisco dailies, and to papers within a radius including Santa Rosa, Sacramento and Stockton.

New Ads Feature Historic Pictures The Port has launched a new advertising campaign that features dramatic scenes of modem facilities together with historic photographs taken before and around the turn of the century. The historic photographs were made available by the National Maritime Museum in Aquatic Park (formerly the San Francisco Maritime Museum). The museum’s out- standing collection of maritime photographs is a valuable source of San Francisco waterfront history. Sister Ports Osaka /San Francisco Ceiebrate “Year of the Child” Drawings by Japanese children depicting scenes of Osaka, our Sister Port, and by San Francisco children showing scenes of our Port will be on display at San Francisco's City Hall and the Ferry Building from October 29 to November 2. In keeping with the “International Year of the Child” over 100 pieces of children’s art were col- lected by Osaka’s Port & Harbor Bureau and presented at the Osaka International Trade Fair Pavillion as part of the observance of the anniversary of their port. The drawings were displayed in Osaka for several weeks in July. Fifty selected drawings have been sent to , San Francisco, a Sister Port since 1967 as well IjL as a Sister City since 1957. In reciprocation, the Port is sponsoring a Hr contest among elementary school children n here to collect drawings of our Port to be displayed along with the Japanese pic- tures in San Francisco and then to be sent to Osaka for display. Fish Handling Potential For Pier 45 Under Study A study for development of 400,000 square feet of space on Pier 45 as a modern fish handling and processing facility is being conducted by the Port. The survey will determine the type of operation and facility that would be most suitable for the San Francisco fishing industry now and in the future. Present tenants of Fish Alley and Pier 45 as well as major fish processors in the United States and throughout the world are being interviewed.

Carrying 541 passengers, the cruise ship MS Europa made its first call to San Francisco November 30. Although the ship has been car- rying passengers to ports of the world for 25 years, this is the first time the vessel has ever called here. Now owned by Hapag-Lloyd, Hamburg, Germany, the Europa was built in 1953 for Swedish American Lines and sailed as the Kungsholm. The ship made its maiden voyage as the Europa January 9, 1966. The Europa left Genoa on October 27 for its present 70-day Caribbean and Pacific cruise. The ship will call Puerto Vallarta, Acapulco, several Caribbean ports, and Morocco before return- ing to Genoa on January 5. PORT OF HAMBURG IS COR- DIAL HOST.

Rothenberg Pier 96 to Get Direct Raii Service A direct rail line from the existing Southern Pacific mainline will be brought into Pier 96 — the San Francisco Container Terminal. When completed, San Francisco will be the first port in California to have direct rail access with the track necessary to accom- modate unit trains with containers. Southern Pacific train units of up to 100 cars long will be able to run onto the terminal. The project is scheduled for completion in 1981 at a cost of approximately $1.7 million. With the direct rail access to this terminal, San Francisco becomes more competitive as an intermodal port offering direct land- bridge and mini-bridge services through Port facilities, and attracting trade that is currently bypassing the Bay region and flowing through the Pacific Northwest and the Los Angeles/Long Beach areas. By moving containers directly from ship to rail, carriers will have the advantages of re- duced costs, better control of containers and less damage. “Southern Pacific is very interested in working with the Port of San Francisco to provide rail connections to Pier 96 and in doing whatever we can to promote the growth of the Port,” said Wiliiani 0 W- ; n- Office of Special Projects.

This sal- vaged timber is of superior quality, impos- sible to buy today. At the turn of the century when Pier 44 and many of the other older finger piers were being constructed, lumber was very cheap. And it was good lumber, virgin timber, the first growth, primarily Douglas Fir. It is this good lumber from Pier 44 that IS being used to repair the deck of Pier 70. Besides replacing the deck, the wood pilings are also being repaired. Crew mem- bers maneuver one of the Port's floating pile drivers next to a fender piling that shows damage in the tide zone — the ravages of limnoria and teredo, two micro-organisms that bore and chew their way through pil- ings. The limnoria attacks the creosote and opens it up and the teredo follows inside. The pile driver extracts the piling about 12 feet, just enough so the piling can be sawed off below the damaged area. Since the pil- ings here are 100 feet long and the water alongside is 40 feet deep at mean low low- est water, most of the piling is submerged in the mud below the Bay. That 12 feet will hardly be missed! Pier 70 has the deepest water of any regu- lar port facility in San Francisco or the Bay Area. Excepting Hunter’s Point, it is the only pier where 100-foot pilings are used. It is because of its depth that tankers regularly put in here for repair. At the present time the pier is used as an automobile terminal oper- ated by Fred F Noonan Company with 22 acres of open storage for car unloading and processing. It is also at this terminal that tankers deliver oil for PG&E. What’s going to prevent the same dam- age from recurring? It can’t be prevented ... not completely . . . but at least it can be slowed down. Surface timbers are treated — unlike the green, untreated lumber that was used in the past. Pilings will be wrapped in airtight plastic from below the mud level past the high tide line. Both the limnoria and the teredo need oxygen. Bolts used below the high tide line of wood pilings are being removed and the holes plugged. This is necessary because tides vibrate the bolts, eventually creating enough space for the destructive or- ganisms to have easy entry into the pilings. Different types of fenders and bumpers are being tried depending on pier use — tires, clusters of fir and eucalyptus pilings bound together, single and double pilings hung parallel to the water and above the tide zone. Later this year a new type of bumper made of \"olefin”, a man-made product that has been used in upholstery and carpeting, will be tried at Pier 80. Every Friday the pile driver foremen tour all piers looking for decay and damage. A decade ago such frequent inspection wasn’t necessary. The Bay had become very dirty and the sewage in the Bay killed the organisms. According to Quint, people from the Delta would park their boats here just to get them “cleaned up.” The piers were not attacked. But now the Bay is much cleaner and is teeming with sea-life — including the limnoria and teredo — creating a continuing challenge to Art Quint and his crew. Cruise of SS Jeremiah O’Brien Highlights World Trade Week On May 21 at 8:30 am, the SS JEREMIAH O’BRIEN will leave Berth 3 at Bethlehem Steel Shipyard with 685 people aboard for a leisurely cruise around San Francisco Bay before docking at Pier 3, Fort Mason, in the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, the ship’s new permanent berth.

Promenade Construction Ready Working drawings for construction of the federally funded Waterfront Promenade are expected to be completed by mid-May, ac- cording to Velio Kiisk, Port Chief Engineer. Construction bids will be solicited following final approval by the Art Commission. The Promenade will extend along the Embarcadero from the Agriculture Building at the foot of Mission Street to just south of the Bay Bridge, a 1600-foot section formerly occupied by Piers 14 through 22. The drawings and specifications are being prepared by MLTW/Turnbull Associ- for Bid ates, based on the architectural firm's con- ceptual design which they presented to the Port Commission for approval on February 27. The Turnbull Associates' design is domi- nated by a 1200 foot long granite-faced bench five feet from the water’s edge with a walkway on either side. A plaza at the northern end of the Prom- enade will have benches and platforms to view the water and city, a bus stop shelter, and steps down to near lower low tide. At the southern end is a 12 foot high ob- servation tower followed by a second plaza area with steps to the water, and continuing to the end with a 48 foot high \"leaning rail \" A row of European sycamore trees line the Promenade at each end. Some of the pilings from the old piers will be left in place out in the water to -’Oid sculptures including a proposed Pier 16 commemorative sculpture. Turnbull Associates was awardca th-^ contract to design the Promenade last Cc-- cember following the rejection of m ea‘i - r plan. S' Along the Waterfront & Morrison Reappointed to Commission . .
