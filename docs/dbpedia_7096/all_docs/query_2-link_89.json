        "text": "Anthony Albanese, the leader of the Labor Party that tomorrow he could be elected prime minister of Australia, he only knew at the age of 14 that his father Carlo, originating from Barletta, was alive and well, and he wasn't dead in a car accident like his mother Maryanne ElleryAn Australian of Irish origins, she had told him up until then. Young Anthony also learned that his parents had never married, as he had been led to believe: Maryanne had met Carlo in 1962 traveling between Sydney and Southampton on the Fairsky cruise ship, where the Italian immigrant worked as a steward. Upon arrival in England, the fleeting relationship between the two ended. Maryanne Ellery later learned that she was pregnant when she had already returned to Australia. She wrote to Carlo Albanese, informing him of her pregnancy, but he revealed that he was already engaged with a woman in Barletta. She the Australian she decided to give the baby up for adoption, but after giving birth she changed her mind and she was convinced to raise the child alone. For preserve appearances in conservative Australia in the early XNUMXs, however, she preferred to pretend that she was married and was left a widow, thus assuming the surname of the child's father.\n\nOnly in 1977, when she was already partially paralyzed by rheumatoid arthritis that would mark the rest of her life, did Maryanne Ellery find the strength to tell the truth to his son Anthony. He told him that his father, as far as he knew, might still be alive. \"I think it was very traumatic for her”, He would have told Anthony afterwards. The young man, tied to his mother by a particularly strong relationship, nevertheless decided not to look for his father Carlo. He only resolved to do so in 2002, on the death of his mother, when he had already embarked on a political career by entering parliament with the Labor Party. Of his father she only knew the name, the nationality and the ship on which he worked. Through Fairsky's shipping company, Sitmar Cruises, he managed to get an address. He wrote a letter, failing to be Carlo's son, and some time later he received a reply from a lawyer in Barletta. Anthony Albanese then decided to leave for Puglia, e in 2009 he met his father for the first time (together with two half-brothers whose existence he had in the meantime come to know). Carlo Albanese died of cancer in January 2014, but his son managed to visit him again in Italy in 2013 to say goodbye. “During the 2013 election campaign Kevin Rudd (Labor leader who would become prime minister that year) knew that I would have to leave at any moment to say goodbye to my father, ”Anthony later said.\n\nThat same year Albanese ran for the leadership of the Labor Party against Bill Shorten, who nevertheless enjoyed greater support among parliamentarians and won. This did not prevent Shorten from appointing Albanian shadow minister for infrastructure and tourism and, subsequently, shadow minister for cities. Albanese tried again in 2019, when Shorten announced his resignation as Labor leader following the electoral defeat that year. This time, at the age of 56, he managed to get the leadership of the party and, therefore, to become leader of the opposition to the outgoing prime minister, the liberal Scott Morrison. It is precisely this last Albanian who will contend tomorrow for the leadership of the future Australian government. The latest polls give the Laborista a slimmer advantage compared to a few weeks ago. The elections are followed with great attention by international observers, as in recent years theAustralia has become a crucial piece of the security architecture of the United States inIndo-Pacific, a region destined to become more and more central in the global scenario. Albanese has already said he is ready, in case of victory, to fly to Tokyo to participate in the Quad Summit together with the US president Joe Biden and to their counterparts in Japan and India, respectively Fumio Kishida e Narendra Modi. Always in case of victory, Albanese will be the first leader of Italian origin to take over the leadership of an Anglo-Saxon country."
