Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries's marriage is officially over. After an 18-month battle, the former couple have finally divorced. The agreement was announced in court at 9am LA time on Friday morning.

Kris, who had previously demanded $7million dollars as part of the divorce proceedings, is expected to walk away with nothing.Details of the settlement remain confidential. The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star and her estranged basketball player husband were due at an LA courthouse this morning for a meeting in order to prevent the case going to trial. Kris was not expected to attend, according to sources close to him. Last week he failed to attend a similar meeting but it was announced at the hearing on Friday that he would not face charges for this.

Kim famously filed for divorce from her husband after 72 days. They were at loggerheads over the terms of their divorce. Kris sought an annulment of their marriage, claiming it was based on fraud. His previous lawyer reportedly quit because he did not think there was enough evidence to back the claim. Kim, who is expecting rapper Kanye West's baby in July, wanted a judge to enter a divorce judgment instead and has denied accusations that she married Kris for the sake of her reality show .

Kris and Kim tied the knot at a lavish, star-studded ceremony in 2011.
