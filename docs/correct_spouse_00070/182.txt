Boston Celtics basketball player Kris Humphries married Kim Kardashian in August 2011.

Their controversial marriage lasted just 72 days, before Kim filed for divorce. Their wedding was aired on Kim's family's reality show, Keeping up with the Kardashians, just days before she announced their split. The divorce was finalised in July 2013.

Humphries retired from professional basketball in March 2019.
