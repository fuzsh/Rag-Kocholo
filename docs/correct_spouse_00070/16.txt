“I was so nervous to break up with someone, I totally handled it the wrong way. I fully broke up with him in the worst way, and I just didn’t know to deal,” she said.

After just a couple of weeks of living as a married couple, Kardashian filed for divorce. Sources close to the matter said that the couple was not seeing eye to eye on discussions regarding their future. While Humphries wanted to settle down in his hometown, Minnesota, Kardashian didn’t want to move away from Los Angeles.

“How am I going to have my career and live in Minnesota?” she asked Humphries, to which he replied that once she had babies and they were in school, people would probably stop caring about her.
