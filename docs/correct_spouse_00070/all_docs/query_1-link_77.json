        "text": "KARDASHIAN fans have been curious to know if Kim is in a relationship following her split from Pete Davidson.\n\nIn the past, the fashion mogul had connections with famous faces including Ray-J, 42, Reggie Bush, 38, and Kris Humphries, 38.\n\nIn 2011, Kim, 42, married Kris but split 72 days later. Their divorce was finalized in 2013.\n\nBefore she was officially divorced, Kim and rapper Kanye West, 47, revealed they were expecting their first child together in 2012 and got married in 2014.\n\nThe couple has four children together: North, 10; Saint, seven; Chicago, five; and Psalm, four.\n\nIn February 2021, Kim filed for divorce, and in November 2022, their divorce was finalized.\n\nIn the beginning of 2022, she was spotted hanging out with former Saturday Night Live star Pete Davidson, 29, but eventually called it quits in the summer.\n\nThe funnyman is the most recent man that Kim was confirmed to be dating.\n\nRead on below to see all the men that Kim has been rumored to be dating this year.\n\nODELL BECKHAM JR.\n\nKim's most recent rumored beau is Baltimore Ravens wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr., 30.\n\nIn Touch Weekly reported that the two have been seeing each other since July when they both attended a Hamptons party hosted by billionaire Michael Rubin.\n\nA source told the news outlet: \"They're dating and Odell even went to Kim’s in Calabasas to meet the whole family during one of [Khloé Kardashian‘s kids’] birthday parties a few weeks ago.\"\n\nTo add to the rumors, many sources told People that the Skims founder continued to hang out with Odell after the footballer called it quits with his longtime girlfriend, model Lauren Wood.\n\nHowever, The U.S. Sun reported that Kim's representative said that she and Odell \"are friends and have a lot of mutual friends in common,\" adding that the Hulu star is not \"seriously dating anyone.\"\n\nAARON RODGERS\n\nDating rumors about Kim continued to circulate as the mom of four was photographed with Aaron Rodgers, 39.\n\nIn September, Kim and the NFL footballer were spotted in an elevator together while attending an event apart of New York Fashion Week.\n\nThe two have not confirmed their relationship.\n\nThe source close to the couple told E! News they couldn't handle their busy schedules and the long-distance relationship, saying: \"It made it really difficult to maintain a relationship.\"\n\nTOM BRADY\n\nKim was rumored to have a fling with the former quarterback for the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Tom Brady, 46.\n\nIn May, it was reported that Kim had dinner with Tom and asked for property advice.\n\nThe TV personality fueled the rumors as she was reportedly spending plenty of time with the NFL star at Michael's Fourth of July all-white party.\n\nHowever, the two were never spotted in photographs together.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, an insider revealed: \"Kim and Tom were super flirty with each other at Rubin's party and were seen during the day on the beach together and again dancing at night.\"\n\nFurthermore, another source told People: \"They said hi briefly when she arrived at the party.\n\n\"Kim and Tom barely even spoke at the party and barely even said hello.\"\n\nThe famous quarterback was previously married to supermodel Gisele Bündchen from 2009 to 2022.\n\nLONNIE WALKER\n\nIn May, fans theorized that the makeup mogul was dating NBA star Lonnie Walker, 24, after she was recorded sitting courtside at a Lakers/Warriors playoff game.\n\nIn a video that circled on the internet, Kim waved to fans in the crowd.\n\nThe poster captioned the clip with: \"Best Lakers game! Kim Kardashian stole the show.\"\n\nThey also added several hashtags which included #kimk and #lonniewalker.\n\nKardashian fans were quick to comment on the rumored romance.\n\nOne questioned: \"What makes you think she’s dating Lonnie Walker?\"\n\n\"I’m been thinking why all of a sudden she’s going to the Lakers games. She use to never go,\" pointed out another.\n\nA third commenter echoed the previous remark, writing: \"She's been at a lot of games lately.\""
