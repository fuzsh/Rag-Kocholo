        "text": "You never know what you’re going to get with Yeezy. If you missed it, the influential rapper-turned-fashion mogul, Kanye West, got married back in January 2023 to Australian YEEZY architect, Bianca Censori, a move that stunned the pop-culture world. For starters, Censori is in actuality one of West’s employees. Then there is the fact that the news which was first reported by TMZ, comes just two months after his divorce from Kim Kardashian was finalized. As you can imagine, focus has immediately turned Censori herelf as the world scrambles to learn exactly who is this young woman that Kanye West now calls wife?\n\nSo, who is Bianca Censori?\n\nOriginally hailing from Melbourne, Australia’s cultural capital, Censori appears to be a multi-talented creative, so in that regard, it seems logical that West would have taken her as his muse. Now, let’s be honest, romance in the office is not normally something that’s encouraged, but it seems that’s exactly what happened between Censori and her famous boss. To be clear, the 27-year-old holds the title of Head of Architecture at YEEZY, where she has been working since 2020. Though not much is known about her exact role, The Sydney Morning Herald managed to unearth a biography from Melbourne Design Week, which states: “Her work engages with philosophical, aesthetic, and cultural references: these tropes generate contextual frameworks in which she designs buildings and objects.”\n\nThere’s also her LinkedIn, which indicates that she previously worked as a student architect for Collingwood-based firm DP Toscano Architects, which is best known for producing the three-bedroom, single-level Duke Apartments. It’s understood that Censori also holds a bachelor’s and master’s degree from the University of Melbourne. Interestingly, where social media is concerned, Censori has recently uploaded some revealing outfits.\n\n“At YEEZY we were able to develop a Donda language, an aesthetic with Kanye, which has informed both of our design aesthetics,” Censori says. “The irony of primitive futurism is it’s actually the application of the present, and therefore will continue to adapt to what social, economical and political contexts dictate.”\n\nMarriage to Kanye West\n\nNow, as mentioned before, news of West’s marriage to Censori arrived just two months after the finalization of his divorce from international reality star and SKIMS founder Kim Kardashian. If you need a reminder, the break up that led to the split was as bitter as it was public, which is sad when one considers that they were married for six years and have four children: daughter North, son Saint, daughter Chicago, and son Psalm. Since the separation, there have been several flashpoints including West’s very public meltdown over Kardashian’s romance with comedian Pete Davidson. Indeed, Kardashian herself hit back with a not-so-subtle jab. “I’m really in my quiet girl era, I don’t have much to say. Just much to do,” Kardashian posted, before adding: “Just remember, the black sheep usually turns into a goat. Keep doing you. People who want to see you win, will help you win. Remember that.”\n\nAre Kanye West and Bianca Censori actually married?"
