From Kim’s rumoured fling with Meek Mill and Kendall’s PDA with Bad Bunny at Coachella, to Kylie’s ‘secret’ dates with Dune’s Timothée Chalamet\n\nSTORYKate Berbano\n\nApr 28 , 2023\n\nBetween them, the Kardashian-Jenners have built a strong legion of followers, with each member boasting at least 200 million fans – and that’s just on Instagram. That’s a lot of peeps keenly awaiting news about your latest head-turning make-up look, impressive business move or – naturally – your latest love interest.\n\nAnd in this area over the years, the Kardashian-Jenner women have not been ones to disappoint. As 2023 gets well under way, Kylie, Kim, Kendall, Kourtney and Khloé all find themselves in different states of coupledom, with the exception of Khloé it seems. The Kardashian sisters seem to be revelling in marriage and singlehood, while the younger Jenners have been spicing things up with their new beaux.\n\nSo what’s new in the Kardashian-Jenners’ love lives?\n\n1. Kylie Jenner and Timothée Chalamet\n\nRumour has it that Hollywood heartthrob and Dune star Timothée Chalamet, 27, has been going out on secret dates with the youngest Jenner sister.\n\nKylie, 25, fuelled rumours further when her black Range Rover SUV was spotted at Chalamet’s Beverly Hills home recently, per TMZ.\n\nAccording to Entertainment Tonight, the Kylie Cosmetics founder and Chalamet are keeping it casual so far.\n\n2. Kendall Jenner and Bad Bunny\n\nKylie’s older sis, Kendall, has also seemingly begun a budding relationship with Puerto Rican rapper and Coachella 2023 headliner Bad Bunny, who recently moved to Los Angeles.\n\nThe new couple first caused a stir in February when they were seen kissing at a private club, per Harper’s Bazaar. Since then, the 27-year-old model and 29-year-old Grammy winner have gone on a horse-riding date, a double date with Kendall’s closest pals, Hailey and Justin Bieber, and a PDA-packed appearance at Coachella.\n\n3. Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker\n\nIt’s been a year since Kourtney Kardashian, 44, first tied the knot with drummer Travis Barker, 47, but fans are still being treated to juicy details from the big day.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Vogue and on a special episode of The Kardashians, the Poosh founder shared up-close-and-personal insights into their unofficial union in Las Vegas, their legal ceremony in Santa Barbara, California, and their wedding weekend in Portofino, Italy.\n\nThe exciting revelations include Kris’ sentimental gift for Kourtney, iPhone footage of the drunk pair getting hitched after the Grammys, and the special ceremony that Kourtney’s grandmother and Travis’ dad witnessed.\n\nThe word that best describes Mrs. Travis Barker’s married life? “Amazing,” she told Vogue.\n\n4. Kim Kardashian and Meek Mill?\n\nKim, meanwhile, has reportedly been out and about with hip-hop star Meek Mill. The 42-year-old Skims founder called it quits with Saturday Night Live alum Pete Davidson in August 2022.\n\nLong-time friends Kim and Mill have been seen together at high-profile events including the Super Bowl in February and the Oscars Vanity Fair party in March, per Capital FM.\n\nBack in 2020, however, Kim’s ex-husband Kanye “Ye” West accused the 35-year-old rapper of “untoward behaviour” after Kardashian and Mill’s professional meeting at a hotel in Los Angeles, reports Hello!\n\n5. Khloé Kardashian – single, but not ready to mingle?\n\nUnlike her four sisters, Khloé, 38, seems to have no immediate plans of dipping her toes in the dating pool in 2023.\n\nIn fact, she set things straight about being single on Twitter back in February – quashing the reconciliation rumours with NBA player and baby daddy Tristan Thompson.\n\n“Who has time for a man lol I have a six-month-old baby and [my daughter] True and I are sickly codependent on one another. Ha! I secretly love it,” she wrote on Twitter. “No but for real …. No man right now …. He’s in my prayers too ha!”\n\nThe Good American founder previously dated a private equity investor she met through her sister Kim in June 2022.\n\nWant more stories like this? Follow Style on Facebook, Instagram and YouTube.\n\nKylie set the internet alight when reports surfaced around a possible fling between the Kylie Cosmetics founder and heartthrob Timothée Chalamet – but she’s not the only one getting loved up in 2023\n\nKendall and Grammy-winning Bad Bunny have been spotted on dates, while Kourtney and Travis Barker have released more intimate details about their wedding, and Khloé is single and not ready to mingle"
