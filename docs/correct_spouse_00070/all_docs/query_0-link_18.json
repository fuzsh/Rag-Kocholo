        "text": "Kim Kardashian says she's tried to apologize to ex-husband Kris Humphries — but he doesn't want to hear from her.\n\nDuring part one of the highly publicized \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians: The Final Curtain\" Thursday on E!, the 40-year-old reality star and entrepreneur told host Andy Cohen that she regretted how she handled her breakup with Humphries, which came after just 72 days of marriage, and that she owes him an apology.\n\n\"I was so nervous to break up with someone,\" she recalled. \"I handled it totally the wrong way. I fully broke up with him in the worst way and I couldn’t — I just didn’t know how to deal. I learned so much from it.\"\n\nAfter a whirlwind romance, Kardashian married the former NBA star in August 2011 in a reported $10 million wedding that E! aired as a two-part TV special. By October 2011, she had filed for divorce.\n\nKardashian revealed that she tried repeatedly to reach out to Humphries to apologize for the pain she caused him. “I tried calling him for months,\" revealed the star. She also once ran into the basketball player at the Beverly Hills Hotel, but he wouldn't speak to her.\n\n\"I saw him and all of his friends got up from the table, we had the tables next to each other,\" she said. \"All of his friends got up and said hi to me and he just literally looked at me and, like, wouldn’t even speak to me.\"\n\nKardashian admitted she had \"cold feet\" the night before the pair's televised wedding. She forced herself to walk down the aisle to avoid being called a \"runaway bride.\"\n\nWhen Cohen asked if she partially went through with wedding just for the show, she agreed.\n\n\"I will say because I was pressured. I felt like I was going to let everyone down,\" she said.\n\nDuring the couple's honeymoon in Italy, she knew for sure she'd \"made the wrong decision.\"\n\nIn February 2021, Kardashian filed for divorce from her third husband, rapper Kanye West. The former couple share four children: North, 8, Saint, 5, Chicago, 3, and Psalm, 2. (The reality star was also previously married to producer Damon Thomas from 2000 until 2004.)\n\nHumphries opened up about how his brief marriage to Kardashian affected his basketball career, in a candid 2019 essay he penned for The Players' Tribune.\n\n“I was playing at Madison Square Garden for the first time after my marriage ended, and I was getting booed so loud that it was crazy. I’m talking feel-it-in-your-bones booed. I wasn’t Kris Humphries anymore. I wasn’t a real person. I was that guy,\" wrote the former New Jersey Nets player, who appeared several times on \"KUWTK.\"\n\nThough the athlete knew some fans saw him as a fame-seeker, he insisted his feelings for Kardashian were \"100% real.\" He also said he went into a \"dark place\" after their marriage fell apart.\n\n\"It’s never easy to go through the embarrassment of something like that — with your friends, with your family,\" wrote Humphries. \"But when it plays out so publicly, in front of the world, it’s a whole other level. It was brutal.\"\n\nKardashian also opened up about her divorce to West during Thursday's reunion, saying \"I wish I was married only once,\" referring to their marriage.\n\n\"My marriage to Kanye and my kids is so real... lots of love,\" she explained. \"That to me was my first real marriage.\"\n\nWhen Cohen asked what led to their divorce, she declined to answer.\n\n\"I honestly don't think I would even say it here on TV, but it was not one specific thing that happened on either part. It was just a general difference of opinions on a few things that led to this decision,\" she said. \"In no way would I want someone to think that I didn't give it my all or not really try. We have four kids. There's nothing that parents would want more, or kids want more, than to see their parents together.\"\n\nOn where they stand today, she said they have an amazing co-parenting relationship and that she will forever be Kanye's \"biggest fan.\"\n\n\"He is the father of my kids,\" she added. \"Kanye will always be family.\"\n\nPart two of \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians: The Final Curtain\" airs Sunday at 9 p.m. ET on E!."
