        "text": "Travis Barker had a lovely, yet partially NSFW birthday post for his wife, Kourtney Kardashian Barker.\n\nThe Blink-182 drummer celebrated the TV personality's birthday on April 18 with a message shared to his Instagram and a recap of their lives together in photos — with a surprising intimate glimpse of Kardashian Barker in the last slide.\n\nThe pic showed Kardashian Barker squatting over a toilet while wearing a black dress with heels, and the post raised eyebrows enough for Kardashian Barker’s sister, Kylie Jenner, to comment, “Last pic for me.”\n\nFans of the couple have witnessed milestones in their relationship along the way — like the moment they got engaged in 2021 to tying the knot in 2022 and welcoming their first child together in 2023.\n\nThe pair have come a long way from just being friends. After living in the same Calabasas neighborhood for years, their relationship evolved during the lockdown phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"He was one of my closest friends for probably eight years. We used to work out together all the time,\" Kardashian Barker said in the premiere episode of \"The Kardashians\" in 2022.\n\nBut after one thing led to another, she said, \"We fell in love and now he's my boyfriend.\"\n\nThis is what Kardashian Barker and Barker have said about their whirlwind romance and its years-long build-up, in their own words.\n\n2022: Kourtney Kardashian makes the first move on Travis Barker\n\nOn \"The Kardashians,\" Kardashian said she had been interested in Barker long before they started dating. “I was definitely always attracted to Travis,\" she said, adding that her friends encouraged her to \"hook up\" with him.\n\nIn the lead-up to their relationship, Kardashian said she spent a year single and focusing on herself.\n\nDuring lockdown in 2020, Kardashian finally started flirting with Barker. Kardashian said he seemed interested: “He asked me to watch a movie,\" she recalled on \"The Kardashians.\"\n\nBut it took a while for their first kiss to happen. \"The whole movie, he didn’t make a move. He was taking a long time. The movie was over. We started another movie. I was like, ‘I don’t have time for this,'\" Kardashian said.\n\nFinally, Kardashian made the first move, and leaned in for the kiss.\n\nFebruary 2021: They become Instagram official\n\nIn Jan. 2021, Barker and Kardashian posted photos from the same location in Palm Springs, prompting speculation about whether they were a couple.\n\nIn Feb. 2021, Kardashian shared a simple photo of her holding hands with Barker in a car on Instagram. Barker shared the photo to his story and commented with a heart.\n\nA few days after going public on Instagram, Barker shared a photo of a handwritten note that Kardashian had written him to his Instagram Story. The note read, “To lots of fun adventures, may we destroy each other completely. Love, Kourtney.”\n\nMarch 2021: Travis Barker says Kourtney Kardashian is a 'great mom'\n\nIn March 2021, Barker went on \"The Drew Barrymore Show\" and spoke about his relationship with Kardashian — and why he likes dating another parent.\n\nBarker shares stepdaughter Atiana, 25, son Landon, 20, and daughter Alabama, 18, and with his ex-wife, Shanna Moakler.\n\nKardashian shares three children with her ex-boyfriend, Scott Disick: son Mason, 14, daughter Penelope, 11, and son Reign, 9.\n\n\"Up until now, I would date girls who didn't have kids and I would find it kind of hard because I think they would have trouble understanding like, 'Why don't you want to go to dinner every night with me?' or 'Why don't you want to see me every night?'\" Barker said.\n\n“And now, I’m spending time with a woman who’s a great mom, who’s a great friend and you don't have to worry about any of those things. It just comes natural,” he continued. “It’s a maturity thing.\"\n\nSeptember 2021: Travis Barker says Kourtney Kardashian gives him 'strength' and helped him overcome his fear of flying\n\nBy fall 2021, Barker and Kardashian had posted photos from a number of places together, including Italy and a trip to the Utah desert.\n\nWhile speaking to Nylon magazine in September 2021, Barker said that Kardashian helped him overcome his fear of flying. Barker was critically injured after surviving a 2008 plane crash that killed four people.\n\n“I made a deal with her that she had just said to me, ‘I would love to do so much traveling with you. I want to go to Italy with you. I want to go to Cabo with you. I want to go to Paris with you. I want to go to Bora Bora with you,’\" he told the outlet. \"And I said, ‘Well, when the day comes you want to fly, I’m telling you I’ll do it with you. I would do anything with you. And just give me 24 hours’ notice.’ And that’s what she did.”\n\nBarker noted that the first trip they took to Mexico was \"the easiest ever\" because he had Kardashian by his side.\n\n\"Having something that gives me the strength and hope to be able to overcome things that were so traumatic in my life, it just says a ton,” he said. “She’s definitely that for me. I’m invincible when I’m with her. It’s like I never dreamed, I never even considered flying again.”\n\nOctober 2021: Travis Barker and Kourtney Kardashian get engaged\n\nIn the fall of 2021, Barker proposed to Kardashian at sunset on a beach in Montecito, California, surrounded by red roses.\n\nIn the third episode of Season One of \"The Kardashians,\" Barker shared what he was planning during the proposal in a text message to Kris Jenner, Kardashian's mom.\n\n“A year ago today, I fell in love with you. One night with you was all it took. You’ve been one of my best friends for years, I’ve admired you and adored you for so long, you’re the love of my life. Kourtney, I want to spend the rest of it with you. Will you marry me?”\n\nThe next day, Kardashian wrote on Instagram, \"I woke up all night thinking it was a dream.\"\n\nBefore Barker popped the question, he visited the grave of Kardashian's father, Robert Kardashian, to ask him for Kardashian's hand in marriage.\n\n“I was like, literally, I want to cry now,\" Jenner said in Episode Three when she heard the news. “It was so sweet and so tender.\"\n\nApril 2022: Barker and Kardashian Barker try to elope\n\nBarker and Kardashian tried to stage an impromptu wedding before the real one.\n\nAfter the 2022 Grammys in April 2022, which were held in Las Vegas, the couple stopped by a chapel. However, as Kardashian explained on an appearance on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live,\" they were unable to obtain a marriage license at 2 a.m. — the office opened at 8.\n\nStill, the couple went through with a ceremony. Kardashian posted the photos from the evening with a caption that read, \"Practice makes perfect.\"\n\n“We just did it anyways. It’s what’s in the heart,” Kardashian told Kimmel.\n\nDuring the same interview with Kimmel, Kim Kardashian said that she would’ve preferred advanced notice that she and Barker were headed to the chapel.\n\n“She put it in the group chat, like, ‘Oh, hey guys, and by the way, I got married last night,’” Kim Kardashian said. “I woke up to like a million texts.”\n\nMay 2022: They get married and celebrate their nuptials in Italy\n\nThe couple got legally married on May 15. Kardashian commemorated the occasion in a series of black-and-white photos of them driving a car that says, fittingly, “Just married” in the back.\n\nThe couple then headed to Italy for a multi-party wedding extravaganza. Kardashian’s gown had a veil depicting the Virgin Mary, inspired by one of Barker’s tattoos.\n\nKardashian Barker and Barker open up about wanting to start a family\n\nIn an early episode of \"The Kardashians,\" filmed before Kardashian and Barker got engaged, Kardashian was open about seeing a future with Barker.\n\n“Travis and I talk about a future together all the time,” Kardashian said on the show. \"The second we fell in love, we knew how different it was than anything either of us have had before.\"\n\nOnce they were sure they wanted to start a family together, Kardashian started her journey with in vitro fertilization, which they document on the show.\n\n“My doctor took us down this road of doing IVF, and it hasn’t been the most amazing experience,\" Kardashian said in Episode Two of Season One, explaining that the process has made her depressed.\n\n“I have everything in the world to be happy about,” she said. “I just feel a little bit off, not like myself, super moody and hormonal. I’m a lunatic half the time,\" she said.\n\nLuckily, she had her then-fiancé by her side.\n\nMay 2022: They make their Met Gala debut\n\nIn 2022, Kardashian and Barker attended their first Met Gala by each others' sides. While Kardashian's sisters are known for their Met Gala looks, this marked the first event Kardashian attended — and Barker, too.\n\nThe PDA-loving couple shared a few kisses on the red carpet, while wearing clothes for the theme \"Gilded Glamour.\"\n\nThe couple's outfits, designed by Thom Brown, were in conversation. “I’m basically like a deconstructed version of [Travis’s] outfit,” Kardashian told La La Anthony on Vogue‘s red carpet.\n\nSeptember 2022: Kourtney Kardashian Barker talks about taking Travis Barker's last name\n\nDuring a September 2022 visit to TODAY, Kardashian Barker opened up about taking Barker's last name, saying that it was a \"given.\"\n\n\"It wasn’t a thought,” she said of the name change. “So now my middle name is Kardashian.”\n\nMay 2023: Kourtney Kardashian Barker stops IVF\n\nIn the Season Three premiere of “The Kardashians,\" Kardashian Barker revealed that she and Barker are “officially done with IVF\" and is leaving family planning in God’s hands.\n\n“I would love a baby more than anything but I just really believe in what God has in store for us,” she said. “If that’s a baby, then I believe that it will happen.”\n\nJune 2023: Kardashian Barker announces she's pregnant\n\nOn June 16, Kardashian Barker revealed she was pregnant with her husband's child when she attended a Blink 182 concert and held up a sign that read, \"Travis I’m pregnant,” in the audience.\n\nIn the Instagram clip, you can see Barker being completely elated by the news. After he reads the sign, he rushes off the stage to give his wife a hug and a couple of kisses.\n\nSeptember 2023: Kardashian Barker has ‘urgent fetal surgery’\n\nIn September 2023, Barker's Blink-182 band worried fans when they announced the drummer had to rush back home in the middle of their tour to deal with an “urgent family matter.\"\n\nA few days later, Kardashian Barker took to Instagram to reveal she underwent “urgent fetal surgery\" to save her baby's life.\n\n\"I am eternally grateful to my husband who rushed to my side from tour to be with me in the hospital and take care of me afterwards, my rock,\" she captioned the post. \"And to my mom, thank you for holding my hand through this.\"\n\n“God is great,” Barker commented on the post with the praying hands emoji.\n\nNovember 2023: Kardashian Barker gives birth\n\nIn November 2023, the couple welcomed their first child together, son Rocky Thirteen Barker.\n\nFans didn't learn their son's name until December 2023, when the couple shared some pics of Rocky online and wrote his name in the caption.\n\nFebruary 2024: Travis Barker shares steamy pics with wife Kourtney Kardashian Barker on Valentine's Day\n\nOn Valentine’s Day, the drummer shared a slideshow filled with steamy photos of him and his lady. Among the snaps included in the Feb. 14 post are him holding Kardashian Barker as she wraps her legs around him, rose petals making a heart shape on a bed, the reality star in red lingerie and more.\n\n“Happy Valentine’s Day my beautiful wife,” the musician captioned the post.\n\nKardashian Barker also commented on the tribute, adding, “Happy Valentine’s Day husband of my dreams.”\n\nApril 2024: Barker celebrates Kardashian Barker 45th birthday with a NSFW photo\n\nOn April 18, Barker celebrated Kardashian Barker's birthday by sharing a number of silly photos of his wife on Instagram. However, the last slide grabbed everyone's attention, which was a pic of Kardashian Barker squatting over a toilet in a black dress and heels.\n\nHe captioned the post, \"Happy Birthday to my beautiful wife, soulmate and best friend forever. I love you, I love our life together. Thank you for being the most amazing wife a person could ask for. Here’s to many more years of adventures together ❤️‍🔥.\"\n\nKardashian Barker commented, \"Husband of my dreams. I love our life!!\""
