        "text": "This week it was revealed that Kim Kardashian and Kanye West renewed their vows earlier this year on their fifth wedding anniversary.\n\nOn the latest episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Kim spoke about how she had originally planned it as a surprise, before being forced to tell Kanye after finding out he had also made plans.\n\nWhile the pair seem pretty rock solid, that’s not to say it’s all plain sailing, as earlier this month, the show showed Kanye taking umbrage with some of Kim’s clothing choices – namely that Met Gala dress.\n\nHe said: ‘You are my wife, and it affects me when pictures are too sexy.’ Kim, however, seems unfazed, continuing to post her at-times scant pictures on Instagram.\n\nSo, to kill time while we patiently wait for Kanye’s Jesus Is King album, we’re taking a look at their relationship timeline and who Kim was married to before Kanye.\n\nWho was Kim Kardashian married to before Kanye West?\n\nKim has been married twice before, proving the old adage that ‘third time lucky’ can ring true.\n\nThe TV star’s first marriage was to music producer Damon Thomas, whom she eloped back in 2000, with when she was just 19.\n\nKim and Kanye originally met during this time, but despite Kanye doting on the then-socialite, nothing happened between them.\n\nKim and Damon lasted three years together and they split in 2003.\n\nFollowing their split, Kim briefly dated Ray J (yes, from the sex tape), former Nickelodeon star Nick Cannon, NFL stars Reggie Bush and Miles Austin.\n\nAnd then, in 2011, Kim started dating – and briefly married – NBS player, Kris Humphries.\n\nDespite their lavish and fairy tale wedding, the dust barely settled on their marriage certificate before they called it a day, just 72 days later.\n\nOnce again, Kim and Kanye crossed paths during this time and began dating before the divorce had finalised.\n\nKanye’s previous relationships include designer Alexis Phifer as well as actress and model Amber Rose.\n\nHow did Kim Kardashian and Kanye West meet and when did they get together?\n\nThe pair met in the early 2000s and had various (platonic) run ins before they made it official, in 2012.\n\nIn 2008, West recruited his future wife-to-be in a hip hop puppet show called Alligator Boots.\n\nIf you haven’t heard of it, it’s because it didn’t exactly kick off…\n\nKanye first appeared on Keeping Up With the Kardashains in 2010 when he met Kim and Kourtney in New York.\n\nAt the time, Kim said they had ‘been good friends for a long time.’\n\nDespite meeting over the years, Kim and Kanye officially started dating back in 2012, while Kim’s divorce from Kris was still finalising.\n\nIt was in 2012 that Kanye first admitted his love publicly for Kim in his song Cold.\n\nHe rapped: ‘And I’ll admit, I had fell in love with Kim / Around the same time she had fell in love with him / Well that’s cool, baby girl, do ya thang.’\n\nBy December, Kim was pregnant with North, who was born in the following June.\n\nThey were engaged by October 2013 after Kanye publicly proposed at San Francisco’s AT&T baseball stadium in an extra AF proposal.\n\nThey married in Italy in 2014 and have since had three more children together, Chicago West, Saint West and Psalm West.\n\nAnd the rest, as they say, is history!\n\nMORE : Kanye West parties with Kim Kardashian at gala as Jesus Is King album release pushed back"
