        "text": "Kim Kardashian says her mom Kris Jenner’s divorce from her late dad, Robert Kardashian Sr., helped her to navigate her own split from ex-husband Kanye West.\n\n“The Kardashians” star, 43, filed for divorce from the rapper after seven years of marriage in 2021. The couple shares four children: North, 10, Saint, 7, Chicago, 5, and Psalm, 4.\n\nGracing the cover of GQ’s 28th annual Men of the Year issue, the Skims founder said that her parents made her and her siblings feel “loved and heard” during their divorce, prompting her to do the same for her children.\n\n“I did think about how my parents handled it with us,” she told the publication. “I just remember them being open…Ultimately, what matters is that kids feel loved and heard.”\n\n“You want to be sensitive because they’re just kids, and it’s hard to go through no matter what age,” she added.\n\nKim’s parents divorced in 1991 following Kris’ infidelity, which put an end to their 13-year marriage.\n\nDuring their ill-fated union, the pair welcomed, Kourtney, 44, Kim, Khloé, 39, and Robert Jr., 36.\n\n“You have to make sure that you only go to a level that they can understand. It’s okay to show a vulnerable side. You never go to a negative side,” Kim shared.\n\n“I remember thinking, Please, Lord, don’t let them be getting a divorce. I never had an inkling that it would happen, but I knew that was what they were going to tell us. I felt it.”\n\nAfter the demise of her own marriage to the “Jesus Walks” rapper, Kim said she turned to therapy to help navigate the split in the best way for her kids.\n\n“I do have a therapist that only deals in child psychology that I talk to to get parenting tips and advice,” she said.\n\n“Sometimes I feel challenged by parenting. But I have the best group of friends and we talk about everything together, so that to me is therapy. I hit the lottery, the f–king Mega Ball of friends.”\n\nOne of the billionaire’s best pals, Allison Statter, told the publication just how difficult it was for Kim to go through a divorce — her third — in the public eye.\n\n“I know how scared she was to do it,” Statter said. “Cause deep down inside she wanted her family to stay together. And because she was like: ‘I don’t know what life is going to be like on the other side of this.’ I was just so proud of her.”\n\nElsewhere, Kim’s sister Khloé said that Kim’s confidence has had a major boost since she became single again.\n\nFor more Page Six reality TV updates…\n\nListen to our “Virtual Reali-Tea” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\n“Not that she wasn’t confident before,” the Good American co-founder said. “But it’s a different assurance that she has in herself. She knows she can do it on her own.”\n\n“She knows the power that she has within herself, as opposed to thinking the power was in someone else’s hands,” the mom of two added."
