        "text": "Kim Kardashian isn't opposed to getting remarried. The 42-year-old reality star and Skims mogul opened up about her current relationship status and hopes for the future with Gwyneth Paltrow on the \"Goop Podcast\" on Dec. 27. During the conversation, Kardashian admitted to being a romantic who is open to various possibilities of expanding her family in the future. \"I have this like fantasy in my head like 'fourth time is the charm.'\"\n\nAfter a two-year-long process, the Skkn founder finally settled her divorce from Kanye West in November. The pair was married for seven years before their separation. Before West, Kardashian was married to Damon Thomas and Kris Humphries. Following her latest divorce, Kardashian was in a relationship with Pete Davidson that ended in August. Since then, Kardashian has been happily single.\n\n\"I would want a marriage but I'm so happy to take my time,\" Kardashian said. \"I really do want to be single for a few years.\" She echoed the same sentiment in another recent podcast appearance on \"Angie Martinez IRL,\" in which she opened up about what it's like to coparent with West. Despite the very public challenges, Kardashian expressed gratitude for her four children and their father.\n\nIn her chat with Paltrow, Kardashian also alluded to the potential of having more kids in the future, and said that it would have to be a joint decision with a hypothetical partner. As for now, she is enjoying every bit of her life as a single mother and businesswoman. \"I'm on a good solo mission right now,\" she said, \"and I'm going to soak up every minute of it.\""
