        "text": "We’re taking a look the famous family and how all the Kardashian-Jenner kids are connected.\n\nGetting their start on reality TV, the Kardashian-Jenner clan has grown into an empire that only continues to grow as they have more kids and more relationships.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the Kardashian-Jenner family tree.\n\nWhere it all began\n\nRobert Kardashian, a powerful defense attorney and lawyer for O.J. Simpson during his 1995 murder trial, married momager Kris Jenner, then Kris Houghton, in 1978.\n\nTogether they welcomed four children — Kourtney, Kim, Khloé and Robert Kardashian Jr. — before divorcing in 1991.\n\nRobert died of cancer in 2003 at age 59.\n\nKris remarries\n\nKris moved on from her first husband with Olympic gold medalist Caitlyn Jenner, then known as Bruce Jenner.\n\nThey tied the knot in 1991 and welcomed two daughters together: Kendall and Kylie Jenner.\n\nKris was Caitlyn’s third wife. The former decathlete was previously married to Linda Thompson, with whom she shares famous sons Brandon and Brody. Caitlyn and Linda divorced in 1986.\n\nBefore Linda, Caitlyn was married to Chrystie Crownover from 1972 to 1981, with whom she shares two kids, Cassandra and Burt.\n\nUnfortunately, the third time was not the charm for Caitlyn, and she divorced Kris in 2015 — the same year she came out as transgender.\n\nKourtney’s family grows\n\nKourtney, the oldest of the Kardashian sisters, was the first to welcome her own kids into the world.\n\nShe and now-ex-boyfriend Scott Disick share three children: Mason, Penelope and Reign. Her husband, Travis Barker, also has three children — stepdaughter Atiana De La Hoya, daughter Alabama Barker and son Landon Barker — with ex-wife Shanna Moakler.\n\nKourtney and Travis announced in June 2023 that they are growing their family and expecting a baby together.\n\nKim expands the family\n\nKim went through two marriages before settling with her current husband, rapper Kanye West — although their relationship is on the rocks.\n\nShe was previously married to Damon Thomas from 2000 to 2004 and Kris Humphries from 2011 to 2013.\n\nShe and Kanye welcomed their first child, daughter North, in June 2013. They tied the knot the next year.\n\nKim and Kanye went on to have three other children together: Saint, Chicago and Psalm.\n\nBut things went south for the power couple in January 2021 when Page Six broke the news that Kim and Kanye were heading for divorce.\n\nRob becomes a father\n\nRob welcomed his first child — daughter Dream — with Blac Chyna in 2016 before their relationship ended.\n\nChyna, on the other hand, was already a mother. She shares son Cairo rapper Tyga, who happens to be Kylie’s ex-boyfriend.\n\nRob and Chyna have had a contentious relationship, but reached a custody agreement in December 2020.\n\nKhloé has two kids of her own\n\nKhloé welcomed her first child, True, with ex-boyfriend and NBA star Tristan Thompson in April 2018.\n\nThompson made headlines after he hooked up with multiple women while Khloé was pregnant with their child. Despite the drama, Khloé and Thompson continue to co-parent baby True.\n\nThe former couple then welcomed son Tatum via surrogate over the summer of 2022.\n\nThompson is also father to sons Prince and Theo, whom he shares with Jordan Craig and Maralee Nichols, respectively.\n\nKylie becomes a mom\n\nKylie surprised fans when she revealed that she would also be having a baby the same year as Khloé.\n\nShe and on-again, off-again-boyfriend Travis Scott welcomed daughter Stormi in February 2018. The pair then welcomed their second child, a son named Aire, in February 2022.\n\nAnd while Kendall doesn’t have any children yet, the family tree will undoubtedly continue to grow."
