        "text": "On the latest episode of Hulu’s The Kardashians, Kim Kardashian spills more of her feelings about ex-husband Kanye West.\n\nAt the outset of season three’s second episode, Kardashian continues her tearful conversation with mom Kris Jenner regarding her exasperation with West due to his well-publicized online antics and the accusations he’s made about their family. “It’s the hardest feeling to watch someone you really loved and you have a family with just be so different than who you knew,” Kardashian says of the rapper in a confessional.\n\nIn the talk with her mom, Kardashian says her ex-husband may need to hit “rock bottom” in order to grow. “That’s his journey that he needs to figure out on his own,” Kardashian tells Jenner, adding, “I used to run around and call everyone behind his back, and be like, ‘It’s gonna be OK, it’s gonna be OK, don’t worry. Just give him another chance.’ I used to spend hours and hours and hours of my day to be the cleanup crew. I just don’t have that energy.”\n\nIn the premiere episode of season three, Kardashian opened up for the first time about the extent to which she has suffered mentally from West—revealing she’s had days full of anxiety attacks and being on the verge of tears—and her conflicting desires between speaking out against West in her own defense, but not creating a rift between him and their four kids: North, 9, Saint, 7, Chicago, 5, and Psalm, 4.\n\n“Even through all the craziness of things that Kanye says about us, like, I never comment, I never post,” Kardashians says in the episode. “I have to sit here and not say anything ever because I know one day my kids will appreciate that and I know that’s the best thing for them.”\n\n“And by the way, I’m the one where shit can be going down and I get in the car and every day the kids want to blast Dad’s music,” she later adds. “I’m like, ‘He’s the best! Yeah!’ And I put it on and we’re singing along and inside I’m like dying because I will be his biggest cheerleader to them forever and one day they will see for themselves and I will answer whatever they want me to.”"
