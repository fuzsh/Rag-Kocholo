        "text": "The basketball star was allegedly angry at his ex-wife for making a reference to him being gay on the latest episode of The Kardashians\n\nKim Kardashian's ex-husband Kris Humphries is said to be angry at his ex-wife for her allegedly questioning his sexuality once again during the latest episode of The Kardashians.\n\nKim Kardashian reveals Kanye West said her career is 'over' after Marge Simpson 'dress fail'\n\nAccording to RADAR, the NBA basketball star didn't take to kindly to Kim joking that \"she hadn't been to a gay wedding since her second wedding\". Humphries and Kardashian were famously married for 72 days in 2011.\n\nIn the episode, Kim tells her Scott Disick and Chris Reda that she \"loves a gay wedding\" adding \"I haven't been to a gay wedding since my second wedding\".\n\nAccording to an insider close to Humphries, he was mad at her for saying that it resurface the media and fans speculation once again that the reason their divorce fell apart was because he was gay.\n\nBack in 2011, Humphries denied his sexuality being the reason the two divorced after fans claimed that Kim began to question him being heterosexuality after their Italian honeymoon.\n\nAccording to a source close to Humphries: \"He does not understand why Kim continues to think he’s gay. It’s infuriating\".\n\n\"Kim needs to move on, just like he has. She really should not drag his name through the mud after all of these years\".\n\nKardashian filed for divorce from Humphries after 72 days of marriage in October 2011. He later filed for an annulment of the marriage based on fraud or a legal separation rather than a divorce.\n\nShe later married Kanye West in May 2014, recently filing for divorce from West after seven years of marriage. The two have four children together – North, Saint, Chicago, Psalm."
