        "text": "Just 10 weeks after their lavish, made-for-TV wedding and less than a month after the wedding special aired, reality starlet Kim Kardashian is canceling her marriage to NBA player Kris Humphries.\n\nThe “Keeping Up With the Kardashians’’ star filed for divorce yesterday, citing irreconcilable differences. “I hope everyone understands this was not an easy decision,’’ she said in a statement. “I had hoped this marriage was forever but sometimes things don’t work out as planned.’’\n\nThe filing in Los Angeles County Superior Court provided few details, other than to state the couple have a prenuptial agreement that will dictate how they divide up their assets. Kardashian is asking that both sides pay their own attorneys’ costs and that a judge terminate Humphries’s rights to spousal support.\n\nKardashian, 31, and Humphries, 26, were wed Aug. 20 in a star-studded ceremony in Montecito, Calif.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was the first marriage for Humphries, who last played for the New Jersey Nets, and the second for Kardashian, who was married to music producer Damon Thomas from 2000 to 2004.\n\nSimpson pregnant\n\nJessica Simpson has confirmed the obvious - she’s having a baby. The 31-year-old entertainer tweeted a photo of herself yesterday dressed as a mummy for Halloween, holding her baby bump with the words, “It’s true. I am going to be mummy.’’ It will be the first child for Simpson and her fiance, Needham native Eric Johnson.\n\nO’Reilly book deal\n\nFox News host Bill O’Reilly has signed on to write two more books, including a presidential biography. Publisher Henry Holt and Co. announced O’Reilly’s plans yesterday. It says the focus of the presidential biography will be revealed later. Details of the other book haven’t been released. O’Reilly also has a memoir called “Bolder and Fresher’’ that’s still in production. The best-selling author’s first work of history, “Killing Lincoln,’’ came out this fall. It topped The New York Times nonfiction hardcover list and has sold nearly 1 million copies.\n\nShe cheated herself\n\n\"I never realized what a true genius she was.\" - Amy Winehouse's father, Mitch, after listening to \"Lioness: Hidden Treasures,\" 12 tracks of previously unreleased and rare recordings that will be released next month.\n\nGet The Big To-Do\n\nYour guide to staying entertained, from live shows and outdoor fun to the newest in museums, movies, TV, books, dining, and more.\n\nEnter Email"
