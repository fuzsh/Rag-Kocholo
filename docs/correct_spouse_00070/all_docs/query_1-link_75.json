        "text": "Despite having a number of failed relationships under her belt, Kim Kardashian has insisted she still believes in true love.\n\nThe 43-year-old has been married and divorced three times, but shocked fans when she revealed she hasn't given up on finding Mr Right during an episode of The Kardashians. \"It's so fun. Falling in love is like the most fun thing on the planet,\" she told the cameras.\n\nKim's mum Kris Jenner also sent the rumour mill into overdrive when she recently teased her eldest child could one day make it down the aisle again. However, relationship expert Louella Alderson believes Kim won't tie the knot with just anyone.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE: Kanye West's friend claims marriage to Bianca Censori won't last 'more than 12 months'\n\nSpeaking exclusively to The Mirror, she said: \"There is definitely a chance that Kim Kardashian could get married for a fourth time, but it seems like she is in no rush to do so. After three marriages, it's understandable that she may have reservations about tying the knot again, so if she did marry again, it would likely have to be with someone very special.\"\n\nSpeaking about who it would take to make Kim tie the knot again, Louella said: \"Kim appears to have done a lot of personal growth and reflection since her last marriage to Kanye West. As a mother of four and a successful businesswoman, she may not see the need or desire to get married again any time soon, and it would probably take someone who was truly special and a great fit for her to change her mind.\n\n\"She will likely put her children's needs and happiness first and ensure that any future relationship is stable and committed before considering marriage again. Bringing new people into her children's lives in such a permanent way is a big decision and she will likely want to make sure it's the right one.\"\n\nHowever, Louella said it's possible Kim will be wary about marriage. \"With a track record of three marriages already, it's possible that Kim may feel hesitant or reluctant to get married again, feeling like she has 'been there, done that' in terms of weddings,\" she said.\n\nThe relationship expert added: \"However, she's a romantic at heart and may not want to completely close the door on the idea of finding true love and getting married in the future. But at this point in her life, it seems like she is content with focusing on herself, her children and her businesses rather than actively searching for someone she could marry.\"\n\nKim is believed to be dating Odell Beckham Jr, with the pair seemingly confirming their romance at the Vanity Fair Oscars afterparty. They were seen laughing and joking together at the glitzy bash.\n\nAmid the relationship rumours. Kim's mum Kris teased the potential for her daughter to get married. When asked if either Kris, Kim or Kendall Jenner could be getting married soon, the momager teased to People magazine: \"All of us are having fun, and we have no marriage plans â€” yet.\"\n\nLouella Alderson is a relationship expert who spoke to The Mirror on behalf of the So Syncd dating app."
