It's basically a several year contract with an option for extension, states her pay per year, her expense accounts, what she gets at the end of the contract, what happens if either of them want to cut it off early, the fact he's got to get some, and so on and so forth.\n\nI understand defending yourself from possible bad choices (such as the wrong spouse) but a marriage contract as something that is 'sacred' shouldn't have an expiration date when the wife gets old and supposedly not pretty.\n\nShe's nothing more than a trophy and is paraded around as such and given positions in his companies for no other reason than the fact she --- ahem, is married to him.\n\nSteven Tindall\n\nMY 2 cents for what it's worth.\n\nI'm in the same boat as TCG in that IF, and mind you that is a BIG if, I wanted to get married to a really hot guy I'd have to go through nine kinds of hell for it; while these \"celebrities\" throw away something that should be treasured is a bigger affront to the sanctity of marriage than anything I can think of.\n\nI'm trying to think of this other little blond pop tart that was married in Vegas for like less than a week possibly even less than 24hrs.\n\nI know MOST folks on the message boards support marriage equality and to those I say Thank You. To the others I say try to see it from a non religious perspective and think of it as a right of EVERY CITIZEN of the United States.\n\nAbraham spalding\n\nI'm reminded of another Heinlein quote:\n\nQuote:\n\nMust be a yearning deep in human heart to stop other people from doing as they please. Rules, laws — always for other fellow. A murky part of us, something we had before we came down out of trees, and failed to shuck when we stood up. Because not one of those people said: Please pass this so that I won't be able to do something I know I should stop. Nyet, tovarishchee, was always something they hated to see neighbors doing. Stop them for their own good.\n\nSteven Tindall\n\nand so as not to COMPLETELY derail the thread.

I'd be fine with that.\n\nI think this is the best way to go legally. It balances the first amendment right of a religion to believe what it wants (the so-called free exercise clause0 with the fourteenth amendment right of equal protection under the law. Not only that but it makes both sides unhappy which is the true definition of a successful compromise. :)\n\nthunderspirit\n\n2 people marked this as a favorite.\n\nbugleyman wrote:\n\nMeanDM wrote:\n\nI'm a Republican too, and I don't get it either.

I don't believe, however, that the Democrats are currently driven by the fringe to nearly the extent that the Republicans are. YMMV.\n\nKryzbyn\n\nI dunno that I like the 'civil union' verbiage. It almost seems like we'd jsut be humoring gays. \"They aren't really married, they just have a civil union.\" Just more divisive poison.

Marriage or bust, I say.\n\nUnder the system that TCG is talking about and that many Constitutional scholars advocate, marriage would not exist as a legal construct. There would be more like a legal partnership that extends the same rights to couples and families regardless of whether that are homosexual or heterosexual, married or living together. Remember that there are many heterosexual couples that are just as discriminated against as gay couples simply because they make a choice not to go through the formality of getting married. It used to not be much of an issue because most states recognized common law marriage, but even that is only recognized in D.C. and about ten states anymore.\n\nKryzbyn\n\n1 person marked this as a favorite.\n\nI understand that.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I nominate \"Marriage\" to be the name of such a civil union.

Frankly I think most of the problem stems from mixing the religious with the legal in the first place...\n\nTiny Coffee Golem\n\nKryzbyn wrote:\n\nI dunno that I like the 'civil union' verbiage.

But historically \"separate, but equal\" isn't.\n\n1 to 50 of 111 << first < prev | 1 | 2 | 3 | next > last >>\n\nCommunity / Forums / Gamer Life / Off-Topic Discussions / Kim Kardashian & Kris Humphries: What Went Wrong?
