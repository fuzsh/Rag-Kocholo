        "text": "Update January 5: Page Six is reporting that Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are “over” and “in settlement talks.” Kardashian has reportedly hired divorce attorney Laura Wasser to represent her, and West is currently living in his ranch in Wyoming as the couple “get things sorted out to separate and divorce,” a source told Page Six. West has reportedly grown uncomfortable by the Kardashians’ lifestyle and Kardashian has become tired of West’s “crazy shit,” the source said. Kardashian was also reportedly upset that West had only shown up to Kardashian’s 40th birthday celebration in October for one day. “He showed up late and left early, he wouldn’t appear in any of their Instagram shots. All he did was bring over the hologram of her father Robert Kardashian, then got out of there as fast as he could,” the source added, in a quote that will be studied for centuries to come. A reportedly major point of contention between the two is their $40 million Calabasas family home, with the source explaining that Kardashian owns “all the land and adjoining lots around the house” while West owns “the actual house.”\n\nThe alleged final straw, reported by Us Weekly, came last month amid conversations about divorcing. “They had a big fight in early December,” the source said. “Kanye blew up at Kim and she was really upset. Things between them don’t seem to have healed since that.”\n\nTMZ, meanwhile, is reporting that Kardashian and West are in marriage counseling and trying to repair their relationship. According to TMZ, Kardashian has had Wasser on retainer but has not yet filed for divorce, though the possibility of divorce is still on the table. The site confirms, however, that Kardashian and West have been living separately for “a few months.”\n\nDecember 15: Kim Kardashian and Kanye West’s marriage is going through some shifts, according to two recent reports. A source told E! Online the couple “are doing their own thing,” adding, “They spend a lot of time apart.” Now, given that E! airs Keeping Up With the Kardashians (for one final season, that is), there’s a nonzero chance said source is one Kris Jenner, but alas. Kardashian and West are “focused on the things that are important to them,” according to the source, including raising their four children along with their own “me time.” “She lets him go off and be who he is,” the source said of Kardashian’s current dynamic with West. “It is what it is.” E!’s report, published December 15, follows earlier reporting from People on December 11. A source told the magazine, “Kim has work and projects that are important to her, and Kanye has his. Their lives don’t overlap much.” The source went on to say Kardashian and West “very much live separate lives.”\n\nThe news comes after West was conspicuously absent from Kardashian’s island-getaway 40th birthday party. The party coincided with the final stretch of West’s controversial failed presidential run, but he did send his wife a hologram of her late father, Robert Kardashian. It wasn’t the first time West’s presidential bid got in the way of his relationship with Kardashian either. In July, West tweeted a slew of personal details about his relationship with Kardashian and their family, after claiming at a rally that he and Kardashian had once considered an abortion. Kardashian made a rare public statement on her husband’s mental health at the time, asking for “compassion and empathy.” Shortly after, a source told People Kardashian wanted to “save her marriage” and was “not happy about” his presidential run. By late August, People reported West had been spending more time with Kardashian and their children, but a source later told “Page Six” a divorce could still be on the table after West once again spoke about his views on abortion with Nick Cannon."
