        "text": "FROM the outside, Kim Kardashian looks like she has one of the most enviable lives in the world, filled with huge houses, expensive cars and designer clothes.\n\nBut the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star has had a string of bad luck when it comes to her relationships.\n\nIn a clip from a new episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Kim sobbed about her marriage to Kayne West coming to an end, saying: “I can’t do this anymore. I can’t.\"\n\nShe continued: \"I think he deserves someone that can support his every move and go to Wyoming to be with him and follow him everywhere.\n\nKim, who was previously married to Damon Thomas and Kris Humphries added: \"He deserves a wife who travels with him and is there for everything. I feel like a f**king failure, that it's, like, a third f***ing marriage. Yeah, I feel like a f***king loser.\"\n\nKim has claimed her first husband, Damon Thomas - who she was married to from 2000 to 2004 - was controlling and physically violent towards her.\n\nShe's also admitted to being high on ecstasy for their wedding day, when she was just 19 years old.\n\nHer next marriage in 2011, to Kris Humphries, lasted just 72 days.\n\nSo where did it all go wrong with Kim's three marriages?\n\nMarried while on ecstasy\n\nDamon Thomas\n\nIn 2000, when she was just 19 years old, Kim eloped with songwriter Damon Thomas - who was 10 years her senior.\n\nYears later, in an episode of KUWTK, she admitted to her sister Kourtney and her then partner, Scott Disick, that she married Damon \"while on ecstasy\".\n\nAlthough the marriage lasted four years, Damon was allegedly \"extremely controlling\" of Kim.\n\nShe has even claimed he physically abused her, something he's vehemently denied.\n\nKim has said: \"Damon decided what we would do and when we would do it. He was very much the king of the castle.\"\n\n“Damon told me not to leave the house unless I first told him when and where I was going.\n\n\"If Damon were not home, I was required to call him and ask permission to leave the house.\n\n“For example, he would not allow me to go to the mall alone, or with friends. He told me that he did not want men to have an opportunity to hit on me.\"\n\nHe's even reportedly the reason why Kim started getting cosmetic surgery, after he promised to make her \"perfect\" and pressured her into getting liposuction, paying $3,650 (£2,900) for the procedure.\n\nDamon then splashed more than $1,000 on further surgeries on Kim's body.\n\nThe controlling behaviour by Damon eventually turned physical, according to court documents filed during the divorce.\n\nThe Daily Mail reported: \"Thomas would punch her in the face, slam her against walls and throw her across the room, leaving her bruised and battered.\"\n\nThomas called the allegations \"very upsetting\" when they resurfaced in 2010.\n\nHe has claimed he was the \"victim\" in the relationship, and accused Kim of making up the allegations in a bid to get \"a lot of money\".\n\nHe also insists that Kim cheated on him, and he was the one to end their marriage.\n\nSpeaking to In Touch magazine, he let rip at Kim, saying she \"is obsessed with fame\".\n\nHe added: \"She can't write or sing or dance, so she does harmful things in order to validate herself in the media. That’s a fame whore to me.\"\n\n72-day marriage\n\nKris Humphries\n\nAmerican basketball player Kris was Kim's second husband - for a total of 72 days in 2011.\n\nThe wedding was lavish - even by Kim's standards - and cost $10 million, with the cake alone costing $20,000.\n\nAnd Kanye - who had been good friends with Kim for a long time - was even texting before the wedding, trying to convince her to not go through with it.\n\nMany still believe the wedding was a big publicity stunt, but Kris has insisted it was real - although described his experience as \"brutal and embarrassing\".\n\nIn an open essay for The Player's Tribune after his retirement from basketball, the former NBA player wrote: \"I should have known what I was getting into.\n\n\"I was definitely naive about how much my life was going to change.\"\n\nKris continued: \"The one thing that really bothers me is whenever people say my marriage was fake. There’s definitely a lot about that world that is not entirely real.\n\n\"But our actual relationship was 100% real. When it was clear that it wasn’t working... what can I say? It sucked.\"\n\nThe public nature of their relationship and subsequent divorce put a huge strain on his mental health, claimed Kris.\n\nHe admitted: \"It’s never easy to go through the embarrassment of something like that, with your friends, with your family... but when it plays out so publicly, in front of the world, it’s a whole other level.\n\n\"It was brutal.\"\n\nWhile Kris looked to get his marriage to Kim annulled in December 2011, it actually took until June 2013 before the divorce was legally finalised.\n\nConstant rows\n\nKanye West\n\nKim and Kanye got married in May 2014, in a lavish ceremony, lasting a whole weekend.\n\nGuests invited were told the wedding would take place in Paris. However, once they arrived, everyone was flown to Florence for the ceremony.\n\nThe rapper and reality star went on to have four children together, North, seven, Saint, five, Chicago, three, and two-year-old Psalm.\n\nAnd they renewed their vows in 2019.\n\nKim told Kanye: \"You are my husband. You are my best friend. My biggest believer and my one true love.\"\n\nBut she filed for divorce in February this year, and ditched her $1.3million wedding ring.\n\nIt came after The Sun revealed the couple were struggling with their relationship in quarantine: \"Kim and Kanye are arguing and at each other's throats during this pandemic.\n\n\"Kim is getting stir-crazy, as she's used to being on the go. It's also a lot of time alone with the kids for her.\"\n\nThen on July 22, 2020 Kanye claimed that he's been trying to divorce Kim for almost two years after she met Meek Mill at a hotel.\n\nIt emerged that the pair had a huge row in early December in which Kanye \"blew up\" at Kim.\n\nAnd the couple had been living apart and were showing signs of trouble for a significant period of time.\n\nInsiders told The Sun in the summer of 2020 that Kim wouldn't abandon Kanye until he gets help with his mental health, but she \"knew her marriage was over a long time ago\".\n\nThough the couple has had a nasty split, sources tell TMZ things have been as “amicable as a divorce can be.”\n\nKim is asking for joint legal and physical custody of the couple's four kids.\n\nSources told TMZ that Kanye is fine with the joint custody arrangement, and are committing to co-parenting together.\n\nDocuments say that there is a prenup and neither party is contesting it.\n\nSources dished to TMZ that they are already far along in reaching a property settlement agreement.\n\nLet's hope it's fourth time lucky for Kim..."
