        "text": "Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West are calling it quits.\n\nThe \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" star, 40, has filed for divorce from the \"Jesus is King\" musician, 43, following almost seven years of marriage, Kardashian West's rep Christy Welder confirms to USA TODAY.\n\nThe Associated Press reports Kardashian West filed for divorce in Los Angeles Superior Court. The filing was not immediately available.\n\nAccording to TMZ, which broke the news, Kardashian West is asking for joint legal and physical custody of the couple's four children: daughter North, 7, son Saint, 5, daughter Chicago, 3, and son Psalm, who turns 2 in May.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to West's reps for comment.\n\nKardashian West and West tied the knot in an over-the-top Italian ceremony in May 2014 after getting engaged on Kardashian's 33rd birthday in October 2013. Both events were captured on the long-running reality series \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians,\" which is set to air its final season in March.\n\nThis will mark Kardashian West's third divorce. She was previously married to music producer Damon Thomas (2000-2003) and NBA player Kris Humphries (2011- 2013), from whom she famously filed for divorce after only 72 days of marriage.\n\n'Heavy hearts': 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians' will end in 2021 after 14 years\n\nKanye West jokes about Kim Kardashian's ex Kris Humphries, says he got a $68M tax refund\n\nThe split of Hollywood's power couple comes on the heels of a rocky 2020.\n\nWest was diagnosed with COVID-19 mid-March at the onset of the pandemic. Kardashian West opened up about the daunting task of caring for her ailing husband in October.\n\n\"Kanye had it way at the beginning, when nobody really knew what was going on,\" Kardashian West said during her GRAZIA cover story interview. \"It was so scary and unknown. I had my four babies and no one else in the house to help.\"\n\nCOVID-19 and vaccine: Here's what Kim Kardashian West, Tom Hanks are saying\n\nIn July, West announced he was running for president, a political campaign that failed to gain much traction after a rocky start and an unhinged campaign rally in South Carolina.\n\nWest elicited concerns about his mental health during the political rally as he shouted without a microphone, cried and offered deeply personal statements about his family, including a revelation that the couple considered terminating their first pregnancy. He tearfully said Kardashian West fought to keep the unborn child, and gave birth to daughter North in 2013.\n\n\"So even if my wife were to divorce me after this speech, she brought North into the world, even when I didn't want to,\" West said on July 19. \"She stood up, and she protected that child.\"\n\nWest went on to send a barrage of worrisome tweets days after his presidential campaign rally, including a now-deleted tweet from July 22 that read, \"I been trying to get divorced since Kim met with Meek at the Warldolf (sic) for ‘prison reform.' \"\n\nDuring his tweet storm, West also suggested that he was resisting intervention efforts by Kardashian West, his mother-in-law Kris Jenner and medical professionals. He accused the Kardashian family of trying \"to lock me up.\"\n\nIn September of last year, West returned to Twitter to equate his record contract with Sony and Universal to \"modern day slave ships\" and declared that he wouldn't release any new music until he's released from his contract. He went on to release a 5-song classical project, \"Emmanuel,\" on Christmas Day.\n\nJennifer Anistonendorses Joe Biden, says it's 'not funny to vote for Kanye'\n\nKanye West campaign rally: Claims Harriet Tubman never 'freed the slaves,' tearfully discusses abortion\n\nIn late July, Kardashian West spoke on the importance of caring for those with mental illnesses amid West's public struggle with bipolar disorder.\n\n\"I understand Kanye is subject to criticism because he is a public figure and his actions at times can cause strong opinions and emotions,\" Kardashian West wrote in a lengthy Instagram statement on July 22. \"He is a brilliant but complicated person who on top of the pressures of being an artist and a black man, who experienced the painful loss of his mother, and has to deal with the pressure and isolation that is heightened by his bi-polar disorder. Those who are close with Kanye know his heart and understand his words some times do not align with his intentions.\"\n\nWest was hospitalized in November 2016 for a \"psychiatric emergency\" after police were called to his house by his personal doctor. The remaining dates on his Saint Pablo tour were canceled.\n\nThe rapper opened up about his mental health struggles and being placed in involuntary psychiatric hold during a 2019 interview with David Letterman. Saying he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder two years earlier, West explained what it was like to have a manic episode.\n\n“You feel everyone wants to kill you, you pretty much don’t trust anyone, and they have this moment where they handcuff you, they drug you, they put you on the bed, and they separate you from everyone you know,\" he said.\n\nIn December, West notably wasn't pictured when Kardashian West celebrated Christmas with the couple's children and her famous family.\n\nOpinion:Take Kanye West's illness more seriously than his presidential ambitions\n\nDespite trials and tribulations, the couple appeared to have happier times.\n\nIn June, West congratulated Kardashian West after she sold a stake in her beauty brand to Coty for $200 million.\n\n\"I am so proud of my beautiful wife Kim Kardashian West for officially becoming a billionaire,\" West tweeted on June 29. \"You’ve weathered the craziest storms and now God is shining on you and our family.\"\n\nIs Kim Kardashian West a billionaire? Kanye congratulates his wife after beauty brand sale\n\nIn October, West gifted Kardashian West a special hologram of her father, the late Robert Kardashian, for her 40th birthday, which the reality star spent on a private island with family and friends.\n\n\"For my birthday, Kanye got me the most thoughtful gift of a lifetime,\" she tweeted on Oct. 29. \"A special surprise from heaven. A hologram of my dad. It is so lifelike! We watched it over and over, filled with emotion.\"\n\nNot immune to her own bad press, Kardashian West faced negative feedback from fans who felt that sharing photos from her birthday jaunt during a pandemic was in bad taste.\n\nThat didn't stop Kardashian West from enjoying a \"girls trip\" to the Turks and Caicos Islands in late January with her daughters and sisters Kourtney Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian, Kendall Jenner and Kylie Jenner.\n\nDuring the trip, Kardashian West caused a stir after sharing a steamy photo wearing a bikini and a pair of Adidas Yeezy Foam Runners from West's clothing brand.\n\n\"Just Chillin,\" she captioned the Instagram snapshot, shared on Feb. 1.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to Hollywood divorce lawyer Laura Wasser, who is reported to be Kardashian's lawyer, and also represented her during her divorce from Humphries, for comment.\n\n'It was such a nice thing': Khloe Kardashian defends Kim Kardashian's birthday trip\n\nIn legal circles, Wasser is almost as famous as some of her celebrity clients, which include Kardashian West's mother, Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp.\n\nContributing: Bryan Alexander, Hannah Yasharoff; The Associated Press"
