        "text": "Kim Kardashian-West had a little trip down memory lane last night. The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star took to Instagram to show off some never-seen-before pictures from her birthday two years ago, the same night Kanye West proposed.\n\nKim Kardashian-West shared an up-close photo of her HUGE diamond ring that husband Kanye West presented to her when he asked her to marry him.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThe 35-year-old captioned the photo in the most perfect way, with a simple diamond ring emoji.\n\nThat wasn't the only picture shared from that special day! She even posted sweet photos of herself and Kanye kissing from that same night and captioned it, \"#TBT to 2 years ago when I got engaged! All of the pics are up on my app!\"\n\nTo celebrate the couple's one-year anniversary, Kanye West's stepmother has spoken out to say that she thinks their marriage will last \"forever\".\n\nThe rapper's stepmum Brenda has revealed the couple still act as though they're on their honeymoon.\n\nShe said: \"Kim and Kanye are still honeymooning in their minds. I think their marriage will last forever.\"\n\nBrenda - who is married to Kanye's father Ray West - claims she thought Kim was the \"perfect\" woman for him from the moment she found out they were dating.\n\nShe continued: \"When I first found out they were going out, I thought, 'Finally, that's the perfect person for him'. Kanye is an alpha male, but I think he likes that Kim is a strong person and can hold her own.\"\n\nOn 14 May 2015, we wrote...\n\nKanye West and Kim Kardashian were never going to let their first wedding anniversary go by without a significant amount of pomp and, rumour has it that they are planning to renew their wedding vows - not only that, they are planning to do it at the Eiffel Tower.\n\nThe rapper is apparently planning a lavish ceremony, whereby they would reconfirm their love on top of the Parisian landmark. The attraction's glamorous Tour Eiffel restaurant has been booked for the event, which will take place shortly after the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nKim has previously spoken about the couple's time in the French capital: \"We fell in love in Paris and then I got pregnant with our daughter in Florence,\" she said.\n\nThe pair married in Florence in front of a wall of flowers on May 24, but had their rehearsal dinner at the Palace of Versailles near Paris.\n\nSOURCE: EVENING STANDARD\n\nOn 2 September 2014, we wrote:\n\nYes, we KNOW the Kim Kardashian and Kanye West wedding was AGES ago, but seeing as Keeping Up with The Kardashians is now on TV, we are now getting all kinds of titbits about the couple's big day.\n\nThe latest bit of news is what Kim gave to Kanye as a wedding guest, revealed in the finale episode of KUWTK. Alongside the dress fittings, the visit to the Versace mansion, and some cute clips of Kimye joke-practising their first kiss, we saw the big moment with Kim gave Kanye...a book of selfies.\n\nYep, even thought Kanye sees her face all the damn day, and is aware that his wife is an avid selfie-taker on Instagram, he clearly needed a hard copy of her pouting. Although it could be a clever plug for/an advance copy of Kim's 300-page book of selfies, entitled Selfish. It's not out until next year, so Yeezus is a lucky guy.\n\nOn Tuesday 5 August 2014, we wrote...\n\nNot all went to plan at the wedding of the year, apparently. On Jimmy Kimmel Live, Kim Kardashian revealed that at her recent European nuptials to Kanye West, her sister Khloe was so drunk she had to get her make up done while she was asleep!\n\nIt just goes to show: you can organise a top-secret Florence AND Paris wedding, wear Givenchy haute couture and have a huge wall of flowers as a backdrop, but there will always be that embarrassingly inebriated family member to mess it all up.\n\n\"Khloe drank a little too much,\" Kim laughed on the show. \"I had to wake her up and she was laying down, sleeping, getting her make-up done for the wedding and I'm praying she'll get up in time to walk down the aisle …they had to do it while she was sleeping. She was so hungover.\"\n\nKim talked to Jimmy wearing what looked to be a silk teal dressing gown, a very tight bustier and her ginormous engagement ring, and also revealed that the reason for the two venues was to take guests on their \"love journey\", because the couple \"fell in love\" in Paris, and Kim \"got pregnant\" with Nori in Florence.\n\nAww.\n\nThe star of Keeping Up With The Kardashians also spoke about how her wedding plans were leaked (rehearsal dinner in the Palace of Versailles, then off to Florence for the ceremony, obv) and how In Touch magazine got a fake Kim to pose on their cover claiming she couldn't fit into her wedding dress, which the real Kim deemed to be \"lame\".\n\nAwkward!\n\nAnd Kim couldn't resist letting the world know she was going to be on Jimmy Kimmel Live, sharing this snap on Instagram with the caption \"I'm at Jimmy Kimmel and look who I see... Tune in tonight!\" It's her hubby, of course.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nWatch a snippet of Kim's interview with Jimmy Kimmel here:\n\nOn Monday 28 July 2014, we wrote...\n\nOuch! The Kardashians aren't going to be very happy with the news that is circulating this morning - Page Six reports that Jay Z and his wife Beyoncé didn't attend the wedding of Kanye West and Kim Kardashian because it reportedly wasn't classy enough for their brand.\n\nIn the Page Six report, it also states that Bey and Jay will split, and it's not whether they'll split, but how.\n\nAccording to the source, \"Neither wants to lose\" their status at the top of the music industry food chain, and most of the reason they haven't split yet is business. Among the other revelations is that Bey and Jay change their mobile numbers every two weeks.\n\nSOURCE: PAGE SIX\n\nOn 18 June 2014, we wrote...\n\nThat Kim Kardashian and Kanye West wedding kiss photo, you know, the one that became the most liked photo on Instagram, ever? Well, it turns out a LOT of effort went into it.\n\nSpeaking at the Cannes Lions festival, Kanye West has revealed he spent FOUR DAYS editing the photo of him and Kim Kardashian kissing before he deemed it Instagram-worthy. The reason? Not just Kanye's ego, and social media obsession. It was because top photographer Annie Leibowitz pulled out a few days before the wedding, so he was hoping a snazzy filter would spruce up his wedding pics:\n\n\"Let me tell you something about that kiss photo that my girl put up … this was p***ing my girl off during the honeymoon, she was exhausted because we worked on the photo so much because Annie Leibovitz pulled out right before the wedding. I think that she was, like, scared of the idea of celebrity\" Kanye said.\n\n\"Because Annie pulled out, I was like, 'Okay, I still want my wedding photos to look like Annie Leibovitz,' and we sat there and worked on that photo for, like, four days because the flowers were off-color\".\n\nHe then said that the four days (on his honeymoon, by the sounds of it) editing the photo was worth it, because it was what Kim deserved:\n\n\"Can you imagine telling someone who wants to just Instagram a photo, who's the No. 1 person on Instagram, 'We need to work on the color of the flower wall,' or the idea that it's a Givenchy dress, and it's not about the name Givenchy, it's about the talent that is Riccardo Tisci - and how important Kim is to the Internet.\n\n\"And the fact the No. 1 most-liked photo [on Instagram] has a kind of aesthetic was a win for what the mission is, which is raising the palette.\"\n\nHe then said some (kind of?!) sweet things about his love for Kim: \"throughout my entire life … I have to work with the No. 1, I can't work with anyone but Jay Z, I can't be with any girl but Kim because that's the girl that I look at her pictures the most and get turned on the most.\"\n\nFor more excellent Kanye West quotes, head here.\n\nOn Friday 13 June 2014, we wrote...\n\nKim Kardashian and Kanye West's honeymoon photos have landed. Well, kind of. Kim is sharing pics from the couple's luxurious Mexico break - their second honeymoon, because that's what you do when you're the #worldsmosttalkedaboutcouple.\n\nKim Instagrammed photos of her relaxing poolside at a villa in Punta Mita, Mexico owned by her friend, Girls Gone Wild founder Joe Francis.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nCurrently honeymooning in Mexico, the couple have shared a set of candid snaps on E!, which include scenes of the bridal party after the newlyweds nuptials at the lavish Port di Belvedere in Italy.\n\nOne pic, which Kim captioned \"My everything\" shows her and Kanye soaking up some sun on the rooftop of their wedding venue. While Kim looks thoughtfully into the distance, her man clutches their baby girl, wedding ring firmly on show.\n\nFYI fans of mini-me fashion - this is also the first full-length shot of North's custom Givenchy dress.\n\nThere's also a scene showing Kim's sisters chatting to Kanye after the couple's vows. And it's a pretty meaningful shot according to Khloe Kardashian, who told E! : \"The image was taken right after Kim and Kanye wed. We were all discussing how calm and dream-like the wedding was. The peace in Kim and Kanye was undeniable. We all felt as if they had been married in another lifetime. I have always believed these two are soul mates.\"\n\nAccording to People, the couple jetted off to celebrate their marriage AND Kanye West's 37th birthday, with sunbathing, margaritas, and no doubt, loads of selfies.\n\n\"They're staying in a private house on the beach,\" a source told the magazine. Apparently this is the couple's \"official\" honeymoon, and their Ireland and Prague vacations were just a warm-up.\n\nThe holiday hot-spot is apparently a favourite of the Kardashian Klan - and while some publications are reporting that the couple went to Mexico because they hated their Ireland vay-cay, our roving reporter from Brides, who stayed at the same hotel as the couple during their honeymoon, revealed that they were having a great time, with the couple spotted relaxed, happy, and \"hand in hand\" the whole time.\n\nOn Tuesday 3 June 2014, we wrote...\n\nAnother day, another Kimye wedding story. But if there's one thing we're still enjoying from the world's most talked-about wedding, it's tales of Kanye West being the craziest Groomzilla in the world.\n\nAccording to The Mirror, the gift Kanye bought his new bride has been revealed - and it's none other than a nude portrait of Kim Kardashian - in just a g-string and Louboutins shoes, entitled \"Perfect B*tch\". Sure.\n\nOf course, Kanye being Kanye, this isn't just some tacky photo-shopped portrait - he commissioned anonymous street artist Bambi and, according to the artist's agent and manager Leonard Villa, he wanted \"something regal but typically Kim\".\n\nThis is the man who supposedly took to his wedding bar with a chainsaw and nailed bits of wood to it so it looked more \"arty\", so his wedding gift doesn't come as a surprise. Art matters to Kanye, you guys.\n\nThe picture, rumoured to cost five figures, is set to hang in the couple's bedroom - but there's a chance Kanye could ask for MORE paintings, according to the artists's agent:\n\n\"So far it's a one-off but we weren't told the image had to remain exclusive, so she could have more in the pipeline\", he said.\n\nLucky Kim.\n\nSOURCE: The Mirror\n\nOn Monday 2 June 2014, we wrote...\n\nYou think people would be sick of talking about the Kimye wedding, but oh no. Even though it happened last weekend, stories of downright insanity are still emerging from Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's Florence affair - and the absolute best is from New Tork tabloid Page Six, whose \"spy\" reported from inside the wedding.\n\nThe reports suggest that Kanye was a TOTAL Groomzilla - and wanted the wedding to look PERFECT. Here are five of the greatest revelations:\n\n1. The Toilets\n\n\"The biggest decorative element\" of the wedding was the toilets, according to the Page Six spy. This giant gold box situated next to the dining tables was the \"star of the show\", according to the Italians. It even had a special name, Torre di Bagni Oro (translation: the Gold Toilet Tower). It was the first thing guests saw when they arrived.\n\n2. The Seating Plan\n\nNo place cards for Kimye - instead, they had a marble table engraved with the guest's names, by Italian stonemasons. The only problem? The engravers got some of the names wrong.\n\n3. Kanye's Groomzilla-ness\n\nFour days before the wedding, Kanye ordered 30 life-sized nudes to be made from black marble. Then, two hours before the wedding, he ordered them to be moved away from the dining tables. He also decided the 80 moving lights he originally wanted (that had taken four days to install), were removed, declaring:\n\n\"I'm in the center of this party, and I'm the only one people need to see. The rest of these people don't need lights on them.\"\n\nHe also hated the all-white bar that had been installed - so he took to it with A SAW, screaming at the staff, and then nailed two blocks of wood to the front. \"Now, it's art\", he allegedly declared.\n\n4. The First Dance\n\nOr should we say, dances. Kimye danced to FIVE songs by John Legend, with spotlights only on them. Kanye also gave a \"45 minute toast to himself\".\n\n5. Jay Z's wedding gift\n\nA giant bottle of Chianti, dipped in gold, with the cork replaced by a giant diamond, apparently. Well, he did decide not to come.\n\nSOURCE: Page Six.\n\nOn Friday 30 May 2014, we wrote...\n\nReports about the Kimye Irish Honeymoon have been all over the internet - they were rumoured to have gone to the cinema (imagine Kanye asking for a plate of Nachos and a Slush Puppy at your local Odeon), to have done a touristy trip around Dublin, and stayed in the Presidential Suite at a top hotel there.\n\nBut that's all LIES. Because a writer at our sister publication, Brides , accidentally gatecrashed the Kimye honeymoon while staying at Ballyfin - an imposing neo-classical stone mansion in the Co. Laois countryside - and she wrote all about it.\n\nWith a Gold Room decorated with a chandelier once owned by Napoleon's sister, the hotel clearly had the luxe French vibe the couple adored - but according to Brides' roving reporter, the couple were just like any other pair of newlyweds. Kim walked around in flats and no make-up, and they were hand in hand the whole time. No cameras, no Momager - although they did have their bodyguards and assistants staying in the hotel (you can take the Kardashians out of LA...).\n\nRead the whole report here - and be comforted by the fact that actually, the #worldsmosttalkedaboutcouple are actually, like any loved-up couple.\n\nOn Tuesday 27 May 2014, we wrote...\n\nFinally! After days of refreshing #Kimyewedding on Instagram/Twitter, we now have OFFICIAL photos of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West as newlyweds.\n\nThe suite - which costs over £42k a night - boasts a spacious bedroom and luxury bathroom with walk-in shower, huge bath and private sauna.\n\nAccording to the Irish Independent, the couple are also expected to spend at least a day in Dublin - and will tour some of Ireland's most famous tourist attractions.\n\nThe paper reported that the couple were accompanied by their personal assistants and bodyguards and are expected to remain in Ireland until Friday when they are due to fly back to the US.\n\nSOURCE: IRISH INDEPENDENT\n\nOn 24 May 2014, we wrote...\n\nHurrah! Kim Kardashian and Kanye West have finally tied the knot. After 10 years of having a crush, Kanye finally got the girl.\n\nA rep for Kanye announced the news to US Weekly, \"Kim Kardashian and Kanye West were married in a private ceremony in the presence of family and friends in Florence, Italy, today.\"\n\nThe last 24 hours we have been on #KimyeWedding-watch on Instagram, and so far, it's all been pretty under wraps.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nA source revealed to People that Kanye was extremely nervous, guzzling water obsessively from the bottle: \"It was funny how nervous he was,\" an onlooker told People. \"He clearly knew the gravity of what he was about to do. This morning he was all smiles, but as it got closer, you could see that the nerves were kicking in. It's common for most grooms. I've seen it all before.\"\n\nIt has also been reported that the wedding was catered by Galateo Ricevimenti, and guests dined on traditional Tuscan cuisine before they enjoyed an impressive 7-tier cake, which was crafted by Galeto.\n\nCelebrity guests included Chrissy Teigen, John Legend, LaLa Anthony, Lorraine Schwartz, Q-Tip, and more.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThe night before, the couple enjoyed a pre-wedding celebration at the Palace of Versailles. Lana del Rey performed*.*\n\nSOURCE: US WEEKLY, PEOPLE, AND E! NEWS\n\nOn 23 May 2014, we wrote...\n\nIf Kim Kardashian's pre-wedding dress is anything to go by then her actual bridal gown is set to be a sight to behold.\n\nKim and hubby-to-be, Kanye West, were spotted heading to their wedding brunch today, while pushing 10-month-old North West in a pram.\n\nKris Jenner also arrived with the trio for the celebration at Chateau de Wideville - a 17th Century residence in the west of Paris, where King Louis XIV used to keep a mistress. Sounds pretty swanky.\n\nAnd the couple were looking ah-mazing for the meal. Kim donned a floor-sweeping custom Valentino gown with plunging neckline and butterflies appliqued all over.\n\nThe Video Games star has relented and will be singing at the Kimye wedding this Saturday.\n\nThe Mirror reports that Lana Del Rey will be flown out to Paris for event and will pocket a six-figure sum, which let's face it, is spare change when your wedding is said to be costing a mere £3million.\n\nThe paper also reports that Lana's song Young and Beautiful is one of Kim Kardashian's favourite songs.\n\nSOURCE: THE MIRROR\n\nOn 19 May 2014, we wrote...\n\nKim Kardashian and Kanye West must be sticking out like sore thumbs in Paris. The engaged pair are currently in the city of lurve ahead of their wedding at the weekend, and amongst the sea of tourists and backpacks, Kim Kardashian is wearing the bodysuit - sans bra. Sure.\n\nThe 33-year-old flashed a rather daring hint of sideboob (sorry, we didn't mean to sounds so Daily Mail on you all, but look it's total sideboob) as she and her fiancé stepped out in Paris for a spot of lunch at L'Avenue.\n\nBut the couple haven't sacked off the city of lights completely. They'll host a pre-wedding dinner in Paris and then will then fly the guests to Italy in private planes for the ceremony - which sounds like a bellissimo (and pretty expensive) plan.\n\nAnd according to Us Weekly, this jaunt to Italy won't be the only unexpected detail at the couple's wedding:\n\n\"Kim and Kanye have told all guests different info,\" a source tells Us*.* \"No one knows all of the details.\"\n\nYesterday Kim was spotted at LAX ready to board a flight to the French capital, with sister Khloe Kardashian in tow.\n\nThe pair were fresh from filming the final scenes of the current series of Keeping Up With the Kardashians*.* Though sadly, it's already been confirmed that the Kimye wedding will NOT appear on the programme. Sigh.\n\nKim was looking très chic for her arrival in France, dressed in a simple collarless white shirt, skinny jeans, taupe heels and was clutching a black Birkin and a coordinating leather biker jacket.\n\nAfter Kim and Kanye's invite was leaked by Us Weekly, we learned that the wedding is due to take place on the 24th of May, so there's nine days and counting until the wedding of the year.\n\nThat leaves plenty of time for Kim to prep and preen.\n\nWe have our eyes peeled for the arrival of Kanye, North West and the rest of the Kardashian klan.\n\nEarlier, we wrote...\n\nOver the weekend, Kim Kardashian celebrated her upcoming wedding to Kanye West with a Paris-themed bridal shower in LA.\n\nThe 33-year-old Keeping Up With The Kardashians star looked stunning in her strapless white dress at the Peninsula hotel in Beverly Hills.\n\n\"1. We are not married yet!\n\n2. We are not filming our wedding for Keeping Up With The Kardashians. You will see everything leading up til & maybe even photos. As much as we would love to share these memories, privacy is our main priority.\n\n3. No guest list has been released. Seeing fake ones. Especially not 1600 people invited like I just read. Its VERY small & intimate\n\n4. Seeing fake wedding dress pics of me. No one has seen my dress! Those photos are old or photo shopped.\n\nThat's its! Unless you hear it from us please don't believe nonsense!\"\n\nWell, that told us. Well at least the Kimye fans can rest easy that the pair won't be TOTALLY private - it sounds like there will still be wedding photos to pore over after the event.\n\nOn Wednesday 30 April 2014 we wrote...\n\nIt has been reported that Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are planning to marry THIS week in a secret ceremony.\n\nYep, this week. We haven't even brought our dress yet, they can't spring this news on us so suddenly.\n\nAccording to TMZ.com, Kimye already have a marriage license and plan to tie the knot before the week is out. The pair are reportedly still going ahead with their Paris plans - but that sounds more of a celeb bash than a wedding.\n\nIt's reported that the couple got their hands on a \"confidential\" license to keep it all on the down low so they can get married in the privacy of their own home, instead of going to a Southern California courthouse to get hitched.\n\nSorry, but, small? Private? Down low? Are you sure we're talking about the same couple?\n\nSOURCE: TMZ\n\nOn 24 April 2014, we wrote...\n\nRemember when James Franco and Seth Rogen re-enacted the Kimye Bound 2 video? Watching a topless Seth straddling James on a motorbike will forever be one of our fave parodies.\n\nWe know that Kim Kardashian loved it - she said so on Twitter, but we weren't sure if Kanye West liked it - he's not exactly known for his sense of humour, now, is he?\n\nBut hold up! Perhaps Kanye West is funnier than we thought - according to James Franco, Kanye loved it so much that he has asked the actor to perform it at his wedding to Kim Kardashian.\n\nSpeaking on The View, James said: \"Kim loved the video and we didn't hear back from Kanye so we kind of felt like he's not bashing us, but he probably hates it but he's not going to say anything.\"\n\nHe then added that Kanye finally got in contact two weeks ago.\n\n\"But then two weeks ago, we got a call from Kanye. Seth and I were on the phone. We thought he was just going to let us have it. But he loved it. And I'm pretty sure I can say it now because I'm pretty sure it's not going to happen. He wanted us to perform it live the night before his wedding at Versailles.\"\n\nBut James thought it would be a bit flat with the rest of the Kardashian ladies - \"I think it would have been awesome for about 10 seconds, but then there would be Seth with his shirt off in front of all the Kardashians,\" James joked.\n\nAh man, DO IT, GUYS!\n\nOn 17 April 2014, we wrote...\n\nThere's been no confirmation on this, but Kim Kardashian and her recent Instagram pictures have fuelled speculation that her wedding dress is going to be Balmain.\n\nThe house of Balmain, which Olivier joined in 2009, is known for its super high-end ornate styling and luxe decadence. Sounds like the perfect choice for a Kardashian wedding.\n\nOn 15 April 2014, we wrote...\n\nKim Kardashian and Kanye West arrived in Paris over the weekend to continue their wedding day preparation.\n\nWhile most brides-to-be are getting stressed out at this point, Kim Kardashian looked happy with her fella Kanye West, and they enjoyed lunch at Chez Ferdi followed by a trip to the shops.\n\nThat's right - while the couple may be in France to continue planning their wedding, they also found time for a shopping spree. Kanye was seen leaving the Balmain store clutching loads of bags. Kim reportedly splurged at Givenchy, Balmain, and Lanvin while in the French capital.\n\nExpected to be a multiday event, Kimye's upcoming wedding has been in the works for months. The ceremony will likely include a line-up of famous faces, with the latest rumours suggesting Beyoncé and Jay Z WILL be attending.\n\nThe loved-up pair toured the Château de Louveciennes during the trip, potentially scouting the venue as a possible wedding location.\n\nOn 10 April 2014, we wrote...\n\nSad news for Kanye West as it's been alleged that Jay-Z has turned down his offer to be best man at the rapper's wedding to Kim Kardashian.\n\nApparently Kanye asked his buddy Jay-Z to be his best man but he reportedly turned the offer down as he didn't want to be associated with the Keeping Up With The Kardashians.\n\nIt's believed that Kim and Kanye's wedding will appear on the show, which makes it less surprising that Jay-Z might not want to be involved, as he is notoriously private.\n\nAccording to Life & Style, a source told them, \"Of course, Kanye asked Jay to be his best man at the wedding. But Jay politely declined the request,\" the insider revealed. \"Jay just didn't want to be associated with the Kardashian reality show. Kanye told Jay he understands why he would decline, but he's still very hurt.\"\n\nThe eagerly anticipated wedding is believed to be happening in May but the couple have remained quite tight-lipped about the details.\n\nEarlier in the year Kim revealed it is going to take place in Paris (but not in the Palais of Versaille, much to our disappointment) and it is going to be a fairly small affair.\n\nWe can't wait for all the pictures!\n\nOn Thursday 6 February, we wrote...\n\nMark Saturday, May 24 in your diaries, Kimye fans - that's when the dynamic duo are set to tie the knot!\n\nUs Weekly has confirmed the couple's wedding date will be at the end of May in Paris, just seven months after they got engaged. What's more, the pair will fly guests out to their French wedding a few days before so they can make the most of their time in the City of Lights.\n\nA source also told the tabloid that West is planning the whole event, from Kim's wardrobe down to the guest list. And what'll Kim wear? Only one dress, apparently, and it will be one that will show off her curves. North will have a role in the wedding, too.\n\nThe bride-to-be recently opened up about the wedding to Keeping Up With the Kardashians producer Ryan Seacrest on his radio show, and suggested that it will be a \"smaller and more intimate\" affair than originally anticipated. But Kanye was being a bit of a control freak about the whole thing, with the seating chart \"like death\". Sounds intense.\n\nOn Wednesday 26 February we wrote...\n\nKim Kardashian has revealed that actually, she's NOT going to have a lavish wedding to Kanye West- instead it's going to be a super small intimate affair.\n\nWhile we reckon that \"small and intimate\" by Kimye standards just means \"not at Versailles\", it's still a surprising revelation from the most high maintenance couple in showbiz. Kim had laser surgery on her boobs because of stretch marks, for Pete's sake!\n\nSpeaking to Ryan Seacrest on his KIIS FM show, Kim revealed that the couple had both decided to pare everything back, because \"As we are going along, we realize we want it to be smaller and more intimate than people are imagining and thinking.\"\n\nWe know how you feel Kim - the vodka luge, 12-tier cake and magician might SEEM like a good idea for your big day, but when you look at budgets, not so much.\n\nShe also revealed that planning the wedding was pretty intense - mainly because of their A-list guest list: \"The seating chart is like death\", she revealed. We bet - can you imagine knowing who to sit Bey and Jay Z next to? Or Harry Styles? And then there's the mother-in-law drama-rama that is Kris Jenner. Phew!\n\nShe also confirmed that the wedding IS in Paris and it IS this year, but she won't reveal when.\n\nAnd after the wedding? She wants MORE babies!\n\n\"I want to have more, but I'm not going the route my mom did. She is crazy,\" she said of her Mum Kris Jenner (who has six).\n\n\"I don't think I can do more than three - tops...That would be my absolute top, top, tops. I even contemplate, should North be an only child? but then I contemplate all the ... fun experiences I had, so I might have to tough it out.\"\n\nWe're sure Baby North would love a sister or brother Kim, but focus on enjoying the wedding first!\n\nOn Saturday 15 February, we wrote...\n\nWe knew Kanye West would go big with his Valentine's Day gift - that's just the sort of guy he is.\n\nAnd we were right, Kim Kardashian has posted a picture of what her fiancée brought her, and it required a fair few vases.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThe picture, which she captioned \"a thousand roses\", shows Kim Kardashian lying on a white sofa, legs up in the air and surrounded by red roses. It's basically a picture of someone loving life right now.\n\nBut it wasn't a night of sexy time - Kanye was performing his Yeezus tour in Baltimore. But don't worry, Kim was there to watch her true love up on stage.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThis fits with the previous belief that the wedding is going to be similar to a festival with lots of little celebrations leading up to the wedding.\n\nAs for eight-month-old daughter North West, another source tells Us Weekly that she \"will have a large role in the wedding.\"\n\nThe rumour mill has been in overdrive since the couple announced their engagement. However Kim has given little away.\n\nThe Keeping Up With The Kardashians' star told Jimmy Kimmel on his show that she will definitely be getting married in Paris,\n\n\"I'm not telling where or the date, but I think it's kind of obvious it's in Paris.\"\n\n\"It's our second home,\" she added. \"We spend so much time there, we have an apartment there. We really love it.\"\n\nWe're still sad that the wedding will not be held at the Palace of Versailles.\n\nOn 28 January, we wrote...\n\nKanye West may have snubbed Keeping Up With The Kardashian's in the past, but it seems the rapper has changed his mind by agreeing to wed on television.\n\nAccording to reports on RadarOnline the rapper will marry Kim Kardashian on the show in June, having been persuaded by Kim as E! will pay for most of the expenses.\n\nIt has already been confirmed that the couple will marry in Paris, not Versailles, this summer, but now they are allegedly saying their vows on the big screen.\n\n\"Kim has always wanted to be a June bride and she is finally going to get her wish,\" a source told Radar.\n\n\"Kim and Kanye have narrowed down the wedding location, which is being kept a secret at this point. It will be on the outskirts of Paris,\" the pesky source added.\n\nIt won't be the first time Kim has wed on TV, back in 2011, the star wed Kris Humphries for a four-hour special on KUWTK, for which the former couple were reportedly paid $15 million.\n\n\"Even though Kim's marriage to Kris was a disaster, she was very happy with how the wedding and reception turned out,\" the source said.\n\n\"Both Kim and Kanye have very high expectations for their wedding. It will be an over-the-top affair and there will be pre-wedding festivities leading up to the big day for their guests. It'll be like a festival.\"\n\nThe pair got engaged last year with an extravagant gesture from Kanye at the AT&T Park in San Francisco with a 15 carat diamond ring.\n\nIf the wedding's anything like the proposal, and with Kimye involved we're sure it will be, we'll be expecting big things.\n\nOn 24 January, we wrote...\n\nShe may not be getting married in Versailles, but Kim Kardashian IS getting married abroad.\n\nThe reality star appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live, telling the talk show host that they are planning to get married in the world's most romantic city, and that she'll take Kanye West's name.\n\n\"I'll probably be Kim Kardashian West and change Kardashian to my middle name. We will be getting married, this summer hopefully, in Paris.\"\n\nThe reason for the Parisian nuptials? Kimye adore the city:\n\n\"It's our second home. We spend so much time there, we have an apartment there. I'm not telling where or the date, but it's definitely Paris.\"\n\nShe also quashed those Versailles rumours herself, saying they visited Paris because Kanye wanted \"just to have three days to ourselves without your family\" (LOLZ):\n\n\"We took a tour because we've never been there before. We were just having a private tour.\"\n\nAs for wedding planning, it turns out Kanye will be a bit of a groomzilla - he's \"very specific\" about wedding plans and \"will take care of the music\", whilst Kim will be in charge of \"the seating chart\".\n\nSo there you have it, straight from the palace's mouth. On to the next rumoured venue - Buckingham Palace, perhaps?\n\nOn Monday 23 January, we wrote...\n\nWith their wedding expected this summer, the rumour mill has been in Kimye nuptials overdrive - and the latest batch of rumours around their impending W-day have made it sound EVEN MORE epic than Kim Kardashian's ill-fated marriage to Kris Humphries.\n\nFirstly, there were the Versailles wedding venue rumours - which, although the couple dismissed themselves, have been kick-started again by pictures of them snapped visiting the site whilst Kanye was at Paris Haute Couture Fashion Week. Kim also shared a photo on Instagram of her visit to the historic palace.\n\nBut there's also been talk of her asking someone very special to walk her down the aisle. No, not Bruce Jenner and his impressive ponytail (although he will probably give Kim away), but little Baby North.\n\nA source told Hollywood Life that North, who will be one and hopefully able to walk by the time Kimye tie the knot, will have a special pair of diamond shoes created for the occasion by celeb jewellery designer Lorraine Schwartz:\n\n\"They want her to create North a pair of one of a kind, diamond shoes, so she can walk her mother down the aisle when Kanye asks for her hand in marriage\" the source said, before adding:\n\n\"Kanye wants Nori to be symbolic in the wedding because she's the product of the ultimate love he and Kim share for one another.\"\n\nIf Kim DOES decide to tie the knot in Paris, it will be an interesting move considering she told Ellen she wanted to wed \"in the country\" but close to home when she appeared on her talk show last week. But does a French wedding mean her dress will come courtesy of Gallic fashion house Givenchy, whose head designer Riccardo Tisci is a close personal friend of Kim's? We'll have to wait and see.\n\nOn Wednesday 1 January, we wrote...\n\nFinally, a good look at Kim Kardashian's gorgeous engagement ring, and for added cuteness, baby North West is clutching it in her adorable little hand! [#instagram:https://www.instagram.com/p/ineVclOS8i/] This new photo - posted by Kim Kardashian on her Instagram account - shows off the stunning 15-carat sparkler. \"It was an amazing year!!!\" she wrote alongside the snapshot. Nice work, Mr West.\n\nTurns out the rumour was in fact, no more than a rumour - so we won't see Kanye bellowing \"Let them eat cake\" whilst Kim adjusts her pompadour wig for a guillotine-themed selfie.\n\nKim's rep told E! News that the couple are in no way saying \"I do\" at the former home of Marie Antoinette, calling the rumours \"absolutely false\".\n\nIn fact, according to the rep, the couple haven't decided on anything for their impending nuptials - not the date, the location, or, in true Hollywood style, they wedding planner.\n\nSo we may speculate no more. But one thing's for certain - given that Kanye enlisted a 50-piece orchestra and a Jumbotron to propose, the wedding will be completely OTT, and the wedding speech (given Kanye's recent radio outbursts) will result in some hilarious quotes.\n\nIn other Kardashian news, Kim shared an adorable pic of baby North at Art Basel Miami - here she is cosying up in her car seat next to artist Jeff Koons.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nOn Thursday 5 December 2013, we wrote...\n\nHe recently said his daughter North is just as royal as Prince George, and now it seems Kanye West might be planning a regal wedding of his own.\n\n\"Lana politely declined, and didn't give any reason for not being able to perform,\" a source told Radar Online. \"It was a very firm no from Lana and her camp. Kanye did try to push it, but didn't get anywhere.\n\n\"Kanye decided to hire an orchestra to perform the song for Kim, and he was much happier with how it turned out.\"\n\n\"Kim was bummed that Lana didn't perform for the big event, but she is still a huge fan. She just loved that Kanye tried to make it happen,\" another insider claimed. \"Kim is jokingly saying Lana will want to perform at their wedding.\"\n\nIn other dramatic KimYe engagement news, the couple are suing the founder of YouTube for leaking their proposal video (yes, that super blurry, barely visible 2-and-a-half-minute clip that was posted on his new website MixBit shortly after the event).\n\nAccording to TMZ, the couple have filed a lawsuit against Chad Hurley, claiming that he \"violated a confidentiality agreement\" by publishing the media.\n\nApparently, Hurley wasn't even invited to the proposal but was allowed to stay and watch under the condition that he didn't post any pictures or videos of it anywhere.\n\nThe lawsuit states: \"Exclusive rights, such as those sold by plaintiffs to publication of video of the event, are particularly valuable. If people violate these rights... They are of substantially diminished value.\"\n\n\"Hurley proceeded to try to turn the event into one starring himself, broadcasting the images he knew were the exclusive property rights of someone else,\" it goes on to detail.\n\nHowever, West did allow cameras from E! Entertainment to film the event, which could mean we get to watch it in full on an episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians in the future.\n\nSOURCE: TMZ, RADAR ONLINE\n\nOn 31 October 2013, we wrote...\n\nKim Kardashian has given her first big interview since she became engaged to Kanye West.\n\nThe star opened up about her dramatic 50lb weightloss, spoke about her super-sweet baby daughter North West and regaled the audience on Jay Leno with the full story of how the rapper popped the question to her in the middle of a baseball stadium last week.\n\nShowing off her toned post-baby body in a sheer, white lace dress with her black underwear clearly on display, Kim revealed exactly how she'd got back to her pre-baby weight.\n\n\"Actually, I got on the scale today and it said that I am 50lbs down. That made me so excited,\" she told the chat show host, before confirming her slim physique was down to hard exercise and the Atkins diet.\n\n\"It worked for me,\" she said.\n\nHowever, she did admit to struggling with the sudden weight gain she experienced when she was pregnant with North West.\n\n\"I can honestly say it was the greatest challenge of my life,\" she said, describing the criticism on her appearance she faced during pregnancy as \"ridiculous\".\n\n\"It really hurt my soul. It changed how I am in public. I've tried to live more of a private life.\"\n\nEspecially as her somewhat swollen appearance was down to a life-threatening pre-natal condition, preeclampsia, which led to North being born five weeks prematurely.\n\n\"That was a cause for a lot of the swelling and at the time I didn't know what was going on.\"\n\nBut her troubles are well behind her, and Kim is enjoying a particularly happy moment in her life after Kanye surprised her by getting down on one knee on her 33rd birthday.\n\n\"I'm very happy right now,\" she said. \"[The proposal] was the most magical night of my life.\n\n\"I thought we were just going to dinner for my birthday. He just told me to close my eyes... He covered my eyes.\n\n\"I thought I was going to fall and he was totally helping me [out of the car]. It's so his personality to do something wild for my birthday.\n\n\"My favourite Lana song started playing, Lana Del Rey Young And Beautiful. And I was like, 'Oh my God, he got Lana to play for me on my birthday.'\n\n\"I thought that was my birthday surprise. And she doesn't get out and he goes down on his knee. And I was shaking the entire time.\n\n\"The big scoreboard said, 'Please marry me'. I said, 'Yes'.'\n\n\"The whole family thought they were there for my surprise party, and I thought they were in Arizona. He told them a surprise party, I need you guys there. The look on their faces - I turn around and see them balling.\"\n\nAnd on the wedding itself?\n\n\"I want [Kanye] to have whatever he wants,\" she said, before hinting that the venue could be \"some place Parisian\".\n\nAs for when we can expect the nuptials, the star revealed that the couple are \"hoping for next summer\" but \"haven't had time to sit down and talk about it\" yet.\n\nShe also spoke about baby North West, calling her \"the sweetest little girl\" and claiming that \"she never cries\".\n\n\"She's a perfect little angel. I hope she grows up to be smart and opinionated like her dad,\" she told Leno.\n\nAnd on the subject of her mother's recent split from Bruce Jenner:\n\n\"They are [separated],\" she confirmed. \"And it is for the better, and the best way.\"\n\n\"I think they are better living in two separate homes. They get along better. I'd rather them live together and be happy. They are better friends now.\"\n\nKim went on to add that she would still be asking Bruce to walk her down the aisle, answering \"of course\" when Leno raised the question live on air.\n\n\"Our family I would say is the biggest most happiest, dysfunctional family.\"\n\nOn 30 October 2013, we wrote...\n\nKanye West has opened up about his romance with fiancée Kim Kardashian, revealing that he actually fell for her nearly seven years ago. Speaking to Ryan Seacrest on his radio show on Tuesday, West said: \"I just knew I wanted her to be my girl for a long time... I remember I saw a picture of her and Paris Hilton, and I remember telling my boy, 'Have you seen that girl Kim Kar-dijon?'\" The couple soon established a firm friendship, despite maintaining high profile relationships with other people. During the interview, the Yeesuz hitmaker also confirmed that his baby mumma will take his surname, which Kardashian later confirmed would officially move her famous surname to her middle name making her Kim Kardashian West.\n\nThe rapper also opened up about his elaborate proposal to the reality TV star, which saw him hire a baseball stadium in San Francisco. He said: \"The ring was four-hours-old from when I put it on her finger… I had to pick it up in LA. I was working on it for a while. I was working on it with four different jewelers. I just put it in my bag.\"\n\nHe added: \"I was nervous. I was talking to her cousin… I was like, 'I don't know, what do you think she's going to say?' I'm not arrogant about love and feelings at all. I'm confident in the work I put so much work in to but this is someone else's feelings… You never know what someone else may feel at the time.\"\n\nAaw. Anyone else beginning to think Kanye might actually be a massive cutie? SOURCE: DAILY MAIL\n\nOn 29 October 2013, we wrote...\n\nIt must be love, because Kim Kardashian is considering dropping the last name that made her millions to be with Mr West.\n\nThe reality TV star has revealed that she'll be taking on Kanye's almighty last moniker when the pair tie the knot.\n\nHowever, fans fear not - she won't be shedding her famous heritage completely.\n\n\"Yeah, I will,\" she told E! News when asked. \"It'll be Kim Kardashian West.\"\n\n\"You really have a sense of family especially with us having our daughter and our relationship has been best friends and we've known each other for so long that our relationship has always been amazing,\" she said. \"But I think it's gotten so much better after we had our daughter and just since we've been together for almost two years now.\"\n\nAlso. Newsflash. Kanye = Bridezilla.\n\n\"We honestly haven't had a moment to talk about it or even breathe, so we haven't really talked about it, but whatever he wants,\" Kim told People magazine recently.\n\nLiterally cannot wait.\n\nSOURCE: PEOPLE, E! NEWS\n\nOn 29 October 2013, we wrote...\n\n\"Because if she leaves your ass, she gonna leave with half.\"\n\nOr so the Kanye West lyrics go. But it seems KimYe, who are pretty equally matched pound-for-pound, have already agreed to separate their assets before they tie the knot.\n\nAccording to TMZ, the couple are drawing up a prenup ahead of their big day. The report then, rather confusingly, goes on to explain that they are reluctant to sign it, as they are \"worried the relationship might fall apart\".\n\nHowever, Kim apparently understands the need for clear contracts when it comes to financial matters, because she had it drilled into her by her late father, Robert Kardashian, who was an attorney.\n\nTMZ goes on to claim that the pair will still have a big joint account for living expenses. Which we're sure will include necessities like antique fish tanks and marble conference tables.\n\nWith Kim's wealth at an estimated $40million and Kanye's at an eye-watering $90million, we think they'll probably get by whether they sign one or not. SOURCE: TMZ\n\nOn 24 October 2013, we wrote...\n\nAnd thus, the KimYe mega-love-in continued. This time, with Kanye West referring to his bride-to-be live on stage in San Jose as \"my fiancée\".\n\nWhile he was introducing his track Bound 2, the 36-year-old rapper publically confirmed his engagement for the first time, according to People.\n\n\"If you came with somebody that you love tonight, hold on so tight,\" he said. \"What I'm trying to say is it's hard to find you.\"\n\nHe went on to suggest that Kim had given him a new lease of life after his mother Donda passed away in 2007.\n\n\"I felt like everything was spiraling and falling and I was questioning my faith,\" he told the crowd.\n\n\"Life, sometimes I'm feeling like I had a second chance in life. 'Cause I remember in my career early on when I could have lost my life.\"\n\nMeanwhile, video footage has emerged of the grand engagement that took place at the AT & T baseball park in San Franscisco earlier this week. To be honest? It literally could be anyone. It's not clear what's going on here. And Kimye are but blue smears surrounded by green.

I am the luckiest girl in the world! I get to marry my best friend!\"\n\nWe're not sure where they got the triple exclamation marks from either, but I think we get the idea: she was very excited.\n\nThe star was seen for the first time since the announcement, as she left a hotel in San Francisco with her mother, Kris Jenner.\n\nShowing off her post-baby figure, the star wore a high-waist pencil skirt, a lace camisole and a large (we hope faux) fur coat.\n\nBut it seems not everyone was happy with the big revelation. Kim's ex-father-in-law, William Humphries, predicted the union could be as short-lived as his son's was.\n\n\"Does a leopard really change its spots? I don't think so,\" he told The Daily News. \"Not much changes. It's just different actors this time around.\"\n\nWay harsh, Tai.\n\nSOURCE: E! ONLINE, THE DAILY NEWS\n\nOn 22 October, we wrote...\n\nKim Kardashian has given us a flash of her MAMMOTH engagement ring, confirming that she is indeed set to wed Kanye West.\n\nThe star held up her huge, 15-carat diamond whopper for a photo shortly after Kanye popped the question at a baseball stadium in San Fransisco last night (get all the details of exactly how the extravagant rapper did that below. Trust us, it is suitably Kanye).\n\nThe ring was designed by celebrity jeweller Lorraine Schwart, who just so happens to be the same person who designed her recently auctioned engagement ring from her previous marriage to Kris Humphries.\n\nHumphries sold the rock - which was marginally bigger than Kanye's at 16.21 carats, was auctioned at Christies in New York for an eye-watering $620,000, meaning the mystery buyer paid $749,000 after adding the buyer's premium.\n\nThe price surprised many, as the ring was reportedly worth $2million.\n\nSpeaking about the sale of the rock to Us Weekly, a source revealed: \"Kim has been waiting for the day he would auction it… Everyone always asked what Kim did with the ring - she silently gave it back over a year ago! And Kris waited until the divorce was final to sell it… The ring is definitely not worth $2 million, not even half of that.\"\n\nKardashian and Humphries married in August 2011 before the reality TV star filed for divorce after just 72 days, with the former couple only finalising their split in May of this year.\n\nAt 8.00am, we wrote...\n\nTHE CLUE IS IN THE SOURCE, PEOPLE.\n\nThat's E! Online, in case you're wondering. And it's the E! network that produces Keeping Up With The Kardashians. So we're guessing rumours that Kanye West proposed to Kim Kardashian on her 33rd birthday yesterday are true.\n\nWest popped the question at the AT & T Park in San Francisco last night.\n\nThe rapper rented out the entire baseball stadium especially for the occasion.\n\nThe venue, if you're wondering, just so happens to be near to San Jose, where Kanye continues the next leg of his Yeezus Tour this week.\n\nKim and the Kardashian family were seen boarding a private jet that afternoon in Los Angeles. The klan were then seen clambering out of large vehicles and filing into the stadium for the big revelation.\n\nKanye popped the question shortly after serenading Kim Kardashian with a 50 piece orchestra. The band played Lana Del Rey's Young & Beautiful, followed by, as standard, a Kanye West song, Knock You Down.\n\nKris Jenner shared a photo with E! that showed Kanye spelling out the words \"PLEEESE MARRY MEEE!!!\" on a giant scoreboard (yes, he did spell 'please' wrong).\n\nKanye gave Kim a 15 carat diamond ring, before fireworks exploded in the sky. Her family then ran out of the dugouts and surprised the couple.\n\nKhloe Kardashian tweeted:\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThe couple have been \"official\" since April 2012. They welcomed their first child, baby North West, in June 2013.\n\nEarlier the same day, Kanye was at the Hollywood Film Awards, where he presented director Steve McQueen with a special prize.\n\nKris Jenner opened up about her daughter Kim's plans to marry Kanye West way back in June. The 57-year-old \"momager\" said that if Kim and Kanye get married, it would be a small and \"private\" occasion, unlike her televised wedding to Kris Humphries in 2011.\n\nSpeaking to The Hollywood Reporter, Jenner said: \"This time it will be private and smaller, if she does get married again - not 500 people.\" Meanwhile, the Kardashian matriarch also took to her personal website yesterday to send Kim a gushing birthday message, which called her daughter \"one of the true lights in my life.\"\n\nHowever, it wasn't just Kris who made a fuss of Kim Kardashian on her 33rd birthday, as the rest of her family members also came forward to wish the reality TV star a happy birthday over social media. In, arguably, the most touching messages to be sent to the birthday girl was an open letter from Kim's sister, Khloe who wrote: \"My real life Princess Jasmine!!! You truly are a princess to me! So perfect, so strong, so sweet…. Thank God I have you as my sister! With every year I am more and more grateful for our bond. The woman and mommy you have become is inspirational.\n\nShe added: \"Thank you for being such an amazing sister and friend! I love you Keeks!!! More and more with everyday! May this year continue to be filled with blessings for you! KoKo loves KiKi!!!!!!!!\" However, Kim's youngest sisters Kendall and Kyle also posted birthday messages to the star with the eldest Jenner sister posting a montage of photos of the pair on Instagram alongside the caption: \"Wishing my big sister a very happy birthday today! I hope you have a great day Kimmie! I love you with all my ❤❤\" Meanwhile, Kylie Jenner posted: \"Happy birthday to my big sis & my best friend @kimkardashian thank u for always being right by my side when I need you. I love you ❤❤\"\n\nSOURCE: E! ONLINE"
