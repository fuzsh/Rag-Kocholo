        "text": "KIM Kardashian is hot property right now, following her split from husband Kanye West.\n\nWith the Skims founder reportedly single, fans want to know more about her romantic history, which includes a short-lived marriage and a couple of highly publicized relationships.\n\nDamon Thomas\n\nKim Kardashian was only 19 when she eloped with music producer Damon Thomas, who was 10 years her senior.\n\nThey got hitched in Las Vegas in 2000.\n\nNot much is known about their marriage, but it reportedly lasted three years.\n\nIn an episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Kim dished that she was in her \"wild phase\" when she was married to Thomas.\n\n“I got married on ecstasy. The first time,” she said.\n\n“I did ecstasy once and I got married. I did it again, I made a sex tape. Like, everything bad would happen.”\n\nIn their divorce proceedings, Kim argued that Thomas \"did not want me to have contact with my old boyfriends, who would be able to reach me at the clothing store.\"\n\n\"He said he wanted to know where I was at all times,\" she said.\n\nMeanwhile, Thomas told InTouch that Kim wasn't who the public thought she was.\n\n“She can’t write or sing or dance, so she does harmful things in order to validate herself in the media,” he divulged.\n\n“That’s a fame-w**** to me. It’s just not cool at all.”\n\nRay J\n\nOne of Kim's more controversial lovers, she dated Ray J from 2003 to 2006.\n\nThey met through Ray J's sister Brandy, whom Kim was working for as a stylist.\n\nIn Ray J's memoir titled Death of the Cheating Man, he wrote that Kim made the first move, and it happened when she was still married to Damon Thomas.\n\n“To be honest, the whole thing started off wrong. We’d known each other for a while before we dated and there was a mutual attraction, but she was married,\" he penned.\n\n\"She let me know she wanted to get with me. She left her husband for me as soon as we started having sex and things between us got intense really fast. After that, I felt obligated to be with her.”\n\nWhile their relationship fizzled out in 2006, the two would continue to make headlines over the years due to their leaked sex tape, which was released in 2007.\n\nKim hasn't said much about her time with Ray J, but the singer alleged that the sex tape was not leaked, and was instead \"a deal and a partnership between Kris Jenner and Kim and me.\"\n\nNick Lachey\n\nKim and 98 Degrees member Nick Lachey were never serious, but the pair notably went on a date in 2006, around half a year since he split from Jessica Simpson.\n\nThey went to see a movie but were startled to discover that a large number of photographers were lingering in the area.\n\nLachey doesn't consider Kim one of his exes, however, telling Watch What Happens Live: \"To say that she's my ex is a little bit of a liberal use of the term. She left about halfway through and went to the restroom and then shockingly there were 25 paparazzi when we left the theater. I think there were other things in play on our little rendezvous.\"\n\nNick Cannon\n\nKim reportedly had a brief relationship with Masked Singer host Nick Cannon between 2006 and 2007.\n\nCannon said that it ended because Kim wasn't being completely honest about having had a sex tape with Ray J.\n\n“If she might have been honest with me, I might have tried to hold her down and be, like, ‘That was before me.’ She’s actually one of the nicest people you’ll ever meet,” he said.\n\n“But the fact that she lied and told me that there was no tape….?”\n\nBut he said that Kim was \"one of the nicest people you'll ever meet.\"\n\nReggie Bush\n\nReggie Bush was one of Kim's exes who was featured on the Kardashians' famous reality show.\n\nAt one point, Kim said that the former NFL star might be the one.\n\nShe told People: \"I think I finally made the right choice. He's just a really sweet, normal guy. \"\n\nBut the two eventually called it quits after around two years of dating, with reports saying that it was primarily due to long distance.\n\n\"They never get to see each other, ever. It's been a long time coming. They still love each other and are part of their lives, but Reggie spends six months out of the year in New Orleans, so it's tough,\" a source said at the time.\n\nSpeaking with ESPN, the former athlete also shared that the media attention got too much.\n\n\"When I started dating my ex, that’s when all this stuff [media attention] came.\n\n\"The gossip magazines and all the other stuff, the ugly side of it. But you know what, I wouldn’t change anything because it helped mold and shape who I am today and I’m a better man for it.\"\n\nCristiano Ronaldo\n\nIn early 2010, Page Six reported that Kim had a tryst with football star Cristiano Ronaldo when she was on vacation in Madrid.\n\nBut it was apparently a one-time thing, as he soon moved on with Irina Shayk.\n\nWhen reports surfaced that they had gotten back together, a source shot the rumors down.\n\n“Kim and Cristiano bumped into each other and chatted as friends. He’s still with [model] Irina Shayk, and Kim doesn’t have time for a relationship,\" they dished.\n\nMiles Austin\n\nKim dated Dallas Cowboys player Miles Austin in the summer of 2010.\n\nBut their relationship was also short-lived due to their busy schedules.\n\n\"There's no huge reason except their distance apart. With his season and Kim's filming it just slowly split them apart. They tried to keep it as low profile as possible when they were together,\" People reported at the time.\n\nMichael Copon\n\nIn October 2010, reports surfaced that Kim and One Tree Hill star Michael Copon were an item.\n\n\"Kim is dating Michael. They have known each other for years, but he and Kim just recently reconnected,\" a source shared with InTouch.\n\nBut Copon squashed all speculations, telling Hollywood Life that while they met on Beyond the Break, nothing romantic had happened between them.\n\n\"She is very held back, reserved, knows what she wants,” he said.\n\n“I have nothing negative to say about Kim, she is a sweet girl. [But] she is an independent woman doing her thing. I respect any women that does her thing.”\n\nJohn Mayer\n\nShortly after the reports that Kim had dated Michael Copon, there were speculations that she had moved on to John Mayer.\n\nTMZ reported that they had \"gone out\" together multiple times and that they \"hit it off\" right away.\n\nWhile insiders say that it was \"nothing serious,\" neither party had confirmed that they indeed dated.\n\nYears later, Mayer would be linked to Kourtney Kardashian, but he explicitly denied that they were a thing.\n\nIn an interview with Andy Cohen, Mayer suggested that the rumors may have been orchestrated by the Kardashians themselves.\n\n\"If the call is coming from inside the house…it’s diabolical and genius,\" he said.\n\n\"Because when people start gossiping about you and someone else, and they start putting your pictures together, it gets real suggestive.\"\n\nGabriel Aubry\n\nIn November 2010, it was reported that Kim was dating Gabriel Aubry following his split from actress Halle Berry.\n\n\"They started seeing each other in the last few weeks. They have been out a few times, he’s visited her house in LA. Sunday’s game was the first time they were comfortable enough to be seen in public together. It’s early days but they’re getting on well,\" a source told Page Six.\n\nBut while they were spotted in public together, their relationship didn't turn into anything serious.\n\nKim was apparently intimidated by the fact that he was Berry's ex.\n\n\"It was just too much to handle for Kim,\" an insider said.\n\n\"She realized very quickly they were better off as friends.\"\n\nKris Humphries\n\nKim Kardashian had a very public whirlwind romance with basketball player Kris Humphries.\n\nThey started dating in late 2010, got engaged in May 2011, and tied the knot in August 2011.\n\nThe former lovebirds had a star-studded ceremony in California, which was documented in a two-part special in Keeping Up with the Kardashians.\n\nHowever, just after 72 days, Kim and Humphries called it quits, citing irreconcilable differences as the key reason.\n\n\"I hope everyone understands this was not an easy decision. I had hoped this marriage was forever, but sometimes things don't work out as planned. We remain friends and wish each other the best,\" Kim noted in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile, Humphries shot down speculations that their marriage was merely a publicity stunt.\n\n\"There’s definitely a lot about that world that is not entirely real. But our actual relationship was 100 percent real,\" he told Players Tribune.\n\n\"When it was clear that it wasn’t working…what can I say? It sucked.\n\n\"It’s never easy to go through the embarrassment of something like that - with your friends, with your family, but when it plays out so publicly, in front of the world, it’s a whole other level. It was brutal.”\n\nShengo Deane\n\nPer reports, Kim dated her former bodyguard Shengo Deane after she divorced Kris Humphries.\n\nShe once described him as \"tall, dark, and has the sexiest Australian accent\" and \"the best kiss ever!\"\n\nIn an interview with Woman's Day, Deane said that their fling fizzled out when he could no longer work for her.\n\n\"She wanted to use me as a bodyguard, but her business manager said that security had already been arranged,” he said.\n\n“I wish we could’ve worked together, but I understand it could have been completely misconstrued.”\n\nHe also added that it was tough keeping up with Kim's lifestyle at the time.\n\n\"They are a beautiful family and I enjoyed being part of that, but I didn’t really have a lot of work over there and I didn’t want to have to ask for $50 to go to the movies.\"\n\nKanye West\n\nAfter her devastating divorce from Kris Humphries, Kim said that Kanye West had been a pillar of support, with the rapper flying her to Paris for his fashion show.\n\nKim admitted that she \"fell madly in love with him\" then and wondered why they hadn't dated sooner.\n\nRoughly after two years after they began dating, the pair welcomed their first child, North.\n\nMonths later, West rented out AT&T Park in San Francisco and got down on one knee.\n\nThey tied the knot in May 2014 at Forte di Belvedere in Florence, Italy.\n\nThe two welcomed three more children since: Saint in 2015, Chicago in 2018, and Psalm in 2019.\n\nIn February 2021, Kim filed for divorce, later explaining on Keeping Up with the Kardashians that she had grown tired of West's lifestyle.\n\n\"I honestly can't do this anymore,\" she said.\n\n\"Why am I still in this, like, place where I'm stuck for years? Like, he goes and moves to a different state, every year, I have to be together so I can raise the kids, you know? And he's an amazing dad, he's done an amazing job.\"\n\nShe added that she could no longer \"support his every move, and go follow him all over the place, and move to Wyoming.\"\n\nKim said upon turning 40, she realized that she and West were no longer aligned with what they wanted in life and their marriage.\n\n\"I realized, 'No, I don't want a husband that lives in a completely different state.'\n\n\"To me, I thought, 'Oh my god, that's when we're getting along the best,' but then that is sad to me and that's not what I want.\n\n\"I want someone that we have the same shows in common; I want someone that wants to work out with me... it's like the little things is what I don't have.\"\n\nThe two finalized their divorce in November 2022, with Kim noting that West \"will always be family.\"\n\nVan Jones\n\nKim was rumored to be dating CNN host Van Jones following her separation from Kanye.\n\nWhile she didn't deny that she had re-entered the dating pool, she did shoot down reports she was seeing Van.\n\n\"Van texted me and was like, 'This rumor has gotten me so many dates, and I am so grateful,'\" she said.\n\nPete Davidson\n\nKim met comedian Pete Davidson during a night out with Kanye in 2019, with the two reconnecting in 2021 when she hosted Saturday Night Live, where Davidson had been a cast member.\n\nIn an episode of The Kardashians, Kim admitted that she made the first move.\n\n\"I called the producer at SNL and was like, 'Hey, do you have Pete's number?' And they were like, 'Yeah.' I text him. I wasn't even thinking like, 'Oh my God, I'm gonna be in a relationship with him.' I was just thinking, 'Heard about this BDE, need to get out there.' I was just basically DTF.\"\n\nThe two were then spotted getting cozy multiple times around New York and Los Angeles.\n\nIt wasn't until March 2022 that they became Instagram official, and a month later, they graced the Met Gala together as a couple.\n\nTheir romance fizzled out by August 2022 after nine months of dating.\n\nThe split was reportedly amicable, and they decided to part ways because their packed schedules \"made it really difficult to maintain a relationship.\"\n\nKim had no hard feelings whatsoever, sharing on their reality show that the media made their relationship more serious than it actually was.\n\n\"You obviously learn from every situation and the one thing I learned from last situation was the media made me feel like I was in a very serious relationship so quickly,\" she divulged.\n\n\"I just want to sneak around a little bit. There's nothing wrong with wanting to sneak!\"\n\nTom Brady\n\nIn May 2023, reports surfaced that Kim was dating NFL legend Tom Brady.\n\nHowever, they quickly denied the rumors, with insiders noting that their relationship was strictly professional.\n\nKim reportedly got in contact with Brady to ask for advice about buying a property in the Bahamas.\n\n\"Kim and Tom are friendly,\" a source told Page Six.\n\n\"She phoned him and asked him for his advice on Baker's Bay. She was later spotted being driven around the resort in a golf cart, but it didn't belong to Tom, and he wasn't in the Bahamas when she visited in May.\n\nOdell Beckham Jr.\n\nAs it turns out, it's a different NFL pro that Kim has the hots for.\n\nIn September 2023, reports say that she was \"hanging out\" with Odell Beckham Jr. of the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nThey have yet to confirm whether or not they're an item, but Kim reportedly attended Beckham's 31st birthday party in November 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, a source close to the entrepreneur told E! News that Kim is indeed friends with Beckham, but she's not looking to enter a serious relationship at the moment.\n\n\"Kim and Odell are friends and have a lot of mutual friends in common,\" they said.\n\n\"She's not seriously dating anyone at the moment but open to finding love again if she meets the right person. Right now her main focus is on her kids and her businesses.\"\n\nOn March 10, 2024, Odell and Kim were spotted together at Beyoncé and Jay-Z's Oscars after party at Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles, California."
