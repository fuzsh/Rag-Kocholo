In the pictures, the couple embraced rock 'n' roll chic with matching black fur jackets, shimmery unbuttoned blouses and leather pants for their ceremony.\n\nThe celebrity hairstylist extended a \"big thank you\" to Kim Kardashian and Shania Twain in his caption.\n\nAppleton's photos and videos reveal Kardashian officiated the wedding and Twain serenaded the couple with her 1997 hit \"You're Still The One.\"\n\nKim Kardashian reveals wild Vegas night while honoring hairstylist Chris Appleton with North\n\nGage, 27, shared the same photos and videos on his Instagram, captioning his post, \"ring finger where the rock is.\"\n\nThe hairstylist and \"You\" actor tied the knot just a month after going public about their relationship.\n\nAppleton was honored with the hair artist of the year award at Sunday's Fashion Los Angeles Awards hosted by Daily Front Row Magazine. Kardashian led a tribute, telling the audience, \"I can tell him all of my personal business, and it will never get out. We can party in Vegas all night long until three in the morning and get tattoos – (but) not me – like we did last night. That's why we're a little tired.\"\n\nThe trio had a night out enjoying Usher's residency in Vegas.\n\nKardashians hairstylist Chris Appleton reveals he's 'very much in love' with 'You' actor Lukas Gage\n\nIt's unclear if Appleton and Gage tied the knot before or after the award ceremony, but Kardashian briefly interrupted Appleton's speech to congratulate him on his relationship with Gage, who also attended the ceremony.\n\n\"I am so happy he's in a relationship right now, and that it's, like, out there,\" she said. \"I'm so tired of all my girlfriends and guy friends asking me if you're available.\""
