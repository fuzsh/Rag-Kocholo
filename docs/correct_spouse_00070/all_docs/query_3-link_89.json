        "text": "Kim Kardashian has opened up about how the actions of her ex-husband, Kanye West, have affected her and their children, implying that the situation is worse than she lets on in the public eye.\n\nIn the latest episode of The Kardashians , the mum-of-four was seen crying to her mother, Kris Jenner, about her ex's actions.\n\n\"I'm stuck with this for the rest of my life, and I'm just so overwhelmed,\" the 42-year-old told her mum, adding that she is most worried about her kids being affected.\n\nREAD MORE: Harry's drug use admission leads to court case\n\n\"That's the tragic part of the whole story,\" agreed mum Jenner as she consoled her daughter.\n\n\"I still feel the need to not talk about it and protect it from my kids and I always will feel that way, but God, if people knew ... I just would never do that to my kids. It just is really crazy,\" reflected Kim in a confessional.\n\n\"It's the hardest feeling to watch someone you really loved and you have a family with just be so different than who you knew.\"\n\nKardashian and West were married from 2014 to 2021, when she filed for divorce from the rapper. Throughout their marriage he made a number of erratic remarks online including personal details about his family, even speaking badly about Jenner.\n\nFollowing the divorce filing, his barbs turned to Kardashian's new boyfriend, Pete Davidson, the culmination of which caused Kardashian to state in a court hearing that they remarks caused \"emotional distress\". She was ruled legally single on March 2, 2022.\n\nWest, 47, has since reportedly married an employee from his company, Australian Yeezy designer Bianca Censori in an intimate ceremony, and has remained out of the public eye.\n\nREAD MORE: The nine best foundations for dry and ageing skin\n\nKardashian shared that West may have to experience hitting \"rock bottom\" before he realises the impact of his actions.\n\n\"Sometimes I feel like if he were to hit rock bottom, that's his journey that he needs to figure out on his own,\" she said.\n\n\"I used to run around and call everyone behind his back, and be like, 'It's gonna be OK, it's gonna be OK, don't worry. Just give him another chance,'\" Kardashian reflected.\n\n\"I used to spend hours and hours and hours of my day to be the clean-up crew. I just don't have that energy.\"\n\nJenner reminded her daughter: \"Well, that's why you got divorced because you can't do that to yourself. You never deserve to live like that.\"\n\nThe mother-daughter pair also spoke about the children she and West share – North, nine, Saint, seven, Chicago, five, and Psalm, four – and whether they know about their father's recent actions.\n\nJenner shared that it \"Breaks (her) heart\" that North, the eldest of the children, likely knows about her father's erratic nature, but Kardashian disputed this, adding that she took every measure to prevent her children from learning about anything unfavourable through the media.\n\nREAD MORE: Doctor's shock discovery in five-year-old's stomach\n\n\"She actually doesn't know and that's what's so crazy. When stuff is said, it's a chain to my whole household. No TV, only Apple TV. I can't risk an Access Hollywood … or anything on the news coming up with their dad mentioned and they want to watch,\" she explained.\n\n\"I have to figure out a way to protect and so they still haven't seen anything, but then I go into crisis mode.\"\n\n\"I'm the one being accused of so many things and being blamed for so many things and it's really hurtful and it sucks,\" the SKIMS founder added.\n\n\"But, I can control how I react and I can control if I'm a mess, [and] then my kids will see that … I really do believe in my soul that one day, my kids will appreciate my silence, my understanding and my grace, and I will try my hardest to keep it together at all times.\"\n\nNine Entertainment Co (the publisher of this website) owns and operates the streaming service Stan.\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, subscribe to our newsletter here."
