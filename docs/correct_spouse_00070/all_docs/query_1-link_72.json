        "text": "Much of the news this week has been concerned with the ephemeral marriage of Kim Kardashian, whose relationship with her ex-husband is now being picked apart for signs of rot. There are multiple articles devoted to analyzing footage from the beginning of the marriage, and if those articles are puerile, then the comments are the stuff of dying brains. Comparisons with other celebrities who have dabbled in domesticity, complex breakdowns of the financial process of the the prenups, the nups and the post—you name it, and it’s there, floating on the Internet like the debris of some vast (and vastly bored) sea creature.\n\nOne interesting subset of criticism, however, has focused less on the specifics of the Kardashian debacle and more on how her marriage exemplifies the casualness with which Americans treat matrimony in this day and age. Just as with Britney Spears’ three-day marriage, and with all those other celebrities to whom she has recently been compared, Kim Kardashian has inspired a lot of talk about how “the sanctity of marriage”—implicitly, of heterosexual marriage—has already been damaged more thoroughly by the actions of Kardashian and people like her than it ever could be by the legalization of gay marriage.\n\nI sympathize with the guiding impetus behind this kind of observation: it’s glib, but it comes from deep-seated frustration about sanctity-based arguments being treated as valid political reasoning, despite standing in direct opposition to one of the tenets upon which our country is founded, namely the separation of church and state. Unfortunately, by mocking Kardashian’s marriage as an example of sanctified love, you are actually perpetuating the idea that marriage should bear any relationship to holiness.\n\nThere’s nothing wrong, of course, with believing that by marrying someone you are joining your flesh unto theirs, entering into a covenant both with your spouse and with God, etc., etc. But the fact is that such beliefs need to be separated from marriage as a politically ordained institution. As long as marriage is a function of the state, it can’t be defined in terms of divinity. It can depend on nothing less or more than the consent of the two people involved.\n\nSo to say, even mockingly, that Kim Kardashian did injury to all of marriage by divorcing her husband 72 days in is to imply that Kim Kardashian was doing something wrong by marrying so briefly; that lifelong gay marriages would be worthier than her temporary one because they would somehow be more honorable. That’s not how it works. The fight for civil rights is not a fight for God or honor or the protection of this or that social more; it’s a fight for opportunity. Right now, in the majority of states, gay marriage isn’t legal and neither is gay divorce. That demands change—not the flightiness of celebrities or the hypocrisy of late-night talk show hosts. All those telltale tics that marked out Ms. Kardashian’s enterprise as doomed from the start mean nothing compared to her decisions and her ability to make those decisions. Would that everyone, regardless of orientation, could be so lucky."
