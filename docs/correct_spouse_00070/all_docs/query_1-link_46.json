        "text": "Call it the end of an era.\n\nOn Friday, Aug. 5, TODAY.com confirmed that Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson have split up after nine months of dating.\n\nKardashian seemingly found love when she was least expecting it. The reality TV star had been linked to comedian Davidson, 28, who announced he was exiting “Saturday Night Live” in 2022, since October 2021, when she hosted the variety show.\n\nSpeaking to Hoda Kotb on her podcast “Making Space,” the mother of four said their romance was “the last thing that (she) was ... planning on.”\n\nKardashian, 41, filed for divorce from Ye, the artist formerly known as Kanye West, in February 2021, after six years of marriage.\n\nKardashian said she took her time before opening herself back up to love — just as her sister, Kourtney Kardashian, did before finding love with husband Travis Barker.\n\n\"I took 10 months or something before I dated or talked to anyone. And I just wanted that time to really figure out and go through the motions: ‘Am I making the right decision? How do I feel about this?’” Kardashian told Hoda.\n\n“So once I went through all of the motions, I finally was, like, ‘OK, guys, I am so ready to meet someone.’ And I randomly did,” Kardashian continued.\n\nThe duo first met on \"Saturday Night Live.\" Months later, and the now-established couple is prone to sharing (non-scripted) kisses on social media. They often sport little tributes to each other: Kardashian got a bedazzled “P” on her nail, and Davidson got tattoos in Kardashian’s honor. They attend events like the Queen's Platinum Jubilee in London and the White House Correspondents Dinner together.\n\nRead on for their relationship timeline, in their own words.\n\nKardashian said Davidson calmed her down ahead of ‘SNL’ hosting gig in Oct. 2021\n\nKim Kardashian agreed to host “SNL” without ever having watched an episode on TV, she revealed on Amanda Hirsch’s “Not Skinny But Not Fat“ podcast in April 2022. Instead, she had gotten a front-row seat to the show, thanks to watching Ye perform.\n\nAs a result, Kardashian had some nerves ahead of her hosting gig. “I didn’t want to go and embarrass myself and get up there and not be funny,” she said.\n\nBut she had a little bit of help.\n\nOn the first-ever episode of “The Kardashians,” the family’s new reality show on Hulu, she recalled how Davidson helped her get into a positive mindset during a brief encounter at the Met Gala in 2021.\n\n“I ran into Pete Davidson at the Met and I was like, ‘I am so scared. I don’t know what I signed up for,’” she recalled on the show.\n\nDavidson knew just what to say, according to Kardashian. “He’s like, ‘Can you read cue cards? You’re good. You’re good,’” she added.\n\nDavidson also offered her his phone number in case she needed any advice. There was just one problem: Her outfit.\n\n“I had gloves on and I couldn’t get in my phone with the gloves and I was like, ‘Oh, I have gloves and I can’t...” And he was like, ‘Alright cool.’ And he walked away. But I was going to be like, ‘Oh, but take mine,’” Kardashian said on “Not Skinny But Not Fat.”\n\nOn the podcast, Kardashian revealed that Davidson had been trying to get her number prior to that interaction. “And everyone wasn’t really sure like, ‘Is she going through a divorce?’ He just wanted to wait a little bit,” Kardashian explained.\n\nKardashian described their first kiss — which was televised\n\nThe couple kissed for the first time as part of their Aladdin-themed “SNL” sketch on October 9. They actually met for the first time earlier that day.\n\n“We met that day (of filming). He came and we did one dress rehearsal and then the real thing,” she said on the episode of “Not Skinny But Not Fat.”\n\nKardashian said she felt a connection during that first kiss.\n\n“When we kissed, I was just like, hmm. It was a stage kiss, but it was like still a little zing, you know? It wasn’t anything like a super crazy feeling. I was just like, hmm,” she said.\n\nKardashian said she asked Davidson for his number and pursued the connection\n\nOn Season 1, Episode 8, of \"The Kardashians,\" Kardashian said that her kiss with Davidson made her realize that she should probably \"try something different\" in her love life, so she invited him to her \"SNL\" after-party. However, Davidson didn't attend.\n\nHe “does not give me the time of day,” she remarked.\n\nSo, Kardashian decided to pursue him wholeheartedly. \"A few days later, I called the producer at ‘SNL’ and I was like, ‘Hey, do you have Pete’s number?’ And they were like, ‘Yeah,’ and I text him. I wasn’t even thinking like, ‘Oh my god, I’m going to be in a relationship with him.’ I was just thinking like: heard about this BDE, need to get out there, like I need to just like jumpstart my — I was just basically DTF.”\n\n(Translation: DTF is an abbreviation for “down to f--k\" and BDE means \"big d--k energy.\")\n\nKardashian noted that once she started dating Davidson, Megan Fox texted her and told her how surprised she was about their relationship, especially since Davidson once asked her and fiancé Machine Gun Kelly if they could give him Kardashian's number.\n\n“After we got together and it was like a thing, Megan Fox texted me and is like, ‘Is this s--t for real? Because he asked me for your number months ago and like, I was like, 'Dude, you have a better shot of like, me and MGK getting eaten by crocodiles than you ever getting her number like never gonna happen. Do not ask us,’” the reality TV star said of their conversation.\n\nOn the show, Kardashian also hinted that she's been having great sex with Davidson by saying her grandmother once told her that she'll have \"the best sex\" in her 40s, and that she agrees.\n\n\"I was like, OK. I'm ready. And so far...,\" she added as she winked and cracked a smile to Khloé and Kourtney Kardashian.\n\nThey made their public debut in Oct. 2021, but subtly went Instagram official in March 2022\n\nKardashian and Davidson were spotted holding hands on a date at Knott’s Scary Farm in Buena Park, California in late October. Davidson also appeared in Kardashian's beach-set Instagram pictures from a Bahamas trip in January 2022 — but only as a shadow.\n\nAfter months of speculation, Kardashian publicly acknowledged her romantic relationship with Davidson through an image gallery posted to Instagram in March 2022.\n\nScroll to the fourth photo. Davidson lays on top of Kardashian’s lap, and she looks down making a kissing face.\n\nThis served as confirmation of the relationship. As she joked to Ellen DeGeneres during a March 2021 taping of her show, \"it's not official until you post.\"\n\nHowever, Davidson was spotted with Kardashian in an Instagram post before then — but on Flava Flav’s account.\n\nSpeaking to Entertainment Tonight, Flavor Flav said Kardashian set up the meeting for Davidson’s 28th birthday in November.\n\n“One thing that I could say is Pete Davidson loves himself some Flavor Flav. Everything he does is, ‘Flavor Flav this, Flavor Flav that, Flavor Flav this, Flavor Flav that.’ So Kim said, ‘OK, well, for your birthday, you are going to have Flavor Flav.’ She sent for me and that’s how I ended up there,” he explained.\n\nDavidson met Kardashian's kids when the time was right\n\nOn the June 21 episode of TODAY, Kardashian said that she let Davidson meet her children six months after they started dating.\n\n“Luckily, I have a sister that has been through it all and we talked about it and I consulted with a few therapists and friends that have been through it. So I definitely wanted to wait six months and that was the marker,” she said. “And I think it’s different for everyone and different things work for different people, but you just have to do what feels right and try to just be as respectful and cautious as possible.”\n\nKardashian spoke about the relationship publicly for the first time in March 2022\n\nDuring aan interview with Variety, Kardashian talked about her new Hulu reality TV show, “The Kardashians,” and revealed why fans wouldn’t see Davidson in an episode.\n\n“I have not filmed with him,” she said. “And I’m not opposed to it. It’s just not what he does.”\n\nKardashian said the show would explain how they met, and “all the details everyone wants to know.”\n\nHe could show up in future seasons, however. Kardashian added, “But if there was an event happening and he was there, he wouldn’t tell the cameras to get away. I think I might film something really exciting coming, but it wouldn’t be for this season.”\n\nHere's why Kardashian was hesitant to talk about Davidson on the show\n\nAt the April 2022 premiere of “The Kardashians,” Kardashian explained why her romance never became a plot line in Season One.\n\nShe said she was “absolutely” hesitant to talk about their relationship because their love story is so new. “I didn’t want to meet someone, go on a date, and then talk about it on the show,” she told E! News at the Los Angeles event — though he's confirmed to appear in Season Two.\n\nDavidson was also at the April 2022 premiere, but didn’t walk with her. “He’s here to support me. It’s my thing,” Kardashian explained. “I don’t think it’s his thing to be all up here with me. So, I’m just so happy he’s here.”\n\nAfter the premiere, the duo met up for a “late nite snack,” which she posted about on Instagram.\n\nKardashian's approach to sharing their relationship? 'Just give a glimpse'\n\nKardashian is selective with what she shares of their relationship on Instagram, according to a March 2022 interview on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show.\"\n\n“I have the cutest pictures of us and I want to be like, ‘Oh, my God, we’re so cute.’ But then I’m like, you know, ‘Don’t be so desperate. Don’t be posting so much, just give a glimpse,’” Kardashian told DeGeneres.\n\n“I don’t know what the right thing to do is. Like, I haven’t dated in since before Instagram existed. Yeah, I don’t know what the rules are.”\n\nKardashian continues to show more glimpses, however. In May, Kardashian posted a short video of Davidson kissing her to her Instagram story.\n\nThey made their red carpet debut in May 2022\n\nThe couple attended the White House Correspondents Dinner in May 2022. \"White House din din,\" Kardashian captioned Instagram photos from the event, where journalists and comedians gather for a roast of the current presidential administration.\n\nDavidson will appear on Season 2 of 'The Kardashians'\n\nDavidson appeared in the teaser for the second season of \"The Kardashians,\" released in July — and his debut was steamy.\n\n“Babe, do you want to shower with me really quick?” Kardashian asks. Davidson throws what he's holding in the air and follows her.\n\nKardashian 'let go' and opened herself up to the connection\n\nWhile talking with Hoda on her “Making Space” podcast, Kardashian said that she didn’t expect to be in a relationship with Davidson because it happened when she “least expected it.\"\n\n“It was the last thing that I was really planning on,” she said. “And so when it did happen, we were kind of, like, ‘Oh, my God, I wasn’t planning on this. And this isn’t even what I was thinking of,’ and it just makes it that much sweeter and so much more fun,” Kardashian said.\n\nWhen the duo started dating, the KKW Beauty founder didn’t find it necessary to keep her guard up. Her ongoing divorce, essentially, didn’t stop her from opening herself up to new love.\n\n“We all know someone that’s been through a really hard time in relationships and everyone’s been OK and everyone comes out OK,” she said. “So you just have to ... let yourself go and open yourself up to receive something and just be a good person and you’ll get that back.”\n\nKardashian noted that she hasn’t been entirely open about her relationship with Davidson. In fact, she’s been keeping “certain aspects” of their love story private so they can stay in their small “little bubble” sometimes.\n\nShe addressed their age difference of 13 years\n\nKardashian is 41 and Davidson is 28, giving them an age difference of 13 years.\n\nSpeaking to E! News, Kardashian addressed their age gap with a wink. She said when it comes to relationships, she goes off vibes: \"Whatever good vibes are, that’s what you should go for.”\n\n“If it’s older, younger, doesn’t even matter. But younger ... I’m not mad at it,\" she said.\n\nKardashian posted PDA-filled photos from their tropical vacation\n\nIn June 2022, the couple went on a vacation to an unspecified location, and posted many rounds of beachside photos.\n\n\"Beach for 2,\" Kardashian wrote in the first batch, which included a kissing snapshot.\n\n\"Stranded,\" she wrote in the second.\n\nDuring a June 21 appearance on TODAY, Kardashian talked about that vaca she took with Davidson and said it felt like \"heaven\" to be away from the kids.\n\n\"I would say the best way to describe it was just really relaxing,\" she said. \"Like to be away from four kids for just even a few days is heaven.\"\n\nDavidson got tattoos in Kardashian's honor — and her name branded on his chest\n\nSpeaking to Ellen DeGeneres on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show,\" Kardashian confirmed that Davidson got \"a few tattoos\" in her honor. \"A few cute ones,\" she added.\n\n\"That's what tattoo people do. They get tattoos of what's going on in their life,\" Kardashian said. Davidson also had tattoos dedicated to his ex-fiancée, Ariana Grande.\n\nOn her Instagram Story, Kardashian posted a photo of one of those tattoos. It says, “My girl is a lawyer.”\n\nDavidson also has her name, \"Kim,\" branded on his chest — literally. \"He wanted to do something that was really different,\" Kardashian told Ellen. \"He wanted something's that's there ... He said, 'I don't want to be able to get rid of it.'\"\n\nKardashian and Davidson break up in August 2022\n\nIn August 2022, Kardashian and Davidson called it quits.\n\nAccording to E! News, the couple amicably broke up due to their hectic schedules and long distance. Kardashian is based in Los Angeles, while Davidson lives in New York City.\n\nKardashian and Davidson reunite in 2023 at the Met Gala\n\nAt the 2023 Met Gala, Kardashian and Davidson reunited when they crossed paths inside the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nThe pair were photographed talking to Usher inside the event and they appeared to be having a friendly and playful conversation."
