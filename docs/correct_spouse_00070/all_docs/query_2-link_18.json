        "text": "By Larry Stansbury\n\nNov. 8 2023, Updated 2:32 p.m. ET\n\nEven though Kim Kardashian has had two high-profile marriages, The Kardashians star has actually had three marriages.\n\nShe tied the knot with ex Kris Humphries in 2011 in a lavish $6 million wedding — but their marriage only ended up lasting 72 days. Then, the reality TV star was married to Kanye West from 2014 to 2021, and the couple shares four children: North, Saint, Chicago, and Psalm West.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nWhat some fans might not know is that before Kris and Kanye, Kim previously eloped with a man named Damon Thomas. Let's take a look at what we know about Damon, from his career, and the several reasons they divorced.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nKim Kardashian's first husband, Damon Thomas, is a music producer.\n\nAt 29, Damon was 10 years older than Kim when they married in January 2000. They ended up divorcing in 2004. Today, Damon has a son, whom he shares with his ex-girlfriend Sarai Torres.\n\nDamon is also in a pop production group, The Underdogs with Harvey Mason Jr., and they have worked with artists such as Chris Brown, R. Kelly, Pink, and Lionel Richie for several years.\n\nDamon also helped produce a number of movies, including Dreamgirls, The Help, and Pitch Perfect.\n\nKim says she was on ecstasy when she married Damon.\n\nAccording to USA Today, Kim says she blames getting married to being on ecstasy. \"I got married on ecstasy,\" Kim admitted on an episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nShe also admitted that Damon was very controlling over her. Kim revealed in a KUWTK episode that \"Damon decided what we would do and when we would do it. He was very much the ‘king of the castle.’”\n\nHe made her quit her job in retail and drop out of college. “He said he did not want me to have contact with my old boyfriends who would be able to reach me at the clothing store.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nHe also pressured Kim to plastic surgery. Kim got liposuction to make her look “perfect,” and he paid for the procedure. Then, he pushed her to get an additional $1,000 worth of surgeries.\n\n“Damon told me not to leave the house unless I first told him when and where I was going,” she said. “If Damon were not home, I was required to call him and ask permission to leave the house.”\n\nDamon reportedly tried to come between Kim and her family.\n\nThe music producer reportedly tried to brainwash Kim into thinking her family was “evil.” According to The Daily Mail, a source said “he allegedly showed naked pictures of one of Kim’s sisters to her father [and branded] the siblings ‘whores.’” Yikes.\n\n\"Kim is obsessed with fame,\" Damon told the New York Daily News. \"She can't write or sing or dance, so she does harmful things in order to validate herself in the media. That's a fame-whore to me. It's just not cool at all.\"\n\nAnd now you're all caught up on Kim Kardashian's first husband! Regardless of what Damon did or didn't do during his marriage to Kim, it's pretty clear their divorce was for the best."
