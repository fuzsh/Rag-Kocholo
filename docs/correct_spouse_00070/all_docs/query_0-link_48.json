        "text": "Mark Thompson/Getty Images\n\nThe most talked about \"wedding\" of the year in this country was the Kim Kardashian-Kris Humphries television special. It also became the subject of great controversy when she filed for divorce after 72 days, but Mr. Kardashian is doing his part to make sure that only she looks evil coming out of it.\n\nHumphries not only didn't sign his divorce papers, but took things even further. According to a report from Jennifer Garcia and Ken Lee on People.com, he wants this whole marriage taken off the record.\n\nRather than pursue a divorce as Kardashian has, the NBA player's ultimate intent is to annul the marriage, clearing the record of ever being married to the reality star, the sources say.\n\nShortly after Kardashian traveled to Minnesota and met with Humphries and the pastor who married them, sources close to Humphries insisted he intended to try and move on and sign the divorce papers.\n\nAs someone who has criticized Humphries for his part in this whole sham of a marriage, I have to say that he deserves kudos for this latest development. Even if he isn't able to get it annulled, the fact that he is pursuing it speaks volumes.\n\nThe skeptic in me thinks that perhaps this is some publicity stunt, but what would he really stand to gain from it with the tabloid magazines?\n\nHumphries could have just signed the divorce papers and been done with this. Instead, he wants Kim Kardashian completely wiped off his slate and a chance to start over again. Good for him.\n\nYes, it would have been better if he realized before the wedding was filmed that this might not work, but maybe he really was in love and thought that they would be together forever.\n\nHumphries has a long way to go to repair his credibility because he is not completely innocent in this whole thing, though he is obviously doing his best to make sure that he is never thought of as Mr. Kim Kardashian again."
