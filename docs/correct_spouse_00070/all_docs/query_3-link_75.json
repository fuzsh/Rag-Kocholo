Have an account? .\n\nKim Kardashian officially filed for divorce from Ye (formerly Kanye West) in February 2021.\n\nThe former couple's divorce has been public and messy.\n\nInsider has compiled a list of everything the pair have said about each other since the filing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKim Kardashian filed for divorce from Ye in February 2021.\n\nKim Kardashian filed for divorce from Ye in February after seven years of marriage. A rep for the reality TV star confirmed the news to Insider after rumors of the divorce filing were reported by TMZ.\n\nThe couple married in May 2014 in a ceremony in Italy, and have four children together — North, 7; Saint, 5; Chicago, 2; and Psalm, 1. A source told TMZ that Kim requested a joint legal and physical custody of their four children and said they are \"committed to co-parenting together.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKim discussed the reasons behind her divorce filing during an episode of \"Keeping Up With The Kardashians.\"\n\nBoth Kim Kardashian and Ye stayed quiet about their personal lives for months following the announcement of their divorce filing. During a June episode of \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians,\" however, Kim discussed some of the friction in her relationship with Ye.\n\n\"I just think he deserves someone who will support his every move and will go follow him all over the place and move to Wyoming. I can't do that,\" she said.\n\n\"He should have a wife that supports his every move and travels with him and does everything, and I can't. I feel like a fucking failure. It's my third fucking marriage. Yeah, I feel like a fucking loser. But I can't even think about that. I want to be happy.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKim joked about her divorce from Ye during a monologue on \"SNL.\"\n\nKim Kardashian made her \"Saturday Night Live\" hosting debut in October 2021 and during the show's opening monologue, Kim praised Ye as the \"best rapper of all time\" before talking about their current divorce proceedings.\n\n\"He's the richest Black man in America. A talented, legit genius who gave me four incredible kids,\" she said. \"So, when I divorced him, you have to know it came down to just one thing. His personality.\"\n\nKim also poked fun at Ye's failed political ambitions during the monologue.\n\n\"I'm not running for president. We can't have three failed politicians in one family,\" she said in reference to Ye as well as Caitlyn Jenner who ran for governor of California.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYe slammed Kim Kardashian's \"SNL\" monologue.\n\nPage Six reported that Ye was in the audience during Kim's \"SNL\" monologue, which he'd listened to during rehearsals. However, weeks later, Ye criticized the show's writers for scripting jokes about his divorce proceedings.\n\n\"'SNL' making my wife say 'I divorced him' because they just wanted to get that bar off, and I ain't never even seen the papers, we're not even divorced,\" Ye said on rapper N.O.R.E. & DJ EFN's \"Drink Champs\" podcast in November 2021.\n\nHe added: \"That ain't no joke to me. My kids want their parents to stay together. I want us to be together.\"\n\nThe 44-year-old rapper later added that he believes the media are invested in trying to portray friction between Kim Kardashian and himself.\n\n\"They want it to be a new wedding, a new episode, a new TV show. Then they have people all around and my wife here, you know, this publicist that's next to her — I don't fuck with her,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYe said he believes people are investing in halting Kim Kardashian's law career during a second appearance on the Drink Champs podcast.\n\nYe made a second appearance on N.O.R.E. & DJ EFN's \"Drink Champs\" podcast, during which he said he believed there were people who were invested in making sure Kim Kardashian didn't become a lawyer because of the influence she has on young women.\n\n\"I feel like there are people who might not want Kim Kardashian to become a lawyer because you know what happens when Kim Kardashian becomes a lawyer? That shirt gets a little bit higher. The cleavage gets a little more covered up. It's 14-year-old girls, 17-year-old girls that are posing a little bit they want to become a lawyer,\" he told the podcast.\n\n\"She affects people in that way, and there's people who don't want her to affect women in that way. They want her to affect them in that other way.\"\n\nYe also suggested that some of the lawyers that Kardashian trained with during parts of her legal education negatively affected her performance in law exams.\n\n\"My wife was in a session with the lawyer that was training her, and the lawyer started making bad suggestions, and I was like, 'Man, this dude is an idiot.' They've got an idiot teaching my wife. She gon' fail the bar a third time,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKim Kardashian defended Ye wearing a Make American Great Again hat on \"SNL.\"\n\nKim Kardashian said that she \"learned a lot\" after trying to convince Ye not to wear a Make America Great Again red hat during his 2018 appearance as a musical guest on \"Saturday Night Live.\"\n\nSpeaking to writer Bari Weiss on an episode of Weiss' podcast \"Honestly with Bari Weiss,\" Kim said that she was \"very forceful\" trying to convince Ye not to wear the hat, which was a symbol of his support of Donald Trump.\n\nKim said that her view of the situation had changed in retrospect.\n\n\"Now looking back, I think, why should he take that off if that's what he believes in? Why can't he wear that on TV?\" she said, noting that \"half of the country\" voted for Trump.\n\nKim told Weiss that the experience ultimately taught her \"to be a little more empathetic for people who want to do what they want to,\" and that she respected Ye's knowledge and dedication to his beliefs.\n\n\"To me, that's a good quality to have, no matter who is against you and no matter what the circumstances are,\" she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYe asked Kim Kardashian to \"run right back\" to him during a concert.\n\nYe performed a set alongside Drake at the benefit concert, which was held at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum to raise awareness about former gang leader Larry Hoover, who's serving a life sentence in prison for crimes, including murder, according to the BBC.\n\nDuring the event, Ye performed a medley of his hits, including \"Runaway\" from his 2010 album \"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.\"\n\nDuring the final verse of \"Runaway,\" Ye added a new refrain that made reference to Kim Kardashian.\n\n\"I need you to run right back to me,\" West repeated at the end of the song before adding, \"More specifically, Kimberly.\"\n\nThe new lyrics prompted a huge reaction from the crowd, which was estimated by NME magazine to be 78,000 people, and clips of the moment were shared widely across social media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKim Kardashian said \"no counseling or reconciliation effort\" could reconcile her relationship with Ye.\n\nThe day after Ye made reference to Kim during the Larry Hoover benefit concert, Kim asked a California judge to make her \"legally single\" and restore her birth name in a court document that was first obtained by Buzzfeed.\n\nBuzzfeed reported that in the documents, Kim said that there was \"no counseling or reconciliation effort\" that could amend the \"irreconcilable differences\" between her and Ye.\n\n\"[Kanye] and I both deserve the opportunity to build new lives,\" she said in the document. \"Therefore, I am asking that my request to bifurcate and terminate our marital status be granted.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKim Kardashian thanked Ye while accepting an honor at the 2021 People's Choice Awards.\n\nKim Kardashian was honored with the Fashion Icon award at the People's Choice Awards in December last year, and thanked Ye in her acceptance speech.\n\n\"I am honestly so humbled to be here,\" she said during her acceptance speech. \"I started off as a closet organizer and a stylist. So the fact that I am winning a Fashion Icon Award, it's like a pinch-me moment.\"\n\nLater in the speech, Kim joked that designers such as Burberry's Riccardo Tisci and Balmain's Olivier Rousteing were convinced to work with her after receiving calls from Ye, and thanked them for their support.\n\n\"To Kanye, even, for really introducing me to the fashion world. I fell in love with fashion and I'm so inspired by so many people but again, this is like a dream that I get to wake up and wear these amazing clothes and try new things and take a risk,\" she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKim Kardashian accused Ye of \"constant attacks\" on her in interviews and on social media.\n\nIn early February, Ye asked his Instagram followers for advice on what action he should take in response to his 8-year-old daughter North West appearing in videos on the social-media app TikTok.\n\n\"Since this is my first divorce I need to know what I should do about my daughter being put on TikTok against my will?\" Ye said in the since-deleted post, tagging Kim.\n\nKim and North's TikTok account has 5.9 million followers, and the bio says the page is \"managed by an adult.\"\n\nShortly after Ye posted his message, Kim responded on her Instagram story. She said her estranged husband's \"constant attacks\" on her in interviews and on social media were \"more hurtful than any TikTok North West might create.\"\n\n\"As the parent who is the main provider and caregiver for our children, I am doing my best to protect our daughter while also allowing her to express her creativity,\" Kim continued, adding, \"Divorce is difficult enough on our children and Kanye's obsession with trying to control and manipulate our situation so negatively and publicly is only causing further pain for all.\"\n\nLater in the post, Kim said she wanted \"nothing but a healthy and supportive co-parenting relationship\" and wished to handle all matters regarding the pair's children privately.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYe apologized for \"harassing\" Kim Kardashian with frequent social media posts about Pete Davidson.\n\nKim Kardashian has been romantically linked with Pete Davidson since late 2021. In response, Ye has dedicated several posts to mocking Davidson, including an edited superhero poster and a screenshot of a supposed text from Davidson, which Ye captioned: \"NO YOU WILL NEVER MEET MY CHILDREN.\"\n\nIn February 2021, Ye posted two screenshots of texts that he said were from Kim, in which she asked Ye to stop harassing Davidson.\n\n\"U are creating a dangerous and scary environment and someone will hurt Pete and this will all be your fault,\" the text read.\n\nIn response, Ye asked his fans not to harm the \"Saturday Night Live\" comedian, saying he would \"handle the situation myself\" and later took \"accountability\" for \"harassing\" Kim.\n\n\"I'm working on my communication,\" Ye captioned a photo of himself standing on stage surrounded by clouds of smoke. \"I can benefit from a team of creative professionals, organizers, mobilizers, and community leaders.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Thank everybody for supporting me. I know sharing screenshots was jarring and came off as harassing Kim. I take accountability.\"\n\nRead next\n\nAdvertisement"
