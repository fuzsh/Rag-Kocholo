        "text": "Have you heard that Kim Kardashian is dating Odell Beckham Jr.?\n\nThe 42-year-old reality star is in her WAG era, and was first linked to the 31-year-old wide receiver in September 2023. This is a return to form for ol’ Kimmy. Although Kardashian dated SNL comedian Pete Davidson following her seven-year marriage to rapper Kanye West, she used to have an affinity for athletes, including ex-husband Kris Humphries of NBA fame, as well as football players Reggie Bush and Miles Austin.\n\nTBQH, this might be a bit weird for Khloé Kardashian, who was briefly linked to the Ravens player in 2016. Here's a complete timeline of the Kim Kardashian and Odell Beckham Jr. dating details, starting with the most recent updates.\n\nApril 30, 2024: It's over. People reports that the pair have called it quits on their relationship. According to a source, the relationship simply “fizzled out.” Neither Kardashian nor Beckham Jr. has given a comment on the split. This isn't necessarily surprising, though, considering how quiet they've kept things until now.\n\nMarch 10, 2024: Both Kardashian and OBJ attend the Vanity Fair Oscars party, and though they don't walk the red carpet together, they get chatty inside.\n\nSome sneaky person nabs footage of the pair speaking intimately, with Kim touching Odell's face and him seeming to reach for her hips, unaware they were being recorded.

In photos shared by Page Six, the pair can be seen walking through the Wynn hotel, though Kim's face is partially obscured by a large black hat. Earlier in the evening the alleged couple attended the Fanatics Super Bowl party, where they were photographed separately.\n\nFebruary 7, 2024: Us Weekly reports that Kim Kardashian and Odell Beckham Jr. are “getting serious” and “trying to figure out the next steps” of their relationship. One source tells the publication that “Odell’s personality is much more private” than hers, adding that he's “low-key, while Kim’s more accustomed to the limelight.”\n\nHowever, others sources tell People. “Neither of them are in any big hurry to jump into something serious,” the source said, noting that they're “still hanging out, but it’s pretty casual.”\n\nFebruary 2, 2024: Kardashian and OBJ both attend Jay-Z's pre-Grammys party in West Hollywood, though they arrived separately, per TMZ.\n\nNovember 6, 2023: Kardashian rolls up to OBJ's birthday party in New York City after attending the 2023 CFDA Awards, per TMZ and People.\n\nSeptember 19, 2023: People reports that Odell Beckham Jr. and Lauren Woods have split after nearly four years together. The former couple shares one son, Zydn, born in February 2022. That same day, People and TMZ report that Kardashian and Beckham are “hanging out.”\n\nJuly 4, 2023: Kardashian and OBJ attend the same July 4 party.\n\nRead more\n\nBeyoncé, Kendall Jenner, and Kim Kardashian Partied Together in Sheer White Dresses\n\nJennifer Lopez, Ben Affleck, and Hailey Bieber were there too!\n\nSwipe to slide three and five of Michael Rubin's photo dump for Kardashian and OBJ:\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nNovember 6, 2022: Kardashian attends OBJ's 30th birthday party, per TMZ.\n\nAugust 5, 2022: Kardashian and Pete Davidson split after nine months of dating.\n\nFebruary 19, 2021: Kardashian files for divorce from Kanye West after seven years of marriage. They share four children: North, Saint, Chicago, and Psalm.\n\nMay 31, 2016: “It’s really not that deep,” Khloé tweets amid OBJ dating rumors.\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nMay 30, 2016: Khloé and OBJ are spotted getting cozy at Drake's Memorial Day party.
