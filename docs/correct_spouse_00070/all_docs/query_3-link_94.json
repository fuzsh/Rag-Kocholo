        "text": "Kim Kardashian, the renowned American media personality, businesswoman, and socialite, has been in the spotlight for her high-profile relationships and marriages. With her glamorous lifestyle and reality television show, \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians,\" Kim has amassed a huge fan following worldwide. Her personal life, especially her marital history, has always been a subject of intense media scrutiny and public interest.\n\nAs of [current year], Kim Kardashian has been married three times. Her marriages have all been highly publicized, each with its own set of dramas and controversies. Let's delve into the details of Kim's marital journeys:\n\nFirst Marriage: Damon Thomas (2000-2004)\n\nKim's first marriage was to music producer Damon Thomas when she was just 20 years old. The couple tied the knot in 2000, but their union was short-lived.\n\nReports emerged that the marriage ended due to domestic violence, with Kim filing for divorce in 2003, citing \"irreconcilable differences\" and \"physical and emotional abuse\" as reasons for the split.\n\nThe divorce was finalized in 2004, marking the end of Kim's first marital venture.\n\nSecond Marriage: Kris Humphries (2011-2011)\n\nKim's second marriage was to NBA player Kris Humphries. Their lavish wedding ceremony was held in 2011 and was widely covered by the media.\n\nHowever, the marriage lasted for just 72 days before Kim filed for divorce, citing \"irreconcilable differences.\"\n\nThe divorce proceedings were highly publicized, with both parties accusing each other of various misdeeds. The divorce was eventually settled out of court.\n\nThird Marriage: Kanye West (2014-2021)\n\nKim's third and longest marriage was to rapper and producer Kanye West. The couple began dating in 2012 and got married in a lavish ceremony in Italy in 2014.\n\nTogether, they welcomed four children: North, Saint, Chicago, and Psalm.\n\nHowever, despite appearing to have a picture-perfect family, rumors of marital troubles began to surface in 2020.\n\nIn February 2021, Kim filed for divorce from Kanye, citing \"irreconcilable differences.\" The divorce proceedings were relatively amicable, with both parties agreeing to joint custody of their children.\n\nIn addition to her three marriages, Kim has also been romantically linked to several other high-profile individuals, including NFL player Reggie Bush and model/actor Miles Austin. However, none of these relationships progressed to the altar.\n\nCurrently, Kim is reported to be dating comedian Pete Davidson, who is significantly younger than her. The couple has been spotted together multiple times, fueling speculation about their relationship status. However, as of [current year], there has been no official confirmation of a new marital union.\n\nKim Kardashian's marital history is undoubtedly colorful and complex, reflecting her high-profile status and the challenges that come with being in the public eye. Her relationships have always been a source of fascination for the media and her fans, and her personal life continues to be a hot topic of conversation."
