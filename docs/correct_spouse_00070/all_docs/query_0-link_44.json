        "text": "Remember how Kim Kardashian was married to basketballer Kris Humphries for a hot minute? Sometimes I forget in the madness that is the Kardashian timeline. Honestly, that family is either cursed or Kris Jenner is actually the devil like we’ve all been saying for years.\n\n[jwplayer WN6Q3XAn]\n\nSurprisingly, Kris hasn’t spoken about their ill-fated nuptials – that is, until now. Not that he really meant to, he was actually writing about his 13 year NBA career as a personal essay for The Player’s Tribune. But luck would have it for us die-hard gossip mongers, there was once a time when Kris was booed (!!) during a basketball game after the pair announced their impending divorce.\n\nKris wrote about that frankly horrible-sounding event, and then continued into a frank take on his 72-day marriage.\n\n“I met a girl who happened to be really famous, and I got married, and.…. Damn. Look, I should have known what I was getting into. I was definitely naive about how much my life was going to change. But the one thing that really bothers me is whenever people say that my marriage was fake. There’s definitely a lot about that world that is not entirely real, but our actual relationship was 100% real.”\n\nI will forever question if Kris and Kim were actually real, but it’s interesting how candid Kris is here about how naive he was, and how honest he is about how the Kardashian life isn’t, y’know, totally legit.\n\nHe goes on to call the break-up “brutal”.\n\nWhen it was clear that it wasn’t working… what can I say? It sucked. It’s never easy to go through the embarrassment of something like that — with your friends, with your family… But when it plays out so publicly, in front of the world, it’s a whole other level. It was brutal.”\n\nAnd explains the fallout for him.\n\n“I didn’t want to leave my home. You feel like… I don’t know … the whole world hates you, but they don’t even know why. They don’t even know you at all. They just recognise your face, and they’re on you. I didn’t want to be Kris Humphries. It’s the craziest feeling in the world, not wanting to be yourself. And I didn’t even want to say anything to defend myself, because it felt like I couldn’t win.”\n\nTBH it all sounds really sad and personally, I feel like I got caught up in the LOL of such a wildly extravagant marriage falling to bits in a matter of months, and forgot that these are still real people."
