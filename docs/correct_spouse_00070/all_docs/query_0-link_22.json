        "text": "Daniel Craig brands the Kardashians 'f***ing idiots' for making careers out of their private lives\n\nBy Sarah Bull\n\nLast updated at 8:24 PM on 29th November 2011\n\nThey have made millions from living their lives in the public eye thanks to their reality television shows.\n\nBut one person who is less than impressed by the Kardashian family's careers is Daniel Craig, who launched an astonishing foul-mouthed rant at the brood, headed by Kim Kardashian, in a new interview with GQ magazine.\n\nThe James Bond star labelled the clan 'f***ing idiots' and criticised those who 'sell' themselves and then make demands about their private lives.\n\nCraig, who managed to keep his marriage to Rachel Weisz under wraps in the summer, told the January edition of GQ magazine: 'I think there's a lot to be said for keeping your own counsel.\n\n'It's not about being afraid to be public with your emotions or about who you are and what you stand for. But if you sell it off it's gone.\n\n'You can't buy it back - you can't buy your privacy back. Ooh I want to be alone. F*** you. We've been in your living room. We were at your birth. You filmed it for us and showed us the placenta and now you want some privacy?\n\nReferring to the Kardashians, Craig said: 'Look at the Kardashians, they're worth millions. I don't think they were that badly off to begin with but now look at them.\n\n'You see that and you think 'what, you mean all I have to do isbehave like a f***ing idiot on television and then you'll pay me millions.\n\n'I'm not judging it - well, I am obviously.'\n\nCraig also spoke about his wedding to Weisz, and said that while they managed to keep it out of the spotlight, he doesn't feel victorious about the matter.\n\nHe said: 'We got away with it. We did it privately and I've got a lot of people to thank for that. But that was the point, we did it for private reasons.\n\n'Because we didn't want it f*****d up, because that would be sharing a secret. And the whole point is that it was a secret. A secret is a secret in my mind.'\n\nRefusing to go into any details about the ceremony, Craig added: 'Look, I'm in love. I'm very happy. And that is as far as I'm prepared to go. Life is long, life goes wrong and I don't want to say something now that might be thrown back later.'\n\nThe 43-year-old, who is now working on the 23rd Bond film, Skyfall, can soon be seen in the English language remake of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.\n\nBut he says despite his lengthy and successful career, he is still not happy with how things stand.\n\nHe said: 'I'm definitely not satisfied about my career. I don't know how you can be, it's the very nature of things.\n\n'I'm always trying to figure it out, and I'm kind of unsatisfied constantly. I always want to get it right and I don't know what the answer to it is.\n\n'But I do know that it's out there and I do know it's worth looking for.'\n\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2067753/Daniel-Craig-launches-foul-mouthed-rant-f--ing-idiots-Kardashians-making-career-private-lives.html\n\nKris Humphries\n\nSuing Kim for Emotional Distress\n\nIs Only Option to Score $$$\n\n12/3/2011 1:00 AM PST BY TMZ STAFF\n\nIs Kim Kardashian a Fraud?\n\nKris Humphries will not get any money by fighting Kim Kardashian's attempt to divorce him -- but if he really wants to fight, there is something he can do to try and score millions from KK.\n\nSources directly connected with both Kris and Kim tell TMZ ... there is no point in challenging the prenup -- it's iron-clad and both sides know it. Fact is, if Kris gets his way and has the marriage annulled based on fraud, that would mean there was never a marriage and as a result he would have NO CLAIM to any of Kim's earnings during their 72 days of bliss because no marriage would have existed.\n\nWe've poked around and asked some experts what Kris might be able to do to score some cash, if he really wanted to do that. The only plausible scenario is if Kris files a claim against Kim for intentional infliction of emotional distress based on fraud. If he could prove Kim used him as a disposable groom for her reality show -- he could get monetary damages.\n\nSo, you ask, what would his monetary damages be? Well how 'bout this? If Kris sucks during the lockout shortened BBall season and gets cut from the Nets -- which is a possibility -- he could blame the distractions on his disastrous marriage and try to sock Kim for the money he'd be out. Kris pulls in $3.2 mil a year.\n\nHere's the deal. We know Kris is really hurt and feels he was used by Kim. The question -- does he have the stomach to sue her in civil court. And there's this -- the likelihood of Kris winning is about as great as Harvey Levin replacing him on the Nets.\n\nhttp://www.tmz.com/2011/12/03/kris-humphries-kim-kardashian-divorce/?adid=rr_tmzsports\n\n'The right thing for a real man to do is issue a public apology':\n\nKris Jenner wants Daniel Craig to say sorry for insulting jibe\n\nLast updated at 8:59 PM on 8th December 2011\n\nKris Jenner has insinuated Daniel Craig is not 'a real man' after he failed to apologise for insulting her family.\n\nKim Kardashian's mother took offence after the Bond actor lashed out at the reality stars in a recent interview.\n\nHe claimed they behaved like 'a f***ing idiot' on television, and in return get paid handsomely for their humiliating efforts.\n\nDuring an interview with GQ magazine, the British star was quizzed about his opinion on the media circus surrounding Kim's divorce from estranged husband Kris Humphries just 72 days after their televised wedding.\n\nHe said: 'You see that and you think, \"What, you mean all I have to do is behave like a f***ing idiot on television and then you'll pay me millions?\"\n\n'I'm not judging it. Well, I am, obviously.'\n\nJenner has retaliated, requesting an apology during an interview with Heat and blasting him for 'crossing the line'.\n\nShe said: 'It's not made him look like the world's nicest guy. The right thing for a real man to do now would be to issue a public apology.\n\n'The easy thing would be to criticize his career now, but our family won't stoop to that level.'\n\nJenner, 56, was protecting her six children - from two different marriages.\n\nShe first said 'I do' to lawyer Robert Kardashian in June 1978, before they went on to have Kourtney, 32, Kim, 31, Khloé, 27, and Robert Jr, 24.\n\nAfter filing for divorce in 1990, Robert Sr tragically died in September 2003, just two months after being diagnosed with oesophageal cancer.\n\nKris then tied the knot for a second time to Bruce Jenner in April 1991, having two more daughters; Kendall,16, and 14-year-old Kylie.\n\nShe has allowed her family to grow up in the spotlight, with the teenage Jenner sisters already courting the limelight with modelling contracts.\n\nDespite the family's fair share of critics, Kim's doomed fairytale wedding to Humphries pulled in 8.4million viewers during the double bill on E!.\n\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2071654/Kris-Jenner-Daniel-Craig-say-sorry-insulting-Kardashians-jibe.html"
