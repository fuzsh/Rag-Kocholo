        "text": "Kris Humphries is now a retired basketball player who may or may not be more recognized for his relationship with Kim Kardashian than his skills on the court. Kris and Kim began dating in 2010 and got engaged in May of 2011. Their marriage lasted a total of 72 days, with Kim filing for divorce on October 31st, 2011.\n\nKris has now opened up to The Player's Tribune, writing an open letter on his career and his relationship with Kim. \"Look, I should have known what I was getting into,\" he wrote. \"I was definitely naive about how much my life was going to change. But the one thing that really bothers me is whenever people say that my marriage was fake.\"\n\nIlya S. Savenok/Getty Images\n\nKris explained that while the world he entered isn't entirely real, he and Kim's \"relationship was 100% real.\" When the relationship started to turn, he said \"it sucked\" and having to deal with that with his friends and family was embarrassing. \"But when it plays out so publicly, in front of the world, it’s a whole other level. It was brutal,\" he added.\n\n\"I remember having this moment when I was getting booed so hard in Philly, and I thought to myself, “Why exactly are they booing me, though? Is it just because I’m That Guy from TV? Do they think I was trying to be famous? Is it because they think I disrespected the game of basketball?”"
