        "text": "Kim Kardashian hasn't ruled out walking down the aisle one more time. In fact, she thinks her fourth husband could be the one that finally sticks.\n\nIn a preview from the new episode of their Hulu show this week, the reality star said, “To me, a baby, you're stuck for life. Marriages come and go, take it from me.” But she added with a laugh, “I believe in love. That’s why, hopefully, there will be just one more wedding for me. Fourth time’s the charm!” Kardashian was only declared legally single from her last marriage in March of this year after originally filing for a divorce from her third husband Kanye West in February 2021. They share four children together, 8-year-old North, 6-year-old Saint, 4-year-old Chicago, and 2-year-old Psalm.\n\nBut Kardashian is no stranger to matrimony as she was also previously married to music producer Damon Thomas from 2000 to 2004 and infamously wed NBA player Kris Humphries in a Keeping Up With the Kardashians televised special — a relationship that only lasted 72 days after they said “I do.” While the KKW Beauty founder didn't mention anyone in particular she has lined up to become husband number four, she and her boyfriend of six months, Pete Davidson, do seem to be getting pretty serious lately.\n\nLast month, the couple made their official red carpet debut at The White House Correspondents’ Dinner and posted their first official Instagram PDA on Kardashian's account following the premiere of her family's new Hulu reality show. If that's not proof enough that the pair are committed to one another, Kardashian also revealed on The Ellen Show in March that Davidson has a handful of tattoos he's gotten in her honor. “That’s what tattoo people do, right? They get tattoos of what’s going on in their life,” she said in an attempt to undercut the seriousness of those permanent additions to his body. She went on to explain that a couple of them are “cutesy things,” another one near Davidson’s collarbone reads “My girl is a lawyer” in celebration of Kardashian recently passing California’s “baby bar” exam after multiple attempts, and there’s one that’s actually a brand of her first name that’s been seared into his chest. “I think he was like I want something that’s there that I can’t get rid of,\" she said \"because he’s in the process of getting rid of his arm tats and his neck tats, so he’s like, ‘I don’t want to be able to get rid of it or to cover it up and I just wanted it there as a scar on me.’”\n\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair"
