        "text": "The Kardashian-Jenner matriarch has been in a relationship with talent manager Corey Gamble for seven years now. Unsurprisingly, speculation has been rife about whether the “momager” is set to walk down the aisle for the third time.\n\nBut who is Gamble and what is his relationship with Jenner really like? Let’s take a closer look …\n\nWho is Corey Gamble and what does he do for a living?\n\nCorey Gamble is a business executive who doesn’t just have the Kardashians on speed dial. He used to be Justin Bieber’s tour manager, working under legendary music executive Scooter Braun and no doubt having access to many of his superstar clients too. The Atlanta, Georgia native is 41 years old and was born just a month after 66-year-old Jenner’s daughter, Kim. He reportedly dated Atlanta Exes star Sheree Buchanan before Jenner. He has no children.\n\nJenner and Gamble met at fashion designer Riccardo Tisci’s 40th birthday party in Ibiza (thrown by Ye) back in 2014. They went Instagram official in 2015 after sharing a post of their double date with Tish and Billy Ray Cyrus.\n\nA rocky patch\n\nThe pair split briefly in 2017, with a source sharing with Radar Online at the time that Jenner had told Gamble she was “getting sidetracked with this relationship and that she needed to put her family before her own needs and wants”.\n\nSecret engagement?\n\nIn August 2018, Jenner hinted that she was engaged to Gamble – when she ate a cricket on The Late Late Show With James Corden to avoid answering whether she was engaged to be married. Gamble was also seen laughing at the question about Jenner’s huge diamond ring on the Spill Your Guts segment.\n\nThen news outlets speculated that Corey had popped the question before the Met Gala after Jenner was seen wearing a huge rock on her finger. In June 2019, OK! magazine in the United States reported that the pair were planning their nuptials.\n\nCold feet?\n\nJenner seemed to confirm the rumour with her comments on Laura Wasser’s Divorce Sucks podcast. While she didn’t flat out refuse ever saying “I do” again, her comments were taken by some as a hint that she instead wanted an understated ceremony.\n\n“You know, you never say never. But I often say it’s just not what I need to do again based on my past,” she told the celebrity divorce lawyer. “I don’t have the need to put on a long, white dress and walk down an aisle. I’ve done that. I’ve had the big wedding. I just don’t think that I want to go there.”\n\nA US$2 million wedding?\n\nNevertheless, rumours continued to swirl over the past two years that Jenner might have changed her tune. “Kris has always considered herself a star and plans to surround herself with them on her special day,” a source told the National Enquirer. Another insider told OK! magazine that the pair were planning a US$2 million wedding with “tons of famous names in attendance”, while The National Enquirer even reported that Ye would perform and Caitlyn Jenner was on a “do not invite” list.\n\nIn June 2021, Gossip Cop reported that the couple was looking at venues in San Diego where Jenner’s mum MJ lives, and the South Pacific. Other reports cited a source as saying: “Kris is finally ready to make things official and do it in style! Money is no object.”\n\nIn a bid to justify the claim, the source went on to say: “Kris was ready to give up on love before she met Corey. The split with Caitlyn was vicious and a lot of people doubted she ever pulls the trigger again.”\n\n“You are such a special part of my heart and soul and I love you so very much babe … thank you for all you are in my life! I am truly blessed.”"
