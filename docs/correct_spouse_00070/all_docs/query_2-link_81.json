        "text": "Kim Kardashian has admitted her marriage to Kanye West was \"beautiful\" for a long time.\n\nThe mum-of-four said she doesn't consider their relationship a \"failure\" despite finalising her divorce from the rapper six months ago.\n\nWhile not naming her ex-husband, the 42-year-old explained that she can't \"help\" people who don't \"want\" it while appearing on Jay Shetty's On Purpose podcast.\n\n\"You can’t force your beliefs and project that on someone that thinks something totally different,\" she said.\n\n“It’s OK to realize that this life is so short, and you should go and find the people that do align with what you really believe in.\"\n\n“You can’t really force things upon other people,” she added. “You can’t expect them to be where you’re at [and] at your level.”\n\nKanye, 45, has since moved on from his relationship with Kim and married Yeezy architect Bianca Censori in an intimate ceremony back in January.\n\nKim has been single since the end of her nine month relationship with Pete Davidson last August - her only relationship since she divorced Kanye.\n\nThis is the longest stretch of time the reality star has ever been single.\n\nWhile appearing on the podcast, Kim also said she will \"always want to be in love\" as she admitted she is a \"hopeless romantic\".\n\nShe insisted she isn't lonely despite being single as she said she has \"so much going on\" during an appearance\n\nAsked if she would ever be in love again, Kim said: \"I think I’ll always be a hopeless romantic and always want to be in love and definitely love sharing my life with someone and love creating a life with someone.\n\n\"I definitely will take my time and I think there's so many factors, especially when you have kids and being mindful of people who enter into your life\"\n\nKim added: \"I'll always believe in love and I'll always want that, but I think I'm so comfortable taking my time to not rush it.\n\n\"There's so much going on that I'm not lonely.\"\n\nKim's comments come after Kanye's new wife confirmed they are married following months of speculation.\n\nThe couple got hitched back in January in a private ceremony, but reports said they had failed to apply for a marriage certificate.\n\nIn a new TikTok video, the 27-year-old Yeezy architect was filmed speaking to a man in a clothing shop who seemed to have taken a shine to her as he asked for her number.\n\nBianca had a huge smile as she replied: \"I'm married!\"\n\nElsewhere in Jay Shetty's podcast, Kim opened up about how she \"cried herself to sleep\" after experiencing mum guilt.\n\nKim shares dour children with her ex-husband - North, nine, Saint, seven, Chicago, five, and Psalm, four.\n\n\"Mom guilt is probably the hardest thing,\" the Kardashians star told Jay.\n\n\"You feel like the worst mom if something's going on and you can’t fix it, you have no idea how to change it, your kids are fighting, whatever it is.\n\n\"My friends and I will text each other and be like in tears, literally locking ourselves in the room away from a kid having a tantrum, when that's not what you should do.\n\n\"You should go and lean into them, but sometimes it’s so overwhelming.\"\n\nKim later faced a backlash for the comments as fans told her to \"get a reality check\" as she employs nannies and a full house of staff."
