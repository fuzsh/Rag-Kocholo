        "text": "Before Kanye West, there was Kris Humphries and believe it or not, before Kris Humphries there was Damon Thomas. That’s right, the NBA baller wasn’t Kim Kardashian‘s first husband. In fact, her marriage to Damon Thomas is currently tied with her marriage to Kanye as her longest— each totaling four years. Of course, we’re rooting for Kimye to break the record.\n\nSo, who is this mystery man who somehow managed to snag the most famous woman in the world before she was, well, famous? According to The Sun, Damon is a music producer who has worked with countless famous artists, including Chris Brown, Lionel Richie, R. Kelly, and Pink. He and Kim eloped in 2000, when the now mother-of-three was just 19 years old. Their relationship quickly dissolved and the pair filed for divorce by 2004 — citing “irreconcilable differences.”\n\nHowever, their divorce papers leaked in 2011 and painted a very different story altogether. Kim alleged that Damon was an abusive spouse. According to the documents, per Daily Mail, “Thomas would punch her in the face, slam her against walls, and throw her across the room, leaving her bruised and battered.”\n\nFollowing those damning accusations, Damon clapped back with a vengeance. Not only did he deny ever physically harming Kim, he gave a scathing exclusive interview with In Touch Weekly, completely tearing her reputation to shreds.\n\n“She can’t write or sing or dance, so she does harmful things in order to validate herself in the media,” he told the publication. “That’s a fame-whore to me. It’s just not cool at all.”\n\nBeyond throwing insults, Damon claimed that he was the one who filed for divorce from Kim, and he did it because Kim was cheating on him with “multiple guys.” Though, Kim denied those claims at the time and hasn’t spoken of them in the years since.\n\nFurthermore, he claimed that Kim lured him back into the relationship for a brief time after he called it quits, and she even convinced him to finance her extravagant shopping sprees and extensive plastic surgery — including a boob job and liposuction.\n\n“She wanted to have that lifestyle,” he explained. “She wanted to be what she ultimately became.” And Damon was willing to finance it — until he saw her on the cover of a magazine on a date with Jennifer Lopez‘s ex, Cris Judd. “I saw my wife with another man, wearing the clothes that we had just bought after her lipo,” he said. “It was not something as a husband you ever wanted to see.”\n\nAs of today, Damon Thomas seemingly flies under the radar. Unlike his ex, he amasses no social media following of any kind, and his last known produced single is “One Night Only” by The Underdogs in 2015. At the end of the day, he may have been Kimmy K’s first husband, but he certainly wasn’t her best."
