        "text": "THE lavish marriage of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West officially came to an end in November 2022.\n\nDuring their eight years together, the pair welcomed four children together.\n\nWhen did Kim Kardashian and Kanye West get married?\n\nReality star and businesswoman, Kim Kardashian, 42, started dating rapper, Kanye West, 45, back in April 2012 - six months after she split from Kris Humphries, an NBA star she married in August 2011.\n\nThe pair filed for divorce just 72 days later, and by the time Kim had moved on, she was still technically still married to Humphries since her divorce wasn't finalized until June 2013.\n\nThe finalization of Kim and Kris' separation came around the same time as the birth of North West- Kim and Kanye's first child.\n\nWhen North was only eleven months old, Kim and Kanye tied the knot in a lavish ceremony on May 24, 2014 - marking the fashion mogul's third marriage.\n\nKim had previously been wedded to Damon Thomas at just 19 years old in 2000, but the two divorced four years later after she accused him of emotional and physical abuse.\n\nBefore Kim, Kanye had never been married, he had only once been engaged to Alexis Phifer, but the pair ended it after 18 months in 2008.\n\nWhere was their wedding and who was invited?\n\nFollowing a party in Paris, Kim and Kanye's wedding took place at Fort di Belvedere in Florence, Italy - the city where North had been conceived - with an Italian tenor serenading them as they tied the knot.\n\nKim was wearing a Givenchy dress designed by Riccardo Tisci - though she changed dresses four times during the day - while Michael Costello designed many of the guests' outfits.\n\nThere were still plenty of world-famous celebrities in attendance, including John Legend and wife, Chrissy Teigen, Jaden Smith - son of Will Smith - tennis superstar Serena Williams and NBA ace, Carmelo Anthony.\n\nWhy did Kim and Kanye divorce?\n\nKim officially filed for divorce from Kanye on February 19, 2021, citing \"irreconcilable differences.\"\n\nAt that point, the pair had been married for seven years and welcomed four children together: North, Chicago, Saint and Psalm.\n\nTheir separation was finalized in November 2022 with a settlement that included Kanye paying his ex-wife $200,000 a month in child support."
