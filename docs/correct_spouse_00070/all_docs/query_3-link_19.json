        "text": "Kim Kardashian and Kanye West’s relationship dates all the way back to the early aughts, long before they started dating, got married, and had four children—North, Saint, Chicago, and Psalm—together.\n\nBut their relationship has been changing in the face of the unraveling of their marriage. Let’s go back to the beginning and trace how we got here with Kim Kardashian and Kanye West.\n\n2002–2003\n\nKardashian and West first meet around this time, when she had yet to become a household name. “I met him I think in 2002 or 2003,” Kardashian told Ryan Seacrest during the Keeping Up With the Kardashians 10th anniversary special, per Us Weekly. “He was recording a song with Brandy, and I was her friend. I vividly remember hanging out with him and then they did a video together, so I’d see him a few times. He was asking his friends: ‘Who is this Kim Kardajan?’ He didn’t know what my name was.”\n\n2008\n\nKardashian and West appear together in a Star Wars–themed video in which she dressed as Princess Leia and he was a Storm Trooper. She shared some photos on her now defunct personal website, writing in 2015, “In honor of Star Wars: The Force Awakens being released today, I wanted to share these old pics of Kanye and me from years ago! We worked together on a pilot for a show called Alligator Boots back in 2008, and I played Princess Leia.”\n\n2011\n\nKardashian actually marries Kris Humphries on August 11 of this year, but they split a mere 72 days later. (They didn’t legally reach a divorce settlement until 2013.) But all roads led back to West.\n\n“Right before I got married to Kris Humphries, [Kanye and I] were talking and I just went a different direction,” she said during the KUWTK anniversary special. “I think I had to go through that to figure out what I wanted. After my breakup, I was feeling really low and down, and he said, ‘Just come to Paris and see my fashion show.’ He jokes that he put on this whole fashion show just to get a date with me. So I went there and I stayed with him, and that’s where we started dating. I swear from the moment I landed, I fell madly in love with him and I thought, Oh, my God, why didn’t I do this sooner? Like, this is what real life is like—love and fun and real support.”\n\n2013\n\nTheir first child, daughter North West, is born on June 15, 2013.\n\nWest proposes to Kardashian in October. The location? A huge, vacant baseball stadium. The method? A Jumbotron message that read, “Pleeease marry meee!!!” Also, a live orchestra, because of course!\n\nThen, in the second part of the finale, which aired on June 10, she opens up to her mom. “I just feel like I’ve worked so hard in life to achieve everything that I’ve wanted to, and I’ve lived up to my expectations and achieved 10 times more than I ever thought was humanly possible, but I don’t have a life to share that with,” she tells Kris Jenner, per Us Weekly. “Like, I do—obviously my kids and everything—but am I just going to sit here and think, ‘OK, my kids fulfill me and I’m good?’”\n\nUltimately, she wanted something more intimate with her partner than a series of grand gestures. “After turning 40 this year, I realized like, ‘No, I don’t want a husband that lives in a completely different state,’” she continued. “To me, I thought, ‘Oh, my God, that’s when we’re getting along the best,’ but then that is sad to me and that’s not what I want. I want someone that we have the same shows in common. I want someone who wants to work out with me.”\n\nIn fact, it was her sister’s relationship that opened her eyes during the pandemic. “Like, every single day Khloé and Tristan and I would work out at 6 a.m., the three of us, and I was third-wheeling it for a good eight months in quarantine and I was so envious of that,” Kardashian said. “I was like, ‘Wow, it’s, like, the little things I don’t have.’ I have all the big things. I have the extravagant everything you can possibly imagine and no one will ever do it like that—I know that and I’m grateful for those experiences—but I think I’m ready for the smaller experiences that I think will mean a lot.”\n\nOn Kanye’s 44th birthday, June 8, Kardashian posted a picture to Instagram of herself, West, and three of their children on a private plane. In the caption, she wrote, “Happy Birthday Love U for Life! 🎈” That same day West was spotted with Irina Shayk. (Here’s everything we know about that.)\n\nAugust 2021: On August 26, Kardashian appears at West’s third Donda listening event. While she had attended the first two with their children, this time sparked serious reconciliation rumors when she appeared to recreate her 2014 wedding with West in a full wedding gown and veil.\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThe questions surrounding their current relationship status are strengthened by reports that Kardashian is not planning to remove “West” from her legal name. However, sources tell People that the couple is not getting back together.\n\n“The thing that’s important is it’s not at all about them getting back together or something like that,” a source told the publication. “It’s really just kind of this more holistic sense of love as a healing force.”\n\nPreviously, another source told People that the two are in a solid place as business partners and friends. “Kim and Kanye have a friendly relationship. It’s always been important to Kim to have a good relationship with Kanye. They are not getting back together, though,” the source said. “Kim still appreciates Kanye’s business advice and guidance. She is happy that they can hang out.”\n\nOctober 2021: On October 6, Kardashian jokes about their split while hosting SNL. “I’ve been very blessed in this life, and I’m grateful for everything, honestly, all the ups, all the downs,” Kardashian began. “I mean, I married the best rapper of all time. Not only that, he’s the richest Black man in America, a talented, legit genius, who gave me four incredible kids.”\n\nShe continued, “So when I divorced him, you have to know it came down to just one thing: his personality.”\n\nNovember 2021: Following that stint on SNL, Kardashian is spotted on multiple outings with comedian Pete Davidson. Despite those relationship rumors, West revealed on November 4 that he wants his “wife” back. “SNL making my wife say ‘I divorced him’ on TV because they just wanted to get that bar off,” West said on the Drink Champs podcast, per People. “And I ain’t never even seen the papers, we’re not even divorced.”\n\nHe later added, “That ain’t no joke to me. My kids want their parents to stay together. I want…us to be together.”\n\nOn November 6, Cosmo reported that Kanye West has unfollowed Kardashian on Instagram. According to Page Six, this is the second time he's done so this month.\n\nAs Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson confirm their relationship in late November, West continues to speak publicly about his wish to reconcile. “The narrative God wants is to see that we can be redeemed in all these relationships,” West said during the charity event on November 24, per People. “We’ve made mistakes. I’ve made mistakes. I’ve publicly done things that were not acceptable as a husband, but right now today, for whatever reason—I didn’t know I was going to be in front of this mic—but I’m here to change the narrative.”\n\nWhile denouncing the narrative pushed by Keeping Up With the Kardashians networks Hulu and E!, West added, “If the enemy can separate Kimye, there’s going to be millions of families that feel like that separation is okay…but when God brings Kimye together, there’s going to be millions of families that are going to be influenced to see that they can overcome the work of the separation, of trauma the devil has used to capitalize to keep people in misery while people step over homeless people to go to the Gucci store.”\n\nAccording to People, West also shared that he’s moved into a house near his family, he feels he “needs to be back home.”\n\nDecember 2021: Kardashian gives West a shout-out at the 2021 People’s Choice Awards while accepting the Fashion Icon Award. “To Kanye, for really introducing me to the fashion world,” she said, per Bustle. “I fell in love with fashion and I’m so inspired by so many people, but again, this is like a dream that I get to wake up and wear these amazing clothes and try new things and take a risk. I’m so humbled.”\n\nOn December 9, West calls for reconciliation once again. While performing the song “Runaway” at the Free Larry Hoover concert in Los Angeles, West sings the lyrics “I need you to run right back to me, baby,” before adding, “more specifically, Kimberly.” According to People, Kardashian is in the audience with eight-year-old North and six-year-old Saint.\n\nHowever, on December 10, according to court documents obtained by TMZ, Kardashian reportedly files to be declared legally single and to have her maiden name restored, officially dropping “West” from her legal name. If signed off by the judge, their marital status will be separated from issues of custody and divisions of assets and property.\n\nOn December 27, it's reported that Kanye West recently purchased a house directly across the street from the KKW Beauty founder. According to the Daily Mail, West pays $4.5 million for a “relatively modest” estate in Hidden Hills, which is near the mansion he and Kardashian owned before she bought out his half for $23 million in October.\n\nWest even reportedly pays $421,000 over the asking price for the home, which Dirt describes as “architecturally unremarkable,” with four bedrooms, two and a half bathrooms, and a guest studio that has another room and bath attached to the garage.\n\n2022\n\nJanuary 2022: A lot can change in a month. By January 2022, Kanye West is dating actor Julia Fox—a relationship Kardashian reportedly supports. However, despite West’s describing his relationship with his ex as “the best divorce ever,” things are starting to get a bit messy.\n\nFor one, West says that in a song that took shots at his ex as well as Davidson. “God saved me from that crash just so I can beat Pete Davidson's ass,” West raps in “Eazy,” according to People. He also throws shade at Kardashian's parenting skills: “I got love for the nannies, but real family is better. The cameras watch the kids, y'all stop takin' the credit,” he raps. “Non-custodial dad, I bought the house next door. What you think the point of really bein' rich for.”\n\nHe adds, “Boujee and unruly, y'all need to do some chores. Rich ass kids, this ain't yo mama's house.”\n\nAround the same time as the song drops on January 14, West is also complaining in interviews that he is not allowed to enter his ex's home to see his children. However, sources tell People that these claims are “false” and Kardashian is simply setting “healthy boundaries” after a number of “recent unannounced visits” led to issues with her family, friends, and staff.\n\n“He just can no longer walk inside her home without her permission,” the source says, adding that Kardashian “has a right to privacy and is trying to set healthy boundaries.”\n\nOn January 15, however, West is spotted at his daughter Chicago's fourth-birthday party after sharing a live video claiming he wasn't given the address. “Ya’ll, I’m just wishing my daughter a public happy birthday,” West says, per BET. “I wasn’t allowed to know where her party was.”\n\nAfter attending, West posts another video, thanking Travis Scott for sharing the address and letting him in.\n\nFebruary 2022: On February 13, the day of the Super Bowl, West posts on Instagram about his displeasure with his ex's relationship with Davidson.\n\nThen on Valentine's Day, February 14, his split from Fox becomes official, and he sends a truckload of roses to Kim.\n\nOn February 15, after deleting his previous Instagram posts, West writes, “I’ve learned that using all caps makes people feel like I’m screaming at them. I’m working on my communication. I can benefit from a team of creative professionals, organizers, mobilizers and community leaders. Thank everybody for supporting me. I know sharing screen shots was jarring and came off as harassing Kim. I take accountability. I’m still learning in real time. I don’t have all the answers. To be good leader is to be a good listener.”\n\nAfter nearly a week of posting and deleting Instagrams about Kardashian and Davidson, Kanye is attempting to block his ex from obtaining a legal divorce and restoring her maiden name. According to court documents obtained by People on February 19, the rapper filed a response to Kardashian's December petition to be declared “legally single.”\n\nIn the response, West's lawyers suggest that declaring Kardashian single status before the terms of their divorce (i.e., custody, division of assets, etc.) are finalized could have “a risk of adverse consequences” and “creates barriers to obtaining evidence” should one of the parties “remarries before the case is concluded.”\n\nWest's lawyers also lay out a series of “conditions” for Kardashian if she wants West to reconsider, which you can read more about here.\n\nOn February 23, Kardashian's legal team asks the court to reject West's attempts to delay the divorce, according to legal documents obtained by People. They once again ask for Kardashian to be declared legally single, citing West's social media posts as a cause for concern.\n\n“Since filing for divorce, Mr. West, by his actions, has made it clear that he does not accept that the parties' marital relationship is over,” the documents state. “Mr. West has disseminated on social media the parties' private communications and misinformation about personal family matters and coparenting, which has caused emotional distress.”\n\nIncluded in the filing is a declaration from Kardashian herself. “I very much desire to be divorced,” she writes, in part. “I have asked Kanye to keep our divorce private, but he has not done so. Kanye has been putting a lot of misinformation regarding our private family matters and coparenting on social media. While I wish our marriage would have succeeded, I have come to the realization that there is no way to repair our marriage.”"
