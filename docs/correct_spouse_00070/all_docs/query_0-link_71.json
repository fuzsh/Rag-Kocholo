One chapter will be officially over, and a new one can begin. The same should hold true for (Humphries)... I am currently pregnant by a man with whom I began a relationship well after I separated from (Humphries)... I do not want to be married to (Humphries) when I have my baby. I am requesting the status of my marriage be determined for now for not only my health and welfare but also for the health and well-being of my unborn child... I should not be constrained in my financial and social endeavors by the fact that (Humphries) and I have a marriage which now exists in name only. I do not want the status of my marriage to affect any investment I wish to make,",

One chapter will be officially over, and a new one can begin. The same should hold true for (Humphries)...

I do not want the status of my marriage to affect any investment I wish to make, such as the purchase of a new residence.\"\n\nKim is suggesting either a speedy trial date for the divorce or to at least have the marriage legally dissolved while other issues—money, I'm guessing?—are battled in court at a later date. I think that's fair.\n\nBut of course, Kris doesn't want to make it easy. He countered that Kim's \"apparently unplanned pregnancy\" by another man is not a reason to expedite this.\n\nUgh, Kris. This is not something I find myself saying often, but I'm going to completely, 100 percent side with Kim on this. I feel like he's being difficult just to be difficult. Dude, get over it! Give the woman her divorce. I really do believe that Kim is genuinely happy and in love with Kanye—she just wants to start her new family without this thing hanging over her head—and Kris is acting like a bratty teenager."
