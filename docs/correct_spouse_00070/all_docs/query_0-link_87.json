        "text": "Things have been rocky from the start between Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries. But on Sunday’s episodes of Kourtney & Kim Take New York, Kim finally admits that things aren’t working with her new husband.\n\nPHOTOS: 2011’s Biggest Rule Breakers Kim Kardashian, Netflix’s Reed Hastings, Chuck Lorre and Ashton Kutcher\n\n“There’s something in my relationship that I just feel isn’t right,” Kim tells her mother, Kris Jenner, during a trip to Dubai. “I don’t know, I’m just learning certain things about him that I didn’t know before. I don’t know, married life isn’t what I thought it would be with him.”\n\nTo understand why Kim came to that conclusion, we have to rewind back several days to when Kris told her he had been offered a lot of money to make an appearance at a Toronto nightclub. Considering that he threw a raging party in their hotel suite the last time she left him alone, Kim felt uncomfortable with him doing a gig surrounded by drunk people and let’s just say it, women. It seemed as if he understood and agreed not to make the appearance.\n\nPHOTOS: 19 of Hollywood’s All-Time Shortest Marriages\n\nSo, Kim and her sister, Kourtney Kardashian, left Kris and Scott Disick alone in Manhattan while they had some quality time away from New York’s aggressive paparazzi in Connecticut. It didn’t seem like very much time had passed after they left when Kris decided he would do the Toronto appearance anyway and then pull the “whipped” card on Scott, so he’d accompany him. But, of course, the girls didn’t have to know. But, the girls did find out – on Twitter once again – and Kim wasn’t pleased.\n\nLuckily for her, Kim had an excuse to leave New York soon after for an appearance with her mother Kris in Dubai. Time check: this occurred in mid-October just short of two months after their wedding. That only gave her more time to stew in her anger over Kris lying to her. She said she finally could have some “alone time” away from her husband. Though, how much “alone time” does this woman need? It seems they’ve been apart more than together since their marriage. While in Dubai, she said she finally felt like herself again and that can’t be a good thing for her marriage.\n\nPHOTOS: Inside Kardashian Inc.\n\nSo, we’re back to the point where Kim admits something isn’t right with her relationship as she’s riding to the airport with her mom. Then, she asks if it’s normal to not to be excited about seeing her husband.\n\n“No, Kim, it’s not normal,” her mom answers. “It really isn’t normal to feel like you don’t want to go home to your brand new husband. This is the stage in your relationship where you should be obsessed with each other and you miss each other.”\n\nAnd so the unraveling of Kim and Kris’ marriage is sure to continue on next week’s episode. What did you think of this week’s developments? Tell us in the comments section below.\n\nWatch Kim’s confession below."
