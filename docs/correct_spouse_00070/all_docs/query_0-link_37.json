        "text": "BEFORE Kim Kardashian dated Pete Davidson and Kanye West, she had a whirlwind romance with Kris Humphries.\n\nKris was catapulted to fame for 72 days in 2011, all thanks to his shocking and sudden marriage to Kim.\n\nThey were together for less than a year before he proposed and on August 20, 2011, the pair officially tied the knot in a two-part made-for-tv special showing the preparations and the wedding itself.\n\nBut despite being touted as \"Kim's fairytale wedding\" things did not last.\n\nOn October 31, 2011, it was announced that Kim had filed for divorce.\n\nAfter a lengthy legal battle, the couple reached a settlement, which was finalized on June 3, 2013.\n\nSince then, the former NBA player has sinked back to near anonymity, last know to be living a quiet life in his hometown of Minneapolis Minnesota, where he is involved in several business ventures.\n\nFINAL SHOT\n\nKris played college basketball for the Minnesota Golden Gophers of the University of Minnesota.\n\nHe then enjoyed a 13-year career in the NBA as a journeyman, playing for teams like the Utah Jazz, Toronto Raptors, Dallas Mavericks and Brooklyn Nets.\n\nOn September 25, 2017, Kris signed with the Philadelphia 76ers, but less than a month later, he was released.\n\nIt would be his last team. Kris announced his retirement on March 26, 2019.\n\nBUSINESS BITES\n\nAfter his retirement, Kris entered the business world.\n\nIn 2018 the former baller became a franchise partner for Crisp & Green and opened up several Five Guys restaurants throughout Minnesota and Wisconsin.\n\nMost recently, Kris and his family finalized a deal in April to open 10 new locations of Los Angeles-based Dave's Hot Chicken throughout the Twin Cities and surrounding areas.\n\n\"My family and I were really excited at the prospect of bringing an exciting brand like Dave's Hot Chicken to our home in the Twin Cities area,\" Kris said in a company press release.\n\n\"After doing our due diligence, trying the product and meeting the brand's leadership, we knew this was an opportunity we couldn't pass up.\n\n\"We're excited to see what the future holds for the brand in the Twin Cities.\"\n\nDATING LIFE\n\nAfter his marriage to Kim ended, Kris got cozy with Playboy model Neyleen Ashley.\n\nAlthough their relationship wouldn't last, the memories always will - especially on Neyleen's upper thigh, where she has a tattoo of the number 43, which was Kris's jersey number throughout his NBA career.\n\nAs for his famous ex, Kim opened up about the quickie marriage in 2021, admitting she felt pressured into going through with it for television purposes.\n\nDuring a reunion episode of the family's old Bravo show, Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Kim confessed she felt like if she suddenly said no to the affair, \"I was going to let everyone down.\"\n\n“We’re filming this for a TV show,\" she reflected. \"If I leave, I’m gonna be known as the runaway bride forever, and it’s gonna be a huge joke and I think I just have I had cold feet.\"\n\nKim then admitted she could have handled that whole period of her life better\n\n\"I was so nervous to break up with someone, I handled it totally the wrong way,\" she shared.\n\n\"I fully broke up with him in the worst way, and I couldn't, I just didn't know how to deal, I learned so much from it.\"\n\n\"Do you think you owe him an apology?\" Andy asked, to which Kim replied, \"Absolutely, and I tried to, I tried calling him for months.\""
