        "text": "A stinging comeback. Kim Kardashian shaded ex-husband Kris Humphries during an episode of Hulu’s The Kardashians. She mentioned her 72 day marriage in a conversation with Kourtney’s ex-boyfriend Scott Disick when preparing for a wedding speech.\n\nKim asked Scott for his opinions on a wedding speech joke for friend Simon Huck’s wedding. “I feel like after SNL the pressure is mounting,” she said laughing. “So I think I’ll say something along the lines of, ‘I love a gay wedding. I haven’t been to one since my second wedding!’” Scott clapped his hands in approval and mimicked the sounds of a buzzer. Kim also revealed her insecurities of going to the wedding without her styling team, to which Scott responded with “Look at what you’ve done with Skims. You know what you’re doing. You knew how to dress like you always have.”\n\nMore from StyleCaster\n\nScott Just Revealed if Kourtney's Kids Were at Her Wedding to Travis Amid Fears They're 'Losing Their Dad'\n\nWe Finally Know if Kim Wants 'Another Child' With Pete--Here's if She Would 'Carry' His Baby\n\nKanye's GF Just Tattooed His Name After Pete Inked Kim's Kids' Initials on His Neck\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nKim married Kris Humphries on August, 20, 2011.

The couple called it quits on October 31, 2011 after 72 days of marriage. “After careful consideration, I have decided to end my marriage,” Kim said in a statement at the time. “I hope everyone understands this was not an easy decision.

We remain friends and wish each other the best.”\n\nClick here to read the full article.\n\nKim later married Kanye West on May 24, 2014.
