        "text": "North West is officially 11 years old!\n\nKim Kardashian celebrated her eldest child's birthday on Instagram June 15, sharing adorable pics and videos of her and her daughter.\n\n\"Thank God for you ✨ Happy 11th birthday my sweet girl North. I love you so so so much,\" she wrote in the caption.\n\nTravis Barker, who is married to North's aunt, Kourtney Kardashian Barker, sent his well-wishes in the comments section.\n\n\"Happy Birthday North,\" the rocker wrote, adding a party emoji.\n\nGrandma Kris Jenner also celebrated North's birthday on Instagram, writing, in part, \"Watching you grow into the amazing, talented, creative young girl you are has been one of the greatest joys of my life. Your confidence is inspiring and it always amazes me how much energy, excitement and love you put into everything you do!!\"\n\nKim Kardashian has previously opened up about wanting her kids to have a “normal life” as much as possible, despite their parents’ fame.\n\n“I’ll do anything to keep their life as normal as possible,” Kim Kardashian told Angie Martinez on her “IRL” podcast in December 2022.\n\nThe conversation came shortly after she and Ye divorced after eight years of marriage. They settled their divorce in November 2022, agreeing to “equal access” to their four children, according to documents obtained by TODAY.com.\n\nKim Kardashian and Ye share four children: North, Saint, Chicago and Psalm West.\n\nKim Kardashian told interviewer Martinez about the difficulties of co-parenting amid media headlines and Ye's erratic behavior, including antisemitic social media posts in October 2022.\n\n“I definitely protected him, and I still will in the eyes of my kids. For my kids. So, in my home, my kids don’t know anything that goes on (in) the outside world,” Kim Kardashian told Martinez.\n\n“One day my kids will thank me ... for not bashing their dad,” she said.\n\nRead on to learn more about Kim Kardashian's four kids.\n\nNorth West\n\nKim Kardashian and Ye welcomed their first child, North, on June 15, 2013.\n\nShe revealed how she came up with her daughter's name in a 2020 makeup tutorial she did with Kylie Jenner.\n\n“I actually got it from Jay Leno, who made that as a joke,” she said at the time. “I was like, ‘No way, I would never name my daughter that.’ Like, I said that on his show. Everyone was coming up to me like, ‘It’s such a cool name. You should really think about it.'\"\n\nKim Kardashian said it took \"four or five days\" for the name to stick.\n\nNorth has an eye for fashion just like her mom. In a March 2022 interview with Vogue, she said that her daughter is \"very opinionated when it comes to what I’m wearing.\"\n\n“She’ll always complain when I’m wearing too much black,\" the SKIMS founder said.\n\n“I showed up at her school on Valentine’s Day wearing head-to-toe pink, and she got so excited she ran over and hugged me,” Kim Kardashian added. “(Of course) she opened my coat, saw the black lining, and says ‘Mom, you’re still wearing black.’”\n\nNorth also wasn’t afraid to critique her mom’s 2023 Met Gala look — a quality that led Kim Kardashian to call her “the new Joan Rivers“ in an episode of “The Kardashians.”\n\nShe didn't hold back when it came to her thoughts on her mom's makeup line, either.\n\nOn Jan. 27, the then 10-year-old commented on different SKKN by Kim products, like lipsticks, lip liners and palettes, in a five-minute video uploaded to the joint TikTok account she shares with her mom.\n\nNorth began her review by testing out different eyeshadows from a palette on her arm. She posed and said one of the colors was “really neutral.” She playfully added in a mocking voice, “I like it, like to go out, like dinner, yes, with the makeup on! This is classic Kim, so.”\n\nShe then smeared black eyeshadow all over her eyes to create an “emo” look and jumped around. The preteen continued to test out the makeup and provide funny commentary throughout the energetic video.\n\n“I’m slaying!” she said at one point.\n\nKim Kardashian captioned the clip, “What my daughter does on my phone ha ha ha ha ha ha” with a crying-laughing emoji.\n\nThe video gained over 3 million likes in one day.\n\nShe also enjoys poking fun at her mom and dad on social media. Earlier this month, she debuted a shiny new grill on the same day Ye showed off his new “titanium dentures.”\n\nThe former couple’s oldest child posted a series of photos to her and her mom’s shared TikTok account on Jan. 17. In the slideshow, North showed off a new grill that covered her teeth in metal and jewels.\n\nEarlier this year, North was featured on her dad’s new album, “Vultures,” which was released Feb. 10. The album includes the track “Talking / Once Again,” which showcases North alongside Ty Dolla $ign and James Blake.\n\nWest released the music video for the tune on Feb. 7, which stars both North and Ty Dolla $ign's daughter, Jailynn Griffin.\n\nAt the beginning of the video, North mouths along to the opening lyrics of the song while she is getting her hair done before she starts to rap her own verse.\n\n“I love it here/ We gonna take over the year for another year,” North raps. “It’s your bestie Miss, Miss Westie/ Don’t tryna test me/ It’s gonna get messy/ It’s gonna get messy/ Just, just bless me.”\n\nIn December 2023, Variety reported that North’s verse on the song was revealed during a listening session hosted in Miami. Later that month, North danced to the song in a video posted to the TikTok account she shares with her mom, adding in the caption, “Miss miss westie in the houseeeee.”\n\nNorth’s feature on part one of her dad’s new album came months after she made a cameo in “Paw Patrol: The Mighty Movie,” which premiered in September 2023.\n\nKim Kardashian reprised her role of Delores, while North voiced the character Mini and Saint, voiced the character Meteor Max.\n\nNorth West made her Hollywood Bowl singing debut on May 24, 2024, to belt out “I Just Can’t Wait To Be King” in a live production of the “Lion King” to celebrate the animated film’s 30th anniversary.\n\nBased on fan footage, North appeared to be dressed in head-to-toe yellow garb, featuring a fuzzy hood, sleeves and slippers as performers dressed as animals danced around her.\n\nVideos posted to X show that Kim Kardashian and Ye were in attendance, as well as their children Saint, Chicago and Psalm. Kris Jenner and Kourtney Kardashian were also seen giving North a standing ovation.\n\nSaint West\n\nKim Kardashian and Ye's first son was born on Dec. 5, 2015. With that, North had to adjust to being an older sister — and it wasn't always easy, she said.\n\nDuring a 2018 appearance on Ashley Graham's podcast \"Pretty Big Deal,\" Kim Kardashian said that North acted like she was an only child.\n\n“North acts like an only child at all times. I think she’s a little confused,” she said. “She’s beyond jealousy now. She’s just like, ‘It’s my world.’ She said to me the other day, ‘Mom … we just need to have another baby brother so that Saint can just leave me alone … so the girls can be on this side of the house and the boys can be on that side of the house.’ ”\n\nIn 2019, the beauty mogul told Elle about a time they worked together — to wreak havoc. The kids pulled an April Fool’s prank on their dad by trying to convince him that their mom had died.\n\n\"Kanye ran upstairs and he was like, 'Kids, this is not funny. This is not a good prank,'\" Kim Kardashian said.\n\nThough she said she understood where West was coming from, she noted that she was also \"impressed\" by her children for planning something together.\n\n\"They were getting along and having fun as a team,\" she said.\n\nSaint has taken an interest in sports. The little guy has attended a Lakers game with his parents and was even coached by Tom Brady on how to play football, according to E! News.\n\nFor his seventh birthday, Kim Kardashian took Saint and his friends to see the Los Angeles Rams play against the Seattle Seahawks, and judging by the pictures, it looks like he had a blast.\n\nThe photos showed Saint meeting the Rams' mascot while wearing defensive back Jalen Ramsey's jersey. Kim Kardashian also shared pictures of Saint holding the Rams' Vince Lombardi Trophy and a ring from their 2022 Super Bowl victory.\n\nShe captioned the post, in part, \"I love seeing you grow into the kindest soul ever. Mommy loves you forever and ever!\"\n\nOn April 12, Kim Kardashian celebrated Saint’s prowess on the basketball court, sharing videos on her Instagram story.\n\nShe posted a series of impressive basketball plays from son Saint, including one clip that showed an especially exciting moment when a player passed the basketball to her son, who scored the final shot to win the game.\n\n“MY BABY GOT THE GAME WINNING SHOT AT THE BUZZER!!!!” Kim Kardashian captioned the video.\n\nAfter making the basket, the crowd went wild and Saint ran by his mom yelling in celebration.\n\nIn a follow-up picture on her Instagram Story, Kim Kardashian shared Saint’s red basketball shoes, which feature the writing “Mini Kobe,” in reference to late NBA legend Kobe Bryant.\n\nChicago West\n\nIn 2018, Kim Kardashian and Ye welcomed their daughter Chicago with the help of a surrogate.\n\nWhen Saint met his little sister, Kim Kardashian said he couldn't get enough of her.\n\n“He loves his little sister; he’s so sweet with her,” Kim Kardashian said on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show” in April 2018. “I always have to watch out for him, he smothers her and he has this really big hair so he just jumps in her crib ... usually his big hair is like all over her face.”\n\nDuring her appearance on the show, Kim Kardashian also revealed why she named her daughter Chicago, and she said that she wanted to pay homage to West's hometown.\n\n“That is a place that made him, and a place that he remembers his family from,” she said.\n\nNot to mention that the name also felt \"cool and different\" and she loved that for her daughter.\n\nKim Kardashian has been sharing Chicago's evolving personality. In a 2018 tweet, she said Chicago is \"very calm except for when she wants food lol She LOVES food! She has the best personality, so easy and chill.\"\n\nShe told DeGeneres that her younger daughter loves the color pink, which is very different from North, who she said is more \"goth.\"\n\n“She is my girliest girl that loves pink and purple and makeup,” she said. “All my kids are so different. North is like goth — she’s into Hot Topic. She puts fake tattoos on her face, and she listens to Black Sabbath, and she’s just like a full goth girl.”\n\nPsalm West\n\nIn 2019, Kim Kardashian and Ye welcomed their son Psalm with the help of a surrogate.\n\nShortly after his birth, Kris Jenner revealed why the couple former decided to name her son Psalm.\n\n“The inspiration was the Book of Psalms in the Bible,” Jenner told Entertainment Tonight. “I think it’s just a wonderful way to celebrate how they feel. And he’s such a blessing, so it’s perfect.”\n\nWhat has Kim Kardashian shared about motherhood?\n\nKim Kardashian has been getting real about the struggles of being a working mom on Season Five of “The Kardashians.\"\n\nIn Episode Three, she said, “I’m just one person, and it’s overwhelming. Just, how do I go about doing this all?”\n\nShe compared herself to her sister, Khloé Kardashian, a parent of two. “Neither one of my parents were strict. Khloé is a lot better at being stricter. I wish I was more like that,” she said.\n\nOn the phone with a friend, she said she was reaching a breaking point. “I just can’t do it anymore. I just need to get away,” she said. “Anything in the home is just a little chaotic right now.”\n\nShe said she had to hide in the bathroom during an interview because her children were being loud.\n\n“I had a Zoom interview at the house with all my kids there, banging on the door, just screaming. And I was literally hiding in a bathroom with the door locked because I was just like, I can’t believe this. I mean, I can believe it, but that’s, like, my biggest nightmare,” she adds. “I’m open to anything at this point because I can’t live like this.”\n\nIn Episode Four, she shared that her kids find her \"cringe,\" and they backed her assessment up.\n\nShe also revealed that her kids interfered with her dream plans for her 43rd birthday. She said she spent her October birthday with her children doing activities that weren’t exactly relaxing for her.\n\n“I thought on my birthday, I would have a day to myself,” she told her mom Kris Jenner. “I was stuck doing everything that everyone else wanted to do. I was stuck watching YouTube unboxing videos on my birthday. I had a FIFA tournament, Color Me Mine. You should see the ugly thing I made, like, this is not what I wanted to be doing on my birthday.\n\n“I need to sit my kids down and be like, this isn’t Mother’s Day. This is my day. Do you think a mom wants to go to Color Me Mine one more time on her birthday? Whose birthday is it? No, I was tortured. Just make me breakfast. That’s a great birthday.”\n\nKim Kardashian added that having four young children feels like “a madhouse.\"\n\n“What would your perfect birthday have been?” a producer asked her on the show.\n\nKim Kardashian replied, “To lock my door, not get out of my bed and eat cookies and cream ice cream all day long. That’s what would have been my dream, but no. No one cares about my dreams, not four kids, at least.”"
