        "text": "By Tess Farrand, Associate Content Editor\n\nKim Kardashian West’s life has changed significantly since her husband of five years, Kanye West, became a born-again Christian.\n\nThe reality star/makeup mogul shared how their dynamic is different on THE REAL.\n\n“He is my husband, so I obviously want to honor him and what he’s feeling as he’s been going through this life change.”\n\nTamera Mowry-Housley, who co-hosts the show and is a Christ-follower, asked Kardashian West if she was referring to her spouse’s religious transformation.\n\nKardashian West responded, “Yes.”\n\nRelated: 9 of the Biggest Faith Bombs Dropped During Kanye West’s Airpool Karaoke\n\nWest’s newfound faith changed his entire outlook, including how he feels about Kardashian West’s often revealing wardrobe.\n\nA recent episode of KEEPING UP WITH THE KARDASHIANS revealed how West did not approve of Kardashian West’s Met Gala ensemble.\n\n“I went through this transition where being a rapper, looking at all these girls and looking at my wife, like, ‘Oh my girl needs to be just like the other girls showing their body off.’ I didn’t realize that that was affecting my soul and my spirit as someone who is married and the father of now … about to be four kids. A corset is a form of underwear, it’s hot, for who though?” the rapper told his wife.\n\nHowever, West’s criticisms didn’t sit well with Kardashian West.\n\n“So the night before the Met you’re going to come in here and say that you’re not into a corset vibe?” she responded. “You’re giving me really bad anxiety. You knew last night I had really bad anxiety, and I don’t need any more negative energy, and for you to say you’re now not into me wearing a tight dress.”\n\nHe fired back, “You are my wife, and it affects me when pictures are too sexy.”\n\n“You built me up to be this sexy person and confidence and all this, and just because you’re on a journey and transformation doesn’t mean I’m in the same spot with you,” she told him.\n\nKardashian West recently celebrated her 39th birthday and teased audiences about dressing “less sexy” when she turns 40 in 2020.\n\nKardashian West is infamous for her nude selfies and promiscuous social media posts.\n\nRelated: Kanye West Just Shook the Country With JESUS IS KING\n\nYet, Kardashian West says she wants to honor her husband in his newfound commitment to Christ.\n\nKardashian West also highlighted how West’s parenting style has become “stricter.”\n\n“The kids are getting older, and he’s very conscious about what we have in the house,” Kardashian West continued. “We got rid of TV in the kids’ rooms and removed makeup from North’s room.”\n\nWith all the change, Kardashian West still assured the fans in the audience that she will still be herself.\n\nPlease pray that the Holy Spirit would work in her heart, as He has in West’s.\n\nTo read about Kardashian West’s recent baptism in Armenia, click here."
