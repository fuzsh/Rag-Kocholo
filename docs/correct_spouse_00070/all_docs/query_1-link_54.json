So I don’t do much.\"\n\nBorn and raised in Staten Island, New York, Pete Davidson, son of firefighter Scott Matthews Davidson, who tragically died during the 9/11 attacks, made a name for himself as an individual whose life story is filled with resilience and fortitude. Notably, his adolescent years were challenging, having been diagnosed with Crohn's disease at 17 and struggling with substance abuse. Despite the odds stacked against him, Davidson's ability to turn adversity into humor led him to a career in stand-up comedy. At the age of 20, Davidson found his footing on the hallowed stages of Saturday Night Live (SNL), being one of the youngest cast members in the long-running show's history. His tenure on SNL has been interspersed with numerous high-profile film and television roles, including parts in Trainwreck, The King of Staten Island, and Suicide Squad. Davidson's performances often shine a spotlight on his sharp wit and unique comedic style, often drawing from his own experiences, making him a relatable figure among his audience. Despite his fame and success, Davidson's personal life hasn't been without controversy. His mental health struggles became public fodder following a high-profile relationship with pop superstar Ariana Grande.
