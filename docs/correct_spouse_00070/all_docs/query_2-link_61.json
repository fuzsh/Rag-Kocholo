        "text": "\"I have this, like, fantasy in my head, like, 'Fourth time's a charm, it's gonna work out,'\" Kardashian told Paltrow when she asked if another marriage was in the cards.\n\nKardashian has been married three times previously: first, to producer Damon Thomas, second, to former NBA player Kris Humphries, and third, to Ye. She and Ye, whose divorce was settled in November, co-parent their four children together: North, 9, Saint, 7, Chicago, 4, and Psalm, 3.\n\nKardashian most recently publicly dated comedian Pete Davidson for nine months, splitting from him in August, Insider previously reported. In the months since, she's spoken about moving forward with her dating life but said on \"Live! With Kelly and Ryan\" in September that she wasn't currently looking for another partner.\n\nKardashian told Paltrow that she was \"so happy to take my time\" while searching for a new partner or a potential marriage and wants to remain single for a \"few years.\" When it comes to having more children, she's hesitant but doesn't want to \"say never\" to the prospect.\n\n\"Whatever's meant to be will be,\" she said."
