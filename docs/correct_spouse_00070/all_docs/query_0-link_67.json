Names, Ages And Pictures Revealed\n\nRead more: Kim Kardashian And Taylor Swift's Complicated Feud Explained\n\nRead more: Why Did Kourtney Kardashian's Baby Have Foetal Surgery?\n\nSo who has Kim dated before? And who are her ex-husbands? Here's a look at her full dating history.\n\nKim Kardashian and Damon Thomas\n\nWith an age gap of 10 years between them, Kim was just 19 when she married music producer Damon Thomas.\n\nTheir marriage lasted three years from 2000 to 2003, with Kim claiming in the divorce papers he had become controlling.\n\nAlthough Kim rarely spoke about their relationship, she did reveal to Scott Discick in an episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians she was “on ecstasy” when she married Damon.\n\nKim Kardashian and Ray J\n\nNow best known as the rapper who made a sex tape with Kim, Ray J dated the reality TV queen on and off from 2002 until 2007, which is when the singer is said to have sold their, erm, intimate video.\n\nTalk of their relationship re-surfaced recently, when Ray J claimed a second sex tape of them together exists and that Kim has always had possession of the tapes.\n\nKim Kardashian and Nick Lachey\n\nKim dated TV star Nick Lachey in 2006 following his high-profile divorce from Jessica Simpson.\n\nYears after splitting from Kim, Nick claimed she used him for publicity, telling a US tabloid: “We went to a movie. No one followed us there. Somehow, mysteriously, when we left, there were 30 photographers waiting outside.”\n\nKim Kardashian and Nick Cannon\n\nKim and TV presenter Nick dated from 2006 to 2007 and apparently split over the sex tape she’d made with Ray J.\n\nNick, who shares two children with ex-wife Mariah Carey, said on The Howard Stern Show: “This was my issue. We talked about this tape…And she told me there was no tape… She’s actually one of the nicest people you’ll ever meet. But the fact that she lied and told me that there was no tape?”\n\nKim Kardashian and Reggie Bush\n\nKim and NFL star Reggie dated from 2007 to 2009 before breaking up and later reuniting, but they eventually ended amicably.\n\nKim Kardashian and Miles Austin\n\nDespite branding their romance “the real deal”, Kim and American football player Miles split in 2010 following a long-distance romance.\n\nAccording to People there was “no huge reason except their distance apart” that led to their split.\n\nKim Kardashian and Kris Humphries\n\nWho can forget Kim and basketball player Kris were married for just 72 days in 2011?\n\nKris later described their marriage as “brutal but 100 per cent real” when hit by claims their relationship was fake.\n\nKim Kardashian and Kanye West\n\nKim and Kanye started dating in 2012 and they married in 2014. Together, they have four children, North, Saint, Chicago and Psalm.\n\nEarly on in 2021, it was revealed Kim and Kanye are getting a divorce, with Kim saying their separate lives – Kanye spends most of his time in Wyoming – simply weren't working.\n\nKim Kardashian and Pete Davidson\n\nKim and Pete dated for nine months before deciding to call it quits at the start of August 2022.\n\nRumours began to whirr online about their relationship at the beginning of November 2021 after Kim and Pete Davidson were spotted celebrating Halloween together days after her SNL debut.\n\nSpeculation around their romance swirled for months before Kim finally decided to post about her new boyfriend on Instagram, then they hard launched their relationship hand-in-hand at the Met Gala 2022.\n\nPete made a brief appearance in The Kardashians season two, which began filming before they went their separate ways.\n\nPete and Kim broke up after they had to make things work long-distance while he was working on a film in Australia. According to Entertainment Tonight their schedules became so busy the spark between them had 'faded'.\n\nKim Kardashian and Odell Beckham Jr\n\nKim and OBJ were first romantically linked in September 2023 and their relationship was seemingly confirmed when they seen together at the 2024 Super Bowl.\n\nBut nine months after the romance rumours began, they couple have decided to part ways. A source told ET: \"\"Kim and Odell have been doing their own things lately.\n\n\"Kim is so busy and hasn't been putting any pressure on herself to be committed to anyone or in a serious relationship. She is all about being a hands-on mom.\"\n\nKim and Odell were friends long before they started dating and the source said they have returned to that friendship. \"They had a good thing and there aren't any hard feelings on either side,\" they added.\n\n\"They started as friends and still are. They will continue to be respectful of each other's spaces, careers, families, and friends.\""
