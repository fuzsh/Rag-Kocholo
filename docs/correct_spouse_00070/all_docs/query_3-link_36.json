        "text": "If you’ve been manifesting a Kimye reconciliation, you might want to sit down for this, because things are not looking good when it comes to Kim Kardashian and Kanye West’s future as a couple.\n\nOn Friday, Kim filed legal documents requesting that a judge declare her legally single amid her and Kanye’s ongoing divorce, according to TMZ. Basically, this means that Kim would like to settle the issue of her legal marital status even as other issues related to the divorce (like child custody and how to divvy up property) are still being sorted out.\n\nAccording to TMZ, Kim also requested that her “maiden name be restored,” meaning she’s officially done being a West.\n\nKim’s legal move is especially noteworthy because of the timing—she filed the paperwork just hours after Kanye got “Kimberly” trending on Twitter when he changed the lyrics to his hit “Runaway,” rapping, “I need you to run right back, baby, more specifically, Kimberly,” during a performance with Drake at the Free Larry Hoover benefit concert in Los Angeles.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Kanye has publicly called on Kim to come back to him (a source even said he has a “holy trinity” of reasons for wanting her back). In November, he delivered a speech about their split, saying, “The narrative God wants is to see that we can be redeemed in all these relationships. We’ve made mistakes. I’ve made mistakes. I’ve publicly done things that were not acceptable as a husband, but right now today, for whatever reason—I didn’t know I was going to be in front of this mic—but I’m here to change the narrative.”\n\nFWIW, Kim “knows where Kanye’s head is” when it comes to their marriage but “ignores it,” a source told People after the concert, adding that Kim has “moved on” but “knows it’s difficult for Kanye to deal with” that fact.\n\n“She isn’t surprised that he pleads in public for her to run back to him,” the source said. “She is just trying to be respectful about it.”"
