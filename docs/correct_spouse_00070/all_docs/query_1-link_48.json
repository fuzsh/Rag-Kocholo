If you meet them and you flirt with them, you get a small boost in your relationship meter with them. You may date either gender. If you neglect your date for some time however, they will break up with you.\n\nYou can gain relationship points by dating them at any location with a inside.\n\nEvery heart counts as one point towards your relationship meter. Note that you will always have the option to break up with them anytime you choose by calling them on a date and then selecting 'break up'.\n\nWhile dates can be expensive, it is fairly rewarding to date for fans and XP.\n\nGameplay\n\nDating\n\nIn order to meet a romantic contact, enter any social locations in the game, which will be filled with people you can talk to. Tap the speech bubble next to their head, and make sure to select the flirt option.\n\nAnother way to meet romantic contacts is through the Konnections feature of the game.\n\nTo increase the relationship meter with a contact, you will need to go on dates with them.\n\nTo invite someone out on a date, go to any of the social locations and tap on the pink heart icon . Your contact list will come up, and you can select the person you want to invite.\n\nEvery heart you collect on a date increases your relationship with that person. Collecting enough hearts takes your relationship to the next level.\n\nIf you don't go a date with your romantic interest in a while, they will break up with you by means of a phone call. You can choose to accept the break-up, or charm them by paying k-stars.\n\nThe higher your relationship score with a person, the more K-Stars it costs to charm them.\n\nIf you break up with someone, a broken heart will appear by their name in you contacts list.\n\nDating Locations\n\nListed in alphabetical order.\n\n10AX Club (Florence)\n\nAlejandro's (Havana)\n\nBlue Mist Spa (Reykjavík)\n\nCafé Hofburg (Vienna)\n\nCasa de Vidrio (Maipo Valley)\n\nChateau Nuit (Las Vegas)\n\nClub Donatella (Milan)\n\nClub Tulip (Paris)\n\nEl Canario (Punta Mita)\n\nKikladhes Club (Mykonos)\n\nJoseph's Cove (San Diego)\n\nLa Rue (Paris)\n\nLavish Lounge Bar (Tokyo)\n\nLif (Miami)\n\nOak (SoHo)\n\nMiraggio Grande (Las Vegas)\n\nNew Jersey, Beach (New Jersey)\n\nN.O.

You can boost your number by buying clothes, cars, or furniture that give gold hearts.\n\nYour golden heart score will award you one extra heart at the beginning of your date, meaning you only have 4 hearts left to fill.\n\nRelationship Levels\n\nOne heart is equivalent to one dating point. Rewards may vary depending on the rank of your partner.\n\n(Chart not completely accurate, your relationships situations may vary.)\n\nLevel Status Rewards Description 0-199 More than Friends 100 3 1 200-499 Boyfriend/Girlfriend 500 10 5 500-999 Soulmate 1000 25 7 Able to get married. 1000-1999 Husband/Wife 1500 50 1 2000-2999 Husband/Wife 3000-3999 Husband/Wife 4000-4999 Husband/Wife 5000-5999 Husband/Wife 6000-9000 Husband/Wife 9000-12000 Husband/Wife Able to have a baby. 12000-15000 Husband/Wife Able to have second baby.\n\nAfter a more recent update, your current date will call you at certain times (after dates) and ask to go on another one, you can either accept or decline. If you accept, you get a mission to go on a date with that person and a time limit of 10 hours to complete it.\n\nTop Couples List\n\nAfter reaching level 7 in the game, you will unlock the Top Couples list feature in the game.\n\nChad Dylan Parker and Crystal Fletcher maintain the Top Couple position in most games.\n\nYou can access the Top Couples list at any time during game play by clicking the feed icon in the bottom menu bar and selecting the Top Couples button.\n\nYou can increase your rank on the Top Couples list by going on dates with a romantic contact and scoring a 5-heart rating.\n\nTop Couples List Rewards\n\nRank Description Reward Starting position on the list. - \"In the Spotlight: You're a top 50 couple! Keep performing well on dates to move up the list!\" 2 \"People Know Us! You're a top 25 couple! Keep performing well on dates to move up the list!\" 2 \"Power Couple! You're a top 10 couple! Keep performing well on dates to move up the list!\" 2 \"Super Couple! You're the top couple! Keep performing well on dates to maintain your top spot!\" 2\n\nGetting Married\n\nAlong with the 2.0 update, the developers of the game added a feature that allows you to get married with your partner in Florence, Italy—the same place where Kim Kardashian and Kanye West got hitched in real life! However, there are a lot of things to consider and accomplish before you walk down the aisle.\n\nBefore getting married, you must go on several dates with your partner to increase your relationship level with them. If you are around 200-499 heart points, you must invite him or her on a date. Once you finish the date, he or she will ask you if you think things are \"getting serious\" between the two of you. You have the option to say yes or disagree with your partner.\n\nIf you agree with him or her, your partner will then sense your commitment to your relationship. In spite of that, the game will give you a goal to go on three more dates with him or her in three days' time before you or your partner will pop the question. After you finish the quest, you need to go on another date with your partner, and before the date starts your partner will propose. If you say yes, you will get a ring, some money and xp. Then Ray Powers will tweet that you are engaged and you will gain about 1,300 fans.\n\nOnce the proposal is done, the media will immediately take notice. Your manager, Simon Orsik, and your publicist, Maria Holmes, will send you on a few quests to deal with your wedding preparations. You will also have to tell Kim Kardashian of your engagement in her Beverly Hills home. After talking with Kim, you will need to purchase a wedding dress or suit. If you are a Starlet, there are fourteen dresses available: two that cost 9,995, five that cost 120, two that cost 90, two that cost 150, one that costs 130, two that cost 100, and two that cost 90. If you are a Star, there are two tops that both cost 9,500.\n\nAfter purchasing a dress or suit, Rupert Ambrose, a famous event organizer, will contact you and invite you over to meet him at Il Forte in Florence to manage your wedding details. Unfortunately, Top Couple Crystal Fletcher and Chad Dylan Parker want to get married at the exact same time and place as you! You will have to pay Rupert 7,500 in a day as a down-payment to secure the location.\n\nSubsequently, a rumor will spread around that your partner is cheating on you! To please the media and prove that the two of you are truly committed to each other, you must go on three more dates in 24 hours. After this, you will be tasked to go on a three-hour photo shoot for several magazines who want to use your wedding as a cover feature.\n\nFollowing your wedding shoot, you finally get the chance to get married! Head on over to Il Forte and your partner will already be there. The ceremony will include a short exchange of vows, and after that, congratulations!
