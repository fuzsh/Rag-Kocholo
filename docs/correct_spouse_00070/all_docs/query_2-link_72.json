        "text": "Shannen Doherty agreed to finalize her divorce from her estranged husband, Kurt Iswarienko, the day before her death.\n\nAccording to People, the “Beverly Hills, 90210” alum filed paperwork to waive spousal support on Friday. She died at age 53 on Saturday.\n\nThe former couple reportedly agreed in the documents to a “default or uncontested dissolution” of their marriage.\n\nIswarienko, 50, signed off on the paperwork on Saturday — the day Doherty died of stage IV cancer.\n\nDoherty filed for divorce from Iswarienko in April 2023 after allegations that he cheated on her, which he denied.\n\nThe “Charmed” star accused Iswarienko of having an affair during their 12-year marriage. The couple tied the knot in 2011.\n\nShe claimed she found out about his infidelity in January 2023 before undergoing surgery to remove a tumor from her brain.\n\n“To not go in that surgery, even though, being very clear, he wanted to go, I couldn’t go into that surgery with him there,” Doherty said on her podcast, “Let’s Be Clear,” in December.\n\n“I felt so betrayed,” she went on. “At the end of the day, I just felt so incredibly unloved by someone I was with for 14 years, by someone I loved with all my heart. Just to have to go through [health crises] while trying to figure out if you’re going to get a f–king divorce and trying to get to the truth of that.”\n\nDoherty was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015, enduring a mastectomy, chemotherapy and radiation. She went into remission in 2017, but in February 2020 she announced she had Stage 4 breast cancer.\n\nThe “Heathers” actress had to deal with her contentious divorce during the last year of her life.\n\nLast month, Doherty claimed in court documents that Iswarienko was delaying their divorce and holding off on paying her spousal support until she died.\n\nShe said at the time she hadn’t been provided financial information about her ex’s “archive” of his photography.\n\n“It is simply not right that Kurt be permitted to prolong our divorce in hopes that I die before he is required to pay me while he continues to live his life and shirk his responsibilities to his dying wife of more than 11 years,” Doherty wrote in the filing, according to Page Six.\n\nBut Iswarienko denied Doherty’s claims and insisted he wanted to finalize the divorce in September 2023, when he offered Doherty a settlement deal that she denied.\n\nAccording to Page Six, Doherty denied Iswarienko’s settlement agreement because he “skirted around the issues of his original works created during [their] marriage” and how much he earned.\n\nDoherty reportedly requested Iswarienko give her $15,343 in monthly spousal support and an additional $9,100 to cover the cost of her lawyers. She also asked for $11,800 for additional fees she acquired “in efforts to obtain Kurt’s complete responses” for their legal proceedings.\n\nThe “Our House” star said in the docs from June that her earnings were going to “drastically” lessen this year since she was unable to work due to her cancer.\n\nAfter Doherty’s death, her friend Tara Furiani, a business consultant who runs a company called Not the HR Lady, slammed Iswarienko in a LinkedIn post.\n\n“I’m really sad and upset about my friend Shannen’s death … Because of the divorce she was going through at the time,” Furiani wrote. She said Iswarienko caused “profound” pain and suffering to Doherty’s life by not being a “decent human being” and showing “a little humanity to his dying wife.”\n\n“Shan lost everything (including her SAG insurance) and her husband was dragging his feet with income discovery in court, in an effort to delay a judgement or payment, until she died (where it would now be moot),” the post also said.\n\nIswarienko was Doherty’s third husband.\n\nShe was previously married to Ashley Hamilton from 1993 to 1994 and Rick Salomon from 2002 to 2003.\n\nThe beloved actress said on her podcast in December that while she “failed three times at marriage,” she still believed in love.\n\n“I also take some responsibility for the demise of our marriage,” she added, referring to her relationship with Iswarienko. “Actually, that’s not true. Let me rephrase that. I do not take responsibility for the demise of our marriage, I take responsibility for some of the issues in our marriage.”"
