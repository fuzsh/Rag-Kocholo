        "text": "Just 10 weeks after their lavish, made-for-TV wedding and less than a month after the wedding special aired, reality starlet Kim Kardashian is cancelling her marriage to NBA player Kris Humphries.\n\nThe \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\" star filed for divorce Monday, citing irreconcilable differences. \"I hope everyone understands this was not an easy decision,\" she said in a statement. \"I had hoped this marriage was forever but sometimes things don't work out as planned.\"\n\nThe filing in Los Angeles County Superior Court provided few details, other than to state the couple have a prenuptial agreement that will dictate how they divide up their assets. Kardashian is asking that both sides pay their own attorneys' costs and that a judge terminate Humphries' rights to spousal support.\n\nKardashian, 31, and Humphries, 26, were wed Aug. 20 in a star-studded, black-tie ceremony at an exclusive canyon estate in the seaside enclave of Montecito, Calif., near Santa Barbara. The couple's wedding registry at a Beverly Hills jeweler totaled $172,000 and included such items as a $1,650 coffee pot and two $1,250 sterling silver vegetable spoons.\n\nIt was the first marriage for Humphries, who last played for the NBA's New Jersey Nets, and the second for Kardashian, who was married to music producer Damon Thomas from 2000 to 2004.\n\nKardashian's sisters and TV co-stars Kourtney Kardashian, 32, and Khloe Kardashian, 27, served as co-maids of honor.\n\nKim Kardashian and Humphries began dating late last year and announced their engagement in May. He proposed on bended knee with a 20.5-carat ring by spelling out \"Will you marry me?\" in rose petals.\n\nThe couple's marriage was the subject of a two-part special on E! Entertainment Television, which televises Kardashian's show that follows the model and her family.\n\nThe special aired Oct. 9 and 10, two months after the ceremony, prompting online card company someecards.com to prophetically offer a greeting last summer that read: \"Here's hoping Kim Kardashian's marriage lasts until her wedding special airs in October.\"\n\nEntertainment media have breathlessly reported every available detail on the relationship since it began, including early signs of trouble earlier this month. Court filings show that Kardashian signed the petition on Sunday.\n\nKardashian said in her statement that she and Humphries \"remain friends and wish each other the best.\"\n\nKardashian's divorce attorney, Laura Wasser, did not return a phone message seeking comment. Humphries' sports agent, Marc Cornstein, also did not return a phone message."
