The breakup came after the two had been dating for nine months.

The following day, they dined with friends at Zero Bond in Manhattan.\n\nThings proved to be heating up between the twosome when Kardashian helped Davidson celebrate his 28th birthday with her mom, Kris Jenner, and Flavor Flav.\n\n“The whole night, I was so honored to be in their presence,” the rapper told Entertainment Tonight about the get-together. One thing that I could say is Pete Davidson loves himself some Flavor Flav. Everything he does is, ‘Flavor Flav this, Flavor Flav that, Flavor Flav this, Flavor Flav that.’ So Kim said, ‘OK, well, for your birthday, you are going to have Flavor Flav.’ She sent for me and that’s how I ended up there. I was the birthday gift.”\n\nCredit: MediaPunch/Shutterstock\n\nDecember 2021\n\nThe couple continued to make headlines for various outings on the East Coast and West Coast through the remainder of 2021, turning heads when they went to the movies on Staten Island.\n\n“They're clearly not hiding their romance,” a source told Us at the time. “It seems like they want to just be able to do things any normal couple would do and have fun together.\"\n\nCredit: Shutterstock (2)\n\nMarch 2022\n\nThe Selfish author addressed her romance with Davidson for the first time, telling Variety that fans will see more of how their relationship began on Hulu's The Kardashians. \"I have not filmed with [Pete],\" she told the outlet. \"And I'm not opposed to it. It's just not what he does. But if there was an event happening and he was there, he wouldn't tell the cameras to get away. I think I might film something really exciting coming, but it wouldn't be for this season. ... I'm definitely open to talking, and I definitely explain it.\"\n\nCredit: MEGA\n\nMarch 2022\n\nIn screenshots of an alleged text exchange between Davidson and West, which was shared by The King of Staten Island co-producer Dave Sirus, Kardashian's new beau defended her parenting amid a social media tirade from the \"Eazy\" rapper.\n\n“Yo it’s Skete, Can you please take a second and calm down,” Davidson allegedly wrote to the Stem player cofounder. “It’s 8am and it don’t gotta be like this. Kim is literally the best mother I’ve ever met. What she does for those kids is amazing and you are so f—king lucky that she’s your kids mom. I’ve decided I’m not gonna let you treat us this way anymore and I’m done being quiet. Grow the f—k up.”\n\nCredit: Shutterstock (2)\n\nApril 2022\n\nIn a clip from her family's primetime ABC sit-down, the reality star revealed just how serious she is about Davidson. \"I am a relationship kind of girl, for sure, and I wouldn't be with someone if I didn't plan on spending a lot of my time with them,\" she shared. \"Obviously, I want to take my time, but I'm very happy and very content. And it's such a good feeling just to be at peace.\"\n\nHer mom gave the relationship her seal of approval, gushing, \"Pete's great, Pete's great. He's a really nice guy.\"\n\nCredit: Courtesy Kim Kardashian/Instagram\n\nApril 2022\n\nKim gushed about how \"content\" she was in her relationship with Davidson during an appearance on the \"Make Space with Hoda Kotb\" podcast. \"It feels good just to know that, like, we have this connection and we have our little bubble of a relationship world that we live in that, like, not a lot of people know about,\" she said. \"We were driving in the car yesterday and I just, like, looked at him and I was like, 'Thank you.' And he was like, 'What?' And I was like, 'For running errands with me, like, this is so much fun just to go to a doctor’s appointment or go to the dentist and just, like, run errands. I’m having so much fun.'\"\n\nHours after the podcast went live, the California native shared photos from a dinner she shared with the comedian after the premiere of her new Hulu show, The Kardashians. \"Late night snack,\" Kim captioned the snaps, which show the couple cuddling with their arms wrapped around each other, as Davidson smiles lovingly at his girlfriend.\n\nCredit: YouTube\n\nApril 2022\n\n“Staten Island is an amazing place,” the Kardashians star gushed during an appearance on Live With Kelly and Ryan. “We had so much fun going to Staten Island, it’s where he’s from. I [wanted] to check it out. … We take ferry rides everywhere. It’s always been super low-key every time we go to Staten Island. I feel like that is the fun part of it. We can just chill and be low-key, ride around and see all the fun hometown stuff and sneak in and out of places. Staten Island has surprisingly been so low-key for us.”\n\nCredit: Hulu; Inset: Shutterstock\n\nJune 2022\n\n\"So, this is how it went down with me and Pete. I did Saturday Night Live and then when we kissed in a scene it was just a vibe. I was like, 'Oh s–t. Maybe I just need to try something different.' But Pete does not come to my afterparty and everyone was at my afterparty. He is not giving me the time of day,\" Kim explained during episode 8 of Hulu's The Kardashians.\n\nThe TV personality went on to reveal that she was the one to make the first move. \"So, a few days later I called the producer at SNL and was like, 'Hey, do you have Pete's number?' I text him,\" she added. \"I wasn't even thinking, 'I am going to be in a relationship with him.' I was just thinking, 'Heard about this BDE, I need to get out there.' I was basically DTF [down to f–k].\"\n\nCredit: Bonnie Cash/UPI/Shutterstock\n\nJune 2022\n\nA source exclusively told Us that the twosome's relationship was \"for sure getting serious,\" adding that the reality star feels \"very comfortable\" around the comedian. \"She is relieved that fans got to see how she bounced back after Kanye and see how happy she is,\" the insider added after Davidson made a minor cameo after the credits ran on the Kardashians' season finale. \"There's still a lot left of her journey with Pete that she can't wait to share with viewers of the show.\"\n\nCredit: Matt Baron/Shutterstock\n\nAugust 2022\n\nA source exclusively told Us that Kim and Davidson aren’t letting long-distance get in the way of their growing romance. “Kim and Pete are in constant communication,” the insider said. “They send each other love notes while the other is sleeping and FaceTime whenever their schedules link up.”\n\nAlthough the “distance has been hard” at times for the couple, the source explained that the SKKN founder and the comedian are “still very smitten with each other and can’t wait until they’re in the same place again.”"
