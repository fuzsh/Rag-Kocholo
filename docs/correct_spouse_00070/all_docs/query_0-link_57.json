        "text": "Kris Humphries is dishing on his marriage to Kim Kardashian.\n\nIn an essay for The Players' Tribune, the basketball player opened up about the 72-day union, denying it was a publicity stunt.\n\n\"Look, I should have known what I was getting into. I was definitely naive about how much my life was going to change. But the one thing that really bothers me is whenever people say that my marriage was fake,\" he said. \"There’s definitely a lot about that world that is not entirely real. But our actual relationship was 100 percent real.\"\n\nHe also talked about the hardship the divorce caused.\n\n\"When it was clear that it wasn’t working &mldr; what can I say? It sucked,\" he said. \"It’s never easy to go through the embarrassment of something like that – with your friends, with your family&mldr;. But when it plays out so publicly, in front of the world, it’s a whole other level. It was brutal.\"\n\nHe said the negative attention left him in a \"dark place.\"\n\n\"I’ll be honest, I dealt with a lot of anxiety, especially in crowds. There was about a year where I was in a dark place. I didn’t want to leave my home,\" he said. \"You feel like &mldr; I don’t know &mldr; the whole world hates you, but they don’t even know why. They don’t even know you at all. They just recognize your face, and they’re on you.\"\n\nHumphries married Kardashian in 2011 in a televised event. Their divorce wasn't finalized until 2013.\n\nKardashian is now married to rapper Kanye West. They share three children together: Saint, Chicago and North.\n\nMore: Kim Kardashian West pokes fun at her 72-day marriage in Instagram post"
