        "text": "Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker surprised fans everywhere when they confirmed reports of their romance in early 2021, but the two knew each other long before they began dating, and had even developed a close platonic relationship.\n\nAhead, we track the entire “Kravis” relationship timeline—from Barker’s initial crush on little sister Kim Kardashian to the couple’s three weddings and blended family dynamic.\n\nDecember 14, 2023: A source reveals how their bond has strengthened with Rocky.\n\nAn insider speaks to Entertainment Tonight about the couple’s “unbreakable bond.”\n\n“Kourtney and Travis are over the moon and could not be more elated that they share a child of their own together,” the source tells the outlet. “Kourtney and Travis already had an unbreakable bond, but having a baby together has brought them even closer and made them fall even more in love. This experience has solidified their feelings that they were destined to be together.”\n\nThe source adds that Barker and Kardashian share a deep commitment to their family. “Travis loves to shower Kourtney with gifts, but is also there for her on a deep level,” they explain. “He is an incredibly dedicated father and partner. They’re so excited to experience this new chapter together and unite their families even more.”\n\nThe couple’s kids from previous relationships are also reveling in the family’s new addition. As the source says, “They are so grateful that their baby boy is healthy and that both sets of kids get along. It’s been so much fun for all of them to have a baby brother around and something new that they can all share together. Each of them have a special bond with Rocky in their own unique ways.”\n\nNovember 1, 2023: Kourtney gives birth to their baby boy.\n\nThe couple welcome the arrival of their baby boy, Rocky.\n\nThe happy news comes days after the drummer revealed in a podcast that Kardashian’s due date fell “either on Halloween, or like the first week of November.”\n\nSeptember 2023: Kourtney undergoes “urgent fetal surgery.”\n\nIn a vulnerable Instagram post, the reality TV star reveals that she was recently hospitalized for “urgent fetal surgery” that saved the life of her unborn baby.\n\n“I will be forever grateful to my incredible doctors for saving our baby’s life. I am eternally grateful to my husband who rushed to my side from tour to be with me in the hospital and take care of me afterwards, my rock. And to my mom, thank you for holding my hand through this,” she writes in the caption. “As someone who has had three really easy pregnancies in the past, I wasn’t prepared for the fear of rushing into urgent fetal surgery. I don’t think anyone who hasn’t been through a similar situation can begin to understand that feeling of fear. I have a whole new understanding and respect for the mamas who have had to fight for their babies while pregnant.”\n\nShe adds, “Praise be to God. Walking out of the hospital with my baby boy in my tummy and safe was the truest blessing. 🙏🏼🤍”\n\nJune 24, 2023: They reveal their baby’s gender.\n\nThe couple confirm that their baby is a boy during their gender reveal party, where Kardashian showcases her maternity style in a baby blue turtleneck dress.\n\nPer their joint teaser video on Instagram, Kardashian and Barker stand before a crowd by a drum set, where Barker begins a drumroll—and a burst of blue streamers shoot up behind them.\n\nDays later, Kardashian shares photos from their special reveal on Instagram, where she poses by the drum set on Barker’s lap. “Little drummer boy coming soon,” Kardashian captions the post alongside a string of drum emojis.\n\nJune 16, 2023: Kourtney and Travis announce that they’re expecting their first child!\n\nKardashian announces her pregnancy with a surprise reveal during Barker’s Blink-182 show in L.A. While cheering in the crowd, the star holds up a hand-painted sign reading, “Travis, I’m pregnant!”—paying homage to a similar scene in the band’s music video for the 1999 track “All the Small Things.” She also shows her visible bump in a sheer black bodysuit, paired with a bandeau top worn underneath and baggy leather pants.\n\nKardashian posts a clip of the special moment on Instagram, followed by a series of behind-the-scenes pics showing the Poosh founder preparing the sign for the big announcement.
