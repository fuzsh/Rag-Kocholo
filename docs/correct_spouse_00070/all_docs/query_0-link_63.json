        "text": "NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) -- That was quick.\n\nDespite recent attempts to dispel rumors that their marriage was in trouble, New Jersey Nets power forward and sex-tape-turned-reality-television star Kim Kardashian have filed for divorce.\n\nThe couple married on August 20, in what other members of the Kardashian crew called \"Royal Wedding #2.\"\n\nThe event was taped and packaged for a television special which aired on E! After returning from their honeymoon, the couple called the Park Avenue Gansevoort home.\n\n\"I hope everyone understands this was not an easy decision,\" Kardashian said in a statement. \"I had hoped this marriage was forever but sometimes things don't work out as planned.\"\n\nSee Also: The Latest Celebrity Breakups | New York Athletes' Wives & Girlfriends\n\nAfter 72 days as a married couple, Kim Kardashian filed for divorce, citing \"irreconcilable differences.\"\n\nKardashian said the two \"Remain friends and wish each other the best.\"\n\nShe has hired Laura Wasser, who has previously represented stars like Britney Spears, Maria Shriver and Angelina Jolie.\n\nLast week, the New York Post reported that prior to her relationship with Humphries, Kardashian's people placed a phone call to the New York Knicks to see if then-team member Danilo Gallinari would be interested in dating Kim and having a role on her reality show."
