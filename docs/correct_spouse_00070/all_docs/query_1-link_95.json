        "text": "I spend a great deal of time investing in the institution of marriage because I believe it’s the bedrock of a society.\n\nI’ve been married for over 25 years and I know firsthand the time and energy it takes to build a thriving relationship with a spouse. Many other people do, too, and that’s why I get frustrated that we only hear about sensationalized marriage stories in the media.\n\nRecently, you heard about Kim Kardashian’s ridiculous marriage that lasted less than 100 days. Sadly, that’s the one that everybody talked about and focused on when, at the same time, there was something pretty incredible going on right in my own community of Holland, Mich.\n\nEvery year at Winning At Home, we have what we call our Legacy Dinner. It’s a night when we honor marriage. You need a golden ticket to be invited because the entrance fee is that you’ve been married at least 50 years. This year, we celebrated with over 75 couples, which represented over 4,000 years of marriage!\n\nOf course, that wouldn’t make the news, but I consider it one of the biggest reality shows in town. It proves that commitment is possible. I imagine if you sat down with any of these couples, they would tell you the incredible stories of how their marriage survived, when they didn’t think it would.\n\nIt’s not surprising to learn that the U.S. Census Bureau reported in 2010 that the number of married Americans dropped to around 54 percent, down from 72 percent in 1972. Additionally, 70 percent of respondents said they thought the institution of marriage is weaker today than it was 20 years ago.\n\nNearly 4-in-10 survey respondents believe marriage is obsolete. I think part of the reason why people responded that way is because marriages that don’t succeed is what the media chooses to promote.\n\nDespite those statistics, I believe in the legacy of marriage. I hope to spread this story all across the nation. Our goal in honoring long-term marriages is to highlight the standard these couples are holding up for the rest of us to follow. We should focus our attention and cameras on these people instead of the trivial, silly, one-second glamorous moments that Hollywood continues to feed us.\n\nCan you tell I’m a little ticked off? I hope so. Can you tell I’m up on my soapbox? I am, and I’d encourage you to jump up on it with me and shout from the rooftops that marriage can last!\n\nRecently, I was speaking at an event, and a gentleman, who has been through a divorce, thanked me for what I was doing in promoting marriage and telling people marriage can be forever. He told me he had wanted his to last. People want marriage to survive and do well because it’s a great example to all of society. It gives everyone hope.\n\nSo take that Hollywood! Take that, all of you who to continue to glamorize divorce and act like it’s the greatest thing since sliced bread. I’m tired of it, and I believe the time is now to take back marriage. Applaud and give encouragement to the marriage legacies in your family, among your friends and in your community.\n\nDuring this holiday season, take time to thank the couples in your life who have been a great example of marriage to you. Please do your part to help spread the word about people having successful marriages. Let’s stop celebrating celebrities who collect marriages like they do Academy Awards.\n\nDan Seaborn is a non-denominational Christian evangelist and a published author of such books as \"The Necessary Nine: How to Stay Happily Married for Life!\" He is the founder of Winning at Home Inc., a ministry that focuses its attention on the relationships between a husband and wife and between parents and their children."
