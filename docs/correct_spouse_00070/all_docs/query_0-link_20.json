        "text": "Kim and Cohen were also joined by Kim's sisters — Kourtney Kardashian, Khloé Kardashian, Kylie Jenner, and Kendall Jenner — and momager Kris Jenner during Thursday's interview.\n\nDuring the conversation, Kim admitted that she felt pressured to go ahead with her wedding to Humphries in 2011 because they filmed it for \"KUWTK,\" and she didn't want to be known as \"the runaway bride forever,\" even though she had cold feet and didn't really want to get married.\n\nJenner chimed in and said that she encouraged her daughter to reconsider marrying Humphries if Kim was having second thoughts about the then-engaged couple's relationship.\n\nAccording to Kim, Jenner told her: \"Go. I'm going to put you in a car. No one will find you. Just leave, and I'll handle it.\"\n\nKim said on Thursday that she realized that she'd \"made the wrong decision\" in marrying Humphries when the couple was on their honeymoon in Italy, and she felt \"claustrophobic\" just from looking at his shoes in their hotel room.\n\n\"I was so nervous to break up with someone,\" Kim told Cohen about her split from Humphries. \"I totally handled it the wrong way. I fully broke up with him in the worst way, and I just didn't know to deal.\"\n\n\"I learned so much from it,\" she added.\n\nWhen Cohen asked Kim if she thought she owed Humphries an apology for the manner in which she broke up with the NBA star, Kim said \"absolutely,\" adding that she actually tried calling Humphries \"for months\" to apologize but never heard back.\n\nKim and Humphries were married for 72 days\n\nKim filed for divorce only two months into their marriage and it was finalized in 2013, shortly before she gave birth to her daughter, North, with then-boyfriend rapper Kanye West.\n\nWhile it's unclear how Humphries feels about his short-lived marriage almost a decade later, Kim said during the reunion he refused to talk to her when they ran into each other in 2015.\n\n\"I had North in my hand. I had my big huge belly — I was about to give birth to Saint,\" Kim said about running into Humphries. \"All of his friends got up and said 'Hi' to me, and he looked at me and wouldn't even speak to me.\"\n\nThe aspiring lawyer also pushed back on media speculations that she married Humphries for publicity, clarifying that whatever money she and her ex-husband made to film the wedding for \"KUWTK\" was actually used to pay for the ceremony and the reception.\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"I wanted a bigger wedding than what ['KUWTK' was] going to pay for,\" Kim said. \"So I used all of our production money on the wedding. If that was fake, I would have saved my money.\"\n\nHumphries also previously shot down rumors that the two got married for the cameras. In a 2019 essay for The Player's Tribune, Humphries said it \"bothered\" him when people called his marriage to Kim \"fake.\"\n\n\"There's definitely a lot about that world that is not entirely real,\" Humphries wrote in the essay. \"But our actual relationship was 100% real. When it was clear that it wasn't working … what can I say? It sucked.\""
