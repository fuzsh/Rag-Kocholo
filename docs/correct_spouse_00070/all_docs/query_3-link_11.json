And since their relationship is best described as *extremely private*, we might as well take the opp to look back on Kim K's dating history—which is full of surprises including Nick Lachey and Gabriel Aubrey.\n\nDamon Thomas: 2000-2003\n\nDamon was Kim's first husband (they got married when she was 19 and he was 28), though according to Kim she made the impulse decision to elope in Vegas while high on ecstasy. As she put it on Keeping Up With the Kardashians, \"I got married on ecstasy [...] I did ecstasy once and I got married, I did it again and I made a sex tape. Like, everything bad would happen.\"\n\nDamon and Kim don't appear to be in communication these days, but in 2022 Damon said he thought Kim's comments about their marriage on television were “unfair.”\n\nRay J: ~2004\n\nKim and Ray J dated for a short amount of time but made a sex tape together that ended up being distributed. Ray J has denied leaking the tape, and claimed its release was \"a deal and a partnership between Kris Jenner and Kim and me.\" Meanwhile, Kris has completely denied any involvement in selling the tape, including during a lie detector test on The Late Late Show.\n\nNick Lachey: ~2006\n\nNick and Kim dated super briefly in 2006 and were spotted holding hands at The Da Vinci Code. Alas, their relationship didn't exactly end well, with Nick claiming Kim used him for headlines.\n\n\"To say that she's my ex is a little bit of a liberal use of the term,\" Nick said on Watch What Happens Live. \"She left about halfway through and went to the restroom and then shockingly there were 25 paparazzi when we left the theater. I think there were other things in play on our little rendezvous.\"\n\nNick Cannon: ~2006-2007\n\nKim and Nick dated for about a year after meeting on set of Moesha. During a 2021 episode of Drink Champs, Nick said, \"I was really into her, I was vibing. She broke my heart.\"\n\nMore recently Nick said he'd date Kim again, musing, “Hey, it’s all love, but that’s Kim Kardashian. I’d definitely spin the block.\" He then added re: Kim and Pete Davidson, \"I don’t know what their situation is. I’m not messy, I’m patient. Let’s just say that.\"\n\nThe Game: ~2007\n\nKim and The Game dated right before she got together with Reggie Bush—at least according to him. As he put it to Us Weekly, \"We start dating a little bit, but I would always hook my Xbox up. She had that good internet.” The Game also claimed he was “damn near in love,” but they ended things after he allegedly saw Reggie Bush in her condo building.\n\nReggie Bush: ~2007-2009\n\nKim and Reggie had a super on-again/off-again relationship, before splitting for good in 2009. A source at the time told People, \"They never get to see each other, ever. It's been a long time coming. They still love each other and are part of their lives, but Reggie spends six months out of the year in New Orleans, so it's tough.\"\n\nThe exes appear to be on good terms, and back in 2018, Reggie told Us Weekly, “She’s doing a great job creating a brand for herself, her and her family. I’m happy for ’em.…She’s very smart.”\n\nMiles Austin: ~2010\n\nThey dated for like two seconds and split due to \"distance.\" A classic celeb reason! As a People source put it, \"There's no huge reason except their distance apart. With his season and Kim's filming it just slowly split them apart. They tried to keep it as low profile as possible when they were together. They were acting as if they were single or just having fun, but they never were–it was the real deal. They were always strong, but before Kim left for Europe they decided it's not fair that they don't get to spend more time together and ended it.\"\n\nGabriel Aubrey: ~2010\n\nIt was super brief (as in, they just went on a few dates), and a source told People, “They still talk. They were getting to know each other, but realized they might be better off just being friendly.”\n\nKris Humphries: ~2011\n\nThey dated for six months, got engaged, had a televised wedding, and were divorced a mere 72 days later. He ended up opening up about the split for Players Tribune, saying, “There’s definitely a lot about that world that is not entirely real. But our actual relationship was 100 percent real. When it was clear that it wasn’t working…what can I say? It sucked....It’s never easy to go through the embarrassment of something like that—with your friends, with your family…but when it plays out so publicly, in front of the world, it’s a whole other level. It was brutal.”\n\nAnyway, enjoy this:\n\nKanye West: 2012-2021\n\nKim and Kanye started dating right after she and Kris Humphries ended things, but after almost a decade of marriage and four kids, Kim filed for divorce. She's opened up about the decision on The Kardashians, saying, \"For so long, I did what made other people happy. And I think in the last two years I decided, I'm going to make myself happy. And that feels really good. And even if that created changes and caused my divorce, I think it's important to be honest with yourself about what really makes you happy. I've chosen myself. I think it's okay to choose you.\"\n\nPete Davidson: October 2021-August 2022\n\nPete and Kim connected when she hosted SNL (and shared a mid-skit kiss), and they dated all the way up until August 2022—when a source told E! News they decided to just be friends and still have “a lot of love and respect for each other.” The reason for their split? Long-distance, which “made it really difficult to maintain a relationship.”\n\nFred: 2023-???\n\nKim is secretly chatting with a dude she's dubbed \"Fred,\" and thus far his identity has remained a secret. \"You obviously learn from every situation, and the one thing I learned from the last situation was the media made me feel like I was in a very serious relationship so quickly,\" Kim said via People, explaining why she hasn't revealed Fred. \"I just want to sneak around a little bit. There's nothing wrong with wanting to sneak!\"\n\nOdell Beckham Jr.: Sept 2023 - Now"
