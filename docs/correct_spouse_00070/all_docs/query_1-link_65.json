        "text": "Kim Kardashian, the 43 year old star of The Kardashians, is predicted to be with a wealthy and creative man in 2024, according to a celebrity psychic.\n\nKim, who has been married three times since 2000, is \"no longer looking for eye candy\", it has been claimed.\n\nHer most famous marriage was to Kanye West from 2014 to 2022, and they had four children together. However, their marriage ended in November 2022. Now, as Kanye moves on with his new wife Bianca Censori, everyone is curious about who Kim will date next.\n\nClick here to follow the Mirror US on Google News to stay up to date with all the latest news, sport and entertainment stories.\n\nREAD MORE: Kim Kardashian 'taking different approach to dating' after Pete Davidson and Kanye West\n\nCelebrity psychic Inbaal Honigman did a Tarot reading for Kim, exclusively for The Mirror, with her revealing the fashion icon's dating habits for the next year.\n\nInbaal started her reading by saying that Kim's dating priorities have shifted, stating \"she is no longer interested in being linked with eye candy alone\". She also mentioned: \"The Tarot cards show that the billionaire socialite is looking for a different man, intelligent, educated, intuitive and politically aware.\"\n\nDuring her reading, Inbaal drew the Priestess card, which she said represents Kim's love life in 2024, \"indicating that she will meet someone sensitive in February, a creative and an activist, perhaps a screenwriter or a director\".\n\nSpeaking about Kim's potential new romance with a creative person, Inbaal shared that their relationship \"will be subtle and quiet, they will be seen together but not on many red carpets\". She also suggested that the man Kim ends up with will likely be a \"lover of fashion, the new man will match Kim's love of dressing in designer and bling\".\n\nContinuing her reading, Inbaal said: \"The 9 of Wands Tarot card says that Kim's patience with men is a thing of the past, she now prefers a one-strike-and-out approach and doesn't wait around any more.\"\n\n\"Once she's seen that a partner is unsuitable, she's gone. People-pleaser Kim has grown up and now lives to please her kids and is sensible with her priorities.\"\n\nInbaal, the expert, ended her analysis by drawing the Hierophant Tarot card. She said it shows Kim's future: \"with a gentleman who's a powerful activist with links to the Middle East. The wealthiest Kardashian will be dating a calm, intelligent, established man\", she shared."
