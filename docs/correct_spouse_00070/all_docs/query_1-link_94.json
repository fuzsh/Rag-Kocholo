        "text": "One of the hottest celeb couples of 2022 called it quits. After nine months together, Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson broke up, shocking fans. Just days before their split, sources claimed that the two were “smitten” with each other and were making their long-distance relationship work while Pete filmed a movie in Australia and Kim remained stateside in Los Angeles. But the Kim-Pete era appears to be over.\n\nA romance between the two started to surface after the duo shared an on-screen kiss during Kim’s Saturday Night Live appearance in October 2021. It continued to pick up steam as Kim and Pete joined the mogul's sis, Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker, for fun-filled double dates, vacationed together, and even walked some major red carpets as a couple (hello, Met Gala!). The two got pretty serious — Pete even inked four tattoos dedicated to Kim on himself.\n\nDespite the split, the former couple is reportedly still in contact, leading many to wonder if Kim and Pete are really done for good. If you’re looking to walk down memory lane and are still wondering how this unlikely duo became one of social media’s hottest topics, read on for a complete relationship timeline of Kim and Pete’s months-long romance.\n\nJune 8, 2023: Kim says her relationship with Pete makes her want to 'sneak around' with her new mystery man\n\nIn the latest episode of , Kim dished that while she has moved on to another, she's not quite ready to reveal the identity of her mystery man just yet. The star opened up about her very public relationship with Pete.\n\n\"You obviously learn from every situation, and I feel the one thing I learned from last situation was the media made me feel like I was in a very serious relationship so quickly. I just want to sneak around a little bit. There's nothing wrong with wanting to sneak!\" Kim said in a confessional.\n\nJune 1, 2023: Kim said she cautioned Pete at the start of their relationship\n\nWhile Kim and Pete remained pretty low-key throughout the course of their nine-month relationship, the SKIMS founder is opening up about their romance — and eventual split — in the latest season of The Kardashians. In the June 1 episode, Kim talks to Scott Disick and her sis Khloé Kardashian about the struggles of dating someone when you’re on a reality show (a very famous one at that), and shares that at the beginning of their relationship, she had a candid conversation with Pete about it.\n\n“It’s hard when you start dating someone, and you live your life on a reality show, so Pete and I had that conversation right away. You obviously know what you're getting yourself into,” she told Scott and Khlo. “But then the fans were like, ‘Pete’s not on the show.’ And I was like, ‘We said that from the start. It’s not what he does.’”\n\n“But then I opened up, then I had him on the show, I talked about every last thing,” she continued. (ICYMI, Pete briefly appeared on the show during season 2, when he and Kim attended the 2022 Met Gala together.) “He was on at what level he was comfortable with,” Kim added in a confessional scene.\n\nMay 30, 2023: Kim “has her eye” on “somebody special”\n\nKim is seemingly moving on after her split from Pete. An unnamed source dished to Us Weekly about the state of Kim's love life and the possibility of her being involved in a new romance. “Kim isn’t officially dating anybody, but there is somebody who she’s interested in,” the source said. “So far, there have only been subtle flirtations between them, but they haven’t gone out yet.”\n\nAccording to the insider, Kim is “interested in pursuing things,” but she wants to “keep it under the radar” if things progress. “She’s not ready to be seen out on a date with anybody for the time being because she doesn't want to make it a big deal,” the source continued. “She knows once she’s seen on a date then things get blown out of proportion quickly, but there is somebody special she has her eye on, so she’s excited about where things could go.”\n\nMay 25, 2023: Kim opens up about her breakup with Pete\n\nNine months after Kim and Pete parted ways, the reality star opened up about their split. During the season 3 premiere of Hulu’s The Kardashians, Kim told Scott Disick and sister Khloé Kardashian that she and Pete “had talks and talks” and both “communicated really well about it.”\n\n“Breakups are just like, not my thing,” she explained. “It’s obviously sad... [Nine months] is a long time.” Kim added that she felt “a lot of guilt” about their break-up, considering that Pete “went through a lot” because of her relationship with ex-husband, Kanye West. When their split first made headlines, Kim and Pete’s teams cited long-distance and their busy schedules as the catalyst. Reports claimed that Kim wasn’t ready to date after Pete, which the Skims founder seemed to confirm during a Kardashians confessional. “I’m single and I’m not ready to mingle and that’s OK,” she admitted to cameras.\n\nMay 1, 2023: Kim and Pete reunite at the 2023 Met Gala\n\nAll appears to be well between exes Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson. The former couple was all smiles as photographers snapped pictures of a conversation between Kim, Pete, and R&B legend Usher.\n\nThe duo's friendly reunion was a bit serendipitous as Kim and Pete attended last year's Met Gala as a couple.\n\nNovember 2, 2022: Kim and Pete are “not speaking”\n\nIt’s been three months since Kim and Pete split, and although fans recently speculated that the exes are texting again, we’re sorry to say that no, that is not the case. On November 2, an insider told E! News that Kim and Pete “are not speaking” and “not hanging out again.”\n\nEyebrows raised on Kim’s 42nd birthday, when she uploaded a photo of a gorgeous bouquet of flowers and a Jasmin Diptyque candle — many thought that the sweet gift was from Pete, due to the fact that their first kiss happened during their Saturday Night Live Aladdin and Jasmine sketch. Then, on October 24, Entertainment Tonight reported that Kim and Pete “still keep in touch.”\n\nBut it appears that the rumors are *not* true, and the two are keeping their distance following their break-up.\n\nOctober 22, 2022: Pete allegedly sent Kim flowers for her birthday\n\nKim took to social media to showcase beautiful floral arrangements she received in honor of her 42nd birthday. A jasmin-scented Diptyque candle stood out to many followers after Kim shared her birthday gifts on her Instagram Story. Many believe the florals and candle were a gift from Pete as a nod to the “Jasmine and Aladdin” sketch (which served as their first on-screen kiss) during a Saturday Night Live sketch in October 2021. Before their split, Pete even inked the names of the Disney characters to celebrate his then-girlfriend.\n\nNews of the rumored gift comes after a source revealed to Entertainment Tonight that Kim and Pete have been communicating. According to ET, “Pete and Kim still keep in touch.” A source told the outlet that the former couple's split “wasn't a bad fallout or breakup, so things are good between them, and they've remained in contact.”\n\nOctober 15, 2022: Kim and Pete have been texting each other for support\n\nDespite the fact that they're no longer dating, Hollywood Life reported that the former couple have been texting each other recently.\n\nFollowing the situation with Kim's ex-husband Kanye West (the antisemitic comments and the \"White Lives Matter\" shirt at Paris Fashion Week, among other things), a source confirmed to Hollywood Life that lots of people have been reaching out to offer their support to Kim — including Pete Davidson.\n\n“Pete has texted Kim a few times about the whole Kanye situation because he still cares about her as a person and wanted to check in to see how she was doing,” the source explained. “He’s in the middle of shooting another movie but he’s been in touch. He’s such a sweet guy and Kim’s grateful they can still be friends.”\n\nOctober 6, 2022: Kim has a sweet theory for why “hot girls” fall for Pete\n\nSeason two of The Kardashians is currently airing on Hulu, and even though Kim and Pete are now broken up (💔), they were still together at the time of the reality series’ filming. In the latest episode, Kim is in Milan, Italy for Fashion Week with Kendall. During a break between shows and events, the business mogul embarks on a shopping trip, and purchases a New York Yankees hat for the Staten Island native.\n\nWhen the episode cuts to a confessional interview, Kim opens up about why women are so attracted to Pete. “Pete has the best heart. I feel like people, they have this, like, idea of him that he dates all these hot girls and, like, he does, but he’s just, like, the sweetest, most thoughtful person,” she shared. “And I’m here in Milan, and thinking about him, so just wanna pick up just, like, a little thoughtful gift.” Aw. 🥺\n\nOctober 4, 2022: Pete may have removed one of his tattoos dedicated to Kim\n\nAlthough Kim and Pete split in early August, the comedian still faces a few, um, unavoidable reminders of their former relationship. ICYMI, Kim revealed back in March that Pete had inked a handful of tattoos dedicated to her. One of these included a tat on his chest that read, “My Girl Is a Lawyer.” But, according to new photos published by TMZ, it seems that the comedian has removed the ink.\n\nOn set in New York City for his new comedy series, Bupkis, Pete was photographed with a white bandage on his collarbone. The covering seems to be exactly where his Kim-centric “lawyer” tattoo was placed. But one source close to Pete told Entertainment Tonight that “while he continues to remove his tattoos, that image is from set and not related to removing the lawyer tattoo.”\n\nSo it remains a mystery for now, but don’t forget — Pete *also* has “Jasmine ∞ Aladdin” (a nod to their shared sketch on Saturday Night Live) and Kim’s children’s initials tattooed on his chest. Oh, and he branded “KIM” on himself too. The removal process might be a bit trickier for that one.\n\nSeptember 26, 2022: Kim says she's uninterested in dating following her breakup with Pete\n\nKim is taking it slow after ending things with Pete over a month ago. While she previously joked about the types of men that she'd like to date after their split, Kim recently revealed that she wants to take her time before getting into another relationship. The SKIMS founder appeared on Live with Kelly and Ryan, where she confirmed that she sees herself with \"absolutely no one\" in the very near future.\n\n\"I’m not looking for anything,\" she added. \"I think I really just need to be by myself and focus and finish school and focus [on] my kids.\"\n\nKim's comments come after she appeared on the Late Late Show With James Corden, where she joked about visiting \"a hospital and meet a doctor\" or possibly finding a new bf at a \"law firm.\" She also said that she thought she'd end up with someone who worked as a \"scientist, neuroscientist, biochemist, doctor, [or] attorney.\"\n\nSeptember 6, 2022: Kim calls Pete \"such a good person\"\n\nKim and Pete split one month ago, but in her cover story for Interview magazine, the reality star gushed over her then-boyfriend.\n\n“He’s a cutie. He’s literally such a good person, they don’t really make them like him anymore,” Kim said. “I’m excited for what he has coming up.”\n\nKim presumably sat down for this interview before she and Pete broke up, but it’s evident that the business mogul always admired and supported him. At the time of their split, sources close to the couple revealed to E! News that they had “a lot of love and respect for each other,” but their busy schedules “made it really difficult to maintain a relationship.”\n\nAnd while Kim only has good things to say about Pete, it’s unlikely that the pair will get back together. “It was an amicable split. They had discussed ending their relationship for a bit. It wasn’t sudden,” one insider told People in early August. “And it was a mutual decision. Getting back together is not in the cards right now.” Sigh.\n\nAugust 23, 2022: A source says that Kim is ready to date again after her break-up with Pete\n\nAlthough Kim and Pete's romantic journey ended a few weeks ago, an anonymous source tells E! News that the reality star turned business mogul is ready to start dating again. According to the source, Kim is \"asking who she should date next\" and that \"all of her friends are constantly trying to set her up.\"\n\nA second source chimed in, telling E! News the qualities Kim is looking for in her next relationship. \"Kim's expressed she's ready to date someone older but it has to be the right person who understands her life,\" they said. \"She isn't compromising her freedom right now.\" They also revealed that she \"enjoys dating and is definitely open to putting herself out there again.\"\n\nAugust 17, 2022: Pete will barely appear in the upcoming season of The Kardashians\n\nHulu's hit series The Kardashians filmed its second season as Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson's former relationship flourished. The duo's preparation for their official red carpet debut at the 2022 Met Gala was highlighted in a teaser for the upcoming season, but that's as involved as Pete will reportedly get on the reality show. A source close to the Saturday Night Live comedian told Page Six that Pete will barely appear in the upcoming season. \"He's in the background, but the reality world is not built for people like Pete,\" the source revealed. \"He was not on the first season. I don't know how they're doing the second season, but he's not a part of that world.\" Further details on how the series will discuss Kim and Pete's breakup have not been confirmed. We'll all just have to wait and see what happens when The Kardashians season two debuts on September 22.\n\nAugust 8, 2022: Kim supports Pete's decision to seek therapy\n\nOn Monday, August 8, People reported that Pete Davidson has been in trauma therapy due to online harassment from Kim Kardashian's ex-husband Kanye West.\n\nAccording to Page Six, Kim agrees with Pete's decision. \"Kim was very supportive of Pete going to therapy,\" a source told the media outlet. \"Kanye was very detrimental. He was posting negative things — now add thousands and thousands of comments. Someone has to work with you to deal with something like that.\"\n\nPete reportedly sought trauma therapy in April after receiving death threats from Kanye's fans. \"Getting death threats from [Kanye's] fans and all the negative attention online doesn't feel good for the average person — add someone who’s struggled with mental illness, and it’s even worse,\" the source said.\n\nWhen news of Kim and Pete's breakup surfaced online, Kanye posted (and deleted) an edited newspaper cover announcing the death of Skete, the nickname the rapper dubbed Pete when he first began dating Kim.\n\nAugust 6, 2022: Kim and Pete break up\n\nIt’s a breakup that truly none of us here at Seventeen saw coming. On Friday evening, E! News reported that Kim and Pete broke up after nine months together.Insiders close to the couple reportedly told the outlet that Kim and Pete have “a lot of love and respect for each other” but realized that the demands of their busy schedules “made it really difficult to maintain a relationship.” The outlet confirmed that Kim and ex Kanye West are still moving ahead with their divorce.\n\nMultiple rumors of why Kim and Pete split so suddenly have started to surface. Some sources say it was too difficult for them to maintain a relationship with their busy schedules, as mentioned above, but others told Page Six that Kim was left “totally exhausted by this relationship and other things going on in her life.” 😳\n\n“Pete is 28 and Kim is 41 — they are just in very different places at the moment, ” the source shared with the outlet. “Pete is totally spontaneous and impulsive and wants her to fly to New York, or wherever he is on a moment’s notice... But Kim has four kids and it isn’t that easy. She needs to focus on the kids.”\n\nAround the time the news broke, Kim posted a carousel of selfies of herself and her kids wearing Yeezy’s new collection of sunglasses. Meanwhile, Pete was spotted celebrating his sister’s graduation from the physician’s assistant program at Pace University in New York City. But a day later, E! News shared a photo of Pete making a bold fashion statement following the split — back in Australia on the set of his new film Wizards!, the comedian wore a shirt that read “What... I feel like s**t.” 🥺🥺🥺\n\nAugust 1, 2022: Kim and Pete are making their long-distance relationship work\n\nThey say absence makes the heart grow fonder, and it's apparently true for Kim and Pete. A source told E! News that \"The distance hasn't been an issue for Kim and Pete's relationship while he's been away filming. They are still going strong and making it work.\"\n\nKim just visited Pete in Australia, but even “when they are apart, they are in constant communication,” “FaceTime consistently,” and are “always getting quick phone calls in when they can,\" according to the source.\n\nSo in other words, the two are still going strong and are totally obsessed with each other. “Kim loves that he’s always making her laugh and he truly makes her day when they talk. She is still smitten over him and it just works for her,\" the insider says.\n\nThough it is unclear when Pete’s movie wraps production, the source adds that he'll be heading straight to Los Angeles ASAP, saying Pete wants to \"spend time with her for a few days.\"\n\nJuly 16, 2022: Kim travels to Australia to visit Pete\n\nWe reportedly have a new location unlocked for Kim and Pete's whirlwind romance — Cairns, Queensland in Australia. According to the Daily Mail, the reality star jetted off in her private jet to the land down under to reunite with her beau after four weeks apart.\n\nPete is in Australia to shoot his new A24 film Wizards!, alongside Orlando Bloom, Naomi Scott, and Sean Harris. E! News reports that the trip is a quick one, and according to a family insider, \"She wanted to spend time with her kids before she left and did some special travel with them. Now she's off to see Pete and is very excited.\"\n\nWe cannot wait to see the vacation pics.\n\nJuly 12, 2022: Pete says he wants to be a father one day\n\nJust one day after Kim shared a carousel of new pics of her and Pete, offering fans another small glimpse into their romance, the Saturday Night Live comedian shared a *major* relationship goal of his.\n\nIn a clip posted by E! News from the upcoming season of Kevin Hart's Hart to Heart series, Pete expresses that he's \"definitely a family guy\" and hopes to be a father one day.\n\n\"My favorite thing ever, which I have yet to achieve, is I want to have a kid. That's like my dream,\" he said. \"I'm so excited for like, that chapter, so like, that's kind of what I'm just preparing for now, is trying to be like as good of a dude, and develop, and get better, so when that happens, it's just easier.\" My heart. 🥺\n\nKim shares her four children, North, Saint, Chicago, and Psalm, with ex-husband Kanye West, but she hinted back in April that she'd like to have kids with Pete. When the Kar-Jenner fam was asked in an interview with Access Hollywood who would have six children like their matriarch Kris Jenner, Kim nominated herself. After being asked if Pete will be around \"for a long time or a good time,\" Kim responded, \"All of the above, hopefully.\" Awwww.\n\nJuly 11, 2022: Kim posts adorable couple pics + Pete makes a cameo in The Kardashians season 2 teaser\n\nIt's a busy day for Pete and Kim who have decided it's time to give us all of the sweetest (and steamiest) moments of their relationship — and we are so here for it!\n\nFor starters, the first promo for The Kardashians season two dropped, and IMHO, the most important tidbit was the last couple of seconds of the clip. After Kim asks if he wants to shower with her, Pete is seen tossing his phone and scurrying after her into the bathroom. Watch the full snippet here to see what steamy Kete moments we may be in for when the season premieres on September 22.\n\nDeciding that blessing us with that hot clip was not enough, Kim took to Instagram to show off a set of new shots featuring — you guessed it — her and Pete. The pics, seemingly taken while the two are just chillaxing around the house, also reveal Pete's possible new tattoo on his right shoulder with the words \"Jasmine\" and \"Aladdin,\" referencing the SNL sketch the two starred in together. Above that tattoo, you can see the letters \"NSCP,\" which are the initials of Kim's children North, Saint, Chicago, and Psalm, who she shares with ex-husband, Kanye West.\n\nJune 13, 2022: Kim shares the cutest pics from a tropical vacay with Pete\n\nKim Kardashian and Pete Davidson are getting pretty hot. The Skims mogul shared pictures of a recent beachside baecation with her boyfriend, and the views are out of this world. Along with sporting bleach blonde locks, the duo served major couple's goals with matching black swimwear. Kim shared nine pictures and one video in a carousel post on Instagram. Some of the swoon-worthy shots include a selfie Pete took of Kim's feet as they kayaked on crystal clear water and a shot of them standing in the water, sharing an adorable smooch.\n\nJune 5, 2022: Pete holds hands with Saint West during trip to The Cheesecake Factory\n\nThings are continuing to grow between Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson. The comedian was spotted holding hands with Kim's six-year-old son Saint West while they shopped at The Grove in Los Angeles, and walked into The Cheesecake Factory in pics obtained by TMZ. According to the outlet, neither Kim nor the rest of her other children were spotted during Pete and Saint's apparent playdate at The Grove.\n\nJune 2, 2022: Megan Fox initially told Pete it was \"never gonna happen\" when he asked for Kim's number\n\nICYMI, rumors of Kim and Pete's romance started circulating after her Saturday Night Live appearance in October 2021. But turns out, their relationship could have started months (!!) earlier.\n\nDuring episode 8 of The Kardashians, it was revealed that Pete initially asked Megan Fox for Kim's number way before she hosted SNL — but Megan wasn't having it.\n\n\"After we got together and it was like a thing, Megan Fox texted me, and is like, 'Is this s**t for real because... he asked me for your number months ago,'\" Kim said in a confessional. \"And like, 'I was like, Dude, you have a better shot of, like, me and MGK getting eaten by crocodiles than you ever getting her number. Like, never gonna happen. Do not ask us.'\"\n\nOuch, Megan.\n\nKim also shared what, um, quality initially attracted her to Pete, and how she made the first move in their relationship.\n\n\"I did SNL, and then when we kissed in scene, it was just a vibe. And I was like, 'Oh shit, maybe— maybe I just need to try something different.' But Pete does not come to my afterparty,\" she said. \"Everyone was at my afterparty. Does not give me the time of day. So, a few days later, I called the producer at SNL, and I was like, 'Hey, do you have Pete's number?'\"\n\n\"And I text him. I wasn't even thinking like, 'Oh my god, I'm gonna be in a relationship with him.' I was just thinking like, 'Heard about this BDE. Need to get out there.' Like I need to just, like... jumpstart my — I was just basically DTF,\" she continued. But that's not all. The SKIMS mogul also expressed how \"genuine\" Pete is, and that he's the \"best human being\" she's ever met.\n\nMay 27, 2022: Pete debuts bleached hair that matches Kim's look\n\nThe comedian made his first public appearance since signing off Saturday Night Live on May 21 when the former cast member was seen outside an office in Calabasas, wearing a shower cap covering freshly dyed platinum blond hair according to E! News.\n\nTo further, uh, accentuate his new look, the couple took to IG to commemorate the twinning moment in a series of stories that thankfully fan pages @kkwwrld and @ketekardashian saved so we can remember this moment forever (or at least until they do something else that's as equally adorable).\n\nMay 21, 2022: Kim subtly supports Pete for his final night on Saturday Night Live\n\nThe past few days have been major for the Kar-Jenners and those close to them. On Sunday, May 22, Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker tied the knot (for the third time) in Portofino, Italy. Kim and her daughter North West attended the extravagant affair, but Pete had an obligation back in New York that kept him from celebrating with the fam on the Italian Riviera — Saturday, May 21 marked his final appearance on Saturday Night Live. The comedian was a cast member on the legendary sketch show for eight years.\n\nAlthough the couple couldn't be with each other for these big moments, Kim had a sweet, subtle way of keeping her BF close to her heart. On Instagram, the reality star uploaded a photo of her hot-pink manicure, which featured a small bedazzled \"P\" on one of her nails.\n\n\"Okay this is adorable,\" one user commented while another wrote, \"We stan a loving gf ❤️❤️❤️.\" On her Instagram Story, Kim reposted a collage of Pete's SNL appearances, which was created by user @ketekardashian. So cute. 💖\n\nMay 2, 2022: Pete and Kim make their Met Gala debut\n\nPete and Kim officially made their debut on the steps of the Met. A freshly platinum blonde Kim pulled up in Marilyn Monroe's iconic custom-made Jean Louis dress, which is covered in crystals and reportedly valued at around USD $5 million. The American icon originally wore the dress to sing \"Happy Birthday\" to President John F. Kennedy in 1962.\n\n\"I had this idea to put it on and try it on. They came with armed guards and gloves. I tried it on and it didn't fit me,\" Kim told Vogue correspondent Lala Anthony before she revealed that she lost 16 (!) pounds in three weeks to fit into the dress for the evening.\n\n\"[Kim] didn't let me wear my propeller hat, but it's fine,\" Pete, who wore a classic black suit, joked. Kim then dished that she skipped carbs and sugar for weeks in preparation for fashion's biggest night — adding that the couple is going to celebrate with pizza and donuts back at their hotel.\n\nAfter the Met Gala, she posted Instagram stories showing fans her favorite \"carbs\" in New York City: Joe's Pizza and Doughnuttery donuts. \"So, after the Met, I am starving,\" she said in the clip. \"And my favorite donuts in the entire world, in New York City, are these mini donuts. Oh my gosh, you guys. I have them in the room. How cute is this?\"\n\nShe panned her phone over to several boxes of large pizzas and showed off the pies. \"You guys, I haven't had carbs or sugar in almost a month,\" she explained. \"Definitely three weeks. This pizza — I'm so excited!\"\n\nApril 30, 2022: Pete seemingly inked Kim and her Kids' initials on his neck\n\nBack in March, Kim K revealed that Pete dedicated \"a few\" new tattoos to her, including one *branding* of her name. Now, it seems that the Saturday Night Live comedian inked another homage to his GF on his neck.\n\nIn a series of photos posted on social media, Pete was spotted leaving the Fonda Theater in Los Angeles, and just above his t-shirt collar, he appeared to have a new tat that read \"KNSCP.\" Fans immediately connected the ink to the reality star and her four children with ex-husband Kanye West, theorizing that the initials stand for Kim, North, Saint, Chicago, and Psalm. But neither Kim or Pete have confirmed that that's true, so for now, the meaning behind the tattoo is pure speculation.\n\nBeyond the tattoo guesswork, this past weekend proved to be a headline-making one for the couple. On Saturday, April 30, Kim and Pete made their red carpet debut at the annual White House Correspondents' Dinner in Washington, D.C. Kim stunned in a glistening silver Balenciaga gown and Lorraine Schwartz jewels, while Pete rocked a black Prada suit and Vans. Kim documented the evening, and her and Pete's sweet chemistry, in a carousel of snaps on Instagram.\n\nApril 24, 2022: Kim and Pete attend the 23rd Annual Mark Twain Prize For American Humor in Washington, D.C.\n\nSpotted! Our favorite couple just made a rare appearance at the 23rd Annual Mark Twain Prize For American Humor in Washington, D.C., which makes this Kete's second official event appearance together.\n\nApril 13, 2022: Kim hints at wanting kids with Pete\n\nKim played a question game with the rest of the Kar-Jenner clan during an interview with Access Hollywood. When the A-List family was asked which of them will have six kids, like their mom, Kris Jenner, everyone brought up a photo of Kourtney as their final answer. However, Kim also held up a photo of herself. When asked if Pete was going to be here \"for a long time or a good time,\" Kim said, \"All of the above, hopefully.\"\n\nApril 12, 2022: Kim reveals she \"wasn't planning on\" being in a relationship with Pete\n\nKim made an appearance on and revealed that she was single for 10 months before she was ready to hit the dating scene again.\n\n\"I think that, you know, sometimes things happen when you just least expect it. [Dating] was the last thing that I was really planning on,\" she said, \"And so when it did happen, we were kind of, like, 'Oh, my God, I wasn't planning on this. And this isn't even what I was thinking of,' and it just makes it that much sweeter and so much more fun.\"\n\n\"I definitely took my time. I took, you know, 10 months or something before I dated or talked to anyone. And I just wanted that time to really figure out and go through the motions: 'Am I making the right decision? How do I feel about this?'\" Kim continued. \"So once I went through all of the motions, I finally was, like, 'OK, guys, I am so ready to meet someone.' And I randomly did.\"\n\nAlthough #Kete is all anyone can talk about these days, the reality star and beauty mogul admitted that she's keeping certain aspects of her relationship private. \"I do think that I am holding, you know, a little bit more close to my heart on certain aspects of my relationship with Pete, and it feels good just to know that, like, we have this connection and we have our little bubble of a relationship world that we live in that, like, not a lot of people know about,\" she said.\n\nApril 11, 2022: Kim shares romantic date night pics on Instagram\n\nRemember how the pair was seen together at The Kardashians premiere? Well, their evening didn't stop there. Kardashian posted two steamy, PDA-packed pictures to Instagram on April 11. We see them embracing in the corner booth at popular L.A. Italian restaurant Jon & Vinny's. The flirtatious photos were captioned \"late nite snack.\"\n\nKourtney Kardashian, Travis Barker, Jonathan Cheban, and Tracy and Roy Romulus also joined the pair for this dinner.\n\nApril 7, 2022: Kim and Pete attend Hulu's The Kardashians premiere together\n\nDavidson has shown that he's a super caring BF, and it looks like that support extends to the couple's milestones. While Pete and Kim did not walk the red carpet together at The Kardashians premiere, Kim did tell E! News that \"He's here to support me. It's my thing. I don't think it's his thing to be all up here with me. So, I'm just so happy he's here.\"\n\nIn a March Variety interview, Kim revealed that while Pete will not be appearing in season one of The Kardashians, the couple is open to sharing their love story on reality TV in the future. \"I have not filmed with him,” Kim said, “and I’m not opposed to it. It’s just not what he does. But if there was an event happening and he was there, he wouldn’t tell the cameras to get away.”\n\nFingers crossed we will get to see the blossoming romance in season two!\n\nApril 5, 2022: Kim and her family talk about her relationship with Pete\n\nKim Kardashian is \"at peace\" with her new boyfriend. During an interview with Robin Roberts for Good Morning America, Kim gushed about her new relationship and revealed her intentions. \"I am a relationship kind of girl, for sure, and I wouldn't be with someone if I didn't plan on spending a lot of my time with them,\" the SKIMS mogul revealed. \"Obviously, I want to take my time, but I'm very happy and very content. And, it's such a good feeling to be at peace.\"\n\nKim's mother, Kris Jenner, and sister Khloé Kardashian joined in, sharing their thoughts on the lovebirds. \"Pete's great, Pete's great,\" Kris said. \"He's a really nice guy.\" Khloé echoed similar sentiments. \"He just makes her laugh and she laughs all the time.\"\n\nApril 4, 2022: Kim meets Pete's grandparents\n\nIf there was ever any doubt, things are continuing to heat up for Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson. Things are so serious between the new couple that Kim has officially met Pete's grandparents. According to TMZ, the SKIMS mogul flew out to New York City to visit her comedian/actor boyfriend while he was filming a new project. Production for the upcoming movie took place near his grandparent's home on Staten Island, so the couple went to visit.\n\nApril 4, 2022: Pete drove Kim's pink golf cart\n\nPete used Kim's hot pink golf cart to deliver pizza and hang out with Scott Disick, proving that he's getting even closer to his girlfriend's friends and family.\n\nMarch 26, 2022: Kim shows off one of the tattoos Pete dedicated to her\n\nKim revealed on The Ellen Show that Pete has a handful of tattoos dedicated to her, including one \"branding\" of her name. One tat in particular is an homage to Kim's burgeoning career in law and simply reads, \"My girl is a lawyer.\" The reality star took to her Instagram Stories to show off the fresh ink, which is positioned right below Pete's neck. The story has since expired, but a number of fan accounts captured the snap.\n\nWhile Kim is not *yet* a lawyer, she passed California's baby bar exam — otherwise known as the First-Year Law Students' Examination in the Golden State — in December 2021 and therefore, is one step closer to becoming Kim Kardashian, Attorney at Law. Suffice to say, we love the support from Pete.\n\nMarch 23, 2022: Pete's mom unknowingly fueled social media rumors\n\nPete Davidson's mom caused quite the stir. On Wednesday, a fan account posted a carousel of paparazzi images of Kim and Pete driving in Los Angeles. One user commented, \"She will be pregnant with his child by the end of the year. ❤️,\" then tagged @amyymarie118 — the Instagram account that reportedly belongs to Pete's mom, Amy Davidson. Although the comment has since been deleted, Amy allegedly replied back, \"Yayyyy!\" But before it disappeared, some eagle-eyed fans captured the exchange in screenshots.\n\nPete has dedicated a couple of new tattoos to Kim, but the couple has never commented on whether or not they'd start a family together.\n\nMarch 19, 2022: Pete appears on Scott Disick's Instagram\n\nPete just became Instagram official with another member of the Kar-Jenner crew: Kourtney's ex, Scott Disick. Pete didn't make the grid, but he did have a surprise cameo at the end of Scott's Instagram Stories. While Kim was in Miami celebrating the launch of her new SKIMS Swim line, the comedian captured a quiet evening spent with Scott. \"Boyz night was wild 🛌 🛌 🛌 🛌,\" he wrote in the video, as the camera panned around the living room and caught Scott and two others snoozing through the 1983 film, \"The King of Comedy.\" At the last second, Pete — the cameraman — reveals himself, sporting a deadpan smirk.\n\nMarch 16, 2022: Kim reveals that Pete has her name branded on his body\n\nIn her latest interview on The Ellen Show, Kim admitted that Pete got some ink dedicated to her — as in, two tattoos. It was first caught by @notskinnybutnotfat on Instagram, but Kim also confirmed that Pete got a third design that's \"actually a branding\" of her name. The difference? Branding doesn't involve ink and leaves a permanent scar from a burn, whereas tattoos can eventually be removed.\n\n\"I think he was like, 'I want something that's there that I can't, you know, get rid of,' cause he's in the process of getting rid of his arm tats and his neck tats,\" Kim said of Pete branding her name. \"So he's like, 'I don't wanna be able to get rid of it or to cover it up, and I just wanted it, like, there as a scar on me.'\" She added that his other tattoos are \"cutesy things,\" like \"My girl is a lawyer.\"\n\nMarch 13, 2022: Text messages between Pete and Kim's ex-husband are leaked\n\nIt was quite the newsworthy weekend for Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson. After going Instagram official on Friday, March 11 (see below), five screenshots of a leaked text conversation between Pete and Kim's ex, Kanye West, emerged. In the alleged exchange, Pete defends his GF Kim and affirms that he is \"done being quiet\" over Kanye's incessant social media posts about their relationship.\n\n\"Yo it's Skete,\" Pete wrote in the first text, per Page Six. ICYMI, \"Skete\" is the nickname Kanye made up for Pete weeks earlier. \"Can you please take a second and calm down... It's 8am and it don't gotta be like this. Kim is literally the best mother I've ever met. What she does for those kids is amazing and you are so f***ing lucky that she's your kids mom. I've decided I'm not gonna let you treat us this way anymore and I'm done being quiet. Grow the f**k up.\"\n\nWhen Kanye asked Pete where he was, the Saturday Night Live comedian replied: \"In bed with your wife.\" He then followed up with a selfie of himself, laying down and throwing up the peace sign.\n\nIn the following texts, Pete implored Kanye to seek mental health treatment, writing, \"Let me help you man... I struggle with mental stuff too... It's not an easy journey... You don't have to feel this way anymore... There's no shame in having a little help... You'll be so happy and at peace.\" Kanye offered to talk with him at Sunday Service, but Pete urged to meet privately in person, \"man to man.\"\n\nPete continued to explain to Kanye that, despite his many troublesome social media posts and videos, he claims he has stopped Saturday Night Live and other stand-up comedians from poking fun at him and the whole situation.\n\n\"But if you continue to press me like you have for the past 6 months I'm gonna stop being nice,\" Pete concluded. His texts — which were uploaded in a since-deleted Instagram post by SNL writer and Pete's longtime friend Dave Sirus — came after Kanye posted a video on his Instagram account and claimed that Pete was \"antagonizing\" him over text. \"A message from Pete,\" Dave captioned the post, alongside the five screenshots of the text conversation.\n\nAlthough Pete has not commented publicly on the texts, a source close to Kanye confirmed to E! News that the exchange is real.\n\nMarch 11, 2022: Kim and Pete go public on Instagram\n\nThe moment we have ALL been waiting for: Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson are Instagram official. Kim shared a carousel of pictures to her 'gram on Friday, where Pete is featured in two adorable candids. \"Whose car are we gonna take?!,\" she captioned the post.\n\nThis is major news. Within one hour, the post has earned more than 1.9 million likes. Even sis Khloe commented, \"I love this.\" So do we, Khlo.\n\nMarch 9, 2022: Pete won't appear in this season of The Kardashians\n\nThe Kardashians is just over one month away from its premiere date, and in a new interview with Variety, Kim answered the one question that's been on every fan's mind: Will Pete appear in the new Hulu series?\n\n\"I have not filmed with him,\" the reality star told the outlet. \"And I’m not opposed to it. It’s just not what he does. But if there was an event happening and he was there, he wouldn’t tell the cameras to get away. I think I might film something really exciting coming, but it wouldn’t be for this season.\"\n\nSo we won't see Pete on our screens (this season, at least), but viewers will receive answers about how their romance started. Kim revealed that we'll learn \"how we met and who reached out to who and how it happened and all the details that everyone wants to know... I’m definitely open to talking, and I definitely explain it.\"\n\nMarch 3, 2022: Kim supports Pete on Twitter\n\nKim Kardashian just gave a subtle show of support for Pete Davidson. In what might be her most public acknowledgment of their romance so far, Kim liked a Tweet from actor James Gunn that praises Pete as one of the \"nicest, sweetest guys.\"\n\nInstagram account \"Comments By Celebs\" captured the like from the reality star and mogul. The tweet and Kim's support arrives after her ex, Kanye West, shared a grim music video for his new song \"Eazy,\" in which he kidnaps and buries a claymation version of Pete.\n\nMarch 2, 2022: Pete rejoins and quickly deactivates his Instagram\n\nPete's social media activity has us going in circles. ICYMI, Pete rejoined Instagram in mid-February, but de-activated his account just one week later. The comedian didn't cite a specific reason for his brief tenure on the app, although a source revealed to Page Six that when he started receiving a ton of DMs, he was reminded \"why he didn’t want social media to begin with.\"\n\nBut once again, Pete has ghosted Instagram. Per Page Six, one fan account captured his return on Wednesday, March 2, but within two hours, users commented that he had already exited the app.\n\nPete's short stay on social media occurred the same day that Kim was legally declared single by a Los Angeles court — it also came after Kim's ex-husband, Kanye West, shared a music video for his song \"Eazy,\" in which it appears he kidnaps and buries an animated Pete. \"Everyone lived happily ever after,\" the video reads at the end. \"Except Skete you know who / JK he's fine.\" (Kanye has been calling Pete \"Skete\" over the past couple weeks.) However, there's no confirmation that Pete's return to social media had any correlation to Kim's legal win, or Kanye's music video.\n\nFebruary 23, 2022: Pete deactivates his Instagram\n\nOne week after Pete rejoined Instagram, he deactivated his account. The Saturday Night Live comedian uploaded his first post on Wednesday, February 23, which featured a short clip from his upcoming horror-thriller film, The Home. \"They're letting me add my own dialogue to The Home #welcometomyinstagram #thisisthetypeofstuffyoucanbeexpecting,\" Pete captioned the video, which quickly flooded with comments. But just hours later, his millions of followers noticed that the post was gone and his account appeared to be deleted.\n\nFans initially believed that Pete left the social media app because of Kim's ex, Kanye West. Over the past few weeks, Kanye has been consistently posting about Kim and Pete's relationship. But according to Page Six, that is not the case. \"Pete deleted his IG because immediately after his first post, he started receiving a flood of messages, both positive and negative, reminding him why he didn’t want social media to begin with,\" a source close to Pete said.\n\n\"[Pete] is in the middle of several big film projects and wants to continue to stay very focused on his work and the positive things happening in his life,\" they continued. \"Kanye didn’t drive Pete off social media.\"\n\nFebruary 16, 2022: Pete joins Instagram\n\nPete has officially reactivated his Instagram account. According to Page Six, this is the fourth time the comedian has rejoined the social media app. The first time he exited the site was in the summer of 2018, citing the negative impact it had on his mental health. \"I just don't wanna be on Instagram anymore. Or on any social media platform. The internet is an evil place and it doesn’t make me feel good,\" he told CNN at the time. He eventually rejoined, but left again in December 2018.\n\nBut on Wednesday, Pete rebooted the verified account under the handle @pmd and hasn't uploaded any posts so far. He only follows girlfriend Kim Kardashian and actor Sebastian Stan, but he's amassed nearly 1 million followers — which includes Kim's ex-husband, Kanye West.\n\nThe timing of Pete's return has fans confused, as for the past couple weeks, Kanye has been constantly posting about Kim and Pete's romance. However, the Saturday Night Live star has not commented on the reasoning behind his latest arrival to the platform.\n\nFebruary 8, 2022: Pete accidentally shares a candle he got in honor of his gf\n\nPete Davidson unknowingly shared a household item inspired by his \"girlfriend\" Kim Kardashian while giving People (The TV Show!) a tour of his bedroom. Host Kay Adams asked the comedian about a candle that appeared to resemble the reality star in his background. Pete blushed and answered, \"Yes, it! That is exactly what that is.\"\n\nAlong with officially calling Kim his girlfriend for the first time, Pete opened up about his plans for Valentine's Day. \"I don't think I've ever had a Valentine's Day thing, really,\" he said. \"So this would be the first year that I'm thinking about Valentine's Day plans, I guess.\"\n\nAwwwww!\n\nFebruary 7, 2022: Pete officially calls Kim is \"girlfriend\"\n\nThings between Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson are official. The Saturday Night Live comedian spilled the beans on their relationship status during an interview with People (The TV Show!).
