        "text": "On the latest episode of SiriusXM's This Life of Mine with James Corden, Kim Kardashian was asked about the potential for marriage in her future. Kardashian has just revealed she is exclusively dating Odell Beckham Jr. She has also been married three times, to Damon Thomas for four year, Kris Humphries for two years, and Kanye West for eight. She shares four children with West, 10-year-old North, eight-year-old Saint-six-year-old Chicago, and four-year-old Psalm.\n\nThe SKIMS founder is already managing a big family and a business empire, as well as starring on her hit Hulu show The Kardashians. Her answer indicated that marriage might not be another thing she wants to tackle right now.\n\n“I don't know. I really don't,” she responded. “There'll be moods where I'm just like, ‘You know what? I understand my life is really big and I understand it takes a really, really, really special, unique person to want to deal with that.’ I think my life is really fun and whoever comes in my life will have a really good time, but it's a lot.“\n\nShe went on, “I'm not lonely, so I'm good. I have my kids, I have work, I have my family, but it would be nice to share your life with someone. But when you do, it's such a big [deal], I don't take that lightly.”\n\nShe added that she doesn't feel she needs to be married to another famous person, but “they would just have to really somehow understand what this life is.”\n\nKardashian did admit that she is “the biggest hopeless romantic,” but that she has some conditions for a relationship. She went on to say she is “not so delusional to know that someone will check every single box,” before reading from her list. It's in her Notes app.\n\n“Accountable for actions. Takes accountability. Good teeth. Can hold their own. I don't have to babysit all the time,” she said. “I mean, just a good, genuine person that's driven and has their own motivations in life. The list is so long.”"
