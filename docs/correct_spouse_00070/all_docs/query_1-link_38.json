        "text": "Kim Kardashian is known for having high-profile relationships. After her six-year marriage to Kanye West and her short-lived romance with Pete Davidson, the reality star and mogul has decided to keep the deets about her latest relationship under wraps. However, she has been dropping hints on her hit Hulu series The Kardashians about a new prospect that she's interested in.\n\nThe Skims founder shied away from confirming her mystery man's name and other clues that could help viewers identify him, but she has shared bits and pieces about their time together. You're probably wondering who Kim could be dating now, and trust me, you're not alone. Here's everything we know about Kim Kardashian's mystery man, Fred.\n\nKim's friends set her up with Fred\n\nKim first dished about Fred in a promo trailer for the third episode of The Kardashians. \"My friends wanted me to meet someone,\" she told her close family friend and sister's ex-boyfriend, Scott Disick. \"Let's call this guy 'Fred,'\" Scott said. \"Does he meet the standards?\" Kim replied, \"Oh, so meets the standards,\" according to Page Six. As the clip progressed, Kim was spotted smiling and texting during a confessional shoot. A producer asked if she was messaging Fred, and Kim said, \"Yep.\"\n\nFred and Kim had a date at a secret restaurant she previously went to with Pete\n\nDuring episode three, Kim dished to Scott about flying out to New York to meet Fred. \"I don’t want to just date one person, but I’ve never dated… what’s so funny is my friends wanted me to meet someone, so we go to New York, and we go to *bleeped*,\" she said, per Page Six. \"That’s like my spot because there’s a private room downstairs, but then on the internet, it was like, ‘Kim reconnects with Pete at this place.'\"\n\nAccording to the reality star, they met at a restaurant with a private room that she had previously been to with Pete. \"It was the place I would go and have my secret dinners with Pete, and he's probably like, I know what she's up to,\" she said.\n\nKim wants to sneak around with Fred because of her relationship with Pete"
