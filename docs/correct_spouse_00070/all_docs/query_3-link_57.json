        "text": "New court documents reveal that Kim Kardashian has taken a big step towards officially ending her marriage to estranged husband Kanye West.\n\nThe reality star filed papers with the court last week requesting to be made legally single after first filing for divorce back in February, requesting that they deal with matters of child custody and property division separately from their marital status. The filing, obtained by People, claims that, “[Kardashian] has been attempting to settle this manner since she filed her Petition for Dissolution of Marriage in February 2021. [Kardashian] and her counsel have reached out to [West] and his counsel several times in an attempt to move this case forward to a speedy and amicable resolution. [West] has been non-responsive.” Kardashian’s requests came to light just days after West pleaded for her to come back to him during the Free Larry Hoover concert he mounted with Drake last week.\n\nThe documents go on to state that, “The parties' marriage has irremediably broken down. [Kardashian] no longer desires to be married to [West]. There are simply no compelling reasons not to grant a motion to bifurcate and terminate marital status in this case.” The Skims founder's filing further underscores that, “There is no question that the marriage of the parties is no longer viable. [Kardashian] has no desire to reconcile with [West] and wants their marriage terminated. Irreconcilable differences have led to the irremediable breakdown of the marriage, and there is no possibility of saving the marriage through counseling or other means. The continued maintenance of technical marital status between [West] and [Kardashian] serves no useful purpose, and there is no reason to maintain the legal relationship.”\n\nKardashian adds, “Irreconcilable differences have existed and continue to exist between [West] and me, which have caused our marriage to irretrievably break down. No counseling or reconciliation effort will be of any value at this time. [West] and I both deserve the opportunity to build new lives. Therefore, I am asking that my request to bifurcate and terminate our marital status be granted.”\n\nAccording to TMZ, Kardashian also requested that her maiden name be restored. The outlet also reports that the filing came on December 9, just hours after the rapper now legally known as Ye performed “Runaway” during the Free Larry Hoover concert with Drake at the L.A. Memorial Coliseum. At the end of the song, West ad-libbed for a bit, singing, “Run back to me...more specifically, Kimberly.” West has yet to respond to his estranged wife's most recent court filing, but in an interview on Revolt TV’s “Drink Champs” podcast recorded in October, he insisted that Kardashian was “still” his wife, adding, \"I ain’t never even seen the papers, we’re not even divorced.”\n\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair\n\n— The Second Coming of Guru Jagat\n\n— Billie Eilish Sits for the Same Interview for the Fifth Year\n\n— How Did Princess Charlene’s Illness Become an International Mystery?\n\n— Ghislaine Maxwell’s Trial: A Fresh Look at Epstein’s M.O.\n\n— The Best Gifts for Women to Give and Receive This Holiday Season\n\n— The Internet’s Take on Donald Trump Jr. vs. LeBron James\n\n— 72 Hours Inside the Spend-athon at Art Basel Miami Beach\n\n— The Renaissance of Claire’s Y2K Beauty Aesthetic Is Here\n\n— From the Archive: The Paradoxical Life and Death of Robert Maxwell\n\n— Sign up for “The Buyline” to receive a curated list of fashion, books, and beauty buys in one weekly newsletter.\n\nTelevision\n\nHouse of the Dragon’s Ser Simon Strong Is “The Only Gentleman in an Ungentlemanly World”\n\nAs violence abounds in Westeros, Rhaenyra arranges a secret meeting with Alicent and tries to broker some kind of peace.
