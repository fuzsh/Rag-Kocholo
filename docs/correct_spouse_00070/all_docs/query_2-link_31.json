        "text": "Odell Beckham Jr\n\nAs of September 2023, Kim Kardashian was reportedly 'hanging out' with 31-year-old football player Odell Beckham Jr.\n\nBeckham Jr allegedly split from longtime girlfriend Lauren Wood, who has a 1-year-old son named Zydn with the model.\n\nIn March 2024, sources claim that the pair have parted ways, and are \"Not seeing each other anymore right now.\"\n\nThis shock announcement comes just weeks after the pair were papped looking cosy at an Academy Awards after party earlier in March.\n\nA source tells ET, \"Kim and Odell have been doing their own things lately. Kim is so busy and hasn't been putting any pressure on herself to be committed to anyone or in a serious relationship. She is all about being a hands-on mom.\"\n\nThe source adds, \"Kim and Odell have always been open and honest about their future, whether that be together or separate. They had a good thing and there aren't any hard feelings on either side. They started as friends and still are. They will continue to be respectful of each other's spaces, careers, families, and friends.\"\n\nTom Brady\n\nKim Kardashian has a new rumoured flame - NFL player Tom Brady, who recently divorced supermodel Gisele Bündchen.\n\nFans started speculating on the news after the reality star has been looking at properties in Baker’s Bay Golf & Ocean Club in the Bahamas, and sought out advice from Brady.\n\nA source told Page Six that: \"Kim and Tom are friendly. She phoned him and asked him for his advice on Baker’s Bay.\"\n\nAnother insider added that Kim is \"very familiar\" in the community and has \"been eyeing property there for quite some time.\"\n\nHowever, the source mentioned that there is currently \"no romance\" between the two of them, and that they are \"friendly.\"\n\nNow it seems Tom and Kim have been getting closer after an insider dished the details during billionaire Michael Rubin's lavish fourth of July party.\n\n\"Kim and Tom were super flirty with each other at Rubin's party and were seen during the day on the beach together and again dancing at night,\" the source told DailyMail.com.\n\nThey added that Tom is \"exactly her type.\"\n\nPete Davidson\n\nKim Kardashian sparked surprise dating rumours with comedian Pete Davidson after her acclaimed hosting debut on SNL in October 2021.\n\nThe pair shared a kiss on screen during one of the skits on the show, with Kim dressed as Princess Jasmine and Pete as Aladdin.\n\nThey confirmed their relationship in November 2021 after they were spotted holding hands after celebrating Pete's 28th birthday.\n\nIn March of this year, Pete and Kim became Instagram official and tattooed her name on his chest.\n\nThe duo attended the Met Gala together in May and were inseparable until Pete moved to Australia to shoot a new film.\n\nAlthough Kim made a whirlwind visit to the country, it appears that long-distance and the pressures of a relationship lost their 'spark', and the pair have now separated.\n\nSince the pair split in August 2022, they appear to be amicable, and were pictured chatting at the 2023 Met Gala alongside Usher.\n\nPete Davidson has now removed his tattoos dedicated to ex Kim, and has moved on with his Bodies Bodies Bodies co-star, Chase Sui Wonders.\n\nJamie Reuben\n\nKim Kardashian was spotted out on Saturday night (May 22) as she attended the party of London billionaire Jamie Reuben in Beverly Hills.\n\nThe 40-year-old star – who filed for divorce from Kanye West in February after six years of marriage – is enjoying her newly single life.\n\nThe Keeping Up With The Kardashians star wore a tiny crop top and slashed skirt while she was pictured alongside her friend Fai Khadra.\n\nThe nature of Kim and Jamie's relationship is unknown, but that hasn't stopped fans from thinking there may be a romantic connection.\n\nThe pair share a mutual friend, music mogul Scooter Braun.\n\nVan Jones\n\nAfter rumours surfaced of her alleged divorce from Kanye, Kim was quickly linked to CNN reporter Van Jones, 52, as fans scrambled to guess who she would date post-Yeezy.\n\nJones, whose real name is Anthony Kapel Jones, was spotted with Kim at the Criminal Justice Reform Summit in 2018, and the photos soon began spreading between fans online.\n\nSo far, it looks like the rumour is just that - a rumour.\n\nIn May 2021, Jones mused that Kim will make an \"unbelievable attorney\". During an appearance on The Ellen Show, he said, \"She’s already I think one of the best advocates that we have in criminal justice.\"\n\n\"I think she has used her platform to help people behind bars,\" he added, before noting that the reality star is following in the footsteps of her father, Robert Kardashian.\n\n\"Her dad was a lawyer and she always wanted to be a lawyer and so she decided, once she got a taste of what she can do using her platform, using her brain, she hasn’t let up,\" he said.\n\nKim addressed the rumours during the Keeping Up With The Kardashians reunion show, insisting that the pair are just friends.\n\n\"Van texted me and was like, \"This rumour has gotten me so many dates and I'm so grateful, So I owe you,\"\" she said, before addressing the speculation that she was dating singer Maluma.\n\n\"I'm not dating either one. Not Van Jones, not Maluma,\" Kim stated. \"I've known [Maluma]. I've seen him a few times, always in Miami. Such a nice guy.\"\n\nKanye West\n\nIn 2012, Kim began dating longtime friend Kanye West while still legally married to NBA player Kris Humphries, and the rest is history.\n\nA year later, West proposed to Kim inside a baseball stadium in San Francisco, and the pair married at Fort di Belvedere in Florence, Italy in 2014.\n\nKim and Kanye have four children; daughter North (born June 15, 2013), son Saint (born December 5, 2015), daughter Chicago (born January 15, 2018), and son Psalm (born May 9, 2019).\n\nThey share a mansion in Calabasas, California worth around $60 million, as well as various other properties including West's $14 million ranch in Wyoming.\n\nKim and Kanye have faced their fair share of divorce rumours dating back to 2016 amid Kanye's public mental health battle.\n\nHowever, it's been reported that Kim has hired celebrity divorce lawyer Laura Wasser to get the wheels in motion.\n\nKris Humphries\n\nIn October 2010, Kim began dating NBA player Kris Humphries, who was playing for the New Jersey Jets at the time. Seven months later, the pair were engaged.\n\nTheir whirlwind wedding was the centre of a two-part television special and reportedly cost around $10 million. However, after just 72 days of marriage, Kim filed for divorce from Humphries, citing irreconcilable differences.\n\nThe divorce resulted in media uproar as the wedding was widely hailed a 'cash grab' and merely a publicity stunt to generate money.\n\nDespite this, Kris later confirmed that the relationship was \"100% real\". Kim also revealed that she rushed her marriage to Kris after panicking about turning 30.\n\nThe divorce was finalised in June 2013.\n\nReggie Bush\n\nKim dated NFL player Reggie Bush from 2007 to 2010, her first relationship documented on Keeping Up With The Kardashians.\n\nThe couple briefly split in 2009, but later reconciled before finally breaking up a year later.\n\nSome sources claim Bush was overwhelmed by Kardashian's growing fame, while others put it down to their conflicting schedules.\n\nNick Cannon\n\nAfter her three-year relationship with Ray J broke down, Kim began dating rapper and television host Nick Cannon in late 2006.\n\nKim was still working as socialite Paris Hilton's assistant at the time, while Cannon was becoming a television mainstay with his new show Wild ‘N Out.\n\nThey split in January 2007, one month before Kim's infamous sex tape with Ray J leaked. Years after their split, Cannon explained how their relationship broke down after she lied to him about the existence of the tape.\n\n\"She’s actually one of the nicest people you’ll ever meet. But the fact that she lied and told me that there was no tape? And I still think she might have even had a part to play with [its release],\" he said.\n\nDamon Thomas\n\nIn 2000, 19-year-old Kim eloped with music producer Damon Thomas, who was ten years her senior.\n\nShe has since revealed she was high on ecstasy during the ceremony.\n\nThomas filed for divorce three years later, with Kardashian later blaming their split on his alleged abusive behaviour, which Thomas denies.\n\nReports claim Damon was \"extremely controlling\", with Kim once revealing, \"Damon decided what we would do and when we would do it. He was very much the king of the castle.\"\n\nHe allegedly controlled who she spoke to, demanded to know where she was, and even encouraged her to get plastic surgery. He also reportedly became physically abusive and tried to drive a wedge between Kim and her sisters."
