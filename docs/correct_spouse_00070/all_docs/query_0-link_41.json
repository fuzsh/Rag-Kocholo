        "text": "As Kris Humphries looks back at his 13-year career in the NBA following his retirement announcement on Tuesday, there's one memory that will stay top of mind: getting booed by the crowd during a basketball game after he and then-wife Kim Kardashian announced their divorce.\n\nBecause when they announced their split back in 2011, the couple were only married for 72 days.\n\n\"I was playing at Madison Square Garden for the first time after my marriage ended, and I was getting booed so loud that it was crazy,\" Humphries wrote in a personal essay for The Players' Tribune. \"I'm talking feel-it-in-your-bones booed. I wasn't Kris Humphries any more. I wasn't a real person. I was That Guy.\"\n\nAnd by \"that guy\" Humphries meant the one suspected of marrying the reality star for fame. Many critics questioned his motives, many questioned their marriage. And despite everything that was said about him, Humphries maintained his silence. Until now.\n\n\"I met a girl who happened to be really famous, and I got married, and.…. Damn,\" he wrote. \"Look, I should have known what I was getting into. I was definitely naive about how much my life was going to change. But the one thing that really bothers me is whenever people say that my marriage was fake.\n\n\"There's definitely a lot about that world that is not entirely real,\" he admitted about his time with Kardashian, who's a big star thanks to her reality show Keeping Up With the Kardashians. \"But our actual relationship was 100% real. When it was clear that it wasn't working… what can I say? It sucked. It's never easy to go through the embarrassment of something like that -- with your friends, with your family… But when it plays out so publicly, in front of the world, it's a whole other level. It was brutal.\"\n\nAfter his marriage breakdown and the ensuing backlash, Humphries said he \"was in a dark place\" for about an entire year. He experienced \"a lot of anxiety\" and found it difficult socialising with other people.\n\n\"I didn't want to leave my home. You feel like… I don't know … the whole world hates you, but they don't even know why. They don't even know you at all. They just recognise your face, and they're on you,\" he wrote. \"I didn't want to be Kris Humphries. It's the craziest feeling in the world, not wanting to be yourself. And I didn't even want to say anything to defend myself, because it felt like I couldn't win.\n\n\"I know that most people will always see me as That F---ing Guy from TV. And I get it. I signed up for it. I don't want any pity at all,\" he concluded. \"I was never a person who wanted to be famous. I'm a guy from Minnesota who loves the game of basketball. And yeah, 99 times out of 100, when people come up to me, it's still 'Bro, are you that dude?'\n\n\"But one out of 100, someone will come up to me and say something like, 'Hey, all the bulls--- aside, I watched those [Brooklyn] Nets teams, and you really played hard, man.'\""
