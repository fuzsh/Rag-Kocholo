        "text": "Kim Kardashian has decided to drop her business commitments in Australia due to a deluge of media inquiries about her divorce filing on Monday.\n\nPHOTOS: 19 of Hollywood’s All-Time Shortest Marriages\n\nThe reality star and fashion entrepreneur who just launched her new Kardashian Kollection handbag line Down Under on Wednesday is now fleeing the country amid the controversy of her divorce filing from husband of 72 days, basketball player Kris Humphries.\n\n“She has abandoned her commitments to sponsors, which should have seen her appear at the races as part of the Melbourne Cup Carnival on Saturday,” Sandy Kaye, who was to interview Kardashian on Saturday for the current affairs show, Today Tonight, tells The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nPHOTOS: Inside Kardashian Inc.\n\n“Vitamin company, Swisse, had already paid her $250,000 for an hour’s appearance,” she continues. “She was also supposed to greet 50,000 fans at a shopping mall to promote the weight loss system, Quick Trim. Needless to say, sponsors are livid.”\n\nKardashian did attend the launch party for the handbag line and at least one radio interview while she was abroad, but she stands to lose a lot of fans in the country with this sudden change in her itinerary.\n\nPHOTOS: Hollywood’s Top Earners\n\n“Australia is disgusted with her behavior,” Kaye tells THR.\n\nShe is scheduled to depart Sydney on a flight to Los Angeles on Friday morning. Sister Khloe Kardashian and her husband, Lamar Odom, who accompanied her on the trip, are reported to be leaving with her, as well.\n\nCOVER STORY: How the Kardashians Made $65 Million Last Year\n\nThe star filed for divorce on Monday and left for Australia that evening. On Tuesday, she released a statement combating reports that her marriage was a hoax and saying she married for love. In the same statement, she admits she should have ended the relationship, but she was caught up in the “hoopla” of the wedding, the TV show, and didn’t want to disappoint everyone involved."
