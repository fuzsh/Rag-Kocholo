        "text": "Kim Kardashian says that social media posts made by her husband, Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, have caused emotional distress, according to new court documents.\n\nIn the documents filed on Wednesday and obtained by NBC, Kardashian, 41, asked the judge to sign off on her divorce with Ye, 44, so that she can “begin the healing process” and “move forward”.\n\n“I very much desire to be divorced,” wrote Kardashian, adding that Ye has failed to keep the divorce proceedings between the two private. “Kanye has been putting a lot of misinformation regarding our private family matters and co-parenting on social media which has created emotional distress.”\n\nKardashian further noted that a termination of her and Ye’s marital status could help him “accept that our marital relationship is over and to move forward on a better path which will assist us in peacefully co-parenting our children”.\n\nThe two have four children: North, Saint, Chicago and Psalm.\n\nKardashian previously filed for divorce in February 2021 after the two had been married for seven years.\n\nIn December, Kardashian requested that she be “legally single”, which would divide the divorce proceedings into two parts: the first would settle her legal name and marital status while the second would determine custody of the couple’s four children.\n\nYe has objected to having the process split.\n\nSince the start of the divorce proceedings, he has made several posts on Instagram about the state of his ex-partner and children, including speaking out against his oldest daughter North’s TikTok account.\n\nIn a post published yesterday, Ye seemingly bragged about Kardashian’s current boyfriend, comedian and actor Pete Davidson, deleting his Instagram account, writing: “Ran Skete off the gram Tell your mother I changed your name for life.”\n\nLast month, Ye apologized for posting screenshots of messages between himself and Kardashian, where Kardashian was worried about Davidson’s safety due to Ye’s post. Ye also acknowledged in the since-deleted apology post that his posting “came off as harassing Kim”."
