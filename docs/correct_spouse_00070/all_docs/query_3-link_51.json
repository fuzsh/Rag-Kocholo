        "text": "KIM Kardashian and her ex-husband Kanye West have figured out their co-parenting relationship three years after their nasty divorce.\n\nThe Hulu star officially filed for divorce from Kanye, 46, in February 2021, with it being finalized nearly two years later in November 2022.\n\nKim, 43, and Ye share children North, 10; Saint, 8; Chicago, 6; and Psalm, 4, from their seven-year marriage.\n\nCo-parenting didn't come easy for the exes but a source told The U.S. Sun the pair have managed to work through their differences.\n\nSHOWING SUPPORT\n\nLast week, the Skims founder showed her support for Ye after the Donda rapper released a music video for his latest single off his album, Vultures.\n\nCalled Talking/Once Again, the song and its music video featured the ex-couple's eldest child, North.\n\nThe proud mom shared her daughter's rapping debut on her Instagram Stories with the first caption being one of the lyrics, \"Miss Westie.\"\n\nThe Kardashians star also supported North's introduction into the music industry by using more lyrics, \"Bless me, Miss Westie,\" as a caption for a previous Instagram post.\n\nThe 10-year-old was featured in the first half of the music video.\n\nDuring her cameo, the pre-teen sat in a chair while yelling the lyrics, \"You don't want no problems you just,\" as stylists pulled and brushed her hair into braids.\n\nThe young star looked back and forth in a terrified manner before she erupted into verse.\n\n\"I love it here we gonna take over the year for nothing, yeah. It's your bestie, Miss Miss Westie. Don't tryna test me.\n\n\"It's gonna get messy. It's gonna get messy, yeah just bless me. Bless me. It's your bestie, Miss Miss Westie. Just tryna bless me. Just bless me,\" North rapped.\n\nIn several shots, the little girl whispered in her dad Kanye's ear as he flashed his new titanium smile.\n\nShe also stared directly into the camera while seated on the rapper's shoulders - the duo looked nearly identical to one another.\n\nSTARE DOWN\n\nKim and Kanye still have their ups and downs, however, and the ex-couple's recent stare-down is proof that their co-parenting relationship is a work in progress.\n\nLast month, the former KimYe couple came face-to-face while supporting their son Saint at his basketball game in Los Angeles, California.\n\nPaparazzi captured the A-listers sitting in the same row, but keeping two seats worth of space between them.\n\nNeither of them seemed to be talking to each other when they sat together, instead looking at their respective cellphones any time their eyes weren't on the game.\n\nHowever, the reality TV star seemed to acknowledge Kanye when she arrived at the gym with their daughter Chicago.\n\nKim was pictured having a stare-off with an already-seated Kanye through a black net screen with their daughter beside her.\n\nFAMILY FEUD\n\nKim and Kanye have a long history and the awkward stare-down last month is a much better alternative than the very public social media squabbling the pair previously participated in.\n\nThe Skkn by Kim founder and the rapper went through numerous quarrels, which were captured by the media.\n\nThe two hurled allegations and exposed many private situations, even going far enough to involve their families, friends, and children.\n\nOn Friday, February 4, 2022, Kim and Kanye traded various insults and allegations.\n\nKanye took to his Instagram Stories and accused his ex-wife of duplicitous acts involving their four children.\n\nThe Yeezy founder posted a screenshot from one of North's TikTok videos and tagged Kim in the shot.\n\nThe rapper asked his followers, \"SINCE THIS IS MY FIRST DIVORCE, I NEED TO KNOW: WHAT I SHOULD DO ABOUT MY DAUGHTER BEING PUT ON TIKTOK AGAINST MY WILL ?\"\n\nThe Can't Tell Me Nothing rapper stated, \"America saw you try to kidnap my daughter on her birthday by not providing the address.\n\n\"You put security on me inside of the house to play with my son then accused me of stealing.\"\n\nHe continued, \"I had to take a drug test after Chicago's party 'cause you accused me of being on drugs. Tracy Romulus stop manipulating Kim to be this way….\"\n\nThe same day, Kim responded to Kanye's allegations on the same social media platform.\n\nThe TV personality stated, \"Kanye's constant attacks on me in interviews and on social media is actually more hurtful than any TikTok North might create.\"\n\nShe then added, \"Kanye's obsession with trying to control and manipulate our situation so negatively and publicly is only causing further pain for all.\"\n\nUNINVITED GUEST\n\nIn January 2022, Kanye made it to his daughter Chicago's fourth birthday after claiming Kim \"wouldn't share the party address.\"\n\nThe rapper resorted to Instagram after he said he attempted - but failed - to reach multiple members of the Kardashian family about where they’re celebrating his little girl turning four.\n\nHowever, videos posted by partygoers showed Kanye chatting with his ex-mother-in-law, Kris Jenner, 68\n\nHours earlier, he slammed the momager while driving around Los Angeles and vented about being frustrated he had to go public just to wish his daughter a “happy birthday.”\n\n“Y’all, I’m just wishing my daughter a public happy birthday. I wasn’t allowed to know where her party was.\n\n“It’s nothing legal. These are the kind of games being played.\n\n“This is the kind of thing that has affected my health for the longest and I’m just not playing,” he said in the video obtained by TMZ.\n\nThe fashion mogul stated that he was “taking controI” of his narrative as he claimed, “I’m being the best father - the Ye version of a father - and I’m not fittin’ to let this happen.\"\n\nPEEVED ABOUT PETE\n\nAbout a year after Kim split from Kanye, the American Horror Story actress began dating Saturday Night Live alum, Pete Davidson, 30.\n\nThough dating other people is a natural part of breaking up, Ye made it abundantly clear he was not happy about his ex-wife moving on with the comedian.\n\nHe called Pete a \"d**khead,\" threatened to \"beat his a**\", and accused the actor of trying to \"destroy\" his family in various rants.\n\nIn March 2022, the rapper was banned from Instagram for 24 hours after making violent threats toward Pete.\n\nThe same month, he released two graphic music videos for his song Eazy.\n\nThe first video showed an animated Kanye burying a cartoon version of Pete alive.\n\nA second video depicted a character of Pete getting beaten up by a skinned monkey.\n\nLater that same year, after Kim and Pete broke up, Kanye shared an image of a fake New York Times headline that read, “Skete Davidson dead at 28.”\n\n\"Skete\" is a derogatory nickname that Kanye uses for the Staten Island-born star.\n\nIn September, Kanye continued his long-running beef with the Bupkis actor when he made an out-of-the-blue threat directed at Pete in a sinister Instagram post.\n\n\"Ask Pete how those tattoos of my kids are doing in the trauma unit,\" he posted against a black background.\n\nKanye was referring to the tattoo on Pete's neck that he got when he was dating Kim.\n\nThe tattoo reads \"KNSCP\" - representing the initials of Kim, and her children North, Saint, Chicago, and Psalm.\n\nHARD WORK\n\nIn December of 2022, Kim opened up about co-parenting with Kanye while guesting on the Angie Martinez IRL podcast.\n\nWhile becoming emotional, she admitted to the host, \"Co-parenting is really f**king hard.\"\n\nKim revealed that she does her best to keep her children in the dark about the issues she and their dad have and were going through at the time.\n\n\"If they don't know things that are being said, why would I ever bring that energy to them? That is real, heavy, grownup s**t that they are not ready to deal with.\n\n\"When they are, we will have those conversations. One day, my kids will thank me for not sitting here and bashing their dad,\" she said.\n\nThe Los Angeles native then added, \"I could.\"\n\nKim told Angie that she has \"protected\" Kanye's reputation and she will continue doing so for her kids.\n\n\"So, in my home, my kids don't know anything that goes on [in] the outside world,\" she confessed.\n\nThe former E! star asserted, \"My kids don't know anything,\" before revealing, \"At school, some of my best friends are the teachers, so I know what goes on at recess and lunchtime.\n\n\"I hear what is being talked about.\"\n\nKim also spoke about putting on a strong face for her children as she revealed, \"If we are riding to school, and they want to listen to their dad's music, no matter what we are going through, I have to have that smile on my face and blast his music and sing along with my kids.\n\n\"[I can] act like nothing is wrong and as soon as I drop them off, I can have a good cry.\"\n\nMOVING FORWARD\n\nKanye remarried last year to his current wife Bianca Censori, 29, and Kim is rumored to be dating NFL star, Odell Beckham Jr.\n\nThere still seems to be some animosity between the exes, with both throwing the occasional jab, but overall the pair seem to be in a place both mentally and emotionally where they can do what's best for their children.\n\nEarlier this month, photographs showed Kim and Kanye together with North and her tween friends at Nobu in Malibu with her group wearing oversized shirts promoting Vultures.\n\nAlthough it was reported the group was having a school party, an insider told The U.S. Sun they came from shooting a music video at an office in Calabasas, California.\n\n\"Kim has been very supportive of North being involved with her dad’s new music, and she was totally on board with her shooting a video with him this week,\" they said.\n\n\"Kim even showed up to the filming at his Calabasas office before heading to Nobu with Ye, North, and her little friends who are also in the promo.\n\n\"North had planned it all out with her dad and created her own storyboard, and Kim knows how much she loves being involved in the creative process.\""
