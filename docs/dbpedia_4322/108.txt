Dame Emily Penrose (1858–1942), who served as principal at Bedford College, Royal Holloway College and Somerville College, is the focus of the final film in this series which looks at female pioneers of women's higher education.

In the film Dr Imogen Tedbury looks at Philip Alexius de László's portrait of Penrose as well as uncovering the true identity of the sitter in a portrait previously thought to be of Penrose.
