        "text": "1890: An investment team consisting of American Willie Wilcox and Prussian Count James Pourtales form The Broadmoor Land and Investment Company. The two men intended to create an upper-class suburb near Colorado Springs, centered around a magnificent casino. Wilcox had originally discovered the area when seeking a place to recover from a bout of tuberculosis, and invited Pourtales west help him develop the land. Unfortunately, the two men entered bankruptcy and were forced to sell their casino. Colorado Springs eventually acquired the site, converting it into a private boarding school known as The Broadmoor School for Girls.\n\n1916: Mining magnate Spencer Penrose purchased the erstwhile casino, as well as a small hotel located next door. Penrose also bought the 450 acres of land surrounding both the casino and hotel. Desiring a resort that would transform Colorado Springs into a premier holiday destination, he began to exponentially expand the complex a year later. New York-based architectural firm Warren and Wetmore designed the main structures, while Donald Ross created the location’s first 18-hole golf course. Penrose even recruited Fredrick Law Olmstead Jr. to develop the hotel’s beautiful series of landscaped gardens that still surround the resort today.\n\n1918: Penrose debuted his new hotel, calling it The Broadmoor. Despite exceeding its construction budget ($2 million in total), The Broadmoor quickly emerged as one of the best resort’s in the United States. Penrose threw a magnificent extravaganza to commemorate its grand opening, inviting many prominent Americans to attend the event. The party kick-started a tradition of hosting many luminaries from across the United States, including Charles Lindbergh, John D. Rockefeller, and Clark Gable. The Broadmoor would go on to attract several former U.S. presidents, such as Herbert Hoover and Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\n\n1939: El Pomar Foundation assumes control over The Broadmoor following the death of Spencer Penrose. The Penrose family’s charitable organization, it operated the resort through Charles L. Tutt Jr. for the next several years. Tuff had originally been recruited for the position through the Broadmoor Hotel and Land Company.\n\n1961: William Thayer Tutt—the son of Charles L. Tutt Jr.—became president of The Broadmoor. The resort expanded greatly under his watch, seeing the additions of the Broadmoor South and the International Center. William Thayer Tutt’s administration added another golf course designed by Robert Trent Jones. Several national sporting events are held at facilities throughout the complex as well, including the National Figure Skating Championships as well as the National Collegiate Athletic Association’s golf tournament. Many international competitions occurred at the resort, such as the World Hockey Championships and the World Senior Golf Tournament.\n\n1965: The Broadmoor World Arena hosted the World Figure Skating Championships. In operation since 1896, this prestigious competition is considered by many in the to be among its most important events. Most ice skaters consider placing at the World Figure Skating Championships to be the pinnacle of their careers, second only to the Olympics. Of the contest’s four major categories—Men, Ladies, Pairs, and Ice Dance—no American earned a gold medal.\n\n1975: Russell Thayer Tutt—another son of Charles L. Tutt Jr.—assumed control over The Broadmoor. Like his brother, Russell Thayer Tutt’s term as resort president saw the construction of many luxurious facilities. For instance, the resort installed its second conference center, Colorado Hall, during this time. Perhaps the greatest new addition to The Broadmoor was its third golf course, as the great Arnold Palmer helped design it in 1976.\n\n1989: Due to the Tax Reform Act of 1969, El Pomar Foundation eventually sold The Broadmoor to The Oklahoma Publishing Company. Over the next five years, The Oklahoma Publishing Company then subjected the entire resort to a major renovation that saw the addition of the Broadmoor, Spa Golf, and Tennis Club, as well as the Broadmoor West.\n\n1994: The Broadmoor adds new Golf, Spa, and Tennis facility and Rocky Mountain Ballroom.West Tower replaces the site of the former Broadmoor World Arena skating facility a year later, which moves three miles east and becomes the Colorado Springs World Arena and Ice Hall.

The new 21-room Lakeside Suites building was completed on the site of the first Main pool.\n\n2002: The original Broadmoor Main Building openrf after a total restoration and renovation. Artwork was restored on ceilings and walls; two guest elevators were added; rooms were redesigned with five-fixture baths and a host of state-of-the-art services and amenities.

Then President George W. Bush and his Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, met with allies from seven European countries at The Broadmoor to discuss the nature of their alliances through the NATO agreement.\n\n2004: The Spa at The Broadmoor was expanded to 43,000-sqare-feet with the addition of 10 new treatment rooms, two exclusive water treatments – the Serenity Shower and the Tranquility Tub – as part of a total redesign of the existing space, all created by master architect TAG Galyean.\n\n2005: The East Golf Course was returned to the original 1918-bunker design of legendary course designer Donald Ross.

Window walls opened onto an expanded awning-covered patio, complete with an exterior fire pit perfect for roasting marshmallows or making S’mores.\n\n2006: Broadmoor Hall opened in October, adding a 60,000 square-foot pillar-less and fully carpeted ballroom capable of holding up to 6,550 people.

Tihany-designed restaurant—opened to rave reviews. The first freestanding facility at The Broadmoor, Summit’s unusual design featureed a rotating wine turret as part of its design.

It closed after six weeks due to extensive rain damage but reopened in August of 2014.\n\nCloud Camp began construction that winter on Grand Lodge, which was built upon the foundation of the original 1927 Cheyenne Lodge.

Its lobby was expanded and completely redesigned with a stained-glass ceiling, fine woodwork and Italian marble floors. Broadmoor West’s entry was given a similar look and feel as the original Broadmoor Main entry. The exterior design of Broadmoor West more closely matched Broadmoor Main with Juliet balconies as a major focal point.\n\nCharles Court in Broadmoor West became an Adam D. Tihany-designed Italian restaurant called Ristorante del Lago with the West Lobby Bar incorporated into the facility as Bar del Lago. The original Café Julie in Broadmoor West then became Natural Epicurean, a full service restaurant that specialized in locally sourced, organic, natural and wholesome food.\n\nThe Broadmoor Fly-Fishing School opened on a lake situated just off the 6th hole of The Broadmoor’s East Golf Course. The lake area featured an Adirondack-style building that included a large fireplace, meeting areas, and fishing equipment.\n\nThe Broadmoor signed a three-year agreement with Pikes Peak Hill Climb and Pikes Peak Cycling Hill Climb in June of 2014, changing them to The Broadmoor Pikes Peak Hill Climb and The Broadmoor Pikes Peak Cycling Hill Climb, respectively. The Broadmoor also purchased the Seven Falls attraction in April and redesigned the park to be auto-free.\n\n2015: The Broadmoor Fishing Camp (later renamed Fly Fishing Camp) opened in June of 2015. The destination was a private fly-fishing camp with a beautifully restored lodge and seven miners' cabins that date back to the 1880's.
