        "text": "In a world where war, disease, famine, diversity, equality, AI, and God knows what else is piled on the plate in front of us, there may be one issue in that stew of concerns that trumps them all: Is any of what we’re being told in the media about anything entirely true?\n\nIn the final main stage production of their remarkable 44th season, the Red Barn Theatre in Key West takes this controversy head on with “Lifespan of a Fact”, an intriguing and humorous offering that has obvious relevance in this era of alternative facts. The play, written by Jeremy Kareken, David Murrell, and Gordon Farrell, runs April 9 – 27, and is adapted from a 2012 book by the real men portrayed in the play about a real incident in Nevada.\n\nThe play stars top local actors Dave Bootle, Cody Borah, and Rita Troxel. It’s directed by the Barn’s artistic director, Joy Hawkins. And be advised: All curtain times are 7 pm instead of the normal 8 pm.\n\n“It’s a very unique play,” said Hawkins. “I can’t compare it to anything else. It’s not a tie-it-up-in-a-bow kind of theater. You have to figure out for yourself what you think.”\n\nThe story starts off innocuously enough – Jim is a fresh-out-of-Harvard, eager beaver fact checker hired by Emily, a struggling magazine’s top editor, to fact-check an article submitted by the well-known and talented writer, John. The piece is centered around an indisputable incident: a 16-year-old boy is dead, having jumped from the observation deck of Las Vegas’ Stratosphere Hotel and Casino. Beyond that is where things get sticky.\n\nTurns out John has inserted unnecessary lies into his work under the guise of “artistic license” – for instance, was the casino deck actually 1100 feet high or far shorter, and did the boy’s death connect with other phenomena that day – like banned lap dances, the world’s oldest Tabasco bottle, or a tic-tac-toe-playing chicken named Ginger?\n\n“I’m not interested in accuracy,” says John. “I’m interested in truth.” And woe to anyone who calls his shattering essay an “article”. He is not cool with anyone tampering with his copy, insisting that 100 percent accuracy in names, dates, and specific incidents is less important than rhythm, music, and beauty in the language.\n\nBut Jim – out to prove himself – is not having any of it, and poor Emily is caught in the middle, concerned only with saving her magazine and knowing a sensational piece by the acclaimed John could prop up shrinking ad sales and disappearing subscriptions. What should she do?\n\nThe action is brisk, with plenty of sharp and funny repartee, sometimes unfolding like a taut thriller, but always coming back to the main question – do you undermine yourself by fiddling with the facts, or do you allow whatever is necessary to find the “higher truth” – the music of a boy’s tragic death?\n\nWho’s to say which one of them is speaking the kind of truth that really matters? You’ll have to decide for yourself.\n\nThe Washington Post called the play “buoyantly literate…briskly entertaining.” Variety said “…terrifically funny dialogue…the debate at the heart of the play demands serious attention.”\n\nTickets for “Lifespan of a Fact” are available at redbarntheatre.com or by calling 305-296-9911. Remember that all curtain times are 7 pm.\n\nThe show is sponsored in part by Design Key West, Culture Builds Florida, and the Monroe County Tourist Development Council.\n\nRED BARN’S “THE THANKSGIVING PLAY” TAKES A HILARIOUS ‘WOKE’ LOOK AT OUR ICONIC HISTORY\n\nWe hear a lot about “wokeness” in the heady world of national politics these days. It’s usually pretty serious stuff, with each side slamming the other for either having too much of it, or not having enough. But what happens when you bring that thorny issue down to the common earth of everyday people?\n\nWell, we’re about to find out in a very funny way when Key West’s Red Barn Theatre stages “The Thanksgiving Play” as the third mainstage production of their remarkable 44th season. The show opens March 5 and will run Tuesdays to Saturdays through the 30th.\n\nThe play was written by Larissa Fasthorse, a member of the Sicangu Lakota Nation, and the first female Native American playwright to have a show on Broadway when it premiered at the Helen Hayes Theatre in New York. It won a Drama League Award in 2023.\n\nIt’s a simple premise: a group of white theater nerds meet in an elementary school classroom to put together a dramatic rendition of the Thanksgiving story for their young students – the one we’ve always been told about the Pilgrims and the “Indians” and the turkey and the corn. But when the supposed Indigenous professional actress they hire turns out to be anything but, everything plunges headlong into hilarious absurdity as the hopelessly woke whites try to fashion a play that ultimately has nothing to do with the actual unsavory history of that occasion, and is completely devoid of any insight into a Native American perspective on it.\n\n“It’s very funny,” said director Mimi McDonald. “It brings home how we really don’t know what to do with what actual history – as opposed to the glossed-up stories – tells us really happened. The takeaway is that we’re all just trying to figure things out, and it can get really funny and absurd as we do.”\n\nFasthorse herself has said she hopes the audience – while entertained by the laughter – will walk away with more questions than answers. But the main point she wants to cut through the laughter is this: “Doing nothing is not adequate anymore,” she says. “Stepping away because it’s too complicated can no longer be considered a part of any kind of solution.” This sentiment is brought to side-splitting life in her show’s audacious climax, which, for the sake of not spoiling the hilarity of it, will not be revealed here.\n\nEntertainment Weekly said the play is “…a good dark comedy that makes you laugh, makes you think, makes you mad, makes your brain explode.” The Hollywood Reporter called it “Very, very funny…”.\n\nTickets are available at redbarntheatre.com or by calling 305-296-9911 and are already selling quickly. Ticketholders for the March 5 Opening Night will be invited to a catered Opening Night reception with the cast and crew.\n\n“The Thanksgiving Play” is sponsored in part by Key West Compass Realty – Keller Williams, Culture Builds Florida, and the Monroe County Tourist Development Council.\n\nRED BARN’S “POTUS” IS ONE VERY FUNNY FEMALE-DRIVEN TOUR-DE-FORCE\n\nIt would be hard to deny that politics in this day and age has pretty much distilled itself down into a daily dose of outright farce. Just turn on any TV news channel for five minutes, and it’s obvious. Things are out of control.\n\nSo it makes perfect sense that Selina Fillinger, one of the brilliant writers for Apple TV’s mega-hit, “The Morning Show” – a very funny and caustic skewering of cable TV news -- would turn her eye and pen to the focus of a lot of that news: the Oval Office and the creatures that inhabit it.\n\nThe result is the very funny “POTUS: Or Behind Every Great Dumbass Are Seven Women Trying To Keep Him Alive,” a hilarious cross between “Saturday Night Live” and “Veep”.\n\nFillinger’s very funny, all female-driven play will plunge the Red Barn Theatre stage into political chaos January 30 through February 24. The show will feature a Who’s Who of Key West’s top female actors, including George DiBraud, Jessica Miano Kruel, Susannah Wells, Lauren Thompson, Annie Miners, Lynne Casamayor, and Fritzie Estimond. It will be directed by the Barn’s artistic director, Joy Hawkins.\n\nOne of the cleverest conceits of the play is that we never see the President. We only hear about the PR nightmare he’s managed to spin into a global crisis. And it’s up to the seven brilliant and beleaguered women he relies upon most to risk their lives, their liberty, and their sanity to keep the Commander-in-Chief out of trouble.\n\nThere’s the super-sophisticated First Lady; the President’s sister (newly released from prison and the White House’s unofficial drug dealer); a pushy White House correspondent pursuing an interview with FLOTUS; POTUS’s meek secretary unable to cope with any of it; an outspoken, sexually-liberated young woman from a farming community who shows up and happens to have a surprising (though predictable) connection to the President; and that’s just for starters. Add in a press secretary and a Chief of Staff, and the mix gets quite volatile.\n\nAll these women are strong, opinionated characters, and Fillinger has them demonstrating that women in politics can be every bit as crass, brazen, bold, and – yes – deviant as the men in the halls of power. They are competent women cleaning up after incompetent men. And the result is just flat-out hilarious, filled with witty zingers and good, off-color fun – just what you’d expect from a writer of Fillinger’s abilities.\n\nOne important caveat: Be aware that Fillinger is not shy about using raw, crude language in her play. It’s salty, suggestive, and may be offensive to some audience members. But if you’ve already heard it all, you should be fine.\n\nPOTUS was written in the aftermath of the Trump years and reflects much of the chaos of that time. It was nominated in several categories in both the Drama League Awards and the Tony Awards in 2022. The Washington Post said, “The votes have been tabulated. POTUS…is a winner!” The NY Times called it “Gleeful…a rough and tumble feminist comedy.”\n\nTickets for “POTUS: Or Behind Every Great Dumbass Are Seven Women Trying To Keep Him Alive” are available at redbarntheatre.com or by calling 305-296-9911. The production is sponsored in part by Sugar Loaf Lodge, Michelle Grahl of Key West Compass Realty – Keller Williams, Culture Builds Florida, and the Monroe County Tourist Development Council.\n\nCOUNTRY ARTIST CHRISTINE MILD RETURNS TO THE RED BARN THEATRE\n\nThe extraordinary songstress Christine Mild will make her long-awaited return to the Red Barn Theatre in Key West with her brand new show, “This One’s For The Girls: Women of Country Music”. The show will run for four nights only, January 17 through 20, at the Red Barn, 319 Duval Street.\n\nWell-known for her wildly-popular production, “Always, Patsy Cline”, Mild will be expanding her repertoire to include the top hits of close to two dozen of country music’s most fabled female artists, running from the classics of the 50’s and 60’s through to the rock-tinged hitmakers of the modern era.\n\n“It really grew out of the ‘Patsy’ shows,” Mild said. “I realized that all the women singers I was listening to are kind of her legacy…she was the blueprint that laid the groundwork for them to become the marquees and bring the glamour. And there’s no denying that each of the women I’m featuring in this new show has done just that.”\n\nMild will be offering a swath of music from some of the most successful female country artists in history, including, among many others, The Judds, Shania Twain, Tanya Tucker, Dolly Parton, Reba McEntire, Trisha Yearwood, Tammy Wynette, Taylor Swift (yes, she was originally a country artist before crossing over), Martina McBride, Little Big Town, The High Women, Casey Musgraves, and of course, the incomparable Loretta Lynn.\n\n“She was an inspiration,” Mild said. “She made me think about these singers and what they went through to get where they are. When you really listen to their songs, they’re filled with what those women think is important. The messages are as profound as the music.”\n\nMild will be weaving many of those stories into her show, an element that will make the evening much richer. “These women have always lifted each other up, and I think this show will do the same for the audience,” Mild said. “It will be toe-tapping, heartwarming, and inspiring, with songs you’ll all know.”\n\nMild will have a terrific band backing her up, with musical director Jim Rice on piano, Mike Emerson on guitar, Gary Rivenson on bass, and Gary McDonald on drums. “It’s a great band,” she said. “We’re going to have a blast.”\n\nTickets for “This One’s For The Girls: Women of Country Music” are available at redbarntheatre.com or 305-296-9911. It is highly recommended that tickets be purchased early, as Mild’s shows always sell out. Sponsored in part by Culture Builds Florida, and the Monroe County Tourist Development Council.\n\nThere are those who believe our universe – the one our planet and galaxy currently exist within – is but one of many such universes, involving multiple dimensions, overlapping times, and repeating histories. While that concept may be hard to wrap your head around, the Red Barn Theatre in Key West may be able to help.\n\nTheir perennial favorite production, “Short Attention Span Theatre”, will return to their stage April 7 – 29, with this year’s theme being “Parallel Universes”. It’s an evening of six eclectic new one-act plays, each of which will take a skewed, often hilarious, look at the world (or universes) we live – or may live -- within.\n\n“They’re all comedic plays, but they’re meaty,” said Mimi McDonald, who is executive producing the show. “They’ll make you laugh, but they’ll also make you think. They’re about things that could happen, or could be, or that make you wonder about reality. The show’s colorful, lots of cool costumes, lots of good music. It’s a great evening if you’re looking for something fun and out of the ordinary.”\n\nMcDonald spent a lot of time finding just the right plays for this year’s show. She researched the best new short plays that have won awards from 2021 and beyond, and took advantage of her relationship with Miami’s City Theatre, which is well-known for their short play roster. Each play McDonald chose has its own world and reality, with characters and situations that not only surprise but are highly entertaining.\n\n“The concept of SAST is good writers, good actors, good directors,” she said. “I wanted new things by published writers. And we found them, for sure…David Ives is always good, and Laurie Allen. It’s hard to pick favorites -- they’re all terrific.”\n\nOnce again the entire McDonald theatrical clan – Mimi, husband Gary, daughter Amber, and son Jack – will be behind the scenes directing the various plays and creating the clever sets. They’ll be joined by Key West photographer/playwright Mike Marrero.\n\nRED BARN BRINGS OLD HOLLYWOOD BACK WITH MICHAEL MCKEEVER’S NEWEST, “THE CODE”\n\nIt’s true: the more things change, the more they stay the same. Or, since we’re in today’s Florida, it might be more relevant to say that no matter the strides we’ve made over the years, there’s always someone who sees the old ways as preferable.\n\nWhile playwright Michael McKeever may not have set out to write a play that resonates so vibrantly with what many in our community are struggling against today, his latest play, “The Code”, running March 7-25 at Key West’s Red Barn Theatre, does just that. Written about Hollywood in the 1950’s, it is most certainly germane to the LGBTQ issues that have arisen in today’s Southernmost State.\n\nThe play is set in the stylish home of Billy Haines, an actual silent film megastar who left the film business for personal reasons that become apparent as the story unfolds. Haines, now a successful interior designer, has invited a few friends for cocktails before they head out to a dinner party at famed director George Cukor’s house. Those friends include the glamorous and unfiltered film star Tallulah Bankhead; the oily and unpleasant agent, Henry Willson; and Willson’s latest find (and love interest) – aspiring young actor Chad Manford.\n\nAs the evening unfolds, it becomes clear that the “Code” which quickly dominates the conversation refers to the surreptitious rules that Hollywood has imposed to govern the way anyone LBGTQ has to behave in order to have a career and hope to succeed in Tinseltown. It’s a 1950’s version of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” seasoned with some “never admit” and a lot of “deny who you are and live a lie or go home”. To be gay in an industry policed by the Legion of Decency, the Hayes Code, and the House Un-American Activities Committee can not only get you labeled a deviant and a subversive, but it’s without doubt a death knell for a career on the silver screen.\n\nMcKeever’s skill with witty, very funny banter mixes perfectly with his ability to take a look at history from a different perspective. He channels Bankhead’s famous cutting wit, and nails the blackhearted Svengali a compromised agent can be. The play elicits its full share of laugh-out-loud moments in the way it looks at Old Hollywood and it’s foibles, but in the era of Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” and overt attempts at marginalization of the LGBTQ community, it has serious moments of resonance to modern times that cannot be missed.\n\n“FLAMING GUNS OF THE PURPLE SAGE” BRINGS THE OUTRAGEOUS WILD WEST TO THE RED BARN\n\nImagine Hopalong Cassidy trying to date Carrie, or Miss Kitty chasing Chuckie around the corral with a meat cleaver in an Addams Family version of “Gunsmoke,” and you may get close to the outrageous fun and outright craziness awaiting you in the Red Barn’s next production.\n\n“Flaming Guns of the Purple Sage”, written by the always-hilarious and rapier-sharp Jane Martin (“Says She”), opens January 31 and runs Tuesdays through Saturdays through February 25. It’s a preposterous mash-up of B-movie westerns and C-movie horror flicks that will literally have you laughing until you cry, even while you’re sitting in disbelief at what you’re seeing on stage.\n\n“I just love its audacity,” said director Joy Hawkins. “It’s unlike anything I’ve ever directed before. It’s full of macabre people you love and hate at the same time. We can’t get through a rehearsal without laughing ‘til our sides ache.”\n\nWithout giving away too much (because the surprises are everything in this tale), “Flaming Guns” tells the story of Big 8, a retired rodeo star who’s trying to keep her home from being foreclosed on. Living with her is Rob Bob, a rising young rodeo star (think more Gomer Pyle than John Wayne). Into this household comes SheDevil (her choice of name) who is pregnant by Big 8’s ne’er-do-well son, Lucifer Lee. But SheDevil is being hunted down by her very angry Ukrainian biker boyfriend, Black Dog, and when he shows up, things really begin to get interesting.\n\n“Be aware,” Hawkins said, “that there is, indeed, a lot of violence and blood and sex all mixed in, but it’s done in a very farcical and satirical way. Be advised -- it’s definitely for adults…I wouldn’t bring the kids. But it’s a very cleverly-written send-up of those old B-movie Westerns and horror flicks. This is all fun and laughs about how crazy – in a very funny way -- human beings can be.”\n\nThe play stars a terrific mix of Key West’s best comedic actors, including George DiBraud, Susannah Wells, Mathias Maloff, Tim Dahms, Cassidy Timms, Iain Wilcox, and Jack McDonald. Hawkins directs and Carmen Rodriguez will be designed the western duds.\n\nCurtain Up called it “a crowd-pleaser that keeps the audience howling”. The Courier-Journal calls it “hilarious and rip-snortin’”, and Concord Theatricals dubs it a “shoot ‘em up, knock ‘em up, cut ‘em up comic romp.”\n\nKEN LUDWIG’S “Dear Jack, Dear Louise” OPENS THE RED BARN’S 43RD SEASON\n\nIn the 21st Century’s fast-paced digital culture, the personal letter, handwritten on fine stationery from one person to another, has all but disappeared -- become a lost art few seldom indulge in anymore. Emails, texts, Tweets, Instagrams, connection apps – these are the main means of communication between people in a world increasingly dominated by the code of a metaverse we no longer actually touch.\n\nPerhaps this was on the mind of playwright Ken Ludwig when he sat down last year to pen his Helen Hayes Award Winning play, “Dear Jack, Dear Louise.” Because the heart of the play is about just that – personal, handwritten letters that passed between a World War II Army doctor and a Broadway starlet working at the Stage Door Canteen in New York during the war. And they’re not just any letters – these were epistles that formed the joyous, heartwarming story of Ludwig’s parents’ long-distance courtship and eventual marriage.\n\n“Dear Jack, Dear Louise” is set to make its South Florida debut December 20th as the opening production of the Red Barn’s 43rd Season in Key West, with a run that goes through January 14th of 2023. It will star Key West favorites Jessica Miano Kruel as Louise Rabiner, an aspiring actress and dancer in New York, and Cody Borah as Captain Jack Ludwig, a military doctor then stationed in Oregon. The Barn’s Artistic Director, Joy Hawkins, will direct.\n\n“It’s a good, old-fashioned story,” Hawkins said. “And I think it’s special to have such an unabashed love story in these times. It takes you back. And it’s pertinent right now as we’re dealing with war in the world. It’s sweet, it’s funny, but it’s also real – these were real people, living real lives, and we’re privileged to watch how they managed to fall in love under such circumstances.”\n\nLudwig and Rabiner, living on opposite sides of the country in 1942, strike up a correspondence at the urging of their parents, who were old friends. They find a rapport right away – he encouraging her with auditions, she commiserating over his hardass commanding officer. It’s not all fun and games, though, as the ugly situation in the world encroaches on their connection.\n\nThe show isn’t schmaltzy either, in great part due to the way it’s staged, with the two characters on stage together but separately – he in his world on one side of the stage, and she in hers on the other. The beauty of the play is in the way the characters build chemistry in front of the audience’s eyes without ever looking at one another. And they’re not reading the letters – they’re living the words we understand they wrote.\n\n“It’s captivating to watch,” Hawkins said. “We’re not sure they’ll ever get together, but it’s a beautiful ending. I hope the audience will feel connected to their own experiences, and maybe those of their own parents.”\n\nThe Washington Post said the play is “…a poignant, funny tribute to the enduring power of human connection.” The Lit Arts Maven said, “One of the finest theatre experiences I have had in 25 years of reviewing.”\n\n“Dear Jack, Dear Louise” runs December 20 – January 14, excepting Christmas Eve and Christmas, and New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day. Tickets are available at redbarntheatre.com/tickets or by calling 305-296-9911, 3-5 pm weekdays.\n\nThe Red Barn season is sponsored in part by the Monroe County Tourist Development Council, and the State of Florida Division of Cultural Affairs.\n\nHILARIOUS “HURRICANE DIANE” BLOWING INTO THE RED BARN THEATRE\n\nWhat if the Greek God Dionysus, deity of wine and ecstasy, suddenly walked into your kitchen and announced that it was time mankind shaped up and started taking care of “his” planet and that you and your girlfriends were going to be the first acolytes in his quest to bring the Earth back to its natural, unsullied state? What could go wrong, right?\n\nThis is the reality-bending set-up for the hilarious new play, “Hurricane Diane”, set to open at the Red Barn Theatre in Key West on March 22 for a four-week run. Written by Pulitzer Prize finalist Madeleine George, the play will feature a who’s who of Key West women, including Erin McKenna, Caroline Taylor, Susannah Wells, Jessica Miano Kruel, and Lauren Thompson. It will be directed by Red Barn artistic director, Joy Hawkins.\n\nGeorge launches her play right from “Lights Up”. We meet Dionysus immediately, though not as we might expect. He has morphed into a rabble-rousing lesbian gardener from Vermont named Diane, and she’s chosen four suburban New Jersey housewives – think a sophisticated, socially-conscious version of a “Real Housewives” show and you won’t be far off – to join his efforts at reclaiming the natural beauty of the planet.\n\nThe four women all live on a cul-de-sac in flood-prone Red Bank, New Jersey in identical cookie-cutter houses. They regularly gather over wine and coffee to gossip about anything but the latest portents for the climate. There’s control freak Carol, who just wants a well-manicured lawn; and Renee, a top editor at HGTV Magazine; and Pam, an Italian dragon in animal prints; and weepy Beth, who’s just been left by her husband.\n\nInto this coffee klatch comes lesbian landscape gardener Diane, livid at humanity for “despoiling the green earth that gave you life.” She has great plans – not the least of which involve indulging her Dionysian proclivities – and she’s going to begin right here, right now.\n\nWill Diane be able to enlist them all? Will this diverse band of suburban women be inspired by the appetites of their divine visitor to unleash their wildness to help the battered planet? Maybe. Maybe not. You’ll have to see.\n\nTo say the play is outrageously funny is a given. But it also carries a subtextual message that has profound relevance in this day and age. Called “incisively smart and boisterously funny” by the Boston Globe, “clever and timely” by New York Theater, and “An astonishing new play” by the NY Times, “Hurricane Diane” lives up to its fantastical premise.\n\nTickets are available at redbarntheatre.com or by calling 305-296-9911. The play is sponsored in part by The Dogwood Foundation, Design Group Key West, and the Monroe County Tourist Development Council.\n\n“QUARANTINE FOR TWO” TO PREMIERE AT RED BARN\n\nGod knows there hasn’t been much to laugh about the last couple of years. Pandemics tend to lean that way.\n\nBut thanks to Hy Conrad – the writer/producer of the very funny “Monk” series – we’ll get a chance to shake off a little of the downside of things when his new play, “Quarantine For Two”, opens a four week run on February 15th at Key West’s Red Barn Theatre. The production marks the play’s American premiere.\n\n“Hy and I were chatting one day,” said artistic director Joy Hawkins, “and we thought a funny play about this might be good for people, to lighten things up a bit. And who better to do that than Hy Conrad?”\n\nThe play centers on a typical, middle-aged, suburban couple – played by David Black and Mimi McDonald – who have been quarantining at home for more than a year. But it hasn’t gone well. In fact, they’ve driven each other crazy, to the point that each has come to the conclusion that for their own sanity, they need to kill the other. How they go about that – with the involvement of a somewhat dim and double-dealing poolboy-turned-hitman played by Rhett Kalman – leads to a very hilarious escalation of complications.\n\n“I tend to write toward comedy and crime,” Conrad said. “The idea of two people in lockdown who desperately want to kill each other seemed to make comic sense, if we want to make light of our fears in the moment. Balancing the truth in the Covid situation with finding the humanity in the characters and making it funny was the challenge.”\n\nBASSIST FOR THE STARS: VAIL JOHNSON TELLS ALL IN RED BARN LIMITED ENGAGEMENT\n\nYou might not recognize him on the street nor know his name, but you’ve probably seen him onstage and you’ve most certainly have heard him…probably many times.\n\nVail Johnson is his name, and he’s a bassist. Not just any bassist, mind you, but THE bassist when it comes to studio work, recordings, and live performance. He’s been doing it for over 40 years with some of the top names in music, and he’s bringing a career-ful of behind-the-scenes stories and almost every note of the great music he’s had a hand in to the Red Barn Theatre in Key West.\n\nHis one-man show, “Bassically Incorrect: Around the World in 40 Years” will have a limited engagement at the Barn Sunday and Monday, March 6 and 7 only. Tickets are available now at redbarntheatre.com or by calling 305-296-9911.\n\nWant some names he’s put the bottom under? How about Kenny G, Whitney Houston, Herbie Hancock, Stevie Nicks, Keb’ Mo’, George Benson, Michael Bolton, James Ingram, Gil Scott Heron, Paula Abdul, MC Hammer, T. Graham Brown, David Cassidy, Steve Perry, Patti Austen, Peabo Bryson, Edgar Winter, and Christopher Cross, just to name a very few.\n\n“It just sort of happened,” Johnson said recently. “I was playing in a lounge band back in the late 70’s, and Kenny G’s percussionist sees me, brings Kenny to the gig, and the next thing I know, I’m playing in Kenny G’s band. We go to LA, and Stevie Nicks sees me at a gig, and asks me to do her record. It just snowballed from there.”\n\nIt wasn’t all luck, however. Johnson was ready when the door opened. The youngest of seven brothers (one of his older siblings is Key West’s Jeff Johnson), Vail was immersed in all kinds of music through his family – classical, choral, gospel, bluegrass, Dixieland, Top 40. He absorbed it all, mixing in whatever he came across, including jazz, hip-hop, metal rock, and pure improvisation. His virtuosity, passion, and humor were his calling card, and his ability to play virtually any style extremely well sealed the deal.\n\nAnd all of it is on display in his one-man show – from Kenny G’s, George Benson’s, and Herbie Hancock’s jazz to Steve Perry’s and Stevie Nicks’s rock, to Peabo Bryson’s soul and Keb’Mo’s blues.\n\n“I tell stories about the artists I’ve played and toured with, and then play and sing along with the tracks I’ve done with them or played on tour. I do some of my own stuff too. And what I do is not just ‘play bass’…people are surprised what I can do on a bass in terms of playing music. Look…it’s a guitar. It just happens to be a bass. I can make it sound like a Spanish guitar, or bluesy finger-picking, or monster slapping.”\n\nAsk Johnson who was the most fun he’s had with any artist, and the answer might surprise you. “Edgar Winter,” he said. “For me to play ‘Frankenstein’ with Edgar Winter? Man, that was freakin’ fun!”\n\nIt doesn’t matter what style of music or what particular artist you like personally – there’s a very good chance Vail Johnson will tell you a story about touring with them, or play something you’ve heard by them in his show. And odds are you’ll say, “Oh, yeah! I know that one! He played bass on that?”\n\nTickets for “Bassically Incorrect” are two-tiered. For the Sunday, March 6 show, all tickets are $60. For Monday night’s show, they’re $75, but that gets you an invite to the catered after-party in the Red Barn courtyard, where you can meet and talk music with Vail Johnson and enjoy some delish foods.\n\nYou’ll also be able to purchase some of Vail’s own CDs both evenings, the proceeds from which will be going directly to the Florida Keys SPCA.\n\nThis show is sponsored in part by Design Group Key West, and the Monroe County Tourist Development Council.\n\nRED BARN PRESENTS SPECIAL ENGAGEMENT “WALKING HAPPY” FEBRUARY 3-5\n\nA Tribute to Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme\n\nThere are very few married couples who have reached the rare air of the entertainment world’s pinnacle of success. George Burns and Gracie Allen come to mind, and Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne.\n\nBut one couple stands above them all in the music sphere: Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme.\n\nAnd February 3-5, you would not be blamed for thinking that dynamic duo is somehow standing on the outdoor stage of Key West’s Red Barn Theatre when singers Jim Rice and Valerie Roy bring Steve and Eydie back to life in their celebrated tribute, “Walking Happy”. All three shows will be presented under the stars on the courtyard stage in front of the theater.\n\nThe special engagement features Rice, a pianist, singer, and arranger who has worked closely with many top acts, including Key West’s Randy Roberts. Joining him will be Valerie Roy, a lauded singer on her own, and one of Rice’s closest friends.\n\n“We’ve known each other 25 years,” Rice said recently. “I’ve done a lot of her arranging work, and we’re so attuned to one another now – on stage and off – that it’s like we’re married. Like Steve and Eydie, we’re on the same page every moment, and it’s very obvious on stage.”\n\nThat tight friendship and musicality serve Rice and Roy well as they re-animate Steve and Eydie in their Vegas-style show. Hit songs like “This Could Be The Start Of Something Big”, “Make Someone Happy”, “A Lot Of Living”, “What Did I Have”, and “A Room Without Windows” complement the easy and entertaining banter Steve and Eydie had on their many network specials and appearances on “The Tonight Show”.\n\nSteve Allen’s version of that show is where Lawrence and Gorme met, in fact, when she was hired as a solo performer and ran into the show’s staff singer and co-star. “I fell in love,” Gorme has said. “I fell madly in love with him instantly.”\n\nThey were inseparable after that night, married soon after, and began their remarkable run of Grammy and Emmy awards, hit Broadway shows, and tours with their mentor and close friend, Frank Sinatra.\n\n“Steve Lawrence was a really fine singer,” Rice said. “In fact, Sinatra said many times that Steve Lawrence was a much better singer than he was. And Eydie was a perfect match for him.”\n\nTickets for the limited engagement of “Walking Happy” at the Red Barn are available now at redbarntheatre.com or 305-296-9911. Seating will be limited, so early reservations are suggested.\n\nThe shows are sponsored in part by the Monroe County Tourist Development Council.\n\nFUNNY AND POIGNANT CATS TALK BACK OPENS THE RED BARN’S 42nd SEASON\n\nIt’s been a long dry spell thanks to the pandemic, but theater is finally back in Key West! And the Red Barn will open its new season with a special show you won’t want to miss.\n\nCritics call it “a winner…funny, poignant, and observant…” (Backstage) and “…a bubbly, easy-going treat of theatre…” (Time Out). You’ll call it wonderful.\n\nWhat you’ll be watching is Cats Talk Back, the critically-acclaimed mock-docu-comedy by New York’s celebrated young playwright, Bess Wohl, which opens the Red Barn Theatre’s stellar 42nd season of bright and brilliant comedies.\n\nThe play will be presented outdoors under the stars in the Red Barn’s expansive courtyard, and run January 18th through January 29, 2022. All curtains are at 8 pm.\n\nThe magic of the play’s unique concept – a talk-back session with several former cast members of Cats, one of the most successful musicals in Broadway history – lies in its realism. That realism is effected through the panel discussion’s moderator, a respected member of the theatrical community…in this case, Murphy Davis, one of Key West’s best known theater directors. The use of Davis as the facilitator of the on-stage discussion blurs the lines of fiction and reality. Are these really Cats actors, or actors playing those actors?\n\nThe panelists are ostensibly all former members of the Cats production, which ran for 18 years and 7845 performances. But during the play, we learn that the musical’s success was not always these actors’ success. There’s Monique, who survived the full 18 years, but had her dancing career stalled because of it. There’s Bonnie, whose hunger for approval was squashed when the show closed right after she joined the cast. There’s Steven, an actor’s actor, and Hector, the quintessential egocentric, boastful actor who still manages to be charismatic.\n\n“CATS TALK BACK is my first play. I wrote it while I was an acting student at the Yale School of Drama, and it was originally performed at a small, student-run space called the Yale Cabaret. Each role was tailored specifically to one of my classmates and the play itself was a love letter to theatre, actors, and the community we build together. We promoted the play as if it was entirely real, and many non-Yale people who came to see the show thought that the actors in it were actually the real performers from Cats. It all felt like a giant trick, a joyful prank-- which I now realize is how I think about most theatre, no matter the form. When I sat in the audience of Cats Talk Back for the very first time in front of a raucous, late night crowd it was a terrifying, thrilling watershed moment in my life. I had never before sat in an audience to watch actors say text I had written. I had never seen a crowd respond to my words onstage before-- and the responses were wild. I remember vividly the moment, sitting there, when I knew that playwriting was my future path. CATS TALK BACK went on to be performed at the NY International Fringe Festival to sold-out performances and won the Fringe award for Best Overall Production. For me, the play is, at its heart, about the difficulty of recapturing our peak moments in life, the moments that become memory. Years after writing the play, when we were performing it yet again at a Fringe reunion benefit, I realized that the experience of creating the play was now one of those peak past moments, something we all miss deeply but can never recapture. In the end, the play became the very thing that I was writing about. I am so deeply moved and honored that it is being revisited again, and finding new life in Key West.\n\nWith gratitude, Bess”\n\nTHE CONCHS AND COWBOYS ARE BACK IN THE SADDLE AGAIN AT THE RED BARN\n\nJohn Wells, Tom Murtha, and Paul Cotton almost met way back in the 1970s. It was in the Baltimore Civic Center, where Wells and Murtha were part of the opening act for Cotton’s headliner, the seminal California country rock band, Poco, which rose from the ashes of Buffalo Springfield and provided the DNA for bands like the Eagles. But as is usually the case with big-time concerts, the openers didn’t mix with the headliners.\n\nFlash forward several decades to a couple of years ago, when Wells unexpectedly ran into Cotton at the Red Barn Theatre in Key West and reminded him of that gig in Baltimore. The two guitarists started reminiscing and talking music, and the next thing you know, they’re calling bassist Murtha, drummer Gary McDonald, and harmonica virtuoso George Halloran to get together just to jam and make some music.\n\nAnd that’s usually how the great groups happen. This one became one of Key West’s most popular amalgams, the Made In Key West Band – also lovingly known as the Conchs and Cowboys – who will be Back In The Saddle Again when they return to the Red Barn Theatre for six rousing nights of great tunes and stories, which they call “Tales of Old Key West”. Shows are scheduled for Sundays and Mondays, February 21-22, 28-29, and March 6-7. The first notes will ring out at 8 pm each night.\n\n“Paul Cotton had not really done a lot of this kind of thing – a musical concert in a theatrical setting,“ Wells said. “He was used to the arenas or small music clubs like the Troubador. But it sounded so good, he was willing to give it a try.”\n\nBoth Cotton and the audiences loved the experience. Last year’s shows at the Red Barn were complete sellouts, with everyone thoroughly enjoying the eclectic mix of songs and stories. Wells anticipates this year’s shows will have the same result.\n\n“We do vocals you don’t hear very often,” Wells said, “and songs that we love. Some have Key West associations, some are arrangements that I heard that are so different from what you normally hear. And we do a few of Paul’s Poco tunes too.”\n\nThe intriguing part of a Conchs and Cowboys show is the theatricality of it, Wells said, which comes from the way they weave the stories of the songs into the show.\n\n“It’s not just a band playing music,” he said. “It’s a whole experience. It’s really improvisational and in the moment, so each night’s show will be a little different. I’ve never done anything like it. It really just flies.”\n\nIf you caught last year’s shows, expect to hear some of the favorites the audience let the band know they liked best. But Wells, Cotton, and crew also have several new things in their saddlebags for this year’s shows.\n\n“The thing I’m most appreciative of are the people who say they really like the songs and stories we do,” Wells said. “We have a lot of fun.”\n\nKey West’s Red Barn Theatre will present the fourth online offering of its 41st season with a streaming production of Jane Martin’s funny and provocative “Sez She”, starring a stellar cast of 16 of Key West’s top female actors, directed by the Barn’s artistic director, Joy Hawkins.\n\nThe show will run March 8-20 and can be accessed through the theater’s website at redbarntheatre.com. Tickets are only $10, with viewing available 24/7 on any platform with an internet connection, be it TV, phone, or tablet.\n\n“Sez She” is the late Martin’s final play in a series that has featured the broad perspectives on life of modern-day women, told in a series of intimate and revealing monologues. Two previous plays, “Talking With” and “Vital Signs”, have won numerous awards, including the American Theatre Critics Best Play Award. Martin, herself, has been nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for another of her plays, “Keely and Du”.\n\n“Sez She” offers humorous and outspoken takes on everything from the fun of regressing to our childhood to the grownup \"wheeee\" of sex, from celebrating Damn Fools Day to the virtues of being green (yes…the color green). They touch chords of hilarity, surprise, homespun philosophy, frustration, and even political commentary. Each and every one of them has you hanging on every word.\n\nThe actors in the play are: Susannah Wells, George DiBraud, Caroline Taylor, Carolyn Cooper, Erin McKenna, Marjorie Paul Shook, Jessica Miano Kruel, Amber McDonald Good, Gerri Louise Gates, Melody G. Moore, Nicole Nurenberg, Zoe Hawkins-Wells, Vanessa McCaffrey, and Mimi McDonald.\n\nWhether written by a man or woman, Jane Martin’s “Sez She” is a powerful, engaging, provocative play perfectly tuned to the times we are living through right now. The Minneapolis Star-Tribune called it\n\n“…enormously entertaining, more like a Disney World ride aimed at adults. Lean back, take a deep breath, and grasp the handrail firmly.”\n\nENCHANTING “EAT LIKE A CHILD” IN LIMITED RUN AT THE RED BARN THEATRE\n\nThirty-two years ago, a cast of talented kids hit the stage of the Red Barn Theatre in Key West, singing and dancing their way through a delightful musical called “Eat Like a Child: And Other Lessons on How Not To Be A Grown-up.”\n\nAmong that group of young actors were Amber McDonald, Garth Holtcamp, and Camila Duke, who were nine or ten years old at the time. Amber had literally grown up in the theater her parents – Mimi and Gary McDonald – established eight years earlier.\n\nFast forward 32 years. Amber, Garth, and Camila all have kids of their own and history is about to repeat itself.\n\nThe Red Barn will present an updated version of “Eat Like A Child” in a very limited four-performance run Friday, April 29 through Sunday, May 1. The Friday and Saturday shows are at 7 pm, and there will be a 2 pm matinee on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nAnd front and center on the stage? The next generation: Lilly and Logan Good (Amber’s kids), Phineas Haskell (Camila’s son), and Greta Holtcamp (Garth’s daughter), among a dozen others.\n\n“We’re calling it a ‘legacy’ production,” said Mimi McDonald, who with actress Carolyn Taylor will be directing the new show. “We’ve been waiting for all our kid’s kids to get to the 8 to 10-year-old stage so we could do it. It’s a very sweet show, written about and for kids, performed by kids. We’re having a ball.”\n\nThe very cute book for the show was written by Delia Ephron (Nora’s sister), with music and lyrics by John Forster, the award-winning singer-songwriter and composer of multiple children’s musicals. Nancy 3 Hoffman will be providing the musical accompaniment for the score, and Penny Leto will be handling the choreography.\n\nThe show centers around everything that impacts a kid’s world in wonderful little vignettes that feature various combinations of the young actors – from trying to sell the parents on getting a dog, to not wanting to go to bed, pretending to be sick to get out of going to school, how they don’t like their little sister, and the injustice of having to walk somewhere when there’s a perfectly good car to take them there. And that’s just a sampling.\n\n“It’s really fun to hear them sing the same songs that have been stuck in my head all these years,” said Amber. “And it’s nice to acknowledge what really hasn’t changed – technology may have changed a lot, but all the stuff that’s true to being a kid is still the same, generation to generation.”\n\nHer mom, Mimi, adds, “It’s about universal truths that don’t change. Any adult who sees this will most definitely see a lot of things they did themselves, for sure.”\n\nTickets are limited because of the short run and can be had at redbarntheatre.com or by calling 305-296-9911. The show is sponsored in part by Keys Open Doors and the Monroe County Tourist Development Council."
