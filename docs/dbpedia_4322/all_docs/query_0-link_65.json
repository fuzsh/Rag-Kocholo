        "text": "b 26 November 1899 in Brooklands, Cheshire; her father was director of a firm of butchers.\n\nLearnt to fly in 1926, but in 1928 was the pilot in a horrific accident when she was duped into a publicity stunt by Walter Browning, the 'Dancing Airman', who told her a film had to be delivered urgently, and persuaded to land her Avian in a field. She was surprised to see a crowd of people, realised she wasn't going to stop in time and tried to take off again, but hit the crowd standing near a wall; a 10-year old boy was killed, several persons injured, and \"many women fainted\".

She became an instant star across the world, especially in her home city of Salford.

She was also a pretty good golfer; she and her partner Mrs Brooks got to the last 8 of the Ladies' Northern Foursomes at Leeds in 1938.\n\nLater sailed from North Wales to Spitsbergen in her 45-foot yawl Perula. During WWII, Chief Coxswain in the Marine Department of Saunders Roe.\n\nIn 1940 she gave birth to a son, Anthony, after it was revealed she had \"secretly married her long time adventure companion Ron Adams\" (although I'm not sure what was so secret about it).\n\nShe attended the 1950 King's Cup Race, but was \"horrified ... I thought sadly of Bert Hinkler, Cobham, Barnard, Hubert Broad and Wally Hope.\"\n\n'Win' died in July 1984 in Hove, Sussex.\n\nIn 1950, Winnie wrote this lovely article for 'Flight':\n\nPOST-WAR AIR RACING - is Something Missing?\n\nA Pre-war Winner Asks Some Pertinent Questions\n\nBy WINIFRED BROWN\n\nAs something \"rather different\" in post-war air races, the Daily Express \"International South Coast Race\" on September 16th seems likely to be watched with interest, especially by \"the forgotten pioneers of long ago\" - in which category a South African magazine recently included me!\n\nFor some time we have been asking ourselves \" What has gone wrong - air racing or we old pilots?\" Has the sport really lost its thrill and popularity, or have we merely become the club bores who stand at a bar counter and say, between beers, \"Things aren't what they were\"?\n\nI have been thinking about these questions for several weeks - ever since, in fact, I set off, in excited anticipation and an Austin Seven - to see this year's King's Cup Race. The Wolverhampton Aero Club had very kindly invited me - \"Just to show them you are still in the land of the living, Win?\" chuckled John Bill over the telephone, for the previous year the B.B.C. had coupled my name with the type of wings that go with a harp! It was 20 years since I had won the King's Cup and 19 years since I have even seen an air race. I had a shock coming to me!\n\nWhen asked if I were flying, I laughed and replied ungrammatically, \"What, me! I'm used to 105 m.p.h.,not 501.\" And as my little car proceeded at a sedate 40m.p.h. my mind went back 20 years. Who would be there? Tommy Rose, Jimmy Jeffs, Robin Cazalet, \"Lamps\"? What fun it would be to see them all again!\n\nOn arrival at the Star and Garter I rushed to look at the hotel register... I didn't recognize a single name! They must still be in the bar... we had always lingered... they would come later; so, casting respectability to the wind, I ignored my married name and wrote \" Win Brown and son.\"\n\nThat night there was a R.A.F.A. dance - to meet the \"famous pilots\"! The dancing was popular enough, but we were not; when we went on the stage the room practically emptied - the dancers had probably done far more flying than we had!\n\nStill there was a nice bar upstairs, and I talked with interest to the 1950 pilots. \"Do you have flying pageants these days?\" I asked a young man. For a moment he looked puzzled, then replied \"Yes, but we call them 'air rallies'\". When I flew in 1930 we had a 750-mile course. Do you like these short circuits? \" \"Oh yes! It's a better test of flying—none of this navigation stuff enters into it. '\n\nI thought sadly of Bert Hinkler, Cobham, Barnard, Hubert Broad and Wally Hope. That night I went to bed at 11.30 - if there was a party I didn't find it!\n\nNext day I got to the airfield early. I looked and blinked. Was I back in 1930? Where were these modern super aircraft? I felt I could have got into almost any one of the competing machines, and flown as I used to do; but my son, aged nine, was thrilled as I took him round. It was then the Press descended on us - \"That's right,sonny - smile up at your grannie!'' My expression was such that the pictures did not appear, but fortunately the bar tent opened and Jack Cantrill, who had given me my first flying lesson in 1925, assisted me to recover.\n\nThen a few old faces appeared, but we all sadly agreed that \"things ain't wot they was.\" As for the race itself - well, it sounded fine on the radio but, with no rudeness intended, I would not describe Hawk Trainers and Austers \"screaming\" round anything. Princess Margaret's Hurricane gave us a thrill and it was beautifully handled by Townsend, but the two Spits that I hadrelied on to impress my son promptly took off and got lost - so perhaps there is something in this ''navigation stuff\" after all! One we never saw again, but the other obligingly returned, much to the delight of my small son, and the spectators - but probably less so to the owner of the aircraft whose tail it knocked clean off.\n\nBut what horrifies me about this race - and, for that matter, present-day air racing in general - is that the slide-rule experts, secreted with Charles Gardiner in glass towers, seem reasonably able to forecast the result after one lap! In the King's Cup they were about 60 yards out, and in the two Newcastle races a few weeks later it seems from Flight's report that the ultimate winners appeared unbeatable almost from the outset.\n\nWhere is the sport, the fight, the fun of the thing? It seems to me that if you haven't beaten the handicappers before you start you might just as well stay in the bar. On a long circuit a race was never lost until it was won. Engines could pack up in sight of home; flimsy racing wheels could buckle on a careless landing; you might run into cloud or fog and fail to find that white cross in the field; but no matter what happened there was always home - the others might be faring worse. To beat the handicappers was a decided help, but only the beginning of a long story.\n\nAfter this year's King's Cup I scanned the newspapers, but gone were the old headlines. The little publicity there was went to the tragic accident rather than to Edward Day. I wondered vaguely if a victory for Princess Margaret would have received more publicity, but I doubt it - my papers were full of the footballers who received a free trip to South America, £25 each and the offer of some £175 a month, and returned highly incensed because a hair-cut cost 7s and the people carried rifles!\n\nSo good for British prestige, and obviously so much more important than a few men and women who risk their neck for British aviation, a possible prize of £150 and a replica of the Cup. I did risk my neck for about £1,000 in 1930, and in those days the cup was won outright.\n\nWhat has caused this lack of interest on the part of the Press and public? Has flying become too common? But, for that matter, what could be more common than football and race-horses, sports which still hold the crowds? Perhaps it is the effect of the war - petrol only just off the ration, money short, private owners and aero clubs unable to afford the high-powered aircraft we now scarcely glance at as they do, literally, scream through the sky.\n\nPresumably with the industry in a transition stage pending large-scale production of military jet aircraft, and because of present-day-economic conditions, the trade cannot give the support it did to racing. For this reason one must admire the present-day private owner. Gone are the days of dual at £1 an hour, free petrol, a loaned engine, and perhaps even a free aircraft. To-day one can hardly afford to patronize the bar tent!\n\nMy small son was all for presenting the King's Cup to Cole and his Comper Swift. ''That little one has done best, Win - t has gone all that way against the big ones.\" Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings.... Would the old Circuit of Britain again arouse public interest? Personally, I think it would. Some 15,000 people were present at Wolverhampton this year, but in 1930 similar, if not larger, crowds assembled at each of the controls at London, Bristol, Manchester, Newcastle and Hull, not to mention the turning-points at Southampton, Birmingham,Liverpool, Leeds and Leicester. The King's Cup race belonged to the country as a whole and not just to one area.\n\nBut there is another point, and an important one. The rot started to set in way back in 1931, when new King's Cup regulations caused the entries to drop from 101 to 41. Restrictions! They are ruining our country to-day. It seems to be that the South Coast Race is, in some degree, a return to old conditions, and that if it is successful it may influence next year's King's Cup. I hope so, for personally I would like to see a grand and glorious free for all - Maggies to Meteors on the old circuit of Britain.\n\n''What else would you do, Win?\" asked one of the old timers as we stood discussing the matter in the bar. \"I'd have bookies under nice, coloured umbrellas - but I'd keep them away from the slide-rule experts!\" And I suppose you'd have better prizes and bigger bar tents? \"Sure!\" I laughed. \"Well,\" said an old pilot, slowly, \"something has got to be done; the King's Cup to-day is no different to the little races we used to take part in every Saturday at the old pageants.\" \"Rallies, dear, rallies,\" I corrected.\n\nSo we all had another beer, and my small son, waiting outside, began to take a dim view of aviation."
