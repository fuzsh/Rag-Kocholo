        "text": "Project Overview\n\nQuinton Business Park is a multi-let scheme 5 miles outside of the city centre. EPD undertook a comprehensive refurbishment of the common areas of Building 4, focusing on a total redesign of the 3-storey atrium reception, breakout spaces, WCâ€™s and shower facilities. This project was aimed at modernising and enhancing the functional and aesthetic aspects of the building, ensuring a welcoming and contemporary environment for all occupants and visitors.\n\nDesign Concept\n\nThe renovation embraced an industrial design ethos, with a focus on bold textures, raw metal finishes, striking colours, and quality materials. A key feature of the redesign is the prominent white metal staircase, which spans the full height of the atrium. This feature was repainted black, creating a dramatic centrepiece that inspired the overall industrial design scheme.\n\nKey Features\n\nReception Area:\n\nThe original security gate was removed to improve flow and accessibility.\n\nA new reception desk made of patinated steel, complemented by matching steel and leather bench seating, enhances the industrial aesthetic.\n\nUnder the staircase, the previously unused space was transformed into a functional and uniquely designed seating area.\n\nA bespoke tiered lighting installation, crafted from bone china, adds a warm, ambient glow, serving as a focal point.\n\nMaterial and Color Palette:\n\nThe design features a vibrant palette including teal, pink, and natural wood tones.\n\nHerringbone wall tiles with a wood grain pattern surround the lifts on each level, adding texture and a touch of colour.\n\nThe overall colour scheme is harmonised with tropical plants, creating a balance between the industrial elements and a sense of wellbeing.\n\nRestroom Facilities:\n\nThe male and female restrooms were completely stripped and remodeled.\n\nThe design includes grey concrete floor tiles in a chevron pattern and high gloss wall tiles behind basins and cubicles, enhancing the play of light and sense of luxury.\n\nWarm wood veneer on cubicles, leather accents on mirrors, and black hardware contribute to a sophisticated and tactile environment."
