        "text": "Year Victim(s) Location body found Notes 8 January 1990 William Howe Worthing, West Sussex The body of the 63-year-old retired vet was found tied up in his flat on 9 January 1990. Because the flat had been ransacked, and because Howe had tens of thousands of pounds hidden in a safe there (which the offender/s did not find), theft is thought to have been the motive for the killing. In the period leading up to his death, he was tortured by being hit with a hammer and having his back stamped or kneeled on, suffering broken ribs as a consequence. The cause of death was asphyxia, and it is believed he died the day before police found his body.[1] 10 January 1990 Bridget Brosnan Stevenage, Hertfordshire 70-year-old Brosnan died in a hospital's psychiatric ward. The nurse who reported the death claimed at first that Brosnan had suffered a cardiac arrest, but later changed her story to say that the deceased had used tights to hang herself from the bedhead. A Home Office pathologist concluded that Brosnan had struggled with an attacker before suffocating to death as a result of being pressed face-down into bedding. Nobody has been tried for Brosnan's murder or manslaughter, but the nurse and a colleague of hers did get convicted of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.[2] 17 January 1990 Doris Kellett Cleckheaton, West Yorkshire Kellett was a 92-year-old who was hammered to death in her own home. It is likely that the person who delivered the blows to her head had an accomplice, for a witness reported having seen two men (one with a clipboard) talking to Kellett on her doorstep about 45 minutes before her home help discovered her body. Her pension money was missing from the house, along with a ring and an amber paperweight. There are suspicions that her attacker tricked his way in by pretending to be a gasman or some other type of official.[3] January 1990 Surinder Gill Hounslow, London Gill, 33, was an insurance salesman who drove a distinctive modified dark red Mercedes with the index number 16 GLL. He was found stabbed to death in his car in Beavers Open Space, Hounslow, on 30 January 1990. Events surrounding his murder were reconstructed on Crimewatch in April 1990.[4] February 1990 Brian Fitzmaurice Oxford Road, Huyton, Liverpool 48-year-old Fitzmaurice was stabbed to death with a stiletto knife at or near his home on 3 February 1990. He had been walking home after a night out drinking and was attacked at around 12.20 am. No motive could be found.[5][6] February 1990 Richard Humphreys Body not found The 51-year-old taxi driver vanished on 3 February and his Ford Sierra was found abandoned with bloodstains inside it in a car park at Heathrow Airport (some miles from Whyteleafe, the Surrey village where he lived) on 12 February. A forensic re-examination of the car in 2012 did not give detectives the breakthrough they were hoping for.[7] February 1990 Joseph McEwan Slough, Berkshire 38-year-old McEwan was found dead or dying at his Aldridge Road home with bullet wounds to his head. Nine arrests were made over the Valentine's Day killing, but none of the arrested people was charged.[8] February 1990 Kevin Childerley Mansfield, Nottinghamshire Intruders armed with weapons attacked 29-year-old Kevin Childerley and his wife as they lay in bed, leading to his death and to her losing the sight in her right eye. Police charged two men with the murder of Mr Childerley and the attempted murder of Mrs Childerley, but when the case came to trial in 1991, they were cleared â€“ in part because the judge considered Mrs Childerley's testimony unreliable because a medical expert did not believe she had genuine memories of the attacks.[9][10][11] March 1990 Jack Royal Sunniside, Tyne and Wear Royal, 58, was killed with a shotgun in the porch of his house on 19 March 1990. The science teacher had himself killed someone in January 1987, although a jury accepted his claim that he had been acting in self-defence and found him not guilty accordingly. In April 1990, a local man was charged with Royal's murder. The 21-year-old's sister had, at the time of his death in 1987, been the partner of the man killed by Royal, and this was viewed as a motive. However, he was cleared in June 1991.[12]\n\nIn 1993, a second person was tried for Royal's murder. As with the previous defendant, someone close to him having a connection to the man Royal had fatally stabbed (in this case his girlfriend, who was the sister of that man) was viewed as a motive, and he spent nearly 14 years in prison for the murder before his conviction was overturned in 2007.[13]\n\nMarch 1990 Stephanie Whittaker Body not found, disappeared from Newport, Wales 34-year-old mother-of-three Whittaker disappeared from the home she shared with her husband in Newport, south east Wales after reportedly going out for a drink with a female friend on the evening of Friday, 23 March. She never arrived. Although a missing person case, her family and friends insisted she would not have left her husband and children, and four years later her case featured on the crime-solving programme Crimewatch, on which it was said to be a case in which a crime must be suspected and that detectives feared the worst. Whittaker had taken no money, clothes or documents with her. A 2024 Freedom of Information request confirmed that she was still missing.[14][15][16] March 1990 Ian Murray Erskine Upware, Cambridgeshire The body of Erskine, 44, was found in the River Cam at Upware on 25 March 1990. Erskine had last been seen on 15 December 1989 at his workplace, the Bank of England, in the City of London. It is not known if he returned to his home at 5 Norland Square, Notting Hill, that evening. Following his disappearance, Erskine's credit card was used to make a number of cash withdrawals from his account, hire a car, and purchase a watch and a five-day return ticket to the Netherlands. His body was found wrapped in plastic bags and the cause of his death could not be determined. Police suspected Erskine's murder was related to his homosexuality.[17] March 1990 Alexander Hayden Edinburgh Hayden had head injuries from a severe beating when he was found dead under a blanket in a city centre doorway on the morning of 31 March 1990. Detectives received new information in 1996, but it did not result in anyone being charged with the 41-year-old vagrant's murder.[18][19] April 1990 Dick Owen Sidney Johnson Lyne, Surrey 71-year-old Johnson was found dead in his caravan on 20 April 1990, having died of a heart attack during a robbery in which he was tied up. He had a large stash of expensive tack which was found to be missing.[20] April 1990 Anthony Burrows Liverpool Burrows and a friend got into a row with other people in the early hours of Friday 20 April 1990 after a visit to a nightclub in Speke. Said to have been trivial and over a taxi, the row escalated and led to a man being knocked to the ground, and 21-year-old Burrows and his companions returned to the establishment with a hammer later that night to exact revenge at his friend's instigation. A fight involving in excess of 10 people then ensued and culminated in Burrows having his neck stabbed with a broken bottle outside the club and bleeding to death from a severed carotid. A man admitted at trial that he kicked Burrows during the fight and was accordingly sentenced for violent disorder, but the jurors were directed by the judge to acquit the man and his two co-defendants all of murder.[21] April 1990 Michael Boothe Attacked in Hanwell, London, died in hospital Boothe, a 49-year-old actor, was set upon outside a toilet block in Elthorne Park on Sunday, 29 April. Seven people were taken in for questioning over the attack, but each of them was released without charge.[22] June 1990 Nick Whiting Rainham Marshes, Essex Whiting, 43, a former car-racing champion, was abducted from his car showroom in Wrotham (Kent) on Friday, 8 June and found dead in a shallow grave on Rainham Marshes a few weeks later. He had been beaten, gagged, tied up, put in the boot of a car and shot, police said.[23] June 1990 Leonard Gomm Hampton Gay, Oxfordshire Gomm, 75, was a taxi driver found stabbed to death in Hampton Gay, between Bletchingdon and Kidlington in Oxfordshire, at 10.50 am on 13 June 1990. His Ford Granada taxi was found five yards away. Gomm had radioed his employers four hours earlier (at about 6.35 am), telling them he was taking a passenger to Bicester. Police believe he picked up the fare from Gloucester Green, Oxford. Two witnesses saw the victim driving his taxi with a passenger at around that time. No money or valuables were taken from Gomm or his taxi, making the motive for his murder a mystery. On the 20th anniversary of the murder, Thames Valley Police reported the uncovering of new forensic evidence which could lead them to the killer.[24][25] June 1990 Trevaline Evans Body not found; disappeared from Llangollen, Denbighshire 52-year-old Evans vanished from the antiques shop she ran after leaving a note on the door that said she would be \"back in 2 minutes\". Her case is treated as an unsolved murder by North Wales Police and her husband was arrested in 2001 but later released without charge.[26][27] June 1990 Patricia Parsons Upshire, Essex Though an arrest over Parsons's murder took place in 2007, the case has since gone cold once more. The 42-year-old was a masseuse who ran a sauna in London, and reputedly had a judge and a TV presenter among her clients. When her body was found in her car near Epping Forest on 24 June 1990, there were three wounds to the head caused by the bow of a crossbow, along with injuries suggesting she had been beaten prior to her death. Police thought that Parsons's blue diary would contain clues as to who had killed her, but it has never turned up.[28][29] 3 August 1990 Ann Heron Aeolian House, Darlington, County Durham The 44-year-old mother-of-three had her throat slit while sunbathing outside her family home. Her husband Peter found her body and was later charged with her murder, but the case collapsed. Nobody else has been charged.[30][31] August 1990 Bill Webster Yalding, Kent 61-year-old Webster was covered in burning petrol and died after his home had two firebombs thrown into it on 7 August 1990.[32][33] August 1990 Brian Adams Derby 48-year-old Adams was the victim of a fatal shooting just outside his Alvaston home after returning there on his motorcycle on 14 August 1990. Why someone wanted him dead remains unclear.[34] August 1990 Paul Stevens Hayes, London 33-year-old Stevens was hit on the back on the head twice with a blunt instrument and then dumped in the Grand Union Canal behind the NestlÃ© factory in Hayes on 23 August 1990. He had been out drinking in the Chariot public house in Hounslow High Street and other pubs. Stevens was homosexual and very effeminate, and one theory was that he was killed in a homophobic attack. He still had money on him and had not been robbed. In 2002 the police asked for help in tracing a man who was about 25 and who drank in the Tankerville pub, saying he was athletic, over 6ft tall and with blond hair. He was believed to have been Australian or a New Zealander. The case featured on Crimewatch.[35] August 1990 Frank Harris Leeds Harris, 26, was stabbed to death at a street party following an argument about a sound system. The murder, which a Birmingham man went on trial for but was not found guilty of, happened not long after the West Indian Carnival (an event that has taken place in Leeds annually since 1967) had officially come to an end and just hours before Sedley Sullivan and Rachel Soloman were murdered in the same street â€“ a street fairly close to where people had earlier been enjoying the carnival proper.[36] August 1990 Sedley Sullivan and Rachel Soloman Leeds It is believed that Sullivan was the intended target of this possibly drugs-related shooting in Harehills Avenue, and that 18-year-old Soloman was killed by accident. Anthony Johnson (himself the victim of a gangland killing several months later) was suspected of being behind the double murder but not picked out at an identification parade.[37][38] September 1990 Gail Whitehouse Wolverhampton Someone strangled 23-year-old Whitehouse, a mother-of-two, and left her body in bushes in Wolverhampton's red-light district. Convicted serial rapist David Williams was acquitted of her murder in 1993.[39][40] September 1990 Andrew Pilch Elsing, Norfolk Pilch's wife reported finding him dead at their Church Street cottage on 13 September, and it was believed the 34-year-old had died from natural causes until a pathologist found that he had been strangled. Three men were cleared of his murder.[41][42] September 1990 Andrew Bedford Body not found Bedford went missing on 28 September 1990. He lived in Huntingdon and was last seen in Ramsey, and it is thought by the police that he is likely to have been killed with a gun. In 2015, they reopened the investigation into the disappearance of the 30-year-old, but in 2020 a police spokesman said the case was now back in the hands of Cambridgeshire Constabulary's cold case team as there were no more lines of inquiry to pursue.[43] October 1990 Judith Gold Hampstead, London On 20 October 1990, a newspaper boy found the body of 51-year-old financial adviser Judith Gold, also known as Judith Silver, yards from her own home after she left dressed for a business meeting.[44] She had died after receiving several blows to the left side of her face from an unidentified weapon.[44] After serial killer Levi Bellfield's 2008 convictions for the murders of two women in south west London with hammers, police announced they would be reviewing Gold's case, as they suspected it could be one of a number of unsolved attacks on women Bellfield was responsible for.[44][45] November 1990 Leslie Jackson Blackburn, Lancashire 70-year-old Jackson, a horse dealer living in a sheltered bungalow in Sussex Drive, was found beaten to death in his bathroom. He was thought to have kept large sums of money at his home, from which a watch and gold sovereign rings were missing following the murder. During their investigation, the police visited every jeweller, second-hand shop and pawn shop in the North West, searching for clues and traces of the known missing items.\n\nTwo people were charged in connection with Jackson's murder, but there was not enough evidence to prosecute. A third man who was also charged but whom the Crown Prosecution Service offered no evidence against later died, and his mother said that he never recovered from the trauma of his arrest and charge.\n\nAt the time of his murder, Jackson was suffering from cancer and did not have long to live.[46][47]\n\nNovember/December 1990 Patrick Hurling Hertford 45-year-old Hurling arrived home from work at approximately 11 pm on 30 November 1990 and was found beaten and strangled to death there early the next day. Charges did not follow any of the three arrests made in the hunt for the accountant's killer(s).[48] December 1990 Jan Mohammed Bradford, West Yorkshire Someone used a blunt instrument to batter Jan Mohammed about the head in his house in Manningham and then left the property locked on Thursday, 20 December. The victim, a 63-year-old widowed grandfather, was asleep on the sofa when the perpetrator attacked him.[49][50] December 1990 Steven Johnson Mow Cop, Cheshire/Staffordshire border Insurance salesman and part-time taxi driver Johnson, 25, was last sighted on 22 December at 3.30 am collecting a fare in Hanley and bound for Packmoor. A dog walker discovered his body 20 yards from his taxi four hours later. His throat had been cut, and none of his takings appeared to be missing.[51] December 1990 Edna Kilbride Leeds Kilbride, 70, was found dead at her home in Parkway Vale, Seacroft, on 30 December 1990. She had died the previous day and suffered facial injuries.[52][53] January 1991 Maria Requena Leigh, Greater Manchester 26-year-old Requena went missing on New Year's Day 1991, and her remains were found on 6 January in five plastic bin bags in the lake at Pennington Flash. She was a sex worker and the location where she was found is less than two miles from where the body of Linda Donaldson was discovered in 1988. A link with Donaldson's murder has been suggested,[54] as has a link with the 1994 murder of Julie Finley.[55] Police have investigated prostitute killer David Smith as a suspect in both Requena and Donaldson's cases.[56] January 1991 Wendy Gallagher Barnsley, South Yorkshire Wendy Gallagher, 24, was last seen in Barnsley town centre on Friday 18 January 1991. Her body was found the following Monday at her home on Princess Street. She had been strangled with an electrical cord. On the 30th anniversary of the discovery of Gallagher's body, police announced that items from the crime scene would be re-examined for previously undetected DNA traces.[57] February 1991 John Green Poole, Dorset 36-year-old Green suffered a frenzied stabbing in the office adjoining his shop, and his fiancÃ©e found his body there the next day. He was not known to have had any enemies, causing police to wonder if he had been murdered in a case of mistaken identity. Two men seen pushing Green into the shop on 1 February (the day of the killing) remain untraced.[58] February 1991 Janine Downes Shifnal, Shropshire Downes was a 22-year-old mother of three. Her body was found close to Lamberts Restaurant on the road between Shifnal and Wolverhampton on 2 February 1991. She had been strangled and had extensive head injuries, and some of her clothes were missing. Downes was a sex worker and was last seen alive in Wolverhampton's red-light district.[59] Police believe she may have been a victim of Alun Kyte.[60] February 1991 Cheryl Shackleton Brockley, London Shackleton, 34, was found beaten to death in Telegraph Hill Park on 3 February 1991. Her handbag was missing and police believe she may have been sexually assaulted. It was not known why Shackleton was in Brockley, as she had no ties to the area. She lived an itinerant lifestyle and carried all her belongings in a suitcase, which was never traced. Shackleton's murder was featured on Crimewatch in February 1991 and April 2006.[61][62] February 1991 Anthony \"White Tony\" Johnson Cheetham Hill, Manchester Known as \"White Tony\" to avoid confusion with a black associate also called Tony, he was shot dead on 22 February in the Penny Black pub's car park. A companion was also shot, but not killed. Desmond Noonan was tried for the murder twice (along with alleged accomplices, including a brother at the first trial), and the prosecution claimed that Johnson had been murdered because someone had threatened to complain to him about Noonan taking half of his share of the money from an armed robbery. However, each trial collapsed due to a hung jury.\n\nAged 22 at the time of his death, Johnson was the nephew of moors murders victim Keith Bennett, and had begun to embark on a life of crime within a few years of leaving school.[38]\n\nMarch 1991 Gordon Rogers Attacked in Guildford, Surrey, died in hospital Rogers was shot in the leg on 21 February 1991 as he attempted to stop robbers stealing money from the bank where he worked as a security guard. Â£25,000 in cash was taken by them, and the 63-year-old victim succumbed to his injuries two weeks later.[63][64] March 1991 Ahmet Abdullah Walworth, London Jurors cleared two brothers of the murder of the Turkish drug dealer, who had been shot on 11 March 1991 â€“ first inside a betting shop, then again in the street after leaving the building.[65] March 1991 Duncan Clift Struck by a car in Hexham, Northumberland, died in hospital in Newcastle Clift, 27, a Kent Police officer who had travelled to Northumberland to visit family, was standing in front of a car in a bid to prevent theft of the vehicle when its driver purposely ran him down. He died on 24 March â€“ two days after the incident, which happened in a car park. A jury found a man charged over Clift's death not guilty of his murder or manslaughter.[66] March 1991 Peter Rasini Palmers Green, London A tall and heavily built man shot the 44-year-old antique dealer outside his home with a .45 calibre automatic pistol on 24 March 1991 before running away and leaving in a van that had been parked in nearby Oaktree Avenue.[67] April 1991 Alan Leppard Monkton, Kent 43-year-old Leppard was shot in the chest on 1 April 1991 (Easter Monday) after answering a knock on the door. Brenda Long, his partner, heard the bang and rushed to the door to find out the cause of it. She was also murdered at home just under nine months later. With no evidence that either of them had done anything illegal or was prone to making enemies, the reasons for the killings remain as much a mystery as the identities of the persons behind them.[68] April 1991 Jo Ramsden Near Lyme Regis, Dorset Ramsden, 21, went missing from Bridport, Dorset, on 9 April 1991. She was last seen with an unknown male who was nicknamed \"Mr Zig Zag\" by the press due to the patterned sweater he was described as wearing. Ramsden's body was found in the same clothes she wore on the day she went missing, in woodland by the A35 near Lyme Regis, by two forestry workers on 12 March 1992.[69]\n\nA former psychiatric nurse from Charminster, Dorset, was sentenced at the Old Bailey to nine concurrent terms of life imprisonment on 10 February 1994 for the kidnap, rape and attempted rape of a number of disabled women. He was also charged with the kidnap of Ramsden; however, due to insufficient evidence, the case was dismissed at a pre-trial hearing.[70]\n\nApril 1991 Carl Stapleton Manchester Four men charged over the murder of Stapleton, a 17-year-old attacked with a machete in Moss Side on 29 April 1991, walked free from court after the prosecution offered no evidence.[71] May 1991 Glenda Potter Rochester, Kent Someone strangled 32-year-old Potter and left her body near the United Reformed Church in Crow Lane, Rochester in May 1991. Potter was a sex worker and her murder featured on Crimewatch. Police re-examined the case in 2010, stating that they had DNA from the scene.[72] June 1991 Alison Shaughnessy Battersea, London Bank clerk Shaughnessy was knifed over 50 times on the stairway to her flat on 3 June 1991. Two sisters were convicted of murdering the 21-year-old and sentenced to life imprisonment in July 1992, but in June 1993, aged 22 and 19, they had their convictions quashed. The older sister and Shaughnessy's husband had formerly been having an affair (though both claimed it had ended by the time of the killing â€“ something the police did not accept), and the accusation at trial was that that sister, fuelled by jealousy, had stabbed Shaughnessy while the younger sister stood guard. Used as evidence against the older sister was an entry from her 1990 diary stating that her \"dream solution would be for Alison to disappear as if she never existed\".[73][74][75] June 1991 Penny Bell Perivale, London The body of the victim, a 43-year-old businesswoman and mother of two, was found in her car in the car park of Gurnell Leisure Centre by two women who initially thought she was asleep. She had been stabbed 50 times as she sat behind the wheel of the vehicle.[76] June 1991 Lynne Trenholm Chester Trenholm, 29, was found stabbed to death in Pinky's massage parlour in Boughton, Chester, on 9 June 1991. Despite there being a solid fingerprint recovered from the scene, the police have no suspects and appeals are still made in an effort to solve her murder.[77] June 1991 Sandy Drummond Fife, Scotland Reclusive Drummond, 33, was found dead on a farm track close to the home he shared with his brother â€“ an isolated cottage near St Andrews, Fife â€“ on 24 June 1991. In the days previous, Drummond withdrew a large amount of his life savings from various building societies, although the money was later found in the house. He also resigned from his job four days prior to his death. On the day itself, he was seen running from his house to fields opposite, carrying a blue sports bag which has never been found. A man with a blood-stained bandage wrapped around his hand was seen at approximately 2.30 pm that day on a bus near to Drummond's cottage. This man was never traced. Several times before Drummond's death (and twice on the actual day, according to some reports), a red or orange Morris Marina was seen parked outside the cottage, but it is still unknown who owned this car or who was visiting him. Drummond's death was regarded as natural until neck injuries became apparent during the post mortem examination.[78] July 1991 Alan Brooks Loughton, Essex Former international boxer Brooks, 53, died on 16 July when a gang stabbed him at one of the two Loughton pubs he ran with his wife. A suspected motive was retaliation for him having barred a group of men from one of the establishments the previous week.[79] July 1991 Sheila Egner Nottingham At Yeomans Army Stores (where Egner was working) on Mansfield Road, the 62-year-old was hit over the head repeatedly with a bottle or hammer and the till drawer, which contained about Â£250, was then carried off after being wrapped in green curtain. The drawer was found dumped and empty in a garden in Basford the following day (27 July).[80] Several witnesses saw the man walking off with the till drawer wrapped in the curtain, he was described as being between 40 and 50 years old, meaning he would be in his 70s or 80s as of the 2020s.[81] August 1991 David Brindle and Stanley Silk Walworth, London Brindle, 23, and Silk, 47, died after two masked men opened fire in The Bell, a public house on East Street, on 3 August 1991. Brindle had two brothers who had recently been charged over the March 1991 murder of Ahmet Abdullah, but whether that was the reason for the shooting at The Bell is not known.[82] August 1991 Sharon Hoare Fulham, London 19-year-old Hoare moved from her home in Bristol to London, where she worked as a sex worker for escort agencies. Her flatmate found her dead in her bedroom at their home on Brompton Park Crescent, Fulham. She had been throttled and bludgeoned. Hoare's boyfriend was questioned but released without charge. On 16 August, six days after Hoare's death, another sex worker was attacked at her home in nearby Kensington, and it was suggested the two attacks could be connected.[83] A link has been suggested between Hoare's murder and Anthony Hardy, the \"Camden Ripper\".[84] August 1991 Brendan Penn Bradford, West Yorkshire Father-of-three Penn, 22, was stabbed in the heart after running into a group of people already involved in a street affray. A detective later noted that he thought there were people with important information about the murder who were unwilling to come forward because they wrongly believed Penn to have been an aggressor.[85] August 1991 Arthur Thompson Glasgow Arthur Thompson was the 31-year-old son of the Scottish gangster with the same name and died outside his parents' home on 17 August when a car pulled up there and an occupant or occupants of the vehicle shot him. A man was found not guilty of the murder.[86] August 1991 Andrew Elphick Body not found The disappearance of 21-year-old Elphick began to be treated as murder in 1995. Elphick was last seen in Brookwood, Surrey on 23 August 1991, and his car was found abandoned in Slough â€“ approximately 18 miles away â€“ the following day. He worked in a shop in Woking and lived in Normandy. In 1995, three men were arrested in connection with Elphick's disappearance, but no charges were brought against any of them.[87] August 1991 Vera Anderson Warrington, Cheshire 42-year-old Anderson was found dead in her Ford Cortina on Tannery Lane, Penketh, Warrington, on 25 August 1991. Her throat had been cut.[54] Anderson had last been seen the previous day at her home on Hadfield Close, Widnes. That evening, she received a telephone call, then left her six-year-old son with a neighbour. It was not expected that she would be gone for long.[88] August 1991 Nicholas Hanscomb London Hanscomb died in the early hours of 26 August at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington after a member of a group of youths stabbed the 38-year-old scientist in the groin at the Notting Hill Carnival. Part of Hanscomb's work as a scientist was to help develop the DNA genetic fingerprint test.[89] September 1991 Brenda Cross Attacked in Chelsea, London, died in hospital 73-year-old Cross was fatally beaten on 4 September 1991 in the basement of Anno Domini, the antiques shop she worked in on Pimlico Road. Police said she had clearly put up a ferocious fight with her attacker but she later died of her injuries in hospital. The murder weapons were antique fire irons in the basement of the shop. The shop's owner was tried for the murder but acquitted on the order of the judge, who said that the evidence showed it was inherently improbable that the owner was the killer. The owner had allegedly been in a bad mood as Cross was planning to leave and he had not found a replacement, and he was also stressed because he had had to pay Â£40,000 in back rent and arrangements for a new lease on the premises were becoming difficult. The shop owner was a retired actor and had appeared in the hospital soap opera Emergency Ward 10.[90][91] September 1991 Andrew Smith Glasgow 23-year-old Smith was discovered stabbed to death beside the Forth and Clyde Canal at Maryhill soon after midnight on 10 September 1991. Police suspected a man called Mark Vass to have been the assailant but never had enough evidence to charge him with the crime. Vass was later shot twice in the legs and then in the head by Eamonn Docherty, who pled guilty to the murder of Vass in 1996.[92][93] September 1991 Sarah Bowdler Walsall, West Midlands Bowdler, a 68-year-old charity worker and widow, was found strangled in her bedroom at her home on Somers Road, Pleck, Walsall, on 17 September 1991. No motive for her murder was established: nothing had been stolen and the fact that there was no sign of a break-in suggested that Bowdler had let her killer into her home.[94] September 1991 Bobby Glover and Joe Hanlon Glasgow 31-year-old Glover and 23-year-old Hanlon were two of three men due to stand trial for the August 1991 murder of Arthur Thompson Jnr when they were fatally shot on the night of 18 September. Their bodies were left near a Shettleston pub after the killings â€“ killings thought to have been carried out in revenge for the murder they were suspected of involvement in.[95][86] October 1991 The Bolney Torso Bolney, Sussex In October 1991 a body was discovered in woodland off Broxmead Lane in Bolney, Sussex. The head and hands had been removed and the victim was never identified. In March 2009 police exhumed the body and gave a revised description of the victim. He was between 5 ft 6 and 5 ft 8 ins tall, well built and aged 35â€“45. Police also issued pictures of his clothing, including a light-blue shirt with a distinctive motif on its pocket.[96][97] October 1991 Diane McInally Glasgow McInally, 23, was last seen getting into a car with two men in Cadogan Street, Glasgow, on 15 October 1991. Her body was found in woodland in the city's Pollok Park and she had been strangled. Two men were charged with the sex worker's murder, but there was not enough evidence for either to stand trial. In 2017, McInally's son called for the investigation into his mother's murder to be reopened, claiming he had new evidence.[98] October 1991 Barbara Finn Body not found Sex worker Finn, 33, vanished from her usual area of work in Hillfields, Coventry on 28 October 1991. She took a prescription of methadone and it is unlikely that she would not have come home for more. Police suspect that she, along with fellow Hillfields sex worker Marie Garrity, who disappeared in 1995, may have been a victim of known prostitute killer Alun Kyte, the \"Midlands Ripper\".[99][100][101] It has been noted that she disappeared at about the same time as another woman, Nicola Payne, vanished from Coventry, although it was also highlighted that their lifestyles were completely separate and it is believed their cases are not connected.[101] October 1991 Darren Samuel Manchester Samuel, 19, was shot on 29 October 1991 at the Cottage Bakery in Moss Side. Two men were cleared of the offence when a potential trial witness failed to attend court.[102][103] November 1991 Dave Rowbotham Manchester 33-year-old Rowbotham, a former member of the bands The Durutti Column, The Mothmen and Motivation, was axed to death in early November in his flat on Grangethorpe Drive, Burnage.[104][105] November 1991 Sharon Tyler Tilney All Saints, Norfolk 24-year-old Tyler was knifed to death at her home on 12 November. Hairs she had in her hand when discovered dead in the kitchen not being tested as well as they could have been, together with a forensic expert's case notes being altered and his failure to treat two bloodspots on the murder weapon separately, meant that the conviction of a man found guilty of murdering her was later deemed unsafe. (It was not possible to retest the hairs to establish whether they were his as they were destroyed long before his retrial.)[106] December 1991 Jim Morrison Aldwych, London Detective Constable Morrison, 26, was off duty on 13 December when he attempted to arrest a man suspected of stealing bags from pub customers. He chased the subject from Covent Garden to Aldwych, where he was stabbed three times. A reward of Â£30,000 was offered on the 30th anniversary of DC Morrison's death in December 2021.[107] December 1991 Nicola Payne Body not found Payne, aged 18, went missing from the Henley Green area of Coventry on 14 December 1991. She was on her way to her parents' house from her home in Winston Avenue. She had a six-month-old son at the time of her disappearance. In June 2012 police began a search of parkland after being given new information.[108] On 20 June 2012, Nigel Barwell and his brother-in-law Thomas O'Reilly were arrested by the police[109] but later released.[110] On 27 January 2015, Barwell and O'Reilly were charged with her murder.[111] However, on 16 November 2015, they were found not guilty.[112] A tent which appeared to show DNA evidence against the defendants had been stored in uncertain conditions for a month and cross-contamination was therefore possible.[113] December 1991 Brenda Long Whitstable, Kent Because there was a suicide note next to the bath in which 42-year-old Long's body was found on 28 December 1991 and an empty pill pot was in the bath as well, foul play was not suspected to begin with, but an examination of the body by a pathologist revealed that someone had caused her to fall unconscious by holding an ether-soaked pad over her nose before drowning her. The murder followed that of her partner Alan Leppard in April of the same year, and his is also still unsolved.[68] December 1991 Kathleen Waugh Derwent Reservoir, Derbyshire Waugh, a 41-year-old woman with an intellectual disability, was discovered to be missing from Knowl House care home, in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, on the morning of 28 December 1991. Her body was found seven weeks later in a reservoir nearly 25 miles away. One of the officers of the home was arrested then released; she denied all charges against her. Waugh's murder was explored in March 1996 in Network First: The Killing of Kathleen Waugh â€“ an episode of an ITV documentary series.[114][115] January 1992 Perry Wenham Ipswich, Suffolk Two men were charged with the murder of Wenham, but the judge at their trial ruled in their favour, describing the case against them as \"deplorably weak\". The case rested mainly on the fact that, on the night of the murder, the men were seen with Wenham in the town centre when he was still alive before being seen without him and walking away rather quickly from the lane whose church's graveyard his stabbed body was later found in â€“ a lane also in the centre of town. During a police interview, one of them admitted seeing 31-year-old Wenham get punched to the ground that night but denied hurting him himself in any way.[116] January/February 1992 Tracey Meade Grand Union Canal, London On 20 January 1992, 14-year-old Meade said goodbye to her mother and left the home they shared, apparently for one of her frequent visits to her aunt's flat nearby. Meade never arrived, and 12 days later her body was found in the Grand Union Canal. She had drowned but was found to have been stabbed twice, and police think there may have been a sexual motive as she was only partially dressed and some of her clothes were found elsewhere. A reconstruction was featured on Crimewatch in April 1992,[117] but police are no nearer to finding the killer(s). March 1992 Derek Ure Greenock, Inverclyde Security guard Ure, 21, was shot on 26 March 1992 as an attempt was being made to rob a security van in Greenock town centre. The attempt ended in failure.[118] Two men were acquitted of his murder at a trial where one of them claimed that contact with the vehicle prior to the incident could be why a fingerprint belonging to him was found on a car used to get away from the crime scene.[119] In September 1995, this man â€“ Mark Vass â€“ was himself shot dead.[93] March 1992 Beatrice Greig Nottingham 79-year-old Greig was found battered to death at her home in Loughrigg Close, The Meadows, Nottingham, on 28 March 1992.[120] Her daughter was convicted of the murder, but the conviction was quashed in 1996 and a retrial ordered. Greig's daughter was convicted a second time at the retrial in 1997, but this conviction was quashed the following year.[121] April 1992 Jacqueline Palmer-Radford Eversley, Hampshire The 40-year-old was found dead in her kitchen by her elder son on Wednesday 1 April 1992, having been asphyxiated while he was at school earlier that day. Nothing was stolen from the house and there was no sign of forced entry, leading investigators to consider it likely that the perpetrator was known to her.[122] April 1992 Michael Schallamach Body not found After Schallamach vanished in Southampton, his wife received a letter posted in France and purportedly from a woman he had left her for, but the police, having long been of the opinion that he had been murdered by the time the letter was written, do not believe it was authentic. In 2016, two men jailed in 2005 for killing a family in 2003 were named as prime suspects in the murder of 53-year-old Schallamach.[123] May 1992 Amanda Duffy Hamilton, South Lanarkshire The body of the 19-year-old Scottish student was found in bushes on wasteland near the car park on Miller Street during the evening of Saturday 30 May. A pathologist estimated her death to have taken place between six-and-a-half and 18-and-a-half hours prior to the discovery. There were compression marks on Duffy's neck along with branches and twigs in her orifices, and a lack of defensive injuries indicated that she was unconscious when the objects were being inserted into her.[124][125] June 1992 James Crowther Attacked in Birkenhead, Merseyside, died at Walton Hospital in Liverpool Newlywed Crowther, 23, was fatally assaulted in Hamilton Street in the early hours of Sunday 28 June after visiting Liverpool for a stag night. An appeal was later made for a woman who had phoned to give information that concerned the incident to get back in touch.[126][127] July 1992 John Bowkett Body not found 37-year-old Bowkett, who was married and had a two-year-old daughter, disappeared without explanation on 12 July 1992 from his home on Welfare Road, Woodlands, Doncaster, South Yorkshire. His family say that \"foul play\" is suspected and say there was no reason for him to disappear. He also had two children from a previous marriage.[128] c. July 1992 Yvonne Fitt Lindley, North Yorkshire Fitt was found dead in woodland near Otley on 12 September 1992 after being stabbed in the chest and back. Her murder was featured on Crimewatch that year and in 2019 police appealed to an anonymous caller who provided information after the broadcast to call again. Fitt was a 33-year-old mother-of-one who was a sex worker in Leeds and Bradford's red-light districts,[129] and it is suspected that she was murdered by the killer of Leanne Tiernan.[130] July 1992 Christopher Stanley Hounslow, London Nine-year-old Christopher Stanley was last seen on 29 July 1992 talking with a friend and a neighbour on St Aubyn's Avenue, Hounslow. His body was found the next day in a wartime pillbox on Hounslow Heath; he had been strangled. A man stood trial for Stanley's murder the following year but was acquitted.[131][132] July 1992 Helen Gorrie Horndean, Hampshire 15-year-old Gorrie was found half-naked and strangled on 2 August in the grounds of Merchistoun Hall in Horndean. The hall was in the same village as her home, which she had left three nights previously to see a 21-year-old man named John Corcoran. She had also seen him on the night of 29 July as he cruised around the area in his vehicle, and he later telephoned her to ask her to meet him. Corcoran was convicted of strangling Gorrie after she had rebuffed his sexual advances. He was released on appeal in 2003 after serving around three years. The police revealed that there were no grounds to re-open the investigation, indicating that they still believed Corcoran was responsible, but the case is now technically unsolved.[133][134][135] August 1992 Michael Towler Bradford, West Yorkshire 57-year-old Towler was found fatally stabbed in the living room of his home on Holly Street, Horton Bank Top, Bradford, on the morning of 6 August 1992. Neighbours had heard noises coming from his home the previous evening and a man had been seen acting suspiciously nearby. Towler's video recorder was stolen.[136] September 1992 Steven Preston Body not found 23-year-old Preston disappeared after waving to his mother as she left their home on Heath Road, Bebington, Wirral, to go to work on 18 September 1992. In 2017 police searched fields close to the M53 motorway at nearby Eastham after a tip-off suggested he could be buried somewhere around where junction 5 of the motorway meets New Chester Road. Police subsequently said they believed he may have been murdered and buried.[137][138] October 1992 Kevin Coniam Mansfield, Nottinghamshire The body of Coniam, a 36-year-old Kent-born lorry driver, was found in his Volvo estate car on 5 October 1992 in woodland close to the northern outskirts of Mansfield. He had been strangled, and police think it was by someone he had been associating with for drug-related reasons.[139] November 1992 Natalie Pearman Norwich, Norfolk 16-year-old Pearman was strangled and her body dumped in woodland at Ringland Hills, on the edge of Norwich. A lorry driver taking a short cut through Ringland Hills spotted the body in a lay-by at around 3.45 am on 20 November.[140] New information about the case was received in November 2012.[141] A link to serial prostitute killer Steve Wright had been suggested, but in 2017 police revealed they had a full DNA profile of Pearman's murderer and that solving her murder was simply a case of matching the profile to an individual.[142][143] November 1992 Andre Blackman Stoke Newington, London 25-year-old Blackman was shot dead in the early hours of 30 November 1992 during a party at a community hall in Millers Terrace, Stoke Newington. A man who was alleged to have had an argument with him at the party but who denied being there was found guilty of his murder in August 1993, but he appealed the following year and had his conviction overturned after a witness admitted that her memories of the party were hazy and she could not be certain that he did in fact attend. The community hall being dimly lit, the party's disc jockey having no recollection of seeing the defendant there that night and the apparent failure of the original trial's judge to direct the jury properly as he summed up were also noted at the appeal hearing.[144] November/December 1992 Harold Smith, Mary Smith and Harold Smith Jnr Birmingham Harold Smith, 72, his wife Mary, 73, and their son Harold Jnr, 47, who was paralysed and used a wheelchair,[145] were found murdered in a bedroom of their home in Overbury Close, Northfield, Birmingham, on 2 December 1992. They had been bound, beaten and stabbed with a small knife. Nothing appeared to have been stolen and the motive remains a mystery. Criminal psychologist Paul Britton suggested the culprit(s) could have been aged between 14 and 25 and had good knowledge of the area.[146] December 1992 Johanna Young Watton, Norfolk 14-year-old Young left her home in Merton Road, Watton, at around 7.30 pm on 23 December 1992 and was seen outside her local fish and chip shop half an hour later. The police were called the following morning because she had not turned up for her paper round and on Boxing Day her body was found in a water-filled marlpit near where her shoes and underwear had been discarded.[147][148] December 1992 Steven Clark Body not found Clark, who was 23 and had disabilities from a road accident during childhood, was for many years thought to have last been seen in Saltburn (a small town on the North Yorkshire coast) at around 3 pm on 28 December 1992, but in September 2020 a woman contacted the police to say she had walked past him near his Marske home 45 minutes or so later. (Marske is about two miles from Saltburn.) This new piece of information followed the revelation that Clark's parents had recently been arrested on suspicion of his murder before being bailed. Both strongly denied being behind his disappearance.[149][150] January 1993 Benji Stanley Moss Side, Manchester 14-year-old Stanley was shot dead whilst in a takeaway with a friend on Saturday 2 January. Though police found no evidence to support rumours that he had been involved in the trading of illegal drugs, they did reveal that they believed the shooter might have mistaken him for a drug dealer, and in 2011 disclosed the name of a dealer they thought likely to have been the intended target â€“ someone of similar appearance to Stanley. Another theory is that the intended target was the friend who was with Stanley in the takeaway that day, as Stanley was on the other boy's bicycle and had that boy's jacket on when the gunman struck.[151] January 1993 Ivan Dunn Chorleywood, Hertfordshire 56-year-old Dunn was found dead with serious head injuries in a lay-by early on 7 January 1993. He had no fixed address and the last sighting of him was in the centre of Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire the previous afternoon. Investigators initially believed that Dunn was the victim of a road traffic accident, but it was later established that he was murdered.[152][153][154] 21 January 1993 Arthur Brumhill Northampton 76-year-old Brumhill's body was found in the basement of the pet and garden centre on Wellingborough Road, where he worked part time, by a fellow employee. He had died from several blows to the head, possibly inflicted with a tyre iron missing from the scene. The killer is suspected to have escaped out of an upstairs window with a small amount of money taken. A witness described seeing Brumhill with a man in his teens with \"mousey-brown\" hair and about 5 feet 5 inches (1.65 m) tall in the shop on the evening of the murder. Despite the case appearing on Crimewatch and several arrests being made, the case remains unsolved to this day.\n\nOn 21 January 2013, the 20th anniversary of the murder, police announced they were reviewing the case and hoped that advances in forensic analysis and DNA profiling would bring the killer to justice.[155] A former colleague of Brumhill's stood trial for his murder but was found not guilty in March 2017.[156]\n\nJanuary 1993 Stacey Queripel Bracknell, Berkshire The body of seven-year-old Queripel was found in woodland by South Hill Park on the night of 24 January 1993. She had been strangled with her necklace. It is believed she was murdered elsewhere because her shoes were clean but the ground where she was found was muddy. Queripel's mother was arrested in connection with her murder but released without charge.[157] February 1993 Doris Shelley Attacked in Martlesham, Suffolk, died at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge Concerned for her welfare because she had not answered the door to a woman attempting to deliver shopping to her, a neighbour took the decision to enter Shelley's bungalow by breaking a lounge window. Inside, he found the 82-year-old widow cowering in her kitchen. A blunt instrument had been used to strike her head with considerable force, and she died in hospital 10 days later, on 21 February.[158][159] February 1993 Bulic Forsythe Clapham, London Forsythe, 42, was last seen on 24 February 1993 by his colleagues at Lambeth Social Services. There was concern when he did not arrive for work the following day, and that night, his flat at Foster Court, Clapham Park Road, was deliberately set on fire. Forsythe's body was discovered by firefighters in the early hours of 26 February, and the cause of his death was found to have been a fractured skull. It has been suggested that he was murdered because he planned to expose widespread abuse at Lambeth Council's children's homes.[160][161] March 1993 Richard Miles Stonehouse, Gloucestershire The 29-year-old panel beater's mother found his body in their back garden during the afternoon of 10 March 1993. In an apparently motiveless killing, Miles had suffered a single stab wound to the heart sometime after having arrived home for lunch from his workplace that day. Three men arrested in 2013 in connection with the murder â€“ two on suspicion of being his killers, the third on suspicion of perverting the course of justice â€“ all ended up being released without charge.[162] March 1993 Jean Bradley Acton, London Bradley was a 47-year-old businesswoman stabbed to death in Carbery Avenue, Acton, on 25 March 1993. A man was charged, but the case against him was dropped.[163][164] March 1993 Carol Clark Sharpness, Gloucestershire 32-year-old Clark was last seen in Montpelier, Bristol, on 26 March 1993. Her body was found two days later, 30 miles away at Sharpness docks. She had been strangled and her body was partially clothed. Clark had been a sex worker and her murder was featured on the BBC programme Crimewatch in the summer of 1993. Among those questioned in connection with her murder were convicted killers Alun Kyte and Philip John Smith.[165] In April 2023 a 66-year-old man was arrested and then bailed over Clark's murder after \"new and significant information\" had emerged.[166] April 1993 Karen McGregor Glasgow McGregor, 29, was battered and strangled on 18 April 1993 and her body was found hidden in the car park of the Scottish Exhibition Centre days later. In 1994, her husband stood trial for her murder, but the charge was found not proven. McGregor was a sex worker and links have been suggested between her death and the unsolved murders of other sex workers in Glasgow in the 1990s.[167][168][169] June 1993 Jimmy Moody Hackney, London 52-year-old James Alfred Moody, known as Jimmy and himself suspected of murder, was shot dead with a revolver in a pub on the fringes of Victoria Park on Tuesday, 1 June. He had been on the run since escaping from prison in 1980.[170] June 1993 Edna Waller Sheffield 79-year-old Waller suffered fatal blunt-force trauma whilst being robbed in Bramwell Gardens, Netherthorpe, on Friday, 18 June. She lived in the same road.[171] June 1993 Tommy Roche Near Heathrow Airport, London Roche, 42, was shot on 21 June 1993 by a man on a motorcycle. His death was not thought to be linked to the January 1993 murder of his associate Donald Urquhart, for which a hired killer was jailed for life.[172][173][174] June 1993 Michelle McKnight Berwick-upon-Tweed, Northumberland 29-year-old McKnight was discovered with two stab wounds on the drive of her home on 27 June 1993. A court would later find not guilty of her murder a man with whom she was in a relationship when she suffered the attack.[175][176] July 1993 Amanda Duncan Body not found Although the body of 26-year-old Duncan has never been found, police are treating her disappearance as a murder enquiry. Duncan was a sex worker and was last seen in the Portman Road area of Ipswich on 2 July 1993. In 2018, on the 25th anniversary of her disappearance, Suffolk Constabulary made a new appeal for information.[177] A link has been suggested to serial East Anglia prostitute killer Steve Wright.[178] July 1993 Javad Iqbal Brixton, London 37-year-old Iqbal was stabbed in the back outside his shop on 9 July. A 22-year-old man who was a cousin of Iqbal's minder was tried for the murder after the minder's lover claimed to have seen him leaving the murder scene while looking out of a window. Her evidence was considered unreliable by the court.[179] July 1993 Harry and Megan Tooze Llanharry, South Wales Harry Tooze, 64, and his wife Megan, 67, were shot at point-blank range with a shotgun at their home at Ty ar y Waun Farm on 26 July 1993. Jonathan Jones, the boyfriend of their daughter Cheryl, was convicted of their murders, but the verdict was quickly overturned on appeal. Since then South Wales Police have made several attempts to solve this case, but no further arrests have been made.[180] A link has been suggested between the murders and serial killer John Cooper, responsible for the Pembrokeshire murders.[181][182] September 1993 Mark Jarrett Crystal Palace, London Jarrett, a cocaine and cannabis dealer aged 29, was shot dead at his flat in Palace Road on 14 September 1993. His best friend then went into hiding, but said after being charged with the murder â€“ a charge he would be acquitted of â€“ that he had absconded out of fear of the killer.[183] October 1993 Gurbax Kaur Sandhu Derby Sandhu, a 30-year-old mother-of-two, was strangled to death on 19 October 1993 at her property in the district of Normanton. A red car that detectives wished to trace was seen parked that day in the same road as the victim's home.[184][185] October 1993 John Culshaw Wigan, Greater Manchester 24-year-old Culshaw was discovered knifed to death at his Wigan home on 23 October 1993, and his girlfriend's sister was later found not guilty of his murder or manslaughter. It had been alleged that she had killed him because she believed he had harmed her sister's baby son.[186][187] October 1993 David Clarke Maida Vale, London Clarke, 23, was shot and gold rings were stolen from him in Bravington Road, Maida Vale, on 29 October 1993. A man who was not known to him was cleared of both offences.[188] November 1993 Karen Hales Ipswich, Suffolk 21-year-old Hales was stabbed and her body set on fire during an attack at her home in Lavenham Road, Ipswich, on 21 November 1993. The attack was almost certainly witnessed by her 19-month-old daughter.[189] November 1993 Glenn Ford Birmingham Ford, 35, was last seen alive on 22 November in his home city of Coventry and found shot to death in the yard of a deserted factory in the Saltley area of Birmingham the next day, apparently after having been lured there. A reopening of the case in 2009 led to four men being charged over his murder in 2010, but police dropped the charges following advice from the Crown Prosecution Service that the chances of a conviction were not high enough to justify putting any of the men on trial.[190] November 1993 Paul Hamilton Glasgow The 35-year-old was shot as he was driving his car in the Riddrie district of Glasgow on 23 November, and there has been speculation that it was because he had given an alibi the previous year for the man standing trial for Arthur Thompson Jnr's 1991 murder.[191] November 1993 Davina McMillan Body not found 36-year-old McMillan disappeared on 25 November 1993 from the home she shared with her four-year-old daughter in Godmanchester, Cambridgeshire. She was reported missing a month later by her brother. In 2020 it was reported that police were treating her case as a murder inquiry, with there being no evidence of her being still alive and her bank accounts not having been touched since the day she vanished. Her family say she would never have left her young daughter and mother and must have been murdered.[192] December 1993 Adnan Al-Sane Manchester The Kuwaiti's headless body was discovered at Manchester's Piccadilly Station on 17 December 1993 and his head in a school playing field at Cheslyn Hay in Staffordshire on 27 January 1994 â€“ parts of England to which he had no links. His home was in London's Maida Vale area, and it was after a meeting with a Kuwaiti business associate in a Mayfair hotel on 14 December 1993 that he disappeared. Police thought a financial motive was behind the murder of the 46-year-old billionaire and former banker.[193] December 1993 Paul Logan Blue House Farm, Northumberland On 23 December 1993, Logan's workplace, a takeaway in Consett, received a call from a nearby phone box requesting the delivery of food to a house in the countryside. With no cause to suspect that the call was not genuine, the 25-year-old took the food there, only to be told that no one living there had placed the order. Logan was bludgeoned to death soon after walking away from the house, his body being found by police a few hours later on farmland within its grounds. The police had been called to the farm because the owners realised that Logan's car had not left there.[194] December 1993 Viv Graham Attacked in Wallsend, died in hospital in North Shields (both in Tyne and Wear) Graham, 34, was fatally shot after leaving a pub on Wallsend High Street on 31 December 1993. He was well known locally as an organised crime figure and reportedly received a death threat shortly before he was murdered.[195] January 1994 Julian Stewart Manchester 21-year-old Stewart was shot in the head in Radley Walk, Moss Side, on 12 January 1994. A car then sped away from the scene. The killing was believed to have been a gangland one and happened the month after his body armour prevented a bullet from hitting him.[196] January 1994 Sarah Lewin Huddersfield, West Yorkshire Lewin, 35, was bludgeoned at her home in Bradley Boulevard, Sheepridge, Huddersfield, on 14 January 1994. It is believed that she may have known her killer and her murder could have had a connection to her involvement in the supply of amphetamines. Lewin's brothers made a new plea for information in 2018.[197] February 1994 Claude Moseley Stoke Newington, London The 32-year-old former athletics champion was stabbed with a samurai sword in early February 1994. Gilbert Wynter, who would go missing in 1998 and may himself be a murder victim, was tried for the killing but acquitted following a key witness's refusal to testify.[198] February 1994 Danny Ferguson Bedford 32-year-old Ferguson was shot in the head at his bedsit on the night of 20â€“21 February. Five men were charged with and subsequently acquitted of violent disorder in relation to a fight in the building the day before Ferguson was found murdered there, and the fight was believed to be connected with his murder.[199] March 1994 Mehmet Kaygisiz Islington, London Kaygisiz, 33, was shot as he played backgammon at a cafÃ© on 18 March 1994. Police said at the time that they believed his death to be linked to Britain's Turkish underworld, but documents disclosed in Turkey in 2016 suggested that Kaygisiz's murder was ordered by Turkish authorities because he had ties to what they regarded as a terrorist group.[200] March 1994 Trevor Monerville Stoke Newington, London 26-year-old Monerville was stabbed by five men on Trumans Road, Stoke Newington, on 19 March 1994.[201] April 1994 Josephine Berrington Wallington, London 34-year-old Berrington was found dead and naked by her ex-husband in her new flat in Abringer Close, Wallington, on Good Friday 1994 (1 April). She had been strangled and her killer had set her bedroom on fire in an apparent attempt to hide the crime. She was a magistrate at Epsom Magistrates' Court and had said that she had moved to Wallington to escape a woman she feared would kill her. A man was charged, but the case was later dropped.[202][203] April 1994 Brian Dunning Leeds 53-year-old Dunning was found beaten to death in his home in Trafford Avenue, Harehills, on Saturday 16 April 1994. He had last been seen a week previously. Valuable possessions were missing, and the murder seemed to police to have been a consequence of a burglary having gone wrong.[204][205] April 1994 Ron Cousins Chelmsford, Essex Cousins, 78, was stabbed and strangled at his house on Anchor Street in mid-April 1994. He was a devout Christian who often let homeless people stay there, and when his body was found in the vandalised property, pages from the Bible had been stuffed into his mouth. A knife was resting on his torso as well, but it was not the one that had been used to attack him.[206] April 1994 Karen Reed Woking, Surrey Reed, 33, was shot on her doorstep at 31 Willow Way, Woking, at 9.15 pm on 30 April 1994 when she answered the door to a man pretending to be delivering pizza. The motive for her murder is uncertain, although it has been suggested that it was a case of mistaken identity and that her sister, whose husband had been convicted of murdering two brothers, was the intended target.[207] May 1994 Dawn Shields Castleton, Peak District, Derbyshire 19-year-old mother of one Shields was last seen getting into a car in Broomhall, Sheffield on 14 May 1994. Her body was found on 20 May buried under rocks at Mam Tor in the Peak District. She had been strangled, and her clothing was missing and has never been found. Shields was described by police as leading a 'troubled life', having been forced into sex work from the age of 14. The investigation into her murder was reopened in 2019.[208]\n\nLinks with convicted killer Stephen Griffiths and the murder of Michaela Hague in 2001 have been suggested.[209] However, the prime suspect was prostitute killer Alun Kyte, who had killed two sex workers in December 1993 and March 1994, and was suspected by police of being responsible for many other such murders across Britain.[60]\n\nMay 1994 Andrew Trail Sheffield 26-year-old Trail was found with stab wounds on Saturday, 14 May in the toilets of a blues club on Hallcarr Street, Burngreave.[210] 16 May 1994 Diane Clark Gainsborough, Lincolnshire Clark died in a fire at 51 years of age when her house was set alight after being burgled. Despite three individuals having been arrested in relation to the case, no one has been charged with the burglary or with the arson attack that killed her.[211] May 1994 Mary McKinlay Motherwell, North Lanarkshire Schoolteacher McKinlay, 50, was beaten, raped and stabbed to death in her flat on 21 or 22 May. A subsequent inspection there revealed no signs of forced entry. The police charged a neighbour, but a jury returned verdicts of \"not proven\". His trial came under criticism because his girlfriend had not been summoned to it â€“ she had given him an alibi despite having gone to the cinema without him on the night of McKinlay's death â€“ and because the prosecution's closing speech had been far shorter than that delivered by the defence.[212][213] June 1994 Selhouk Behdjet Holloway, London 58-year-old Behdjet, a drug trafficker, was discovered stabbed to death on 24 June 1994 at his flat on Hornsey Road. A man was charged with murder in 2012, but at a pre-trial hearing in 2014, the Crown Prosecution Service announced its decision to abandon the case. The deaths of key witnesses and the unreliability of those still alive were given as the reasons, but it later emerged that the likelihood of police inquiries being tainted by corruption â€“ an officer was at the scene of Behdjet's murder before a 999 call was made â€“ also played a part in the decision.[214][215] July 1994 Sharon Harper Grantham, Lincolnshire 21-year-old Harper was beaten and strangled after leaving the Market Cross, the Grantham pub where she worked behind the bar, to walk to the home of her babysitter in the early hours of Saturday 2 July 1994.[216] A Hove couple arrested over her murder in 1999 were released without charge.[217] July 1994 Iftikah Ahmed Luton, Bedfordshire Ahmed, 23, was shot twice in the abdomen whilst working at a kebab shop on John Street, Luton, in the early hours of 7 July 1994. The gunman had forced his way into the kitchen via the back door and left the scene in a blue Vauxhall Cavalier whose lights were turned off.[218][219] July 1994 David Foley Kings Cross, London Foley was shot outside a pub on 12 July 1994. A man was accused at trial of arranging the shooting from prison after hearing that his wife and two other women had been attacked by Foley, but the judge found the prosecution's case against him too weak to allow the jury the option of finding him guilty. Foley had survived being shot at 10 days before his murder.[220][221] July 1994 Chris Little Marple, Greater Manchester Little was shot on 22 July while driving his car along Stockport Road. Arran Coghlan was charged with the 31-year-old racketeer's murder but cleared of it; the following decade Coghlan went on to be charged with and cleared of two other murders and cocaine smuggling.[222][223] August 1994 Julie Finley Near Rainford, Merseyside Finley, 23, was last seen alive on the evening of 5 August talking to a man near the Royal Liverpool Hospital. Her body was found dumped in a carrot field just off the Rainford bypass the following day; she had been strangled and her clothing was missing.[224] In 2019 it was reported that police were investigating a possible link with convicted murderer Christopher Halliwell, who lived nearby and was a taxi driver. Finley was going to see a taxi driver shortly before her death.[225] It has also been suggested that her murder could be connected with those of Linda Donaldson and Maria Requena.[55] Police believe Finley may be a victim of Alun Kyte.[226] August 1994 Douglas Bryce Wishaw, North Lanarkshire 21-year-old Bryce was fatally shot in the neck and a 29-year-old man was non-fatally shot in the leg while Bryce helped him start his car in Craigneuk on 25 August 1994. Three men were acquitted of Bryce's murder and the other man's attempted murder. Two of the accused claimed that Bryce was shot by the man he was helping before the man turned the gun on himself, and these two defendants were also acquitted of the attempted murder of a brother of that man, who had bullets fired into his home on 3 May 1994. Ballistic experts said that both crimes were committed with the same gun.[227] August 1994 Kenneth Brown Barrow upon Soar, Leicestershire Originally from the Scottish town of Falkirk, the 56-year-old businessman suffered a single gunshot wound to the chest and a cleaner discovered his body in an outbuilding in the grounds of his mansion on 26 August. If the shooter was a trespasser, they had managed to gain access to the property in spite of the tall fencing and trees at its perimeter and the remote-controlled iron gates at its entrance. Brown had been fearful for his safety prior to that day, according to some of the people living close by.[228][229] September 1994 Hassan Bilgi High Halstow, Kent Two dog walkers found Bilgi dead near a country lane on the morning of 18 September 1994 up to 14 hours after the Turkish-born 46-year-old was shot. Detectives did not come up with a clear motive for the offence but suspected it had something to do with heroin trafficking on Bilgi's part.[230] September 1994 Atek Hussain East Ham, London 32-year-old Hussain drove home from his tandoori restaurant in Surrey and was stabbed outside his house on Burnels Avenue after getting out of his car on 18 September 1994. He rang his doorbell following the attack and told his family while dying that the assailants were Asian. Hussain's laundry bag was missing but not any of the takings he had brought with him from the restaurant.[231] September 1994 Julie Pacey Grantham, Lincolnshire Pacey was found dead in her bathroom by her daughter on 26 September 1994 after being strangled following a sexual assault. An unknown man wearing blue overalls was seen leaving the house the previous Friday and has been a suspect since the early days of the investigation into the murder. A Lincolnshire Police detective revealed in 2015 that they now had a DNA profile thought to belong to 38-year-old Pacey's killer.[232] September 1994 Stan Nicholls Yalding, Kent Nicholls, 37, was shot in the temple on 26 September when two men, one of them armed, burst into a public house as he was leaving the building shortly before midnight. Whether the gunman meant to shoot him or whether he did so by mistake when his real intention was to rob the pub with his accomplice (nothing was taken from there by either of them) is unknown.[233] October 1994 Kathleen Hempsall Lincoln Hemphall, 40, a part-time midwife, was stabbed in her home during a burglary on 11 October 1994. A 15-year-old boy was convicted of aiding and abetting the burglary (which he had already pleaded guilty to) but not of Kathleen's murder (which he had not been charged with), while a second youth was convicted of her murder but later had his conviction overturned. A third youth charged with murder and burglary was acquitted of both.[234][211] October 1994 Michael McCormack and John Ogden Balham, London Colleagues McCormack, 59, and Ogden, 34, were shot in Cavendish Road, Balham, on 21 October 1994 whilst walking back to work after having had lunch at a public house. It seemed likely to be a case of mistaken identity.[235] November 1994 Lindsay Rimer Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire 13-year-old Rimer lived with her parents in Cambridge Street, Hebden Bridge. She was a pupil at Calder High School. At around 10 pm on 7 November 1994, she left home to visit the local SPAR supermarket in Crown Street, Hebden Bridge to buy cornflakes. On the way to the shop she visited the Trades Club in Holme Street. According to CCTV footage of her at the supermarket, Rimer paid for the cornflakes at 10.22 pm. Just over five months later, on 12 April 1995, her body was recovered from the Rochdale Canal, approximately one mile upstream from Hebden Bridge town centre.[236] In 2016 police isolated a full DNA profile of Rimer's killer.[237] November 1994 Nayantara Ali Winchelsea Road, Forest Gate, London 11-year-old Ali reportedly disappeared on her way to school on 4 November 1994, although no reliable witnesses saw her making the 10-minute walk that morning. On 29 November her body was found rolled up in a carpet in a pile of waste 50 yards from her house. She had been sexually molested. The yard where she was found had previously been searched numerous times, indicating that the killer had placed it there afterwards. It is believed she was alive for four days after she disappeared. Investigators said that the killer almost certainly had local knowledge due to their knowledge of the waste yard used to dispose of the body next to her home. When her relatives were questioned about her disappearance, they said that they had assumed that she had vanished back to Pakistan or run off. Her house and the house of her uncles who lived nearby were searched, along with the men's car, but no evidence was found to indicate her body had been kept there.[238][239][240][241] November 1994 Shona Stevens Attacked in Irvine, North Ayrshire, died in hospital in Glasgow Stevens, 31, was beaten with a weapon in a daytime attack on a path near her home on 10 November 1994, and she died on 13 November. Found at the crime scene, and potentially of significance to the case, was a distinctive semi-naked toy figure that police think was once attached to a keyring.[242] November 1994 Helen Kazai Body not found Kazai came to be treated as a suspected murder victim by police following her disappearance in mid-November 1994. Before going missing, the 25-year-old was living in Scunthorpe in Lincolnshire with her sister's common-law husband and two people he was later convicted of killing: his daughter and his common-law wife (Kazai's sister).[243] November 1994 Barry Bailey Attacked in Walton, Liverpool, died at Whiston Hospital 42-year-old Bailey, a taxi driver, died on 21 November 1994 after being doused in a flammable liquid and set alight outside his house in Chapel Avenue during the early hours of 15 November. The windows of his taxi had been smashed the day before the attack.[244] November 1994 Ethsham Ul-Haq Ghafoor Nottingham Father-of-two Ghafoor, aged 26 and known as Shami, was shot twice while sitting in the driver's seat of his taxi on 22 November 1994. In the months that followed, although the police investigation into his death revealed him to have been popular and well respected, TV and newspaper appeals by detectives eager for information that would move the case forward were not very successful. Despite this, two men in their 40s were arrested in 2014 on suspicion of Ghafoor's murder; they were subsequently released on bail pending further inquiries.[245][246][247] December 1994 John Sheppard Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire The 66-year-old bookmaker was hit on the head with a hammer and sustained over 40 stab wounds as a robbery took place at his betting shop in central Aylesbury on the evening of 3 December 1994.[248] December 1994 Dr Michael Meenaghan (Spike) Blackbird Leys, Oxford A lecturer and research scientist at the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology at Oxford University, Dr Meenaghan, 33, was shot on 10 December 1994 at his end-terrace home on the Blackbird Leys estate. He was shot through the kitchen window at approximately 4.30 pm in what police have called an apparently motiveless attack.[249] December 1994 Leslie Watkinson Peckham, London Watkinson was a retired Salvation Army major who died aged 66 on 19 December 1994 when his skull was fractured during a mugging that took place as he was returning home with a pension collected at the post office.[250] December 1994 Mohammed Younis Slough, Berkshire Younis was a 42-year-old taxi driver who was stabbed in his hallway about 15 times after returning home on 19 December 1994. Investigators suspected him to have fallen victim to an attack by a stranger who was mentally ill or a would-be burglar.[251] December 1994 Tracey Mertens Found fatally injured in Eaton, Cheshire. Died at the North Staffordshire Hospital in Stoke-on-Trent the following day. Mertens was a mother-of-two aged 31 who was abducted, doused in petrol and set alight after returning to her former home in the Nechells area of Birmingham to collect belongings to take to her current address in Rochdale, Greater Manchester. A man out walking in Eaton on 23 December 1994 heard her cries and found her with her clothes still smouldering on the steps of the village church, and she died in hospital in the early hours of Christmas Eve.[252] December 1994 Edward Bransfield Coventry, West Midlands Bransfield, 25, was shot in his parked car in Arthur Street on 29 December 1994. He was said to have been a drug dealer and to have had a kilogram of cannabis in his possession when he was murdered, but the police did not find it.[253] December 1994 Amina Khatun Washington, Tyne & Wear 24-year-old Khatun was beaten and stabbed to death in front of her three children on 30 December 1994 at her home on Manor View East, Concord. Her brother was charged with her murder, but the charge was dropped because there was not enough evidence to be confident of a conviction. At the time, he was an illegal immigrant to the UK and awaiting possible deportation to Bangladesh. A woman and three other men were charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice, but these charges were also dropped.[254][255] January 1995 Michael Codner Stoke Newington, London 25-year-old Codner sustained a fractured skull and fatal brain damage on 23 January 1995 when he was punched to the ground outside a club on Cazenove Road, Stoke Newington. One of the club's bouncers was tried for his manslaughter, but the judge, finding the evidence against the accused to be weak and inconsistent, directed the jury to clear him.[256] January 1995 Tarsem Singh Purewal Southall, London Purewal, 60, was shot dead on 24 January 1995 while shutting up his office in The Crescent, Southall. Besides being a potential trial witness in the 1985 bombing of an Air India jumbo jet (two Canadian Sikhs were cleared of this act in March 2005), Purewal was the owner and editor of Des Pardes, a Punjabi-language weekly newspaper distributed in the UK that had published the names of rape victims, the names of their attackers, and his views on the personal lives and business practices of people in the community. No motive for his murder has ever been determined, however.[257][258] January 1995 Sarbjeet Bassi North Woolwich, London Bassi, 32, was found dead in Pier Road on 27 January 1995 after an assault in which he sustained head injuries. Although his two brothers were put on trial for his murder, the trial collapsed when, following consultations with three prosecution lawyers and a senior police officer, the Crown Prosecution Service declared an end to proceedings because there was not a realistic prospect of a conviction.[259] January 1995 John Kilcoyne Bristol On 28 January 1995, homeless 44-year-old Kilcoyne had been drinking in a flat with two associates when the police were called to say he had been badly hurt there. An ambulance arrived soon afterwards, but Kilcoyne was dead from a stab wound to the neck. A 64-year-old man charged with the Irishman's murder had the charge against him dropped.[260] February 1995 Joey Dean Blackburn, Lancashire A man alleged at trial to have stabbed 31-year-old Dean five times for reporting him for burglary, and whom Dean was said to have named as his attacker before dying, was acquitted. The judge had noted while summing up that it was universally accepted that if it was not that man who had killed Dean, the only other person who could have was the man a defence lawyer had accused of committing the crime after falling out with Dean over a drug deal.[261][262] March 1995 Paulo Seque Brixton, London 19-year-old Seque was an Angolan asylum seeker who, in the early hours of 5 March 1995 outside a restaurant on Brixton's Atlantic Road, was surrounded by a crowd of people who had just come out of the establishment, had CS gas sprayed into his face and was stabbed in the thigh following a dispute with staff. The dispute was to do with him not being allowed in because he had not paid the Â£5 entry fee.[263] March 1995 Nasreen Akhtar Oxford Akhtar was a 29-year-old mother of four who was strangled at her home in Cobden Crescent, Grandpont, Oxford. Her body was found by two of her children when they returned home from school on 30 March 1995. Akhtar's husband stood trial for her murder, but the trial collapsed. In 2015, police reopened the case and one of Akhtar's sons made a new appeal for information.[264] April 1995 Janet Brown Hall Farm, Sprigs Holly Lane, between Radnage and Chinnor, Buckinghamshire/Oxfordshire border The body of Brown, a 51-year-old mother-of-three who had worked as a research nurse in Oxford, was found gagged and handcuffed at her home on 10 April 1995. She had been bludgeoned to death by an intruder with a crowbar or jemmy, but nothing had been taken and she had not been sexually assaulted.[265][266] A link has been suggested with the murder of 50-year-old Carolanne Jackson 20 miles away in 1997 (see entry for 1997).[267] April 1995 Natalie McLean Wythenshawe, Manchester 18-year-old McLean was last seen with an unknown man in the Piccadilly 21 club in Manchester city centre early on Saturday 15 April 1995. Her mother found her body at her Wythenshawe flat on 20 April; she had been stabbed. A man was arrested but released without charge. In 2014 it was reported that the same man had been jailed for a sex attack on another woman and that his DNA had been recovered from McLean's flat.[268] April 1995 Hugh Robb Ord Morpeth, Northumberland Ord's bludgeoned body was found on 15 April on a footpath just behind his flat on Springhill Walk. Police, who made four arrests but did not bring any charges over the death of the 61-year-old, thought he had been lured to the footpath by somebody he knew.[269] April 1995 Sally Cannon Port Glasgow, Inverclyde Cannon, 20, died after being shot at her flat on the night of 22/23 April 1995. Four months later her partner was convicted of her murder, but Scotland's appeal court overturned the conviction in April 2001.[270][271]\n\nCannon's partner was retried towards the end of 2001, at which hearing it was stated that had the defence team for his earlier trial called in their own forensic experts, they might have been able to put forth evidence to support his claim that the droplets of her blood on his clothing, rather than being spatter from bullet wounds, had been coughed up by her as he held her in his arms while she was dying. A verdict of \"not proven\" was announced when the retrial concluded.[272]\n\nApril/May 1995 Robert Higgins Kirkliston, West Lothian The body of Higgins, 35, was found at the disused Craig's Quarry, Kirkliston, on 1 May 1995. He had died from a stab wound to his chest. Police believed that only someone with local knowledge would have known the secluded location. In 2007, a man stood trial for Higgins's murder, but the charge was found not proven.[273][274] May 1995 David Ungi Liverpool 36-year-old Ungi was shot in his car whilst driving along North Hill Street in Toxteth on 1 May 1995, and ran a short distance before collapsing and dying. A series of non-fatal shootings in Liverpool followed his murder and continued into June.[275] May 1995 Sabrina Brett Grand Union Canal, Stoke Hammond, near Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire The body of 17-year-old Brett was found in the Grand Union Canal on Thursday 10 May 1995. She had been a sex worker. Police believed she had been strangled before being dumped in the canal up to six days previously.[276][277] May 1995 Billy West Carlton in Lindrick, Nottinghamshire West, 42, was stabbed with a kitchen knife in his home on 13 May 1995. A man was charged and it was claimed at his 1996 trial that he had committed the murder because he had been in a relationship with West's neighbour and resented having been displaced by him as the object of her affection. The jury convicted him, but he was acquitted in 1998 because the jurors had been given inaccurate timings and because an inmate to whom he had supposedly confessed could no longer be considered a reliable witness.[278] June 1995 Leona McGovern Glasgow Someone throttled and stabbed 22-year-old McGovern before leaving her body behind the Arts Centre on Washington Street on 2 June 1995. A man stood trial for her murder but was cleared in January 1996.[279] June 1995 Michael Doherty Port Glasgow, Inverclyde Doherty went missing on 9 June 1995 and his remains were discovered in August. He had gunshot wounds to the head and his body was dismembered. Detectives suspected that the 36-year-old former bank robber was killed over drugs.[280] June 1995 Christine McGovern Walthamstow, London 47-year-old McGovern was found dead in her flat on Hamilton Road, Walthamstow, by a friend on 22 June 1995. She lived alone with her dog and was last seen at 6.30 pm in the street outside her home the previous evening. A dog police believed may have been McGovern's was heard barking at about 11 pm that same evening. The cause of death was asphyxiation, and McGovern's flat was ransacked and a number of items taken.[281] A link has been suggested between her murder and Anthony Hardy, the \"Camden Ripper\".[84] July 1995 Anthony Adams Brixton, London Adams, 37, was murdered outside Brixton tube station on 17 July 1995 after two men were seen chasing him along a nearby shopping street. They went over to him when he tripped and fell as he reached the station and he was stabbed in the heart and lungs. Police charged a 17-year-old who was involved in a fight with Adams the day before the killing, but friends backed up the youth's alibi and he was cleared at his trial.[282] August 1995, August 1996 Don Herbert, Paul Hemingway Sharlston Common and Normanton, West Yorkshire The same individual is thought to have murdered the two men. Herbert, a 64-year-old ex-miner, was fatally battered with the oxygen cylinder which he used to ease symptoms of pneumoconiosis and emphysema in his Sharlston Common flat during the August 1995 bank holiday, and Hemingway, a 49-year-old window cleaner, was beaten and stabbed to death in Normanton a year later, also in his own flat. The killer took money from each victim, too.[283] September 1995 Sally Ann John Body not found Although John's body has never been found, her disappearance began to be treated as murder in 2014. John was a 23-year-old sex worker and was last seen on 8 September 1995 in Aylesbury Street, Swindon, Wiltshire. Three men were arrested on suspicion of her kidnap and murder but were released. In 2011, during enquiries into the murders of Sian O'Callaghan and Becky Godden-Edwards, it was discovered that convicted killer Christopher Halliwell was a regular client of John's.[284] In November 2014, Wiltshire Police launched a murder investigation based on \"significant new information\". In 2017, police revealed that a postcard purporting to be from John was sent shortly after her death and was discovered to be forged.[285] September 1995 Marie Garrity Body not found Garrity, a 30-year-old sex worker and mother-of-three, disappeared at around 12 o'clock on the night of 8â€“9 September 1995 from the same area of Coventry that fellow sex worker Barbara Finn vanished from in 1991. Both have been investigated as possible victims of a \"Midlands Ripper\", who may have been convicted prostitute killer Alun Kyte.[286][287][288][100][289] September 1995 Nobantu 'Mandy' Zani Druid's Altar, Harden Moor, West Yorkshire The body of 15-year-old Zani was found on 30 September 1995 near to Druid's Altar, on Harden Moor, not far from the towns of Keighley and Bingley. Police believed that she had been strangled with her own chiffon scarf. She had not been seen for two weeks but had not been reported missing as her mother thought she was staying with a friend. The police investigation uncovered a double life, but an inquest could not say with certainty how she had died due to decomposition of the body. However, because she had been covered with branches her death is classified as an undetected murder.[290][291][292][49] September 1995 Gary Whitehouse Attacked in Blackpool, died in hospital in Preston (both in Lancashire) An occupant of a car got out and beat 27-year-old Whitehouse with a baseball bat or snooker cue early on 26 September 1995. The subsequent police investigation was hindered by the fact that the incident was not reported to them until 36 hours later and that neither of those who were with Whitehouse when it occurred could remember the location initially.[293] October 1995 Diane Jones, Shauna Hibberd and Sarah Jane Hibberd Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales Jones, 21, died along with her two daughters, Shauna (aged two) and Sarah Jane (aged 13 months), after the front door of their house was torn away and petrol poured in the building and set alight while they were asleep there in the early hours of 11 October. Three women each jailed for the arson attack or an offence related to it appealed against their convictions, resulting in two of them having theirs overturned and the other having her prison term for perverting the course of justice reduced.[294][295] One of these women was exonerated by South Wales Police in a statement read out in court on behalf of the force in 2006.[296] October 1995 Joy Hewer Walthamstow, London Hewer, 52, was stabbed and sexually assaulted at her own home on 17 October 1995. The retired primary school teacher was found dead after police and firefighters were called to a blaze at the sixth floor flat in St David's Court, off Parkstone Road, Walthamstow, at around 11.45 pm. Ms Hewer, a devout Christian, had suffered multiple injuries including a number of stab wounds. The murder remains unsolved but a Â£20,000 reward is on offer for information leading to a conviction.[297]\n\nIn an update on Crimewatch in 2015, police revealed that they had managed to trace everyone that had been captured on CCTV entering and exiting Hewer's block of flats that night except for one man, who as of the 2020s would be between about 60 and 70 years old. The flats had an intercom system and Hewer's door had a peephole which she regularly used, so it is very likely that she knew her killer and willingly let him in.[298][299]\n\nNovember 1995 Andrew Forsyth Dunfermline, Fife Although two men were convicted of the murder of 34-year-old Forsyth, who was discovered lifeless in his flat on 9 November 1995 after he was kicked, punched and hit with pieces of wood, appeal judges overturned their convictions because of statements from witnesses saying he was alive later than 3 November 1995 (the alleged date of his death).[300] A retired police officer subsequently received a five-year prison sentence for suppressing evidence indicating that Forsyth died on a different day.[301] November 1995 Ian Grant Cherry Hinton, Cambridge Grant, a 24-year-old who had worked as a nightclub doorman in Cambridge and St Ives, was shot dead on waste ground near Fulbourn Hospital on 14 November 1995.

The masked assailant appeared to be after the bag he was carrying and to think it had money inside, but all it contained was receipts and paperwork. Killick finished escorting the women when the attack was over and died soon afterwards in hospital.[305] December 1995 Mustafa Zarif Essendon, Hertfordshire Zarif's murder was believed to have been to do with heroin trafficking involving the 32-year-old Turkish Cypriot.

Although the defendant was acquitted at that trial, he was sentenced for perjury in 1999 after becoming a Jehovah's Witness and confessing to killing Burton. The law of double jeopardy meant he could not be re-arraigned for the offence at that time, but following the repeal of this law, police and prosecutors made an unsuccessful attempt to have the case brought before a jury once again.[314][315] January 1996 Bobby Jones Hastings, East Sussex The body of 26-year-old Jones was found beaten and stabbed in the neck in undergrowth in Alexandra Park, Hastings on 31 January 1996.

Police had the DNA profile of a suspect by the end of 2018, but it has still not been fully or partially matched to anyone in the National DNA Database.[318] February 1996 Peter Swailes West Yorkshire Featherstone man Swailes, 39, died on 9 February 1996 from a blow to the head in a road-rage incident that occurred between the villages of Nostell and Fitzwilliam.[319] A man in his late 30s was charged with his murder in 1999 and then acquitted.[320][321] February 1996 Kevin Nightingale South Shields, Tyne and Wear Nightingale, a nightclub bouncer aged 33, was shot four times at his doorstep after being driven home from his place of work on 17 February.

He had been shot twice. The car dealer had once been in business with one of three men killed in Rettendon, Essex, in December 1995, and this prompted investigators to probe whether there was a connection. A later police statement made it apparent, however, that no connection had been found.[330][331] May 1996 Terence Mann Attacked in California, died in hospital in Gorleston (both in Norfolk) Mann, a 51-year-old from Borehamwood in Hertfordshire, was stabbed on Sunday, 26 May in the car park of the California Tavern, California, on the Norfolk coast between Great Yarmouth and Hemsby.
