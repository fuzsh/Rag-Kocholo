        "text": "The judgment is unlikely to be paid out since the owners, Jon and Carie Hallford, have been in financial trouble for years.\n\nThey also face hundreds of criminal charges in separate state and federal cases, including abuse of a corpse, and allegations they took 130,000 dollars from families for cremations and burials they never provided.\n\nThat leaves the nearly one billion dollar sum largely symbolic of the emotional devastation wreaked on family members who learned the remains of their mothers, fathers or children were not in the ashes they ceremonially spread or clutched tight but were instead decaying in a bug-infested building.\n\n“I’m never going to get a dime from them, so, I don’t know, it’s a little frustrating,” said Crystina Page, who had hired the funeral home, Return to Nature, to cremate her son’s remains in 2019.\n\nShe carried the urn she thought held his ashes across the country until the news arrived in 2023 that his body had been identified in the Return to Nature facility, four years after his death.\n\nDozens of family members have received similar news as the 190 bodies have been identified, shattering their grieving processes.\n\n“If nothing else,” Ms Page said, this judgment “will bring more understanding to the case”.\n\n“I’m hoping it’ll make people go, ‘Oh, wow, this isn’t just about ashes,’” she said, adding that far more people are impacted than just those listed in the complaint.\n\nWhile the victims and the class action’s lawyer, Andrew Swan, understood from the outset that it was unlikely families would receive any financial compensation, part of the hope was to haul the Hallfords into court and demand answers.\n\nThat, too, went unfulfilled.\n\nJon Hallford, who is in custody, and Carie Hallford, who is out on bail, did not acknowledge the civil case or show up to hearings, Mr Swan said.\n\n“I would have preferred that they participate, if only because I wanted to put them on the witness stand, have them put under oath and ask them how they came to do this, not once, not twice, but hundreds of times,” said Mr Swan.\n\nTo Ms Page, it felt like another slap in the face from the Hallfords.\n\nThe civil case lists over 100 family members but has been left open in case other victims come forward since 190 total bodies were discovered in the funeral homes facility in Penrose, southwest of the company’s office in Colorado Springs.\n\nJon Hallford is being represented by the public defender’s office, which does not comment on cases.\n\nCarie Hallford’s lawyer, Michael Stuzynski, was not immediately available for comment.\n\nThe case helped spur Colorado legsilators to pass sweeping regulations on the funeral home industry in the state, which previously had the laxest rules in the nation."
