This was enacted at the Bridport Quarter Sessions held on 5th Oct 1773 and the Rev Richard DAUBENEY of the Island of Portland was chosen to be the 1st Clergyman for the County Gaol situated in Dorchester.\n\n1.

His final quarterly payment of £12 10 shillings he had to share proportionally with Rev Thomas HUGHES of Dorchester who had attended the gaol in his stead. Richard Daubeney died 16th July 1802 aged 83.\n\nSources: Cambridge and Oxford Alumni; Clergy of Church England Database; Dorset Quarter Sessions Records Image 201;\n\n2. Rev Thomas BRYER MA (1750-1818) - Chaplian (1786--1804 ) was appointed at the same Quarter Sessions held at Shaston in Dorset on 11th July 1786 (Image 201) to replace Rev Richard DAUBENEY as Chaplain to Dorset County Gaol for which he was to be paid £50pa. This was paid to him quarterly and each quarters payment was authorised at the Quarterly Sessions from 1773 to 1803. Follow link provided for more information about Thomas BRYER's life. He resigned as Chaplain to the County Gaol at The Shaston Quarter sessions in 1804 (Image 281) on 12th July 1804. The position was advertised and Rev John PALMER of Fordington was chosen as the next Chaplain to the County Gaol and also to the House of Correction, to be paid £50 pa for the Gaol and £20 pa for the House of Correction.\n\n3. John PALMER BCL (1749-1829 ) of Fordington - Chaplian (1804-1821) was appointed Chaplain of the Dorst County Gaol 12th July 1804 (Quarter Sessions Order Books 1798-1806 Ancestry.com Image 281) He resigned on 9th June 1821 (Session Order Books 1819-1827 Image 113 and payment of £40 being half a years salary due to him - Image 121)\n\n4. Rev Evan DAVIES BA (1790 - 1866) - Chaplian (1821-1823) from quarterly salary payments authorised at the Quarter Sessions the Rev Evan Davies, who was Rector of All Saints Parish in Dorchester, was clearly acting as Chaplain at the County Gaol from 1821 to 1823 until the Magistrates voted on whether he or Rev George Woods, who had also applied for the position, should become Chaplain. A vote was taken by Magistrates at the Epiphany Quarter Sessions held at Blandford Forum between 14th to 18th January 1823 and Image 182 records the names of those that voted for each candidate. The position was then offered to the Rev George WOOD as he had 10 more votes than Rev Evan DAVIES.\n\n5. Rev George WOOD MA (1773-1847) - Chaplain (1823 - 1825) as stated above he was appointed as Chaplain to the Dorset County Gaol at the Epiphany Quarter Sessions in January 1823 and given an update to the Act he was to receive £150 per annum. (Quarter sessions Order Books 1819-1827 Image 182). George WOOD advised his intention to resign his commission at the Epiphany Quaret Sessions on 11th Jan 1825 and the Justices asked him to continue until the Mid Summer Assizes (Image 283) .\n\n4. Rev Dacre CLEMETSON (1794-1866) M.A. - Chaplian (1825-1860) was appointed as Chaplain to the Dorset County Gaol 12th July 1825 (Quarter sessions Order Books 1819-1827 Image 306)\n\nThe son of Wilfred Clemetson of Whitehaven Cumberland a Gentleman by his wife Margaret nee Stamper he was born at Parton in Cumberland on 27th June 1794. He matriculated at St Alban Hall Oxford on the 11 March 1813 aged 18 years. He was duly awarded his BA degree in 1817 and MA in 1819. He was ordained a deacon on 20 Dec 1817 by the Rev Beadon Bishop of Bath & Wells at the chapel in the Palace at Wells and ordained a Priest by Fisher the Bishop of Salisbury one year later. His first appointment was as curate at All Saints church Loughborough Leicestershire in 1820 and he became a stipendary curate (at £100 PA) on 20 Mar 1822 but he came to Dorchester when he was appointed as Chaplain of the Gaol and House of Correction (at £200 p.a.) on the 10 Oct 1825: He is shown as an officiating Minister on lots of baptisms, marriages and burials both in Dorchester and Fordington and seems to have been one of those called upon when existing officials had to be absent.\n\nHe married Ellen DAVIS (1801-1831) the daughter of William & Elizabeth DAVIS at Winterbourne Abbas in Dorset by licence on 21st May 1822. Ellen had been baptised in the parish on 21st June 1801. Dacre baptised his own daughter Ada CLEMETSON (1831-1854) at FStG on 25 Aug 1831 who was later received into St Georges church Fordington by Rev Henry Moule on 2nd March 1832. Unfortunately his wife died, possibly following complications from the birth, and she was buried at Winterbourne Abbas on 12th September 1831. His role within the church seems to have changed somewhat in 1833 as his church record shows that he was appointed Rector of Chilcombe on the 5 Feb 1833 and Chaplain of Dorset County Lunatic Asylum at Coliton near Dorchester on the 21 June 1833 for which he was paid an additional £50p.a.. (Dorset Quarter Sessions records - Order Books 1827-1836 Image 256) . Census returns suggest these were additional responsibilities as he is shown in both the 1851 and 1861 Census returns as being resident at North Square Dorchester (In 1851 with his daughter Ada). Unfortunately Ada also died young, being only 22 years old when she passed away, and was buried with her mother on 7th April 1854. Dacre's death is also recorded in the parish registers for Winterbourne Abbas where his age is confirmed as 71 and his home parish to have been St Peters in Dorchester.\n\nAs Chaplain of the Dorchester Gaol he administered to the religious needs of Elizabeth Martha Brown during and after her trial for the murder of her husband. He took a petition for clemency to London and when this failed attended to her in her cell and on the scaffold before she was executed at the gaol on 9th August 1856. Dacre resigned his commission as Chaplain of the County Gaol and House of Correction after 35 years service at the Easter Sessions in 1860. He died on 25th April 1866 but was buried with his wife and daughter on 1st May leaving an estate of just under £3,000. He was author of 'The Duties and Encouragements of Christian Charity' pub 1821.\n\nSources:- Census returns Dorchester 1851 & 1861; CL: National Probate Calendar: NBI: OXA: Parish Records for Dorchester, Fordington and winterbourne Abbas : Also the following website: http://www.docstoc.com/docs/77923119/Local_Studies_Orders---Leicestershire-Villages--an-online -- Quarter Session Records.\n\nRev.

I have not been able to locate his career in the church but he married Amabella Grylls a native of Hull in Yorkshire at Sydney, New South Wales Australia in 1846 and served his Ministry at Penrith in New South Wales Australia 1846-1854 as they had 4 children born there.

Their ninth child was baptised as Lionel Arthur Watson on 24th Sep 1868 at Holy Trinity Church in Dorchester. His name appears 9 times in the burial register for St Peters Church in Dorchester when he officiated at burials from the County Gaol at various dates between April 1861 and Dec 1871. He was also often the Officiating Minister at several other churches in Dorchester when the incumbant was absent.
