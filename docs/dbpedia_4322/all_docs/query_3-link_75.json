The following unofficial stories are published with the speakers' permission.\n\nRepublishing: Growing up in science is partnering with the Journal of Stories in Science, which publishes stories about science from students, postdocs, faculty and the public from around the world. With the speakers' help, several of the stories below have now been republished in the journal.\n\nAll unofficial stories:\n\nJoseph LeDoux\n\nGabrielle Gutierrez\n\nSusan Carey\n\nVishnu \"Deepu\" Murty\n\nKenway Louie\n\nNiels Ringstad\n\nAdrienne Fairhall\n\nDavid Sussillo\n\nJohn Rinzel\n\nRoozbeh Kiani\n\nAnne Urai\n\nTanya Sippy\n\nStephon Alexander\n\nWill Adler\n\nLiina Pylkk&aumlnen\n\nNancy Kanwisher\n\nChristine Constantinople\n\nClinton Cave\n\nWoo-Young Ahn\n\nMegan Carey\n\nYael Niv\n\nWei Ji Ma\n\nSindy Joyce\n\nAshley Juavinett\n\nDeepna Devkar\n\nMichael Hopkins\n\nDaniel Colón-Ramos\n\nAndre Marques-Smith\n\nJane Willenbring\n\nAnne Churchland\n\nKathryn Bonnen\n\nGyörgy Buzsáki\n\nAdam Carter\n\nDavid Schneider\n\nHeather McKellar\n\nBianca Jones Marlin\n\nStacie Grossman Bloom\n\nNicolas Tritsch\n\nKaren Adolph\n\nMarisa Carrasco\n\nRobert Froemke\n\nCristina Savin\n\nMaureen Craig\n\nSachin Ranade\n\nJonathan Pillow\n\nMichael Long\n\nEric Klann\n\nWendy Suzuki\n\nEero Simoncelli\n\nEmily Balcetis\n\nCate Hartley\n\nXavier Castellanos\n\nMichael Purugganan\n\nFriederike Schuur\n\nDeepna Devkar\n\nLiz Phelps\n\nRichard Tsien\n\nWei Ji Ma\n\nMichael Landy\n\nJayeeta Basu\n\nChiye Aoki\n\nNathaniel Daw\n\nJay van Bavel\n\nDavid Poeppel\n\nJoseph LeDoux (Mar 27, 2024)\n\nOfficial story\n\nJoseph LeDoux received undergraduate and masterâs degrees from Louisiana State University (1971 and 1974), and a PhD from what is now known as Stony Brook University (1978). He spent ten years in the Neurobiology Lab at Cornell Medical school, and in 1989 joined the new Center for Neural Science at NYU as the first outside hire. Currently, he is a University Professor and Henry and Lucy Moses Professor of Science at NYU in the Center for Neural Science and Psychology. He is also a Professor of Psychiatry and Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at NYU Langone Medical School. His work is focused on the brain mechanisms of emotion, memory, and consciousness. LeDoux has received international awards for his research and is also an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He is the author of several books, including The Emotional Brain, Synaptic Self, Anxious, The Deep History of Ourselves, and The Four Realms of Existence, and co-author of The Integrated Mind (1978) and is a co-author of Against Happiness (2023). LeDoux did his PhD studying consciousness in split-brain patients. Although was particularly interested in emotional consciousness in humans, the tools available for studying the human brain were quite limited in the late 70s and early 80s. As a result, chose to study how the brain controls emotional behaviors in rodents using Pavlovian fear conditioning as a tool for tracing neural circuits. Although he had a large role in shaping the âamygdala fear centerâ idea, late in his career he rejected this notion and offered an alternative view in which defensive behaviors occur in parallel to cognitively constructed conscious feelings of fear. He closed his lab at NYU in August 2023 and will officially retire in August 2025.\n\nUnofficial story\n\nMy father, Boo LeDoux, rode bulls as teenager during the Great Depression, and then, after a back-damaging fall from one of the beasts, he returned to Eunice, a small town in the region of southwest Louisiana known as Cajun Country, and took over has fatherâs meat market. Much of his life was shaped by his notion of himself as a cowboy, which he truly was. At the age of 60, he took up bull riding again for several years, stopping only because my mother, Pris, the face of the business and the accountant, threatened to divorce him. To the extent that I had a job in the market it was to peel away the tough, inedible sheet of tissue covering the brain and remove the lead bullet with my tiny fingersâcustomers did not fancy chomping down on lead when they ate sautÃ©ed brains. It was intensely satisfying to pull the two halves of the brain apart, exposing a tennis-racket-looking structure and its wrinkly decoration. Later in life, I learned the tough tissue is the dura mater, the bullet was lodged in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the tennis racket is the brainstem, and its wrinkly decoration is the cerebellum. That had no impact on my career choice, but it certainly gave me a leg up when I became a neuroscientist. I never aspired to be a scientist. And no one who knew me in Eunice wouldâve guessed that I'd end up in that line of work. I was a decent student, but not a great one, and science was neither one of my better nor favorite subjects. Â The main thing I cared about was music. There was Cajun and country music galore in Eunice. But as long as I can remember, I loved pop music. In high school I was in rock ânâ roll bands, was a DJ, and dreamed of being a musician. In college, other than a âphysics for dummiesââ kind of classâan elective for non-majorsâ I took no other science courses. That was easy, since I majored in business administration, and then proceeded to get a masterâs degree in marketing. Yet, less than four years later, I had a PhD for discoveries I made about human consciousness in the brains of neurological patients. After that, I spent the rest of my career working on the brain mechanisms of emotion and memory in rodents to better understand human emotional behavior. In my late 50s, my success as a neuroscientist made it possible for me to actually become a musician and even a song writer. That may seem like an odd consequence of being a neuroscientist, but thatâs what happened. In 2006, I formed a band with Tyler Volk (Professor of Biology) on lead guitar, Daniela Schiller (post-doc) on drums, and Nina Curly (Danielaâs research assistant) on bass. I played rhythm guitar and wrote songs about mind and brain, a genre that came to be called âheavy mentalâ. We mostly played for lab parties. But one thing led to another, and we started playing in clubs in NYC and decided to record our music. The title of the first album was, of course, Heavy Mental. The Amygdaloids really caught on. In the early days, we were written about widely in the popular press the New York Times, Salon, and the Huffington Post and PNAS even had a news story titled The Amygdaloids. Our music videos have been viewed many times (one about ninety thousand times) on The Amygdaloids YouTube channel. Often when I am asked to give a lecture, the hosts request the band. I offer instead Colin Dempsey, the bandâs current bass player, and my partner in the acoustic duo, So We Are. We have played acoustic versions of The Amygdaloids heavy mental catalog in Rome, Mexico City, Stockholm, and many other places. Our next gig is in Rio in June 2024. The bandâs second album, Theory of My Mind, was produced in 2010 by an organization called Knockout Noise. In 2017, they decided to follow up with a documentary about my early life in South Louisiana Cajun country, my research, and my musical career. Featured were neuroscientists (Mike Gazzaniga, Eric Kandel, Daniela Schiller, Liz Phelps) and musicians (Rosanne Cash, Lenny Kaye). It can be seen on Amazon. During that same time, Lynne Kaufman, a San Francisco playwright, wrote to me saying she was working on a musical about a PTSD therapy group session and came across my research on traumatic memory reconsolidation and my music. She thought that my song Map of Your Mind might be a good fit and asked if she could use it. I told her she could use as many of my songs as she liked. As a result, lyrical content of fifteen of my songs were used to create the narrative arc of the musical. We did a staged reading in San Francisco and are currently working on a performance in New York.\n\nGabrielle Gutierrez (Dec 18, 2023)\n\nOfficial story\n\nDr. Gabrielle Gutierrez is a computational and theoretical neuroscientist who has worked on a range of scientific questions. From investigating how the retina encodes compressed visual information to exploring how spike-frequency adaptation makes a population code more efficient, Dr. Gutierrezâs work aims to understand how the properties of individual neurons interact with their connectivity within a neural circuit to produce the computations that drive sensory and motor processing. Dr. Gutierrezâs academic journey began at the selective womens school, Barnard College, where she majored in Physics and minored in Applied Mathematics. She pursued a PhD in Neuroscience at Brandeis University under the mentorship of Dr. Eve Marder. Currently, Dr. Gutierrez is an Assistant Professor in the Neuroscience and Behavior Department at the place where it all started - Barnard College. In addition to designing and teaching courses that introduce the next generation of women scientists to the field of computational neuroscience, she has an active, NIH-funded research program. Beyond academia, Dr. Gutierrez is committed to scientific outreach and service to promote diversity and inclusion within her field.\n\nUnofficial story\n\nGabrielle started out feeling pretty sure that she was going to be an actress or a dancer. She didnât really stop to think about a career in STEM even though she was often the top student in her math and science classes, and she really enjoyed those subjects. Even college didnât seem like an inevitability. Thankfully, with the guidance of some great mentors, Gabrielle found her way to majoring in physics in college. One fateful afternoon, she saw a public lecture that introduced her to the budding field of computational and theoretical neuroscience. She went to grad school for neuroscience, learned how to be an electrophysiologist, and later came back around to the thing that drew her in initially - computational neuroscience. By then, her quantitative skills had atrophied somewhat and she wasnât sure what kind of a researcher she was or whether she was even cut out for theory. After exploring lots of different things during multiple postdocs, she finally embraced her theorist identity and found her true calling as an assistant professor at an undergraduate institution.\n\nSusan Carey (Nov 14, 2023)\n\nOfficial story\n\nSusan Carey entered at Radcliffe College with an interest in math/science, settled on cognitive science in her junior year, graduated summa cum laude in 1964, having worked with Peter Wason, George Miller and Jerome Bruner in the earliest days of the Center for Cognitive Studies at Harvard. After a Fulbright in London, she returned to Harvard for a PhD, settling on cognitive development/language acquisition as a topic of study, working with Jerome Bruner and Roger Brown. After finishing her PhD in 1971, she was a lecturer at Harvard for 1 year, and then moved to MIT, where she taught for 24 years, then moved to NYU for 5 years, and then back to Harvard where she held a named chair for the last 23 years of her career and served as the first female chair of the Harvard Department of Psychology. Her career in developmental cognitive science was much lauded, recognized by the Nicod Prize (Paris), the Rumelhart Prize (Cognitive Science Society), the Eleanor Maccoby Award, (Cognitive Development Society), election as the fourth president of the Society for Philosophy and Psychology, an APA Distinctive Scientific Achievement Award, an APS William James Award, a Guggenheim Fellowship and the Atkinson Prize (National Academy of Sciences), and election to the NAS, the American Academy of Arts of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and as a corresponding fellow to the British Academy.\n\nUnofficial story\n\nSusan Carey came to college from rural Illinois with no idea of what exactly she was really interested in, tried anthropology and biology and settled on cognitive studies in her junior year. After working as a research assistant for Peter Wason in the summer before her senior year, after which he returned to the University of London, she wrote an unmentored undergraduate thesis on the cost of negation in on-line processing, and also worked as a paid research assistant to Jerome Bruner on Piaget's conservation of matter phenomena during her senior year. Bruner subsequently plagiarized the paper she wrote for a graduate seminar he taught in the spring of her senior year, publishing it word for word with a footnote thanking Susan Carey \"for help in analyzing the data...\" This being 1964, Carey decided studying science was too far from the pressing political issues of the day (the Civil Rights Movement, the beginnings of the anti-Vietnam war movement). Women's Liberation and Gay Liberation (the terms of the day) were still years away. She went off to work with political refugees in East Africa where she met Malcolm X and then to London to study African history. She soon realized that African History involved a lot of time alone in dusty libraries. Fortunately, joining Peter Wason's lab meeting (she had never encountered the institution of \"lab meeting\" before) at University College London, she discovered that the issues in cognitive psychology still interested her, and she loved the collaborative nature of science. Now 25 years-old, she realized she actually had to find a job, and the only thing she knew how to do well was be a student, so she decided to apply to graduate school, where she could be supported for being a student. She wasn't really committing herself to being a scientist, which was not surprising, as she had never been taught by a woman or even heard a professional talk by a woman. Back at Harvard for a PhD, her attempts to find an advisor for work in cognitive psychology spectacularly failed (including the suicide of one short-lived advisor). She also had several experiences which gave her the message that that there was no role for women in academia. This led her back to politics, and she became active in the fledgling \"second wave of feminism\" the Women's Liberation Movement. The searing experience with her advisor's suicide led her to choose Bruner as an advisor, as he was sane, his work was very interesting, and he was a champion of women in academia, very unusual at the time, even as he stole from them (he plagiarized from her PhD dissertation also). Her unpublishable, unmentored, PhD dissertation was a piece of juvenalia, and the only time she even presented it in a conference, well-meaning, slightly older colleagues who were already established as leaders in cognitive psychology, took her to lunch and told her to abandon what she had settled on as her life work or she would surely fail in academia. She rejected this advice, but correctly concluded that she had humiliated herself in her first conference presentation. The next 4 or 5 conference submissions related to this work were rejected, and she got a similar message from the chair of the MIT department, when he offered her a job under the pressure of affirmative action but suggested she might prefer to be a research associate than an Assistant Professor. She said no, she preferred being an Assistant Professor. In the third prong (neuroscience, perception/computation, cognition) of MIT's forward looking \"psychology\" department--later renamed the Brain and Cognitive Science Department, she was constantly reminded that the third prong did not have tenure (in the words of the chair). Indeed, the brain scientists repeatedly tried to dissociate themselves from the work done in the cognitive wing of the department, including trying but failing to kick her wing out of the department. Carey's presentation will focus on coming into science during a sink-or-swim approach to graduate training, during the transition to women having a place at the table, and on dealing with failures and set-backs, (a thick skin is helpful) which continue to today, as well as the role of accident and luck in a career in science.\n\nVishnu \"Deepu\" Murty (Oct 16, 2023)\n\nOfficial story\n\nVishnu âDeepuâ Murty received his PhD in Neurobiology with a certificate in Cognitive Neuroscience from Duke University, followed by a post-doctoral fellowship at New York University in the Department of Psychology. His first faculty position was in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh, and he is currently an Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience at Temple University. His laboratory, the Adaptive Memory Laboratory, characterizes how neuromodulatory systems influence memory and memory-guided decisions. He studies these interactions in a variety of domains including reward, threat, curiosity, and agency. His work has been supported by multiple funding agencies, including the National Institutes of Mental Health, the National Institutes on Drug Abuse, the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes on Aging, and the Brain Behavior Research Foundation. Outside of the laboratory, he is an advocate for queer representation in Psychology and Neuroscience as well as developing strategies for greater inclusion of under-represented populations in research.\n\nUnofficial story\n\nDeepu started college at Brown University motivated and starry-eyed about starting his path to becoming a doctor. In his Sophomore year, he failed Organic Chemistry 2, which was a prerequisite for applying to medical school. This failure set the first of many professional spirals. In response, he cycled through 4 different majors over the course of 2 years, which eventually landed him in Neuroscience. The summer before his senior year, he started doing research and finally, something felt right. While you would think that inspiration would be enough to pursue a career in basic science research, instead some need to be âa professionalâ drew him to clinical neuropsychology. After 6-months of working in this lab, he had yet another oh no movement and switched over to a related, cognitive neuroscience research laboratory. Following this new thread for basic science research, he started his PhD in Neurobiology at Duke University. Weirdly, he decided to do his PhD in Neurobiology, even though he knew his passion was psychology (a question that still has yet to be answered!). Suffering through coursework that he was not the most interested in, his PhD research gave him an immense sense of satisfaction. Despite this love for research, graduate school was punctuated with multiple episodes of depression adding more stress to an already stressful endeavor. After completing his PhD, he started a post-doctoral fellowship at NYU, where he dove deeper into memory research. While things in the laboratory were gangbusters, living alone in an isolating city triggered a few more episodes of depression. To combat loneliness, Deepu threw himself even further into his work. While this increased his research productivity, this took a toll on his personal life. After 3 years of post-doc, which included 2 years of failing on the Psychology job market (30+ applications, 5 interviews, 0 offers), he was feeling a sense of urgency to get out of New York City. He ended up confirming a position as a junior faculty member in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh. Although this was not aligned with his career goals, at least he was finally in the same city as his family. Being stuck doing research that was not his passion, he slowly started treating his job as a 9 to 5. While this was a huge professional setback, he learned it was nice to have a life outside of work. He developed hobbies, a non-work friendship group, and even time for romantic relationships. But now the pendulum swung in the other direction, where his personal life was the main drive and not his career. After 2 years in a position that was not a right fit, he went back on the Psychology job market and landed a position at Temple University. While at Templeâdespite accruing 10+ failed grant submissions, another episode of depression requiring a 1-month leave of absence, and many late nights in the laboratoryâbalance seemed to be achieved. He currently runs an active research group, pursues hobbies and friendships, enjoys a mostly healthy romantic relationship, and tries to appreciate the path that brought him here. While balance has been mostly achieved, the good times are intermixed with a smidge of existential dread about being overwhelmed forever and not having panic attacks about the well-being of his trainees. However, a healthy mixture of therapy, supportive friends, SSRIs, and sage mentorship has provided support to get over these insecurities and remember to find the fun in his job.\n\nKenway Louie (Oct 3, 2023)\n\nOfficial story\n\nKenway graduated with undergraduate degrees in chemical engineering and molecular biology from MIT. He entered the MD-PhD program at Harvard Medical School, completing his PhD in biology at MIT using multi-electrode recording techniques to study memory reactivation during sleep. After receiving his MD from Harvard, he completed postdoctoral work with Paul Glimcher at the Center for Neural Science at NYU, studying value coding in animal and human decision circuits. He became a Research Assistant Professor at CNS in 2012, where his work focuses on the neurophysiological, computational, and behavioral aspects of contextual value coding and decision making. He holds a joint appointment at the NYU Langone Neuroscience Institute, where he currently serves as the Computational Core Director for the BRAIN Initiative Oxytocin U19 and Study Director for the ASTOP clinical trial on neural activity changes after interventional treatment for PTSD.\n\nUnofficial story\n\nKenway was born in NYC, one of a pair of fraternal twins to parents who had fled China in the 1950s. He grew up as one of the few Asian students in Long Island suburbs, where he and his brother both excelled academically but struggled to socially adjust. This struggle was not entirely helped by skipping several grades along the way, motivated by tiger mom parenting (before the term was coined), parental distrust of public schools, and an immigrant cultural emphasis on academic and professional success. Both Kenway and his brother graduated at 15 years old and enrolled at MIT. Undergraduate life at MIT was a shock in many ways: cool kids were smarter than expected, smart kids were cooler than expected, and students like him and his brother were a dime a dozen. Kenway always imagined being a mathematician or physicist, but freshman physics quickly disabused him of that notion. Saved by freshman pass/fail, he settled on a course of biology and pre-med (to satisfy his medicine-minded mom) and chemical engineering (for his civil engineer dad), but was drawn to scientific research, working his way through research positions in x-ray crystallography (tedious) to cell biology (informative) to cell cycle proteins and oncogenetics (productive). These research experiences - along with a continuing indecisiveness about medicine versus science - led him to applying to MD-PhD programs, where he turned down MSTP funding at other schools to attend Harvard Medical School as an unofficial, unfunded MD-PhD student. Unprepared for the totality of med school, Kenway survived his first two years of classes and returned to MIT for his PhD, switching from molecular biology to systems level neuroscience and the then-nascent technology of multi-electrode recording in awake behaving rodents. Grad school was an awakening of sorts, where he discovered the joys of a variety of pursuits both academic (neural coding, computation, neural networks) and non-academic (travel, motorcycles, rock climbing). Spurred on by the prescient words of a postdoc (âYouâll graduate six months to the day you realize you are DONE with grad schoolâ), he graduated and returned to med school, where he survived clinical rotations largely on people skills hard-earned through lab interactions rather than distant medical knowledge. To his surprise, he gravitated away from his presumed medical disciplines (psychiatry, neurology, neuroradiology) and towards surgical fields like neurosurgery - the urgency and immediate results of operations was a welcome contrast to the drawn out process of scientific research and grad school. This set up an agonizing choice at the end of medical school between neurosurgical residency and postdocs, with academic research winning in the end due to lifestyle, intellectual freedom, and a deep-seated interest in neuroscience. Kenway arrived at NYU in 2004 for a postdoctoral fellowship with Paul Glimcher, driven by a desire to examine neural circuits, cognition, and behavior in the NHP. His most cited work from that time on relative value coding and divisive normalization - which forms the basis of much of the theoretical and behavioral work he currently pursues - was initially viewed by many, including himself, as a simple test-case rotation project for a graduate student. Despite well-cited publications, grant funding, and multiple application cycles, he has yet to secure a tenure-track appointment, leading him to transition into a research faculty position. This kind of position offers both benefits (PI status for grants, mentorship opportunities with graduate students and postdocs, ability to focus on independent lines of work) and costs (lack of job security, ambiguous status in the scientific community, lower pay). Driven by a COVID hiatus, his work has shifted away from experimental neurophysiology to computational and behavioral approaches, which has opened up collaboration opportunities with scientists both within and outside of NYU. He still holds out hope for a transition to a more permanent position, focused on computational approaches to cognition and behavior, but in the meantime enjoys the time that academic research has afforded him with his young family (twins!) in the Northern Westchester suburbs.\n\nNiels Ringstad (May 16, 2023)\n\nOfficial story\n\nNiels did his undergraduate studies in Biology at Harvard College and his graduate studies at Yale, where he earned a PhD in Cellular and Molecular Physiology for studies of membrane trafficking in the synapse. His continued interest in neurobiology led him to MIT, where he studied the nematode C. elegans with the goal of developing approaches to understand molecular mechanisms of neuromodulation using behavioral genetics. Niels joined the Skirball Institute at the NYU School of Medicine in 2009 to continue this research. He is now a Professor in the Departments of Cell Biology and Neuroscience and Physiology and a member of the Neuroscience Institute.\n\nUnofficial story\n\nNiels was not supposed to be a scientist. He was a decent student with some basic competencies in math, physics and chemistry, but before college Niels was charting a course towards some imagined career that involved reading, listening to music, and talking to friends. The summer before college, Niels needed a job. He found one at a nearby university in a laboratory that studied the proteins that control how your body retains salt and water. This laboratory had reinvented a classic biochemical technique to watch the activation and inactivation of salt transporters in intact tissues in real time. Nielsâs job was to clean up after experiments were done, but he got to watch and experience the excitement of seeing how an experiment can reveal the invisible workings of molecular machines. The hook was set and that fall Niels declared a major in Biology. College was spent catching up on the fundamentals. There were also many opportunities to spend time in the lab. Summers were spent studying membrane biophysics, the academic year was spent studying bacterial genetics and molecular biology. Loving the lab didnât prevent some kind of burn-out. Instead of immediately applying to graduate school, Niels took a job after college teaching math and chemistry to middle- and high-school students on Cape Cod. This was a good year. Teaching normalized not-knowing - something that did not happen at university - and made the prospect of getting back into research irresistible. In graduate school and during his post-doc Niels was again lucky in finding mentors who tolerated his quirks and supported his efforts to learn something new about biology, this time with a focus on neuroscience. As a PI, he hopes to pass on the thrill of doing experiments, which never goes away, and to give out as much support and encouragement as he received.\n\nAdrienne Fairhall (Feb 08, 2023)\n\nOfficial story\n\nAdrienne Fairhall is a Professor in the Department of Physiology and Biophysics and adjunct in the Departments of Physics and Applied Mathematics at the University of Washington. She obtained her Honors degree in theoretical physics from the Australian National University and a PhD in statistical physics from the Weizmann Institute of Science, where she worked on the statistics of turbulent plumes. In her postdoctoral work she transitioned to working on neural coding. She joined the UW faculty in 2004 and now co-directs the University of Washington's Computational Neuroscience Center. She has directed the MBL course, Methods in Computational Neuroscience, and co-directs the UW/Allen Workshop on the Dynamic Brain. She has held fellowships from Burroughs-Wellcome, the McKnight Foundation, the Sloan Foundation and the Allen Family Foundation and was a Tocqueville-Fulbright Distinguished Chair at Ecole Normale Superieure in 2022. As a theorist, she collaborates with experimentalists working in a wide range of systems, from hydra to primates. Her work focuses on the interplay between cellular and circuit dynamics in neural computation, with a particular interest in adaptive and state-dependent neural coding.\n\nUnofficial story\n\nAdrienne grew up in Canberra, Australia; her mother was a country girl who did not finish high school, and her father was a civil servant who had taken his accounting degree at night while working full time. Her interest in scienceâand in science communication-- was stimulated through night lectures in physics at the Australian National University while training to work as a high school volunteer at Questacon, an Australian version of the Exploratorium. Adrienne thrived in her double major maths and physics classes at her Catholic girlsâ high school, but the confidence gained by this experience crashed instantly in the first week of university honors maths when she encountered male bravado for the first time. After scrambling through sophomore and junior years to regain ground lost to panic, she graduated with first class honors in theoretical physics. A risk taker, she looked for a nontraditional place to study for a PhD in physics that would also allow discovery of the wider world, and baffled her family and friends by choosing the Weizmann Institute in Israel. This was in many ways a bigger challenge than she had anticipated, including arriving in the aftermath of the Gulf War and spectacularly failing a surprise entrance exam. After a very stressful but rich six years, when considering postdocs, Adrienne took another leap, this time toward neuroscience. An intensive course in computational neuroscience at Woods Hole led to life-changing opening of new areas of interest, a whirlwind post-course romance with her now husband of over 20 years, and the start of a postdoc with Bill Bialek in which she commenced the studies on adaptive coding with which she launched her lab at the University of Washington five years (and one baby) later. She has never taken a biology or a computer science class and is amazed to still have a job in her field.\n\nDavid Sussillo (Nov 16, 2022)\n\nOfficial story\n\nDavid Sussillo attended Carnegie Mellon University for a BS in Computer Science and received both an MS in Electrical Engineering and a Ph.D. in Neuroscience from Columbia University. While at Columbia, he trained under Prof. Larry Abbott in computational and theoretical neuroscience. Afterward, David did his postdoctoral work at Stanford University with Prof. Krishna Shenoy, applying his Ph.D. work to complex neurophysiological data.\n\nAfter his postdoctoral research, David became a scientist in the Google Brain AI research group for six years focused on understanding how artificial neural networks function and applying those lessons to neural data. Now David is an adjunct professor at Stanford University and works at Meta Reality Labs.\n\nIn his professional pursuits, David manages a team of scientists who work to develop brain-machine interfaces for use in the next generation of computers. In his academic pursuits, David works within the connectionist paradigm to understand the ghost in the machine--how cells in our brain collectively give rise to the computations that determine our behavior. David is the recipient of a Fulbright research grant and is an internationally recognized neuroscientist with over 40 publications and three patents. His academic research is funded by the Simons Collaboration on the Global Brain and the National Institutes of Health.\n\nUnofficial story\n\nWhen I was a kid, part of the lore I received about my hometown of Albuquerque, New Mexico, was that it was the center of the national heroin epidemic in the 1970s. It made perfect sense to me--both my parents were heroin addicts.\n\nHaving drug-addicted parents meant orphanages and separation from family. With my father splitting the scene early on, and my mother's chronic stays in mental institutions, I found myself bounced in and out of group homes. I lived with hundreds of other kids of all races, colors, and creeds in similar situations. I was embraced and ignored, encouraged and beat up, mentored and forgotten. By the time I went to college, I'd been under the long-term supervision of no fewer than thirteen sets of house parents and saw family only on holidays or sometimes in the summer.\n\nMy unofficial story is one of group homes and of growing up in the chaos and neglect inherent in having addicted parents and institutional living. It's a story of poverty, survival, perseverance, and hope. I was a bright kid, but I wasn't an iron robot immune to my surroundings, or a hero from another planet, so cerebrally focused that I didn't notice anything outside myself. The profound, the beautiful, and the terrible--they all imprinted on me. If I wanted to be melodramatic, I'd say my unofficial story is a tale of life and death, of miracles and misfortune, as seen through the eyes of an orphan. But I made it, partly due to my intellect but largely thanks to many others and their thousand acts of kindness, many small and a few immeasurably large.\n\nMy unofficial story is a journey from the blighted Albuquerque neighborhood known as The War Zone, through the care of a revolving-door series of \"house parents\" at the Albuquerque Christian Children's Home, to a boarding school in Pennsylvania for underprivileged kids called the Milton Hershey School (featured recently in Invisible Child by Andrea Elliot), and still more house parents until I finally graduated high school.\n\nBecause of my intellectual abilities, I did well enough in high school to be accepted into Carnegie Mellon's Computer Science program. Still, the specter of my past pursued me. In college, I took the most challenging classes I could find. I could only see my value as a human being through my performance in the classroom--a notion that had sustained me during the many years of group home life. I had to discover for myself wisdom in the adage, \"no matter where you go, there you are.\"\n\nFor reasons I couldn't understand, by age twenty-three, my life fell apart as I endured unending, intensely painful panic attacks. Finally, I got into psychotherapy and began the slow process of confronting my past. Ultimately, I got my head screwed on straight and began a Ph.D. in computational neuroscience. I met and married a wonderful woman and have been happily married for the last seventeen years. Now I enjoy a career as a neuroscientist, artificial intelligence researcher, and mentor. I sincerely hope that our understanding of the brain will one day be great enough to address the problems of mental illness and drug addiction.\n\nJohn Rinzel (Oct 26, 2022)\n\nOfficial story\n\nI obtained a BS in Engineering Science (Univ of Florida, 1967) and participated in the co-op program, enabling me to work during alternate trimesters in Oak Ridge, TN where I learned and enjoyed scientific computing. My graduate career in Applied Math at NYU's Courant Institute was in two phases, MS, 1968 and PhD, 1973. It was interrupted by a two-year stint at the NIH (Division of Computer Research and Technology, DCRT) from 1968-1970. While at the NIH I came to know and collaborate with Dr Wilfrid Rall and developed an interest/passion of math/computational modeling of neurons. My PhD thesis was about analyzing models for nerve impulse propagation. After graduation I returned to the NIH/DCRT as an independent research mathematician but transferred after two years to the Mathematical Research Branch, NIDDK (Rall was a PI in the MRB). The directorship of NIDDK was very open-minded about basic research and I was well supported with postdoc positions, that would have been difficult in those days to obtain as a junior professor from either a neuroscience or mathematics department setting. The NIH was a terrific environment and I was able to pursue my own topics and establish several productive and satisfying collaborations for myself and postdocs, intramurally and extramurally, pursuing research in neuronal modeling, cell and circuit level. I also had adjunct teaching positions at the Univ of MD and Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. In the mid-90s I was recruited to NYU, with a joint appointment in the Center for Neural Science and the Courant Institute a perfect fit for me. Over these past 25 years my working group and I have collaborated with several different neuroscientists, many here at NYU, developing neuromechanistic models, especially in auditory processing. I teach in both departments. New opportunities arose here at NYU for my working group -- to carry out experiments -- both electrophysiology (auditory brain stem, in vitro, e-phys rig courtesy of Dan Sanes) and human behavior in auditory perception (psychophysics in our own sound booth).\n\nUnofficial story\n\nI grew up in a small town near Milwaukee. In Catholic school through grade eight I was not a diligent student but restless and oppositional. Going to high school was an awakening; I started to like learning and even turn away from my dreamy aspiration to become a long-haul truck driver in order \"to see the world.\" We moved to Florida's west coast into a primarily retirement community at the start of my junior year. During this huge adjustment I developed into a serious student, although still somewhat antagonistic and primarily interested in hot cars, portraying American Graffiti in Clearwater. Like most of my college-headed peers I applied to one of the state schools, University of Florida. I chose mechanical engineering as a major but became disillusioned with it during sophomore year.\n\nFeeling a need to get direct exposure to what engineers \"really do\" I entered the co-op program. My position at Union Carbide in Oak Ridge turned out not to be in engineering but rather in the computer center. We had state-of-the-art IBM 7090 mainframes having all of 32K RAM. I was in a numerical analysis and scientific computing group. I loved it. At UF, I switched my major to Engineering Science, more theory-oriented. My research mentor at UF (who came from academics in NYC), pushed strongly for me to apply to the Courant Institute. I was awarded a Computing Assistantship at COURANT (there were very few TAs in math) ! Perfect for me !\n\nThe first year: my bride Cathy (an Oak Ridge girl) took an office job at the Metropolitan Museum, I studied constantly, we joined protests against the raging VietNam War, and I passed my written qualifier exam in early 1968 and my HOT 64 Chevy Malibu was stolen in Queens. THEN in March 1968, draft deferments for grad students were terminated. My life trajectory was detouring. After a good bit of scrambling I applied for and was accepted to become an officer in the US Public Health Service and serve at the NIH computer research center in Bethesda. Tony Fauci and many others of us 'yellow berets' were at the NIH; it almost had a campus atmosphere. I knew nothing about and had no particular care for biology or medicine. My first project was to help develop algorithms for spike separation (ask me). This challenge did not relate to anything familiar in my training and it all seemed so ad hoc/heuristic. I pleaded with the group director (\"I hate this project\") if I could be part of some effort that involved mathematical physics. This very kind director introduced me to Wilfrid Rall, a PI in the \"Diabetes Institute\" (now NIDDK), and allowed me to pursue a project with Rall fulltime: developing solutions for voltage response to localized inputs on neuron models with branching dendrites including, OMG, input to a dendritic spine. This was like a dream Rall was super kind, super smart with amazing physical intuition, modest and mentoring. I developed a very close relationship with him and found my passion in this endeavor and, so timely, as the field of computational neuroscience was emerging.\n\nI returned to Courant in Fall 1970 (having satisfied my military obligation without being in uniform) to finish my PhD so that I could pursue my new passion. Math biology was growing at Courant and my PhD advisor, Joe Keller, was involved. Joe was among the world's top applied mathematicians (for decades) and suggested to me a problem about stability of the traveling impulse solution to nerve conduction equations, like the Hodgkin-Huxley cable equations. Of course, I knew that I had to pass oral quals and that was stressful (ask me), all that mathy analysis stuff. After passing orals, I pursued full time the stability question. I succeeded at that and learned so much from being around the Keller gang (ask me). NOTE: I learned from both of my mentors the value of formulating and analyzing idealized models.\n\nI completed my PhD in 4 yrs (1973). Math Biology was a hot topic in applied math and I was among the very few PhDs with applied math and theoretical-biology experience. I had good job offers in a tight academic market then: U MD and RPI as well as two different research labs at Los Alamos and the NIH (computer research center). I chose NIH. Wil and I wrapped our findings into two major papers and some conference proceedings. Through Wil I was then building contacts with the neuroscience and biophysics communities. However, by 1975 I was feeling that the computer division was not a growth situation for me. I was offered a transfer to the MRB, as a tenured PI. That transfer opened the door for me to establish my working group of postdocs, visitors and even to host PhD students at their thesis-research phase and without having to obtain research grants. The next 20 years were exciting and satisfying; I couldn't have been in a better situation. In 1981 I became Chief of the MRB (now called the Lab of Biological Modeling). Among my personal working group over the years were Bard Ermentrout, Xiao-Jing Wang, Shihab Shamma, Victoria Booth, Rob Butera, and others in, or previously in, the MRB: Gordon Shepherd, Idan Segev, David Lipman, Alan Weinstein, I was maybe Growing Up. But the NIDDK intramural directorship changed (early 90s??), becoming more focused and boundaries were developing.\n\nIt was timely that an NYU search for interdisciplinary positions involved Dave McLaughlin with Tony Movshon exploring candidates for a computational neuroscience joint appointment. I was contacted and one thing led to another and Cathy and I found ourselves back at NYU in 1997, but with a house and many friends back in Bethesda; our sons had completed college. During our first year Cathy realized that she terribly missed our MD community and her professional stature in the excellent Montgomery County elementary school counseling program. Hence began our two-city arrangement, allowing us to spend summers and lots of other times together in NYC or Bethesda and with our sons (who laid roots in NYC).\n\nHave I Grown Up? Here, at NYU, my research has expanded into new areas, including involvement in and directing experiments - that would have been hard to arrange at the NIH. There's still a lot that I want to explore and learn. I feel incredibly fortunate and grateful for the colleagues I've had at the NIH and NYU, truly giants professionally, generous and supportive on personal levels. I look back at my co-oping and 2-years of draft-evasion at the NIH as extraordinary 'internships' enabling me to identify avenues that I chose to by-pass and to find a passion, and lucking out that someone would pay me to pursue it.\n\nRoozbeh Kiani (May 31, 2022)\n\nOfficial story\n\nRoozbeh Kiani is an Associate Professor of Neural Science and Psychology at New York University. He received his PhD from the University of Washington and performed his post-doctoral research at Stanford before joining NYU in 2013. Prior to starting his PhD, he completed his medical training in Iran. Kiani investigates the neural computations that underlie visual perception, perceptual decision making, and cognitive control. His research is supported by the National Institutes of Health and the Simons Collaboration on the Global Brain. For his scientific achievements, he has received a number of awards and honors, including the Donald B. Lindsley Prize in Behavioral Neuroscience, the Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship, the McKnight Scholar Award, the Pew Scholarship in Biomedical Sciences, and most recently the Troland Award from the National Academy of Sciences. Kiani is also a member of the Board of Scientific Counselors at the National Eye Institute.\n\nUnofficial story\n\nBorn and raised in Iran, Roozbeh experienced a tumultuous childhood in the midst of post-revolution social unrest and war. But it was a happy childhood too. Roozbeh's family frequently went camping, hiking, and fishing in the mountain ranges south of the Caspian sea. Roozbeh puzzled over everything he saw in those trips: what causes rock formations, how can one tell the distance of nearby lightning, how do the fish breathe, why do we get altitude sickness, ... At school, he gravitated toward sciences to understand the laws that govern nature. Solving his nature puzzles made him happy, and his extensive but haphazard collection of extra-curricular knowledge came handy in the last year of high school when he attended the International Chemistry Olympiad. Through a lucky chain of events, Roozbeh succeeded in the national selection exams for the Iranian team and participated in the international competition, which was held in China. The Iranian team did quite well that year, and Roozbeh won the top gold medal of the competition. But the most thrilling aspect of the competition was the opportunity to meet peers from tens of different countries and to learn about their customs, traditions, and languages. Roozbeh returned home with a deep appreciation of the beauty and power of diversity.\n\nAfter returning from the chemistry olympiad, Roozbeh started his medical studies in Tehran, despite objections from his father, a medical doctor, who advised him to pursue science. But Roozbeh did not really know what he wanted to do and thought medical school would expose him to new experiences, while giving him time to figure himself out. In a physiology course in medical school, he was introduced to neuroscience and fell in love with it. He joined a group of likeminded medical students in Tehran who gathered weekly to read neuroscience textbooks and discuss papers. Around the same time, Hossein Esteky, who had recently completed his post-doctoral studies with Keiji Tanaka in RIKEN, returned to Iran with the intention to build the first non-human primate electrophysiology lab in the country. Roozbeh was lucky enough to join Hossein's group and under his guidance contributed to building the setups and starting the first projects in the lab. He loved the experience and learned so much from it. However, he struggled to meet the demands of a full time medical internship and his ongoing experiments. He barely had time to eat or sleep, often leaving his apartment before 6 am to rush to the hospital and returning past midnight after his experiments. A few things helped him survive this schedule for two years: Hossein's fatherly support, Keiji's encouragements, friendship and rich intellectual interactions with other lab members, and of course chocolate.\n\nAfter finishing medical school, Roozbeh applied to graduate programs and was rejected everywhere. He was shaken but cared too much about neuroscience to give up. He traveled to the US to present his findings at the SfN meeting, hoping that he would also find an opportunity to meet his scientific heroes and maybe convince them to give him a chance. The face to face meetings changed everything. A few months later, he joined Mike Shadlen's lab at the University of Washington. It was an ideal environment and Roozbeh had so much to learn from Mike, his collaborators and students. Free from the medical school demands and guided by Mike's brilliance, Roozbeh tackled several difficult questions. More than half of his experiments failed due to technical complications. However, the successful experiments were also those that he cared the most about. He defended his PhD and moved to Stanford for his post-doctoral studies in Bill Newsome's lab. Working with Bill expanded Roozbeh's horizons. Neuroscience was in the midst a transition, breaking away from the single neuron tradition and focusing increasingly more on the dynamics and interactions of neural populations. And there was talk of a BRAIN Initiative to usher in a new era of rapid advance in neuroscience. Bill's wise and compassionate leadership played an important role in shaping these transitions and the BRAIN Initiative itself. It also provided an unparalleled educational opportunity for Roozbeh to figure out what he wanted to do in his own lab.\n\nRoozbeh joined NYU in 2013 to start his lab in the Center for Neural Science. He greatly admires the intellectual tradition of CNS and has served in a variety of departmental responsibilities to strengthen the community. Roozbeh's lab explores the neural mechanisms of flexible decision making in the primate brain. He still puzzles over everything, while trying to be a good friend and advisor for his lab members and a good father for his four year old son.\n\nAnne Urai (May 3, 2022)\n\nOfficial story\n\nAnne Urai received her undergraduate degree in cognitive neuroscience and philosophy at University College Utrecht in 2010, followed by a masters in brain and mind sciences at University College London and Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris. She then pursued her doctoral research with Tobias Donner at the Universitätsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf and University of Amsterdam, investigating how our previous choices bias the way we interpret later information, and how this process is affected by the confidence in our decisions. Her PhD was awarded the NVP brain and cognition thesis prize, specifically for its combination of interdisciplinary methodology and open science approaches. As a postdoctoral fellow in Anne Churchland's lab at Cold Spring Harbor in New York, she studied the neurophysiology of decision-making using high-density neural recordings in the mouse brain. During this time she was a core member of the International Brain Laboratory, working with a global team of systems and computational neuroscientists to assess the reproducibility of systems neuroscience. She joined Leiden University in The Netherlands as an Assistant Professor in 2020, and was awarded tenure in 2022. Anne Urai's research focuses on the neural basis of decision-making across mammalian species, and the interaction between learning and perception. A current focus of her work, funded by an NWO Veni grant, is on changes in neural and behavioral noise across the lifespan.\n\nUnofficial story\n\nAnne had a careless childhood, was good at school, but could never quite decide on her passions: she dropped high-school physics and chemistry in a streak of rebelliousness, only to realize her mistake a year later and catch up over the summer break. In her first semester at university, she randomly signed up for several interesting-sounded courses and got into cognitive neuroscience and philosophy. She loved both of them, deciding on the spot that she'd solve all of psychology by studying the brain. Anne spent her exchange semester travelling and eating her way through China, and another year working soul-crushing sales jobs, herding sheep in France and ultimately following her boyfriend to backpack through Asia. In a hot Moroccan internet cafe, she read that someone would pay her to live and study in London and Paris for two years, which seemed too good to true.\n\nDuring her masters, Anne pursued her fascination for consciousness research (usually reserved for retiring professors) which mostly involved staring at EEG wiggles in windowless rooms. As a friendly collaborator was fixing her atrocious Matlab code, he off-handedly mentioned that Tobias Donner had just started a lab in Amsterdam - conveniently close to the city where said boyfriend had just started a new job. With her heart racing she approached Tobias at a meeting, didn't faint, applied for a fellowship, and started her PhD in his group.\n\nHaving made most of her MSc thesis figures in Excel, she suffered serious imposter syndrome, but discovered she actually quite liked the technical and programming parts of the job. She passed through a serious crisis halfway through the PhD: her initial proposal turned out to be severely underpowered, psychology's replication crisis was in full swing, her advisor's lab had moved to another country, and she hadn't published a single paper. Her advisor's gentle persistence, many yoga classes and an adopted cat helped her follow through, and Anne decided she'd give postdoc life a chance. After getting stuck in a snowstorm when interviewing at CSHL, she accepted the offer to join the Churchland lab and then got married, finished and defended her PhD within a frantic 6-months.\n\nComing from a background in psychology and cognitive neuroscience, it was both frightening and exhilerating to work with 'real' neuroscientists. Anne had to learn soldering, surgery and bluffing her way through genetics. She loved being a part of the (then early-stage) International Brain Lab, but started feeling terribly homesick after 1.5 years on Long Island. Just as she prepared to spend the summer doing data analysis in NYC, Covid-19 hit. Bored at home in lockdown, Anne opened a long-forgotten 'Jobs' email folder and saw a vacancy for a combined psychology teaching and research position in The Netherlands. Within short succession she then found out she was pregnant, she got the job, and the Churchland lab would be moving to California. Choosing her rainy, flat home country over sunshine, she hurried to finish experiments and returned home just in time for maternity leave.\n\nSo far, Anne has survived her first year of sleep-deprived parenthood and her assistant professorship, which was turned into a tenured position by happenstance (i.e. union negotiations). While getting settled into faculty life, she regularly experiences existential dread and wonders if writing scientific papers is what she should be doing for the next 35 years. Since her postdoc in the US she's increasingly concerned about the climate crisis, spending her evenings thinking about decarbonizing academia and worrying about the future.\n\nTanya Sippy (Apr 5, 2022)\n\nOfficial story\n\nTanya Sippy got her B.S. in neuroscience at UCLA where for her undergraduate thesis she studied synaptic transmission under the mentorship of Felix Schweizer. After taking a gap year to finish up her research project in the Schweizer lab, Tanya matriculated in Columbia University's MD/PhD program. There, her thesis work in Rafael Yuste's lab focused the role of interneuron subtypes in shaping cortical activity. For her postdoctoral work, Tanya went to the EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland where she studied sensorimotor transformation in the basal ganglia. After her postdoc, Tanya completed her clinical training in psychiatry at NYU and stayed at NYU to start her lab in October of 2019. Tanya is the recipient of the Howard Hughes undergraduate research scholar award, the NIH Ruth Kirschstein NRSA, the Burroughs Career Award for Medical Scientists, the Whitehall Grant, and an NIH NINDS R01.\n\nUnofficial story\n\nTanya was born in Orange County, California to parents who immigrated from India. From the time she could remember her parents, in typical Indian fashion, ordained that she would become a doctor. But her parents also recognized her love for dance and enrolled her in her first class at age 7. After one class she was hooked and spent the next 14 years more committed to dancing than to her studies, a fact that caused a lot of friction between her and her parents. As a senior in high school, she finished her requirements to graduate early, dropped her AP classes and drove every day after school to a dance studio in North Hollywood (1.5 hours north of the OC) where she was awarded a scholarship meant to train professional dancers (she did all this without her parent's consent or them realizing what she was up to). The tension between her and her parents and her own internal struggle to find her career path culminated when she was a sophomore at UCLA, and letter warning of academic dismissal was sent to her home address and opened by her mother. At that point, Tanya knew she had to make a choice: doctor or dancer?\n\nIt didn't happen overnight, but a combination of a solid friendship with a fellow student who was passionate about neuroscience and a gifted organic chemistry professor along with a physical injury steered Tanya in the direction of medicine. To better her chances of medical school admission, she applied to work in research labs at UCLA and was very lucky to work with Felix Schweizer. It didn't take long for her to realize that she was not really a doctor at heart but a scientist. Tanya was quickly persuaded to apply for MD/PhD programs and, having developed an obsession with NYC, she was thrilled to be accepted at Columbia. While medical school was a blast, her thesis years were rocky to say the least, and she was unsure if she would continue in neuroscience after she finished her dual degree.\n\nAmbivalent about what do after graduation, Tanya followed her heart to Europe (more on this later...) Luck was on her side again when Carl Petersen, whose lab was at the EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland, offered her a postdoctoral fellowship. At first, Tanya thought Switzerland might be boring and sterile, but she quickly grew to appreciate the country, its central location in Europe, and the rich resources and keen mentorship the Petersen lab provided; her 21 month postdoc was absolutely incredible both professionally and personally. Rediscovering her passion for science and growing to love European culture put her at another crossroads: should she leave Europe and her postdoc to go back to the States to pursue medical training? Ultimately, residency back in NYC is what she chose but had a hard time not looking back. She still visits the Petersen lab and the EPFL every year to get a dose of fresh Swiss air and energy of the Institute.\n\nResidency in psychiatry did provide Tanya with the training she needed to bring her work more focused on translation. She met Stephen Ross who was starting clinical trials using psilocybin to treat anxiety in cancer patients, and began working with him to broaden the scope of his work to include discussion about brain mechanisms that might be responsible for the therapeutic effects of these drugs. After starting her lab an NYU, she became associate director of a newly found training program in psychedelic medicine and this is now an active area of research in her lab. Almost unconsciously, her main research platform focuses on how learned sensory stimuli guide our ongoing actions, the fundamental biological process that underlies dancing. And where she lives in Manhattan is a stone's throw from the best dance studios in the world enabling dance to continue to play a formative role in her life.\n\nStephon Alexander (Feb 28, 2022)\n\nOfficial story\n\nI am a professor of physics at Brown University. I am a theoretical physicists whose research is at the interface of early universe cosmology, particle physics, quantum gravity and computational physics. I also engage in interdisciplinary research in the mathematics of music and physics. I did my B.S in physics and a minor in sociology at Haverford College. I also hold two Masters degrees in Electrical Engineering and Physics and my Ph.D in Physics from Brown University. I did my first Posdoctoral work at Imperial College, London and the second one at the Stanford University Linear Accelerator Center. I previously held faculty positions at Penn State, Haverford College, Dartmouth College. I am currently the president of the National Society of Black Physicists.\n\nUnofficial story\n\nI was born in Trinidad, a part of the twin Island republic of Trinidad and Tobago. My family immigrated to the Bronx NY when I was eight in 1979. I attended P.S 16, JHS 142 and De Witt Clinton High School, all in the Bronx and received a first rate public school education. My upbringing in the Bronx is pivotal in shaping me as a scientist. My neighborhood, middle and high schools, were infused with the five elements of hip hop culture. As a teen, I engaged in a little grafitti, and producing hip hop beats at strong city studios (Rocky Bucano, Afrika Bambatta, Jazzy Jay). I was also influenced by Avant Garde jazz and am mainly a self taught Tenor and Soprano Sax player (though I received mentoring from Ornette Coleman and Will Calhoun). During my postdoc years, I was introduced to Brian Eno at a Quantum Gravity Cocktail party. Brian played a major role in enabling me to make connections between my physics theorizing and jazz improvisations. This ultimately led to my book, The Jazz of Physics. I also managed to produce a critically acclaimed electronic Jazz album with Rioux (aka Tristan Arp), entitled Here Comes Now. For over a decade I was a comptetivie 800 meter and cross country runner and never got to run my dream time of 1:50 in the 800. I now walk for exercise, due to overuse injuries from competitive running. I have engaged a years of Zen practice (on and off) and am an avid reader of both eastern and western philosophy. I am blessed to be the father of a 14 year old daughter who lives in Reykjavic, Iceland. She visits me twice a year and we are great pals.\n\nWill Adler (Jan 31, 2022)\n\nOfficial story\n\nWill is the Senior Technologist in Elections and Democracy at the Center for Democracy and Technology, where he works to ensure that American elections are fair, accessible, and secure. Before joining CDT, Will worked on tech issues in the office of U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren. He also worked at the Princeton Gerrymandering Project at Princeton University, advancing the causes of redistricting reform and open election data. He has published pieces in numerous peer-reviewed journals and popular press outlets, including the New York Times, FiveThirtyEight, and Scientific American. Will holds a BA in Psychology from Carleton College and a PhD in Neuroscience from New York University.\n\nUnofficial story\n\nWill took a fascination to the mind when he took AP Psychology in high school. At his quirky liberal arts college, he majored in psychology but had a lot more fun in his studio art classes. Despite an aptitude for math and a lifelong interest in computers, he avoided math and computer science courses in a foolish attempt to transcend his nerdiness and hang out with the cool art kids. After college, he worked in a neuroscience lab to see if it was something he could see himself doing as a career; he liked it, and so he applied to grad school.\n\nHe started school at NYU, thinking that behavioral electrophysiology was going to be his thing. After starting a rotation with the one lab that interested him at NYU, it quickly became clear that it was not a good fit. He became panicked that grad school wasn't going to work out for him. He was also intimidated by his fellow grad students, who all seemed to be mathematical and programming geniuses - seemingly a prerequisite for succeeding at NYU. A few months in, uninterested in most of the labs, he was reconsidering the whole thing and thinking about dropping out. He then started a rotation in a lab focused on Bayesian modeling of behavior. The PI, being new to NYU, may have been somewhat desperate to stock his lab with grad students - why else would he accept a student who had never studied statistics or programming? The PI assigned Will a rotation project about human confidence reports, assuring him that it would be a short and focused project. The project instead took 4 years, constituting Will's entire dissertation. Halfway through grad school, Will became obsessed with the 2016 U.S. presidential election. After the election, Will's interest in a science career plummeted to a record low. Instead of focusing primarily on his research, he started organizing NYU scientists to think about how to respond to the new American political reality. This effort became ScAAN, the Scientist Action and Advocacy Network. Will's PI was extremely supportive of this new effort - he helped organize the group and remains a key member.\n\nAfter grad school, Will pivoted from science to elections policy, joining a group that works to end gerrymandering (i.e., politicians drawing district lines, in a clear conflict of interest). He then did a one-year fellowship for scientists in the U.S. Senate, writing pointed letters on behalf of a prominent U.S. Senator. The fellowship was an eventful one, marked by the Senator's presidential run, an impeachment trial, some exciting wins, and the start of the pandemic.\n\nHe now works at a nonprofit focused on individual rights online. His work involves making elections more secure, accessible, and fair, and finding ways to fight election disinformation and solve America's crisis of distrust in democracy. (He sometimes wonders if understanding consciousness would have been a more achievable goal.)\n\nWill and his wife live in Washington, DC, where they both grew up. They live with their two cats, whom he trained to use the toilet - perhaps Will's proudest accomplishment in the behavioral sciences.\n\nLiina Pylkk&aumlnen (Nov 10, 2021)\n\nOfficial story\n\nLiina Pylkk&aumlnen is a Professor of Linguistics and Psychology at New York University. She is the director of the NYU Neurolinguistics Laboratory and a co-director of the Neuroscience of Language Laboratory at NYUNYC and NYU Abu Dhabi. She also directs the magnetoencephalography (MEG) facility in the Psychology Department of New York University. Prof. Pylkk&aumlnen received her Ph.D. in Linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and conducted her post-doctoral work at New York University. Her research addresses the brain bases of language processing, with a focus on semantic cognition. Starting in the late 1990's, she and a handful of other researchers began to pioneer the use of MEG to characterize the brain mechanisms of language. Today, she has generated a systematic body of MEG research on multiple linguistic processing levels. This year, she was elected as president of the Society of the Neurobiology of Language and has in recent years spent significant effort on science communication, for example by starting a public YouTube channel on the neurobiology of language and a lab podcast.\n\nUnofficial story\n\nI grew up in Tampere, Finland, as the only child of a single mother, who was a nurse. As soon as I started a foreign language in school, at the age of 8, I knew I had a talent for language. I freaked out my English teacher with my perfect American accent - he was teaching in a British accent, but I liked the one I heard on TV better, and somehow was able to copy it effortlessly. I took the rather typical load of four foreign languages over the years, and at the end of high school, told my guidance counselor that I wanted language to be my job, somehow. She told me that language shouldn't be the core of my job, rather, I should find a career in which I could use a lot of languages. I said no, language will be my job. So I applied to the English Philology department in the University of Tampere, and made it, which was a huge accomplishment since the acceptance rate to that program was extremely low. There I found out that Linguistics exists, and immediately applied to be an exchange student in the US, since it didn't exist very much in Finland. I left Finland when I was 20 and landed in the University of Pittsburgh in fall 1994. I felt intellectually born and I immediately knew that I was not going to go back to Finland. But figuring out a way to stay past my exchange year was a real struggle. During my exchange year, I was taking MA classes at the Pitt Department of Linguistics, so I thought I should be an MA student there. But I was rejected, since I didn't have an undergrad degree. I fought to get into that program like my life depended on it, sitting in the Dean's office explaining my passion, and eventually it worked! But I still had no funding. By the end of the year, I had managed to secure half-time funding working in a computational linguistics lab and then took a loan from Finland to make up for the rest. After that, things went smoothly, my funding was extended to full time, and I got in to all the PhD programs I applied for. I arrived at MIT wanting to do nothing but formal semantics, but after the first year, I needed a summer job, and an RAship was available in an MEG lab that had just arrived to the department and the rest is history! The hardest struggle of my personal and professional life, by far, has been to have a child. Throughout my Assistant Professor years, I was completely drugged up on fertility treatments. It's a miracle I was able to have a straight thought. We knew our son would be called Nooa and our daughter Nella. One month after I got tenure, I was finally also pregnant. That year, we also received funding from the NYU Abu Dhabi Institute to start our lab there. Today, together with my husband-bestfriend-colleague-coPI, I have an 11-year old son Nooa and an 11-year old lab NeLLab (Neuroscience of Language Lab), our two greatest joys.\n\nNancy Kanwisher (Oct 7, 2021)\n\nOfficial story\n\nNancy Kanwisher received her B.S. and Ph.D. from MIT, working with Professor Molly Potter. After a postdoc as a MacArthur Fellow in Peace and International Security, and a second postdoc in the lab of Anne Treisman at UC Berkeley, she held faculty positions at UCLA and then Harvard, before returning to MIT in 1997, where she is now an Investigator at the McGovern Institute for Brain Research, a faculty member in the Department of Brain & Cognitive Sciences, and a member of the Center for Minds, Brains, and Machines. Kanwisher uses brain imaging and other methods to discover the functional organization of the human brain as a window into the architecture of the mind. Kanwisher has received the Troland Award, the Golden Brain Award, the Carvalho-Heineken Prize, and a MacVicar Faculty Fellow teaching Award from MIT, and she is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. You can view her short lectures about human cognitive neuroscience for lay audiences and newcomers to the field here: www.nancysbraintalks.mit.edu.\n\nUnofficial story\n\nI grew up in Woods Hole where nearly everyone was a scientist (well, all our dads were, only a very few moms). But I wanted to be a journalist, and dropped out of grad school several times to try it. Once I took a summer off interning at the Center for Investigative Reporting in San Francisco. Another time I flew to Managua at the peak of the Contra war, faked myself a press pass, hitch hiked all over the country in army jeeps, and hung out at the Hotel Intercontinental pool where the US spooks running the war out of Honduras used to hang out. I think the main reasons I didn't become a journalist are: i) I dont write fast or well enough, ii) my amazingly patient and understanding graduate advisor Molly Potter took me back after each of these daliances, and iii) my partner received the journalism fellowship we both applied for after our Ph.D.s and I did not. At the time I was furious, but it has turned out fine. I still cannot believe my luck to get to study the human mind and brain, and to work students and colleagues who blow me away every day with their kindness and intellect.\n\nChristine Constantinople (Sep 15, 2021)\n\nOfficial story\n\nChristine holds a BS in Neural Science from New York University, where she did research in Mike Hawken's lab and was also a research technician in Lynne Kiorpes' lab. She received her PhD in Neurobiology and Behavior from Columbia University, working with Randy Bruno to study thalamocortical circuits in the rodent whisker system. She then completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute, with David Tank and Carlos Brody, where she studied decision-making in rats. She joined NYU as an Assistant Professor in the Center for Neural Science in 2019, and her research examines neural circuits supporting value-based decision-making. Christine has received a number of distinctions including the NIH Pathway to Independence Award, the NIH Director's New Innovator Award, the NSF CAREER Award, the Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship, and the Klingenstein-Simons Neuroscience Fellowship.\n\nUnofficial story\n\nChristine grew up in New Jersey, with two siblings and many cousins in a large extended Italian-American family, which is the main reason she has not made it very far (geographically). She was very passionate about international relations and politics, and when she attended college at NYU, she interned in the local government, but became disillusioned about whether she could really make a difference in the public sector. At the same time, she serendipitously took a course called Brain & Behavior, which was taught by Mike Hawken. She loved it! She asked Mike if she could work in his lab, he agreed, and this experience changed her life. She switched her major to Neural Science, and her time as an undergrad at CNS was wonderful. She could not believe that academia was a viable career option (you can get paid to ask questions that you think are interesting, and also wear jeans to work?!), and she became fascinated by the culture and attended as many seminars as she could. By the end of her undergrad, she was set on going to grad school to study cortical circuits. She was accepted to several programs, but she decided to attend Columbia because she was dating someone in NYC. Shortly after starting grad school, Christine broke up with said boyfriend, but enjoyed her lab rotations. She then joined Randy Bruno's lab, which was a great fit for her technical and conceptual interests. In Randy's lab, Christine did 20 hour experiments that often yielded no data. Those experiments were grueling but earned her street cred. For her post-doc, she emailed David Tank and Carlos Brody, but they ignored her. So she went to SfN, hung out at the Tank lab posters, and introduced herself to David. Eventually they hired her to work on a new system for 2p imaging in rats. Christine learned a ton from this experience, but the experiments were extremely challenging. After struggling for several years, Christine felt that she would never get a job, was disillusioned with science and herself, and told her mentors that she was quitting. She applied to be an astronaut and considered other career options. Luckily, her mentors were kind enough to let her start a new project, and Christine was much happier and decided to stay in science. She was rejected from the space program, but she feels super fortunate to be back at CNS, and has really had fun setting up her lab and watching people's projects develop. She thinks the traits that have served her best are her resilience and sense of humor (mostly about herself).\n\nClinton Cave (Wed 18, 2021)\n\nOfficial story\n\nClinton Cave is an Assistant Professor of Neuroscience at Middlebury College. He arrived at Middlebury in 2018 after completing his Ph.D. in Neuroscience and post-doctoral fellowship at Johns Hopkins University. Clinton conducted post-baccalaureate research atthe University of Colorado and holds a B.A. in Psychology from Yale University. As a graduate student in the laboratory of Shanthini Sockanathan, his research efforts expanded the known roles of GDE2, a cell-surface enzyme expressed in the nervous system. Using functional genetic approaches in mice, his work demonstrated that GDE2 also plays a crucial role for neuronal survival in the postnatal nervous system, heralding a new research direction for the lab. As an independent investigator, Clinton runs a laboratory at Middlebury College mentoring undergraduate researchers. His group examines the molecular mechanisms regulating embryonic progenitor patterning, neurogenesis, and cell fate decisions through the lens of GDE signaling. Clinton is a published author in Neuron, Development, MolecularNeurodegenration, and his laboratory is supported by grants from the NSF and NIH. In 2020, Clinton was selected as a Next Generation Leader by the Allen Institute for Brain Science, highlighting his research accomplishments and his work to integrate open access datasets into the classroom.\n\nClinton is also dedicated educator, contributing to both the undergraduate and graduate curricula while at Johns Hopkins. At Middlebury, Clinton teaches four courses for the college's increasingly popular neuroscience major. He teaches the lecture and laboratorysections of \"Fundamentals of Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience\" and \"Fundamentals of Behavioral Neuroscience.\" These are two core survey courses that cover multiple sub-disciplines within neuroscience. The former describes membrane physiology, receptor biology, synaptic plasticity, neural metabolism, glial biology, and offers laboratory components on whole cell electrophysiology, action potential conduction, sensory adaptation and fluorescence microscopy. The latter course assembles a range of topics from neural coding to behavioral genetics, addiction and memory, and provides laboratory sessions on comparative neuroanatomy, mouse and rat behavior, and human electroencephalography. Clinton also teaches an upper level elective on neurodevelopment, promoting students' ability to engage with primary literature; as wellas an elective on the history of neuroscience, a course that contrasts and contextualizes the lives of scientists versus the impact of their works.\n\nUnofficial story\n\n\"Do I belong here?\" That's a question I frequently asked myself during freshman year of college. I had always done well academically in high school, and I entered college with a deep curiosity about the natural world. However, I found that my passion and enthusiasm for STEM was not reflected in my grades. My transition to college was very much the proverbial big fish moving from a small pond into the sea. At the time I hadn't realized how much of my identity and self-worth was hinged on academic performance-far too much. I worked hard over the next two years to find my footing and right-the-shipas it were. And it worked! By the second semester of my junior year I was earning straight A's again, with two courses even taken at the graduate level. But these self-imposed pressures to perform were not sustainable. My senior year, I suffered a major depressive episode. I had my new-and-improved formula for academic success but couldn't execute; a malaise and a pervasive darkness sank in around everything I tried to do. It strained friendships, frightened my family, and jeopardized my graduation. Many factors can lead to depression, and many of them are out of one's control. My error was not asking for help when I needed it most. My recovery was enabled by supportive healthcare practitioners, professors, mentors, friends, and family that all helped me find the road forward. Though incredibly difficult at the time, these experiences now help me better empathize with my students as they navigate tumultuous times in their lives. I amenormously grateful to be able to pay forward the mentorship that I received and help my students recognize their value inside (and more importantly) outside of the classroom.\n\n\"Do you need any help?\" That's a question I've tried to ask others since college. As a technician working at the University of Colorado, I helped run a confocal core facility. My job involved teaching users about the different types of confocal microscopy, the care of use of the instruments, and helping them design an imaging experiment. This was a unique position because it allowed me to participate in a wide variety of research projects throughout the institution, and I thoroughly enjoyed interacting with new users and teaching them about microscopy. Being part of this vibrant community is also what motivated me to pursue my PhD. By my mid-twenties, I had a renewed self-awareness, new tools to manage my mental health, and had separated my self-worth from classroom performance. I had landed a spot in a top PhD program, in a lab with a collegial, friendly atmosphere and a wonderfully supportive mentor doing research that I truly enjoyed. As I became a senior member of the lab, I was able to supervise the projects of several rotation students and two summer undergraduate students. Again, I found it extremely gratifying to be able to help them understand their projects, gain technical acumen, and mature as researchers. After graduating, I still had quite a bit of uncertainty about my next steps. I loved teaching but I wasn't sure about remaining in academia. \"Was I good enough?\" \"Do I have something to offer?\" Here again, I will stressthe importance of finding mentors that are supportive, and will act as advocates for you. I was reminded that I had received a world-class education, my diverse experiences on multiple projects made me a very well rounded scientist capable of utilizing multiple techniques across different areas of neuroscience, and I myself was becoming a practiced teacher and advisor having supervised students and designed an undergraduate neuroscience course. All these experiences helped me become a better educator and be competitive for teaching-focused faculty positions. During my job search, (just 1.5 years into my post-doc) I was extended two tenure-track offers. Ultimately, everyone's scientific and professional journey is different, and you don't always know when things will lock into place. Protect your health, find mentorship, and help those around you. And just for the record, \"You DO belong here.\"\n\nWoo-Young Ahn (Jul 7, 2021)\n\nOfficial story\n\nWoo-Young (Young) Ahn is an Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology at Seoul National University (September 2019 - Present; Assistant Professor from September 2017 to August 2019). He was previously an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychology and an affiliated faculty at Translational Data Analytics at The Ohio State University (August 2015 - August 2017). He earned his B.S. in materials science & engineering in 2002 from Seoul National University and then went to Harvard University as a doctoral candidate for applied physics and received his S.M. in applied physics in 2003. Due to his interests in the human mind, he decided to change his major to clinical psychology so that he could study the human mind from multiple perspectives. He continued on to receive his M.A. in clinical psychology from Seoul National University in 2006, and his Ph.D. in clinical psychology from Indiana University, Bloomington in August 2012 co-advised by Jerome Busemeyer and Brian O'Donnell. He completed his (APA accredited) clinical psychology internship at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) in June 2012. He worked then as a postdoc with Read Montague and Peter Dayan for two years at Virginia Tech Carilion Research Institute (VTCRI) and for a year at Virginia Commonwealth University Institute for Drug and Alcohol Studies.\n\nUnofficial story\n\nWoo-Young grew up in Seoul, Korea, \"naively\" thinking he would become a scientist after getting his PhD in engineering. He had no serious interest in the human mind until he joined the army after finishing his junior year at Seoul National University (SNU) to fulfill his mandatory military service. Experience in the military often made him wonder why we think and behave in a certain way, especially under stress or conflict of interest. He was released from the army after 26 months of military service and became seriously interested in religion and read many books on the topic. At the same time, he took GRE and TOEFL to apply for PhD programs in engineering in the US. He was not sure if doing a PhD in engineering was a right choice, but still applied for PhD programs and received admissions from his top choices and things went very smoothly. He went to Harvard to do his PhD in applied physics but it was hard to focus on his study during his PhD. He realized that he wasn't really thinking about his major (e.g., semiconductors, nano materials) but his interests are more on the human mind and related topics. After meeting several people in the Boston area and reading books in psychology, he thought maybe clinical psychology was the field he was looking for. However, he took no course in psychology in college and had no relevant background, so switching to psychology right away from applied physics was impossible. So, after completing coursework for a year in applied physics, he decided to take a leave of absence and go back to Korea to pursue a master in psychology in Korea although his parents were not supportive of his decision. Thankfully, he got accepted into a master's program in psychology at SNU because his advisor somehow thought he might have some potential in psychology (he still thanks his master advisor a lot for the decision). Psychology was very different from engineering and he struggled but could finish his master's degree and applied for PhD programs in the US again, but this time in clinical psychology. It was extremely difficult for him to get into a PhD program in clinical psychology - he had just one phone interview (Indiana University (IU), Bloomington) and initially got rejection letters from every school. Somehow \"miraculously\", the IU Psychology program revoked the rejection letter and gave him an admission. Graduate life at IU was overall really great but getting training in clinical psychology as a non-native speaker in English was very challenging. Still, he was very fortunate to have met great mentors and clients/patients who helped him grow up as a clinical psychologist. After his PhD, he did two postdocs (transition to the second postdoc was rough) and went to a job market. Getting a first tenure-track faculty position was extremely hard but luckily The Ohio State University (OSU) gave him a dream job. He thought he would be at OSU for many years but things didn't go as planned and he moved to SNU in Seoul, Korea in 2017 with his family. Reflecting his life. he thinks life is full of so much uncertainty, and his carefully laid plans almost always go awry. He changed his career to have a (more) meaningful life but is still searching for his meaning.\n\nMegan Carey (May 5, 2021)\n\nOfficial story\n\nMegan R. Carey is a Group Leader in the Neuroscience Program at the Champalimaud Center for the Unknown in Lisbon, Portugal. She received her PhD in 2005 from the University of California, San Francisco, where her thesis was awarded UCSF's Krevans Distinguished Dissertation Award. After a Helen Hay Whitney Postdoctoral Fellowship at Harvard Medical School, Dr. Carey started her independent laboratory at the Champalimaud. Her lab combines quantitative behavioral analysis, genetics, and physiology to understand how the brain controls learned and coordinated movements. Megan has chaired a number of scientific conferences, including Cosyne and the Cerebellum Gordon Conference, and she serves on the Board of the Society for the Neural Control of Movement and the Board of Reviewing Editors for the journal eLife. She is a member (and former Chair) of the FENS-Kavli Network of Excellence and the Chair-Elect of the ALBA Network for Equity and Diversity in Brain Sciences.\n\nUnofficial story\n\nBorn and raised in Philadelphia, Megan first discovered neuroscience when reading her college coursebook from cover to cover. All the most interesting-sounding courses had the mysterious letters NS&B in front of them, which turned out to mean Neuroscience (and Behavior), a thing she had no idea even existed. She showed up on campus at Wesleyan University unsure whether she'd major in that or physics, her favorite subject in high school. But intro Biology (which she hated in high school, but was a required prerequisite for a Neuroscience major) and intro Physics were scheduled in the same time slot, so she had to choose on the first day. She chose neuroscience and never looked back - to the side, yes, but never back. She walked into the lab of her faculty advisor David Bodznick one day while he was recording from the brain of a skate, heard the magical pop-pop of actual neurons for the first time, and was hooked. He offered her a research position and she spent two blissful summers in his lab at the MBL in Woods Hole, poking skate brains, eating lunch on the dock, and sitting in on fascinating lectures. It still seemed impossible that she could be a real scientist when she grew up, but he told her that he thought she could, so she applied to grad school and got in. She got kind of burned out writing her Master's thesis, though, so on a whim she deferred for a year to volunteer at a guest house in Mexico City, serving breakfast and working in reception and developing a taste for living abroad. Then she moved to San Francisco and spent the next 6.5 years at UCSF questioning her life's choices while she struggled with the slow pace of monkey research and the active obstruction of animal rights activists. She spent more of this time than she expected at City Hall, first testifying against a proposed city-wide shutdown of primate labs, and later, testifying to her illegal arrest by SFPD while protesting the 2003 Iraq war. She eventually decided that she needed to give neuroscience one more chance before she left (to do what though?), and enrolled in the summer Neurobiology course at the MBL, which reinvigorated her love for science and encouraged her to jump fields for her postdoc. After marrying one of her grad school classmates, they moved to Boston for postdocs and were blissfully happy for a year or so, before she had her first child and they started scrambling for everything - enough hours in the day, enough money for childcare, enough faculty positions for both of them. They went on the job market in Sept 2008, just days before the markets crashed and searches were cancelled, but somehow, they both managed to get great offers. Hers was in NYC and his was in Vienna though, and trying to solve that really sucked for a while, until they heard about this new institute that was being built in Lisbon, Portugal. It seemed impossible that they would actually move there, but something magical happened on those recruitment visits and the next thing they knew, they were moving across the ocean with a toddler and a baby, for jobs at a place called the Center for the Unknown. She (mostly) loves her job as a PI, and is surprised and pleased that she has found a career that satisfies her love of science, her international yearnings, and even her inner activist.\n\nYael Niv (Apr 19th, 2021)\n\nOfficial story\n\nYael Niv received her MA in Psychobiology from Tel Aviv University and her PhD in Computational Neuroscience from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, having conducted a major part of her thesis research at the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit in UCL. She is currently a professor at Princeton University, at the Psychology Department and the Princeton Neuroscience Institute. Her lab studies the neural and computational processes underlying reinforcement learning and decision making, with a particular focus on how the cognitive processes of attention, memory and learning interact in constructing task representations that allow efficient learning and decision making. She is co-founder and co-director of the Rutgers-Princeton Center for Computational Cognitive Neuropsychiatry, where she is applying ideas from reinforcement learning to questions pertaining to psychiatric disorders within the new field of computational psychiatry.\n\nUnofficial story\n\nYael grew up in Israel, thinking she would work in a Kibbutz and be a farmer. Two weeks volunteering in a Kibbutz in high school convinced her otherwise. She nixed her second career aspiration, to be a teacher, because she was worried about being surrounded by burnt out colleagues. Instead, after her mandatory military service in which she learned software programming -- and decided she hated it and would never do it again -- she married both her passions for nature and teaching and became a guide in the Society for Preservation of Nature. That paid pennies, so she also applied for part time jobs in software programming, thinking she would do that only for 6 months, to save up some money. Amazingly, she discovered that with the right colleagues, even programming can be fun. When she found out that in university she has to commit to one discipline from the start, she balked. Luckily she was accepted (after being rejected the previous year) to an interdisciplinary program at Tel Aviv University, that allowed her to create a US-college-like experience, and to study computational neuroscience before there were any BA programs even remotely related to the brain. Through this direct-to-MA program, she joined a lab in computer science (housed in the medical school) and had a second advisor in psychobiology. Her MA was in the latter, not the former, because psychology demanded fewer mandatory courses. Her MA paper was reviewed in most journals in the field, and rejected from all. In the end it was published in Adaptive Behavior, at a point where she could no longer look at it. Having lived with her high-school sweetheart for years at this point, they decided to get married, but then Yael joined a neuromorphic engineering summer course (because her lab mates told her it was super fun, and involved a lot of volleyball, which she did not, and still does not, play). From the transatlantic distance she suddenly realized her partner was not supportive of her career, so she ditched him a month before the wedding. Unrelated (really!), but in the same course, she met the person who would later become her soulmate. Planning to do her PhD in Zurich where he was a researcher, she finally quit her temporary 6-month-max programming job after 7 years. She quite liked that job, and was leading a team of 10 people (kinda like a lab). The plan was to get the PhD and then return there and be promoted. Tragically, her partner died unexpectedly 2 years and a month after they met. She almost died too, as a result. But she survived, and diverted her PhD plans to London, which had been his favorite city. She was officially a student at the Interdisciplinary Center for Neural Computational at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, though in practice spent her time between the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit in London, working with Peter Dayan, and Tel Aviv University, working with Daphna Joel. In London, she met Nathaniel Daw, who was her clandestine boyfriend (since they were in the same lab). Their first paper together led to so many heated arguments, that they decided to avoid collaborating in the future. At Gatsby, Yael also learned for the first time that people doing a PhD consider staying in academia as faculty. Given that Nathaniel applied for faculty positions in USA, she applied for postdocs there too, joining Jonathan Cohen's lab at Princeton. Shortly thereafter, she realized her mistake: she loved Princeton, but would not be able to be faculty there as they do not hire their own postdocs. Luckily (amazingly luckily, really), a faculty position opened a couple of months after she arrived, and she was encouraged to apply as a newbie, and as a long shot. She got the job. It was actually the position that Nathaniel had turned down a year prior, when he chose NYU. And it was contingent on submitting her thesis, which she had not yet finished writing. As junior faculty, by the time she was told to make sure to not create any enemies before tenure, it was too late. Her Israeli outspokenness and strong sense of justice had led her to call out gender bias and make some enemies. Her activism and community organizing also led her to found (with others) the website biaswatchneuro, and the faculty-support mailing list NeuroTeam. Years later, she finds herself a full professor, no longer commuting from NYC as Nathaniel was finally lured to Princeton as a spousal hire, running a lab where she is fortunate to be working with amazing students and postdocs, and raising two boys, at least one of whom shares her oversized sense of empathy (reminding her that gender has nothing to do with personality). In her \"other job\", spurred by the 2016 election, she co-founded and runs the Princeton Progressive Action Group and is president of the Good Government Coalition of New Jersey. She can talk about these for hours, so don't get her started. It turns out that she is a teacher after all, and yes, some of her colleagues are burnt out, but all in all this is probably the best way to teach in a constantly invigorated environment. She misses home -- her friends, family, and the scenery and hikes of her home country -- terribly.\n\nWei Ji Ma (Mar 11th, 2021) - GUIS Maastricht University\n\nOfficial story\n\nWeiji received his Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Groningen, the Netherlands.
