        "text": "Background\n\nThe Government should bring forward legislation to allow assisted dying for adults who are terminally ill and have mental capacity. It should be permitted subject to strict upfront safeguards, assessed by two doctors independently, and self-administered by the dying person.\n\nSignatures\n\n155,799 signatures\n\nData taken from https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/604383\n\nLast refreshed 2022-06-30 22:30:06\n\nGovernment Response\n\nThe Government’s position is that any change to the law in this area is a matter for Parliament and an issue of conscience for individual parliamentarians rather than one for Government policy.\n\nThe Government’s position remains that any change to the law in this emotive and contentious area is a matter for Parliament to decide and an issue of conscience for individual parliamentarians rather than one for Government policy. That is not an indication that the Government does not care about this issue. Rather, because the matter is so important, and is a matter of conscience, it takes no partisan position.\n\nWhether there are any circumstances in which it should not be an offence to assist another person to die is something on which there are passionately held but deeply divided views. Even amongst those who support a change in the law, there are differing ideas on where the line should be drawn, what safeguards should be in place and for whom. Conversely, others feel strongly that the law should not be changed and that safeguards will not necessarily give enough protection to vulnerable people who may feel pressure, whether real or perceived, to end their own lives.\n\nParliament has so far voted against proposals to allow lawful assistance with suicide, including in September 2015 when the House of Commons rejected the Assisted Dying (No.2) Bill by a substantial majority (330 votes to 118). However, this remains an issue of profound public interest and importance and the Assisted Dying Bill introduced by Baroness Meacher has provided an opportunity for Parliament to consider it afresh.\n\nThe Government took a neutral position when the Assisted Dying Bill was debated in the House of Lords on 22 October. The Bill passed Lords Second Reading without a vote. Committee stage – which involves line by line examination of the Bill - has yet to be scheduled.\n\nIf the will of Parliament is that the law on assisting suicide should change, the Government would not stand in the way of such change, but would seek to ensure that the law could be enforced in the way that Parliament intended.\n\nMinistry of Justice\n\nHistory\n\nEvent Date Time Updated 2022-06-30 22:08:29 Government Response 2022-02-03 15:51:27 Debate Threshold Reached 2022-05-17 07:30:09 Response Threshold Reached 2022-01-17 21:52:38 Opened 2021-12-30 12:39:25 Moderation Threshold Reached 2021-12-26 11:40:58 Created 2021-12-26 00:07:11\n\nSignatures by Country\n\n# Country Signatures % 1 United Kingdom 154,797 99.36 2 France 138 0.09 3 Spain 136 0.09 4 Australia 121 0.08 5 United States 72 0.05 6 Ireland 54 0.03 7 Canada 48 0.03 8 Germany 31 0.02 9 New Zealand 29 0.02 10 Isle of Man 28 0.02 11 Portugal 27 0.02 12 Guernsey 25 0.02 13 South Africa 24 0.02 14 Jersey 20 0.01 15 Cyprus 19 0.01 16 Hong Kong 17 0.01 17 Switzerland 16 0.01 18 Netherlands 14 0.01 19 Belgium 13 0.01 20 Italy 12 0.01 21 Greece 11 0.01 22 Thailand 11 0.01 23 Gibraltar 9 0.01 24 United Arab Emirates 9 0.01 25 Bermuda 6 0.00 26 Bulgaria 6 0.00 27 Sweden 6 0.00 28 Turkey 6 0.00 29 Denmark 5 0.00 30 Bahrain 4 0.00 31 Japan 4 0.00 32 Malta 4 0.00 33 Norway 4 0.00 34 Poland 4 0.00 35 Venezuela 4 0.00 36 Barbados 3 0.00 37 Uruguay 3 0.00 38 Zimbabwe 3 0.00 39 Iceland 2 0.00 40 Israel 2 0.00 41 Luxembourg 2 0.00 42 Malaysia 2 0.00 43 Mexico 2 0.00 44 Philippines 2 0.00 45 Qatar 2 0.00 46 Romania 2 0.00 47 Singapore 2 0.00 48 Taiwan 2 0.00 49 Uzbekistan 2 0.00 50 Vanuatu 2 0.00 51 Vatican City 2 0.00 52 Vietnam 2 0.00 53 Albania 1 0.00 54 Austria 1 0.00 55 Azerbaijan 1 0.00 56 Brazil 1 0.00 57 Cameroon 1 0.00 58 Croatia 1 0.00 59 Czechia 1 0.00 60 Ghana 1 0.00 61 Grenada 1 0.00 62 Guyana 1 0.00 63 Haiti 1 0.00 64 Honduras 1 0.00 65 Hungary 1 0.00 66 Kenya 1 0.00 67 Kuwait 1 0.00 68 Lithuania 1 0.00 69 Maldives 1 0.00 70 Myanmar (Burma) 1 0.00 71 Oman 1 0.00 72 Pakistan 1 0.00 73 Saudi Arabia 1 0.00 74 St Kitts and Nevis 1 0.00 75 St Lucia 1 0.00 76 Syria 1 0.00 77 The Bahamas 1 0.00 78 Tuvalu 1 0.00 79 Ukraine 1 0.00 80 Zambia 1 0.00\n\nSignatures by Constituency"
