        "text": "From Whispers to Symphonies: My Journey to Marketing Mastery As I am approaching to the end of my master's degree in International Marketing and Business Development at SKEMA Business School, I can't help but reflect on the incredible transformation this journey has brought into my life. It has been an enchanting ride, filled with invaluable lessons and inspiring mentors. Throughout this academic adventure, I've had the privilege of experiencing a shift in perspective. The professors have been instrumental in bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical experience. They've helped me grasp that marketing isn't just about selling‚Äîit's about creating value. ‚ÄúIt's an art that turns whispers into symphonies, a science that transforms curiosity into passion, and pure magic that turns products into dreams.‚Äù In this journey, I've had the honor of learning from remarkable Professors: Luis Madureira Ë∑ØÊòìÊñØ È©¨ÊùúÈõ∑Êãâ Ph.D. CI Science, CI Fellow, CIP-II, CSIP, Alican Mecit, Peter Spier, Emilien Nizon, Camille Faure, H√©l√®ne Duranton. These brilliant minds have not only guided us as professionals but have also sculpted our journey into something remarkable, something that stands out. üìñ Lessons That Go Beyond Books üìö : I've discovered that marketing is a multifaceted craft. It's about understanding the ever-evolving consumer landscape, adapting to global dynamics, and mastering the delicate art of building and nurturing brands. But it's also about empathy, innovation, and storytelling‚Äîthe heart and soul of what we do. As I've delved into international marketing, I've realized the significance of a global mindset. The world is our canvas, and marketing is our palette. The ability to connect with diverse cultures, markets, and consumers is a privilege that comes with great responsibility. Now, as I look to the future, I am excited to use my skills and knowledge to help businesses create symphonies from whispers. I am confident that I can make a real difference in the world through marketing. I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to all who have been a part of this incredible journey, and I look forward to the exciting challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. Here's to the magic of marketing and the dreams we'll create together ü•Ç‚ú® #internationalmarketing #businessdevelopment #nextchapter #openforwork\n\n***How you do anything is how you do everything*** The above quote resonated deeply with me during my time studying Digital Marketing at Columbia University. It beautifully emphasizes the importance of consistency and integrity in our actions. Simply put, it suggests that the way we approach any task, no matter how small, reflects our commitment and dedication to everything we undertake. It's a reminder that our actions, even in the smallest details, shape our overall character and performance. This perspective inspires me to approach each endeavor with diligence and dedication, knowing that it contributes to my overall growth and success. üöÄüí™ #ConsistencyMatters #Dedication #SuccessMindset #PixousTech\n\nResearch That Matters (a new video series) üé•üéâ January 17, 2024 üôè Belated new year greetings, everyone! After an extended break to spend time with visiting family members, I am ready to get back to work. As mentioned in the original post below, I'm honored to kickstart the new series of short videos called 'Research That Matters' initiated by the Department of Marketing at Monash Business School highlighting the findings of selected research projects by our academic staff that are published in the top marketing journals. üéìüéä In this particular video, I explain the research question and key findings of my research on how #positiveemotions and #humanvalues interact to influence #sustainablebehavior. This article has just been published in the Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science (JAMS), an FT50 journal. Kudos to my collaborators, Li YAN Êôè‰∏Ω and Kyle B. Murray for discussions started several years ago that led to this fantastic outcome. The full reference and link (open access) are provided in the comment below. üìå Abstract: Building on prior work examining discrete emotions and consumer behavior, the present research proposes that consumers are more likely to engage in the target sustainable behavior when marketers use an emotional appeal that matches the brand‚Äôs expressed values or one that is congruent with consumers‚Äô value priority. In particular, we focus on two contrasting positive emotions‚Äîpride and awe. We show that the effectiveness of pride and awe appeals depends on the corresponding human values. Specifically, pride increases sustainable behavior and intentions when the self-enhancement value is prioritized; and awe increases sustainable behavior and intentions when the self-transcendence value is prioritized. Importantly, this interaction can be explained by enhanced self-efficacy. We demonstrate these effects across six studies, including a field study. Our fndings contribute to a better understanding of sustainable consumption, reconcile prior research, and provide practical guidance for marketers and policy-makers. üéØ Thank you to Gerri Spassova for initiating this video series, which is part of the Thought Leadership activities to promote research, engagement and impact of the Department of Marketing at Monash Business School. My appreciation to Alex Bialocki at Encore Productions Group for the great job conducting the interview and video shoot. If you haven't already done so, please connect with the Department of Marketing at Monash Business School to watch future videos in this series and attend our events. üéÄ #researchthatmatters #thoughtleadership #monashbusinessschool\n\n‚ÄúDecisions in Marketing‚Äù is the subject I have been privileged to teach to 3 sections at 3rd year BBA at Esade, in coordination with 3 brilliant professors: Dr Alexis Mavrommatis, Gerard Costa Guix and Carles Torrecilla as Academic Director, who also led the other three sections. This subject is designed to develop Strategic Marketing decision-making skills. Students learn how to make businesses sustainable on the long term. It is based on a triple loop methodology: 1) THINK as a CMO: Flipped class learning sessions based on content seen before on the online platform. 2) ACT as a CMO, based on the case-study methodology that Alexis Mavrommatis masters, and 3) BE a CMO, using Markstrat simulation platform to compete in the market, leveraging the expertise of Gerard Costa. I have really enjoyed working with 200 students from 40 different nationalities, digital natives and passionate about possibilities. A generation that will Do Good Do Better at the market very soon! #marketing #strategicmarketing #esade\n\nSeth Godin's AltMBA recently graduated its final cohort. I was lucky enough to take the program in 2019. It was an incredible learning experience. Of the many ideas I took away, there's a question that I use on a daily basis: \"what's it for?\" For any project to be successful it's vital that we know what we want to achieve. - What is the desired outcome? - What message to you want people to receive? - What change do you want to create? When I started to look, I was blown away by how many decisions I make unconsciously. Often these decisions are in service of something completely at odds with my goal. For example, sitting down to write a post here, I find myself second guessing: \"I shouldn't write about this, I should write about something else\". \"This isn't good enough, I need to rewrite from scratch\". If my goal here was to write the perfect post then these would be valid suggestions. But my primary goal, my \"what's it for?\", is to get better at writing and sharing my ideas. When I clearly know what its for then these doubts are no longer valid. I can just ship the imperfect post and allow myself the opportunity to learn. You can apply this question to anything for instant clarity.\n\nThis was me working in event promotions to earn some extra money during the university summer break. Apart from the fact I have a lot less hair (yes, those were highlights), university feels like it was 2 minutes ago, let alone 20 years - so it was pretty surreal to sit in front of my old lecturers to host the first Alumni Talk in 2024 at Oxford Brookes Business School. We covered a range of big topics and sparked some fascinating conversation the role of PR in 2024. The big themes discussed: - Understanding the modern communication network - Publications, Platforms, People of Influence and Peers - The importance of reactive brand communication to move at the pace of culture - Defining the purpose behind purpose-driven communication - The creative value in understanding how your audience consumes your product or service - both good and bad - The power of innovation to stay ahead of the competition Here's to the next generation of business students getting ready to graduate and take over üéì.
