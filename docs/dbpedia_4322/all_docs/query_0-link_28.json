        "text": "Born and raised in the beautiful wine country of Sonoma County and daughter to a musician, Amiée Conn (pronounced: Ah-mee Kahn) has always been a part of music, theatre and the arts. Originally from Santa Rosa, CA., in 1994 her family relocated to Anchorage, Alaska where she spent most of her youth. While there she found her passion through many theatre and dance performance events including TBA performing arts conservatory of youth as well as an Irish Dance Academy where she became a prestigious lead dancer with their touring troupe. Amiée followed her passion for the arts, through figure skating and ice performances as well, but it wasn't until she landed her first role in a local theatre production that she found her true calling. In 2000 her family relocated back to their hometown of Santa Rosa, CA. and Amiée began professionally pursuing her career in film and theatre, taking classes in San Francisco and local workshops, and eventually signing with Marla Dell Agency in San Francisco. In 2001, she landed a featured role in Michael Jackson's 9/11 Tribute Music Video for the song \"Cry\" that was shot in the bay area. It was an honor to work on this project and one more validation of the direction she knew she wanted to go in the industry. Los Angeles was next on the list. She appeared on professional stages in the lead roles including \"Gypsy,\" \"Evita,\" \"Disney's Beauty and the Beast\" and \"The King & I.\" Amiée made her television debut as the historical, biographical character \"Concepcion\" in The History Channel's \"Conquest of America\" mini-series. She was crowned Miss Sonoma County in 2006 , and was Miss California candidate for the Miss America state preliminaries where she was honored with the state scholarship and talent award for her vocal performance of 'Summertime\" from the operetta: Porgy & Bess. This title allowed her many opportunities to perform and speak at charities, radio interviews, public relations and event appearances for herself and voicing her platform on Cancer Awareness. It allowed her to reach out to many and give back in the community and to also have a positive role model and influence to young women, which has always been an importance to her.\n\nIn the summer of 2007, before moving down to Los Angeles, and while interning at AE Casting, Amiée had the pleasure of working on the film \"Bottle Shock,\" starring Chris Pine, Bill Pullman, Freddie Rodriquez and Alan Rickman while shooting on location in Kenwood and Sonoma. Later in the fall, Amiée studied at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy Conservatory for Musical Theatre & Film in Los Angeles. A couple months later she began booking jobs including working as Jennifer Connelly's photo double in the Twentieth Century Fox studio film, \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" with Keanu Reeves and Jon Hamm. She also worked on a new stage musical, Serrano, directed by Joel Zwick and written by Madeline Sunshine at the El Portal Theatre in Los Angeles. After losing her loving mother, Diana, to cancer on New Years Eve 2009, Amiée became even more active and vocal for the American Cancer Association, UNICEF, and an ambassador to the Colon Cancer Awareness Charity.\n\nAfter booking modeling jobs and commercials - Amiée got more creative and hands on with her own work - and in 2010 starred in and co-produced with creator/writer/actress Dawn M. Green, on the award winning web-series \"Lila, Long Distance\" about a down on her luck actress making ends meet by starting her own phone sex hotline and successful business. This comedy web-series grew to viral success on FunnyorDie.com, Blip.tv, Koldcast.tv, and Youtube. Amiée was awarded the Best Actress in a Dramedy Award from LAweb Festival 2011 and Best Actress nomination from FilmBreak Awards for her portrayal of the characters. Most recently, Amiée guest starred opposite James Van der Beek, Krysten Ritter, and Dreama Walker in the ABC comedy \"Don't Trust the B---- in Apartment 23\" and worked with Dustin Hoffman in the short lived HBO show \"LUCK.\"\n\nAside from tv/film and theatre projects, Amiée is also a singer/songwriter and is working on her solo music to release an album later this year.\n\nPatrick Barry Sullivan was born on August 29, 1912 in New York City. While never a major movie star, he established himself as a well-known and highly regarded character lead and second lead in motion pictures and television in a career that lasted 50 years. Legend has it that Sullivan was counseled to consider a life in the theater due to his height (6'3\") and good looks. He was supporting himself as a theater usher and department store employee when made his Broadway debut in \"I Want a Policeman\" at the Lyceum Theatre in January 1936. Unfortunately, the show lasted only 47 performances.\n\nIn 1936, he appeared in three other plays on the Great White Way, the drama \"St. Helena\" and the comedies \"All That Glitters\" and \"Eye On the Sparrow.\" All three were flops. Sullivan finally appeared in a hit play when he transferred into the role of Bert Jefferson in Der Mann, der zum Essen kam (1941) by Moss Hart and George S. Kaufman. However the 1941-42 season brought three more flops: \"Mr. Big\", \"Ring Around Elizabeth\", and \"Johnny 2 X 4\". Wisely, he stayed away from Broadway for a decade, when he again transferred into a hit, \"The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial,\" taking over the role of Barney Greenwald from Henry Fonda. Sullivan was nominated for a Best Actor Emmy Award in 1955 when he reprised the role on The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial (1955). His last appearance on Broadway, in the original \"Too Late the Phalarope\" in 1956, was, true to his performance record, a flop. Barry Sullivan's talent was meant for the screen.\n\nIn the late 1930s, he gained movie acting experience in two-reel comedies produced by the Manhattan-based Educational Studios. After giving up on his Broadway career and moving to Hollywood, Sullivan appeared in an uncredited bit part in \"The Green Hornet Strikes Again! (1940) (1941) at Universal before making his official film debut in the Chester Morris B-picture High Explosive (1943) (1943) at Paramount. His next picture was Eine Frau für den Marshal (1943), which was released by United Artists that same year.\n\nBarry Sullivan never broke through to become a major star -- but he did establish himself firmly in character lead and second lead roles. He excelled at roles in which he could play aggressive characters that highlighted his centered masculinity. His most notable roles in the early part of his movie career were as the eponymous The Gangster (1947), Tom Buchanan in the Alan Ladd version of Der große Gatsby (1949) (second lead), and as the movie director in Stadt der Illusionen (1952) as part of a first rate ensemble. He had his own TV series Harbourmaster (1957) in 1957-58 and The Tall Man (1960) in 1960-62. A decade later, his acting skills were used to fine effect in two prestigious productions of stage plays as George C. Scott's brother in the Emmy Award-winning TV adaptation of Arthur Miller's The Price (1971) and the amoral patriarch in Lillian Hellman's Another Part of the Forest (1972). He continued acting in movies until 1977, rounding off a near 40-year movie career with an appearance in Oh, Gott (1977). He continued to appear periodically on television until retiring in 1980.\n\nSullivan was married three times and fathered three children, Johnny and Jenny Sullivan by his first wife, and Patsy Sullivan-Webb by his second wife Gita Hall. The Sullivan talent has run into three generations. Jenny Sullivan became an actress and a playwright, writing the drama \"J for J\" (\"Journal for John\") based on the correspondence between her father and her brother, who was mentally disabled. She was married to the rock star Jim Messina.\n\nPatsy Sullivan-Webb was a successful model who appeared as the face of Yardley Cosmetics in the Swinging '60s, starting at the age of twelve. She appeared with her father in the episode of Süß, aber ein bißchen verrückt (1966) that opened the series' third season and was a contestant on The Dating Game (1965). She married the great songwriter Jimmy Webb, by whom she had six children. Two of her sons formed the rock group The Webb Brothers.\n\nBarry Sullivan died of a respiratory ailment on June 6, 1994 in Sherman Oaks, California. He was 81 years old.\n\nBeth Dover has quickly become known in the entertainment industry for the charismatic characters she has brought to life on screen. Whether it be her undeniable comedic timing or her ability to improv and play in any situation thrown her way, Dover is one to watch, this year. She can currently be seen co-starring on the Golden Globe, Emmy, and SAG Award-winning series \"Orange is the New Black\" for Netflix. Introduced during season three, Dover shines as Linda Ferguson, an administrative stickler for MCC, the private company that owns Litchfield prison. Linda also just happens to be Caputo's (Nick Sandow) girlfriend. \"Orange is the New Black\" premiered season five on June 9, 2017.\n\nIn addition to \"OITNB\" Dover will be seen reprising her role as Shari in Netflix's \"Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,\" a follow up to the eight-episode limited series \"Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp\" starring Paul Rudd, Elizabeth Banks, Christopher Meloni, Janeane Garofalo, Bradley Cooper, Amy Poehler, Chris Pine, Jon Hamm and Kristen Wiig. The show was released on August 8, 2017. Lastly, Dover can be seen returning to season three of Comedy Central's historical satire series \"Another Period\" (release date TBA). The show follows the lives of the obscenely rich Bellacourt family and their many servants in turn-of-the-century Rhode Island in 1902. Dover plays Blanche, the long suffering housemaid who works for the family and is regularly in and out of mental hospitals. The show also stars Natasha Leggero, Riki Lindhome, Michael Ian Black, David Wain, Christina Hendricks, Jason Ritter, and Paget Brewster.\n\nBorn in Chicago, Dover's family was in the military and she moved every two years until she was 13 years old, even living in South Korea for a time. From an early age she loved creating characters and storytelling, memorizing commercials as a kid and begging her mom to let her be in them. Dover attended high school in Florida and went on to be a theatre major in college, then moved to New York City where she studied Meisner. She went on to settle in Los Angeles, where she discovered improv comedy and fell even further in love with the craft.\n\nIn 2010 Dover landed the role of Nurse Beth on the satirical comedy TV series \"Childrens Hospital\" for Adult Swim. The show, starring actor/comedian Rob Corddry, parodied the medical drama genre and went on for seven seasons with Dover appearing in 20 episodes. In 2012-13 Dover appeared as Lexie on 20 episodes of the E! series \"Burning Love,\" a comedic sendup of dating shows like \"The Bachelor\" starring Ken Marino. Additional television credits include some of the biggest series in comedy: \"Son of Zorn,\" \"Bob's Burgers,\" \"New Girl,\" \"Truth Be Told,\" \"Difficult People,\" \"Big Time in Hollywood, FL,\" \"Fresh Off the Boat,\" \"Comedy Bang! Bang!,\" \"Newsreaders,\" \"Chasing Life,\" \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine,\" \"Dads,\" and \"Whitney.\" On the film front, Dover appeared in \"Life Partners\" for Magnolia Pictures opposite Gillian Jacobs, Leighton Meester, Gabourey Sidibe, and Adam Brody.\n\nWhen she isn't on set Dover is a strong supporter of Planned Parenthood, the ACLU, and the HRC. For fun, she spends entirely too much time in private karaoke rooms with friends, singing her heart out to her favorite jams. Dover currently lives in the Los Angeles area with her husband, actor Joe Lo Truglio, and their son.\n\nMissouri born-and-bred Betty Ann Lynn was born in Kansas City. Her name is as light, breezy and innocent as the characters she played on film and TV. She is pleasantly remembered for playing TV's sweet-as-apple-pie \"Thelma Lou,\" who had the tough end of the bargain as the ever-patient girlfriend of Don Knotts's neurotic \"Barney Fife\" character on The Andy Griffith Show (1960). It took a second reunion decades later to finally get those two characters married. While Betty enjoyed other entertainment outlets such as film and the stage, it is her \"Thelma Lou\" character which will remain indelibly etched in the minds of all her many faithful fans.\n\nBetty came from a musical background as the daughter of a singer and began her career as a young teen performing in both supper clubs and on Broadway; in such musical productions as \"Walk with Music\" (1940) and \"Oklahoma!,\" the latter as a dancing replacement. She even entertained the troops with her light soprano at USO tent shows towards the end of World War II. In the late 1940s, after being \"discovered\" in the short-lived Broadway production of \"Park Avenue,\" the fresh-faced Betty was signed on as a starlet for Twentieth Century Fox and appeared in several of their popular movies, billed herself briefly as \"Betty Ann Lynn\" before abruptly dropping her middle name from the credits.\n\nBetty made her movie debut in a small, sprightly role in the classic Clifton Webb comedy Belvedere räumt auf (1948). After another minor part in Eine Dachkammer für zwei (1948), she earned a featured part playing kid sister to Barbara Bates in Die Braut des Monats (1948) starring Bette Davis and Robert Montgomery. She continued the momentum, all in a same airy vein, as the bobby-soxer daughter of stars Loretta Young in Mother Is a Freshman (1949) and Fred MacMurray and Maureen O'Hara in Father Was a Fullback (1949). After appearing again in pictures starring Clifton Webb and Bette Davis (Im Dutzend billiger (1950) and Die Ehrgeizige (1951), respectively), her blossoming film career lost major ground. Betty instead focused on 50s TV and also returned to the stage with a production of \"The Moon Is Blue\" (1954). She still appeared occasionally on the larger screen but, for the most part, was either unbilled or the pictures themselves were obscure. While on hiatus from the Disney series, \"Texas John Slaughter\" (1959), Betty tested and won the recurring role of Deputy Barney Fife's steady girl on Andy Griffith's homespun series. She became part of the small-town ensemble for five seasons -- until Knotts officially left the series to try out, full-time, in motion pictures. The producers were thinking of keeping her on the show but Betty felt her role was incomplete, without her connection to Don Knotts, after Barney Fife left.\n\nTV work continued, never straying far from her wholesome image, with recurring roles on Lieber Onkel Bill (1966) and Meine drei Söhne (1960) and guest parts on Katy (1963), The Smith Family (1971) and Unsere kleine Farm (1974). After a 1978 part on an episode of Barnaby Jones (1973), little was seen of her until she rejoined the Mayberry cast for a reunion in the TV movie Return to Mayberry (1986). In the same year, Andy Griffith hired her to play his secretary in a handful of episodes for his Matlock (1986) series. Betty's last acting role on TV occurred in 1990 and, save for a stage appearance in \"Love Letters\" in 2002 opposite another former Mayberry resident Howard Morris, she officially left acting.\n\nResiding in the same West Hollywood home since 1950, she moved out of state to Mount Airy, North Carolina - the primary real-life inspiration for the fictional Mayberry. The never-married former actress lived in a retirement community there till her death on October 16, 2021 at the age of 95.\n\nThe son of a surveyor, Charles Gray was born and raised in Queen's Park, Bournemouth. As a young actor, he received his vocal training from the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-upon-Avon and at the Old Vic, having long abandoned his first job as clerk for a real estate agent. His voice was to become one of his most valuable tools. In fact, from January 1966, he subtly, almost imperceptibly, dubbed for Jack Hawkins after this actor became unable to speak his lines due to throat cancer. In later years, Gray's trademark voice was regularly heard on television commercials.\n\nGray's theatrical debut came in 1952 in the part of Charles the Wrestler (he measured 6 foot, 1 inches in height) in \"As You Like It\", appearing under his original name, 'Donald Gray'. From 1956, as 'Charles' Gray (since there already was a one-armed actor named Donald Gray), he took to leading dramatic roles, and won critical plaudits as Achilles in \"Troilus and Cressida\", Macduff in \"Macbeth\" and as the gluttonous Sir Epicure Mammon in Tyrone Guthrie's up-dated version of \"The Alchemist\", in 1962. He repeated his Old Vic performance as Henry Bolingbroke for his Broadway debut at the Winter Garden Theatre in 1956. A notable later performance, while touring the U.S. and Canada, was as the Prince of Wales in Peter Stone's tale of the famous 19th century actor Edmund Kean (\"Kean\", 1961). In 1964, Gray won the Clarence Derwent Award as Best Supporting Actor for his part in the controversial play \"Poor Bitos\", by Jean Anouilh, co-starring Donald Pleasence. He was offered his first role on the big screen, reprising a success on the West End stage in 1958, as Captain Cyril Mavors,in the satirical musical Expresso Bongo (1959).\n\nFor the next forty years, heavy-set, silver-haired, jut-jawed Charles Gray used his imposing frame and mellifluous voice to great effect in creating for the screen a memorable gallery of egocentric, imperious toffs, and suave, sardonic super-villains. While his performances at times verged on the camp, Gray cheerfully allowed himself to be cast within his range of basically unsympathetic characters, which he could play well and with ease. He tended to favour television as his preferred medium, though some of his most popular roles were for the big screen. Among his niche of staple characters were the coldly pompous military heavies (General Gabler in Die Nacht der Generale (1967), or the perpetually sneering, overbearing upper-class twits (true-to-form, as defecting spy Hillary Vance in the Thriller (1973) episode \"Night is the Time for Killing\"). At his evil best, he was commanding as the demonic acolyte Mocata, in Die Braut des Teufels (1968) and as the feline-stroking, velvety-voiced nemesis of James Bond, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, in Diamantenfieber (1971). He was also suitably sinister as Bates the Butler, one of the red herrings of Agatha Christie's Mord im Spiegel (1980).\n\nGray's recurring roles included Lord Seacroft (senior, as well as junior) in the short-lived satirical miniseries The Upper Crusts (1973) as a down-on-his-heels aristocrat, keeping up appearances after being forced to live in a high-rise housing estate; and as the sedentary brother of the famous sleuth at 221b Baker Street, Mycroft, in Kein Koks für Sherlock Holmes (1976). Later, he was utilised as temporary replacement, first for Edward Hardwicke,and, subsequently, for the hospitalised star Jeremy Brett, in Granada Television's various instalments of the Sherlock Holmes saga (1985-1994). Gray died of cancer in March 2000, aged 71.\n\nCharles Christopher Parker Jr. was born on August 29, 1920, in a suburb of Kansas City, Missouri, to Charles Parker Sr. and his 18-year-old wife Addie. His father ran out on the family when Charlie was just a little boy. When he was 11 his mother bought him an alto saxophone for his birthday. By the time he was 15 Charlie was working as a musician in the flourishing Kansas City jazz scene. He also began drinking heavily and using drugs, which were also a part of the KC jazz scene, as were illegal after-hours gambling casinos.\n\nCharlie became more experienced by playing with various bands, including those of Lawrence Keyes and Harlan Leonard, before joining Jay McShann's band in 1940. The band was widely heard on radio across the country, so Charlie's saxophone playing became well known, even though people didn't know his name, so he became known as the Yardbird, or just The Bird. While still in Kansas City, Charlie reached a breakthrough: tired of playing solo with the same scales, he discovered that if he used a higher interval of the chords from a popular song or melody line, with a pianist or guitarist adding the appropriate new chords, he finally could play the sound he always had been hearing in his head. Essentially turning the melody line inside out, he began experimenting with this new style, which became known as \"bebop\".\n\nCharlie played with McShann in New York City until 1942, when he left for brief stints with the bands of pianist Earl 'Fatha' Hines and singer Billy Eckstine. The association with the Hines Orchestra was a significant one because of the other musicians, who included trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie. By 1945 Charlie was back in New York and leading his own small groups. He got married, but continued to live like a nomad, traveling from place to place and spending almost every other night in a hotel or boarding house. He also became a drug addict, and as his addiction increased so did his appetite, and he began putting on weight.\n\nCharlie took part in the first bebop recording session in 1945. With Gillespie and Miles Davis, he recorded songs like \"Billie's Bounce\" and \"Koko\" for Savoy Records. Not long afterward, he recorded such classic songs as \"A Night in Tunisia\" and \"Yardbird Suite\" for another small label, Dial Records. In the late 1940s Charlie toured Europe, where he was received like visiting royalty. He made several tours of Cuba, where he began experimenting with large string sections and Afro-Cuban rhythms. After a few years of relative stability, however, Charlie began a downward slide. He got hooked back on drugs again (heroin was his favorite), he began nodding out on bandstands, getting into fistfights and pawning his saxophones for drug money. Aware of the effects of drug use, he chastised younger sax players who emulated his heroin use.\n\nBy the early 1950s Charlie's drinking and drug use made him gray and prematurely lined. His self-abuse began to infringe on his musical ability. During this time, Charlie was befriended by a wealthy European baroness who was living in New York, loved his jazz music and helped him out when he needed it. In early 1955, on his way to a gig in Boston, Charlie stopped by her apartment for a visit. Alarmed by his obvious ill health, she had her personal doctor examine him, which revealed that he had stomach ulcers and many other health problems, the result of his years of drinking and drug use. The doctor recommended hospitalization, but the stubborn Charlie refused to consider it. The baroness got him to rest at her place for a few days.\n\nOn March 12, 1955, the baroness found Charlie Parker dead, slumped over in an easy chair in front of the TV set in her apartment. He was 34 years old. An autopsy revealed such damage to the inside of his body that the doctor who performed the autopsy thought Charlie was a man at least 50 years old. Charlie Parker's legend grew even larger after his death. Fans scrawled \"Bird Lives!\" on walls of jazz clubs from New York, to Los Angeles, to Paris, France. To this day, more than 40 years after his death, Bird remains jazz's single most venerated figure."
