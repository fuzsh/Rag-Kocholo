        "text": "The ostensible subject of “The Lifespan of a Fact” (directed by Leigh Silverman, at Studio 54) is the truth—what constitutes it and who gets to decide. Actually, the play is about the prerogatives demanded by an unyielding ego, here of the defensive-male variety. The script, which is credited to a trio of playwrights—Jeremy Kareken, David Murrell, and Gordon Farrell—is based on a curious book of the same name, from 2012, which grew out of an antagonistic e-mail correspondence between the writer John D’Agata and Jim Fingal, an intern at the magazine The Believer, who had been assigned to fact-check a piece D’Agata had written about Levi Presley, a teen-ager who committed suicide by leaping from the top of a Las Vegas hotel. What began as a string of simple factual queries from Fingal swiftly escalated into an epic tussle over questions of authorial invention and the nature of narrative nonfiction. D’Agata, who had apparently never encountered a fact that he was unwilling to fudge in the name of art, refused to give an inch; Fingal pressed on, growing more persnickety with each dispute. The tug-of-war lasted for half a decade.\n\nFor the purposes of the stage, it has been compressed into a frantic five days. When the action begins, it is Wednesday, and Jim Fingal (a charmingly insistent Daniel Radcliffe) is hovering in the office of Emily Penrose (the ever-sensitive Cherry Jones), the editor-in-chief of the magazine where he is interning. His usual duties amount to glorified coffee-fetching, but Emily has decided to crash John D’Agata’s Vegas piece into the upcoming issue, which must go to the printer first thing on Monday. The article needs a speedy fact-check, and Jim, who is quick to mention his Harvard pedigree, convinces her that he’s the man for the job. Earnestly scribbling in a Moleskine notebook, Jim radiates nervous energy and ambition; Emily notices the way he hungrily eyes her desk when she asks him where he sees himself in five years. But by Thursday morning he’s back in her office to report that he has gotten snagged on a tangle of errors:\n\nOkay, he says that on the day Levi died, “lap dancing was temporarily banned by the city,” but that doesn’t check out. The day before Levi died, the Las Vegas Sun wrote about a possible upcoming ban on touching strippers in fully nude establishments, but there’s nothing about a possible ban on lap dancing altogether in topless or even so-called go-go bars, where nipple nudity is essentially banned, but of course establishments get around that using pasties—\n\nAnd that’s just the second clause of D’Agata’s first sentence.\n\nSome writers might appreciate this scrupulous attention to detail. John (Bobby Cannavale) is not one of them. First, in an outraged fusillade of e-mails, which are cleverly projected onto a screen at the side of the stage, and then in person—growling bearishly into his phone as he sits in an overstuffed armchair, swaddled in an incongruous pink bathrobe—he tells Jim, in no uncertain terms, to piss off. He has written not an “article,” as Jim so thoughtlessly calls it, but an “essay,” a semantic distinction that lies at the core of John’s very sense of self. He is not a journalist, a small-minded fact-grubber; he is a literary essayist, a self-appointed heir to Herodotus, Cicero, Seneca, and Plutarch, who, in his view, “nudged details to create a closer understanding.” Isn’t he entitled to do some nudging of his own if it allows him to better convey the symbolic meaning of Levi Presley’s tragic death?\n\nThus are the battle lines drawn: soulful artist vs. nitpicking pedant, in John’s view; amoral fabricator vs. ethical realist, in Jim’s. The battle itself plays out mostly in John’s home in Vegas, where the playwrights contrive to send Jim so that the two foes can confront each other in the flesh; Emily eventually follows, to act as referee, or babysitter. (One wonders about the team effort it took to write this play about collaborative dysfunction.) John, who moved to Vegas to care for his ailing mother, is still living in her house after her death; he stalks around her dowdy, fifties-style living room, with its stiffly upholstered sofa and yellow floral wallpaper, like a wild animal stuck in the wrong habitat. Few actors do wounded masculinity better than Cannavale. His John, by turns petty, aggressive, and self-pitying, looms a head above Radcliffe’s Jim, pouring whiskey and slinging insults, plus the occasional fist, as the younger man stands his ground, piously pelting him with inaccuracy after inaccuracy.\n\nFor such a conceit to work, we have to believe in the merit of the thing that is in dispute. Is one essay really worth all this fuss? Time and again, we are reminded of the profundity of D’Agata’s writing. “David Foster Wallace called him one of America’s most significant living writers,” Jim, who has done his due diligence on Google, informs us; if there is such a thing as damning with strong praise, this kind of starry-eyed overreach might be it. As with the book version of “The Lifespan of a Fact,” the trouble here is that John’s literary style, and therefore his authority, depends on an accrual of exactly the kinds of niggling details that he is so eager to dismiss. His essay on Levi Presley is loaded with precise figures and dates; they’re just not the right ones. Take his explanation for why, in that fraught first sentence, he chose to inflate the number of strip clubs in Vegas from thirty-one to thirty-four: “I picked thirty-four because I liked the rhythm.” This is funny, even a little poignant. Writers are shown up as the pathetically vain, illogical creatures we are, and the scene ends with a big laugh from the audience. Less amusing, as Emily points out, is John’s assertion that a girl who jumped to her death on the same day as Levi killed herself by hanging. John wants his subject to feel unique. If the price is callous disregard for another person, well, that’s just aesthetic necessity.\n\nAs the play goes on, and its initially sharp comedy dulls into a repetitive deadlock, it becomes clear that John is a martyr not to his notion of poetic truth but to the demands of his paper-thin writerly pride. He can’t tolerate any of Jim’s interferences, no matter how valid or minute, because to do so would throw his whole identity into doubt. Why does he feel so victimized by scrutiny? Might it have something to do with his own depressive, possibly suicidal tendencies, which are hastily suggested as a kind of emotional shortcut by which to understand his intransigence; or with his relationship with his mother, whose presence is still so oppressively felt in her old home? We don’t find out. Instead, we get Emily as a representative of female authority, alternately cajoling and threatening the two men in an effort to reach some form of compromise as the hour grows ever later. Emily may be hardened in the way of tough women who’ve had to claw their way to the top—in the early scenes in her office, she wears black patent-leather brogues polished to a vicious sheen and displays a withering phone manner—but in Vegas she finds herself constrained by a more archetypal role. “Fuck off. I am not your mother,” she says to Jim—not that he, or John, is willing to stop behaving as if she were. Jones, a consummately generous performer, softens Emily’s rougher edges, but I wish that Silverman had found a way for her to serve as more than a mere foil to these bickering men."
