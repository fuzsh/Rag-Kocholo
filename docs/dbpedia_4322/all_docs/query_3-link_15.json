        "text": "Black Women Writers on Art, Love, and Freedom: A Personal Journey\n\nTuesday, April 16, 2019\n\n4:00 PM\n\nConrad Prebys Aztec Student Union Theatre\n\nFeaturing Emily Bernard\n\n“What did it mean for a Black woman to be an artist in our grandmothers’ time?” asks Alice Walker in her collection, In Search of Our Mothers’ Gardens: Womanist Prose. “It is a question with an answer cruel enough to stop the blood.” Throw love and marriage into the equation and the answer becomes even more chilling—and fascinating. Join Emily Bernard, Julian Lindsay Green and Gold Professor of English at the University of Vermont, and author of the acclaimed memoir Black is the Body: Stories from My Grandmother’s Time, My Mother’s Time, and Mine, as she takes us on a personal journey through literature written by black women, from slave narratives to the present, and discusses the struggles and triumphs of African American female characters that attempt to balance artistic sensibilities, domestic obligations, and a yearning to be free.\n\nPresented by the SDSU Common Experience on Time, the Department of Africana Studies, the Weber Honor College, the MALAS (Master of Arts in Liberal Arts and Sciences) program, Phi Alpha Theta, the History Honors Society, the Department of History, the Department of English and Comparative Literature, and the Department of Women's Studies.\n\n38th Annual Appleby Lecture - Finding Aztlan in a Lost Mexican Codex: Places Left Unfinished at the Time of Creation\n\nFriday, April 19, 2019\n\n4pm\n\nStorm Hall West 11\n\nThe History Department at San Diego State is excited to announce that the 38th Annual Appleby Lecture will be given by Professor Davíd Carrasco of Harvard University at 4 p.m. on April 19, 2019 in Storm Hall West 11. The Appleby Lecture is the most prominent annual lecture event sponsored by the History Department. Over the past forty years, the Appleby Lecture has been given by the most influential, distinguished historians in the field.\n\nThis year we are thrilled to host Dr. Davíd Carrasco, the inaugural Neil L. Rudenstine Professor of the Study of Latin America at Harvard University. Carrasco is an award-winning author of more than a dozen books, whose research and writing has focused on religion and spirituality among the Aztecs and other pre-contact Mesoamerican societies. He has worked extensively on major archeological sites, including the discovery and exploration of the Aztec Templo Mayor in Mexico City. In addition to his wide-ranging historical scholarship on the Mesoamerican past, Dr. Carrasco is a prominent public intellectual, whose work on Chicano and indigenous identity and spirituality has been featured on PBS. He has also collaborated on projects with leading figures in the United States and Mexico, including Cornell West, Toni Morrison, and Carlos Fuentes. The Mexican government has awarded him the highest honor given to a foreign citizen, the Mexican Order of the Aztec Eagle for his contributions to understanding the history and cultures of Mexico.\n\nThe talk will focus on the intellectual adventure of the rediscovery and group decipherment of the Mapa de Cuauhtinchan in which the search for Aztlan plays a prominent. Dating back to the 1540s, painted on bark paper, and measuring some three by six feet, the Mapa de Cuauhtinchan is an extraordinary historical document. It contains over seven hundred images and symbols relating the story of the emergence of ancestors at Chicomoztoc, their migration to the sacred city of Cholula, their foundation and settlement of Cuauhtinchan, their community's history and claim over the surrounding landscape, and many other occurrences along the way. The talk will touch upon the meanings and uses of the document, its complex narrative, and the social and ritual memory of an indigenous community struggling to hold its own in the turbulent atmosphere of early colonial Mexico.\n\nTroia (Portugal) or the “Portuguese Troy”: A Mystery in the Edge of the Roman Empire\n\nFriday, April 26, 2019\n\n7:15 pm – 9:00 pm\n\nArts and Letters Room 101\n\nDr. Filomena Limão (2018/19 AIA Kress Lecturer; Universidade Nova in Lisbon and Coordinator of ENCONTRHARTE (Encontros de História da Arte da Antiguidade) will present a lecture entitled “Troia (Portugal) or the “Portuguese Troy”: A Mystery on the Edge of the Roman Empire.”\n\nTroia is the name of a sandy peninsula located in the southwestern Atlantic coast of Portugal, on the left bank of the river Sado, where, in Roman times since the first century CE, an important industrial complex emerged. This lecture questions what Troia may have been in Roman times besides a noteworthy center for the production of salt fish goods as proven by the extensive workshops in the place. The current archaeological site of Troia preserves baths, insulae, domus, diverse funerary monuments and an early Christian basilica (second half of the 4th c CE), with painted walls. A bas-relief of the god Mithras, a sarcophagus, some sculpture and a composite capital reused in a domus ladder step, are just some more pieces of a vast history worth unveiling. Our aim is to better understand whether the strategic location of Troia may have allowed it to become a confluence place of people, ideas, religion, artistic trends, material resources. During Late Antiquity (6th c CE), Troia slowly declined and was forgotten until the Modern times. The discovery of Troia and the development of studies in the field of archaeology and art history nowadays, are expected to shed light in the understanding of the role of Troia in the dynamics of the Roman province of Lusitania.\n\nCo-sponsored with the San Diego Society of the Archaeological Institute of America.\n\nExperiencing War: Our Military, Community, Families and Selves\n\nTuesday March 12, 2019\n\n7:00 pm – 9:00 pm\n\nParma Payne Goodall Alumni Center\n\nA Conversation with New York Times Best-Selling Authors: Sebastian Junger and Karl Marmontes\n\nAward-winning authors Karl Marlantes and Sebastian Junger have written about the experience of war, its impact on both veterans and civilians, and the lack of connection between the two communities over multiple generations. Marlantes has written primarily about his experience as a Marine infantry officer in Vietnam, while Junger has explored current wars and conflicts, including Afghanistan, through the eyes of a cultural anthropologist and journalist. In this public event, they will discuss the impact of war at multiple levels from the military member to the community, our families and our selves.\n\nSponsored by the U.S.S. Midway and San Diego State University, including the Joan and Art Barron Veterans Center, Aztec Parents, Library, Department of History and the Dwight E. Stanford Chair in US Foreign Relations, The Institute for Ethics and Public Affairs, the College of Health and Human Services, the Department of Anthropology, and the Student Veterans Organization.\n\nDealing with Dead Bodies: Fact vs (Literary) Fiction\n\nFriday, March 01, 2019\n\n7:15 pm – 9:00 pm\n\nArts and Letters Room 101\n\nDr. Andrew McClellan (Stepsay Family Post Doctoral Fellow in Classics at SDSU) will present \"Dealing with Dead Bodies: Fact vs (Literary) Fiction.\"\n\nRomans were obsessed with the treatment of dead bodies. This obsession was largely a product of more or less universal Greco-Roman customs and standards dictating what were perceived to be the “rights” owed to dead bodies: e.g. corporeal preservation or integrity, funeral ritual, familial and/or communal rites of mourning, the last kiss, the closing of the eyes; also (depending on wealth and status) commemoration, procession, ritual laudationes or panegyrics, etc. (Polyb. 6.53-4; cf. Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom. 7.72). Evidence, both physical and textual, overwhelmingly suggests this system of funereal respect was upheld in practice. Why then are Rome’s most grand, elevated, and respected literary texts – epic poems – filled with scenes of corpse mistreatment and funeral perversion? Indeed, the increasing emphasis in Latin epic on gruesome and atrocious “death-cult” is the core feature in the literary thematics of Latin epic of the early Imperial period (c. 20 BCE to 100 CE). This talk aims to bridge the gap between reality and literary expression concerning the treatment of the dead by viewing the epics of Virgil (Aeneid), Ovid (Metamorphoses), Lucan (Bellum Civile), Valerius Flaccus (Argonautica), Statius (Thebaid), and Silius Italicus (Punica) through the lens of Roman historical precedence and ritual practice.\n\nCo-sponsored with the San Diego Society of the Archaeological Institute of America.\n\nMissed the event? No worries!

He will talk with us about central themes in his new book Why Learn History (When It’s Already on Your Phone). Sponsored by SDSU’s Common Experience program, the lecture should interest faculty and students at all levels and fields who value “an orientation to the world that... encourages reasoned skepticism, discourages haste, and counters our tendency to confirm our biases.” Critical thinking, Wineburg argues, can help all of us navigate the “dangerously mine-filled landscape” of our (mis) information-saturated world.\n\nCo-sponsored with the SDSU Common Experience Program\n\nChina’s Past and China’s Present: The Perils and Pay-Offs of Drawing Connections Between the Two\n\nWednesday, October 17, 2018\n\nMasterclass with Spy Novelist/Reporter Adam Brookes and China Historian Jeffrey Wasserstrom\n\nBig Brother States in Fact and Fiction: Thoughts on China and Other Places\n\nWednesday, October 17, 2018\n\nThis presentation will take the form of a public conversation in which the speakers will focus on issues of surveillance and control in not just China but also other parts of the world where some commentators claim that elements of the dark future George Orwell conjured up in Nineteen Eighty-Four can be found. How can concepts like that of the \"Big Brother State\" help or hinder efforts to make sense of the current era, when new technologies of communication have become so powerful in both efforts to challenge and efforts to assert authoritarian control? Are there other dystopian visions that are equally or more useful for thinking about authoritarian states and authoritarian trends in democracy societies? Do new technologies of surveillance make old genres, such as the Cold War era spy novel, obsolete or open new possibilities for their reinvention? These are the kinds of questions that the speakers will pose to one another before opening the discussion to for questions from the audience.\n\nAdam Brookes studied Chinese at the University of London, then worked as a foreign correspondent for the BBC (based in Indonesia, China and the United States), before switching gears to write a trio of acclaimed novels of international intrigue: Night Heron, Spy Games, and The Spy's Daughter. NPR selected his first book as its \"must-read thriller of the year\"; the Washington Post called it 'outstanding'; Kirkus Reviews said of his second that \"a smarter or more exciting mystery likely won't be released this year\"; while The Sun said of his third that it cemented his \"reputation as a superb spy novelist\" who draws comparisons to \"espionage heavyweights including John le Carré.\n\nJeffrey Wasserstrom spent much of the first part of his teaching career at Indiana University but is now Chancellor's Professor of History at UC Irvine, where he also serves as the Historical Writing Mentor for the Literary Journalism Program. He is the author or co-author of five books, including most recently the third edition of China in the 21st Century: What Everyone Needs to Know (Oxford, 2018). He edited the The Oxford Illustrated History of Modern China (Oxford, 2016), often writes for newspapers, magazines, and online publications, such as the Los Angeles Review of Books and its associated \"China Channel,\" and has been interviewed by both NPR and the BBC.\n\nView the flyer (pdf)\n\nCollections in Context: Researching the Histories of Museum Collections in the Badè Museum of Biblical Archaeology and the Global Museum at SFSU\n\nFriday, October 19, 2018\n\nMasterclass with Dr. Lissette Jimenez, SFSU\n\nWhile researching the histories of their collections, modern-day museums have encountered challenges that include ethical and moral considerations, questions of repatriation, and accurate interpretation for the public. This mid-day masterclass will explore some of these issues by examining the archival materials associated with two distinct university collections and their unique collections’ histories. The first is a collection of objects in the Badè Museum of Biblical Archaeology that was excavated in the 1920s-1930s in the Middle East and brought back to the Pacific School of Religion in Berkeley. The second is a collection of ancient Egyptian objects in the Global Museum at San Francisco State University that was purchased in the 1880s by Adolph Sutro on his travels to Egypt and brought back to San Francisco to be displayed at the Sutro Baths. Each of these collections possesses a complicated history pieced together by museum professionals in an attempt to further understand the context in which they were collected.\n\nCo-sponsored with the San Diego Society of the Archaeological Institute of America\n\nThe Sixth Sense: Multisensory Encounters with the Dead in Roman Egypt\n\nFriday, October 19, 2018\n\nDr. Lissette Jimenez, SFSU\n\nImage and representation have always played a central role in the commemoration of the dead in ancient Egypt. Ritual funerary practices were often multisensory experiences comprised of an intricate combination of visual, auditory, tactile, gustatory, and olfactory senses. This lecture investigates the multisensory experience of funerary practices in Roman Egypt and explores the experiential encounters between the material and temporal realms of the living and the dead. Painted portraits and shrouds attached to the mummified remains of the deceased, magical texts, ritual offerings, and the overall landscape of the tomb indicate that the practices of commemorating the deceased established participatory relationships where the living could experience and see the dead.\n\nPart of the San Diego Society of the Archaeological Institute of America 2018-19 Lecture Series\n\nDaniel Ellsberg: The Pentagon Papers, Whistleblowing, and Doomsday\n\nTuesday, October 2, 2018\n\nA conversation with Daniel Ellsberg with a Q&A to follow.\n\nEllsberg is the author of three books: The Doomsday Machine: Confessions of a Nuclear War Planner (2017,), Secrets: A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers (2002,) Risk, Ambiguity and Decision (2001,) and Papers on the War (1971).

Hopkins\n\nSmuts Professor of British Commonwealth History, Cambridge (Emeritus)\n\nWalter Prescott Webb Chair of History at the University of Texas at Austin (Emeritus)\n\nWednesday, April 11, 2018\n\nThe question of whether the USA is an empire is very current, given our military involvement in the Middle East and many other countries, and our economic engagements everywhere. But \"empire\" is an historical category, and assessing US activities against the background of the classic-case British and other European empires of recent centuries can help clarify modern events. Is the US an empire at all, and are empires bound to fall? Professor Hopkins, who has had a long career pioneering African, economic, British imperial, and global history, is making a major contribution to the debate on these questions. A Fellow of the British Academy, he is Smuts Professor of the History of the British Commonwealth (Emeritus) at Cambridge, Emeritus Fellow of Pembroke College, Cambridge, and Walter Precott Webb Chair of History at the University of Texas at Austin (Emeritus), where he won university-wide teaching awards. He is the former editor of both the Journal of African History and the Economic History Review -- the most prestigious journals in these fields. With Peter Cain, he is the author of British Imperialism, 1688-2015 (3rd edn, Routledge, 2016), a monumental work that reimagines British history as a part of the world economic system. The first edition of this book won the Morris Forkosch Prize from the American Historical Association in 1996, for the best recent book in British or British imperial history.\n\nThere will also be a masterclass for students at 1pm in AL-524.\n\nSponsored by the Department of History and Dwight E.

Among his many books are the acclaimed Bloodlands: Europe between Hitler and Stalin (2010) and Black Earth: The Holocaust as History and Warning (2015). Translated into 33 languages, Bloodlands has won twelve awards, including a Literature Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and the Hannah Arendt Prize in Political Thought. The widely translated Black Earth has also received multiple honors, including an award from the Dutch Auschwitz Committee. Professor Snyder’s most recent publication, On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century (2017), offers a series of parables, at once chilling and inspiring, about the dangers facing countries across the globe where democratic ideals are imperiled.\n\nThis event is free and open to the public!\n\nProfessor Snyder’s lecture is part of this year’s Common Experience program and has been sponsored by the College of Arts and Letters and the SDSU Institute for Ethics and Public Affairs.

During the 2014-2015 mission of the Institut Français d'Archéologie Orientale at Deir el-Medina, however, Austin's team identified the mummy of a woman with over thirty separate, figural tattoos placed along her arms, neck, and shoulders. These tattoos offer our only evidence of Pharaonic tattooing to date and provide us an unusual glimpse into the world of tattooing and worship in daily life. Austin's talk reviews the significance of this tattooed mummy from Deir el-Medina through a systematic analysis of the placement, orientation, order, and symbolism of her tattoos. These tattoos created a permanent and public association of this woman with worship of the goddess Hathor, even allowing her body to be used as a potential vehicle for the goddess herself through the repeated motif of the divine Wadjet eyes. This mummy therefore not only offers a unique and significant contribution to our understanding of the practice of tattooing in ancient Egypt, but also the potential roles of women in religious worship in ancient Egypt.\n\nCo-sponsored with the San Diego Society of the Archaeological Institute of America.\n\nView the event flyer (.pdf) | View the event follow-up (.pdf)\n\nHistory Masterclass: Reconstructing Health Care in the Distant Past --- Case Studies from New Kingdom Egypt (1550-1070 BCE)\n\nFriday, February 23, 2018\n\nwith Prof. Anne Austin (University of Missouri, St. Louis)\n\nWe often think of health care as part of the modern state, but could organized health care have existed in the past as well? If so, how would we know? This masterclass will test the limits of our knowledge of past health care by evaluating evidence for care in ancient Egypt's New Kingdom period (1550-1070 BCE). We will explore translated Egyptian texts ranging from bureaucratic records (including recorded sick days and ration distributions) to medical papyri (like medical treatises and amuletic texts) to find evidence for health care in the ancient world. We will debate what constitutes care, how it was used, and who did (or did not) have access to it. We will also discuss when it does or does not appear in the archaeological and textual records.\n\nView the event flyer (.pdf)\n\nLecture and Masterclass: China's Cold War\n\nFriday, February 9, 2018\n\nFeaturing Yiming Feng of the Center for Cold War International History Studies at East China Normal University, Shanghai\n\nMasterclass for Graduate Students, 2:00-3:00pm, in AL 566\n\nLearn more about the Chinese archives on the Cold War and related matters.\n\nThe session will be moderated by Prof. Grace Cheng (Political Science).\n\nPublic Lecture, 3:30-5:00pm, in AL 102\n\nExplore the origins of China's \"rise.\" Understand China's past to make better sense of its current situation.

The exhibit is in conjunction with the film, An Open Door, Holocaust Haven in the Philippines, to be shown on campus on November 9th.\n\nThe collection was assembled by a cantor who had an extraordinary, but brief life.\n\nCantor Cysner was bor n in 1912 in Bamberg, Germany. He graduated from the Teacher's College in Wurzburg, Germany in 1933 and in 1937 he was granted a life contract to the Hamburg Temple, the first permanent Reform synagogue and one of the rare Jewish edifices not destroyed during Kristallnacht. Unfortunately, within the year he was deported to Zbaszyn, a detention site on the Polish border with Germany, where he performed as a cantor and taught music to the other prisoners.\n\nHe was allowed to leave in 1939 when he was granted a position at Temple Emil in Manila, The Philippines. He served that congregation and taught music at De La Salle College and Centro Escolar University. In Manila, he performed regularly on the radio and gave concerts for the president of the Philippines.\n\nWhen the Japanese invaded, he was imprisoned in Santo Tomas Internment Camp for eight months and then conditionally released, forced to wear an armband and always under scrutiny. His house was burned by the retreating Japanese and many of his books and manuscripts were lost. The synagogue was also burned and Cantor Cysner then conducted services for the US Armed Forces in the Philippines. Thousands attended his Kol Nidre Service in Rizal Stadium in 1945.\n\nAfter the war, he came to San Francisco and served Temple Sherith Israel from 1946-1949. His last appointment was at Tifereth Israel Synagogue in San Diego where he remained until his death in 1961.\n\nHis collection resides at the Jewish Historical Society of San Diego Archives in the Jewish Studies Reading Room at SDSU's Love Library. It consists of materials from his internment at Zbaszyn, including a diary; from his time as a cantor and teacher in Manila and from his internment at Santo Tomas. There are also materials from his cantorial work in San Francisco and San Diego. The collection includes music he composed, photos, and artifacts. Much of the material is one-of-a-kind and not vailable from any other source.\n\nSponsored by the Jewish Historical Society of San Diego, the SDSU History Department, the SDSU Jewish Studies program, and Special Collections & University Archives\n\nDownload the exhibit flyer (.pdf)\n\nScreening of An Open Door: Holocaust Haven in the Philippines\n\nNovember 9, 2017 @ 6:30 PM in Conrad Prebys Aztec Student Union, Theater\n\nAn Open Door: Holocaust Haven in the Philippines is a historical documentary that presents the dramatic story of rescue and friendship in an effort to save thousands of Jewish lives. As Nazi persecutions intensified in the 1930s, refugees sought distant havens scattered around the world. Philippine President Manuel Quezon granted refuge to over one thousand persecuted Jews, offering a sanctuary of religious freedom and cultural acceptance in the Philippines.\n\nThe Film has won: Best Picture, World Humanitarian Awards, Bali; Silver Telly Award in History, highest honor; Best Documentary, White Nights Film Festival, St. Petersburg, Russia; Best Feature Documentary, Madrid IFF and London IFF; plus 7 other international awards.\n\nSpecial Guests\n\nConsul General, the Honorable Adelio Angelito S.

Traditionally, Diocletian’s Palace has been described as a unique combination of an imperial villa and a typical Roman military camp. Recent research has established the probable original purpose of the complex in Split as the imperial manufacture of textiles. It was later, most likely already during the construction, adapted for the residence of the retired Emperor. Detailed architectural analysis shows that the mistakes in the design and execution, and the unfinished decoration can be explained by the change of architectural concept which occurred probably during the first phase of construction, and by the very short deadline given to the builders by the Emperor who probably retired to his palace in Split earlier than originally planned. Finally, a new interpretation is given of this complex building, in terms of design and construction process.\n\nView the event follow-up (.pdf)\n\nWhy Vietnam Still Matters\n\nThursday, October 5, 2017\n\nA leading authority on the Vietnam War, Professor Asselin presents his first public lecture as SDSU's Stanford Chair in U.S. Foreign Relations. This talk will explore the more crucial aspects and enduring legacies of the American military intervention in the tiny Southeast Asian country.\n\nVietnam is much more than a country. It is an evocation, a cause, a slogan. It is a defining chapter in the history of the United States, and the label of a global era. It is an incantation for some, a specter for others. Vietnam is a virtual brand name. Why is this all the case? Why do we keep evoking Vietnam? What accounts for the enduring preoccupation with it in US political, military, and academic circles? Why can we not discuss American foreign policy since then, including the recent campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan, without conjuring it, without framing the discussion within a \"post-Vietnam\" context? This talk explores the more crucial aspects and enduring legacies of the American military intervention in the tiny Southeast Asian country.\n\nPierre Asselin holds a Ph.D. from the University of Hawaii at Manoa. His area of primary expertise is the history of American foreign relations, with a focus on East and Southeast Asia and the larger Cold War context. He is a leading authority on the Vietnam War, and is particularly interested in the decision-making of Vietnamese communist authorities in the period 1954-75. He speaks Vietnamese and regularly travels to Vietnam for research. His interest in internationalism and transnationalism during the Vietnam War has taken him to various other document repositories, including the Algerian National Archives.\n\nRevolutionizing the American Presidency: Donald J.

McCann of Boston University\n\nThis lecture is a chance to talk about water and power – and to do that in two senses: First to talk about the use of water generate electric power for a country and a transnational region. In this case the Blue Nile river that empties the Ethiopian highlands and feeds the Nile watershed as it flows west and then north to Sudan and Egypt. Second, is to talk about water and power in the sense of people’s beliefs about water, its meaning, and control of it. What people (s) believe about the power of water may be as important as its reality.\n\nDocumentary Film Screening: Chinese Couplets by Felicia Lowe\n\nWed, March 22, 2018\n\nChinese Couplets reveals the impact of the Chinese Exclusion Acts on one family over four generations of women in three countries over two centuries. Told from the filmmaker’s point-of-view, the documentary explores the universal themes of intergenerational strife between immigrants and their American-born children. In particular, it discusses the often painful price paid by immigrants who abandoned their personal identities and homes, and the burden of silence passed onto their offspring. Through one family’s history, Chinese Couplets reveals the complex and contradictory nature of our national identity: an America that embraces and welcomes immigrants, while at the same time demonstrates profound xenophobia and excludes successive waves of ethnic and racial newcomers.\n\nSponsored by Department of History, the Center for Asian and Pacific Studies, the Confucius Institute, the Department of Women's Studies, and the Department of Political Science next week.\n\nMasterclass: From Real to Reel with Filmmaker Felicia Lowe\n\nThursday, March 23, 2017\n\nIn the class, filmmaker Lowe will discuss how to make historical documentaries. She will discuss the process and art of creating documentaries. She will examine the relationship between public policies and personal identity within families and the larger community.\n\nFelicia Lowe is an award winning independent producer, director, and writer. Her films, Chinese Couplets, Chinatown: The Hidden Cities of San Francisco, Carved in Silence, and China: Land of My Father have received numerous awards.\n\nSponsored by Department of History, the Center for Asian and Pacific Studies, the Confucius Institute, the Department of Women's Studies, and the Department of Political Science next week.\n\nArchaeological Institute of America, San Diego Society - Spring 2017 Lectures\n\nThe Ancient Athenian Naval Bases in the Piraeus - The Backbone of the World's First Democracy\n\nLecturer: Bjørn Lové (SAXO Institute, University of Copenhagen)\n\nFriday, February 17, 2017\n\nAthens in the 5th and 4th century BC was preeminent because of her naval power, and with the navy’s importance came that of her harbour city, the Piraeus, where naval bases housed the hundreds of triremes that served as the primary arm of Athenian might. The architectural glories of the Acropolis stood in second place to her naval bases. As an unnamed Athenian writer sang, “O Athens, queen of all cities! How fair your naval base! How fair your Parthenon! How fair your Piraeus!”\n\nThe Zea Harbour Project, digging on land and underwater in 2002 to 2012, has uncovered extensive archaeological remains of the Athenian naval facilities. This lecture will explore a complex archaeological puzzle and show how the remains can be connected to the dawn of Athenian power in the late 6th and early 5th century BC; to the young democracy at the time of the Persian Wars; to the age of empire when Athens ruled the eastern Mediterranean; and to the waning years of the 4th century BC when Athens stood in the shadow of Macedonia.\n\nThe Zea Harbour Project is a collaboration between the Ephorate of Underwater Antiquities and the Ephorate of West Attica, Piraeus and Islands (both under the Greek Ministry of Culture and Sports), the SAXO-Institute, the University of Copenhagen, and the Danish Institute at Athens under the Danish Ministry of Education. It is directed by Dr. Bjørn Lovén. The Carlsberg Foundation finances the project.\n\nAncient tokens and communities: Insights into Hellenistic and Roman Sicily\n\nLecturer: Dr. Antonino Crisà (Archaeologist, numismatist, and Research Fellow at the University of Warwick)\n\nMonday, March 6, 2017\n\nTokens are commonly defined as coin-like gadgets, produced and distributed instead of usual coins. Nowadays, we still use plastic tokens to store our coat at a museum cloakroom or to access to a fun fair. As coins, tokens can be found at archaeological excavations, proving that they were issued, used and finally lost in the ground. Hundreds of Greek and Roman tokens (or tesserae) have been discovered on the agorà of Athens and along the Tiber’s river banks in Rome. These finds have never been properly investigated on the whole.\n\nThe University of Warwick is currently undertaking an EU-funded research project to comprehend the role of tokens in the ancient Mediterranean communities, focusing on archaeological contexts, iconographies and museum collections. The aim of my talk is to outline the project and discuss a selection of case studies on unpublished Hellenistic and Roman tokens found in Sicily (especially in the provinces of Palermo and Messina). I therefore assess archaeological evidence and provide data on find spots, history of excavations, iconographies, aspects of local religion and economy. Such information helps us contextualize the tokens and understand how local communities in the provincia Sicilia produced and used these artifacts on a local scale.\n\nHumanities and Inquiries: An Interdisciplinary Outreach Series\n\nTuesday, Feb 21, 2017\n\nPhi Alpha Theta and Umanisti present the inaugural lecture of Humanities and Inquiries: An Interdisciplinary Outreach Series\n\nFrom Difference to Similarity: Amazons and the Theory of the ‘Other’ in Classics\n\nDr. Walter Penrose\n\nAlso presenting Christine Wong: In Sickness and In Sleep: Dreams, Magic and Healing in the Sacred Tales of Aelius Aristides.\n\n‘Excavating’ into the archives: archaeology, social contexts and unknown characters in Sicily (1861–1918)\n\nTuesday, March 7, 2017\n\nwith ANTONINO CRISÀ (University of Warwick)\n\nCan archaeologists dig without excavating? An intriguing method of archaeological investigation is generated from tracing, copying and analyzing records. It allows us to gather valuable, substantial and accurate data on past excavations. The history of archaeology is therefore a fascinating subject, which still needs to be deeply investigated. Many records are still unpublished and wait—covered by dust—to be studied by scholars.\n\nThe Kingdom of Italy became a nation in 1861, acquiring a huge cultural heritage from the pre-unification states. In particular, Sicily had a multitude of archaeological sites to be supervised, investigated and visited. What do we actually know about this period in the history of archaeology in Sicily and how can we reconstruct excavations and reveal contemporary (often unknown) characters acting in these archaeological contexts? What was the impact of archaeology on local communities in Sicily?\n\nThe scope of this paper is to provide an outline of recent research in the province of Messina during the post-unification era. Documentary materials offer much information on the evolution of archaeological discipline, cultural heritage, archaeologists, illegal diggers, priests as unlawful antiquities dealers, collectors, custodians, workers, politicians and state authorities.\n\nSponsored by Departments of History and Classics & Humanities\n\nView the event flyer (.pdf)\n\nNew Article\n\nCongratulations to Dr. David Cline – his latest article, \"(Co)Constructing Public Memories: Interdisciplinary Approaches to Creating Born-Digital Oral History Archives,\" was just published in Collections: A Journal for Museum and Archives Professionals, 13 (2), 123-132.

The book is a biography about British General Charles James Napier, known as a peacemaker in England and a warmonger in Asia.\n\nNew Book by Penrose\n\nProfessor Walter Penrose's new book entitledPostcolonial Amazons: Female Masculinity and Courage in Ancient Greek and Sanskrit Literature (Oxford, England: Oxford University Press, 2016) was published by Oxford University Press in the United Kingdom on Nov. 3, 2016, and will be published in the U.S.A. on Jan. 3, 2017.\n\nScholars have long been divided on the question of whether the Amazons of Greek legend actually existed. Notably, Soviet archaeologists' discoveries of the bodies of women warriors in the 1980s appeared to directly contradict western classicists' denial of the veracity of the Amazon myth, and there have been few concessions between the two schools of thought since.\n\nPostcolonial Amazons offers a ground-breaking re-evaluation of the place of martial women in the ancient world, bridging the gap between myth and historical reality and expanding our conception of the Amazon archetype. By shifting the center of debate to the periphery of the region known to the Greeks, the startling conclusion emerges that the ancient Athenian conception of women as weak and fearful was not at all typical of the world of that time, even within Greece. Surrounding the Athenians were numerous peoples who held that women could be courageous, able, clever, and daring, suggesting that although Greek stories of Amazons may be exaggerations, they were based upon a real historical understanding of women who fought.\n\nWhile re-examining the sources of the Amazon myth, this compelling volume also resituates the Amazons in the broader context from which they have been extracted, illustrating that although they were the quintessential example of female masculinity in ancient Greek thought, they were not the only instance of this phenomenon: masculine women were masqueraded on the Greek stage, described in the Hippocratic corpus, took part in the struggle to control Alexander the Great's empire after his death, and served as bodyguards in ancient India. Against the backdrop of the ongoing debates surrounding gender norms and fluidity, Postcolonial Amazons breaks new ground as an ancient history of female masculinity and demonstrates that these ideas have a much longer and more durable heritage than we may have supposed.\n\nRead his blog entries: Hillary and History: How Powerful Women have been Maligned through the Agesand More than an Amazon:Wonder Woman.\n\nJoanne Ferraro Speaking Engagements\n\nAfter over 10 years as chair of the History department, Joanne Ferraro has returned to teaching and will continue her various speaking engagements.
