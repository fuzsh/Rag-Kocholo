        "text": "At the height of the English floods last summer, Antony Penrose, Lee Miller’s only child, picked me up at Ashford station and drove me through the teeming rain to Farley Farm in East Sussex. The farm is a rambling, green place with sculptures in the gardens and paintings throughout the house. It has been largely untouched since Lee Miller, the model, war correspondent, artist, portrait photographer, Surrealist muse and cook, died in 1977. It is where she lived the last years of her life with her husband, the artist Roland Penrose.\n\nI had come to trawl through Miller’s letters, her notebooks from World War II; her negatives, her prints; and finally, in the room that was her bedroom, slip on her wool war-correspondent’s uniform made on Savile Row shortly before the D-Day invasion. It nearly, but not quite, fit. Her arms were shorter than mine, she was less busty. But it hardly mattered. I felt I had come as close as I could to the woman who was so mysterious and beautiful, so talented but also so demonically difficult that she was tactfully called iconic.\n\nI had been fascinated with Miller for more than two decades. I first saw her photos at the Photographers’ Gallery in London in 1986. I stood staring at black-and-white photos of London during the blitz; of the fall of Munich; of American grunts marching through the mud in Alsace as they fought to liberate Europe.\n\nHer earlier work was there, too: Egypt in the 1930s and Paris in the 1920s. I was utterly transfixed, particularly by her war photos. Lee’s best compositions were of ordinary people, of civilians during wartime. I had no idea then that many years later, reporting my own wars, I would look to her for inspiration.\n\nBut who was this woman? A photograph at the gallery showed a beautiful blonde with a cap of sunlit hair. She looked too stunning to be a war correspondent, but I would later see photos of Lee taken during the war by her lovers (there were many) and friends, and you can see the exhaustion in her eyes, and the defeat that comes from witnessing such trauma.\n\nStill, she must have unnerved people when they saw a woman who looked more like a supermodel than a photographer huddled in a foxhole during the siege of St.-Malo or barreling down the road in her car following the Allied advance through Europe. Along with her great friend, the Life magazine photographer David Scherman, she was one of the first to arrive at Hitler’s secret apartments — “I had his address in my pocket for years,” she would blithely say — where she stripped off her clothes and her muddy boots, fresh with the dirt of Dachau, and slid into Hitler’s bathtub to wash. Then she would sleep in his bed. “Mein host was not home,” she liked to say. But his telephone line was still working.\n\n“Naturally I took pictures,” she told the celebrity radio interviewer Ona Munson in 1946, in her deep movie-star voice. “What’s a girl supposed to do when a battle lands in her lap?”\n\nA short time before the Photographers’ Gallery show, Antony Penrose’s book “The Lives of Lee Miller” was released. The book had a strange provenance. During his childhood, Penrose knew nothing of his mother’s past life, and the book, in a sense, is his love letter to a woman he never really knew. At the end of her life, after the war, Miller was sad and embittered, and her only child remembers her as a “drunk” who often embarrassed him with her frank, unnerving comments. She was distant and difficult.\n\n“Lee had trouble loving anyone,” he told me, explaining that she was raped as a child by a family friend, which left her with venereal disease. The treatment in those days was painful and invasive, and the counseling afterward cautioned the tiny girl not to confuse sex with love. “It had lasting scars for the rest of her life,” Penrose said. It might account for the many lovers she left scattered across Europe, the Middle East and America.\n\nIgnorant about the wars, Penrose knew his mother and his father, Roland — a founder of the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London and a leading Surrealist painter — only as a pair of eccentric bohemians who had guests like Picasso and Man Ray at Farley Farm.\n\n“Our house was filled with art and crammed with crazy people,” he said with a shrug. “I thought everyone’s was.” He became a farmer, the antithesis of his parents’ life. But after Miller died, Penrose’s wife Suzanna was rummaging through the attic when she came upon some notebooks. “You better have a look at these,” she told her husband. He opened one and began to read his mother’s notes from the war. Then he found boxes and boxes — a roomful, in fact — of her prints and negatives. Slowly, he unwove the fantastic puzzle of his mother’s life.\n\nHow could he not have known? “When Lee closed something, she closed it,” he said firmly. “I knew she was handy with a camera when I was little — but that was about it. She never talked about the war.”\n\nBut Miller was haunted by it and gave up journalism in 1956 and took to running Farley Farm. She became a gourmet cook, specializing, as her housekeeper, Patsy, remembers, in “historical food” like roast suckling pig and Surrealist fare like marshmallows in Coca-Cola sauce, a concoction she made to annoy the snooty English critic Cyril Connolly, who had once rudely told her Americans could not cook.\n\nBut the war, and certainly her childhood rape and the loss of her extraordinary beauty, threw Miller into dark moods. She was, in many ways, tormented by her gleaming past.\n\nBorn in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., in 1907, Miller fled her conventional life — and a rather odd father who took photographs of her naked — to model in Manhattan. She was discovered by Condé Nast, but when a portrait of her taken by Edward Steichen was used as a Kotex ad, she ran away to Paris. She was a pupil of Man Ray, who did not take apprentices, but as she told it, she marched into his studio and announced, “I’m your new student.” Over the course of four years, they developed the technique of solarization, and Man Ray became obsessed with her.\n\nShe became a muse for the Surrealists, a lover of Picasso and a buddy of Paul Ãluard, Jean Cocteau and others. She played the female lead, a statue, in Cocteau’s film “The Blood of a Poet,” which caused a jealous feud with Man Ray.\n\nEventually, Miller grew bored of Paris, the parties, the pretty frocks and the promiscuity, and wed an elegant Egyptian, Aziz Eloui Bey. She tried to live a sedate life with him in Cairo. She picked up her camera and photographed the pyramids; did portraits of “the black-satin-and-pearls set,” and most notably took the photo of the desert near Siwa that Magritte saw and used as inspiration for his 1938 painting “Le Baiser.”\n\nBut “boredom was starting to creep into her life,” Penrose writes. So she bolted for London.\n\nWhen the war broke out, she was on a ship headed for England. Though women were not technically allowed to be at the front, Miller was British Vogue’s sole accredited correspondent, and she did what she wanted. Besides, as Penrose points out, what soldier could have resisted her?\n\nShe hit her stride during the war. Her war photography is some of the best I have ever seen. Penrose later published another book, “Lee Miller’s War,” which shows her pictures of airstrikes, battles, a top-secret napalm strike. But it also has pictures of civilians: women collaborators; a lost child perched on a road sign looking exhausted and terrified; a young German girl soon after her suicide. Along with Scherman, Miller followed the Allied advance through Europe after D-Day, going everywhere, frightened by nothing.\n\n“Her photographs shocked people out of their comfort zone,” said Mark Haworth-Booth, who is the curator of “The Art of Lee Miller,” a retrospective of her life, which is currently at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and will be traveling to the Philadelphia Museum of Art in January.\n\nHaworth-Booth added: “She had a chip of ice in her heart. She got very close to things. Margaret Bourke-White was far away from the fighting, but Lee was close. That’s what makes the difference — Lee was prepared to shock.”\n\nShe arrived in Paris on the day of liberation and followed the Allies into Germany. After Germany’s surrender, she wrote one of her most passionate articles for Vogue, “Germans Are Like This.” Haworth-Booth said, “She wanted people to see how amazingly a fashion magazine like Vogue could publish something so brutal.” She then headed to Eastern Europe to see the aftermath of war.\n\nPenrose believes that this is possibly when Miller snapped. She was disappointed and angered by what war had done: how it had broken down society. In one notebook, I looked at the notes she wrote to accompany perhaps her most powerful war photo: of a child dying in a hospital in Vienna. The hospital was equipped with everything but badly needed drugs. Miller sat by the bed with a doctor and a nun, helpless as the tiny child faded away. Later, she slashed out the lead to her story for Vogue in the notebook, her pencil marks angry and heavy. Reading her notes, 60 years later, I can still feel how furious, how sad she was.\n\nWhen she returned to Paris, she collapsed in a depressed heap at the Hotel Scribe. Eventually, she picked herself up out of the litter of empty booze bottles in her room and joined Penrose in England. The two had an open relationship. She was on a train headed for an assignment in St. Moritz when she discovered, at 40, that she was pregnant with Antony.\n\nBut she was not really the maternal type and found peacetime and the countryside boring. One day, no one knows why, Miller packed away her cameras. She then embarked on a life as a cook. In her kitchen — which still has her black-and-white curtains, her mixing bowls and cookbooks like “A Taste of Texas” and “South American Cooking” — are menus for dinner parties (“taramasalata; ceviche; kipper pÃ¢té; sliced pot roast”). Over her stove is a tile that Picasso painted. “Oh, that,” Patsy says nonchalantly when I point it out. “He was here. He ate and drank like everyone else.”"
