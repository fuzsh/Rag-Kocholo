        "text": "The Joint Commission defines sentinel events as unexpected occurrences involving death or serious physical or psychological injury or the risk thereof.1 Such events are called “sentinel” because they signal the need for immediate investigation and response. Although The Joint Commission allows hospitals to define their own list of additional sentinel events, mandatory reportable surgical events include surgery on the wrong patient, surgery on the wrong site, performing the wrong procedure, operating room fire, and unintended retention of a foreign object. Sentinel events overlap with the National Quality Forum (NQF) list of serious reportable errors (termed colloquially as “never events”).2\n\nThe surgical checklist was adapted from the aviation industry to eliminate catastrophic accidents and is currently used in approximately 75% of operating rooms around the world.3 Checklists encompass many commonly labeled facets including preoperative huddles, in-room boarding process, preincisional time-outs, postoperative debriefs, and transfers to the next level of care. Checklists serve to increase communication, standardize review of pre- and postsurgical concerns, and prevent sentinel events. Although surgical checklists are now widely used, adherence to optimal use is variable. Furthermore, much of the evidence supporting checklists has centered around general surgery,4,5 while the evidence within otolaryngology has been more limited.\n\nWe set out to understand sentinel events that occur in the modern operating room since the World Health Organization (WHO) published the surgical safety checklist as part of their Safe Surgery Saves Lives campaign in 2009, sparking widespread adoption. We surveyed members of the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) on the use of surgical safety checklists, intraoperative sentinel events, and responses to such events. This survey investigated wrong-site, wrong-patient, and wrong-surgery incidents; all types of airway fires; inadvertent administration of wrong medication; and retained surgical items.\n\nResults\n\nDemographics\n\nA total of 11,188 survey invitations were sent to members of the AAO-HNS, and 543 (4.9%) AAO-HNS members responded. Demographic characteristics of survey respondents are shown in . At least 1 component of a surgical safety checklist was used by 511 (98.6%) respondents ( ). In addition, 404 (78%) respondents used a separate time-out specific to the prevention of surgical fires. At least 1 intraoperative sentinel event was reported by 131 (25.2%) of respondents. Two events were reported by 13 respondents (2.5%), 3 events by 4 respondents (0.8%), and 4 events by 1 respondent (0.2%).\n\nTable 1.\n\nn%Gender Male12222.5 Female42177.5Age, y <4010519.3 40-5029554.3 >5014326.3Years in practice <1014426.5 10-2027350.3 >2012623.2Practice type Academic18433.9 Military142.6 Multispecialty group8215.1 Otolaryngology group19035.0 Solo7313.4Practice specialty area Facial plastic and reconstructive surgery305.5 General otolaryngology29554.3 Head and neck oncology6211.4 Laryngology193.5 Otology/neurotology417.6 Pediatric otolaryngology6812.5 Rhinology/skull base/allergy275.0 Sleep medicine10.2\n\nTable 2.\n\nn%Q6: Component of a time-out and/or surgical safety checklist used at institution (n = 518) Preoperative marking of surgical site49795.9 An “All Stop” to direct all attention to the checklist37973.2 Time-out to confirm correct patient identification, correct procedure site, and correct procedure51198.6 Discussion of any special medications or equipment43083.0 Debrief including discussion of instrument, sponge, and needle counts after completion of procedures39876.8 No surgical safety checklist or time-out procedure routinely performed61.2 I have no idea what components are included20.4\n\nWrong-Site Surgery\n\nThere were 38 (7.3%) of respondents who reported a wrong-site surgical event in the past 10 years ( ).

There were 4 (22.2%) airway fires during endoscopic procedures, 1 (5.6%) airway fire during an open procedure, and 3 (16.7%) other types of fire. These fires occurred during monitored anesthesia care in 5 (27.8%), during endoscopic airway surgery in 2 (11.1%), during endoscopic laser airway surgery in 2 (11.1%), during tonsillectomy in 2 (11.1%), during tracheostomy in 1 (5.6%), and unspecified in 5 (33.4%).

These events included errors injecting concentrated epinephrine (27.9%), administration of a medication to which a patient had a known allergy (19.7%), anesthetic/paralytic related (15.2%), injection of oxymetazoline (6.6%), wrong antibiotic, other topical/intralesional medications, over administration of opioids (3.3%), and other events (13.6%).\n\nRetained Surgical Item\n\nCases involving a retained surgical item ( ) were reported by 33 (6.4%) respondents. The retained surgical items included sponges (28.1%), temporary splint or packing (28.1%), instrument (9.4%), needle (3.1%) lost screw/hardware (3.1%), and other items (28.1%). The factors most strongly associated with retained surgical items included error in surgical count (16.7%), item not included in surgical count (16.7%), multiple teams in the operating room (12.5%), and surgical count erroneously correct (12.5%).\n\nImpact and Response to Sentinel Events\n\nPatient safety events resulting in a least temporary harm (category d-h, ) were most common in surgical fires (76.9%) followed by retained surgical items (24.1%), wrong-medication (15.9%), and wrong-site surgery (14.7%). Disclosure to patient and/or family/caregivers occurred in 97.1% of wrong-site surgical events, 86.2% of retained surgical items, 66.7% of wrong-medication events, and 53.8% of surgical fires. Institutional investigations were conducted in 63.2% to 88.4% of cases and most commonly included root cause analysis and actions.\n\nTable 5.\n\nn (%)How patient affected by event(a) Error occurred but did not reach patient(b) Error occurred and reached patient but no harm(c) Error occurred and reached patient who required additional monitoring or action to ensure no harm(d) Error occurred causing temporary harm(e) Error occurred causing temporary harm, requiring prolonged hospitalization and/or operative intervention(f) Error occurred causing permanent harm(g) Error Occurred causing permanent harm, requiring prolonged hospitalization and/or operative intervention(h) Error occurred that required intervention to sustain life(j) Other Q10: Wrong site/patient/procedure (n = 34)0 (0)25 (73.5)3 (8.8)4 (11.8)1 (2.9)0 (0)0 (0)0 (0)1 (2.9) Q20: OR fire (n = 13)5 (14.7)1 (7.7)2 (15.4)8 (61.5)0 (0)1 (7.7)0 (0)1 (7.7)0 (0) Q28: Medication error (n = 57)4 (11.8)29 (50.8)18 (31.6)1 (1.8)5 (8.8)0 (0)1 (1.8)2 (3.5)1 (1.8) Q36: Retained surgical item (n = 29)3 (8.8)15 (51.7)4 (13.8)2 (6.9)5 (17.2)0 (0)0 (0)0 (0)3 (10.3)Event disclosed to patient or patient’s family/caregivers(a) No disclosure (no reference to adverse event or error)(b) All harmful errors disclosed(c) Explanation provided for why the error occurred(d) Discussion of how the error’s effects will be minimized(e) Steps the physician (and institution) will take to prevent recurrence(f) Apology for error(g) Other Q11: Wrong site/patient/procedure (n = 34)1 (2.9)26 (76.5)29 (85.3)16 (47.1)18 (52.9)26 (76.5)0 (0) Q22: OR fire (n = 13)6 (46.2)8 (61.5)10 (76.9)2 (15.4)6 (46.2)5 (38.5)1 (7.7) Q29: Medication error (n = 57)19 (33.3)33 (57.9)29 (50.9)22 (38.6)23 (40.4)25 (43.9)3 (5.3) Q37: Retained surgical item (n = 29)4 (13.8)16 (55.2)18 (62.1)10 (34.5)11 (37.9)15 (51.7)2 (6.9)Corrective action(a) Financial/legal(b) Disciplinary(c) Education-based (including peer mentoring, etc)(d) No corrective action was taken(e) Other Q12: Wrong site/patient/procedure (n = 34)2 (5.9)2 (5.9)21 (61.8)6 (17.7)8 (23.5) Q23: OR fire (n = 13)5 (38.5)2 (15.4)11 (84.6)4 (30.8)2 (15.4) Q30: Medication error (n = 57)2 (3.5)3 (5.3)32 (56.1)19 (33.3)11 (19.3) Q38: Retained surgical item (n = 29)3 (10.3)1 (3.5)19 (65.5)8 (27.6)6 (20.7)Institutional investigation conducted to respond to event(a) Event occurred but no institutional investigation conducted(b) Yes, morbidity and mortality conference(c) Yes, Root cause analysis and actions (RCA2)(d) Yes, institutional investigation other than RCA2(e) Yes, peer review(f) Unknown(g) Other Q13: Wrong site/patient/procedure (n = 34)6 (17.6)14 (41.2)19 (55.9)8 (23.5)8 (23.6)2 (5.9)1 (2.9) Q24: OR fire (n = 13)3 (23.1)3 (23.1)8 (61.5)5 (38.5)3 (23.1)3 (23.1)0 (0) Q31: Medication error (n = 57)21 (36.8)15 (26.3)23 (40.4)3 (5.26)10 (17.5)9 (15.8)1 (1.8) Q39: Retained surgical item (n = 29)6 (20.7)13 (44.8)13 (44.8)4 (13.8)4 (13.8)3 (10.3)3 (10.3)\n\nRespondents felt that the interventions that have been most impactful to prevent serious patient safety events ( ) were time-outs before case (79.9%), site marking (65.4%), and safety checklists to ensure preventive components (49.6%).\n\nTable 6.\n\nn%Q41: System at institution to track sentinel events (n = 518) Voluntary reporting33464.5 Structured chart review (eg, NSQIP, ACS CSV, etc)27452.9 Automated capture through HER11522.2 Automated capture not build into HER275.2 Unknown12023.2 Other152.9Q42: System at institution to respond to sentinel events (n = 518) Morbidity and mortality conference29957.7 Root cause analysis and actions (RCA2)33765.1 Institutional investigation other than RCA216231.3 Peer review29957.7 None132.5 Other244.6Q43: Most impactful interventions to prevent serious adverse events in otolaryngology (n = 518) Time-outs before case41479.9 Debriefs after case15229.3 Safety checklists to ensure preventive components25749.6 Site marking33965.4 Team huddles16131.1 None305.8 Other479.1\n\nAssociated Factors\n\nWe used logistic regression to evaluate the demographic factors gender, age, years in practice, practice type, specialty area, and use of checklists associated with reporting any patient safety event ( ). In our final multivariable model, we found that reporting any patient safety event was associated with provider age <40 years (odds ratio [OR] 1.80, confidence interval [CI] 1.01-3.20) and practice specialty of head and neck oncology (OR 2.75, CI 1.50-5.05) or pediatric otolaryngology (OR 2.42, CI 1.33-4.39) as compared with general otolaryngology (reference). The use of a comprehensive checklist preoperatively was not associated with reporting a patient safety event.\n\nTable 7.\n\nUnivariate logistic regressionMultivariate logistic regressionORCIORCIGender Male1.00(Reference) Female1.150.72-1.83Age, y <401.710.98-2.97 1.80 1.01-3.20 40-501.00(Reference)Reference >500.650.40-1.050.730.45-1.20Years in practice <101.761.03-3.02 10-201.00(Reference) >200.690.41-1.15Practice type Academic1.580.85-2.94 Military1.440.39-5.38 Multispecialty group0.770.36-1.64 Otolaryngology group0.570.29-1.10 Solo1.0(reference)Practice specialty Area General otolaryngology (reference)1.0(reference)1.0(reference) Facial plastic and reconstructive surgery1.970.85-4.581.820.77-4.27 Head and neck oncology3.131.73-5.68 2.74 1.50-5.05 Laryngology0.820.23-2.930.630.17-2.29 Otology/neurotology1.360.61-3.051.380.61-3.13 Pediatric otolaryngology2.571.43-4.62 2.42 1.33-4.39 Rhinology/skull base/allergy2.320.98-5.502.190.87-5.04Use of checklists Noncomprehensive1.0(Reference) Comprehensive0.830.56-1.23\n\nQualitative Content Analysis\n\nWe categorized the root cause of the reported sentinel events into 10 categories based on The Joint Commission definitions. Qualitative analysis revealed 4 categories of root causes that accounted for more than 65% of reported sentinel events: communication (24.9%), medication use (20.3%), human factors (ex: staff supervision issues; 13.2%), and care planning (9.1%). Communication errors represented a hub in root cause analyses, sharing relationships with most other root causes identified ( ). Communication error was more common during wrong-site surgical events (48.1%), whereas absence of policies and procedures was more common in retained surgical items (39.0%; ).

Everyone in room needs to be empowered to help keep the case safe.”“I find that the continued addition of extraneous environmental allergies have diluted the value of the time-out as one can see team members’ eyes glaze over as impertinent details continue to get added to the lists of required items.”“Fostering a culture where any and all team members can raise concerns or questions without fear or intimidation.”“Our checklists have become so lengthy and arduous and mostly not relevant to our cases that I feel they do more harm than good by directing attention and discussed away from pertinent things”\n\nDiscussion\n\nOur study highlights patterns of system failure that allow sentinel intraoperative events to persist in otolaryngology. Some of the data confirm what we already knew or suspected: that sentinel events take a variety of forms, that safety checklists are not uniformly embraced by surgeons, and that significant variations in practice exist. Other findings are new and alarming. For example, in more than half of the instances of operating room fires, no fire-related time-out had been conducted. Also, sentinel events were more likely to prompt full root cause analysis and actions than to be discussed at a departmental morbidity and mortality conference. Our study provides a framework for cataloguing the types of errors experienced by otolaryngologists in the modern operating room. Furthermore, root cause analysis and actions of events suggest opportunities for improvement in communication, medication use, care planning, and policies and procedures to prevent future events.\n\nInvestigating intraoperative sentinel events is challenging because of their rarity; the estimated incidence of wrong-site surgery is 1 per 100,000 procedures, and the incidence of retained surgical items is 1 per 8000 to 10,000 procedures.9,10 Understanding such events is critical for developing strategies that may prevent future harm to patients. Patient safety events tend to arise from remediable systems failures, and because sentinel events attract notice, they may represent the proverbial visible tip of a much larger iceberg of preventable patient safety events. Previous studies estimated that 9.6% to 10.8% of all errors in otolaryngology may have been prevented with closer adherence to an element on a checklist.11,12\n\nWrong-Site Surgery\n\nIn a previous survey in otolaryngology focusing on endoscopic sinus surgery, 9.3% of respondents described a case of wrong-site surgery13; however, the relevance of this finding to other areas of otolaryngology practice was unclear. In the present study, wrong-site sinus surgery represented only a small portion of reported events. Overall, 82% of wrong-site or wrong-side surgery involved wrong laterality or wrong anatomic region, most commonly related to wrong-ear surgery, wrong-cutaneous-lesion surgery, error in upper versus lower lip frenulectomy, wrong-sinus surgery, and wrong-site thyroid surgery. Wrong-procedure events were also reported, particularly in adenotonsillectomy.\n\nSurgical Fires\n\nOverall, 85% of surgical fires occur during head, neck, or upper chest procedures,14 and previous surveys have identified that 25% of otolaryngologists experience at least 1 surgical fire in their career.15 The pattern of surgical fires was classified by types of surgery, ignition source, and fuel source, and results mirrored findings of a previous survey of otolaryngologists a decade prior,15 suggesting the need for further progress in this area, despite broader adoption of polytetrafluoroethylene-coated Bovie tips that decrease maximal heat and eschar buildup as compared with stainless-steel tips. Of note, previous surveys did not explore the use of surgical fire time-outs. We observed that in 72.3% of surgical fires, a fire time-out was not performed (55.6%) or it was unknown whether or not fire time-out was performed (16.3%). Flash fires during removal of cutaneous lesions were frequently noted, and such episodes are possibly associated with flammable skin disinfection liquids as well as entrained oxygen from surgical draping. Such incidences could be avoided by discouraging the use of alcohol-containing disinfectants during surgeries at high risk for fire, allowing alcohol-based solutions to dry completely before draping, and avoiding administration of open oxygen beneath barrier draping.\n\nWrong Medication\n\nPrevious survey studies identified that 12.7% of otolaryngologists were aware of an error with concentrated epinephrine in the previous year.16 In our survey, wrong medication events were the most frequently reported patient safety event by respondents, and among these, errors involving the delivery of concentrated epinephrine were emphasized. Based on participants’ descriptions of events, preventive measures might include adding color or dye to specific medications; applying of particular medications on pledgets only; maintaining consistency of surgical team members; paying attention to timing of breaks during cases, particularly during shorter cases involving injectable medication; and having heightened awareness of the risk of handoff errors associated with staff discontinuity.\n\nRetained Surgical Item\n\nLimited prior research has focused on retained surgical items (commonly known as “unidentified retained foreign object” or URFO) in otolaryngology.12,17 Frequent causes of retained surgical items include so-called uncountable objects such as throat packs and nasal splints. These items are frequently not included in the surgical count, and these survey data illustrate a potential opportunity to improve tracking of currently uncounted items.\n\nRoot Causes of Sentinel Events\n\nTo identify the root cause of the sentinel events, we analyzed free-text descriptions for each event based on accepted Joint Commission categories. A few themes emerged relating to latent risks. Surgical cases that deviate from a common pattern, such as planning a pediatric tonsillectomy scheduled without adenoidectomy, are susceptible to error; uncounted items, such as throat packs, may be overlooked; paired structures, such as ears, sinuses, or tonsils, are inherently susceptible to confusion; and communication is an omnipresent challenge. Defects in procedures for communication, medication use, human factors, and care planning accounted for 65% of intraoperative sentinel events, highlighting the importance of intraoperative teamwork and challenges inherent in universal checklist implementation. Last, a significant number of fire-related events occurred in cases where a fire safety checklist had not been performed.\n\nIn contrast with our results that did not identify leadership as a frequent root cause, The Joint Commission’s identified leadership (eg, organizational planning) as one of the most common root causes of sentinel events.8 Qualitative free-text description of the events did not lend itself to understanding limitations in organizational structure and leadership making determining leadership failures. Furthermore, the structure of the survey may not have triggered respondents to describe issues related to institutional leadership.\n\nReporting and Investigation of Intraoperative Sentinel Events\n\nReporting and follow-up on sentinel events are necessary aspects of effecting changes that prevent harm. Although all institutions are required to have mechanisms for reporting sentinel events, it was notable that 26.1% of respondents did not know of institutional systems in place to track such events. This finding calls out the need for otolaryngologists to become more involved with and informed of their institutional systems to capture and respond to sentinel events. The relatively low rate of presentation at morbidity and mortality conferences of medication errors (26.3%) and OR fires (23.1%) versus for wrong site/patient procedure (41.2%) or retained surgical item (44.8%) may reflect the lack of access to morbidity and mortality conference across all care settings (private versus academic practice). There may be opportunities for increased presentation of such events to promote quality improvement in the context of morbidity and mortality conference.18\n\nIn addition, only 15% to 24% of wrong-site surgical, wrong medication, and retained surgical item events were reported to result in at least temporary harm. However, this may represent and underrepresentation of the true harms experienced by patients. A review found that in some cases, the harm never reached the patient (eg, an operating room fire that did not reach the patient). However, in other cases, respondents reported events such as wrong-site surgery that reached the patient as resulting in no harm because the patient did well. Physicians underestimate the severity that patients experience from patient safety events,19 and our results should be viewed with this in mind.\n\nPerspectives About Checklists\n\nDespite their purported benefits, checklists have provoked a backlash by those clinicians who cite concerns of inefficiency about administrative burden. Although most reported that checklists helped reduce serious patient safety events, several survey respondents commented on these frustrations. Lack of engagement with checklists not only undermines the effectiveness of the intervention but may also give the team a false sense of security.20 These issues emphasize the need to develop and maintain meaningful time-outs that facilitate effective communication and focus attention on specific procedural risks. Improperly implemented checklists may promote “box-ticking” without improving communication or creating a culture of safety. For example, the National Health Service in England mandated checklist use without support for implementation and reported high documentation with little clinically meaningful implementation.21 Checklists are simply a tool to foster team communication but require buy-in from all stakeholders.22\n\nSuccessful Checklist Implementation\n\nSuccessful surgical safety checklist implementation requires implementation leaders to persuasively justify the need and to show how to use the checklist.23 Furthermore, successful implementation requires adaptation to existing institutional frameworks and continuous feedback and improvement.24\n\nLimitations\n\nThis study has several limitations and sources of bias, most of which are inherent in all self-reported surveys. The study methodology relied on respondent recollection of previous events, predisposing to recall bias and willingness to report details around patient safety events. A natural reporting bias occurs in self-selection, as those who have experienced a major patient safety event may be more likely to respond to the survey. The actual incidence of intraoperative sentinel events may be higher or lower than that which is reflected in survey responses, although the overall survey response rate of 4.9% compares favorably with previous response rates to AAO-HNS surveys12,13,16,25,26 Furthermore, the respondents included strong representation of different practice types and specialty areas; however, the demographics of respondents are not representative of overall AAO-HNS membership, most notably evident in a preponderance of women respondents (78%).\n\nBecause of these methodological limitations, we cannot determine whether checklists have changed the incidence of sentinel intraoperative events. Another limitation is the data capture. Although several categories of events were queried, the survey instrument allowed respondents to report only 1 event per category; furthermore, the thematic focus on checklists likely meant that some categories of harmful events highly relevant to otolaryngology, such as cranial nerve injury, were unlikely to be captured by this survey. Nonetheless, these data provide examples of areas in which checklists may be beneficial in reducing operative harm events and areas in which additional efforts are likely necessary to positively affect patient outcomes. Future studies should seek to prospectively investigate the incidence of sentinel intraoperative events in otolaryngology and to better understand the root causes and impactful solutions.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nJohn D.
