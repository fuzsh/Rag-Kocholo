Not valid with other discounts.\n\nPLAYHOUSE PERSPECTIVES: THE CURRENT STATE OF THE FACT\n\nNov. 4 at 7 p.m. at the Playhouse\n\n“I’m not interested in accuracy. I’m interested in truth,” states John D'Agata in The Lifespan of a Fact. How do media writers — whether they’re a journalist, essayist or critic — interpret the word “fact,” especially in a time when facts and opinions are often considered interchangeable? Join Cincinnati Magazine Editor-in-Chief John Fox and a panel of media experts as they dissect and discuss the definition of “fact” through their own professional lens. This event is free, but registration is required.\n\nPlayhouse Perspectives is made possible thanks to a generous gift from Barbara and Roderick Barr.\n\nAudio-Described Performance\n\nEach Marx Theatre production offers one audio-described performance during the show's run. Trained volunteers describe the visual elements of the production via a closed-circuit receiver that is approximately the size of a deck of cards and fits in a jacket pocket or on the lap. A small earpiece fits into one ear, allowing patrons to hear dialogue, music and other sound effects. The description is timed to avoid interfering with dialogue.\n\nSigned Performance\n\nEach Marx Theatre production offers one signed performance during the show's run. The interpreter stands toward the bottom of aisle 5. Look at our Accessibility page for a map of best viewing locations. This performance also includes a Meet the Artists discussion with the cast and crew after the show. Funding for this program is made possible by Bartlett & Co."
