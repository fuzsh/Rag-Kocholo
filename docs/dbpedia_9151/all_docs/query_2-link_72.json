        "text": "In his first performance in the Historic Triangle since 2007, Bruce Hornsby and his band will help celebrate his hometown radio station.\n\nAfter 10 years of airing music on 92.3FM on the Peninsula, The Tide is throwing an anniversary concert May 21 at Lake Matoaka Amphitheater as a thank you to the Greater Williamsburg community for its support over the years with Bruce Hornsby and the Noisemakers as the headliner and Richmond-based James Justin & Co. as the opening act.\n\nBruce Hornsby and the Noisemakers played in the City of Williamsburg in 2005 to celebrate The Tide’s launch and returned to the area in 2007 as part of Jamestown’s 400th anniversary.\n\n“It’s always great fun playing in Williamsburg,” Hornsby said. “I feel like I know one-fourth of the audience personally when I play at home.”\n\nHornsby and his band are planning the concert to be much like any other show on their tour, employing a “very loose, very improvisational” approach as they draw from Hornsby’s 29-year history of performing on a national stage.\n\nHornsby, who is one of the investors in The Tide’s parent company Local Voice, said he is proud not only to play in front of his hometown but also to celebrate a radio station that has offered a different sound on the local airwaves.\n\n“The Tide is totally worth celebrating for me because they’re playing music you don’t hear on the popular formats,” Hornsby said.\n\nThe Tide is part of the Triple-A format, or Adult Album Alternative, which boasts a wide range of music for adults and a larger music database to avoid the repetition often heard in the more popular formats.\n\n[stextbox id=”news-sidebar” float=”true” width=”250″ bwidth=”0″ bgcolor=”E3E3E3″ bgcolorto=”E3E3E3″]\n\nWant to Go?\n\nWhen: 7 p.m. Thursday, May 21\n\nWhere: Lake Matoaka Amphitheater, 121 Ukrop Way, Williamsburg\n\nCost: $35 for general admission lawn tickets; $50 for reserved seating; free general admission for children 10 and under\n\nTickets: Presale begins 10 a.m. Wednesday, March 4. The general sale begins 10 a.m. Friday, March 6. Click here to buy tickets.\n\n[/stextbox]\n\nTom Davis, president and CEO of Local Voice, came to Williamsburg more than 10 years ago with the goal of launching both Triple-A and classical music stations — now 92.3FM The Tide and 107.9 BachFM.\n\n“In so many communities all over the country, there are large groups of educated, sophisticated people who have far broader tastes than the same 300 songs you hear on the radio over and over,” he said. “This is one of those communities, and we were welcomed with open arms from the first day we went on the air.”\n\nThe Bruce Hornsby and the Noisemakers concert has been organized to thank the community for its support as the company grew from two radio stations in Williamsburg into a company that owns both radio stations and digital newspapers, including Williamsburg Yorktown Daily, in three other markets.\n\nConcertgoers are encouraged to mix and mingle before the show. Lake Matoaka Amphitheater will open 5 p.m. the day of the concert to allow ticketholders plenty of time to enjoy a bite to eat from one of the local food and alcohol vendors, which have not yet been determined, before the show begins.\n\n“No matter how small the world gets, it will always be about family and community — people who support each other. It just doesn’t get any more important than that,” Davis said."
