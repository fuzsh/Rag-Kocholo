        "text": "Bruce Hornsby & The Noisemakers will perform in Pennsylvania this summer.\n\nThey will appear at 7 p.m. Tuesday, July 2, 2024, at Musikfest Café in Bethlehem, according to ArtsQuest, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of “Spirit Trail.”\n\nTicket presale will start at 10 a.m. on Wednesday, March 6. Tickets for the general public will be available starting at 10 a.m. on Friday, March 8. Ticket prices range from $59 to $85.\n\n“Bruce Hornsby has built one of the most diverse, collaborative and adventurous careers in contemporary music. Based out of Williamsburg, [Virginia], Hornsby first rose to national prominence with ‘The Way It Is,’ his 1986 Grammy Award-winning debut album with The Range. The title track became the most played song on American radio in 1987. In 1991 Hornsby collaborated with Bonnie Raitt, playing on her iconic hit ‘I Can’t Make You Love Me.’\n\n“Hornsby was a part-time member of the Grateful Dead from September 1990 to March 1992, performing over 100 concerts in America and Europe. The 13-time Grammy nominee has also solidified his status as a highly sought-after collaborator.\n\n“Hornsby’s own 23 albums have sold over 11 million copies worldwide, and he has appeared on over 100 records including releases with Bob Dylan, Don Henley, the Grateful Dead, Stevie Nicks, Ricky Skaggs, Bob Seger, Chaka Khan, Bon Iver, Brandon Flowers, Bonnie Raitt, Sting, Mavis Staples, Willie Nelson and more. His most recent studio album, ‘‘Flicted,’ was released in May 2022.”"
