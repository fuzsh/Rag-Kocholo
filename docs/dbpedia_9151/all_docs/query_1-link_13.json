        "text": "About Bruce Hornsby\n\nBased out of Williamsburg, Virginia, Bruce Hornsby first rose to national prominence with The Way It Is, his 1986 Grammy-winning debut album with The Range. The title track became the most-played song on American radio in 1987, while Tupac Shakur’s timeless song Changes builds on The Way It Is and set the stage for many subsequent versions of the track. In 1991, Hornsby collaborated with Bonnie Raitt, playing on her iconic hit I Can’t Make You Love Me. Additionally, Hornsby was a part-time member of the Grateful Dead from 1990 to 1992, performing over 100 concerts in America and Europe. The 13-time Grammy nominee has also solidified his status as a highly sought-after collaborator. Hornsby’s own 23 albums have sold over 11 million copies worldwide, and he has appeared on over 100 records, including releases with Bob Dylan, Don Henley, Grateful Dead, Stevie Nicks, Ricky Skaggs, Bob Seger, Chaka Khan, Bon Iver, Brandon Flowers, Bonnie Raitt, Sting, Mavis Staples, Willie Nelson, and more. His most recent studio album, ‘Flicted, was released in 2022.\n\nAbout Heavy MakeUp\n\nOn stage and on their new sophomore release, Here It Comes, Heavy MakeUp—Edie Brickell, CJ Camerieri (trumpet player for yMusic, CARM) and Trever Hagen (producer, electronic musician and fellow trumpeter)—improvise complete songs, spinning elements of pop, folk, electronic, rock, jazz, chamber music and the avant-garde into two- and three-minute gems that are at once radio-worthy and experimental."
