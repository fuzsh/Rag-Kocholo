        "text": "News on Autolux, The Darkness, Bruce Hornsby\n\nRock trio Autolux has been chosen as the opening act for Nine Inch Nails and Queens Of The Stone Age’s fall North American tour. As previously reported, the outing will begin Sept. 16 in San Diego and has dates on tap through Nov. 3 in New York.\n\nAutolux will be out behind its acclaimed 2004 DMZ/Red Ink debut, “Future Perfect,” which debuted at No. 16 on Billboard’s Top Electronic Albums chart. The group has since transitioned to Epic, which will release its next studio album.\n\nHaving just completed a North American tour with the Raveonettes, Autolux will be off the road until a July 29 set at San Diego’s Street Scene Festival. Also on tap is an Aug. 17 opening slot with the White Stripes in Los Angeles and an Aug. 20 show with Shellac in Echo Park, Calif.\n\n— Jonathan Cohen, N.Y.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nBritish rock act the Darkness has named Richie Edwards as its full-time bass player. For the past two years, Edwards has toured extensively with the band as its guitar technician. The former Onion Trump member has also assisted the Darkness with its equipment in the studio throughout the recording of its as-yet-untitled new album.\n\nDue in the fall, the set is the follow-up to follow-up to the Darkness’ multi-platinum debut “Permission To Land” (Must Destroy/Atlantic), which has sold 675,000 units in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan.\n\nThe band had auditioned a number of potential bassists since the March departure of Frankie Poullain.\n\n— Lars Brandle, London\n\nBruce Hornsby is breaking into broadcasting as an investor in the purchase of WWBR in his hometown, Williamsburg, Va. Leading the charge is Tom Davis, an 18-year veteran of the radio industry, who is president of the station, which will program in the adult-oriented triple-A format. “Clearly, Williamsburg could use a hometown local station,” he told the Virginia Gazette. “The Hornsbys were very excited to support their hometown.”\n\nThe artist is excited triple-A is coming to the market, because he says he gets no airplay at home. “I can say with certainty, that the one format I do really well in around the country is triple-A,” Hornsby told the Gazette. “There’s no other station format where you can hear that, so ole Bruce Hornsby gets zero airplay in his home area.”\n\n— Chuck Taylor, Billboard Radio Monitor\n\nGet weekly rundowns straight to your inbox\n\nSign Up"
