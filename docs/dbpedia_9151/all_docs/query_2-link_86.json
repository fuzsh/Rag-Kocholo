        "text": "Danielle Haim and Bruce Hornsby release new ‘Days Ahead’ video\n\nVirginia singer-songwriter Bruce Hornsby has welcomed the helping hand of Danielle Haim on his new track ‘Days Ahead’.\n\nThe new video was filmed and directed by Hornsby during the Covid-19 pandemic. It follows three dimensional printed characters who can be seen re-arranging furniture around their dollhouse while attempting to learn a new language and thinking about what to do next in their lives.\n\nThe new track previews Hornsby’s new album, Flicted, which was released earlier this week. Just before ‘Days Ahead’ was released, the album was also previewed by its lead single ‘Sidelines’, which featured Ezra Koenig from Vampire Weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, earlier this week, Drake shared a photo on his Instagram from his first time meeting the LA sister act Haim.\n\n“Just met the Beatles,” Drake’s caption read, alongside the black and white photo which shows the rap artist with Este, Danielle and Alana Haim. Haim also shared the photo on their Instagram account, jokingly writing: “We’re the Beatles” in their caption.\n\nHaim are currently on their 2022 North American tour in support of their latest album Women In Music Pt. III. Last week, they were visiting Drake’s hometown of Toronto, Ontario, to perform at RBC Echo Beach.\n\nElsewhere, Haim are due to head back to the UK this summer to perform at Glastonbury 2022 before embarking on their One More Haim tour in July. The tour was delayed multiple times due to the Covid-19 pressures over the past two years. All remaining tickets for those dates are available here.\n\nHaim’s 2022 UK/Ireland tour dates are as follows:\n\nJune 2022\n\nJuly 2022\n\nWatch Danielle Haim and Bruce Hornsby’s new video for ‘Days Ahead’ below."
