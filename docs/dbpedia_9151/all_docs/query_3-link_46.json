        "text": "Rarely have I offered three transcriptions in one month with such superior piano artistry as this month.\n\nBrand-new this month is a note-for-note transcription of Billy Preston's electric piano part in The Beatles' \"Get Back\" - the entire recording, not just his legendary solo.\n\nMy own favorite this month is Bruce Hornsby's extraordinary piano track on one of the most heart-wrenching unrequited-love songs ever, Bonnie Raitt's \"I Can't Make You Love Me\".\n\nAlso new is a transcription of Bill Payne's terrific piano part in Bob Seger's \"Shame on the Moon\" (some may remember it as \"Blame it on Midnight\").\n\nALL of the Sheet Music listed on my website has been personally transcribed by me, and guaranteed to be note-for-note perfect.\n\nWhether you:\n\nhave a cover band and want to get your keyboard parts exactly correct,\n\nare a professional who wants to study the styles of rock's greatest keyboard players, or\n\nare a hobbyist that wants to learn how to play pop/rock and great piano music,\n\n...these note-for-note transcriptions will prove extremely helpful.\n\nAnd as always, if you ever need any help, just drop me a note at: elmo@manymidi.com\n\nIn 1991 Bonnie Raitt released \"I Can't Make You Love Me\", the biggest hit of her career. Contributing to the song's success were its lyrics and her heart-felt vocal, but also a major factor was the outstanding piano part by Bruce Hornsby.\n\nIf you haven't heard it, click here and be prepared to be deeply moved by its emotional intensity.\n\nHornsby was born in 1954 in Williamsburg, Virginia, son of Robert Stanley Hornsby, an attorney, real-estate developer and former musician, and his wife, Lois Saunier, a piano player. He graduated from James Blair High School in Williamsburg in 1973, where he played on the basketball team and was chosen by his senior class as most likely to succeed.\n\nIn the spring of 1974, Hornsby's older brother Bobby formed the band \"Bobby Hi-Test and the Octane Kids\" to play fraternity parties, featuring Bruce on Fender Rhodes and vocals. The band performed covers of the Allman Brothers Band, The Band, and predominantly Grateful Dead songs.\n\nHe studied music at the University of Richmond for a year, Berklee College of Music for two semesters, and the University of Miami, from which he graduated in 1977. Following his graduation from the University of Miami, Hornsby returned to his hometown of Williamsburg, and played in local clubs and hotel bars.\n\nIn 1980, he moved to Los Angeles, spending three years writing for 20th Century Fox, and working as a session musician before moving back to his native Hampton Roads. During this time Hornsby joined the band Ambrosia for their last album. After Ambrosia disbanded, he performed as a member of Sheena Easton's touring band.\n\nIn 1984, Hornsby formed Bruce Hornsby and the Range, who were signed to RCA Records in 1985. \"The Way It Is\", his biggest hit, reached #1 on Billboard in 1986, and the following year he won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist.\n\nIn 1988, Hornsby first appeared on stage with the Grateful Dead, and was frequently a guest before becoming a regular fixture in the touring lineup a few years later. From 1988 until Jerry Garcia's death in 1995, Hornsby played more than 100 shows with the Grateful Dead.\n\nDuring the late 1980s and early 1990s, Hornsby worked extensively as a producer and sideman. In 1989, he co-wrote and played piano on Don Henley's hit \"The End of the Innocence\". In 1991, he played piano on Bonnie Raitt's hit \"I Can't Make You Love Me\". He also appeared on albums by Bob Dylan, Robbie Robertson, Crosby Stills and Nash, and Stevie Nicks.\n\nAnd last, but not least, Hornsby owns three 9' Model D Steinway Grands. :)\n\nMy new Bonnie Raitt transcription:\n\nBonnie Raitt - \"I Can't Make You Love Me\" - Bruce Hornsby, piano - NEW!\n\nHe also appeared in St. Louis Blues, a 1958 movie about W. C. Handy starring Nat 'King' Cole, Eartha Kitt and Cab Calloway; Preston played Handy at a younger age.\n\nIn 1962, Preston joined Little Richard's band as an organist, and it was while performing in Hamburg that he met the Beatles. In 1963, he played the organ on Sam Cooke's album and released his own debut album, , for Cooke's SAR label. In 1965, he released the album (which includes \"Slippin' and Slidin'\") and performed on the rock and roll show In 1967, he joined Ray Charles' band.\n\nFollowing this exposure, several musicians began asking Preston to contribute to their sessions, including the Beatles, seven years after meeting him while playing with Little Richard.\n\nHe played on several of their songs, including \"Get Back\", \"Don't Let Me Down\", \"Something\", \"Let It Be\" (the organ part), and \"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\".\n\nDuring the \"Get Back\" sessions Lennon suggested that Preston join the Beatles, even using the term \"Fifth Beatle\", but the idea was dismissed by the others. Billy Preston was the only artist to receive joint credit on a Beatles single. Preston also accompanied the band on electric piano for its rooftop concert, the group's final public appearance.\n\nMy Beatles transcriptions:\n\nThe Beatles - \"Get Back\" - Billy Preston, electric piano - NEW!\n\nThe Beatles - \"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\" - John Lennon, piano\n\nThe Beatles - \"Don't Let Me Down\" - Billy Preston, piano\n\nThe Beatles - \"Hey Bulldog\" - John Lennon, piano\n\nThe Beatles - \"Lady Madonna\" - Paul McCartney, piano\n\nThe Beatles - \"Let It Be\" - Paul McCartney, piano\n\nThe Beatles - \"Lovely Rita\" - George Martin, piano\n\nHere are my other Billy Preston transcriptions:\n\nPlus, here are my Billy Preston-related exercises:\n\nBob Seger was born in Detroit, Michigan, the son of Charlotte and Stewart Seger.\n\nSeger's father, a medical technician for the Ford Motor Company, played several instruments and Seger was exposed to music from an early age.\n\nRegarding his early musical inspirations, Seger has stated, \"Little Richard â€“ he was the first one that really got to me. Little Richard and, of course, Elvis Presley.\" \"Come Go with Me\" by The Del-Vikings, a hit in 1957, was the first record he bought.\n\nSince then he has released 18 studio albums.\n\nHis tenth studio album, Stranger in Town, released in 1978, contained \"Old Time Rock and Roll\", which was recorded in Muscle Shoals, with Randy McCormick on piano.\n\nHis eleventh studio album, Against the Wind, released in 1980, contained \"Against the Wind\", with Paul Harris on piano.\n\nHis twelfth studio album, The Distance, released in 1982, contained \"Roll Me Away\", with Roy Bittan on piano, and \"Shame on the Moon\", with Bill Payne (of Little Feat) playing an outstanding piano track.\n\nSeger performed his very last concert on November 1, 2019 in Philadelphia, PA, capping a 56-year concert career.\n\nMy Bob Seger transcriptions and arrangements:\n\nBob Seger - \"Against the Wind\" - Paul Harris, piano\n\nBob Seger - \"Roll Me Away\" - Roy Bittan, piano\n\nMy other Bill Payne transcriptions:\n\nMy other Roy Bittan transcriptions:\n\nThis month I'm pleased to offer three new transcriptions, each with a truly outstanding piano part.\n\nMy own favorite is Bonnie Raitt's \"I Can't Make You Love Me\" - a recording of extraordinary emotional intensity, beautifully played by Bruce Hornsby at his best.\n\nThe recording, which is Bonnie Raitt's biggest hit of her entire career, doesn't contain a guitar. It consists of drums, bass, and three keyboards: acoustic piano, electric piano, and B-3 organ.\n\nBoth pianos were played by Bruce Hornsby and the organ by Benmont Tench. I transcribed both pianos note-for-note from the long (5:33) album version and then merged them together into one arrangement.\n\nAnd the most legendary rock band in history is of course The Beatles. And one of their most famous hits is \"Get Back\", with its distinctive electric piano part - and solo - by Billy Preston, whom John Lennon called The Fifth Beatle. Preston was a true genius of the keyboard; this is one of his best and most famous tracks.\n\nPlus, Bob Seger used some of the very best session players on his hits, including Bill Payne, ace session player and leader of his own band, Little Feat. If you don't remember \"Shame on the Moon\", click on the link below to hear it. You'll almost certainly remember it, and its classic piano part that Payne played. Like Raitt's \"I Can't Make You Love Me\", this is also a long song - almost five minutes. And I was able to transcribe every note in the fade-out, all the way to the very end.\n\nSo this month there are three outstanding recordings. Each is an outstanding track, and each has its own remarkable solo.\n\nMy new exercise this month takes arpeggios up a notch. It not only addresses all three inversions of a triad, but it also 'harmonizes' the notes. That is, the hands are not playing arpeggios that are an octave apart. They are played in harmony.\n\nFor instance, if the left hand starts on the tonic - a C in the key of C - the right hand starts the arpeggio a 5th higher - a G in the key of C. So the hands are both playing an arpeggio, but one hand is playing a higher harmony.This is a little more difficult than playing an octave apart, but the benefit to one's 'chops' is greater.\n\nThis is not the easiest exercise but it will strengthen your hands and help you to master runs that are more challenging than scales, while improving your Left/Right coordination at the same time.\n\nThis exercise is available as both a sheet-music PDF and as a MIDI file.\n\nBTW, if you need other good, effective technical exercises, please check out the other 93 exercises available.)\n\nI've had the good fortune to have taught some of the biggest names in the entertainment industry, and if you're serious about learning, I'll be happy to help you, too.\n\nBy means of Skype lessons (or in-person if you're in L.A.), I can coach you and help you to improve your technique, your rhythm, your ability to improvise, your knowledge of music theory, your sight-reading, and to develop relative pitch.\n\nI've had the good fortune to have toured the world playing keyboards and arranging/conducting for these Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Artists:"
