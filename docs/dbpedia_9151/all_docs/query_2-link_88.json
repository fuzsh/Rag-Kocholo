        "text": "Sara Latimer is an 20 year old singer-songwriter from the Washington DC area who currently attends the University of Miami where she is studying Music Business and Entertainment Industries and is a part of Bruce Hornsby's Creative American Music Program in the Frost School of Music. In June, she released her new EP, Passenger Seat, and here she answers her Essential 8 and talks about the project, her dream venue, her first concert (Corbin Bleu!), Shawn Mendes, and more!\n\nWith any particular song, was there an “a-ha” moment when you knew the song was completed and perfect?\n\nWhen I first wrote “Just Another Face” it was originally titled “T-Shirt,” and the chorus was completely different. I wasn’t in love with it so I went back to re-write it and finally formed the concept of, wishing that your ex could be just another face in the crowd. I knew once I got the chorus the rest of the song would just fall into place.\n\nWhere do you draw inspiration from when writing?\n\nIdeas usually spark from a real life experiences or just something someone says, than the light bulb moment kind of happens. I like to refer to a lot of my songs as an “exaggerated reality”. A lot of the main ideas come from real life but then the story surrounding it is molded to make a good song or more compelling story.\n\nWhat’s the best advice you have ever gotten from another musician?\n\nDon’t be afraid to be vulnerable. I have always been scared to write from personal experiences and reveal too much about myself in songs. But, this piece of advice has really pushed me to be more open, both when I am performing and writing.\n\nWhat’s your dream venue and why?\n\nMy first ever paying job in my hometown was working concessions at a venue in Virginia called Wolf Trap, which is this beautiful outdoor amphitheater. I have technically already performed there when I was a lot younger with my community choir, but getting to perform there as a solo country artists would be an amazing, full circle experience for me.\n\nWhat has been your biggest struggle so far?\n\nThe hardest thing for me is not comparing myself to other people’s work and successes. Being a music student at the University of Miami as well as being in Nashville, I am constantly surrounded by incredibly talented musicians, writers, and artists. I have to keep reminding myself that everybody their own unique journey and I need to focus on mine and be able to celebrate my own little victories.\n\nFavorite (or first) concert you have ever attended?\n\nGrowing up I was a total Disney Channel junkie so my first ever concert was Corbin Bleu opening for Aly & AJ. Basically every little girls dream right! I’m pretty sure my little sister and I attempted to recreate that concert for many months after that, pretending to be Aly & AJ for my parents.\n\nIs there a recent release you cannot stop listening to?\n\nRight now I’m really into the new Shawn Mendes album. I think he found a new sound that fits him really well and I love the direction he has taken.\n\nIs there a professional “bucket list” item you would love to check off?\n\nI think the most magical part of any show is when the crowd sings along word for word. One “bucket list” item for me would be to hear a huge crowd singing along to a song that I wrote, whether I am the artist or just a songwriter on the song.\n\n​Website: www.saralatimermusic.com\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/saralatimermusic/"
