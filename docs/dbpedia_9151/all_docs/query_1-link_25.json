        "text": "Bruce Hornsby has canceled or rescheduled several tour dates, including multiple shows in Upstate New York, due to vocal issues.\n\nThe Grammy Award-winning musician has canceled his appearances at the 4th of July celebration Thursday at Albany’s Empire State Plaza and a Saturday, July 6, concert at Point of the Bluff in Hammondsport. Bruce Hornsby & The Noisemakers also rescheduled a July 8 show at the Riviera Theatre in North Tonawanda for Oct. 7.\n\n“Due to a vocal issue affecting Bruce’s ability to sing and speak, we must unfortunately make a few changes to our June & July touring schedule. While we’re disappointed to have to cancel Albany and Hammondsport, we look forward to honoring the rest of the performances,” a statement said Monday.\n\nTicket for rescheduled shows will be honored on the new dates. Fans can reach out to the box office for information about refunds.\n\nA replacement has not been named for New York State’s 4th of July Celebration, which is still set to go on as scheduled Thursday. Hornsby was expected to headline the free event, performing at 8 p.m. before a fireworks show. Other entertainment includes a flyover by the 109AW New York Air Guard, great food and beverages, pony rides and a bounce house for kids.\n\nHornsby, 69, performs in a wide variety of genres, including rock, jazz, bluegrass, folk, and blues. He won a Grammy for Best New Artist in 1987 with The Range, plus Grammys for Best Bluegrass Album in 1990 and Best Pop Instrumental Performance in 1994. He’s collaborated with artists like The Grateful Dead and Ricky Skaggs, and had a No. 1 solo hit in 1986 with “The Way It Is” (famously sampled by 2Pac for the rap hit “Changes”).\n\nHornsby most recently released the solo album, “‘Flicted,” in 2022."
