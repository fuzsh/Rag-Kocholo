        "text": "Skaggs' first-ever solo album, Ricky Skaggs Solo: Songs My Dad Loved (2009), celebrates the man that caused him to fall in love with music - his father, Hobert Skaggs. He elaborates, \"If I could've gotten my dad into the studio, this is how I would've wanted him to sound.\" Playing every instrument and singing every note on the album, Ricky brought raw, emotional honesty to the songs. By coming home to the music that meant so much to him as a child, Ricky tapped into a wellspring of passion that is channeled into every tune, as though he willed himself back to his family's house in Kentucky. Solo was honored in the American roots field with a Grammy nomination for Best Traditional Folk Album in 2010.\n\nRicky Skaggs' album, Mosaic (2010), marked a return to a full band sound that mixed elements of Country music with Beatles-esque melody and lyrics that spoke to Skaggs' faith, making \"music that is in my head and in my heart,\" as Ricky said. Grammy winning songwriter/producer Gordon Kennedy, who co-wrote Eric Clapton's \"Change the World,\" was instrumental as co-producer and writer. This most special album hooks the heart, as the sounds invite you in to take notice and come closer. They have blended their talents and love of music with their love for the Lord to create a distinctive collaboration of writing and talent that is unparalleled in strength of genius. The song, \"Return to Sender\" from Mosaic was nominated for a Grammy for Best Gospel Song, and the album was a contender for Best Pop/Contemporary Gospel Album at the 53rd Grammy Awards, receiving major critical acclaim.\n\nMarking Ricky's 50th year in music was the release of Country Hits Bluegrass Style (2011), a compilation of many of Skaggs' #1 country hits and fan favorites, played in a bluegrass style. Combining his country and bluegrass roots along with Ricky's impeccable tenor voice, his eight time IBMA Instrumental Band of the Year, Kentucky Thunder, and some of Ricky's original award-winning country band alumni together with special friends added to the magic of this release.\n\nLong awaited by country and bluegrass music fans alike, Music To My Ears (2012) includes fresh new bluegrass tunes co-written by Skaggs along with a brand new instrumental. Many bluegrass standards are incorporated and add to its charm. The album features a duet with Ricky Skaggs and Barry Gibb (of Bee Gees fame) on deeply moving \"Soldier's Son,\" along with new bluegrass treasure \"You Can't Hurt Ham,\" inspired by a true story of Mr. Bill Monroe.\n\nIn 2013, music legends Ricky Skaggs and Bruce Hornsby came together again for a live album, titled Cluck Ol' Hen. Bluegrass treasures and lively expanded hits wait to be discovered on this fresh collection of songs from the masterful duo of Skaggs and Hornsby. These live songs were originally recorded when the two music icons first hit the tour circuit together. Hornsby's spirited piano brings a new dimension to these songs, with electrifying solos and improvisation thrown in the mix of Skaggs, Hornsby and Skaggs' band, Kentucky Thunder."
