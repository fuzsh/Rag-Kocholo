        "text": "About the Event\n\nBased out of Williamsburg, Virginia, Bruce Hornsby first rose to national prominence with The Way It Is, his 1986 Grammy®-winning debut album with The Range. The title track became the most-played song on American radio in 1987, while Tupac Shakur’s timeless song “Changes” built on “The Way It Is” and set the stage for many subsequent versions of the track. In 1991, Hornsby collaborated with Bonnie Raitt, playing on her iconic hit “I Can’t Make You Love Me.” Additionally, Hornsby was a part-time member of the Grateful Dead from September 1990 to March 1992, performing more than 100 concerts in the United States and Europe."
