        "text": "Soon, Hornsby was being approached regularly to collaborate with a broad range of musicians and writers, a demand that continues to this day. He has played on records for Bob Dylan, Robbie Robertson, Bonnie Raitt (piano on her iconic “I Can’t Make You Love Me”), Willie Nelson, Don Henley, Bob Seger, Squeeze, Stevie Nicks, Chaka Khan, Charlie Haden, Jack DeJohnette, Crosby, Stills and Nash, Bon Iver, Leon Russell, Chris Whitley, Warren Zevon, Bernie Taupin, Brandon Flowers (of the Killers), Cowboy Junkies, Shawn Colvin, Bela Fleck, Randy Scruggs, Hillary Scott, the Wild Magnolias, Clint Black, Sara Evans, Clannad, and many more. He has worked on his own records with Ornette Coleman, Jerry Garcia, Eric Clapton, Sting, Elton John, Mavis Staples, Phil Collins, Pat Metheny, Branford Marsalis, Wayne Shorter, Justin Vernon, and James Mercer (of The Shins), among others. Along with his early co-writer Jonathan Hornsby and latter-day partner Chip deMatteo, Bruce has co-written songs with Robert Hunter (the great Grateful Dead lyricist), Justin Vernon, Robbie Robertson, Don Henley, Leon Russell, Charlie Haden, Chaka Khan, and Jack DeJohnette. His songs have been recorded by another broad array of artists including Tupac Shakur (his iconic “Changes”), Akon, Bon Iver, Snoop Dogg, Chaka Khan, E-40, Don Henley, Leon Russell, Willie Nelson, Mase, Randy Scruggs, and Robbie Robertson.\n\nOver the years Hornsby has successfully ventured into bluegrass, jazz, classical, and even electronica, reflected on acclaimed releases like two projects with Ricky Skaggs: “Ricky Skaggs and Bruce Hornsby” (2007) and the live “Cluck Ol’ Hen” (2013), the jazz trio album “Camp Meeting” (2007) with Jack DeJohnette and Christian McBride, and “Solo Concerts” (2014), a stylistic merging of traditional American roots music and the dissonance and adventure of modern classical music. This latter-day interest led to an orchestral project spearheaded by Michael Tilson Thomas featuring this new music; the first performance occurred in January 2015 with Thomas’ New World Symphony, and the latest concert with more new material came in June 2018 at his Funhouse Fest with the Virginia Symphony Orchestra.\n\nHis three Grammy wins (along with his ten Grammy losses!) typify the diversity of his career: Best New Artist (1986) as leader of Bruce Hornsby and the Range, Best Bluegrass Recording (1989) for a version of his old Range hit “The Valley Road” that appeared on the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band’s “Will The Circle Be Unbroken Volume Two,” and a shared award with Branford Marsalis in 1993 for Best Pop Instrumental for “Barcelona Mona,” a song written and performed for the 1992 Olympic Games.\n\nThe sales stats and breadth of his collaborations (including being sampled many times by rap/hip-hop artists) speak volumes about Hornsby’s unique fusion of mainstream appeal and wild musical diversity. His albums have sold over 11 million copies worldwide. “Harbor Lights” (1993) won the Downbeat Reader’s Poll Album of the Year in 1994. Tupac Shakur co-wrote a new song over “The Way It Is” music called “Changes;” it was a major worldwide hit in 1998, selling 15 million copies. In 2006 his four CD set “Intersections” was selected as one of the best boxed sets of the year by the New York Times. His song “Levitate” was selected in 2011 by Sports Illustrated as one of the top 40 sports songs of all time. Bruce and his current band The Noisemakers’ latest record (a collection featuring Bruce on the Appalachian dulcimer) “Rehab Reunion” (2016) entered the Billboard album chart at 101, marking his tenth album appearance on the venerable chart over a 30-year period. In 2016 the annual Rolling Stone “Hot List” selected Bruce as “Hot Surprise Influence,” citing his influence and inspiration on such modern artists as Justin Vernon (Bon Iver) and Ryan Adams.\n\nThroughout the years Hornsby has participated in several memorable events: the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame opening concert in September 1995 (with the performance included on the concert album), Farm Aid IV and VI, the Telluride Bluegrass Festival (many times), the Newport Jazz Festival (2007), New Orleans Heritage and Jazz Festival (1997 and 2011), Woodstock II (1994), Woodstock III (1999, with the band’s performance included on the concert album), and the Bonnaroo Festival (2011). Hornsby, solo and with Branford Marsalis, has performed the National Anthem for many major events including the NBA All-Star game, four NBA Finals, the 1997 World Series Game 5, the night Cal Ripken broke Lou Gehrig’s all-time consecutive game streak, and the soundtrack to “Baseball: A Film by Ken Burns.” Most recently he was a special guest of Bon Iver for their set at the Coachella festival in April 2017, and sat in with Justin Vernon (Bon Iver) twice in December 2017 and once in Eau Claire, WI in 2018.\n\nBruce’s long involvement with the Grateful Dead began when the group asked him to open two shows in Monterey, CA in the spring of 1987. Bruce and the Range continued to open shows for the Dead in 1988, 1989 and 1990, and after the tragic death of Dead keyboardist Brent Mydland the band asked him to play with them. He started winging it with them with no rehearsal for five nights at Madison Square Garden in September 1990, and played more than 100 shows with them until March 1992. He continued to sit in with the band every year until Jerry Garcia passed away in 1995. He played in the first post-Dead band “The Other Ones” in 1998 (the album “The Strange Remain” chronicles that tour) and 2000. Bruce reunited with the band for the 50th Anniversary Fare Thee Well concerts in June and July 2015 at Levi’s Stadium (Santa Clara, CA) and Soldier Field (Chicago). He appears on seven Grateful Dead records including “Infrared Roses,” “So Many Roads,” and “View From The Vault II.”\n\nBruce has been part of many tribute records including two Grateful Dead collections, the original “Deadicated” (1991) and the recent massive compilation curated by the band The National entitled “Day of the Dead.” He recorded “Black Muddy River” with Justin Vernon of Bon Iver and Justin’s high school band DeYarmond Edison. Other tribute record appearances include “Two Rooms- A Tribute To The Songs of Elton John and Bernie Taupin,” a Keith Jarrett tribute, a tribute to The Band, a Fats Domino collection, Ricky Skaggs’ “Big Mon – the music of Bill Monroe,” and the Jackson Browne tribute record “Looking Into You.”\n\nA University of Miami alum, Hornsby has partnered with The Frost School of Music to establish the Creative American Music Program, a curriculum designed to develop the creative skills of talented young artist/songwriters by immersing them in diverse American folk, blues, and gospel traditions that form the foundations of modern American songwriting.\n\nIndeed, Bruce Hornsby’s restless musical spirit continues to spontaneously push him forward into exciting new musical pursuits. He’s composed and performed for many projects with long-time collaborator, filmmaker Spike Lee including end-title songs for two films, “Clockers” (1995, with Chaka Khan) and “Bamboozled” (2001). He contributed music for “If God is Willin’ And the Creek Don’t Rise” (2010), “Old Boy” (2013) and “Chiraq” (2015), and composed full film scores for “Kobe Doin’ Work,” Lee’s 2009 ESPN Kobe Bryant documentary, 2012’s “Red Hook Summer, Da Sweet Blood of Jesus” (2015), and Lee’s film for the NBA2K16 video game (2015). Bruce wrote and performed the end title song “Set Me In Motion” for Ron Howard’s “Backdraft” (1991) and a featured song “Big Stick” for Ron Shelton’s “Tin Cup” (1996). He’s currently working with DeMatteo on a musical entitled SCKBSTD, and contributed music for Disney/Pixar’s “Planes: Fire And Rescue” (2014). Hornsby is also featured onscreen in and contributed music to the Robin Williams/ Bobcat Goldthwaite film “World’s Greatest Dad” (2009), the first (and last!) time he has been asked to “act.” He scored both seasons of Spike Lee’s Netflix series “She’s Gotta Have It,” in 2017 and 2019, wrote and performed new music for Lee’s 2018 film “Blackkklansman,” and contributed a new solo performance of “The Way It Is” for the 2019 documentary “NYC Epicenters 9/11-2021½.”\n\nThree decades after Bruce Hornsby established his global name as the creator of pop hits that defined “the sound of grace on the radio,” as a Rolling Stone reviewer once wrote, such projects continue and are consistent with his lifelong pursuit of musical transcendence. “It’s always been about staying inspired, broadening my reach and range of abilities and influences, and exploring new areas”, Hornsby says. “I’m very fortunate to be able to do that, to be a lifelong student, and to continue to pursue a wide-ranging musical life.”\n\nHis adventurous 21st album, “Absolute Zero,” was released in April 2019, and received some of the most rapturous reviews of Hornsby’s career, from such venues as the New York Times, Spin, Pitchfork, Times of London, Mojo, Guardian U.K., and the Washington Post. “Voyager One” was picked as one of the Best Songs Of 2019 by the New York Times. It featured guests yMusic, Justin Vernon, Blake Mills, Robert Hunter, The Staves, and Jack DeJohnette.\n\nVernon and Hornsby co-wrote and sang a duet together on the main single from the record, “Cast-Off.” They continued their collaborative efforts in writing the song “Yu Man Like” for the new 2019 Bon Iver album “I, I.” Hornsby played piano and sang one lead line.\n\nIn 2020 Hornsby released the follow-up to “Absolute Zero” entitled “Non-Secure Connection,” which was again met with an extremely positive critical reception from The NY Times, Pitchfork, Spin, Esquire, The Times of London, Uncut, UK Evening Standard and The London Sunday Times. “My Resolve,” a duet with James Mercer from The Shins, was picked as one of the Best Songs of 2020 by the New York Times. It featured guests Mercer, Jamila Woods, Leon Russell, Vernon Reid, Justin Vernon, and Rob Moose. Bruce and James appeared in virtual duets on Stephen Colbert and the Virtual Bonnaroo Festival.\n\nAlso appearing with Bruce on the Bonnaroo set was Chicago hip-hop artist Polo G who released “Wishing For A Hero” in 2020, a song inspired by Tupac’s “Changes” that again used the music and some words from “The Way It Is” to great effect. “Wishing For A Hero” was a highly acclaimed and well-received hit from Polo’s 2020 album “The GOAT.”\n\nBruce’s 23rd record, “Flicted,” was released in May 2022 completing the trilogy of albums begun with “Absolute Zero.” Featuring an array of special guests including Ezra Koenig (Vampire Weekend), Danielle Haim (Haim), Blake Mills, and yMusic, the album was again met with critical acclaim from The New York Times, Sunday Times (UK), Uncut, and Pitchfork, amongst others.\n\nFor Heavy MakeUp, improvising songs from the ground up is an exhilarating challenge. “You can express whatever you want, and there’s room for big melodic freedom. I love that,” says Brickell. “CJ and Trever don’t lock you up in musical jail and say, ‘Work in there.’ They create a beautiful horizon, and you can walk in any direction, and they’ll create a wonderland as you go.\n\n“My role is like when someone is writing a score for a film,” she continues, “and they’re making the sounds that will go with the movie. It’s the same way here, just backwards. I hear the score, and then the pictures come and all I have to do is articulate what I’m seeing.”\n\nAs unprecedented as the Heavy MakeUp concept might be, the three performers are uniquely up to the task. To say it another way, it’s hard to imagine a trio of musicians with a wider range of professional experience to draw upon sharing the same stage. Camerieri is a Juilliard grad best known as a co-founder of yMusic, the brilliant New York chamber ensemble. The trumpeter has also been a vital sideman to Bon Iver, Sufjan Stevens, Ben Folds, Sting and the National, and he released his first solo album as CARM in 2021. Hagen, who joins Camerieri in the CARM project, has led interdependent careers as a musician and an academic with a PhD in music sociology. A consummate scholar with a global purview, Hagen’s achievements run the gamut: a Fulbright Award; works published by Oxford University Press and Routledge; collaborations with Bon Iver, Mouse on Mars and many others.\n\nEdie Brickell requires no introduction. Fronting the band New Bohemians, she debuted in 1988 with the landmark album “Shooting Rubberbands at the Stars,” which went double-platinum on the strength of the era-defining Top 10 hit “What I Am.” Since then, her artistic wanderlust has resulted in more acclaimed releases from New Bohemians, the most recent being 2021’s “Hunter and the Dog Star,” as well as music by the Gaddabouts, a jazzy, smoky supergroup featuring Andy Fairweather Low, Steve Gadd and Pino Palladino; Heavy Circles, with Harper Simon; and a Grammy-winning bluegrass partnership with Steve Martin that yielded two albums and the Tony-nominated Broadway show “Bright Star.”\n\nCamerieri and Hagen have extensive experience in the jazz avant-garde, and Brickell has pretty much lived her life engaging in spontaneous song, often narrating her day-to-day with intuitive melody. She also points to the genesis of New Bohemians’ psych-tinged folk-pop, when off-the-cuff song creation was a necessity. “We were getting gigs at these little clubs on a Wednesday night at age 18,” she recalls, “and when they said, ‘You can play for two to three hours,’ as a new band we had five songs. So we would go in there and just wing it — do improv and make it sound like songs.\n\n“Then, in 1993,” Brickell continues, “I had the beautiful good fortune of working with Jerry Garcia and [bassist] Rob Wasserman. And when we finished our goal of making a song for Rob’s “Trios” record, which came out of an improv at Jerry’s house the night before, we just jammed and made up songs. And then Jerry had an idea for an all-improv band where every night it’s something different. But it never came to pass, for obvious reasons.”\n\n“I’ll never forget Edie telling us that Jerry Garcia story,” Camerieri adds, relating his own version of how the trio came to be. “We had done four or five of these improvisations, and I was like, ‘So are these songs you’ve been working on?’ Edie said, ‘No, you made a cool sound and it made me think of a picture and I just started improvising.’ Trever and I were like, ‘Improvising songs like that — that isn’t a thing.’ So she told us the story of Jerry Garcia having a similar reaction, and we thought, ‘Wow — this is OK.’”\n\nThe trio first coalesced for 2022’s “More and More,” a collaborative track off the second CARM full-length. When they made a video for the song, they quickly realized that what should have been a taxing day — a hot, windy, monotonous outdoor shoot — was instead, as Hagen says, ​​an “effervescent kind of interaction, playful and goofy and fun.” Brickell suggested the three reconnect soon for a jam session, so Camerieri and Hagen, who were on the road opening for Bruce Hornsby, went to New York as soon as they had a weekend off. They set up the gear they use for CARM’s live dates, Hagen laid down a drum-machine beat and Heavy MakeUp was off and running. Evocative synth tones, tasteful brass embellishment and deceptively spontaneous lyrics followed, and about 30 well-shaped songs poured forth. By the time Camerieri and Hagen made it back to the elevator, they were in a state of elated disbelief. “This was just an entirely different way of communicating with music,” Hagen says.\n\nIn 2023, Heavy MakeUp made their proper concert debut at the Newport Folk Festival and released a self-titled album. “These are lively improvisational sketches,” raved “No Depression,” “balancing Camerieri and Hagen’s experimental-jazz blends of synths, beats and horns against Brickell’s playfully rhythmic lyrics and sweetly seductive singing.”\n\nThat debut’s brand-new follow-up, “Here It Comes,” is a collection of 11 songs that represent the continuing evolution of the trio’s clairvoyant rapport. “This record was intentional, and the first one was by accident,” Brickell says with a chuckle. Heavy MakeUp is still by and large an act of impromptu, unfettered musical joy, though the members have firmed up their chemistry, refined their methods and furthered their shared confidence and trust. A two-week writing retreat last year in Texas was especially revelatory. “We played every day,” Brickell recalls, “just allowing the spirit to evolve, getting more and more comfortable with each other. Getting pizza [laughs]. We talked about the process together.”\n\nMore than 100 songs emerged, and Hagen pared down and curated into an emotionally sweeping yet rhythmically propulsive set.\n\nFrom the gently irresistible hooks of “Shoe in the Air,” with its unforgettable opening lyrical image, to the trap-tinged verses of “Under Construction” and the atmospheric rock of “Enough Runnin’ Around,” it’s often astounding to think that these tracks were conjured out of thin air. “To me this is the realest music,” says Brickell, “because music is so much about expressing how you feel. You’re actually feeling it in real time, as opposed to trying to remember what’s in the song.”\n\n“And this project combines all these different skills that we’ve worked on for years,” adds Camerieri, “as jazz musicians, as sidemen, as songwriters, as producers. It’s the ultimate musician’s job.”\n\n“But it’s much more than that,” Brickell insists. “CJ and Trever are very inspiring. It’s the energy in the room. It’s the people. It’s the freedom and the enthusiasm. These beautiful spirits inspire a song every time.”"
