        "text": "Bruce Hornsby would like to invite you on a creative adventure: The renowned pianist’s latest album, a collaboration with an avant garde chamber ensemble called yMusic, is a collection of experimental music that explores ocean themes.\n\nThe name of the combined group is BrhyM, from the first letter or two of Bruce Hornsby and yMusic. Released last month and called “Deep Sea Vents,” the new album’s songs aren’t instant classics like “The Way It Is,” Hornsby’s triumphant 1986 breakout hit.\n\nNo, these compositions demand repeated listenings, each time revealing more depth and shifting currents, like the sea.\n\nThe opening song, “Wild Whaling Life,” was shaped by Hornsby’s reading of “Moby-Dick,” while “The Wake of St. Brendan” is based on the life of adventurous author Tim Severin, who retraced the journey of early seafarers.\n\nBrhyM appears Sunday, April 7, at the Luther Burbank Center in Santa Rosa.\n\nA restless artist intent on discovering something new, Hornsby has received blowback from fans for departing from the sounds and style of his early records.\n\n“There's a semi-sizable part of my audience that is adventurous, but the majority really would rather I just wrote songs that sound exactly like my first two or three records,” he said during a phone interview from his home in Williamsburg, Virginia.\n\n“I've been getting nasty letters from fans since my second record, which stylistically was so similar to the first record,” he said.\n\n“When I started getting nasty letters, my reaction was, ‘Well, you haven't seen anything yet.’ But it wasn't really in reaction to that; it's just who I am.”\n\nHe’ll still play a few classics: Recent setlists show “The Way It Is” and “Mandolin Rain.” With the new ensemble the songs take on fresh layers and novel textures, as his dexterity and precision as a piano player, as well as the richness and warmth of his tone, endure.\n\nHornsby, 69, says he doesn’t view his songs as “museum pieces” but as “living beings” that “evolve and grow.”\n\nHe describes himself as a “lifelong student, an old music school nerd.” He studied at Berklee College of Music in Boston and in music programs at universities.\n\n“I refuse to be put into this creative prison (for) the nostalgia-loving fan,” he said. “I've just always refused to be shackled by that.”\n\nWhile Hornsby’s music has been experimental for decades, his expeditions gained intensity on his last four records, starting with “Absolute Zero” and culminating with “Deep Sea Vents,” he said.\n\n“This is where I really, to a lot of my old-time fans, went off the deep end.”\n\nWhether a project is commercially successful “is not the point,” Hornsby said. “I'm just following my muse, following the inspiration and looking for the new.”\n\nHe’s won three Grammy Awards, for Best New Artist in 1987, Best Bluegrass Recording in 1990 for a collaboration with the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, and Best Pop Instrumental Performance in 1994.\n\nHornsby and his piano have supported Bob Dylan, Mavis Staples, Bonnie Raitt, Willie Nelson, Ricky Skaggs and banjo virtuoso Bela Fleck, yet his best-known collaboration was with the Grateful Dead.\n\nThrough the late 1980s, as his solo career vaulted him into the pop stratosphere, Hornsby would occasionally open for the Dead and join Jerry Garcia, Bobby Weir and the boys on stage.\n\n“It just was a gradually evolving and growing relationship,” he recalled. “They would ask me to sit in with them after we'd open, then I'd just show up and strap on the accordion and sing ‘Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again.’”\n\nShortly after Grateful Dead keyboardist Brent Mydland died in July 1990, the band asked Hornsby to become a full-time member, he said. Hornsby appreciatively declined because his own career had hit its stride.\n\n“I need to continue to pursue this,” he told the Dead, but “I will help you out through any adjustment period for the new guy who may not know your music as well as I do.”\n\nThe Dead had a six-show run in New York’s Madison Square Garden in September 1990 and had hired Vince Welnick to play keyboards, but they wanted Hornsby on piano.\n\nThey “were buying me out of gigs, paying off promoters, because I had had gigs booked that week,” Hornsby said. “I showed up off the street and started winging it with them at Madison Square Garden with no rehearsal.”\n\nYet he was far from unprepared. When Hornsby was in high school, his older brother, then at the University of Virginia, led a band called Bobby Hornsby and the High Octane Kids, which played Grateful Dead songs.\n\n“I was little brother Brucey Hornsby playing Fender Rhodes piano and singing lead on ‘Jack Straw.’ So I had the training when they called me.”\n\nAfter working in obscurity for years to score a record deal, Hornsby had a hugely popular touring band and was playing frequently with the Dead.\n\n“It's hard to tour with two bands,” he recalled. “I was only home 18 days in 1990, and only 30 days in 1991, because I was playing with both bands and playing on tons of records” with other artists, he said.\n\nHe “came up for air” in 1992 “when my wife and I had twin sons. And I said to myself, ‘I can't do this. I don't want to be an absentee father.’”\n\nSince then, Hornsby has charted his own course, or rather let his muse guide him on maiden voyages.\n\nDuring the pandemic, yMusic would create a track and send it to Hornsby, and “I’d just write a song over that track, melody and words.”\n\nSometimes he’d add piano or dulcimer, “but I’ve almost never changed anything that they did,” he said, which speaks to the respect these musicians have for one another.\n\n“I've tried to blow their minds every time, and they were pretty much really happy with everything I sent them. So I never asked for a change from them. And they never asked for any changes for me.”\n\nMichael Shapiro’s latest book, “The Creative Spark,” won the Independent Publishers award.
