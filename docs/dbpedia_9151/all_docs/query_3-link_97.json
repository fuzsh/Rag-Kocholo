Craig is one of my favorite singer/songwriters from my beloved hometown of Portland Oregon. You will be absolutely delighted by this concert. I am incredibly grateful that Craig has agreed to sing in our little valley and we welcome him to our flower farm!\n\nOriginally from Portland, Oregon Craig Carothers lived in Portland before it was hip and moved to Nashville before it was ready for prime time. He’s always been a little ahead of the curve and an old school kind of cool. His music is heartbreakingly beautiful and scathingly funny, delivered with a lively deadpan smile and a voice that’s downright swoony. Too folk for rock, too pop for folk, too jazz for country, too tall to be a jockey. It's difficult to easily categorize his music without the use of hyphens. But the wide-ranging influences of Craig’s music-teacher parents can be heard in each of his 20+ albums. He’s a songwriter’s songwriter, sharing co-writes with Bruce Hornsby, Marty Stewart, Don Henry, Maia Sharp, and Don Schlitz, to name a few. He’s had songs recorded by Trisha Yearwood, Kathy Mattea, Lorrie Morgan, Russell Hitchcock, and Peter, Paul and Mary, as well as numerous international artists whose names are un-spellable.\n\nAs a touring musician and a regular at the Bluebird Cafe in Nashville, Craig has shared a stage with the likes of Richard Thompson, Janis Ian, Donovan, David Wilcox, John Gorka, Catie Curtis, Greg Brown, Patty Larkin, Michael McDonald, and Kim Richey.\n\nFor the last ten years Craig has also been sharing his songwriting expertise through online and in-person songwriting workshops across the U.S. and Europe, and as a professor at the University of Miami.\n\nA true Renaissance man, Craig is also a producer, recording engineer, background singer, booking agent, graphic designer, photographer, Tex-Mex connoisseur, left-wing in-activist, and a collector of exquisitely obsolete gadgets.\n\nHis many recording are available at live shows and via the website, as well as Amazon, iTunes, Spotify, Pandora, CDbaby, and all other digital streaming providers.\n\n\"39 Pink Flamingos,\" Craig's most recent release is currently available on all digital platforms, at shows, and via his website.\n\nConcerts are limited to 125 people. Buy your tickets early!\n\nFood vendors and/or curated charcuterie boxes will be for available. Food sales will be available from 5:15-7:00 for your picnicking ease and pleasure. Information on food vendors will be delivered to ticket holders a week before the concert via email.\n\nBring chairs, and bug spray! There is a clean porta potty and sanitizer is provided. Trash and recycling cans are on the premise.\n\nArrive by 5:45 to secure parking.
