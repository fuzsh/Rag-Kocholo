        "text": "Photo by Dave Vann\n\nAward-winning pianist, singer and songwriter Bruce Hornsby has announced his new studio album ‘Flcited will release on May 27 via his own Zappo Productions/Thirty Tigers. In celebration of the record announcement, the Grateful Dead alum and ’80s icon shared the LP’s lead single “Sidelines.”\n\n‘Flcited was recorded in the summer of 2021 and serves as a followup to Hornsby’s acclaimed albums Absolute Zero and Non-Secure Connection. According to a press relase, the LP completes the trilogy of song collections based on film “cues” Hornsby composed for writer and director Spike Lee. The approach enabled Hornsby to explore new stylistic techniques and work with a wide array of artists. “The album title ‘Flicted relates to this strange time in which we live, when the world is basically, well, ‘flicted,” Hornsby shared in the release.\n\n“Sidelines” includes a duet between Hornsby and Vampire Weekend’s Ezra Koenig and features Black Mills–who co-wrote the song–on guitar. The debut was released alongside an accompanying video, directed by animator Kitty Ninon Anais Faingold.\n\nFaingold spoke on the video: “I wanted the video to read like visual poetry by using allegorical imagery and a stream of consciousness method of working. I also wanted to give it a hand-crafted feel to emphasize the sensitivity of the song and vulnerability of the lyrics, so I worked with watercolors on thin computer paper which I then took photos of. This gave the animation a lot of texture and a level of DIY analogue imperfection which I think works well with the idea of vulnerability and human emotion.”\n\nHorsby went into greater detail about the single writing, “‘Sidelines’ is a song about hysteria in various forms, starting with the Salem witch trials of the 1600’s then to the present-day pandemic-era panic. It features angular melodic content vocally and a pointillistic middle instrumental section.”\n\nThe album, which was co-produced by Hornsby and Tony Berg, features 12-tracks and also features a duet with Danielle Haim, contributions from Rob Moose and the first ever cover song to appear on a Hornsby studio release; Chuck Berry’s “Too Much Monkey Business.”\n\nAdditionally Hornsby and his band the Noisemakers will embark on an large scale tour starting March 26. The tour includes performances at Los Angeles’ Troubadour, Chicago’s Athenaeum Theatre, Cincinnati’s Taft Theatre and Brooklyn, N.Y.’s Brooklyn Bowl, as well as, festivals including Elkhart Jazz Fest, Rocky Mountain Folk Festival, Strings Music Festival and more.\n\nPre-order ‘Flcited here.\n\nRead Relix‘s feature on Hornsby here.\n\nListen to Sidelines below:\n\n‘Flicted Tracklist\n\n1.
