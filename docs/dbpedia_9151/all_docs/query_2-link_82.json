It sees three dimensional printed characters who can be seen variously re-arranging furniture in a dolls-house, attempting to learn a new language and thinking about what to do next in their lives.\n\nIt’s taken from Hornsby’s new album, ”Flicted’, which was released yesterday (May 27). Prior to that single release, the album was teased with lead single ‘Sidelines’, which featured Vampire Weekend’s Ezra Koenig.\n\nCheck out the video for ‘Days Ahead’ here:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier this week (May 25), Drake shared a photo on his Instagram from his first time meeting LA sisters Haim.\n\n“Just met the Beatles,” he wrote in the caption alongside the black and white photo which shows the rapper with Este, Danielle and Alana Haim.\n\nRecommended\n\nHaim also shared the photo on their Instagram account, jokingly writing “We’re the Beatles” in their caption.\n\nThe band are currently on their 2022 North American tour in support of their latest album ‘Women In Music Pt. III‘. Last week, they stopped over in Drake’s hometown of Toronto, Ontario to perform at RBC Echo Beach.\n\nElsewhere, Haim are due to return to the UK this summer to play Glastonbury 2022 before embarking on their COVID-delayed ‘One More Haim’ stint on these shores in July. Any remaining tickets for those dates can be found here.\n\nHaim’s 2022 UK/Ireland tour dates are as follows:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJUNE 2022\n\n28 – Trinity College, Dublin\n\nJULY 2022\n\n13 – Millennium Square, Leeds\n\n14 – SSE Hydro, Glasgow\n\n16 – O2 Victoria Warehouse, Manchester\n\n17 – O2 Victoria Warehouse, Manchester\n\n19 – Motorpoint Arena, Nottingham\n\n20 – Motorpoint Arena, Cardiff\n\n21 – The O2 Arena, London"
