        "text": "Santa Monica, CA – (March 2, 2016) – Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter Bruce Hornsby is announcing the first set of his summer tour dates with his band The Noisemakers which will take the group across the country. The tour kicks off in Live Oak, FL on April 16th and will continue into September. Highlights include Eaux Claires, DelFest, a mini-reunion show Ricky Skaggs and Kentucky Thunder on 6/21, and the premiere edition of the Funhouse Festival in Bruce’s hometown of Williamsburg, VA—a three day event presented by Hornsby and the Virginia Arts Festival (6/24-26). Hornsby will also be promoting an all new album with the Noisemakers, Rehab Reunion, which features Bruce on dulcimer and will be released June 17th on 429 Records.\n\nBruce Hornsby’s work displays a creative iconoclasm that’s been a constant in the artist’s three decade recording career. His commercial stock soared early on, when “The Way It Is”–the title track of his 1986 debut album celebrating its 30th anniversary this year–became one of the most popular songs on American radio. Despite his early mainstream successes, Hornsby has pursued a more personal, idiosyncratic musical path, focusing on projects that sparked his creative interest, including collaborations with the Grateful Dead, Spike Lee, Ricky Skaggs, Don Henley, Ornette Coleman, Bob Dylan, Bela Fleck, Bonnie Raitt, Pat Metheny, and Robbie Robertson. Hornsby’s performance will offer a glimpse of a restless spirit who continues to push forward into exciting new musical terrain. With The Noisemakers, he seamlessly combines elements of rock, jazz, R&B and modern classical to creating a strikingly distinctive style. The epitome of a musical family, The Noisemakers consists of bassist J.V. Collier, keyboardist/organist John “JT” Thomas, drummer Sonny Emory and new Noisemakers Ross Holmes on fiddle/mandolin and Gibb Droll on guitar.\n\nConfirmed Tour Dates:\n\n4.16 Live Oak, FL Wanee Festival\n\n4.17 Charleston, SC Southern Ground Festival\n\n5.14 Cherokee, TX Cherokee Creek Music Festival\n\n5.15 Austin, TX Stubbs Waller Creek Amphitheatre\n\n5.17 Wichita, KS Orpheum Theater\n\n5.18 Kansas City, MO Knucklehead’s\n\n5.20 Des Moines, IA Brenton Skating Plaza\n\n5.21 St. Luis, MO River City Casino\n\n5.22 Columbia, MO The Blue Note\n\n5.24 Carmel, IN The Palladium\n\n5.26 Cleveland, OH Hard Rock Live\n\n5.27 Cincinnati, OH Taft Theatre\n\n5.28 Cumberland, MD DelFest\n\n6.21 Black Mountain, NC Pisgah Brewing Co.
