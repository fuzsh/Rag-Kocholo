        "text": "[The following is from the official press release.]\n\nNickel Creek and Margo Price are among the top tier of what’s shaping up to be an eclectic Bristol Rhythm & Roots Reunion lineup in 2023. The award-winning festival returns to Historic Downtown Bristol, Tenn.-Va. for its 22nd annual event September, 8-10.\n\nOther acts included in the initial lineup announcement include Bruce Hornsby & The Noisemakers, Watchhouse, The Mavericks, 49 Winchester, Larkin Poe, Allison Russell, Amythyst Kiah, and Walderado, with more artists to be announced in the spring.\n\nBristol Rhythm boasts a super-sized lineup each year and offers more than a dozen outdoor stages and indoor venues along State Street, where Tennessee meets Virginia. Established to honor the legacy of producer Ralph Peer’s 1927 Bristol Sessions, which gave us the first recordings of the Carter Family and Jimmie Rodgers, Bristol Rhythm & Roots Reunion is to roots music what Peer was to country – a tastemaker. Just as the 1927 Bristol Sessions introduced the world to those legendary performers, the festival has a reputation of also catching stars on the rise.\n\nThose seminal recordings that created the “Big Bang” of country music continue to influence a wide range of genres and you’ll find a diverse sampling of sounds at Bristol Rhythm – from indie rock and cow punk to Piedmont blues and traditional bluegrass. As more acts are added to the bill in 2023, you may just glimpse a future festival headliner among the middle or lower tiers of the roster.\n\nWeekend passes to Bristol Rhythm & Roots Reunion, along with a limited number of VIP packages, are on sale now.\n\nAbout Bristol Rhythm & Roots Reunion:\n\nBristol, Tennessee/Virginia is heralded as the birthplace of country music, home to the 1927 Bristol Sessions recordings. The award-winning Bristol Rhythm & Roots Reunion is a celebration of that great legacy and is renowned for its diverse headliners, established touring acts, up-and-coming artists, and some of the Appalachian regions finest music across a wide variety of roots genres. It is also noted for its unique downtown setting along State Street, where Virginia and Tennessee meet to form the twin cities of Bristol. The festival hosts an estimated 45,000 attendees over the course of the 3-day weekend.
