        "text": "Thanks to Shahid Chowdhary for sharing and I will reply in a post as I've exceeded my LinkedIn word count for replies. The resurgence of physical manifestations of musical output and fandom is interestingly not linked with baby boomer nostalgia but with teenagers. The top-selling vinyl albums right now are current artists, not classic bands (see https://lnkd.in/efFVYJfP) According to the Recording Industry Association of America, in the first six months of 2023, 17 million vinyl records were sold in the United States, generating $467 million in retail revenue, nearly double the amount from the same period in 2020. By comparison, CDs sales were worth just half of that. Overall, streaming represents approx. 84 percent of US domestic music revenues but from my teenage daughter I am learning that vinyl is just part of a multifactorial music experience that includes hard copy magazines, posters, t-shirts and live events. Taylor Swift, Olivia Rodrigo and Lana Del Rey make physical outputs an important part of their artistry, marketing and fan experience. What is equally important is the buying experience and physical in-place shop. The reopening of the flagship HMV store in London's Oxford Street is a reflection of this experiential shop environment. The best example in my experience is Rough Trade which brings the physical experience to a whole other level with coffee shop, live bands and artist meet and greets (https://lnkd.in/e6YKNNXq) So in isolation, I don't see magazines making a comeback unless they are aligned and intimately entwined with the passionate customer experience. A lesson for any business is to be truly customer centric and remain close to their passions and needs.\n\nThe Work Package 5 of ICH North organized an expert meeting with archive and collection experts of ISOF / Institutet för språk och folkminnen. Aim of the WP 5 is to create a roadmap/strategy about community approach for archives and museums working ith music collections in the area. The themes & topics proposed so far: 1. Ownership How are communities involved in defining the principles of usage? What are the connections among copyright, creative commons and traditional knowledge? How can TK labels and its lighter adaptations work in practice? 2. Community involvement in documentation What (and how) do the communities think that should be collected? How to shift the responsibility/power towards the communities in the decision making process? 3. Dissemination (community & general level) What, how and to whom do the communities think that should be disseminated? How to shift the responsibility/power towards the communities in the decision making process? #intangibleculturalheritage #ichnorth #interregaurora #livingheritage\n\nI saw the Grammy-award winning musician Rhiannon Giddens perform a few weeks ago in New York City, my hometown. First and foremost, the music was electric and covered so many genres. Beyond giving a stunning performance, the one thing that stood out was that Rhiannon is a fervent Collaborator. How does she do it? 🟪She seeks out talent to co-write songs 🟪She generously gives stage time to each of her bandmates, promoting their work 🟪She works in many musical genres and joins forces with best-in-class artists That got me thinking about the way clients work with me on developing their LinkedIn content strategy and ghostwriting their content. Here’s how I do it: 🟪I develop trusting relationships with all team members 🟪I listen intently to client concerns and then translate that into targeted content based on their needs 🟪At times, I co-author content as needed Who are your best collaborators? #collaboration #emotionalintelligence —----------------------------------- Read my April tip sheet, “How to Transform Thought Leadership into “Must-Read” Content” Link in 1st comment below👇🏽\n\n🎶 As an accomplished musician, Michael is aware of the positive impact music can have not just on mood and health but also on academic performance, a phenomenon known as the “MOZART” effect. 🎙 As a singer-songwriter, he is well-versed in an artistic process that rewards openness, flexibility, and receptivity. 😊 These lessons learned from years of music and songwriting inform Michael’s tutoring, as he aims to affect his students in an inspired and creative way, a phenomenon known as the “MR.
