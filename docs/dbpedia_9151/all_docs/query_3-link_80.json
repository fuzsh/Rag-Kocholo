        "text": "Blues Traveler opens for Bruce Hornsby at Biltmore\n\nFor their first 25 years of making music together, the members of Blues Traveler were committed to writing all of their songs themselves, an approach that vocalist/harmonica player John Popper has called a “misguided homage to The Beatles.”\n\nBut in crafting their new album “Blow Up the Moon,” the five-piece pressed reset and brought in collaborators from a cornucopia of genres, a rejuvenating process that bassist Tad Kinchla likens to “being in a garage band” and “exploring songs for first time.”\n\nThe idea was thrown out to a wide network of musicians, nearly all of whom were interested but only some of whom had space in their busy schedules for writing and recording.\n\n“We had kind of a ridiculous time frame — we did it all in summer and fall — but we were amazed at how many people wanted to do it,” Kinchla said. “To be honest, the best way to do these things is just have the artist call the artist.”\n\nMost of those who said “yes” were new connections for Blues Traveler, artists with whose work they were familiar but whom they’d yet to personally meet. While expanding their contacts and musical horizons, they had a blast swapping band histories and stories with such seemingly disparate artists as Jewel, country duo Thompson Square, pop-punk band Plain White T’s and ska-punk quintet Dirty Heads.\n\n“In the studio, you have enough time to get to know someone,” Kinchla said. “You can create better friendships in a week in the studio than you do knowing someone for a year in your hometown just because you’re talking for, like, 12 hours and you get to know stuff that no one else would reveal to you in a week’s time.”\n\nKeeping these new relationships active, Blues Traveler had a mini album reunion during the band’s annual July 4 show at Red Rocks when Boulder, Colo., electronic duo 3OH!3 – with whom Kinchla says they had the most cohesive collaboration – Hanson and J.C. Chasez (N*Sync) joined them at the picturesque amphitheater.\n\nAs for other guest spots on their current late summer/early fall tour, Kinchla imagines that he and his bandmates will “annoy someone enough to make them come out,” and though the logistics make it difficult, he’d love to gather all of the collaborators in one place, ideally for a benefit, and perform “Blow Up the Moon” live in its entirety.\n\nNot involved in the new album is Bruce Hornsby, of whose work all of Blues Traveler — especially keyboardist Ben Wilson — are big fans. Though they’ve crossed paths at festivals over the years, their Aug. 22 date at the Biltmore House marks their first time sharing a stage.\n\nCould Popper’s harmonica guest on a Hornsby song or the famed piano man sit in with the opening act? Kinchla is as excited as anyone to find out.\n\nEdwin Arnaudin writes about entertainment for Asheville Scene. Email him at edwinarnaudin@gmail.com.\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nWho: Blues Traveler and Bruce Hornsby & the Noisemakers.\n\nWhen: 8 p.m. Aug. 22.\n\nWhere: Biltmore Estate, South Terrace"
