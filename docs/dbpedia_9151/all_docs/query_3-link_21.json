        "text": "Over the weekend, Bruce Hornsby hosted his inaugural Funhouse Fest, a three-day celebration in his hometown of Williamsburg, VA, that featured music from Hornsby and The Noisemakers, Greensky Bluegrass, Railroad Earth, Ricky Skaggs, Taj Mahal Trio and more.\n\nThe opening night of the festival saw Hornsby team up with Skaggs and Kentucky Thunder and a Greensky set that featured a shoutout to the late Ralph Stanley, multiple power outages that had Hornsby and Skaggs playing the part of lighting engineer with flashlights and a cover of Bruce Springsteen’s “Atlantic City” that the band dedicated to the generator.\n\nHornsby’s two sets with The Noisemakers included full-album live treatments to both The Way It Is and his newest effort, Rehab Reunion. On Saturday, drummer Jack DeJohnette and saxophonist Ravi Coltrane joined Hornsby for “The Way It Is,” while Railroad Earth’s John Skehan and Andy Goessling helped out on “Mandolin Rain.” For the final day of music on Sunday, Hornsby’s brother Bobby joined in on bass for several tunes, including “Funhouse” and a “Sunflower Cat” that featured quotes from Bob Dylan’s “It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry” and Prince’s “When Doves Cry.”"
