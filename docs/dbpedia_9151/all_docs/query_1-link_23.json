        "text": "Bruce Hornsby has built one of the most diverse, collaborative, and adventurous careers in contemporary music. Drawing from a vast wellspring of American musical traditions, the singer/pianist/composer/bandleader has created a large and accomplished body of work and employed a vast array of stylistic approaches. Throughout this period, Hornsby has maintained the integrity, virtuosity, and artistic curiosity that have been hallmarks of his work from the start and garnered 13 Grammy Award nominations, three of which he won. Hornsby first rose to national prominence with The Way It Is, his 1986 Grammy-winning debut album with the Range. The title track became the most-played song on American radio in 1987 and was sampled in Tupac Shakur’s timeless hit “Changes” the following year.\n\nHornsby’s 23 albums have sold over 11 million copies worldwide, and he has appeared on over 100 records including releases with Bob Dylan, Don Henley, Stevie Nicks, Ricky Skaggs, Bob Seger, Chaka Khan, Bon Iver, Brandon Flowers, Bonnie Raitt, Sting, Mavis Staples, Willie Nelson, and more."
