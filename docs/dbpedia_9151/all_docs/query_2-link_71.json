        "text": "“What is left when unhungry?,” Justin Vernon sings midway through “22, a Million,” his third album as Bon Iver. It’s one of many questions this 35-year-old songwriter and multi-instrumentalist asks of himself in the course of the album. And it’s answered, in some ways, by the songs themselves on Bon Iver’s most diverse, noisiest, shortest, knottiest and most experimental album so far.\n\nDue for release on Sept. 30, “22, a Million,” is one more sharp turn in a career that has carried Mr. Vernon from indie-rock obscurity in Wisconsin clubs to festival stages and the Grammys, including an improbable detour via hip-hop and Kanye West. The songwriter and pianist Bruce Hornsby — one of Mr. Vernon’s avowed influences and, lately, a collaborator — described Mr. Vernon in a phone interview as “a soul singer who creates these unique and beautiful sonic landscapes on which to perform.”\n\nThose landscapes have grown ever more painstakingly inventive. Making the album, Mr. Vernon said earlier this month, was at times spontaneous, at times convoluted and often uncertain. “It was a long moment, these last few years, thinking: What am I doing? What do I want to do it for?” he said.\n\nMr. Vernon needed five years, three of them concentrated on writing and recording the new album, to clarify for himself what Bon Iver means and sounds like, now that he can count on a worldwide audience to keep him “unhungry.”\n\n“I feel both blessed and cursed by the fact that I can do whatever I want at this point,” Mr. Vernon said in a rare extended interview in the recording studio at Pioneer Works in Brooklyn, a gallery and performance space in Red Hook where he is on the advisory board. “I have more recognition than I had ever wanted to deal with.”\n\nThe pressure he felt was not commercial. “22, a Million” is a bumpier ride than Bon Iver’s previous albums. It constantly mixes distorted and manipulated sounds with natural ones, and it deliberately veers away from pop familiarity. But it also progresses toward solace, grounding its closing songs in steadfast melodies and consoling harmonies. “It’s important to me to not pay any attention to questions of, ‘What’s your legacy going to be?’ or ‘What are you going to leave behind?’ or ‘How do you work into the current scene?’ or ‘How do you relate to the chart-toppers?’” Mr. Vernon said. “I find all of that stuff not only distracting but kind of the opposite of what it all means.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
