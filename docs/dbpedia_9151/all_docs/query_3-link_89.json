        "text": "Musicians Who Love Sports\n\nJay-Z\n\nThe multi-platinum rap icon, who grew up playing hoops in Brooklyn, liked the New Jersey Nets so much he bought a stake in their ownership group. The Nets now play in a new arena in Jay-Z's old `hood.\n\nNelly\n\nThe Grammy-winning rapper, a former standout in the St. Louis Amateur Baseball Association, was a minority owner of the NBA's Charlotte Bobcats and has been involved with NASCAR's truck circuit.\n\nTim McGraw\n\nThe country music star and son of former major league pitcher Tug McGraw went to Northeast Louisiana on a baseball scholarship and studied sports medicine. He was a minority owner of arena football's Nashville Kats.\n\nKid Rock and Hank Williams Jr.\n\nDetroit native Kid, a major Pistons fan, teamed musically with country titan Williams, who is as well-known for asking the nation \"Are you ready for some football?\" as he is for his more than 60 albums and legendary father.\n\nSnoop Dogg\n\nOften spotted at a wide variety of sports events, the superstar rapper has been known to play in the NBA Entertainment League. Dogg also started a youth football league in Southern California and coached his sons' team in the aptly-named Snooper Bowl.\n\nKelly Clarkson\n\nNASCAR signed the 2002 American Idol champ to the most lucrative spokesperson deal it has ever given to a recording artist. Clarkson, who played volleyball, track and basketball in high school, took a spin once with Jimmie Johnson in the pace car at the Daytona 500.\n\nUsher\n\nThe seven-time Grammy-winning R&B star is part owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers and quick to suit up for events like the Midsummer Night's Dream Celebrity Basketball Game in L.A.\n\nKenny Chesney\n\nThe Academy of Country Music's Entertainer of the Year for four consecutive years (2005-08) was a pint-sized receiver at Gibbs High in Corryton, Tenn. A friend of Saints head coach Sean Payton, Chesney suited up and practiced with the team once.\n\nJewel\n\nThe sensitive singer-songwriter-poet, a four-time Grammy-nominee, has a thing for thunder. A NASCAR fan and official spokesperson who has performed at the Nextel Cup Awards ceremony, Jewel was behind the wheel in the racing reality show Young Guns.\n\nNick Mason\n\nPink Floyd's longtime drummer owns more than 30 vintage race cars and has driven in the 24 Hours of Le Mans five times. In June 2007, Mason took the wheel of a 1936 Auto Union Type C at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in West Sussex, England.\n\nBruce Dickinson\n\nThe lead singer of Iron Maiden, left, which sponsors a youth soccer team in the U.K., is a former ranked fencer (foil) in England and founder of Duellist Fencing Equipment. Bandmate Steve Harris, right, who tried out for a pro team, plays in charity events.\n\nRod Stewart\n\nAs a teen in the '60s, Rod The Mod signed an apprentice contract with Brenton Football Club and is a renowned fan of Scotland's Celtic, hosting team practices on the pitch at his Essex estate. He also indulges his love of soccer by playing in charity events.\n\nElton John\n\nA huge soccer and tennis fan, the former Reginald Dwight is the former chairman of his hometown Watford Hornets and was part-owner of the L.A. Aztecs of the North American Soccer League in the '70s. A friend of tennis great Billie Jean King, his Smash Hits celebrity tennis match benefits the Elton John AIDS Foundation.\n\nFlea\n\nThe Red Hot Chili Peppers' hyperkinetic bassist, a devoted Lakers fan, has blogged on NBA.com and can be found at NASCAR events.\n\nBoyd Tinsley\n\nThe Charlottesville, Va., native and violinist for the Dave Mathews Band hosts the annual Boyd Tinsley USTA Women's Championships in his hometown and sponsors a local youth tennis program that bears his name.\n\nBruce Hornsby\n\nThe 6' 4\" songwriting piano whiz, playing at the 2004 NBA Eastern Conference Finals, was a basketball standout at James Blair High in Williamsburg, Va. Hornsby befriended Allen Iverson in 1993.\n\nEddie Vedder\n\nPearl Jam's lead singer grew up in Chicago and is a major Cubs, Bears and Bulls fan. He once warmed up with Kerry Wood before singing the national anthem at Wrigley Field. ChiTown sports luminaries such as Dennis Rodman have taken the stage with Pearl Jam.\n\nGarth Brooks\n\nThe country music superstar is no stranger to Major League parks. Brooks fulfilled a dream by playing for the San Diego Padres in a spring training game against the Cubs in 1998. He pinch ran for Wally Joyner.\n\nSheryl Crow\n\nCrow is a self-described \"NASCAR groupie\" and friend of Dale Earnhardt, Jr. Crow took up cycling to stay fit and attends major tennis tournaments, such as the U.S. Open.\n\nAlice Cooper\n\nIs it shocking that the man who once carved up baby dolls and hung himself onstage is an accomplished golf nut who has played in the ATT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am Championship? He also hosts an annual celebrity-am tourney in Scottsdale, Ariz, and was once part-owner of the Diamondbacks\n\nPhish\n\nThe beloved jam band was always good for a barbershop quartet rendition of the national anthem. Guitarist Trey Anastasio (far right) played hockey in high school and entertained dreams of skating for the Wisconsin Badgers. Keyboardist Page McConnell (left) formed a band named after former Oakland A's ace Vida Blue.\n\nJon Bon Jovi\n\nThe Jersey rocker previously co-owned the Arena Football League's Philadelphia Soul. Here he seems to be getting some advice from Patriots owner Robert Kraft.\n\nJustin Timberlake\n\nInfamous for his role in Janet Jackson's Super Bowl wardrobe malfunction, the pop megastar plays in the NBA Entertainment League and has worked out with the Dallas Mavericks. Timberlake, who once served as a sideline NBA announcer for TNT, is also an avid golfer, and takes his clubs wherever he goes.\n\nIce Cube\n\nA founding member of rap pioneers NWA, Ice Cube played in the 2006 NBA All-Star Jam Session in Houston.\n\nRobert Plant\n\nTalk about a Whole Lotta Love. The legendary lead singer for Led Zeppelin is a tennis buff who has taken lessons with former pro Pat Cash and befriended John McEnroe.\n\nAlanis Morrissette\n\nThe popular Canadian songstress, a native of Ottawa, was a natural for singing the national anthems at the 2007 Stanley Cup Final at Scotiabank Place. She became an avid surfer after moving to Los Angeles.\n\nHuey Lewis\n\nThe man who delivered such multi-platinum '80s smashes as Sports and Fore! (which featured 49ers stars Joe Montana, Ronnie Lott and Dwight Clark on backing vocals) is frequently seen plying his putter in celebrity golf events.\n\nJohn Fogerty\n\nThe composer-singer of the modern baseball classic \"Centerfield\" is, surprise, a baseball fan. He sang the tune at the Yankees' World Series victory parade in 2000 and has performed on behalf of Cardinals manager Tony LaRussa's Animal Rescue Foundation.\n\nMaster P\n\nFormer New Orleans high school hoopster Percy Robert Miller tried out as a guard with the Charlotte Hornets (1998) and Toronto Raptors ('99) and played for the CBA's Fort Wayne Fury. The creator of the platinum rap album Tru 2 Da Game also started No Limit Sports Management, which represented then-Saints running back Ricky Williams.\n\nNickelback\n\nThe Canadian rockers count many NHL players among their fans and can be found on the ice at practices. Lead singer Chad Kroeger got a few pointers from The Great One (Wayne Gretzky) while on tour in Phoenix in 2006."
