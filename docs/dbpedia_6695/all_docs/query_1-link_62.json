        "text": "What does persecution look like in Afghanistan?\n\nIn the years since the Taliban took power in August 2021, Afghanistan has at least had some level of political stability—but that stability has extended to crushing pressure and violence against minority groups. As far as the Taliban are concerned, there are no Christians in Afghanistan. Most house churches that existed before the Taliban (even if they had to be hidden) have been closed, as believers were forced to flee or go even further underground.\n\nWhen the Taliban came to power, they did so with pledges to recognize more freedoms than in the past. But that hasn't happened—if an Afghan's Christian faith is discovered, it can be a death sentence, or they can be detained and tortured into giving information about fellow believers. The surrounding society and family structure has no room for religious freedom, and the government upholds this rigid stance. This means Christians—almost all of whom are converts from Islam—must keep their faith secret, or they may simply disappear.\n\nThousands of Afghan refugees live in countries bordering Afghanistan, often in poor conditions in camps for displaced people, and many Christians are among them.\n\nWho is most vulnerable to persecution?\n\nAlthough the Taliban has their roots in southern, eastern and northwestern Afghanistan, the entire country is ruled by a strict interpretation of Islam. This means that Christians in Afghanistan face difficulties wherever they are. The level of hostility that Christians can face from their families and communities is consistent across the country. Additionally, any Christian refugees forced to return from neighboring countries will find themselves in a significantly dangerous situation without any support network.\n\nMeet \"Yasaman\"\n\n“Some people grew suspicious of my husband’s [Christian] activities. Early one morning, as he went to buy bread, two people followed him. He was attacked and killed near our home.”\n\nYasaman, a secret believer in Afghanistan\n\nWhat has changed this year?\n\nUnfortunately, little has changed in Afghanistan. The Taliban continue to hold the country and roll back any limited freedoms gained under Afghanistan's previous governments. Many Christians fled the country during the Taliban takeover; those who remain either couldn't get out, or feel called to remain. This means there are fewer chances of fellowship than before, and the church has been driven underground even more than before. Christians—almost all of whom are converts from Islam—continue to practice their faith in secret. They know that if their faith is discovered, it will likely result in their oppression and even death. Apart from the Taliban, families and tribes harshly punish any semblance of Christian faith. In short, followers of Jesus live under constant risk.\n\nWhat does Open Doors do to help Christians in Afghanistan?\n\nOpen Doors works through partners to strengthen Christians from Afghanistan. We cannot provide details about how we support them, as the situation is too dangerous. But we can say that our brothers and sisters desperately need our prayers.\n\nHow can you pray for Afghanistan?"
