        "text": "In February 2020, the Taliban and the United States government signed the Doha Agreement in Qatar. This agreement had a significant impact on the war and political situation in Afghanistan. The Taliban carried out more attacks in various regions of Afghanistan, and in August 2021, they made astonishing advances, capturing strategic cities within weeks, and approaching Kabul. This turn of events shocked everyone, as Afghanistan, with the support of the United States and its allies, had been defending these cities and villages for twenty years. The peace negotiations, which had been ongoing for two years, were halted, and the morale of the Afghan military plummeted. President Ashraf Ghani’s escape from Kabul marked the end of the republic in Afghanistan, and the Taliban took control of the presidential palace, known as the “Arg,” without facing any resistance or violence. The occupation of the Arg — a symbol of political power in Afghanistan — by Taliban militants was a significant moment. As an expert who has been involved with academic institutions, analytical bodies, think tanks, civil society organizations, and some government structures in Afghanistan for the past twenty years, I was astonished by the events unfolding in the country.\n\nCitizens rushed into Kabul International Airport (KIA), which was the sole means of escaping the crisis. In fear of the Taliban, thousands fled toward the borders of Iran and Pakistan. Afghanistan had transformed into a horrific place, leaving everyone desperate to escape the Taliban-created hell. In particular, youths who had taken control of KIA clung to American military airplanes in their attempt to flee Afghanistan. The scenes witnessed at KIA were deemed the most disturbing in history. Tragically, four young individuals who had grasped onto a US military aircraft fell from a height of 400 meters, resulting in their bodies becoming mutilated. These were harrowing and authentic scenes portraying Afghanistan’s capture by the most terrifying terrorist group."
