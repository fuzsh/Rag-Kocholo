        "text": "Under the republic, elections were administered by the Independent Election Commission and disputes adjudicated by the Electoral Complaints Commission. Both were abolished in late 2021. Besides the March 2022 polls in Kabul, there is no provision for elections in the IEA.\n\nIn 2021, the Taliban announced that they would enforce parts of the 1964 constitution that did not contradict their interpretation of Sharia, rejecting the 2004 constitution used by the republic. In September 2022, Deputy Justice Minister Abdul Karim Haider said the country did not need a constitution, and instead need only rely on the Quran, the sunnah of the prophet Muhammad—referring to a collection of social and legal customs that informs Sharia—and Islamic jurisprudence.\n\nNo group in Afghanistan enjoys political rights or electoral opportunities. Some groups are particularly marginalized and excluded from the limited public debate that does occur.\n\nUnder the Taliban, women are excluded from any position of official authority and are additionally impacted by restrictions on their movement. A June–July 2022 assembly that included clerics and traditional leaders included no women.\n\nMost Taliban members belong to the Pashtun ethnic group, which is believed to represent 42 percent of the Afghan population. Members of that group hold top positions in powerful ministries, though non-Pashtun members of the Taliban hold less powerful posts.\n\nLGBT+ people are thoroughly excluded from political participation; the Taliban support the former republic’s criminalization of same-sex relations and reject LGBT+ rights.\n\nMedia freedom is severely restricted under the Taliban. Media outlets are subject to intrusive monitoring and guidance by multiple Taliban organs, which are reinforced through threats and violence. The Afghan media sector has also suffered from the loss of state patronage, donor funding, and private-sector revenue. Many Afghan journalists have fled for other countries in the region and have sought asylum in European countries and the United States since the republic’s fall.\n\nIn March 2022, local-language television content produced by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) was taken off the air. Output from China Global Television Network, Deutsche Welle, and Voice of America (VOA) was also banned that month.\n\nAccording to a December 2021 report released by Reporters Without Borders (RSF) and the Afghan Independent Journalists Association, 231 of the 543 outlets that operated immediately before the Taliban’s takeover closed by the end of that year. Some 6,430 media workers, meanwhile, were no longer working in the field. Women were especially affected, with 84 percent of female workers losing their jobs.\n\nSince September 2021, the IEA has introduced at least three sets of guidelines for the media, though the guidelines were not publicly shared. Among other things, these guidelines instruct outlets and journalists to show respect for Islam, desist from reporting news items considered false, refrain from publishing information the regime has not confirmed, and operate within cultural norms. Entertainment programming that is believed to violate social and cultural norms is banned. Women’s dress is also restricted under the guidelines. At least three Taliban organs have actively enforced these restrictions: the Ministry of Information and Culture, the Ministry of Vice and Virtue (MVV), and the General Directorate of Intelligence (GDI).\n\nIn practice, authorities have exercised arbitrary control over the media, well beyond what is implied by their published guidelines. Journalists have been subject to arbitrary arrest, detention, threats, and harassment, primarily from the GDI. Pressure has mainly been directed towards ensuring favorable coverage of the regime, stifling criticism, and reducing coverage of opponents and critics. Self-censorship is pervasive as a result.\n\nEstablished outlets now operate from abroad, while new outlets focused on Afghanistan have been formed outside the country since the IEA was established; all these outlets rely on social media to share their output. The Taliban have increased their own social-media activity and have warned people against accessing critical posts. Nevertheless, social media remains uncensored and accessible to Afghans.\n\nReligious freedom, which was already hampered by violence and discrimination under the republic, has been heavily curtailed by the Taliban, who vigorously assert their interpretation of the Hanafi school of Sunni Islam.\n\nDuring 2022, the MVV expanded its moral code covering dress, behavior, and religious observance. In January, the MVV placed posters in Kabul that called on women to dress according to the regime’s interpretation of Sharia. In May, the MVV ordered women to wear clothing that only exposed their eyes in public and urged them to remain at home. The MVV also intensified enforcement operations, though provincial-level directorates reportedly exercised a degree of discretion in applying the new code.\n\nGovernment organs, particularly the GDI, have systematically persecuted religious minorities. Adherents of Salafism have been especially targeted, with members facing arbitrary detention, forced disappearance, torture, and summary execution by the Taliban, who accuse them of supporting the ISKP. Christians, who are few in number, also face arrest and violence.\n\nThe regime does not persecute members of the Hazara community, most of whom identify as Shiite, as a matter of policy. However, Hazaras face persecution in practice, with individual members being targeted and houses of worship being desecrated during military operations in Hazara-majority areas. Hazara and Shiite populations were also targeted by the ISKP in 2022. The ISKP launched several attacks during the Ashura holiday in August, killing and injuring over 120 people according to UNAMA. In late September, at least 53 people were killed when a suicide bomber detonated a device in a Hazara-majority section of Kabul.\n\nNGOs are permitted to operate as long as they are registered with the Ministry of Economy. However, they are subject to multiple and intrusive checks, including to ensure that they observe regulations on women’s dress. In December 2022, the ministry told NGOs not to allow female employees to report for work and threatened to revoke the registration of NGOs for noncompliance. Several aid groups, including the Norwegian Refugee Council and Save the Children, suspended their operations as a result.\n\nAuthorities applied informal pressure to install their supporters on the boards of NGOs and pressured donors to interact with Taliban-controlled NGOs. NGOs involved in humanitarian operations faced pressure from the Taliban to prioritize their members and supporters when distributing aid. Personnel enjoyed no protection from harassment, and staff members belonging to the few human rights–focused organizations active in Afghanistan were particularly vulnerable. Human rights activists have been arrested, tortured, and killed since the Taliban returned to power, while many involved in human rights work have fled.\n\nWhile the Taliban have asserted their intention to restore security in Afghanistan after overthrowing the republic, the Afghan population remained acutely vulnerable to armed conflict and violence in 2022. The ISKP engaged in terrorist activity while the NRF continued to wage an insurgency in the north. However, the South Asia Terrorism Portal counted 1,653 terrorism-related deaths in 2022, far fewer than the 8,469 deaths reported in 2021.\n\nThe ISKP claimed responsibility for attacks that killed or injured at least 700 people since the Taliban took power, according to HRW. In one of the attacks the ISKP launched in April, it used a remote explosive device to target a Shiite mosque in Mazar-e-Sharif, killing 31 people. It also launched several attacks during the Ashura holiday in August, with UNAMA reporting that 120 were killed or injured. In September, an ISKP suicide bomber targeted the Russian embassy in Kabul, killing at least six people. In December, ISKP fighters attacked a Kabul hotel, killing several people.\n\nThe NRF continued to engage in armed resistance during the year. In affected areas, the regime has arbitrarily detained and summarily executed suspected collaborators and has engaged in collective punishment.\n\nIn June 2022, the regime launched a military operation against a short-lived uprising by one of its commanders in a Hazara-majority district of Sar-e Pul Province. The regime’s operation was accompanied by mass displacement, collective punishment, and accusations of summary executions.\n\nWhile the regime claimed it was observing an amnesty announced in 2021, military personnel who served the republic were killed or disappeared during the year, suggesting a concerted campaign against perceived enemies sanctioned by the leadership and the GDI.\n\nSince retaking power, the Taliban have instituted corporal punishment with little due process. In December 2022, the regime held its first public execution. Taliban also used violence against those perceived as dissenters or those who otherwise resisted edicts, norms, or individual demands. In November, for example, a vice-and-virtue official killed a girl in Balkh Province for refusing a marriage proposal.\n\nCriminal violence is a regular occurrence. Perpetrators frequently benefited from Taliban protection or affiliation.\n\nThe IEA operates without a unified civil or criminal code. There is no clarity on which republic-era laws still apply.\n\nWomen face profound discrimination under the Taliban. Their employment opportunities have been severely curtailed; many women have been dismissed from public-sector and media-sector jobs. Restrictions on movement also impact women’s employment prospects, with the MVV working to enforce a ban on women using mass transit unaccompanied. The regime has also restricted girls’ and women’s access to education. In March 2022, it officially closed secondary schools for girls despite previous assurances that they would be reopened; Akhundzada reportedly vetoed the reopening of those schools. In December, the regime banned female students from higher education.\n\nThe Taliban have engaged in discrimination against members of ethnic minority groups, particularly Tajiks, Hazaras, and Uzbeks.\n\nThere is no legal protection for LGBT+ people, who face societal disapproval and discrimination from the Taliban. In a 2021 interview, a Taliban judge advocated for the execution of men who engage in same-sex activity. LGBT+ people trying to flee Afghanistan face financial and administrative obstacles; gender nonconforming Afghans who spoke to HRW for a report released in January 2022 said they feared visiting passport offices and internal checkpoints."
