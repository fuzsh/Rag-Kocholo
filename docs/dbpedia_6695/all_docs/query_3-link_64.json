        "text": "Introduction\n\nLife feeds on hope (mother, age 28, Kabul)\n\nHope… is not the conviction that something will turn out well, but the certainty that something makes sense, regardless of how it turns out (Václac Havel, 1990: 181)\n\nIn war-affected areas, resilience is a critical issue for research, humanitarian policy, and public health. It is the next frontier of knowledge in the field of violence and health, an intuitively useful construct to explain why, despite significant exposure to war, individuals and families achieve emotional adjustment and social functioning, namely “good adaptation in a context of risk” (Mastern, 2006: 4), while communities and state structures withstand recurrent conflict (Betancourt & Khan, 2008; Panter-Brick, 2010; Pedersen, 2002). Despite a hefty literature on resilience in Western journals, calls have been made for rigorous and ethnographically-grounded approaches to resilience research in public health (Wexler, DiFluvio, & Burke, 2009), mental health (Almedom & Glandon, 2007), and youth-focused studies of war experiences (Barber, 2009). The need to document how people ‘make sense of’ and ‘cope with’ life events is particularly acute in conflict zones, where much of the mental health literature has focused on risk rather than resilience, and overlooked how specific cultural and ecological contexts frame individual and collective experiences of political violence (Barber, 2009; Boyden & de Berry, 2004). For example, a contrast in ‘meaning-making’ underpins psychological responses of Bosnian and Palestinian youth, the former expressing shock at the deadliness of war, the latter expressing strong ideological commitment (Barber, 2008; Punamaki, 1996). Similarly, the links between mental health and protracted war experiences are mediated by mundane aspects of social ecology, expressed in a sense of community belonging and/or marginalisation and structural impediments to emotional and/or social functioning in everyday life (Miller & Rasmussen, 2010; Panter-Brick, 2010). Clearly, a more fine-grained portrayal of how individual psychology, cultural affiliation, and societal conditions mediate the impacts of violence on wellbeing is required (Barber, 2009; Seginer, 2008).\n\nIn Afghanistan, political and military conflicts have led to massive disruptions of livelihoods, education, and networks of social support. Afghan families endure pervasive poverty, economic instability, and persistent violence (Rubin, 2006; UNDP, 2004). Since the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001, and in the context of an ongoing war, large-scale reconstruction programmes have raised expectations for socio-economic advancement, accentuated inequalities, and led to widespread frustrations with persistent social injustice (Donini, 2007). How do Afghans experience such adversity, construct hopes for the future, and make sense of everyday suffering?\n\nPrevious epidemiological surveys have documented a high prevalence of mental health problems in adults, associated with exposure to traumatic events (Cardozo et al., 2004; Scholte et al., 2004). More recent research, integrating perspectives from psychiatry and anthropology, has shown that adult and child mental health correlates not just with past experiences of conflict, but with present-day stressors such as ongoing domestic violence and inequalities in access to basic services (Miller, Omidian, Rasmussen, Yaqubi, & Daudzi, 2008; Panter-Brick, Eggerman, Mojadidi, & McDade, 2008). In previous publications, we unpacked the nature of ‘trauma’ in Afghanistan – present in multiple forms, as militarized, community-based, and family-level violence – and revealed consistent associations between child-caregiver wellbeing (Panter-Brick, Eggerman, Gonzalez, & Safdar, 2009). We also examined the embodiment of psychosocial stress and the salience of family-level stressors (Panter-Brick et al., 2008). In this paper, we examine how sources of distress and resilience are articulated in Afghan families, in light of a theoretical understanding of suffering and hope derived from the social sciences.\n\nThe anthropology of suffering is a body of work that gives voice to the physical and emotional pain of people battling with chronic poverty, social marginalisation, and routinized violence. It focuses on disruption and regulation: how ordinary social life ‘hurts’ and how this hurt becomes part of the social experience (Davis, 1992: 155). Notions of social suffering are increasingly developed within medical anthropology, social history, cross-cultural psychology, and medical sociology (Kleinman, Das, & Lock, 1997; Scheper-Hughes & Bourgois, 2003; Stein, Seedat, Iversen, & Wessely, 2007). Analyses focus on narratives of pain and loss, cultural representations and moral understandings of the world, and the embodiment of structural violence, defined as insidious social, economic, legal and political barriers that put individuals in harm’s way (Farmer, 2004). In Palestine, for instance, socio-political stressors are significant determinants of personal wellbeing, and “poverty and powerlessness are just as salient as war events in shaping experiences of trauma” (Almedom & Summerfield, 2004: 385). Notions of social suffering thus link health problems with social problems, and individual with collective experiences: in conflict settings, they place social, cultural, political, and economic matters at the forefront of public health concerns (Pedersen, 2002: 186–7).\n\nThe anthropology of hope also links wellbeing with social structures, but receives comparatively less attention. Ideologies of hope have significance for individual and collective resilience, social identity, and social dynamics across successive generations (Carbonella, 2003; Loizos, 2008; Miyazaki, 2004). Hage (2003) forcefully argued that in contexts of marked inequality, society is a mechanism not only for the distribution of social opportunities, but also for the distribution of social hope: access to resources reduces or encourages dreams of social mobility. Such hope is about “one’s sense of the possibilities that life can offer… Its enemy is a sense of entrapment, of having nowhere to go, not a sense of poverty” (p. 20). In Havel’s critical definition of the term, hope is not the illusion of a favourable outcome in the future, but “the certainty that something makes sense” (Havel, 1990: 181), a coherent narrative that explains personal and collective experiences. Arguably, this is what matters most in efforts to promote mental health, psychosocial support, and psychosocial wellbeing in war zones (Almedom & Glandon, 2007). One evidence-based review singled out ‘hope’ as one of five recommended elements for interventions addressing trauma resulting from mass violence, along with a sense of safety, calm, connectedness, and self/community-efficacy (Hobfoll et al., 2007). Thus hope is clearly identified as an important component of resilience. However, there is little critical examination of how hope is articulated in settings of collective and structural violence.\n\nUsing the framework of a school-based mental health survey (Panter-Brick et al., 2009), this paper presents a thematic analysis of narratives of adversity, suffering, and resilience in Afghanistan. We analyse how constructs of suffering and hope frame cultural understandings of life experiences, in response to everyday stressors and professed solutions. We also critically examine why and how culture matters in shaping experiences of distress and resilience, in generating both a sense of coherence and a sense of entrapment. Two original aspects of this work were to draw a systematic random sample of participants for in-depth interviews, thus transcending many limitations of purely qualitative work, and to provide a cross-generational perspective, through statements from both children and adults.\n\nCultural values and social hope\n\nThe only way to make life better is to be hopeful. If a person has hope, then he or she can work and acquire knowledge to make their life better. Caregiver (mother, age 49).\n\nThematic analyses revealed six key cultural values in responses to the open-ended question about how “life could be better” ( : Q5). They underpin a discourse which counterbalances narratives of suffering and despair ( ).\n\nFaith [iman: ]\n\nStrong religious conviction- iman – was clearly a source of individual strength in the face of misfortune, and one which crossed generations. A 43-year-old tenant farmer, supporting a household of ten, expressed the centrality of this in verse:\n\nBetter a poor servant of God than a rich man without iman\n\nA life without serving God is a shameful and uncertain one.\n\nIman was articulated in expressions of resignation – an acceptance that life was determined by God and, ultimately, beyond individual control; as one 63-year-old schoolteacher stated, “maybe it is our destiny to never own a home.” Adults often rounded off statements of powerlessness with the phrase “God is kind” [khodawand mehraban ast], elaborating that “only God knows when He will give me a comfortable life.” Expressions such as “it is up to God to decide” and “I can’t do anything except be patient with God and wait for Him to help” were typical across generations. Thus one 65-year-old father explained that “humans don’t have any option but to accept God’s will… there isn’t any way to improve our lives aside from having iman,” quickly followed by “I hope that God will solve my debt problems.” An 11-year-old girl felt that “if God wants our life to be better, it will get better… if not, it won’t.”\n\nIman was a central component of an imagined future, one which depended upon the beneficence of God, who would reward those who demonstrated iman, and punish those who did not. As a 14-year-old boy who worked after school in a grocery store put it: awwal khoda, duom paisa [first God, then money]. Similarly, a 22-year-old male stated: “It is up to God. We simply try our best and don’t do any bad things, like robbery or gambling or opium,” while iman was the foundation of hope for a 35-year-old woman, who stated: “Only God solves our problems… I want to have a strong iman. I want God to give me a son.”\n\nFamily unity and harmony [wahdat: and ittifaq: ]\n\nFamily unity and harmony were articulated as the ability to achieve consensus in decision-making, peacefully resolve disputes, and share a household without conflict. The importance of these values across generations is clear in the following statements:\n\nI’m living in peace with all my brothers. As long as there is ittifaq between us everything’s fine, but when there is no ittifaq, then nothing is good. Caregiver (grandfather, age 73).\n\nMy father is tormenting my mother and my sisters. There used to be twelve of us at home, but my brothers and sisters left because of my father… I kept praying to God to kill my father… I want God to change my father’s nature and give my family wahdat. Student (girl, age 16).\n\nSuccessful economic activity depended upon maintaining co-operative family relationships across generations. Strong wahdat and ittifaq maximised employment opportunities and access to credit, effective decision-making regarding the allocation of wealth and property, and arranged marriages. Loss of family unity and harmony had profound consequences for material and psychosocial wellbeing:\n\nA few months ago we had a fight with our uncle’s family. It was just a verbal quarrel, but it upset my family. The story is that we came back from Iran with my uncle’s family and we bought some land together. We built a house on it, but after we’d lived in the house for a year my uncle kicked us out. This really upset me. I can’t forget his mistreatment of us. Caregiver (sister, age 20).\n\nService [khidmat: ]\n\nThe value of ‘service’ lay at the core of future aspirations. Students wanted to complete an education and acquire a job in order to “serve” their parents, family, and community, as in “I want to get a higher education and serve my people” or “I want to be a doctor and serve the country.” The term was deployed by adults when voicing expectations for children:\n\nI want my children to grow up, and my daughters to get married. I hope God keeps my children on the path of the righteous. I want them to have good health and serve their father and mother. Caregiver (mother, age 42).\n\nService to family meant fulfilling obligations to contribute to the household economy, obedience to parents, and a duty to eventually support them. As one 15-year-old boy plainly stated: “We expect our parents to provide us with the things we need, and they expect us to serve them.” Failure to “serve” was a source of shame, and a flaw in character; for example, a 40-year-old mother expressed disappointment with her two married sons because “they don’t help me, or serve me and my children.”\n\nPerseverance and effort [koshesh: ]\n\nRespondents referred to koshesh when asked to describe how they might overcome particular stressors – finding a steady job, or balancing the demands of work and school. Statements such as “work and koshesh can make our life better” or “education and koshesh will improve our lives” were typical from children, while adults echoed this with phrases such as “our life can only get better through hard work and koshesh.” Koshesh was also embedded in wider economic and social aspirations, cascading across generations:\n\nI want Allah to cherish my 10-year-old son and give him a high-ranking position to solve our problems. My son should study and work hard to make our life better after his graduation from school… if my children get high-ranking positions this will change my life… I pray to Allah to solve our problems, to improve our economic position, to give us a house of our own. Caregiver (mother, age 45)\n\nThere were many such testimonies to the value of koshesh in fighting both war-related and economic adversity. For example, one 39-year-old farm labourer, who experienced shelling, house-burnings, and the execution of neighbours and relatives during the Taliban period, stated that “God is powerful – if there is more rain, and I can rent more land next year, I will work hard, and our problems will be solved.” Similarly, a 16-year-old boy, who wove carpets from 4am until noon, attended school during the afternoon, and returned to his loom afterwards, stated that the solution to his family’s “broken economy” was that he had to “work harder and not take as much time to rest.”\n\nMorals [akhlaq: ]\n\nMorals referred to all codes governing appropriate behaviour – deference to one’s parents and community elders, modesty in dress and comportment, and good manners in day-to-day relationships. Along with education, akhlaq was essential for a successful future. Statements from children such as “education, training, and having good morals can help you progress in the future” were typical in this area, and dovetailed with parent’s often-expressed desire that children would have “good morals and strong faith” in order to “uphold the honour and respect of their family.”\n\nTo have “good akhlaq” was also a marker of worthiness and character, while the loss of akhlaq was identified as a consequence of economic hardship and domestic conflict. As a 40-year-old mother stated: “We have a bad economic situation, and this has ruined our akhlaq. My husband is a good person, but when it comes to money, he gets emotional and fights.”\n\nSocial prominence, respectability, and honour [‘izzat: ]\n\nUltimately, adherence to cultural values was a path to respect and social recognition. Parents often wanted their children to be mashour – literally, “famous” or “prominent” – meaning that they wanted them to be upstanding, respectable members of their community, who exhibited iman and akhlaq, and worked hard to “serve the people.” Children expressed this ambition in statements such as “I want to fulfil my parents’ wishes for me to be mashour in the future,” or “I want to be a good Muslim and an important person in my community.” Social position was also key in the choice of marriage partners; as a female 20-year-old stated, “I can bring changes to my life by having good morals, good behaviour, and a good job. I want to marry someone with a good character who is also mashour.”\n\nThe desire for social respectability was closely tied to the deeply-rooted need to maintain personal and family honour. By fulfilling their parent’s ambitions for them, by working hard, demonstrating good morals, and serving others, children would maintain this. Children expressed anxiety about not doing well in school because they “would have to be ashamed” in front of their relatives. Similarly, a 40-year-old mother was distressed by her husband’s objections to a marriage she had arranged for her son, saying “if I don’t marry him with my niece, everyone will think I am a bad person.” This cultural imperative is also evident in a statement from a woman whose husband repeatedly abused her:\n\nLast year my husband kicked me out of our house. I spent a month at my father’s home without my children. Now every day he’s telling me to go away, that he doesn’t need me around any more. But I suffer all these tortures because of my children and my father’s honour [‘izzat].\n\nDiscussion\n\nOur data speak to three dimensions of everyday life in Afghanistan. They present poignant testimonies of everyday adversity and cross-generational suffering. They demonstrate that hope and fortitude is founded on the expression of fundamental cultural values that give order and promise to life. They reveal sources of entrapment, as families struggle to adhere to their values in the face of pronounced structural inequalities injurious to well-being. These three dimensions address key issues in the current literature on social suffering and resilience in conflict-affected areas, as discussed below.\n\nIn contemporary Afghanistan, material poverty lies at the root of social suffering, and drives a multi-faceted discourse around it. The “broken economy” [iqtisad kharab] is the root of all miseries, a struggle that goes well beyond the lack of food, clothing, and adequate shelter. Economic insecurity produces complex tensions within families: it is a central driver of psychological distress, physical pain, domestic violence, and community conflicts. It is also a key impediment to the achievement of social and cultural ambitions. Afghans articulate mental and physical ill-health as both a cause and a result of material poverty, as poverty morphs into multiple experiences of suffering, both individual and collective. This exemplifies what Kleinman called the violences of everyday life – present in multiple and insidious forms, at the level of personal experiences, cultural norms, and routine social coercion (Kleinman, 2000: 238). Drawing from both child and adult narratives, our data exemplify how local understandings of well-being are more closely tied to everyday experiences of structural violence than to past experiences of war, and how everyday suffering cascades from one generation to the next, the result of close interdependence between family members and shared experiences of adversity.\n\nResilience and fortitude rest upon a sense of hope: the belief that adversity can ultimately be overcome and a process of ‘meaning-making’ that gives coherence to past, present, and future experiences. In Afghanistan, the bedrock of this hope is the production and maintenance of a set of long-lived cultural values. Strong religious faith [iman] and individual effort [koshesh] are values that structure a discourse of resilience in the face of adversity, often through acceptance of “the will of God” and a hope that everyday perseverance will be rewarded with His “mercy” and “protection.” Strong relationships between hardship, faith, and endurance, tinged with fatalism regarding matters of health and socio-economic success, were also highlighted by Canfield (1975: 483) among famine-stricken Hazara communities in the 1970s. While hope, fatalism, and perseverance are complex facets of religious discourse, our data indicate that professions of powerlessness do not equate to a sense of hopelessness and a loss of faith. Thus 40% of our respondents saw ‘no solution’ to key life stressors, but went on to express statements of religious conviction and fortitude. Three other constructs – service, morality, and family unity [khidmat; akhlaq; wahdat] – complement iman and koshesh to give order and meaning to personal experience and social relationships: these values underpin honour [‘izzat] and respectability, key to social functioning and individual dignity, and core psychosocial dimensions of resilience.\n\nBy and large, Afghan families suffer great material poverty, but not a poverty of aspirations: on the contrary, hard work and education are seen as the gateway to economic security and social respectability. Our data make clear that Afghan children internalise the importance of scholastic success, of service to elders, and conformity to cultural codes governing morality. This resonates with the emphasis placed on tarbia [lit: training, upbringing] in a seminal qualitative study of Afghan families in Kabul (De Berry et al., 2003). As in other war-affected settings, a large component of resilience against the ‘hurt’ of social disadvantage comes from a determination to adhere to cultural values and life goals focused on seeing children well-educated and well-married (Loizos, 2008). Among Afghans, social hope cascades across generations, spurred on by promises of international assistance, reconstruction, and education.\n\nCultural values, however, are sources of entrapment as well as resilience, given the structural impediments to their realisation: poverty, ineffective governance, social injustice, and ongoing militarized conflict. At an individual and family level, strain arises due to an incompatibility between the desire to maintain personal or collective values and the bald economic demands of survival. Structural constraints place huge impediments on children’s ability to succeed in school and study at home, leading to frustration and disappointment. For many young people, ‘service’ to family will involve interrupting further education and sacrificing personal ambition, as poverty and cultural dictates compel adolescent sons to work and daughters to be married. The inability to fulfil one’s social obligations and to realise personal aspirations are twin facets of entrapment – broken dreams generated by the broken economy. Paradoxically, the ability to demonstrate adherence to cultural values may reproduce inherent social injustices, perpetuated for women by the dominance of men in politics, economics, and social relations, and for youth by the power of elders in decision-making.\n\nIn this sense, culture is not just an anchor of resilience, but also an anvil of pain. On one hand, the profession and maintenance of cultural values is central to the construction of social identity, order, and hope. On the other, inability to conform to cultural dictates is source of great psychosocial distress. Failure or frustration in attaining social and cultural milestones lies at the root of social suffering and mental ill-health, as articulated in local idioms of stress, anxiety, and depression, or conflicts that are debilitating and life-threatening. Culture becomes a double-edge sword, as argued for religion by Wessells and Strang (2006: 200), in being both a source of violence as well as a resource for social functioning. Our data show the frustration and loss of self-worth experienced by Afghan men unable to provide adequate support for their families. Women and children report this as a serious driver of strain and violence in the family. Similar observations linking shame, frustration, and violence were made by Mollica (2006: 173) when describing Cambodian refugee experiences: jobless fathers were “humiliated in the eyes of their children, their neighbours, and themselves,” felt “castrated and impotent,” while wives “become enraged at a husband who cannot support the family.”\n\nSome sense of the strength and durability of Afghan cultural values, and their role in the production of inequity and social tensions, can be found in Tapper’s work (Tapper, 1991) in a northern Afghan community in the 1970s. Highlighting the central role played by honour in all decision-making regarding resource allocation – labour, land, women, debt, and credit relations – Tapper described “the real inequality in such a system as a spiral whereby the weak lose control of resources of all kinds, lose honour, and become weaker still, while the strong gain control of resources, gain honour, and become stronger (p. 299).” She linked women’s jinn-possession to a form of “social rebellion” (p. 217), but revealed that those in socially weak positions would be dismissed as faking insanity or possession. Similarly, Dupree (1980) observed that in Afghanistan women “sometimes crack under the strain of combined boredom, frustration, and mistreatment” (p.125) and that mental health problems among men and women arose from frustrated cultural expectations (p. 190). In our study, Afghan narratives embody both the dramatic violence of war, specifically, grief [jighar khun] related to war trauma, and the structural violence of poverty and marginalisation, such as irritability, agitation/lethargy, and anxiety [takleef asabi, fishar payin/bala, tashwish] arising from everyday economic and social stressors.\n\nCultural affiliation, ideological commitment, and networks of social support are usually understood as protective to youth and adults in conflict zones (Seginer, 2008; Wexler et al., 2009). In particular, culture and religion provide strength and solace in environments where military and civil institutions fail to provide social justice (Aggarwal, 2007). Pursuing this line of argument, mental health intervention programmes in conflict zones are currently urged to build upon community contexts and cultural norms to enhance the relevance and effectiveness of psychosocial support (Betancourt & Khan, 2008: 323; IASC, 2007). In Afghanistan, community psychosocial support interventions are burgeoning (De Berry, 2004) on the back of large-scale investment in public health and education. However, given that crises are chronic and governance has little “clarity of purpose,” the family has proven to be the only stable institution available (Dupree, 2004). Certainly, culture ‘matters’ to resilience in war-affected areas: our data demonstrate both how cultural values work – creating meaning and imparting moral and social order – and why they work – generating hope to overcome social suffering and everyday violence. Yet in the absence of a functioning economy and equitable access to basic resources, efforts to promote cultural values can entrap those in a position of vulnerability and powerlessness, while efforts to promote child education arguably raise hope and expectations to the point of illusion and assured frustration.\n\nOur study gives qualitative depth to epidemiological studies demonstrating the impact of daily stressors on stress and mental health in conflict zones (Miller et al., 2008; Miller & Rasmussen, 2010; Panter-Brick et al., 2008) and the associations found between child-caregiver wellbeing (Panter-Brick et al., 2009). In its focus on hope, it also addresses the complex issue of how to promote social cohesion in a society devastated by suffering and loss (Pedersen, Tremblay, Errázuriz, & Gamarra, 2008: 214). With specific reference to resilience, our findings resonate with work arguing for the need to identify, through detailed ethnographic work, what social policies will improve living conditions, what counts as success in the eyes of marginalised groups (Canvin, Martilla, Burstrom, & Whitehead, 2009), and “what really matters” in living a dignified and moral life amidst uncertainty and danger (Kleinman, 2009). In social policy and public health, arguments that a ‘spiral of disadvantage’ engulfs poor families and that social inequality is injurious to wellbeing are now well-established (WHO, 2008). In conflict zones, these issues need fleshing out with both qualitative and quantitative work, to understand how resilience is specifically constructed in contexts of violence, economic deprivation, and social oppression (Panter-Brick, 2010). Our data indicate that interventions focusing on everyday social ecology – strengthening family and wider social networks – need to go hand in hand with interventions focusing on everyday material ecology – altering daily economic stressors that are the nexus of social suffering. They also indicate that the quality of education provision must be improved to further goals of social justice and psychosocial wellbeing in the lives of a new generation.\n\nThis touches on the ethics of hope, a critique of post-Taliban reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan akin to Hage’s trenchant critique of global capitalism. In a context of widening social inequalities, maldistribution of capital, and inequitable state policies, people suffer from a shrinking configuration of hope, a sense of entrapment in ‘going nowhere’ in terms of existential and social mobility (Hage, 2003: 12–21). The programme of massive refugee repatriation (Turton & Marsden, 2002) and the ‘Back to School’ campaign in Afghanistan (Hunte, 2006) are two examples of hope-building policies that have raised expectations without sufficient follow-through to create lasting socio-economic opportunities and mitigate deep-set inequalities. In this study, Afghans articulated a forceful, policy-relevant message: there is no health without mental health, no mental health without family unity, no family unity without work, dignity, and a functioning economy, and no functioning economy without good governance. More ethical and realistic policy goals (UNDP, 2004: 196) would need to address the everyday priorities of ordinary Afghans, who underscore the structural violence of poverty rather than the dramatic violence of war, and the importance of maintaining personal and social dignity as the key to a hopeful future."
