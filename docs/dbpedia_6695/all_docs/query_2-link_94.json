        "text": "The international community has seen the scope of the Taliban’s brutal rule since the group took power in August 2021. In the years since, Afghanistan has at least had some level of political stability – but that stability has extended to crushing pressure and violence against minority groups.\n\nAs far as the Taliban are concerned, there are no Christians in Afghanistan. Most house churches that existed before the Taliban (even if they had to be hidden) have been closed, as believers were forced to flee or go even further underground.\n\nIf an Afghan’s Christian faith is discovered, it can be a death sentence, or they can be detained and tortured into giving information about fellow believers. The surrounding society and family structure has no space for religious freedom, and the government upholds this rigid stance. This means Christians – almost all of whom are converts from Islam – must keep their faith secret, or they may simply disappear."
