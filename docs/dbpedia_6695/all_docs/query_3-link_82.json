        "text": "Civilization begins with order, grows with liberty\n\nand dies with chaos.\n\n Will Durant\n\nGayle Mertz\n\nThis lesson plan was first published, in a slightly different version, in January 2001 as part of a collection, Conflict in Context: Understanding Local to Global Security.1\n\nI have expanded and updated it to keep in step with recent events since the tragedies of September 11. The point of the lesson is to provide students with some background on the civil war in Afghanistan as well as a foundation for further study of the dynamics of civil wars occurring throughout the world today. By focusing on the specific case of Afghanistan, students can become familiar with the complexities of civil war in general, learning how civil strife can be affected by many factors. Students can use research skills to analyze factors that contribute to ongoing conflicts in Afghanistan, the Middle East, and elsewhere in the world.\n\nThe lesson, for secondary students, takes at least two class periods, but teachers should adjust the length of the lesson to the ability of their students. If the lesson is extended with discussions of current events or outside research, it could easily take a week. Class materials are the handouts in this article. Students can do further research with the use of the Internet, books and magazines at a library, and (for current events) daily newspapers. At the conclusion of this lesson, students will have met these learning outcomes:\n\n Practiced reading for understanding.\n\n Learned about the basic geography, history, culture, and politics of Afghanistan.\n\n Learned about the effects of the Afghan civil war on civilians, the infrastructure of that country, and the international community.\n\n Considered factors that contribute to civil wars in different times and places.\n\n Analyzed data and shared new information with classmates.\n\nLesson Sequence\n\nExplain to students that they will be looking at the civil war in Afghanistan as an introduction to the study of civil war in general. Ask students to define civil war (a basic definition is a war between opposing groups of citizens of the same country) and to identify civil wars (past or present) that they have learned about. Brainstorm reasons why citizens might enter into combat with one another.\n\nAssemble groups of eight students. Distribute copies of Handouts A-D to everybody. Each student should choose one handout to specialize in, coordinating with other members of the group so that all topics are covered. Students can begin reading the handouts, finishing them for homework. Explain the next days activity to them so they will be prepared.\n\nThe next day, have students discuss among themselves what they have read, each student taking responsibility for his or her chosen handout. (Research shows that people retain information better if they have explained it to another person). Write guidelines for these discussions on the board:\n\n Work together;\n\n Review the countries bordering Afghanistan and identify major landmarks in Afghanistan;\n\n Review the names of ethnic groups and significant events in Afghan history;\n\n Practice defining Afghan and Arabic terms and names.\n\nAfter a twenty-minute discussion, ask the class for questions or comments. (Complex questions that arise might serve as topics for further research.) Then distribute Handout E. Within\n\neach group of eight students, students should now pair up and select one of these four ethnic groups to report on, using all of the handouts as their source of information: Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazaras, and Uzbeks. Pairs from different student groups may work together if they are researching the same ethnic group, to answer these questions:\n\n Which political or military faction in the Afghan civil war seems to derive support from this ethnic group?\n\n What outside nation or political party might be supporting or supplying this faction?\n\n Are most members of the ethnic group Muslim? If so, to which denomination of Islam do they belong?\n\nStudents should be prepared to discuss these questions with their original groups the next day. Tell the class that Handout E is crucial for answering these questions, but that all of the handouts contain relevant information. Each student should give a brief report to his or her group on what he or she has learned about the ethnic group.\n\nFurther Research\n\nAs an extension activity, students could do further research, in a library or on the Internet, to answer these questions:\n\n How would someone identify members of this ethnic group? That is, in what ways are members of this group different from other populations residing in Afghanistan?\n\n With what other group does this group have the greatest conflict? What is the conflict based on?\n\n How has this group contributed to, or defended itself during, the civil war?\n\n How has the civil war influenced civilian members of this group?\n\n What effect has the September 11, 2001, attack on the United States, and the subsequent U.S. bombing in Afghanistan, had on this group?\n\nAlert students to the fact that many newspapers, magazines, and humanitarian organizations have recently produced brief reports and background information about the civil war in Afghanistan (see Selected Resources). In reporting back to the class, students should discuss how an ethnic group may have contributed to the civil war and how each has been affected by it. They might also discuss current events in Afghanistan as they relate to their assigned ethnic group. Students should be encouraged to identify trends, similarities, or dissimilarities, and not simply report data. The purpose of this discussion is to help students become familiar with the diversity and complexity of issues and positions that have contributed to the creation, escalation, and continuation of the civil war and recent international hostilities.\n\nOther Civil Wars\n\nIn more than thirty nations today, there is civil strife that is at or near the point of bloodshed.2 To learn more about civil war as a phenomenon, students could choose one of these research topics:\n\n Compare and contrast the role that tribalism, religion, and/or nationalism have played in the civil conflict in two different nations.\n\n What would you, as a peacekeeper, suggest to put an end to the civil war in Afghanistan or another nation that you investigate?\n\n Research several different civil wars, focusing on a specific factor contributing to war (such as foreign aid or intervention, or religion) or a topic related to it (such as the experience of women and children in the conflict). What similarities or differences stand out when you compare civil wars that occurred in different times and places?\n\n Role play conflict resolution sessions where students try to reach (even a minor) agreement between parties in a conflict related to civil war.3\n\n Investigate the work of international courts in helping to hold human rights abusers accountable, and assess their success or lack of success in the last two years.

It is traversed east to west by the Hindu Kush Mountains, which rise to heights of 24,000 feet. Valleys between the mountains, and plains in the north and southwest, hold the scarce topsoil that can be farmed (only 12 percent of the land is arable). The fabled Silk Road, linking India and the Far East with Europe, passed through valleys and mountain gaps, making Afghanistan a hotspot for the transport of goods (both legitimate trade and smuggling) and international intrigue. The climate is dry, winters are cold, and summers are hot. The nation is landlocked, surrounded by six countries: Pakistan, Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and China.\n\nPeople and Culture\n\nThe population is about 26 million. Over 3 million Afghan refugees now live in bordering nations such as Iran and Pakistan.\n\nThere are three main ethnic groups (Pashtuns are 38 percent of the population, Tajiks 25 percent, and Hazaras 19 percent). Uzbeks make up 6 percent, while other minorities (Aimaks, Turkmen, Baluchis, and others) make up 12 percent. These groups arise from independent, nomadic tribes. More than twenty separate languages are spoken; the major ones are Afghan Persian or Dari (spoken by 50 percent of the population), Pashtu (35 percent), and Turkic dialects, such as Uzbek and Turkmen (11 percent). The Pashtun group has traditionally provided the countrys top leadership, but the elites of other groups have been involved in the nations administration.\n\nIslam is the religion observed by 99 percent of the population (Sunni Muslims comprise 84 percent, Shiite Muslims 15 percent). Traditionally, Islamic culture was a unifying force, providing a common bond among the many different ethnic groups. The Koran, the holy book of Islam, has long been the basis of not just religious practices, but also cultural and political norms.\n\nSeveral statistics tell the story of poverty in Afghanistan today. Nearly half the population is under 15 years old. The average life expectancy is only about 45 years. Adult illiteracy is 69 percent for men and 84 percent for women. Less than one-quarter of all young women attend primary or secondary school. Infant mortality is 151 deaths for every 1,000 live births (in the United States, the ratio is 7: 1,000). There is one telephone, on average, for every 1,000 inhabitants.\n\nBrief History\n\nThe kingdoms and oases of Afghanistan were major stops along the Silk Road during Europes Middle Ages. Empire-builders have desired control over the mountain passes (such as the famous Khyber Pass) that allowed travel from India (and thus from all of the Far East) to the Middle East (and thus to all of Europe). For example, the British Empires covert struggle against Russian influence in Afghanistan in the 1800s was immortalized in the works of British author Rudyard Kipling (author of The Jungle Book).\n\nHistorically, the Afghan tribes have not taken kindly to invaders or would-be rulers. For example, the army of Alexander the Great was almost destroyed in the mountains in 329 B.C. Genghis Khan conquered the region in 1219 A.D., but could not hold onto it. The British stormed Kabul and set up a puppet ruler in 1839, but two years later their 16,000 soldiers were slaughtered in retreat, except for one wounded survivor.\n\nIn 1747, a Pashtun tribal leader, Ahmad Shah Abdali, was chosen by tribal chiefs to be ruler. He is widely considered to be the father of the Afghan nation. Pashtun clans provided leadership for this loose confederation of tribes for the next two hundred years. A leftist coup in 1973 established Afghanistan as a republic. The deposed King Zahir Shah fled to Rome, where he lives in exile today. The coup initiated a cascade of political splintering. Just five years later, in 1978, Marxists in the Afghan army staged another coup, but the group split into factions that fought among one another, while also battling anticommunist, Islamic opponents. The civil war had begun.\n\nIn 1979, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in an attempt to end the chaos and establish a stable communist regime. Initially, Afghans resisting the invasion were armed with outdated weapons. Soon the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) of the United States began providing, with the help of Pakistan, funds, weapons, and training to Afghan Mujahideen resistance fighters. This support was part of the U.S. Cold War strategy against the communist Soviet Union at the time, but it made leaders out of warriors who believed their battle against communism was part of a great Muslim cause. The Mujahideen included boys as young as ten.\n\nCivil War\n\nThe desire for freedom from Soviet rule brought many local quarrels to a halt as leaders of various ethnic groups combined forces to defeat the Soviet infidels. Soviet soldiers were easy targets for guerrillas armed with U.S. lightweight missiles and modern guns and familiar with the rugged mountains. By 1988, the Soviets realized that they were in a no-win situation and signed an accord with the United States and Pakistan to end the war. The communist regime, led by President Najibullah, lasted until 1992, when Mujahideen took over the city, forcing the president to take shelter in a U.N. compound.\n\nAmazingly, Afghan foot soldiers had defeated a world superpower, but their country lay in ruins, with 1.5 million dead, 6 million refugees, cities and water supplies wrecked, and the countryside strewn with as many as 15 million active landmines. Significant foreign aid was never forthcoming, from the United States or elsewhere. The various groups that had coalesced to fight against the Soviets immediately began fighting one another for control of the country. The resulting civil war, which continues into the present, brought further ruin to a people already exhausted by war. Factional fighting reduced much of the capital to rubble.\n\nThe Taliban\n\nIn 1994, in the refugee camps of Pakistan and southern Afghanistan, a group of graduates of Islamic schools (madrassahs) founded the Taliban. These young men, mostly ethnic Pashtuns, were dismayed by the ongoing chaos in their homeland. The Taliban seized control of the capital city of Kabul in 1996, executed former President Najibullah, and ousted President Burhanuddin Rabbani. Although the Taliban declared themselves the legitimate government of Afghanistan, only three other nations granted such recognition.\n\nThis event quickly realigned political forces within the region. The anti-Taliban United Front is a loose coalition of political and ethnic groups, held together primarily by their dislike of the Taliban and fear of Pashtun rule. It is headed by the ousted president Burhanuddin Rabbani (who is an ethnic Tajik) and other non-Pashtun political leaders and generals.\n\nInitially, the Taliban were popular because they disarmed petty regional warlords who exploited and abused civilians. But the Taliban, under the leadership of mullah (religious leader) Mohammad Omar, soon imposed harsh laws based on their fundamentalist interpretation of Koranic law. Women are forbidden to attend school, earn a salary, or show their faces in public. Men must grow beards. The depiction of living things (photographs, stuffed animals, statues) is forbidden. Punishments include severing a hand for theft and stoning for adultery. Taliban training camps provide volunteers for the continued fighting in Afghanistan and, allegedly, for acts of terror abroad.\n\nBy late 1998, the Taliban controlled 90 percent of the country. Approximately 3.7 million Afghan citizens who fled the civil war are reluctant to return to a war-ravaged nation ruled by a repressive fundamentalist regime. There are over 2 million refugees in Pakistan, 1.5 million in Iran, and about 10,000 camped at the border of Tajikistan.\n\nIn July 2001, Human Rights Watch released a report on human rights abuses in Afghanistan, Crisis of Impunity, to the United Nations (UN). The report stated:\n\nIn the war, all major factions have repeatedly committed serious violations of international law, including killings, indiscriminate aerial bombardment and shelling, direct attacks on civilians, summary executions, rape, persecution on the basis of religion, and the use of antipersonnel landmines. Most of the recent violations, especially summary executions and indiscriminate aerial bombardment, have been by the Taliban, while the United Front has failed to hold its commanders accountable for past abuses.1\n\nThe report asks the UN to impose sanctions on Pakistan, Iran, and Russia in an effort to stem their practices of providing military support to warring factions.\n\nIn October 2001, as the United States began bombing Taliban strongholds in Afghanistan as part of its war on terrorism, even more Afghan civilians, tens of thousands, are deciding that they too want to leave the country, only to find that the borders are closed. Many of these people have no food or shelter. The United Front, which is supported by the United States, prepared for a possible assault against the Taliban. It is not clear how the Afghan people will fare in, or the rest of the world will respond to, this next chapter in the tragic recent history of Afghanistan.\n\nNote\n\n1.
