        "text": "The religious texts of the Zoroastrian faith of ancient Persia are referred to as the âAvesta.â The oldest part is the Gathas, which includes a collection of hymns and one of the oldest examples of religious poetry attributed to the prophet Zoroaster (ca. 630â550 BCE). Displayed is a page from the Gathas, in the Middle Persian language Pahlavi, and its translation into modern Persian. The Faravahar, a man and a winged disc that symbolizes the Zoroastrian faith adorns the opening of the page. The Zoroastrian faith has survived from ancient times with followers worldwide, mainly in Iran and India. The Zoroastrians who settled in India more than one thousand years ago, referred to as the Parsi (Persian) community, are very influential in Indian society today.\n\nThis unique illuminated book of psalms, alternating between Hebrew and Persian, is a modern work produced in Tehran to highlight the importance and value given in Iran to all Abrahamic faith traditions. The Persian translation written in the Nastaâliq calligraphic style makes the Jewish holy book accessible to Persian speakers and celebrates the historic presence of Jewish religious communities in Iran. Persian Jews have been in the region since antiquity and along with the Zoroastrians constitute the most ancient faith communities that remain in Persian lands.\n\nA number of Christian communities, particularly Armenian and Syriac, maintained a strong presence in Persian lands. The Syriac or Aramaic-speaking people in western Persia constitute one of the oldest Christian communities of Persia and are referred to as the âAssyrians.â The language used for communication and liturgical writings is modern Aramaic. This rare Assyrian Christian gospel contains the first four books of the New Testament and is from the Urmia region of Iran.\n\nOver the centuries, production of QurÊ¼Än manuscripts with elaborate calligraphic and decorative motifs has evolved into a high art. Historically in Persian-speaking lands the Naskh calligraphic style was used for the Arabic QurÊ¼Än text. Since the Il-Khanid dynasty (1256â1335), a tradition of interlinear QurÊ¼Än, in which the original Arabic text, usually in Naskh, is followed in a smaller size font in Persian in the Nastaâliq calligraphic style, has also flourished.\n\nPrayer is at the foundation of the Islamic faith. The Libraryâs Near East Section manuscript collections include handwritten, illuminated prayer books and booklets and manuals featuring various prayers for different occasions. The morning prayers that set the tone for the day are highlighted in the seventeenth-century manuscript on display, which is illuminated and bound in embossed red leather. The Arabic text of the prayers is written in a very clear and bold Nastaâliq calligraphic style.\n\nIran, Azerbaijan, and Iraq today are predominantly followers of the Shi`ite branch of Islamic faith. In Afghanistan, Tajikistan, and Central Asia, where the Sunni branch of Islam dominates the religious Persian-language works reflect the Sunni school of Islamic thought. This lithographic book was published in the nineteenth century by the Royal Kabul Publishing House and is a source for judges who work on Islamic jurisprudence. The fine quality of the printing and binding attest to the importance given to Islamic law texts.\n\nSufism, a mystical and introspective interpretation of Islam that emerged after the initial spread of the religion, combines Islamic teachings with Gnosticism. The practice embraced the idea of enlightenment through spiritual knowledge, with pre-Islamic Greek, Zoroastrian, and Indian spiritual practices. By the thirteenth century in Persia, Sufi thought was expressed primarily through poetry or in poetic works of prose such as this Sufi treatise. The fine illuminated manuscript pages with animal and floral motifs and the highly prized Nastaâliq calligraphy style of the manuscript demonstrate the importance of spiritual and philosophical works in medieval Persia.\n\nAt the request of Muhammad Taqi MirzÄ, the son of Qajar dynasty monarch Fath âAli-ShÄh, the author compiled this ethical-philosophical treatise drawing on Sufi mysticism and Shi`ite doctrine. In three long chapters, the book presents a detailed discussion of reason (Arabic/Persian âaql) and its qualities. Numerous images illustrate the authorâs argument concerning different spheres in which reason reigns in differing qualities. This book is noteworthy as a rare example of printing in gold.\n\nAmong the rare Persian manuscripts in the Libraryâs holdings are a number of unique Shi`ite Iranian prayer books that are ornately illuminated with floral motifs and gold ink. One such manuscript is this Persian and Arabic prayer book, which includes prayers intended to be read on pilgrimage to various Shi`ite holy sites in Iraq and Iran. Specific prayers read at the mausoleum of âAlÄ« ibn AbÄ« á¹¬Älib, the son-in-law of the prophet Muhammad and the fourth caliph of Islam, are highlighted. The author Ibn Rustam KhÄn á¹¢afÄ« QulÄ« evokes his Safavid ancestors under whose reign (1501â1722) Iran became predominately Shi`ite.\n\nOne of the most revered religious and holy figures of Islam is âAlÄ« ibn AbÄ« á¹¬Älib (ca. 601â661), whose honorary name, AmÄ«r al-MuâminÄ«n, translates into Persian as the âprince of the believers.â Written works by âAlÄ« ibn AbÄ« á¹¬Älib and sayings attributed to him are sacred to the Shi`ite faithful, particularly among Persian-speakers. This hand-written prayer manual displays the words of âAlÄ« ibn AbÄ« á¹¬Älib in the original Arabic in the Naskh calligraphic style and in a smaller-font Persian translation in red in the Nastaâliq calligraphic style by AbÅ« al-QÄsim ShÄ«rÄzÄ«.\n\nThe Babi religious and social movement, which had its origins in Shi`ite Islam, began in the mid-nineteenth century, and, after a number of upheavals, evolved into the Bahaâi faith based on the teaching of MÃ­rzÃ¡ á¸¤usayn-`AlÃ­ NÃºrÃ­ (1817â1892), better known as BahÃ¡âuâllÃ¡h to his followers. He authored a number of religious and theological works in Persian and Arabic. Because of political turbulence in Iran, many Bahaâis moved to neighboring lands and spread out across the world. This book, published in Europe, is a modern Persian publication of BahÃ¡âuâllÃ¡hâs teachings to be studied with morning and evening prayers."
