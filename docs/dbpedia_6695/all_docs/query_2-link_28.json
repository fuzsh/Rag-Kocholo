        "text": "The collapse of the government in Kabul in Afghanistan, and also the anniversaries of the attacks of 9/11 which were launched from within that nation, have been very much in the public mind in the past weeks. In light of these painful scenes, we would do well to recall both the history and the religious traditions of that land, which are more diverse than many expect.\n\nWhile the formal existence of Afghanistan as a state began in 1880 at the end of the Second Anglo-Afghan War, archeology indicates that Neanderthal humans were living there around 52,000 B.C. There have been urban centers in that land since about 3,000 B.C. The Indus Valley civilization of India that was one of the early centers of civilization reached parts of Afghanistan around 2,000 B.C. An urban complex called Balkh, in what is now Bactria emerged about this time. The country is mountainous but is nonetheless a crossroads to India and it borders the ancient Silk Road, the trade route from the west to China. The largest linguistic group in Afghanistan is the Pashtun, which derives from early forms of Persian, suggesting inroads by Iranian merchants.\n\nThe first major empire to develop in what is now Afghanistan was Kamboja, which developed under the influence of migrating Indo-Iranian peoples, who brought with them the Sanskrit language and early parts of some of the Hindu Scriptures. Forms of Hinduism continued to exist there for some centuries and today there are few left. But in the sixth century B.C., the Persian Achaemenids entered the territory and asserted dominance, but it led to three centuries of conflict. It was during this period that Buddhism was introduced into the territory, and we also saw the rise of Zoroastrianism.\n\nZoroastrianism was a monotheistic faith, associated with the Persian Empire around 600 B.C. The Prophet Zoroaster was a visionary who declared the existence of the one true god, whom he called Ahura Mazda. His faith was complete with good and evil angelic beings, and he taught about a judgment day and life after death. It has some ties to the Hebrew religion of ancient Israel. However, while the historical existence of Zoroaster is debated, many scholars believe his homeland was in Afghanistan, which explains how the Persian religion became dominant in the area so quickly.\n\nPersian rule in Afghanistan and elsewhere was brought to an end by the arrival of Alexander the Great of Macedon, around 330 B.C., who invaded Persia and moved on to make war in Afghanistan. Alexander could be quite merciful to those who submitted to Greek rule, but to those who resisted he was utterly brutal. A great many of the Greeks were killed in the process as well. After the death of Alexander in Babylon in 323 B.C., his empire broke up into a series of smaller principalities. A Greco-Indian kingdom called the Yavana held power in Afghanistan for the next two centuries governed by Greek kings. As always, where the Greeks went, they brought their own Greek pagan gods, whose images appear on coins from the period and in now ruined temples. Alexander’s name lives on in the names of several Afghan cities including Kandahar, which is a modified version of Alexander’s Afghan name, Iskandar.\n\nThe successors to the pagan Greeks were peoples of Indian heritage known as the Mauryan Empire, which led to the growth of Hinduism as well as the introduction of Buddhism in Afghanistan. The years that followed found a series of invaders and kingdoms rising and falling, including the Huna, the Kidarites, the Alchon Huns, the White Huns, and the Kabul Shahi. In many periods that followed, Afghanistan was divided and ruled by smaller kingdoms.\n\nFrom a religious perspective the greatest impact on Afghanistan was the invasion by Islamic Arabs under the control of the Umayyad regime headquartered in Baghdad. The Muslims made war on the Persian Empire and defeated them in 642 A.D., and the last Persian emperor, Yzadegerd III fled for his life at the Battle of Nihawand. First by the edge of the sword and then by a century of missionary work sponsored by the Umayyads the majority of the population has embraced Islam.\n\nIn the centuries which followed the introduction of Islam, Afghanistan was invaded a number of times, the most devastating of which was the Mongol invasion. The Mongols were successful, in large part because of their complete willingness to butcher anyone who got in their way. For example, after the Mongols got done destroying the city of Bamyan, the deserted site was renamed “The City of Screams.”\n\nThe Mongol control of Afghanistan passed into another series of invasions and empires, the Afsharid, the Durrani, and ultimately the British, who got thrown out after three painful and unsuccessful wars. By 1826, a central government under a monarchy was established known as the Barakzai Dynasty. After many adventures, the monarchy was overthrown in 1973, which began a series of coups, the last of which was a pro-Communist regime led by Hafizullah Amin.\n\nThe rise of Marxism brought with it anti-religious propaganda, and attempts to modernize the country, including laws forbidding men’s beards, education for women, banning forced marriages, land reforms and, of course, state atheism. These reforms were accompanied by massive imprisonments and purges to quell resistance. The communist regime had long ties to the Soviet Union, and so when revolution against the Marxist government exploded, the Soviet Russians invaded to quiet things down. Like the British before them, the Russians soon found themselves in an unwinnable war. But the religious impact on Afghanistan was considerable, as national resistance to the Russians fused with religion, and Islam became the major resistance to the Soviets … with financial aid from Saudi Arabia and the United States.\n\nIn the year 1947, the Islamic faith comprised about 84% of the total population. Of the remaining, about half were Sikh and the rest were other Eastern faiths or the monotheistic religions. After the final withdrawal of the Russians, 99.7% of the Afghan population has been Islamic, with the great majority being Sunni and a minority of 9% being Shia. Non-Muslims living in Afghanistan are only about 0.3%.\n\nThe fate of non-Islamic religions in the past several decades has been less than positive. As of 1970 there were an estimated 1,000 Afghan Zoroastrians. Bahai’s have been living in the country since 1880, but today number about 16,000. It is estimated there are somewhere between 1,000 and 18,000 Christians in Afghanistan who practice their faith secretly. About 600 Hindus and 1,300 Sikhs remain. Most Jews were forced to convert to Islam when the Taliban first took over in the 1990s and whatever became of them is unknown, but there are expatriate Afghan Jewish communities living in Israel and elsewhere. And just to note, until a few weeks ago there was one Jew still living in Afghanistan, Zablon Simintov, a merchant who also was the custodian of the last and only synagogue in Kabul. In August 2021, business contacts in Israel hired a private security agency to quietly whisk him out of the country. Sic transit gloria, thus passes all glory."
