        "text": "The Taliban say they will rule Afghanistan according to Sharia, or Islamic law.\n\nThe militant Islamist group have taken control after the departure of US and allied forces from the country.\n\nIn the first press briefing after taking power, a Taliban spokesman said issues such as the media and women's rights would be respected \"within the framework of Islamic law\", but the group has not yet provided any details of what that will mean in practice.\n\nThe Taliban have been known for their strict interpretation of Sharia, including punishments such as public executions of convicted murderers and adulterers.\n\nSharia is Islam's legal system.\n\nIt is derived from the Quran, Islam's holy book, as well as the Sunnah and Hadith - the deeds and sayings of the Prophet Muhammad.\n\nWhere an answer cannot be derived directly from these, religious scholars may give rulings as guidance on a particular topic or question.\n\nIn Arabic, Sharia literally means \"the clear, well-trodden path to water\".\n\nSharia acts as a code for living that all Muslims should adhere to, including prayers, fasting and donations to the poor.\n\nIt aims to help Muslims understand how they should lead every aspect of their lives according to God's wishes.\n\nSharia can inform every aspect of daily life for a Muslim.\n\nFor example, a Muslim wondering what to do if their colleagues invite them to the pub after work may turn to a Sharia scholar for advice to ensure they act within the legal framework of their religion.\n\nOther areas of daily life where Muslims may turn to Sharia for guidance include family law, finance and business.\n\nLike any legal system, Sharia is complex and its practice is entirely reliant on the quality and training of experts.\n\nIslamic jurists issue guidance and rulings. Guidance that is considered a formal legal ruling is called a fatwa.\n\nThere are many safeguards and a high burden of proof in the application of hadd penalties. But experts say that often doesn't happen in practice.\n\nSome countries where Islamic law is applied adopt or enforce such punishments for hadd offences, and surveys have suggested attitudes of Muslims to harsh penalties for such offences vary widely."
