        "text": "Tom Hanks and Robin Wright experience pivotal moments at one very important place in the trailer for Here.\n\nSony‘s TriStar Pictures is set to release director Robert Zemeckis‘ drama feature in theaters on Nov. 15. Here tells the story of multiple families over the course of generations, with the entire film taking place in a single location, which becomes the home where Hanks’ and Wright’s characters reside. The trailer shows an early exchange between the characters, along with glimpses at their future ups and downs.\n\n“Time sure does fly, doesn’t it?” Hanks tells Wright in the trailer, leading her to reply, “It sure does.”\n\nLater in the footage, Hanks invites Wright to stay over at his home: “You know, if you like, you could spend the rest of the night here.” She responds, “I could spend the rest of my life here.”\n\nPaul Bettany, Kelly Reilly and Michelle Dockery round out the cast.\n\nZemeckis helmed Here from a script he wrote with Eric Roth that is based on the graphic novel of the same name by Richard McGuire. Zemeckis, Jack Rapke, Derek Hogue and Bill Block are producers on the film that hails from Miramax.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter reported last year that Hanks and Wright are de-aged in the movie through the generative AI-driven tool called Metaphysic Live. “With Here, the film simply wouldn’t work without our actors seamlessly transforming into younger versions of themselves,” Zemeckis explained at the time.\n\nHere marks a reunion for Zemeckis, Roth, Hanks and Wright, who all previously collaborated on 1994’s Oscar-winning film Forrest Gump, celebrating its 30th anniversary next month. Forrest Gump picked up six Academy Awards, including best picture, in addition to wins for Hanks for best actor, Zemeckis for best director and Roth for best adapted screenplay.\n\nHanks’ recent credits include Asteroid City, A Man Called Otto and Elvis. Wright recently appeared in the films Damsel and Devil’s Peak."
