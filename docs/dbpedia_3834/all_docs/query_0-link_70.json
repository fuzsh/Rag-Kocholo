What's with Jeff Fahey's coke-head laugh? And what bargain bin did Geoffrey Lewis get this Irish accent in? PLUS: How much of this southern judge's time can Stephen King take up?\n\nThe Lawnmower Man stars Jeff Fahey, Pierce Brosnan, Geoffrey Lewis, Jenny Wright, Mark Bringelson, Colleen Coffey, Jeremy Slate, and Dean Norris; directed by Brett Leonard.\n\nUnlock Exclusive Content!: http://www.patreon.com/wehatemovies\n\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information."
