        "text": "The talented, unpredictable, opinionated, and uniquely beautiful Jenny Wright was born March 23, 1962 in New York City. Her father was an artist and her mother was a teacher. They instilled a love of the arts and a strong devotion to self education in Jenny at an early age. Her parents later separated, and Jenny moved to Cambridge, New York to live with her mother and two sisters. After her sisters left for college, Jenny and her mother moved back to New York City. Once back home, Jenny decided to pursue acting, and enrolled herself in the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute. There, she immediately captured the attention of modeling and casting agents. At the age of 16, Jenny modeled for artists Antonio Lopez and Salvador Dalí. She then went on to act on stage, in an off Broadway play, \"Album\", with Kevin Bacon. In 1980, Jenny made a brief appearance in the TV film Verhängnisvolle Leidenschaft (1980) with Mickey Rourke. She continued to act on stage, even garnering rave reviews for her portrayal of Dorcus Fray in Joseph Papp's Broadway production of \"Plenty\". In 1982, Jenny was cast in Garp und wie er die Welt sah (1982), after impressing director George Roy Hill with her blend of sensuality and innocence. Jenny then arrived in London for \"Pink Floyd: The Wall\", where she played an abused groupie. She then quickly followed up with four months in Utah for the TV documentary/drama, \"The Executioner's Song,\" which proved to be a more substantial role. Jenny returned to New York afterwards, and back to the stage and took a break from films. She went back to films in 1984, for \"The Wild Life\" with Eric Stoltz and Chris Penn. Jenny also made appearances in films such as \"St. Elmo's Fire\" (1984) and \"Out of Bounds\" (1986). By appearing in films with actors such as Rob Loew and Anthony Michael Hall, Jenny was put in the 'Brat Pack' category. It was something she found to be uncomfortable, and wanted to shake off. Thus, Jenny's film choices became edgier, starting with Near Dark in 1987. With her girl next door look, large soulful eyes, and sensuality, Jenny made the role of sweet yet dangerous Mae her most memorable part of her career. She credits director Kathryn Bigelow with creating the film's mood and atmosphere, which makes \"Near Dark\" a stand-out film in the vampire genre. While \"Near Dark\" didn't fare too well at the box office, it did receive cult status, bringing Jenny independent,'left of center' film roles. Finally, Jenny successfully rid herself of the 'Brat Pack' label. She went on to teen roles in the critically acclaimed film The Chocolate War (1988) and in the off-beat \"Twister\" (1988). Those roles then gave way to conventional parts in the mainstream films \"Young Guns II\" (1990) and \"The Lawnmower Man\" (1992). After that, Jenny quit the film business."
