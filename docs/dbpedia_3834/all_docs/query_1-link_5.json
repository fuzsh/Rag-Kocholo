        "text": "Highest Rated: 85% The Chocolate War (1988)\n\nLowest Rated: 37% The Lawnmower Man (1992)\n\nBirthday: Mar 23, 1962\n\nBirthplace: New York, New York, USA\n\nLissome blonde actor who began in supporting roles as ingenues and later played several earnest leading lady parts in mostly routine films. Wright studied acting at the Lee Strasberg Theater Institute and with teachers including Stella Adler. A New York native, she lived for a time with her family upstate but returned to Manhattan as a teen and found work in off-Broadway theater. Wright made her film debut in \"The World According to Garp\" (1982) and for a time seemed posed to enter the \"brat pack\" gang of young actors reaching for stardom in the mid-1980s. She played the modest-sized role of Rob Lowe's wife in one of that group's signature films, \"St. Elmo's Fire\" (1985), but Wright's subsequent credits have received variable exposure.\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n85% The Chocolate War\n\n83% Near Dark\n\n73% Pink Floyd - The Wall\n\n71% A Shock to the System\n\n71% The World According to Garp\n\n67% I, Madman\n\n37% The Lawnmower Man\n\nPhotos\n\nTHE WILD LIFE, Clockwise from top left: Eric Stoltz, Lea Thompson, Christopher Penn, Jenny Wright, Ilan Mitchell-Smith, 1984, (c) Universal Pictures OUT OF BOUNDS, Anthony Michael Hall, Jenny Wright, 1986, (c) Columbia OUT OF BOUNDS, Jenny Wright, Anthony Michael Hall, 1986, (c) Columbia PINK FLOYD THE WALL, Jenny Wright, Bob Geldof, 1982, (c) MGM OUT OF BOUNDS, Jeff Kober, Jenny Wright, 1986, (c) Columbia VALENTINO RETURNS, Jenny Wright, Barry Tubb, 1989, (c)Skouras Pictures OUT OF BOUNDS, Jenny Wright, 1986, (c) Columbia OUT OF BOUNDS, Jenny Wright, Anthony Michael Hall, 1986, (c)Columbia Pictures OUT OF BOUNDS, Jenny Wright, 1986, (c) Columbia OUT OF BOUNDS, Anthony Michael Hall, Jenny Wright, 1986, (c)Columbia Pictures OUT OF BOUNDS, Anthony Michael Hall, Jenny Wright, 1986, (c)Columbia Pictures OUT OF BOUNDS, Jenny Wright, 1986, (c)Columbia Pictures THE WILD LIFE, Rick Moranis, Jenny Wright, 1984, (c) Universal Pictures OUT OF BOUNDS, Anthony Michael Hall, Jenny Wright, 1986, (c)Columbia Pictures VALENTINO RETURNS, Barry Tubb, Jenny Wright, 1989, (c)Skouras OUT OF BOUNDS, Jenny Wright, Anthony Michael Hall, 1986, (c)Columbia Pictures NEAR DARK, Jenny Wright, 1987, (c)De Laurentiis Entertainment Group NEAR DARK, Jenny Wright, 1987 OUT OF BOUNDS, Anthony Michael Hall, Jenny Wright, 1986, (c)Columbia Pictures NEAR DARK, Jenny Wright, 1987\n\nFilmography\n\nMovies\n\nCredit 37% 31% The Lawnmower Man Marnie Burke (Character) - 1992 71% 62% A Shock to the System Melanie O'Conner (Character) $2.0M 1990 No Score Yet 44% Twister Stephanie (Character) - 1989 67% 40% I, Madman Virginia (Character) - 1989 No Score Yet No Score Yet Gideon Oliver: Sleep Well, Professor Oliver Coombs (Character) - 1989 No Score Yet 43% Valentino Returns Sylvia Fuller (Character) $7.6K 1989 85% 67% The Chocolate War Lisa (Character) - 1988 83% 74% Near Dark Mae (Character) $2.5M 1987 No Score Yet 45% Out of Bounds Dizz / Darlene (Character) $4.2M 1986 No Score Yet 41% The Wild Life Eileen (Character) - 1984 73% 89% Pink Floyd - The Wall American Groupie (Character) - 1982 71% 78% The World According to Garp Cushie - Steering School (Character) - 1982\n\nTV\n\nCredit 83% 93% NYPD Blue Trish Taylor (Guest Star) 1997 No Score Yet No Score Yet Matlock Unknown (Guest Star) 1991 No Score Yet No Score Yet Danger Bay Unknown (Guest Star) 1987"
