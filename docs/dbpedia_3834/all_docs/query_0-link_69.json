When his experiments on animals fail, he finds the ideal substitute - Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a slow-witted gardener. Dr. Angelo's goal is to benefit his human guinea pig and ultimately mankind itself, but evil lurks in the guise of \"The Shop\", a shadow group that seeks to use the technology to create an invincible war machine. When the experiments change the simple Jobe into a superhuman being, the stage is set for a Jekyll-and-Hyde struggle for control of Jobe's mind and the future of the world. Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace: Enter the deadly world of virtual reality, where information is the key to world domination. Picking up where the original Lawnmower Man ended, Jobe (Matt Frewer - Max Headroom) has become a hostage in futuristic hell. But when he discovers a computer chip that will give him the key to the ultimate revenge, the battle for world control begins. With stunning special effects, Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace takes you into a world where only the hardwired dare to journey."
