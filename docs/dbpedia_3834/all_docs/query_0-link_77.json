        "text": "By Abigail King\n\nDr. Angelo, a scientist working for the military, attempts to unlock the powers of the mind using Virtual Reality. His first human subject, Jobe Smith, (a young gardener with the mind of a child) becomes increasingly more intelligent, with terrifying results.\n\nThe Story\n\nThe film is apparently based on an original short story from 1975 by Steven King, though that story is completely different to the screenplay, which was written without input from King. This led to King suing New Line Cinema for the use of the name (and winning).\n\nConsidering that the movie was released at the onset of virtual reality, before the internet became mainstream for the big tech companies, the plot is ahead of it’s time. Obviously, the use of virtual reality on it’s own to improve intelligence is sceptical, but it is now being used in education and training. At it’s heart, it can be classed as a ‘revenge’ film, telling the story of someone who is mentally and physically abused but, with the use of technology, gets the upper hand and ends up developing a ‘God complex’.\n\nParts of the story could certainly have influenced later films such as The Matrix (1999) and Lucy (2014).\n\nThe Making Of\n\nThe sequences set in VR definitely show their age, but still work and are close to the quality that you would expect from virtual reality on a budget smartphone nowadays. The special effects set in the real world do not stand the test of time. The sets and props weren’t fantastical – the headsets are almost exactly what we have now – which reinforces the point that this film was visionary.\n\nThe character of Jobe is brilliantly played by Jeff Fahey (Silverado, Lost) through the different stages of intelligence and the effect that they have on his mental state. Pierce Brosnan (Goldeneye) ably plays Dr Angelo, who is torn between his work and his morals.\n\nOverall\n\nFor a film made in 1992, the technology holds up, even though the special effects may not.\n\nGood Points:\n\nGood main characters\n\nOriginal plot points that have influenced many other films since\n\nImprovements:"
