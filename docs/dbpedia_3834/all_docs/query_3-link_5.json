        "text": "The talented, unpredictable, opinionated, and uniquely beautiful Jenny Wright was born March 23, 1962 in New York City. Her father was an artist and her mother was a teacher. They instilled a love of the arts and a strong devotion to self education in Jenny at an early age. Her parents later separated, and Jenny moved to Cambridge, New York to live with her mother and two sisters. After her sisters left for college, Jenny and her mother moved back to New York City. Once back home, Jenny decided to pursue acting, and enrolled herself in the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute. There, she immediately captured the attention of modeling and casting agents. At the age of 16, Jenny modeled for artists Antonio Lopez and Salvador Dalí. She then went on to act on stage, in an off Broadway play, \"Album\", with Kevin Bacon. In 1980, Jenny made a brief appearance in the TV film Verhängnisvolle Leidenschaft (1980) with Mickey Rourke. She continued to act on stage, even garnering rave reviews for her portrayal of Dorcus Fray in Joseph Papp's Broadway production of \"Plenty\". In 1982, Jenny was cast in Garp und wie er die Welt sah (1982), after impressing director George Roy Hill with her blend of sensuality and innocence. Jenny then arrived in London for \"Pink Floyd: The Wall\", where she played an abused groupie. She then quickly followed up with four months in Utah for the TV documentary/drama, \"The Executioner's Song,\" which proved to be a more substantial role. Jenny returned to New York afterwards, and back to the stage and took a break from films. She went back to films in 1984, for \"The Wild Life\" with Eric Stoltz and Chris Penn. Jenny also made appearances in films such as \"St. Elmo's Fire\" (1984) and \"Out of Bounds\" (1986). By appearing in films with actors such as Rob Loew and Anthony Michael Hall, Jenny was put in the 'Brat Pack' category. It was something she found to be uncomfortable, and wanted to shake off. Thus, Jenny's film choices became edgier, starting with Near Dark in 1987. With her girl next door look, large soulful eyes, and sensuality, Jenny made the role of sweet yet dangerous Mae her most memorable part of her career. She credits director Kathryn Bigelow with creating the film's mood and atmosphere, which makes \"Near Dark\" a stand-out film in the vampire genre. While \"Near Dark\" didn't fare too well at the box office, it did receive cult status, bringing Jenny independent,'left of center' film roles. Finally, Jenny successfully rid herself of the 'Brat Pack' label. She went on to teen roles in the critically acclaimed film The Chocolate War (1988) and in the off-beat \"Twister\" (1988). Those roles then gave way to conventional parts in the mainstream films \"Young Guns II\" (1990) and \"The Lawnmower Man\" (1992). After that, Jenny quit the film business.\n\nIn the early 1980s, a young actress made her first appearances in television and films with an unforgettably quirky presence -- vulnerable and seductive all at once. Her delicate features - unusual green eyes and aching-to-be-kissed lips -- combined with her petite and shapely figure to make a true gamine beauty.\n\nUnfortunately, Jenny Wright never had much of a chance; she was sidelined into 'tramp' roles from the word go. Her small-screen debut on the critically acclaimed sitcom, \"Love, Sidney,\" was as a teenage runaway/prostitute. Her film debut in \"Pink Floyd: The Wall\" cast her as a groupie. For the remainder of 1982, the bad girl image more or less stuck: she gave Robin Williams' Garp his first sexual experience as flighty Cushie in \"The World According to Garp\" and she played the flirty but emotionally troubled younger sister of Tommy Lee Jones' girlfriend in the made-for-TV film \"The Executioner's Song.\"\n\nJenny also appeared in the video for Swiss rock group Yello's 1983 song \"Lost Again,\" as the object of obsession of the video's rotagonist. She appeared wearing a quadruple strand of pearls and a dark, lovely dress, and is beautifully photographed against the backdrop of New York, including its subways, at night.\n\nIn 1984, Jenny Wright was cast as Eileen in \"The Wild Life,\" a semisequel to the popular \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High.\" She was her charming self, in a role that didn't have much to offer, but gave some bright spots to an otherwise forgettable film. The two films she made next, 1985's \"St. Elmo's Fire\" and 1986's \"Out of Bounds,\" cast her with members of the Brat Pack. Although she was never an official Brat Packer, she was on its fringes.\n\nIn 1987, Jenny was offered her first star turn in Kathryn Bigelow's \"Near Dark.\" Released at the same time as the mainstream-smash \"Lost Boys,\" it finished decidedly second at the box office -- a shame, since Jenny's performance as vampire ingenue Mae was nothing short of brilliant. This film also marked Jenny's decided career directional change away from mainstream film and into indies.\n\n\"I, Madman\" was made in 1989, and watching it is a treat. Jenny is perfect in her dual role as real-time victim Virginia and fifties-era victim Anna Templer.\n\nUnfortunately, \"I, Madman\" marked the last time Jenny had a major role in a film, and in the early 1990s she reprised her early-career persona of the tramp in films like \"Queens Logic,\" \"Young Guns II\" (as a memorable madam), and 1992's \"The Lawnmower Man\" (as Marnie Burke, a widow on the prowl). Making only one more TV appearance, she has virtually disappeared. Attempts to locate her to appear with her colleagues in a documentary about \"Near Dark\" were unsuccessful. Ironic that this talented actress, so good in two films with sinister plots (\"Near Dark\" and \"I, Madman\") should be the subject of a mystery herself."
