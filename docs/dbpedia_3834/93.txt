The Lawnmower Man is a 1992 science-fiction action-horror film directed by Brett Leonard and written by Brett Leonard and Gimel Everett. The movie is supposedly an adaptation of Stephen King short story of the same name, but aside from a single scene, the two are completely different. The film stars Jeff Fahey as Jobe Smith, a simple-minded gardener, and Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, the scientist who decides to experiment on him.
