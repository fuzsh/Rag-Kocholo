        "text": "Program Curriculum\n\nWe’ve developed a Garden-Based Learning Curriculum, © Berkeley Unified School District, that directly supports BUSD learning and teaching goals. Each lesson is designed to be an interactive teaching tool, co-taught with classroom teachers and garden instructors as leads. These hands-on lessons 1) connect academics to real-world experiences; 2) include all learners; 3) invite curiosity; and 4) provide opportunities for reflection.\n\n“Garden is a magical place, great that kids get to see it develop over the year, do so many tastings, and activities in the packets are great. Instructor clearly loves her work and showing what she knows to kids.”\n\n– BUSD Classroom Teacher\n\n“We have 4 Garden Specialists who teach in 8 gardens from TK-8th grade. We use the Berkeley curriculum daily in our lessons. We have enjoyed many of the hands on activities and the “workbooks” which we have turned into garden journals. Some of our favorite activities are the water cycle, composition of soil, beneficial and non-beneficial insects (always a hit with the students) and FBI.”\n\n– Garden Coordinator, Ukiah Unified School District.\n\n“I can’t tell you enough how the curriculum has been a help and an inspiration to us. I love to garden, but I don’t have teacher training, so having rubric-based plans and ideas is SO helpful. Keep up the great work.”\n\n– Seeds of Hope, Wilson, NC\n\n“I learned how to check if there are added sugars or natural sugars in your beverage by looking at the ingredients on the bottle.”\n\n– Middle School Student\n\nCareer Technical Education in Public Health\n\nStudents at Berkeley High School and Berkeley Technology Academy are offered courses in Career Technical Education (CTE) in Public Health; and students at Willard and Longfellow Middle School are offered CTE in gardening and cooking and Growing Leaders electives This year-long course focuses on career and learning opportunities for better understanding diet-related disease and local policy intended to curtail health inequities. Students practice communication and collaboration skills, while building confidence as problem-solvers.\n\n“Facilitating the food pantries has overall given me a great working experience. I really get to use my communication, collaboration, and problem-solving skills. I also get the opportunity to learn about others’ living situations, lifestyles, and preferences when they choose to share about it and it fills my heart with even more compassion for the people that are able to benefit from it in the Bay Area. In sum, I have a lot of pride to be a part of the food pantries at Berkeley High. I’ve gotten to strengthen and build my relationships with my peers and mentors while also gaining valuable work experience. I’m really grateful to be working with such a great organization and great people!”\n\n– BUSD High School Student\n\nFood Pantries are Available Free to the Public\n\nProgram staff and students studying Public and Community Health manage the high school food pantries in partnership with Berkeley Food Network and Growing Leaders. Together, we are able to provide fresh produce, ready-made meals, and pantry items for free to our school and City community. Students get real-world experience working with the community on healthy food access and are paid hourly as part of their Career Technical Education internship.\n\nThe Berkeley Technology Academy food pantry is in service every 2nd and 4th Tuesday of the month from 2:30 – 4:00 pm at 2701 Martin Luther King Jr. Way. The Berkeley High School food pantry is in service on the 1st and 3rd Tuesday of the month from 3:00-4:00 pm on MLK between Bancroft and Allston Way.\n\nFunding\n\nThese projects are funded through a Healthy Berkeley grant with matching dollars from BUSD General Fund, Extended Learning Opportunities from California Department of Education (CDE), Strong Workforce Development Grants from The California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office (CCCCO), in partnership with the CDE, and California Department of Food and Agriculture Farm to School Incubator Grant Program. Supporting projects are funded through generous grants from our community and with donations from our community.\n\nDonate Now\n\nYour financial gift will support our work serving BUSD students in the Garden and Kitchen classrooms.
