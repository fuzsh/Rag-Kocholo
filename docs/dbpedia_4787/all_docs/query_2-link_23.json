Berkeley educates the whole child by nurturing students intellectual, emotional, spiritual and physical development so they may attain their highest potential.\n\nOur philosophy encompasses a balanced curriculum of academics and arts, clubs and activities, competitive sports and community service. An emphasis on academic excellence combined with a spirit of social responsibility engenders in students a newfound confidence and shared sense of purpose. Students exchange ideas, study virtues and explore ethics as they define their attitudes and values."
