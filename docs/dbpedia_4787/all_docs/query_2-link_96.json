Traditionally the five major religions are considered: Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism. Students will study the philosophical foundations and the historical contexts of these major religions, and their studies will include an understanding of the lives, characters and teachings of the leaders of these faiths. By studying the scriptures, beliefs and forms of worship, students gain an understanding of how indispensable religious life has been to humankind through the millennia with particular emphasis placed on an appreciation of cultural myths, epic stories and philosophical underpinnings that truly characterize these traditions, with holidays and forms of worship as important topics of class discussion. This course will also focus on the geography, history and practice of these religions as they worked to form the cultural identity of their specific geographic area. There is a final exam at the end of semester, and grades are comprised of regular homework assignments, unit tests, and in-class activities.\n\nThis course earns ½ credit toward Upper Division graduation requirement, and grades contribute to students’ GPA.
