        "text": "Summary:\n\nBerkeley Preparatory Academy is a public charter elementary and middle school in Summerville, South Carolina, serving 708 students from kindergarten through 8th grade. This school stands out for its strong academic performance, diverse student population, and relatively low student-teacher ratio.\n\nBerkeley Preparatory Academy consistently outperforms the Berkeley 01 district and the state of South Carolina in standardized test scores across multiple grade levels and subject areas. For example, in the 2023-2024 school year, 87.49% of Berkeley Preparatory Academy students were proficient or better in EOCEP/Algebra 1/Mathematics for the Technologies 2, compared to 55.95% for the district and 72.5% for the state. The school also has a more diverse student population, with a higher percentage of White (57.91%) and African American (23.59%) students, as well as a significant Hispanic student population (9.89%).\n\nWhile Berkeley Preparatory Academy outperforms the district and state, it is not the highest-performing school in the immediate area. Nearby schools like Nexton Elementary and Cane Bay Elementary have higher statewide rankings and proficiency rates in some subject areas. However, Berkeley Preparatory Academy still maintains a strong academic standing, with a 3-star rating from SchoolDigger and consistent performance across different student subgroups, including a noteworthy ranking for African American students.\n\nDetail:"
