        "text": "Aleksandra B.\n\nSAT 1400+\n\nThank you so much. I couldn't be happier with The Princeton Review. You guys helped me reach my highest potential. I just think the amount of prep was perfect. It's just organized very well and there are always available resources.\n\nMikealani P.\n\nSAT 1400+\n\nThe reading section was my greatest improvement and pushed me over the edge into my 1400+ score. I must also give credit to my teacher Robert Storrs. I truly believe I wouldn't have performed so well on the SAT without his help.\n\nMaria H.\n\nMCAT\n\nEverything about The Princeton Review - content, instructors, customer service - is zero stress. The content is accessible, not unnecessarily in-depth, but thorough (with loads of practice on every specific topic).\n\nJoseph L.\n\nMCAT\n\nEssentially, I had no idea how to study for this test before taking the prep course. I was intimidated and didn't know where to start. Definitely, I knew exactly how to study for the test after completion of the Princeton Review course.\n\nMatthew B.\n\nMCAT\n\nThe Princeton Review gave a comprehensive overview of the test subjects and consistently helped me refine my skills. My practice test scores were 501, 505, 512, and 518 showing how my goal was achieved gradually over the course.\n\nErik H.\n\nSAT Essentials\n\nLearning how to read math word problems and how to do the more difficult ones was what helped me get a perfect 800/800 on the math part of the SAT. The more useful part for me was the explanation on what types of questions there would be on the test."
