        "text": "Berkeley\n\nGrades: Pre-K - 5\n\nWe are excited to announce that Rocky Mountain Prep Sunnyside will be located within Rocky Mountain Prep Berkeley, marking the inauguration of RMP's first ECE-8th grade campus for the 2024-25 School Year. You can find us at 3752 Tennyson St, Denver, CO 80212. Rocky Mountain Prep Berkeley is a joyful campus that has a family feel. Teachers know their students and actively partner with families to encourage their child to grow as academics and individuals. Students at RMP Berkeley look forward to coming to school to learn and grow with their peers. They are pushed to question, imagine and think critically about their learning and the world that we live in.\n\n3752 Tennyson St. Denver, CO 80212\n\n720-464-3550\n\nAime Cano is the principal at RMP Berkeley. She has been working with children and their families since 2001, formally in education, since 2006. Aime has lived, taught, and led abroad in schools in China, Mexico, and now in Denver. Before her role at RMP Berkeley, she served as an elementary principal, literacy coach, assistant principal of instruction, and language coordinator in addition to teaching language arts/english, biology, and business amongst other areas. As a parent of four children, two at Berkeley, she understands the importance of teacher/family/school communication and community in building lifelong learners and leaders."
