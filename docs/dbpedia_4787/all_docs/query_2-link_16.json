        "text": "Our History\n\nBerkeley was established in 1960 by Tampa Bay families who wished to begin an independent, coed day school as an alternative to the boarding experience. They were convinced that an independent day school could best combine the elements considered essential to a complete education: an academic institution consisting of fine facilities, superior faculty, sound program, capable and motivated students, and supportive families.\n\nEdgar T. McCleary, founding Headmaster of Berkeley (1960-1978), came to Tampa from Asheville School in North Carolina and modeled Berkeley on the concept of a New England boarding school. Classes began in 1961 at St. Andrew’s Parish House with 140 students in seventh through twelfth grade. Shortly thereafter, Berkeley moved to a site on Davis Islands, where it remained until 1979. The Lower Division was established in 1967 and was housed at St. Andrew’s Parish House. In 1979, a new campus was built on Kelly Road for the Middle and Upper Division. By 1983, the Lower Division facilities were added, uniting the school on one campus in 1984."
