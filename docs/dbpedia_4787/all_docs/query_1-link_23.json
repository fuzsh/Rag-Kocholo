        "text": "Here are some basic steps to get your Berkeley career off to a great start.\n\nLog into CalCentral\n\nThis student portal is where you will find instructions, dates, contact information, and tasks for you as an incoming student. The tasks below will be listed within CalCentral.\n\nCreate your CalNet ID and bConnected account\n\nYour CalNet ID and password are essential to accessing Berkeley online systems and tools. New students receive an invitation to do this from the Registrar. Once you’ve created your CalNet ID, you will also need to set up your bConnected account (Berkeley’s email, calendar, and file sharing system). Remember that much of the communication you receive as a new student will come to your Berkeley email address.\n\nApply for Housing\n\nThe housing application deadline quickly follows the admission acceptance deadline. For example, if your acceptance deadline is May 15, your Housing application will be due May 16. As this date varies based on student status, be sure to check the deadline on the CalCentral Housing Application task. Be sure to learn about the application process and your housing options, costs, and deadlines, via the Housing website.\n\nReview Financial Aid & Scholarship Information\n\nTake a careful look at your estimated cost of attendance and any aid or scholarships that have been offered to you via MyFinances in CalCentral.\n\nSubmit Final Transcript\n\nBe sure to send an official and final version of your transcript to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions by the deadline. This information is included both in CalCentral and in your Conditions of Admission.\n\nBegin Process for Cal 1 Card & AC Transit Class Pass Clipper Card\n\nThe Cal 1 Card serves as your official university identification. (Cal 1 Card issuance requires that you submit a photo online; you’ll find directions in CalCentral.) Also, as a student, you’re provided with an AC Transit Class Pass, which allows you free access to all AC Transit bus routes and can be used for other public transportation, such as BART. When you arrive on campus you will be given both your Cal 1 Card and your AC Transit Class Pass Clipper Card. You’ll find details in CalCentral.\n\nComplete Immunization & Health Insurance Enrollment\n\nAll incoming UC Berkeley students are required to comply with the immunization and TB screening mandate by July 31 (May 1, 2023 deadline if participating in Summer programs), prior to coming to campus. All students attending any University of California school are required to meet the COVID-19 vaccine requirement prior to enrolling in classes. Follow the instructions from University Health Services. Also, be sure to check Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP) enrollment and waiving options: All UC Berkeley students are enrolled in SHIP (Student Health Insurance Plan) annually with an option to waive with their own insurance if it meets UC-wide criteria by July 15. Berkeley SHIP coverage begins August 1. Note: Be sure to check the SHIP website for the most up-to-date deadlines/fees.\n\nComplete Golden Bear Advising\n\nThis is the first step in your Golden Bear Experience. Learn about the online module on our Golden Bear Advising web page; log into CalCentral to access the module.\n\nComplete Golden Bear Prep\n\nThis is the second step in your Golden Bear Experience. Learn about the online module on our Golden Bear Prep web page; log into CalCentral to access the module.\n\nComplete Vector Solutions Safe & Inclusive Campus Training\n\nVector Solutions is an interactive online education platform that will provide training on three topics: sexual violence prevention, alcohol and other drugs, and equity, diversity and inclusion. The modules will help you understand related University policies, campus resources, and ways in which you can be an active bystander and community leader in preventing harassment and violence in our community. Note: Students who do not complete Vector Solutions will not be able to enroll in their second semester of courses.\n\nNeed help? CSC is here for you."
