As captain of the Xavier Varsity Swim & Dive team, I learned how to unite incoming freshwomen who didnâ€™t know anyone on the team with girls who had been on the team for multiple years.\n\nKelly Scott â€˜21\n\nAdvice to freshwomen: Everyone holds little boxes of wisdom for us to receive if we have the patience to listen to them. Learn as much as you can from them.\n\nBernadine Bueno â€˜21\n\nAdvice to freshwomen: Take advantage of any opportunity you can and try new clubs, sports or activities youâ€™ve never considered before.\n\nJane Farmer â€˜21\n\nXavier has taught me to manage my time so I donâ€™t get behind. Itâ€™s carried through to my personal life -- Iâ€™m more responsible, think about the future, and am aware of always doing my best.\n\nJaden Campbell â€˜21\n\nXavierâ€™s community has allowed me to grow in a myriad of ways! Through the various clubs and activities they have to offer, I had the opportunity to explore my passions and thrive as a leader, enabling me to be prepared for future endeavors. The positive, supportive environment of Xavier has undoubtedly helped me grow in so many ways.\n\nNina Rawal â€˜23\n\nXavier has been a part of my everything for almost 50 years! As a student, I was always learning and striving toward excellence. As a Xavier parent, I have supported the mission for excellence. As a coach at XCP, I have personally witnessed women of excellence in practice, while competing, and always in their studies. Xavier is a safe place to grow, be yourself, and grow into your best self too!\n\nEden Higgins â€˜83\n\nMy education at Xavier formed me to be the person I am. To have the discipline to work hard, keep at it, not give up and rely on my faith. It has provided me with friends, community, faith, and an education that continues to enrich my life.\n\nKitty Lagmade â€˜82"
