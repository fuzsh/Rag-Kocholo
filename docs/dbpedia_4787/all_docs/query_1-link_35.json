        "text": "California applicants must earn at least a 3.0 GPA and nonresidents must earn a minimum 3.4 GPA in all A-G or college-preparatory courses to meet this requirement. To see how to calculate your UC GPA, follow our instructions below.\n\nHow to calculate your UC GPA\n\n1. Convert your grades to grade points.\n\nConvert the letter grades earned in all A-G courses completed between summer after 9th grade through summer after 11th grade to grade points: A=4 points, B=3 points, C=2 points, D=1 points. (Pluses and minuses don't count.)\n\nIf you're a California resident and want to know which of your classes count as A-G courses, see your high schoolâ€™s A-G course list. If you're not a California resident, referring to the A-G course list site (a database of UC-certified course lists in California schools) and the 15 college-preparatory course categories can provide guidance on the types of courses that have been UC-approved.\n\n2. Give yourself an extra point for each semester of a UC honors-level course, with a maximum of 8 points between 10th and 11th grades.\n\nFor California residents:\n\nHonors courses are Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate Higher Level (IB HL) and designated Standard Level (IB SL) courses, UC-transferable college courses and UC-certified honors courses that appear on your school's course list.\n\nFor 10th grade, you cannot use more than 4 honors points.\n\nGrades of D or F in an honors course do not earn an extra point.\n\nClasses taken during the summer after 9th grade count as 10th grade; classes in summer after 10th grade count as 10th grade; classes in summer after 11th grade count as 11th grade.\n\nOne college course = one grade = one honors point.\n\nNonresidents:\n\nIn calculating an out-of-state student's GPA to determine if the 3.4 minimum has been met, UC will grant honors weight for AP or IB courses only, but not for school-designated honors courses. The weight is given to letter grades of A, B, or C. School-designated honors courses may be considered in the campus comprehensive review process.\n\n3. Add up all the points to find out your total grade points.\n\n4. Divide your total grade points by the number of letter grades earned in courses taken between the summer after 9th grade through summer after 11th grade.\n\nThis is your UC GPA (for example: 3.57). Do not round up or down."
