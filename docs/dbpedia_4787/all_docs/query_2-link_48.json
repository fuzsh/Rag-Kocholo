        "text": "Today, the final books for my fall semester of 2024 came in the mail. This stack of books encompasses the Western Tradition, covering the ancient, modern, and Christian pillars of the west. My classes this upcoming semester will be conducted Socratic Seminar style, with close readings of these texts, engaging with the important questions that they produce. Yet, this type of education is not found just anywhere, in fact it’s quite rare to find in most colleges and universities today. Thankfully, the The Honors College of Belmont Abbey College provides this form of classical liberal arts education- the one that so many great thinkers, leaders, and teachers have been formed by. If you’re a student or a parent- consider coming to or sending your child to the Honors College at Belmont Abbey. It’s an education like no other that seeks to do what education should do- induce the human person to virtue and happiness.\n\nIn his essay in The Raised Hand: “Rediscovering Beauty in the Classroom: Going Beyond Educational Standards,” Professor and author Kevin Gary of Valparaiso University reflects on education as a quest that involves much more than imparting measurable competencies. We invite you to read this compelling third essay in our series addressing the question, “What has the university to do with the good life?” at https://lnkd.in/en3akzrM\n\nJust published from Katie Martin: \"We must ensure our view of success aligns with the realities of our world and the future where our students will live, work, and learn...From industry partners to educators, parents, and policymakers, we all have a role to play in shaping the future of our education system. By bridging the gap between academics and lifelong skills, we can better prepare our students for success in both their academic endeavors and their future careers.\" Read the full article: https://hubs.ly/Q02sYmMs0\n\nThe rigid and short-sighted structures of contemporary education have left our society bereft of the wisdom it needs today more than ever.

She then said \"I had never heard of this co-curriculum, didn't even know it existed. I'd like to talk with you about it.\" I assured her that we will indeed talk about it. Co-curriculum? It's a bureaucratic construct that enables non-faculty to posture as faculty and funnel a lockstep ideological message to undergraduates through fake courses, such as seminars called \"difficult dialogues\" and \"courageous conversations.\" The \"co-curriculum\" is one of the chief vehicles on the college campus through which leftist thought reform is inflicted on students. If called on it, partisans point to benign \"co-curriculum\" examples such as rock-climbing or cooking classes, which can indeed be part of such a bureaucracy. Call it cover.\n\nRegistration is now open for our free Michigan Conference on Introductory History Courses, September 20 and 21 at Oakland University in Rochester. What skills and support do today’s students need to thrive on college campuses? How can all educators help students succeed in the transition from K-12 to post-secondary studies? What are we trying to achieve in introductory history courses in Michigan in high school and college?"
