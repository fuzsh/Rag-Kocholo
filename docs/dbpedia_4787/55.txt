It is my honor to welcome you to the online version of our outstanding school community. What you will see as you explore our deep and comprehensive website are glimpses of the brilliance that Berkeley Preparatory School offers daily to the students and families with whom we work, and a suggestion of the stellar professional community that we have collectively formed. You will see testament, in words, pictures, and videos, to our rich and broad program, our rigor and community engagement, our passion and commitment, optimism and positive energy, respect, kindness, and desire for excellence. You will see on display copious evidence that our core values—Discipline, Diligence, and Integrity—ring as true throughout our school culture today as they did when the school was founded in 1960. And you will see that we are all most proud of the fact that we really do put people in the world who make a positive difference. Guided by our mission statement, Berkeley is driven to provide the best possible environment for the children in our care; that, too, will be clear as you explore our site.

Of course, this is just a website, and as thorough as it might be, it is not the same as being here. I certainly hope that you will be intrigued and excited by what you see, and that as a result you will come visit us; we look forward to the opportunity to host you here for a tour and some rich conversation. Welcome to Berkeley!
