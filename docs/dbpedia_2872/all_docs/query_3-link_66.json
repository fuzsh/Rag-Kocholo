        "text": "AWS Security Blog\n\nTag: Automated reasoning\n\nIntroducing IAM Access Analyzer custom policy checks\n\nJuly 12, 2024: AWS has extended custom policy checks to include a new check called Check No Public Access. This new check determines whether a resource policy grants public access to a specified resource type. In addition to this new check, there has been an update to the existing Check Access Not Granted check. The […]\n\nHow we designed Cedar to be intuitive to use, fast, and safe\n\nThis post is a deep dive into the design of Cedar, an open source language for writing and evaluating authorization policies. Using Cedar, you can control access to your application’s resources in a modular and reusable way. You write Cedar policies that express your application’s permissions, and the application uses Cedar’s authorization engine to decide which […]\n\nValidate access to your S3 buckets before deploying permissions changes with IAM Access Analyzer\n\nAWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Access Analyzer helps you monitor and reduce access by using automated reasoning to generate comprehensive findings for resource access. Now, you can preview and validate public and cross-account access before deploying permission changes. For example, you can validate whether your S3 bucket would allow public access before deploying your […]\n\nNew! Streamline existing IAM Access Analyzer findings using archive rules\n\nAWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Access Analyzer generates comprehensive findings to help you identify resources that grant public and cross-account access. Now, you can also apply archive rules to existing findings, so you can better manage findings and focus on the findings that need your attention most. You can think of archive rules as […]\n\nHow to automatically archive expected IAM Access Analyzer findings\n\nAWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Access Analyzer continuously monitors your Amazon Web Services (AWS) resource-based policies for changes in order to identify resources that grant public or cross-account access from outside your AWS account or organization. Access Analyzer findings include detailed information that you can use to make an informed decision about whether access […]\n\nIAM Access Analyzer flags unintended access to S3 buckets shared through access points\n\nCustomers use Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) buckets to store critical data and manage access to data at scale. With Amazon S3 Access Points, customers can easily manage shared data sets by creating separate access points for individual applications. Access points are unique hostnames attached to a bucket and customers can set distinct permissions using […]\n\nAWS Security Profile: Byron Cook, Director of the AWS Automated Reasoning Group\n\nByron Cook leads the AWS Automated Reasoning Group, which automates proof search in mathematical logic and builds tools that provide AWS customers with provable security. Byron has pushed boundaries in this field, delivered real-world applications in the cloud, and fostered a sense of community amongst its practitioners. In recognition of Byron’s contributions to cloud security […]\n\nAWS Security Profile: Rustan Leino, Senior Principal Applied Scientist\n\nI recently sat down with Rustan from the Automated Reasoning Group (ARG) at AWS to learn more about the prestigious Computer Aided Verification (CAV) Award that he received, and to understand the work that led to the prize. CAV is a top international conference on formal verification of software and hardware. It brings together experts […]\n\nAWS Security Profile: John Backes, Senior Software Development Engineer\n\nAWS scientists and engineers believe in partnering closely with the academic and research community to drive innovation in a variety of areas of our business, including cloud security. One of the ways they do this is through participating in and sponsoring scientific conferences, where leaders in fields such as automated reasoning, artificial intelligence, and machine […]"
