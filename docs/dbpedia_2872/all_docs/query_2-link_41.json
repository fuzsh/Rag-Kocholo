        "text": "Interview with Cam Schuelke:\n\n\"It's been amazing. It's been a dream come true. It's something I've hoped for since I was a little kid. I've just been trying to take it in. It's all a little too surreal.\"\n\n\"I sat there and waited until I actually saw my name pop up. Once I saw it pop up it was really surreal. I didn't know how to feel. It was like 'Oh my god, I actually just got drafted.\"\n\nSchuelke played his final season at Mississippi State making 32 appearances, finishing with a 5-3 record and a 4.21 ERA in 47 innings. He had 47 strikeouts allowing 41 hits and 22 earned runs.\n\nThe Byron Center alum started his career at Flordia Gulf Coast as a walk-on and redshirted. He transferred to Northwood University for the 2022 season before playing at the College of Central Flordia for his sophomore season.\n\nSchuelke played baseball at Byron Center High School graduating in 2020. He was selected to the West All-Star Team, a pair of All-Conference selections, an All-District nod and an All-Region selection."
