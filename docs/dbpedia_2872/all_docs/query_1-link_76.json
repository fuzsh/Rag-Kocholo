        "text": "Time for the week that was in Texas politics with Texas Tribune editor-in-chief Emily Ramshaw.\n\nRetiring state Rep.Byron Cook responded to Gov. Greg Abbott’s letter directing state agencies to go through the governor’s office before publishing any new rules. Cook said that Abbott’s direction could be unconstitutional.\n\n“I think what he’s trying to do is light a fire under the remaining members of the legislature,” Ramshaw says.\n\nFormer University of Texas Chancellor William McRaven made headlines this week after writing an op-ed column in the Washington Post criticizing President Donald Trump for revoking former CIA director John Brennan’s security clearance.\n\nSen.Ted Cruz released TV ads last week, including some negative ones. In response, Beto O`Rourke released his own TV ads.\n\n“It’s interesting because Beto O`Rourke had before seemed not that interested in TV ads,” Ramshaw says."
