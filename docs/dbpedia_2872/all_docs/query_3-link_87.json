        "text": "Happy 26th Anniversary to Chancy and Jennifer Burrage Branning! The couple spent their anniversary on the campaign trail, where she is running for the state Supreme Court. She is currently our state Senator. Best wishes for more happy years!\n\n~\n\nThe Miss Neshoba County contestants gathered at the Hicks's cabin for a pre-pageant party which also commemorated Hattie Hicks’s crowning exactly one year from the date.\n\nIt was a fun event with a sweet favor of large crown-shaped cookies frosted with hearts and Miss NCF written on them in frosting. They were wrapped in a clear paper bag with a Bible verse printed on a card and Hattie's name and Miss NCF enclosed with colorful ribbon ties. The girls came after practice for the evening and, after eating a luscious buffet meal, spilled out onto the porch to visit and enjoy the pre-Fair ambiance.\n\n~\n\nThe historic Holy Cross Catholic church was the site for the baptism of precious Coleman Archer Cox, the son of Marshall and Gina Cox. His Godparents are Elliot and Mallory Goorley.\n\nColeman wore an exquisite, long white christening gown made by his great-grandmother, Frances Marshall, and worn by all of her great-grandchildren. The twins each wore part of the gown, Ben Allen wore the gown, and Lela the slip. All six names of her great grandchildren are embroidered on the slip with the date of the christening and “Handmade by Frances Marshall.”\n\nThis is truly of heirloom quality to be passed down to each generation for baptisms.\n\nAfter the baptism, a reception was held at the Marshall’s Fair cabin for family and friends, who were delighted to sample candied pecans, frosted cookies with his name on them, and cheese straws, along with champagne and punch. Guests brought gifts to Coleman which his parents opened happily.\n\nColeman’s grandparents are Tommy and Lee Ann Cox, maternal grandparents Richard and Meg Goorley, great grandparents Frances Marshall and the late Ben Marshall, Shirley Cox, and the late Tom Cox, aunts Terri Cox McCarver and Carla Cox Martin, and many other aunts, uncles, and cousins whom he will meet as he grows older through many future Fairs and family gatherings! What a fortunate baby to grow up with such a loving extended family!\n\n~\n\nThe Philadelphia Public School Board and Superintendent, Dr. Shannon Whitehead, announced the new principal of Philadelphia Elementary School, Mrs. Danielle Spurlock. She is a native of Philadelphia and attended the Philadelphia Public Schools. She has served in many leadership roles within the district, including interim principal of PHS, Assistant Principal of PMS, PHS, middle school teacher, and basketball coach. She has a BS in Criminal Justice with a minor in Spanish from the University of Mississippi, and a Master of Education and Psychology from MSU, and an Education Specialist Degree also from MSU. Congratulations, Mrs. Spurlock!\n\n~\n\nHoly Cross Catholic Church has held mass on the first Sunday at the Fairgrounds in the Tullos family’s cabin next to the race track for many years. Each year, it’s a special event held inside the cabin, and as the crowd grew, on the porch of the cabin and now overflowing into the space in front of it.\n\nThis year's Mass was exceptional because Father Tristan Stovall, who was ordained earlier this spring, celebrated the Mass. He and Byron Tullos have been lifelong friends. Byron was so excited and honored to have Tristan celebrate the Mass. Father Jofin George, the pastor of Holy Cross, was also assisted. It is a lovely service with an altar set up in front of the porch facing the congregation. This year's attendance was the highest, with a total of 91. Thank you to the Tullos family, who generously offered their cabin for the church service!"
