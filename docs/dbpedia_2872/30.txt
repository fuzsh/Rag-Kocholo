“Section 551.023 of the Texas Government Code, a “person in attendance may record all or any part of an open meeting of a governmental body by means of a recorder, video camera, or other means of aural or visual reproduction.” The statute also notes that a legislative body may adopt “reasonable” rules, such as the location of recording equipment or the manner in which the recording is conducted but cannot “prevent or unreasonably impair a person” from the rights granted under Subsection A — the right to record an open meeting,” reported the Waxahachie Daily Light.

The story gives the rundown of how Representative Byron Cook had Waxahachie ISD school board candidate Amy Hedtke removed from an open House State Affairs Committee meeting because she was filming. Chairman Cook made up his own rule that in his hearing only Capitol credentialed media could record the meeting – completely contrary to state law.

Byron “Obama” Cook, order DPS troopers to remove her; she was handcuffed; she was physically carried out of the Capitol by troopers; put in a patrol car; and then charged with a criminal count of trespass and resisting arrest. Fortunately a magistrate immediate dismissed the resisting charge because there was no evidence for such.

Rightly, Amy Hedtke is planning to file a lawsuit and is raising money for such through FundedJustice.com.

Byron “Obama” Cook is one of Speaker Straus’ top-captains in the House and his actions are emblematic of the petty arrogance with which our House is being run. Cook should be arrested, cuffed, and charged with a crime of impersonating a human being.
