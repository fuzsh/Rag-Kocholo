''You know how when you go on a date and the first 15 minutes are on automatic pilot?'' Stephanopoulos told The New York Times in 2001.

''About 15 minutes in, she just leaned in and said something, and we were suddenly in another place, in another universe, immediately.

"We went from strangers to friends to being in love in days.''

Wentworth had initially been reluctant to meet Stephanopoulos.

"I said, no, thank you. Not interested. Not my type. I grew up in politics in DC, like, no,‚Äù she told Jimmy Fallon in 2017.

She would eventually meet Stephanopoulos at Barneys in New York City.
