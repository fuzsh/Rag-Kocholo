        "text": "This article originally appeared in the March 2012 issue of Architectural Digest.\n\nSpeaking before thousands doesn’t cause me an ounce of anxiety. But moving? I’m on the floor, panic-stricken. Two years ago my husband, George Stephanopoulos, and I had finally settled into the Colonial Revival house in Washington, D.C., that we’d bought in 2005. There was no more trim to paint, and we had enough throw pillows to cushion all of Uzbekistan. Having just signed a book deal with HarperCollins [Ali in Wonderland is in stores now], I was spending my days in sweatpants, eating Milk Duds in my home office. Then George got the call confirming that he would be taking over as coanchor of *Good Morning America—*which meant I would have to quickly relocate him, our daughters, Elliott and Harper, and myself to New York City. I didn’t leave my bed for days, except to get more Milk Duds.\n\nI come from a long line of strong women—my grandmother built a boat out of yak hides and crossed China’s Yellow River—so surely I could move my family, two dachshunds included, to Manhattan. No more than a tiny percentage of our possessions would fit into a New York apartment, but that was just as well: The only things worth saving, I decided, were photographs, some cherished works of art, and maybe a hot plate. Excited at the prospect of a clean slate, I wondered how we could evolve beyond our humble domicile toward a more sophisticated home.\n\nEnter decorator [Michael S. Smith]https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/michael-s-smith-james-costos-palm-springs-home-article). I had always worshipped his designs and studied his monographs as though they were religious manuscripts. A mutual friend had introduced us when Michael was in D.C. outfitting the Obama White House, and we became instant confidants, sharing sandwiches as I tagged along with him to antiques shops. Our e-mails are always in shorthand, and one day an exchange went:\n\n“George and I are definitely moving to New York.”\n\n“Great! I’ll do your apartment.”\n\n(Cue Handel’s “Hallelujah Chorus.”)\n\n1 / 9\n\nWhen I first brought Michael to see our new place—a three-bedroom prewar on the Upper East Side—it had the sad visage of a lady stripped of all her makeup and jewelry. Hangers were strewn on the floor; rectangles of dirt remained where rugs had been. He walked around, in his cashmere jacket and ironed jeans, knocking on walls and cabinetry. It might not have been an Arabian palace, but the floor plan required no changes. George and I offered no direction at all, happy to have Michael wave his traditionalist magic wand. Sure enough, he did the equivalent: pulled out his cell phone, called his office, and started executing a plan.\n\nOnce our bare necessities had arrived from D.C., I got down to business on my writing, breaking to watch wallpaper and light fixtures being installed around me. It was a delightful jolt, during these stationary hours, to get Michael’s e-mails full of furniture and rug options. Against my better judgment I sent back ideas of my own, only to be met with such fertile responses as, “Oh, for your dorm room?” When you work with a prolific aesthete, I realized, it’s best to keep your pedestrian two cents to yourself and stick to more familiar topics, like soup and Labradoodles.\n\nThe 14th chapter of my book was nearly complete the day Michael rented a crane to hoist large furniture from the street through the living room window. Not being a native New Yorker, this was a first for me. In came a sectional sofa covered in rust-color velvet, a Swedish settee, and a pair of George II–style mahogany bookcases. When a mysterious piece of lacquer chinoiserie floated up, I stared at it blankly and asked, “Michael, what is this for? Dim sum?” The next day he organized our books and blue-and-white pottery on what I now know to be a pagoda étagère. It has become a spectacular showpiece in our foyer, which was tiled with stone in a graphic mosaic pattern of Michael’s design.\n\nWhen the apartment was done, after just six months, the results left me in awe. The airlifted furniture lends European flair to the place, especially in the living room, where pieces are arranged on a Bibikabad carpet around a marble mantel. I still can’t stop pawing the Venetian-plaster walls, which extend into the adjacent dining room, anchored by a Regency table and set of George III ladder-back chairs. And our master suite, with its hand-painted wallpaper and Italian neoclassical walnut bed, is exquisite.\n\nIt’s rare that a person exceeds expectations, but Michael certainly did—creating an exceptionally warm, cultured, and beautiful home for my family.\n\nNow if he could just get me out of these sweatpants.\n\nRelated: See More Celebrity Homes in AD"
