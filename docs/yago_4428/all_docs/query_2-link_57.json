        "text": "LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA: 'Good Morning America' host George Stephanopoulos has remained absent from the morning show for a whole week, making the viewers quite concerned. Amid his absence, his wife, actress Ali Wentworth was found traveling while it seems that George hasn't tagged along with her.\n\nWentworth took to social media to share a couple of photos from her trip, but George was nowhere to be seen. This has certainly caused a stir among the 'GMA' fans, who speculate that the couple might be facing trouble in their marriage.\n\nWas George Stephanopoulos absent from Ali Wentworth's trip?\n\nWentworth recently shared two Instagram posts sharing to her fans that she has been traveling across Greece with the geotag set as \"Spetses Island Greece.\" The photos show a set of beautiful and unique shells along with some stones that she probably collected from her visits to the Greek beaches. While George was not a part of these pictures, Wentworth didn't share any of her own either. So it's not confirmed yet if she was joined by her husband or anyone else on her trip.\n\nAround a week ago, the actress shared a picture of her sitting on a potter's wheel, and many of her followers pointed out that it was quite reminiscent of a scene from the 90s classic romance film 'Ghost'. In the photo captioned \"Mood!,\" Wentworth is seen sporting a pair of jeans and a shirt along with an apron, which is sprayed all over with clay. Her followers even commented asking her to reenact the romantic scene with her husband, George.\n\nGeorge Stephanopoulos' strange absence from 'GMA'\n\nGeorge has been mysteriously absent from the morning show for all of last week, and the 62-year-old host was replaced by Whit Johnson on the panel for each of his absences. As of now, no one knows when he will be returning to the show. Moreover, the reason behind George's disappearance is yet to be officially announced.\n\nNothing has been revealed about the couple's marital status or about any problems that they might be having as of yet. However, Wentworth did share an adorable throwback of George for Father's Day with children Elliott Anastasia Stephanopoulos and Harper Andrea Stephanopoulos back when they were little. The caption said, \"Lucky us! Happy Father’s Day to all the Dads…,\" and the photo showed Geroge cuddling with the two children on a chair. Other than that, the last time Wentworth shared a picture with George was on June 10, captioning it \"Date night….\""
