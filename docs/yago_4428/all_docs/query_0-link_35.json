        "text": "George Stephanopoulos has been exposed by his own wife, Ali Wentworth, for wearing boxers during previous Good Morning America broadcasts.\n\nThe talk show host's hidden secret was revealed on Thursday, August 25, after Wentworth accidentally slipped up while guest co-hosting Live with Kelly and Ryan. The 57-year old has been subbing in for Kelly Ripa while she is away on vacation.\n\nThe NSFW reveal came moments after Ryan Seacrest commented on his guest host's casual choice of clothing. The American Idol host sported a suit and tie, while Wentworth stepped out in a pair of blue jeans.\n\nStemming from the talk of Wentworth's casual businesswear came the reveal of Stephanopoulos' embarrassing secret.\n\n\"I don’t know about you, but George was in his boxers half the time on GMA,” exposed the Nightcap actress. Wentworth went on to clarify the GMA host only did this when working from home during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSAVANNAH GUTHRIE ABSENT FROM 'TODAY,' GOES ON FAMILY TRIP AS BUZZ OVER DRAMA WITH HODA KOTB CONTINUES\n\nSeacrest was too shocked to understand what had just slipped out of his guest host's mouth.\n\n\"He was anchoring the news and he was only wearing the button-down and jacket?” asked the media personality after being left nearly speechless.\n\nNot only did Wentworth expose her husband's secret, but she confirmed it a second time, stating he was in fact delivering \"hard-hitting news\" with only boxers beneath his business top-half attire.\n\nWentworth further backed her husband up, defending how he \"could\" host GMA in his underwear, at the time, because the broadcasts were being taped from his home through Zoom.\n\nDespite finding comfort in starring on the popular talk show while wearing boxers, the news anchor hasn't always had such a relaxing ride.\n\nWENDY WILLIAMS NOT FOLLOWING SON KEVIN HUNTER JR. ON INSTAGRAM AFTER IT EMERGED HE CHARGED $100K TO MOM'S AMEX\n\nStephanopoulos had a rocky road in the past with ABC, after threatening to leave the broadcast network in March 2021 due to a feud between the GMA host and his coworker David Muir regarding the \"chief anchor\" title..\n\nDisney executive chairman Bob Iger settled the tension by working out a contract extension and pay raise deal that would allow the network \"to have two big stars and build towards the future.\""
