        "text": "Vintage gossip:\n\n“Name-George Stephanopolous Dirt-according to a former neighbor, he is pimply, grimy, and tiny; same neighbor also saw him with a frequent visitor, a tall slender brown haired guy; gay but married, had affair with mail personal trainer; described by Hilary Clinton as a little queen; likes to cruise guys at the gym;Bebe Neuwerth is a former girlfriend, but supposedly never spent the night at his place; had a very hot gay affair right up until he got married”\n\n“Name-Alexanda Wentworth Dirt-cheapskate, returned flower arrangements to florist after wedding for full refund; married to the nelly acting George Stephanopoulos More dirt-allows husband to have gay affairs ”. (I did love her Starz show “Head Case”. That shit was hilarious.)\n\nr20 still not as bad as Mika and Joe vacationing together secretly outside of NYC but pretending to be in different studios/countries forcing MSNBC to send two separate crews to handle their segments even though they were in the same building, feet away from each other. He would take the traditional background, Mika would get a random one. MSNBC finally put a stop to that nonsense and they went \"public\" with their relationship.\n\nI still get a kick out of that story.\n\n[quote] His wife, Ali Wentworth, says she and Stephanopoulos have so much sex, she’s “lost friends” over it.\n\n[quote]In her new book, “Go Ask Ali,” the actress/comedian — who has been married to the broadcaster for 17 years — says that when she reveals to pals how often she and her newshound beau get it on, they’re invariably furious.\n\n[quote]She adds in the witty advice book, out April 24 from Harper, that she feels left out at “ladies’ lunches” because she can’t join the others in complaining about their terrible marriages.\n\n[quote] She recalls, “The absolute lowest moment for me is when the time arrives for the fateful question: ‘How often do you and your husband have sex?’ I have lost friends with this question.”\n\n[quote]She writes that before answering, she “takes a deep breath” and “spit[s] it out. And then the women gasp and scream like I’ve confessed that I shot my dog. One of them always slams her fist down on the table; a woman’s wine glass once smashed in her hand. I’m sorry! We’re hot for each other. Jesus!”\n\nThe lady doth protest too much, methinks. She's just like Hargitay, who never misses an opportunity to remind the world about how perfect her marriage is.\n\nThey have a new-ish townhouse in Georgetown just off M. They've featured it in decorating mags.\n\nJust cause her ancestors had money does not mean she has it.\n\nI worked with George eons ago when he was the LD for a congressman and I was a lobbyist. He was very nice and helpful."
