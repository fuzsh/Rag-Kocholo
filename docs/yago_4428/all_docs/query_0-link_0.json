        "text": "George Stephanopoulos and Ali Wentworth fell in love quickly after meeting on a blind date.\n\nA friend of Wentworth and ex-girlfriend of Stephanopoulos set the two up in 2001, though the comedian wasn't initially interested in dating someone who worked in politics.\n\n\"I grew up in D.C. around politics, so this was not sexy to me,\" Wentworth told PEOPLE in 2018. She eventually agreed to have lunch with him, telling Jimmy Fallon during a 2017 appearance on The Tonight Show she thought a date with the political commentator would make a \"good dinner party story.\" However, the meet-up led to the beginning of forever for the couple.\n\nStephanopoulos and Wentworth got engaged within two months of dating and married that same year before welcoming daughters Elliott and Harper in 2002 and 2005, respectively.\n\n\"Even that [marriage] felt like tick tock, mister. What's the hold up?\" Wentworth recalled to PEOPLE in 2018. \"I was just like, let's get married. Let's start our lives together.\"\n\nSince then, she has supported his career, moving their family when he became a co-anchor on ABC's Good Morning America in 2009.\n\nFrom their whirlwind engagement to sweet birthday tributes, here's everything to know about George Stephanopoulos and Ali Wentworth's relationship.\n\nApril 2001: George Stephanopoulos and Ali Wentworth meet on a blind date\n\nAfter her friends encouraged her to start dating, a mutual friend of Stephanopoulos and Wentworth set them up on a blind date.\n\n\"I had a birthday party, all girls, and everyone said, 'You know, you have to start dating, Ali.' And I said, 'You know what, I live in L.A., it's either agents or actors — I'm not interested,' \" Wentworth said on The Tonight Show in 2017. \"One of them said, 'You should go out with my old boyfriend, George Stephanopoulos.' And I said, 'No, thank you.' \"\n\nThe Nightcap star eventually agreed to meet the former political advisor, but she revealed that she didn't even bother to shower or shave her legs for the occasion.\n\n\"I came in, we sat down, we both ordered the crab salad,\" she said. \"And, I'm telling you, by the end of lunch, [it was] done.\"\n\nAs for Stephanopoulos' first impression, he told The New York Times he was also smitten — so much so he forgot to eat his lunch. The outlet also reported that Stephanopoulos knew within 24 hours that he didn't want to risk losing Wentworth.\n\n\"You know how when you go on a date and the first 15 minutes are on automatic pilot? About 15 minutes in, she just leaned in and said something, and we were suddenly in another place, in another universe, immediately,\" he explained. \"We went from strangers to friends to being in love in days.\"\n\nJune 2001: George Stephanopoulos and Ali Wentworth get engaged\n\nStephanopoulos and Wentworth wasted no time, with the This Week host proposing just two months after their first date.\n\n\"We planned a trip to Greece, and I had a ring made, and I think she knew,\" he told PEOPLE in 2018.\n\nWentworth added, \"I did know! I knew that you had the ring made because you were meeting your cousin for breakfast, and he was a jeweler. I knew it was in your backpack!\"\n\nNovember 20, 2001: George Stephanopoulos and Ali Wentworth get married\n\nStephanopoulos and Wentworth tied the knot on Nov. 20, 2001, at the Greek Orthodox Archdiocesan Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in New York City. According to The New York Times, Stephanopoulos' father, Rev. Dr. Robert G. Stephanopoulos, conducted the ceremony.\n\n\"George and I had a traditional Greek wedding, which included Greek dancing,\" Wentworth told PEOPLE in 2023, reflecting on their nuptials.\n\n\"One of my favorite memories from that event was watching these circles of people we loved, arm-in-arm, kicking their legs up to Greek music — the director Mike Nichols next to George's grandmother next to an 8-year-old flower girl next to my college roommate.\"\n\nSeptember 9, 2002: George Stephanopoulos and Ali Wentworth welcome their first child together\n\nStephanopoulos and Wentworth welcomed their first daughter, Elliott Anastasia, on Sept. 9, 2002. Their daughter's first name, Elliott, was Wentworth's great-grandmother's maiden name, according to New York Daily News.\n\nJune 2, 2005: George Stephanopoulos and Ali Wentworth welcome their second daughter\n\nThe former political aide and actress celebrated the arrival of their second child, a daughter named Harper Andrea, on June 2, 2005. She was born in Washington, D.C., at 6 lbs. 9 oz., 19 inches — the same weight and height as her older sister, Elliott.\n\nStephanopoulos and Wentworth typically kept their daughters out of the public eye as they were growing up.\n\n2010: George Stephanopoulos and Ali Wentworth relocate to N.Y.C.\n\nAfter Stephanopoulos was offered a co-anchor position on Good Morning America in 2009, the family moved from Washington, D.C., to N.Y.C.\n\nTheir city apartment was a change from their previous Colonial Revival house, so the couple enlisted the help of designer Michael S. Smith, who decorated the White House for former President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama.\n\nAccording to a March 2012 article Wentworth wrote for Architectural Digest, she and Stephanopoulos had to downsize and quickly relocate their daughters and dachshunds.\n\nDespite the immediate stress, the family moved into a three-bedroom prewar apartment on the Upper East Side, and they had help making it feel like a comfortable new beginning.\n\n\"When the apartment was done, after just six months, the results left me in awe,\" Wentworth wrote. \"It's rare that a person exceeds expectations, but Michael certainly did — creating an exceptionally warm, cultured and beautiful home for my family.\"\n\nJanuary 2013: George Stephanopoulos and Ali Wentworth play a game on Good Morning America\n\nIn 2013, Wentworth joined her husband on the set of GMA to play the \"Not So Newlywed Game,\" a segment testing couples on how well they know each other.\n\nStephanopoulos and Wentworth revealed they danced to Elton John's \"Your Song\" at their wedding and joked about their celebrity crushes — Marisa Tomei for Stephanopoulos and James Franco for Wentworth.\n\nJune 11, 2015: George Stephanopoulos and Ali Wentworth say they're open with their daughters about body image\n\nWentworth told PEOPLE in 2015 that she and Stephanopoulos try to be open with their daughters in an effort to teach them about healthy body image.\n\n\"I'm naked around my kids,\" she said. \"I don't parade, but they'll come in and talk to me in the shower ... I embrace it and teach them not to be ashamed of their bodies in general, no matter what they look like.\"\n\nHowever, Wentworth said that things were different for her as a child.\n\n\"I grew up in a household where we didn't talk about anything like that,\" she explained. \"As I got older, I thought, 'I don't think there's anything wrong with this.' All of that repressed WASPy stuff doesn't work for me.\"\n\nWentworth also said Stephanopoulos was \"on par\" with her about being honest with their children.\n\n\"We don't believe in lying to kids because I made a mistake when years ago our daughter was younger,\" she said. \"She came in and caught us [having sex]. And I said, 'Daddy's tickling me.' He said, 'We're making love.' And it was just like, 'Ahh, what's the right answer?' \"\n\nThe comedian continued, \"It turns out the right answer is what he said ... She knew he wasn't tickling me. So for me to lie to her makes her think like I'm ashamed of it or it's a bad thing.\"\n\nNovember 2016: George Stephanopoulos and Ali Wentworth discuss parenting\n\nSpeaking to former PEOPLE's former Editor-in-Chief Jess Cagle in 2016, Stephanopoulos revealed that he and his wife \"balance each other out\" when it comes to parenting.\n\n\"[He's] more of the disciplinarian ... but I'm the shopper. I'm the indulger,\" Wentworth said. \"But it works.\"\n\nShe added, \"He's organized in terms of family schedules, his schedule, my schedule, what's happening any given day. I have the pantry organized, and our underwear drawer is impeccable.\"\n\nDecember 28, 2016: George Stephanopoulos appears on Ali Wentworth's series, Nightcap\n\nWentworth created and starred in Pop's Nightcap for two seasons before the series ended in 2017. The comedy featured real-life celebrities on a fictitious late-night talk show, and Stephanopoulos appeared as one of the famous guests on season 1.\n\n\"About to get a big job offer on @Nightcap,\" Stephanopoulos shared on X (formerly known as Twitter) on Dec. 28, 2016, the same day his episode aired.\n\nApril 2018: Ali Wentworth says George Stephanopoulos has \"so much integrity\"\n\nWentworth opened up to PEOPLE in 2018 about what impressed her the most about Stephanopoulos when they first crossed paths.\n\n\"I was so blown away when I met him because he has so much integrity,\" she said. \"I went through a bad boy stage before him and I knew this was a man who wasn't going to cheat on me.\"\n\nWentworth went on to explain that she felt she could trust him to be a good partner.\n\nApril 2018: George Stephanopoulos and Ali Wentworth offer marital advice\n\nIn a joint interview with PEOPLE in April 2018, the husband and wife duo offered tips for a happy marriage.\n\n\"You just have to really come to terms with this idea that 'I'm going to be with this person forever,' \" Wentworth said.\n\nStephanopoulos added, \"You also have to learn how to fight.\"\n\nMay 26, 2018: George Stephanopoulos and Ali Wentworth host a wedding\n\nStephanopoulos and Wentworth hosted the wedding of PEOPLE's former Editor-in-Chief Cagle in 2018.

The couple's daughters, Elliott and Harper, were also at the ceremony.\n\nApril 2020: George Stephanopoulos and Ali Wentworth test positive for COVID-19\n\nIn early April 2020, Wentworth revealed she tested positive for COVID-19 and said she'd \"never been sicker.\" Later that month, Stephanopoulos announced he'd also tested positive for the virus but shared it hadn't affected him as much as his wife.\n\n\"It's funny because it's very indicative of our lives,\" Wentworth said in a virtual appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! \"I get corona, and I'm deathly ill for three weeks with a high fever and sweating and achy and going crazy like Martin Sheen in Apocalypse Now. And George gets it, and he has no symptoms.\"\n\nWentworth also posted an Instagram video of herself reuniting with her family after being in isolation for 16 days, with her husband and daughters clapping and cheering.\n\nJune 2, 2021: Ali Wentworth shares photo of George Stephanopoulos with their daughter Elliott on her prom night\n\nStephanopoulos and Wentworth celebrated another milestone as a family when their daughter Elliott went to prom in June 2021.\n\nOn Instagram, Wentworth posted a photo of the father and daughter standing side-by-side — the latter who wore a black gown for the big occasion.\n\n\"Prom night! That is not her date,\" Wentworth joked in the caption.\n\nJune 4, 2021: Ali Wentworth says George Stephanopoulos wanted to keep their relationship private\n\nWhile co-hosting an episode of Live with Kelly and Ryan in 2021, Wentworth acknowledged being more open about her relationship than Stephanopoulos.\n\n\"At the beginning of our marriage, there was a lot of 'Don't talk about this,' \" Wentworth told Ryan Seacrest on the daytime TV show. \"In fact, there was an event when we were first married ... Page Six wrote that George and I were getting divorced.\"\n\nShe continued, \"A Washington Post reporter got my cellphone number and called me and said, 'What do you think about what they wrote, that you and George are getting divorced?' I said, 'You show me a couple that has sex twice a day that's getting divorced,' which was my way of dealing with it.\"\n\nWentworth added that, at the time, Stephanopoulos was \"enraged\" by her comment. However, she said he'd become more accustomed to her openly discussing the intimate details of their marriage.\n\nNovember 2021: George Stephanopoulos and Ali Wentworth honor their 20th wedding anniversary\n\nIn honor of their two decades of marriage, Wentworth posted a throwback photo from their wedding day on Instagram, marking the occasion.\n\n\"20 years!!!!!!! And I'm still full of love and celebration!\" she wrote.\n\nJanuary 12, 2022: George Stephanopoulos and Ali Wentworth celebrate her birthday\n\nFor Wentworth's 57th birthday celebration, the Go Ask Ali podcast host shared a cozy photo on Instagram with her husband.\n\nIn the snap, Stephanopoulos wore a leopard print birthday hat and wrapped his arm around Wentworth. The birthday girl rocked a sparkly tiara as the two posed in front of a cake.\n\n\"That’s a wrap on this year's birthday,\" she captioned the image. \"Now back to cleaning up dog poop, taking rapid tests, laundry and endless Zooms.... Do better 2022!\"\n\nFebruary 28, 2022: Ali Wentworth reveals George Stephanopoulos' sweet birthday tradition\n\nWhen Wentworth co-hosted another episode of Live with Kelly and Ryan in 2022, she revealed Stephanopoulos keeps up the \"lost art\" of penning love letters on their birthdays.\n\n\"George still writes a letter to me and to each of our daughters every year on their birthdays,\" she said. \"So I have boxes since they were infants, of these 10-page letters ... It's actually very romantic. It's very, very sweet.\"\n\nMarch 28, 2023: George Stephanopoulos and Ali Wentworth hit the red carpet with daughters\n\nThe Stephanopoulos family attended the world premiere of Brooke Shields' documentary Pretty Baby in N.Y.C., with Wentworth and Shields posing for photos on the red carpet.\n\nStephanopoulos and Wentworth served as executive producers for the Hulu two-part documentary chronicling Shields' life as a model and actress.\n\nAfter Wentworth posted behind-the-scenes photos of the production on Instagram, Elliott commented, \"Best people all around❤️❤️congratulations.\"\n\nNovember 20, 2023: Ali Wentworth teases George Stephanopoulos on their 22nd wedding anniversary\n\nDuring Stephanopoulos' morning show time slot, on what happened to be the couple's 22nd anniversary, Wentworth sent a special video message into GMA.\n\n\"Happy anniversary, honey,\" Wentworth said in the clip. \"22 years ... 22 years of waking up on our anniversary alone in bed — only to watch you interview some beautiful actress on TV. I love you, come home.\"\n\nThe tease earned chuckles from the anchors and even made Stephanopoulos tear up.\n\nApril 25, 2024: Ali Wentworth says she and George Stephanopoulos are \"young and in love again\" after becoming empty nesters\n\nThe couple's two daughters have left the nest — and it's been an adjustment for Wentworth and Stephanopoulos."
