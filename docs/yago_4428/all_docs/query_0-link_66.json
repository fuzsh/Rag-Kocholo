        "text": "by contributor Courtney Cohen\n\nPhoto credit: Neshan H. Naltchayan\n\nSo, here’s a disclaimer: I worked for Ali Wentworth’s husband George Stephanopoulos for three years from 2007 to 2010. As a political junkie since childhood, moving to Washington to work for him at ABC News was literally a dream come true. (Ali Wentworth Pamela Sorensen Jason Kampf shown above)\n\nCourtney and Ali\n\nShe has an incredible sense of style, not just for gorgeous clothes but her home in Georgetown was one of the most beautiful places I’ve ever seen (check out March’s Architectural Digest to see shots of George and Ali’s New York digs).\n\nWhen George, Ali, their girls and the dogs moved to New York I was sad to not work for George any longer, but I was devastated that Ali was going too!\n\nFive years after I first met her while she was redecorating George’s office at ABC as a surprise for him, Ali has written one of the funniest memoirs I’ve ever read, Ali in Wonderland.\n\nShe describes the book as a love letter to her mother Muffie Cabot and fills the book with wonderful tales of growing up in Washington, D.C., summer internships in London, struggling as an actress in Los Angeles and then finding love and forming a family of her own with George."
