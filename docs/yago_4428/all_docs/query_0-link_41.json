        "text": "Ali Wentworth has tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nThe comedian and wife of ABC news anchor George Stephanopoulos confirmed her COVID-19 diagnosis on Instagram Wednesday, revealing that she’s “never been sicker.”\n\n“I have tested positive for the Corona Virus. I’ve never been sicker. High fever. Horrific body aches. Heavy chest. I’m quarantined from my family.”\n\nShe accompanied her health update with a solemn picture of herself lying in bed while sick, describing her battle with coronavirus as “pure misery.”\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Stephanopoulos revealed on “Good Morning America” that he would broadcast from home after Wentworth “developed some symptoms” consistent with COVID-19, although he didn’t confirm whether she had the virus or not.\n\n“Ali has developed some symptoms so she’s upstairs resting right now,” Stephanopoulos told his “GMA” co-hosts. “While she’s recovering as she goes through this, I’m going to be broadcasting from home and we’ll be working as long as we can.”\n\nThe couple share two daughters: Elliott, 17, and Harper, 14.\n\nOn her Instagram post, Wentworth urged everyone to “stay home” to limit the spread of the coronavirus, a similar message she shared last week while participating in the #istayhome challenge.\n\n“#istayhome for my parents, my in-laws, and all the health workers around the globe!” Wentworth captioned an Instagram post after being nominated by Julia Roberts.\n\nWentworth is the latest celebrity to contract the coronavirus, joining Tom Hanks, Rita Wilson, Idris Elba and many more who have come forward with their diagnoses.\n\nHer acting credits include “In Living Color,” “Seinfeld,” “Jerry Maguire,” “Office Space,” and “It’s Complicated.”"
