        "text": "Even though the comedian Ali Wentworth is creating television pilots and writing books (her most recent, “Happily Ali After,” was published on June 9), she still has creative energy to burn. “I’ll wake up in the middle of the night and paint a bathroom or bake 300 homemade chocolate chip cookies,” she said. Having worked in television (“In Living Color,” “Seinfeld” ) and film (“It’s Complicated,” “Office Space”), Ms. Wentworth, 50, has become accustomed to the ebbs and flows of show business. On Sundays, she and her husband, George Stephanopoulos, 54, chief anchor for ABC News, shed their professional personas. They have two daughters, Elliott, 12, and Harper, 9, and a couple of dogs. They live on the Upper East Side.\n\nDARK DEPARTURE My husband gets up at 2:30 in the morning every day to do “Good Morning America.” But he’ll sleep late, until 3:30, maybe 4, on Sunday, before he does “This Week.” Nobody’s up, but he has to kiss everybody goodbye. It’s dark, so he’s always looking for my face with his hand. I’m like, ‘Don’t kiss me. I know you love me.’ Then I fall back asleep.\n\nDOMESTIC DEMANDS If I were at the Peninsula Hotel in L.A., I’d sleep until 10 a.m. But my kids wake up. At 6:30, 7, my 9-year-old, I’m awakened by her face in my face, going, “I’m hungry, Mommy.” Then I, kind of blurry-eyed, go downstairs. It becomes a series of cleaning up dog pee — our 15-year-old dog, Charlie, who’s incontinent, is getting kind of blind so he misses the puppy pads — and the girls will rattle out a million things they want to eat. “I want pancakes.” “I want pancakes with chocolate chips.” “I want a smoothie.”\n\nNUMBER ONE FAN George comes home at 10 and he takes the girls to church, to the Greek Orthodox Church on East 74th. It’s George’s time with them. He was an altar boy; his father is a priest. It’s a great cultural connection. This is my one time of the week when everybody’s out of the apartment. I’m usually watching George’s show, answering emails, probably eating something. If it’s somebody that he’s champing at the bit to interview or somebody he’s conflicted about interviewing, I like to see how it finally came together. A few weeks ago he had the governor of Indiana on. It was a great interview and George was really pressing him. I suddenly wasn’t his wife anymore; I was somebody watching, screaming at the TV."
