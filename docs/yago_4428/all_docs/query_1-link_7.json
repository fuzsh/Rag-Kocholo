        "text": "George Stephanopoulos' wife Ali Wentworth has posted a poignant, and very peaceful, update on social media following what has been a hard time in their family.\n\nJust last weekend, Ali announced that George's beloved father had passed away, and the couple, along with their daughters Elliott, 21, and Harper, 19, attended his funeral last week.\n\nAnd on Saturday, Ali shared a new photo on Instagram focusing on their dog running along the sand, alongside a calm ocean wave.\n\nThe scene was taken at the beach in Sagaponack, Long Island. Ali chose not to caption the picture, but it spoke volumes to her fans, who were quick to check in on the star and George.\n\n\"You needed this!!\" one wrote, while another commented: \"Hope you are doing okay.\" A third added: \"Ahhh. It looks like a happy place.\"\n\nGeorge's father, Reverend Robert George Stephanopoulos, passed away aged 89 on June 19. The best-selling author and podcast star were on vacation in Europe at the time.\n\nShortly after Robert's passing, Ali took to Instagram to pay tribute to her father-in-law, giving an insight into his pivotal role in their family and the close bond they shared.\n\nShe wrote: \"Reverend Robert George Stephanopoulos, PhD, Dean Emeritus Archdiocesan Cathedral of the Holy Trinity passed away on June 19th. He was my father-in-law and I loved him dearly.\n\n\"He married us. He laughed with us. He debated our daughters. He praised my Thanksgiving turkey. He loved ice cream. He was everyoneâ€™s council. He married or baptized almost every Greek on the eastern seaboard. He was held in the highest regard. He will be missed by so many. Sagapo Father Bob.\"\n\nAli shared a number of photos of Reverend Robert to accompany her tribute, which were all taken from her and George's wedding day in 2001.\n\nGeorge's father married the couple, as they tied the knot just two months after getting engaged. The sad news follows on just a year after Robert's wife, Presvytera Nikki, died.\n\nRobert's touching obituary online reads in part: \"Over more than half a century in the ministry, Father Robert touched countless lives. He counseled young couples contemplating marriage, celebrated their weddings and baptisms, cried with them at the funerals of loved ones.\n\nHis legacy lives through them, his surviving children Mother Agapia, George, Marguarite and Andrew - his daughter in law, Alexandra Wentworth, and his grandchildren Elliott and Harper Stephanopoulos.\"\n\nLast week, George was the only main GMA anchor working, with both his co-stars Robin Roberts and Michael Strahan absent from the show. It is thought that both will return on Monday.\n\nHe was joined by a number of subs during the week, including Whit Johnson, Rebecca Jarvis and Mary Bruce, who joined the panel on Friday's show following the first live presidential debate between President Joe Biden and Donald Trump.\n\nGeorge was delighted to be joined by Mary, and was animated as they chatted. Mary and George go back a long way, with Mary working as a segment producer for George's show, This Week with George Stephanopoulos."
