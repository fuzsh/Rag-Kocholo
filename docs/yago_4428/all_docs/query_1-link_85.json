        "text": "Actress Ali Wentworth, ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos' wife, has tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nWentworth revealed her diagnosis on Instagram, saying she has \"never been sicker\" and calling the illness \"pure misery.\" She appeared in a video message on Good Morning America on Thursday, describing feeling \"very winded\" before she tested positive and experiencing tightness in her chest, as well as a fever.\n\n\"It feels like a really, really horrible flu,\" she explained, saying some of the things that have helped have been Tylenol, chicken soup, and hot baths.\n\nStephanopoulos on GMA said Wentworth was \"doing ok\" early this morning and that her fever was slightly down last night, although the symptoms have been going \"in cycles\" for her. Stephanopoulos also said he personally doesn't have symptoms and is \"definitely being careful\" while taking care of Wentworth, although he speculated about the potential that he, and many other New Yorkers, could have already contracted the coronavirus.\n\n\"At this point, it's just so hard to know,\" Stephanopoulos said. \"So many of us in New York City are already presumed to have had it. Right now, I have no symptoms. ... But, you know, I wonder myself whether I already had maybe a mild version and just didn't even know it. There's no way to know right now.\" Brendan Morrow"
