        "text": "GEORGE Stephanopoulos has spoken out about his wife, Ali Wentworth during a recent interview.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Good Morning America correspondent was a special guest on Late Night with Seth Meyers.\n\nDuring their discussion, Seth, 49, congratulated George, 62, on his 22nd wedding anniversary to Ali, 58 - as well as showing a picture of what the former White House Communications Director looks like when he's FaceTiming with his kids, Harper and Elliott.\n\nWhile holding up the hilarious snap, the late night host said: \"I don't know what she's trying to say here, it seems very passive-aggressive.\"\n\nGeorge laughed and said: \"Ya think?\"\n\nHalf of Ali's face was shown in the photo while her husband sat down in a chair and held his phone in his hands with a smile on his face.\n\nThe TV personality revealed that his two children are in college and will be coming back for the holidays.\n\nElliott attends Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, while Harper goes to Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nGeorge's recent comment comes after they revealed some devastating family news.\n\nWHAT HAPPENED?\n\nIn August, George and Ali shared the brutal news with their social media followers.\n\nThe Hollywood actress posted a photo of her and George's back to the camera on Instagram.\n\nThey were walking away from dropping Harper off at college.\n\n\"We dropped our baby off at college. Everyone is saying 'she’s ready to launch'!\" Ali captioned the post.\n\n\"But…I don’t think I’m ready! I don’t want to stop making pasta with vodka sauce, picking up wet towels, cuddling up to her familiar scent.\"\n\nShe went on: \"As Joni Mitchell once wrote- 'the bed’s too big, the frying pan too wide.' I know our daughter will thrive. But man, it’s brutal on the parents. If you feel inclined- please send me baked goods. I’ll be under my covers.\"\n\nALL SET!\n\nMeanwhile, as the holiday season is in full swing, the happy couple recently shared a photo of the two preparing for a big reunion with their two children.\n\nIn the pic, the lovebirds stood next to each other, as Ali leaned into George.\n\nThey appeared to be in their living room, which was dark and had bookcases behind them and a table in front of them.\n\nGeorge held onto a champagne bottle and four empty glasses sat on the table.\n\nThe GMA host wore khakis, a navy sweater, and a light blue button-down shirt underneath it.\n\nAli wore black dress pants, a black sweater, and a white shirt.\n\n\"Getting ready for our college girls to come home for the holidays. Need to squeeze and kiss them!\" she captioned the post.\n\nBEST CHILDREN EVER\n\nIn November, Harper and Elliott shared photos dedicated to George and Ali in celebration of their wedding anniversary.\n\nAli reposted them to her Stories.\n\nHarper's post included a throwback image that pictured Ali smiling behind George as she wrapped her arms around her husband.\n\nHe wore a big smile, which was very apparent even though he was looking down.\n\n\"22 years of marriage! Best out there,\" Harper captioned the photo.\n\nElliott shared George and Ali's wedding picture.\n\nShe said they were the \"best example of true love\" in her caption."
