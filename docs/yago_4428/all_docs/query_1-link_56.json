        "text": "George Stephanopoulos and Ali Wentworth were the definition of couple goals on a recent episode of Good Morning America. In a clip sent into the show from their couch, the duo sported cozy loungewear as they congratulated Robin Roberts on her impending nuptials.\n\nWentworth — who met the television host on a blind date in 2001 and married him later that same year — kicked off the video with a cheeky message to the GMA anchor and her fiancé, Amber Laign.\n\n“Robin and Amber, congratulations. You are about to embark on such an incredibly beautiful journey,” Wentworth began, before quipping, “We’ve been married for over 64 years and I have to say every day is unicorns and rainbows.”\n\nWhile the comedian was making her jokes, her husband was staring lovingly at her, before letting out a laugh at her sarcastic comment. He ended the video by telling Roberts, “We love you. I know it was worth the wait. Congratulations.”\n\nThe moment was later posted to GMA’s Instagram account, where many fans of the show took to the comments section to express their love for the longtime married couple.\n\n“I love the way George and Ali are with each other. Check it out people, that is what love looks like.❤️❤️,” one wrote, while another added, “That was so funny and sweet. I adore George and Ali.”\n\nA third person said, “George already knew Ali was going to say something crazy!” before someone else echoed, “Cutest couple ever. He never knows what she is going to say, he just rolls with whatever it is!! Just love them❤️🥰♥️”\n\n“I love how he looks at her 🥹,” another commented, while a fifth social media user added, “Unicorns and rainbows…😂 They are so funny and cute together!”\n\nTheir sweet message comes amid a week filled with wedding celebrations for Roberts — who is set to marry Laign this September, 18 years after they first met on a blind date in 2005. On Wednesday morning’s (Aug. 17) episode of the morning talk show, Roberts’ ABC family (and then some) transformed the studio into a beach-themed bachelorette party.\n\nRoberts first announced the news of her engagement on GMA in January of this year.\n\n“I’m hesitating because I haven’t said it out loud yet. I’m saying yes to marriage,” she revealed at the time. “We’re getting married this year. It’s something we’ve talked about but we had put it off. But it was just — and it is staying yes to that and that next chapter. I can’t believe I just said that.”\n\nGood Morning America airs every weekday at 7/6c on ABC."
