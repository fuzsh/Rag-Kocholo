Sign up here.\n\nJust as Ali Wentworth revealed that she's emerged from her coronavirus self-isolation, her husband, George Stephanopoulos, revealed that he tested positive for the virus.\n\nOn Monday, Wentworth, 55, shared a video on Instagram of herself walking down the stairs in her home while her family clapped and played \"Survivor\" by Destiny's Child.\n\nDEMI MOORE, BRUCE WILLIS HAVE A QUARANTINE-EDITION 'FAMILY BOOK CLUB'\n\n\"Came out of 16 days of isolation. I am grateful for my health. It was a brutal and scary time. But I am one of the lucky ones,\" Wentworth wrote in the caption. \"And as I continue to recover I am struck by what has become the dehumanization of this plague. People are dying. People are suffering. People are hungry. People are scared.\"\n\nThe actress encouraged fans to take \"each other's hands and move together united.\"\n\nShe continued: \"We can isolate to help others, particularly the incredible health workers and all the courageous and selfless people on the frontlines, but that does not mean we should isolate our hearts. (I know my daughters are screaming that this is so cringeworthy) Grateful to be back to everything except laundry and dishes...\"\n\nCAREY HART ON WIFE PINK, SON'S 'INTENSE' BATTLES WITH CORONAVIRUS: 'THEY BOTH GOT EXTREMELY SICK'\n\nWentworth, however, wasn't the only one in the household to contract the virus, as Stephanopoulos, 59, revealed that he'd also tested positive.\n\nStephanopoulos revealed his diagnosis on \"Good Morning America\" on Monday, disclosing that he didn't experience any symptoms.\n\n“I’ve never had a fever, never had chills, never had a headache, never had a cough, never had shortness of breath,” he said. “I’m feeling great.”\n\nThe television host explained that he did experience back pain one evening and a \"diminished sense of smell\" several days later, but wasn't sure whether to attribute that to the novel virus.\n\nStephanopoulos previously discussed caring for his wife on \"Good Morning America,\" explaining that he was careful to wear gloves and wipe down anything he touched after caring for Wentworth.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"
