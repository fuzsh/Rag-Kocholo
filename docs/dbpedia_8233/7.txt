Gretna have signed 21-year-old striker Brian Wake from Carlisle United.

And United team-mate Ryan Baldacchino has made his move to Raydale Park permanent after having spent the first half of season on loan to the Scottish Third Division club.

The 21-year-old Wake scored two goals this season for the side adrift at the bottom of English Division Three but had not made an appearance since November.

Leicester-born 22-year-old Baldacchino, formerly of Blackburn Rovers and Bolton Wanderers, has been a regular in the Gretna midfield this season.

The Bellshill-born 29-year-old midfielder started his professional career with Albion before heading for Swindon Town and Blackpool, joining non-league Morecambe in March.

Struggling East Stirlingshire have delved into the junior ranks to sign Cumbernauld United midfielder Brian Mulholland.

The 23-year-old has senior experience with Aston Villa and had a spell in the USA.

Elgin City have released defender John Gallagher and farmed out Andy Smith and John Mackay to the junior ranks.

Meanwhile, First Division Raith Rovers have lost the services of midfielder Steven Robb, who has returned to Dundee at the end of his loan spell, and striker Karl Hawley, now back at Walsall.

Goalkeeper Derek Soutar and defender Neil Jablonski are also back at Dens Park after ending their spell at Brechin City.
