Ryan Baldacchino, who has been an integral part of Gretna all season since his transfer from Carlisle, is confident the side can make it into the Bells Scottish Second Division.

But the Raydale Park team need to see off the challenge from second bottom Elgin City at Borough Briggs this afternoon if they are to stay in contention.

"I certainly think we are good enough to go up and victory this afternoon could put us right back in the race," declared Baldacchino. Derek Townsley, recently snapped up from Oxford, is set for his debut.
