        "text": "I \"averaged\" a man as he passed me and watched him as he drifted far down by the baldacchino and beyond--watched him dwindle to an insignificant school-boy, and then, in the midst of the silent throng of human pigmies gliding about him, I lost him.\n\nThe ashes of Peter, the disciple of the Saviour, repose in a crypt under the baldacchino. We stood reverently in that place; so did we also in the Mamertine Prison, where he was confined, where he converted the soldiers, and where tradition says he caused a spring of water to flow in order that he might baptize them.\n\nPope Francis has named Auxiliary Bishop Peter Baldacchino of Miami as the new bishop of Las Cruces, New Mexico.\n\nWaterway manager David Baldacchino said: \"We're so grateful to everybody who has helped whether that be through donating to our fundraising appeal or pitching in with clean-up and repair efforts.\"\n\nThe homilist will be Most Reverend Peter Baldacchino, Auxiliary Bishop, Archdiocese of Mami.\n\nIn her debut picture book, Christine Baldacchino introduces readers to the endearing and very imaginative character of Morris Micklewhite, who happens to march to the beat of his own drum.\n\nSpirituality has been defined as a concept which: encompasses all of an individual's aspects (Strang et al 2002; Reed 1992); is more comprehensive than religion (Rennick 2005; Baker 2003); involves both interpersonal relationships and those about the meaning of life, particularly at times of crisis and illness (Baldacchino 2006).\n\nMalta's political establishment, and to a lesser extent the European Parliament, are abuzz over the arrival of a new Maltese MEP, Claudette Abela Baldacchino.\n\nIn the tradition of Paulo Freire, the influential theorist of critical pedagogy, Baldacchino (dean, School of Art & Design at University College, Falmouth, UK) presents an analysis of art as an entree to discussing philosophical/political issues of modernity that goes beyond the tautology of \"is it art?' From readings on aesthetics and the concept of the artist as the child of his age, he argues that in doing art we give ourselves an exit, i.e., a degree of autonomy from the \"fascism of representation\" and historical contingency.\n\nThe pounds 4million Baldacchino Supreme bed features 107kg of solid 24ct gold with the option to customise the headboard with diamonds.\n\nWadsworth admitted a long journey for the Scottish Premier League clash was the last thing the administration-hit Borders club wanted after a week when John- Paul Kissock returned to Everton and Ryan Baldacchino moved to Australia."
