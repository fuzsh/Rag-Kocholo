        "text": "It takes discipline and courage to do this. Especially this time of the year. Kudos to my clients who on Wednesday will take a full day out of working IN their businesses to get together and work ON their business. They do this once a quarter at GrowthClub and reap the advantages. ðŸ‘‰ They look in the rear view mirror and evaluate the last three months in their business. What were the wins, the challenges, the learnings? What did they not achieve that they want to carry over to the next quarter? ðŸ‘‰ They are intentional about where they want their business to be at the end of Feb, and set no more than 3 business goals and one non business goal for this period. Focus is important. ðŸ‘‰ They decide on the actions they need to take to reach each goal, and schedule which weeks these will happen. In short, they leave the day with a 90 day Action Plan to achieve their goals for the next quarter. Every week in Dec, Jan and Feb, they check their 90 day Action Plan and make sure the important tasks planned for that week are scheduled. This ensures that they do not get so caught up in the daily operations that they do not invest time on the important activities to take their business to where they want it to be in 90 days time. And on the day there is plenty of learning from fellow business owners, all committed to working ON their business. #ActionPlan #businessowners #businesscoaching #ActionCoachAndy It's too late to attend our GrowthClub this week, but if you would like to know more about it and attend our February one, then comment or DM \"February\"to me.\n\nScenario: You're a founder, attending the Blackbird Sunrise Conference this week, and your focus is: finding funding, now. (Or, you're not attending, and that's your focus too) Meetings lined up. Investors to pitch. Decks to distribute. A gathering of 1000 people to network the hell out of and come away with some $$. However, the objective doesn't always mirror the outcome, as there is a lot going on this week, and many, many conversations. So, we've put an offer together for the occasion. During Sunrise, all you have to do is find one of our ðŸšœ team members (or ask around, we have plenty of partners and our own investors attending) and ask us the question: \"We have $X revenue per month and Y months of runway in reserve, and the next steps we are taking to grow our revenue again is Z. Can you fund me and for how much?\" Our offer is that we will let you know, on the spot, whether it is likely or not that we can fund you. The quickest 'likely', 'no', or 'maybe' you're ever likely to experience. Then you'll know, and you can continue on with the Sunrise Conference, and all those other chats to be had. If you're spending time out of the business, then we want to make sure it's worthwhile for you, and that means providing the most transparent way forward to the next decision. So, simply look for the Tractor merch. And you'll probably find our Co-Founders Matt Allen & Jodie Imam. Or Garry Williams ðŸšœ & Nick Rumpff. Or Kimia Marzban & Darragh McDonnell. Or Dan Siepen & Conor Sutherland. And maybe even a lego tractor to be given away. Last tickets to Sunrise: https://lnkd.in/gkd6UqA8"
