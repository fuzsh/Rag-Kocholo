        "text": "Tony Caig was with Hibs for two seasons\n\nScottish Premier League newcomers Gretna are set to sign Uruguayan midfielder Fabian Yantorno and former Hibernian goalkeeper Tony Caig.\n\nCaig, 33, has returned home from Vancouver Whitecaps for family reasons.\n\nYantorno, a 24-year-old midfielder capped at Under-17 and Under-21 levels, was available from Miramar Misiones in Uruguay's top flight.\n\nThe Montevideo-born player, who previously played for Bella Vista, was due to fly into Scotland on Monday.\n\nGretna started their pre-season training on Thursday and Yantorno will join the squad at their Preston base should he pass a medical.\n\nChief executive Graeme Muir explained that the signing was thanks to their director of club development.\n\n\"Mick Wadsworth has lots of contacts in the UK and beyond,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\nWe are hoping to do something that would be of benefit to Tony and his family\n\nGretna chief executive Graeme Muir\n\n\"And we are trying to create a young and vibrant team.\"\n\nCaig joined Vancouver last year after three seasons without a first-team appearance for Newcastle United.\n\nHe established a new league record of 11 clean sheets while helping Vancouver to the USL First Division Championship.\n\nBut the Englishman has returned home for family reasons just short of the end of his contract.\n\nAnd Gretna are in negotiations with Vancouver about the future of the goalkeeper who started his career with Carlisle United before heading for Blackpool, Charlton Athletic, Hibs then Newcastle.\n\n\"We are hoping to do something that would be of benefit to Tony and his family,\" said Muir.\n\n\"A goalkeeper of that experience would be great for Gretna.\"\n\nMeanwhile, midfielder Ryan Baldacchino says David Irons will have the full backing of the players should the assistant step up to become Gretna's new manager.\n\nGretna clinched promotion - and the Division One title - while Rowan Alexander was on sick leave.\n\nAnd it is expected that Irons, who had acted as caretaker, will soon be confirmed as his permanent successor.\n\n\"Rowan has done a tremendous job at the club and Davie has been there and done it as well,\" said 26-year-old Baldacchino.\n\n\"We don't really know the situation as of yet, but we're all behind Davie at the minute.\n\n\"All the lads know him from taking the training day to day and we're all quite comfortable with the situation at the moment.\n\n\"They are completely different personalities and they both have positive points in their own ways.\n\n\"Davie is closer to the players and will speak to you, while Rowan took a harder line with things.\n\n\"Rowan appointed him as his assistant, so he knew what Davie could do.\n\n\"He found his feet in the last couple of games of last season and we are all looking forward to working with him if he is going to be the manager next season.\""
