        "text": "AUSTRALIA'S reputation for developing top football talent has seen yet another nation become interested in poaching locally-developed players as Malta gets set to join the rapidly growing queue of European admirers.\n\nWith Croatia and Greece actively securing the allegiances of eligible Australian players for some years, nations such as Macedonia, Ireland and Wales have also begun to realise their potential talent pool extends into many backyards on the other side of the world.\n\nWhile Malta's status as European minnows is unlikely to cause Australia to lose too many elite prospects, they have successfully thrown an international lifeline to Central Coast Mariners midfielder John Hutchinson, who qualifies for representation through his mother.\n\nHutchinson's only taste of international football came when he participated in a Socceroos training camp last year. But since he was never capped, he has been informed he will be called up for Malta's upcoming friendly against the Czech Republic on June 5, where the former Gippsland Falcons midfielder could make his debut.\n\nFive days later, Hutchinson will be in the squad for Malta's World Cup qualifier against Sweden in Gothenborg, where the visitors will be hoping to improve their group stage record, which currently sits at one point - a 0-0 draw with Albania - from seven matches.\n\nMalta will host the reverse clash against Sweden in September before their final group qualifier away to Portugal on October 14, a match that could see the 29-year old mark the world's best player, Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\n\"Thinking about playing against those players is just amazing because once I realised my chance to play for Australia had become very slim, I thought I'd never get to play international football,\" Hutchinson told the Herald yesterday. \"Until the club was emailed to see if there was any Maltese players, I didn't even know I was eligible and it didn't even occur to me that I could play because I didn't even have a passport.\n\n\"But after talking to their manager [Czech Dusan Fitzel], I gave it some thought and it sounds like a great opportunity.\"\n\nAs an avid fan of the Socceroos, Hutchinson says it was a \"big disappointment\" never to represent Australia at any level but says he'll always be cheering for green and gold.\n\n\"I was pretty nervous at half-time of the Uzbekistan game and was delighted when we scored, so hopefully the boys can complete the job and go on to South Africa,\" he said. \"It's definitely not a case of me turning my back on Australia. I would never have been able to do that because I am Australian and playing for the Socceroos was my biggest dream.\n\n\"However, it's a great chance to do something new. Mum is pretty happy about it, but Dad's from England and even though he wasn't too sure about it at first I reckon he can be swayed.\"\n\nThe sights of the Maltese authorities have already been trained on Wellington Phoenix defender Manny Muscat, while enquiries have also been made to see if Aboriginal midfielder Fred Agius, who recently signed with North Queensland Fury, has the Maltese heritage his name suggests.\n\nOther players potentially on Malta's radar include Melbourne Victory's Steven Pace, Wellington's Vince Lia, Altona Magic's Ryan Baldacchino [who played in the Scottish Premier League with Gretna] and Perth Glory youngster James Sammut.\n\nBut Hutchinson's immediate concern is helping to guide his club side to victory against Kawasaki Frontale in Wednesday night's Asian Champions League match.\n\n\"It's a huge game for us and arguably one of the biggest ever in the history of the club,\" he said. \"We've been training hard and know we'll have to be at our sharpest to get the result and hopefully that pays off.\"\n\nWith the Mariners still without a competitive win since 2008, Hutchinson says key the victory is being \"patient\" with a solid tempo throughout.\n\n\"[Coach] Lawrie McKinna is a pretty relaxed customer but I'm sure hell let us know at half-time if we're not following instructions.\""
