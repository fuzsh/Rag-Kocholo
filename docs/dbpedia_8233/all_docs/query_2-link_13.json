        "text": "2006 – The First Festival\n\nFrom the 1970s through the 1990s, the DC government worked to redevelop Downtown DC, with the objective of increasing commerce. They envisioned Downtown DC as “a center of arts, culture, and active nighttime entertainment.” As part of this plan, a Sports Arena and Convention Center (now demolished) were constructed in the existing Chinatown area between 9th and 11th Streets.\n\nIn 2006, the first Fringe Festival took place in Downtown DC, spanning across 10 venues with 17 stages and selling nearly 20,000 tickets. This Festival was organized in collaboration with the Downtown DC BID, under the leadership of Richard Bradley.\n\n2007 – 2014 – Fort Fringe\n\nIn 2007, Fringe partnered with Douglas Development; and in April 2008, the Festival moved to a vacant property at 607 New York Ave NW. This 21,000-square-foot property, previously occupied for sixty years by A.V. Ristorante ltaliano, was renamed Fort Fringe. Fort Fringe operated in the Mount Vernon Triangle neighborhood for six years.\n\nDuring the six-year lease term, Fringe converted the vacant property into a vibrant arts center, constructing four theaters within the space: the Bedroom (60 seats), Redrum (80 seats), The Shop (90 seats), and the Baldacchino Tent (an 80-seat theater with a 3,000-square-foot bar and sidewalk patio). Additionally, the Fort housed Fringe’s scene shop, administrative office, storage and main festival box office.\n\nFrom 2006 – 2014 the neighborhoods of Mount Vernon Triangle and Downtown DC also offered numerous affordable rental rate venues for the Festival: Calvary Baptist Church, Caos on F, Flashpoint Mead Theater Lab*, Goethe Institute 812 7th St. NW*, Mount Vernon Place United Methodist Church – Undercroft Theatre, National Building Museum, Pepco’s Edison Place Gallery, Shakespeare Theatre Harman Center – The Forum, Sixth & I Synagogue, Warehouse Downtown Arts Complex*, Touchstone Gallery 407 7th St. NW*, US Navy Memorial Auditorium, Vacant Property 1006 6th St. NW*, Vacant Property 1013 7th St. NW*, Vacant Property 507 7th St. NW*, Vacant Property 709 D St. NW* and Woolly Mammoth Theatre.\n\nAdditionally during this time, Fringe set up pocket Festival neighborhoods across the District by utilizing the following venues: 1409 Playbill Café*, Atlas Performing Arts Center, Capitol Hill Artist Workshop, Chief Ike’s Mambo Room*, Church Street Theater, Corcoran Gallery of Art, Corner Store*, DC Arts Center, Emergence Community Arts Collective, Gala Hispanic Theatre, H Street Playhouse*, Jin Lounge*, Phillips Collection, Robert Cole Studio*, Source Theatre and Spooky Action – Universalist Church and Studio Theatre. *Venue no longer exists.\n\nIn 2009, Capital Fringe started renting out the three indoor venues at Fort Fringe to both local and touring theatre companies. Additionally, Fringe Free Music events were hosted year-round. The high volume of inquiries highlighted the need for a more permanent and stable venue than Fort Fringe could provide.\n\nUnfortunately, the block where Fort Fringe was located was earmarked for a significant development project between Douglas Development and Brookfield Properties. This project involved the assembly of 19 historic buildings between New York Ave, 7th and L Streets, all situated adjacent to the Washington Convention Center (opened in 2003). The completed project was financed and designed to feature “trophy office space” and retail.\n\nIn 2012, Capital Fringe began securing funding for the purchase of a permanent space within the upcoming five years. The primary goal was to provide stability in the annual venue search for the Festival, while offering year-round booking accessibility for local and touring artists.\n\nWith the guidance of the Board-led Space Committee, in conjunction with Miller Walker Real Estate, Fringe spent two years surveying available properties in the District that could accommodate multiple theatre venues and an indoor and outdoor bar space. This was a crucial element in creating the unique Festival atmosphere that Fringe was known for. Additionally, it was advantageous for the property to be located within a neighborhood that already had an existing nightlife, art, or performance scene.\n\n2015 – 2018 – Logan Fringe\n\nIn October 2014, Capital Fringe purchased the Logan Fringe Arts Space located at 1358 Florida Ave NE. The space was renovated to include a 100-seat theatre, an indoor and a tented outdoor bar, a scene shop, and administrative offices. The Logan was located on the southern tip of Trinidad, just one block north of the Atlas Performing Art Center and the H St. NE corridor, and only three blocks east of Gallaudet University and Union Market.\n\nThe Logan hosted its first public performance on Feb 9, 2015 with the Clown Cabaret, which had run monthly at Fort Fringe since 2009. Through June 15, 2018, the Logan Fringe Arts Space held 700 – 800 events ranging from theatre, live music and visual art to neighborhood birthday parties; and the venue served over 37,000 audience members.\n\nCapital Fringe operated the Logan Fringe Arts Space through June 2018, when the theater space and bar was closed to prepare for construction.\n\nThe Fringe Festival remained headquartered in the Trinidad and H Street NE neighborhoods from 2015 – 2017. Fringe rented numerous venues close to the Logan*: Atlas Performing Art Center, Gallaudet University, Gallery O and H, Pursuit Wine Bar, 1421 H St. NE *, Shopkeepers*, The Argonaut*, Treehouse Lounge* and W.S Jenks.\n\nAdditionally, Fringe continued to create pocket Festival neighborhoods across the District in the following venues: Anacostia Art Center, Brookland Artist Walk, Brookland Artist Place Lofts, Capitol Hill Artist Workshop, Catholic University of America, Caos on F, Corner Store*, Dance Place, DC Arts Space, Flashpoint Mead Theatre Lab*, Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library, National Museum of Women in the Arts, Old City Farm & Guild*, Rhizome DC and Tropicalia Lounge*. *Venue no longer exists.\n\nIn 2018, the Fringe Festival moved its registered address to Southwest DC, in partnership with the Southwest Business Improvement District (BID). This was due to several factors, including the need to prepare the Logan Fringe Arts Space for construction, the increase in rental fees, and the lack of available venues in close proximity to the Logan. During this time, the Festival did not have a centralized headquarters, instead focusing on venues centered around the Arena Stage Mead Center for American Theatre, such as Christ United Church, Culture House, Market SW, Riverside Baptist Church, Saint Augustine’s Church, Saint Matthew’s Church, and Westminster Church.\n\n2018 – 2019 – SW Fringe\n\nCapital Fringe planned to begin renovations on the Logan Fringe Arts Space in the first quarter of 2019, with Stoiber + Associates as the lead architects and Clear Restate Services leading the project management. The renovations aimed to enhance the property by adding three black box theaters with 100-200 seats each, an art gallery, a scene shop, a restaurant, and an outdoor tented bar.\n\nCapital Fringe successfully lobbied for inclusion in the 2019 DC Government Budget Support Act, which allocated $2 million to the DC Commission on the Arts and Humanities (CAH). This money would “assist with capital improvements for a nonprofit theatre located in Ward 5 along Florida Avenue, N.E., that provides unique producing and presenting experiences for artists and has produced an arts festival for at least the past decade, in an amount not to exceed $2,000,000.”\n\nCAH notified Capital Fringe that it had been awarded $2 million for the renovation project by sending a Budget Enhancement Grant (BEG) Agreement that required full complete expenditure of funds no later than September 30, 2019.\n\nIn January 2019 the Project Management team and architects outlined that the estimated $6 million renovation had risen to approximately $7.5 to $8.5 million, as construction activity in DC was near an all-time high, and Trump tariffs on steel had lead to increasing costs of building materials.\n\nIn 2019, the Fringe Festival was produced in SW DC for the second year. Arena Stage Mead Center for American Theatre made available three venue spaces for 28 days, at a cost of $32,592.50. The Festival was held in six venues, on 12 stages: Arena Stage Mead Center for American Theatre, Christ United Church, Market SW, Riverside Baptist Church, Saint Augustine’s Church, Saint Matthew’s Church, Vacant Property 996 Maine Ave SW* and Westminster Church. *Venue no longer exists.\n\nDue to increased construction expenses and a longer than expected timeline for the renovation of the Logan Fringe Arts Space, the project became financially unsustainable. As a result, construction was limited to the first floor, which did not generate enough revenue to support ongoing operations. Fringe could not spend the CAH grant funds by September 30, 2019. Fringe and community members reached out to the Chairman of the Council to request to move the funds to 2020. Fringe received a Letter of Termination from the CAH, requiring repayment by August 30, 2019. Failure to do so would result in Fringe being deemed non-compliant, and the Festival would no longer be eligible to receive grant awards. Fringe returned the funds, which were then redistributed as “Enhancement Grants” to 94 arts organizations in DC with budgets under $1.25 million.\n\nIn December 2019, the Capital Fringe Board voted to hire a broker and, in January 2020 the Board voted to sell the Logan. Arnold & Porter provided pro bono legal services to ensure that Fringe would retain as much profit as possible from the sale, which would be used to replenish the organization’s Cash Reserve and created a Board Advised Quasi Endowment. The organization went through four building sales, with the final sale closing in January 2021.\n\n2020 – Present – Georgetown Fringe\n\nAfter a two-year Festival hiatus due to COVID-19, Fringe first reached out to Arena Stage as a venue for the 2022 Festival. Arena Stage was only able to make available the Cradle Theatre space and rent was increased by 40% from 2019. Additionally, many of the SW venues the Festival had used previously had been reconfigured with other programs, and it was clear the Festival needed to move neighborhoods again, this time to Georgetown.\n\nIn 2022, Capital Fringe was able to significantly reduce its admission costs and increase the average ticket revenue for participating productions by 49% compared to 2019. This was made possible through a partnership with the Georgetown Business Improvement District (BID), which provided both cash and in-kind support to Fringe. This allowed Fringe to occupy all Festival venues rent-free for up to 20 days of preparation, tech rehearsals, and the entire run of all productions, eliminating the Festival venue rental expense of $80-90K.\n\nAs a result, Fringe was able to keep ticket prices affordable and accessible, with an entry fee of $15 plus a convenience fee of $2.51. This was a decrease from previous years’ admission prices of $20 with a $4 convenience fee. Notably, the Festival was highly attended, with Fringe selling a record 87% of available tickets.\n\nCapital Fringe has organized 17 Fringe Festivals featuring more than 52,700 participating artists who have entertained an audience of over 393,234 ticket buyers. These festivals have generated revenue of over $2,703,908 for artists who participated in them.\n\nThe 2023 Fringe Festival was once again headquartered in Georgetown, in partnership with the Georgetown BID. During the pandemic, the Georgetown vacancy rate reached 20%, but it has now decreased to 9%, and only a limited number of vacant spaces remain available. Landlords are receiving high volumes of bids for available properties, and asking rates have returned to pre-pandemic levels of $175 per sq. ft. The search for available properties was challenging for the 2023 Festival, but two vacant office properties at 1025 and 1050 Thomas Jefferson St NW were finally secured in mid-April and hosted four theater spaces. Additionally, two stages and were hosted at the DCJCC/Theatre J in the Dupont Circle/Logan Square area.\n\nThe 2023 Fringe Festival sold 50% of available tickets (8,234) to 43 productions and collaborated with 350 artists, cast and crew. We are thrilled to return 70% of the total ticket revenue ($83,908) to participating artists (average payout of $2,097). And, we are grateful to report record donations brought in during this year’s Festival of over $14K.\n\nThe 2023 Festival also marked the return of our community bar space. Powerhouse, an event venue in Georgetown, on Fridays and Saturdays during the Festival. Brick and Mortar managed the food and beverage program.\n\nAssembling a centralized location for the 2023 Fringe Festival posed significant challenges and raised concerns about the future of Fringe. The shifting landscape of DC, with a decrease in mid to small theatre companies and venues, has made it increasingly difficult to find affordable and sustainable spaces for the Festival. The high cost of venues, which can exceed $30K, creates a financial burden for the Festival, which only retains 30% of the ticket revenue.\n\nUnfortunately, there are no tax incentives, subsidized rent or other mechanisms to encourage property owners to include theatre space specifically as a community benefit in their new developments over a period of years. The lack of affordable and reliable space threatens the viability of small to mid-sized theatre companies and artists operating outside the institutionalized model of regional theatre. This community needs support that is not currently occurring from available service organizations and systems in place. We need affordable and reliable space that can accommodate live theatre.\n\nTheatre’s role is to suspend disbelief for the audience even if it is just for a moment. And that can’t happen without us making space for it!\n\nThis timeline will be updated in Jan – Feb 2025"
