        "text": "Baldacchino History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nItaly\n\nThe distinguished surname Baldacchino can be traced back to the ancient and beautiful region of Lombardy. Although people were originally known only by a single name, it became necessary for people to adopt a second name to identify themselves as populations grew and travel became more frequent. The process of adopting fixed hereditary surnames was not complete until the modern era, but the use of hereditary family names in Italy began in the 10th and 11th centuries. Italian hereditary surnames were developed according to fairly general principles and they were characterized by a profusion of derivatives coined from given names. The most common type of family name found in the region of Lombardy is the patronymic surname, which is derived from the father's given name. During the Middle Ages, Italians adopted the patronymic system of name-making because it perfectly complemented the prevailing Feudal System. In Italy the popularity of patronymic type of surname is also due to the fact that during the Christian era, people often named their children after saints and biblical figures. The surname Baldacchino came from the Germanic word baltha, which means gallant, bold.\n\nEarly Origins of the Baldacchino family\n\nThe surname Baldacchino was first found in the city of Cremona, which lies just south of Milan. The earliest records of the family lie here with the Baldesio family in the 8th century.\n\nEarly History of the Baldacchino family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Baldacchino research.

This is caused by two main factors: regional tradition, and inaccuracies in the recording process. Before the last few hundred years, scribes spelled names according to their sounds. Spelling variations were the unsurprising result.
