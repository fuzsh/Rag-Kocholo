        "text": "Posted from my Patreon community where I take requests for book lists to create, share resources, and offer up coaching for members. It is a very easy way for me to be accessible to people around the world, you can join here.\n\nI am continuing with my updates of the picture book lists I made several years ago to accompany the teaching of a variety of reading skills. This time, the focus is on “Symbols” (Again and Again for Notice and Note) or that moment something seemingly inconsequential takes on a more significant meaning. It can be a word, a phrase, an object, or an action that repeats. This can give us a further clue about the conflicts of the story, the theme of the story, or even foreshadow the story.\n\nWhen I first started out teaching this skill, I was inspired by the language of Notice and Note: Strategies for Close Reading by Kylene Beers and Robert Probst. This book provided my students with the foundation for deeper reading conversations and a common language as we developed our thoughts and discussion skills.\n\nI have updated three other lists so far. Here are my updated lists for Internal Conflict (Tough Questions), Character Change (Contrast & Contradictions), and for Flashbacks (Memory Moments).\n\nThe Rabbit Listened by Cori Doerrfeld: The phrase “The rabbit listened” is repeated multiple times throughout the story, emphasizing the importance of empathy and listening to others.\n\nThe Remember Balloons by Jessie Oliveros and illustrated by Dana Wulfekotte: The character’s memories are depicted as balloons that are repeated throughout the illustrations, emphasizing the importance of memories and their impact on our lives.\n\nThe Bad Seed by Jory John and illustrated by Pete Oswald: The phrase “I’m a bad seed” is repeated several times, showing the character’s struggle with his identity and eventually his growth and change.\n\nThe Day You Begin by Jacqueline Woodson and illustrated by Rafael López: The phrase “There will be times when you walk into a room and no one there is quite like you” is repeated multiple times, highlighting the theme of diversity and the importance of embracing differences.\n\nThe Word Collector by Peter H. Reynolds: The main character collects words and repeats them throughout the story, emphasizing the power of language and the joy of learning new words.\n\nDrawn Together by Minh Lê and illustrated by Dan Santat: The phrase “No words” is repeated throughout the story, highlighting the characters’ communication barriers and eventual connection through art.\n\nWe Don’t Eat Our Classmates by Ryan T. Higgins: The phrase “We don’t eat our classmates” is repeated multiple times, emphasizing the importance of treating others with kindness and respect.\n\nBe Kind by Pat Zietlow Miller and illustrated by Jen Hill: The phrase “No one is born a jerk” is repeated several times, showing the character’s growth and change as she learns to be kind.\n\nLove by Matt de la Peña and illustrated by Loren Long: The word “love” is repeated throughout the story, highlighting the different forms of love and its importance in our lives.\n\nCrown: An Ode to the Fresh Cut by Derrick Barnes and illustrated by Gordon C. James: The phrase “You came in as a lump of clay, a blank, canvas, a mingi, a rough draft” is repeated multiple times, emphasizing the transformative power of a fresh haircut and how we build power\n\n.\n\nThe Little Red Fort by Brenda Maier and illustrated by Sonia Sánchez: The phrase “She asked her brothers to help, but they said no” is repeated several times, showing the character’s determination and persistence in building the fort on her own.\n\nThey Say Blue by Jillian Tamaki: The phrase “They say blue is sad, like a lonely song” is repeated throughout the story, exploring the different emotions and meanings associated with the color blue.\n\nA Big Mooncake for Little Star by Grace Lin: The phrase “Little Star gazed down at the big mooncake” is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing the character’s curiosity and eventual consumption of the mooncake.\n\nThe Wall in the Middle of the Book by Jon Agee: The phrase “The wall protects this side of the book” is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing the character’s ignorance of the dangers on his side of the wall.\n\nDreamers by Yuyi Morales: The phrase “We didn’t know the language” is repeated several times, emphasizing the character’s immigrant experience and the challenges of adapting to a new culture.\n\nWhen Things Aren’t Going Right, Go Left by Marc Colagiovanni and illustrated by Peter H. Reynolds: Quite literal symbols are emplyed as the main character leaves their burdens behind, great intro ttext for younger students.\n\nBrick by Brick by Charles R. Smith Jr. and illustrated by Floyd Cooper tells the little known story of how slaves were part of the construction of The White House. Powerful read and powerful Again and Again moments.\n\nBack of the Bus written by Aaron Reynolds and illustrated by Floyd Cooper tells the story of Rosa Park’s act of courage from the perspective of a little boy on the bus. Powerful again and again when students notice the symbolism of the marble.\n\nAmelia and Eleanor Go For a Ride written by Pam Munoz Ryan and illustrated by Brian Selznick has a few subtle Again and Again’s and may therefore be better suited for when students have had some exposure to the strategy.\n\nI admit that The North Star by Peter H. Reynolds was the first one that came to mind for this strategy of noticing when something is repeated again and again. Why? Because the cat becomes a symbol for so many things in this book and is something that my students often notice.\n\nWith the simple line “Winter is coming” this picture book aptly titled Winter is Coming by Tony Johnston and illustrated by Jim LaMarche is great for just starting out with the strategy since the line is easy to spot and will lead to good discussions about how the book changes even though the line stays the same.\n\nThe Big Box by Toni Morrison and Slade Morrison illustrated by Giselle Potter has a lot of repetition making it an ideal candidate for again and again. Because the words do not seem to mean much until you really start to think about their meaning. What is the symbolic meaning of the big box?\n\nOne of the most beloved picture books in our 7th grade classroom is I Want My Hat Back by Jon Klassen which due to the hat and the repeated phrases of the bear and the rabbit are great for inferring based on the again and again moments.\n\nAnother favorite is Wolfie the Bunny by Ame Dyckman illustrated by Zachariah OHora when Dot the Rabbit keeps repeating that Wolfie will eat them all up. This leads to some great discussion of why she would keep saying that and how we do the same as people when we judge.\n\nThe again and again moment may be a little harder to find in the classic Where the Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak but kids always recognize it when they reach the final page and the supper is still hot. Why does this matter and how does it link in to earlier events?\n\nA Sweet Smell of Roses by Angela Johnson is a beautiful picture book and the again and again lies in the use of the color red as well as the phrase “Sweet smell of roses…” throughout the book.\n\nthis beautiful new picture book, My Two Blankets by Irena Kobold and Freya Blackwood keeps eluding to a blanket. I love the metaphor that the blanket (s) represent.\n\nBlue on Blue by Dianne White and Beth Krommes has a fantastic again and again in the way the color words are used. While not as obvious as an again and again moment, I am looking forward to seeing if students can discover the pattern.\n\nWe are about to start our nonfiction focus for the year so I am so glad I found some great again and again moments in The Boy Who Loved Math by Deborah Helligman with pictures by LeUyen Pham. The way the numbers are colored throughout the pages will definitely catch the eye of students.\n\nAs always, I turned to the awesome Notice and Note community on Facebook and asked them to share their favorites as well. Here they are.\n\nShow Way by Jacqueline Woodson.\n\nFrog on a Log? by Kes Gray and Jim Field.\n\nLittle Elliot Big City by Mike Curato\n\nBy Frog and Mouse by Deborah Freedman\n\nSomething Beautiful by Sharon Dennis Wyeth\n\nShortcut by Donald Crews\n\nChrysanthemum by Kevin Henkes.\n\nThe Hat by Jan Brett\n\nThe Other Side by Jacqueline Woodson\n\nThe Big Orange Splot by Daniel Manus Pinkwater\n\nAs always, please add your favorites for Again and Again in the comments\n\nPosted from my Patreon community where I take requests for book lists to create, share resources, and offer up coaching for members. It is a very easy way for me to be accessible to people around the world, you can join here.\n\nOne of the reading strategies we teach students is to notice character changes, whether it be in chapter books, movies, or even in life. When I first started out teaching this strategy, I was inspired by the language of Notice and Note: Strategies for Close Reading by Kylene Beers and Robert Probst. This book provided my students with the foundation for having deeper reading conversations and a common language as we developed our thoughts and our discussion skills.\n\nWhile being able to track characters and notice when they act out of character is a great reading strategy, it is an even bigger life skill. Inferring and noticing when people don’t seem like themselves or when they change can be practiced within literature and media. As a way to introduce and really focus on the strategy, I have long used picture books to showcase it. 8 years ago, I created this initial list of picture books and I figured it was about time to update it as I sit and watch Titanic with my kids.\n\nThe Noisy Classroom by Angela Shanté and illustrated by Alison Hawkins. A young girl is about to enter the third grade, but this year she’s put into Ms. Johnson’s noisy class. Everything about the noisy class is odd. While all the other classes are quiet, Ms. Johnson sings and the kids chatter all day. The door is always closed, yet sounds from it can be heard in the hallway. With summer coming to an end and school starting, the girl realizes that soon she’ll be going to the noisy class. What will school be like now?\n\nIn After the Fall by Dan Santat, Humpty Dumpty has to come to terms with his own fear and anxiety after a great big fall. But that requires him to act opposite of what his fear tells him to.\n\nWhen my Cousins Come to Town by Angela Shanté and illustrated by Keisha Morris. Fitting in can be hard, but standing out isn’t easy either! Every summer a young girl eagerly waits for her cousins to come visit and celebrate her birthday. All her cousins are unique in their own ways and have earned cool nicknames for themselves… except for the girl. But this year things are going to be different. This year before summer ends, she’s determined to earn her own nickname!\n\nMy Teacher is a Monster by Peter Brown. A young boy named Bobby has the worst teacher. She’s loud, she yells, and if you throw paper airplanes, she won’t allow you to enjoy recess. She is a monster! Luckily, Bobby can go to his favorite spot in the park on weekends to play. Until one day… he finds his teacher there! Over the course of one day, Bobby learns that monsters are not always what they seem.\n\nI Hate Everyone by Naomi Davis and illustrated by Cinta Arribas. “I hate everyone.” In your worst mood, it’s a phrase you might want to shout out loud, even if, deep down, you don’t really mean it. Set at a birthday party, this disgruntled, first-person story portrays the confusing feelings that sometimes make it impossible to be nice, even-or especially-when everyone else is in a partying mode.\n\nIn Big by Vashti Harrison we follow our main character and she goes from loving herself, to feeling the direct pressure from society to fit in. Can she find herself and her strength again?\n\nTimid by Harry Woodgate offers up the story of Timmy, who loves to perform even though they also have anxiety whenever they are asked to perform in front of others. While they want to overcome it, and nearly do, it turns out letting go of who you used to be is a lot harder than one might think.\n\nIn Francis Discovers Possible by Ashlee Latimer and illustrated by Shahrzad Maydani, Francis loves learning new words. At school, when her class is reviewing words that begin with the letter “F,” someone sneers “Fat, like Francis.” Francis always thought “fat” was a warm word—like snuggling with Mama or belly rubs for her puppy. But now “fat” feels cold, and Francis feels very small. After school, Baba takes Francis to the park. She chooses the bench instead of the swing set, and gets very quiet. But when Baba uses the word “possible,” Francis wants to know what it means.\n\nIn The Recess Queen by Alexis O’Neill and Laura Huliska-Beith, Mean Jean was Recess Queen and nobody said any different. Nobody swung until Mean Jean swung. Nobody kicked until Mean Jean kicked. Nobody bounced until Mean Jean bounced. If kids ever crossed her, she’d push ’em and smoosh ’em, lollapaloosh ’em, hammer ’em, slammer ’em, kitz and kajammer ’em. Until a new kid came to school! With her irrepressible spirit, the new girl dethrones the reigning recess bully by becoming her friend in this infectious playground romp.\n\nIn Home for a While by Lauren H. Kerstein and illustrated by Natalie Moore, Calvin is in foster care, and he wants to trust someone, anyone, but is afraid to open his heart. He has lived in a lot of houses, but he still hasn’t found his home. When he moves in with Maggie, she shows him respect, offers him kindness, and makes him see things in himself that he’s never noticed before. Maybe this isn’t just another house, maybe this is a place Calvin can call home, for a while.\n\nEl Cucuy is Scared Too by Donna Barba Higuera and illustrated by Juliana Perdomo. Ramón is a little boy who can’t sleep. He is nervous for his first day at a new school.\n\nAnd El Cucuy is the monster who lives in Ramón’s cactus pot. He can’t sleep, either.\n\nIt turns out that El Cucuy is scared, too!\n\nTruman by Jean Reidy and illustrated by Lucy Ruth Cummins, Truman is a worried little turtle especially as Sarah leaves him for school. How will he manage when she continues to leave and cannot bring him along?\n\nIt’s like this picture book was written just for this lesson. The Bad Seed by Jory John and illustrated by Pete Oswald features two changes in character and also a powerful message about trauma and what can happen to you even after bad things happen.\n\nIn Morris Micklewhite and the Tangerine Dress by Christine Baldacchino and Isabelle Malenfant, Morris goes from being sad and timid, unsure of his choice to wear a tangerine dress. As the book progresses he changes as he realizes that he wants to be himself.\n\nAllie’s Basketball by Barbara E Barber (Author), Darryl Ligasan(Illustrator)\n\nAccording to the boys watching Allie play, girls can’t play basketball.\n\nIn A Tale of Two Beasts by Fiona Robertson, the C&C is how the two sides view the story.\n\nI Don’t Want to Be a Frog by Dev Petty and illustrated by Mike Boldt is C&C throughout. The main character does not want to be what he is supposed to be and protests it every way he can.\n\nDear Primo: A Letter to My Cousin by Duncan Tonatiuh (Author)\n\nAs two cousins write to each other, we see the contrast (and similarities) between their lives.\n\nTuesday by David Wiesner started us off in our discussions about contrasts and contradictions. This fantastic nearly wordless picture book is an easy entry into this discussion as it allows students to easily see how the magical event with the toads floating is in contrast to what frogs normally do.\n\nWith one of my classes I also used Rules of Summer by Shaun Tan, where the contrast lies in the rules being shared and the images. While this one was a little more advanced for the students, they greatly enjoyed the illustrations and discussing what they might mean.\n\nThe Invisible Boy by Trudy Ludwig and illustrated by Patrice Barton. Meet Brian, the invisible boy. Nobody in class ever seems to notice him or think to include him in their group, game, or birthday party . . . until, that is, a new kid comes to class.When Justin, the new boy, arrives, Brian is the first to make him feel welcome. And when Brian and Justin team up to work on a class project together, Brian finds a way to shine\n\nAnother contrast and contradiction text between self and society in Mr. Tiger Goes Wild by Peter Brown where Mr. Tiger just will not conform. When he tries to change his ways, he loses his real identity.\n\nThis Is A Moose by Richard T. Morris and Tom Lichtenheld is a great example of the contrast between what a moose is supposed to be like and what they really are.\n\nThe Story of Fish & Snail by Deborah Freedman is a wonderful example about change in a character as Snail is too scared to follow Fish on a new adventure.\n\nThat Is Not A Good Idea by Mo Willems is another great example of a character changing and acting in a different way than we would expect. I do love this devious little tale.\n\nWhat I love about Gaston by Kelly DiPucchio, illustrated by Christian Robinson, is that most of my students can relate to its message about being expected to fit in in a certain way. The contrast lies between the characters and how their upbringing has shaped them.\n\nAny day I can use Pete and Pickles by Berkeley Breathed is a good day in our room. Here, we focus on the change that Pete the pig goes through as he meets Pickles. Great book also to use for character development and inferring.\n\nDon’t Call Me Choocie Pooh by Sean Taylor and Kate Hindley follow the story of a dog that does not want to be treated in a certain way afraid of what the other dogs will think. Great ending that shows the change in the character.\n\nHorrible Bear written by Ame Dyckman and illustrated by Zachariah O’Hora is a lovely picture book that shows what happens when you don’t do what is expected.\n\nDon’t Call Me Grandma by Vaunda Micheaux Nelson and illustrated by Elizabeth Zunon is a perfect example of a character that does not fit the stereotype. Great-Grandmother Nell isn’t anything but warm and fuzzy and as the great-grand daughter starts to understand why, we see a great slice of history as well.\n\nNorth Woods Girl written by Aimee Bissonette and illustrated by Claudia McGehee is also about a grandma that doesn’t quite fit the mold.\n\nLittle Red by Bethan Woolvin is wickedly funny, it follows the path of the regular story but with a twist at the end and it is that twist that provides our contract and contradiction.\n\nWhich books have you used for contrast and contradictions?\n\nPS: Are you looking for coaching, in-person support, or virtual presentations?

The year is quietly winding down which means the reflection begins on which illustrations took my breath away. And there were many. This year being out of the classroom, I won’t get to do it with kids, but I will be cheering from afar as the awards are announced on January 30th, 2023.\n\nI have loved doing this unit with children, it is a way to really sink into the beauty of picture books, to have them consider critical components of the books and how the images are synthesized with the text. It is also a great unit leading up to our major nonfiction picture book writing unit, which is a favorite of many.\n\nOver the years, I have made a few tweaks to make it more manageable and enjoyable for kids:\n\nOne, I read all of these books aloud during our unit. While the students will still read them in their group, they will have experienced the full text with us all first.\n\nTwo, I limit our choices to 12, with 4 “extra choices.” That way we can leisurely work through the unit, savor the illustrations, and give it the time it needs rather than skim through pages in order to come up with a winner.\n\nThree, each group will pick their winner. Every year we have had a vote for class pick, but I switched it a few years ago by letting each group select and root for their individual winners. We will, however, vote for an overall winner in all of my English classes combined.\n\nYour choice – every year there are a few books that I think might be a winner or honor book but that I for some reason didn’t select. I then have students browse through them and they can choose one or more of them to score as well if they want. It has been fascinating to see which books they gravitate toward from these four choices.\n\nThe lessons will not change much; I use previous winners to discuss the different components of the award and then students grab the books they will discuss that day and rank. Each group gets a packet with the titles and a voting sheet. The slides I use as well as all resources can be found in my Patreon (where I share a lot of resources, book lists, and do mini pd’s) and are pretty straightforward. The voting packet is updated and students end the unit doing a persuasive speech to try to convince their classmates that their choice is, of course, the best one. Then we watch the awards and celebrate them with a class party!\n\nSo which books have I chosen for the year? It was so hard to choose!\n\nExtra choice selections:\n\nThere you have it? My choices for 2023 – which ones are you rooting for?\n\nPS: Are you looking for coaching or virtual presentations? I am available and would love to support your work.

I mean, I had thought about it. We had discussed it a lot. It was one of those “one day…” plans, but then this summer with a can’t miss opportunity to work for Famly, one day became now and last week (I think it was last week anyway because the weeks blur together), I stood in my beloved classroom and said goodbye to all of the books, to what we have built together.\n\nI had told myself I would leave them all and walk away with my head held high, a gift for the brand new teacher who would be joining my team. And yet, as I saw the books in there and the stories called to me, I had to hold them one last time, and once they were in my hands, I knew there were some I couldn’t walk away from. Whether they held memories, teaching points, or just windows into the incredible community I have been a part of these last 14 years, a few called to me so loudly that they are now coming with me to our new apartment in Denmark. I will find a way to use them again. I would have brought them all, but what use are books just sitting on shelves when they should be in the hands of readers?\n\nI posted this image on Instagram with the box of books I grabbed, and many asked if I would share my must-keep ones. So here you are, in no particular order, the picture books that I know I can use for so many things, the picture books that moved me to tears, had us laugh out loud, had us wonder, had us question the world and start discussions as we grew together, as we sat in community together. I know I missed a few, I know I could have grabbed more, but I limited myself to one single box.\n\nI know I grabbed a few others but these were the ones I remember. All of these are fantastic books that deserve to be read, shared, and loved. Which picture books would you keep?\n\nI am excited to be heading out on the road again to be with other educators in-district or at conferences while continuing my virtual consulting and speaking as well. Whereas I am physically located in Denmark now, I can still offer virtual and in-person work. If you would like me to be a part of your professional development, please reach out. I am here to help.
