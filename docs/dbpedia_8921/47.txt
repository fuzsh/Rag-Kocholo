* GEORGE IV (1816-1818): GERMANY 1 PFENNIG 1816 DUCHY OF BRUNSWICK-WOLFENBUTTEL! DISCOVERY COIN!

NO RESERVE!

Interesting type of the first emission of duchy in nice condition. On obverse the coin depicts the horse left with circular legend GEORG P. R. T. N. CAROLI D.BR. ET L*, which means George prince regent in the name of Karl duke of Brunswick and Luneburg. The new duchy appeared due to Congress of Vienna in 1815 after the Napoleon invasion in Europe. But to govern the duchy had to be Charles II, 11 years old that days. As the result the King of the Great Britain George IV became his regent. On this coin his title is price regent (KM#1068), which is much more uncommon than simultaneous emission with regent in title (KM#1069). F.R. under the horse is for mint official Friedrich Ritter (1810-1820). Pretty unusual spelling of u umlaut as V in MVNZE. Recently with the help of this coin two types of reverse were discovered.

Reverse

Die A - decorations consist of four close acanthus leaves with central dot.

Die B - decorations consist of four separated acanthus leaves without dot in the middle.

This coin was struck with die A. For large interest of collectors to this discovery, and in order to make attribution easy it was decided to publish it at the article en.numista.com/catalogue/pieces74426.html of Numista catalog with images of this very coin.
