        "text": "I've been posting on the ancient board for awhile, but I thought I might trot out some of my coins here for a change.\n\nI've been focusing my collecting on Italian Renaissance coins, specifically those with dies that can be attributed to an individual Renaissance artist. So far I have coins by Cellini, Francia, Cesati, and Caradossa. Leone Leoni, Galeotti, and Poggini are all on my wantlist. I also consider Paduans by Cavino to fall into this category.\n\nPost you Renaissance coins and Paduans (and medals, but especially coins)! For the purpose of this thread let's consider coins minted between 1400-1650 to be \"Renaissance,\" especially if they show classical influence or naturalism, or are from Italy.\n\nWithout further ado, here are my coins:\n\nPapal States.Clement VII (Giuliano de’Medici), 1523-1534, Rome mint. Doppio Carlino, AR 5.01 g. CLEMENS·VII PONT· MAX Bearded bust left with ornate cope with figures of saints and medallion. Rv. Mintmark of Giacomo Balducci. QVARE – DVBITASTI (Matthew 14:31) Christ lifting St. Peter from the Sea. Muntoni 43. Berman 841. Rare. VF, profile of Clement slightly doubled. Dies by Benvenuto Cellini.\n\nAlessandro de'Medici (1532-1536) First Duke of Florence. Mezzo giulio. CNI 24/29. MIR 105. AG. g. 1.60 RRR. O: ALEXANDER MED R P FLOREN DVX crowned coat of arms.

S PAVLVS VAS | ELECTIONIS, St. Paul standing facing, fleur below, head slightly right with halo, epistles in right hand, sword in left / PAVLVS III | PONT • MAX, pontifical arms. Dies by Benvenuto Cellini.\n\nBologna. John II Bentivoglio (1494-1506). Pattern Testone. 1494. O/ II BONONIENSIS IOANNES BENTIVO LVS. Capped bust to the. R/ B XIMILIANI IMPERATORIS MVNV MCCCCLXXXX IIII. Chim.221. Hill 606. AE 10.96g 29.00mm RR. Original strike. Plugged hole. XF.Dies engraved Francesco Raibolini called Francesco Francia.\n\nDuchy of Milan. Galeazzo Maria Sforza (1488-1494) - Testone - Right: armored duke's bust on the right - Reverse: coat of arms surmounted by helmet with crest decorated with crested dragon; on the sides embers with the buckets and initials - gr. 9.56 - Old cabinet toning (CNI V / 171/76) (Crippa II / 197 / 6B) (Biaggi No. 1548) Dies by Cristoforo Foppa called Caradosso.\n\nPapal States, Rome. Giulio III (Giovanni Maria Ciocchi del Monte), 1550-1555. Year II 1551-2. Giulio. Ar gr. 3.03. Ø 27.27 mm. Obv. IVLIVS·III - ·P·M·Anno·II Bust with tonsure and embroidered cope to l.; II below. Rev. OMNIA·TVTA· - ·VIDES / ROMA \"He sees everything.\" Virgil’s Aeneid 1:583 Roma as a legionary in armor seated left on the seven hills, holding a laurel wreath; below l., mint master sign A‡C of Bartolomeo Canobio and, to r., ROMA. CNI XV p.430 n.55; Muntoni 16; Berm. 992. Rare. Near VF. Dies likely by Alessandro Cesati, called Grechetto.\n\nGalba. AD 68-69. Cast Æ “Sestertius” (32mm, 20.26 g). Paduan type. 1500-1570. Obv: IMP. SER. SVLP. GALBA CAES. AVG. TR. POT. Laureate bust of Galba, r., draped. Rev: The emperor on a platform, l., addressing five soldiers with standards. L. and r., in field, S.C. In exurge, ADLOCVT. Klawans Obverse type 3, reverse type 4. VF. Later cast after Giovanni da Cavino\n\nI've already admired your avatar, but that Milanese testone is a stunner! The Cellini scudo d'oro is impressive, too. All great stuff.\n\nHere is a rather humble French billon douzain of Charles VIII (\"the Affable\"), which has been in my unsorted and unresearched \"cheapo\" pile. Just got the ID on it today, with the help of the forums. (Thanks, @Mark Metzger! I had been confused by a misattribution written on the 40-50-year-old 2x2 holder.)"
