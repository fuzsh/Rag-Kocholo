        "text": "Ernest Augustus\n\npretender to Hanoverian throne\n\nAlso called:\n\nDuke of Cumberland, Herzog von Braunschweig-Lüneburg\n\nBorn:\n\nSeptember 21, 1845, Hannover, Hanover [Germany]\n\nDied:\n\nNovember 14, 1923, Gmunden, Austria (aged 78)\n\nErnest Augustus (born September 21, 1845, Hannover, Hanover [Germany]—died November 14, 1923, Gmunden, Austria) was the only son of George V of Hanover and pretender to the Hanoverian throne from 1878 to 1913.\n\nAfter his father was deposed as a result of the Seven Weeks’ War between Prussia and Austria (in which Hanover had sided with losing Austria), Ernest Augustus lived mainly in Austria. On his father’s death (1878), however, he maintained his claim to the Hanoverian throne. In 1884 on the death, without issue, of his kinsman William, the last sovereign duke of Brunswick, he also claimed that duchy. Inspired by Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, the German Federal Council rebutted him by naming Prince Albert of Prussia as regent of Brunswick. After the latter’s death, the duke was again excluded (1907) and the regency continued.\n\nIn 1902 Ernest Augustus had told the German emperor William II (Kaiser Wilhelm II) that he was prepared to accept the imperial regime in Germany. In May 1913 the Welf-Hohenzollern feud over possession of the duchy of Brunswick was healed by the marriage of his son Ernest Augustus (1887–1953) to William II’s only daughter, Victoria Louise. Ernest Augustus then renounced his rights in favour of his son, the Federal Council lifted its veto, and the young prince became a sovereign ruler as Ernest Augustus, duke of Brunswick (November 1, 1913). He abdicated with other German princes, on November 8, 1918. A Titles Deprivation Act in 1917, followed by an order in council in 1919, deprived father and son of all their titles and honours in the United Kingdom.\n\nThis article was most recently revised and updated by Encyclopaedia Britannica."
