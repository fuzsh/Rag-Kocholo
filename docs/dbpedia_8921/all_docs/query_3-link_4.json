It had a value equal to 2.00 gold mark.\n\nThe coin was composed of .900 fine silver, weighed 11.1111 grams, measured 28 millimeters in diameter, and 2 millimeters in thickness. Most examples of the coins featured the Reichsadler of the German Empire on the reverse, accompanied by the state title of the Second Reich (DEUTSCHES REICH), the coin's value, and the year of minting. The obverse typically featured the leader of the state it was minted for. For example, a coin from the Kingdom of Bavaria from 1888 would display an effigy of then-current Bavarian King, Otto I. Other times, the coat of arms of the state that issued the coin would be engraved on the coin's obverse, as seen on the Bremen and Hamburg 2 mark coins.\n\nState issues[]\n\nAnhalt\n\nBremen\n\nDuchy of Saxe-Altenburg\n\nDuchy of Saxe-Meiningen\n\nFree City of Lübeck\n\nGrand Duchy of Baden\n\nGrand Duchy of Hesse\n\nGrand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin\n\nGrand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz\n\nGrand Duchy of Oldenburg\n\nGrand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach\n\nHamburg\n\nKingdom of Bavaria\n\nKingdom of Prussia\n\nKingdom of Saxony\n\nKingdom of Württemberg\n\nPrincipality of Lippe\n\nPrincipality of Reuss Elder Line\n\nPrincipality of Reuss Younger Line\n\nPrincipality of Schaumburg-Lippe\n\nPrincipality of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt\n\nPrincipality of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen\n\nSaxe-Coburg and Gotha\n\nReferences[]\n\nGerman gold mark Banknotes 5 ℳ • 10 ℳ • 20 ℳ • 50 ℳ • 100 ℳ • 1000 ℳ Coins 1 ₰ • 2 ₰ • 5 ₰ • 10 ₰ • 20 ₰ • 25 ₰ • 50 ₰ • ½ ℳ • 1 ℳ • 2 ℳ • 3 ℳ • 5 ℳ • 10 ℳ • 20 ℳ Miscellaneous Bavarian Mint • Berlin State Mint • Coinage Act of 1873 • Darmstadt Mint • Dresden Mint • Frankfurt Mint • Hamburg Mint • Hannover Mint • Karlsruhe State Mint • Muldenhütten Mint • Reichsbank • Reichskassenschein • Stuttgart State Mint"
