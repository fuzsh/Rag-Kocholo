        "text": "Money is a very pervasive component of our lives and something most of us would struggle to define – or, better said, would come-up with a range of acceptable definitions. Currencies do not necessarily have to be produced by states and many different private entities have minted coins (and later banknotes) throughout history. Bitcoin was launched in January, 2009, by a group whose pseudonym is Satoshi Nakamoto. They represent a return to the core of what commodity-currencies used to be while challenging the established practice of state-guaranteed currencies. Burgeoning levels of debts have then appeared as a new threat not so much to monetary credibility but rather to social cohesion. The concept of monetary growth altogether independent of states and borrowers offered by the Bitcoin project remains highly attractive and could represent a solution to the current inequality growth. But the Bitcoin project, by its quantitative limitations, does not offer the most promising prospects for this. Some of its underlying ideas could nevertheless precipitate a monetary revolution the day the current era of debt-driven growth comes to an end.\n\nThe prospect of central banks issuing digital currency (CBDC) immediately raises the question of how this new form of money should co-exist and interact with existing forms of money. This paper evaluates three different scenarios for the implementation of CBDC in terms of their monetary policy implications. In the ‘money user scenario’ CBDC co-exists with both cash and commercial bank deposits. In the ‘money manager scenario’ cash is abolished and CBDC co-exists only with commercial bank deposits. And in the ‘money maker scenario’ commercial bank deposits are abolished and CBDC co-exist only with cash. The evaluation is based on an adaption of the classical international monetary policy trilemma to a domestic monetary system with multiple forms of money. Our proposition is that a monetary system with two competing money creators, the central bank and the commercial banking sector, can simultaneously only pursue two out of the following three policy objectives: Free convertibility between CBDC and bank money, parity between CBDC and bank money, and central bank monetary sovereignty, which is the use of monetary policy for anything else than support for commercial bank credit creation. This means that the decision on the design of a monetary system with CBDC implies a crucial political decision on the prior-ities of the central bank.\n\nForerunners of man lived upon the planet several million years ago. But the unique social order of man – civilization – emerged only four to five thousand years ago. Historical and archaeological evidence suggests that the institution of money evolved coterminously with civilization among all the institutions of life on earth; therefore, civilization and money are but young and fragile reeds. Their growth and development occurred only recently and today their very existence is threatened with extinction."
