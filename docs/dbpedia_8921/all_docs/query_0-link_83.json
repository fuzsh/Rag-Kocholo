        "text": "Some unusual coins came up for sale on AliExpress the other day, and as is my custom, I had a look at the source and history of these items from Albania. My first reaction was that someone from Disneyland had invented a King Zog – who on earth would want to be known as Zog the First – but, no, there really was such a person and very interesting he was too.\n\nOn the eve of World War II, as Hitler polished up his war machine for global conquest, Benito Mussolini, his fascist ally to the south, parodied the Führer by invading the small, isolated kingdom of Albania, whose shores lay, perhaps symbolically, within kicking distance of the heel of the Italian boot.\n\nA remote and neglected outpost of the Ottoman Empire for more than four hundred years, Albania remained an impoverished feudal kingdom, largely inaccessible, lacking railways, telephone lines and electric power beyond the capital of Tirana. To complete this picture of backwardness, there were few public schools; the population was largely illiterate and people lived as serfs in mountain clans whose only system of justice was an ancient code of honour and blood vengeance called Kanun.\n\nZog I was probably the strangest monarch of the 20th century. The Times called him ‘the bizarre King Zog’ and his biographer, Jason Tomes, quotes descriptions of him ranging from ‘a despotic brigand’ to ‘the last ruler of romance’. He created his throne for himself and as Europe’s only Muslim king ruled Europe’s most obscure country. Educated in Istanbul, Zogolli was the privileged son of an Ottoman bey.\n\nAfter youthful sojourns in Constantinople and Vienna, where he acquired a taste for café society and bespoke attire, he returned home and entered Albanian politics, being a signatory to the Albanian declaration of independence in 1912. Order broke down during the First World War as other Balkan countries tried to seize areas of Albania. A colonel in the revolutionary forces, he rallied 2,000 troops against the Turks in a remote area of Albania at the age of 17.\n\nHis countrymen heard of the bravery, and Zogolli became a part of national politics. He then changed his surname to Zogu to make it sound more Albanian. Educated and ambitious, Zogolli advanced rapidly in the fledgling Albanian state, becoming prime minister, then president, before crowning himself king. Inspired by his contemporary Muslim reformer in Ankara, Ataturk, he attempted to modernize his backward kingdom by introducing a European judicial system and universal primary education. A fiscal alliance with Italy opened the door to the world of progress.\n\nAfter the end of World War I in 1918, Albania had no government in power. When the Ottoman Turks left, Austrian and Hungarian forces came into the country before fleeing to defend their home territories. Italy occupied Albania soon after, but the provisional government implemented wasn’t accepted by the Albanian people. On February 23, 1924, as he entered Albania’s parliament, a man named Beqir Valteri shot Zog twice, once in the hand and another in the hip. The assembled leaders of Albania were aghast as Zog calmly sat down at his table to continue working. He then rose to speak, saying, “Such things happen often – we cannot tell when or where – and therefore let us take the matter calmly.” In other words, don’t tell the people about the assassination attempt. But word spread and the attempt on Zog’s life emboldened the opposition. Forces loyal to Zog then killed Avni Rustemi, a popular Albanian politician suspected of being involved with the assassination plot, on April 20, 1924. The high-profile killing served to make a point that the supposedly strong central government was anything but. Zog and his followers were forced into exile in June of 1924, but that wasn’t the end of his political machinations. He returned triumphantly in early 1925 and staged a successful coup.\n\nHe crossed the northern border into Albania with Yugoslav backing and an army of mercenaries recruited with money supplied by international oil companies and rich Albanian families. Another mercenary army, led by Zogu’s lieutenants, invaded from the south. Zogu swiftly established himself as Albania’s dictator with the title of president. He had his principal opponents murdered and ruled by force – there was no other effective way of ruling Albania – but Zogu realized that he could only survive with support from abroad and decided to rely on the Italians. A military alliance was signed in 1927 and Italy soon dominated Albania.\n\nIn 1928, with Italian approval, Zogu, who genuinely wanted to modernise his Ruritanian country, made his dictatorship permanent. A new Constituent Assembly, elected under strict control, proclaimed Albania a monarchy under Zog I, King of the Albanians. The king made his way to the ceremony in Tirana in an open car with an escort of cavalry past lines of soldiers, the streets were kept clear of spectators for fear of assassination. However, every house displayed the Albanian flag, with a black eagle rampant on a scarlet ground. The flags had been mass-imported from Italy on the cheap.\n\nIn the Parliament House the monarch stood on a dais to deafening applause and swore an oath on both the Koran and the Bible to maintain the country’s national unity, territorial integrity and independence. Loud cries of ‘Long live the king!’ accompanied him to his royal palace and six days of public holiday followed, with bonfires, firing of rockets and much slaughtering of sheep. Money from Benito Mussolini, to the tune of millions of dollars to build two opulent palaces, helped. During his coronation, Zog’s troops kept crowds to a minimum for fear of another assassination attempt. While Zog lived in opulence, peasants, farmers and former military men were extremely poor. In the early 1930’s, Zog became obsessed with his own personal security. His guards were his own Mati tribesmen, a people who had 400 years of history with Zog’s family.\n\nZog left Albania for Vienna in January of 1931 to seek medical attention. His ‘therapy’ included a trip to Vienna’s world-famous opera house. As the king entered his car after the performance, two former Albanian military members shot at him and his party again, one of more than 50 assassination attempts. Mussolini’s multi-million dollar loans to Zog came with a price, and while the King tried to minimize the imprint of Italy, the fascist state invaded Albania in 1939. Zog fled to Great Britain with $2 million in gold coins. He used the money to live the good life, including purchasing a 150-acre estate on Long Island. It was a retreat built for a king, but Zog never made it to America.\n\nBut King Zog was not without his enemies. The price of Italian investment was onerous and the psychological leap from clan to centralized government, somewhat contentious. It is reported that no fewer than six hundred blood feuds were issued against him and that he survived fifty-five assassination attempts, being wounded twice in gun battles with would-be killers: Zog, no coward and raised in a culture of sanctified killing, carried a loaded pistol with him at all times.\n\nIf such accounts sound apocryphal, one might well add the 200-cigarettes-a-day jag he is said to have adhered to faithfully. The European press portrayed Zog as a charming, exotic oddity. In formal photographs we see him decked out in the full despot regalia of the epoch: chest laden with outsized medals and ribbons, shoulders replete with gold-braided, tasselled epaulettes. He looks for all the world like Errol Flynn playing Chaplin’s Great Dictator, right down to the pencil-thin moustache, the insouciant smile and the rakish tilt of the visor cap.\n\nGiven the backwardness and poverty of an Albania that was still essentially feudal, Zog realised that the country needed large injections of external finance to achieve modernisation. Zog’s government had approached the newly formed League of Nations but to no avail [although Yugoslavia provided an early loan]. Needing more money to develop Zog eventually turned to fascist Italy and the two countries entered into talks. As a result of the 1926 Pact of Friendship and Security Albania secured loans of around 20 million lira from Mussolini – but in exchange for the loss of its independence in foreign policy. A second Tiranë Pact in 1927 netted Zog a further £140,000 at the cost of a further diminution of Albania’s sovereignty, Italy negotiated more influence over Albania’s militia [including control of its training]. Consequently the Italians ended up with a virtual protectorate over Albania.\n\nFollow up bilateral treaties tied Albania to Italy economically by monopolising its trade. Albania granted Italy new petroleum concessions and the right to build military fortifications on Albanian soil. These pacts kept Albania in a subordinate position with its economic development hamstrung, industrialisation was stagnant, having achieved little headway, by 1939 production was still predominantly agricultural and the state was forced to rely on imports from Italy, a situation that Rome was perfectly content to see persist.\n\nQueen Geraldine of the Albanians was one of the last survivors of the Ruritanian ambience of the interwar east European monarchies who lived in an insecure world between the threats of fascism, communism and democracy. As the wife of King Zog of Albania she shared the vicissitudes of her husband in his exile during and after the Second World War and after his death remained prominent in the world of the exiled European monarchs as the mother of the pretender to the throne, Prince Leka.\n\nShe was born Geraldine Apponyi in Buda, and is customarily referred to as a Hungarian countess, but, although her father was an impoverished Hungarian count, her mother was was Gladys Virginia Stewart, an American heiress. After a whirlwind engagement in Paris, they rushed off the platform of Geneva station to marry at St Joseph’s Church in 1914 before their connecting train arrived to take them to Hungary. Geraldine was born the following year, and enjoyed an idyllic childhood divided mostly between Vienna, where she received a Catholic education, and the vast rambling Apponyi family castle at Nagy Appony in Hungary. The Apponyi family could trace their descent back to the conquest of Hungary by Arpad in AD894, and the castle had been the family seat since 1280. After the First World War, it had been somewhat modernised by Geraldine’s father, who had disposed of the family palace in Budapest and other property in Paris and Vienna in order to ease the heavy burden of family debt. It was set in a huge empty forest, and provided an operatic background for the young Geraldine’s formative years.\n\nShe grew up as a bookish and intelligent young woman, and took a job as a librarian at the National Museum and developed an interest in Egyptology. She also attended balls, and it was at one, in the presence of Franz Lehar, the composer, that a photograph was taken that was to change her life. The photograph was seen by Ahmet Zogu, a northern tribal leader from the Mati river region of Albania who had become king in 1928. Their courtship took place in a somewhat stressful atmosphere, to the accompaniment of Leber waltzes and Albanian folk music. The engagement was announced the following year, and the wedding took place in April 1938 with Mussolini’s envoy, Count Ciano, as the witness.\n\nThey drove to their honeymoon in an enormous scarlet open-top, supercharged Mercedes-Benz, a present from Hitler. She enjoyed a period of immersing herself in the Albanian world, particularly the life of the women in his Mati heartland, where she wrote that the scale of the mountain forests made those of Switzerland seem small. But the decline of fortunes began in 1936 with the expulsion of Zog’s British advisers and with the beginning of full fascist annexation, and with the outbreak of the Second World War the family duly fled to exile to Greece, then France, then England, with a retinue of 500 retainers, officers and friends, many boxes of gold sovereigns, a personal arsenal, and little baby Leka, the heir to the throne.\n\nAfter the end of the war, and the communist victory under Enver Hoxha, the same peripatetic pattern of life continued, with periods in Egypt, as part of King Farouk’s court. There she formed a close friendship with the similarly exiled Queen Giovanna of Italy. The family moved to Cannes after the fall of the monarchy in Egypt, and then to Paris in January 1961. Handsome, courteous, reserved and ruthless, Zog was a chain-smoker who enjoyed western classical music and films starring Charlie Chaplin and Shirley Temple. Mussolini ousted him in 1939 and declared Albania an Italian protectorate. Zog went into exile, for part of the time comfortably installed in London’s Ritz Hotel, and died in France in 1961 at the age of 65. This loss could have reduced Geraldine to the role of a shadowy widow, but in the Albanian culture she had absorbed it did not, and she became the guardian of monarchist tradition, and a strong and partisan figure on behalf of her son, Prince Leka, who was consecrated King of the Albanians in a room in the Hotel Bristol in Paris on 5 April.\n\nAfter their expulsion from France as a result of problems with the French authorities linked to Prince Leka’s well-known proclivity for carrying numerous personal weapons, they moved to Spain, where they lived in a small villa that Geraldine’s friend Queen Margarita of Bulgaria had found for them. This good period did not last long, as the Spanish government also disliked the alleged links Leka had with the arms business, and Saudi Arabia was the next destination.\n\nThe final move was to South Africa, after other scrapes between Leka and various governments, including his arrest in Thailand. They remained near Johannesburg until returning to Albania in 2001, when, in company with Queen Susan, Leka’s Australian wife, they reclaimed the magnificent family residence behind the Hotel Bogner in Tirana from the Greek government which had been using it as their ambassador’s residence. In this sense, after many ups and downs, Geraldine returned to live the last months of her life as a loyal Albanian on the soil of her adopted country that she had left in chaos so many years before.\n\nIronically enough, of all the fanciful stories western journalists concocted about Zog, it is the least believable reportage that is the most remarkable: the claim that Albert Einstein spent three days in Tirana as Zog’s guest at the royal manor. Although a more unlikely social pairing would be difficult to imagine, it must be understood the visit was not a social one, and that Einstein was not alone in journeying to Albania. Scores of fellow Germans, Austrians, Hungarians, Czechs, Slavs, Greeks and others made their way to Zog’s isolated kingdom for the same singular purpose: to escape the Nazi death camps. For, despite his impoverished monarchy, despite the isolation and archaic circumstances of his kingdom, despite the fact that Albania was the only predominantly Muslim country in Europe, despite all we know of the Holocaust through literature and film, did something truly remarkable and singularly courageous in a world about to experience unimaginable cataclysm: he opened his borders to all those seeking safety from Nazi persecution. This act saved thousands of lives, and so, yes, one can imagine Albert and Ahmet deep in conversation, in a dense miasma of tobacco smoke, on the eve of destruction, for Albert was only one of thousands of Jews who were welcomed into this humble kingdom as honoured guests, sheltered and protected.\n\nMany German Jews were looking for refuge from the desperate situation at home. While the rest of Europe turned its back, Albania offered unconditional asylum. King Zog announced that all Jews residing in Albania could obtain citizenship. The next day fascist troops invaded, sending the king into exile and putting the Jews in jeopardy. In response Albanian families, most of them Muslim, gave their sacred oath, the ancient besa, to protect the refugees. In 2002, Norman Gershman journeyed to Albania to photograph Jews and the families who rescued them. There he met Rexhep Hoxha, the son of a pastry chef who had hidden a family of Bulgarian Jews, the Abadjens, in his home. The refugees had been forced to leave behind their sacred prayer books, and Hoxha’s father pledged to keep them till the Abadjens could someday return to Albania. Bringing the circle to a close, Gershman takes Hoxha to Israel, allowing him to fulfill the 66-year-old promise to the Jewish family he sheltered.\n\nThe door King Zog opened was for the ‘guests’ of his nation. Their protection and well-being in time of need was a matter of national pride, the pride of a people who, although isolated by geography and oppression, possessed a humanity that was universal. The Albanian people, it must be understood, did not hide their Jewish neighbours and foreign refugees from the occupying Nazis: acting as one, the entire nation, from their king to members of government down to the humblest peasant, made them all Albanians, issuing passports, letters of transit, identity cards, work permits, whatever documents were necessary to protect them, and welcomed them into their homes as aunts and uncles, brothers and sisters, grandmothers and grandfathers, at great risk to their own lives. In one brutal instance, the SS machine-gunned an entire village, ninety people, for refusing to provide lists of Jews within the country. Not one ‘guest’ was ever handed over. Albania was the only European country to have a larger Jewish population after the war than before it.\n\nKing Zog would have been shocked by the Albania into which the symphonic conductor Bujar Llapaj was born in 1956. The once fiercely independent people who had continually resisted Ottoman occupation, who defied the Nazis in saving thousands of guests at risk of losing their lives, no longer existed. By late 1944, while Zog languished in exile in England, the political vacuum created by the Nazi retreat from Albania was filled by a group of Communist partisans led by the enigmatic Marxist Enver Hoxha. Hoxha, a complex, paranoid sociopath, looked to Stalin and then Mao as role models, Khrushchev being far too progressive for his taste. Mao, quick to recognize a kindred malevolent spirit, admired Hoxha’s brutality in crushing his enemies and his total lack of empathy for his fellow man. The Chairman shipped Hoxha tons of grain while literally starving his own population to death. Hoxha, returning the compliment, created his own Cultural Revolution, a brutal campaign of dehumanization in which thousands were imprisoned and tortured.\n\nBy the 1960’s Hoxha had succeeded in erasing Albania from world consciousness, turning it into the North Korea of Europe: a failed totalitarian society from which no citizen escaped, and into which no outsider ventured. When he died in 1985, he bequeathed the citizens of the People’s Republic of Albania an average annual income of $15 a month. Today, Albania belongs to those post-communist nations generally designated by the West as emerging countries. Superficially, a pleasant patina of well-being coats the cities and towns, rural villages and agricultural lands we have seen and visited. Unfortunately, a cursory scratching at the surface reveals the crippling problems of a struggling economy and a political body being eaten away by corruption.\n\nThe Mafia Shqiptare is the general term used for criminal organizations based in Albania or composed of ethnic Albanians. Albanian organized crime is active in Europe, North America, South America, and various other parts of the world including the Middle East and Asia. The Albanian Mafia participates in a diverse range of criminal enterprises including trafficking in drugs, arms, humans, and human organs. The Albanian criminal scenario is characterized by diversified criminal plans which, in their complexity, show one of the highest criminal capacities in the world. In Albania alone, there are over 15 mafia families that control organized crime. According to WikiLeaks reports, the Albanian mafia has monopolized various international affiliations from as far east as Israel, to as far west as South America. These reports primarily indicate a strong connection between politicians and various Albanian mafia families. According to the Research Institute for European and American Studies [RIEAS], Albanian mafia groups are hybrid organizations often involved in both criminal and political activities.\n\nThe Albanian mafia, in its entirety, constitutes one of the highest crime generating elements in the world, combining traditional characteristics – plainly manifest in the rigid internal discipline, in the clan structure, which increases the impermeability, the reliability and the endogenous solidity – with modern and innovative elements. The massive logistics to almost anywhere has facilitated its establishment outside the mother country and its integration with the local criminality, exploiting the opportunities inherent in the entire compatriot network. In the United States, the term “Albanian Mafia” may include or refer specifically to various Albanian-American organized crime groups, such as the Rudaj Organization or Albanian Boys, both based in New York City.\n\nA lengthy News Corp Australia investigation has found that an Albanian Mafia group — led by some of Australia’s most wanted men — have established entrenched infiltration of almost every level of Australian society and according to Australian Federal Police: “European Organised Crime, primarily the Albanian Mafia is now one of the largest organised crime threats to Australia, so entrenched and disciplined and influential in local communities it has made this a serious challenge to crack.” The mostly Australian run group, led by former Kings Cross identity Vaso Ulić, a Montenegrin immigrant who left Australia in 2005 never to return, was now networked to become one of the biggest transnational crime groups in the world importing six tonnes a year into Australia alone but many more to and from other destinations from South Africa to Europe, China, Nigeria and the Americas with law enforcers from notably the United Kingdom, United States and Italy involved in their pursuance.\n\nVaso Ulic is a 55-year-old ethnic Montenegrin who migrated to Australia in 1979 and within a few years was working as a small-time foot soldier running drugs and cash along the infamous Golden Mile of Kings Cross but who is now seen as a kingpin of an organisation so big, very few drug consignments enter Australia without his knowledge or permission. It has been confirmed the prosecutions office in Montenegro, where Ulic is residing, has an extensive file on Ulic and other figures in the country as part of an international arrest warrant to break up the cartel. An internal police assessment relayed to the Federal Government claims their criminality now extends worldwide with direct Australian-Albanian Organized Crime links to notorious Mexican and Colombian clans and cartels and Asian triads including the 14K group, South African crime lords and Italian and Dutch criminal groups, with predominantly Melbourne, Sydney, Queensland, South Australia & Tasmania using motorcycle gangs as part of the national distribution & enforcement network for the Albanians.\n\n‘They’re sophisticated, clever – and they always deliver’: from the ports of Europe to the streets of London, one criminal network is now at the top of the UK’s £5bn cocaine trade. The gang, an Albanian street crew of drug dealers, is known locally for its violence and more widely for a social media output featuring Ferraris, wads of £50 notes and gold Rolex watches to help enhance its reputation and recruit youngers. Hellbanianz belong to the retail game of the cocaine trade. They are the street dealers and enforcers of the Mafia Shqiptare, the Albanian organised criminal syndicates who, the National Crime Agency believe, are consolidating power within the UK criminal underworld and on their way to a near total takeover of the UK’s cocaine market. The gang’s glossily produced trap music videos remind viewers “HB are ready for violence” and that they possess the requisite manpower and firearms. Yet, police sources say, Hellbanianz occupy the lowest rung of the Albanian mafia.\n\nHow Albanians came to conquer the UK’s cocaine market is a lesson in criminal savvy; the value of making friends with the world’s most dangerous mafias; and the absolute threat of violence. It began with a business model that was simple in concept, but sufficiently bold to subvert the existing order. For years cocaine’s international importers worked separately from its wholesalers and the gangs. Pricing structure varied, depending on the drug’s purity; the higher it was, the more it cost. The Albanians ditched the entire model. They began negotiating directly with the Colombian cartels who control coca production. Huge shipments were arranged direct from South America. Supply chains were kept in-house. Intelligence obtained by British experts revealed that the Albanians were procuring cocaine from the cartels for about £5,500 a kilo, at a time when rivals thought they were getting a decent deal using Dutch wholesalers selling at £22,500 a kilo. The Albanians lowered the price of cocaine – and increased its purity. More massive consignments were brought into the UK. Tony Saggers, the former head of drugs threat and intelligence at the National Crime Agency, who has spent 30 years analysing the rhythms of the global narcotics economy, said: “What they have done very intelligently is say: ‘OK, we’ve got these margins to play with and we’re going to give a good slice of that to the customer.’”\n\nThe Albanian effect has profoundly shaped the use, production and economy of cocaine. The drug is at its cheapest in the UK since 1990 and purer than it has been for a decade, which has caused record fatalities. The UK has the highest number of young users in Europe. More broadly, far bigger and more frequent shipments of the drug have been seized entering the UK as cocaine production in south America has hit record levels – up 31% on 2016. Rivals to the Albanian gangs like Hellbanianz initially struggled to compete because they had an inferior, more expensive product. Their only option has been to buy cocaine sourced from the Mafia Shqiptare. Mohammed Qasim, a research fellow at Leeds Beckett University who studies drug dealers, described the Albanian business approach as fantastic, adding: “If they were on Dragon’s Den with this model, all the dragons would be giving them money.”\n\nYet for the Albanians’ model to truly work it required control of Europe’s ports. Rotterdam in the Netherlands is Europe’s largest seaport, with eight million containers passing through each year. Many arrive via the direct Colombian express route before crossing to Harwich in Essex or Hull. Collectively, the Belgian and Dutch ports employ 240,000 people, a cohort of whom, police intelligence indicates, work for the ‘Ndrangheta and Mafia Shqiptare. “This gives the Albanians based on the near continent, direct access and control of it [cocaine] at the ports”.\n\nOne striking facet of what the NCA term the Albanians’ increasing prominence is their having, so far, avoided becoming embroiled in tit-for-tat feuds with rivals. The latest UK criminal threat assessment says that the Albanians are unusually skilled at developing relationships and forging links with other OCGs [organised criminal gangs]. Also working in the Albanians’ favour is their reputation for violence. They are quite charismatic and known to prioritise relationship-building rather than competitive feuds. Also, when you come from a country where there’s been conflict and you have a reputation for ruthlessness the charisma is underlined with an element of ‘actually, we do need to get on with these people’.\n\nQasim also points to how the Albanian are regarded in criminal circles. “They are sophisticated, professional and they do what they promise. They always deliver,” he said. This has much to do with the Albanian code of besa – “to keep the promise” – but Sergi adds that the reputation of the Mafia Shqiptare must also be viewed through the ancestral code of kanun, the right to take revenge: that blood must pay with blood. “You most trust the ones similar to you,” she said. The concept was meant to keep things internal, close. Then the younger generation began making flashy videos and waving money around, and along came Hellbanianz. By the time of the 2011 census, Albanian was the second language on the estates. Some might recognise the faces from YouTube where Hellbanianz posts footage to try to lure “falcons” – fresh recruits – with shots of scantily clad women, wheel-spinning Bentleys and the ubiquitious wads of money. The retail market is the get-rich-quick environment. If they’re importing kilos for a few thousand dollars, imagine how much money those youngsters are turning over if they’re selling at £40 a gram? Before its account was closed in November, Hellbanianz had 115,000 Instagram followers. The video for Hood Life, which opens with a drone shot of the Gascoigne estate, has been watched more than 7.5 m times. Their latest video, released in late October 2018, states they are “ready for war”.\n\nSuch antics help explain why Albanians are the third largest foreign nationality in UK prisons. The figure is even more startling when considering the tiny number of UK organised criminals the NCA believes are Albanian – 0.8%. Hellbanianz’s high life – the bling, the violence – has fostered tensions within the Albanian community, particularly the goading of police. The Hood Life video shows gang members surrounding a Met patrol car. “This goes against the Albanian culture. Some of their higher end drug dealers, international traders, don’t like this behaviour. It exposes their activities. They want to be low-key, making profits without being caught,” said Qasim. Meanwhile, so long as Mafia Shqiptare keeps delivering their cocaine, recruiting teenagers to the Hellbanianz gangster life has never been easier.\n\nThe political and numismatic history of Central and South America began immediately after the discovery of San Salvador by Cristóbal Colón in 1492. Under the terms of the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas, which divided the newly discovered lands outside of Europe between Spain and Portugal along an imaginary north-south line 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands, Spain was to receive sole control over the New World. Because the terms failed to take into account the location of the continent of South America in relation to the boundary line, the tip of what is modern-day Brazil came under Portuguese control. For this reason, while the rest of Central and South America became part of the Spanish Empire and followed the currency system of Spain, Brazil’s coinage is based on that of Portugal.\n\nTo control all Spanish exploration and colonization, and to collect import duties and taxes of all goods entering Spain, the Casa y Audiencia de Indias, more commonly known as the Casa de Contratación, was established in Seville. The Spanish colonization of the Americas, involved numerous adventurers, known as conquistadors, and religious missionaries [the Dominicans, Franciscans, and Jesuits], groups that emphasized the primary overseas aims of the Spanish government – conquest of new territory for raw materials, particularly gold and silver, and religious conversion of the local native populations to Christianity [i.e. Roman Catholicism]. Four main expeditionary areas comprise this early period of colonization:\n\nMexico and the Yucatán,\n\nPeru,\n\nthe Río de la Plata and Paraguay, and\n\nthe Nuevo Reino de Granada.\n\nEmploying technological advantages [the horse, armor, and the gun], possessing an immunity to European diseases, and manipulating local tribal animosity, the conquistadors were eventually able to overpower and subdue much larger native forces. In Peru, Francisco Pizarro González began the process with his capture of the Sapa Inka Athualpa. Because of the region’s mountainous terrain, it was not until 1572 that the Inca Empire was finally conquered. In 1527, the first Spanish settlement in the Río de la Plata was created with the Fort of the Sancti Spiritu, followed in 1536 by the establishment of Buenos Aires and in 1537, Asunción. Because the site suffered from numerous native attacks, the original site of Buenos Aires was abandoned in 1541; in 1580, the governor of Paraguay, the conquistador Juan de Garay, established a new settlement at the site of the modern-day city.\n\nFinally, between 1537 and 1543, six Spanish expeditions entered the highlands of Colombia. In 1536, the conquistador Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada defeated the local Chibchas and founded the city of Santa Fé de Bogotá and named the surrounding area El nuevo reino de Granada. Following the conquest of the Aztecs, in 1521 the Viceroyalty of New Spain was established. At its greatest extent, it governed Spanish-held territories in the Caribbean and Florida, Mexico and Central America, most of the United States west of the Mississippi and into Canada, and the Philippines. This was followed in 1542 by the creation of the Viceroyalty of Peru, which consisted of the continent of South America, with the exception of Brazil. In 1717, the Virreinato de la Nueva Granada was added, and Virreinato del Río de la Plata in 1776. Until the independence movement in the 1820’s, it was through this system that the Spanish monarchy governed its overseas possessions in the New World.\n\nThe New World territories used the Spanish monetary system of the coinage first instituted by Fernando and Isabella in Medina del Campo in 1497, consisting of silver reales [and its multiples and fractions].In 1535, the gold escudo replaced the gold excelente and thenceforth, this became the basis for all the colonial coinage of Spanish America. The discovery of local sources of both gold and silver, particularly the Cerro Rico in Potosí, Bolivia [which provided Spain 41,000 metric tons of silver between 1556 and 1783], necessitated the creation of a number of new mints, not only for local consumption, but also for the export of the quinto real, or crown’s portion, sent back to the Casa de Contratación on the large plate fleets.\n\nThe Mexico City mint [established in 1535] was one of the most important of these mints; the other, Potosí [established in 1574], was located at the source of the ore. Later, other mints were established and operated from time to time to handle the discovery and export of the metal. Until the eighteenth century, hammered coin age was struck. Known as macuquinas, or cobs, these coins became associated with later images of pieces of eight [due to eight reales being cut into pieces for fractions], and pirates on the Spanish Main.\n\nFollowing the introduction under Felipe V of milled coinage, which increased the efficiency of production and provided against clipping or shaving – a process whereby minute traces of the metal might be removed and pocketed as the coinage passed from hand to hand – the coinage of Spain’s New World empire became a medium of international exchange, even after Spain’s former colonies gained independence. Before issuing their own coinage, the early Republics countermarked existing colonial issues as currency. Even Great Britain, during its coinage shortage of the late eighteenth century circulated both four and eight reales with a counterstamp of King George III. And in the currency-strapped American colonies and United States, the eight reales, or so-called ‘Pillar Dollar’, circulated well into the nineteenth century. Folk etymology attributes the origin of the dollar sign to the filleted pillars in the reales’ design.\n\nNapoleon’s invasion of the Iberian Peninsula and the flight of the Portuguese royal family to Brazil in 1807, as well as the events surrounding the abdications of both Spanish monarchs, Carlos IV and Fernando VII between March and May 1808, sparked a number of uprisings in the Spanish America, a situation that was exacerbated by the installation of Joseph Bonaparte as king of Spain, and the Peninsular War. The earliest revolts were the short-lived governing juntas, or popular governments, in Bolivia, and Ecuador. In Mexico, a similar attempt at independence was made under Miguel Hidalgo, but was soon put down. While those in the Nueva Granada, Venezuela, Chile, and Río de la Plata were more successful, this period was marked by a myriad of these juntas and a great deal of conflict with pro-independence and royalist sides forming up against each other.\n\nThe restoration of Fernando VII to the Spanish throne in 1813 brought matters to a head. Committed to re-instituting absolutist rule both at home and throughout the empire, Fernando declared those independence movements that had developed during his exile as illegal and began sending troops to quell those areas ‘still in rebellion’. Known as the Reconquista, an allusion to the Reconquista of Medieval Spain, this attempt served to coalesce those pro-independence areas into a full-scale counter insurgency; it also precipitated revolts against the Spanish monarchy.\n\nOut of this conflict arose a number of libertadores, who became the principal architects of independence in Central and South America. Among them, Simón Bolívar (1783-1830) became the most prominent. He led Venezuela [together with Antonio José de Sucre], Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Peru [together with José de San Martín, the libertador of Argentina] to independence, and in 1819 became the first president of the republic of Gran Colombia, a position he held until his death in 1830. These libertadores became the national heroes of the new republics, and became a vital component of the new states’ currency. To commemorate his achievement in its independence, the Republic of Venezuela in 1879 created the Bolívar, a new currency which, with its multiples and fractions, replaced the old venezolano. In Ecuador, the Sucre was established, named for Antonio José de Sucre. Although others adopted more localized names – such as the Peruvian sol, or the Bolivian boliviano – Central and South America’s long-standing economic dependency on Spain compelled them to retain that state’s currency system and denominations, the real and the peso.\n\nWith the establishment of the Trienio Liberal in Spain, the nascent republics in Central and South America were consolidated and fully independent republics were established. Argentina and Chile, both of which had gained independence in 1818, and Gran Colombia, or the República de Colombia, independent in 1819, were among the first. From 1821 to 1823, Agustín de Iturbide ruled the short-lived Imperio Mexicano, or independent monarchy of Mexico, and between 1823 and 1838/41, the present-day countries of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica were joined in the República Federal de Centro América. By 1825, only a few pockets of royalists remained, carrying on a guerrilla war until 1832 With the death of Fernando VII in 1833, Spain at last abandoned any hope of military reconquest; in 1836, its government renounced all sovereignty over continental America.\n\nCOLOMBIA\n\nIn 1622, under a licence purchased from King Philip III of Spain, Turrillo de Yebra established a mint at Santa Fe de Bogotá and a branch mint at Cartagena de las Indias, where gold cobs were produced as part of Colombia’s first currency. Silver milled coins date from 1627. During the 18th century, official coin standards changed more than once. Older coins remained in circulation, so that three types of milled gold coin and two types of silver coin were circulating at the beginning of the 19th century. Furthermore, old silver macuquinas (cobs) also remained in circulation. The Bogotá mint began producing milled coins in 1756. A second mint opened at Popayán in 1758. Both mints produced gold escudos of the milled bust type, and a very limited number of milled silver coins. Most of the silver coin circulating in New Granada was from the Spanish mints in Mexico City and Potosí.\n\nIn 1831, Gran Colombia dissolved into Venezuela and New Granada where new monetary laws were passed, to standardise the money produced. From 1861-1862, due to financial instability, the United States of New Granada accepted British currency, the name of the country becoming the United States of Colombia. In 1880, Colombia pegged the peso to the gold standard due to the falling price of silver. In 1886, the paper peso was introduced. In 1931, Colombia abandoned the gold standard and switched to the current form of the peso.\n\nIn 1811 the Junta Patriótica de Cartagena authorized coins of 1/2 and 2 reales, and for want of silver, they were minted in copper. A law of 23 March 1812 authorized the government of Cartagena to issue up to 300,000 pesos fuertes (strong pesos) in notes of one real, but the general public, accustomed to metallic currency, avoided the paper money. To make matters worse, the notes were easily counterfeited. They rapidly fell in value until 100 pesos in paper was worth only 16 pesos in gold. The notes were used to pay the troops, but this stopped when soldiers began deserting. Finally, the government agreed to exchange the notes for treasury certificates paying 5% and renewable every four months. The copper coins, on the other hand, were well received and continued to be produced until 1815.\n\n1820 Colombia 8 Reales (Republic of Colombia-Gran Colombia) Silver\n\nGran Colombia introduced a national currency inscribed “República de Colombia”, minting silver and gold at Bogotá and Popayán, and copper cuartillos at Caracas. Copper coin was made legal tender to one peso fuerte. Colombia’s currency was composed of a variety of coins, pre-1772 pesos, pesos of the 1772 and 1786 standards, macuquinas (cobs) of diverse types, and various coins minted by republicans and royalists during the wars of independence. This situation would continue for decades despite several attempts to unify the currency.\n\nThe monetary law of 1836 attempted to standardize the coinage by establishing uniform fineness, weight, value, type, and denominations. It confirmed the silver standard as .903 fine. The name colombiano was changed to granadino for both gold and silver. Gold, however, did not circulate in Colombia during the 1830’s; it was either hoarded or exported.\n\nThe silver real became the official monetary unit in 1846. All silver and gold coins were to be .900 fine. Silver coins would be the peso, peseta, real, and medio. Gold coins would be the onza, cóndor, doblón, and escudo. The peseta was equal to the silver franc, the escudo to the gold napoleón [20 franc piece]. There would be two coins of pure copper: a décimo de real and its half, legal tender to 2 reales. The décimo was equivalent to the French and Belgian 5 centimes and to the cent of the United States.\n\nIn 1893 it was learned that secret note issues had pushed circulation past 12 million pesos so Congress decided to liquidate Banco Nacional. But the bank’s existence was extended to 1 January 1896, while it issued another 5 million pesos to cover the costs of the 1895 civil war. The end of the bank was not, however, the end of paper curency. In 1898–1899, despite the fact that the bank no longer existed, the Government put $22 million in notes of Banco Nacional into circulation.\n\nThe period 1899–1903 witnessed revolution, civil war, inflation, and depreciation. There were numerous note issues of various kinds. Then calm slowly returned. A law of 25 October 1903 prohibited new paper money issues, permitted payment in gold to be stipulated in contracts, and reintroduced the gold peso equal to 100 paper pesos, effective 1 January 1904. Outstanding notes were absorbed by auction sales of gold.\n\nSpanish Colonial Coinage\n\nSpanish colonials circulated freely during the colonial period of the New World, both North America and South America. The same coins were minted in the Spanish colonies of Bolivia, Chile, Columbia, Guatemala, Mexico, and Peru, from the early 1600s to the early 1800s. They circulated as far north as Canada and as far east as Florida.\n\nMethods of manufacture – There are two major types of Spanish colonials. At the highest level there are cob coins and there are milled coins. Both come in gold and silver. The rich deposits of precious metal in the New World were hacked into chunks of specific weight and struck with heavy hammers between crude, hardmetal dies. The strike imparted a Spanish pattern, or part of a Spanish pattern, into the coin. The Spanish word cabo refers to the end of the bar. The size, shape and impression of these cobs was highly irregular. Eventually the crude manufacture of cob coins was replaced by more modern minting technology. Milled coins were made by rolling the silver and gold into sheets of uniform thickness and punching out coin blanks, or planchets, for striking in large screw presses.\n\nMint Marks – Mint marks are important because they indicate the country of origin. A few of the major mint marks for New World Spanish colonials include:\n\nAssayer Initials – In addition to mint marks, the collector should discern assayer initials. Assayers were people at the mints whose job it was to ensure proper weight and purity of the precious metal in the coin. Usually their initials appear as two or more letters prominently displayed on the coin, but sometimes a single letter appears.\n\nSummary – To completely identify a Spanish colonial coin, you need:\n\n• The date, either explicitly on the coin or by Spanish ruler\n\n• The method of manufacture, cob or milled\n\n• The numeric denomination, e.g., 1 real, 2 escudos, 8 reales\n\n• The country of origin, as coded by the mint mark\n\n• The assayer initials\n\nSilver with king’s bust – Milled coins with a King’s likeness are generally newer\n\nthan other types, spanning from Carol III to Ferdinand VII (1759 to 1833). 4 reales\n\nare generally more rare and command two or three times the value of 8 reales.\n\nCrowned arms between pillars – This pattern is always paired with silver busts. The example in the picture is a 4 reales (4R) from Chile (Santiago mint) with assayer initials F and J. These are sometimes called pillar dollars, but there are other Spanish colonials with pillars, so the name is misleading. The coat of arms with lions and castles is a classic symbol of Spain.\n\nGold with king’s bust – Bust gold coins date as far back as Philip V and span through Ferdinand VII (1700 to 1833). These are valuable coins. For instance, a 1764 8 escudos from Mexico with assayers MF catalogs at $11500 in well preserved condition.\n\nGold flared arms with Order chain – This is the most recent reverse for bust gold Spanish colonials, starting around 1770. The coat of arms is flared a the top and encircled by a chain. The chain, with a sheepskin at the bottom, is from the Order of the Golden Fleece, an order of chivalry founded in 1430. The example in the picture is an 8 escudos (8S) from Bolivia (Potosi mint) with assayer initials P and J.\n\nGold royal arms with Order chain – The earliest bust milled gold coins had a royal Spanish arms on the reverse, starting in 1732 and continuing through about 1760. The same royal arms appears on silver coins. The gold coin in the picture is from Mexico (with the oM mint mark) but the denomination is not shown explicitly. It must be determined from the size and weight of the coin.\n\nGold royal arms no chain – Some of the smaller denomination gold bust coins omit the chain around the royal arms. There is also a silver version of this no-chain pattern.\n\nHemispheres between pillars – These are the pillar dollars most often referred to. The VTRAQUE VNUM inscription appears over a Spanish crown that links Old and New Worlds together. The pillars bear a PLUS ULTRA inscription and are usually called the pillars of Hercules because they form a portal to both worlds, approached through the wavy sea beneath. The sample in the picture comes from Peru (Lima mint mark). Dates span from the 1730s to the 1770s.\n\nSilver royal arms – These are almost always milled coins, but Guatemala used this pattern on a few cobs between 1733 and 1753. The coin in the picture is an 8 reales of Fernando VI with assayer initials MF. The other side has the mint mark (Mexico City).\n\nSilver Jerusalem cross – Silver cobs from Mexico City have a Jerusalem cross on one side. The cross can be plain or with foils around it. Castles and lions appear in the angles of the cross. Cobs date back before 1600 to the early 1700s.\n\nGold Jerusalem cross – Almost all gold cobs have a Jerusalem cross on one side. The cross has prominent foils around it or a circle of dots. Sometimes castles and lions appear in the angles of the cross, but not always. The pictured coin has a quatrefoil and fluers de lis in the angles. These are very valuable coins. Gold cobs were produced in Colombia, Mexico, and Peru.\n\nGold crowned shield – A crowned shield with the Spanish coat of arms is often paired with the Jerusalem cross on gold cobs. Quite visible is the crown, the oM (Mexico City) mint mark, the assayer initial I or J, and a clear date of 1714. The denomination does not show on the coin, but from its size and weight it is easily identified as an 8 escudos. The initial is Jose E deLeon, who served as assayer between 1708 and 1723. These Escudos were produced only in Colombia and Mexico.\n\nGold pillars and waves – Instead of a crowned shield, some gold cobs use this pillars and waves design. The L – 8 – M on the top row gives the mint mark (Lima), the denomination (8 escudos), and the assayer initial. The middle row, P – V – A, is an abbreviation for PLUS ULTRA or more beyond. The bottom row, just above the waves, gives the date as 1718. This is a very valuable coin. Collectors will pay premiums for visible components such as these. Escudos with pillars and waves were produced only in Peru.\n\nWhen the colony of New South Wales was established in 1788 , no provision was made for an internal currency. There were no banks for some time and of course, no central bank. This produced a period of chaotic currency arrangements and experiments in the colony. In the early years, the colonists had to rely on barter – the exchange of produce, goods and services – and other makeshift currencies such as rum [as all spirits were then called]. Coin was very scarce in the early years with England also suffering from a coin shortage.\n\nAfter a period of relative isolation in the first years, the colony was increasingly drawn into Asian trading networks where a variety of currencies were in use. Handwritten notes of credit, rum, tobacco, grain and other commodities were also used as currencies of exchange in the young colony. In 1800 Governor King attempted to regulate the value of coinage circulating in the colony by importing 132,000 copper pennies and by issuing a proclamation: these coins are therefore known as ‘proclamation coins’.\n\nThis supply of copper having been sent to relieve the inconvenience of persons requiring to make small payments, no persons are to collect the same for the purpose of making large payments, nor shall it be deemed a legal tender to offer the same in payment for any sum exceeding five pounds.\n\nAnd it is hereby declared that the exportation or importation, except from His Majesty’s Treasury, of any sum exceeding five pounds of the above-named copper coin, shall be punished with a fine of treble the value, and forfeiture of the sum exported or imported.\n\nThe proclamation included:\n\nGold Guinea = 1 pound 2 shillings\n\nThe guinea was a coin of approximately one quarter ounce of gold minted in Great Britain between 1663 and 1814. The name came from the Guinea region in West Africa, where much of the gold used to make the coins originated. It was the first English machine-struck gold coin, originally worth one pound sterling, equal to twenty shillings, but rises in the price of gold relative to silver caused the value of the guinea to increase, at times to as high as thirty shillings. From 1717 to 1816, its value was officially fixed at twenty-one shillings.\n\nGold Johanna = 4 pounds, and Gold Half Johanna = 2 pounds\n\nGold Mohur = 1 pound 17 shillings\n\nGold Pagoda = 8 shillings\n\nThese small gold coins were a standard in southern India from the late 16th century. India, at the time, comprised a number of separate kingdoms, some of which were self governing and others which were ruled by the British, French, and the Dutch. It is commonly accepted that the gold pagoda mentioned in the proclamation was that minted by the British East India company from 1740 to 1807 as the British link ensured that the coins found their way to many of the English colonies.\n\nThe gold pagodas were minted using the ancient hammering technique. Basically small discs or blobs of gold of the correct mass were placed on a reverse die, and the obverse die [the so called hammer die] hammered into the blank coin producing the design. This resulted in an iregularly shaped coin that was often weakly struck and show cracks along the edge. The pagoda was issued by various dynasties in medieval southern India, including the Kadambas, and the Vijaynagar Empire. There were two types of pagoda coined by foreign traders. The most valuable was the star pagoda, worth approximately 8 shillings issued by the East India Company at Madras. The second was the Porto Novo pagoda, issued by the Dutch at Tuticorin and also by the Nawabs of Arcot, and worth about 25% less than the star pagoda. The French struck local gold “pagodas” and silver “fanams” under contract by the nawabs.\n\nSilver Rupee = 2 shillings and 6 pence\n\nSilver rupees were being struck in nearly 30 different Indian provinces at the time. Rupees could be crudely struck or more modern examples struck in a milled coining press. By the time of the proclamation the silver rupee being struck by the British East India Company from 1773 are the most commonly accepted ‘proclamation rupees’ and were minted in the style of the Mughal Empire. These EIC rupees were known as ‘sicca’ rupees, with the obverse showing an Arabic inscription. The reverse of the EIC sicca rupees did not vary regardless of where the coin was struck preventing money changers and merchants in the capital city of Murshidabad discounting the value of rupees minted elsewhere.\n\nSilver 8 Reales = 5 shillings\n\nThe 8 reales coin of Spain and her colonies was probably the best known coin in the world at the time of Australian proclamation. Spanish milled dollars, also famously known as pieces of 8, were struck from 1732 until 1826. Before 1732 these coins were created by hammering the design onto irregularly shaped cobs cut from silver bars. From 1732 until 1773 Spanish Silver dollars were minted with the Spanish coat of arms on one side and the familiar Pillars of Hercules on the other, and consequently were known as ‘pillar dollars’. From 1773 onward the coat of arms gave way to a portrait of the Spanish monarch, thus known as ‘portrait dollars’.\n\nSpanish dollars were minted in several different mints, in several different countries, and with many different assayers initials on the pillar side of the coin. Minted from about 27 grams of 0.913 fine silver the Spanish silver dollar formed the basis of silver dollars from many different countries for almost the next 200 years. It was the model for the US silver dollar and legal tender in the USA until the 1860’s. Other countries minted silver coins similar to the Spanish 8R, including Great Britain, China, Japan, Mexico, many different South American countries, and even France.\n\nThis website has all the details of Spanish Currency.\n\nSpanish dollars were sometimes cut into “pieces of eight”, quarters, and then into 2/3 and 1/3 segments, with the 2/3 segments [1/6 of original coin] being “shillings” and the 1/3 segments [1/12 of original coin] “sixpences”.\n\nGold Ducat = 9 shillings and 6 pence\n\nDucats were an international trade coin of Europe that were first minted in Venice in the 13th century and first minted by the Dutch in 1589. Several European countries still mint ducats of the same size and gold content as have been minted for 500 years or more. The Dutch ducat is likely to have been named specifically in the Proclamation of 1800 because of the proximity of the Dutch East Indies and the Dutch influence over the areas controlled by the British East India Company.\n\nSilver Gulden = 2 shillings\n\nSilver guilders were minted from the late 17th century to the early 19th century in most of the provinces of what would become the Netherlands in 1815. In 1795 the provinces were united as the Batavian Republic.\n\nGreat Britain, Silver Shilling = 1 shilling and 1 penny\n\nThe 1787 Shilling of Great Britain traded in early colonial Australia. Minted from about 6 grams of sterling silver King George III minted shillings sporadically in the 18th century and 1787 was the biggest mintage of shillings under his reign until the great re-coinage began in 1816.\n\nGreat Britain, Cartwheel Copper Penny = 2 pence\n\nThese large copper coins were struck in the years 1797 to 1799. Their large distinctive raised rims were reminiscent of cartwheels and they were nicknamed accordingly. The cartwheel penny and twopence were the first coins minted anywhere in the world using steam powered coin presses, and this new technology allowed the mass production of a well struck yet very large coin. The coins themselves weighed exactly 1 ounce or 28.35g. This was intentional and allowed the coins [and their 2 penny brethren which weighed 2 oz] to be used as weights for scales.\n\nThe coins were minted at the Soho mint [the mint mark is visible on the reverse] in Birmingham. The mint itself was setup by Matthew Boulton, the well known 18th factory owner and manufacturer. His mint used steam powered coin presses, with the steam engines designed and manufactured with his business partner and steam engine pioneer James Watt.\n\n[Much of the above has been reproduced with permission from:\n\nhttp://www.australian-coins.com/australian-proclamation-coins ]\n\nIn 1812, Governor Lachlan Macquarie bought Spanish dollar coins, following the arrival of the ship Samarang at Port Jackson with 40,000 Spanish dollars, paying four shillings and nine pence for each dollar. He was worried that the coins would quickly be exported out of the colony and had holes cut in the middle of them to try to keep them in Australia. These were known as Holey dollars, valued at five shillings, with the piece from the middle being called the Dump, valued at around 15 pence). Both were declared legal currency in September 1813 and went into circulation in 1814. Despite stiff penalties for exporting this coin, it remained scarce.\n\nThe Commissariat, which controlled the issue of stores to troops and convicts, bought goods produced by private enterprise paying for them with store receipts. These receipts served as a medium of exchange up to the 1820s but they were for unwieldy amounts. The Commissariat began to issue its own notes, which were equivalent to those of the Bank of New South Wales, established in 1817.\n\nBecause of the persistent shortage of coin and the limitations of other currencies, promissory notes or IOUs also soon came into general use. Squatters’ cheques were a form of IOU in specific districts. These IOUs, however, were vulnerable to forgery and had no collateral backing. Promissory notes became known as shinplasters, a term describing a paper currency thought to be only worth soaking in vinegar as a poultice for bruises. These notes mostly fell apart quickly in the pockets or boots of customers, thereby saving the issuer from having to redeem them in coin. From the late 1840s, copper tokens were issued by businesses as small change to relieve the coin shortage but, like paper IOUs, had no backing or official guarantee.\n\nThe mining of gold from the 1850s set off a long period of prosperity. Immigration increased rapidly. The population tripled to three million between 1858 and 1889. The economy diversified. Urbanisation continued with two thirds of the population living in towns by the late 1880s. Melbourne was the largest city during this time. The discovery of gold led to the minting of Australia’s own gold coins. Australia’s first gold ‘coin’ is issued in 1852 to meet the urgent need for currency in South Australia. Made by the short-lived Adelaide Assay Office from gold brought back from the Victorian gold rush, it was issued without approval from Britain – and thus technically illegal .\n\nThe History of the 1852 Adelaide Ingot and Adelaide Pound\n\nThe 1852 Adelaide Pound is Australia’s first gold coin, minted in response to problems caused by the discovery of gold at Mount Alexander [Victoria] in November 1851. It is one of Australia’s rarest and most coveted coins, and is seldom seen on the collector market. The story surrounding its conception, production and withdrawal has several threads that have been shown to have enduring appeal – the perseverance and foresight of George Tinline; the leadership of Sir Henry Young; the ingenuity of the Assay Office staff and the enterprise of all those that flocked to the goldfields are all stories that strike a chord with Australians in the 21st century.\n\nOnce the discovery of gold at Mount Alexander became known in Adelaide, over 8,000 men [from a total population of approximately 50,000] decamped to the goldfields. The impact of this gold rush included. The crippling effects of this labor drain were further compounded by the Adelaide monetary system being bled dry of circulating coinage. This made it almost impossible to conduct even the simplest daily transaction, and business largely ground to a halt. Matters did not improve until some of the men began to return to Adelaide in early January 1852, bringing with them some £50,000 worth of gold.\n\nOwing to the scarcity of coinage, merchants and bankers were forced to accept gold nuggets and dust in payment for goods. It did not take them long to petition the colonial government to intervene and establish a mint, an action that would be in direct conflict with the Royal prerogative. If he permitted the minting of coins he would in effect contravene the Royal prerogative, while if he disallowed them he would undoubtedly earn the ire of Adelaide’s merchants & bankers.\n\nNot only would approval be required from London before any such planning could be brought to fruition, but legislation would also have to be passed. This potential delay was obviously exacerbated by the time taken to travel between London and Adelaide, around 90 days. The Executive Council decided that the raw gold arriving in the colony could be converted into a form that would benefit the economy without coins needing to be produced. And so the following solution was reached: raw gold could be taken to an assay office, where it would be refined and made into ingots, then stamped to indicate their weight and purity. These ingots could then be taken to one of the banks and offered as security against an issue of currency notes to the value of the gold. It was reasoned that business would be facilitated through the availability of these currency notes, and the royal prerogative on the issue of currency would remain inviolate.\n\nOf the many Adelaide Ingots that were produced between March 4th 1852 and late 1852, just eight remain in existence. Six of the Adelaide Ingots are in public collections around the world, and only two in private hands . The rare Adelaide Ingots are rightly regarded as being integral to the history of Australian numismatics, and are highly coveted by collectors the nation over.\n\n1899 The Perth Mint\n\nThe third branch of the Royal Mint in Australia opened in 1899 following the discovery of large quantities of gold in Western Australia. Like the Sydney Mint and Melbourne Mint it produced gold sovereigns – more than 106 million by 1931. Instead of closure like its elder siblings, the Perth Mint found new purpose in the modern era under the ownership of the State Government of Western Australia.\n\n1910 First Commonwealth Coinage\n\nThe Commonwealth of Australia was proclaimed on 1 January 1901 and under the new Constitution the control of currency was vested in the Commonwealth. British coins continued in circulation until the Government took steps to introduce distinctive Australian coins under the 1909 Coinage Act. The first Australian florin, shilling, sixpence and threepence were issued in 1910.\n\n1919 Kookaburra Patterns\n\nIn 1919, the Commonwealth Government considered replacing bulky copper coins with smaller and lighter issues. Between 1919 and 1921, a memorable series of square-shaped penny and half-penny prototypes were struck, each featuring a kookaburra design. But they were never officially circulated because of technical problems and resistance from, among others, vending machine operators!\n\n1930 Australian Penny\n\nNo pennies were officially ordered by the Commonwealth Government for release in 1930. Nevertheless, a small number made in Melbourne, were released into circulation. The 1930 penny was destined to become the best known rare Australian coin and the proof examples, of which there are just six in existence, represent the holy grail of Australian numismatics.\n\nThe Australian Florin.\n\nThe Australian Florin was minted from 1910 until 1963 prior to the changeover to decimal currency in 1966. For the first 7 years it was minted in London. For the rest of the life of the coin was mostly minted in Australia in either Melbourne or Sydney. The only exceptions to this were during World War 2 when some of the 1942/43/44 coins were also minted in the USA.\n\nThe Australian Florin was minted with 7 obverses, the Edward VII Florin, the 1927 Parliament Florin,\n\nthe 1934-35 Centenary Florin, the George V Florin,\n\nthe George VI Florin, the Elizabeth II Florin.\n\nSix reverse designs were used for Australian florins, the Coat of Arms reverse by W.H.J. Blakemore was the standard design until 1938. Then an updated Coat of Arms reverse was designed by George Kruger Gray and it was used until 1963. In 1951 the the Federation Florin saw a commemorative reverse design used, as did 1954 when the the Royal Visit Florin was issued.\n\nLike all other pre-decimal Australian coinage the florin [2 shillings] was based on the silver standard minted in sterling silver [92.5% silver, 7.5% copper] from 1910 till 1945. In 1946 the coins were debased to 50% silver, 40% copper, 5% nickel, and 5% zinc. The debasement resulted from Australia needing to pay off its’ huge debts incurred during World War 2.\n\n1965 Royal Australian Mint\n\nThe Royal Australian Mint was established in the national capital, Canberra – the first mint in Australia not to be a branch of the Royal Mint in London. The Duke of Edinburgh opens its doors on 22 February 1965, a year before the introduction of decimal coinage, for which it is primarily intended. As well as billions of circulating coins, the national mint also makes medals, medallions, tokens and Australian collectable coins.\n\n1966 Decimalisation\n\nOn the 14th February 1966, Australia introduced decimal notes and coins, marking the end of the British-style currency system of pounds, shillings and pence. To emphasize Australia’s link with the Crown, it briefly considered that the major unit will be known as the ‘royal’. But public disquiet compelled the Government to adopt the ‘dollar’.\n\nA Guide to Australian 50 Cent Coins\n\n[By far the best information about the 50 cent coin is to be found at the Australian Coin Collecting Weblog and the best source of coins for sale at The Purple Penny.]\n\n1966 Round 50 cent Coin\n\nThe round 50 cent coin was also minted in 2006 for the 2006 RAM proof set and again in 2010 for the very limited 2010 Heritage Set.\n\n2006 Round 50 cent was issued to mark the 40th anniversary of the transition to decimalisation in Australia the Royal Australian Mint has revisited the original 50c in shape and composition.\n\n2010 Round 50 cent is the rarest circulation composition Australian 50c available to collectors. Struck in the same 80% silver/20% copper alloy as the original and iconic 1966 Round 50c this proof quality coin has a tiny mintage of just 400 pieces. It was part of the 1966 Decimal Heritage Set that was released by the RAM in 2010.\n\nThis is the second time that the round 50c has been struck since 1966, with another proof striking available to collectors in the 2006 Australian proof sets. But the 2006 coin has a much larger mintage of 45,373. Like the 2006 coin, this scarce 2010 issue shows the modern Ian Rank-Broadley portrait of HM Queen Elizabeth II rather than the Arnold Machin portrait of 1966. The reverse design, an interpretation of the Australian Coat of Arms on a sea of Mitchell grass is the same as that used on the 1966 coin which was designed by Stuart Devlin. Currently the only way for a collector to get one of these coins is if they either own one of the 1966 Decimal Heritage Sets or if someone breaks up one of the sets and puts the coins up for sale individually.\n\nOne of Europe’s oldest currencies, the ruble has been in use since the 13th century. First made of silver, the currency derives its namesake from the Russian word ‘rubit’ which means to chop or hack, and originally was made from fragmented pieces of the Ukrainian hryvnia. The ruble has been chopped, hacked, collapsed, and re‐denominated many times throughout its 800 year history. The most volatile years came along with regime change and revolution.\n\nIn the 13th century, the Mongol Golden Horde took over Russia, beginning a period which has a tremendous influence on modern Russia and its culture. The sporadic invasion came as surprise to the powerful Rus’ state. One historian living at the time considered the invasion to be God’s punishment: “For our sins unknown nations arrived. No one knew their origin or whence they came, or what religion they practiced. That is known only to God, and perhaps to wise men learned in books”. During the time of the Mongol occupation, regular Mongol coins and imitations thereof were used in most of Russia. Finally, Ivan’s son, Ivan Grozny completed the process by creating the Tsardom of Russia. During this time, wire money was used. Wire money was made of a silver wire that was pressed flat and struck with a massive die. The wire was then cut into equal-weighted pieces which became coins.\n\nThe ruble was the Russian equivalent of the mark, a measurement of weight for silver and gold used in medieval Western Europe. The weight of one ruble was equal to the weight of one grivna. The first kopek coins, minted at Novgorod and Pskov about 1534 show a horseman with a spear, and doubtless the intention was to represent Ivan the Terrible, who was Grand Prince until 1547, and Tsar thereafter. Subsequent minting of the coin, starting in the 18th century, have instead Saint George striking down a serpent.\n\nSince the monetary reform of 1534, one Russian accounting ruble became equivalent to 100 silver Novgorod coins or smaller 200 Muscovite denga coins. The coin with a rider on it soon became colloquially known as kopek. Ruble coins as such did not exist till Peter the Great, when in 1704 he reformed the old monetary system and ordered mintage of a 28-gramme silver ruble coin equivalent to 100 new copper kopek coins.\n\nIvan IV, “the Terrible” (1533-1584)\n\nIvan IV, popularly known as “Ivan the Terrible,” a strong and formidable ruler. The epithet “Terrible” is in fact a mistranslation from the Russian-language word “Groznyi” which in reality means “stern,” “formidable,” “feared by enemies.” Ivan’s long reign was marked by violent internal conflict and a series of wars against many foreign foes sparked by his desire to expand Muscovy’s frontiers, especially along and beyond the Volga river and to the Baltic seacoast in the west.\n\nIn 1534 a unified Russian monetary system made its first appearance, facilitated by the formation of a strong Russian state centered in Moscow. The currency reform was instituted by Elena Glinskaya, mother of Ivan IV. From the 14th century the minting technique of the silver coinage was metal was rolled into wire and sliced into equal sections of the proper weight. Little plates of slightly oval shape resulted. Relatively standard weight of the coins was achieved. The coins were struck by being placed between dies at which point the operator would hammer the upper die against the lower die. In 1704 the first Russian rubles were coined in Moscow. One hundred kopecks made a ruble.\n\nPeter I, “the Great” (1689-1725)\n\nPeter I, “the Great,” is a legendary figure in Russian and world history. Exuberant, bold, often reckless, Peter also pursued a policy of aggressive expansionism. He fought wars with Persians, the Ottoman Empire, and with Sweden. In these wars, he took over the Baltic states and the swamps that became St. Petersburg, a city which he named after himself. He also modernized Russia’s coinage. Peter the Great introduced the Rouble of 100 Kopeks [the first decimal currency], and his coins were some of the first milled coins in the world.\n\nHe made St. Petersburg the capital of the Russian empire in 1721 during the successful Northern War against the Swedes. Among his many accomplishments, Peter irreversibly set into motion a process of intensive Westernization and modernization of Russia and established the Russian Empire as an important player in European and international politics. By the end of the 17th century Peter decided to initiate monetary reform by including the Ukrainian Hetmanate and the newly conquered Baltic provinces in the Russian monetary system. The monetary reform also simultaneously helped to finance the rearmament of the army, the creation of a navy, the building of canals and harbors, and the many large purchases made abroad to help achieve these goals.\n\nThe copper kopeck and the silver ruble [worth 100 kopecks] were taken as a basis of the new monetary system. In 1654 Alexei Mikhailovich, the father of Peter I, already attempted to replace the silver kopeck with a copper kopeck, but this had led to the so-called “copper revolt” in 1662. As a result, Peter prudently kept the silver kopeck in circulation next to the new copper kopeck for almost 20 years to let his subjects get used to the idea of copper money. The first silver ruble coin appeared in 1704.\n\nIn 1700 the first round coins were struck by machinery. Initially all the money production took place in Moscow in multiple mints. In 1724 the St. Petersburg mint started producing the new coins, the so-called “sun” rubles.\n\nPeter II (1727-1730)\n\nThe thirteen year old Czar moved the capital back to Moscow in 1728. The St. Petersburg mint ceased production of coins until 1738 when Empress Anna restored St. Petersburg as the capital. Peter II declared himself of age, but took no part in affairs of the State, devoting himself exclusively to hunting.\n\nIvan VI (1740-1741)\n\nThe niece of the Empress Anna, Elizabeth [daughter of Peter I] seized power from Ivan, the two month-old son of Prince Anton Urlich of Brunswick and Anna Leopoldovna. Ivan IV lived on for some 23 years as a prisoner of the state until an unsuccessful rescue\n\nattempt caused his jailers to kill him. A 1741 government decree directed the public to turn in the coins of Ivan VI within a year for an exchange of new coins at full value. The “ukaz” stipulated that anyone holding any coins of Ivan VI after June 1745 would be subject to punishment. Despite the decree, historians estimate that coins with the value of about 24,000 rubles were hoarded by the people and never turned in for exchange.\n\nPeter III (1761-1762)\n\nElizabeth chose Carl Peter Ulrich, the son of her late sister Anna Petrovna, as her successor. Peter III’s first act upon accession was to make a humiliating peace with Frederick the Great of Prussia.\n\nPeter III’s wife Catherine, with the help of the Orlov brothers [one of whom was Catherine’s paramour] and with the support of the Russian nobility, dethroned him. Soon afterwards the Orlovs murdered Peter III. During Peter’s short six-month reign, Count Peter Shuvalov’s scheme of raising money for the government, by reducing by half the metal content of the existing copper coinage, was quickly implemented. 150 million copper coins were over-struck [putting a new image with new denominations over the old coinage], doubling their value.\n\nCatherine II (1762-1796)\n\nCzar Peter III was forced to hand over the throne to Catherine, a German princess from the small principality of Anhalt-Zerbst. Her victorious wars against the Turks brought the Crimea and the Black Sea coast to Russia. She was the first to consult the population, at least in part, in the legislative commission of 1767. Catherine reorganized Russian local government and issued a charter of rights to the nobility. During her reign Enlightenment thought and culture reached their apogee in Russia, a process she personally encouraged. Her participation in the partitions of Poland brought most of the Ukraine, Belarus, and Lithuania into the Russian empire, ensuring Russia’s role as a major power. During Catherine’s reign, Siberia’s and the Urals’ copper mining industries were at their height. She decided to make coins out of copper rather than silver [because there was so much extra copper] which resulted in some pretty large coins, culminating in the massive the Rouble of Sestroretsk made out of 1 kg of copper!\n\nCatherine had inherited Shuvalov’s plan to double the face value of the existing copper coinage and to reduce the fineness of the silver coinage. She firmly rejected the devaluation of the copper coinage and had Peter III’s already overstruck coppers overstruck again to restore them to their original value.\n\nIn 1768 the Assignation Bank opened in St. Petersburg and in Moscow . Several bank branches were established in other towns, called government towns. The emergence of Assignation rubles was due to large government spending on military needs, leading to a shortage of silver in the treasury, as all the calculations, especially in foreign trade, were conducted exclusively in silver and gold coins. The lack of silver, and huge masses of copper coins in the Russian domestic market meant that large payments were extremely difficult to implement consequently the introduction of bills for large transactions. The initial capital of the Assignation Bank was 1 million rubles copper coins – 500 thousand rubles each in St. Petersburg and in the Moscow offices; thus the total emission of banknotes was also limited to one million rubles.\n\nhttp://www.library.yale.edu/slavic/coins/catherine2.html\n\nAlexander I (1801-1825)\n\nAlexander led the successful coalition war against Napoleon, following the French invasion of Russia in 1812. He was the most enigmatic of Russia’s rulers. His charm and affability allowed him more easily to pursue often contradictory policies. His reforms, especially before 1811, strengthened legal order and the state while preserving autocracy. Yet he granted constitutions to Poland and Finland, and freed the serfs in the Baltic provinces. In his later years he turned toward mysticism and grew increasingly conservative.\n\nAlexander I took a still more self-effacing stance than his father, Paul I, in coin design. He did away with Paul’s cruciform Imperial cipher theme and the religious device – “Not unto Us, Not unto Us, but in Thy name” – and opted for the Romanov double eagle and the rather bland inscription, “Russian Government Ruble Coin,” on the reverse side.\n\nNicholas I (1825-1855)\n\nIn 1822 Constantine, the second oldest brother of the childless Czar Alexander I, renounced his right to the Russian throne, and Alexander I designated his next oldest brother, Nikolai Pavlovich, as Czar. In December of 1825, hearing the news of Alexander’s death, the two brothers, Nicholas and Constantine, each independently swore allegiance to the other as the new Czar. In the prevailing confusion, partisans of a more liberal regime [the Decembrists], launched a poorly coordinated rebellion in favor of Constantine, who they thought would be more progressive. Nicholas was promptly installed as Czar and quickly suppressed the rebellion.\n\nThe thirty-year series of rubles and the eight-year series of 1 ½ ruble pieces of Nicholas I offer many interesting features. The regular coinage, which appears at first glance to be rather monotonous, reflects several new technological developments. The bilingual 1 ½ ruble/10 zloty coin (in Russian and Polish) is a numismatic reflection of Russia’s effort over the years to move towards a practical and more realistic consideration in Russo-Polish monetary and economic affairs. On the other hand, Nicholas I, a man of principle opposed to anything showy in his empire’s currency, paradoxically found himself sponsoring more commemorative coins than any previous Russian sovereign, achieving a record matched only be the last Czar, Nicholas II.\n\nAlexander II (1855-1881)\n\nAlexander II came to the throne better prepared than any other 19th century Russian emperor. He was a balanced, dutiful, hard-working man of essential goodwill. In 1861 he abolished the servitude of the Russian peasants in a decree that, although not wholly satisfying to either the nobles or the peasants, was probably the most statesmanlike possible at the time. Although at the beginning the peasants faced many difficulties in the new economic situation, within forty years they owned about 50% of Russian arable land – a better record than that of most countries that had instituted similar land reforms.\n\nThe Grand Duchy of Finland [the predecessor state of modern Finland] existed between 1809 and 1917 as an autonomous part of the Russian Empire and was ruled by the Russian Emperor as Grand Duke. Alexander II was the Emperor of Russia from 1855 until his assassination in 1881. He was also the King of Poland and the Grand Duke of Finland. In foreign policy, Alexander sold Alaska to the United States in 1867. Among his greatest domestic challenges was an uprising in Poland in 1863, to which he responded by stripping that land of its separate Constitution and incorporating it directly into Russia.\n\nThe decades of the 1860’s and 1870’s saw half a dozen foreign and private Russian efforts to take over part of the empire’s coinage system, with French, German and Belgian offers to produce nickel subsidiary coins. The Paris Mint struck a substantial quantity of subsidiary Russian coins in 1861, using hubs from St. Petersburg. Copper coinage was reorganized in 1867, and in 1876 the Ekaterinburg mint, which had been in operation for 150 years, was closed down. The St. Petersburg Mint took up the slack and expanded its production correspondingly. Saint Petersburg Mint remains one of the world’s largest mints founded in 1724 within the walls of Peter and Paul Fortress, it is one of the oldest industrial enterprises in Saint Petersburg now part of the Goznak State-owned corporation.\n\nAlexander III (1881-1894)\n\nThe assassination of his father, Alexander II, in 1881 confirmed Alexander III in his conviction of the merit of firm, uncompromising leadership, the need to suppress sedition and to check any tendencies which might prejudice the Czar’s position. He was unsympathetic to and largely uncomprehending of the intellectual and social ferment among his subjects.\n\nDuring the first five years of his reign Alexander III retained the regular ruble type which had not changed since 1860. For the coronation ceremonies in 1883 it was decided to issue a special coronation ruble which would take the place of the traditional lesser coronation medals. In 1885 the Mint’s operating structure as well as the entire Russian monetary system was extensively revised. A new portrait type for gold and large silver coins was introduced.\n\nNicholas II (1894-1917)\n\nNicholas II probably would have been a relatively good ruler in more auspicious and tranquil times. The Empire moved to the gold standard in 1897, with no major changes in silver coinage. The heavy burden on the St. Petersburg Mint of striking a vast quantity of the new gold coins led to the decision to farm out to the Paris and Brussels Mints the minting part of the banks silver coinage from 1896 to 1899. The Russians provided the French and the Belgians with hubs or dies for the coinage they produced, so that one can distinguish the foreign-minted coinage by looking at the edge of the coin: a single star for Paris and two stars for Brussels. The last rubles of the Imperial era were struck by Nicholas II in 1915 and subsidiary coinage continued until 1917.\n\nNicholas II was the last Emperor of Russia, Grand Duke of Finland, and titular King of Poland. His reign saw Imperial Russia go from being one of the foremost great powers of the world to economic and military collapse. Under his rule, Russia was decisively defeated in the Russo-Japanese War. The Anglo-Russian Entente, designed to counter German attempts to gain influence in the Middle East, ended the Great Game between Russia and the United Kingdom. As head of state, Nicholas approved the Russian mobilization of August 1914, which marked the beginning of Russia’s involvement in the First World War, a war in which 3.3 million Russians were killed. Nicholas II abdicated following the February Revolution of 1917 during which he and his family were imprisoned and executed in 1918.\n\nCopied from https://en.numista.com/forum/topic44228.html\n\nNicholas II opposed all democratic reforms and wished for the Russian government to remain an absolute monarchy. He also pursued extremely anti-Semitic legislation (which led to the foundation of the Jewish Labor Bund), as well as anti-labor laws. His subjects, however, had different ideas. This led to the famous Revolution of 1905, which was really a wave of revolutions across Russia, each targeting a specific problem. Tsar Nicholas II responded with violence, but this didn’t stop the revolts.\n\nFinally, he was forced to enact massive reforms, one of which included creating the democratically-elected Imperatorski Duma. He also granted the freedom of speech and assembly. He also fought two wars, the Russo-Japanese War (which he lost) and WWI (which he one but at a heavy cost to the nation). In addition, the Russian government began to print millions of roubles in banknotes without minting coins to back them up with, which caused inflation and a food shortage. All these events set the stage for the Russian Revolution.\n\nThe Russian Revolution was in fact a series of related primarily Socialist rebellions and wars. The first of these, the February Revolution, broke out in the streets of Petrograd . The February Revolution deposed the Tsar and created the Russian Provisional Government, which was partially democratic, as well as the Petrograd Soviet, an influential legislative body. The Russian Provisional Government eventually ordered the execution of the Tsar and his entire family. Unfortunately for the Soviet, the Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, took down the Provisional Government in the October Revolution. Lenin and his followers established the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR). The RSFSR was the world’s first socialist state, which completely overhauled the government and the economy to comply with socialist models. The RSFSR also produced coins in 1921, the first since the fall of the Tsarist government.\n\nFinally, the Soviet Union was established as a union of the formerly independent RSFSR, Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic, the Byelorussian Socialist Soviet Republic, and the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic [a federation of Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia]. RSFSR coinage continued for a few years and then the Soviet Union issued distinctive coins, including a pictorial 50 Kopeks and 1 Rouble.\n\nA medal showing both sides, struck by Catherine the Great in 1780. The first piece depicts the Empress and the second piece has the inscription in Latin, “Mare Liberum” – which means “Free Seas”. This refers to Catherine’s Declaration of Armed Neutrality of February 28, 1780, the goal of which was to preserve the struggling but ever-increasing Russian commerce on the high seas from the depredations of the warring British, Spanish, French and American navies during the American Revolutionary War.\n\nhttp://www.library.yale.edu/slavic/coins/papercurrency.html\n\nThe Soviet Union.\n\nAfter the 1917 Bolshevik revolution, the ruble lost one third of its value, and in the following years while the country was gripped by civil war, the ruble dropped from 31 against the dollar to nearly 1,400. The ruble hit its historic low of 2.4 million per USD after the civil war and the year the revolution’s leader Vladimir Lenin died. It was re‐denominated to 2.22. Throughout the Soviet Union, the ruble was little used outside state borders, so the government kept the official rate close to the dollar, a massive overvaluation. In the last years of the Soviet Union, the economic crisis caused panic among the population who were ‘stuck’ with their increasingly worthless rubles. A black market naturally developed, and while the official rate for the ruble was 0.56 per dollar, a single greenback actually sold for 30‐33 rubles on the street.\n\nThe Soviet currency had its own name in all Soviet languages, sometimes quite different from its Russian designation. All banknotes had the currency name and their nominal printed in the languages of every Soviet Republic. This naming is preserved in modern Russia; e.g.: Tatar for ruble and kopek are sum and tien. The current names of several currencies of Central Asia are simply the local names of the ruble. Finnish last appeared on 1947 banknotes since the Finnish SSR was dissolved in 1956.\n\nThe first coinage after the Russian civil war was minted in 1921-1923 with silver coins in denominations of 10, 15, 20 and 50 kopecks and 1 ruble. Gold chervonets were issued in 1923. These coins bore the emblem and legends of the RSFSR [Russian Federated Soviet Socialist Republic] and depicted the famous slogan, “Workers of the world, Unite!”. The 10, 15, and 20 kopecks were minted with a purity of 50% silver while the ruble and half ruble were minted with a purity of 90% silver. The chervonetz was 90% gold. These coins would continue to circulate after the RSFSR was consolidated into the USSR with other soviet republics until the discontinuation of silver coinage in 1931. After Joseph Stalin’s consolidation of power following the death of Lenin, he launched a third redenomination in 1924 by introducing the “gold” ruble at a value of 50,000 rubles of the previous issue. This reform also saw the ruble linked to the chervonets, at a value of 10 rubles and put an end to chronic inflation. Coins began to be issued again in 1924, while paper money was issued in rubles for values below 10 rubles and in chervonets for higher denominations.\n\nIn August 1941, the wartime emergency prompted the minting facilities to be evacuated from Moscow and relocated to Permskaya Oblast as German forces continued to advance Eastward. It only became possible to resume coin production in the autumn of 1942, for one year the country was using coins made before the war. Furthermore, the coins were made of what had suddenly become precious metals – copper and nickel, which were needed for the defense industry. This meant many coins were being produced in only limited quantities, with some denominations being skipped altogether until the crisis finally abated in late 1944. These disruptions led to severe coin shortages in many regions. Limits were put in place on how much change could be carried in coins with limits of 3 rubles for individuals and 10 rubles for vendors to prevent hoarding as coins became increasingly high in demand. Only high inflation and wartime rationing helped ease pressure significantly. In some instances, postage stamps and coupons were being used in the place of small denomination coins. It was not until 1947 that there were finally enough coins in circulation to meet economic demand and the restrictions could be eased.\n\nCommemorative coins of the Soviet Union: [images]\n\nIn 1965, the first circulation commemorative ruble coin was released celebrating the 20th anniversary of the Soviet Union’s victory over Germany, during this year the first uncirculated mint coin sets were also released and restrictions on coin collecting were eased. In 1967, a commemorative series of 10, 15, 20, 50 kopecks, and 1 ruble coins was released, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Russian Revolution and depicted Lenin .\n\nStarting in 1991 with the final year of the 1961 coin series, both kopeck and ruble coins began depicting the mint marks (M) for Moscow, and (Л) for Leningrad. In late 1991, a new coinage was introduced in brass-plated steel, and cupro-nickel The 10 rubles was bimetallic with an aluminium-bronze centre and a cupro-nickel-zinc ring. The series depicts an image of the Kremlin on the obverse rather than the soviet state emblem. However, this coin series was extremely short lived as the Soviet Union ceased to exist only months after its release. It did however, continue to be used in several former soviet republics including Russia and particularly Tajikistan for a short time after the union had ceased to exist out of necessity.\n\nFrom Soviet to Shock Therapy\n\nDuring the Khrushchev and Brezhnev eras, the USSR and USA fought proxy wars, namely the Korean, Vietnam, and Soviet-Afghanistan wars. Although they left a big impact on history, they had no impact on Soviet coinage. The Soviet Union also maintained control over its Eastern European puppet states.\n\nIn 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev was selected as leader of the Soviet Union. He engaged in talks with America, established more political [Peristroika] and personal [Glasnost – the reduction of censorship] freedoms, and slowly began the process of dismantling the socialist economy. Between 1989 and 1991, the Soviet Union began the process of collapse. Each of the 15 republics declared Independence, and finally, the RSFSR did so as well under the leadership of Boris Yeltsin. The Soviet Union came to an end in 1991. Gosbank, the State Bank of the USSR issued a set of coins in 1991, and the independent Russian Federation issued its own coins starting in 1991. Eventually, all the former Soviet republics issued coins.\n\nThe ruble collapsed along with the Soviet state, and different currencies were set up in the 15 different republics. The Central Bank of Russia replaced the State Bank of the USSR [Gosbank] on January 1, 1992 and the Russian ruble replaced the Soviet ruble.\n\nThe break-up of the Soviet Union was not accompanied by any formal changes in monetary arrangements. The Central Bank of Russia continued to ship USSR ruble notes and coins to the central banks of the fourteen newly independent countries, which had formerly been the main branches of Gosbank in the republics. During the first half of 1992, a monetary union with 15 independent states all using the ruble existed. Since it was clear that the situation would not last, each of them was using its position as “free-riders” to issue huge amounts of money in the form of credit [since Russia held the monopoly on printing banknotes and coins]. The Russian central bank responded in July 1992 by setting up restrictions to the flow of credit between Russia and other states. The final collapse of the ruble zone began with the exchange of banknotes by the Central bank of Russia on Russian territory at the end of July 1993. As a result, other countries still in the ruble zone were “pushed out”. By November 1993 all newly independent states had introduced their own currencies, with the exception of war-torn Tajikistan (May 1995) and unrecognized Transnistria (1994).\n\nThe new Russian Central Bank set the official exchange rate at 125 rubles to the US dollar. By December 1992, the ruble had already lost about two third’s of its value. Russia’s post‐Soviet economy was dominated by ‘shock therapy’, and as President Boris Yeltsin’s reforms spurred rapid inflation, millions of Russians lost their savings. Boris Yelstin’s political infighting with the Communists in 1993 caused the ruble to slide more, down to 1,247 per 1 USD. Yeltsin won the political coup, and a constitution was signed on December 12, 1993. Shortly after the political victory, in January 1994, the authorities banned the use of the US dollar and other foreign currencies in circulation in an attempt to stymie the ruble’s decline.\n\nBlack Tuesday and Black Thursday\n\nOn October 11, 1994, an event known as ‘Black Tuesday’ hit the Russian financial market, and the ruble collapsed 27 percent in one day, which on top of a decline in GDP and massive inflation, catapulted Russia into an economic recession. By the end of 1995, chronic inflation had reached 200 percent. In 1996 the currency closed at 5,560 rubles per US dollar. 1997 was the first year of relative stability, but the ruble still fell to 5960 rubles per dollar. An era of stability prompted the government to devalue the currency and slash 3 decimal places, and on January 1, 1998, the ruble was set to 5.96 against the US dollar.\n\nOn August 17, 1998, Russia announced a technical default on its $40 billion in domestic debt and ceased to support the ruble on the same day. At the time, the bank only had $24 billion in reserves. The stock market and ruble both lost more than 70 percent, and nearly a third of the country’s population fell below the poverty line. Along with the default came another mass devaluation of the ruble. In six months it fell from 6 to the dollar to 21 to the dollar.\n\nOn May 27, 1998, the Central Bank increased the main lending rate to 150 percent, which brought loans to a near halt. By the end of 1998, inflation was 84 percent and the Russia GDP lost 4.9 percent. Both currency crises in the 90s forced the governors of the Central Bank to resign. The 1998 ruble crisis, like today, was driven by falling oil prices, which went as low as $18 in August 1998. However, today’s crisis is much less of a risk, as Russia has more than 10x the amount of currency reserves as it did in 1998.\n\nThe ruble met the new millennium with a rate of 28 to the dollar, and after hitting a low of 31 in 2003, started to slowly strengthen. In 2008, Russia along with the much of the rest of the world fell into recession, losing 7.8 percent of GDP in 2009. The Russian economy fared the crisis rather well, and the economy was back on track with 4.5 percent growth in 2010.\n\nRussia is facing its biggest currency crisis since 1998. The ruble has mostly been tumbling in tandem with weak oil prices, which have nearly halved since June, when Brent crude sold for $115 a barrel. In January, prices plummeted below $50 a barrel. The ruble has lost more than half its value and investors worry that the devaluation, along with falling oil and political tensions, would send Russia into recession again. The Central Bank forecast a 4.7 percent decline in GDP if oil prices stay at $60 per barrel. On December 15 the ruble plunged 11 percent, and the Central Bank increased the key lending interest rate to 17 percent, in the middle of the night. Russia’s biggest oil producers, including Gazprom and Rosneft, have been ordered to sell a fraction of their foreign exchange revenues over the next couple of months in order to support the ruble, adding an estimated $1 billion to the daily market.\n\nGermany’s roots can be traced to the 843 Treaty"
