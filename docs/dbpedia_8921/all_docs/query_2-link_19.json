        "text": "A new rearing horse!\n\nI caught some sort of bug for these old German State coins with the rearing Saxon Steed. I just got this one today, and I have another nice 1818 3 Mariengroschen on the way.\n\nThis coin was minted in 1700 when the Electorate of Brunswick-L端neberg was overseen by Georg Ludwig, more commonly known today as King George I of Great Britain and Ireland. George I was born on 28 May 1660 and died on 11 June 1727. He was King of Great Britain and Ireland from 1 August 1714 until his death, and ruler of the Duchy and Electorate of Brunswick-L端neburg (Hanover) in the Holy Roman Empire from 1698 to his death.\n\nGeorge was born in Hanover, in what is now Germany, and inherited the titles and lands of the Duchy of Brunswick-L端neburg from his father and uncles. A succession of European wars expanded his German domains during his lifetime, and in 1708 he was ratified as prince-elector of Hanover. At the age of 54, after the death of Queen Anne of Great Britain, George ascended the British throne as the first monarch of the House of Hanover. Although over fifty Roman Catholics bore closer blood relationships to Anne, the Act of Settlement of 1701 prohibited Catholics from inheriting the British throne. George, however, was Anne's closest living Protestant relative. In reaction, Jacobites attempted to depose George and replace him with Anne's Catholic half-brother, James Francis Edward Stuart, but their attempts failed.\n\nDuring George's reign, the powers of the monarchy diminished and Britain began a transition to the modern system of cabinet government led by a prime minister. Towards the end of his reign, actual power was held by Sir Robert Walpole, Britain's first de facto prime minister. George died on a trip to his native Hanover in 1727, where he was buried.\n\nAn interesting historical tid-bit is that this coin was minted in 1700. This was the same year that the territories forming the electorate introduced - like all Protestant territories of imperial immediacy - the Improved Calendar. It was called the \"improved calendar\" by Protestants, in order not to mention the name of Pope Gregory XIII (it is more commonly known as the Gregorian calendar). So Sunday, the 18 February of Old Style was followed by Monday, the 1 March New Style. So, arguably, this coin was issued during the shortest year in the history of this German State, at only 355 days in length.\n\nHappy collecting!"
