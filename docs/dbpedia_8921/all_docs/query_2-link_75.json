        "text": "The Duchy of Brunswick is a gargantuan, efficient nation, ruled by Prince Ernst August of Hanover-Brunswick with an even hand, and remarkable for its restrictive gun laws. The hard-nosed, hard-working population of 24.57 billion Brunswickians are free to succeed or fail in life on their own merits; the successful tend to enjoy an opulent (but moralistic) lifestyle, while the failures can be seen crowding out most jails.\n\nThe medium-sized, moralistic, pro-business government prioritizes Spirituality, with Defense, Education, and Law & Order also on the agenda. It meets to discuss matters of state in the capital city of Braunschweig. Citizens pay a flat income tax of 15.4%.\n\nThe very strong Brunswickian economy, worth a remarkable 1,204 trillion thalers a year, is led by the Gambling industry, with major contributions from Trout Farming, Book Publishing, and Cheese Exports. Average income is 49,007 thalers, but there is a significant disparity between incomes, with the richest 10% of citizens earning 149,706 per year while the poor average 12,434, a ratio of 12.0 to 1.\n\nBrunswick has designated Braunschweig as its capital city, Prince Ernst August of Hanover-Brunswick has just been declared ruler of Brunswick in an international press conference, parents must choose their children's names from a government-mandated master list, and Roman Catholicism has been named as Brunswick's national religion. Crime is moderate, with the police force struggling against a lack of funding and a high mortality rate. Brunswick's national animal is the lion and its national religion is Roman Catholicism."
