        "text": "Bust of bisque porcelain; base of porcelain with gold decoration; embossed mark on the back of the bust: \"W\" under a horse jumping to the left (1771-1794), below \"No. 42\"; on the inside respectively underside of the base mark of the porcelain manufactory Fürstenberg \"F\" in underglaze blue as well as embossed mark underglaze \"10.G\"; furthermore handwritten inscription \"Fürstenb. Nr. 1b\" (old number of the Bomann Museum) as well as two paper stickers with blue frame and handwritten inscription \"411\" (large sticker) and \"249\" (small sticker).\n\nThe bust was purchased in February 1940 together with other Fürstenberg porcelain for 700 RM from the art and antique shop Aloys Menges & Söhne, Königstraße 50B/51 in Hanover. The exact meaning of the two stickers is not yet certain, but they could be an indication that the art shop had previously purchased the bust at an auction of Jewish property."
