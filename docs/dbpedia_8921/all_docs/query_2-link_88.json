        "text": "Congrats on your acquisition @doppeltaler, but I want to offer you fair warning that these are addictive but also expensive. You'll spend your entire coin budget on too few of these multiple talers and still not make a dent on the number of varieties that exist.\n\nAnd just to tease a bit:\n\n(This is equivalent to a 2T)\n\n(This is equivalent to a 2T)\n\n(These are equivalent to a 2T)\n\nThese l√∂ser coins exist from many countries, the cheapest of which are from Austria (under the Habsburgs) and the Duchy of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel. (The ones from Belgium and The Netherlands seem to be the most expensive by region.)\n\nEVillageProwler, first of all thanks for correcting the spelling for l√∂ser. Love your l√∂sers, specially the half pound; amazing. I was once outbid on the 2 scudi , I think it was stacks bowers auction. They are indeed expensive, I won‚Äôt be buying any more 2 talers for a while üò£"
