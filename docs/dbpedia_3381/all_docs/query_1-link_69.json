        "text": "Danica Patrick\n\nDanica Patrick is the world's most popular and accomplished female auto racer. Unlike directly physical sports like tennis, she is able to compete with men on a level playing field and give many of them a run for their money. Patrick is the only woman to ever win an IndyCar Series race and has consistently broken female records for the sport.\n\nThe award-winning driver was NASCAR's most popular driver multiple times and is extremely successful in all areas of her life. Patrick also owns her own brand of wine, called Somnium, and is an avid philanthropist too. You can see Patrick in a beautiful white dress on the red carpet, showing off both her beautiful face and extremely fit physique. She might look gentle, but this woman has a strong bite.\n\nRonda Rousey\n\nRonda Rousey has become one of the most popular women in sports after turning women into flying ragdolls in her cage-fighting career. She’s been featured in various films, modeling gigs, and even video-games, and has literally turned herself into a celebrity. Rousey was the first female American to win an Olympic medal in judo, which helped her make the jump to professional MMA fighting at just 21 years old.\n\nAlthough she’s been known to be quite brash and overconfident at times, Ronda Rousey has every reason to think highly of herself. She recently retired from fighting and moved to the tough world of wrestling on the WWE. This femme fatale remains one of the most formidable women in entertainment and appeared in some very popular films and TV shows recently, including \"The Expendables,\" \"Furious 7\", and \"Entourage.\"\n\nSydney Leroux\n\nSydney Leroux is a talented and aggressive soccer player and Olympic gold medalist. She's currently the forward for the Orlando Pride team in the National Women's Soccer League. Outside of her successful professional career, which includes a total of 57 goals, she also has an extremely popular Instagram channel with more than a million followers. The American-Canadian soccer player is also known as \"Syd, the Kid\" and credits much of her success to her family. Leroux Married Dom Dwyer in 2015, and the two had a child, Cassius Cruz Dwyer, in late 2016.\n\nIt became clear to everyone that Sydney Leroux is obsessed with winning when pictures of Leroux began to surface of her training while being six months pregnant with her second child. She has endorsed many companies throughout her career, including Nike, Nestlé and even made a cameo on a commercial for Dr. Dre's Beats. Leroux has been featured numerous times on ESPN and various other TV shows and magazines. She is a playable character in EA Sports' FIFA video game franchise.\n\nMichelle Waterson\n\nMichelle Waterson is one chick that you do not want to get into a fight with. She has been ranked the number one atom weight UFC fighter in the world between 2013 to 2014 and has a total of 17 wins, with three brutal knockouts. She began her time as an athlete in gymnastics but found herself being attracted to Karate and Muay Thai. Waterson went from being a ring girl to a fighter and made her MMA debut in 2007.\n\nThe successful fighter was 2013 and 2014's fighter of the year for her weight class and received the Most Vulgar Display of Power Award for beating the daylights out of Yasuko Tamada in 2014. Michelle Waterson's fame led her to appear in everything from a Megadeth music video to the popular reality show \"American Ninja Warrior.\" She has also been featured on \"Bully Beatdown,\" a reality series where bullies get a chance to fight against professional MMA fighters for the chance to win $10,000. A documentary was made about Waterson in 2016, called \"Fight Mom.\"\n\nAly Raisman\n\nWhen Americans look back at the most popular and beloved female athletes in history, Aly Raisman will undoubtedly be listed as one of them. This talented and successful gymnast has won six Olympic gold medals in her incredible career. She’s widely recognized as the captain of Team USA’s ‘Fierce Five’ in the 2012 London Olympics and of the ‘Final Five’ in the 2016 Rio Olympic games. Raisman is a serious threat and helped push her team to take gold medals home both times.\n\nDespite being immensely talented and hard-working, Aly Raisman claims that gymnastics is the only sport she’s ever been truly great at. She reportedly told the Life Is Good company that she’s “the most unathletic person besides gymnastics.” Luckily, she’s also one of the most beautiful women in the United States and could easily start a serious modeling career anytime she wants.\n\nBarbara Blank\n\nYou may recall Barbara Blank from the WWE, where she goes by a different name. The popular Kelly Kelly is one of the most beloved and followed female wrestlers in the WWE. She started out in cheerleading and gymnastics but quickly found that her charisma and athletic abilities were much better geared for the popular show sport. After just six years as a pro-wrestler, Blank won the 2011 WWE Diva Championship.\n\nBarbara Blank is currently what you might refer to as a “mini-celebrity” and has retired from the WWE in 2012, shortly after securing her WWE Diva Championship the previous year. She focuses most of her attention on acting at the moment and has appeared in a bunch of popular TV shows. Her most meaningful appearances to date are in the long-running \"Days of Our Lives\" and in E!’s reality show, \"WAGS,\" a show that follows the lives of girlfriends and wives of famous athletes.\n\nAlex Morgan\n\nOne of the fastest and most determined women in sports is Alex Morgan. This beautiful woman may look like your everyday sweet girl, but she’s a dominant and relentless competitor when it comes to her favorite sport, soccer. This young Olympic gold medalist is a forward on the National Women’s Soccer League and the US National Team. She has won many competitions and titles over her career, including the champion of the FIFA Women’s World Cup and the champion of the National Women’s Soccer League.\n\nAlex Morgan is also an accomplished and bestselling writer and a graduate of the famous UC Berkeley. Her soccer statistics are incredible. She’s married to popular soccer player Servando Carrasco, who you may know as one of LA Galaxy’s best players. Morgan can be seen here on the red carpet wearing a beautiful chiffon dress which accentuates her money-making legs.\n\nMikaela Shiffrin\n\nWith almost a million followers on Instagram, you can definitely say that Mikaela Shiffrin has found her way to capitalize on her two Olympic gold medals as a World Cup alpine skier. At just 18 years old, she became the youngest slalom champion in Olympic alpine skiing history and is currently considered one of the best skiers in the world. Shiffrin continues to break many records and is the only athlete in the world, male or female, to win 17 World Cup races during a season.\n\nMikaela Shiffrin’s long list of records and incredible Olympic and World Championship wins make her a force to be reckoned with. As an accomplished and recognized skier, she’s also afforded the opportunity of attending various red carpet events, which she consistently does with both grace and style.\n\nJen Kessy\n\nJennifer Kessy is one of America's former Olympic beach volleyball players. She won a silver medal in the 2012 London Olympics beach competition and scored a gold medal in the 2009 Stavanger World Championships. She silently retired shortly after her 2012 win and did not play in the 2014 season due to being pregnant.\n\nNowadays, Jennifer Kessy mostly coaches other professional volleyball players. She married French beach volleyball player Andy Cés in 2013. The couple now has two children together.\n\nChelsea Pezzola\n\nArguably the hottest woman on the golf course (and the competition is quite massive) is the gorgeous Chelsea Lynn Pezzola. She's a professional golfer, a host and media personality on Fox Sports' show, \"Swing Clinic,\" and a regular golf editor for the popular Jet Set magazine. She was born during the early '90s in Florida and had a strict and dedicated work ethic.\n\nChelsea began golfing at the age of five after her stepdad introduced her to the game. A few years later, she found herself playing in the LPGA and working to help promote women's golf everywhere. Despite her moderately successful golfing career, it seems that her biggest developments can be seen through her Instagram account, which includes various pictures of her incredible life.\n\nAlana Blanchard\n\nWith almost 2 million Instagram followers, Alana Blanchard has turned her passion for surfing into the ultimate launchpad for a modeling career. She uses her time on the beach to work on her surfing skills, take half nude selfies, and promote her swimwear line that's specifically tailored for surfing. She's a great friend to Bethany Hamilton, who was involved in a terrifying shark attack back in 2003 that left her without an arm.\n\nAlana Blanchard is currently engaged to Jack Freestone, a fellow Australian pro surfer, and in 2017, the two welcomed their first child, Banks Harvey, who often appears on her Instagram channel. You can watch Alana being portrayed by actress Lorraine Nicholson in the 2011 biographical drama film \"Soul Surfer.\"\n\nAli Krieger\n\nAli Krieger is a talented and successful National Women's Soccer League player. She plays for Orlando Pride, a Florida-based women's soccer team. The player is an avid philanthropist and supports a charity called MiracleFeet, which helps kids with clubfoot, a birth defect that causes one or both feet to be rotated inward or outwards, to get the treatment they need. She worked with Nike in 2007 and has been a great advertiser for them.\n\nAli Krieger's last name actually means \"warrior\" in German, which might be a clue on why you shouldn't mess with her. Her brother, Kyle Krieger, is a very popular social media influencer, with over 200 thousand YouTube subscribers and more than 2 million Instagram followers. It seems that red is truly the perfect color for this dedicated warrior.\n\nMiesha Tate\n\nAnyone who follows mixed martial arts can remember the dominant Miesha Tate, who had 18 wins during her MMA career. Nowadays, she mostly works as an MMA pundit while also cultivating and growing her Instagram channel of over 2 million followers. Tate became widely known in 2011 when she won the Strikeforce Women's Bantamweight Championship.\n\nOutside of MMA, Miesha Tate has been quite a lifesaver on more than one occasion. She once saved an older woman who was going through an asthma attack while scuba diving. On another occasion, Tate helped carry a six-year-old girl with a broken arm to safety while hiking in Nevada.\n\nKym Johnson\n\nKym Johnson is known for being a professional Australian ballroom dancer and for appearing in the first three seasons of Australia's version of \"Dancing with the Stars.\" She's the wife of Robert Herjavec, the successful Canadian businessman who has a net worth of over $200 million. The two live together in Bridle Path, an upscale residential neighborhood with multi-million dollar mansions in Toronto, Canada.\n\nWhen Kim isn't dancing with the world's most successful and famous men on \"Dancing with the Stars,\" she spends her life taking care of her twins, Hudson Robert Herjavec and Haven Mae Herjavec. She released a full-length, cardio-dancing-based fitness program called \"5678 Fitness\" and a book called \"The 5678 Diet\" in early 2016.\n\nAlica Schmidt\n\nIt’s clear to everyone that Alica Schmidt was naturally built for running. Her long legs and springy physique make her a perfect fit for the sport. This German middle-distance runner is one of the best 800 meters runners in the world. This talented athlete was originally born in Worms, Germany, and considered studying journalism.\n\nAlica Schmidt is considered one of the sexiest female runners in the world. It seems that Schmidt is keenly aware of that, as evident by the fact that she posts multiple times per week on her Instagram account. Her numerous followers enjoy various pictures of her, from modeling photos to inspirational running stills. Some critics say that she’s putting too much focus on social media and not enough on running, which is evident by the observation that Schmidt hasn’t broken her running record in a while.\n\nMcKayla Maroney\n\nRetired women's artistic gymnastics champion, McKayla Maroney, used to watch \"Tarzan\" and hoped she could be as athletic as him one day. Her mother quickly put her in gymnastics when she was just two years old, which helped secure her future as an Olympic gymnast. She won a gold Olympic medal in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, making Americans all across the nation very proud.\n\nThe beautiful gymnast has also become a meme in recent years, thanks to pictures of her iconic \"not impressed\" expression. These photos were taken after Maroney failed to secure a gold medal in the gymnastics Olympic vault competition. She ended up winning a silver medal, which prompted her disappointed expression. Now that she’s retired, Maroney has tried her hand at acting and has indicated that she’d like to pursue a singing career as well.\n\nAnastasia Yankova\n\nIn case you haven’t heard of the Russian femme fatale, Anastasia Yankova, this beautiful flyweight mixed martial artist, is considered one of the best female fighters in the world. Yankova claims that her initial inspiration was from the popular TV show \"Xena: Warrior Princess.\" She’s both gorgeous and dangerous and could easily pass as a Bond girl, or perhaps even as an MI6 agent herself. She’s a Kyokushin Karate expert and started out at the young age of six.\n\nAfter mastering Kyokushin Karate, Anastasia Yankova also adapted formal Muay Tahi training into her repertoire of dangerous skills. Despite looking like a beautiful model, she routinely bashes skulls and impresses the judges at MMA competitions. Her beautiful looks, small figure, and killer instincts make her one lady you don’t want to mess with.\n\nSerena Williams\n\nSerena Williams is the most talked-about female athlete in the world right now. She's one of the best female tennis players of all time and has amassed a whopping 23 major singles title win, more than any man or woman in the Open Era. Williams has broken many, many records throughout her career and made over $90 million as a tennis player, making her one of the highest-earning female athletes of all time.\n\nSerena Williams has been mired in various controversies in her career. She claims that most of them were due to her race and gender. Williams has also been the focus of many dramas and public debates due to her extremely vocal nature and critical view of the women’s tennis association. Luckily, we can easily forget that just by looking at her beauty. At 5 foot 9, Williams could have easily been one of the world’s most successful models.\n\nCaroline Wozniacki\n\nLegendary female Danish tennis player, Caroline Wozniacki, is considered one of the best in the world at her sport. She retired in late 2019 after winning many titles and being ranked number-one in 2010. Wozniacki has earned over $34 million through her Tennis winnings and has beaten many records, as well as glass ceilings.\n\nWozniacki comes from a background of professional sports, with her father being her primary coach since the age of fourteen. By age twenty-one, the accomplished tennis player was already the second-highest-earning female athlete in the world. You can see Wozniacki posing on the red carpet and showing the world just how to fit she is. The legs and arms are super built and lend to her already beautiful face and dress.\n\nCandace Parker\n\nAt six foot three inches tall, Candace Parker might have a tough time picking her romantic partner outside of professional basketball stars. Luckily for her, she happens to be one as well and competes in the WNBA for the successful Los Angeles Sparks. She’s an extremely dominant player and is widely considered as one of the United States’ best female ballplayers of all time. Her list of accomplishments is very long, and so is her figure.\n\nCandace Parker is best known for being the first woman to dunk in a tournament game for the NCAA. After a successful period playing at the University of Tennessee, she went on to win two Olympic gold medals and two MVP awards in the WNBA. You might recall her brother, Anthony Parker, who’s also a successful basketball player in his own right.\n\nKelly Clark\n\nKelly Clark is one of America's most popular snowboarders. She won a gold medal in the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics for Halfpipe and proceeded to win Bronze in 2010 and 2014. She's a devoted Christian, often riding a snowboard with a sticker that says, \"Jesus, I cannot hide my love.\" In 2015, Clark was awarded the Best Female Action Sports Athlete ESPY Award after winning Gold in 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 Winter X Games Superpipe competitions.\n\nKelly Clark announced her retirement from snowboarding in early 2019 but continues to be widely known for her legendary status in videos and articles, such as Burton's fantastic \"Rise: 20 Years of Kelly Clark\". She is very happy with her career choice and looks back at it fondly: “After 20 years, nearly 200 events, 137 podiums, 78 wins, and more pipe laps than I can count, I feel that at last, I’ve found my own personal ceiling, and it’s time to let others stand on it.”\n\nApril Ross\n\nApril Ross, also known as “The Boss,” is arguably the most popular female pro-volleyball player in the world. She's an Olympic medalist, loves reading books, and is a successful blogger and speaker. She won a silver medal in the 2012 London Olympic Games and a bronze medal in the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics. Ross has been married to Brad Keenan, a fellow beach volleyball player, since 2010. She has received various awards over the years, including the AVP Best Offensive Play and Most Valuable Player from 2013 to 2017 consecutively.\n\nShe can be seen here at the premiere of the Adam Sandler film \"Uncut Gems,\" sporting a comfortable ensemble. She's an avid supporter of Women's rights and hopes to inspire many more women in various fields to pursue their dreams. She believes parents should refrain from pushing their children into their own sports and instead let them find their own journey.\n\nAllyson Felix\n\nAllyson Felix is one of the world's most decorated American track and field sprinters. She's a three-time World champion and has won several Olympic medals. Felix is the only female to win six Olympic gold medals. Her career is full of record-breaking runs, as she could outpace just about anyone in the world at 100, 200, and 400 meter runs. Felix uses her fame to help promote various humanitarian causes. She's highly celebrated in the media and is a five-time recipient of the Jesse Owens Award.\n\nAllyson Felix can be seen above in a yellow, to-piece suit and a beautiful smile as she attends the 2019 ESPY Awards. She became a mother in recent years but doesn't let her motherhood stop her from continuing to break records. The athlete dropped her Nike deal after contending their pregnancy leave policies and signed instead with Athleta.\n\nHope Solo\n\nAs one of the world’s most successful soccer players, Hope Solo has both the passion and the responsibility of inspiring millions of young girls all across the world. She has been a talented forward player since high school and has built her career as the US women’s soccer team’s goalkeeper. Many consider Solo to be one of the world’s best goalkeepers, and her stats definitely back up that claim.\n\nHope is almost always seen smiling and positive on the field. She's been featured in the popular reality show \"Dancing with the Stars\" and modeled for many magazines, including ESPN.

Norendal is engaged to professional ice hockey defenseman Alexander Bonsaksen.\n\nSilje Norendal has a very active Instagram account with loads of followers and tends to upload more modest pictures since most of her training is done in the snow. You can clearly see her Norwegian beauty showing through this photo.\n\nThe Bella Twins\n\nNever mess with the Bella twins. These beautiful femme Fatales, named Brie Bella and Nikki Bella, are identical sisters who starred in the WWE from 2007 to 2019. The two are now retired but were once ranked number one in Pro Wrestling Illustrated's Female 50.
