        "text": "My goal is to inspire those around me. I believe that I can be a great example to younger athletes who do not think they can make it far. I have always had big dreams about playing for big schools and going to the Olympics. Just like my father who came from a small town to play professional baseball for St.Louis. I know that if I keep training hard I will accomplish all of that with the help of God. I love helping others and I can't wait to major in physical therapy to help not only normal people who do everyday activities, but to help athletes get ready and stronger than they were before getting injured. I will always do everything with passion whether it is playing volleyball, going to school, or even helping people where ever they need me. I love to compete, I will NEVER be afraid to compete because it will only make me a better player. I strive to be the best there is every day of my life, not only physically but also mentally."
