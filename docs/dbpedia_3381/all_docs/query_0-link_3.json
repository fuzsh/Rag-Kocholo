He is known for conceiving how to make survey data, including pre-election forecasts, more accurate through statistical matching methods.\n\nMaking the most of basketball three-point shot data\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThis study’s primary goal is to help National Basketball Association (NBA) and other basketball teams worldwide increase their three-point shooting accuracy and decrease their opponents’, a key to winning more games. A related goal is to explain how a combination of good data, logistic regression analysis, likely effects reporting in probabilities or percentage points, and self-serve simulation can improve communication among data analysts, basketball coaches, and players, and enhance each group’s effectiveness. Logistic regression analysis of 32,511 NBA three-point shots shows six factors affect the three-point shooting percentage: closest defender’s distance to the shooter, time left on the 24-second shot clock, whether the player shot after dribbling or catching the ball, game period, shot distance, and venue. In the past, data analysts conveyed the results of such analyses to coaches and players using terms such as regression, logits, and odds. Some NBA executives say doing so again would be disastrous. An alternative is to emphasize probabilities and percentages in communication and create self-serve simulators coaches and players can use to predict how changes in critical factors affect three-point shooting percentages. NBA and other teams worldwide can apply this approach to new and existing datasets they maintain, enhance, and build.\n\nKey Words: self-serve simulation, predicted probabilities, logistic regression, likely effects reporting, psychotherapy\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe National Basketball Association (NBA) releases specific three-point shot characteristics, such as shooter name and shot distance. Aside from the 2014-15 season’s first 903 of 1,230 games (and 2015-16’s first 631, though the latter data are no longer publicly available), the released data exclude a variety of individual shot characteristics such as the closest defender’s distance to the shooter, a crucial defensive effectiveness measure (14). Teams are said to consider the excluded characteristics proprietary. As Mike Zarren, assistant general manager and chief legal counsel for the NBA’s Boston Celtics, explained, “You can’t share stuff with other teams…We are not at an equilibrium point where all the teams know what everyone else is doing. There are some advantages that some teams have over others” (15) (51:47).\n\nThe analyses here use the 2014-15 shot dataset, the last and largest single-season one containing full shot data that is publicly available. The main goal is to help NBA and other basketball teams worldwide increase their three-point shooting accuracy and decrease their opponents’. Teams that do so should win more games. A related goal is to explain how a combination of good data, logistic regression analysis, likely effects reporting in probabilities or percentage points (e.g., “Shooting off the catch rather than the dribble is associated with a two-percentage-point increase in our three-point shot make percentage.”), and self-serve simulation can improve communication among data analysts, basketball coaches, and players, and enhance each group’s effectiveness. NBA and other teams worldwide can apply this approach to new and existing datasets they maintain, enhance, and build. Aspects of the approach are also portable to many other issues and areas where the key outcome variable is binary (26).\n\nThis paper has seven additional sections (excluding references and other ancillary information). The first summarizes basic rules and strategies for NBA basketball, highlighting the importance of the three-point shot. It also explains why data analysts seeking to communicate effectively with coaches and players should consider using non-technical language. The second section describes the three-point shot data used in this paper’s analyses. It then provides the rationale for relying on logistic regression analysis for model building and prediction. The third section reports the results of the analyses and suggests how data analysts might share them with coaches and players. It also explores why academic researchers tend not to report likely effects in probabilities or percentage points. The fourth details how data analysts can build self-serve simulators that report likely effects in probabilities or percentage points. The limitations of this paper’s analyses are discussed in the fifth section. The next-to-last section describes how teams might apply the approach described here, while the final section provides concluding remarks.\n\nNBA Basketball: Basic Rules and Strategies\n\nNBA games have two teams with five players competing for four 12-minute periods (excluding possible five-minute overtime periods). To score, a team needs to shoot the ball through the basket. With the clock running, a successful shot is worth three or two points, depending on the shooter’s distance from the basket. The clock stops for free throws, which are uncontested 15-foot shots worth a single point awarded for specific infringements. One can calculate each shot’s expected value (EV) by multiplying its potential value by its average make percentage. For the 2022-23 regular season, the expected value of a three- and two-point shot was almost identical: 1.08 points (3*.36) for a three-pointer and 1.10 (2*.55) for a two-pointer. Each free throw’s expected value was .78 points (1*.78) or 1.56 for a more typical pair (3). A recent example shows why the expected value measure can be strategically important.\n\nIn the second round of the 2020-21 playoffs, the Atlanta Hawks shocked the heavily favored Philadelphia 76ers, coming from behind to win the seven-game series four to three. The Hawks’ decision to foul Ben Simmons repeatedly to force him to shoot free throws contributed to the victory. As Hall-of-Fame player Earvin “Magic” Johnson observed, “…it fueled the Hawks’ comeback” (13).\n\nSimmons shot just 33% (15 for 45) from the free-throw line for the series, far below his 61% (and the league’s 77%) regular season average. Simmons’s 33% figure suggests the Hawks expected him to score only .66 points for two free throws in a series in which his team made 40% of its three-pointers (for an expected value of 1.22 points) and 52% of its two-pointers (for a 1.05 expected value). That means the Hawks expected to gain .56 points (1.22 – .66) for a replaced three-point shot and .39 points (1.05 – .66) for a replaced two-pointer with the foul Simmons strategy. Perhaps more notably, it may have affected Simmons’s decision-making. To his team’s detriment, Simmons chose not to attempt an open lay-up or dunk with 3:30 remaining in game seven (4), arguably for fear of getting fouled and having to shoot free throws (21, 27).\n\nOverstating three-point shooting’s significance is difficult. In 2022-23, the Toronto Raptors, Charlotte Hornets, and Houston Rockets won 41, 27, and 21 (of 82) regular season games, too few to qualify for the post-season playoffs; their three-point shooting percentages of 34%, 33%, and 33% were the league’s worst. The Philadelphia 76ers, Golden State Warriors, and Los Angeles Clippers won 54, 44, and 44 games, enough to compete in the playoffs; they were top performers in three-point shooting at 39%, 39%, and 38%. These data and separate multi-season analyses (18, 20) suggest that winning in the NBA hinges heavily on making (and defending) three-point shots.\n\nClear Communication\n\nAn excellent statistical model is “a simplified version of reality, like a street map that shows you how to travel from one part of a city to another” (28) (p. ix). But that map will not help you find your way if it includes esoteric terms or unfamiliar signs or symbols. Likewise, if data analysts use uncommon language when giving advice, coaches and players may feel lost. Mike Zarren would agree. If Celtics’ data analysts were to apply logistic regression to three-point shot data, he would tell them to communicate what they learn “without using the word regression because that’s a disaster” (15) (11:18). Terms like logits, standard deviations, odds, odds ratios, and z scores also would be off-limits. Zarren does not believe coaches and players are unintelligent. Even good data analysts can find aspects of logistic regression challenging. That is why DeMaris (7) (p. 1,057) observed, “…there is still considerable confusion about the interpretation of logistic regression results.” And why Gelman and Hill (11) (p. 83) commented, “…the concept of odds can be difficult to understand, and odds ratios are even more obscure.”\n\nWashington Wizards’ assistant coach Dean Oliver’s views on clear communication resemble Zarren’s. “When I directed quantitative analysis for the Denver Nuggets and would prepare stuff for coaches,” he said, “there were actually very few numbers in there. It was usually words because it was easier for them to absorb…” (15) (48:54).\n\nAn alternative to avoiding numbers is to report key predictor variables’ likely effects with familiar ones like probabilities and percentages—the NBA reports various descriptive statistics and cross-tabulations on its website, emphasizing percentages, hence coaches’ and players’ familiarity.\n\nMethods\n\nData\n\nThe NBA has used technology to gather detailed player performance data since the 2013-14 season via SportVU, then Second Spectrum. The analyses here use SportVU data, described as “real-time and innovative statistics based on speed, distance, player separation, and ball possession for comprehensive analysis of players and teams” (25). How did the SportVU system work? In each arena’s rafters, six cameras recorded information throughout each game in .04-second intervals, producing 25 images per second. A computer algorithm then plotted the locations of the ball, basket, and 10 players. SportVU delivered data and reports to each team and the league as a last step.\n\nAs noted earlier, the NBA made available SportVU raw, shot-level data—including the defender distance variable—for three-quarters of the 2014-15 regular season. (The NBA also made available raw, shot-level data early in the 2015-16 season before discontinuing the practice entirely in January 2016. The latter dataset is no longer publicly available.) The 2014-15 dataset (17)—the last and largest single-season one publicly available—contains 21 variables and 128,069 three- and two-point shots, as described in the Appendix. After making minor changes (e.g., removing two-point shots), the remaining three-point shots totaled 32,511—11,426 makes and 21,085 misses—taken from October 28, 2014, through March 4, 2015.\n\nAnalysis Method\n\nLogistic regression models the relationship between a binary outcome (e.g., made or missed three-point shots, or nearly anything with a yes or no interpretation) and, typically, several predictor or explanatory variables. It is ideal for identifying and estimating the effects of actions to increase or decrease the size or proportion of the group of interest, specifically, made three-point shots. It can also predict each three-point shot’s probability of belonging to the “made” rather than the “missed” group. Many academic researchers consider it “the standard way to model binary outcomes” (11) (p. 79), “dominating all other methods in both the social and biomedical sciences” (2) (para. 1).\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe final logistic regression model comprises one dependent and six predictor variables. The predictor variables were selected based on their relationship with the dependent variable, one another, theory, availability, and their effect on the model’s predictive accuracy. Below are descriptions of the seven variables and brief explanations for how they may differ from the original ones described in the Appendix.\n\nShotResult: The dependent variable: whether the shooter made the shot. (Values: 0=Missed, 1=Made; Original variable: Fgm)\n\nDefDist: The closest defender’s distance to the shooter in feet (ft.). Basketball players and coaches recommended a four-category variable after discussions and preliminary analyses. (Values: 1=0-3 ft., 2=3-6 ft., 3=6-9 ft., 4=9+ ft.; Original variable: Close_Def_Dist)\n\nShotClock: The number of seconds (secs.) on the 24-second shot clock. Analyses showed steep drops in the make probability at the 4- and 2-second marks, thus the decision to create a variable with three categories. (Values: 1=0-2 secs., 2=2-4 secs., 3=4+ secs; Original variable: Shot_Clock)\n\nCatch: Whether the shooter took the shot off the catch or dribble. The original variable reported the number of dribbles the shooter took before shooting. Basketball players and coaches recommended a two-category variable after discussions and preliminary analyses. (Values: 1=Off Catch, 2=Off Dribble; Original variable: Dribbles)\n\nPeriod: The game period when the shot was taken, with fourth period and overtime shots pooled because of their similar make percentages. (Values: 1=1, 2=2, 3=3, 4=4+; Original variable: Period)\n\nShotDist: The distance in feet from the center of the basket to the shooter. Basketball players and coaches recommended a four-category variable after discussions and preliminary analyses. (Values: 1=22-24 ft., 2=24-25 ft., 3=25-26 ft., 4=26+ ft.; Original variable: Shot_Dist)\n\nVenue: Whether it was a home or away game for the shooter’s team. (Values: 0=Away, 1=Home; Original variable: Location)\n\nTable 1 reports the logistic regression analysis results, notably, standard information such as logit coefficients, odds, z scores, and a measure of statistical significance (i.e., p>z). It also reports useful non-standard information such as frequencies, (predicted) probabilities, and expected values. The rationale for reporting standard and non-standard information, to borrow from the statistician Frederick Mosteller, is to “let weaknesses from one…be buttressed by strength from another” (16) (Ch. 4, p. 116), a concept he referred to as “balancing biases.” As envisioned, data analysts can rely on standard information when building and evaluating logistic regression models, and non-standard when communicating the results and their implications to coaches and players.\n\nTable 1.\n\nResults of final logistic regression analysis\n\nNote. n=32,511. Log pseudolikelihood, starting value: -21,078.18; final value: -20,827.69. Likelihood ratio (degrees of freedom=13): 498.44, p > chi2 = 0.00. Tjur R2: 0.014; McFadden R2: 0.012. Stukel chi2(1) = 4.10, p > chi2 = 0.043\n\nStandard versus Non-Standard Interpretations\n\nTable 1 shows that the defender distance variable (DefDist) affects the outcome variable. A standard interpretation would emphasize odds ratios and statistical significance:\n\nControlling for other variables’ effects, three-point shots taken with the closest defender 9+ feet away have a:\n\n60% higher odds (i.e., 1.6/1) of going in than those taken with the closest defender 0-3 feet away,\n\n24% higher odds (i.e., 1.6/1.29) than those with the defender 3-6 feet away, and\n\n10% higher odds (i.e., 1.6/1.46) than those with the defender 6-9 feet away.\n\nEach effect is statistically significant, as their z scores show.\n\nAlthough the standard interpretation is correct from a technical standpoint, coaches and players may not understand or act on it, given Zarren’s and Oliver’s comments (as well as those of DeMaris, Gelman, and Hill). Now consider a non-standard interpretation (that relies on Table 1’s non-standard information). Note that each percentage’s associated expected value is in parentheses.\n\nAll else unchanged, the percentage of three-point makes would decrease from 35% (1.05 pts.) to:\n\n29% (0.86 pts.) with the defender always 0-3 feet away from the shooter, and\n\n34% (1.02 pts.) with the defender always 3-6 feet away.\n\nIt would increase from 35% to:\n\n37% (1.11 pts.) with the defender always 6-9 feet away, and\n\n39% (1.17 pts.) with the defender always 9+ feet away.\n\nNBA coaches and players would probably prefer the non-standard interpretation. Arguably, reporting the likely effect in percentage points instead of odds is more intuitive and actionable (26, 30).\n\nCalculating Each Shot’s Make Probability\n\nAnother number to note in Table 1 is the constant of -1.46 logits which translates to a predicted make probability of 19% (0.56 pts.). The -1.46 number represents a three-point shot with the lowest value on each predictor variable:\n\nDefender 0-3 feet away\n\n0-2 seconds on the shot clock\n\nOff the catch\n\nFirst period\n\nShot distance of 22-24 feet\n\nAway game\n\nAn implication is that it is possible to calculate the predicted make probability of each of the 32,511 shots. Such information can spark curiosity and foster improved performance for a player scrutinizing his own (or opponents’) shot data. For example, Row 1 of Table 2 reports the logit coefficients associated with the first three-point shot Klay Thompson of the Golden State Warriors attempted in 2014-15. In the third period of an away game versus the Sacramento Kings with 4.6 seconds on the shot clock, Thompson missed from 22 feet off the catch with the defender 3.9 feet away. As the column titled Prob shows, that shot’s predicted make probability was 38% (.38*100), calculated by applying the following formula to select Table 2 numbers: exp (sum of logit coefficients + constant)/ (exp (sum of logit coefficients + constant) +1).\n\nUpon closer examination, Thompson could have asked the team’s data analysts how that shot’s make probability would have changed had the defender been 9+ rather than 3.9 feet away. To respond, an analyst could have replaced the DefDist logit coefficient of 0.25 with 0.47, the one corresponding to a 9+ feet value. As shown in Row 2, the make probability would have risen to 42%, a four-percentage-point increase or likely effect.\n\nThompson next might have asked how shooting off the dribble rather than the catch would have affected the 42% probability. After replacing the Catch logit coefficient of 0 with-0.09, an analyst could have reported that the probability would have dropped to 39%, as Row 3 of the Prob column shows.\n\nThompson, an excellent shooter, would probably work to improve specific aspects of his shooting if he had such data for all his three-point shots (31).\n\nTable 2.\n\nSimulating the effect of changes on a single shot’s make probability\n\nPredicting the Likely Effect of Multiple Changes to Multiple Predictor Variables\n\nCoaches thinking more broadly might focus on all 32,511 shots and ask analysts to predict the likely effect of multiple changes to the values of multiple predictor variables. Building on the Thompson example, analysts could approach the task by conceptualizing changes as scenarios. Below, and graphically in Figure 1, are three illustrative ones.\n\nScenario 1. Players take all 32,511 three-point shots with the defender 9+ ft. away.\n\nPrediction: 39% of all three-pointers will go in, an increase of four percentage points compared to the 35% baseline, translating to 1,297 more makes and 12,723 total ones.\n\nScenario 2. Players take all 32,511 three-point shots:\n\nwith the defender 9+ feet away\n\nfrom 22-24 ft. away from the basket\n\nPrediction: 42% of all shots will go in, a three-percentage-point gain vs. Scenario 1. This translates to 808 more makes and 13,531 total makes.\n\nScenario 3. Players take all 32,511 three-point shots:\n\nwith the defender 9+ ft. away\n\nfrom 22-24 ft. away from the basket\n\nwith 4+ seconds on the 24-second shot clock\n\nPrediction: 43% of all shots will go in, an increase of another percentage point compared to Scenario 2, translating to 370 more makes and 13,901 total ones.\n\nFigure 1.\n\nPercentage of predicted makes by scenario\n\nEach scenario’s likely effect results from all-or-nothing simulation. How does it work? For any predictor variable, such as Catch, data analysts select one target value—either “Off Catch” (occurring 75% of the time) or “Off Dribble” (25%). Assume they choose “Off Catch,” with a logit coefficient of 0, as Table 1 shows. For the 8,127 “Off Dribble” shots, they would replace the coefficient of -0.09, also shown in Table 1, with 0 and calculate the new likely effect: 158 more made three-pointers for the season, translating to 11,584 total makes.\n\nAdopting a fine-tuning approach is another possibility. After examining the frequency distribution of the Catch values, analysts could specify a new distribution, such as 92% “Off Catch” and 8% “Off Dribble,” ensuring the total sums to 100%. They would keep the original 24,384 “Off Catch” values (i.e., 75%) and change the -0.09 coefficient to 0 for another 2,600 selected randomly from the original 8,127 “Off Dribble” values to achieve the 92:8 ratio. The change would result in 11,530 made three-pointers, 54 less (i.e., 11,584-11,530) than if players had taken all shots off the catch.\n\nIf coaches and players embrace simulation, there could be too many scenarios for data analysts to handle. To stay ahead of demand, they could build self-serve simulators tailored explicitly for coaches’ and players’ use. Finding prototypes in academic research will be a struggle, however, arguably because of the non-linear relationship between logits and probabilities (26, 30) and its dampening effect on reporting likely effects in probabilities or percentage points. Figure 2 plots illustrative logit and probability values to cast light on that relationship.\n\nFigure 2.\n\nThe non-linear relationship between logits (x-axis) and probabilities (y-axis)\n\nNote how a one-logit increase from zero to one on the x-axis corresponds to a .23 probability increase (from .5 to .73) on the y-axis. Yet a one-logit increase from four to five (or minus 5 to minus 4) translates only to a tiny probability increase. As shown in Table 1 (and later in Table 3), it is still possible to report the effect of a predictor variable, x, on a binary outcome, y, in probabilities or percentage points (e.g., a one-unit change in x is associated with a three-percentage-point increase in y, all else being equal). Arguably, it is also sensible to do so, not least because NBA players make roughly 35% of their three-point shots and the relationship between logits and probabilities is reasonably linear between .2 and .8 on the probability scale, as Figure 2 shows. But in more extreme cases, as Figure 2 suggests, the effect size will depend heavily on the value of y and the values of the model’s other predictor variables. More precisely, the size of the effect will decrease near 0 and 1. As a result, x’s effect on y in probabilities percentage points “…cannot be fully represented by a single number” (19) (p. 23). That may be why some logistic regression experts (6-8) have advised against using probabilities or percentage points to report and interpret logistic regression coefficients’ overall effects. It also may be why most major statistical software packages do not produce effects in probabilities or percentage points through pre-packaged procedures or built-in modules. As an unintended consequence, some data analysts seeking guidance likely have had to fend for themselves.\n\nA GUIDE TO BUILDING SELF-SERVE SIMULATORS\n\nData analysts can use this guide to build simulators that report likely effects in probabilities or percentage points. (For convenience, references are made to the three-point shot data used in this paper’s analyses, although the guide is general and should work across areas of interest.) Several steps are involved in the process:\n\nStep 1. Ensure sufficient three-point shot data are available to conduct logistic regression analysis, which should be a straightforward task for NBA teams given the league’s business relationship with Second Spectrum (which replaced SportVU). How does one define sufficient? As a rule of thumb, at least 10 shot attempts are needed for each predictor variable in logistic regression model, adjusting for the expected shot make rate (or miss rate if it is lower than the make rate). For context, this paper’s main analysis with six predictor variables and a 35% expected make rate required a minimum of 171 three-point shot attempts: 10 * (6 /.35). For non-NBA teams requiring raw data, assistant coaches can record key shot characteristics with paper and pencil or specialized hand-held apps.\n\nStep 2. Develop a model to predict successful 3-point shots, the binary outcome of interest. Logistic regression produces a weight—a logit coefficient—for each category of each predictor variable. In an optimal model, those weights maximize the predicted probability gap between the mutually exclusive outcomes (1).\n\nStep 3. To calculate a single 2014-15 three-point shot’s make probability, sum the weights corresponding to its characteristics and add the constant. After that, apply the formula shown earlier to the result: exp (sum of logit coefficients + constant)/ (exp (sum of logit coefficients + constant) +1). Alternatively, request the predicted probability from the statistical software.\n\nStep 4. Do the same for the 32,510 remaining shots, sum all 32,511 probabilities, then take the average to compute the overall make probability. If the model predicts players will make 35% of all three-point shots, it translates to 11,426 makes (.35*32,511).\n\nStep 5. To enable the simulator to work online or in a mobile app, develop an algorithm using JavaScript. The simulator’s purpose is to let users see how changes they make to the values of the predictor variables affect the .35 probability.\n\nStep 6. Design a user interface, possibly by enlisting the support of someone familiar with website and app development.\n\nStep 7. Keep things simple initially—permit users to change only one value of one predictor variable. If it has two response choices like Away and Home, let the user change every Away response to Home or vice versa. Think of this as the all-or-nothing option.\n\nStep 8. For all 32,511 three-point shots, change the corresponding Away or Home logit coefficient (but no others) to align with the user’s selection, then recalculate the predicted make probability. The likely effect is the difference between the new and starting probability (and the new and starting makes).\n\nStep 9. Follow the same process to let users change the values of several predictor variables simultaneously.\n\nStep 10. Go further and allow users to change any predictor variable’s frequency distribution as they please, ensuring the distribution sums to 100%. Think of this as the fine-tuning option. The algorithm will need rules to accommodate the changes.\n\nWhat would all-or-nothing and fine-tuning self-serve simulators look like, and how would they function? Figure 3 shows a screenshot of a working all-or-nothing simulator (accessible at https://www.electricinsights.com/hoops1). The first column contains the predictor variables and their values. Column 2 shows the changes (in blue) the user made to the 2014-15 frequencies; the third column displays the original frequencies.\n\nFigure 3\n\nAll-or-nothing simulation\n\nAs Figure 3 shows, the user selected values of “0-3 ft.” for “Defender Distance,” “0-2 secs.” for “Time Left on Shot Clock,” “Dribble” for “Off Catch or Dribble?” and “26+ ft.” for “Shot Distance.” The likely effect is a 22-point decrease in the make probability, translating to 7,229 fewer makes and 4,197 total ones.\n\nPersonalized simulators for players like Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry could be more beneficial (and accurate) than a generic, all-player one. To support this point, Table 3 reports the results of a new analysis of Curry’s 2014-15 three-point shots. Note how the values of many key measures, such as frequencies and expected values, differ substantially from their Table 1 counterparts. Table 3 shows, for instance, that Curry took 54% of his three-pointers off the dribble with an expected value of 1.32 points per shot. But Table 1 showed NBA players (including Curry) took only 25% of their three-pointers off the dribble with a 1.01 points-per-shot expected value. Curry is not your average three-point shooter, hence the need for personalization.\n\nTable 3.\n\nResults of Steph Curry logistic regression analysis\n\nNote. n=j. Log pseudolikelihood, starting value: -305.04; final value: -294.46. Likelihood ratio (degrees of freedom=13): 21.16, p > chi2 = 0.07. Tjur R2: 0.047; McFadden R2: 0.035. Stukel chi2(1) = 4.38, p > chi2 = 0.11.\n\nA working fine-tuning simulator—a complement to the Curry analysis—is available at https://www.electricinsights.com/curry1. It lets users change any value of any predictor variable by any amount and see the likely effect. In the screenshot shown in Figure 4, the user changed Curry’s 2014-15 season frequencies (in parentheses) for “Defender Distance,” “Off Catch or Dribble?” and “Shot Distance.” The likely effect is a seven-percentage-point increase to his 42% average make probability, translating to 31 more makes (i.e., 220-189).\n\nFigure 4\n\nSteph Curry’s fine-tuning simulator\n\nDiscussion\n\nIf the sample size of three-point shots allows, data analysts can build all-or-nothing and fine-tuning simulators that include all teams and players, each team, and each player. Given sufficient demand, they can also do so with data for other major shot types (i.e., two-pointers and free throws).\n\nSeveral caveats are in order before describing how basketball teams might act on the results the approach described here, using the results (and simulators) shown earlier for illustration. First, inferences drawn from the 2014-15 dataset may no longer apply because of the time gap. Nor did this dataset include several three-point shot characteristics (e.g., closest defender’s height and reach, the game score at each shot) that could be important, which is a second caveat.\n\nA third caveat concerns the “all else the same” assumption, a logistic regression analysis theoretical staple. In practice, it may not hold up. Giving excellent three-point shooters more playing time, for example, could worsen teams defensively. Deciding who plays and why, a type of optimization, lies outside this paper’s scope.\n\nAnother caveat involves ease of implementation. Building and updating simulators like Curry’s for NBA players who shoot, say, 175 or more three-point shots per season may require automation. To characterize the task as trivial would be misleading.\n\nHumility and ignorance are two key factors to consider as the fifth caveat. Some NBA data analysts may have already adopted an approach combining good data, logistic regression, likely effects reporting in probabilities or percentage points, and self-serve simulation. As noted earlier, they work mainly in secrecy. And when they make comments at analytics conferences or similar forums, some are instructed “to go up on stage and talk about something without saying anything” (15) (51:37), according to Zarren.\n\nApplication In Sports\n\nGood basketball coaches position their players to make the highest percentage of three-pointers possible, all else equal. They also implement a defense to minimize opponents’ three-point make percentage. The analyses presented here suggest six factors affect the make percentage:\n\nClosest defender’s distance to the shooter\n\nTime left on the 24-second shot clock\n\nWhether the player shot off the dribble or catch\n\nGame period\n\nShot distance\n\nVenue\n\nHow might coaches act on these findings? There are numerous possibilities, starting with game pace. Fast ball movement from defense to offense (e.g., before the defense sets) gives the offensive team more time to find an open three-point shot, preferably before the four-second mark on the shot clock where shooting percentages dip, and unquestionably before the two-second mark where they plummet. As the NBA’s all-time leading three-point shooter, Steph Curry understands this well. Table 3 showed he attempted only two percent (compared to a five percent NBA average) of his three-point shots with less than two seconds on the shot clock.\n\nCoaches should design offensive plays and patterns to create at least three feet of space between the shooter and defender. A 22-24-foot shot’s make probability with the defender 0-3 feet away is only 29%, all else equal. It increases to 34% with the defender 3-6 feet away. Space is critical for Curry, too. He shot 11% of his three-pointers with the defender 0-3 feet away versus the NBA average of 6%, reducing his overall make percentage. It could have been worse. Had he taken all 448 of his shots with the defender 0-3 feet away, all other factors being equal, his make probability would have dropped from 42% to 24%.\n\nMaking sure players understand the characteristics of a desirable three-point shot is another opportunity. Personalized simulators like Curry’s can make each player’s shooting strengths and weaknesses obvious. For instance, some players may make a higher percentage of three-pointers off the dribble than catch. Others may suffer only a slight percentage point decline when guarded tightly or shooting from 26+ rather than 22-24 feet. And if those simulators contain opponents’ shot data, coaches could use them to determine how to exploit specific opponents’ weaknesses.\n\nAnalyses show the three-point make percentage drops in the fourth period. Player fitness could be a contributing factor. Without applicable data (e.g., feet, meters, or miles logged since tip-off), it is difficult or impossible to test the hypothesis. Maybe the players on the court lack the skills needed to shoot higher percentages. Or game stress could affect shooting performance—data on the game score at each shot would clarify the matter. For context, the all-or-nothing simulator would show that the highest probability three-point shot (46%) has these characteristics:\n\nDefender 9+ feet away\n\n4+ seconds on the shot clock\n\nOff the catch\n\nFirst period\n\n22-24 feet from the basket\n\nAt home\n\nThe simulator would also show that the 46% make probability drops to 42% in the fourth period, changing nothing else. That means players have grown tired, different players are on the court, game pressure has taken its toll, or unknown variables caused the drop. So how should head coaches make sense of this? Working with assistant coaches and data analysts, they can explore ways to increase players’ fitness levels, optimize substitution patterns, and help players cope better with pressure. If teams can access variables that were unavailable for analysis here, their analysts can include them in new models to estimate their likely effect.\n\nPlayers make a higher percentage of three-point shots at home than on the road, all else equal. Crowd noise, characteristics (e.g., lighting) of the less familiar setting, travel effects (e.g., uncomfortable hotel beds), or some combination of these may explain why. Coaches can look outside the league for ideas to help players overcome such obstacles. For instance, former US Navy SEAL commander Mark Divine prepares SEAL candidates for training by replicating the challenges they are likely to encounter, including Hell Week during which “each candidate sleeps only about four total hours but runs more than 200 miles and does physical training for more than 20 hours per day” (5).\n\nContrary to conventional wisdom, Divine’s SEALFIT program places particular emphasis on skills like positive visualization, breath control, and meditation because, as he said, “People who haven’t learned to control their mind and emotions quit or they get hurt” (10). Does SEALFIT work? Divine reports that nine of 10 SEAL candidates who complete SEALFIT training become SEALs (versus a 20% norm). He is confident that NBA players would benefit from the program (M. Divine, personal communication, March 11, 2022).\n\nA complementary tool for improving performance is psychotherapy. As described earlier, Ben Simmons’s decision to avoid attempting an open lay-up or dunk (arguably) for fear of being fouled and having to shoot free throws may have cost his team the 76ers a 2021 playoff series to the Hawks. As his teammate Joel Embiid declared, “That was the turning point” (12) (1:08). Psychotherapist Richard Schwartz, who developed the Internal Family Systems (IFS) therapeutic model (23), would probably concur then speculate that Simmons’s widely criticized decision (21, 27) originated from past trauma linked to his poor free-throw shooting. After citing evidence (24) of IFS’s effectiveness, Schwartz might posit that a protective part of Simmons’s mind—a “guardian of [his] inner world” (23) (p. 184)—compelled him to pass rather than shoot to prevent a traumatized part—think of it as a deeply wounded child—from re-experiencing pain or shame at the free throw line. Were Schwartz to work with Simmons, he would likely try to communicate with his mind’s traumatized part as if it were an actual person, restore its faith in Simmons’s free-throw shooting abilities, and encourage the protective part to undertake different tasks. The more traditional coaching approach of advising, or even requiring, Simmons to practice harder with expert guidance did not—and may never—work. As Early (9) observed, “Simmons has been reluctant to seek help from top shooting coaches…He reportedly clashed with his former team (the 76ers) years ago over who he would work with, preferring to practice with his brother rather than team shooting coach John Townsend.”\n\nCoaches can use the same strategies to reduce their opponent’s three-point shooting percentage they use to improve their own. Table 1 data (and the all-or-nothing simulator) suggest the key lies in forcing opponents to shoot with less than four seconds on the clock, off the dribble, from long distances while being closely guarded. Stepping up the defensive intensity in the first and third periods where the likelihood of making a three-point shot is relatively high, and motivating the home crowd to unsettle opponents makes sense, too.\n\nCoaches can also think about implementing a full- or three-quarter court press more often, maybe for entire games. The goals of a 2-2-1 three-quarter court press, for example, are control and containment, not turnover generation. As envisioned, its use would slow down the game and force opponents to shoot a higher percentage of difficult three-pointers with less time on the clock, reducing their make percentage. As Hall-of-Fame coach Jack Ramsay explained in Pressure Basketball, “The tempo of the game is controlled by the defensive team and the best manner of control is through the exertion of pressure at some point on the court” (22) (p. 80).\n\nGood data, logistic regression analysis, and self-serve simulation can also promote truth and trust, positive attributes for any coach or leader. Maybe tongue in cheek, former NBA coach Jeff Van Gundy (15) (17:40) confessed to lying to his players. “If I saw what I wanted to change,” he said, “I would either use numbers to support it or make them up because the players are not going to know the difference.” Giving players tools that predict the likely effects of their potential actions would be more truthful and potentially more effective, too.\n\nConclusions\n\nKeeping things simple is critical in basketball. According to Zarren (15) (7:00), “There are 20 things in (the coach’s) head that will get us X number of wins per season, but you can only focus on six of them in practice, and the players might only remember four and actually execute one in a game. So you’ve got to pick your battles if you’re a stats guy who…needs to talk to a coach. But if you’re a coach, you need to pick your battles, too.”\n\nVan Gundy (15) (16:51) offered data analysts and coaches strong advice related to this point from his coaching experience. “I wouldn’t tell a guy you’re 38% on three to four dribbles so dribble a fifth time because you go up to 40%,” he said. “You better be pretty sure about what you’re saying…You want players to feel confident. You don’t want them out there saying, ‘Was that [four] dribbles or [five] when I pull up?’”\n\nTo mitigate the risk of generating harmful insights, data analysts should actively engage coaches and players in making key analytical decisions (e.g., ensuring predictor variables and their levels are meaningful), not least because Van Gundy and others who share his philosophy consider basketball sense—the capacity to make wise choices that benefit the team—to be of paramount importance.\n\nArguably, self-serve simulation with likely effects reporting in probabilities or percentage points is steeped in such basketball sense. As a benefit, data analysts will not need to rely on technical terms (e.g., “he shoots two standard deviations below the league average when you force him to the left” (15) (48:20)), as former Memphis Grizzlies’ executive John Hollinger once did. Instead, they can speak with more authority using plain language (e.g., “his make probability drops to 28% when you force him to the left”). Or they can make self-serve simulators available to players (and coaches) and let them figure it out on their own. They may appreciate it, even cynics sharing Hall-of-Fame player Charles Barkley’s views: “Analytics don’t work at all. It’s just the crap that some people who are really smart made up to try to get in the game because they had no talent” (29) (2:05).\n\nNBA and other basketball teams worldwide should consider adopting an approach that combines good data, logistic regression analysis, likely effects reporting in probabilities or percentage points, and self-serve simulation. The possible benefits are myriad. It can help teams increase their three-point shooting percentages while lowering their opponents’; improve communication among data analysts, coaches, and players; enhance each group’s effectiveness; and lead to more wins.\n\nAppendix\n\nVariables in the 2014-15 NBA shot dataset\n\nGame_Id: The game’s unique identifier.\n\nMatchup: The teams competing.\n\nLocation: Whether it was a home or away game for the shooter’s team.\n\nOutcome: Whether the shooter’s team won or lost.\n\nFinal_Margin: By how many points the shooter’s team won or lost.\n\nShot_Number: The shooter’s nth shot that game.\n\nPeriod: The period in which the shooter took the shot.\n\nGame_Clock: Minutes and seconds left in the period in which the shooter took the shot.\n\nShot_Clock: Seconds remaining on the 24-second shot clock when the shooter took the shot.\n\nDribbles: Number of dribbles the shooter took before shooting.\n\nTouch_Time: Number of seconds the shooter had the ball before shooting.\n\nShot_Dist: Distance in feet from the center of the basket to the shooter.\n\nPts_Type: Whether the shooter attempted a two- or three-point shot.\n\nShot_Result: Whether the shooter made the shot.\n\nClosest Defender: Name of the defender closest to the shooter.\n\nClosest_Defender_Player_Id: The closest defender’s unique identifier.\n\nClose_Def_Dist: The closest defender’s distance to the shooter in feet.\n\nFgm: Whether the shooter made the shot.\n\nPts: The shot’s point value (0, 2 or 3).\n\nPlayer_Name: The shooter’s first and last name.\n\nPlayer_Id: The shooter’s unique identifier.\n\nNote: The original dataset contained 128,069 two- and three-point shots. After removing all two-point shots, and all three-point shots with a missing (or unimputable) value on the Shot_Clock variable, the size decreased to 32,511. For a value to be imputable, there had to be 24 seconds or less on the game clock when the player took the shot. In that case, the decision was made to replace the missing Shot_Clock value with the Game_Clock value.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThe author would like to thank David Clemm, Robert Eisinger, Ward Fonrose, John Geraci, Ryan Heaton, Adam Hoeflich, Priam Lacassagne, Roxane Lacassagne, and Mark Naples for reviewing earlier versions of this paper, and for providing helpful comments and suggestions.

Then, the data was sorted by city and state (or Canadian province). This process allowed the identification of the cities and states/provinces that host the largest number of minor league teams and leagues.\n\nResults: Minor league sports teams can be found in 43 of 50 U.S. states (86%) and the District of Columbia (i.e., Washington, DC) and 8 of 10 (80%) Canadian provinces. There are 12 North American cities or metropolitan areas that host four or more minor league teams: Atlanta, GA; Austin, TX; Birmingham, AL; Dallas-Fort Worth, TX; Des Moines, IA; Las Vegas, NV; New York, NY; Oklahoma City, OK; Salt Lake City, UT; San Antonio, TX; San Jose, CA; and Toronto, Ontario. Additionally, there are 24 cities that host three minor league teams that are distributed across 20 different states and provinces.\n\nConclusions: While select cities have attracted multiple minor league teams to their communities, these teams tend to be dispersed all over the United States and Canada. As expected, states with larger populations tend to host more teams. States with weather that allows year-round outdoor play tend to host more teams. Cities with successful franchises can use that demonstrated fan support to attract new teams and leagues to their communities.\n\nApplications in Sport: In addition to offering family entertainment, the minor leagues offer both players and professional staff the opportunity to enter the business of professional sports and work toward careers at the major league level. The results of this study illustrate where minor league teams can be found in the United States and Canada. From this list of cities, sports fans can watch up-and-coming players develop. Furthermore, sport educators can direct their students (i.e., aspiring sport administrators) to the cities and teams that may provide them with an entry-point into the field of sports administration.\n\nKey Words: Minor league sports, sports expansion possibilities, minor league team affiliations\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nOrganized sports may be thought of as the games people play. However, there is a very large business and financial infrastructure behind the scenes to allow those games to be played and the related fan experiences to be realized. Plunket Research estimated the total U.S. sports and recreation industry to be valued at over $550 billion in 2020 with the global market estimated to be worth $1.5 trillion (28).\n\nPlayers making it to the major league of their sport have had to successfully navigate a developmental path by playing in the minor league system and earning successive promotions to earn a spot on a major league roster. In some cases, such as baseball, basketball, and hockey, these minor league teams represent hierarchical levels in a player development path that is clearly laid out. This focus on player development prompted Major League Baseball to restructure its minor league system beginning with the 2021 season. The new model provided for increased player salaries, modernized facilities, and reduced travel time and costs. The restructuring reduced the number of affiliated teams from 160 to 120 (12, 20).\n\nMany colleges and universities offer sport management programs to serve interested students. Currently, there are 421 sport management programs in the United States at the Associates, Bachelors, Masters, and Doctoral levels (33). At the undergraduate level, Sport Management is the 38th most popular major among students. Each year, over 11,000 bachelor’s degrees in sport management are awarded (10). Furthermore, students from other disciplines (e.g., business, physical therapy, nutrition, hospitality, and others) often seek to apply their skills in the business and operation of sports teams. Much like athletes who seek to secure a position in the minor leagues to begin their hopeful path to the major leagues, many people interested in careers in sports administration and sports management begin their careers in the minor leagues as well.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to conduct an analysis of the geographic distribution of minor league sports teams and leagues in the United States and Canada. The results of this study will illustrate the cities, states, and provinces that currently host the most minor league teams. From this data, sports fans can incorporate a minor league game into their travel plans while prospective employees can see where their opportunities may be found and focus their job search activities accordingly. First, a broad overview of major and minor league sports is provided, including a look at the possible affiliations between major and minor league teams. Second, the geographic distribution of minor league teams will be provided to illustrate those states and cities that host multiple teams. Finally, the matrices of major and minor league cities are examined to identify the communities most likely to be discussed as expansion cities for major league sports.\n\nTHE ORGANIZATION OF MAJOR LEAGUE AND MINOR LEAGUE SPORTS\n\nIn the sections that follow, the teams and leagues involved in the major spectator team sports are profiled. Sports that have a longer professional history (such as football, baseball, or basketball) have a clear path of player development and a delineation between their ‘major’ and ‘minor’ leagues. For these sports, the minor league teams are included in this study.\n\nOther newer professional leagues (such as women’s soccer, women’s ice hockey, or men’s lacrosse), have not yet established a hierarchical path for player development. Rather, it is evolving and, in some cases, changing annually. As such, the athletes who do progress to compete at the highest available professional level (i.e., NWSL, PWHL, or NLL) do realize a pinnacle or ‘major’ achievement. However, these teams and leagues are more similar operationally (attendance, budgets, etc.) to minor league sports rather than the traditional major league sports of football, baseball, or basketball. For these sports, these teams and leagues are included in this study. In the future, with the stability and expansion of these leagues, these sports may attain the classification of ‘major’ league sports.\n\nMen’s Baseball\n\nThere are currently 30 Major League Baseball (MLB) teams operating in the United States and Canada (18). Each of these teams has an affiliated Triple-A, Double-A, High-A, and Low-A team. Additionally, MLB operates two leagues for first-year players: Arizona Complex League (ACL) and the Florida Complex League (FCL) where games are played at the Spring Training sites of MLB teams. Additional teams bring the total to 179 teams across 17 leagues in 43 states and 4 provinces (20). A list of minor league baseball teams is provided in Appendix A.\n\nAppendix A: Major League Baseball and Minor League Affiliates\n\nSource: (20).\n\nMen’s Basketball\n\nThere are currently 30 National Basketball Association (NBA) teams playing in the United States and Canada; 28 of these teams have an affiliated G-League (or, minor league) team (27). Two teams (G League Ignite of Las Vegas, NV; Capitanes Ciudad De Mexico of Mexico City) operate independently and without NBA team affiliation (1). A profile of NBA G-League teams is provided in Appendix B.\n\nAppendix B: G-League Teams and NBA Affiliations\n\nSource: (27).\n\nWomen’s Basketball\n\nThere are currently 12 Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA) teams playing in the United States (40). There is no existing minor league development system for the WNBA. With just 12 teams and a maximum of 12 roster spots per team (compared to 15 roster spots for the NBA), the competition for one of these coveted roster spots is intense. Players selected in the three-round draft are not guaranteed a roster spot. There has not been any recent expansion of the WNBA despite calls to expand opportunities for women athletes (39).\n\nMen’s Hockey\n\nThere are currently 32 National Hockey League (NHL) teams playing in the United States and Canada (24). The American Hockey League (AHL) serves as the top development league for the NHL. There are currently 32 AHL teams playing in the United States and Canada (6). The vast majority of AHL players were selected in the NHL draft and have been signed to player development contracts (17). A level below the AHL is the ECHL (formerly known as the East Coast Hockey League) with 28 teams, with each team affiliated with an AHL and NHL team (11). A list of AHL and ECHL teams is provided in Appendix C.\n\nAppendix C: American Hockey League Teams and Affiliated NHL Teams\n\nSource: (13).\n\nMen’s Soccer\n\nThere are currently 29 Major League Soccer (MLS) teams playing in the United States and Canada (19). The USL Championship League is sanctioned by the U.S. Soccer Federation as a Division II professional league. The USL Championship League includes 24 teams located in the United States with expansion teams planned. A level below, the USL League One has 12 teams with 2 expansion teams planned. (36). A list of USL Championship and USL League One teams is provided in Appendix D.\n\nSource: (36).\n\nWomen’s Soccer\n\nThere are currently 14 National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) teams competing in the United States (26). A list of NWSL teams is provided in Appendix E. The United Soccer League (USL) is introducing the USL W League in Summer 2024. There are plans for 44 teams located in 20 different states. The USL W League hopes to “bring elite women’s soccer to communities across the U.S., creating more opportunities to play, watch and work in the women’s game.” The USL W league will be introduced as a para-professional league, meaning the players will retain their amateur status (37). For this reason, these teams are not included in this analysis.\n\nMen’s Football\n\nThere are currently 32 National Football League (NFL) teams competing in the United States (23) and 9 Canadian Football League (CFL) teams competing in Canada (9). Over time, there have been competing and/or feeder leagues to the NFL, including the World Football League (WFL), the United States Football League (USFL), the Extreme Football League (XFL), and the Spring League. In December 2023, it was announced that the USFL and XFL would merge to create the United Football League (UFL) and begin play in the spring of 2024 (32). Through the merger process, eight teams were retained and eight teams ceased operations. One city (Houston, TX) previously hosted both USFL and XFL teams prior to the merger. The XFL Houston Roughnecks ‘survived’ the merger while the USFL Houston Gamblers did not. The following cities lost their USFL and XFL teams beginning in the 2024 season (16):\n\nNew York/New Jersey Metro\n\nNew Orleans, LA\n\nPhiladelphia, PA\n\nPittsburgh, PA\n\nOrlando, FL\n\nSeattle, WA\n\nLas Vegas, NA\n\nIndoor or Arena Football has been played in various locations since the mid-1980s with the Indoor Football League (IFL) being the longest-running league. There are 16 IFL teams playing in 2024. IFL personnel, including players, coaches, scouts and front office professionals have transitioned to the National Football League (15). In addition, the National Arena League (NAL) operates a 6-team league (22). A review of the various non-NFL football teams is provided in Appendix F.\n\nMen’s Lacrosse\n\nThere are currently 15 National Lacrosse League (NLL) teams competing in the United States and Canada (25). The league plays its games in indoor arenas, often the same arenas that host minor league hockey and NBA G-League basketball teams. A list of NLL teams is provided in Appendix G. Beginning in Summer 2023, the Premier Lacrosse League started play with 8 teams in the United States. In its inaugural season, all 8 teams travelled to a select city for competition each weekend. City names are not attached to teams (29). As such, these teams are not included in this analysis.\n\nWomen’s Professional Hockey\n\nThe Professional Women’s Hockey League (PWHL) began its inaugural season in January 2024. The newly-created league consists of 6 teams across the United States and Canada with teams located in Boston, Minneapolis, Montreal, New York City, Ottawa, and Toronto (30).\n\nMiscellaneous: Athletes United\n\nSince 2020, Athletes Unlimited has introduced professional leagues in women’s basketball, volleyball, lacrosse, and softball. The leagues state they are ‘player-centric’ while avoiding the traditional model of city-identified teams. With this model, many American athletes can play professionally in their home country rather than competing abroad (7). However, teams are not based in home cities. As such, these teams are not included in this analysis.\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nThe minor league teams and leagues profiled above that operated in the 2023-24 seasons were identified and assembled into a database to allow the analysis of the location of the teams. The sorting function in Microsoft Excel allowed the researchers to identify the frequency of occurrence for city, state, and province, resulting in the identification of the following groups:\n\nStates and/or provinces that host the most minor league teams;\n\nCities that host the most minor league teams;\n\nCities that are most likely to be considered for league expansion in the future.\n\nRESULTS\n\nWhile select cities have attracted multiple minor league sports teams to their communities, these teams tend to be dispersed all over the United States and Canada. In the United States, 43 of 50 states (86%) host at least one minor league team. The states that do not current host a team are Alaska, Hawaii, Louisiana, Montana, North Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming. In the Lower 48 states (excluding Alaska and Hawaii), minor league sports can be found in 43 of 48 (90%) of the states with the missing states being sparsely populated (with the notable exception of Louisiana).\n\nIn Canada, minor league teams can be found in 8 of 13 Canadian Provinces or Territories. The provinces that do not current host a team are New Brunswick, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Prince Edward Island, and Yukon. Similar to the pattern found in the United States, teams can be found in 8 of 10 Canadian provinces (80%) with no teams located in the three more sparsely-populated Canadian Territories of Northwest, Nunavut, and the Yukon.\n\nA city-by-city mapping of each minor league team located in the United States and Canada is presented in Figure 1. The heat mapping function in Microsoft Excel was used to generate Figure 2, a visual presentation of the frequency of location of minor league teams per state and province.\n\nInterestingly, minor league teams have been located previously in Hawaii (baseball), Louisiana (baseball), Montana (baseball), North Dakota (indoor football), Vermont (baseball), and Wyoming (baseball). However, no teams existed in these states during the 2023-24 season. In fact, some of these baseball teams were among the 40 teams affected by the realignment of minor league baseball to begin the 2021 season (see 20, 31).\n\nState-by-State Analysis\n\nThe following states host the largest number of minor league teams:\n\nCalifornia (26 teams in 17 different communities)\n\nTexas (25 teams in 15 different communities)\n\nFlorida (23 teams in 16 different communities)\n\nNew York (19 teams in 12 different communities)\n\nNorth Carolina (17 teams in 12 different communities)\n\nPennsylvania (12 teams in 9 different communities)\n\nOhio (10 teams in 7 different communities)\n\nGeorgia (9 teams in 8 different communities)\n\nIowa (8 teams in 5 different communities)\n\nMichigan (8 teams in 5 different communities)\n\nSouth Carolina (8 teams in 4 different communities)\n\nOklahoma (7 teams I 2 different communities)\n\nWashington (7 teams in 4 different communities)\n\nArizona (7 teams in 3 different communities)\n\nIndiana (7 teams in 3 different communities)\n\nVirginia (7 teams in 5 different communities)\n\nProvince-by Province Analysis\n\nThe following Canadian provinces host the largest number of minor league teams:\n\nOntario (6 teams in 3 communities)\n\nBritish Columbia (3 teams in 2 communities)\n\nQuebec (3 teams in 2 communities)\n\nAlberta, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, and Saskatoon (1 team each)\n\nIt must be noted that junior hockey is a very popular spectator sport in Canada. However, most junior hockey players are classified as ‘amateurs’ (2). For this reason, Canadian junior hockey teams are not included in this analysis.\n\nCity-by-City Analysis\n\nAs illustrated above, many communities host more than one minor league team. Furthermore, some cities with minor league teams also host major league sports teams. For example, Charlotte, North Carolina hosts an NFL team (Carolina Panthers), an NBA team (Charlotte Hornets), and an MLS team (Charlotte FC) in addition to hosting minor league teams in baseball, hockey, and soccer. Nearby Greensboro, North Carolina also hosts three minor league teams in basketball, indoor football, and baseball but hosts no major league teams.\n\nTable 1 provides an overview of the 12 cities that host four or more minor league teams. The reader will note that some the cities are larger metropolitan areas with teams located both in the city and the suburbs. Atlanta, for example, has one team in the city but four teams in its suburbs in close proximity to central Atlanta. These communities with a concentration of minor league teams often host additional sporting events, such as golf tournaments, auto races, or college football bowl games.\n\nSan Diego is an interesting case. In addition to hosting the San Diego Padres (MLB), the city previously hosted an NFL team (San Diego Chargers) and two NBA teams (San Diego Rockets and San Diego Clippers). All three of these professional teams continue to exist but relocated to other cities. San Diego has effectively attracted minor league teams to fill the voids left by the departure of these teams. Recently, the San Diego Loyal soccer team (USL Championship League) ceased operations after the 2023 season after failing to find a long-term home stadium option (14). However, an MLS expansion team (to be known as San Diego FC) will begin play in the 2025 season (34).\n\nTable 2 provides an overview of cities that host three minor league teams. Included in Table 2 is each city’s ranking in size as a media market (21). Also, any professional teams in these same cities are shown with their table cell shaded. Sports not currently playing in those communities represent opportunities to expand a city’s minor league sports portfolio. It is interesting to note that some of these 3-team cities (such as Worchester, MA or Tacoma, WA) are very close to neighboring cities of top 15 media markets.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nAs expected, larger states with larger populations tend to host more minor league teams. Concurrently, cities with larger populations (and larger media markets) tend to host more minor league teams. The three states with largest number of minor league teams (California, Texas, and Florida) also offer a climate conducive to year-round outdoor activities. Cities with successful franchises can use that demonstration of fan support to attract new teams and leagues to their communities. Furthermore, shared facilities (such as an arena that can host basketball, hockey, and arena football) can help bring new teams to a community.\n\nAs previously noted, many cities host both major and minor league teams. Intuitively, these locations should attract the most attention should leagues consider expansion as the fan bases have demonstrated sufficient levels of support to sustain a major league team. These cities are listed in Table 3. Additionally, these cities tend to be the larger media markets with larger numbers of consumers. As an illustration, at the time of this writing the Oakland Athletics are strongly considering moving to Las Vegas, NV and have already received the approval to move by Major League Baseball owners (3-5).\n\nINSERT TBL3\n\nA Cautionary Note – Minor League Baseball Relocations\n\nIn 2020, Major League Baseball issued new facility standards for minor league teams, including: minimum clubhouse sizes for both home and visiting teams; food preparation and dining areas attached to clubhouses; better field lighting; more and better training space for players; separate space for female staffer, and others (31). Given that many minor league stadiums are municipally-owned, some communities may be unwilling or unable to make the needed investments in upgrades and may see their teams migrate to other communities, particularly at the A- and AA-levels.\n\nIn fact, some team movement has already been announced as the Kinston, North Carolina team (now known as the Down East Wood Ducks) have been purchased by Diamond Baseball Holdings (the largest owner of minor league baseball franchises) and will relocate to a new yet-to-be-built stadium in Spartanburg, South Carolina and assume a new team name as early as the 2025 season (8). This move marks the return of minor league baseball to Spartanburg, which previously hosted the Spartanburg Phillies from 1963-1980 and again from 1986-1994 (38).\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nMinor league sports teams are widely distributed across the United States and Canada with 86% of U.S. states and 80% of Canadian provinces hosting at least one minor league team. These 43 U.S. states host 97% of the U.S. population while the 8 provinces host 96% of the Canadian population. The highest concentration of teams can be found in four geographic areas in the United States: (1) the southeast Atlantic corridor from Virginia south through Florida; (2) the eastern Midwest and Northeast including Pennsylvania, New York, and Massachusetts; (3) the Southwest including Texas and its border states; and (4) the West coast primarily concentrated in California. In Canada, Ontario (i.e., the Toronto area), British Columbia (i.e., the Vancouver area), and Quebec host more minor league teams than the other provinces.\n\nIn addition to offering family entertainment, the minor leagues offer both players and professional staff the opportunity to enter the business of professional sports and work toward careers at the major league level. The results of this study illustrate where minor league sports teams can be found in the United States and Canada. From this list of cities, sports fans can watch up-and-coming players develop. Furthermore, sport educators can direct their students (i.e., aspiring sport administrators) to teams for internships and entry-level employment opportunities.\n\nAPPLICATION IN SPORT\n\nIn team sports, most professional athletes go through a player development process that includes some stint in the minor leagues in the hopes of earning a spot on a major league team. Similarly, many sport administrators begin their careers working for minor leagues and affiliated teams as they learn their craft and assemble the needed experiences for (hopeful) promotion to the major league level. The results of this study allow interested parties to easily identify the communities with greater access to minor league sports (for both fans and prospective employees). Sports fans should find this information helpful as minor league sports provide a good financial value in family entertainment. College students may find internship and employment opportunities with these minor league teams to aid their entry into a career of sport administration and management. Sport administration educators may find this information helpful as they advise and counsel their students for internships, co-operative employment opportunities, and job placement after graduation.\n\nThe communities identified here with multiple sports properties may allow a student to work in multiple sports in the same city (say, basketball in winter and baseball in spring, summer, and fall). In many instances, there may be an overlap in the ownership groups of minor league teams. This overlap in ownership may expand professional opportunities for employees as well-performing employees are offered additional positions and responsibilities elsewhere in the organization.\n\nThese communities also tend to host other events, such as college football bowl games or golf tournaments. These special events will need qualified staff to deliver these events, which will include people already living and working in those communities in the sports industry. Much like athletes in the minor leagues work to advance toward the major league ranks, so, too, can staff personnel ‘climb the ladder’ toward careers in the major leagues.\n\nReferences\n\nAdams, Luke (2022, November 6).

However, there is limited research to address these issues in strength sports, particularly the sport of Powerlifting. Methods: This study employed the Multidimensional Body Image Self Relations Questionnaire (MBSRQ), which recruited 365 male participants across the following subgroups. Powerlifters (P) (n = 133), Active Subjects (AS) (n = 79), Appearance Based Sports (ABS) (n = 68), Strength Sports (SS) (n = 47) and Other Sports (OS) (n = 38). Results: One–way ANOVA showed significant (p < 0.05) results between all groups across six of the nine MBSRQ subscales. Post hoc comparisons found nine significant results with the powerlifting group achieving two of them against OS (p < 0.01) and AS (p < 0.01) groups respectively. Conclusions: Overall, the results showed that male powerlifters expressed their bodies-as-function rather than their bodies-as-object with regard to health evaluation and fitness orientation. This is supported by their stable and balanced scores across the MBSRQ subscales which indicates they have healthier and lower perceptions of negative body image concerns. The powerlifters results implied that a focus on objective performance improvement and maintaining a healthy body to prevent injury had body image benefits. Applications in Sport: The study concludes that male powerlifters present healthy body image perceptions compared to the other males in their respective sports and focus on their body functionality objectively rather than the subjective perception and presentation of their body image.\n\nKeywords: Powerlifting, Body Image, Weight Classed Sports\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nFor this paper, the definition of Body image is referred to as “relating to a person’s perceptions, feelings and thoughts about his or her body, and is usually conceptualized as incorporating body size estimation, evaluation of body attractiveness and emotions associated with body shape and size” [1-2]. There has been extensive work conducted on the influence of body image in the media [3], in Western culture [4] and job roles such as the fitness industry [5]. Other comparisons include comparing body image within a range of demographic factors such as between athletes and non-athletes [6], age [7], nationality and ethnicity [8]. Cash and Pruzinsky [9] have defined five dimensions of body image, which work together to create an overall body image. However, these dimensions fails to mention the broader cultural and social contexts that influence body image [10]. They suggested that athletes dealing with sporting and societal pressures may experience adverse outcomes such as eating disorders or a negative perception of their body image. Such factors may lead to these pressures as a result of media and advertisements [11], supplements [12] and the use of image and performance-enhancing drugs [13].\n\nBackground of Powerlifting\n\nPowerlifting athletes are scored on objective performance measures rather than appearance evaluations. Powerlifting tests athletes on their objective strength and has traditionally been male-dominated [14]. However, in the last twenty years, female participation has significantly increased [15]. Richardson and Chen [16] state that powerlifting is a competitive strength sport comprising three techniques: the Squat, the Bench Press and the Deadlift [17-18]. The aim is to lift the most weight across the three movements for nine attempts [18]. Sports similar to powerlifting that heavily rely upon strength include Olympic weightlifting [19], strongman [20], highland games [21] and the shot–put [22], to name but a few examples. Not all of these sports mentioned have a weight class or a weight requirement, but for those that do, depending on the rules of the competition, this weight requirement may be evaluated within twenty-four or even forty-eight hours prior to the event [23]. Weight classes help ensure fairness in competition and increase the pre-competition demands of participants to enter the weight category that maximizes their advantages. Experts argue that making weight places psychological demands on athletes who may be inclined to make drastic weight cuts to gain a competitive advantage [24]. However, as powerlifters are evaluated on the amount of weight lifted, the training is based on objective scoring criteria. As scoring is objectively determined, and not a third party as in aesthetic sports, this has important implications for positive psychological adaptations [25].\n\nTheoretical models and frameworks\n\nTheoretical models of body image, such as Objectification theory, focus on the impact on men of a culture that increasingly objectifies men’s bodies. It suggests that men, like women, may experience self-objectification [26]. For men, the dual focus on both leanness and muscularity characterizing the male body ideal may motivate a particularly maladaptive set of behaviors designed to achieve these goals, such as rigid exercise routines, hidden use of image and performance-enhancing drugs (IPEDs) [27]. Subsequently, the literature has claimed that men may suffer from body image concerns and dysfunctional behavior [28]. Some research argues that young men experience societal pressure to achieve the muscular mesomorphic body shape, and this behaviour leads to a drive for muscularity [29].\n\nFurther, studies have demonstrated that sociocultural pressures mediated by social comparisons and internalization of muscular and low-fat ideals are associated with men’s body dissatisfaction and drive for muscularity, which might lead to disordered eating [30]. Most research has focused on aesthetic sports such as bodybuilding [31-32]. These explanations fail to consider how individuals think, feel and behave concerning their body functionality [33]. How powerlifters think, feel, and behave about their body functionality in a sport concerned with achieving objective demands is essential to achieving a more complete and holistic understanding of body image in this context [34].\n\nTheoretically, the subjective perception of muscularity depends on the individuals’ perception of body image, which for powerlifting tends toward a functional muscularity rather than aesthetic muscularity due to the sport’s rules. Critically, the self-objectification model does not consider the functionally orientated nature of sporting competition and its impact on male psychology [35]. Therefore, the athletes have a strong sense of control and need to prepare, train and diet concerning maximizing objective performance criteria, not gaining approval from judges based on aesthetics. The environmental demand to achieve an objective standard has essential implications for broadening body image, as Ginis et al., [36] reported. They found that the idea of muscularity and physical competence in men [37] are central to their evaluations of their bodies.\n\nAccording to Conceptualisation theory, men are socialized to focus more attention on their body functionality than body-as-object (image) [38]. Therefore, powerlifting males are likely to value the functionality of their body over appearance, not only due to socialization processes that favour the achievement of tangible performance-based outcomes [39-40] but also due to the specific environmental demands of powerlifting which reward objective performance results. In contrast, perceptions of leanness and body fat percentage are less relevant to powerlifters performance. Franzoi [38] defined body-as-process as comprising physical capabilities and internal processes, which is similar to body functionality. The demand for functionality adds sources of experience, such as training to execute specific external and internal demands, that requires knowledge of body functionality (movement) and is, therefore, adaptive for how male powerlifters individuals think and feel about their body image [38].\n\nFor example, Richardson and Chen [16] found that female powerlifters, despite presumably having been socialized to experience higher levels of self-objectification and greater body-as-object identification than men, as predicted by self-objectification theory, nevertheless enjoyed their appearance in their sporting environment, indicating that it was not a source of anxiety, presumably due to the enjoyable experience of functional powerlifting training and competition reward. This was evident in other studies using smaller sample sizes and qualitative interviews in the same sport and sex [14 & 41]. Bordo [42] found that individuals who presented with large muscular physiques symbolized strength and masculinity.\n\nCompetition achievement and social reward within a sport based on tangible athletic goals [43-44] and psychological characteristics such as aggression when preparing to lift [45] will strongly mitigate against excessive rumination around body appearance and identity. Further reasoning supports the powerlifting community’s emphasis on body functionality [46-47]. From this perspective, male powerlifters likely develop a functional appreciation of their body that is valued separately from its appearance. This construct of functionality appreciation has only recently been investigated in the context of positive body image. It is positively associated with positive body image facets, such as body appreciation [48].\n\nFranzoi [38] proposed that individuals hold more positive attitudes toward their body functionality than their body image. Therefore, it can be predicted that males with this orientation will hold performance adaptive attitudes toward their bodies. Body conceptualization theory offers a rationale for the body functionality being adaptive and reflective of positive male body image and improved mental health, compared to a body image orientation. This theorizing gives scope that negative body image attitudes can be adaptive and motivational within a performance-based environment based on objective rather than subjective and image-based criteria. For the male powerlifters, this would be the performance their bodies execute to meet the environmental needs (e.g., the sporting demands of their event). For example, Gattario and Frisen [49] found that males stated that finding a social context in which they found belonging and acceptance that allowed them to develop agency and empowerment allowed them to move from a negative to positive body image. With this logic, it could be predicted that competitive powerlifters will differ in their positive body image compared to individuals who are active but don’t compete.\n\nNevertheless, functionality measures have focused predominantly on physical capacities and internal processes and have typically concerned physical strength and muscularity. These aspects of body functionality can be conflated with physical appearance and are accentuated by male appearance ideals and the male gender role emphasizing dominance, power, and strength [50-51]. There has been some research into the body image perceptions of athletes in strength sports. Goltz et al [52] divided 156 male athletes into weight-class sports, endurance sports and aesthetic criteria sports and found no differences in body shape concerning self-depreciation due to physical appearance. Richardson and Chen [16] found no association between negative perceptions of appearance for female powerlifters compared to aesthetic sports individuals. These results suggested that the powerlifting group had contentment with their appearance, perhaps due to the decreased emphasis on body image compared to the increased emphasis on body functionality and focus on improving their skills and strength for their sport.\n\nApart from these few studies, research has yet to be done on body image and functionality in male powerlifting. The association of the physical body with functional sporting competition achievement based on objective standards may reduce the potential for internalizing negative body image and lead to healthy adaptations based on physical demands. This research will explore what functionality means for male powerlifters and how this impacts body image and functionality. This study aims to compare the body image of male powerlifting athletes against other subgroups of male athletic participation. The aim is to examine if male powerlifting athletes express different body image satisfaction or dissatisfaction with their body image and weight compared to subgroups of active and or sporting males.\n\nAim and Objectives of the Study\n\nAim\n\nTo compare the body image differences of male powerlifters against a range of male athletic subgroups.\n\nObjectives\n\n● The first objective was to determine if the powerlifters have significantly lower scores regarding their bodyweight perception when compared to other male groups in the study.\n\n● To determine if powerlifters present an emphasis on body-as-process rather than body-as-object.\n\nMETHODS\n\nParticipant Information\n\nAn opportunity sample of 365 males was recruited through Facebook and Instagram. The recruitment period lasted three weeks in length and generated the following subgroups. There were 133 Powerlifters (P), 79 Active Subjects (AS), 68 Appearance Based Sports (ABS) participants, 47 Strength Sports (SS) participants and finally, 38 Other Sports (OS) participants within their respective subgroups. The group sample means and standard deviations for their age were 28.65 (± 7.44), height was 178.58cm (± 13.3cm), and their weight was recorded at 89.99kg (± 18.20kg).\n\nWithin Table 1.0, each subgroup’s means and standard deviations were recorded for their age, height, weight and the length of time they have spent training. The powerlifting (P) group mean age was 27.71 ± 6.86 years, the mean weight was 92.73kg ± 21.24kg, and the mean height was 176.67 ± 15.27cm. Appearance Based Sports (ABS) group mean age was 28.04 ± 7.59 years, mean weight was 86.89 ± 14.55kg, and height was 177.11 ± 12.32cm. The active Subjects (AS) group’s mean age was 30.30 ± 8.19 years, the mean weight was 84.99 ± 12.81kg, and the mean height was 179.85 ± 14.91cm. The strength Sports (SS) group’s mean age was 29.19 ± 7.26 years, the mean weight was 97.41 ± 20.11kg, and the mean height was 181.69 ± 7.02cm. In the final subgroup Other Sports (OS) group, the mean age was 28.95± 7.49 years, the mean weight was 87.19 ± 15.53kg, and the mean height was 181.47 ± 7.87cm. No ethnic identity data was recorded. The study was conducted after obtaining ethical approval from the Teesside University School of Social Science Business and Law Ethical Approvals Committee.\n\nMeasures\n\nMultidimensional Body Self Relations Questionnaire (MBSRQ): The MBSQR measures Body Image divided into cognitive and behavioral components [53]. Items are ranked on a 1 to 5 Likert scale, where 1 = Definitely disagree, and 5 = Definitely agree. The MSBRQ subscales include Appearance Evaluation (AE), Appearance Orientation (AO), Fitness Evaluation (FE), Fitness Orientation (FO), Health Evaluation (HE), Health Orientation (HO), Illness Orientation (IO), Body Areas Satisfaction (BASS), Overweight Preoccupation (OWP) and Self-Classified Weight (SCW). Illness Orientation is not included as a separate subscale, as it is already reliably accounted for under Health Orientation. The MBSRQ is significantly evidenced in Body Image research [9 & 53] as a well-validated measure [54] through comparison with other tools of Body Image. The MBSRQ has a proven reliability and validity record for body image research [53]. The composite reliability was calculated using an SPSS Omega Macro [55] and is within the acceptable range (Cronbach’s omega = 0.79). The primary author constructed demographic questions to collect information about the participant’ background. These questions included (but were not limited to) sex, age, height, weight, and years spent training.\n\nProcedure\n\nBoth the MSBRQ and Demographic Questionnaire were developed using Google Documents. Data gathered was stored under the General Data Protection Act [56]. Participants were assigned to groups 1.00 (Powerlifters – P), 2.00 (Appearance Based Sports – ABS), 3.00 (Active Subjects – AS), 4.00 (Strength Sports – SS) and 5.00 (Other Sports – OS), based on their answers from the demographic questionnaire. Participants were given no monetary or external incentive to take part. Participants read the pre-questionnaire information, participant information form and questionnaire instructions. Once read, participants were prompted to check a box that confirmed their consent to the study. All participants completed the questionnai"
