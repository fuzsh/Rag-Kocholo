Over the past three games, throughout the Metro Championship and two games at State, Fahy had 11 at-bats, coming away with two singles, four doubles, and four runs. He also took the mound at the end of his last game, earning a save and helping his team move on to the 3A Semifinal game.\n\nLOGAN JOHNSON – Pope John Paul II Track & Field (SR)\n\nSenior Logan Johnson is a dual-sport athlete for the Pope John Paul II Eagles this spring season. The baseball team’s starting center field, Johnson’s primary sport is track and field. Throughout his high school career, he has battled and overcome lots of injury. At the District Championship, Johnson ran a season record in the 800m. He also anchored the 4x400m relay, leading them to a season record and the fastest time they have run in three years. Johnson qualified for state in both events.\n\nKRISTIAN JONES – Tonasket Track & Field (JR)\n\nJunior Kristian Jones, better known in the Tonasket community as KBJ, is an outstanding athlete and student. At the Tigers’ district meet on Thursday, May 16, KBJ placed first in the 400m in a time of 52.81, took second in the 200m in a time of 23.54, and ran the lead leg of his team’s 4x400m relay that finished first in a time of 3:38.15. KBJ is also an excellent student with a cumulative GPA of 3.517.\n\nKENNEDY MARTINSON – Auburn Riverside Fastpitch Softball (SR)\n\nSenior Kennedy Martinson, starting catcher for the Raven fastpitch softball program at Auburn Riverside High School, accounted for four RBIs in her team’s 3A State Championship Title victory over Snohomish this past weekend. Martinson had a run-scoring single in the fifth before driving in three more with a clutch triple in the sixth inning. Fittingly, Martinson, who spent the entire game behind the plate, also recorded the final out, catching a foul pop-up to secure the victory.\n\nQUYN NORBERG – Toldedo Fastpitch Softball (SR)\n\nSenior Quyn Norberg helped lead a very young Toledo Riverhawks team (mostly 8th- and 9th-graders) to a State Ttournament appearance. As captain, she stepped into the roll of catcher this year and was a driving force in the batter’s box as well. At the State Tournament she went 14-for-17 and across four games had a single, double, triple, and a home run. She batted in 10 runs for her team. While Norberg was a great leader on the field, she is also a national honor society member, running start student, and at the top of her class. Her leadership and drive will be greatly missed next year.\n\nJANE ROLOFF – Hoquiam Track & Field (SR)\n\nJane Roloff set seven different meet records during this Track season.

Russell has helped secure 38 shutouts in the past three seasons, helping his squad reach two State Quarterfinal appearances, as well as a Semifinal berth this season. Russell’s tenacious and skilled defensive play helped East Valley win the first round of the State Tournament last week against West Valley, and then he was instrumental in avenging a Quarterfinal loss last year against the defending State Champs, Columbia River, this past Saturday again in the Quarterfinals. He got the scoring started early in the game with a header goal off a corner kick in the 9th minute. Russell leads by example, and, as team captain, has unified his team for this year’s State run into the Final Four! Russell also is an exemplary student with a 4.0 GPA and class Valedictorian. He will be playing soccer at the next level at Eastern Oregon University thisfall.\n\nCLARE TURELLA – Sequim Track & Field (FR)\n\nClare Turella finished her freshman track season last night.

She was Lewis County Dairy Ambassador and Homecoming Queen, has been FFA President for the past two years, shows dairy cows at our local fairs, and has volunteered at our local food banks.\n\nALANNA WIRTALA – Emerald Ridge Fastpitch Softball (JR)\n\nIn the first round of the 4A State Softball Tournament, Emerald Ridge junior Alanna Wirtala threw a perfect game against Moses Lake. Wirtala also had complete-game victories over fifth-ranked Kentwood and top-seeded Skyview, as Emerald Ridge made their first ever appearance in the State Championship game.

Cates finished second in the 100m with a time of 13.65. The Seattle Pacific University Track & Field commit went 17’11.75″” in long jump, which is good for 6th in all of Washington and 1st in 1B.
