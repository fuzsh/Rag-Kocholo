        "text": "Description - Alexandra Orlando: In Pursuit of Victory by Martin Avery\n\nAlexandra Orlando: In Pursuit of Victory, the first book in a new series Celebrating Canadian Athletes by BookLand Press, is the story of the rhythmic gymnast who set a world record by winning six gold medals at the Commonwealth Games 2006 in Melbourne, Australia, and now has her sites set on the 2008 Olympics. Alex The Great, as she is known, has had the Olympic dream since she was seven. She was born with great energy and a desire for recognition, and she discovered a love of competition as soon as she got into the competitive stream of rhythmic gymnastics. Coming from Canada, where her sport is relatively new, Alex has had to overcome incredible odds to join the elite of rhythmic gymnastics internationally. Alexandra Orlando is the reigning Canadian champion, our national champion for the past five years, and the number one rhythmic gymnast in North America. Beautiful and strong, Alex is ready to take on the world. At 21, she is poised to peak just in time for the next Olympics. Could her pursuit of victory lead to an Olympic medal for Canada in Beijing in 2008?\n\nBuy Alexandra Orlando: In Pursuit of Victory by Martin Avery from Australia's Online Independent Bookstore, BooksDirect.\n\nA Preview for this title is currently not available."
