        "text": "By Barry Janoff\n\nFebruary 13, 2018: In 1968, the Green Bay Packers won Super Bowl II, Rowan & Martin’s Laugh-In made its TV debut on NBC, The Beatles formed Apple Records and In the Heat of the Night won the Oscar for Best Picture over Bonnie and Clyde, The Graduate and Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner.\n\nIt also was the year that Special Olympics, under the leadership of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, held its inaugural event, the Summer Special Olympics World Games, which were held July 20-Aug. 3, 1968 in Chicago’s Soldier Field.\n\nIn 2018, Special Olympics will celebrate its 50th anniversary with the prime intent to bolster the urgency for what its has named the “Inclusion Revolution,” with events, special appearances, activation and a multi-platform campaign involving marketing partners, a roster of celebrities and Special Olympics athletes.\n\nThe goal of the Special Olympics 50th Anniversary: “Broaden its purpose to focus on ending discrimination against people with intellectual disabilities worldwide and creating inclusive communities.”\n\nAccording to Special Olympics, “The strategic shift will amplify the impact Special Olympics is making through its programmatic work in sports, health and youth and school engagement to bridge gaps in access and opportunity for a community that comprises 3% of the global population.”\n\n\"For 50 years we have been breaking down barriers and creating solutions for real problems that people with intellectual disabilities face in the areas of isolation, inactivity and injustice,\" Timothy Shriver. Special Olympics chairman (and son of Eunice Kennedy Shriver), said in a statement.\n\n\"We need to accelerate this work in our next 50 years, but also demonstrate how our athletes, people with intellectual disabilities, are teachers of empathy and inclusion.”\n\nAmong the marketing partners involved with 50th anniversary activation are Coca-Cola, Bank of America, Mattel, Microsoft, NFL, P&G, TD Bank, Toyota and Voya.\n\nSpecial Olympics plans to get its message out via multi-media marketing, overseen in-house.\n\nSpots are touting such 50th anniversary events as the Special Olympics USA Games in Seattle (July 1-6 ) and the Special Olympics Unified (Soccer) Cup in Chicago (July 17-21).\n\nSupport includes Internet, social media and national and local activation.\n\nAmong the athletes and celebrities involved with Special Olympics and/or the 50th anniversary marketing and celebration are Andre Drummond (Detroit Pistons), Apolo Anton Ohno (Olympic gold medal speed skater), Brooklyn Decker (actress/model), Damian Lillard (Portland Trail Blazers), Dani Alves (FC Barcelona), Dikembe Mutombo (NBA), Elena Delle Donne (Washington Mystics), Hannah Teter (Olympic gold medal snowboarder), Jamaal Charles (Kansas City Chiefs), Joe Haden (Cleveland Browns), Li Na (tennis champion), Michael Phelps (gold medal swimmer), Nadia Comaneci (gold medal gymnast), Padraig Harrington (champion golfer), Scott Hamilton (gold medal figure skater) and Yao Ming (Basketball Hall of Fame).\n\nThe Special Olympics USA Games in Seattle “will have the largest Unified Sports participation in Special Olympics history.“ Unified Sports pairs athletes with intellectual disabilities and those without on the same team.\n\nSpecial Olympics then returns to Chicago and Soldier Field for the Special Olympics Unified (Soccer) Cup.\n\nThe tournament will feature 24 teams (eight women's teams and 16 men's teams) comprised of people with and without intellectual disabilities from around the globe.\n\nIn addition, on July 20, Special Olympics will “honor its history and celebrate its future” with the dedication and lighting of the Special Olympics Eternal Flame of Hope monument outside Soldier Field, home of the first games. The flame will “symbolize the ongoing mission of inclusion for people with intellectual disabilities.\n\nOn July 21, the first Global Day of Inclusion will be held in Soldier Field.\n\nThe 50th Anniversary celebration will culminate in July 2019 at an event to be unveiled later this year.\n\nSince 1968, Special Olympics said it has grown to include more than 5 million Special Olympics athletes across 172 countries, with 80% participating outside the United States. China and India each have more than 1 million athletes.\n\nHowever, “Despite the success and joy of Special Olympics sports, people with intellectual disabilities still face gross neglect, stigma, and marginalization.”\n\n“The world is a divided place and attitudes of mass destruction are tearing communities apart,” said Shriver. “But we know first-hand how the Special Olympics experience — and our athletes — bring people together in ways that erase the lines of division.\n\n“There is no more urgent time for us to launch an 'Inclusion Revolution' of the heart and mind,\" said Shriver."
