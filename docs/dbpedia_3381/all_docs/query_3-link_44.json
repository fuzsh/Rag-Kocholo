        "text": "ORLANDO, Fla. â After a 10-month investigation dubbed \"Operation Dirty 30s\", State Attorney Andrew Bain's office announced Wednesday that 11 people had been charged in a 37-count indictment as part of a multi-agency operation to break up a local drug operation.\n\nIn a statement, the State Attorney's Office said members of the local \"hybrid gang\" Respect, Money, Structure/Everybody Killer (RMS/EBK), were facing serious felony charges, including racketeering, drug trafficking and first-degree murder caused by unlawful distribution of fentanyl.\n\n\"The gang was selling fentanyl pills disguised to look like prescription 30-milligram Oxycodone pills, hence the operation's name, 'dirty 30s',\" the statement said.\n\nThe investigation into the group â which has been identified as a criminal gang under Florida law â started in September 2023 when an Orlando Police Department detective discussed an open case with a prosecutor in the State Attorney's violent crimes unit and mentioned the possible link to RMS/EBK.\n\n\"They decided to identify the scope of the criminal enterprise and soon learned the (Orange County Sheriff's Office) narcotics unit was also working on an investigation into the gang members,\" the State Attorney's Office statement said. \"The three agencies joined forces to target RMS/EBK and conduct controlled undercover buys. The operation concluded with the indictment on July 31, effectively dismantling the criminal gang.\"\n\nBain said the operation, and ultimately the arrests, put a significant dent into this type of drug trafficking in the county.\n\nâThe grand jury returning a RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations) indictment is significant because RICO laws allow us to dismantle criminal organizations by targeting the individual crimes and the entire structure that supports and perpetuates them,â Bain said in the statement. âWe can hold those directly involved accountable, pursue harsher penalties through sentencing and disrupt the networks fueling these illegal activities that harm our community.\"\n\nBain also praised the cooperation between agencies that made the operation possible in the first place.\n\nâWe could not have secured this indictment without the dedicated, meticulous work of OPDâs drug enforcement division and the OCSO narcotics team,\" he said. \"Their extensive training and experience allowed us to organize the evidence and show the continuity of criminal activity, which is especially important in RICO cases.â\n\nThe alleged distribution of fentanyl by the defendants is believed to have played a direct part in the deaths of Carlos Pena, Noah Polanco and Samuel Fredrick, the State Attorney's Office statement said.\n\nAll 11 defendants are currently in custody.\n\nThe individuals who have been charged and the crimes they are accused of committing are:\n\nCount 1: Murder (Death Caused) by the Unlawful Distribution of
