        "text": "Dallas Davis@ SpreadANDTotalCorrespondent I\n\n100 Sports Nicknames You Can't Forget\n\n0 of 100\n\nI know what you're thinking. There is no way that you can possibly make a list of all of the best nicknames in sports without forgetting a couple.\n\nTruth is, I have many more than 100, but I think you might nod off after 150.\n\nSo I've decided to use my best judgment in selecting 100 of what I consider the greatest nicknames, mostly in American sports.\n\nI'm a fairly recent fan of futbol, or American soccer for those of you who consider it blasphemy to associate our nation's unofficial pastime with a sport that...is actually played with feet. But I digress.\n\nOrder is not important, but I will try to leave the best for last. Honestly, I love the idea of attributing nicknames to our most beloved athletes and I will attempt to do them justice in the following slides. Accompanying each name will be a video and it's my goal to find the most ridiculous clip of each player.\n\nEven after combing my memory, I'm sure there are some that I couldn't remember, so be sure to make me aware in the comments. I shall gladly make a list of the \"100 Forgotten Nicknames.\"\n\nEnjoy!\n\n100. The Babe\n\n1 of 100\n\nOne of the most iconic nicknames in all of sports, \"Babe\"—otherwise known as the \"King of Swing\" or the \"Sultan of Swat\" (thank you, The Sandlot)—is a man of many names.\n\nRuth was also apparently a comedian, from what I can tell. This video is one of the most telling depictions of the difference in gender roles back in the day.\n\nI'd say people were a lot less sensitive back then.\n\nSo here's to \"Babe,\" the most iconic and well-known nickname in the U.S.A.\n\n99. Crime Dog\n\n2 of 100\n\nMaybe this is a reach, but doesn't everyone remember this catchy tune from when you were growing up or had kids growing up?\n\nYouTube tends to agree, because as soon as I typed in \"Scruff McGruff\", \"Chicago, Illinois 60652\" filled itself into the search box. I guess others have this embedded into their subconscious like I do.\n\nWith no research whatsoever, I've concluded that Fred McGriff got the nickname \"Crime Dog\" because his name sounds very similar to McGruff. Seems logical.\n\nThat, and ol' McGruff took \"a bite out of crime\" while McGriff took a couple bites out of various baseballs during a career that involved 500-plus home runs.\n\n98. King James\n\n3 of 100\n\nAlright, everybody just relax. LeBron James is not No. 1 on this list because I honestly don't think his name is iconic...yet.\n\n\"The King\" is certainly a fitting nickname on the morning after a game in which he crowned himself the champion of the league.\n\nDon't remind Akron. So just for all you Ohio natives, here is LeBreezy losing his \"throne,\" if you will, to some dude in Venice Beach.\n\n97.Batman\n\n4 of 100\n\nI first came across this on some message boards and dismissed it as something I didn't understand.\n\nThen I saw a game on the MLB Network and the announcers proved everything I had heard as correct.\n\nHomer Bailey looks like freaking Batman! Well, Christian Bale...which makes him Batman! Now you know why he notched a perfect game last season. But on the negative side, now Bane, Two-Face and Mr. Freeze know where to find him.\n\n96. The Iceman\n\n5 of 100\n\nI didn't realize so many people have used this nickname, including some psychotic mafia hitman.\n\nI immediately think of Chuck Liddell, but apparently this ageless wonder has been given to George Gervin, Adam Vinatieri and Val Kilmer.\n\nGo figure.\n\nI'm not sure how you feel about it, but I reserve \"The Iceman\" for Chuck Liddell because, when he's randomly with you and you're drinking Miller Light, he can allegedly get you front-row tickets.\n\n95. Silverback\n\n6 of 100\n\nI've heard this before, and to be honest, it's a little dicey if you think of our current state of culture. Truth be told, it's a nickname James Harrison has embraced. So that being said, let's watch the \"Silverback\" lay people out.\n\nOK, scratch that, this song is freakin' terrible! I just wanted proof that someone else out there mentions him as the \"Silverback.\"\n\nColt McCoy is still laying on the turf somewhere.\n\n94. JET\n\n7 of 100\n\nJason \"JET\" Terry was officially grounded recently. This might be a nickname that will fade away, but it's kind of funny to see him act like an airplane running down the court after he hits a three-pointer.\n\nI want to say that NBA talking head and Kenny Smith was also \"The Jet,\" but Jason Terry lives up to it.\n\n93. Johnny Football\n\n8 of 100\n\n\"Johnny Football.\" What an awesome nickname for such a talented kid.\n\nBut I'm confused, because it would seem as if these other guys in the video are the best ever at making ridiculous shots.\n\nThat, and I feel like I'm at a nightclub at 2 a.m. while I watch it.\n\n\"Johnny Football\" Manziel is a myth right now in the college football world. In the next slide, we will look at the person who, in my humble opinion, paved the way for this nickname.\n\nNote: OK, there is no way the shots in this video are real. That's impossible, right?\n\n92. Teddy Ballgame\n\n9 of 100\n\n\"Teddy Ballgame,\" one of my personal favorites for a nickname, was coined after Ted Williams, who is the shining example of what a baseball player embodies.\n\nBut let's get to the real story. The man with the golden voice....his name is Ted Williams. Therefore, apparently he is \"Teddy Ballgame\" as well.\n\nAwesome, but beware of going on a YouTube spree whereby you keep clicking suggested videos. Turns out he got famous and went right back to rehab. Tragic.\n\n91. Chipper\n\n10 of 100\n\nAm I the only one that loves baseball commercials?\n\nTwo things happened to me while watching this commercial. First, now I know that the video with \"Johnny Football\" was ridiculously fake. Second, I feel very gullible.\n\nAnyway, \"Chipper\" Jones, otherwise known as Larry Wayne Jones Jr., is an icon around the Atlanta and surrounding Georgia areas.\n\nBut we only know him as \"Chipper.\"\n\n90. The Reign Man\n\n11 of 100\n\nHis shoes were hideous, but who am I kidding? I owned at least a couple different versions.\n\nShawn Kemp, better known as \"The Reign Man\", was an absolute beast for the Seattle SuperSonics. He was overshadowed by several players during his years, but with Jordan in the mix, it's kind of hard to be noticed like you should.\n\n89. Air Jordan\n\n12 of 100\n\nThe \"Jumpman,\" \"MJ,\" \"The G.O.A.T.\"\n\nHe's known around the world from the name on his jersey, to the emblem on his clothing line. If another player shows brilliance, he is eventually the ultimate comparison.\n\nOther than Magic Johnson, I think Michael Jordan is one of the few to ever retire, come back and be just as good, if not better.\n\n\"Air Jordan\" makes the list because that is what everyone reffered to his shoes as. Eventually, it stuck once he dunked from the free-throw line.\n\n88. The Mailman\n\n13 of 100\n\nStockton to Malone, something that marked some of the first memories of my basketball-watching life.\n\nKarl Malone was known for delivering in the post, but I found some evidence that he also delivered elbows—in this case to Jordan's nose.\n\nI have a nickname for Jeff Hornacek also, but it's probably only something a middle schooler would think is funny.\n\n87. Dr. J\n\n14 of 100\n\nLegend has it that his original nickname, which was coined before he went to UMASS to play college ball, was somewhat as a joke. Him and his friend, \"the professor\", started it off as a joke and it transformed into one of the most recognizable nicknames of all time.\n\nSoon after \"Dr. J\" was born, so too was a new style of play that a lot of current NBA players can credit Julius Erving for starting.\n\n86. The Rifleman\n\n15 of 100\n\nChuck Person was known for his three-point shot, hence some referring to him as \"The Rifleman.\"\n\nIn his interview, he explains that he took the three-pointer because he didn't want to go to overtime. It's all or nothing for Chuck.\n\n85. Boomer\n\n16 of 100\n\nNorman Julius Esiason. Bet you didn't know that was his real name. Similar to \"Chipper\" Jones, we've adopted his new tag of \"Boomer,\" which has become entrenched in the sporting world thanks in part to his Super Bowl runs.\n\nNow he does color commentary for the NFL. He's been around the game since 1984.\n\n84. Big Ben\n\n17 of 100\n\n\"Big Ben\" Roethlisberger, who is seen with Shaq in this video, is known for his goofiness, among other less-perfect things.\n\nI actually saw him play golf at a celebrity tournament and he's surprisingly good.\n\n83. Tom Terrific\n\n18 of 100\n\n\"Golden Boy,\" \"California Cool,\" \"Lord Brady.\" Tom Brady has a plethora of nicknames among his Patriot faithful, but all that really matters is that he will go down in history as one of the best quarterbacks of all time.\n\nAnd with wife Gisele Bundchen by his side, it would appear that his life is pretty terrible.\n\n82. Revis Island\n\n19 of 100\n\nDarrelle Revis was a hot commodity this offseason and it will be interesting to see if he can relocate \"Revis Island\" down to Florida, where he will be relied upon to add to Tampa Bay's winning ways.\n\n81. CP3\n\n20 of 100\n\nSo, if Chris Paul gets traded again and someone doesn't want to give up their No. 3 jersey, \"CP3\" will be fishing for a new nickname.\n\nMaybe \"Cliff\" will emerge as the front-runner in such a situation.\n\n80. Boom Dizzle\n\n21 of 100\n\nI'm not making this up, as I'm sure some of you are thinking. Baron Davis was also known as \"B-Diddy\" to those of us that grew up in the Bay Area.\n\nI will forever remember his dunk on \"AK-47\" (Andrei Kirilenko, who didn't make the list because I was planning on mentioning him in this slide).\n\n79. Money\n\n22 of 100\n\nThe definition of polarizing. Floyd \"Money\" Mayweather makes sure he gets his point across, whether it's to a sports commentator or his opponent.\n\n78. The Golden Boy\n\n23 of 100\n\nSince we are on a boxing note, we can't leave out \"The Golden Boy\" himself, Oscar De La Hoya. However, he's not the only person to grace himself with that nickname.\n\n77. The Cuban Missle\n\n24 of 100\n\nThe former winner of this nickname was Alexei Ramirez, but with his disappearance and relatively short stay, it's time to pass the torch.\n\nOf the options remaining, I believe it's between Aroldis Chapman of the Cincinnati Reds and Yoenis Cespedes of the Oakland Athletics.\n\nOne hits like a missile, while the other slings 100 mph missiles. Both are worthy, but for the sake of me being an Oakland homer, I'm going to side with hitting homers as the determining factor in who is known as \"The Cuban Missile.\"\n\n76. T-Sizzle\n\n25 of 100\n\nTerrell Suggs has had his share of arguments with ESPN's Skip Bayless and this is one of those moments. Overall, he's a pretty scary guy on the field, so \"T-Sizzle\" can call himself whatever the heck he wants.\n\nBall So Hard University is excepting applications.\n\n75. T-Plush\n\n26 of 100\n\nIf you have a moment and you've never heard the comedic stylings of \"Tony Plush,\" then you should probably go on a nice little YouTube spree.\n\nJust the way he talks is funny enough and I wish we had more of him in the league today. Nyjer Morgan is currently playing over in Japan.\n\n74. The Big Ticket\n\n27 of 100\n\nIn my opinion, \"The Big Ticket\" is famous for two things in his career.\n\nFirst, he blocks every shot after the whistle in every game that I've seen. He literally never takes a timeout off.\n\nSecond, he will forever be remembered for his post-NBA Finals interview during which he screamed \"Anything is possible!!\"\n\nKevin Garnett went from good to legendary because of that.\n\n73. The Truth\n\n28 of 100\n\nDo you sense a pattern? I tend to go on runs with teammates, sports and overall relevance of one person to another.\n\n\"The Big Ticket\" has a counterpart in \"The Truth\", Paul Pierce.\n\n72. Sid the Kid\n\n29 of 100\n\nWhen something rhymes with your name and describes something that is relevant, it is what I like to call an instant classic.\n\nSidney Crosby will be a kid forever.\n\n71. The Admiral\n\n30 of 100\n\nDavid Robinson got his nickname from serving in the US Navy.\n\nHe and Tim Duncan combined were known as \"The Twin Towers\" and they propelled the Spurs to the playoffs just about every single year they were together.\n\n70. The Rocket\n\n31 of 100\n\nI decided to attach a historical moment to Roger Clemens' slide because we all know about the other stuff.\n\nTo me, the most memorable moment in his career was when he launched pieces of a broken bat at Mike Piazza as he lined out.\n\n69. Cro Cop\n\n32 of 100\n\nWait, that's not his name? Turns out it's Mirko Filipovic.\n\nI literally didn't know that until I looked it up, but it makes sense. \"Cro Cop\" would be a weird name indeed.\n\n68. My Bironas\n\n33 of 100\n\nCoined by Chris Berman—to the best of my knowledge—\"My Bironas\" is not quite a nickname as much as a parody of a song that is for some reason hilarious.\n\nThis guy behind this video took it pretty seriously.\n\nRob Bironas has been winning fantasy football weeks at breakneck speed.\n\n67. The Real Deal\n\n34 of 100\n\nNo surprise here, as boxers and MMA fighters almost always have a nickname—or 20.\n\nEvander \"Real Deal\" Holyfield is one that will go down in history.\n\n66. Saint Patrick\n\n35 of 100\n\nI've only heard this once or twice, so I don't know how credible this is, but Patrick Roy is one of the best goalies of all time and I will give some credence to rumors of his nickname being \"Saint Patrick.\"\n\n65. The Law Firm\n\n36 of 100\n\nBenJarvus Green-Ellis just sounds like a law firm.\n\nThese guys in the video seem to think they provide pretty bad customer service.\n\n64. The Matrix\n\n37 of 100\n\nShawn Marion gets an awesome nickname as a guy that can pretty much do it all.\n\n63. Big Papi\n\n38 of 100\n\n\"Big Papi\" is so fitting for David Ortiz. It's almost too perfect.\n\n62. White Chocolate\n\n39 of 100\n\nJason Williams, where do I start?\n\nHelping white kids across the country break out of their shell and start throwing passes between their legs, off their elbows and the infamous fake-behind-the-back layup.\n\nA lot of what he did was taken out of the pages of Dr. J, but it was unexpected to see him be such a brilliant player from the start.\n\nI enjoyed watching him play growing up and I'm sure Sacramento remembers the days of \"White Chocolate.\"\n\n61. The Grandy-Man\n\n40 of 100\n\nJohn Sterling could probably choose from a list of nicknames for Curtis Granderson that would blow this one out of the water, but he was up to his normal antics with this nickname as well.\n\n60. The Flying Tomato\n\n41 of 100\n\nRed hair, flies through the air.\n\nYep, \"The Flying Tomato\" works just fine for Shaun White.\n\n59. The Freak\n\n42 of 100\n\n\"The Freak\", \"The Franchise,\" \"Big Time Timmy Jim,\" these are all aliases of Tim Lincecum, who hit the scene hard as a rookie.\n\nIt would seem that hitters are finally catching on to his stuff, as he's been knocked around pretty good.\n\nRegardless, he's still \"The Freak.\"\n\n58. Rampage\n\n43 of 100\n\nTerribly awkward video to watch, but I think we've all seen the one where he destroys a door, so I went with the one you might not have seen.\n\nQuinton \"Rampage\" Jackson is yet another MMA fighter with the necessary nickname. It fits him quite well.\n\n57. Big Mac\n\n44 of 100\n\nChicks dig the long ball, that's for sure.\n\nIn one of the more iconic commercials in baseball history, you can't forget that it's Mark \"Big Mac\" McGwire making them look bad.\n\nThe unofficial record-breaking career is overlooked because of steroid use, but his pairing with Jose Canseco on those A's teams of the '80s was a sight to see.\n\n56. El Duque\n\n45 of 100\n\nPossibly one of the best commercials ever.\n\nJust when you thought you forgot about Orlando \"El Duque\" Hernandez, you realize that David Cone used to be relevant and on the Yankees.\n\n\"El Duque\" mania swept across the country because of the high leg kick, similar to the weird delivery of Hideo Nomo that attracted attention.\n\n55. Junior\n\n46 of 100\n\nOne of my favorite players, Ken Griffey Jr. was known simply as \"Junior.\"\n\nI wonder how many hundreds of times I've imitated his batting stance and the way he shook his bat before a pitch.\n\n54. Pistol Pete\n\n47 of 100\n\nYou can definitely make the argument that Pete Maravich was the lighter-skinned version of Dr. J and the inspiration for Jason \"White Chocolate\" Williams years later.\n\n53. Ovie\n\n48 of 100\n\nThroughout the scouring process, I tried to leave off nicknames that consist of shortening the last name or just using the first initial and portions of the last name, such as \"K-Rod\" or \"D-Will.\"\n\nHowever, in some instances, I felt as if they are so well-known that they must be included.\n\nA good example of this is \"Ovie\" and a better example of why Alexander Ovechkin belongs on this list is the sheer genius of his commercial spot.\n\n52. The Praying Mantis\n\n49 of 100\n\nOK, this is totally made-up, but doesn't Lil Wayne kind of look like a praying mantis?\n\nThought so. Now let's watch him berate the Miami Heat and Chris Bosh's wife.\n\n51. Gronk\n\n50 of 100\n\n\"Yo soy fiesta.\"\n\nFollowed by that laugh? Instant classic courtesy of Rob Gronkowski.\n\n50. Cutch\n\n51 of 100\n\nOne of the few shortened names that I think deserves to be on this list is that of Andrew McCutchen, especially because \"Cutch\" and \"Gronk\" are rarer than most of the others.\n\n49. Panda\n\n52 of 100\n\n\"Panda,\" or \"Kung Fu Panda,\" is known for being a goofy guy.\n\nHere, Pablo Sandoval is channeling his inner Pedro Cerrano from Major League.\n\n48. Birdman\n\n53 of 100\n\nNot a huge fan of Chris Andersen, but since his re-emergence in the NBA playoffs, we have to give his nickname some credit.\n\nIt's stuck for quite some time and people seem to love it.\n\n47 .Mr. October\n\n54 of 100\n\nNot just a great Yankee moment, this man provided us with one of the best moments in sports history when he belted three bombs in Game 6 of the World Series.\n\nReggie Jackson will always be \"Mr. October.\"\n\n46. Joey Bats\n\n55 of 100\n\n\"Joey Bats,\" Jose Bautista's nickname, does sound like it belongs to a mobster.\n\n45. Ochocinco\n\n56 of 100\n\nI considered putting his altered nickname, \"Oucho-Stinko.\"\n\nHowever, Chad Johnson's nickname got a lot of attention. It always bothered me that it's not even the correct way to say \"85\" in Spanish. I'm pretty sure it's \"ochenta y cinco.\"\n\n44. Chuck\n\n57 of 100\n\nWithout Charles \"The Round Mound of Rebound\" Barkley on the panel, I'm not sure anyone would watch NBA on TNT's halftime show.\n\n43. Mad Dog\n\n58 of 100\n\nCan we all just take a moment and watch the greatest rally speech after a victorious NBA Finals campaign?\n\nMark Madsen nailed it. Probably should have consulted with \"Mad Dog\" about your Spanish, Ochocinco.\n\n42. My Giant\n\n59 of 100\n\nI feel kind of bad putting this in here because I don't think it was ever actually a real nickname, but most people remember George Muresan for his role in the blockbuster, My Giant, with Billy Crystal.\n\n41. Joe Pa\n\n60 of 100\n\nMarred with controversy, Joe Paterno will still go down as one of the best of all time.\n\nIn this specific clip, I think what they are saying is that...well, you get the idea.\n\n40. Eck\n\n61 of 100\n\nAn icon in the Bay Area, Dennis \"Eck\" Eckersley is known for his shaggy appearance and unique name.\n\n39. The Yankee Clipper\n\n62 of 100\n\nIn tribute to Joe DiMaggio, this is probably one of the best songs about a player of all time!\n\n38. The Polish Rifle\n\n63 of 100\n\nLet's all take a moment and remember the XFL.\n\nOK, that was quick.\n\nThe San Francisco Demons had a guy named Mike Pawlawski and he was \"The Polish Rifle.\" I honestly just wanted to bring up the XFL because ESPN analyst Ron Jaworski, or \"Jaws,\" is also known by this nickname.\n\nApparently there's more than one Polish rifle!\n\n37. He Hate Me\n\n64 of 100\n\nRod Smart went on to be pretty good in the NFL.\n\nA lot of his publicity came from his nickname, \"He Hate Me.\" Not the greatest sentence grammar-wise, but maybe that's why it stuck.\n\n36. Sam I Am\n\n65 of 100\n\nSam Cassell took his famous dance from Major League's Pedro Cerrano. I am aware that is the second time we are referencing a Charlie Sheen movie.\n\n35. All Day\n\n66 of 100\n\n34. The Tasmanian Devil\n\n67 of 100\n\nI've heard of this nickname a couple of times and I think it fits Troy Polamalu perfectly.\n\n33. The Glove\n\n68 of 100\n\n\"The Glove\" was coined because of Gary Payton's lockdown defense.\n\n32. Dr. Dunkenstein\n\n69 of 100\n\nDarrell Griffith's nickname, \"Dr. Dunkenstein,\" got a lot of play in the media, as it was quite the indication of what kind of player you were about to see.\n\n31. MJD\n\n70 of 100\n\nSome people just sound cooler when their initials flow together like those of \"MJD.\" Probably because we are conditioned to attribute \"MJ\" with greatness.\n\n30. Linsanity\n\n71 of 100\n\n\"Linsanity\" swept the nation in its madness. It's not just a nickname, it's something that created such a buzz that Jeremy Lin was forced into an alter ego.\n\n29. The Human Torch\n\n72 of 100\n\nIt's possible that many of you may not recognize this one, but I assure you that local coverage often refers to Stephen Curry as \"The Human Torch.\"\n\nHe and Klay Thompson are also known as the \"Splash Brothers\"—like the \"Bash Brothers\" in Oakland.\n\n28. The Human Highlight Reel\n\n73 of 100\n\n\"The Human Highlight Reel\" and \"The Human Highlight Film\" refer to the slammer-jammer himself, Mr. Dominique Wilkins.\n\n27. Shaq Diesel\n\n74 of 100\n\nShaquille O'Neal has so many nicknames that it's not even worth listing them all, but one that I've always liked is \"Shaq Diesel.\"\n\nApparently, he made this song after Kobe lost in the NBA Finals and there were rumors that Bryant played a part in Shaq's divorce.\n\n26.The Big Fundamental\n\n75 of 100\n\nOh, the irony!\n\nTim Duncan, the bank shot legend, wasn't very fundamental on this trip up the court.\n\n25. Run DMC\n\n76 of 100\n\nJust another one of those nicknames where it's a play on words in three ways.\n\nDarren McFadden is a running back, his initials are DMC and when you put it all together, it's a legendary rap group. Perfect.\n\n24. The Kandi Man\n\n77 of 100\n\nRemember Michael Olowokandi? This was probably the most notable thing he did in his short NBA career.\n\n23. Tiger\n\n78 of 100\n\nYou can't really have a better nickname than \"Tiger.\" It's completely entrenched in the golf world and isn't going anywhere because it's basically replaced his first name, Eldrick.\n\n22. Matty Ice\n\n79 of 100\n\nSomething tells me Matt Ryan got his nickname from a frat house.\n\n21. Megatron\n\n80 of 100\n\nWelp, Calvin Johnson looks like a freakin' transformer and he's gigantic, so I see no reason for \"Megatron\" not to be a perfect fit.\n\n20. Black Mamba\n\n81 of 100\n\nOne of the deadliest snakes on the planet, Kobe Bryant got his nickname with several buzzer-beater shots over his illustrious career.\n\n19. Broadway Joe\n\n82 of 100\n\nLadies and gentlemen, Joe Namath. Wasted on live television.\n\n18. The Big Hurt\n\n83 of 100\n\nI remember this one vividly, but only upon looking through some videos did I remember that he was twice an MVP.\n\nPretty impressive for Frank Thomas.\n\n17. Bash Brothers\n\n84 of 100\n\nThe \"Bash Brothers\" consisted of Jose Canseco and \"Big Mac.\"\n\nBut it was far more entertaining in The Mighty Ducks, especially when they reunited.\n\n16. A-Roid\n\n85 of 100\n\nI honestly had my thoughts on whether we should put Alex Rodriguez's altered nickname on here, but once the reporter said it on the air, it became media gold.\n\n15. Refrigerator Perry\n\n86 of 100\n\nNot often do you get a nickname from something that you're as big as. Not only was William Perry bigger than the fridge, he probably could clean it out in no time.\n\n14. The Bus\n\n87 of 100\n\nWearing yellow, running dull speed, with some black pants...yeah, that pretty much looks like a bus.\n\nIt's fun to watch Jerome Bettis get all cheesy in this Super Bowl ad.\n\n13. Charlie Hustle\n\n88 of 100\n\nDang, Pete Rose went off!\n\nIf it happened today, I can only imagine the type of fines and punishment handed out. It's also ironic that \"Charlie Hustle\" got busted for gambling.\n\n12. The Toddfather\n\n89 of 100\n\nWhether you're attributing the nickname to Todd Frazier or Todd Helton, it's still an awesome nickname.\n\n11. Magic\n\n90 of 100\n\nSimilar to \"Tiger,\" \"Magic\" completely manifested itself as Earvin Johnson's first name.\n\nCan't really get much cooler than that.\n\n10. Big Baby\n\n91 of 100\n\n\"Living up to that nickname,\" said SportsCentre's Dan O'Toole in reference to Glen Davis.\n\nPriceless.\n\n9. Shoeless Joe\n\n92 of 100\n\nMaybe \"Shoeless Joe\" Jackson is Denard Robinson's hero.\n\n8. Muscle Hamster\n\n93 of 100\n\nHe secretly hates this nickname, but Doug Martin is a very powerful running back.\n\nHere he is appealing to ESPN's SportsNation for a new sobriquet.\n\n7. Iron Mike\n\n94 of 100\n\n\"Iron Mike,\" one of the most classic nicknames of all time. Kind of like how Mike Tyson Punch-Out!! was one of the best video games of all time.\n\n6. Honey Badger\n\n95 of 100\n\nThe video itself gets a lot of credit, but the man that embodies the nickname was on the path for success until some run-ins with the law and the team code got him into some trouble.\n\n5. The Great One\n\n96 of 100\n\nIt's weird because the first thing I think about when seeing this nickname is The Rock.\n\nHowever, Wayne Gretzky is indeed \"The Great One.\"\n\n4. The Glide\n\n97 of 100\n\nI love this nickname and Clyde Drexler was one hell of a player.\n\n3. The Answer\n\n98 of 100\n\nNow, if only someone would adopt the nickname \"The Question.\" In my opinion, \"The Answer\" is one of the best nicknames in sports.\n\n2. The Nigerian Nightmare\n\n99 of 100\n\nWhat is not to love about Christian Okoye and his cultural nickname?\n\n\"The Nigerian Nightmare\" pretty much explains everything in one little phrase.\n\n1. The Big Unit\n\n100 of 100\n\n\"The Big Unit,\" aka Randy Johnson.\n\nBest. Nickname. Ever.\n\nX"
