        "text": "Governance\n\nThe Geneva School has defined three boards that provide leadership and support to the school in complementary ways: a Board of Governors (see below), a Board of Reference, and an Advisory Board.\n\nThe BOARD OF GOVERNORS has ultimate accountability for ensuring that the mission, vision, and values on which the school was founded are progressively fulfilled and realized in all areas of school life. The members of this board are responsible for hiring a suitably qualified head of school and empowering him (or her) to direct the operation of the school in accordance with these founding principles. Working primarily through its constituent committees, it also oversees corporate governance and finances and provides leadership for major projects that support the school vision.\n\nJohn Riley\n\nChairman\n\nJohn Riley has served on The Geneva School Board of Governors since 2003 and currently serves as board chair.
