The athlete must show the tester their bathroom on video to show no one else is present, fill the provided container with urine off camera, and then use the provided temperature strip to show that the sample is fresh on camera. The athlete will then press a small device into their bicep to take a blood sample on camera. Both the urine and blood samples are sealed on camera and shipped to the USADA for testing.

As a a result officials concluded medals would not be awarded for a completed event for the first time in Olympic history. The team as a whole, however, was not disqualified and the Olympic committee adjusted the points so that United States has now won gold, Japan silver, and Russia bronze. The four-year ban is retroactive to the date of the sample, Dec. 25, 2021, so Valieva may compete in the 2026 Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo Winter Olympics. All of her wins from since the sample are void.\n\nAyana Archie, \"The Olympics Will Begin Awarding Medals to Runner-Ups after the Kamila Valieva Ban,\" npr.org, Jan, 30, 2024\n\nNardos Haile, \"Russian Figure Skater Kamila Valieva Receives Four-Year Doping Ban from Court,\" salon.com, Jan. 29, 2024\n\nTariq Panja and Andrew Das, \"Russian Skaters Stripped of Olympic Gold but Will Still Get the Bronze,\" nytimes.com, Jan. 30, 2024"
