Veterans may be entitled to 5 or 10 points included in any scoring process for examination or interviews.\n\n5-point Hiring Preference: Five points are added to the examination score or rating of a Veteran who served:\n\nDuring a war, or\n\nDuring the period April 28, 1952, through July 1, 1955, or\n\nFor more than 180 consecutive days, other than for training, any part of which occurred after January 31, 1955, and before October 15, 1976, or\n\nDuring the Gulf War from August 2, 1990, through January 2, 1992, or\n\nFor more than 180 consecutive days, other than for training, any part of which occurred during the period beginning September 11, 2001, and ending on August 31, 2010, the last day of Operation Iraqi Freedom, or\n\nIn a campaign or expedition for which a campaign medal has been authorized.

Both a mother and a spouse (including surviving spouse) may be entitled to preference based on the same Veteran's service if they both meet the requirements. However, neither may receive preference if the Veteran is living and is qualified for Federal employment.\n\nTen points are added to the passing examination score or rating of the spouse of a disabled Veteran who is disqualified for a federal position along the general lines of their usual occupation because of a service-connected disability. Such a disqualification may be presumed when the Veteran is unemployed and:\n\nIs rated by appropriate military or VA authorities to be 100% disabled and/or unemployable, or\n\nHas retired, been separated, or resigned from a civil service position because of a disability that is service-connected in origin, or\n\nHas attempted to obtain a civil service position or other position along the lines of their usual occupation and has failed to qualify because of a service-connected disability\n\nPreference may be allowed in other circumstances but anything less than the above warrants a more careful analysis.\n\nA campaign medal holder or Gulf War Veteran who originally enlisted after September 7, 1980, (or began active duty on or after October 14, 1982, and has not previously completed 24 months of continuous active duty) must have served continuously for 24 months or the full period called or ordered to active duty.

Service members recovering from injuries received during service or training may have up to two years from the date of completion of service to return to their jobs or apply for reemployment.\n\nReturn to Work without Loss of Seniority: USERRA provides that returning service members are reemployed in the job that they would have attained had they not been absent for military service, with the same seniority, status and pay, as well as other rights and benefits determined by seniority. USERRA also requires that reasonable efforts (such as training or retraining) be made to enable returning service members to refresh or upgrade their skills to help them qualify for reemployment. USERRA also provides that while an individual is performing military service, they are deemed to be on a furlough or leave of absence and are entitled to the non-seniority rights accorded other individuals on non-military leaves of absence.\n\nExtension of Health and Pension Plans: Health and pension plan coverage for service members is provided for by USERRA. Individuals performing military duty of more than 30 days may elect to continue employer sponsored health care for up to 24 months; however, they may be required to pay up to102% of the full premium.
