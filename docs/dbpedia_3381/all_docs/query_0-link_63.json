We sought to develop a machine learning (ML) classifier of PD versus healthy controls using spectral power derived from sleep electroencephalography (EEG).\n\nDesign: A retrospective cohort study using a large database of polysomnography data linked to clinical diagnoses was conducted.\n\nResults: Frontal, central, and occipital EEG polysomnography channels from 49 patients who received a diagnosis of PD and 2,880 controls were used to calculate absolute spectral power in the delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands. An L1-regularized logistic regression model was trained with EEG spectral power as input to discriminate between controls and participants with PD. Model results demonstrated two populations, with subjects younger than 50 years of age poorly separating from age-matched controls. The model demonstrated an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.75 for all subjects and 0.89 for subjects over the age of 65 years.\n\nConclusion: A model using only sleep EEG power spectral features was able to distinguish older patients with PD from age-matched controls. Model performance was age dependent, with poor discriminative power for younger (age <50 years) patients. These findings could be explained by a disease-specific effect on EEG spectral power, exacerbated with disease duration or severity. Future analyses will be required to examine treatment effects and the utility of combining spectral power with measures of rapid eye movement (REM) without atonia (known to be predictive of PD).\n\nFunding/financial disclosures: Beacon Biosignals is a commercial entity focused on analysis of time series neurophysiological data and the development of neurophysiological biomarkers.\n\nCharacterizing Disease Progression in Multiple Sclerosis Subtypes Using RWD: Feasibility of Applying a Machine Learning Model to Address Missing Data\n\nAuthors: Pedro Alves, Zachary Bryant, Michelle Leavy, Gary Curhan, Costas Boussios, Carl D. Marci\n\nBackground/Objective: The Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS) is a validated, clinician-administered scale for measuring disability in multiple sclerosis (MS) that is widely used in clinical trials but recorded inconsistently in real-world data (RWD) sources. A machine learning model was developed to estimate EDSS scores at discrete time points using routinely recorded, unstructured clinical notes from neurologists and applied RWD in patients with MS with very good performance.1 The objective was to assess the feasibility of using this model to reduce the number of missing scores for EDSS to support the characterization of disability progression in patients with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) who are transitioning to secondary progressive MS (SPMS).\n\nDesign: The model was applied to the OM1 MS PremiOM Dataset, a RWD source containing deidentified, deterministically linked clinical and administrative data from 2013 to 2021 on over 17,000 patients with MS managed by neurologists in the United States (US). Patients with RRMS and SPMS who had a clinician-administered or estimated EDSS score were included in the analytic cohort.\n\nResults: The cohort included 4,366 patients; 3,568 had RRMS, 556 had SPMS, and 242 were transitioning from RRMS to SPMS. Patients in the RRMS subgroup were younger than patients in the other groups, while sex and race were similar across the subgroups. A total of 3,404 clinician-administered EDSS scores were documented. Application of the model resulted in an additional 46,644 estimated EDSS scores available for analysis, allowing for a more complete description of disability by age in patients with RRMS and SPMS.\n\nConclusion: Application of this model to estimate EDSS scores in a RWD source increases the number of patients available for studies of disease progression and outcomes, thereby improving the utility of RWD sources for MS research and informing the understanding of disability during the transition from RRMS to SPMS.\n\nFunding/financial disclosures: Not provided.\n\nReference:\n\nAlves P, Green E, Leavy M, et al.

Nunes, Ilkay Yildiz Potter, Ram Kinker Mishra, Ashkan Vaziri\n\nAffiliations: BioSensics LLC, Newton, MA.\n\nBackground/Objective: Goal-directed movements (GDMs) reflect the ability to execute planned motor commands with hand trajectories toward specific target locations. Our objective was to develop a deep learning model to automatically detect GDMs from accelerometer activity captured by a wearable device and test its sensitivity in classifying subjects with stroke.\n\nDesign: Thirty participants were recruited for the study, 20 stroke survivors (average age: 54.4 years) and 10 control participants (average age: 53.8 years). Participants wore six-axis inertial measurement units (IMUs) on each wrist and performed a series of activities of daily living. The dataset comprised of 49,254 time windows.\n\nA deep learning model (XCM) was trained to classify GDM or non-GDM from accelerometer and velocity data. Leave-one-subject-out cross-validation was used to test the models’ performance. To further probe the utility of GDMs, we trained one model using features from GDM periods and another using the whole recording and tested which one could better classify stroke and control participants.\n\nResults: The GDM classification model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.90, sensitivity of 0.81, specificity of 0.84, and F1 of 0.82. The model trained with GDM features achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.9, sensitivity of 1, and specificity of 0.8, outperforming the equivalent model trained on features extracted from the entire recording (accuracy: 0.75, sensitivity: 1, specificity: 0.5).\n\nConclusion: Our findings suggest that our deep learning model holds significant potential for real-world application in stroke rehabilitation and monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases. The ability to identify stroke survivors and quantify stroke severity based on GDM features further underscores the clinical relevance of this work.\n\nFunding/financial disclosures: Research reported in this publication was supported by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number R44HD084035.

However, documentation of the PHQ-9 is inconsistent in real-world data (RWD) sources, such as electronic medical records (EMRs), which limits the potential role of these data sources for supporting research studies.\n\nDesign: A machine learning (ML) model was developed to generate estimated PHQ-9 (ePHQ-9) scores using clinical notes from visits with mental health professionals. Data were drawn from the OM1 PremiOM Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) Dataset, a RWD source containing data on over 490,000 patients with MDD. Patients with both recorded PHQ-9 scores and clinical notes were identified and randomly assigned to a training cohort to train a validation cohort. Notes were transformed via medical language processing. To assess model performance, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated using a binarized version of the outcome, and continuous ePHQ-9 scores were evaluated using Spearman R and Pearson R values.\n\nResults: The model had an AUC of 0.81, Spearman R value of 0.62, and Pearson R value of 0.61. The model resulted in the generation of new ePHQ-9 scores for 2,215,662 (2.7x enrichment over 814,166 recorded PHQ-9 scores) encounters for 208,692 (1.2x enrichment over 174,897 patients with a PHQ-9 score) distinct patients.\n\nConclusion: At the individual patient level, use of the ML model could provide a more complete view of a patient’s depressive symptom severity and response to treatment over time. At the population level, application of the model to RWD sources could increase the number of patients and encounters available for research on depression treatment and outcomes.\n\nFunding/financial disclosures: Not provided.\n\nMachine Learning-supported Shapelet-classification of Event-related Potentials Yields Novel Biomarkers for MCI/AD\n\nAuthors: Michael Lagler,1 Georg Dorffner1,2\n\nAffiliations: 1The Siesta Group, Vienna, Austria; 2Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Center for Medical Data Science, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.\n\nBackground/Objective: Objective measures of brain activity in the cognitively loaded state are described as event-related potentials (ERPs) and have since been established as quantitative biomarkers for tracking disease conditions associated with cognitive deficiencies. However, standard ERP metrics (amplitude, latency) are very susceptible to low signal-to-noise-ratio typical to single subject recordings, and mitigation strategies, such as filtering or a priori definitions of time windows and amplitude ranges, impose unwanted constraints and subjective biases. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore machine learning (ML)-supported waveform classification techniques as novel tools facilitating the discovery of ERP-based biomarkers for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD).\n\nDesign: We analyzed data from 20 patients with MCI/AD and 20 healthy controls, recorded with the standard 10–20 system while performing an auditory oddball task. Waveform classification was based on identifying ERP subsequences with contrasting presence among data classes, called shapelets. Supervised learning of shapelets optimized linear separation of ERP waveforms in the shapelet-transformed space.\n\nResults: For ERPs from patients with MCI/AD, we found that shapelet classification significantly outperformed classification based on standard ERP metrics. Learned shapelets carried MCI/AD features of absent N200 and delayed P300 in target trials and increased P50 and P200 in standard trials.\n\nConclusion: The results of this study support the hypothesis that ML-based waveform classification techniques can provide biomarker extraction capabilities that are not only less biased and less constrained, but also offer sensitivity beyond what can be achieved with standard measures. We conclude that analytical approaches, such as shapelet classification, might serve as a promising framework facilitating objective biomarker extraction in MCI/AD.\n\nFunding/financial disclosures: GD and ML are employees of The Siesta Group, a service provider for measuring electrophysiological and actigraphic signals in clinical trials.

Combined with large language models (LLMs), these causal clusters are enriched by the vast medical literature, paving the way for insightful analyses of clinical scales. Our work showcases the fusion of hypothesis-generating AI and LLMs, aiming to refine clinical trials, particularly in schizophrenia, anxiety, and major depression. This innovative approach assists in identifying explainable patient subpopulations, offering clarity to clinical trialists.\n\nDesign: Data from demographic items, psychiatric scales, and safety measures in clinical trials were integrated using Attractor AI technology. Technology related to attention mechanisms helps the machine explore the vast combinatorial space of variables. These form hypotheses related to patient subpopulations in anxiety and schizophrenia.\n\nResults: Schizophrenia data: Among 120 patients, our system identified 55 percent of placebo responders post-Bonferroni corrections. The model predicted a subtype of placebo responders with an accuracy of 86 percent.\n\nAnxiety data: Of 332 patients, eight clinical scale items formed a causal cluster accounting for 25 percent of placebo responders at 74-percent accuracy. A noteworthy revelation was a variable that improved placebo response but detrimentally affected drug response.\n\nMajor depression data: Analyzing 172 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), NetraAI illuminated factors dictating response versus nonresponse. This inaugural revelation demonstrates the extraction of causal features from intricate datasets, providing insights that are impactful for future heterogeneous psychiatric condition trials.\n\nConclusion: This research underscores the powerful synergy of machine learning (ML) and LLMs in dissecting patient population responses in clinical trials. Identifying causal variables ensures optimized participant selection, fortifying trial efficacy. Harnessing psychological factors effectively can enhance study outcomes, but care is paramount to prevent negative drug response implications.\n\nFunding/financial disclosures: Not provided.\n\nNeuroID: A Cutting-edge Modular Target Discovery Engine for Parkinson’s Disease\n\nAuthors: Clement Chatelain, Can Kayatekin, Franck Rapaport, Julia Bonner, Simon Dujardin, Jeremy Huang, Giorgio Gaglia, Michael Chao, Samuel Lessard, Charles Fulco, Hendrik Wesseling, Travis Ahn-Horst, Dongyu Liu, Hao He, Tejaswi Iyyanki, Zhaohui Du, Emanuele de Rinaldis, Shameer Khader, Rajaraman Krishnan\n\nAffiliations: Sanofi US, Cambridge, MA.\n\nBackground/Objective: We developed and evaluated an advanced modular target discovery platform, the NeuroID engine, for prioritizing therapeutic targets Parkinson’s disease (PD).\n\nDesign: The NeuroID engine centralizes multiomics data from various sources: human genetics on PD risk and progression (up to 53,858 patients), brain-specific epigenetics, bulk transcriptomics (from 51 selected studies), single-cell ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNA-seq), clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) screens (5 studies), proteomics, pathway/network biology, animal models, and text mining. Data were acquired from collaborations with Open Targets, FinnGen, UK Biobank, and AMP-PD. A specific machine learning (ML) model was created to prioritize PD, trained using this vast integrated data repository, and benchmarked against a list of targets prioritized by the Michael J. Fox Foundation (MJFF).\n\nResults: The NeuroID model demonstrated superior performance in predicting MJFF-prioritized PD targets over other target discovery systems, such as Open Targets. This heightened performance is the consequence of the comprehensive integration of various -omics types by the NeuroID system, quality of the data integrated, and innovative analytical methods.\n\nConclusion: The NeuroID engine represents a major advancement in data-driven target discovery for neurodegenerative diseases. With its proven ability to predict relevant therapeutic targets, we expect it to uncover novel therapeutic opportunities in the near future, marking a significant leap in the fight against PD.\n\nFunding/financial disclosures: Not provided.\n\nQuantifying the Processes and Events of Psychotherapy at Scale\n\nAuthors: Todd M. Solomon, PhD;1 Jamileh Jemison, MD;1 Alexander Deschamps, LMSW;1 Matus Hajduk, MSc;1Adam Kolar, MSc;1 Martin Majernik, MSc;1 Miguel Amável Pinheiro, PhD;1 Owen Muir, MD;2 Amanda Tinkelman, MD;2 Duncan J. Kimmel, MD;3 Daniel R. Karlin, MD, MA1,4\n\nAffiliations: 1Mind Medicine (MindMed), Inc., New York, NY; 2Brooklyn Minds Psychiatry & Curated Mental Health, New York, NY; 3Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY; 4Department of Psychiatry, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA\n\nBackground/Objective: This study aims to demonstrate the feasibility of collecting recordings of telemedicine psychotherapy, relevant electronic health records (EHRs), and matched real-world data (RWD) to create an aligned, multimodal dataset. We examined possible ways to use this dataset to train machine learning (ML) models, intending to explore the creation of tools that could assist psychotherapists.\n\nDesign: This study was conducted through an outpatient, telemedicine-enabled clinic in New York City. Participants were recruited from the existing treatment population and were already undergoing psychotherapy. After participants provided informed consent, each subsequent psychotherapy session was recorded; however, a participant could request that any individual session not be recorded without impact on study participation. Only sessions that occurred via telehealth were eligible for recording.\n\nThis study also collected participants’ EHR data from the study clinic, as well as their deidentified RWD from aggregated records providers, using a tokenized deidentification process provided by a third-party organization.\n\nResults: We successfully collected 34 psychotherapy session recordings from 19 participants across seven different providers, as well as EHR and other real-world health data from all participants. Preliminary ML analyses were applied to the data, and a further plan for data analysis is discussed.\n\nConclusion: Establishing this unique dataset is the first step to developing ML tools that can assist psychotherapists in their practice. This study demonstrates the feasibility of collecting more data of this nature, illustrates potential analyses that can be applied to the data and how they may help improve psychotherapy.\n\nFunding/financial disclosures: TMS, JJ, AD, MH, AK, MM, MAP, and DRK are employed by Mind Medicine, Inc., the sponsor of this research.

The regulatory considerations for digital health technology (DHT) use include verification, validation, and usability of the DHT; operationalization; and evaluation of endpoints data with risk considerations.\n\nIndustry and patient perspective: Patients are responding positively. Fifty-seven percent of patients confirmed a positive general experience with smart watches and mobile applications (apps), 85 percent would prefer a wearable to a diary given a choice, and 28 percent purchased a personal device to support their health and disease management. Patient concerns include data privacy and ease of set-up, and training and support should be provided.\n\nHTA and payer perspective: Digital endpoints also provide continuous and frequent measurement of the treatment outcome. The introduction of digital endpoints with machine learning (ML) capabilities introduces additional precision into the process, which will create new dynamics to inform practice, value, and access.\n\nConclusion: Regulatory guidelines are being established in key markets, paving the way for increased adoption of wearables and digital sensors. The use of connected devices could allow researchers to evaluate novel endpoints that utilize continuous data, ML, and AI. These methods are positioned to transform how we conduct clinical trials and gain patient insights.\n\nFunding/financial disclosures: Not provided.\n\nAssessment Devices and Tools\n\nAt-home Sway Assessments for Patients with Multiple Sclerosis: Richer Data, Lower Patient Burden\n\nAuthor: Brett Meyer\n\nAffiliations: Senior Data Scientist, Medidata\n\nBackground/Objective: Assessments of postural sway to determine disease state and fall risk in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) typically require patients to stand on force platforms in clinics. For people with limited mobility, visiting a clinical research site involves a high degree of patient burden and limits accessibility to clinical research. In pursuit of more accessible methods, researchers from the University of Vermont and Medidata together evaluated remote postural sway as a biomarker for balance impairment and fall risk prediction.\n\nDesign: In a sample of persons with MS, the research team compared postural sway features from free-living data collected through wearable sensors to those computed from a laboratory (lab) standing assessment, computed correlations to patient-reported measures (PRMs), and trained fall classification models to establish clinical significance. Patients completed in-lab assessments, several PRMs, and a 48-hour daily life monitoring period—immediately following the lab visit—during which they wore chest and thigh movement sensors.\n\nResults: By applying a cluster-based approach for analyzing remote data, the research team strengthened associations with PRMs, increasing their strength above those observed in the lab. While sway features differed significantly between lab and remote data—in some cases suggesting patients have variable confidence between lab and home environments—the clustering techniques reduced noise to make remotely collected data as useful as lab-collected data for predicting fall risk.\n\nConclusion: Clustering techniques applied to data remotely collected through wearable sensors equip researchers to predict fall risk for persons with MS with similar confidence to lab-based postural sway assessments, with the implication of lowering patient burden for those with MS in future studies.\n\nFunding/financial disclosures: Not provided.\n\nEnrichment Based on Automated Speech Latency Improves Treatment Effect in a Clinical Trial\n\nAuthors: Joshua S. Siegel, Sasagu Tomioka, Ajay Ogirala, Steven T. Szabo, Seth C. Hopkins, Kenneth S. Koblan, Mark G. Opler, Brian Kirkpatrick, Alex S. Cohen\n\nBackground/Objective: Speech latency is an objective measure of psychomotor slowing, with face validity and empirical support. Turn latency is the pause that occurs between when one person speaks and another responds. We previously demonstrated that automated detection of turn latency from structured psychiatric interviews shows temporal stability, convergent validity, sensitivity to change, and generalization across sociolinguistically diverse countries. Here, a retrospective analysis was conducted on the utility of turn latency as a potential enrichment tool.\n\nDesign: Speech data was obtained from 274 subjects with bipolar I depression in a randomized, double-blind, six-week clinical trial of SEP-4199 (200mg or 400mg). Automated speech analysis was conducted on 1,369 Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) recordings. Predicted MADRS scores were modeled based on turn latency for postrandomization sessions and applied to the screening data for classifying individuals: Class-0 (slow latency, predicted MADRS ≥20) and Class-1 (normal latency, predicted MADRS <20). Treatment response was compared between these groups.\n\nResults: At Week 6, Class-0 (n=213, slow screening latency) showed significant separation in MADRS improvement between placebo and both active treatment arms. Class-1 (n=61, normal screening latency) showed larger MADRS improvements overall and no significant separation between placebo and treatment arms. Excluding Class-1 increased primary outcome effect size by 64 percent and 83 percent for the treatment arms, respectively (0.36 to 0.59 for 200mg, 0.35 to 0.64 for 400mg).\n\nConclusion: Turn latency is an objective measure that is available from standard clinical assessments, and it may assess the severity of symptoms more accurately and potentially screen out placebo responders.\n\nFunding/financial disclosures: Not provided.\n\nInitial Psychometric Evaluation of the Pediatric Short Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale Version in an Adult, Acutely Exacerbated Clinical Trial Population with Schizophrenia\n\nAuthors: DG Daniel,1 A Kott,1 J Busner,1 X Wang,1 J Langfus,2 EA Youngstrom,3 R Findling4\n\nAffiliations: 1Signant Health; 2University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; 3University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill & Helping Give Away Psychological Science, 501c3; 4Virginia Commonwealth University\n\nBackground/Objective: The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) is the most frequently used instrument to measure severity of schizophrenia in clinical research. The scale is long, takes a lot of time to administer, and appears to have many item redundancies. Several attempts were conducted to shorten the instrument to reduce administrative burden but retain the validity and reliability of the original PANSS. In the current study, we assessed the performance of the recently developed PANSS10 for pediatric studies (Findling et al, 2023) in adult acute schizophrenia trials.\n\nDesign: Baseline PANSS data were pooled from 5,059 subjects recruited into 15 acute adult schizophrenia trials. Internal consistency was examined using average item correlations. Convergent validity of the PANSS10 with the full PANSS and Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) was examined using Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficient. Bland-Altman plots were used to show patterns of agreement between the PANSS10 and full PANSS.\n\nResults: The average interitem correlation for the PANSS10 was 0.09. The PANSS10 showed a strong correlation with the full PANSS (r=0.96, p<0.0001). The Spearman correlation between the PANSS10 and CGI-S was 0.46, (p<0.0001); between the full PANSS and CGI-S, the Spearman correlation was 0.52 (p<0.0001). The PANSS10 showed a slight tendency for higher scores, as indicated by the Bland-Altman plots; the average discrepancy was 0.12 points.\n\nConclusion: The 10-item version of the PANSS developed for a pediatric population shows promising psychometric qualities even in an adult population of acutely exacerbated clinical trial participants with schizophrenia.\n\nFunding/financial disclosures: Not provided.\n\nMulticenter Evaluation of the Dreem 3 System for the Assessment of Sleep in Patients with Disturbed Sleep\n\nAuthors: Silvia Frati Savietto,1 Antoine Guillot,1 Mason Harris,1 Jay Pathmanathan,1 Valérie Bertaina-Anglade,2 Geoffrey Viardot,2 Derek Hill,3 Pierrick Arnal,1 Jacob Donoghue1\n\nAffiliations: 1Beacon Biosignals, Boston, MA; 2Biotrial Neurosciences, FR; 3Panoramic Digital Health, FR\n\nBackground/Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the performance and usability of the Dreem 3S (D3S) dry-electroencephalogram (EEG) device for automated sleep staging and characterization of sleep parameters.\n\nDesign: Two prospective studies included 60 subjects who underwent either one overnight, in-laboratory (in-lab), traditional polysomnography (PSG) while concomitantly wearing the D3S, or three nights at home with the D3S.\n\nResults: Overall agreement between D3S and PSG scoring was 85.6 percent across sleep stages. Intraclass correlation (ICC) for total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE), latency to persistent sleep (LPS), and wake after sleep onset (WASO) exceeded 90 percent, indicating excellent agreement between D3S and PSG. ICC ranged from 65 to 86 percent for automated machine learning (ML) interpretation of time spent in N1, N2, N3, and rapid eye movement (REM), comparable or superior to other devices and individual human performance. Usability evaluation demonstrated safe and comfortable use of the device in the home setting, with a System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 68 or greater. Subjects were able to operate and record 2 to 3 nights of high-quality data without additional support. Furthermore, 96.6 percent of each record was deemed to be of sufficient EEG signal quality to enable manual expert review.\n\nConclusion: This data demonstrates the validity of D3S in providing EEG-based sleep-stage assessment, comparable to in-lab PSG. D3S was comfortably used by subjects at home over multiple nights without the need for professional setup. This will improve accessibility and enable broader use, including for longitudinal sleep studies in decentralized clinical trials (DCTs), which could provide insights that in-lab PSG would be too impractical or costly to identify.\n\nFunding/financial disclosures: Beacon Biosignals is a commercial entity focused on analysis of time series neurophysiological data and the development of neurophysiological biomarkers.\n\nNew Shortened Pediatric PANSS 10-item Scale: Extension and Replication of Findings in the Paliperidone Adolescent Schizophrenia Clinical Trial Dataset\n\nAuthors: Joan Busner, PhD;1 Eric A. Youngstrom, PhD;2 Joshua Langfus, MA;3 David G. Daniel, MD;4 Robert L. Findling, MD5\n\nAffiliations: 1Signant Health and Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine; 2University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Psychology Department, Chapel Hill, NC; 3University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; 4Signant Health; 5Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine\n\nBackground/Objective: Pediatric studies of schizophrenia have relied on the 30-item Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) as a primary outcome measure. The scale was designed for adults. Our group developed and published in 20231 a psychometrically sound 10-item version using pediatric data from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) schizophrenia study.2 A 20-item version was also developed. We wished to replicate and extend the findings in an independent, large, placebo-controlled trial.\n\nDesign: We applied the same psychometric and treatment sensitivity analyses of our earlier work to the international, placebo-controlled, adolescent schizophrenia paliperidone randomized clinical trial, accessed via the YODA secure data environment. Analyses included confirmatory factor analyses, graded response models, omega reliability coefficients, tests of convergent criterion validity, sensitivity to change, and Bland-Altman plots to evaluate score reproducibility.\n\nResults. The 10- and 20-item versions were similar to the 30-item version for average interitem correlations and omega total reliabilities, with reliability above 0.80 across patient presentations from mild residual symptoms to severe pathology; correlations of 0.92 and 0.98 with the 30-item total; similar partial eta-squared values for time, treatment, and time x treatment; and similar correlations with Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) and Children’s Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) ratings.\n\nConclusion. The 10- and 20-item PANSS short forms replicated strong reliability and validity in this large, international, positive, randomized controlled trial. The short forms demonstrated treatment sensitivity and convergent validity equivalent to that of the 30-item form, supporting their future use and offering the promise of substantial savings of rater and patient time and burden.\n\nFunding/financial disclosures: These findings were presented at the American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP) Annual Meeting, June 2023, in Miami, FL.

Ventilatory response to hypercapnia (VRH) is a known assessment method but has not, to date, been used to detect early signs at clinical doses. We describe an experimental model to assess drug-induced respiratory depression to meet growing United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements for approval of CNS drugs.\n\nDesign: Previous scientific literature suggests that change in minute ventilation (VE) is a clinically relevant early biomarker of respiratory depression, as assessed by stressing respiratory drive with hypercapnia. The VRH test measures dynamic changes in VE over time during administration of 7% carbon dioxide (CO2) through a facemask. This method mimics the clinical effect of drugs on respiratory drive as physiological mechanisms compensate for rising CO2 levels. Measurements include VE, respiratory rate, tidal volume, flow rate, and end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2; mmHg, continuously predose and at intervals postdose). The experimental endpoint of interest is maximum change (Emax) in VE.\n\nResults: VRH, including the traditional endpoint of VE at ETCO2 of 55mmHg (VE55), has been studied and found to be sensitive to CNS drugs. A recent FDA-initiated, randomized, double-blind, crossover trial in healthy volunteers showed that paroxetine/oxycodone significantly decreased VE, compared to oxycodone alone. Collectively, results suggest that VRH provides a sensitive, relevant model.\n\nConclusion: Measuring VRH can allow for a safe and controlled evaluation of clinical doses of drugs that may depress or reverse respiration before harmful levels are reached. Properly performed studies may allow the results to be included in the FDA package insert.\n\nFunding/financial disclosures: Publication funding was provided by Dr. Vince Clinical Research, which employs LW and SH.

Brown,2 Hailey Lefkofsky,2 Muneer Ali,2 Francisco M. De La Vega,2 Kathleen C. Barnes,2 Anthony Zoghbi,3 Joe Stanton,2 Marcus A. Badgeley2\n\nAffiliations: 1Department of Cancer Pharmacology & Pharmacogenomics, Levine Cancer Institute, Atrium Health, Charlotte, NC; 2Tempus Labs, Chicago, IL; 3Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX\n\nBackground/Objective: Pharmacogenomic testing has emerged as an aid in clinical decision making for psychiatric providers, but more data is needed regarding its utility in clinical practice and potential impact on patient care. In this retrospective review, we sought to determine the real-world prevalence of pharmacogenomic actionability in patients receiving psychiatric care.\n\nDesign: Potential actionability was based on the prevalence of CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 phenotypes, CYP2D6 allele-specific copy number variants (CNVs), CYP2D6 phenoconversion, the novel CYP2C-TG haplotype, and combined actionability from all sources in patients with available medication data.\n\nResults: Across 15,000 patients, 65 percent had potentially actionable CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 phenotypes, and phenotype assignment was impacted by CYP2D6 allele-specific CNVs in two percent of patients. Of 4,114 patients with medication data, 42 percent had CYP2D6 phenoconversion from drug interactions and 20 percent carried a novel CYP2C haplotype potentially altering actionability. Eighty-seven percent of patients had some form of actionability from genetic findings and/or phenoconversion, and genetic variation detected via next-generation sequencing (NGS) led to phenotype reassignment in 22 percent of individuals overall (2% in CYP2D6 and 20% in CYP2C19).\n\nConclusion: Ultimately, pharmacogenomic testing using NGS identified potential actionability in most patients receiving psychiatric care. Early pharmacogenomic testing may provide actionable insights to aid clinicians in drug prescribing to optimize psychiatric care.\n\nFunding/financial disclosures: Tempus Labs funded the sequencing and compute costs for this study.

Nunes, PhD;1 Ram Kinker Mishra, PhD;1 Ashkan Vaziri, PhD2\n\nAffiliations: 1Senior Research Scientist, BioSensics LLC, Newton, MA; 2Founder and CEO, BioSensics LLC, Newton, MA\n\nBackground/Objective: Neurological disorders affect central and peripheral nervous systems, impairing motor, speech, and cognitive functions. Our objective is to develop BioDigit Speech, a digital speech assessment solution for evaluating speech in neurological conditions, such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\n\nDesign: The rainbow passage reading task was administered to 59 older adults (41 with cognitive impairment and 18 cognitively intact), 11 patients with PSP, 10 with PD, and 11 with ALS. Speech was recorded and analyzed using BioDigit Speech.\n\nResults: Participants with cognitive impairment showed less similarity with the text (similarity DTW: 0.44 vs. 0.73, p>0.001), reduced intelligibility (intelligibility DTW: 0.24 vs. 0.37, p=0.012), and more pauses (speech-to-pause ratio: 3.53 vs. 7.51, p=0.017), compared to those who were cognitively intact. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score correlated significantly with similarity DTW (ρ = 0.53, p>0.001), ratio of extra words (ρ=0.53, p>0.001), speech-to-pause ratio (ρ= 0.38, p>0.003), and intelligibility DTW (ρ=0.33, p>0.01). Moreover, slower articulation rate was significantly lower in PSP versus PD (2.45 vs. 3.60 words/minute, p<0.001), with reduced intelligibility (intelligibility DTW: 0.26 vs. 0.53, p=0.017). Additionally, in ALS, lower bulbar function correlated with articulation rate (ρ=0.88, p<0.001) and intelligibility DTW (ρ=0.758, p<0.001) during passage reading.\n\nConclusion: Digital speech assessment can be a cost-effective solution for frequent and remote evaluation of neurological function. Results across disorders show speech sensitivity in distinguishing and capturing disease variability. Integrating speech assessments can benefit clinical trials with reliable remote patient monitoring.\n\nFunding/financial disclosures: Research reported in this publication was supported in part by BioSensics, LLC, and the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number R44AG080861.

Dowling,1 Ryan Moran,2,3 Matthew Allison,3 Job Godino2\n\nAffiliations: 1Data Sciences Institute, Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, MA; 2Exercise and Physical Activity Resource Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA; 3Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA\n\nBackground/Objective: Blood pressure (BP) is a vital sign used by clinicians to assess patient health and safety in clinical trials. As decentralized clinical trials (DCTs) reduce the number of clinic visits for patients, it is necessary to enable patients to accurately measure BP in the home environment using validated and patient friendly tools. Smart BP monitors are available to consumers but require validation and usability testing prior to implementation in DCTs. The aim of this study was to assess the analytical validation and usability of the Withings BPM Connect blood pressure monitor.\n\nDesign: Subjects used the monitors twice daily at home for a week to assess usability, while the accuracy of the Withings BPM Connect was compared to a reference device (Omron 5 Series) in 28 healthy volunteers (17 female, aged 12–65 years) during in-clinic testing. Statistical analyses included Bland-Altman plots, Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient, mean absolute percent error, and root mean square error.\n\nResults: Both systolic and diastolic BP measurements demonstrated low bias and high accuracy relative to the reference device of -2.3mmHg (95% limits of agreement [LoA]: -17.8 –13.2) and -0.37mmHg (95% LoA: -9.7–9.0), respectively. The BPM Connect received an average of 70.1 points out of 100 on the System Usability Scale (SUS) from the at-home testing.\n\nConclusion: The Withings BPM Connect demonstrated acceptable clinical accuracy and agreement with a commonly used BP cuff and moderately high usability in a diverse population. These results indicate that the device may be fit-for-purpose in DCTs.\n\nFunding/financial disclosures: Not provided.\n\nAnalytical Validation of Pediatric Digital Health Technologies for Use in Decentralized Clinical Trials\n\nAuthors: Katerina Placek, MS, PhD;1 David Wing, MS, CBDT, CCRC;2 Jasmin Imsirovic, PhD;1 Maira Tristao Parra, ScD, MS, MPH;2 Michael Higgins, MS;2 Ryan Moran, MD, MPH;3 Job Godino, PhD;2 Shoibal Datta, PhD;1 Ariel V. Dowling, PhD1\n\nAffiliations: 1Digital Health Sciences, Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, MA; 2Exercise and Physical Activity Resource Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA; 3University of California San Diego Health, San Diego, CA\n\nBackground/Objective: There are few United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved digital health technologies (DHTs) for remote pediatric vital signs and actigraphy monitoring. Furthermore, there is limited knowledge of the accuracy under different physiological conditions and at-home usability of existing devices in pediatric populations. Our goal is to enable future decentralized clinical trials (DCTs) by evaluating the accuracy and usability of DHTs to collect remote vital signs and actigraphy data in a pediatric population for clinical research.\n\nDesign: We are conducting a fit-for-purpose observational study to evaluate the accuracy and usability of three medical-grade DHTs that measure vital signs and actigraphy in 20 children aged 2 to 12 years.\n\nAnalytical performance: Participants will undergo one day of in-laboratory (in-lab) measurements of vital signs and actigraphy under different age-appropriate physical activities to compare test DHT measurements to concurrent measurements from FDA-cleared reference devices.\n\nLongitudinal usability: Test DHTs will be used at home over five days with remote study staff support. A System Usability Scale (SUS) and qualitative interview will be conducted at a follow-up in-lab visit to assess compliance and comfort.\n\nResults (anticipated): Analysis of the root mean square error between concurrent paired measurements will indicate the accuracy of test DHT measurements. Mixed-effects models will elucidate the relationships between accuracy and age, physical activity, and skin tone.\n\nConclusion: Analytical validation is necessary to demonstrate the accuracy and usability of DHTs in a pediatric population due to the lack of existing evidence. Quantifying the performance of DHTs in pediatrics is necessary to support their future use in DCTs.\n\nFunding/financial disclosures: This study was funded by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, Ltd.\n\nAnalytical Validation of Withings Digital Health Technologies for Use in Decentralized Clinical Trials\n\nAuthors: Andrew Kaseman, MS;1 Jasmin Imsirovic, PhD;1 Ariel V. Dowling, PhD;1 Job Godino, PhD;2 Ryan Moran, MD, MPH3\n\nAffiliations: 1Data Sciences Institute, Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, MA; 2Exercise and Physical Activity Resource Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA; 3University of California San Diego Health, San Diego, CA\n\nBackground/Objective: Decentralization of clinical trials has created a need for the accurate measurement of vital sign data in the home environment. These measurements can be quantified using digital devices, but these devices must be validated for accuracy of the acquired data. The objective of this study was to establish an analytical validation process for measurement of vital signs using digital devices. This process will quantify the accuracy of the data, compared to accepted reference devices.\n\nDesign: Twenty-eight healthy subjects consented to health metric tracking. Withings devices were selected as the vital sign measurement devices because of their usability ratings. Data was measured concurrently by both Withings devices and clinically accepted reference devices. Accuracy was assessed by comparing measurements between devices. A statistical analysis plan was created based on a combination of International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards, United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance, and existing literature on medical devices.\n\nResults: The Thermo thermometer demonstrated accuracy within FDA guidelines (root mean square error [RMSE]: 0.52°F). The Body+ weight scale was an accurate and precise scale (RMSE: 0.40kg). However, body composition measurements were less accurate (RMSE: 3.45kg). The Sleep Mat passive sleep monitor was accurate, compared to reference devices, for both heart rate (RMSE: 9.11bpm) and respiratory rate at rest (RMSE: 2.37 breaths/min). The ScanWatch smartwatch could accurately measure heart rate in patients at rest (RMSE: 4.07bpm); however, its accuracy suffered during exercise (RMSE: 29.59bpm). Caution should be used when measuring electrocardiogram signals (RMSE: 47.54ms). Blood oxygenation measurements, despite being FDA cleared, were inaccurate (RMSE: 3.63%).\n\nConclusion: The Withings digital devices provide accurate measurements of several vital signs, compared to gold standard reference devices. However, advanced measurements, such as body composition and electrocardiography, lack clinically sufficient accuracy.\n\nFunding/financial disclosures: This study was funded by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, Ltd.\n\nDriving the Adoption of Decentralized Trials: DTRA’s Initial Initiative Deliverables\n\nAuthors: Amir Kalali, MD; Craig Lipset; Jane Myles; Paige Altrogge\n\nAffiliations: Decentralized Trials & Research Alliance (DTRA)\n\nBackground/Objective: The objective was to share the progress to date on the cross-industry initiatives chartered and executed by DTRA.\n\nDesign: Twelve initiatives were chartered to define the roadmap to develop strategic solutions for teams. Working groups are established to work on the priority aligned strategic roadmap. Through initiative teams and CoLabs, DTRA works to publish resources, such as a glossary, an evidence of impact repository, patient journey maps, and more. These resources are made available to the research community at large to support education and adoption of decentralized clinical trials (DCTs).\n\nResults: Tools, data, and resources are now available from all 12 of the initiative teams. These are accessible to the public for use in designing and executing DCTs or research studies.\n\nConclusion: By enabling a community of stakeholders to work together on our shared goals and mission, we are working to educate the research community to give patients the best experience possible while part of a clinical trial.\n\nFunding/financial disclosures: DTRA is a 501c3 nonprofit organization.\n\nEmbedding the Patient Voice in Decentralized Clinical Trials\n\nAuthors: Keri McDonough,1 Michelle Ouellette2\n\nAffiliations: 1Head, Patient Voice Consortium, Vice President, Medical and Scientific Strategy, Syneos Health; 2Associate Director, Patient Recruitment and Retention Management, Syneos Health\n\nBackground/Objective: Hybrid and decentralized clinical trials (DCTs) have been touted for their ability to make research participation easier and more inclusive without sacrificing study integrity. However, much of the DCT narrative has been driven by assumptions, rather than concrete data. To address this gap, Syneos Health sought to learn from recent clinical trial participants and seasoned advocates about their perspectives on when, where, and how remote care and monitoring technologies might improve the research experience for participants.\n\nDesign: Syneos Health used a mixed-method approach. A 50-question survey was deployed to patients who recently participated in an interventional clinical trial. Respondents (n=300) were asked to reflect on their satisfaction across DCT modalities. Syneos Health then held an advisory workshop with seasoned patient advocates to interpret survey findings; explore how age, race, and disease area affect preferences; and surface strategies for designing studies that align with real-world patient considerations and concerns. Advocates represented national and regional organizations working in pain, mental illness, psoriasis, rare diseases, and respiratory diseases.\n\nResults: Seventy-four percent of survey respondents said a DCT option would make them more likely to participate in trials. Reduced travel burden and greater flexibility scheduling visits were the main reasons.\n\nConclusion: Syneos Health research validates a key assumption: DCT and digital health solutions will likely encourage participation across different demographics and disease types. As DCT strategies mature, it will be critical to ensure that population-specific insights are at the forefront of efforts to improve participant experiences.\n\nFunding/financial disclosures: None to report.\n\nImplementation of Home Infusions in a Multinational Preclinical Alzheimer’s Disease Study\n\nAuthors: Isabella Velona, Masters;1 Roy Yaari, MD;1 Karen C. Holdridge, MPH;1 Cheryl Ann Brown, RPh;1 Paula Cohen, BA;2 Elizabeth Shaffer-Bacareza, BS;3 Maria Arampatzidou, PhD;2 Nancy Lizzul, RN;4 Ellen Weiss, BA4\n\nAffiliations: 1Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN; 2Alzheimer’s Therapeutic Research Institute, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, San Diego, CA; 3Alzheimer’s Therapeutic Research Institute, University of Southern California, San Diego, CA; 4PCM Trials, Denver, CO\n\nBackground/Objective: The A4 Study was a Phase III clinical trial investigating solanezumab in preclinical Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the delivery of elective health services worldwide, and social distancing restrictions created challenges for clinical trial participants to continue monthly infusions. To retain A4 participants, decentralized clinical trial (DCT)methods were implemented, including deployment of mobile research nurses to conduct home visits.\n\nDesign: The A4 Study was a 4.5-year double-blind trial, followed by an optional four-year, open-label treatment period. The study launched in 2014, and 1,163 male and female patients between the ages of 65 and 85 years have been dosed. Home visits were not originally included in the study protocol but were implemented in 2020 to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on study conduct. PCM Trials offered home visits as an option to allow participants to continue to receive the investigational product. Mobile research nurses traveled to participant homes and administered the 30- to 60-minute intravenous (IV) infusions every four weeks.\n\nResults: More than 1,400 home infusion visits were conducted in the A4 Study. A total of 124 participants were enrolled in home infusions (99 in the United States, 1 in Canada, and 24 in Australia) from 18 sites.\n\nConclusion: We demonstrated not only that home infusions could be implemented successfully and safely in this population during the pandemic, but also that continuing this model postpandemic successfully addressed challenges to retention. Considering the length of the study, infusion frequency, and age of the participants, home visits helped study completion and compliance.\n\nFunding/financial disclosures: Not provided.\n\nLearnings From the Execution of the First Interventional Decentralized Clinical Trial in Major Depressive Disorder: A Phase II Trial\n\nAuthors: Christopher Reist,1 Thuy Le Nguyen,2 Peide Li,2 Sigurd D. Suessmuth3\n\nAffiliations: 1Science 37, Culver City, CA; 2Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Ridgefield, CT; 3Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, Ingelheim am Rhein, Germany\n\nBackground/Objective: Decentralized clinical trials (DCTs) utilize digital innovations, namely telemedicine and smartphone applications (apps), to allow trial conduct at patients’ homes. Here, key learnings from an interventional DCT evaluating BI 1358894 in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) are reported.\n\nDesign: This Phase II DCT was conducted through a collaboration between Boehringer Ingelheim and Science 37 (California, United States [US]), from a single (meta)site in the US. Patients were enrolled (June 2020–April 2022) through various social media and randomized to receive BI 1358894 or placebo. Patient feedback surveys were issued at the end of the study. A central review of clinical data and video recordings by a third-party vendor was established, and local laboratory patient service centers were set up to allow urgent patient access to clinical care. Trial data was captured directly through the Science 37 platform.\n\nResults: In this first of its kind study, operational feasibility of the DCT model was demonstrated using the Science 37 platform. The protocol was successfully executed, and the platform provided an easy way for subjects to communicate with study staff, complete patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), and schedule study visits. This translated into a completion rate of 97 percent, as well as high levels of subject satisfaction. A wide variety of traditional and digital recruitment strategies were employed. Despite over 80,000 potential subjects being reached over a vast geography, only 45 were randomized over a 22-month period. Therefore, it was decided to terminate the trial early.\n\nConclusion: A Phase II protocol was successfully executed in patients with MDD using the Science 37 platform to support a completely DCT; however, digital recruitment was unable to overcome the challenges of stringent eligibility criteria.\n\nFunding/financial disclosures: This study was funded by Boehringer Ingelheim (1402-0014, NCT04423757).

We show that combining patient reports (i.e., what they say) with objective biomarkers (i.e., how they say it and what they do) can greatly enhance the quality of telemedicine and improve the efficacy of siteless trials and digital therapeutic interventions.\n\nDesign: A virtual agent, Tina, engages participants in an immersive interaction comprising tasks that elicit speech, facial, motoric, and cognitive behaviors, objective biomarkers of which can be automatically computed from participant speech and video in near-real time. Furthermore, Tina encourages participants to describe, in their own words, their most bothersome problems and what makes them better or worse, through the Patient Report of Problems™ (PROP™) instrument, as well as other clinical survey instruments of interest.\n\nResults: Multimodal analytics modules automatically extract features that capture information from acoustic (energy, timing, voice quality, spectral), facial (articulatory kinematics, range of motion, eye and facial movement), motoric (finger tapping kinematics), and textual (lexico-semantic, sentiment) domains during these tasks. We also classify verbatim PROP responses into multiple clinically relevant symptoms using a multilabel text classification deep neural network model trained on data collected from over 25,000 patients.\n\nConclusion: Combining objective audiovisual biomarkers with patient self-report of problems via conversational artificial intelligence and interpretable machine learning has significant potential to enhance the quality of telemedicine-based healthcare and improve the efficacy of siteless trials and digital therapeutic interventions.\n\nFunding/financial disclosures: All authors are salaried and receive equity from Modality.ai, Inc.\n\nInvestigative Drug Compounds and Therapies\n\nBaseline Mismatch Negativity Amplitude Predicts Direction and Magnitude of Ketamine Effect in Healthy Volunteers: A Disordinal Effect\n\nAuthors: KC Fadem,1 J Johannesen,2 B Farley,2 M Cecchi,1 L Ereshefsky,3,4,5 DH Mathalon6\n\nAffiliations: 1Cognision, KY; 2Sage Therapeutics, MA; 3CenExel HRI, NJ; 4CenExel Research, CA; 5University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, TX; 6University of California and VA Health Care System, San Francisco, CA\n\nBackground/Objective: Mismatch negativity (MMN) is a neurophysiological response linked to activity of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. However, effects of NMDA receptor blockade by ketamine appear bidirectional, producing either suppression or augmentation of MMN amplitude in different individuals. We evaluated the hypothesis that the direction and magnitude of ketamine’s effect is predicted by baseline MMN.\n\nDesign: MMN was assessed twice, first during placebo, then during ketamine, in healthy volunteers from three studies with a similar duration of deviant paradigms (KET1: n=8; KET2: n=19; KET3: n=25). Because baseline MMN may predict MMN change upon retest due to regression to the mean, we also compared the baseline MMN prediction of ketamine-induced change to its prediction of MMN change during a drug-free test-retest study (TR: n=36).\n\nResults: In all groups, baseline MMN moderated the magnitude and direction of MMN change, with larger baselines predicting MMN decreases and smaller baselines predicting MMN increases. However, the slopes of this relationship differed significantly between groups (group x baseline MMN: p=0.003). Specifically, relative to the TR group slope (beta: -0.511), significantly steeper slopes were observed for KET2 (p<0.001) and KET3 (p=0.005), but not KET1 (p=0.189). The three ketamine group slopes did not differ (p=0.624), and their common slope was significant (beta: -0.746, p<0.001).\n\nConclusion: Ketamine produces a disordinal effect on MMN, inducing decreases in those with larger MMNs and increases in those with smaller MMNs that are distinct from regression to the mean. Whether this effect is specific to MMN and related to variation in clinical measures requires further study.\n\nFunding/financial disclosures: This research was solely funded by the ERP Biomarker Qualification Consortium.

Suessmuth3\n\nAffiliations: 1Science 37, Culver City, CA; 2Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Ridgefield, CT; 3Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, Ingelheim am Rhein, Germany\n\nBackground/Objective: This study aimed to characterize the safety profile of BI 1358894 administered as an adjunct to standard-of-care antidepressants in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and inadequate response to first-line antidepressants.\n\nDesign: This Phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, decentralized clinical trial (DCT) enrolled patients aged 18 to 65 years with MDD (current depressive episode of ≥8 weeks–≤18 months), ongoing antidepressant monotherapy (≥8 weeks), and a Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score of 22 or greater at screening. Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive BI 1358894 or placebo daily for six weeks. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded. Suicidal behavior/ideation was monitored using the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). All assessments were home-based.\n\nResults: A total of 131 patients were enrolled, 45 were randomized, and 43 were treated (BI 1358894, n=20; placebo, n=23). The mean (standard deviation [SD]) age was 42.2 (13.1) years, and 84 percent of patients were female. Efficacy was not evaluated due to early trial termination and insufficient statistical power. Suicidal ideation was more common in the active treatment group (C-SSRS baseline: BI 1358894, 15%; placebo, 4%). AEs were reported by 86 percent of patients (BI 1358894, 90%; placebo, 83%). Two BI 1358894-treated patients reported AEs resulting in discontinuation. Two placebo-treated patients experienced serious AEs. A severe AE (headache) was experienced by one BI 1358894-treated patient.\n\nConclusion: In this interventional DCT, adjunctive daily BI 1358894 treatment over six weeks was well-tolerated and demonstrated a favorable safety profile. Slow recruitment resulted in early trial termination, indicating that the recruitment process is critical for success.\n\nFunding/financial disclosures: This study was funded by Boehringer Ingelheim (1402-0014, NCT04423757).

Effectiveness of treatment modalities was based on the number of patients whose condition progressed to surgical interventions.\n\nResults: Data analysis showed that 3.2 percent of the total patients diagnosed with cervical pain progressed to the stage requiring surgical intervention. Out of 2.11 million patients that were treated using only conservative therapy, four percent required surgical intervention. In the 17,000 patients treated using only steroid injections, a significantly higher number of patients (n=2,336; 13%) required surgical intervention.\n\nThe total population of cervical pain patients consisted of 62 percent female and 38 percent male patients. The disease was more prevalent in patients above 50 years of age. The most common comorbidities were lower back pain, joint pain, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The comorbidity profile was similar in both the conservative treatment and steroid injection groups.\n\nConclusion: A significantly higher number of patients (2.11 million) opting for only conservative therapy, compared to patients treated with only steroid therapy (17,000), indicates that conservative therapy remains the most popular first-line treatment option. Also, conservative therapy is considered a more effective treatment modality, based on the significantly smaller number of patients requiring surgical intervention. More studies are needed to fully document the benefits of conservative therapy in the treatment of cervical pain.\n\nFunding/financial disclosures: Not provided.\n\nEfficacy and Safety of Esmethadone (REL-1017) in Patients with Major Depressive Disorder and Inadequate Response to Standard Antidepressants: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial\n\nAuthors: M Fava, S Stahl, L Pani, S De Martin, C O’Gorman, C Guidetti, A Alimonti, S Comai, A Mattarei, F Folli, D Bushnell, S Traversa, CE Inturrisi, PL Manfredi,* M Pappagallo*^\n\n*Drs. Pappagallo and Manfredi contributed equally; ^Presenting author\n\nBackground/Objective: The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of esmethadone (REL-1017) as adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD).\n\nDesign: This Phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial studied oral REL-1017 25mg or placebo for 28 days in patients with inadequate response to standard antidepressants. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) from baseline to Day 28. In the intent-to-treat (ITT) group, patients were randomized, irrespective of protocol deviations or discontinuation. In the per-protocol (PP) group, subjects completed treatment without major deviations affecting efficacy assessments. Prerandomization, clinicians from the Clinical Trial Network and Institute assessed prior antidepressant response and antidepressant tolerance/tachyphylaxis using the Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire. MADRS score above 35 at Day 1 (baseline) was categorized as severe depression.\n\nResults: N: number of subjects; R: REL-1017; P: placebo; CFB: MADRS change from baseline; MD: mean difference; p: p-value; ES: Cohen’s Effect Size\n\nITT—N: 227; R: 113; P: 114; CFB MD: 2.3; p=0.1537; ES: 0.21\n\nPP—N: 198; R: 101; P: 97; CFB MD: 3.1; p=0.0510; ES: 0.29\n\nPP female patients—N: 146; R: 74; P: 72; CFB MD: 3.8; p=0.0417; ES: 0.36\n\nPP patients aged over 50 years—N: 88; R: 46; P: 42; CFB MD: 6.3; p=0.0043; ES: 0.64\n\nPP MADRS score above 35—N: 98; R: 45; P: 53; CFB MD: 7.9; p=0.0015; ES: 0.68\n\nPP AT—N: 79; R: 43; P: 36; CFB MD: 6.1; p=0.0101; ES: 0.62\n\nConclusion: Efficacy outcomes favored PP analyses. Favorable efficacy outcomes were observed in PP prespecified analyses of female patients and patients above the age of 50 years, as well as in post hoc analyses of MADRS score above 35 and AT. Esmethadone was safe and well tolerated.\n\nFunding/financial disclosures: Not provided.\n\nEfficacy and Safety of Iclepertin (BI 425809) in Patients with Schizophrenia: CONNEX, a Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial Program\n\nAuthors: Corey Reuteman-Fowler,1* Zuzana Blahova,2 Satoru Ikezawa,3 Stephen R. Marder,4 Peter Falkai,5 John H. Krystal6\n\n*Presenting author\n\nAffiliations: 1Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Ridgefield, CT; 2Boehringer Ingelheim RCV GmbH & Co. KG, Vienna, Austria; 3Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Komaba, Meguro-ku, Tokyo, Japan; 4Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, David Geffen School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA; 5Clinic of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Ludwig Maximilians University Munich, Munich, Germany; 6Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT\n\nBackground/Objective: No effective pharmacological treatments are available for cognitive impairments in schizophrenia. Iclepertin (BI 425809), a glycine transporter-1 inhibitor, enhances N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor signaling by increasing synaptic levels of its co-agonist glycine. In a Phase II, proof-of-clinical-concept trial (NCT02832037), iclepertin was well tolerated and improved cognition in schizophrenia. The Phase III CONNEX program aims to confirm the efficacy and safety of iclepertin in improving cognition and functioning across a large cohort of patients with schizophrenia.\n\nDesign: The CONNEX program consists of three replicate randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel trials in patients with schizophrenia (NCT04846868, NCT04846881, NCT04860830). A total of 586 patients per trial will be recruited across 41 countries and randomized 1:1 to receive daily iclepertin 10mg or placebo over 26 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint is change from baseline (CfB) in overall composite T score of the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia Consensus Cognitive Battery. Key secondary efficacy endpoints include CfB in total Schizophrenia Cognition Rating Scale score and CfB in the adjusted total time in the Virtual Reality Functional Capacity Assessment Tool. Long-term safety and tolerability data will be collected in an open-label safety extension study (CONNEX-X).\n\nResults: The studies are currently recruiting (first participants enrolled August–September 2021), with completion expected in Q1 2025. Current study status, including screening failures and data collection experiences, are presented.\n\nConclusion: Most industry-sponsored studies testing compounds for cognitive deficits have failed to show proof-of-clinical-concept. If successful, the CONNEX program would provide evidence for iclepertin as the first efficacious medication addressing cognitive impairments in schizophrenia.\n\nFunding/financial disclosures: These studies were funded by Boehringer Ingelheim (1346-0011, NCT04846868; 1346-0012, NCT04846881; 1346-0013, NCT04860830).

Miller, PhD;1 Steven M. Paul, MD;1 Stephen K. Brannan, MD1\n\nAffiliations: 1Karuna Therapeutics, Boston, MA; 2New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY\n\nBackground/Objective: KarXT (xanomeline–trospium chloride) is a dual M1/M4 preferring muscarinic receptor agonist that lacks direct D2 dopamine receptor binding. The efficacy and safety of KarXT in schizophrenia was demonstrated in the five-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, EMERGENT-1 (NCT03697252), EMERGENT-2 (NCT04659161), and EMERGENT-3 (NCT04738123) inpatient trials in people with schizophrenia experiencing acute psychosis.\n\nDesign: In each trial, the primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline to Week 5 in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score versus placebo. Additionally, changes from baseline to Week 5 in PANSS positive subscale, PANSS negative subscale, PANSS Marder negative factor, and Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) scores were assessed. Data from the EMERGENT trials were pooled, and efficacy analyses were conducted in the modified intent-to-treat population, defined as all randomized participants who received one or more trial drug doses and had a baseline and one or greater postbaseline PANSS assessment.\n\nResults: The pooled analyses included 640 participants (KarXT, n=314; placebo, n=326). Across trials, KarXT was associated with a significantly greater reduction in PANSS total score at Week 5, compared to placebo (KarXT: -19.4; placebo: -9.6; p<0.0001; Cohen’s d=0.65). At Week 5, KarXT was also associated with a significantly greater reduction than placebo in PANSS positive subscale (KarXT: -6.3; placebo: -3.1), PANSS negative subscale (KarXT: -3.0; placebo: -1.3), PANSS Marder negative factor (KarXT: -3.8; placebo: -1.8), and CGI-S scores (KarXT: -1.1; placebo: -0.5; all p<0.0001).\n\nConclusion: In pooled analyses from the EMERGENT trials, KarXT demonstrated statistically significant improvements across efficacy measures with consistent and robust effect sizes, and findings support the potential of KarXT to be first in a new class of medications to treat schizophrenia.\n\nFunding/financial disclosures: This trial was sponsored by Karuna Therapeutics.

Results of a Randomized, Placebo-controlled, Double-blind, Phase II Trial\n\nAuthors: Martin Walter,1 Christine zu Eulenburg,2,3 Karin Schmid,4 Isabel Schwienbacher,2,5 Ani Damyanova,2 Evangelos Papanastasiou,2 Florian Holsboer,2 Hans Eriksson2\n\nAffiliations: 1University Hospital Jena, Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Jena, Germany; 2HMNC Brain Health, Munich, Germany; 3University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany; 4Develco Pharma Schweiz AG, Pratteln, Switzerland; 5Current affiliation: Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma, Ingelheim am Rhein, Germany\n\nBackground/Objective: Ketamine is a rapid-acting antidepressant associated with dissociative adverse effects. KET01 is an oral prolonged-release formulation of racemic ketamine with a low potential for dissociation.\n\nDesign: Outpatients (N=122) with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) were randomized to once-daily placebo (PBO), KET01 120mg, or KET01 240mg for three weeks. The first dose was administered under supervision; remaining doses were taken at home. Primary endpoint was mean change from baseline in the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) on Day 21 (mixed model for repeated measures).\n\nResults: KET01 240mg/day dose demonstrated rapid improvements in MADRS at seven hours after first dosage (change from baseline: -7.65; Δ vs. PBO: -2.22, not significant), with statistically significant separation on Day 4 (change from baseline: -10.02; Δ vs. PBO: -3.66, p=0.020) and Day 7 (change from baseline: -12.21; Δ vs. PBO: -3.95, p=0.042). The improvements were sustained until Day 21 (change from baseline: -13.15; Δ vs. PBO: -1.82, not significant) and after four-week follow-up (change from baseline: -12.51; Δ vs. PBO: -3.35, not significant). KET01 was well tolerated, with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported by 47.5, 50.0, and 62.5 percent of patients in the PBO, KET01 120mg/day, and KET01 240mg/day groups, respectively. No differences in the mean Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale scores were observed between the groups at any time point. Transient elevations in mean plasma gamma-glutamyltransferase and alanine aminotransferase concentrations occurred from Week 2 for both KET01 groups.\n\nConclusion: This study demonstrated a rapid and clinically relevant reduction of depressive symptoms after treatment with KET01 240mg/day, with only minimal signs of dissociative symptoms.\n\nFunding/financial disclosures: MW was the international coordinating investigator for the KET01-02 trial.

Acute side effects, such as dissociation and increase in blood pressure, can emerge after any route of administration and are related to peak plasma levels. Systemic or oral immediate-release administration of ketamine or esketamine lead to early Cmax values accompanied by dissociation and blood pressure changes. Administration of an oral prolonged-release formulation of ketamine results in relatively lower Cmax and relatively higher concentrations of the metabolite hydroxynorketamine (HNK), compared to after rapid systemic administration. HNK has shown efficacy in rodent models of depression.\n\nThe objective of the KET01-03 trial was to compare the tolerability and safety of single antidepressant doses of oral KET01 (240mg prolonged-release ketamine) and intranasal esketamine (SPRAVATO® 84mg; active comparator; the highest approved dose) and investigate the pharmacokinetics of ketamine and esketamine and their main metabolites.\n\nDesign: This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, double-dummy, single-center, crossover trial in healthy male volunteers. After screening, two single-dose treatment periods were separated by a washout period of 14 to 28 days. The primary objective was to compare the maximum changes in the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS) score from baseline within the treatment period between the two treatments.\n\nResults: The first subject was dosed on July 3, 2023, and the last visit took place on August 7, 2023. Twenty-five subjects received two doses. No serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported.\n\nConclusion: Twenty-five subjects completed the trial, and no SAEs were reported. Further evaluation is ongoing, and results will be presented.\n\nFunding/financial disclosures: HE, CE, AD, LA, and EP are employed by or consultants to HMNC Brain Health.

Kozauer,1 Willie R. Earley,1* Changzheng Chen,1 Jason Huo,1 Stephen M. Stahl,2 Roger S. McIntyre3,4\n\n*Presenting author\n\nAffiliations: 1Intra-Cellular Therapies, Inc., New York, NY; 2Department of Psychiatry, University of California, San Diego; La Jolla, CA; 3Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; 4Department of Pharmacology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada\n\nBackground/Objective: Lumateperone is a United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved antipsychotic to treat schizophrenia and depressive episodes associated with bipolar I or bipolar II disorder. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial (NCT04285515) investigated the efficacy and safety of lumateperone 42mg for the treatment of a major depressive episode (MDE) in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar depression with mixed features.\n\nDesign: Adults with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5)-diagnosed MDD or bipolar I/ II disorder with mixed features experiencing an MDE (Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] total score ≥24 and Clinical Global Impression-Severity [CGI-S] score ≥4) were randomized 1:1 to lumateperone 42mg or placebo. Primary and key secondary efficacy outcomes were changes from baseline to Day 43 in MADRS total score and CGI-S score, respectively. Safety was assessed.\n\nResults: Of 385 treated patients (placebo, n=193; lumateperone, n=192), 344 (89.4%) completed the study. MADRS total score significantly improved with lumateperone 42mg, compared to placebo, in the combined MDD/bipolar depression population (mean change from baseline to Day 43 least squares mean difference [LSMD] vs. placebo: -5.7; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -7.60, -3.84; effect size: -0.64; p<0.0001), with similar significant improvements (p<0.0001) in individual MDD and bipolar depression populations. Significant improvements were also observed for CGI-S in the combined MDD/bipolar depression population (LSMD: -0.6; 95% CI: -0.81, -0.39; effect size: -0.59; p<0.0001) and individual MDD and bipolar depression populations. Lumateperone treatment was generally safe and well tolerated, and it was consistent with prior studies.\n\nConclusion: Lumateperone 42mg demonstrated robust efficacy over placebo in patients with MDD or bipolar depression with mixed features and was generally safe and well tolerated.\n\nFunding/financial disclosures: SD, SGK, WRE, CC, and JH are full-time employees of Intra-Cellular Therapies, Inc. and may hold equity in the company.

Twenty-four HVs aged 21 to 45 years were administered ketamine intravenously in two of the periods and placebo in the remaining period in a counterbalanced order. The ketamine dose was a 0.23mg/kg bolus over one minute, followed by 0.58mg/kg per hour for 30 minutes, and 0.29mg/kg per hour for up to 29 minutes after that. ERP and EEG data were collected during the infusions. Each ERP/EEG testing session included four tests: active oddball, resting-state EEG, 40Hz auditory steady-state response (ASSR), and duration-deviant mismatch negativity.\n\nResults: Ketamine effects on ERP and QEEG measures included an increase in N100 amplitude, N100 and P200 latency, and a decrease in P3b and P200 amplitude in the active oddball; a decrease in low-frequency power and an increase in gamma power and peak alpha frequency in the resting-state EEG; and an increase in 40Hz power in the 40Hz ASSR. Finally, reliability of the ketamine effects, as measured by intraclass correlation coefficient, was good-to-excellent for most of the measures collected.\n\nMeaningful Behavioral Change as an Efficacy Outcome in a Clinical Trial of Istradefylline for Apathy in Parkinson’s Disease\n\nAuthors: Travis H. Turner, Christina Marsiscano, Sandra Wilson, Lilia Lovera, Federico Rodriguez-Porcel\n\nBackground/Objective: Apathy is a common, troublesome symptom in Parkinson’s disease (PD), associated with diminished quality of life for both the patient and care partner.1,2 Because apathy reduces engagement in physical and social activities, it may accelerate disease progression and cognitive decline.3 Prior studies suggest reduced apathy with istradefylline in PD;4 enhanced mesolimbic dopamine via adenosine A2A receptor antagonism is proposed as a mechanism.5 Functional measures of motivated behavior may prove more effective in measuring apathy and response to treatment than subjective rating scales.6 This article aimed to describe design and methodology for an ongoing study of istradefylline treatment on physical activity and other motivated behavior in PD.\n\nDesign: A sample of 32 patients with PD with motor fluctuations and clinically significant apathy will complete a 12-week open-label trial of istradefylline. Primary efficacy outcomes include the Physically Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE)7 and Engagement in Meaningful Activities Survey (EMAS),8 completed via weekly telephone surveys. Change in PASE total score and EMAS will be evaluated using hierarchical linear modeling, controlling for improvements in motor functioning.\n\nResults: Study enrollment will be completed in October 2023, with primary results reported in early 2024.\n\nConclusion: This study utilizes real-world measures of motivated behavior, the PASE and EMAS, to evaluate impact of istradefylline on apathy in PD. These measures provide clinically meaningful efficacy outcomes relevant to disease-modifying behavior. Preliminary results indicate favorable participant experience with the study protocol and intervention. Findings from this study will inform study design of larger controlled trials.\n\nFunding/financial disclosures: Not provided.\n\nReferences:\n\nvan Reekum R, Stuss DT, Ostrander L. Apathy: why care?

Targum;1 Carolyn Watson, PhD;2 Colin Sauder, PhD;2 Inder Kaul, MD, MPH;2 Andrew C. Miller, PhD;2 Amy Claxton, PhD;2 Steven M. Paul, MD;2 Stephen K. Brannan, MD2\n\nAffiliations: 1Signant Health, Boston, MA, Stony Brook, NY; 2Karuna Therapeutics, Boston, MA\n\nBackground/Objective: Atypical antipsychotics can induce extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), contributing to overall side effect burden. KarXT (xanomeline–trospium chloride) is an investigational therapy targeting muscarinic receptors and lacking D2 dopamine receptor binding that shows promise for treating schizophrenia without many of the side effects associated with current treatments. Here, we further characterize EPS rates in KarXT clinical trials.\n\nDesign: EMERGENT-1 (NCT03697252), EMERGENT-2 (NCT04659161), and EMERGENT-3 (NCT04738123) were five-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, inpatient trials in people with schizophrenia. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) associated with EPS from the safety populations, defined as all participants who received one or more doses of trial medication, were pooled. Additionally, EPS were assessed by examining changes from baseline to Week 5 on the Simpson-Angus Scale, Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale, and Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale.\n\nResults: EPS AEs were observed in 3.2 percent of patients in the KarXT group (n=340) versus 0.9 percent in the placebo group (n=343). The most commonly reported TEAE was akathisia (KarXT: 2.4%; placebo: 0.9%). Overall rates of akathisia TEAEs deemed related to trial drug were low (KarXT: 0.6%; placebo: 0.3%). All reported TEAEs were mild to moderate in severity. KarXT was not associated with clinically meaningful changes from baseline to Week 5 on scales assessing EPS.\n\nConclusion: The incidence of TEAEs associated with EPS with KarXT treatment was low and not associated with increased scores on EPS scales across five weeks of treatment. These results, combined with the robust efficacy of KarXT in trials to date, suggest that KarXT’s novel mechanism of action may provide therapeutic benefit in the absence of EPS frequently associated with currently available antipsychotics.\n\nFunding/financial disclosures: This trial was sponsored by Karuna Therapeutics.

Shram and Pappagallo contributed equally; ^Presenting author\n\nAffiliations: MP is affiliated with Relmada Therapeutics.\n\nBackground/Objective: Esmethadone (REL-1017) is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor uncompetitive antagonist. We evaluated the abuse potential and dependence of REL-1017 in two Phase III trials of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).\n\nDesign: Studies-301 and -303 were 28-day, outpatient, Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of once daily oral REL-1017 25mg (Day 1 loading dose: 75mg) in patients with MDD. We performed a safety analysis of all adverse events (AEs) and collected narratives for AEs potentially related to abuse. We assessed “drug liking,” “drug high,” and “desire to take the drug again” with a 0- to 100-point visual analogue scale (VAS). We used The Misuse, Abuse, and Diversion Drug Event Reporting System (MADDERS®) to assess potentially abuse-related events. We assessed withdrawal after abrupt treatment discontinuation with the Physician Withdrawal Checklist (PWC), Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS), and Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS).\n\nResults: Among the 459 patients receiving any study drug, AEs were predominantly mild or moderate and transient. AEs potentially related to abuse were not correlated to other measures of abuse potential and did not differ among groups. There were no differences in VAS scores and no indication of abuse on the MADDERS®. Among 354 patients who participated in the safety withdrawal assessment, change from baseline on the PWC, COWS, and SOWS were not clinically meaningful and did not differ between groups.\n\nConclusion: In two contemporary, Phase III, double blind, placebo-controlled, MDD studies of REL-1017, there were no indications of meaningful abuse potential or dependence.\n\nFunding/financial disclosures: Not provided.\n\nPharmaceutical Pipeline of BI 1358894: Clinical Evidence for an Emerging Drug for the Treatment of Mental Health Conditions\n\nAuthors: Brittney Starling,1 James Cronican,1 Stefan Just,2 Lauren Liss,3 Irina Adamczyk,3* Sigurd D. Suessmuth,3 Jennifer Dwyer1\n\n*Presenting author\n\nAffiliations: 1Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Ridgefield, CT; 2Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co. KG, Biberach an der Riss, Germany; 3Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, Ingelheim am Rhein, Germany\n\nBackground/Objective: Amygdala hyperreactivity is thought to be a major contributor to anxiety and mood disorders, with associations to both posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). Inhibition of transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) 4/5 ion channels, which are highly expressed in human and rodent amygdalae, may reduce anxiety and stress-related symptoms by reducing amygdala hyperreactivity. Here, we provide an overview of early studies into BI 1358894, a small molecule inhibitor of TRPC4/5 ion channels, which may provide a novel mechanism of attenuating amygdala hyperreactivity to treat symptoms in disorders such as PTSD and MDD.\n\nDesign: Five Phase I studies were performed in healthy male volunteers. The pharmacodynamic effects of BI 1358894 versus placebo were assessed following cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK-4) administration to induce panic symptoms in healthy volunteers. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to investigate the effects of BI 1358894 on amygdala reactivity in patients with MDD during exposure to negative emotional faces and scenes.\n\nResults: Across the clinical studies, BI 1358894 200mg or less was generally well tolerated. Compared to placebo, BI 1358894 reduced the physiological and psychological response to CCK-4, measured by the Panic Symptom Scale and levels of stress biomarkers (adrenocorticotropic hormone and serum cortisol), indicating target engagement. A fMRI study in patients with MDD demonstrated that BI 1358894 attenuated activity in the amygdala in response to negative emotional faces and scenes.\n\nConclusion: Ongoing Phase II trials will determine the potential of BI 1358894 in the treatment of PTSD and MDD.\n\nFunding/financial disclosures: This study was funded by Boehringer Ingelheim (1402-0001, NCT03210272; 1402-0002, NCT03754959; 1402-0003, NCT03854578; 1402-0005, NCT03904576; 1402-0008, NCT03875001).
