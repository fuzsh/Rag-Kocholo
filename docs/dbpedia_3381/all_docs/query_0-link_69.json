        "text": "The current Sports era is increasing the build and renovations of Stadiums. Fortunately, stadiums construction provides significant benefits. For example, Stadium construction has a positive impact on the neighborhood because it increases the housing values in the surrounding era (C. Tu , 2005). Furthermore, at the spatial level, the construction of stadiums in US and Europe has started to support the emergence of Gradual Polycentric Configurations in many cities. By so doing, the construction of Stadium can minimize the risk of structured inequalities and spatial disparities that in turn could accelerate the build of 5 Zero City. Fortunately, this spatial shift could be accelerated by current Transportation Revolution. In fact, James Michael Walker (2018) focused on the shift away from the Oil-centric and Human driver Cars, Planes, Trucks and Trains to the Clean-Electric and Fully Autonomous Passengers Cars, Planes, Trucks and Trains as Game changer of the 21st century because it could provide significant Land Gains that could help build more Stadiums and other Sports Facilities in both core (downtown) and Peripheral areas on the one hand and reduce emissions on the second hand. Furthermore, this spatial shift could be reinforced by current Creative economy era, Informational age, emergence of sports tourism, Golden age for branding and City-centric and Corporate-centric Capitalism, Democracy and Diplomacy because they could make it easier to locate Sports venues in both Downtown and peripheral areas. This trend has started to be extended at the global level because Sports-related Development has started to be used in many Emerging Markets Economies in order to increase their urbanization level and attractiveness. In fact, Sporting mega-events are legitimate strategies and catalysts for social and economic development in emerging economies such as India, China, South Africa and Brazil (Curi et al., 2011 ; Darnell, 2012). Furthermore, such events serve to enhance these nation's power, economic competitiveness, and prestige in global relations (Maharaj, 2015) with the presumed outcome of attracting international investment, positive media and increased tourism (Curi et al., 2011 ; Coakely & Souza, 2013). However, Stadium construction and usage in US is stimulating significant Land, Water, Material, Carbon and Noise Footprint. Regarded to the Material Footprint, according to WM (2014), stadiums and arenas generate substantial amounts of waste materials from event activity as well as venue construction. This often necessitates the creation of dedicated management programs for fibers (paper products, cardboard), plastics (beverage containers, low density polyethylene films, mixed rigid plastics), scrap metals (ferrous and non-ferrous), organic materials (landscape trimmings, food waste), universal waste (bulbs, batteries), construction waste (concrete, scrap wood) and intermittent special waste like harardous materials. Empirically, Porteshawer (2009) found that during both their construction and general usage, sports stadiums create a number of environmental problems. For example, he found that construction projects in the United States, including sports stadiums, consume 60 % of the nation's raw materials annually. He also found that many of the products that go into stadiums' interiors and exteriors, both during and after construction, also contribute to the detrimental environmental effects of these projects. Furthermore, Sara C. Bronin (2008) found that often, these construction projects fail to use recylced or local products that could reduce their environmental impact. Regarded to the waste, Waste Management (WM) estimates that the four major professional leagues (NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL) generate approximatively 35,000 metric tons of CO2 each year from their fans' waste activities alone. Waste is also becoming a challenge for the MSEs. In fact, Sixtine Morin (2019) found that the construction of the Olympic Village for the 2016 Rio Games generated some 1.6 million tonnes of CO2e while an estimated 14 million meals were served throughout the games, producing 180,000 tonnes of CO2e. Furthermore, she found that the Brazilian government estimates that the preparation of the infrastructure for its 2014 World Cup generated 1.4 million tonnes of CO2e. She also that during the 2018 Russian World Cup, food and beverages accounted for the second biggest portion of GHG emissions-generating 105,695 tonnes of CO2e. Furthermore, during the 2016 Rio Olympics, an estimated 14 million meals were served throughout the games, producing 180,000 tonnes of CO2e. Moreover, beside the waste, Regarded to the Water footprint, Alice Henly et al. (2012 found Sports stadiums can impact the environment due to the volume of water simply needed for day-to-day operations. Accordingly, Alliance To Save Energy (2012) found that the average MLB stadium uses approximately twelve million gallons of water per year. Furthermore, NRDC (2012) found that special events require much more water, such as the 2012 NHL Winter Classic held in Philadelphia's Citizen's Bank Park, where 3.5 million gallons of water were consumed over a period of several days.Regarded to the Sport-related Noise Pollution, the current Noise Culture in Sports is generating Noise Footprint that is affecting the health of fans because excessive noise causes headaches, fatigue, heart problems, and hearing loss. Furthermore, Crowd noise in stadium affects the performance of Coaches, Players and Referees. Kevin Bhimani (2015) found that when coaches are subjected to the high levels of noise, they may not be able to convey instructions to their players on the field accurately. Miscommunication between the coaches on the sidelines and players on the field has led to the usage of hand gestures and signs in order to give direction, thus eliminating sound from the equation. Moreover, Crowd noise stimulates mental and behavioral disorders that force the referees to take decisions that benefits Home Team at the expense of the Away Team. In this case, Crowd noise can be viewed as « soft corruption » that goes against the spirit of sport on the one hand and the mission of referees on the second hand. In fact, Kevin Bhimani (2015) found that referees are trained to not be influenced by crowd noise and to make objective calls at all times based on what they see. As a result, it has become relevant to build Personalized, Flexible, Clean, Safe, Healthy, Green, Smart and Connected 5 Zero Stadium. In order to fix the Noise Footprint Stadium, this new generation of Stadium could encourage « Hear Protection strategies ».Fortunately, some solutions have started to emerge. They love from Disposable Foam Plugs that is less environmentally-friendly to « Reusable Plugs » that is currently produced by Dynamic Ear Company (DEC) formed in 2006 to develop its patented Dynamic Sound Technology (a mechatronic, automatically variable, passive attenuator). However, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommends limiting exposure to noise of 90 decibels and above to no more than one hour. Furthermore, Noise Free America( 2017) found that the NFL should not be promoting noise. Neverthless, these above solutions could help build Zero Noise and Healthy Stadiums. Key words : Sports era ; Stadium Construction ; Sports-related noise pollution, Carbon, Land, Material and Water Footprint of Stadium Construction ; Spatial Distribution of Stadium.\n\nMajor Sporting Events in Europe are having high emissions. Unfortunately, like in Services in general, Transportation services are becoming the major contributor to the emission of the Major Sporting Events in Europe. The same trend has been found also with Major Sporting Events like World Cup and Olympic Games. In fact, 2010, 2014 and 2018 World Cups have been found to have high carbon footprint. However, like the above findings, Sports-related Transportation services are becoming the major contributor to the carbon footpring of the MSEs. For example, Dolf and Teehan (2015) found that in 2010 Olympic Winter Games in Vancouver, 268,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions were generated with transportation modes to and from the event representing 70 % or 187,000 metric tons of those emissions. Furthermore, Death (2011) and Hayes and Horne (2011) found that in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, transportation contributed 2.8 million metric tons of CO2 emissions, accounting for 86 % of the overall emissions. South African Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism and the Norvegian Embassy in South Africa (2009) also found that International transport of spectators and players on the one hand and other transport-everyone involved on the second hand did account for almost 80 % of the emissions while Energy use in accommodation did account for almost 15 % of the emission. Moreover, FIFA (2014) found that the most significant contributor to the 2014 World Cup emission was transport (83.7%), followed by accommodation (5.7%), temporary facilities (4.1%), and food and beverage consumed during the matches (2.3%) (cf. Table 2). In addition, FIFA (2018) found that 56 % of the total estimated emissions for the 2018 FIFA World Cup originate from the travel of international attendees. Nevertheless, trend goes beyond the fans attendees the MSEs but also tends to be the major characteristics of institutions and organizations that are taking part of the MSEs. In fact, FIFA (2012) focused on the forward-looking estimate of the potential carbon emissions of the FIFA World CUP TV Productions and found that International travel accounted for 61 % of the emissions because mainly done by plane that has high carbon footprint than other mode of transportation (James Michael Walker, 2019). Air freight and Equipment are respectively ranked second and third as they accounted respectively for 15 % and 9 % of emissions. However, Sports-related Transportation services are not the only major contributor to the EF of Sports Industry. Accordingly, Kellison and Mondello (2012) found that transportation to an from sporting events is not the only contributing factor to CO2 emissions. The major contributors include Sports-venues services, Sport-related Food Services, Sport-related Construction work Services, and Sport-related Accommodation services. For example in the case of Europe, not only Major Sporting Events in UK have high emissions but also they've have significant land, water and material footprint. Furthermore, Construction are also factors that contribute to CO2 emissions ( Dolf and Teehan, 2015 ; Kellison and Mondello, 2012 and McCullough and Kellison , 2016). Empirically, Casper and Pfahl (2015) found that American collegiate football events share the aforementioned sporting event characteristics. For example, they found that spectators consume a variety of food and beverages during sporting events, resulting in the generation of waste that must be disposed of, which contribute to the release of CO2 emissions. Furthermore, recent studies found that in terms of facility use during sporting events, stadiums require energy in order to function effectively, with increased usage of air conditioning, water and electricity. Key words : Major Sporting Events ; Sports-related Transportation services ; The emission of the Sports-related Transportation services.\n\nSporting events are means of entertainment that have gained tremendous popularity in the US throughout the last century ( Funk et al. , 2007 and Kaplanidou and Vogt , 2007). For example, a ccording to the NRDC, in 2011 Major League Baseball's 73 million fans went to 2,430 regular season games. Furthermore, Statista (2019) found that during the 2018/19 League, the average per game attendance of the 5 major sports leagues such as NFL, MLB, MLS, NBA and NHL was respectively 67042 ; 28794 ; 21873 ; 17857 and 17456 (cf. Table 1) Unfortunately, this popularity has an ecological cost. In fact, James Michael Walker (2019) focused on the Ecological Footpring of Services. He did found the existence of two categories of Services : the ones with high EF and the ones with low EF. The ones with high EF include US Army, Transportation services, Food and Food products, Contruction work, Healthcare services and the Residential services due to the energy use in housings and buildings and their emissions. The ones with low EF include Educational and Training Services, Banking and Financial Services, Sports Industry among others. Empirical evidence of this finding has started to be found in Sports Industry. In fact, Transportation services are becoming the major contributor to the emission of Collegiate Football events in US, UK and Canada because travel accounts for more than 70 % of the emissions. Travel emissions are particularly high when most of the trip is made by air. As a result, reducing the share of air travel could reduce not only the air trip emissions but also the one of Collegiate Sporting events in general. In fact, while using the Life-Cycle Approach (LCA) in order to analyze the travel patterns of spectators and teams attending sports events at the University of British Columbia (UBC), Matt Dolf and Paul Teehan (2015) found that UBC spectators had a smaller footprint. Although only 4 % of the spectators travelled by air, this constituted 52 % of total spectator impact. Then, the major ecological challenge facing the Collegiate Sporting Events in UK, US and Canada remains the adoption of the Oil-centric and Human-driver-pilot Cars, Planes, Trucks, Ships and Trains that is making it easier for the Transportation emissions to remain the major contributor of the above mentioned events. It's also the case for US Major Sports Events. In fact, according to NRDC’s Allen Hershkowitz, a senior scientist, on a pie chart of major U.S. climate impacts, sports are unlikely to show up. The total annual greenhouse gas emissions from all NHL games, including team travel and league operations, for instance, is estimated at slightly more than 500,000 tons annually. That compares with a single coal power plant’s emissions, which can range as high as 23 million tons per year. However, like in all services, Transportation services, Food and Food products, Contruction work, Healthcare services and the Residential services due to the energy use in housings and buildings are becoming ones of the major contributor to the emissions of the Major Sports Events in US (James Michael Walker , 2019). Empirically, regarded to the emission of the Transportation services, Bsales and Sarkis (2012) did focus on the travel emissions per game (vehicles only) and found that Dodger (Stadium) with its 16,000 cars with 960,000 miles driven generated 828,459 CO2e(Ibs) per game in 2012 (cf. Table 1). MetLife (NY Jets and Giants) hit a record. In fact, its 23,800 vehicles with 1,428,000 total miles driven generated 1,232,332 CO2e(Ibs) per game in 2012. Regarded to the EF of the Residential services, Sports venues such as Stadiums not only have started to have significant energy cost but also their emissions have started to be very high due to the consumption of the Carbon-intensive energy. In fact, according to Hershkowitz, energy and waste costs are a major expense for the teams that incur them. Accordingly, Brendam Koerner (2007) found that a football stadium that seats approximatively 78,000 fans, for example, will consume about 65,000 kilowatt hours of electricity and 35, 000 cubic feet of natural gas on game day. Furthermore, Mettle Fatigue (2019) found that the 2012 Super Bowl hosted in Indianapolisused roughly 15,000 megawatt hours of electricity. This is enough electricity to power nearly 1,400 average homes in the United States for one year. This amount of electricity consumed does not include the electricity used by the 111.3 million people that watched the game on television. This number increased to 115.5 million people for this past year’s Super Bowl. Moreover, Mettle Fatigue (2019) found that the excess amount of electricity used is not only for the Super Bowl. For example, on a typical game day in Dallas, their AT&T Stadium consumes roughly more electricity than the whole country of Liberia. Unfortunately, by using carbon-intensive energy, the energy uses by Sports venues in US tends to have significant emissions. In fact, Waste Management (WM) estimates that the four major professional leagues (NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL) generate approximately 35,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) each year from their fans' waste activities. Therefore, there's not any choice than accelerate the move of US Sports towards Green one in order to guarantee its sustainability. In fact, what will be the EF of 181 million fans in US that are visiting the US top 200 stadiums each year. And what will be the case if we considere all the case of all the stadiums of US ? Furthermore, what will be the EF of the Sports industry if all the fans visiting sports venues each years including the Millennials are back to the Stadiums ? In other words, imagine the EF of more than 250 millions to 300 millions Americans visiting US Sports venues per year. Key Words : Sporting events ; Sports Era ; The Ecological Footprint of Sports Events ; Transportation Services."
