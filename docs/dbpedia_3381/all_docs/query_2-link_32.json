        "text": "Administration 7/19/2023 9:49:00 AM\n\nJMU Athletics Celebrates Successes of 2022-2023 in New Conferences\n\nJames Madison Athletics has established consistent success throughout its history with a marked increase beginning with the 2015-2016 school year. That rise includes an all-sports record (.646) that ranks among the top 20 in the nation, top 100 LEARFIELD Director's Cup rankings and routinely capturing multiple conference titles and vaulting 6-8 teams annually into NCAA competition.\n\nSuch consistent and widespread success earned new opportunities for the 2022-2023 competitive year with a new home in the Sun Belt Conference (SBC) for most sports along with lacrosse moving to the American Athletic Conference (AAC), swimming and diving to the Coastal Collegiate Sports Association (CCSA) and field hockey taking on top competition as an independent program.\n\nThe results of the past year continued JMU's pattern of balanced competitive excellence while validating a move to align with peer institutions, which included rising to college football's highest level, the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS). In its first season of FBS competition, JMU went 8-3 overall and 6-2 in the Sun Belt, finishing first in the loaded East Division and setting a new standard for transitioning from FCS to FBS while earning an AP national ranking of 25th.\n\nJMU captured its first Sun Belt regular season and tournament championships in volleyball and later added the same titles in women's basketball. The Dukes also earned the AAC regular season title in lacrosse, becoming the first team other than Florida to claim the honors. Lacrosse reached the quarterfinal round of the NCAA Championship and finished with a top-10 national ranking. Volleyball, women's basketball and lacrosse were joined by swimming and diving, track and field and women's golf as programs competing in NCAA Championships.\n\nOverall, JMU posted a .655 winning percentage across all of its sports to rank second in the Commonwealth of Virginia by a narrow margin behind Virginia (.659). The Dukes placed second in the Bubas Cup, the Sun Belt's ranking of success in all sports among all 14 member institutions. James Madison was the only school in the league with every sport finishing .500 or better and had a league-high five teams compete in SBC title games. The Dukes were third among Sun Belt teams and 147th overall in the Director's Cup standings, with ineligibility for football bowl game participation impacting the potential for more points.\n\nAcademically, student-athletes across the department posted a 3.184 cumulative GPA. There were 91 total President's List honors and 195 total Dean's List honors for JMU student-athletes and 133 graduates for the year. JMU also posted a single-year APR of 993 while 11 of 17 programs had a 1,000 single-year score and all 17 hit the department benchmark of 960 or higher in the multi-year score.\n\n2022-23 By the Numbers/Department Snapshot\n\n.655 winning % all sports\n\n147th in Learfield Director's Cup final standings, third in Sun Belt\n\n3 conference regular season titles\n\n6 NCAA appearances\n\n3.184 Department GPA\n\n92 NCAA Graduation Success Rate\n\n72% Department Federal Success Rate\n\nAll 17 programs hit department goal of 960 or higher in multi-year APR\n\n11 of 17 programs achieved perfect 1,000 single-year APR\n\n993 department single-year APR\n\n91 President's List and 195 Dean's List Student-Athletes\n\n133 Graduates (Winter 2022, Spring 2023, anticipated Summer 2023)\n\n731 student-athletes achieved a 3.0 semester grade point average in at least one semester (includes duplications)\n\n6,352 department hours of community service, including 25th of 100+ Division I Helper-Helper schools and fifth in the Sun Belt\n\n7 All-Americans\n\n36 College Sports Communicators Academic All-District\n\n8 Conference Players of the Year\n\n3 Conference Coaches of the Year\n\n4 student-athletes drafted in professional drafts while 11 additional former student-athletes had their first professional opportunities.\n\nAccomplishments\n\nJMU teams have compiled a 220-114-9 cumulative record for a .655 winning percentage. Over the past 8 years combined, the Dukes have won at a .646 clip across all sports, a figure that ranks top-20 nationally among all Division I programs. JMU narrowly finished second (.659 to .655) among the 14 Division I institutions in Virginia, achieving its 10th top-three finish in the last 11 years. The Dukes led all Commonwealth women's sports with a .704 winning percentage (139-57-5) and ranked third among men's sports with a .585 mark (81-57-4).\n\nJMU finished second in the standings for The Bubas Cup, which is awarded by the Sun Belt to the best overall institution for competitive success, as measured by Sun Belt-sponsored sports. JMU's score was boosted by first place in volleyball and women's basketball, second in women's tennis, third in cross country, a tie for third in both football and women's soccer and fourth in men's basketball. JMU was the only Sun Belt school to have every sport finish .500 or better.\n\nMultiple sports are not included in the Sun Belt. It was announced on Nov. 10, 2022 that swimming and diving will compete in the CCSA for the 2022-2023 competitive year. Lacrosse joined the American Athletic Conference for 2022-2023 and immediately won the league's regular season title. Field hockey competed as an independent for the 2022 season and will continue independent in 2023 before joining the Mid-American Conference (MAC) in 2024.\n\nJMU ranked 147th in the final Learfield Director's Cup, which measures NCAA postseason success. JMU finished third among the 14 Sun Belt schools, despite having no access to points for FBS bowl participation, whereas JMU's previous top-100 rankings were boosted by deep FCS football runs. JMU was also fifth among Virginia institutions.\n\nJMU had three teams ranked in national polls in 2022-2023 with field hockey entering the top 25 on Sept. 13, rising as high as 17th on Oct. 4 and finishing 22nd. Football received votes in both the coaches and AP polls on Sept. 25 before then achieving the first AP national ranking in program history at No. 25 on Oct. 9. Lacrosse began the season ranked 12th in preseason top-25 polls and rose as high as fourth. Volleyball also received votes in the AVCA Poll on Nov. 21, which is unofficially the first votes appearance in the Division I poll in program history. Three fall sports were regionally ranked with cross country as high as 14th in their region, men's soccer ninth and women's soccer 10th. Both men's and women's basketball achieved rankings in the College Insider Mid-Major Top 25 Polls with the women as high as sixth and the men as high as 15th. Track and field was also regionally ranked as high as 14th in the spring and was joined by women's tennis fifth in its region.\n\nIn major professional sports drafts, Tyler Clegg of men's soccer was the 27th pick of the third round (85th overall) in the 2022 MLS SuperDraft in December. Joe Vogatsky was a 14th round pick (424 overall) of the Toronto Blue Jays in the Major League Baseball Draft. Mairead Durkin of lacrosse was drafted and selected to play in the 2023 Athletes Unlimited lacrosse season. During the June 2023 XFL Draft, the Vegas Vipers selected Jamare Edwards from the 2022 Dukes' squad. Several former JMU football players also factored heavily into the 2022 XFL Draft in November with Ben DiNucci selected in the first stage of the draft by the Seattle Sea Dragons. In the formal draft, Rashard Davis joined DiNucci in Seattle in the seventh round (No. 54) of the offensive portion while John Daka was picked in the second round (No. 13) on defense by the Houston Roughnecks. Recent grad Liam Fornadel was taken in the ninth round of the offensive line draft (No. 72) by the D.C. Defenders.\n\nIn other pro sports updates, Kevin Kelly was a Rule V Draft selection of the Colorado Rockies and quickly sold to the Tampa Bay Rays. In late March, Kelly officially made the MLB roster and made his pro debut in early April, becoming the 13th Major Leaguer in JMU baseball history. In early June, Nick Robertson was called up by the Dodgers to become the 14th JMU Major Leaguer. Jack Cone promptly followed his spring season by signing with the Washington Wild Things of the independent Frontier League as did Kyle Novak with the Joliet Slammers. Several players from JMU's 2022 football squad had NFL camp invites, including: Kris Thornton, Devin Ravenel, Todd Centeio, Jordan Swann and Terrance Greene. Swann signed a contract with the Baltimore Ravens as a result, while Centeio signed with the XFL's Orlando Guardians. Former kicker and all-time NCAA record-holder Ethan Ratke signed his first pro contract with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the CFL. Following a successful season with the XFL's Seattle Sea Dragons, Ben DiNucci signed with the Denver Broncos for 2023. Liam Fornadel was named All-League in the XFL with the D.C. Defenders. Kat Buchanan signed to compete with Athletes Unlimited lacrosse. Both Ebony Wiseman and Iris Rabot made professional women's soccer debuts with Wiseman on Coventry United Women FC of the Barclay's Women's Championship and Rabot on Pomigliano C.F. of Series A.\n\nJMU continued its upward fundraising trajectory, collecting $4.7 million in annual fund donations and $6.3 million in total giving for FY23. Those figures come after hitting $4 million in FY22 ($5 million total fundraising) and $2.9 million in FY21. The figures are highlighted by a jump of over 1,000 total donors from just shy of 4,600 in FY22 to 5,633 in FY23. The department collected $231,153 as part of its annual giving event, this year a week-long campaign dubbed \"Reaching New Heights.\" The campaign featured more than 500 gifts, including more than 40 first-time gifts.\n\nOn June 14, JMU celebrated its JMA Awards, with top honors going to Male Athlete of the Year Todd Centeio of football and Female Athlete of the Year Isabella Peterson of lacrosse.

Oct. 26, JMU and Old Dominion announced a formal partnership with TowneBank for the TowneBank Royal Rivalry Challenge, forming a year-long, all-sports rivalry between the schools with a trophy awarded to the program with the best record in head-to-head competition across all sports. JMU won the first competition 16.5-7.5.\n\nJMU set a program record with 7,708 season tickets for football in its first Sun Belt season in 2022. A Bridgeforth Stadium single-game attendance record was broken on Oct. 22 against Marshall with 26,159 fans in attendance. JMU ranked 86th out of 131 teams in attendance in its first FBS season with an average of 22,966 per game, which ranked fourth in the Sun Belt.\n\nOn May 16, JMU announced a record for priority deadline football season ticket sales of 8,125 for the 2023 season, topping the previous priority deadline high of 6,241 by 30% and passing the previous year-end total of 7,708. After the priority deadline, season tickets hit capacity at 8,718 in July.\n\nFootball went 8-3 in its transitional FBS season and finished in first place in the East Division of the Sun Belt, though ineligible to earn the East's spot in the league championship due to transitioning rules. Memorable accomplishments included a 44-7 domination of Middle Tennessee in JMU's first-ever FBS game and first time hosting an FBS opponent. The Dukes went on to upend Appalachian State to win their first Sun Belt game and then toppled Texas State for their first home Sun Belt win. JMU became the first program ever in its first season of FBS transition to be AP ranked when it was No. 25 in the Oct. 9 AP Top 25. The Dukes also became just the third transitioning team to go 5-0 in its first season, though the other two played multiple FCS opponents to achieve the 5-0 mark. JMU clinched first place in the Sun Belt East by routing No. 23 Coastal Carolina 47-7 in its final game, which also marked the program's first home win over an AP-ranked program. Quarterback Todd Centeio was added to both the Maxwell Award and CFPA National Performer of the Year midseason watch lists, each representing awards given to the top player in college football. He was later added to both the Manning Award and Davey O'Brien Award watch lists for top quarterback performances. Wide receiver Kris Thornton was also a mid-season add to the Biletnikoff Watch List for best pass catcher. Thornton and Isaac Ukwu were recognized as All-Americans. On the day following the CFP National Championship, ESPN ranked JMU No. 24 on its \"way too early\" 2023 preseason national rankings.\n\nMedia coverage of JMU football quickly validated the relevancy gained by playing FBS football. Over the course of the full 2022 season, JMU generated nearly 12,000 media mentions for a total publicity value of $24.1 million, a reach among traditional circulation of 920.6 million and a digital circulation of 13.9 billion. JMU made a quick impression with its 44-7 win over Middle Tennessee to open the 2022 season generating $1.5 million worth of paid media coverage, including $1 million on the single day of the win. There were 110 media mentions for a reach of 13.6 million as well as 1,100 social media mentions for a reach of 1.3 million to go with 4.2 million total impressions.

The Dukes went 24-5 with a 15-match winning streak headed into the NCAA Tournament and also won the Sun Belt Regular Season Championship. The only Sun Belt loss came with a weekend split at traditional Sun Belt power Texas State early in league play, which snapped the Bobcats' 14-match conference win streak. The Dukes went on to defeat Texas State again in the title match. JMU holds the best RPI in the Sun Belt at 21, which is also the best in program history. The Dukes enter the NCAA Tournemanet with the 18th-best win percentage in the nation.
