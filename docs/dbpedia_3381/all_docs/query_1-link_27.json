Chairing an original ad hoc sports committee formed in late 1984, the initiative quickly led to the creation of the San Antonio Sports Foundation. Ralph Bender was the founding chair. ​\n\nDuring the past decade, Bender has served in such positions as Tri-Chair of the 1989 AAU Junior Olympics, Opening Ceremonies Chair for the 1993 U.S. Olympic Festival, and Co-Chair of the 1995 U.S. National Senior Sports Classic.

Using three Winchester rifles, Toepperwein shot seven hours a day for ten consecutive days at 72,500 two-inch wooding blocks, each pitched to a height of 25 to 30 feet from a firing distance of 25 feet. Not knowing exactly how many blocks he would need for the occasion, he had only 50,000 blocks made, so his last 22,500 shots were at pieces of the original blocks! In ten days of shooting, he missed just nine times. ​\n\nToepperwein retired from shooting performances in 1945 but did not give up shooting until he was in his eighties.
