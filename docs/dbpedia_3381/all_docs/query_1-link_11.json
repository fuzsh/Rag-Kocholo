        "text": "This article originally appeared in the January/February 2016 issue of SELF.\n\nAlex Morgan is one of the fastest players on the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team. But she wants to be even faster. She is a woman with #Goals, big-time. Today she is charging hard inside a warehouselike gym in Orlando, Florida, where she's training with her off-season performance and speed specialist, Dan Schuck. I watch as Morgan sprints down the field—her 5-foot-7 frame leaning forward, her arms tucked in and pumping fast—at a pace that seems almost...human. Until I notice that she's tethered to Schuck with a dual resistance band around both their waists. As Morgan runs forward, Schuck attempts to rein her in, using his own body weight to counter Morgan's power. Despite the challenge to her natural velocity, she still blazes ahead, ponytail flying like a whip. Eight intervals later, she stops for a break. \"Do I think I can get better?\" Morgan asks, with a determined grin. \"Yes, I think I can.\"\n\nMorgan, 26, has always been on the fast track. Since becoming the youngest member of Team USA at the age of 22, Morgan has scored 52 goals in 91 international games. At the 2012 Olympics, she netted the game-winning goal in the last 45 seconds of the semifinal. It's moments like those—when the stadium is packed and tension is high—that Morgan excels. \"My favorite goals are the ones when there's so much pressure,\" she says. \"I focus more when the game is on the line.\" Last July, Morgan and her team found themselves in exactly that situation, as they defeated Japan 5–2 in the World Cup final. That match averaged a record 26.7 million viewers, making it the most-watched soccer game—men's or women's—in U.S. television history. And you can bet that many of them tuned in to catch a glimpse of Morgan, the team's speed-queen forward, number 13.\n\nStill, Morgan takes her soccer stardom in stride. \"I always tried to make my family proud,\" she says. \"My motivation was winning and proving that I belong on a team.\" Early in her training, Morgan came up with a list of goals: Make the women's national team, win an Olympic gold medal, win the World Cup. Check, check, check—and she did it all by age 26. \"I always felt those things were out of reach,\" she says now, taking a minute to absorb what she's accomplished.\n\nBut in 2016, Morgan finds herself in a unique position: What do you do when you've achieved every seemingly unreachable objective you put out there, and you have yet to reach the peak of your career? \"You hit the reset button,\" she says. And you set a few more seemingly unreachable goals.\n\nThe youngest of three sisters, Morgan was raised in Diamond Bar, California, about 30 miles east of Los Angeles. In 1999, when she was 10, the United States won the Women's World Cup; Morgan began idolizing players like Mia Hamm and Kristine Lilly. \"They weren't just cool girls whose concerts you could go to and sing along with,\" says Morgan, who grew up with Britney Spears posters on her walls. \"Mia and Kristine were badass, and they made me want to play with them and be on their team.\"\n\nMorgan played multiple sports as a teen but excelled in soccer at Diamond Bar High, where she was an all-American. \"I could always score goals. I loved that feeling of having your team look to you, that feeling of leadership,\" she says. At one point, Morgan's father, Mike, created a game for her and her older sisters, Jenny and Jeri. He attached points to specific goals: grades, charity work, sports achievements, anything that would positively affect his daughters' futures. The points would translate into dollars toward a new car for college (yes, major incentive). Jenny got a lot of As and asked for a Mercury sedan. Jeri got good grades and made the cheerleading squad: She got a Chevy truck. But Alex took the game to another level. She made the honor roll and scored so many goals on the soccer field that she walked away with a Lexus 350.\n\nDress, $265, and jacket (around waist), $595; Lacoste.com.

While there, she racked up all-Pac-10 honors and was a 2010 all-American. After graduating, she turned pro and in 2011 joined the women's national team, where she bonded with teammates who supported and encouraged one another. Especially Abby Wambach, who recently retired but was Morgan's wingwoman on the field. \"Having a partnership is so important, and we had chemistry right away,\" Morgan says of Wambach. \"She was always super positive, telling me, 'Take that shot. I know you have it in you. You're going to break all my records and score more goals than I will.' She instilled that confidence in me from day one.\"\n\nAnd from day one, Morgan has been explosive on the field. Whether the race is 5 yards or 50, whether she has a ball on her feet or not, Morgan will win. Women are inspired by her; parents everywhere are driving their daughters to Sunday-morning soccer practice because their little girls want to be her.\n\nFive years in, Morgan is eager to show that a female athlete's fingerprints—or, in her case, footprints—can extend far beyond the field. \"I want young girls to dream about being professional soccer players instead of just watching the boys go out and play,\" she says. She has written a series for young readers, The Kicks, designed to empower this audience. (The next book will be published in March.) \"It's about seeing girls be confident in what they want to pursue,\" Morgan says. With 2.7 million followers on Instagram and a slew of sponsorships—Nike, Coca-Cola, Beats by Dr. Dre—Morgan is redefining what a smart, successful soccer player can do.\n\nSo what is next? There is an upcoming Olympics to win this summer, in Rio de Janeiro. And a World Cup after that in 2019, in France. But for the moment, Morgan says she has another priority: \"working on myself.\" And enjoying a little downtime. Last winter, she married her longtime boyfriend, Servando Carrasco, a midfielder for the Orlando City team. Their chaotic schedules—Morgan trains up to seven days a week during the season—can present a challenge. \"I'm never just on the couch. Being busy is part of who I am,\" she says. \"But it's hard juggling my family, my husband, balancing that time.\"\n\nTheir lives are more in sync now that Morgan was traded in October from the Portland Thorns to the Orlando Pride, which lets her and Carrasco live in the same city. \"Two pro athletes in one family is crazy, but it's our normal!\" she says. They make it work by motivating each other and not letting fame get in the way. \"We don't publicize our relationship that much. We're already in the public eye, so we don't really post pictures of each other on Twitter and Instagram,\" Morgan says. Their bond is tight, as they dated for seven years after meeting at Berkeley. \"He's incredibly supportive, and I think that says something about his character,\" Morgan says. \"You have to be an extremely confident person to be with a really successful woman.\"\n\nA typical date night might involve a simple dinner out. \"My husband is Mexican, and I love Mexican food—guac, sour cream, cheese,\" Morgan says. While she focuses on fueling her body, she doesn't obsess over her diet. \"I try to stay healthy, but I have cravings, too,\" she says. \"Sometimes I want a steak!\"\n\nStaying strong will be key for the next phase of her career. \"I'll play for as long as my body can last at this level,\" says Morgan. \"My goal is to become the best player in the world. Or the best player I can bring out in myself.\" Her fans—and future soccer stars—will be watching. \"When I leave the game, I want to go out on top,\" Morgan says. \"I want to know that I made women's soccer better than it was when I came into it.\"\n\nShirt, $125; JohnGalliano.com.
