        "text": "Once upon time there was a large country named Yugoslavia.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslavia\n\nYugoslavia is a term that describes three political entities that existed successively on the western part of the Balkans, during most of the 20th century. The constituent six Socialist Republics and two Socialist Autonomous Provinces that made up the country were: SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, SR Croatia, SR Macedonia, SR Montenegro, SR Slovenia and SR Serbia (including the autonomous provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo which after 1974 were largely equal to the other members of the federation. Starting in 1991, the SFRY disintegrated in the Yugoslav Wars which followed the secession of most of the country's constituent entities. The next Yugoslavia, known as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, existed until 2003, when it was renamed Serbia and Montenegro.\n\nYugoslavia was a very good football team during that time. It consisted from players of all republics: SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, SR Croatia, SR Macedonia, SR Montenegro, SR Slovenia and SR Serbia (including the autonomous provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo. At the end of this saga, Serbia got all titles. I will make a demographic analyze and ethnicity of players in Yugoslavian national football team since 1930-1941 and since 1945-1990.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslavia_national_football_team\n\nWorld Cup record\n\n1930 FIFA World Cup: Yugoslavia entered in semifinals, achieved 4th place.\n\nSquad of Yugoslavia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1930_FIFA_World_Cup_squads#.C2.A0Yugoslavia\n\nYugoslavia had 17 players:\n\n16 players were pure Serbians, one was of mixed German/Czech ethnicity Ivan Bek. Head coach of Yugoslavia Boško Simonović was Serbian.\n\nYugoslavia scored 7 goals and received 7 goals on 1950 FIFA World Cup.\n\nSerbian players scored: 4 goals\n\nGerman/Czech player scored: 3 goals\n\nSerbian goalkeeper received: 7 goals\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1930_FIFA_World_Cup\n\n1934 FIFA World Cup and 1938 FIFA World Cup Yugoslavia did not enter on these tournaments.\n\nWorld War II came, Croatia got their Independence. Before the nation's independence, Croatian footballers played for the national teams of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (1919–39) and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (1945–90), though during periods of political upheaval, ethnically Croatian sides sometimes formed to play unofficial matches. A hastily-arranged national side, managed by Hugo Kinert, played a few private domestic matches in 1918–19. In 1940, Jozo Jakopić led an unofficial national team representing the Banovina of Croatia in four friendly matches: two against Switzerland and two against Hungary. Croatia made their debut as an independently sanctioned team by defeating the Swiss 4–0 in Zagreb on April 2, 1940.\n\nFollowing invasion by the Axis powers, the Croatian Football Federation became briefly active, joining FIFA on July 17, 1941 as the Independent State of Croatia. The national side, under the direction of Rudolf Hitrec, played fifteen friendly matches, fourteen as an official FIFA member.\n\nCroatia's first recorded result as a FIFA associate was a 1–1 tie with Slovakia on September 8 in Bratislava. Further matches were played until 1945 when the Independent State of Croatia was abolished and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia assumed control, thereby ending the team's affiliation with FIFA.\n\nFrom 1950 to 1956 another unofficial Croatian team was briefly active; it won games against Indonesia and a Yugoslav team playing as \"Serbia\".The Yugoslavia squad at the 1956 Summer Olympics included Croatian footballers,as did Yugoslavia in World Cup and European Championship tournaments up to 1990.\n\n1950 FIFA World Cup: Yugoslavia entered in Round 1, achieved 5th place.\n\nSquad of Yugoslavia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1950_FIFA_World_Cup_squads#Yugoslavia\n\nHead coach of Yugoslavia was Serbian Milorad Arsenijević.\n\nYugoslavia had 22 players: 8 players were Croatians (Stjepan Bobek, Božo Broketa, Željko Čajkovski, Zlatko Čajkovski, Vladimir Firm, Ivica Horvat, Ivo Radovniković, Bernard Vukas), 12 players were Serbians (Aleksandar Atanacković, Ratko Čolić, Predrag Đajić, Miodrag Jovanović, Prvoslav Mihajlović, Rajko Mitić, Srđan Mrkušić, Tihomir Ognjanov, Branko Stanković, Kosta Tomašević, Siniša Zlatković, Vladimir Beara * (born and raised in Croatian city Sinj, first football steps he made in Croatian club NK Hajduk Split, played 136 matches, but he is ethnical Serb).\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Beara\n\n1 player was Bosnian Muslim Ervin Katnić.\n\n1 player was of Hungarian ethnicity Béla Pálfi.\n\nYugoslavian national team scored 7 goals and received 3 goals on 1950 FIFA World Cup.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1950_FIFA_World_Cup\n\nCroatian players scored: 3 goals\n\nSerbian players scored: 4 goals\n\nSerbian goalkeeper received: 3 goals\n\n1954 FIFA World Cup: Yugoslavia entered in Quarterfinals, achieved 7th place.\n\nSquad of Yugoslavia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_FIFA_World_Cup_squads#Yugoslavia\n\nHead coach: of Yugoslavia was Serbian Aleksandar Tirnanić.\n\nYugoslavia had 22 players: 11 players were Croatians (Tomislav Crnković, Zlatko Čajkovski, Ivan Horvat, Bernard Vukas, Stjepan Bobek, Branko Zebec, Branko Kralj, Bruno Belin, Zlatko Papec, Dionizije Dvornić, Lev Mantula born in Bosnian city Sarajevo, he is of Croatian ethnicity), 10 players were Serbians (Vladimir Beara, Branko Stanković, Vujadin Boškov, Tihomir Ognjanov, Rajko Mitić, Ljubiša Spajić, Sima Milovanov, Miloš Milutinović, Todor Veselinović, Aleksandar Petaković), 1 player was Montenegrin (Miljan Zeković).\n\nYugoslavian national team scored 2 goals and received 3 goals on 1954 FIFA World Cup.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_FIFA_World_Cup\n\nCroatian player scored: 1 goal\n\nSerbian player scored: 1 goal\n\nSerbian goalkeeper received: 3 goals\n\n1958 FIFA World Cup: Yugoslavia entered in Quarterfinals, achieved 5th place.\n\nSquad of Yugoslavia:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1958_FIFA_World_Cup_squads#Yugoslavia\n\nHead coach of Yugoslavia Aleksandar Tirnanić was Serbian.\n\nYugoslavia had 22 players: 6 players were Croatians (Tomislav Crnković, Branko Zebec, Ivan Šantek, Luka Lipošinović, Dražan Jerković, Gordan Irović -

He describes himself as Bosnian, Yugoslavian.\n\nYugoslavia had 22 players: 8 players were Croatians (Tomislav Ivković, Zoran Vulić, Davor Jozić, Alen Bokšić, mixed Croatian/Serbian Robert Prosinečki, Robert Jarni, Davor Šuker, Andrej Panadić), 4 players were Serbians (Vujadin Stanojković - born in Macedonia, Serbian ethnicity, Predrag Spasić, Dragan Stojković, Dragoje Leković), 2 players were Montenegrins (Dragoljub Brnović, Dejan Savićević), 5 players were Bosnian and Herzegovian Muslim players (Faruk Hadžibegić, Safet Sušić, Fahrudin Omerović, Refik Šabanadžović, Mirsad Baljić), 1 player from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Zlatko Vujovic, he represents himself as Croat, but he is probably of Montenegrin heritage, 1 player was Macedonian (Darko Pančev), 1 player was Slovenian\n\n(Srecko Katanec).\n\nYugoslavian national team scored 8 goals and received 6 goals on 1990 FIFA World Cup.\n\nCroatian players scored: 3 goals.\n\nSerbian players scored: 2 goals.\n\nMacedonian player scored: 2 goals.\n\nBosnian Muslim player scored: 1 goal.\n\nIn Quarterfinals Yugoslavia lost against Argentina, after 90 minutes it was 0-0, than they had penalties. Match finished 3-2 for Argentina. These goals are not included.\n\nProsinecki (mixed Croatian/Serbian) and Savicevic (Monetenegrin) scored their penalties.\n\nStojkovic (Serbian), Brnovic (Montenegrin), Hadzibegic (Bosnian Muslim) missed their penalties.\n\n1990. Yugoslavia fall a part. All titles and results from these World Cups went in Serbia as their own results. These informations prove historic injustice.\n\nTomislav Piplica is born in Bosnia, city Bugojno.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomislav_Piplica\n\nBut he is ethnical Croatian. Bosnian nationality for real doesn't exist. There are three large ethnical groups; Muslims are the biggest, Serbian Orthodox are second and third ethnical group are Croatian Catholics, but Croatians aren't accepted as third nation. Bosnia and Herzegovina has many minority groups:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina\n\n48.0% Bosniaks = Muslims, but they don't like the Muslim name. Bosniak is Croatian ancient name for Bosnian inhabitant.\n\n37.1% Serbs,\n\n14.3% Croats,\n\n0.6% others\n\nBosniak - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosniaks\n\nBosnian Muslims stole the name Bosniak from Croatian medieval times. They even stole Croatian king of Bosnia Tvrtko I. as their important figure in their history.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tvrtko_Kotromanić\n\nHe ruled before Ottoman Empire came in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nHe was member of House of Kotromanić, which is Croatian family. But when you steal territory why not steal rulers.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Kotromanić\n\nCroatians ruled first in whole Bosnia and Herzegovina, than Serbs came because they lost the battle against Ottoman Empire and Croats protected them. That's why Bosnia and Herzegovina will always be Croatian historical regions, because we came there first.\n\nBattle of Kosovo - Serbs today celebrate this battle even though Ottoman Empire won. Serbs lost all their battles in history. They won only in WW2, but not because their strength, yet because they choose the right side in that war. Croatia lost in WW2, this is the only defeat in our history.\n\nTo bad that I didn't watched that U20 World Cup, Croatian experts often mention that period as healthy football school, it had firm background, style, organisation and talent. It's nice to know that Croatia has many fans in Chile, not only in Croatian community. I remember that you told me that everyone in Chile supported Croatia against Argentina in 1998, on World Cup in France. But Croatia don't have antagonism against Argentina. Because Croatia and Argentina had good relations, that's why Croats left in Argentina, Chile, Peru, Uruguay, Paraguay, Brazil, USA, Canada with some traces in other south and central-american countries.\n\nHave you heard about some older players? I putted also World Cup in Chile 1962.\n\nWhat do you think about this injustice that Serbia got all results from Yugoslavian heritage? Number of Croats and other non-Serbian people in Yugoslavian team depended about political situation. You can see that coaches were always Serbians, only one time Croat ruled on some important level: Ante Mladinic.\n\nFirst world cup was almost completely filled with Serbs. I tried to be objective. Some players that have Serbian or Montenegrin heritage today declare themselves as Croats (Vladimir Beara, Zlatko Vujovic, Zoran Vujovic, Stanko Poklepovic, Pero Nadoveza...and many others) but they don't like to discuss about their heritage. Vladimir Beara was great goalkeeper of Hajduk Split, but I have putted him as Serb in these lists.\n\nSome Croats were born in Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia, but they are ethnical Croats (Tomislav Crnkovic, Luka Lipošinović).\n\nCroatia today has also large number of players that have Bosnian or Herzegovian heritage, but they choose to play for Croatia, because they are ethical Croats.\n\nIvan Kelava - GK of Dinamo Zagreb has heritage from Herzegovina.\n\nJosip Joe Simunic - born in Australia, but his roots are from Bosnian city Kiseljak, ethnical Croat.\n\nVedran Corluka - born in Bosnia, he and his family escaped from Bosnia in Croatia, they were refugees, escaped because Serbians and Muslims attacked Croatian cities in Bosnia.\n\nDejan Lovren - born in Bosnian city Banja Luka.\n\nDarijo Srna - his father Uzeir is Bosnian Muslim. And his mother is maybe Serbian, not sure, but he declares himself as Croat.\n\nLuka Modric - his mother Radojka from Zadar is Serbian, his father Stipe Croat from Zadar. Many Croats died in Zadar during Serbian agression, especially city Skabrnja.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Škabrnja_massacre\n\nThis red zone on the map is territory that Serbs wanted to get and clean that territory of Croatian people. Today on these areas still exists large Serbian community with Zagreb also. Serbs wanted to destroy 100% Croatian cities in that red zone.\n\nIvan Rakitic - born in Switzerland, his father is from Bosnia, mother from Croatia, both ethnical Croats.\n\nOgnjen Vukojevic - born in Croatia, but his name and surname sounds Serbian.\n\nChilean Tierra del Fuego is in Croatian language Ognjena Zemlja. Now you know what Ognjen means - fuego.\n\nIvo Ilicevic - born in Germany, roots are from Bosnia, ethnical Croat.\n\nMilan Badelj - born in Zagreb, Serbian heritage.\n\nMladen Petric - born in Bosnia, lived in Switzerland at his young age, ethnical Croat.\n\nMario Mandzukic - Bosnian heritage, ethnical Croat.\n\nNikica Jelavic - born in Herzegovina, ethnical Croat.\n\nMany of older players have heritage from Bosnia and Herzegovina:\n\nBosnia: Mario Stanic.\n\nWestern Herzegovina: Zvonimir Boban, Davor Suker, Zvonimir Soldo, Nikola Jurcevic, Dario Simic.\n\nYou can see how big importance have Croatian players that have heritage from Bosnia and Herzegovina. 99% of players that play for Bosnia and Herzegovina are Muslims, maybe 3,4 Serbs and 3,4 Croatian that aren't good enough for Croatia and Serbia. In today's squad of Bosnia and Herzegovina:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina_national_football_team\n\nYou have Croats: Boris Pandza, Sasa Papac, Gordan Bunoza, Josip Barišić, Jure Ivanković.\n\nSerbs: Zoran Kokot (Kokot means gallo in spanish), Stevo Nikolic, Boris Raspudic, Dario Puric, Velibor Vasilić, Vule Trivunović, Ognjen Vranješ, Zvjezdan Misimović.\n\nOthers are Muslims.\n\nSome people say that they ara Bosnians, but this as nationality doesn't exist, only in new times. In Bosnia and Herzegovina lives three nations.\n\nEthnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina: More than 95% of population of Bosnia and Herzegovina belongs to one of its three constitutive ethnic groups: Bosniaks (Muslims), Serbs and Croats.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina\n\nIn Slovenia national football team you can find also many players with Muslim, Serbian or Croatian heritage.\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina still doesn't have lyrics for their national anthem, only some melody. Flag is similar to Kosovo flag, they were both products of European Union, because neither side couldn't agreed with colors of the flag.\n\nPiplica played for NT of Bosnia and Herzegovina because no one called him in Croatia. Back than we had great goalkeepers, so he never received any calls. His name Tomislav is the name of first Croatian king Tomislav.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomislav_of_Croatia\n\nHe united Croats from sea and Croats from continental space. His coronation was in West Herzegovina, city Tomislavgrad. Before that city had name Duvno.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duvno\n\nThe Duvno field was place of his coronation. So it's hard to expect that Serbian or Muslim family would gave their child name Tomislav - first Croatian king. Tomislav Piplica shold be catholic. Don't know is he active in the church. Interesting videos, thanks. Croatian team is everywhere well accepted, we played always good football, now we have some crisis, but when Slaven Bilic finally resigns things should be better, because our attackers score every week in European leagues. Also we have some good players in Dinamo Zagreb, Hajduk Split, Lokomotiva, RNK Split, talent is always visible. Our league isn't weak technically, but these clubs need experience in European matches, there is also problem with motivation and sometimes our clubs have bad luck. It would be nice to see Croatia in Poland/Ukraine and Brazil.\n\nIn Croatian media we heard that Zvonimir Boban is gay, but he is married to Croatain woman Leonarda Boban. Also in France was a book about gay Croatian player Goran Klasic who had romantic moments with high school boy Mathieu Varenne in France. This footballer played in PSG in that book. Only Croatian player that played for PSG during 90's is Zlatko Vujovic.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlatko_Vujović\n\nHe is Montenegrin, but he declares himself as Bosnian Croat. He has a borther Zoran Vujovic. These names and last name don't sound Croatian at all. Vujovic sounds more Montenegrin.\n\nSome speculations say that this book is about Zvonimir Boban. I can't say also that this book is a pure imagination, first of all if this book is fictional, why Croatian player, he could got better attention if author of the book had putted English or French player.\n\nAuthor of this book is: Nicolas Bendini. The book is published in Italy, country where Boban played. Some people say that this author is that high school boy. Author has good understanding of gay culture, sounds really realistic.\n\nHere is a web in Croatian that says about this book: http://www.24sata.hr/nogomet/u-francuskom-gay-romanu-junak-hrvatski-nogometas-118701\n\nAuthor said that book is fictional, but many situations sounds realistic.\n\nAlso author wrights about that match in Zagreb against Crvena Zvezda 1990, where was fan escalation of violence. Key figure of that match was Zvonimir Boban, when he punched Muslim police officer who kicked Croatian fans of Dinamo Zagreb. Many people ask themselves why Boban punched that policeman? In police forces mainly non-Croatians worked. On that match special attention was directed against Dinamo fans. This match played on 13. May 1990. Some people like to think that this date is official date of war against Serbia and final nail in the coffin of artificial state Yugoslavia.\n\nCroatia as a national team really don't have true football rival: except Serbia, Montenegro, England and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Only against these opponents everyone could feel intensive atmosphere.\n\nAgainst countries of the \"new world\" we never had problems, violence. Our first friendly match was against USA. Croatian team has more friendly teams than unfriendly. During the years we maybe developed rivalry against some countries, but on healthy football rivalry (France, Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Spain, Argentina, Brazil). Everyone likes to win against them, so do we.\n\nCroatia has true rivalry against countries on Balcan. Croatia played friendly match against Bosnia and Herzegovina and we saw Muslim fans who sang really offensive words. They tried to destroy the fence. Croatia won 5-3.\n\n[ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AneKzS0zpQ\"]BiH - Hrvatska 3:5 (Neredi na tribinama) - YouTube[/ame]\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Bosna+i+Hercegovina+-+Hrvatska+3-5&aq=f\n\nI think that this was the last friendly match against Bosnia and Herzegovina. With this they erased friendship with Croatia. Also Muslim people in Bosnia and Herzegovina supported Turkey against Croatia on EURO 2008. In Bosnia and Herzegovina was many violence before and after this match in Vienna. Ottoman Empire formed today's Muslim community in Bosnia and Herzegovina, so they consider Turkey as \"motherland or fatherland.\"\n\nAgainst Serbia we never had friendly match. We played only two official matches (0-0) in Belgrade and (2-2) in Zagreb. They kicked us from EURO 2000 in these two matches, because we lost against Ireland 1998 in qualifications. We were third on the world and maybe we didn't had any motivation to play on high level in these EURO 2000 qualifications.\n\nYugoslavia (Serbia) - Croatia 0-0 - video: Serbians turned off electricity on this stadium so that they can provoke us.\n\n[ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbujlzbbe8w\"]Jugoslavija - Hrvatska 0:0, Kvalifikacije za EURO 2000 - 18.08.1999. - Cela utakmica. - YouTube[/ame]\n\nTheir name was Yugoslavia back than, but these players were Serbian and Montenegrin.\n\nCroatia - Yugoslavia 2-2 - video: [ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Trhl2Wtizpc\"]Hrvatska - Jugoslavija 2:2 - Hrvatski komentator - Cela utakmica - 09.10.1999. - YouTube[/ame]\n\nReferee hasn't seen one goal here, Croatia should win 3-2, ball passed over the line, Davor Suker scored, but he said that the ball didn't pass the line.\n\nBefore that match Dejan Savicevic was on one video where he offended Croatian fan on the street, you saw that before.\n\nDrazan Jerkovic was great player, he was Croat.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dražan_Jerković\n\nYou can see here that he played only 21 match for Yugoslavia. He scored 11 goals for them, but he didn't had same conditions like Serbians or Montenegrins. Many Croatian players, Muslim players didn't had same conditions. I didn't find any Kosovian Albanian player in Yugoslavian team. They couldn't even speak Albanian language.\n\nAfter WW2 Croatia tried to get their independence in football at least, so you can see that Drazan Jerkovic played for Croatia in 1956 year. Because of that he couldn't play for Yugoslavia. He was unwanted. For Dinamo he scored 96 goals in 142 matches.\n\nSekularac (Serbian-Macedonian) was a good player, but he said some offensive things in the media against Croatia, when he was old.\n\nWikipedia considers him as Macedonian player, he was born in Macedonia, he has Macedonian mother, but his father is Serbian. Sekularac isn't Macedonian last name. Macedonian last name has -ovski, -oski, -ev mostly at the end of their last names.\n\nTo scorer of Yugoslavian all time team was Stjepan Bobek - Croatian. He scored 36 goals.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslavia_national_football_team\n\nOn this page I found some errors also:\n\nFor example players from Bosnia and Herzegovina. Wikipedia putted some Croatian players in that country, they were born there, but Wikipedia doesn't understand ethnicity.\n\nThey putted on player who was born near of Zagreb, pure Croatian, and he is in Bosnia and Herzegovina:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josip_Bukal\n\nJosip is Croatian name, his last name sounds like Czech, but he was from northern part of Croatia.\n\nMiroslav Brozovic played for Croatian team during WW2 and Wikipedia putted him in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miroslav_Brozović\n\nMany important players from Bosnia and Herzegovina are Croats: Josip Bukal, Davor Jozić, Josip \"Škijo\" Katalinski (maybe Ukranian, Polish heritage, but he has Croatian name), Ivica \"Švabo\" Osim (his nickname was German - Aleman - Svabo, really don't know what ethnicity he is, Ivica isn't a Muslim name, but his last name don't say nothing), Blaž Slišković - is Croatian, but during Yugoslavia he was Yugoslavian, but he likes to have now rosary from Fatima, Portugal, holy water, when he coaches his team. He scored goals from corner, great player, but many people said that he was lazy. He also married Serbian Bosnian handball player Svetlana Kitic.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaž_Slišković\n\nFranjo Vladić - was also Croatian ethnicity.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franjo_Vladić\n\nDusan Bajevic is alo player from Bosnia and Herzegovina, but he is Serbian.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dušan_Bajević\n\nOne player has uncommon name and last name, he is from Bosnia and Herzegovina: Nicole Verdugo, maybe he had Italian heritage, in Bosnia and Herzegovina live some Italians, Germans, Ukranians, Russians, Jewish, Roma people, but 95% are Croats, Muslims or Serbs.\n\nOther important players from Bosnia and Herzegovina are Muslims: Mirsad \"Žvaka\" Baljić (Zvaka - Chewing-gum nickname), Mehmed Baždarević, Mirsad Fazlagić, Džemal Hadžiabdić, Faruk Hadžibegić, Vahid Halilhodžić, Enver Marić, Muhamed Mujić, Vahidin Musemić, Haris Škoro, Safet Sušić). Muslims have Arabic or Turkish first names, but their last name is a variation of Slavenic structure and Turkish patronime (Fazlaga, Hadzi, Halil, Mujo). Last names Maric, Skoro you can find in Croatian and Serbian heritage also. Muslims from Bosnia and Herzegovina took over Croatian language and letter. Because of that they have Slavic structure in their last names. Many of them converted on Islam during Ottoman Empire by force or by personal wish. Before they were Croatian Catholics or Serbian Orthodox people.\n\nBut new theories show that Muslims are Bogomils (Bogu mili in Croatian means Dear to God).\n\nIt would be fair that all three nations got these results: Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, because Yugoslavia didn't had to much Montenegrin or Slovenian players. But it would be fair that they got also some results where they participated. But Serbia got all results from Yugoslavia in every sport, not just football.\n\nWikipedia did also some errors for Serbian players during Yugoslavia:\n\nDragan Holcer isn't Serbian at all, born in Germany. He played in Hajduk Split and Radnicki Nis in Yugoslavian area. He left better trace in Croatian football. You have also several players that played for Croatian clubs but they were Serbians.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragan_Holcer\n\nMaybe I did here error with Dragan Holcer. I have putted him as Croatian, didn't saw his birthplace.\n\nBernard Hügl - he is also Serbian, no way, pure German. In Serbian northern region Vojvodina you have many minorities:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vojvodina\n\nVojvodina will leave from Serbia very soon, because no one likes to live with Serbians.\n\nSerbia did a clever thing also, when they give nationality to their minorities. for example you have Croats in Serbia, but also you have Bunjevci and Šokci as other two minorities.\n\nBunjevci: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunjevci\n\nBunjevci came from Dalmatia and Western Herzegovina in Serbia. Map said here very well.\n\nŠokci are also Croats: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokci\n\nDividing one nation in three you don't have danger of them.\n\nSerbia told them, you are Bunjevci and Sokci. Bunjevci came from river Buna in Western Herzegovina, that's why you have Bunjevci from Buna.\n\nIn Serbia there are Croats: 56,546, Bunjevci: 19,776, Sokci: 1,864. Also in Serbia you have many undeclared and unknown people: 55,016, 23,774. I assume that they are scared to say what they are, they are not Serbians for sure. Serbians killed many Croats, Germans, Hungarians after WW2.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germans_of_Croatia\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danube_Swabians\n\n\"The Croatian German population reached a peak number of 85,781 in the 1900 census, while this number plummeted after the German exodus in the aftermath of World War II. After the war, 100,000 Yugoslav Germans fled to Austria. This population was not dealt with in the Potsdam Agreement which prevented them from being patriated to Germany. The Allies considered them Yugoslavian citizens and sought their repatriation there. However, on June 4 the communist Yugoslav regime released a decree that rescinded the citizenship of Yugoslavian Germans. Their property was henceforth confiscated, and the majority settled in Germany and Austria. Some managed to sneak back into Yugoslavia and returned to their homes.\"\n\nSerbian footballer Silvester Takač is Hungarian I think (Takacs).\n\nFadil Vokrri is Albanian.\n\nFahrudin Jusufi is Gorani nation.\n\nGorani People: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorani_people\n\nIn Serbia you have also other national groups:\n\nAromanians: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromanians\n\nVlachs: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlachs\n\nBut they don't have their country on Balkans, they are just there, don't know much about them.\n\nPannonian Rusyns: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pannonian_Rusyns\n\nVojvodina was part of Austran Hungarian Monarchy, that's why she has interesting architecture.\n\nWikipedia also putted Danilo Popivoda as Slovenian player, but he was pure Serbian.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danilo_Popivoda\n\nChile 1962 World Cup: Yugoslavian Serbian player Vladimir Durković:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Durković\n\n\"He died when mistakenly shot by a policeman in Sion, Switzerland in June 1972 at the age of 34.\"\n\nFIFA decided who will get these results from Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, because Belgrade and Moscow were the capitals of these large countries. Many Ukranians played for Soviet Union, some Armenians, Belarus people. But Russia and Serbia got all results in every sport.\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina has same issue with national anthem like Spain. But it's also different. In Spain almost everyone are Christians, mostly Catholics, but in Bosnia and Herzegovina Muslims are the biggest nation, because they have many children, Serbians are the second large nation and Croats are third. No one knows what words, historical moments you can put in Bosnian national anthem. If you put something Serbian you are offensive against Croats and Muslims, if you put something Muslim, Serbs and Croats will be sad. In Bosnia and Herzegovina language isn't such a big problem, they understand there very well when they speak. Only Serbia has Cyrillic letter. Muslims took Croatian letter, language with some small mix of Serbian. Muslims don't have their language nor letter. They have some Turkish words that they left after Ottoman Empire like every nation in ex-Yugoslavia. In Croatian grammatical language some Turkish words don't have place, but some of them do have place in standard language.\n\nYou can see some words from Turkish language that stayed in Croatia, but they have different letters, different way to wright them:\n\nhttp://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turcizam\n\nIn (tur.) is the word in original Turkish language. On the left you have Croatian, Serbian, Bosnian pronouncioation.\n\nIn English these words mean:\n\nalat < tur. alat, eng. tool\n\nbakar < tur. bakır, eng. copper, Cobreloa Bakar is Turkish word.\n\nboja < tur. boya, eng. color\n\nbubreg < tur. böbrek, eng. kidney\n\nbudala < tur. budala, eng. fool, idiot.\n\nbunar < tur.

In 2010, for the first time in history, Serbia was represented as an independent nation in the FIFA World Cup.\"\n\n\"The Serbian national team was previously known as the Yugoslav national football team from 15 January 1991 until 4 February 2003, and then as the Serbia and Montenegro national football team until 3 June 2006 when Serbia declared independence as the successor state to the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro. It was officially renamed the Serbia national football team on 28 June 2006, while the Montenegro national football team was created to represent the new state of Montenegro.\"\n\n\"Between 1921 and 1992, the team did not exist as we know it today, since Serbia was part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (1918–1943) and later on, of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (1945–1991). The Serbia national team existed from 1919 to 1921, but ceased to exist following the creation of the first Kingdom of Yugoslavia.\n\nHowever, the Football Association of Serbia is a FIFA member since 1921 and a UEFA member since its creation in 1954. The Serbia national team is recognized, thanks to a mutual consent between both FIFA and UEFA, as the direct descendant of the Yugoslavia national team. Hence, the new national team formed in 1992 inherited of the full status, results, and achievements from Yugoslavia, which was not the case for any other country resulting from the breakup of Yugoslavia. Consequently, it did not have to apply to obtain a FIFA and UEFA status.\n\nA similar situation happened following Montenegro's decision to secede following a referendum held on 21 May 2006. Once more, Serbia inherited of the Serbia and Montenegro full status, and did not have to apply for a FIFA and UEFA status, while Montenegro was obligated to do so.\"\n\n\"The Yugoslavia national football team represented the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (1918–1943) and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (1946–1992) in association football. It enjoyed a modicum of success in international competition. In 1992, during the Yugoslav wars, the team was suspended from international competition as part of a United Nations sanction. In 1994, when the boycott was lifted, it was succeeded by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia football team.\"\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslavia_national_football_team\n\nThe Football Federation of what was then the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was founded in Zagreb, Croatia in 1919 under the name Jugoslovenski nogometni savez (and admitted into FIFA), and the national team played its first international game at the Summer Olympics in Antwerp in 1920. The opponent was Czechoslovakia, and the historic starting eleven that represented Kingdom of SCS on its debut were: Vrđuka-Croat, Župančić-Croat, Šifer-Croat, Tavčar-Slovenian, Cindrić-Croatian from Romania, Rupec-Croatian, Vragović-Croatian, Dubravčić-Croatian, Perška-Croatian, Granec and Ružić (can't find their ethnicity, but they are not Serbs).\n\nIn 1929, the country was renamed to Yugoslavia and the football association became Fudbalski Savez Jugoslavije and moved its headquarters to Belgrade.\n\nThe national team participated in the 1930 FIFA World Cup and finished in fourth place. In its first ever World Cup match in Montevideo's Parque Central, Yugoslavia managed a famous 2-1 win versus mighty Brazil, with the following starting eleven representing the country: Jakšić, Sekulić, Tirnanić, Ivković, Bek, Đokić, Marjanović, Arsenijević, Vujadinović, Mihajlović, and Stefanović. The national team consisted just of Serbian players as it was boycotted by Croatian players at this World Cup due to the relocation of football association's headquarters from Zagreb to Belgrade.\n\nNow we know why were only Serbian players on World Cup in 1930.\n\nThe federation and football overall was disrupted by World War II. After the war, a socialist federation was formed and the football federation reconstituted. It was one of the founding members of the UEFA and it organized the 1976 European Championship played in Belgrade and Zagreb. The national team participated in eight World Cups, four Euros, and won the Olympic football tournament in 1960 at the Summer Games (they also finished second three times and third once).\n\nSerbian Dragan Džajić holds the record for the most national team caps at 85, between 1964 to 1979. The best scorer is Croatian Stjepan Bobek with 38 goals, between 1946 and 1956.\n\nThe under-21 team won the inaugural UEFA U-21 Championship in 1978.\n\nThe Yugoslav under-20 team won the FIFA World Youth Championship 1987.\n\nWith the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the team split up and the remaining team of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) was banned from competing at Euro 92. The decision was made on 31 May 1992 - just 10 days before the competition commenced. They had finished top of their qualifying group, but were unable to play in the competition due to United Nations Security Council Resolution 757. Their place was taken by Denmark, who went on to win the competition. Yugoslavia had also been drawn as the top seed in Group 5 of the European Zone in the qualifying tournament for the 1994 World Cup. FRY was barred from competing, rendering the group unusually weak.\n\nAfter the breakup of Yugoslavia, the FRY consisted of Montenegro and Serbia. The national team of Serbia and Montenegro continued under the name Yugoslavia until 2003, when country and team were renamed Serbia and Montenegro. With the independence of Montenegro in 2006, FIFA considers the national team of Serbia to be the successor of Yugoslavia.\n\nCroatian Football Federation was the oldest Federation in Yugoslavia:\n\nCroatian Football Federation - 1912\n\nFootball Association of Slovenia - 1920\n\nFootball Association of Montenegro - 1931\n\nFootball Federation of Kosovo - 1946\n\nFootball Federation of Macedonia - 1949\n\nFootball Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina - 1992\n\nFootball Association of Serbia - April 18, 1919/June 28, 2006 (autonomous Football Association of Vojvodina, January 9, 1949.)\n\nFootball Association of (FR) Yugoslavia - 1992 -> Football Association of Serbia and Montenegro - 2003\n\nFootball Association of Yugoslavia\n\nIt was formed in 1919 in Zagreb under the Croatian name Jugoslavenski nogometni savez. FA became the temporary member of FIFA on May 4, 1921 and permanent member on May 20, 1923. The name later changed to Nogometni savez Jugoslavije. After disagreements between the Zagreb and Belgrade subassociations in 1929, the Assembly of Football Association of Yugoslavia was dissolved in 1929, subsequently with the 6 January Dictatorship; the association headquarters moved to Belgrade next year, on March 16, 1930 where the organization modified its name to Serbian Fudbalski Savez Jugoslavije.\n\nCroatia got only the results that they achieved during World War II. (1941-1945).\n\nCzech Republic and Slovakia:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechoslovakia_national_football_team\n\n\"The Czechoslovakia national football team was the national association football team of Czechoslovakia from 1922 to 1993. At the dissolution of Czechoslovakia at the end of 1992, the team was participating in UEFA qualifying Group 4 for the 1994 World Cup; it completed this campaign under the name Representation of Czechs and Slovaks (RCS). The subsequent Czech Republic national football team and Slovakia national football team are both recognised by FIFA and UEFA as successors of the Czechoslovakia team.\"\n\nThe same thing should happened with Croatia and Serbia. Serbian players always had an advantage during Yugoslavia, on club level and on national team level. The good way for Serbians is to be always superior above others. Serbians would rather invite bad Serbian players than good Croatian players, just so that they can say: \"On World Cup 1930. played only Serbians.\" This is a proof that the quality of footballers in Yugoslavia wasn't first condition, you just needed to be Serbian to be the coach of Yugoslavian national football team and they tried to have 1,2 player more compared to other republics.\n\nSerbians didn't liked the fact that headquarters of Yugoslavian Football Federation is in Zagreb, they did bad thing and relocated this headquarters in Belgrade, Serbia. Same thing happened in every sport (basketball, handball, waterpolo, tennis...etc.) Every result from World Cups, European Championships, Summer and Winter Olympic Games - everything got Serbia, even though in these teams were many participants from non-Serbian republics, especially from Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, with some traces with Slovenian, Montenegrin and Macedonian participants.\n\nThat team was great, especially Croatian side.\n\nBalkan countries have problems in mutual politics, religious differences, regional differences inside of these republics. For example, Croatia was Serbian war target because of Croatian Adriatic coast, beautiful landscapes, they don't have sea, but we do have. Croatia was the richest republic during Yugoslavia and yet all financial income went in Serbia, capital city Belgrade. Croats never supported Yugoslavian team, because Croats in that team were always underrated and pressured because of their Croatian nationality and catholic religion. Serbians are orthodox. Nobody can't connect these different nations in one state. You have a nice example in Canada if you live there, people of French and English origins, Quebec, Toronto, Montreal. Same thing was in ex-Yugoslavia.\n\nSame thing is in sports. In every sport in which Yugoslavia participated you could see many Croatians, other republics didn't had so much influence, Slovenia was good in winter sports, Muslims from Bosnia and Herzegovina had several great players.\n\nCroatia didn't attacked Serbia on their territory. Serbians are specific people, primitive, disfunctional families, alcoholism issues. After World War II. Serbians killed many Croatians, Italians, Germans, because these nations lost in that World War II. Many Italians left Croatian regions Istria, Dalmatia, losing their homes, same is with other nations, especially if they were catholic and non-Serbian.\n\nYugoslavian Football Federation was founded in Zagreb, Croatia, but Serbians took that headquarters by force and take it in Belgrade, Serbia. I wrote about this. Before World Cup in 1930 year, Croats boycotted Yugoslavian team because of this illegal transfer, so no one from Croatian players hasn't traveled on that World Cup. Number of Croatian players in Yugoslavian team depended how much Croatians were inferior. If you are inferior enough you could be invited, if you tried to ask your rights, you were deleted.\n\nBalkan Peninsula isn't just stubborn space. It's about taking away territory, influence, natural treasure and economical development. Croatians, Slovenians always worked for Serbia, they have their sentence: \"Serbia is from Tokyo to Milwaukee\". Imagine that. They have problems in their heads, that's for sure. During Yugoslavia Albanians from Kosovo couldn't speak their own language, others could speak their language. Croats needed to speak Serbo-Croatian language. Why? If they were Croats?\n\nDuring Yugoslavian national league, all titles went for Partizan Belgrade or Crvena Zvezda, they bought matches, set ups, just so that Croatian best clubs: Hajduk Split and Dinamo Zagreb couldn't get their deserved titles.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslav_First_League\n\nSerbia got sports results in winter games, everyone knows that Slovenia had good ski team, ski jump team. Serbia never had ski drivers. Croatia has good winter games team in recent ages.\n\nSerbians took everything, results in basketball, handball, tennis, volleyball, football and all other sports. In this every sport Croats participated. But World and European Sports Federations don't know the difference between Croatians, Serbians, Montenegrins. Bosnia and Herzegovina has three nations. Croats aren't accepted as constitutional nation even today, because they are the smallest nation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Serbians and later Muslims entered in war with Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Croatia won in that war for their independence, but there were many victims and refugees, especially civilians, children and old people. Croats aren't stubborn at all. They just want to live on their own ground, have their own territory.\n\nCroats came first at Balkan Peninsula, during 7th century. Serbians came from south, because they had lost the battle against Ottoman Empire in today's Kosovo. Croats accepted them as refugees, helped them, settled them in Croatian parts of Austrian-Hungarian Monarchy.\n\nSerbia lost all their military battles in history. And they celebrate them as they got all victories. As people, they are primitive, take a lot of alcohol and very violent.\n\nFor example you can see Serbian manifestations, look how do they look?? With knives, beard, silly caps and flags with skulls. Croatians don't have this.\n\nSerbians: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chetniks\n\nhttp://www.google.hr/search?q=CETNI...ct=mode&cd=2&ved=0CBEQ_AUoAQ&biw=1152&bih=773\n\nYou can see what they did in Croatia, they destroyed our cities.\n\nhttp://www.google.hr/search?q=CETNI...on.2,or.&fp=52f17b2c0e5cff46&biw=1152&bih=773\n\nhttp://www.google.hr/search?q=CETNI...on.2,or.&fp=52f17b2c0e5cff46&biw=1152&bih=773\n\nMany Croatian civilians (children, women, old people just because they were Croats) slaughtered, killed, torcherd and died in Croatia:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_War_of_Independence\n\nDuring Yugoslavia Serbians killed Croatian members of Yugoslavian Parliament: this Serbian Punisa Racic has killed Croatian politicians in Yugoslavian Parliament:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puniša_Račić\n\nThis Serbian Gavrilo Princip killed Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavrilo_Princip\n\nMany Croatians were taken by force on Croatian island Goli Otok (Naked Island): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goli_otok\n\nOn this island they worked hard jobs, with stone, it was like Alcatraz, even worse, island surrounded with water, without any hope that you can escape. They punched Croatians, left them without food. The name \"naked island\" brings the whole picture, island without any conditions and hope. If you say something against Serbia, you could get one way ticket for this island.\n\nThey are natural rebels, don't know how to work, how to invent economical solutions, and they want to live gratis, so that others work for them. They try to forbid if someone tries to visit Kosovo, which is internationally accepted.\n\nSerbians are against everyone. You can be their friend only if you are inferior and they are superior. They always start wars on Balkan Peninsula, start to make barricades of wood and stones and kill non-Serbian people.\n\nFoibe killings of Italians are act of Serbians who proclaimed themselves as Yugoslav Partisans. Croatians didn't participated in that massacre. They just wanted to revenge against Italians, Croats, Germans, without trials or investigation. Nationality was enough so that these people could lose their lives.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foibe_killings\n\nMany ethnical Germans left from Croatia. Many of them were killed.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danube_Swabians\n\nThis was Croatian massacre after World War II. They took Croatian weapon and told them, that they can leave outside of Croatia in peace, but they killed them without trials.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleiburg_massacre\n\nMany graveyards were found during ages with Croats, Slovenians, Italians, Germans, Bosnian Muslims from Macedonia to Slovenia, in woods, caves, fields, swamps and rivers.\n\nSerbia and Montenegro are friendly countries, but even Montenegro doesn't want to live with Serbians.\n\nWar between Croatia and Serbia started after this football match between Dinamo Zagreb and Crvena Zvezda, on 13th May 1990. in Zagreb, Croatia.\n\n[ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXr1Z-MiApo\"]Dinamo Zagreb vs. Crvena Zvezda Beograd 13.05.1990. - YouTube[/ame]\n\nYugoslavian police was made of Serbians and Muslims mostly. Of course they would attack Croatian fans of Dinamo Zagreb. Zvonimr Boban, ex AC Milan player saw that and he jumped on the police officer to defend his people, nation and club.\n\nIn Yugoslavia was false unity, justice and fraternity, it hasn't been equal % for every nation. Serbians took everything. Others couldn't take any more. Serbians worked in public companies, others worked harder jobs. Croats went in Trieste on Ponto Rosso to buy jeans and coffee, Yugoslavia didn't had that at all. Yugoslavia had maybe two sorts of chocholate. Land of milk and honey.\n\nAfter the war against Croatia 1995., Serbians did ethnical cleansing in Bosnia and Eastern Herzegovina and proclaimed new illegal country: Republika Srpska\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republika_Srpska\n\nThe founders of this country are in Haag Tribunal, they wait for sentences because of breaking all customs of war, Geneva Conventions and human rights. And this so called country still exists, even though Ratko Mladic, Goran Hadzic and Radovan Karadzic are in Haag. They don't even respect Haag Tribunal, In cities where Croats or Muslim lived, they would kill them or send them as refugees, they wanted 100% Serbian population. Also they try to command Croatian politicians to avoid Kosovo. But Croatians said; \"The time is passed, we will never ask for permission of Serbia\"\n\nCroatian minority in Serbia doesn't have the same rights as Serbian minority in Croatia. They have troubles in Serbia to declare themselves as Croats. They can't learn Croatian in schools, can't get their jobs. Serbians have their own schools in Croatia, their own language, literature, books, Serbian parties are active in Croatia, they are members in Croatian Parliament. Croatians can only dream about membership in Serbian Parliament.\n\nItalians in Montenegro had problems with Montenegrin people.\n\nWar crime in Bosnia, genocide: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnian_Genocide\n\nThere is a lot of history that goes back in medieval times when Croats helped Serbians to save their lives of Ottoman Empire.\n\nYou can see who came first on Balcan Peninsula:\n\nCroats - 7th century\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croats\n\nSerbians in Croatia:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbs_of_Croatia\n\n\"A large number of ethnic Serbs migrated to the north and west in 1538 during the rule of Ban Petar Keglević when King Ferdinand I, ruler of the Habsburg Monarchy, offered sanctuary and permanent settlement to displaced Serbs from Raška who had fled their land due to Ottoman conquests, thus placing them under Austrian military administration.\"\n\nSome of them came earlier but most of them came in 14, 15 century, when they lost big battle against Ottoman Empire in Kosovo, that's why they can't stand independent Kosovo, they are losing Kosovo for the second time.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kosovo\n\nThey still celebrate this battle. When Croats celebrate their manifestations, Serbs send declaratons:\"You can't celebrate these dates, because these dates are sad days for Serbian people\". They attacked us and they lost, now they try to forbid that we celebrate August the 5th every year and our military operations:\n\nOperations Storm:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Storm\n\nOperation Flash:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Flash\n\nSerbians don't want to accept that they are not important anymore and that Yugoslavia doesn't exist. As a nation they are poor, living with their violent past, politics, without money. This is their food, anger and bad thoughts. Croats are oriented to peace, human rights, healthy European aspirations, international cooperation with neighbors and other countries, western point of view. As a nation we are very proud, in the past we were warriors, we always defended what is ours, other territory we never wanted. In the past other countries hired us to go in battles for them, because we had always good military, logistics and war leaders. We fought for Napoleon, Roman Empire and many other systems. During the World War II Croatia entered in alliance with Germany and Italy, just so that we can get Independent State of Croatia.\n\nCroatia isn't some new nation, we have history that is cca 1300 years old.\n\nBefore these years we were explorers, Marco Polo is considered to be born in today's Croatia, we explored the world, we had a tribe in today's USA, their name was Croatan: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatan\n\nThis is a proof that Croats came in USA before Columbus.\n\nWe have many experts in every field, for a small nation, that means a lot:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Croats\n\nWe have large diaspora also, they are also people with reputation, my family is spread all over the world, they live nice and wealthy lives in their countries.\n\nAs a sports nation, many people think that we are newbies in every sport. Our sport results aren't surprise, we had always solid sports background and talent what is most important:\n\nList of Croatian sportspeople in Croatia and abroad:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Croatian_sportspeople\n\nCroatians were the first strangers in NBA League. They opened a road for other foreign players during 90's.\n\nEvery nation wants to defend their territory, history, culture and reputation so do we. There is nothing bad in that. It's not nice when someone tries to expel your language and change your history. We had our own written letter during early medieval times, the name was Glagoljica.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glagolitic_alphabet\n\nLater we took Latin language and Latin Alphabet.\n\nWe have our cuisine: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_cuisine\n\nCroatia is a touristic paradise. Everyone confirms that who visits Croatia. On small space we have high mountains, green fields and beautiful coast with cca 1200 islands.\n\nOther nations mostly don't know what happened in ex-Yugoslavia, they think that every nation is violent, it's not true. Only Serbians ruled with iron hand. That's a historic fact. We are not the same, Croatians and Serbians have big differences in their origins, religion, culture and history. Yugoslavia was artificial country, 5,6 countries needed to listen one country.\n\nYou could see Serbian way in Genoa, on Luigi Ferraris Stadium. They brought their problems from Serbia, they don't care about the fact that they are in Italy. They don't have any respect. It's good that Italy got 3-0 result. Serbian fans tried to kill their own goalkeeper, because he changed the club in Serbia, they interrupted that match because they lost against Estonia in Belgrade 1-3. They have many conflicts inside the team and that's why they fall a part mostly on every bigger competition. Croatia and Serbia are in the same group for World Cup 2014. You will probably hear about violence of their fans. But Croatian fans are also tuff. When we unite, north and south, nobody can do nothing against us.\n\nBad relations in Yugoslavian football were just a consequence. The source was always history, culture, language, religion and politics. Imagine how would you felt if someone attacks your country, your family, your language, culture and history. Everyone would be ready to defend their home and heritage. I haven't lost anyone in this recent war, but I understand other people who lost their families and homes.\n\nFoibe were executions against these people, but before World War II. non-Serbian people were under constant pressure, Croatia tried to seperate also in year 1971. but they couldn't do that.\n\nCroatian spring: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_Spring\n\nIt's democratic right that anyone should be free. These killings had connection with ethnicity very much. Why didn't Serbians killed with Germans, Italians and Croats? This photo is made by people who adored this person.\n\nMany Croatians died AFTER World War II, without trials, pure execution. These soldiers went form house to house and searched for male and female civilians who were Croatians, Italians, Germans and killed them. Many of them didn't served in army during World War II.\n\nMembers of Croatian Yugoslav resistance were also Serbians, partisans, who never wanted Croatian independency. They wanted artificial state of so called brotherhood and unity. Pure Croatians never liked Yugoslavia, they declared themselves because you needed to do so, nationality: Yugoslavian was obligation for everyone.\n\nMonths before the war between Croatia and Serbia, Serbia took all weapons from barracks and started to use them against Croatians, even from Croatian barracks. How come, if this was weapon of whole Yugoslav nation? Croatia got embargo, and Serbia had all weapons, but we managed to buy weapons and destroy Serbian army 1995.\n\nHow do you explain Italians, Germans who left their homes, and they never received money for their real estates and they needed to move in Austria, Germany and Italy.\n\nHow do you explain Bleiburg massacre in Austria, where Croatians gave all their weapons to Yugoslavia and they killed all Croats on that field, many bodies were found in Slovenia, Bosnia - Herzegovina, Croatia in caves and woods. Massive graveyards. These Italians from Istria still remember their lives there and feel nostalgia.\n\nIn these times of Yugoslavia there was pure localism. All money of Croatian tourism and their coast went in Serbia. Serbia needed slaves only to work for them. This was their modus opernadi.\n\nNot only that, they took all results in every sport even though many Croatians and other nations participated. Czechoslovakia didn't do that, they look at these results as their own, without any monopol.\n\nYugoslavian nation was artificial. How can you explain World Cup 1930, when Croats boycotted this World Cup, because Serbians moved football federation from Zagreb, Croatia in Belgrade, Serbia. Yugoslavia invited only Serbians. How come, if national ethnicity didn't existed? How could they knew who is Serbian and who is not, if you are devoted to Yugoslavian nation you can't see the difference between nations.\n\nMany Croatian players that had great careers outside of Yugoslavia, played maybe 5,6 matches for Yugoslavia. Croatian clubs could get their championships in Yugoslavia very difficult, almost every title went in Belgrade, not because they were good, yet because they care about Serbia and Serbian clubs. They fixed Yugoslavian Championship every year. How come there were so little Serbians in Croatian clubs and how come there wasn't Croatian players in Serbian clubs, maybe 2,3 Croatians played for Partizan Belgrade or Crvena Zvezda.\n\nDrazen Petrovic saw how Serbians destroy his hometown Sibenik, on croatian coast, what do you think how should he declare himself? His father is of Montenegrin heritage, his mother is Croatian, father of Toni Kukoc is Croatian, some rumors said that his mother is of Serbian heritage.\n\nThere were people who declared themselves as Yugoslavians, but not all of them. For example Western Herzegovina is made of 99% of pure ethnical Croatian residents. From this region are/or have heritage Zvonimir Boban, Davor Suker, Zvonimir Soldo, Krunoslav Jurcic, Dario Simic, etc.\n\nFor example this city Siroki Brijeg in Western Herzegovina: 98% are Croats http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Široki_Brijeg\n\nMany Croatians went on Goli Otok (Naked Island), just because they would declare themselves as Croatians. Many persons were convicted, many catholic priests were killed.\n\nYugoslavia had secret service who killed Croatians abroad, all killings were after World War II, so that Serbians can destroy forever the hope of Independent Croatia:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_State_Security\n\nLook how many victims there were, just because they wrote books, wanted to see independent Croatia.\n\nCroatian Catholic Archbishop was convicted and poisoned in prison:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aloysius_Stepinac\n\nSerbia didn't tried to protect Yugoslavia, why did they attack Croatia, they crossed the Croatian-Serbian border and came in Croatia to destroy homes, churches, not military objects. They slaughtered Croatian people in Croatian cities.\n\nFor example uncle of Sinisa Mihajlovic was almost killed because he was Croatian, but Mihajlovic saved his uncle from Serbians. Interesting how did Serbians knew the differences between nations and yet they were devoted Yugoslavians.\n\n\"Born in Vukovar, SR Croatia, near the border of SR Serbia, Mihajlović was born to parents who identified as Yugoslavs. His father Bogdan originates from a Serb family and his mother Viktorija has a Croatian family background.\"\n\nFrom Yugoslavian citizen, Mihajlovic became devoted Serbian.\n\n\"Already known as someone who doesn't back away from physical play, the 23-year-old was one of the main protagonists of the ill-tempered 1991 Yugoslav Cup Final between Red Star and Hajduk Split, going after Hajduk players with several hard tackles and getting into an altrecation with Igor Štimac.\" Yugoslavian who hates his citizens, interesting.\n\nLook at these biographies of Serbian soldiers:\n\nVojislav Seselj: born in Bosnia and Herzegovina and he was Serbian, not Yugoslavian: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vojislav_Šešelj\n\nRadovan Karadzic: Bosnian Serb also: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radovan_Karadžić\n\nVeselin Sljivancanin - Montenegrin: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veselin_Šljivančanin\n\nMile Mrksic - Croatian Serb: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mile_Mrkšić\n\nGoran Hadzic - Croatian Serb: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goran_Hadžić\n\nVeljko Kadijevic - Serbian father, Croatian mother - he enjoyed in killing Croatians: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veljko_Kadijević\n\nJovan Raskovic - Croatian Serb - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jovan_Rašković\n\nVuk Draskovic - Serbian - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vuk_Drašković\n\nSlobodan Milosevic - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slobodan_Milošević\n\nThey were all war criminals. They look insane when you see their photos. Really scary scene to watch.\n\nIf these poeple wanted to protect Yugoslavia, why did they tried to achieve project called: Great Serbia, why not Great Yugoslavia?\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Serbia\n\nAnd how come they always killed Croatians and Bosnian Muslims?\n\nThere were people who declared as Yugoslavians, but there were people who didn't like Yugoslavia. Pure Croatians always supported Yugoslavian opponents.\n\nHow come Serbians killed Croatian members of Yugoslavian Parliament in Belgrade?\n\nIf someone wanted Independent Croatia these persons would got bullet in the head as their gift, there was pressure about going in the Catholic Church, atheism was something that was desirable.\n\nYou can see some videos how did Croatian cities looked during the war:\n\nhttp://www.google.hr/search?rlz=1C1...-2.1l4l0&fp=7cef8f96605b2cb9&biw=1152&bih=773\n\nSerbians cities were never attacked.\n\nIn this city Skabrnja Croats were killed, because they were on imaginative border of Great Serbia, on the map is visible red zone that Serbia tried to get and to proclaim Great Serbia.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Škabrnja_massacre\n\nVukovar City: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vukovar_massacre\n\nThese cities were places of massive slaughtering of Croatians: http://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popis_masovnih_zločina_nad_Hrvatima_u_Domovinskom_ratu\n\nWikipedia can translate you this article. There were old people, children, all capable for military actions.\n\nSerbia got all results because of their influence at FIFA and UEFA. Croatia is smaller nation than Serbia, smaller market, also Serbia was banned on EURO 1992, even though they entered on that EURO, Denmark replaced them, also they were banned on USA 1994. because they developed the war.\n\nHow come Croatian minority don't have equal rights as Serbians in Serbia. They gave them the status of minority 2005. But they live there 100, 200, 300 years. They divided Croatian people in 3 nations: Croatians, Bunjevci and Sokci, so that they have less demands of them.\n\nBunjevci: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunjevci\n\nhttp://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Šokci\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croats_of_Serbia\n\nThese Croats were object of threat in this city in Serbia:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expulsions_in_Hrtkovci\n\nCroats in Serbia named Janjevci were also problem for Serbians:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janjevci\n\n\"Because of rising anti-Croat rhetorics and warmongering in Serbian media (especially in Serb media on Kosovo) in late 1980s and all the pressure and incidents arising from that, Croats from Janjevo and Letnica and other Croat-inhabited villages were more and more forced to leave Kosovo. They mostly migrated to Croatia. The second wave of leaving Kosovo, came during Kosovo War.\"\n\nLate 80's this was Yugoslavia, how can they receive bad words if they were accepted as Yugoslavians?\n\nYugoslavia never existed as country, it was artificial state of mind and politics. The style of Yugoslavia was brain washing. Why is Croatian diaspora larger than Serbian? Because they were pressured during Yugoslavia.\n\nOutside Croatia you have 4,7 millions of Croats, same as in today's Croatia.\n\nWhy did they left if Yugoslavia was friendly to Croats? If Yugoslavia was country of equal rights, why Serbian Belgrade was capital of Yugoslavia, why not Zagreb, or Ljubljana, Croatia and Slovenia were richest republics back than.\n\nhttp://euroheritage.net/yugoslaviamaps.shtml\n\nWhy Serbia has better stadiums than Croatia, they were build at the same time? Because they took all of our money, foreign money and took them in Serbia.\n\nEvery war on Balkan Peninsula is directed against ethnicity, religion, culture, history and economy. Croatians are one of the oldest European nations, only Basque people and several others have older heritage, we came on Balkan Peninsula in 7th century, Serbians came in Croatia back than in 13,14,15 century when they lost their battles against Ottoman Empire. Croatians had their first king before every other Slavic nations. We don't need to be workers for others.\n\nThey are good in killing children, old people, raping women, but when they meet real soldiers they lose ground under their feet.\n\nSerbia today without Croatia has turbulent times, no money, no tourism, no investments, no education.\n\nYou know how they write English, for example some clubs: Manchester United, they write like this: Mančester Junajted, Lazio is Lacio, Udinese is Udineze, Lecce is Leče, Bologna is Bolonja. They are ignorant, they find complicated to write as it should be, so they write like they speak. They would say you: \"Hau ar ju?\" They took our grammar, took our language and change him a little bit.\n\nVuk Karadzic: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vuk_Stefanović_Karadžić\n\n\" His family had a low infant survival rate, thus he was named Vuk ('wolf') so that witches and evil spirits would not hurt him (Vuk was traditionally given to strengthen the bearer).\" They believed in witches.\n\nThey are violent people, if you are Italian, you saw in Genoa, when they wanted to break up match against Italy.\n\nThey always use provocations, speech of hate, bad form of unhealthy nationalism.\n\nIstrian exodus of Italians:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istrian_exodus\n\nThey were all fascists? 250,000/350,000 ethnic Italians and (some thousand of) anti-communist Slovenes and Croats?\n\nItalians changed their last names so that they could be more Slavenic and so that they can save their lives against Serbians and communists.\n\nOnly in Croatia they have democratic lives with bilingual signs, schools that have Italian language, they didn't had that in Yugoslavia.\n\nOfficial language in Yugoslavia was Serbo-Croatian.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbo-Croatian\n\nThey mixed words by force, Croatians had their own language for 1300 years, we don't need other language.\n\nHow would you feel if you have French-Italian language? I ask this if you are Italian.\n\nEveryone wanted Croatian territory as their own, beautiful coast, islands, mountains, continental parts, they never leave Croats alone. If someone wants independent state, why forbid this?\n\nMany Croatians don't have mixed heritage, others who had they were naive and trusted in holy state of Yugoslavia. Many Serbian people left their Croatian wives during the war and escaped in Serbia without them. Today they hide their Serbian background, they shame themselves because what Serbians did. Croats never shamed of their ethnical heritage. If you know any Croatian in your private life, they will all say that they are Croatians, except these who came from mixed ethnicity.\n\nSerbians that wanted to respect Croatians laws and Croatian Constitution could stay in Croatia and work as normal people, but they were seduced by their politicians who told them on public speeches about Great Serbia and that every Croatian will be inferior, because of that they wanted to destroy Croatians.\n\nAfter Serbia lost in this war, these Serbians who escaped from Croatia, they wanted to come back in Croatia, because they live very poor life in Serbia, they couldn't eat ideas and dreams, now they say: \"We didn't know what are we doing\". Laim excuse. Many Serbians killed their Croatian neighbors in mixed cities, during Yugoslavia they were so called friends. Imagine that, your Serbian neighbor enters in your home and kills your whole family. That was sincere brotherhood. Serbian generals asked always Serbian residents which houses are of Croatian heritage, and they would say where. In Yugoslavia they all were Yugoslavians, how could they know the difference?\n\nYes, we could all be proud on Yugoslavian citizenship.\n\nBefore WWII both Chetniks and Ustashas were responsible of many crimes (alongside nazis and fascists), and got dealt with in the immediate aftermath.\n\nYugoslav Partisans were from Slovenia (Tito himself was Slovenian), Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro. They couldn't care less about their heritage. It was fascism vs. anti-fascism, not Serbians vs. Croats.\n\nSimilar stories can be found about Croat soldiers too. As I said, by that time nobody was 'right' anymore. Croats killed Serbs and Bosnians too, it was a civil war due to ethnic reasons, and the idea of a united socialist Jugoslavia was already erased from history. I contested your rambling about SFRJ being 'Serbian', what happened later is not of my interest, I don't like any od the sides involved.\n\nCurious though how you first whine about Serbian nationalism but then make multiple apologies of Pavelic's regime and want a Croatian Western Herzegovina...double-standards much??\n\nChetniks and Ustase are the 2 sides of the same coin.\n\nIf you really wanna talk about ethnic cleansings, let's start from what happened in Jasenovac.\n\nAtheism is desirable. I wish the Catholic Church would get repressed in Italy. Before fascism it kinda was.\n\nYet another reason to support Tito and another Jugoslavian peculiarity which indicates that there was no pro-Serbian stance (Serbian nationalism is deeply pro-orthodox).\n\nThey were by Americans and NATO.\n\nCroatian committed many crimes too, it was hardly a one-sided affair. This being said, I in no way condone Serbian actions during the war, not sure why you're posting this. Serbia and Socialist Jugoslavia, by that time, were 2 very different entities.\n\nPlenty of Serbians, Macedonians left too...immigration was due to economic reasons, not ethnic.\n\nBelgrade was capital for political reasons. Milan and Venice are richer than Rome, yet Rome is the Italian capital.\n\nlol. You were Venice and Vienna slaves for centuries. Get a sense of reality. As for the all the silly, racist stereotypes you started spewing after this paragraph, they don't even deserve an answer.\n\nLong live Blagoje Jovovic!!\n\nProblems started wright after World War I. These Chetniks and Ustashe came later in late 30's.\n\nSerbians have big arrogance and they always wanted to decide about key issues. We were never asked about Yugoslavian politics and international affairs. You needed to be in a communist party to get some rights. Ustashe were consequence of Serbian hegemonia. Problems started in the year 1918. When Alexander the First accepted members of council. Croatians wanted their rights and federation. This royal atmosphere didn't had Constitution. King made his own declarations.\n\nIn Parliament were invited only Serbian politicians from party of Nikola Pasic, Croatians were never invited there. But the name of state was Royalty of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians. They started back than. They brought a constitution without non-Serbian residents.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidovdan_Constitution\n\nSerbia told that Belgrade will be the center of Yugoslavia. This constitution has name of Serbian saint. Croats and Slovenians wanted 6 entities what was fair. Serbia wanted one center, Belgrade. How could anyone accept that.\n\nUstashe means - people who stand up for their country. Ustati in Croatian means \"to stand up\". This Serbian behavior with Belgrade as center, Serbian decisions were the source of Croatian wake up call.\n\nJosip Broz Tito was from mixed ethnicity, his father was Croatian, his mother was Slovenian. He was born in Kumrovec, Croatia.\n\nBut there are many stories about his real origin. His life is a mystery. But Croats didn't like him, because he killed them, there are many protests of Croatian people in Zagreb who protest against name of one square in Zagreb, who carries the name of Marshall Josip Broz Tito Square. There is also small gathering in his native city, but he has maybe 100 worshipers who come there. He was very ritch while people were mostly poor.\n\nPartisans were from all countries, but many of them they were Serbians. Partisans were always against Independent Croatia, no matter from what country they came.\n\nNobody cant put 6,7 nations in one country, especially if there are three religions. SFRJ was not free, you couldn't say what you think, media censure, if you say anything against Tito, you would go in prison, questioning, there was a song: \"Tito, we sware you, that we won't go away from your direction\".\n\nPeople sang that on stadiums, there were many these useless manifestations on stadiums, army, children needed to wear silly clothes, blue partisan caps, with red star, learn long and stupid songs at school.\n\nDo you learn long songs in honor of your president? Do you need to read endless books of Karl Marx, or State self-managing and protection? Older generations learned that. They had working actions also, they needed to build roads, bridges, for free. It was hard life back than. Croatians from Istria went in Trieste to buy jeans and coffee, Yugoslavia didn't had nothing, they didn't wanted to import goods from abroad. There wasn't western music, customs, cars, in Yugoslavia were produced bad and uncomfortable cars.\n\nIn 70's people went in Germany to buy normal cars. Partisans didn't care about their heritage, but there were people who liked their heritage. They were silly ideas, of superior state, with justice. It was all false.\n\nAfter 1990 we could hear for the first time about Bleiburg, massacres of Croats in woods and caves. In Slovenia there are many caves: Macelj, Huda jama.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huda_Jama\n\nEvery month appears 2,3 graveyards in ex-Yugoslavia. Even in Koruska (Karnten). Nobody knows how much graveyards exists, Croatia didn't had lustration like other ex-communist countries.\n\nThese are places of massive graveyards in Croatia during this war from 1991-1995:\n\nhttp://www.hic.hr/ratni-zlocini/masovne grobnice u RH/karta masovnih grobnica u RH.jpg\n\n4500 of people were found in this graveyard: http://dnevnik.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/otkrivena-nova-masovna-grobnica-iz-drugog-svjetskog-rata.html\n\nThere are 600 graveyards in Slovenia, 840 in Croatia and 90 in Bosnia and Herzegovina. All this was happened after World War II. That's a lot for altruistic country like Yugoslavia.\n\nIn World War II there were around 300 000 Italians, only 50 000 came back in Italy I think. Tito invested everything for him and his family, received sill persons from movie, singers and citizens payed everything. He made a big boat, he traveled several times around the globe with this boat. The name of boat was Galeb (Seagull). He occupied islands of Brijuni in Istria, nobody could came there as a tourist except you had his invitation.\n\nHe had good relations with weird leaders, Yugoslavia never had big political influence in the world. The country was one man show, there were no electios at all, multi-party system never existed.\n\nSerbians started first when they created their constitution in 1918. Yugoslavia was isolated country. When World War came Croats needed to enter in weird alliances to anyone just so that they get their own country. Croats were communists also, never said the opposite, but there were also pro-Croatian people.\n\nWar from 1990-1995 was between Croatia, Serbia and Muslims from Bosnia and Herzegovina. First there was Muslim-Serbian alliance, after Srebrenica they saw that they aren't Muslim friends, so they joined to Croats. Ir was triangle of killings.\n\nCroatian partisans never wanted Croatia, they wanted Yugoslavia.\n\nSydney is the biggest city in Australia, but it isn't the capital of Australia.\n\nMladost and Dubrovnik are still best waterpolo world clubs. Cibona has financial problems, same like Crvena Zvezda in football. Yugoslavia was anti-capitalist country, now these clubs can find sponsors, investors, before nobody had ownership on anything. Who could buy foreign players. Nobody.\n\nIf Croatia didn't bought this weapon, Croatia would be defeated. I know that Italy, Austria, and Germany watch on their own interest, in Croatia exists many Italian, Austrian banks, German communication company. They came to collect for their assistance in the past.\n\nYugoslavia pressured way before Pavelic, wright after 1918. Pavelic was outside of Yugoslavia. You need to see source and consequence.\n\nAnte Pavelic isn't the source, he is a consequence, because of bad laws in Yugoslavia, bad and against non-Serbian people.\n\nIn Yugoslavia Croatia was puppet state also and yet ritcher than puppet owner Serbia. They will lose new region very soon, nothing to do with Croatia. Hungarians don't like their iron hand in Vojvodna also. Croatians are there third nation, Hungarians are louder than us. Pavelic is in his Madrid graveyard, nothing to do with nationalism, people just want their freedom and like to decide about their future.\n\nI would like to see you how would you react if your official language is French, or Austrian. Until Croatia your compatriots haven't any respect in Yugoslavia, they changed their last names, for example Morosini into Morožin, Voschione into Voškion, just so that thez look more Slavenic and that they can stay a live. Now Italians have good rights, schools, language, they can keep their heritage. I don't see nothing bad in this, only radical countries see bad thing in this, like Yugoslavia.\n\nAlbanians from Kosovo couldn's speak Albanian language, this language isn;t similar at all to Croatian or Serbian, same like Italian and German, nothing similar. But they needed to learn Serbo-Croatian and they spoke always very bad, Serbians always made a laugh because of how they speak.\n\nOn Goli Otok there were between 16 000 and 32 000 of \"residents\".\n\nThis camp was founded from Serbian commandant of UDBA Stevo Krajacic and Slovenain Eduard Kardelj. Goli Otok was for males and St. Grgur was for females.\n\nTitoism - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titoism\n\nAntifascism=Communism in Yugoslavia. Communism wasn't different in Yugoslavia or in Italy, or in South America, different postulates. Antifascism was just better political name for communist dictatorship.\n\nTito wanted that archbishop Stepinac breaks connection with Vatican, 1300 year long connection, he didn't wanted to accept that. He talked about independent Croatia, he saved many Jewish people, one Jewish woman made PHD distertation about Stepinac and she said that he was person for justice.\n\nShe is from New York.\n\nBelgrade had money from Croatian coast and managed with Croatian savings in banks. They took everything. Best proof is this: Serbia now without Croatia is one of the poorest countries in Europe. Before they were ritch. What happened here? Croatia keeps money for Croatia. If someone is ignorant and careless or lazy nobody wants to live with that person.\n\nWhat happened than? They didn't had war in Serbia, eastern Croatia was\n\ncompletely destroyed, in Croatia there are a lot mine fields, many refugees came in Croatia from Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Croatia took them all, and again Croatia jas better position than Serbia. Serbia stole our historical treasure, robbed Croatian houses, taking away cattle in rural area, all sorts of material and again they are poor. Whole world saw their politics and everyone knows what kind of creatures are they.\n\nCroatians would rather be 32 on World Cup than play again in Yugoslavia and be first on the world. Even than there wasn't transparent rules about invitations, if you are a Croatian player, especially if you were catholic you were erased from the list, for example Croatian player Stjepan Deveric made a sign of cross before entrance, he was never called again.\n\nNow you see all types of cross formulas on court.\n\nYugoslavia repressed non-Serbian people before World War II. Why didn't they let us go in 1971. Pavelic was dead, Nazi systems also. They punched students like dogs.\n\nYugoalsvian secret police killed Croatians outside of Yugoslavia. They were from Italy-Chile-Australia maybe.\n\nBruno Busic was born 1939, he was 2,3 years when Pavelic came.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Bušić\n\nHe died because he wrote books against communism. He wanted Crotia on democratical priciples. Many of them were lawyers, poets, without any military education.\n\nThese Croatians in Yugoslav Parliament were from Peasant Party.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puniša_Račić\n\nStjepan Radic - wounded member died 1928 year. 12,13 years before WW2.\n\nSerbians killed Croatians and pressured them way before WW2.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stjepan_Radić\n\nThese were killed in 1928 year.\n\nĐuro Basariček - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Đuro_Basariček\n\nKiller Punisa Racic died 1944. - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puniša_Račić\n\nThese killings had nothing to do with Nazi, Fascismo or Ustashe. Everyone seems to forget ages before 1939. Croatian wake up in World War 2 is consequence, not source. History proofs that, not me.\n\nYou know many informations about ex-Yugoslavia, but some fields you don't know, some reasons or motives.\n\nMihajlovic is a Croatian hater, he and whole Serbian national team uses provocations against Croatians. Dejan Savicevic insulted Croatian fan infront of cameras:\n\n[ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t9ICmdFxBA\"]Srbija u grupi sa Hrvatskom, popu?i ga purgeru - YouTube[/ame]\n\nHe said to one fan: \"I f*** you in your deformed mouth you stupid Purger\". Purger is resident of Zagreb, from German word Burger-Citizen. Savicevic is ordinary peasant. Same is Dejan Stankovic, Mihajlovic, Igor Mirkovic, Dragan Stojkovic.\n\nMirkovic pulled Robert Jarni for testicles in match against Croatia, he got the red card and he pulled 3 fingers as provocation to Croatian fans. Under 3 fingers Serbian soldiers sing in Croatian cities: \"Slobodan send us the salad, it will be the meat, it will be the meat, we will slaughter Croats\" That was from 1991-1995. Translation in Croatian has better rhyme: \"Slobodane, pripremi salate, bit ce mesa, bit ce mesa, klat cemo Hrvate\".\n\nVery human soldiers. Slobodan was Serbian president, Slobodan Milosevic, died in Haag prison.\n\nBosnian flag made by EU, national anthem without lyrics, only Muslims are invited in that team. You could play for that team? Bosnia and Herzegovina were Croatian historical regions, we came first there, Serbians came second, Ottoman Empire converted Serbians and Croatians into Muslims.\n\nWhy didn't Roman Empire existed? To much nations, to much differences, similar is with Yugoslavia. 6 nations, 3 religions, plus other nations in every republic: Italians, Germans, Austrians, Czech, Slovaks, Ukranians, Hungarians, Romanians, Hebrews, Romani people, Polish people, Russian people, Pomak people, Albanians, Gorani people. They even aren't in Slavic group. To much nations in ex-Yugoslavia."
