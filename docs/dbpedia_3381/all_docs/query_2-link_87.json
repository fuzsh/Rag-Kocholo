The athletes represent multiple sports including wrestling, soccer, tennis, track and field and football.\n\nJaiden Fields is a two-year starter for the Georgia Bulldogs and started 51 games last season. She hit .331 with 10 home runs and 37 RBI in 151 at-bats.\n\nLSU hurdler Alia Armstrong also joins Kerkvliet and Washington as NCAA champions. Armstrong ran 12.57 seconds in the 100-meter hurdles. She won an NCAA championship during the outdoor track and field season.\n\nSPORTS NEWSLETTER: Sign up now to get daily updates in your inbox\n\nThe class also includes five football players.
