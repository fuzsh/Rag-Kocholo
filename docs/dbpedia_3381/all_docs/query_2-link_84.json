        "text": "Welcome to vballrecruiter.comâ€™s player rankings! We developed our star rankings system for each class with our own research combined with input and feedback from our recruiting panel created to assist us in the process in hopes of delivering a fair assessment of each player listed. The rankings are fluid and will be updated throughout the year and thus are subject to change and by no means are final. Lastly, it is imperative to understand we feel making the list is an honor regardless of the level a player is ranked at. There are only so many five and four-star recruits in any class and a three-star ranking is a sign that a player is among a select group from a vast class of players from around the country."
