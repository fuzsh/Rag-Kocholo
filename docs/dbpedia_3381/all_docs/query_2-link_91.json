In 2004 she became the first U.S. fencer to win an Olympic gold medal in 100 years and the first U.S. women’s fencer to win gold. In 2008, she won a second gold and also added a team bronze. If she wins a medal in Rio, Zagunis would tie former Fighting Irish track & field All-American/head coach Alex Wilson (’32) for the most medals won by a Notre Dame athlete in Olympic competition (four).\n\nRegarded as the most decorated fencer in U.S. history, Zagunis is the No. 1 ranked U.S. fencer (women’s sabre) and is also No. 3 in the world. She was the U.S. Olympic flag bearer for the 2012 Games in London.\n\nZagunis is a five-time Senior World Cup Champion (2005, 2009-12) and she was inducted into FIE Hall of Fame in 2013. She is the first U.S. fencer to have four World Championship gold medals and she has finished the year as the world No. 1 five times.\n\nIn two seasons at Notre Dame, she was the 2005 NCAA Championship runner-up and then she went on to win the 2006 NCAA Championship. In 2005 she also helped the Irish to the NCAA Team Championship.\n\nShe is the daughter of Robert and Cathy Zagunis, who were both rowers on the 1976 U.S. Olympic Team.\n\nTwitter:Â @marielzagunis\n\nRead:Â Strong of Heart: Mariel Zagunis\n\nCAREERÂ HONORS\n\n2004, 2008, 2012, 2016 Olympic Games Participant (United States)\n\n2004 & 2008 Olympic Gold Medalist (Individual Sabre)Â\n\n2008 Olympic Bronze Medalist (Team Sabre)\n\n2012 United States Olympic Flag Bearer\n\n2006 NCAA Sabre Champion\n\n2005 NCAA Team Champion\n\n2005 NCAA Sabre Runner-Up\n\n2006 World Cup Points Champion Member of U.S. National Team\n\nHighly-decorated sabre talent who owns the most unique accomplishments of any competitor in U.S. fencing history, headlined by gold-medal performances at the 2004 Olympics in Athens and 2008 Olympics in Beijing … was selected to lead the 529-member United States Olympic Team as the American flag bearer in the 2012 Olympics in London … after two years at Notre Dame, elected to turn professional and give up her remaining collegiate eligibility prior to the 2006-07 season … won NCAA women’s sabre title in 2006, besting her Olympic teammate Emily Jacobson of Columbia in rematch of title bout from 2005 (when Zagunis played a lead role in ND winning the combined NCAA team title) … finished 2006 as the No. 1 women’s sabrist in the world, according to the FIE rankings … as a pro, ended as the year-end world No. 1 in 2009, ’10 and ’11 … her most noteworthy fencing accomplishments include becoming: the first U.S. fencer to win an Olympic gold medal in 100 years; the first U.S. women’s fencer ever to clinch an Olympic medal finish; the third fencer (first since 1968) – and sixth woman – ever to be the U.S. Olympic flag bearer (in ’12); the second U.S. fencer to win an FIE World Cup season points title (in ’06); one of the first U.S. fencers (from either gender), along with club teammate Becca Ward, ever to reach a World Championship gold-medal bout (silver medal, in ’06), with only one previous U.S. fencer having earned a World Championship medal … if she wins a medal in London, Zagunis would tie former Fighting Irish track & field All-American/head coach Alex Wilson (’32) for the the most medals won by a Notre Dame athlete in Olympic competition — Wilson earned four medals for his native Canada at the 1928 Amsterdam Olympics (bronze in 4×400-meter relay) and the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics (silver in 800 meters; bronze in both 400 meters and 4×400-meter relay) … tremendous athlete (youth soccer player) with great tactical skill … employs tireless training and “all-business” approach for every bout (regardless of the level of competition ) … benefited from training under former Notre Dame assistant coach Ed Korfanty, developing a wide variety of actions on the strip … very goal-oriented in all aspects of her life, including extensive endurance training … her background in soccer can be seen in her athleticism, speed, anticipation skills and quick reaction time … delayed enrolling at Notre Dame one year in order to pursue Olympic dream … product of Oregon Fencing Alliance, along with eventual Notre Dame teammates Valerie Providenza, Patrick Ghattas and Bill Thanhouser … one of seven athletes featured in the Showtime special “Bud Greenspan Presents Athens 2004: Stories of Olympic Glory” … that special (Nov. ’05) told the inspiring tale of Zagunis and other Olympians … honored by her home state of Oregon as the 2004 Bill Hayward Amateur Athlete of the Year … finished collegiate career with a .962 winning pct.
