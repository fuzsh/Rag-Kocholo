        "text": "John Edward Thomas Moynahan\n\nJohn Edward Thomas Moynahan is the son of football quarterback, Tom Brady, and actress, Bridget Moynahan. Brady has won six Super Bowls and four Super Bowl MVP awards. Due to his various accomplishments, he is viewed as the greatest quarterback in the history of NFL. His active career with the New England Patriots spans for 19 years and counting.\n\nIf John pursues his father’s legacy in the future, we have no doubt that he will be the next football superstar. John has younger half-siblings (Benjamin and Vivian) as his father went on to marry famous supermodel, Gisele Bundchen. “I love him [John] the same way as if he were mine. I already feel like he’s my son, from the first day,” Gisele said of John.\n\nSam Alexis Woods\n\nSam Alexis Woods is the sibling of Charlie and daughter to world-famous golfer, Tiger Woods, and Swedish model, Elin Nordegren. She was named “Sam” because Tiger’s father often called him Sam when he was young. Unlike her brother, who displays golf skills like a pro, Sam enjoys playing soccer more.\n\nAlthough their parents divorced after a big scandal due to Tiger’s publicized infidelity, Sam and Charlie spend quality time with their father and mother as much as possible. What can we say, these kids are born to love sports just like their famous father, who surpassed various challenges to excel in his chosen career.\n\nSimone Alexandra Johnson\n\nSimone Alexandra Johnson is the 15-year-old daughter of actor and retired professional wrestler, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. The young woman turned heads after accompanying her celebrity daddy on the red carpet for the People’s Choice Awards. Just one look at the photo and truly, anyone will be stunned with her beauty and charming presence.\n\nDwyane revealed that Simone is fond of imitating his wrestling catchphrases, taking loving digs at him by saying things like “do you smell what The Rock is cooking?” Are we seeing a future actress in Simone? Let’s wait for her shining glory as The Rock’s lovely daughter is bound to unleash more of her talent in no time.\n\nEarvin III Johnson\n\nSon to the legendary basketball player, Magic Johnson, Earvin Johnson III, better known as EJ, rose to fame after his notable appearance on E’s reality television series, Rich Kids Of Beverly Hills. Despite the brief run of the show, his popularity earned him his own spin-off, titled EJNYC.\n\nThe young TV personality and socialite is known for his androgynous style in fashion and is friends with Tiffany Trump, Kyra Kennedy, and Andrew Warren. With his bold and witty personality, we won’t be surprised to see him make it big in no time. Keep doing you, Earvin! Your father must be truly proud of your accomplishments.\n\nJasmine Jordan\n\nWho doesn’t know the greatest basketball player of all time? Of course, we all do! Michael Jordan played for 15 seasons in NBA and was one of the instrumental players who popularized the NBA across the world during the 1980s and the 1990s. Although he retired from playing, he is still active in the popular sport as he currently serves as the chairman and owner of the Charlotte Hornets.\n\nMichael Jordan has three children with former wife, Juanita Vanoy; and his daughter, Jasmine, has an eye for sports, just like her father. Jasmine earned her bachelor’s degree in sports management from Syracuse University and currently works as Nike’s field marketing representative.\n\nTanita Strahan\n\nMichael Strahan is a former NFL player who spent 15 years with the New York Giants as defensive end. Following his retirement from football, Michael became a media personality. He currently serves as a football analyst on NFL Sunday, and he also co-hosts ABC's Strahan and Sara.\n\nStrahan also used to work with Kelly Ripa (from 2012 to 2016) on the daytime talk show, Live! with Kelly and Michael, which earned him two daytime Emmy awards. The popular athlete and host is also a proud family man who fathered four children: Tanita, Isabella, Sophia, and Michael Jr. His eldest child, Tanita, attended high school and college in Texas, the hometown of her father.\n\nSydney Simpson\n\nSydney Brooke is the daughter of O.J. Simpson and Nicole Brown.

This girl has what it takes: beauty, wit and confidence.\n\nMyla Rose & Charlene Riva Federer\n\nRoger Federer is currently ranked no. 7 worldwide in men’s singles tennis. His versatility in playing tennis and amazing footwork earned him 20 Grand Slam singles titles. He married former professional tennis player, Miroslava Federer, and had their identical twin girls, Myla Rose and Charlene Rivka, in 2009.\n\nThe couple’s second set of twins, this time boys, were born in May 2014. Federer said in an interview that he will not push any of his children into playing tennis, and instead he will let them choose and play any sport they truly like.

And we kinda think it’s an achievement in and of itself to have not one but two sets of identical twins!\n\nJerry Rice Jr.\n\nApparently, Jerry Rice Jr. is the son of Jerry Rice, a former NFL wide receiver for the San Francisco 49ers.

With his son’s current performance in basketball, we have no doubt that Shareef will steal the spotlight in no time. Did we mention that he also got his towering height from his father? It definitely runs in the genes.\n\nBrooke Hogan\n\nBrooke Ellen Bollea, better known by her stage name Brooke Hogan, is a television star and singer.

We hope he’ll consider carrying on his dad’s legacy and playing football soon (fingers crossed).\n\nMatthew Kerrigan\n\nMatthew Kerrigan is the eldest child of former figure skater, Nancy Kerrigan. Matthew and his two other siblings know how to skate and are also engaged with other activities. Their mother was elected into the US Figure Skating Hall of Fame but perhaps more memorable than her international recognition and numerous titles and awards was the attack that she suffered in 1994.\n\nNancy was walking through a corridor after her practice when Shane Stant, friend of fellow competitor Tonya Harding’s ex-husband, hit her right leg with a police baton. Tonya pleaded guilty of the attack and Nancy has since moved on. In fact, she resumed with her intensive training after recovering from the traumatic incident.\n\nAlexandra Stevenson\n\nAnother NBA superstar player who has an incredibly entertaining child is Julius Erving. His daughter with sportswriter, Samantha Stevenson, has made a name for herself in the world of sports.

Recognized as a three-time NBA champion and Most Valuable Player in 2006, it’s obvious that Dwyane passed his playing skills to Zaire which are impressively delivered by his son.\n\nZeke Thomas\n\nAnother kid of an ultra famous athlete is Zeke Thomas. His father is Isiah Thomas III, a retired basketball player who was named as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History and a 12-time NBA All-Star. Any son with a father like Isiah would be expected to pursue the same passion in the field of basketball, but Zeke chose a different path.\n\nZeke is, in fact, a successful DJ with regular gigs in New York, Miami and Las Vegas. His expertise in DJing, and of course, his father’s connection with basketball earned him a spot as the official DJ of an NBA All-Star game.

This ad may well be turned into a reality. Pro-boxer that he is, with various accolades under his belt, Mike can greatly help Amir in becoming one if he so chooses. Mike Tyson was nicknamed “Kid Dynamite” and “Iron” due to his ferocious style in boxing and his intimidating behaviour both in and out of the ring.\n\nJarret Payton\n\nJarrett Walter Payton is a former football running back for the Toronto Argonauts (2009) and Chicago Slaughter (2010-2012).

In 2015, he also served as a sports reporter for WGN-TV. He got it from his daddy—versatility at its finest!\n\nAntron Pippen\n\nAside from Sophia Pippen, Scottie Pippen’s son from his previous marriage is also making a name for himself. Antron Pippen plays basketball too but not in the NBA. However, we’re sure he and his father are dreaming of a slot for him in the world-famous basketball association anytime soon.\n\nScottie is one of the legendary basketball players of the NBA during the ‘90s and his performances with the Chicago Bulls was nothing short of stunning.

What are we saying, of course he will!\n\nRobin Borg\n\nBjörn Rune Borg is a celebrated world champion tennis player. He was widely regarded as one of the greatest players in the history of tennis.

Way to go, Robin!\n\nTrevor Gretzky\n\nWayne Douglas Gretzky is a retired professional hockey player and head coach.

With his legendary father as his coach, we’re confident that Trevor will get to his dream field and start taking out his dream awards.\n\nCharlie Woods\n\nWhen you’re a child to one of the world’s most popular athletes, expect to be a favorite subject among the media, fans and sports analysts.

In 2017, he inked a deal with the Orioles and played for the Aberdeen Ironbirds.\n\nLaila Ali\n\nLaila Ali is a former professional boxer who held multiple titles from the WBC, WIBA and IBF. Such accomplishments of Laila are no surprise as she is the daughter of Muhammad Ali, considered to be one of the greatest boxers of all time.\n\nLaila started boxing when she was 18 years old after watching a Christy Martin fight. When she told her father about her plans of boxing professionally, Muhammad was not happy due to the dangers of the combat sport.

Of course, her father must have been proud of her.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo Jr.\n\nTeam captain of the Portugal national team, Cristiano Ronaldo is considered by many to be the best player in the world.

Although LeBron is happy that he has naturally passed his playing skills to his son, he is not in a hurry to pass on his fame due to fear of the effects of public scrutiny. “My son is going to be a kid as long as he can be. That’s all he needs to worry about,” he said.\n\nRachel Bradshaw\n\nRachel Bradshaw is the daughter of former Hall of Fame and NFL quarterback Terry Bradshaw and family attorney Charla Hopkins.

Unfortunately, her husband died in a tragic car accident.\n\nJoseph Baena\n\nDid you know that actor and former governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, has a secret love child?

Kennedy.\n\nBorn in 1997, Joseph Baena was hidden until 2011, when the press discovered his real identity. It took seven years for Arnold to discover that he was Joseph’s father when he “started looking like him.” Indeed, Arnold’s genes were so strong that it cannot be denied that John is his son.
