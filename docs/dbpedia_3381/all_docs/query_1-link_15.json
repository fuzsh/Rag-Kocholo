Have an account? .\n\nCarl Nassib made history in 2021 by becoming the first openly gay man to actively play in the NFL.\n\nSheryl Swoopes and Megan Rapinoe identify as lesbians.\n\nCaitlyn Jenner, Patricio Manuel, Fallon Fox, and Renée Richards are transgender athletes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2021, Carl Nassib became the first active NFL player to come out as gay.\n\nIn June 2021, NFL defensive end Carl Nassib came out as gay in a video posted to his Instagram, adding he donated $100,000 to The Trevor Project, an organization that focuses on suicide prevention in LGBTQ youth after he struggled with his sexuality for 15 years.\n\n\"I just want to take a quick moment to say that I'm gay,\" Nassib said in the video. \"I just think that representation and visibility are so important. I actually hope that like one day videos like this and the whole coming-out process are just not necessary, but until then I'm going to do my best and my part to cultivate a culture that's accepting, that's compassionate.\"\n\nNassib signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers this summer after spending the previous two seasons with the Raiders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLuke Prokop became the first NHL player to come out as gay.\n\nProkop, a prospect with the Nashville Predators, wrote in an Instagram post that he was \"no longer scared to hide who I am.\"\n\nHe added: \"From a young age I have dreamed of being an NHL player, and I believe that living my authentic life will allow me to bring my whole self to the rink and improve my chances of fulfilling my dreams.\"\n\nAccording to USA Today, no NHL player — active or retired — had come out as gay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBillie Jean King, a professional tennis player, was outed in 1981.\n\nBillie Jean King is one of the most famous names in professional tennis. Over the course of her career, she earned 39 Gram Slam titles from 1966 to 1975. She also beat Bobby Riggs in the famous \"Battle of the Sexes\" match. But in 1981, King was outed as a lesbian, and her publicists told her to deny the claim.\n\n\"I said: 'I'm going to do it. I don't care. This is important to me to tell the truth.'\" King told NBC News 44 years later. \"The one thing my mother always said, 'To thine own self be true.'\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRenée Richards, another professional tennis player, was one of the first transgender athletes.\n\nRenée Richards transitioned in the '70s, and in 1976, she applied to participate in the US Open. She refused to take the required Barr body test, which would test her blood to find out her sex. When she was rejected by the US Open, she sued the United States Tennis Association for gender discrimination and won.\n\nRichards eventually retired from the sport in 1981 and has gone on to become an influential coach. Today, she refuses to be put in the spotlight as a trans activist.\n\n\"Years ago I was the pioneer, no question about it. They all quoted me and my court case,\" she told Sports Illustrated in 2019. \"But I am not anymore.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael Sam was the first openly gay man to be drafted into the NFL.\n\nIn 2014, Michael Sam came out as gay in an interview with ESPN and made history that same year. He was drafted by the St. Louis Rams, becoming the first openly gay man to ever be drafted into the NFL.\n\n\"Since February and my big announcement, this has been a whole [lot of] speculation of the first openly gay football player, but you know what? It's not about that. It's about playing football,\" Sam said in a press conference shortly after being drafted.\n\nUnfortunately, Sam was let go from the team, and in 2015, he announced he was leaving the sport for good.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSoccer star Megan Rapinoe is openly gay.\n\nIn 2019, the women's US national soccer team won the FIFA Women's World Cup, but it seemed all eyes were on the team's star player and captain: Megan Rapinoe. The athlete quickly made a name for herself in a series of TV interviews, where she voiced her support of women's rights and LGBTQ rights as an openly gay woman.\n\n\"I think female athletes, in general, are at the forefront of every protest in general because we're gay, we're women, we're women of color, we're sort of everything all at one time,\" Rapinoe told NBC news in 2019. \"We're unfortunately constantly being oppressed in some sort of way. So I feel like us just being athletes, us just being at the pinnacle of our game is kind of a protest in a way and is sort of defiant in and of itself.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSue Bird came out as gay in 2017 and announced she is dating Megan Rapinoe.\n\nBird, considered one of the greatest WNBA players of all-time, told ESPN that the timing to come out \"felt right.\" She added that it wasn't a secret to those who know her.\n\nRapinoe and Bird got engaged in 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRyan Russell became the first openly bisexual person in the NFL and in any major professional league.\n\nRyan Russell played for the Dallas Cowboys and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as a defensive end before becoming a free agent. But in 2019, he made headlines when he announced he is bisexual in an essay on ESPN.\n\n\"Let that sink into your brain: Even though openly LGBTQ people are thriving in every area of public life — politics, entertainment, the top corporations in America — they are so invisible in pro sports that a gossip blogger is doing a favor for a bisexual football player by not disclosing that he happens to date men,\" Russell wrote in the essay. \"Nobody should need a favor to live honestly. In nobody's world should being careful mean not being yourself. The career you choose shouldn't dictate the parts of yourself that you embrace.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRyan O'Callaghan came out as gay after retiring from the NFL.\n\nRyan O'Callaghan played six seasons in the NFL for the New England Patriots and Kansas City Chiefs. He retired in 2011, which is when he had suicidal thoughts and became addicted to painkillers because he was closeted, he said.\n\n\"My whole plan was to play football and kill myself,\" he told NBC News in 2019. \"I was convinced from a young age that my family would never love me if they knew who I really was. The things you hear as a child—every time you hear someone say 'f----t' or talk bad about a gay guy, or see something on TV and make fun of that. If you have a closeted kid, he hears every one of those times you say something. It sticks with him. This was 25 years ago. Most of the things they said were out of ignorance, not hate.\"\n\nA psychologist convinced the athlete to come out to his family instead, and when he was accepted with open arms, he came out publicly in 2017.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohn Amaechi came out as gay in 2007, four years after retiring from the NBA.\n\nAmaechi first discussed his sexuality in a memoir, \"Man in the Middle.\" He described hiding his sexuality while playing for the Utah Jazz, but said some teammates who suspected he was gay were welcoming about it.\n\nIn a 2007 interview on \"Outside the Lines,\" Amaechi, who played five seasons in the NBA, said he thought there were other gay players in the league, but said it's \"terrifying\" for some to come out.\n\n\"It's a frightening prospect. It's terrifying,\" Amaechi said. \"There are people for whom their entire world is based around this idea that people will look at them and when they look at them, they are NBA superstars, NBA players. And any change to that would be physiologically devastating. Emotionally devastating, financially devastating.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobbie Rogers was the first openly gay soccer player in a professional league.\n\nRobbie Rogers played soccer in England until 2013 when he announced he was gay and leaving the sport. He later told The Guardian that he left the sport after coming out because he didn't want the media attention and scrutiny.\n\n\"I'd just want to be a footballer,\" Rogers said in 2013. \"I wouldn't want to deal with the circus. Are people coming to see you because you're gay? Would I want to do interviews every day, where people are asking: 'So you're taking showers with guys – how's that?'\"\n\nBut a few months later, he joined the Los Angeles Galaxy team and became the first openly gay man to play in a major US professional league.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJason Paul Collins was the NBA's first openly gay player.\n\nIn 2013, Jason Paul Collins made history when he became the first person to openly come out in any of the four major professional sports. When he was a Washington Wizards center, he broke the news in an article in Sports Illustrated, writing, \"I'm a 34-year-old NBA center. I'm black. And I'm gay.\"\n\n\"I didn't set out to be the first openly gay athlete playing in a major American team sport. But since I am, I'm happy to start the conversation,\" he said. \"I wish I wasn't the kid in the classroom raising his hand and saying, 'I'm different.' If I had my way, someone else would have already done this. Nobody has, which is why I'm raising my hand.\"\n\nThe following year, Collins retired from the NBA after 13 seasons in the league.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSheryl Swoopes was an openly gay woman in the WNBA.\n\nSheryl Swoopes has three Olympic gold medals and some refer to her as the Michael Jordan of the WNBA. In 2005, she came out as gay.\n\n\"I was at a point in my life where I am just tired of having to pretend to be somebody I am not,\" Swoopes told The New York Times in 2005. \"I was basically living a lie. For the last seven, eight years, I was waiting to exhale.\"\n\nSwoopes retired from the sport in 2011.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPatricio Manuel became the first openly transgender professional boxer.\n\nPatricio Manuel started boxing professionally as a woman in the early 2000s and made a name for himself, becoming a USA National Amateur Boxing Champion.
