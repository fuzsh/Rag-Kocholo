You may not know that there are tons of past LSU Tigers that wear the uniforms of professional teams in the NFL, NBA, and other sports leagues. We’ve compiled a list of the most notable LSU alumni who went on to play in professional sports.\n\nNotable LSU Football Players Who Went on to Play in the NFL\n\nAndrew Whitworth: Offensive Tackle for the Los Angeles Rams\n\nAndrew Whitworth was a key player in LSU’s 2003 Sugar Bowl win against Oklahoma.
