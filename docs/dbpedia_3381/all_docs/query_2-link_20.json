        "text": "What children of famous professional athletes went on to play sports as well? The Mannings usually top the list of father-son athlete combinations. As do Bobby and Barry Bonds, Bobby and Brett Hull, and one day soon LeBron James and Bronny Jr. But all these second-generation sports stars played the same sport as their old man. This list is different. These are all the pro athletes who made it as a professional in a different sport than their parents. These 2nd generation pros took a chance playing a sport other than what their parents excelled at.\n\nBelieve it or not, the most famous current child of a professional athlete is Kansas City Chiefs' quarterback Patrick Mahomes, whose dad was a relief pitcher in the major leagues for almost a decade. Perhaps that's where Mahomes got his rocket arm. Then, there's other children of baseball major leaguers, such as NFL QB Jared Goff and WNBA guard Candice Wiggins. Famously, Joakim Noah was a great NBA center, but a terrible tennis player, unlike his father - Yannick Noah. There's Mike Conley Jr., whose pops was an American track star. Ironically, both of former NBA power forward Popeye Jones' sons, Seth and Caleb Jones, went on to play hockey in the NHL\n\nLook below to find out which professional athletes played different sports than their parents.\n\n1\n\nPatrick Mahomes II\n\nFather: Pat Mahomes, MLB pitcher\n\nPatrick Lavon Mahomes II (born September 17, 1995) is an American football quarterback for the Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football League (NFL). He is the son of former Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher Pat Mahomes. Mahomes played college football and college baseball at Texas Tech University. Following his sophomore year, he quit baseball to focus solely on football. Mahomes' junior year, he led all NCAA Division 1 players in multiple categories including passing yards (5,052 yards) and passing touchdowns (53 touchdowns). He then entered the 2017 NFL Draft where he was the tenth overall selection by the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nBirthplace : Tyler, Texas\n\n2\n\nTrinity Rodman\n\nFather: Dennis Rodman, Hall of Fame NBA power forward/center\n\nTrinity Rodman (born May 20, 2002) is an American professional soccer player who plays as a forward for Washington Spirit of the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL). She is the youngest player ever drafted in NWSL history.\n\nBirthplace : Newport Beach, California\n\nFather: Mike Conley, Sr., Track & Field athlete - high jump and long jump\n\nMichael Alex Conley Jr. (born October 11, 1987) is an American professional basketball player for the Utah Jazz of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was a member of the Memphis Grizzlies since the team drafted him with the fourth overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft before being traded in 2019 to the Utah Jazz. Conley is the son of Mike Conley Sr., an Olympic gold and silver medalist in track and field. He is the Grizzlies' all-time leading scorer.\n\nBirthplace : Fayetteville, Arkansas\n\n4\n\nFather: John Stephens, NFL running back\n\nSloane Stephens (born March 20, 1993) is an American professional tennis player. She is ranked in the top 20 by the Women's Tennis Association (WTA), and achieved a career-best ranking of No. 3 in the world after Wimbledon in 2018. Stephens was the 2017 US Open champion, and has won six WTA singles titles in total. Born to athletic parents with backgrounds in collegiate swimming and professional American football, Stephens was first introduced to tennis at the club across the street from her house in Fresno, California. Her stepfather was a competitive recreational tennis player and served as her primary inspiration for beginning to play the sport. Stephens moved to Florida to train at a tennis academy, ultimately working with Nick Saviano for many years. She developed into a promising junior player, reaching a career-high ITF junior ranking of world No. 5 and winning three out of four Grand Slam girls' doubles titles in 2010 alongside her partner Tímea Babos. While still just 19 years old, Stephens rose to prominence at the 2013 Australian Open with a semifinal run highlighted by an upset of then-world No. 3 Serena Williams. Although she climbed to as high as No. 11 towards the end of that year, she later regressed and stayed steadily ranked outside the top 25 through the end of 2015. At this point, Stephens switched to a new coach, Kamau Murray, under whom she returned to an elite level and won three WTA titles in the first half of 2016. Her successful year was then cut short by a foot injury that kept her sidelined for eleven months. She returned from injury in the middle of 2017 and won her first Grand Slam singles title at the US Open in just her fifth tournament back. She was also awarded WTA Comeback Player of the Year for her successful season. In 2018, Stephens continued her success by winning her first Premier Mandatory title at the Miami Open, reaching a second Grand Slam singles final at the French Open, entering the top 10 for the first time, and finishing runner-up at the WTA Finals.\n\nBirthplace : Plantation, Florida, USA\n\n5\n\nJared Goff\n\nFather: Jerry Goff, MLB catcher\n\nJared Thomas Goff (born October 14, 1994) is an American football quarterback for the Detroit Lions of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at University of California, Berkeley and was a first-team All-Pac-12 quarterback in 2015. He was selected by the Rams with the first overall pick of the 2016 NFL Draft. He started his rookie season as the backup to Case Keenum, eventually taking over as the starter during the latter half of the season. In 2018, Goff helped lead the Rams to a 13–3 record and a trip to Super Bowl LIII, the franchise's first Super Bowl appearance since the 2001 season, but lost to the New England Patriots 13-3. He has been selected to two Pro Bowls. In the summer of 2019, Goff launched his own apparel brand, JG16. In January 2021, Goff was traded to the Detroit Lions.\n\nBirthplace : Novato, California\n\n6\n\nFather: Yannick Noah, tennis player\n\nJoakim Simon Noah ( JOH-ə-kim; born February 25, 1985) is a former professional basketball player who played for the Chicago Bulls, New York Knicks, Memphis Grizzlies and Los Angeles Clippers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Born in New York City to a Swedish mother and a French father, he holds American, Swedish and French citizenship. He played college basketball for the Florida Gators, winning back-to-back NCAA championships in 2006 and 2007. The Chicago Bulls selected Noah with the ninth overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft. Noah is a two-time NBA All-Star and was named to the All-NBA First Team in 2014 when he also was named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nBirthplace : New York City, New York"
