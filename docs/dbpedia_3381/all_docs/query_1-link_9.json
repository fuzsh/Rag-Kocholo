        "text": "Our Second Annual Ranking of theBiggest Names in Sports\n\nView the List\n\nFame 100\n\nWho are the most famous athletes on the planet? Ben Alamar, ESPN's director of analytics, devised a formula that combines endorsements with social media following and internet search popularity to create the ESPN World Fame 100 rankings. (Note: NA means either an athlete doesn't have an official account for a social media site or an accurate endorsement figure could not be confirmed.)\n\nNo results found!\n\nESPN World Fame 100 methodology\n\nThe ESPN World Fame 100 is our annual attempt to create a ranking, through statistical analysis, of the 100 most famous athletes on the planet.\n\nWe started with Forbes' annual list of the highest-paid athletes and expanded the pool from there using a variety of domestic and international sources to make sure we didn't overlook any legitimate candidates. (You can find the 2016 World Fame 100 here.) We also sought input from ESPN journalists around the world, including colleagues in our bureaus in Australia, South Africa, Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Mexico and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe data for each athlete in the pool was then fed into a formula created by ESPN director of sports analytics Ben Alamar that weighs athletes' endorsements, their following on the social media Big Three (Facebook, Twitter and Instagram) and Google search popularity, producing a comparative ranking system. The analysis includes five categories: endorsement money, Twitter followers, Instagram followers, Facebook followers and Google Trends score. For special situations (esports and China) we used two additional categories: other social media -- for when the athlete was more relevant on a platform outside the Big Three (Twitch, for example, although no gamers made the top 100) -- and, in China's case, Baidu search score, because Google is blocked there.\n\nSalary is not used as a factor because of differences among sports. For example, players in a league with a salary cap would be at an unfair disadvantage when measured against players in uncapped leagues. Endorsement dollars, however, reflect the ability to draw attention -- which is a good way to define fame.\n\nEndorsement amounts cover 2016 and were compiled by ESPN researchers. All currency figures were converted to U.S. dollars using March 27 rates. The social media followings and Google Trend scores (which show relative popularity based on how often names are searched on a scale of 0 to 100) were as of April 19. (Note: Where categories in the profiles are marked as NA, the athlete either doesn't have an official account for that social media site or an accurate endorsement figure could not be confirmed.)\n\nRetired athletes are not included. Therefore, popular stars such as Tony Romo (No. 70 in 2016) and Floyd Mayweather (No. 26 in 2016) are absent. We have also excluded amateur athletes -- Deshaun Watson, Lonzo Ball and Katie Ledecky, for example -- due to lack of salary and endorsements.\n\nContributors: Primary research by Sachin Dave Chandan and Charlotte Gibson.

That's where soccer's peacock would still expect to be, his glory as one of the all-time great players still dazzling us as much as his ego, even if a few boos from Real Madrid's absurdly spoiled fans have this season hinted at CR7's fading powers at 32. Still, he steered Real Madrid to another Champions League triumph and Portugal to the European Championship in 2016 and lifted the Ballon d'Or as the world's premier player again.\n\nBest player, worst statue?\n\nRonaldo's opinion of himself is such, you could only fear for the sculptor of the wonderfully terrible bronze bust that the player unveiled at Madeira Airport, now renamed in honor of the island's favorite son. The likeness was so bad, even Ronaldo had to laugh at himself -- not something you can say too often. -- Ian Chadband\n\nIt's been said\n\n\"He's a world star in soccer like Michael Jordan was in basketball. They have both been blessed with a genius that has never been seen before.\" -- Carlos Queiroz, former Real Madrid and Portugal manager\n\nMore: When Zidane talks, Ronaldo listens\n\nCristiano Ronaldo\n\nPortuguese soccer player | Real Madrid\n\n$32MEndorsements\n\n93MInstagram Followers\n\n118.1MFacebook Followers\n\n50.4MTwitter Followers\n\nLast Year's rank: 1\n\nDavid Liam Kyle/NBAE/Getty Images\n\n2\n\nLeBron James\n\nWhy he's got fame\n\nHero ... villain ... superhero. That's James' career arc in his home state of Ohio. James turned the moribund Cavaliers into a contender -- only to take his talents to Miami in 2010 and win two championships with the Heat. James returned to Cleveland after four years in subtropical exile, and in his second year back, the Cavs memorably overcame a 3-1 NBA Finals deficit to capture their first championship. Fans once jilted by James adore him again, and, still dominating at age 32, he might be delivering them thrills for years to come.\n\nActing chops\n\nJames received rave reviews for his appearance in the 2015 Amy Schumer film \"Trainwreck\" and is slated to star in the forthcoming \"Space Jam 2.\" Will he add an Oscar to his four MVP trophies? Stay tuned. -- Thomas Neumann\n\nIt's been said\n\n\"I've never seen a man in my life tell an entire state: 'Get on my back, I got you. Get on my back and I'm going to carry you.'\" -- Richard Jefferson, Cleveland teammate\n\nLeBron James\n\nAmerican basketball player | Cleveland Cavaliers\n\n$55MEndorsements\n\n28.5MInstagram Followers\n\n22.6MFacebook Followers\n\n34.4MTwitter Followers\n\nLast Year's rank: 2\n\nJose Manuel Alvarez Rey/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\n3\n\nLionel Messi\n\nWhy he's got fame\n\nHe remains the greatest current exponent of global soccer, a player of such otherworldly skill that the one remaining question to be answered in his career is whether he can be considered the best in the game's history. We could wax lyrical all day about the Barcelona and Argentina nonpareil's unreal goals, visionary assists and magic wand of a left foot, but it's surely better to simply follow his old mentor Pep Guardiola's wistful advice: \"Don't write about him, don't try to describe him. Just watch him.\"\n\nWords can't describe\n\nHaving run out of superlatives for the man, a new word -- \"inmessionante\" -- has been created for Messi, earning its debut in a Spanish dictionary. Its meaning? \"The perfect way to play football.\" -- Ian Chadband\n\nIt's been said\n\n\"Messi is outside all praise. He does things you do not see even in 'Oliver and Benji' (a soccer-themed anime series) or PlayStation. What he does touches the impossible. We're used to it, but it is a delight and a privilege to have the best player in the world in your team.\" -- Luis Enrique, Barcelona manager\n\nLionel Messi\n\nArgentine soccer player | Barcelona\n\n$28MEndorsements\n\n65.1MInstagram Followers\n\n86.6MFacebook Followers\n\nNATwitter Followers\n\nLast Year's rank: 3\n\nClive Brunskill/Getty Images for The Laver Cup\n\n4\n\nRoger Federer\n\nWhy he's got fame\n\nHe's the most successful male tennis player in history, with the most Grand Slam singles titles (18) and final appearances (28). Fed has held the No. 1 ranking for 302 weeks in his career, the most by any man. And he continued to bolster his fame this year when he won the 2017 Australian Open, becoming at age 35 the oldest man to win the event since Ken Rosewall in 1972.\n\nNot mailing it in\n\nIn 2007, Switzerland issued a postage stamp bearing Federer's image, making him the country's first living person to be so honored. And he'd won only 10 of his Grand Slams at the time. -- Jim Caple\n\nIt's been said\n\n\"What makes it so special is that he doesn't just take something from you and just keep on going. He looks directly at you, says, 'Thank you,' stops to talk, makes you feel that it's no chore for him.\" -- Colleen Taylor, one of Federer's many devoted followers, on how he treats his fans\n\nMore: Federer is having too much fun to quit now\n\nRoger Federer\n\nSwiss tennis player\n\n$60MEndorsements\n\n2.8MInstagram Followers\n\n14.2MFacebook Followers\n\n6.7MTwitter Followers\n\nLast Year's rank: 5\n\nScott Halleran/PGA of America via Getty Images\n\n5\n\nPhil Mickelson\n\nWhy he's got fame\n\nHe has won five majors. In the era of Tiger Woods and with 11 runner-up finishes in majors, that tends to be both overlooked and underrated. And in the context of his career, those 11 near misses, along with 23 top-three finishes and 38 top-10 finishes at majors -- and his longevity (700-plus weeks in the top 10 of the world rankings) -- puts him in some experts' top 10 of all time.\n\nMoney man\n\nMickelson isn't just wealthy for an athlete. He came in at No. 18 on Forbes' 2016 list of America's richest celebrities with a net worth of $375 million, beating Barbra Streisand by one spot. Woods was the only active athlete ahead of Mickelson. -- Melissa Isaacson\n\nIt's been said\n\n\"It's not like I have decades left of opportunities to win majors, so each one of these means a lot to me.\" -- Mickelson, after finishing second at The Open last year at age 46\n\nPhil Mickelson\n\nAmerican golfer\n\n$50MEndorsements\n\nNAInstagram Followers\n\nNAFacebook Followers\n\nNATwitter Followers\n\nLast Year's rank: 13\n\nFABRICE COFFRINI/AFP/Getty Images\n\n6\n\nNeymar\n\nWhy he's got fame\n\nThe bewilderingly brilliant Brazilian keeps wooing us with tales of the wholly improbable. Last year, it was to deliver the dream finale to Brazil's Olympics with the glorious free kick and winning shootout penalty against Germany to earn gold. This year, it was inspiring the greatest comeback in the game's annals for Barcelona against Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League with an individual tour de force that Liverpool great Steve Gerrard hailed as one of the greatest he'd ever seen. And he's still on course to take over from Messi as the world's finest.\n\nLights, camera, action!\n\nNeymar took down one of the baddies with a nifty bit of footwork in his movie debut in \"xXx: Return of Xander Cage\" this year. Soccer's greatest actor? Funny, that's exactly what Celtic defender Mikael Lustig said, unimpressed by Neymar's diving in a Champions League game. -- Ian Chadband\n\nIt's been said\n\n\"Neymar is increasingly dominating every year.

Bolt has won eight Olympic gold medals in the 100-meter dash, 200-meter dash and the 4x100 relay, the most for any sprinter (it would have been nine if a 2008 Jamaican relay teammate hadn't failed a doping test), and holds the world record in the 100 (9.58 seconds) and the 200 (19.19). Bolt, 30, will get considerable attention this summer during and after the world championships in London, which he has said will be his final competition.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nHe has mentioned playing soccer with Manchester United, but perhaps he will go into cricket, a sport he loved as a kid in Jamaica. He even played in an exhibition cricket match in Bangalore a few years ago, bowling and batting his team to victory. Don't bet too heavily on either, though. -- Jim Caple\n\nIt's been said\n\n\"I don't even like to go out onto the streets sometimes because I can't get anything done.

While the move left some fans in Oklahoma jilted, Durant's overall popularity remains massive. In the April 11 rankings of worldwide NBA jersey sales, he ranked behind only teammate Stephen Curry and LeBron James. Although Durant played only one season at the University of Texas, his No. 35 is one of only three jerseys retired by the Longhorns basketball team.\n\nGlobal brand\n\nDurant recently announced plans for a visit to India this summer. He will be the first NBA player to visit the league's new developmental academy in Delhi, and he also plans to visit the Taj Mahal. -- Thomas Neumann\n\nIt's been said\n\n\"The primary mandate I had for myself in making this decision was to have it based on the potential for my growth as a player -- as that has always steered me in the right direction.\" -- Durant, on his decision to sign with the Warriors in 2016\n\nMore: Why Durant sees world differently now\n\nKevin Durant\n\nAmerican basketball player | Golden State Warriors\n\n$36MEndorsements\n\nNAInstagram Followers\n\n10.3MFacebook Followers\n\n15.5MTwitter Followers\n\nLast Year's rank: 6\n\nZak Kaczmarek/Getty Images\n\n9\n\nRafael Nadal\n\nWhy he's got fame\n\nNadal is the undisputed King of Clay, with a record nine championships at Roland Garros to go with five other Grand Slam singles titles. He won at least one Slam in a men's-record 10 consecutive years (2005-14) and has surpassed $80 million in career earnings. Although he received attention earlier in his career for wearing sleeveless shirts and capri pants on the court, he's updated to a more conventional look (yet his odd habit of picking at his shorts continues).\n\nMore than a star\n\nAll famous athletes are stars, but Nadal goes beyond that; he's an asteroid. Well, there is an asteroid named after him -- 128036 Rafaelnadal, which is 2½ miles in diameter. (No planet is named after a tennis player yet, unless you count Venus Williams.) -- Jim Caple\n\nIt's been said\n\n\"I am a little bit more famous now, but I don't have changes in my life.

By age 30, he had won 10 majors and seemed sure to eclipse the all-time record set by Jack Nicklaus. By 40, he had more career wins than anyone but still was four majors short of Jack. On the negative side, an infidelity scandal that went public in 2009 threatened to undermine his legacy, and he was arrested on a DUI charge on Memorial Day of 2017.\n\nCourse work\n\nAlthough Woods' playing career has been sidetracked by a seriously balky back, he has a side gig designing courses. Two of his designs have opened at private clubs, and construction of his first public course, due to open in 2019, is underway in Missouri. -- Melissa Isaacson\n\nIt's been said\n\n\"People who meet him for 30 seconds love him, and people who spend several hours with him think he's aloof and weird, while people who hang around long enough to know him end up both loving him and being oddly protective.

His style and grace captivate the masses of NBA fans, as evidenced by his jersey sitting atop the league's worldwide sales list for the second year in a row. Curry possesses virtually limitless range and helped lead the Warriors to their first NBA championship in 40 years in 2015.\n\nCha-ching\n\n\"Getting by\" on an average of $11 million a year while winning two MVPs under his current four-year deal, Curry has been one of the league's greatest bargains. But that's about to change. When he hits free agency this summer, he'll reportedly be eligible for the first NBA deal that eclipses $200 million. -- Thomas Neumann\n\nIt's been said\n\n\"I never really set out to change the game.

He also is thoughtful, articulate and often funny, known for his impersonations of fellow players -- he once sported a long, blonde wig to mimic Maria Sharapova -- and wearing a Darth Vader mask onto the court.\n\nHe is what he eats\n\nDjokovic has a restaurant group that offers gluten-free meals, as well as a vegan restaurant in Monaco. He credits his tennis success to going gluten-free, which he wrote about in an enlightening book, \"Serve to Win: The 14-Day Gluten-Free Plan for Physical and Mental Excellence.\" -- Jim Caple\n\nIt's been said\n\n\"People look up to me as somebody who is able to switch the image of our country from negative to positive.\" -- Djokovic, who grew up in Serbia during the Balkan wars\n\nNovak Djokovic\n\nSerbian tennis player\n\n$34MEndorsements\n\n3.1MInstagram Followers\n\n7MFacebook Followers\n\n7MTwitter Followers\n\nLast Year's rank: 16\n\nSonu Mehta/Hindustan Times via Getty Images\n\n13\n\nVirat Kohli\n\nWhy he's got fame\n\nOne of the best batsman in all of cricket seems to be getting better, and 2016 was particularly great. Kohli took over India's one-day international captaincy and scored over 2,500 runs in ODIs. On top of all that, he's back together with Bollywood star Anushka Sharma.\n\nElite company\n\nIn February, the 28-year-old Kohli joined the likes of Usain Bolt, Rickie Fowler and Thierry Henry as a Puma endorser. His eight-year deal with the shoe company is worth more than 100 crore rupees (approximately $15 million US), the largest ever for an Indian athlete. -- Aishwarya Kumar\n\nIt's been said\n\n\"Virat Kohli is a rare talent.

The Northern Irishman has serious global appeal, having been named PGA Tour Player of the Year twice and European Tour Golfer of the Year three times.\n\nPretty good shape\n\nMcIlroy is considered one of the fittest golfers on tour, but he was humbled when joined by Tom Brady and Peyton and Eli Manning while working out at Augusta National a couple of years ago. \"Friday morning, I got in the gym about 6.

Wade decided to re-sign with Miami, a move that paved the way for the arrival of LeBron James and Chris Bosh. Wade is married to actress Gabrielle Union, and with three NBA rings and 20,000-plus career points under his belt, he can start writing that Hall of Fame speech.\n\nSweet home Chicago\n\nAfter spending his first 13 NBA seasons in Miami, Wade signed a two-year contract last year with his hometown Bulls worth $47 million.

In reality, the zero represents the letter O, a nod to his hometown of Oakland, his college town of Ogden, Utah, (home of Weber State) and his pro state of Oregon. Lillard was unanimously named NBA Rookie of the Year in 2013, beating out No. 1 overall draft pick Anthony Davis. Since then, he has established himself as one of the most consistent scorers in the league.\n\nMusic man\n\nLike many athletes before him, Lillard has ventured into the music world. Unlike with most of those before him, his work has actually received positive reviews. His debut album, released last year under his Dame D.O.L.L.A. pseudonym, includes guest appearances by Lil Wayne, Jamie Foxx and Juvenile. -- Thomas Neumann\n\nIt's been said\n\n\"A lot of times, the team will go as I go.

At age 21 in 2010, he became the youngest American to compete in the Ryder Cup. And unlike many male golfers who declined to play, Fowler proudly represented his country at the 2016 Olympics. And regardless of his results, he has gained attention with his brightly colored fashion style on the course, sometimes wearing all orange or all blue.\n\nShowing some moves\n\nFowler and three other pro golfers, Ben Crane, Bubba Watson and Hunter Mahan, danced and sang in a faux boy band called Golf Boys for the music video \"Oh Oh Oh,\" which has received close to 8 million views on YouTube. -- Jim Caple\n\nIt's been said\n\n\"I don't want to be just known for the way I dress.

He set the bar high in that Sunday night game against the Cowboys, reeling in a 43-yard touchdown catch behind his head with one hand while fully extended, leaning backward and tip-toeing along the sideline.\n\nBieber curse strikes\n\nBeckham and three Giants teammates made headlines by partying in Miami with Justin Bieber and Trey Songz following the team's 2016 regular-season finale.

His biggest splash in the pool came in 2015, when he became China's first male swimmer to win a FINA World Championships sprint event, taking the gold in the 100 meters. Although he failed to reach the finals in his two individual events at the 2016 Rio Games, the 50 and 100 freestyle, he garnered fawning internet headlines, such as \"People Can't Stop Talking About This Hot Olympic Swimmer.\"\n\nToo much of a good thing?\n\nZetao has many sponsorship deals, from Adidas and Skullcandy to FitBit China and De Beers China. However, some of his endorsements were for competitors of the national team's sponsors, a no-no that led to him being kicked off the squad. -- Jim Caple\n\nIt's been said\n\n\"Before the race, I didn't even think about a medal, I just wanted to show my best.

Lochte's fame -- or infamy, perhaps -- skyrocketed during the 2016 Rio Olympics, when he claimed to have been robbed at a gas station. But it turned out he wasn't exactly an innocent victim and he admittedly had \"overexaggerated\" the incident, which dominated headlines for much of the games. It led to a 10-month suspension and cost Lochte several endorsement deals, but it also made him a household name.\n\nFancy footwork\n\nHe was asked to compete on \"Dancing with the Stars\" shortly after the Rio Olympics, and more controversy ensued when two men wearing anti-Lochte T-shirts tried to attack him during his debut on the show.
