        "text": "Erik Orlando Colón, an incredibly devoted son, brother, grandson, nephew, cousin, and Tió, passed away after a short illness on June 7, 2024. Erik was the light of any room he was in. He was loved and loved deeply for every one of his 45 years and will be missed by all who knew him. Born Oct. 3, 1978, in Farmington, Maine, he is survived by mother, Susan Dearborn; father, Jose Colón; sister, Monica (Colón) Wilson; brother-in-law, Daniel Wilson; nephew, Alex “A” Wilson; and niece, Julia Wilson; stepfamily: Chris Rouleau, wife Shelly Nolan (Audrey), Kate Downey (Mikey and Maryn), Liz Anderson, husband Gregg (Jake and Zach) and Diana Saavedra, and husband Levi (Eva and Olivia). He was loved as a big brother by numerous cousins and friends. Erik is predeceased by his stepfather, Paul Rouleau.\n\nErik always had a head for numbers and dazzled his family by reading baseball statistics from a very young age. He graduated in 2001 from the University of Delaware and embarked on a career in the financial services industry. He worked for Ameriprise Financial Services for 20 years, served as a compliance officer, acted as a mentor to many, and was deeply committed to his fiduciary responsibilities and to serving his clients. One of Erik’s great joys in life was his ability to help others; he was always there to problem-solve and brainstorm at the drop of a hat. Being there for his family and friends was his highest priority, always putting others’ needs ahead of his own. He excelled at planning and organizing — everything from financial plans to family vacations, he did them all with joy and gusto. When Erik was involved, things had a way of working out and, more than that, being fun! Christmas was a special time for Erik, a joy that he shared with his mother and grandmother. He reveled in excessive decoration. There was no such thing as too much Christmas or too many Hallmark movies. Sharing these with family brought him delight year after year, especially as new generations came on the scene.\n\nErik, a resident of Clinton, never did anything in half measure. Among his passions in life were the Yankees, New York Rangers, NYCFC, Man City, Dallas Cowboys, and the UConn Huskies. Erik loved adventures, travel and visiting 26 baseball stadiums all across the United States. He never met a roller coaster he wouldn’t try. A member of a travel-obsessed family, Erik visited 43 out of 50 states and 16 countries. He loved learning about his ancestry, regularly participating in the annual York Family Reunion, tracing his mother’s lineage back to the Mayflower, and his father’s family history to the Taíno Indians of Puerto Rico. There are no words to express how much Erik/Tió will be missed by those who knew him and loved him.\n\nCalling hours will be held from 5 to 8 p.m. on Monday, June 17, at Biega Funeral Home, 3 Silver Street, Middletown.

Those who wish to remember Erik in a special way, may make gifts in his memory to the Central Vermont Humane Society, www.centralvermonthumane.org CVHS 1589 VT Route 14S, East Montpelier, VT 05651."
