        "text": "By Alan Clemons\n\nAffiliate Disclosure: This page contains affiliate links. We earn from qualifying purchases.\n\nFishing and power go together, despite the latest trend with finesse tactics, and this year’s best new electronics from the 2024 ICAST Show definitely offer more punch for anglers. From trolling motors to drones, the array of new products was quite large at the 67th annual summer trade show. Here are some of the ones that got some attention.\n\nXpece One Fishing Drone\n\nIf you’re interested in filming, dropping baits on a spot or both, the Xpece ONE Fishing Drone is set up perfectly. It’s designed to withstand saltwater, sand, rain, snow and wind to 40 mph, can fly nonstop for 31 minutes, and can carry and drop baits up to 10 pounds. The bright HD Monitor integrated in the remote allows for visual tracking, and the camera works in Standard HD, Zoom or Thermal modes. Xpece says the ONE drone is ready to fly out of the box without pairing, apps or setup. It connects with up to 31 satellites. The drone has an “auto-return home” feature and “mark the drop” spot so you could put multiple baits in the same spot or change to another. $2,299 | xpece.com\n\nDakota Lithium Waterproof Max Charger\n\nThe new Dakota Lithium Max Waterproof On-Board Charger integrates on-the-water charging via the outboard alternator and a 120-volt AC wall plug. The dual input/output, switchable 24V/36V settings and additional 12V output supports multiple applications. Thanks to the Dakota Lithium active intelligence technology, it can force start a tripped Battery Management System. The unit is housed in a rugged IP67 case for protection from the elements. $899 | dakotalithium.com\n\nPenn Fathom Electric Reel\n\nThe Penn Fathom Electric reel, voted Best of Show at ICAST, is powered by a Lithium-Ion battery with a 5aH capacity, offering long-lasting performance with an optional plug-in backup. Options give a variety of programmable modes for custom drops throughout the trip. Key features include auto-stop for hands-free retrieves, override for manual jogging, a line counter providing true line-out measurement in feet or meters and more. The Fathom Electric has a maximum winding power of 35 pounds and speeds of up to 750 feet per minute, varying by reel size. It reaches depths of up to 1,000 feet and performs well in kite fishing and light trolling scenarios. Sizes include 30, 50 and 80. $849.95 | pennfishing.com\n\nAdvertisement\n\n×\n\nLowrance Eagle Eye\n\nThe new Eagle Eye live sonar unit combines with CHIRP & DownScan Imaging in one transducer without a module. Lowrance's Eagle Eye also features detailed C-MAP charting on a crystal clear IPS display. Eagle Eye provides the same best-in-class resolution seen on ActiveTarget 2 in a more focused setting. Screen sizes range from 4-9 inches, Also new this year are the Tripleshot HD and Splitshot HD units, both with wide-angle high CHIRP and high-res imaging. $999 | lowrance.com\n\nPower-Pole Dual Blade\n\nPower-Pole’s new Dual Blade powered by the ONE Pump package improves the hydraulics for more smooth, simultaneous anchor deployments and retractions. ONE Pump is nearly 15 decibels quieter thanks to its upgraded, brushless motor, circuit board and valves. It is 40 percent lighter in weight, has 41 percent less AMP draw so it’s more efficient, and is more streamlined to help save space. It creates a cleaner bilge area and frees space for other equipment. The ONE Pump package will be available on all Blade model anchors. $4,399.99 | power-pole.com\n\nGarmin Panoptix PS22-IF\n\nGarmin’s new Panoptix PS22-IF ice fishing bundle offers a unique transducer bracket and rotator design that eliminates the need for a pole mount. To help anglers determine where to drill the next hole, the bundle includes an Echomap UHD2 73sv touchscreen combo with keyed assist and two types of Panoptix sonar – LiveVü Forward and LiveVü Down. These show live sonar images up to 100 feet in any direction below the ice. Designed specifically for ice fishing, the PS22-IF transducer features a pole-free transducer system that eliminates the need for a pole mount. Additionally, the transducer features a new, removable lens so anglers can easily optimize the sonar for the water below. Preloaded with industry-leading Garmin Navionics+™, the Echomap offers mapping with up to 1-foot contours on more than 23,000 U.S. lakes. $1,999.99 | garmin.com\n\nAdvertisement\n\n×\n\nLowrance Recon\n\nThis new electronic steer trolling motor from Lowrance has a FreeSteer joystick remote, wireless foot pedal and MFD integration. If you’re at the bow or stern, you can operate the Recon. The remote is large enough to not disappear in big hands yet small enough to hang around your neck. Freshwater carbon-fiber infused composite shafts come in 48-, 54- 60- and 72-inch versions, while the saltwater models are available in 54-, 60- and 72-inch lengths. Other features include a near-silent brushless motor, precision GPS, color LCD display on the remote and more. $3,299.99 | lowrance.com\n\nDaiwa Seaborg Reel\n\nThe stunning Daiwa Seaborg 1800 M-RJ reel isn’t just flash and sizzle, as it gives anglers more options when going after big, deep fish. The power-assist Seaborg comes in three sizes. The Seaborg 1800 has a new MagMax-G motor almost twice the size of its predecessor, giving anglers about 170 percent more power during a retrieve. Nine large carbon washers were added, boosting the maximum drag to 110 pounds. Elsewhere on the boat doing something and a fish hits your bait? The Seaborg has a remote operation assist, too, with just a few touches of the remote button fob. It’s available in the largest 1800 model, along with smaller 1200 and 800 sizes. Want to reel without the power assist? No problem, as the manual right-hand setup has a powerful 2.3:1 ratio. $2,999.99 | daiwa.us\n\nVideo That May Interest You\n\n×"
