        "text": "> Busy with family, Amy Mastura says of her absence from TV\n\nSinger-actress Amy Mastura, who has been in the entertainment industry for more than 20 years, has rarely been on television recently. Her absence has led to speculation that Amy was trying to establish an \"exclusive\" celebrity status. However, the 1993 Asia Bagus singing competition winner denied this and explained that she was busy. She said she rejected many scripts and accepted roles only if the time was suitable as she has a family to take care of, she told Mega, the entertainment pull-out of the daily.\n\n> Ambulance driver demands RM250 to send patient to hospital\n\nAn ambulance driver from a local hospital allegedly tried to extort RM250 from a patient's family and a video recording of the incident went viral on the Internet. The victim refused to pay and ended up sending his mother, who was unconscious, to the hospital with the help of a friend. When they met again at the hospital, the driver defended his action, saying his monthly RM800 salary was insufficient and he would split the RM250 with four nurses."
