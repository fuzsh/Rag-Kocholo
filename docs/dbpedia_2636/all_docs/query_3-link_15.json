        "text": "Addressing Literacy and Numeracy to Improve Diabetes Care\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCavanaugh, Kerri; Wallston, Kenneth A.; Gebretsadik, Tebeb; Shintani, Ayumi; Huizinga, Mary Margaret; Davis, Dianne; Gregory, Rebecca Pratt; Malone, Robb; Pignone, Michael; DeWalt, Darren; Elasy, Tom A.; Rothman, Russell L.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nOBJECTIVE Diabetic patients with lower literacy or numeracy skills are at greater risk for poor diabetes outcomes. This study evaluated the impact of providing literacy- and numeracy-sensitive diabetes care within an enhanced diabetes care program on A1C and other diabetes outcomes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In two randomized controlled trials, we enrolled 198 adult diabetic patients with most recent A1C â¥7.0%, referred for participation in an enhanced diabetes care program. For 3 months, control patients received care from existing enhanced diabetes care programs, whereas intervention patients received enhanced programs that also addressed literacy and numeracy at each institution. Intervention providers received health communication training and used the interactive Diabetes Literacy and Numeracy Education Toolkit with patients. A1C was measured at 3 and 6 months follow-up. Secondary outcomes included self-efficacy, self-management behaviors, and treatment satisfaction. RESULTS At 3 months, both intervention and control patients had significant improvements in A1C from baseline (intervention â1.50 [95% CI â1.80 to â1.02]; control â0.80 [â1.10 to â0.30]). In adjusted analysis, there was greater improvement in A1C in the intervention group than in the control group (P = 0.03). At 6 months, there were no differences in A1C between intervention and control groups. Self-efficacy improved from baseline for both groups. No significant differences were found for self-management behaviors or satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS A literacy- and numeracy-focused diabetes care program modestly improved self-efficacy and glycemic control compared with standard enhanced diabetes care, but the difference attenuated after conclusion of the intervention.

Physicians with the lowest rates (n = 74) were targeted for comprehensive intervention. All other low-performing physicians practicing in the same clinic system (n = 121) comprised the comparison group. Data were obtained from electronic diabetes registries for 2007 and 2008. Each physician had a set of measures from 2 points in time. Measures included optimal diabetes scores and the 5 component measures of the optimal diabetes care bundle (A1C <7, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol <100, blood pressure <130/80, aspirin use if older than 40, and no tobacco use). T tests and difference-in-difference models were used to examine changes over time. Optimal diabetes scores increased 11.7 points (from 14.7% to 26.4%) for intervention physicians and 4.0 points (from 29.7% to 32.9%) for comparison physicians. The improvement was greater for the intervention group. The greatest component improvements were in control of blood pressure and cholesterol. CONCLUSIONS Coaching low-performing physicians dramatically improved the proportion of diabetes patients with optimal diabetes control. The CPR for Diabetes Care program represents an innovative and effective way to address the long-standing problem of disseminating and sustaining quality improvement efforts by focusing on low-performing physicians.\n\nDiabetes technology: improving care, improving patient-reported outcomes and preventing complications in young people with Type 1 diabetes.\n\nPubMed\n\nPrahalad, P; Tanenbaum, M; Hood, K; Maahs, D M\n\n2018-04-01\n\nWith the evolution of diabetes technology, those living with Type 1 diabetes are given a wider arsenal of tools with which to achieve glycaemic control and improve patient-reported outcomes. Furthermore, the use of these technologies may help reduce the risk of acute complications, such as severe hypoglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis, as well as long-term macro- and microvascular complications. In addition, diabetes technology can have a beneficial impact on psychosocial health by reducing the burden of diabetes. Unfortunately, diabetes goals are often unmet and people with Type 1 diabetes too frequently experience acute and long-term complications of this condition, in addition to often having less than ideal psychosocial outcomes. Increasing realization of the importance of patient-reported outcomes is leading to diabetes care delivery becoming more patient-centred. Diabetes technology in the form of medical devices, digital health and big data analytics have the potential to improve clinical care and psychosocial support, resulting in lower rates of acute and chronic complications, decreased burden of diabetes care, and improved quality of life.

This article describes the model and highlights its key achievements. With balanced representation from frontline providers through to senior decision makers in health care, the DCPNS works across the age continuum, supporting the implementation of national clinical practice guidelines and, when necessary, developing provincial guidelines to meet local needs. The development and implementation of standardized documentation and data collection tools in all diabetes centres created a robust opportunity for the development and expansion of the DCPNS registry. This registry provides useful clinical and statistical information to staff, providers within the circle of care, management and senior leadership. Data are used to support individual care, program planning, quality improvement and business planning at both the local and the provincial levels. The DCPNS supports the sharing of new knowledge and advances through continuous education for providers. The DCPNS's ability to engage diabetes educators and key physician champions has ensured balanced perspectives in the creation of tools and resources that can be effective in real-world practice. The DCPNS has evolved to become an illustrative example of the chronic care model in action. Copyright Â© 2017 Diabetes Canada. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The DHP provides improved access to care management, telephone coaching, and enhanced Internet-based communication with enrollees. The evaluation will use a quasi-experimental design, comparing patients from employer groups that offer the DHP with patients from groups that do not, to determine the effect of the DHP on incidence of diabetes, adherence to metformin, and costs of care among patients with prediabetes. Other factors studied will be cardiovascular risk factor control, adherence to preventive services, health care use, and costs of care among patients with existing diabetes.\n\nFeatures of primary health care teams associated with successful quality improvement of diabetes care: a qualitative study.\n\nPubMed\n\nStevenson, K; Baker, R; Farooqi, A; Sorrie, R; Khunti, K\n\n2001-02-01\n\nIn quality improvement activities such as audit, some general practices succeed in improving care and some do not. With audit of care likely to be one of the major tools in clinical governance, it would be helpful to establish what features of primary health care teams are associated with successful audit in general practice. The aim of the present study was to identify those features of primary health care teams that were associated with successful quality improvement during systematic audit of diabetes care. Semi-structured tape-recorded interviews were carried out with lead GPs and practice nurses in 18 general practices in Leicestershire that had the opportunity to improve their care and had completed two data collections in a multipractice audit of diabetes care. The interviewees were asked to describe their practice's approach to audit and the transcripts were coded for common features and judged for strength of feeling by blinded independent raters. Features common to practices that had, and those that had not, managed to improve diabetes care were identified. Six features were identified reliably in the transcripts by blinded independent raters. Four were significantly associated with the successful improvement of care. Success was more likely in teams in which: the GP or nurse felt personally involved in the audit; they perceived their teamwork as good; they had recognized the need for systematic plans to address obstacles to quality improvement; and their teams had a positive attitude to continued monitoring of care. A positive attitude to audit and a personal interest in the disease were not associated with improvement in care. Success in improving diabetes care is associated with certain organizational features of primary health care teams. Experimental studies are required to determine whether the development of teamwork enables practice teams to identify and overcome systematically the obstacles to improved quality of patient care that face them.\n\nFactors driving diabetes care improvement in a large medical group: ten years of progress.\n\nPubMed\n\nSperl-Hillen, JoAnn M; O'Connor, Patrick J\n\n2005-08-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to document trends in diabetes quality of care and coinciding strategies for quality improvement over 10 years in a large medical group. Adults with diagnosed diabetes mellitus were identified each year from 1994 (N = 5610) to 2003 (N = 7650), and internal medical group data quantified improvement trends. Multivariate analysis was used to identify factors that did and did not contribute to improvement trends. Median glycosylated hemoglobin A1C (A1C) levels improved from 8.3% in 1994 to 6.9% in 2003 (P <.001). Mean low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol measurements improved from 132 mg/dL in 1995 to 97 mg/dL in 2003 (P <.001). Both A1C (P <.01) and LDL improvement (P <.0001) were driven by drug intensification, leadership commitment to diabetes improvement, greater continuity of primary care, participation in local and national diabetes care improvement initiatives, and allocation of multidisciplinary resources at the clinic level to improve diabetes care. Resources were spent on nurse and dietitian educators, active outreach to high-risk patients facilitated by registries, physician opinion leader activities including clinic-based training programs, and financial incentives to primary care clinics. Use of endocrinology referrals was stable throughout the period at about 10% of patients per year, and there were no disease management contracts to outside vendors over the study period. Electronic medical records did not favorably affect glycemic control or lipid control in this setting. This primary care-based system achieved A1C and LDL reductions sufficient to reduce macrovascular and microvascular risk by about 50% according to landmark studies; further risk reduction should be attainable through better blood pressure control. Strategies for diabetes improvement need to be customized to address documented gaps in quality of care, provider prescribing behaviors, and patient characteristics.\n\nIs organizational justice associated with clinical performance in the care for patients with diabetes in primary care? Evidence from the improving Quality of care in Diabetes study.\n\nPubMed\n\nElovainio, Marko; Steen, Nick; Presseau, Justin; Francis, Jill; Hrisos, Susan; Hawthorne, Gillian; Johnston, Marie; Stamp, Elaine; Hunter, Margaret; Grimshaw, Jeremy M; Eccles, Martin P\n\n2013-02-01\n\nType 2 diabetes is an increasingly prevalent illness, and there is considerable variation in the quality of care provided to patients with diabetes in primary care. The aim of this study was to explore whether organizational justice and organizational citizenship behaviour are associated with the behaviours of clinical staff when providing care for patients with diabetes. The data were from an ongoing prospective multicenter study, the 'improving Quality of care in Diabetes' (iQuaD) study. Participants (N = 467) were clinical staff in 99 primary care practices in the UK. The outcome measures were six self-reported clinical behaviours: prescribing for glycaemic control, prescribing for blood pressure control, foot examination, giving advice about weight management, providing general education about diabetes and giving advice about self-management. Organizational justice perceptions were collected using a self-administered questionnaire. The associations between organizational justice and behavioural outcomes were tested using linear multilevel regression modelling. Higher scores on the procedural component of organizational justice were associated with more frequent weight management advice, self-management advice and provision of general education for patients with diabetes. The associations between justice and clinical behaviours were not explained by individual or practice characteristics, but evidence was found for the partial mediating role of organizational citizenship behaviour. Quality improvement efforts aimed at increasing advice and education provision in diabetes management in primary care could target also perceptions of procedural justice.\n\nImproving organisational systems for diabetes care in Australian Indigenous communities.\n\nPubMed\n\nBailie, Ross; Si, Damin; Dowden, Michelle; O'Donoghue, Lynette; Connors, Christine; Robinson, Gary; Cunningham, Joan; Weeramanthri, Tarun\n\n2007-05-06\n\nIndigenous Australians experience disproportionately high prevalence of, and morbidity and mortality from diabetes. There is an urgent need to understand how Indigenous primary care systems are organised to deliver diabetes services to those most in need, to monitor the quality of diabetes care received by Indigenous people, and to improve systems for better diabetes care. The intervention featured two annual cycles of assessment, feedback workshops, action planning, and implementation of system changes in 12 Indigenous community health centres. Assessment included a structured review of health service systems and audit of clinical records. Main process of care measures included adherence to guideline-scheduled services and medication adjustment. Main patient outcome measures were HbA1c, blood pressure and total cholesterol levels. There was good engagement of health centre staff, with significant improvements in system development over the study period. Adherence to guideline-scheduled processes improved, including increases in 6 monthly testing of HbA1c from 41% to 74% (Risk ratio 1.93, 95% CI 1.71-2.10), 3 monthly checking of blood pressure from 63% to 76% (1.27, 1.13-1.37), annual testing of total cholesterol from 56% to 74% (1.36, 1.20-1.49), biennial eye checking by a ophthalmologist from 34% to 54% (1.68, 1.39-1.95), and 3 monthly feet checking from 20% to 58% (3.01, 2.52-3.47). Medication adjustment rates following identification of elevated HbA1c and blood pressure were low, increasing from 10% to 24%, and from 13% to 21% respectively at year 1 audit. However, improvements in medication adjustment were not maintained at the year 2 follow-up. Mean HbA1c value improved from 9.3 to 8.9% (mean difference -0.4%, 95% CI -0.7;-0.1), but there was no improvement in blood pressure or cholesterol control. This quality improvement (QI) intervention has proved to be highly acceptable in the Indigenous Australian primary care setting and has been associated with\n\nEfficacy of diabetes nurse expert team program to improve nursing confidence and expertise in caring for hospitalized patients with diabetes mellitus.\n\nPubMed\n\nCorl, Dawn E; McCliment, Sean; Thompson, Rachel E; Suhr, Louise D; Wisse, Brent E\n\n2014-01-01\n\nNursing care for hospitalized patients with diabetes has become more complex as evidence accumulates that inpatient glycemic control improves outcomes. Previous studies have highlighted challenges for educators in providing inpatient diabetes education to nurses. In this article, the authors show that a unit-based diabetes nurse expert team model, developed and led by a diabetes clinical nurse specialist, effectively increased nurses' confidence and expertise in inpatient diabetes care. Adapting this model in other institutions may be a cost-effective way to improve inpatient diabetes care and safety as well as promote professional growth of staff nurses.\n\nCommunication Strategies for Improving Diabetics' Self-Care.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nPryor, Burt; Mengel, Marvin C.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nFocuses on various levels of diabetic patients' involvement in the care of their disease and effects of these levels on how closely they later followed self-care programs.

Understanding true capacity to coordinate care is an important first-step toward establishing effective and efficient care coordination. Yet, we could identify no diabetes-specific instruments to systematically assess readiness and/or status of primary care clinics to engage in diabetes care coordination. This report describes the development and initial validation of the Diabetes Care Coordination Readiness Assessment (DCCRA), which is intended to measure primary care clinic readiness to coordinate care for adult patients with diabetes. The instrument was developed through iterative item generation within a framework of five domains of care coordination: Organizational Capacity, Care Coordination, Clinical Management, Quality Improvement, and Technical Infrastructure. Validation data was collected on 39 primary care clinics. Content validity, inter-rater reliability, internal consistency, and construct validity of the 49-item instrument were assessed. Inter-rater agreement indices per item ranged from 0.50 to 1.0. Cronbach's alpha of the entire instrument was 0.964, and for the five domain scales ranged from 0.688 to 0.961. Clinics with existing care coordinators were rated as more ready to support care coordination than clinics without care coordinators for the entire DCCRA and for each domain, supporting construct validity. As providers increasingly attempt to adopt patient-centered approaches, introduction of the DCCRA is timely and appropriate for assisting clinics with identifying gaps in provision of care coordination services. The DCCRA's strengths include promising psychometric properties. A valid measure of diabetes care coordination readiness should be useful in diabetes program evaluation, assistance with quality improvement initiatives, and measurement of patient-centered care in research.\n\nQuality of Care Improves for Patients with Diabetes in Medicare Shared Savings Accountable Care Organizations: Organizational Characteristics Associated with Performance.\n\nPubMed\n\nFraze, Taressa K; Lewis, Valerie A; Tierney, Emily; Colla, Carrie H\n\n2017-12-06\n\nAccountable care organizations (ACOs), a primary care-centric delivery and payment model, aim to promote integrated population health, which may improve care for those with chronic conditions such as diabetes. Research has shown that, overall, the ACO model is effective at reducing costs, but there is substantial variation in how effective different types of ACOs are at impacting costs and improving care delivery. This study examines how ACO organizational characteristics - such as composition, staffing, care management, and experiences with health reform - were associated with quality of care delivered to patients with diabetes. Secondary data were analyzed retrospectively to examine Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) ACOs' performance on diabetes metrics in the first 2 years of ACO contracts. Ordinary least squares was used to analyze 162 MSSP ACOs with publicly available performance data and the National Survey of ACOs. ACOs improved performance significantly for patients with diabetes between contract years 1 and 2. In year 1, also having a private payer contract and an increased number of services within the ACO were positively associated with performance, while having a community health center or a hospital were negatively associated with performance. Better performance in year 1 was negatively associated with improved performance in year 2. This study found that ACOs substantively improved diabetes management within initial contract years. ACOs may need different types of support throughout their contracts to ensure continued improvements in performance.\n\nPractice context affects efforts to improve diabetes care for primary care patients: a pragmatic cluster randomized trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nDickinson, L Miriam; Dickinson, W Perry; Nutting, Paul A; Fisher, Lawrence; Harbrecht, Marjie; Crabtree, Benjamin F; Glasgow, Russell E; West, David R\n\n2015-04-01\n\nEfforts to improve primary care diabetes management have assessed strategies across heterogeneous groups of patients and practices. However, there is substantial variability in how well practices implement interventions and achieve desired outcomes. To examine practice contextual features that moderate intervention effectiveness. Secondary analysis of data from a cluster randomized trial of three approaches for implementing the Chronic Care Model to improve diabetes care. Forty small to mid-sized primary care practices participated, with 522 clinician and staff member surveys. Outcomes were assessed for 822 established patients with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes who had at least one visit to the practice in the 18 months following enrollment. The primary outcome was a composite measure of diabetes process of care, ascertained by chart audit, regarding nine quality measures from the American Diabetes Association Physician Recognition Program: HgA1c, foot exam, blood pressure, dilated eye exam, cholesterol, nephropathy screen, flu shot, nutrition counseling, and self-management support. Data from practices included structural and demographic characteristics and Practice Culture Assessment survey subscales (Change Culture, Work Culture, Chaos). Across the three implementation approaches, demographic/structural characteristics (rural vs. urban +â.70(p = .006), +2.44(p < .001), -.75(p = .004)); Medicaid: < 20 % vs. â¥ 20 % (-.20(p = .48), +.75 (p = .08), +.60(p = .02)); practice size: < 4 clinicians vs. â¥ 4 clinicians (+.56(p = .02), +1.96(p < .001), +.02(p = .91)); practice Change Culture (high vs. low: -.86(p = .048), +1.71(p = .005), +.34(p = .22)), Work Culture (high vs. low: -.67(p = .18), +2.41(p < .001), +.67(p = .005)) and variability in practice Change Culture (high vs. low: -.24(p = .006), -.20(p = .0771), -.44(p = .0019) and Work Culture (high vs. low: +.56(p = .3160), -1.0(p = .008), -.25 (p = .0216) were associated with trajectories of change in\n\nDefining and improving quality management in Dutch diabetes care groups and outpatient clinics: design of the study\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBackground Worldwide, the organisation of diabetes care is changing. As a result general practices and diabetes teams in hospitals are becoming part of new organisations in which multidisciplinary care programs are implemented. In the Netherlands, 97 diabetes care groups and 104 outpatient clinics are working with a diabetes care program. Both types of organisations aim to improve the quality of diabetes care. Therefore, it is essential to understand the comprehensive elements needed for optimal quality management at organisational level. This study aims to assess the current level of diabetes quality management in both care groups and outpatient clinics and its improvement after providing feedback on their quality management system and tailored support. Methods/design This study is a before-after study with a one-year follow-up comparing the levels of quality management before and after an intervention to improve diabetes quality management. To assess the status of quality management, online questionnaires were developed based on current literature. They consist of six domains: organisation of care, multidisciplinary teamwork, patient centeredness, performance management, quality improvement policy and management strategies. Based on the questionnaires, respondents will receive feedback on their score in a radar diagram and an elucidating table. They will also be granted access to an online toolbox with instruments that proved to be effective in quality of care improvement and with practical examples. If requested, personal support in implementing these tools will be available. After one year quality management will be measured again using the same questionnaire.

Gary; Martin, Carlos\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBackground. Type 2 diabetes is the fourth leading cause of death in Guyana, South America. A complex, interprofessional, quality improvement intervention to improve foot and diabetes care was rolled out in two phases. Methods & Findings. Phase 1: Establishment of an Interprofessional Diabetic Foot Center (DFC) of Excellence to improve foot care and reduce diabetes-related amputations at the national referral hospital. Phase 2: Regionalization to cover 90% of the Guyanese population and expansion to include improved management of diabetes and hypertension. Fourteen key opinion leaders were educated and 340 health care professionals from 97 facilities trained. Eight centers for the evaluation and treatment of foot ulcers were established and 7567 people with diabetes evaluated. 3452 participants had foot screening and 48% were deemed high risk; 10% of these had undocumented foot ulcers. There was a 68% reduction in rate of major amputations (P < 0.0001); below knee amputations were decreased by 80%, while above knee amputations were unchanged. An increased association of diabetes with women (F/M = 2.09) and increased risk of major amputation in men [odds ratio 2.16 (95% CI 1.83, 2.56)] were documented. Conclusions. This intervention improved foot care with reduction in major amputations sustained over 5 years.

The act was designed to improve insurance coverage, health care access, and quality of care for all Americans, which will assist patients with diabetes mellitus in acquiring routine monitoring and diabetes-related complication screening for better health management and outcomes. There is great potential for patients with diabetes to benefit from the new policy mandating health insurance coverage and plan improvement, Medicaid expansion, minimum coverage guarantees, and free preventative care. However, policy variability among states and ACA implementation present challenges to people with diabetes in understanding and optimizing ACA impact. This paper aims to select the most influential components of the ACA as relates to people with diabetes and discuss how the ACA may improve health care for this vulnerable population.\n\nIntegrating chronic care with primary care activities: enriching healthcare staff knowledge and skills and improving glycemic control of a cohort of people with diabetes through the First Line Diabetes Care Project in the Philippines\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKu, Grace Marie V.; Kegels, Guy\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground This study investigated the effects of integrating primary chronic care with current healthcare activities in two local government health units (LGHU) of the Philippines on knowledge and skills of the LGHU staff and clinical outcomes for people with diabetes. Design Integration was accomplished through health service reorganization, (re)distribution of chronic care tasks, and training of LGHU staff. Levels of the staff's pre- and post-training diabetes knowledge and of their self-assessment of diabetes care-related skills were measured. Primary diabetes care with emphasis on self-care development was provided to a cohort of people with diabetes. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and obesity measures were collected prior to and one year after full project implementation. Results The training workshop improved diabetes knowledge (p<0.001) and self-assessed skills (p<0.001) of the LGHU staff. Significant reductions in HbA1c (p<0.001), waistâhip ratio (p<0.001) and waist circumference (p=0.011) of the cohort were noted. Although the reduction in HbA1c was somewhat greater among those whose community-based care providers showed improvement in knowledge and self-assessed skills, the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusions Primary care for chronic conditions such as diabetes may be integrated with other healthcare activities in health services of low-to-middle-income countries such as the Philippines, utilizing pre-existing human resources for health, and may improve clinical endpoints.

However, women with type 2 diabetes are less aware of and less likely to access pre-pregnancy care (PPC) compared with women with type 1 diabetes. We developed and evaluated a community-based PPC programme with the aim of improving pregnancy preparation in all women with pregestational diabetes. This was a prospective cohort study comparing pregnancy preparation measures before and during/after the PPC intervention in women with pre-existing diabetes from 1 June 2013 to 28 February 2017. The setting was 422 primary care practices and ten National Health Service specialist antenatal diabetes clinics. A multifaceted approach was taken to engage women with diabetes and community healthcare teams. This included identifying and sending PPC information leaflets to all eligible women, electronic preconception care templates, online education modules and resources, and regional meetings and educational events. Key outcomes were preconception folic acid supplementation, maternal HbA 1c level, use of potentially harmful medications at conception and gestational age at first presentation, before and during/after the PPC programme. A total of 306 (73%) primary care practices actively participated in the PPC programme. Primary care databases were used to identify 5075 women with diabetes aged 18-45Â years. PPC leaflets were provided to 4558 (89.8%) eligible women. There were 842 consecutive pregnancies in women with diabetes: 502 before and 340 during/after the PPC intervention. During/after the PPC intervention, pregnant women with type 2 diabetes were more likely to achieve target HbA 1c levels â¤48Â mmol/mol (6.5%) (44.4% of women before vs 58.5% of women during/after PPC intervention; pâ=â0.016) and to take 5Â mg folic acid daily (23.5% and 41.8%; pâ=â0.001).

Two independent cohorts were recruited with the same inclusion criteria in 2004 (cohort 1: 3319 with type 2 and 286 with type 1 diabetes) and in 2014 (cohort 2: 3932 with type 2 and 308 with type 1 diabetes). Prevalence of complications and care indicators including achieving treatment targets for glycemia, blood pressure, lipid control, body mass index (BMI), and smoking were compared. In addition, patients in cohort 1 were re-examined in 2014 and their data were compared with the baseline data of each cohort. In type 2 diabetes, the prevalence of nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy, chronic kidney disease, current smoking and stroke significantly decreased, with improvements in achieving treatment target rates in cohort 2 two as compared with cohort 1. In type 1 diabetes, the prevalence of nephropathy, retinopathy, chronic kidney disease, and hemoglobin A 1C values significantly decreased. Decreases in prevalence of microvascular complications in type 2 diabetes were similarly found in each age-matched and sex-matched group, whereas younger patients exhibited marked increase in BMI and lower treatment target achieving rates compared with elderly patients. Regarding normoalbuminuric renal impairment, only a slight increase in the prevalence was observed both in type 2 and type 1 diabetes. In cohort 1, re-examined in 2014, care indicators were significantly improved from 2004, while complications increased with getting 10 years older. We observed declining trends of diabetic microvascular complications with improvement in diabetes care indicators in type 2 and type 1 diabetes. Younger patients with type 2 diabetes exhibited marked increase in BMI and lower rates of achieving treatment targets compared with elderly patients, which remains a concern.\n\nQuality improvement strategies at primary care level to reduce inequalities in diabetes care: an equity-oriented systematic review.\n\nPubMed\n\nTerens, Natalie; Vecchi, Simona; Bargagli, Anna Maria; Agabiti, Nera; Mitrova, Zuzana; Amato, Laura; Davoli, Marina\n\n2018-05-29\n\nThere is evidence that disparities exist in diabetes prevalence, access to diabetes care, diabetes-related complications, and the quality of diabetes care. A wide range of interventions has been implemented and evaluated to improve diabetes care. We aimed to review trials of quality improvement (QI) interventions aimed to reduce health inequities among people with diabetes in primary care and to explore the extent to which experimental studies addressed and reported equity issues. Pubmed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library were searched to identify randomized controlled studies published between January 2005 and May 2016. We adopted the PROGRESS Plus framework, as a tool to explore differential effects of QI interventions across sociodemographic and economic factors. From 1903 references fifty-eight randomized trials met the inclusion criteria (with 17.786 participants), mostly carried out in USA. The methodological quality was good for all studies. Almost all studies reported the age, gender/sex and race distribution of study participants. The majority of trials additionally used at least one further PROGRESS-Plus factor at baseline, with education being the most commonly used, followed by income (55%). Large variation was observed between these studies for type of interventions, target populations, and outcomes evaluated. Few studies examined differential intervention effects by PROGRESS-plus factors. Existing evidence suggests that some QI intervention delivered in primary care can improve diabetes-related health outcomes in social disadvantaged population subgroups such as ethnic minorities. However, we found very few studies comparing health outcomes between population subgroups and reporting differential effect estimates of QI interventions. This review provides evidence that QI interventions for people with diabetes is feasible to implement and highly acceptable. However, more research is needed to understand their effective components as well as the\n\nImproving quality of care using a diabetes registry and disease management services in an integrated delivery network.\n\nPubMed\n\nCampion, Francis X; Tully, George L; Barrett, Jo-Ann; Andre, Paulo; Sweeney, Ann\n\n2005-08-01\n\nDisease management for chronic conditions is a call for collaboration among all parties of the health care system.

Both primary and secondary prevention need to improve in order to face this challenge. Improving management of diabetes in primary care is therefore of fundamental importance. The objective of these series of audits was to find means of improving diabetes management in chronic disease mini-clinics in primary health care. In the process, we were able to study the effect and practical usefulness of different audit designs - those measuring clinical outcomes, process of care, or both. King Saud City Family and Community Medicine Centre, Saudi National Guard Health Affairs in Riyadh city, Saudi Arabia. Simple random samples of 30 files were selected every two weeks from a sampling frame of file numbers for all diabetes clients seen over the period. Information was transferred to a form, entered on the computer and an automated response was generated regarding the appropriateness of management, a criterion mutually agreed upon by care providers. The results were plotted on statistical process control charts, p charts, displayed for all employees. Data extraction, archiving, entry, analysis, plotting and design and preparation of p charts were managed by nursing staff specially trained for the purpose by physicians with relevant previous experience. Audit series with mixed outcome and process measures failed to detect any changes in the proportion of non-conforming cases over a period of one year. The process measures series, on the other hand, showed improvement in care corresponding to a reduction in the proportion non-conforming by 10% within a period of 3 months. Non-conformities dropped from a mean of 5.0 to 1.4 over the year (P < 0.001). It is possible to improve providers' behaviour regarding implementation of given guidelines through periodic process audits and feedbacks. Frequent process audits in the context of statistical process control should be supplemented with concurrent outcome audits, once or\n\nA review of randomized controlled trials of medical record powered clinical decision support system to improve quality of diabetes care.\n\nPubMed\n\nAli, Syed Mustafa; Giordano, Richard; Lakhani, Saima; Walker, Dawn Marie\n\n2016-03-01\n\nA gap between current diabetes care practice and recommended diabetes care standards has consistently been reported in the literature. Many IT-based interventions have been developed to improve adherence to the quality of care standards for chronic illness like diabetes. The widespread implementation of electronic medical/health records has catalyzed clinical decision support systems (CDSS) which may improve the quality of diabetes care. Therefore, the objective of the review is to evaluate the effectiveness of CDSS in improving quality of type II diabetes care. Moreover, the review aims to highlight the key indicators of quality improvement to assist policy makers in development of future diabetes care policies through the integration of information technology and system. Setting inclusion criteria, a systematic literature search was conducted using Medline, Web of Science and Science Direct. Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) tools were used to evaluate the quality of studies. Eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were selected for the review. In the selected studies, seventeen clinical markers of diabetes care were discussed. Three quality of care indicators were given more importance in monitoring the progress of diabetes care, which is consistent with National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines. The presence of these indicators in the studies helped to determine which studies were selected for review. Clinical- and process-related improvements are compared between intervention group using CDSS and control group with usual care. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), low density lipid cholesterol (LDL-C) and blood pressure (BP) were the quality of care indicators studied at the levels of process of care and clinical outcome. The review has found both inconsistent and variable results for quality of diabetes care measures. A significant improvement has been found in the process of care for all three measures of quality of diabetes care\n\nImpact of office systems and improvement strategies on costs of care for adults with diabetes.\n\nPubMed\n\nGilmer, Todd P; O'Connor, Patrick J; Rush, William A; Crain, A Lauren; Whitebird, Robin R; Hanson, Anne M; Solberg, Leif I\n\n2006-06-01\n\nTo assess the impact of organizational features and improvement strategies of primary care clinics on health care costs of adults with diabetes. This study included a prospective cohort study of 1,628 adults with diabetes in a large, health care organization receiving care in 84 clinics within 18 medical groups. Data from surveys of patients, clinic medical directors and managers, and medical record reviews were merged with 3 years of medical claims. Costs were estimated using health plan data on resource use and common Medicare payment methodologies. Generalized linear regression models were used to analyze costs related to clinic characteristics, adjusting for individual patient comorbidity, demographic, and socioeconomic factors. Clinics with regular clinician meetings to discuss patient care problems and clinics that used diabetes registries to prioritize patients based on cardiovascular risk were associated with lower 3-year costs: -$3,962 (P = 0.002) and -$2,916 (P = 0.019), respectively. The use of databases to monitor lab results was associated with higher costs ($2,439, P = 0.038). Quality improvement strategies focused on resource use related to diabetes care (-$2,883, P = 0.017) or heart disease care (-$3,228, P = 0.014) were associated with lowered costs, whereas quality improvement strategies that emphasized pharmacy use for patients with heart disease ($3,059, P = 0.029) or depression ($2,962, P = 0.038) were associated with increased costs. Several organizational features of primary care offices were significant predictors of future health care costs for adults with diabetes. The mechanism by which such factors affect costs of care and the relationship of costs to clinical outcomes merits further evaluation.\n\nClinical coaching in primary care: Capable of improving control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus?\n\nPubMed\n\nGonzÃ¡lez-Guajardo, Eduardo Enrique; Salinas-MartÃ­nez, Ana MarÃ­a; Botello-GarcÃ­a, Antonio; Mathiew-Quiros, Ãlvaro\n\n2016-06-01\n\nFew clinical coaching studies are both endorsed by real cases and focused on reducing suboptimal diabetes control. We evaluated the effectiveness of coaching on improving type 2 diabetes goals after 3 years of implementation in primary care. A cross-sectional study with follow up was conducted during 2008-2011. Coaching consisted of guiding family doctors to improve their clinical abilities, and it was conducted by a medical doctor trained in skill building, experiential learning, and goal setting. Effectiveness was assessed by means of fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin outcomes. The main analysis consisted of 1Ã3 and 2Ã3 repeated measures ANOVAs. A significant coachingÃtime interaction was observed, indicating that the difference in glucose between primary care units with and without coaching increased over time (Wilks' lambda multivariate test, P<0.0001). Coaching increased 1.4 times (95%CI 1.3, 1.5) the possibility of reaching the fasting glucose goal after controlling for baseline values. There was also a significant improvement in glycosylated hemoglobin (Bonferroni-corrected p-value for pairwise comparisons, P<0.0001). A correctible and even preventable contributing component in diabetes care corresponds to physicians' performance. After 3 years of implementation, coaching was found to be worth the effort to improve type 2 diabetes control in primary care. Copyright Â© 2015 Primary Care Diabetes Europe.

Research indicates that adults with intellectual disabilities (ID) are two to three times more likely to develop diabetes; however, there has been limited focus on diabetes service utilisation in this population. The aim of this study is to explore the perceptions and experiences of diabetes and ID practitioners. A series of 1:1 semi-structured interviews were undertaken in one Scottish health service area. In total, 29 qualitative interviews were conducted: 10 with diabetes practitioners from primary and secondary care, 14 from ID services and 5 from community care services regarding diabetes service provision for this population. Thematic content analysis was undertaken to identify the themes and subthemes. Three main themes were identified: (1) enabling access to services to meet diabetes-related care needs of people with ID; (2) communication and service improvements between staff, patients and across services; and (3) providing person-centred diabetes care and developing adapted resources to increase patient self-care. The findings of this study have important international implications in how diabetes practitioners plan and deliver services for people with ID and other vulnerable groups with limited cognitive ability and communication skills and difficulties in self-management. The findings highlight that access to diabetes education and adapted resources is needed, and if 'reasonable adjustments' are made to service provision and practice, people with ID can benefit from improved healthcare. Developing joint clinics to share knowledge and resources between diabetes and ID practitioners may improve service delivery and continuity of care, and thereby diminish the costs of not providing quality care.

Despite advances in clinical management many type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients have suboptimal glycaemic control. Using quantitative questionnaires, general practitioners prospectively evaluated their management of 761 T2D patients at two time points, 6 months apart. Following the first audit, GPs received feedback and a decision support tool. Patients were then re-audited to assess if the intervention altered management. The use of annual cycle of care plans significantly increased by 12% during the audit. General practitioner performance improved across all measures with the greatest gains being in the use of care plans and measuring and meeting targets for microalbumin. Glycaemic control was well managed in this cohort (mean HbA1c 6.9% for both audit cycles). The Type2Care clinical audit provided decision support tools and diabetes registers that improved the delivery of care to patients with T2D.\n\nA Smartphone Application Significantly Improved Diabetes Self-Care Activities with High User Satisfaction\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKim, Yu Jin; Byun, Jong Kyu; Park, So Young; Hong, Soo Min; Chin, Sang Ouk; Chon, Suk; Oh, Seungjoon; Woo, Jeong-taek; Kim, Sung Woon; Kim, Young Seol\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBackground We developed for the first time a smartphone application designed for diabetes self-management in Korea and registered a patent for the relevant algorithm. We also investigated the user satisfaction with the application and the change in diabetes related self-care activities after using the application. Methods We conducted a questionnaire survey on volunteers with diabetes who were using the application. Ninety subjects responded to the questionnaire between June 2012 and March 2013. A modified version of the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities (SDSCA) was used in this study. Results The survey results exhibited a mean subject age of 44.0 years old, and males accounted for 78.9% of the subjects. Fifty percent of the subjects had diabetes for less than 3 years. The majority of respondents experienced positive changes in their clinical course after using the application (83.1%) and were satisfied with the structure and completeness of the application (86.7%). Additionally, the respondents' answers indicated that the application was easy to use (96.7%) and recommendable to others (97.7%) and that they would continue using the application to manage their diabetes (96.7%). After using the Diabetes Notepad application, diabetes related self-care activities assessed by SDSCA displayed statistically significant improvements (P<0.05), except for the number of days of drinking. Conclusion This smartphone-based application can be a useful tool leading to positive changes in diabetes related self-care activities and increase user satisfaction.

The aim of this study was to review the prevalence, causes, prevention, management, health policies, and challenges for successful management of diabetes and its complications in Venezuela. A comprehensive literature review spanning 1960 to 2015 was performed. Literature not indexed also was reviewed. The weighted prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes was estimated from published regional and subnational population-based studies. Diabetes care strategies were analyzed. In Venezuela, the weighted prevalence of diabetes was 7.7% and prediabetes was 11.2%. Diabetes was the fifth leading cause of death (7.1%) in 2012 with the mortality rate increasing 7% per year from 1990 to 2012. In 2012, cardiovascular disease and diabetes together were the leading cause of disability-adjusted life years.T2D drivers are genetic, epigenetic, and lifestyle, including unhealthy dietary patterns and physical inactivity. Obesity, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome are present at lower cutoffs for body mass index, homeostatic model assessment, and visceral or ectopic fat, respectively. Institutional programs for early detection and/or prevention of T2D have not been established. Most patients with diabetes (â¼87%) are cared for in public facilities in a fragmented health system. Local clinical practice guidelines are available, but implementation is suboptimal and supporting information is limited. Strategies to improve diabetes care in Venezuela include enhancing resources, reducing costs, improving education, implementing screening (using Latin America Finnish Diabetes Risk Score), promoting diabetes care units, avoiding insulin levels as diagnostic tool, correct use of oral glucose tolerance testing and metformin as first-line T2D treatment, and reducing health system fragmentation.

A case-study from the United Kingdom\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAims As quality in diabetes care includes patient centred support for self-management, investigating patientsâ experiences upon diagnosis can help improve access to this element of care among diverse populations. This research explored this care in the context of recent national quality improvement initiatives which support self-management. Methods South Asian and White European patients over 16 years with a recent (<â1 year) diagnosis of diabetes were recruited from 18 General Practitioner (GP) practices in three UK locations - Luton, West London and Leicester. A semi-structured qualitative interview was conducted with 47 patients. Results Twenty one out of 47 (45%) reported unmet support and information needs at diagnosis. Although there was a small proportion of participants (8 out of 47, 17% of all respondents) who felt they did not require any help or support with managing their diabetes because their GP had provided comprehensive and efficient care, there was an equal number who voiced a negative view of the care they had received to date. This concerned information giving, support and communication, suggesting that recently implemented national quality improvement interventions may not have been successful in improving all aspects of diabetes care, particularly those encouraging self-management. The emerging analysis led to consideration of concordance as an important concept through which to understand inequalities and improve access to quality diabetes care. In order to encourage self-management from the start, care providers need to be cognisant that patients are not homogeneous and be responsive to their different information needs and emotional responses to diagnosis. Conclusions In order to support self-management and deliver patient centred care in diverse populations, care providers will need to be adaptable to individual needs around diagnosis.

The primary goal of this program was to improve glucose control, as measured by hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Clinic-based pharmacists offered support to patients with diabetes through direct teaching about diabetes, frequent phone follow-up, medication algorithms, and use of a database that tracked patient outcomes and actively identified opportunities to improve care. From September 1999, to May 2000, 159 subjects were enrolled, and complete follow-up data were available for 138 (87%) patients. Baseline HbA1c averaged 10.8%, and after an average of 6 months of intervention, the mean reduction in HbA1c was 1.9 percentage points (95% confidence interval, 1.5-2.3). In predictive regression modeling, baseline HbA1c and new onset diabetes were associated with significant improvements in HbA1c. Age, race, gender, educational level, and provider status were not significant predictors of improvement. In conclusion, a pharmacist-based diabetes care program integrated into primary care practice significantly reduced HbA1c among patients with diabetes and poor glucose control.\n\nElectronic Patient Registries Improve Diabetes Care and Clinical Outcomes in Rural Community Health Centers\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nPollard, Cecil; Bailey, Kelly A.; Petitte, Trisha; Baus, Adam; Swim, Mary; Hendryx, Michael\n\n2009-01-01\n\nContext: Diabetes care is challenging in rural areas.

We examined responses to public reporting on the quality of diabetes care in 409 primary care clinics within seventeen large, multispecialty physician groups. We determined that a focus on publicly reported metrics, along with participation in large or externally sponsored projects, increased a clinicâs implementation of diabetes improvement interventions. Clinics were also more likely to implement interventions in more recent years. Public reporting helped drive both early implementation of a single intervention and ongoing implementation of multiple simultaneous interventions. To fully engage physician groups, accountability metrics should be structured to capture incremental improvements in quality, thereby rewarding both early and ongoing improvement activities.

Glycemic control, blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level, annual cholesterol level monitoring, and annual foot and dilated eye examination, as defined by the National Diabetes Quality Improvement Alliance measures. In the past decade, the proportion of persons with diabetes with poor glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c > 9%) showed a nonstatistically significant decrease of 3.9% (95% CI, -10.4% to 2.5%), while the proportion of persons with fair or good lipid control (LDL cholesterol level < 3.4 mmol/L [<130 mg/dL]) had a statistically significant increase of 21.9% (CI, 12.4% to 31.3%). Mean LDL cholesterol level decreased by 0.5 mmol/L (18.8 mg/dL). Although mean hemoglobin A1c did not change, the proportion of persons with hemoglobin A(1c) of 6% to 8% increased from 34.2% to 47.0%. The blood pressure distribution did not change. Annual lipid testing, dilated eye examination, and foot examination increased by 8.3% (CI, 4.0% to 12.7%), 4.5% (CI, 0.5% to 8.5%), and 3.8% (CI, -0.1% to 7.7%), respectively.

Rural communities additionally have increased disparities related to access barriers and a large minority population with poorer overall health. Research evidence supports telemedicine as an effective alternative to bring preventive diabetes care to remote areas. This article presents an overview of the leadership role of advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) with the implementation and evaluation of a pediatric diabetes telemedicine program at a rural pediatric outpatient specialty clinic in partnership with a tertiary center telemedicine network. The telemedicine program quality improvement (QI) project explored caregiver satisfaction with a convenience sample of caregivers (N = 14) using a nine-item Telemedicine Diabetes Caregiver Satisfaction Survey (TDCSS), with responses ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree. Findings indicate caregivers were highly satisfied with communication/ privacy (M = 4.8), access to care (M = 4.1), and quality of services (M = 5.0). The multidisciplinary collaborative teamwork, continuous QI, and dependable technology were integral to the quality of the telemedicine clinical initiative. APRNs provided technology expertise, interdisciplinary collaboration leadership, care coordination, and advocacy for policy changes. Results demonstrate that telemedicine and APRN leadership can help implement innovative programs into rural communities to improve access to care, healthcare cost, and outcomes.\n\nImproving diabetes care at primary care level with a multistrategic approach: results of the DIAPREM programme.\n\nPubMed\n\nPrestes, Mariana; Gayarre, Maria A; Elgart, Jorge F; Gonzalez, Lorena; Rucci, Enzo; Paganini, Jose M; Gagliardino, Juan J\n\n2017-09-01\n\nTo present results, 1Â year postimplementation at primary care level, of an integrated diabetes care programme including systemic changes, education, registry (clinical, metabolic, and therapeutic indicators), and disease management (DIAPREM). We randomly selected and trained 15 physicians and 15 nurses from primary care units of La Matanza County (intervention-IG) and another 15 physicians/nurses to participate as controls (control-CG). Each physician-nurse team controlled and followed up 10 patients with type 2 diabetes for 1Â year; both groups used structured medical records. Patients in IG had quarterly clinical appointments, whereas those in CG received traditional care. Statistical data analysis included parametric/nonparametric tests according to data distribution profile and Chi-squared test for proportions. After 12Â months, the dropout rate was significantly lower in IG than in CG. Whereas in IG HbA1c, blood pressure and lipid profile levels significantly decreased, no changes were recorded in CG. Drug prescriptions showed no significant changes in IG except a decrease in oral monotherapy. DIAPREM is an expedient and simple multistrategic model to implement at the primary care level in order to decrease patient dropout and improve control and treatment adherence, and quality of care of people with diabetes.\n\nImproving the Care of Youth With Type 1 Diabetes With a Novel Medical-Legal Community Intervention: The Diabetes Community Care Ambassador Program.\n\nPubMed\n\nMalik, Faisal S; Yi-Frazier, Joyce P; Taplin, Craig E; Roth, Christian L; Whitlock, Kathryn B; Howard, Waylon; Pihoker, Catherine\n\n2018-04-01\n\nPurpose The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility and efficacy of the Diabetes Community Care Ambassador (DCCA) Program, a novel medical-legal community intervention designed to support high-risk youth with type 1 diabetes. Methods Study eligibility criteria: ages 3-19 years, A1C â¥8.5% (â¥69 mmol/mol) and/or recent diabetic ketoacidosis hospitalization, type 1 diabetes duration â¥1 year, and English- or Spanish-speaking. Eighty-nine youth and their caregivers participated in the 9- to 12-month intervention, which included diabetes education and support through 3 home visits, 1 to 2 school visits, and phone support from a lay health worker, as well as legal support from a medical-legal partnership attorney. Feasibility was assessed; change in A1C was compared in a linear mixed model. Results Of the 89 DCCA Program participants, 80% completed the program, with the majority of participants rating their DCCA favorably. Sixty-two percent reported â¥1 unmet legal need, of whom 29% accepted legal counsel. Youth enrolled in the DCCA Program demonstrated an improvement in glycemic control as their mean A1C decreased from 9.71% (83 mmol/mol) at the start of the program to 9.40% (79 mmol/mol) at the end of the intervention period ( P = .03). Participants with public health insurance experienced the greatest differential A1C reduction (9.79% to 9.11%, 83 mmol/mol to 76 mmol/mol). Conclusions The DCCA Program represents a promising intervention for improving care of high-risk youth with type 1 diabetes. A significant proportion of caregivers of youth reported having an unmet legal need. Participants remained highly engaged and demonstrated improved glycemic control, particularly youth with public health insurance.\n\nCan Secure Patient-Provider Messaging Improve Diabetes Care?\n\nPubMed\n\nChung, Sukyung; Panattoni, Laura; Chi, Jeffrey; Palaniappan, Latha\n\n2017-10-01\n\nInternet-based secure messaging between patients and providers through a patient portal is now common in the practice of modern medicine. There is limited evidence on how messaging is associated with use and clinical quality measures among patients with type 2 diabetes. We examine whether messaging with physicians for medical advice is associated with fewer face-to-face visits and better diabetes management. Patients with diabetes who were enrolled in an online portal of an outpatient health care organization in 2011-2014 were studied ( N = 37,762 patient-years). Messages from/to primary care physicians or diabetes-related specialists for medical advice were considered. We estimated the association of messaging with diabetes quality measures, adjusting for patient and provider characteristics and patient-level clustering. Most patients (72%) used messaging, and those who made frequent visits were also more likely to message. Given visit frequency, no (vs. any) messaging was negatively associated with the likelihood of meeting an HbA 1c target of <8% (64 mmol/mol) (odds ratio [OR] 0.83 [95% CI 0.77, 0.90]). Among message users, additional messages (vs. 1) were associated with better outcome (two more messages: OR 1.17 [95% CI 1.06, 1.28]; three more messages: 1.38 [1.25, 1.53]; four more messages: 1.55 [1.43, 1.69]). The relationship was stronger for noninsulin users. Message frequency was also positively associated, but to a smaller extent, with process measures (e.g., eye examination). Physician-initiated messages had effects similar to those for patient-initiated messages. Patients with diabetes frequently used secure messaging for medical advice in addition to routine visits to care providers. Messaging was positively associated with better diabetes management in a large community outpatient practice.

This review describes the evolution of the diabetes epidemic in Indigenous populations and associated risk factors, highlighting gestational diabetes and intergenerational risk, lifestyle risk factors and social determinants as having particular importance and impact on Indigenous peoples. This review further describes the impact of chronic disease and diabetes on Indigenous peoples and communities, specifically diabetes-related comorbidities and complications. This review provides continued evidence that dramatic changes are necessary to reduce diabetes-related inequities in Indigenous populations, with a call to action to support programmatic primary healthcare transformation capable of empowering Indigenous peoples and communities and improving chronic disease prevention and management. Promising strategies for transforming health services and care for Indigenous peoples include quality improvement initiatives, facilitating diabetes and chronic disease registry and surveillance systems to identify care gaps, and prioritizing evaluation to build the evidence-base necessary to guide future health policy and planning locally and on a global scale.

The impact of diabetes necessitates assessing the quality of care received by people with diabetes, especially in countries with a significant diabetes burden such as Kuwait. This paper aimed at piloting an approach for measuring Type II diabetes care performance through the use of a diabetes quality indicator set (DQIS) in primary health care. The DQIS for Kuwait was adapted from that developed by the National Diabetes Quality Improvement Alliance and the International Diabetes Federation. Five key care domains/measures were employed: (1) Blood glucose level measurement, (2) Cholesterol level measurement, (3) Blood pressure measurement, (4) Kidney function testing and (5) Smoking status check. The sample included the four major primary health care centers with the highest case load in Kuwait City, 4,241 patients in 2012 and 3,211 in 2010. Findings revealed the applicability and utility of employing performance indicators for diabetes care in Kuwait. Furthermore, findings revealed that many of the primary health care centers have achieved noteworthy improvement in diabetes care between 2010 and 2012, with the exception of smoking status check. The DQIS can help policymakers identify performance gaps and investigate key system roadblocks related to diabetes care in Kuwait.\n\nThe utah beacon experience: integrating quality improvement, health information technology, and practice facilitation to improve diabetes outcomes in small health care facilities.\n\nPubMed\n\nTennison, Janet; Rajeev, Deepthi; Woolsey, Sarah; Black, Jeff; Oostema, Steven J; North, Christie\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe Utah Improving Care through Connectivity and Collaboration (IC3) Beacon community (2010-2013) was spearheaded by HealthInsight, a nonprofit, community-based organization. One of the main objectives of IC(3) was to improve health care provided to patients with diabetes in three Utah counties, collaborating with 21 independent smaller clinics and two large health care enterprises. This paper will focus on the use of health information technology (HIT) and practice facilitation to develop and implement new care processes to improve clinic workflow and ultimately improve patients' diabetes outcomes at 21 participating smaller, independent clinics. Early in the project, we learned that most of the 21 clinics did not have the resources needed to successfully implement quality improvement (QI) initiatives. IC(3) helped clinics effectively use data generated from their electronic health records (EHRs) to design and implement interventions to improve patients' diabetes outcomes. This close coupling of HIT, expert practice facilitation, and Learning Collaboratives was found to be especially valuable in clinics with limited resources. Through this process we learned that (1) an extensive readiness assessment improved clinic retention, (2) clinic champions were important for a successful collaboration, and (3) current EHR systems have limited functionality to assist in QI initiatives. In general, smaller, independent clinics lack knowledge and experience with QI and have limited HIT experience to improve patient care using electronic clinical data. Additionally, future projects like IC(3) Beacon will be instrumental in changing clinic culture so that QI is integrated into routine workflow. Our efforts led to significant changes in how practice staff optimized their EHRs to manage and improve diabetes care, while establishing the framework for sustainability. Some of the IC(3) Beacon practices are currently smoothly transitioning to new models of care such as Patient\n\nThe Ohio Gestational Diabetes Postpartum Care Learning Collaborative: Development of a Quality Improvement Initiative to Improve Systems of Care for Women.\n\nPubMed\n\nShellhaas, Cynthia; Conrey, Elizabeth; Crane, Dushka; Lorenz, Allison; Wapner, Andrew; Oza-Frank, Reena; Bouchard, Jo\n\n2016-11-01\n\nObjectives To improve clinical practice and increase postpartum visit Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) screening rates in women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Methods We recruited clinical sites with at least half of pregnant patients enrolled in Medicaid to participate in an 18-month quality improvement (QI) project. To support clinical practice changes, we developed provider and patient toolkits with educational and clinical practice resources. Clinical subject-matter experts facilitated a learning network to train sites and promote discussion and learning among sites. Sites submitted data from patient chart reviews monthly for key measures that we used to provide rapid-cycle feedback. Providers were surveyed at completion regarding toolkit usefulness and satisfaction. Results Of fifteen practices recruited, twelve remained actively engaged. We disseminated more than 70 provider and 2345 patient toolkits. Documented delivery of patient education improved for timely GDM prenatal screening, reduction of future T2DM risk, smoking cessation, and family planning. Sites reported toolkits were useful and easy to use. Of women for whom postpartum data were available, 67â% had a documented postpartum visit and 33â% had a postpartum T2DM screen. Lack of information sharing between prenatal and postpartum care providers was are barriers to provision and documentation of care. Conclusions for Practice QI and toolkit resources may improve the quality of prenatal education. However, postpartum care did not reach optimal levels. Future work should focus on strategies to support coordination of care between obstetrical and primary care providers.\n\n[Interventions to improve the management of diabetes mellitus in primary health care and outpatient community settings].\n\nPubMed\n\nHansen, Lars JÃ¸rgen; Drivsholm, Thomas B\n\n2002-01-28\n\nThis review should be cited as: Renders CM, Valk GD, Griffin S. Wagner EH, Eijk JThM van, Assendelft WJJ. Interventions to improve the management of diabetes mellitus in primary care, outpatient and community settings (Cochrane Review). In: The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2001. Oxford: Update Software. A substantive amendment to this systematic review was last made on 29 June 2000. Cochrane reviews are regularly checked and updated if necessary. Diabetes is a common chronic disease that is increasingly managed in primary care. Different systems have been proposed to manage diabetes care. To assess the effects of different interventions, targeted at health professionals or the structure in which they deliver care, on the management of patients with diabetes in primary care, outpatient and community settings. We searched the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group specialised register, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 4 1999), MEDLINE (1966-1999), EMBASE (1980-1999), Cinahl (1982-1999), and reference lists of articles. Randomised trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), controlled before and after studies (CBAs) and interrupted time series (ITS) analyses of professional, financial and organisational strategies aimed at improving care for people with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. The participants were health care professionals, including physicians, nurses and pharmacists. The outcomes included objectively measured health professional performance or patient outcomes, and self-report measures with known validity and reliability. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality. Forty-one studies were included involving more than 200 practices and 48,000 patients. Twenty-seven studies were RCTs, 12 were CBAs, and two were ITS. The studies were heterogeneous in terms of interventions, participants, settings and outcomes. The methodological quality of the studies was often poor.

This paper describes the expansion of the Chronic Care Model (CCM) to include a community focus for improving diabetes self-management and reducing health disparities. The literature review assesses the concept of \"community\" in improving outcomes as viewed by proponents of the CCM for chronic disease. The CCM was then modified and informed by experiences of a major community-based participatory action initiative to improve diabetes outcomes, the Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH) Charleston and Georgetown Diabetes Coalition. Based on our experiences with community-based and health systems diabetes interventions, we present examples of improvements within both health delivery practice sites and other community systems that are essential for improving diabetes outcomes and reducing disparities. Building on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) principles of community involvement, our coalition activities provide examples of working with community partners to frame this enhanced ecologically grounded Community CCM (CCCM). The resulting CCCM integrates expanded conceptual frameworks, evidence-based practice, community-based evidence and participatory actions, and highlights the possibilities and challenges for improving chronic disease outcomes and reducing disparities via community programs that foster individual, systems, community, and policy change.\n\nEvaluation of a community diabetes initiative: Integrating diabetes care.\n\nPubMed\n\nWalsh, Jason Leo; Harris, Benjamin Howell Lole; Roberts, Aled Wyn\n\n2015-06-01\n\nTo evaluate the impact of a community diabetes initiative, aiming to improve the efficiency of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) care within the Cardiff and Vale Health Board. In 2012, a community diabetes initiative was introduced in Cardiff and Vale. Ten National Health Service (NHS) consultant diabetologists and three nurse specialists supported 69 general practices in this region. Here we evaluate the impact of this initiative by assessing the number and quality of secondary care diabetes clinic referrals before (2011-2012) and after implementation (2013-2014). Referrals pre and post initiative were audited against Cardiff and Vale T2DM referral guidelines in two 6-month periods. In the 6-months prior to the initiative, 108 referrals were received, 78 of which were in line with local guidance. Approximately one year after embarking on the diabetes initiative (2013-2014) there was a 31% reduction (p<0.01) in the total number of T2DM clinic referrals and a 57% reduction (p<0.01) in referrals outside the guidelines. A decrease in referrals was not seen in the practice noted not to engage with the initiative. The community diabetes initiative intervention has significantly improved the appropriateness of T2DM referrals from GP practices engaged with the initiative. As a result we advocate a move towards integrated diabetes care within the community. Copyright Â© 2014 Primary Care Diabetes Europe. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Patients in General Internal Medicine Clinics Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Centers were randomized into seven intervention or control firms. Patient self-reported information was collected by mail on general health, diabetes, and up to five other chronic conditions. Patients with diabetes received the Seattle Diabetes Questionnaire, the 36-item Medical Outcomes Study short form (SF-36), and a validated patient satisfaction questionnaire at regular intervals. Data from self-report, clinical, pharmacy, and laboratory sources were synthesized into patient-specific feedback reports that intervention providers received before patients' visits. The timely delivery to primary care providers of state-of-the-art patient-feedback reports that identified patient issues and areas for improvement did not result in significant improvements in patient outcomes between the intervention and control firms. Outcomes in diabetic patients whose providers received synthesized patient data before visits were no better than in those receiving care from control firms. Future studies may benefit from substantial involvement in patients discussing, problem solving, and goal setting in addition to use of timely synthesized patient data.\n\nEvaluation of a program to improve diabetes care through intensified care management activities and diabetes medication copayment reduction.\n\nPubMed\n\nKogut, Stephen J; Johnson, Scott; Higgins, Tara; Quilliam, Brian\n\n2012-05-01\n\nfor intervention than comparison patients (means [SDs] of $3,139 [$3,426] vs. $2,854 [$3,938], respectively, P < 0.001); and the generic-dispensing ratio was slightly lower (means [SDs] of 62.1% [22.4%] and 65.4% [23.0%], respectively, P < 0.001). There were no significant differences between the intervention and comparison groups in mean [SD] PPPY all-cause medical care costs ($7,475 [$17,601] vs. $8,577 [$22,972], respectively, P = 0.213) or total all-cause costs ($10,613 [$18,590] vs. $11,431 [$24,060], P = 0.666). Patients participating in this incentive program featuring diabetes medication copayment reduction and disease management components did not receive recommended care any more or less frequently than other enrolled members with diabetes. Younger patients and those utilizing oral antidiabetic monotherapy as their drug regimens were less likely to have the recommended processes of care performed. While prescription drug expenditures incurred by the plan were greater for intervention patients, between-group differences in total costs for medications and all-cause medical care were not statistically significant. Further follow-up is required to determine the success of this program over the longer term in promoting quality of care and achieving cost reductions and improved health outcomes.\n\n[Better coordination between primary care, community settings and diabetes outpatient clinic for patients with type 2 diabetes].\n\nPubMed\n\nGjessing, Hans JÃ¸rgen; JÃ¸rgensen, Ulla Linding; MÃ¸ller, Charlotte Chrois; Huge, Lis; Dalgaard, Anne Mette; Nielsen, Kristian Wendelboe; Thomsen, Lis; Buch, Martin Sandberg\n\n2014-06-02\n\nIntegrated care programmes for patients with type 2 diabetes can be successfully implemented by planning the programmes in coordination between the sectors primary care, community settings and diabetes outpatient clinic, and with involvement of leaders and employees.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the implementation of a cluster randomised controlled trial of a group-based, peer support program to improve diabetes self-management and thereby, diabetes control in people with Type 2 Diabetes in Victoria, Australia. The intervention program was designed to address four key peer support functions i.e. 1) assistance in daily management, 2) social and emotional support, 3) regular linkage to clinical care, and 4) ongoing and sustained support to assist with the lifelong needs of diabetes self-care management. The intervention participants attended monthly group meetings facilitated by a trained peer leader for 12Â months. Data was collected on the intervention's reach, participation, implementation fidelity, groups' effectiveness and participants' perceived support and satisfaction with the intervention. The RE-AIM and PIPE frameworks were used to guide this evaluation. The trial reached a high proportion (79%) of its target population through mailed invitations. Out of a total of 441 eligible individuals, 273 (61.9%) were willing to participate. The intervention fidelity was high (92.7%). The proportion of successful participants who demonstrated a reduction in 5Â years cardiovascular disease risk score was 65.1 and 44.8% in the intervention and control arm respectively. Ninety-four percent (94%) of the intervention participants stated that the program helped them manage their diabetes on a day to day basis. Overall, attending monthly group meetings provided 'a lot of support' to 57% and 'moderate' support to 34% of the participants. Peer support programs are feasible, acceptable and can be used to supplement treatment for patients motivated to improve behaviours related to diabetes. However, program planners need to focus on the participation component in designing future programs.

We conducted a group randomized controlled trial of 12 intervention and 14 control staff providers and 307 intervention and 291 control patients with type 2 diabetes in a hospital-based internal medicine clinic. Providers were randomly assigned from May 1998 through April 1999 to have access to the DMA (intervention) or not to have access (control). The DMA displays interactive patient-specific clinical data, treatment advice, and links to other web-based care resources. We compared patients in the intervention and control groups for changes in processes and outcomes of care from the year preceding the study through the year of the study by intention-to-treat analysis. The DMA was used for 42% of scheduled patient visits. The number of HbA(1c) tests obtained per year increased significantly in the intervention group (+0.3 tests/year) compared with the control group (-0.04 tests/year, P = 0.008), as did the number of LDL cholesterol tests (intervention, +0.2 tests/year; control, +0.01 tests/year; P = 0.02) and the proportions of patients undergoing at least one foot examination per year (intervention, +9.8%; control, -0.7%; P = 0.003). Levels of HbA(1c) decreased by 0.2 in the intervention group and increased by 0.1 in the control group (P = 0.09); proportions of patients with LDL cholesterol levels <130 mg/dl increased by 20.3% in the intervention group and 10.5% in the control group (P = 0.5).

This review by two seasoned diabetes care providers is intended to shed light on the fundamental flaws we believe to underlie that poor performance, and suggest options for better outcomes and cost efficiencies. Despite major advances in diabetes management medications and tools, overall public health with regard to diabetes outcomes remains poor. Efforts focused on controlling costs appear to be exacerbating the problem. For chronic diseases like diabetes, fee-for-service care models are fundamentally flawed and predictably fail. We suggest that a major overhaul of the medical economics underlying diabetes care can improve patient outcomes and decrease costs.\n\nImplementing elements of a context-adapted chronic care model to improve first-line diabetes care: effects on assessment of chronic illness care and glycaemic control among people with diabetes enrolled to the First-Line Diabetes Care (FiLDCare) Project in the Northern Philippines.\n\nPubMed\n\nKu, Grace M V; Kegels, Guy\n\n2015-09-01\n\nAim The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of implementing elements of a context-adapted chronic disease-care model (CACCM) in two local government primary healthcare units of a non-highly urbanized city and a rural municipality in the Philippines on Patients' Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (PACIC) and glycaemic control (HbA1c) of people with diabetes. Low-to-middle income countries like the Philippines are beset with rising prevalence of chronic conditions but their healthcare systems are still acute disease oriented. Attention towards improving care for chronic conditions particularly in primary healthcare is imperative and ways by which this can be done amidst resource constraints need to be explored. A chronic care model was adapted based on the context of the Philippines. Selected elements (community sensitization, decision support, minor re-organization of health services, health service delivery-system re-design, and self-management education and support) were implemented. PACIC and HbA1c were measured before and one year after the start of implementation. Findings The improvements in the PACIC (median, from 3.2 to 3.5) as well as in four of the five subsets of the PACIC were statistically significant (P-values: PACIC=0.009; 'patient activation'=0.026; 'goal setting'=0.017; 'problem solving'<0.001; 'follow-up'<0.001).
