        "text": "Tommy Page, who died on Friday (March 3) at age 46, was a rare teen star who morphed into a successful music executive.\n\nBorn Thomas Alden Page in New Jersey in 1970, he began playing the piano at age eight.\n\nHere's more about the singer and writer of hits such as A Shoulder To Cry On.\n\n1. Teen heart-throb\n\nThe singer-songwriter, said to have an uncanny resemblance to Elvis Presley, set young girls screaming with his floppy dark locks and soulful eyes.\n\nHe was just 18 when A Shoulder To Cry On, a track from his 1988 debut self-titled album, made him a star in Asia.\n\nTwo years later, I'll Be Your Everything, from his second studio album Paintings In My Mind, hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\n2. Asian connection\n\nWhile he's known as a one-hit wonder in the US for his Billboard hit, his songs had more success in Asia.\n\nHe worked the Asian market with concerts here in the 1990s and duets with artistes from the region.\n\nPage sang a duet with Hong Kong songstress Sally Yeh called I'm Always Dreaming Of You in 1992.\n\nWhen he returned to Singapore in 2015, he said in an interview: \"Singapore is a special place to me because it was this part of the world that first embraced my music.\"\n\nPage, along with R&B quartet Color Me Badd and Grammy-winning group All-4-One, was here for Retrolicious 2015.\n\n4. Best work\n\nPage's two hits have become karaoke staples over time, but he did not find singing them cringeworthy.\n\nIn fact, he thought A Shoulder To Cry On was his best work.\n\n\"I know there are some artistes who get tired of performing the songs they are best known for, but I'm not one of them,\" he said in 2015.\n\n\"Shoulder and Everything are two of the greatest blessings that have happened to me. I always get a special feeling inside when I sing them.\n\n5. Shift behind the scenes\n\nIn the late 1990s, he went back to school and graduated from New York University Stern School of Business in 1997.\n\nHe has had a successful career behind the scenes since.\n\nPage spent almost two decades at Warner Bros. Records, was a publisher at Billboard and headed industry relations at US Internet radio service Pandora. He was also vice-president of music partnerships at The Village Voice.\n\n6. Mentor to many stars"
