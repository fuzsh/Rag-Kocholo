        "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Veteran singer Mazuin Hamzah may not be known to social media-savvy youths of today but celebrity chef Datuk Zamzani Abdul Wahab or Chef Zam has just won her a brand new following.\n\nHe recently uploaded a TikTok video featuring 58-year-old Mazuin singing one of her best known songs Cinta Palsu and Netizens were mesmerised by her superb vocals and \"ageless beauty\".\n\n\"Wow! She is still so beautiful, in looks and vocals all these years. I fondly remember watching her in Taman Tasik Perdana back then,\" said a Netizen Slamah Ibrahim.\n\nIt is learnt that Chef Zam recently paid the 1980s pop princess a visit at her residence in Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei.\n\nMazuin who carries the Bruneian aristocratic title Datuk Laila Utama first found fame as the singer and drummer of her family band Quinary M in the first half of the 1980s.\n\nMazuin, the Ipoh-born cousin of singer-actress Amy Mastura Suhaimi, has been staying out of the limelight since her marriage to Bruneian royal Pengiran Sufri Bolkiah, 72, from 1987 to 2003.\n\nMazuin and Pengiran Sufri have two daughters aged 35 and 31."
