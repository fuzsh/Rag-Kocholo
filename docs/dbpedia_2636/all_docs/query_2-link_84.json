        "text": "10.37pm, October 08th 1977 - Hospital Sultanah Aminah, Johor Bahru...[ward 13]... a baby girl named Noor Anita [combination of her dad's name & mom's name] was born... being the only sibling to elder brother - Mohd Nazrul.\n\nMost of my childhood spent in Labuan F.T. But since I am a problem student [labelled by most teachers] when I was a student, I've changed a number of schools nationwide - Labuan, Kuching [Sarawak], Johor Bahru, Klang [Selangor], Kota Kinabalu [Sabah]. Man... how I realized that I've troubled my parents when I was a teenager...Bad girl...\n\nAnyway, although I am problem student but I also a favourite student because I am quite brilliant in academic. [cewahhhh!!!] Bahasa Melayu, English, Science are my favourite subjects. Was a school's darling in Field events when it comes to sports. Hold quite a number of higher level positions in many clubs & associations as well.\n\nManaged to enter higher institution of studies right after SPM [no need to mention] but honestly, I screwed up and didn't obtained a good grade. ..moral of the story: don't enjoy too much, do not fall in love when you're still studying. Regret? I'll be lying if I say \"NO\" but I'll try to make things better my way. Sometimes... we gotta believe that there's always a blessing in disguise... although you're the one who messed everything up! Hehehe....\n\nI am a very active and aggresive person.. very... I love to involve in extreme activities as well. I love high-speed driving, rollerblading diving and swimming. Besides that, I am also very much into outdoor activities such as camping, jungle trekking, backpacking and travelling. Anyway, although like that, I am also can be considered as a domestic person because I love to cook [i can cook varities of dishes - Malay, Chinese (minus those \"haram\" things - lah!), Western, Fusion and even Japanese], decorate my house/room. Hey, I don't have a smooth palm as I do a lot of housework such laundrette, scrubing, sweeping...\n\nIn here, I would like to reveal one thing - I hate girls. I mean those typical girls - \"gedik\", \"mengada-ngada\", \"manja\", \"lembik\", \"birah\" and such lah! Yaiii! I rather die from sitting in one room with `em! NO! I am not a lesbian!!! Just because I hate girls, doesn't mean I am a lesbian although I am a bit like a tomboy. Hehehe... I did fall in love a few times... So, I am a normal, straight person...\n\nSo, that's all about me. If there is anything else you wanna know, you're are welcome to e-mail me..."
