        "text": "Terbit perasaan malam ini untuk aku berpuisi.\n\nTapi aku bukan pujangga.\n\nStok perasan saja.\n\nJadi lebih baik aku kongsi hasil kerja orang lain.\n\nDengan kredit diberi. Aku bukan manusia yang curi kek coklat.\n\nyou shall above all things be glad and young oleh saudara ee cummings\n\nyou shall above all things be glad and young\n\nFor if you’re young,whatever life you wear\n\nit will become you;and if you are glad\n\nwhatever’s living will yourself become.\n\nGirlboys may nothing more than boygirls need:\n\ni can entirely her only love\n\nwhose any mystery makes every man’s\n\nflesh put space on;and his mind take off time\n\nthat you should ever think,may god forbid\n\nand (in his mercy) your true lover spare:\n\nfor that way knowledge lies,the foetal grave\n\ncalled progress,and negation’s dead undoom.\n\nI’d rather learn from one bird how to sing\n\nthan teach ten thousand stars how not to dance\n\n*****\n\nDan: I fell in love with her, Alice.\n\nAlice: Oh, as if you had no choice? There’s a moment, there’s always a moment, “I can do this, I can give into this, or I can resist it”, and I don’t know when your moment was, but I bet you there was one.\n\nWhen was your moment, and what was your choice?\n\nI learnt, late last night, that there are more cars on the road from KL to Bangi at 1am in September 2008, then there are from Bangi to Seremban at 5.30am in the morning in 2001/2002. I also learnt that I quite miss Radio 4 on the BBC, because I gave up my car a few months ago and I only listen to Radio 5 Live at home. I then remembered the little love affair (unrequited, of course, as the best ones always are) I had with Red 104.9 FM (are they still on air, even?) in the year that I drove to and from Muadzam Shah. I feel sorry for the township. It reminds me of an unloved mongre. I think in its early days Bangi was a lot like that. Except that Bangi had KL on its doorstep. Muadzam Shah doesn’t even have half a prayer. I apologise to all who come from or live from Muadzam Shah. Apart from the awesome char kuay teow, there is nothing that even remotely resembles a fond memory that I managed to take away from that place. But then, that’s just me. I project pain on inanimate objects and Godforsaken townships.\n\nI listened to Red 104.9 because it was the one station that I didn’t need to change dials for as I drove from Bangi, down south to Senawang and then across to Kuala Pilah (my Kancil pwnnedd Bukit Putus, yo!) through to Batu Kikir before the 70km straight stretch through the Feldas of East Negeri Sembilan until I found myself in Pahang. I did this every week for a whole year. The drive back was usually midday Friday, for two reasons: one, I wanted to be on the right side of Negeri Sembilan by the time people came out of Friday prayers; and two, Paula Malai Ali had a 12-2 spot.\n\nI am reminded of this little radio station because as I was listening to music via iTrip in the car yesterday, my normal frequency of 88.9 was taken over by a station Nor later told me (and I then told the older A) was BFM. So I had to start looking for another frequency to transmit to, and this was actually rather tricky, because it seems that all of them were taken! I ended up listening to Fly FM instead, which made a nice change from Mix FM which has, for two days now, been playing Shaggy songs for some reason (Mr Lover Lover, not Scooby’s best mate). In the UK music is very insular and UK-centric, and I’m a fan of Americana and indie-folk rock. The two don’t mesh on Radio 1, so I get my fix via One Tree Hill and Greys’ Anatomy. So Fly FM, who is this Daughtry guy and what is it about now?\n\nThe first incarnation of this blog began as I was getting ready to leave Muadzam Shah. Little did I know then that it was to be for good, although driving out of the town, I rememebr saying a little prayer that I hope this would be the last time ever. But then I still harboured hopes that they’d transfer out of there. That was a good six years ago, to the day. (Ha kalau rajin gi la cari entry 23 October 2002). It is now a totally different life I lead, and upon reflecting I cannot help but think about the path not taken. Had I stayed, what would have happened? I think I would have pretty much quit anyway, because as the year droned on only escape made me get up and get dressed in the morning. But if I headed back to KL, instead of taking a flight far far away, would I now be married with three kids? Would I have met the people I’ve since met? The paths that me and some of my friends and acquaintances have crossed have been rather novel ones; but I would like to think that they still would have done so, sooner or later. We tend to gravitate to those most like us, to those who see us in our best light despite being at our worst. Those are the ties that endure. Or at least, I’d like to think so.\n\nI would very much like to believe that fate has always pegged me at Point B. Whether I get there via Points C, D, E or via a direct route: that is life. What makes it worth living is what I learnt along the detours.\n\nSecretly, I wanted it to be a long, drawn out process. Because the process of getting me there to do ‘it’ was a long, drawn out process in the first place. I dodged and ducked, sideswiped and lunged; and in the end it took a government incentive plan to finally draw me out of hiding. The Malaysian government were offering rebates of RM625 for car owners after road tax renewals, but you need to produce your MyKad for the application to be processed. And with two cars in my name, there was RM1250 at stake. That’s a little over Â£200. That’s a lot of money. And that was enough to set aside my resentment at the MyKad rollout and joined the masses. *sigh* RM1250… I am so cheap, I should be a BN MP.\n\nI even took time to deliberate over what I was to wear to the Registration Office. The water crisis over the weekend meant that my t-shirts took back billing compared to work clothes and school uniforms, so all I had left were an orange OrangUtan t-shirt that read ‘No Photos Please’, a red t-shirt with the words ‘Let’s Go Corea’ emblazoned across the front, and an old England jersey. Not quite advertising patriotism. I was tempted to go with the ‘No Photos’ but I was afraid a sense of irony did not permeate Malaysian civil servants, JPN Era Baru or not. Take into consideration the fact that I am almost half a decade later than everyone else RE: Mykad, poking fun and making statements might not go down all that well. Plus there’s the small matter of my actually wanting to leave in 2 weeks…\n\nSo yes, in the end I ironed a shirt and went off to Putrajaya in khakis AND proper shoes – something I’d usually only do if I am going on a date, to an open house or in futile attempts not to show the younger A up at the shopping malls. I even packed two books, mentally preparing myself for a long wait. (Okay, not that long, but I was on the final pages of the David Sedaris, and I thought the wait would mean I may have needed to start another).\n\nAlas, all my expectations of inefficiencies were not met. For starters, the place was not crowded with soon-to-be-legal immigrants jostling about looking for a quick way to cut the queue. Neither was there a whiff of eau-de-sweaty-bodies permeating, nor did one start feeling as if sweat was dripping from every orifice the moment one stepped into the office. No, it was actually nice and airy, with the airconditioning just right and a pleasant ambiance all the way through. Upon approaching the counter I stated my business and was asked, pleasantly, I might add, why I had not yet changed my old IC. I told her that I worked and lived abroad, and that was that. No one brought it up again. I was given a number and was told to wait my turn. “No forms to fill?” I asked. “No forms,” she replied with a smile.\n\nWhich is really the scary bit. Because when I went up to the counter when it was my turn, all the clerk did was take a look at my old IC, clarified that I still lived at the same address and asked me if I was a Muslim; and that was it. Everything else was apparently ‘already in the system’. No wonder we do not have Big Brother the TV Show. Why bother recreating anything when we have the real thing? So how much do ‘they’ know about me, I wonder. I brought it up with an acquaintance once, whose general sentiment on the issue was, well, what have you got to hide anyway? I mulled over that statement for a long time, way beyond the the casual conversation we had. What have I got to hide? On the one hand, I suppose, nothing. On the other, everything.\n\nAll in all, the process took me about 20 minutes, which was shorter than the drive over (considering I lived in Bangi). After my picture was taken (JPN uses a Canon Powershot G7) I was sent home and told to check the status of my application tommorow and Thursday, and I was to pick up the new MyKad thereafter. If I go to JPN on Thursday morning, I will be RM625 richer by Thursday afternoon. So how come I feel like I’m poorer for it?\n\nIgnore ajer video clip; lyrics dia yang aku rasa best. Not sure who wrote it, but I like it that it sounds more like poetry than a song\n\n*****\n\nI wonder how many obscure medical journals the writers of House M.D scour in search of the complicated symptoms and diagnosis that finally make the show. I imagine them sat around a table, piles of medical journals stacked atop one another, as a team of young turks better known as underpaid interns play a game of one-upmanship, scoring brownie points if â€˜my disease is better than your diseaseâ€™. â€œSure, your whatchamacallitis makes the eyeballs fall out, but my thingiarcoma makes the nose blow up!â€\n\nApart from the medical jargon which I profess to have extremely limited knowledge of ( I stopped studying biology at 15), it sounds like a job I would feel perfectly at home with. I like research. I like finding things out. And then I like writing about what I find out. I like seeing the patterns emerge from randomness. I like trying to explain how the patterns work, and then telling myself why they wonâ€™t. How many jobs offer those opportunities, and pay me for it as well, without me having to brownnose my way, no, not to my superiors but make sure office politics play right by me. I swear I will rather walk with a fake limp and live with a snarl before I am ever told to go hold bunga manggars again. There wasnâ€™t even a sultan to take me as his young(ish) bride, for crying out loud!\n\nI ended up watching two episodes of House back to back because the internet connection at Le Casa was down for the better part of the day. In fact, access to the internet has been sporadic since I wrote about how great it was that we are now connected to Streamyx, Nadia was at school and I no longer needed to drive around all of KL to find decent internet access that did not charge me by the hour amidst truant schoolkids playing CounterStrike. It seems as if saying nice things about Streamyx makes your connection go down (connection go dowwnnn.. connection go dooownnn – sung to the tune of the Mary Poppins song).\n\nI’ve been trying to slow down on watching the downloaded stuff because these are meant to be watched while I am by my lonesome self on cold, wet evenings in England. In Malaysia it is better to watch the trash passed off as tv, and mentally make notes that the trash served here are actually better than the trash you get in the UK. For one thing, we don’t have Big Brother. A fact that I am forever grateful for, except that I only am in Malaysia one month a year at most.\n\nWhich brings me to my last fortnight here. MyKad pun tak buat lagi. Orang di UK marah gila bila bicara soal ID card. Di Malaysia dari dulu kita tak pernah persoalkan. Apakah orang Malaysia bodoh, atau sebenarnya orang UK angkuh?\n\nThe video isn’t HD quality, but you get the string quartet’s bits in her performance. Mesmerising, is the word I’d use\n\n“You don’t write as much anymore,” said E when I met her at Yuna’s EP launch last Sunday. Writing isn’t the only thing I seem to have shelved of late. I don’t make much of an effort to seek out old friends much, either, when I’m home. I remember a time when I drove to KL almost everyday, often in search of free internet access and space to work. These days, Le Casa has a wireless network, and Nadia is grown up enough to not bug me when I use the laptop anymore. And in years past I think I was still searching for something, and running away from it at the same time. I’ve given up that ghost, because whatever energy I have left is better used running around a football pitch instead.\n\nAnyway, of said EP launch. If the name Yuna sounds familiar in these pages, that’s probably because I’ve waxed lyrical about the 22-year old law student before. I panicked a bit when word got round that tickets to her EP launch mini-concert were selling fast, but we managed to get tickets in the end with a bit to spare. I bumped into MC & E, friends of yore, who found a nice wall to lean back against. Looking at the twenty-something crowd in front of us, I decided to join the people on the right side of 30. I swear, save for Yuna’s mum, we were the oldest people in that room.\n\nHer performance didn’t disappoint. There were moments where her enunciation sounded Malaysian rather than the neutral accent most singers take, but the richness of her voice and the beauty of her tunes overrode any minor glitches. The setting was intimate enough for many in the audience to feel as if they were being serenaded by her, and I was reminded of the Missy Higgins gig I went to a few years ago, where for Â£7.50, we were treated to both Missy and Nerina Pallot (another singer-songwriter whose lyrical prowess I envy). Except that Yuna had a string quartet accompany her for her lagu ‘cari makan’, Deeper Conversation.\n\nTicket prices included a free CD of the EP, and having listened to it (no, not on loop lah), while I think the EP is better produced, her demos sound more honest as a result of its lack of polish. There is always an intimacy with bedroom demos that you never quite get with studio productions. MC asked if I wanted to meet the singer, and I declined. I don’t think I’ve ever been that kind of fan. There is enchantment in the mystery. (Mainly because reality is always a letdown, but that’s another story). But if you read this, Cik Yuna, I hope you NEVER sell out, kiddo. Old people like me need young people like you to keep it real so we can pretend it was all worth it. When it stops being about the music and the words, then the music and the words need to stop.\n\nI played the CD to Nor when I drove her home from our dinner with Eddy at Muhibbah yesterday, and I commented on the singer’s age. “Can you believe she’s 22 and writes all that?” I said. “But that’s when you write your most honest stuff,” she replied, and I had to agree. With the world at your feet and the future waiting to be painted, every feeling is real, every heartbreak resonant, every elation heartfelt. Ah, how I miss being 22.\n\nAlthough admittedly, growing up has its perks. I am no longer angry; or perhaps, as angry. These days I no longer fight, although I never cease to struggle. Some days are hard, but acceptance helps. As I have been told many times over the past few weeks, things will eventually be alright. To quote the woman of the moment, I don’t hate you anymore for the way you remind me of the person I cannot be.\n\nAku ada dua lagi CD minah ni. Dr. Roger, kau nak?\n\nApakah Nadia bakal menjadi pembaca tegar suatu hari nanti?\n\nIs it just me, or is Rozie Rashid perpetually playing the deserted kampung wife / single mother / struggling woman making ends meet? I am the first confess that I have OD’ed on Malay telemovies this Eid, and other than Rosyam Nor being constantly plagued with guilt and Fauziah Nawi playing his long-suffering mother, Rozie Rashid in aforementioned roles seem to be a constant. If you think about it, this stereotyping of sorts for Rozie extends to even the silver screen: in both Gubra and Kami she plays these roles. All I can think of at the moment is that she gets these roles because she looks mighty fine in kain batik. Hence therefore I think I will officially appoint her the Duta for my Pakailah Kain Batik campaign.\n\nSuatu hari nanti, kalau aku ada kugiran, aku pasti memberikannya nama ‘Rozie Rashid and the Kain Batik Divas’. Aku harap mereka membenarkan kugiran ini menjadi sessionist utk lagu kempen, “Cinta Kain Batik”, yang bakal digubah oleh Saari Amri dan didendangkan oleh Siti Nurhaliza.\n\n*****\n\nIs it just me, or is there a revival when it comes to the Malaysian music scene? Only 2-3 years ago, trying to get CDs (or tapes!) of artists that once graced my teenagehood was akin to finding a sponge in a haystack – not as hard as trying to find a needle, but you need to chuck away a lot of hay. This year, upon visiting the same outlets, compilations or reissues of CDs, often with an extra track or two, are no longer far and few in between. I picked up two in particular – an EMI compilation of Ramli Sarip and Ella hits, and a collection called Balada which featured Ella’s top ballads of the past. (Yes, I am an Ella fan). Today I found another CD which featured Amy Mastura’s most popular songs, in the same row as Best Ofs from Ziana Zain and Aishah. (I did not buy the Amy Mastura CD even though I am a closeted fan of hers).\n\nThis is not a Malaysian-centric phenomenon; former greats of the international pop scene such as Take That, the Spice Girls and New Kids on the Block are headlining reunion tours of their own. But in the Malaysian context, re-releases and re-issues may not mean that stars of the yesteryears are in need of more dosh as per the conspiracy theory behind the comebacks of others; could it be that the current crop of Akademia Fantasia-bred ‘talents’ are not good enough to hold public interest beyond a specific time frame?\n\nApa-apa pun.. bagus jugak ada CD tu dijual semua. Senang aku nak prektis nyanyi dalam kereta. Mimi jom karaoke.\n\n*****\n\nIs it just me or.. ah. Nevermind.\n\n*****\n\nSebenarnya aku gelisah, memikirkan keadaan rakyat Malaysia andai Najib Tun Razak jadi ketua; dan Mohamad M. Taib sebagai deputynya. Bukan aku sangsi dengan kepimpinan mereka, kerana they are astute politicians to get this far in the first place. Tapi UMNO khasnya dan BN amnya bicara soal reformasi, soal phoenix rising from the ashes. Tidak adakah orang lain yang mempunyai baggage akhlak dan skandal yang lebih hebat untuk dijadikan pemimpin? Mungkin Rahim Tamby Chik perlu mencampakkan topi beliau ke dalam gelanggang.\n\nBila difikirkan secara menyeluruh, terlintas di hati bahawa Khairy Jamaluddin is no longer that scary an option. And that in itself is a scary, scary thought.\n\nYa Allah Ya Tuhan kami, deliver us from evil.\n\nAmin.\n\nBeradik beradik\n\nKata orang, raya sebulan; but officially for me the festivities ended yesterday when Zahid boarded his flight to Sydney via Brisbane (terima kasih Air Asia, kamu membolehkan kami sekeluarga cukup haul untuk berhari raya tahun ini!). Sekarang tinggallah kami lima beradik, which is one more than the usual four my parents see on a weekly, if not daily, basis. Although in actual fact, there are just two of us at home with my folks: me and Nadia. Abe left for Manila in the wee hours of today for a conference until Friday, and his parting words were: “Sekarang kau dapat la rasa macam mana jadi anak tunggal beradik satu.” He sauntered off before I could point out that anak tunggals did not actually have adiks..\n\nIt’s been a swell raya not so much because of the festivities, but the reunion feel this year. There has always been at least one person missing in action for the past 8 Aidilfitris (mostly me, lately both me and Zahid) so I revelled in the company of the siblings I once swore drove me insane only a decade ago. Having everyone home meant travelling to and fro neccessitated two cars, much to the consternation of Zahid the born-again enviromentalist (“Abah, kita tukar NGV la abah”); and living space was cramped to say the least. This house was small for 5 of us as teenagers, so it’s downright tiny for 4 full grown adults and 1 spouse, one teenager and one child plus mom and dad. This meant rather interesting sleeping arrangements which saw Ishqi grab a room by virtue of being the married one, Abe sleeping in his bed because he lives here, Farah in front of the upstairs tv, Nadia on her day bed downstairs with Zahid on the couch next to her, and yours truly semi-outside in the extended porch section that has a grille but no walls. Balik setahun sekali… kena tidur kat luar lagi.. *sigh* (sebenarnya best sebab sangat cooling, and with two ubat nyamuks at full force even the mosquitoes stayed away!).\n\nFriday night (raya ke-3) saw the whole Stapa clan – i.e. my dad’s siblings – congregate at my aunt’s house. Funnily enough, 5/6th of my dad’s siblings live in Bangi (or it’s suburbs) with 1/6th living in JB but can often be seen in 43650 anyway. A barbeque of sorts was held as my grandma performed her nazar to slaughter a goat once she got better from the kidney infection that had her in hospital for most of Ramadhan. She is still bedridden, but her appetite has returned and she is looking healthy relative to recent months. My dad took the opportunity to take pictures of the whole clan of grandchildren – given that this is also the first time everyone was in Bangi (again, me the guilty party).\n\nOn Saturday we went to Kesang Laut in Muar, where my mom’s maternal cousins live. It is only in recent years that I learnt my family are not 103% Kelantanese as I once thought. My late maternal grandmother’s mother (yes, my great grandmother) is Chinese, and she married my Jawa great grandfather. It was only when my grandmother married my grandfather that they moved lock stock to Kelantan. Of late these relatives have been coming out of the woodworks, for one reason or another, so we often get dragged to reunions here there and everywhere.\n\nIt almost seems befitting that these new relatives are in Muar, in Johor, because even as a staunch non-UMNOrite I have very strong links with the southern state. I spent my formative schooling years there, and our batch had a high concentration of Johoreans. On Sunday the older A drove me, the older M and the younger A to Batu Pahat to attend Kokang’s wedding. The southern highway link these days stretches all the way down to just outside JB; where as in my younger days, we had to exit at Pagoh or Tangkak and make our way down the state to its tip via the very poorly maintained roads. My dad, in the car towards LCCT last night, reminisced the particularly poor Parit Sulong roads which he still abhors with a vengeance. We left the highway at Yong Peng (U) so we didn’t go through Yong Peng town, which holds a particular memory for me. As a 13 year old heading to STF for the first time, we stopped at Restoran Zainab in the middle of the town to have roti canai for breakfast. It was me, my dad, my Pak Ngah who drove us and my paternal grandmother, for some reason. Arriving there I realised that I forgot to take passport size photos as required by the school for registration purposes; luckily at 8am in the morning a small Chinese photo shop had polaroid capabilities (it was 1990, digital photography.. non-existent). Last time I drove through Yong Peng, I saw the restaurant still there standing; but no longer the photo shop.\n\nEn-route to Hotel Katerina where Kokang’s reception was held, we passed through townships like Tongkang Pechah, where Eta’s parents live; and later as we headed to Mooke’s homestead in Bagan, we drove through Peserai, where Zazerque, if I recall correctly, went to primary school. All hooks to a past I never quite think about as much as I ought to.\n\nWalaupun dilarang, aku tetap terjal dan mengambil gambar ini\n\nWe went to the photo studio today because my dad wanted to take a family picture. Getting all six of us under one roof is a monumental task and a logistical nightmare; so this year seems to provide the best opportunity to update the family portrait. The one that hangs at our house has Nadia as a baby, and no Faiz. My mum took the liberty of making us two pairs of baju raya this year – one of which was the same for everyone: light green with purple motifs for the girls, and a light green baju melayu for the boys.\n\nAfter the shoot my dad decided to take a trip to Mines Wonderland so Nadia could go on the boats there – which had to be cancelled as it was chucking down when we got there – but it was quite interesting to see people snapping photos of us as we walked through the shopping center in uniform.\n\nIt is twenty-to-nine at night on the second day of Hari Raya now, and with Nadia already asleep, my mom taking a nap and Faiz upstairs with a toothache (takpe Faiz, adik ipar mung dentist), it is just the five of us chilling out in the lounge downstairs. Feels quite nice. Abe’s put on a Korean DVD on and 4/5th of the brood are enjoying it – 1/5th is blogging. I am not one for Korean movies or tv shows, but its nice to just sit here and be by ourselves for a bit. Zahid leaves for Australia on Monday, so it’ll be quite a while yet until the older siblings will have a chance to just enjoy each other’s company again. Perhaps it’s a good thing there are no grandchildren yet running riot here and there; I don’t think we’ve annoyed each other enough yet over the past 20-odd years. I know I will miss this.\n\n*****\n\nMore used to seeing him with a guitar strapped across his front, seeing a picture of our Dr. Roger in kain pelekat was something different. Not in a bad way, of course, but as rare as it is that I see people of my generation in pelekats (Jordan Macvay is another exception – I believe he thinks they are a godsend!), I see even less of my female friends in kain batiks. Although to be fair, I don’t think there are any of me in kain batiks either floating about in cyberspace that I know of, even though I am an avid aficionado of the kain whenever I am in Malaysia. Perhaps it is because most of the time when I am in kain batik I am at home, and I rarely see the point of donning on my tudung just to prove to (shock?) the world that I am a regular batik wearer.\n\nI think I got my first kain batik from my mum when I was eleven, and ever since then I would prefer to wear it rather than don a pair of shorts or bermudas or capris when I am at home. Truth be told, when it gets a tad too humid and sticky in England, I whip out the less-often used batik from my drawers and wear that instead. It definitely is more cooling, and when tied in a haphazard way as I do, allows as much legroom as a pair of shorts would. Plus.. when you’re playing football with the brothers in the porch, it acts as a third goalkeeping hand.\n\nFor some reason, kain batiks are often thought of as something backward or kampung, compared to the kain pelekat. On Malaysian tv serials, the male protagonists are often portrayed as pelekat wearers regardless of whether they play the modern man or a wife beater, but their female counterparts are often seen in pyjamas or baju kelawar, unless they are paddy farmers, have just given birth to a child, or kampung dwellers in their 60’s. I wonder why. Perhaps, to continue the efforts of the late Datin Endon Mahmood and her batik legacy, we should launch a ‘Pakailah Kain Batik’ campaign for the modern woman. I’m sure I can get funding."
