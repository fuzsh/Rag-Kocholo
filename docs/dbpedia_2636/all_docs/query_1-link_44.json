        "text": "The Masked Singer Malaysia is a Malaysian mystery and reality music show based on the Masked Singer franchise which originated from the South Korean television program King of Mask Singer.\n\nTwelve contestants who are well-known figures from various backgrounds, such as singers, actors, hosts, athletes and more, will be vying for the top spot by charming the audience and jury with just their voices. They will be judged by a panel of jury made up of popular local celebrities. To further keep the contestants' identities top secret, only eight members of the production team have been entrusted with their true identities. Every week, before each performance, a video clip will be revealed to the audience as a clue for the identity of each contestant. After each performance, the jury members are required to make a guess and name 3 celebrities who are most likely to be the identity behind the masked singer. In the end of the show, one contestant with the lowest rank will be eliminated based on the marks percentage given by the panelist. His or her face will then be revealed for the first time. The only contestant to remain masked until the final elimination round will be named the first champion of \"The Masked Singer Malaysia\". The show, which is taped weekly with a live audience at Royal Theatre, Shah Alam, is held on a smaller scale than usual. The number of audience members is limited in compliance with current social distancing procedures.\n\nSeries Overview[]\n\nSeason Contestants Episodes Duration dates Winner Runner-Up Third Place Fourth Place Fifth Place 1 12 8 Sept. 18, 2020 - Nov. 6, 2020 Bunga Raya Rajah Brooke Orang Utan Wau Enggang 2 14 10 Jan. 28, 2022 - Apr. 1, 2022 Rambutan Seladang Orkid Burung Hantu Ratu Semut 3 15 11 Dec. 23, 2022 - Mar. 3, 2023 Betta Fish Nyoq Muda Piza Panas Dewi Angsa Brokoli 4 14 10 Dec. 17, 2023 - Feb. 18, 2024 Bunga Matahari Mat Helang Sang Kangil Biskut Aiskrim Teratai\n\nTrivia[]"
