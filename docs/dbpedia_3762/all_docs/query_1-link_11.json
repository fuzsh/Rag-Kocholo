MACMICHAEL, D.S.O. SUDAN POLITICAL SERVICE VOLUME I CAMBRIDGE AT THE UNIVERSITY PRESS Mr de Herbelot pretends that the Arabs of the Defart exceed the other Arabs in Wit and Cunning. ...Be this as it will ; both the one and the other are mightily fond of the Noblenefs of their Extraction. The Chevalier D’Arvieux, Travels in Arabia the Desart (1718 a. pp. 96-7. INTRODUCTION O NE of the first steps which anyone desirous of studying the history of a people naturally takes is to consult such native records as may be extant and appraise their importance as evidence. Following this course in the case of the Sudan Arab one is sur- prised to find that a large proportion of the population is in possession of scraps of paper which they regard as having a historical value. The owner often cannot read, but he is prepared to produce for inspection a handful of disreputable papers, torn, frayed and filthy. Some turn out to be unintelligible contracts concerning the cultivation of a plot of land, some are extracts from a manual of prayer and ablution, some are promissory notes: others contain strings of names, pedi- grees of the owners to 'Abbds the uncle of the Prophet or some other notable. If the native is asked the source of the genealogical frag- ment either he thinks that he found it among his father's papers* or ,sayS that it is an extract which was taken for him from a larger work owned by some “feki” In the latter case one's hopes are perhaps raised by a graphic description of an enormous tome, centuries old, said to have been composed “by el Samarkandi perchance; but God knows!” And one proceeds in search of the “ feki ” Then comes disillusionment. Sometimes the manuscript has been lost or burnt, or it has been lent to a relative at the other end of the country, or eaten by white ants. Sometimes the “feki” admits possession and with great care produces a few pages of genealogies obviously written within the last few decades. In this case one is generally referred for the original manuscript to some other “feki” who either lives beyond one's reach or died some years ago. In time, however, one does hear of some accessible “feki” whose manuscript has been the fans et origo of many of the ragged shreds in circulation and from him one learns that he or his father copied this “nisba” fifteen or twenty years ago, from the copy that was in possession of some other learned “feki” Occasionally one finds a “nisba” that is known to have been in the hands of the owner's family for several generations. An original author's manuscript a century or more old I have never seen, though such may possibly exist. vi INTRODUCTION The chief reason for this disappearance of documents is not so much the reluctance of the “fekis” to risk their possessions in alien hands, though this motive has to be combated where confidence has not been established, as the indubitable fact that both the Mahdi and the Khalifa, and especially the latter, gave stringent orders for the destruction of all modern books and documents 1 . The Mahdi feared that research might tend to invalidate his pretensions to be the Expected One, and the Khalifa, who was a Ta’aishi from Darfur, was only interested in genealogy to the extent of declining to appear less nobly born than his subjects. Consequently vast numbers of documents were deliberately burnt during the period of Dervish rule, many others were buried and so lost, or destroyed by white ants, and only a few survived to the present day. My first impression after examining a medley of these copies fragments and extracts was to the effect that they were worthless ; but a closer acquaintance shewed, on the one hand, that there were various scattered remarks and indications which had a certain value in themselves, and, on the other, that some passages recurred almost word for word in the majority of the longer “nisbas” and pointed to a common origin dating from about the sixteenth century. It also became more and more clear that, however faulty the details might be, the larger tribal genealogies, particularly those connected with the name of el Samarkandi, contained in the form of a genea- logical parable much valuable information concerning the inter- relation of the tribes of the Sudan. Even allowing that the intrinsic value of these documents is com- paratively small it is none the less true that anyone wishing to con- duct researches into the history or sociology of the country would have the unwelcome choice either of delaying his work to collect specimens of these manuscripts from all over the country, and then examining them for what they were worth, or of ignoring the docu- mentary evidence altogether. If he could afford the delay he would presumably choose the former alternative and would rapidly fin d himself sinking deeper and deeper into a morass of contradictions and inaccuracies from which a year or two of work would hardly serve to extricate him. To obviate the occurrence of this dilemma and * smooth a little the path of research, by collecting, comparing* and annotating such documents as I could find in the course, of my work 1 Cp., for the case of the Mahdi, Slatin Ch. vin. INTRODUCTION vii in various districts of the Sudan, was the object I set before myself in the first instance. If the zeal of a fool has outrun angelic discretion I can only hope that someone, with a more comprehensive grasp of the necessaiy scientific and historical material than I could ever pretend to, will be stimulated to undertake the task so imperfectly attempted in the following pages. The general plan adopted is as follows. The ethnological characteristics of the people who lived in the various quarters of the northern Sudan before the coming of the Muhammadans is first discussed in Part I, since it is to them that the non-Arab element in the population of the present day is chiefly due. The extent to which the institution of slavery has affected the racial type of the Sudan Arab is perforce ignored. Its consideration would have postulated a knowledge, which I do not possess, of half the negro races of Central Africa; and in the second place the fact that certain racial and cultural modifications have been caused by breed- ing from slave women, chiefly NOba, Dinica, Fur and FertIt, need only to be kept in mind throughout and their exact definition and classification is rendered less essential. Secondly, in Part II, an attempt is made to trace the earlier history of some of the more famous Arabian tribes of whom branches eventu- ally settled in the Sudan, and to accentuate the degree of racial con- nexion or distinction existing between them. A more general account of the fortunes of the Arabs in Egypt from the seventh to the fifteenth century, shewing some of the causes that led to their southward movements and the conditions that accompanied these, is given in a second chapter; and at the same time, where there are any data forthcoming, some note is taken of the course of events in the Sudan during the same period. Part III is occupied with a series of notes upon the history and composition of the Arab tribes now in the Sudan. Part IV opens with a chapter on the origin value and limitations of the native manuscripts. Then follow translations of thirty-two native manuscripts, with explanatory notes, appendices and genea- logical trees. It will be objected that some of them are worthless excerpts and might well have been omitted. Two considerations chiefly induced me to include them. In the first place this portion is intended to represent a small corpus of manuscripts typical of the country rather than a Golden Treasury of historical fact. In the second place it is instructive to note the extent to which variations M Q I 6 vm INTRODUCTION and coincidences respectively occur in the presentation of the same facts by a number of documents which for the most part are either copied one from the other or traceable to a single source. One not only learns something of the accuracy or inaccuracy of the particular facts stated — a small matter as a rule — but is also enabled to gauge more confidently the degree of reliability which is likely to attach to native manuscripts in general when circumstances do not admit of the application of the comparative test.

PART I THE INHABITANTS OF THE NORTHERN SUDAN BEFORE THE TIME OF THE ISLAMIC INVASIONS M, S, I. [ 3 ] CHAPTER 1 The Pre-Islamic Arabian Element I With the country which roughly speaking lies south of the twelfth parallel of latitude we are not here concerned as to all but a limited extent it falls outside the sphere of the Arab. Tribes of Arabs, it is true, pasture their herds at certain seasons south of this line, and in some cases cultivate: the Bakkara tribes of southern Kordofan and Darfur and the Selim BakkAra on the White Nile are the most notable examples of this : but allowing a few exceptions due to the suitability of the sub-tropical zone for cattle-breeding it is fairly accurate to say that the country south of the twelfth parallel is not yet arabicized in the sense that is true of the drier zones of country further north, where the Arab, or soi-discint Arab, is in undisputed possession. It is proposed in these first chapters to give some general idea of the ethnic characteristics of the people who inhabited this northern portion of the Sudan 1 before the period of Muhammadan immigration. * ' II ’Now, it is well to realize in advance, ^he fact that tlie Muham- madan settlement in the Sudan caused a profound mo31Hcation of the ‘'preexisting\" native stock is apt to obscure the other equally important fact that long before the Islamic period Arabian races had been crossing over into Egypt and the Sudan.} Let us then, as a first \"He^hTtK?“3iscussTdn \"of our subject, attempt to estimate the extent to which non-Muhammadan immigration to the Sudan took place from Arabia during this earlier period. Ill It would be a most surprising fact if the connection between the two sides of the Red Sea had not been intimate from the earliest dawn of history, for their inhabitants were to a large extent cognate races 2 and the passage was an easy one. ^Ix^miexchant^led the v^ay* From the most ancient times trade in aromatic gums, ivory and gold flourished between Arabia and the ports of Egypt, the Sudan and Abyssinia 3 . Settlements arose on the African coast and traders carried their wares at least as far as the 1 I limit the meaning of the term ** Sudan ” throughout to the country at present so called. This excludes Abyssinia and Eritrea. 2 Cp. Elliot Smith, Ancient Egyptians, p. 87. 3 See Periplus, Introduction and p. 60; Crowfoot, Journ . Roy . Geogr. Soc. May 1911, pp. 523, 534 1—2 THE PRE-ISLAMIC ARABIAN ELEMENT 1. 1. m 4 Nile. Of the Wddi Hamdmat route that runs east and west between, the Red Sea and the Thebaid Professor Elliot Smith says : From the records inscribed upon the rocks along this route we know that there was some traffic along it in the times of the fifth dynasty : but it is such an obvious means of access from the Nile to the sea that we cam be sure it must have been a trade route even in predynastic times, or at/ any rate a highway where the Arab and the Proto -Egyptian, met and inter- mingled. The widespread occurrence of marine shells, presumably from the shores of the Red Sea, in the predynastic graves of Upper Egypt and Nubia is positive evidence of the reality of such intercourse 1 . IV Some again have held that the conquering dynastic Egyptians who worshipped Horus were in fact Arabians who entered Africa by way of Massowa, and in the course of developing this theory Professor Navile 2 quotes the saying of Juba, recorded by Pliny, that the Egyptians were of Arabian origin, and “as for the neighbours of the Nile from Syene to Meroe, they are not Ethiopian nations but Arabs. Even the temple of the Sun, not far distant from Memphis, is said to have been founded by the Arabs 3 .' 3 Without going so far as this, one would allow that in early dynastic days Arabians did enter Egypt in large numbers by way of the Eritrean coast and settle there ; an cT in that case far more of them are likely to have settled nearer home and south of the Egyptian frontier, in the Sudan. V Some such movements are probably reflected in the ever recur- rent tradition that the early dynasties of Egypt were of Ethiopian origin. It is perhaps too often assumed that “Ethiopian” is neces- sarily the equivalent of “ negro. 3 * Certainly in the second millennium SX. south-west Arabia was beginning to colonize the highlands of Abyssinia, and those cross-currents of migration had begun to flow which reached their height during the hegemony of Md’in and Sdba - (c. 1500-300 b.c.) 4 . “ \" — — Throughout the whole of this period a large proportion of the world’s commerce passed by way of Abyssinia and the coast of the Red Sea to the Nile 5 , and the populations on either side of the straits of Bab el Mandeb became more and more assimilated to one another 6 . 1 Elliot Smith, loc. cit, p. 88, 2 Navile, Origin of Egyptian Civilization , Smithsonian Rep, 1907, pp. 549-564. 3 Pliny 3 Bk. vi, 34. 4 See Sir H.

Bent, p. 17 q). Li. IX. THE PRE-1SJLAMIC ARABIAN ELEMENT 5 VI Under the Ptolemies trade throve equally, and there is ample evidence of Arab trading-stations in the first and second centuries a.d, on the coast from Bab el Mandeb to the Gulf of Suez 1 . VII As regards early Arabian immigration by land to Egypt, there are some who, while rejecting the theory that the early dynasts came through Ethiopia, would yet bring them from Arabia into Egypt by way of the peninsula of Sinai 2 . This is very doubtful. The positive evidence, dating from the time of the earliest dynasties, does, how- ever, prove that the eastern side of the Delta was being perpetually harried by nomads from Sinai and Syria 3 , and there are numerous early reliefs shewing a Pharaoh smiting the Beduin, “the sand- dwellers 5 ’ of the mining regions of Sinai 4 . VIII During the twelfth dynasty, nearly 2000 years before the Christian era, the monuments prove that there was also trade with these Beduin. “The needs of the Semitic tribes of neighbouring Asia were already those of civilized people and gave ample occa- sion for trade 5 55 ; and hence the famous picture from the tomb of Khnumhotep II at Beni Hasan, in which is depicted the arrival of a band of Beduin traders 6 . The more amicable conditions now prevailing are also suggested by the wording of the Tale of Sinuhe’s flight to Palestine during the time of the same dynasty : I came to the Walls of the Ruler, made to repulse the Beduin. ..I went on... I fell down for thirst... I upheld my heart, I drew my limbs together, as I heard the sound of the lowing of cattle, I beheld the Beduin. That chief among them, who had been in Egypt, recognized me. He gave me water, he cooked for me milk. I went with him to his tribe, good was that which they did (for me) 7 . IX About 1657 B.c. occurred the Hyksos invasion of Egypt 8 . This people may have been Hittite or possibly Arabian by race: the evidence points to the former 9 , but we may assume in any case that Arabia sent its quota of Beduin in the wake of the invaders 10 and that during the Hyksos period and that succeeding it trade between east and west flourished to a larger extent than formerly. 1 See Periplus and Ptolemaeus, passim. 3 JS.g.

Their power received a check at the hands of Seti I (c. 1313- 1292), and they were also no doubt affected by the repulses inflicted by Rameses II (1292^1225) on the Hittites. By the time of Rameses’s death there were numbers of Arabians captured in war and enrolled as serfs in Egypt, or employed as mercenaries 4 . XI The power of Egypt then began to decline, and during the nineteenth, twentieth and twenty-first dynasties the Libyans so over- ran Egypt that by 950 B.c. they had gained the supreme power 6 . The presumption is that some of the eastern nomads, who were divided by no great racial gulf from the Libyans, took the oppor- tunity at the same time to settle with them in the Delta and inter- marry with them as they had probably already intermarried with the native Egyptians. XII In the Nubian period which followed, Assyria rose to the height of her power and subdued Egypt. Psammetichus I (663-609) was practically a vassal of that power in the early years of his reign ; but later, as Babylon supplanted Assyria, he asserted his indepen- dence and entered into widely ramifying foreign relations with the powers to the north and east; and his successors imitated his example. XIII Sixty years after the death of Psammetichus I Cyrus founded the Medo-Persian empire, and in 525 B.c. Cambyses, King of Persia, occupied Egypt. XIV The Arabs may have strengthened their footing in Egypt during the Assyrian and Babylonian periods. Herodotus 6 indeed speaks of Sennacherib as “King of the Arabians and Assyrians” 1 Breasted, Hist. pp. 244, 253 * 3 Breasted, A. R. m, 10, 11, 3 Breasted, Hist . pp. 263, 284, 285. 1 Ibid . pp. 254, 317, 318. 5 Ibid . pp. 298, 327, 328, 333 ff. ; and cp. A. R, m, 57 ° ; IV, 35? 83, 84. 8 Bk. n, 141. 1. 1 . xvii* THE PRE-ISLAMIC ARABIAN ELEMENT 7 and his army as “the Arabian host.” So, too, the Persian period lasted for about 200 years and presumably the settlements of Asiatics that now occurred included a proportion of Arabs. The presumption is made more certain by the fact that when Alexander the Great conquered Egypt in 332 B.c. he appointed Cleomenes of Naukratis to be governor of “Arabia about Heroopolis” with the title of “Arabarch,” and so important was this official's position that he was also responsible to Alexander for the whole tribute of Egypt 1 . XV In the reign of the first Ptolemy we hear of the Arabs providing great convoys of camels for the abortive invasion by Antigonus 2 , and no doubt they transported and raided both sides alternately through- out all the wars of the successive Ptolemies on the Syrian frontier; but to what extent they made any permanent settlement in Egypt during this period it is impossible to say. XVI Meanwhile let us hot forget the more continuous intercourse that was proceeding further south. Not only were trade relations maintained, but the Kahtdnites or Himyarites of southern Arabia were forming a definite link between the Arabs and the negro popu-; lation of Abyssinia 3 , and periodically invaded the Nile valley. We? need not pay much attention to the tale of Shedddd, a Himyarite t king of the 'Adites, who invaded Egypt in the days of Ashmun the great-grandson of Ham son of Noah, and built pyramids and reser- voirs before he was compelled to retreat 4 , but the tradition that one of the early kings of Yemen, 'Abd Shams Sabd, the founder of Mdrib, invaded Egypt 5 probably refers to an actual incursion from the south-east during the Nubian period. XVII More important matters were the expeditions of Abrdha “Dhu el Manar 6 ” and Afrikus. The former was born, according to Caussin de Perceval, about 134B.C., and was king of Yemen, and brother or son of el Sa'ab “Dhu el Karnayn” (“The two-horned”) 7 . He is said to have made 1 Mahaffy, History of Egypt , pp. 30, 31. a Mahaffy, loc. cit. 49. 3 Cp.

Abrdha’s son Afrikus, or Ibn Afriki, invaded v northern Africa probably about 46 b.c . 1 XVIII There are grounds for supposing that these invasions were followed by two distinct Himyaritic settlements in the interior of Africa. In the first place, numbers of them are said to have settled west of Egypt among the Libyan tribes and multiplied with these under the common name of Berbers : such is the origin assigned with very 1 reasonable probability to the Sanhaga and KetAma sections of the | Berber 2 . In this connection it may be noted that at the battle of ‘ Actium Arabs of the Yemen fought for Antony on the galleys of Cleopatra 3 . Secondly, it seems certain that colonies of Himyarites settled in Nubia, though it is hard to say whether the traces of Himyaritic catnayn 1 ( c h deux comes’), Les uns pr6tendent que c’est parce qu’il avait deux dminences sur la tfite, d’autres parce qu’il avait deux cornettes & sa couronne, d’autres parce qu’il avait deux longues tresses de chcveux pcndanles, d’autres parce qu’il subjugua l’univers, de l’Ouent rdel k 1 ’ Occident rdel, etc,.., La de- nomination d' ‘Alexandre aux deux cornea ’ est l’analoguo do celle de Jupiter Ammon.\" (Perron, ap. el Tflnisi, Voy. ait Ddrfour } pp. 456, 458.) 1 Caussin de Perceval (x, 70) points out that Caesar in 46 B.c. was opposed in Africa by the Numidians of Juba, z\\e, by the Libyo-Berbcr tribes, and that these latter were compelled to retreat before meeting Caesar because of an invasion of Juba’s state at the instigation of Caesar by a certain Sittius at the head of an army of adventurers. Sittius may be Afrikus, and the name Afrikus may have been merely conferred in honour of the expedition. Ibn Khaldun (1, 27) calls him \" ibn Satfi.” Concerning the expedition itself see Ibn Khaldun, I, 168-176 (citing Ibn el Kelbi) ;Pococke, Spec. Hist. Ar . p. 60 ; Abu el Field, pp . n6, H7 ; Caussin de Perceval, 1, 69 (citing the above and el Nuwayry’s Hist. Imp. Vet.

Ibn el Raldk ( q.v . ap, Carette, loc. cit. p. 49) says that the first people to inhabit Barbary were five colonies of Sabaeans under Ibn Afrfki, king of Yemen, and that they gave birth to 600 tribes of Berbers. These five colonies were taken to be the Sanhaga, Ma?muda, Zendta, Ghom&ra, and Howdra, Ibn Khaldun only allows the Himyaritic origin of the Sanhdga and the Ketdma. He says I Ob (ed. ar., vi, 97, Bit 111). He puts down the rest as related to the Philistines and descended from Canaan. Cp. also Ibn Ba$uta, II, 196. This traveller visited Zhafar, a month’s journey by land from Aden, and records the striking resemblance between the food, the | habits and the women’s proper names among the people there and among those I in the Moghrab. He says (‘‘This resemblance bears out the statement that Sanhdga and other tribes of the Moghrab are of Iiimyaritic origin.”) 3 Caussin de Perceval, loc. cit. p. 70, quoting Virgil, Aeneid t vni, 706. 1 1 . XX THE PRE-lSTAMlC ARABIAN EDEMEN V 9 influence which occur there, and which will be noticed later 1 , date in tl*e main from this or a later period. x/ At this period sun-worship was flourishing both in Southern Arabia and among the Himy antic colonists of northern Abyssinia 3 and the worship of the same deity that survived at Talmis (Kalabsha) until the time of Justinian 3 may well have formed a bond of sympathy between liimyarite and Nubian through the medium of Abyssinia and so have facilitated and encouraged intercourse between the two. Pliny, as we have already seen, even quotes Juba to the effect that the Nile dwellers from Aswan to Meroe were not Ethiopians but LArabians 4 — a statement which though obviously exaggerated may be ■'taken as containing at least some grain of truth. There is, too, a tradition 5 that Abu Malik, one of the last of the true Himyarite dynasty, made an expedition into the Bega country in quest of emeralds and there perished with most of his army. The event on which this tale is founded probably occurred during the early decades of the Christian period 6 . XIX In 25 b.c. Augustus, under the impression that the merchan- dize brought to the Red Sea ports by the Arabs was produced by Arabia, commissioned Aelius Gallus, the Prefect of Egypt, to conquer that country 7 . This expedition was a failure ; but about thirty years later, having learned that the most valuable merchandize brought by the Arabs came originally from India, and desiring a monopoly for ships from Egyptian ports, the Romans imposed a 25 per cent, import duty on goods from Arabian ports and destroyed Adane, the chief trading centre of them all 8 . For about two centuries Roman shipping was developed at the expense of the Arab 9 , but the old freedom of inter- course between the two coasts does not seem to have been checked | thereby, and by the time of Diocletian (284-305 a.d.) the Axumites ^of Abyssinia and the Himyarites of the Yemen had entirely regained ’the trade ascendancy 10 . XX These two peoples, closely connected by race, were now united by the bond of a common religion. Axum had been finally converted 1 See Index, sub “Himyar.” 2 Cp. Van Dyck, pp. 18 and 38 ; and see Part II, Chap. 2, xxvi. 0 Letronne, Materiaux.... 4 “ Quin et accolas Nili a Syene non Aethiopum populos sed Arab urn esse dicit usque Meroen.” Pliny, Bk vi, para. 34. Caussin de Perceval, I, 83; Van Dyck, p. 18. 6 Caussin de Perceval puts the date of Abu Malik’s birth in 31 a.d. 7 Milne, pp. 19, 20. 8 Ibid , p. 34. 0 Cp. Muir, Life of Mahomet, pp. lxxix, lxxx. He attributes to this cause the northward migration of the Kudd’a and Beni Axd. 10 Milne, p. 94. 10 THE PRE-ISLAMIC ARABIAN ELEMENT I, i. xx. to Christianity by Frumentius about 330 A.D., and the faith spread; very rapidly throughout Abyssinia 1 . The Yemen had been converted] half a century earlier and remained nominally Christian until about 500 a jd. when the king, Dhu Naw&s, a descendant of Abraha, adopted Judaism 2 . XXI Both Anastasius (491-518) and Justinus I (518-527) sent embassies to the Himyarites seeking their aid to check the increasing inroads of the Persians by an attack in the rear 3 ; but their plans were nullified by the trouble that had arisen between the Himyarites and the Axumites as a result of the persecution of Christians by Dhu Nawas. Elesbaan, king of Axum, invaded the Yemen and subdued] it about 52a a.d. 4 , and until about the end of the century it remained | subject to Abyssinia, though the actual administration remained in L the hands of the Himyarites. XXII The last of the Himyarite viceroys was S#yf } the son of Dhu Yazan and grandson of the Dhu Nawds mentioned above. This man, with the aid of the Persians, succeeded in driving most of the Abyssinians out of el Yemen and enslaving the rest. Some of these latter, however, murdered him about 608 A.D. and he was buried at Sana’a, The Persians then occupied the country until it was con- quered from them by the Muhammadans in 634*. Now, curiously enough, this Sayf ibn Dhu Yazan is fabled to have founded the kingdom of Kanem G . That he did not do so is quite certain, great traveller though he is related to have been in Arab tradition 7 . But during the tumultuous years which ushered in the seventh century in Arabia and immediately preceded Islam, there may have been, and probably was, some emigration from the Yemen to Africa, and it is not outside the bounds of possibility that some of these Himyarites penetrated to the far west, called themselves members of the royal family of el Yemen and were accepted as such by the ignorant natives 8 . 1 Letronne, loc. cit . 2 Van Dyck, pp. 20, 21. The legend that a Himyarite founded a dynasty in Bornu at the end of the sixth century (Nachtigal ap, Schurtz, loc. cit . pp. 534, 582) is curious but unsupported by evidence. 3 Milne, pp. 103, 104. 4 Procopius, De Bell. Pen, i, 19 (ap. Bent, p. 178). 5 Van Dyck, pp. 21-24, and Abu el Fidd, pp. 118, 119. 6 He appears under the names “Sayf ibn Dhu Yazan,” “Muhammad Sayf Ullah/* or “Sayf ibn Hasan.” See Carbou, 1, 4-7,, Barth, 11, 261, 263, 268, 269, 633* a ^d Nachtigal, 7 Abu el Fidd, loc . cit . 8 Cp. Carbou, loc. cit , and Barth, II, 269. I suppose Sultan Bello to refer to this movement when he speaks of certain Berber slaves and conscripts in el Yemen as rebelling against the Himyarites and being forced in consequence to emigrate tok the African coast. “They then went to Kanoom, and settled there, as strangers! under the government of the Tawarek, who were a tribe related to them, and called* 1 . i. XXV. THE PRE -ISLAMIC ARABIAN ELEMENT ii XXIII But to revert: the Persian armies were active in the sixth century a.d. in the north as well as in el Yemen, and their pressure on Egypt steadily increased until in 616 A.D. that country and Asia Minor had been wrested out of the hands of the Romans. The Persians themselves, as a race, had affinities with the Arme- noid invaders of an earlier date 1 , but among their number were members of many Syrian and Arab tribes 2 , and with these latter their congeners already settled in Egypt were no doubt in active sympathy 3 . f XXIV The rule of Persia in Egypt only lasted for ten years. They had lost the support of the Arabs as a result of the Islamic move- ment, and by 626 Heraclius had driven them out. But by now both Roman and Persian were enfeebled by con- tinuous warfare and the Arabs began to swarm over the frontiers of Egypt. For a while they were bought off by subsidies, but in 639 ’Amr ibn el ’Asi led his forces into the country, defeated the prefect Theodorus at Heliopolis, and drove the Romans back into the Delta. By 641 Babylon had fallen and Alexandria was besieged. Terms were then agreed upon, and in September 642, Alexandria was surrendered and Egypt passed under the domination of the Arabs. Their immediate success cannot be credited wholly to religious fervour. A proportion were no doubt inspired by the new faith, but many were with equal certainty animated by purely material con- siderations; and their task was the easier in that they were freeing from a foreign yoke a country in which numbers of the population already consisted of their own kith and kin, XXV We have thus seen that in pre-Islamic times there was a direct current of Arab immigration into Egypt, and most probably into Libya, through southern Syria, and a similar influx into the Sudan through Abyssinia, and a channel of trade from the mid- Red Sea coast to the Thebaid. It may therefore be regarded as more than probable that the ever-increasing infiltration of Arabs from these three directions, and their converging movements up and down the common highway of the Nile, whether in search of trade or pasture, had by the beginning of the seventh century led to the implanting at various points of a definite, if racially indeterminate, Arab strain in the population of the northern Sudan. Amakeetan, But they soon rebelled against them, and usurped the country.... Their government flourished for some time and their dominion extended to the very extremity of this tract of the earth; and Wadai and Bagharmee, as well as the country of Houssa. . .were in their possession.” (See Denham, Clapperton, and Oudney, II, 446, 447.) 1 Von Luschan, p. 244, 2 Butler, Arab Conquest , p. 81 note , 3 Milne, p. 114. [»] CHAPTER 2 The Nubians , the Nuba and the Libyan Element I The way has now been cleared for the discussion of the non- Arab races which the Islamic Arabs found in the Sudan. II All of these, with the exception of the nomad Bega in the eastern desert, were commonly included by the invaders under the vague denomination of Nuba. This term first occurs in literature in the geography of Eratosthenes 1 , who was born in 276 b.c. He speaks of “the Novftai..” Later the name occurs as NouySaSee, or in the Latinized form, of Nobatae. The ultimate derivation of the word is not known, but it appeats to be of very ancient origin and may be connected through the Coptiq NOTBT (meaning “to plait ”) with “ ?iebed the word used in the! inscription of Thothmes I (date c. 1540 b.c.) to denote “the plaited- haired ones/* or as it is perhaps with less accuracy translated “the curly-haired ones ” whom that monarch overthrew in the neighbour- hood of the third cataract: “He hath overthrown the chief of the ''Nubians 1 ; the Negro [nehesi] is help less.,.. There is not a remnant among the curly-haired, who came to attack him 2 ,” I imagine that the Arabs simply adopted the word which they found commonly used in Egypt to denote collectively the races living south of the first cataract 3 . With ethnological differentiation they 1 Ap. Strabo, Bk. xvn, ed. Casaubon, p. 786, 2 Breasted, At R . ir, 71, and Seligman, Joum. Anthr . Inst, xliu, 1913, pp. 6x6, 61 S. The latter says, “With regard to the word in the inscription of Thothmes I rendered f the curly-haired,’ i,e. as a synonym of ‘Negro’ (nehesi), written earlier in the inscription... it is necessary to exercise a certain amount of caution, for Miss Murray points out that this word reads Nebed, and is determined by a lock of hair, i,e, ‘the curly-haired’ stands for ‘ the nebed- haired.’ But ‘ nebed / according to Brugsch, does not mean * curly,’ but is the equivalent of the French tresser , natter , entrelacer , and is akin to the Coptic NOTBT = plectere , intexere ” Seligman does not, however, allude to the possibility of any connection between NOTBT and “ Nuba The word “ Nuba ” is sometimes derived from t( nubuy the word used for “ gold” in, e.g the inscription of Amenemhet (Ameni) in the time of the twelfth dynasty (see Breasted, A, R, i, 520). Gold and slaves have been the chief attraction of the Sudan in all ages. (Cp, Budge, 1, 534, 541.) 3 Elliot Smith says: “We are not justified in calling both the early and the late inhabitants of Nubia 4 Nubians ’ ; in fact, it is very doubtful whether we ought to apply the name to the pre-Hellenic population of the Nile valley between Asw^n and Meroe (Arch, Surv. Nub. Bull, ii, Cairo, 1908). R. Lepsius speaks of the probably incorrect extension of the name “Nuba” to all lands out of which slaves were brought to the north (Nubische Grammatik). 1 . 3 . 17 . 13 were little concerned, and until late years that subject remained sufficiently obscure. The Present Inhabitants of Nubia III At the present day the inhabitants of Nubia, which may be taken as extending along the Nile banks from Asw&n as far south approximately as the eighteenth parallel, to the vicinity, that is, of Debba and Korti 1 , are commonly known to the north as BarAbra (“ Berberines ”) and to the south as Danagla, ue> inhabitants of Dongola 2 . The term “BarAbra” is used to include the Kanuz between Aswdn and Korosko, a people whom we shall see to be an element distinct, the “Nuba” round Haifa, the Sukkot, the Mahass proper, and frequently the Danagla. The DanAgla extend as far north only as the vicinity of Arko Island and do not admit that they are BarAbra. Physically and linguistically the Sukic6t and Mahass fall into a single group and are distinct from the Kanuz and DanAgla. The two latter, however, bear obvious resemblances to one another and their lan- guages are similar. This curious fact is due without doubt to the geographical peculiarities of the Nile valley between Korosko and Dongola, the effect of which is to leave the Mahass and Sukk6t more or less isolated 3 . IV All these people are Muhammadans and have Arab blood in their veins, but racial characteristics derived from non- Arab ancestors have survived very persistently, and more noticeably so among the Mahass and Suick6t. The KanBz and DanAgla approximate very much more to the Arab type. At the same time, the importation of slave women from the south, which has proceeded uninterruptedly for centuries, has lent a further measure of spurious homogeneity to all of these Nubian peoples 4 . 1 The southern limit of “ Kush” under the Pharaohs of the eighteenth dynasty was practically the same, viz. Napata (Breasted, A. R. II, ioso), 2 “Danagla,” or more correctly “Dandkla” is the plural of “Dongoldwi” or “Donkolawi.” There is probably a connection between “Dandkla” and the “ Danakil” of the northern Somali coast (see Johnston, The Nile Quest> pp. 34-42). 3 Cp. Beckett, Cairo Sc. Journ. Aug. 1911; Burckhardt, Nubia , pp. 25, 26; and Anglo-Eg. Sudan , I, 83, where the term Bardbra is used to include the Dandgla. Burckhardt iloc. cit.) says: “The inhabitants of Nouba, and Wady Kenous, as far as Dongola, are known in Egypt under the name of Berdbera (sing. Berbery) ; but that appellation is seldom made use of by the inhabitants themselves, when speaking of their own nation.” As usual, he is accurate. By “Mahass proper” are meant the Mahass of Mahass district as distinct from the Mahass settled, e,g. on the Blue Niie. 4 Cp. Schweinfurth, 11, 194. I. 2 . V. 14 THE NUBIANS, THE NtfBA V As regards the BarAbra as a whole one thing is quite certain: there are no grounds for closely connecting them as a race with the Nuba of southern Kordofan as Riippell, Rossi and Keane did 1 . They are very similar in type to the Middle Nubians who lived between 3000 and 4000 years ago in the same locality, but these had no more racial affinity with the southern Nuba than the BarAbra-DanAgla have, and the latter are almost the complete antithesis of the southern NtJBA both physically and culturally 2 . It may be the case, and probably is, that the southern Nuba are to some extent the modern representatives of the race of negroes who temporarily held Dongola and the cataract country south of Haifa in the days of the Middle Kingdom and early Empire and whose congeners, no doubt at a later date, formed part of the forces of the Ethiopian dynasty that conquered Egypt and ruled it for something less than a century, but these negroes were aliens in the northern Sudan and most of them were forced back to the south, and their place in Lower Nubia was taken by its original inhabitants and settlers from Egypt. In the Dodekaschoinos 3 it is probable that the negroes had hardly displaced the original inhabitants, but south of Haifa they must have done so temporarily and to some extent modified the racial type in the process. But, even so, allowing for periods of interruption, it is true to say that from the time of the Middle Empire (2000-1600 b.g.) and onwards for centuries, and throughout the Meroitic, Ptolemaic and classical periods, and again in the years preceding the decisive Arab conquest of the Sudan, a strong infiltration of the Egyptian and, later, of the Egypto-Arab type was steadily and almost un- interruptedly proceeding in the northern Sudan and the negro element was correspondingly decreasing in that region. VI It will be seen too that this prolonged infiltration to the south was more than the return of an ancient population, reinforced by fresh blood, to its quondam home on the river. When once the Arabs had overthrown the Christian kingdom of Dongola and established themselves in its place, they rapidly amalgamated with the local Nubians and began to send colonies further afield. Thus it came about that BarAbra, with an Arab leaven, pene- trated into Kordofan and settled round about the most northernly of the Nuba mountains and intermarried with the negroes who were 1 See Seligman, Joum . Anthr. Inst. 1913, xliii, 6io, and Beckett, loc . cit. pp. 200 fL For Keane, see Man; Past and Present , p. 75, 2 Seligman, loc. cit. 3 See Part II, Chap, 2, xxxix. I. 2 . VIII, AND THE LIBYAN ELEMENT i5 probably descendants of the erstwhile conquerors of Nubia 1 . The immigrating race, in addition, imposed its own language upon the blacks in their vicinity, and thus are explainable the linguistic affinities which have troubled so many generations of investigators.' The Barabra, in short, do not speak a language akin to that of the northern Nuba of southern Kordofan because the negroes conquered Nubia, — the negroes probably spoke some language or languages of their own that may still survive in the mountain fastnesses of the far south, — but because the Barabra colonized the country round the foot of the northern hills of Dar Nuba. The conclusion, however, has here anticipated the argument and avc must revert. The Earliest Inhabitants of Nubia VII As regards the earliest period it has been proved that those shadowy inhabitants of northern Nubia, who are known to archae- ologists as “Group A,” were contemporaries of the pre-dynastic Egyptians, that both buried their dead in the same way and that in cultural matters there were marked similarities. The two peoples must have been practically uniform 2 , and their stock may have extended in a more or less diluted form from Egypt to the Bluei Nile and Abyssinia 3 . They were a “ small, dark-haired, black-eyed,' glabrous people” bearing a close resemblance to the Libyans of the southern Mediterranean seaboard, and were, in the earliest period of all, devoid of all negro characteristics 4 . The First Arrival of the Negroes VIII Later, about the time of the third dynasty, negro types began to settle in Nubia as far north as Aswin, and from now onwards “the population that grew up was a mixture of early Nubian and dynastic Egyptian with an ever increasing Negro element 5 .” (a) The Bahr el Ghastal Type These negroes were for the most part “short and relatively broad- headed,” of a type akin to that found at the present day in the south 1 Further evidence on this subject will be found in Part III, Chap, i, where details of the Bedayrfa and other Dandgla tribes are given. 2 Elliot Smith, Ancient Egyptians , p. 66, and in Arch. Sum. Nubia, Report for 1907-8, ii, Chap. II; Reisner, Sudan Notes and Records , Jan. 1918, p. 7. 3 Elliot Smith, Ancient Egyptians, pp. 78, 79. Of this stock he also says (p. 54) : ‘There is a considerable mass of evidence to shew that there was a very close resemblance between the proto -Egyptians and the Arabs before either became intermingled with Armenoid racial elements. ** 4 Elliot Smith, Cairo Sdent. Jonrn. March 1909, pp. 56, 57. 6 Seligman, loc. cit. p. 614. I. 2 . VIII. 16 THE NUBIANS, THE NUBA of the Bahr el Ghazni province, and entirely distinct from the in- vaders of the Empire period. (/?) The Nilotic Type The tall Nilotes, Shilluk, Dinka and Nuer of the White Nile valley, who now intervene between the Bahr el Ghazni and Nubia, and are dissimilar to either group and display certain Bantu affinities, could not at the time of the earlier (Bahr el Ghaz&l) invasion have yet occupied their present position 1 . It is likely that they arrived there during the second millennium B.C., or later. The “C Group ” in Lower Nubia IX By the time of the twelfth dynasty the fusion of races in Lower Nubia had resulted in the production of the singularly homogeneous blend of traits which distinguish the people of the Middle Empire, that is, dynasties twelve to seventeen, or “C Group”; the very type which in a modified form is represented in the same locality^ by the Barabra of the present day. By the same date the population further south must have become almost exclusively negro (; nehes ). Early Libyan Influences in Nubia X Concurrently with the early negro infusion into Nubia further racial modification was probably being caused by the settlement on the Nile of Libyans ( Temehu ) from the western oases and the steppes of northern Kordofan. In the time of the sixth dynasty, about 2750 B.C., Harkhuf, the Governor of the district round Aswan,, went to Yam, i.e. Lower Nubia on the west side 2 , and, he says, “I found the chief of Yarri going to the land of Temeh to smite Temeh as far as the westernl corner of heaven. I went forth after him to the land of Temeh and I pacified him... 3 .” Harkhuf then went southwards through Upper Nubia, crossed over to the east bank, and returned downstream to Egypt bringing with him incense, ebony, oil, grain, panther-skins, ivory and throwing-sticks 4 . The advocates of the Libyan theory find here evidence that the Libyans ( Temehu ) lived between the first and second cataracts, but as Giuffrida-Ruggeri remarks 6 , “ there is still the possibility suggested by Hrdlicka 6 that these Temehu lived... on the oases of Kharga and Dakhla, which are in the Libyan desert...,” 1 Seligman, loc . cit. p. 634. 2 Seligman, loc. cit. p. 613 note. 3 Breasted, A. R. 1, 335. 4 Ibid. p. 336, and Seligman, loc. cit. s Loc . cit. p. 54. 6 The Natives of Kharga Oasis, Egypt , Smithsonian Misc. Collections, ux, No. 1, p. 5, Washington, 1013. I. 2 . XII. AND THE LIBYAN ELEMENT i7 Budge 1 thinks from the list of products brought back by Harkhuf that he probably penetrated Kordofdn and Ddrfur via the oases of Kurkur and Selfma ; and Professor Navile 2 accepts the inscription of Harkhuf as proof that the Libyo-Berbers were occupying Kordofan and Dirfur and possibly Borku. The negroes, he thinks, must have ousted them at a later date. Reisner thinks Harkhuf followed the river and doubts if he pene- trated as far as Sennar. The products brought back, he points out, might have been obtained in trade anywhere between Dongola and Sennar, whatever their ultimate origin 3 . However, as large and wealthy Arab tribes have chosen to live in the Bayuda desert for centuries it is also likely in any case that races of similar habits and inclinations occupied it before them. That the earliest of such to do so were of Libyan origin appears to be sufficiently established, but the extent, if any, to which these races settled on the Nile and mixed with the Nubian population of the Middle Nubian period is still undetermined 4 . XI The Middle Nubian stock was also mixed, it is probable, with another strain, that of the red-skinned Bega from the eastern deserts 6 . But in the main, from Assuan for some distance south of Haifa, it was negroid, though certainly not true negro 6 . Nubia in the Time of the Twelfth Dynasty XII During the time of the great kings of the twelfth dynasty (2000-1788 B.c.) events of great importance occurred in the northern Sudan 7 . At least three serious military campaigns were carried out, by Amenemhat I (1971), by Sesostris I (1962) and by Sesostris III (1879). In connection with these a series of forts and garrisons was established from the Egyptian frontier as far as the lower end of the present Dongola Province, and at several of these, notably at Semna and Kerma (Inebuw- Amenemhat), regular colonies of Egyptians were founded. During this period the district between Aswan and Semna became populous and prosperous. Every lateral valley had its village or group of huts. Every square meter of alluvial soil appears to have been cultivated. The people were 1 i, 512. 2 Smithsonian Rep. 1907, pp. 549-64. 3 See Sudan Notes and Records } Jan. 1918, p. 13. 4 Bates ( The Eastern Libyans) would go so far as to class the Middle Nubians as a race with the Libyans rather than with the Negroes. GiuffridaTRuggefi combats-j this theory in Man , April 1915. The question of Berber influences in the western desert at a later date occurs again later in this chapter. ' 5 Seligman, loc. cit, p. 619. A discussion of the ethnic place of the Bega follows in Chap. 3. 6 Reisner, loc . cit. pp. 13, 13. 7 For the following see Reisner in Sudan Notes and Records , April 1918. w s. x I. 2. XII. 18 THE NUBIANS, THE NUBA Nubians, perhaps descended in part from the harried population of the Old Empire, but increased by immigrants from the more exposed districts south of Semna. Culturally they were still in an uncivilized state, nearly neolithic. They were sowers and herdsmen, hunters and fishermen. The only crafts were pot-making, cloth and mat -weaving, and basket -making, — all carried out by hand with the simplest of tools. South of Semna, of course, conditions were far less settled and periodical punitive expeditions were necessary. The expedition of Sesostris I appears, however, to have resulted in the “thorough subjugation of the country, certainly as far as the upstream end of Dongola Province, and perhaps well into Berber > Province.” The year 1962 marks the first real conquest of the north - 1 central Sudan. The fort at Kerma was enlarged and the settlement * increased, and the result has been shewn by Reisner’s recent excava- tions. These prove that a “special local civilization, a curious modi\" 1 fication of the culture of Egypt, deeply affected by local forms, 1 materials and customs/’ was developed and throve. About 1879, however, Amenemhat’s fort was sacked as the result of a rising or invasion from the south. Sesostris III at once led an army into the I Sudan and crushed the rebels and set up the famous stela at Semna, 1 37 miles south of Haifa, inscribed with the order forbidding the negroes” to pass downstream beyond it for ever 1 . From his time' until the New Empire no mention of Nubia is found in the Egyptian inscriptions, but its occupation certainly continued and one infers that local conditions were more or less settled. Kerma had been restored and made the administrative centre of a province, but it seems that about 1600 b.c. it was burnt out and never rebuilt. Nubia in the Time of the Eighteenth Dynasty. Its Egyptianization XIII The Egyptianization of the northern Sudan was proceeding steadily in the time of Ahmose (Ahmes) I, the founder of the eighteenth dynasty (c. 1580-1350 b.c. 3 ) and under his successors. Ahmose I placed Lower Nubia (“Wawat”) under an Egyptian Governor, and his successor, Amenhotep (Amenophis) I, appointed in 1548 the first of a long line of Egyptian viceroys, who ruled Ethiopia during the eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties. In the following reign, that of Thothmes I, occurred the serious revolt and its suppression to which reference has already been made. ^ 1 See Breasted, A. R. I, 652. ' 1 For the following, to the close of the quotation ending “...kings of Ethiopia/* see Reisner in Sudan Notes and Records , Oct, 1918. I. 2. XIII. AND THE LIBYAN ELEMENT i9 By the time of Thothmes III the northern Sudan was adminis- tered by two sub-governors, one for Kush (the south) and one for Wawat (the north). Mines were worked by the Government, taxes were collected, and considerable trade was developed with the out- districts. In fact, from 1548 B.c. to about 1090, for some 558 years that is, Ethiopia was governed by Egyptian officials and paid tribute to Egypt..., The Egyptians followed up their military and political occupation by filling the land with Egyptians, — soldiers, officials, priests, merchants, and crafts- men. Southwards of Phile, temples were made, decorated, and maintained at Kalabsha, Gerf Husein, Kubban, Es-Sebua, Amada, Derr, Ibrim, Abu Simbel, Haifa (Buhen), Semneh, Soleb, Delgo (Sesi), Kawa, Gebel Barkal, and other places. Each of these was a centre of propaganda, a community of scribes learned in Egyptian medicine, law, and religion, and of artizans trained in every ancient craft.... The better agricultural areas at least as far south as Semneh weie assigned to the support of the temples and turned over to immigrants from Egypt and their descendants for cultivation.... The viceroy himself with his personal staff probably shifted his quarters from el-Kab or Elephantine to Semneh or Napata as the season or the necessities of the administration made it seem advisable.... Most of the Egyptians were permanently domiciled in the country and had brought their families with them. The decimated tribes grew into a completely submissive population, were racially affected by intermarriage with the ruling class, and became more or less Egyptianized. The country, as a whole, was thoroughly Egyptianized, especially in religion. The names of the local gods were remembered, and all the gods of the Egyptian pantheon were called upon in their special functions, but the great god was Amon- Ra, the god of the Theban family who had conquered so much of the world..,. He dwelt in the midst of the “Holy Mount ” which we now call Gebel Barkal, and in the days to come his oracles were to decide the fates of even the kings of Ethiopia. Now there are no pictorial representations of Nubians dating from any dynasty earlier than the eighteenth, but it has been sug- gested as curious 1 that from then until the time of the twentieth dynasty — at a time, that is, when we know the Middle Nubian popu- lation to have been physically similar to that of the present day — the Nubians who were conquered by the great kings of the New Empire, and who were probably the same people as those whose boundaries Senusert (Sesostris) III some three centuries before had fixed at Semna, are habitually represented as “full-blooded Negroes with coarse negro features.” This, however, would appear to be perfectly natural. The negroes living south of the second cataract and in the country beyond used to raid periodically to the north of 1 Seligman, he, tit, p. 617. 20 THE NUBIANS, THE NtfBA 1 . 2, xm. it. Senusert III repelled them 1 and fixed their boundary above Haifa. Later, the negroes — no doubt the same ones— gave further trouble, and Thothmes I defeated them even more completely and forced them back to the third cataract. It seems probable that it is these negro invaders who are depicted from the eighteenth to the twentieth dynasty, and not the more permanent and rightful inhabi- tants of Lower Nubia. Discussion of the Negro Type found in Nubia under the TWELFTH AND EIGHTEENTH DYNASTIES. THE KoRDOfAn TYPE? XIV There is some reason to think that these negroes whom Senusert III defeated and forbade to pass north of Haifa, the “ plaited-haired ones’’ with whom Thothmes I later warred farther to the south, the men depicted as tall, coarse, full-blooded negroes, were probably akin to the tall mesaticephalous type that now survives in southern KordofAn and whose remains, dating from the time of the twenty-fifth dynasty (Taharka, Tanutamon, etc.) and earlier, have lately been found at Gebel Moya and other hills in the Gezfra 2 . They no doubt followed the Nile in their northward movement, impelled perhaps by the Nilotic stock behind them, but it is as well to bear in mind the possibility that some of them also came overland through Kordofan by way of the WAdi el Mukaddam 3 . XV It is to this type, the u ncbed that the name Nuba is, 1 sug- gest, most properly applied, and it is a noticeable fact that the Arab of the present day hardly ever speaks of the Nilotic negro of the south by that name; he instinctively reserves it, on the other hand, (<3) for the big black of southern KordofAn, (b) the hybrid race living 1 See above, and Breasted, A. R. i, 640. 2 Dr Derry, who examined the burial sites at G. Moya, and Prof. Seligman who has closely studied the Nuba of southern Kordofan, agree as to the close resemblance between the early Ptolemaic negro of the Gezfra and the present type in southern Kordofan (see Seligman, loc> cit, p. 625). “The cemeteries of this site [G. Moya] have yielded the remains of a tall coarsely built Negro or Negroid race with extraordinarily massive skulls and jaws. In a general way they appear to resemble the coarser type of Nuba living in south Kordofan at the present day, and it is significant that the cranial indices of the men of Jebel Moya and the Nuba hills agree closely.” (Seligman, Address to the Anthrop. Section of the Brit. Assoc, for the Advancement of Science, Report , 1915, p. g.) Of the physical characteristics of the Nuba of southern Kordofdn Prof. Seligman says: “They are a tall, stoutly-built, muscular people, with a dark, almost black skin. They are predominantly mesaticephalic, . .nearly 60 per cent, of the individuals measured are mesaticephals, the remainder being dolicocephalic and brachicephalic in about equal proportions.” (“The Physical Characters of the Nuba of Kordofan,” R. A . I. XL, 1910.) For Reisner’s remarks on the excavations at Gebel Moya see Sudan Notes and Records , Jan. 1919, p. 65. 3 See later in this chapter. X. 2 . XVI. AND THE LIBYAN ELEMENT 21 at el Haraza, Kaga, and other hills in the north of Kordofdn, and (c) to denote the aborigines extirpated by the Fung at the beginning of the sixteenth century in the Gezira and the neighbourhood of the Shabluka cataract. In the form “ Nubia,” however, the name came to be applied not to the country whence these negroes came but to the scene of their greatest triumphs, the valley of the Nile between the first cataract and Napata. Nay more, by the irony of fate, although the northern portion of this same country throughout the early and the later dynastic, the Ptolemaic, and Roman periods, and again in the time of the Mamluks, was considered almost an annex of Egypt and was largely populated by Egyptian colonies, the use of the name “Nubia ” was tending more and more to be restricted to it rather than to the southern portion, and we shall see that by the time of Ibn Selim in the latter part of the tenth century it was not uncommon to regard it as applying par excellence to that most northernly district of the Sudan commonly called Maris, which ended some way north of the second cataract 1 . The Libyo-Egyftian period in Nubia and the Nubian Conquest of Egypt XVI About 945 b.c. the Libyans, who in the course of centuries had obtained a strong footing in Lower Egypt and the Delta and became partly Egyptianized, seized the throne of the Pharaohs and founded the twenty-second dynasty 2 . Plow this affected the Sudan immediately we do not know, but in the records of 750 b.c. the northern Sudan appears “no longer as a province of Egypt but as the seat of an independent monarchy of which the Thebaid was the northern province,” and Reisner thinks it likely that, as the Libyan i kings subsequently weakened and power became decentralized^ Kashta, the Libyan (?) representative commanding in the northern Sudan and a member of the royal family, assumed independence. He even, it appears, invaded Egypt and established his supremacy as far north as Thebes. His capital was at Napata (Gebel Barkal), and we may assume that though he and his staff may have been Egypto-Libyans, the mass of his subjects were Nubians of the present darker type in the north and negroes or semi-negroes in the south. 1 Cp. Budge, i, 651, and II, 105; also Letronne, loc. cit. Evidence of the con- sistency with which this tract south of Aswan was considered an annex of Egypt will be adduced later (see Part II, Chap. 2). 2 For the followingsee Reisner in Sudan Notes and Records fax Jan. and Oct. 1019 . I. 2 . XVII, THE NtJBIANS, THE NtJBA XVII Kashta was succeeded by his son Piankhi (744-710 b.c. 1 ). This king took further advantage of the decadence that had over- taken Egypt and completed the work begun by his father in over- running the whole country and making it tributary to him. XVIII Piankhi was succeeded about 710 B.C. by his brother Shabaka. This monarch, not content with merely receiving tribute, firmly established his authority over the whole of Egypt. He was followed by Shabataka 2 , and the latter, about 688 b.c., by Taharka (a son of Piankhi), who in the reign of Shabaka had commanded the Ethiopian army that was sent to Palestine to assist Hezekiah against the Assyrians of Sennacherib, who were now approaching the eastern borders of Egypt, The Assyrian Danger XIX Taharka’s main preoccupation throughout his reign was to stem the tide of this Assyrian invasion. But he was unsuccessful, and in 670 e.c. Esarhaddon forced his way to the Egyptian frontier and heavily defeated him. Taharka retired southwards leaving the Delta and Memphis in the hands of the Assyrians 3 . Esarhaddon, however, did not press his success, and as he with- drew northwards Taharka reoccupied Memphis and renewed his intrigues with the Palestinian kings. XX On the death of Esarhaddon in 668, his son Ashurbanipal continued the fresh campaign that had been started against Taharka and achieved a decisive victory in the eastern Delta. Taharka again retired southwards. The Assyrians followed and occupied Thebes, reinstated the Libyo-Egyptian dynasts as Governors in Egypt and left garrisons, Ashurbanipal himself then returned with his spoil to Nineveh. Shortly afterwards Taharka died 4 . XXI Tanutamon, a son of Shabaka (who had married Taharka’s 1 The dates given for the twenty-fifth dynasty are as amended by Reisner in Oct, 1919. 2 Manetho makes him son of Shabaka, but Breasted (Hist, p. 377) thinks this a little doubtful. Piankhi, Shabaka and Shabataka, it may be noted, were all buried at Gebel Kurru near Barkal (Reisner, Sudan Notes and Records, Oct. 1919). 3 Breasted (loc, cit , p. 378) says of Taharka: “His features as preserved in con- temporary sculptures shew unmistakeably negroid characteristics.” Reisner, on the contrary (Sa dan Notes and Records Jan. 19 19, p. 50), says that though the Assyrian king chose to represent Taharka as a negro, he “was not a negro, for the statues of both himself and his descendants shew features which might be Egyptian or Libyan but certainly not negro.” * He was the founder of the great royal cemeteries of Ethiopia at Nuri, near I. % XXIII. AND THE LIBYAN ELEMENT 23 sister 1 ), the last king of the twenty-fifth dynasty, came to the throne in 663 B.c,, and, though in name he ruled over both Egypt and the Sudan 2 , in fact the only result of his attempts to recover Lower Egypt was that he was driven back and Thebes was sacked by the Assyrians. By 654 b.c. Tanutamon was dead and buried with his great fore- fathers Piankhi, Shabaka and Shabataka near Gebel Barkal, and the power of the Sudan over Egypt had come utterly to an end. The Meroitic Period and after XXII On the final separation of Ethiopia from Egypt Psammetichus (Psamtik) I, who had been installed by the Assyrians as King of Sais and Memphis and become founder of the twenty-sixth Egyptian dynasty, did not concern himself greatly with the Sudan, The rulers of that country, too, turned their attention southwards and the province of Meroe was consolidated and developed near the junction of the Atbara and the Nile 3 . It was made an integral part of Ethiopia as Ethiopia had been of Egypt. Meroe was Elhiopianized, that is, brought under the influence of the Egyptian culture which had been inherited from the days of the viceroys. But this Egypto- Ethiopian, culture... was certainly greatly diluted by its extension to Meroe, Meroe was Ethiopianized, not Egyptianized. About 440 b.c., as Reisner believes, and certainly before 350 b.c. : Meroe had in its turn absorbed Ethiopia itself, just as Ethiopia, three centuries before, had absorbed its mother country Egypt. The degeneration of the culture became more rapid.,. even the race was changing. The Egyptian element was being overborne by others, Libyan, Nubian, negro, or whatever it may have been. The fine traits of the educated and skilled Egyptian were visibly fading into the coarse features of a negroid race which may have been slow at forgetting but was incapable of giving a creative impulse to art, learning, or religion. XXIII We now have, as a result of Reisneris work at Nuri and the vicinity, an almost complete list of the kings that followed Tanutamon, but there is no point in recording them here. More important is the fact that certainly by the time of Nastasenen (Nastasen), who reigned from 298-278 B.c. , and probably by about 440 b.c., the political capital was at Meroe while the religious capital remained at Napata. The temples of Napata with their endowed bodies of priests and crafts- men educated in the learning of Egypt remained the cultural centre of the 1 Breasted, A. R .

For further details as to Meroe and for the settlement of the Automoloi in the south see the following chapter. 24 THE NUBIANS, THE NUBA LaxxuL kingdom, while Meroe became the centre of material wealth and political power.... It was not until a generation or so after the death of Nastasen that the rulers of Meroe introduced a revival of learning and art under the influence of Ptolemaic Egypt and made their capital for the first time the cultural centre of Ethiopia. XXIV Some further remarks on Meroe and its people will be attempted in the next chapter, but, before leaving the subject of the inhabitants of Nubia proper, we must first turn to the classical geographers of the Ptolemaic period, since they provide certain items of information that are of value. XXV We have seen that it was Eratosthenes who first used the term N ovftai in the third century b.c. As quoted by Strabo he says : On the left side of the course of the Nile live the Noubai, in Libya, a great race, beginning from Meroe and extending as far as the bends [of the river] . They are not subject to the Ethiopians but live independently, being divided into several sovereignties 1 . Agathemerus (third century a.d.) in a bald list of African races includes NoS/Sot (sic) on either side of the Nile 2 . Pliny says: “The island of the Semberritae on the Nile obeys a queen. Eight days journey further [north] are the Ethiopian Nubei. Their city of Tenupsis is on the Nile 3 .” Ptolemaeus simply mentions a number of Ethiopian tribes with outlandish names, but contributes nothing definite to our knowledge of them beyond that they lived on the Nile, in the Island of Meroe and beyond, and in the western steppes 4 . Procopius 5 says of Elephantine (Aswan) in the latter half of the sixth century, “There live, besides many other races, the very large tribes of Blemyes and Nobatae. The former occupy the interior of the country and the latter reside in the Nile valley } ; and relates that 1 <!£ aptcrrepCov 8£ rr}s j&tf trews too NdXou iToujScu kcltoikoG<tlp iv rjf AijSify, p,4ya tTdpos, &7 ro tt] 5 Mepby s &p%&jjl€POl y.k xpt T&P aytcwrcov, oi>x v'rroTo.rrbfxevoL rots 'AlOidpiv, a\\ Idlq, Kai ( ?) t\\€Lol$ fiao-thdcus dLeL\\7}^jj.^uoc, Strabo, ed.

Pliny also calls some tribe in Syria by the same name of Nubei. \"Nec non in media Syriae ad Libanum montem penetrantibus Nubeis, quibus junguntur Ramish Deinde Tatanei, deinde Patami.” (Bk. vi, § 33.) 4 Ed.

I. 2, XXVII. AND THE LIBYAN ELEMENT 25 Diocletian (284-305 a,d.) as well as pa}dng to both tribes a sort of Dane-geld, gave the Nobatae a tract on the Nile banks and entrusted to them the care of the Dodekaschoinos, the district south of Aswdn 1 . XXVI In The Egyptian Sudan Budge speaks 2 of these Nobatae or Nuba as “a powerful tribe of nomads who lived in the Western Desert” and adds “The Nobatae appear to have come originally from Dar Fur and Kordofan and in Diocletian’s time their settle- ments extended to the oasis of Kharga.” Again he says 3 “The people who lived in the deserts on the west of the Nile, . .were known to classical writers as f Nubae/ or Nubians, and ‘Nobadae’ or 'Nobatae/ In Roman times the Nubians consisted of a league of the great tribes of the Western Desert 4 .” The statement that the settlements of the Nuba extended to the oases of Kharga rests on the remark of Procopius 5 to the effect that the Nobatae who were settled by DiocletiarfEetween Egypt and the iBlemyes had originally lived “about the city oasis” (i.e. Kharga). A It has been objected 6 that the inhabitants of the oases were un- doubtedly of a Libyan stock, and that the Nobatae were essentially a Nilotic race and could not have been so far north, and that therefore Procopius was at fault. But this is a very risky line of argument: there is no proof that the Nobatae were essentially Nilotic, and there ^is a quite definite probability that the Libyan races, the ancient ITemehu, and the Nobatae, whether on the river or west of it, had y commingled. Throughout history the nomads of the west, Libyans 1 or Berbers, have maintained an intimate connection with the dwellers in the Nile valley; and there may have been both Libyans and Nobatae at Kharga, or a mixture of the two. XXVII As regards the religion of these Nubians the evidence is very slight. In 452 A.D., Priscus tells us 7 , a peace was made between Maximin, the Roman general, and the Blemyes and, Nubians, and one clause of it stipulated that the Romans should allow the others, ; according to their ancient custom, to make a journey to Philae and) visit the temple of Isis and take thence the statue of the goddess and J bring it back after a certain time. But Christianity had by now begun to find converts in Nubia. 1 See Evetts, p. 260. 2 II, 176. 3 n, 417. 1 In these quotations Budge seems to press somewhat ahead of the evidence. To what extent I agree with him will appear later. 6 hoc . cit. 0 Hall, Review in Man of May 1912. 7 Fragm. 21 (ed. Muller) ap. Letronne, Materiaux Ii, 205 ff.

The statement of Eusebius 1 that so early as the reign of Constantine (313-337) Christianity had penetrated to the Ethiopians and Blemyes j refers to the Abyssinians and Troglodytes converted by Frumentius/ in the east 2 , but it is none the less probable that there were Christians in Nubia at the same period, and the record of Cosmus Indico- pleustes prove that there were some there in the fifth century 3 . XXVIII In the sixth century conversion took place on a larger scale. A certain priest named Julianus “...was greatly concerned for the black people of the Nobades, who lived on the southern border of the Thebaid, and as they were heathen he wished to convert them....’ 5 He accordingly persuaded Theodora, the Empress of Justinian, to send him on a mission to Nubia.
