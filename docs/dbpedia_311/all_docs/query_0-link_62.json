        "text": "Bungalow\n\nNYT Critic’s Pick\n\n3 star\n\nIndian\n\n$$$\n\nEast Village\n\nBungalow, presided over by the famed television chef Vikas Khanna, serves personal and deeply creative spins on regional Indian dishes that defy expectations about what Indian restaurant food ought to be.\n\nBy Priya Krishna\n\nYemenat\n\nNYT Critic’s Pick\n\n2 star\n\nMiddle Eastern\n\n$$\n\nBay Ridge\n\nYemenat, opened by three refugees from the civil war in Yemen, has built a roster of dishes from all over the country. There are classic dishes served in most of the places where Yemenis gather in New York, like lamb haneeth. Other dishes are not so easily found, like shafoot, made by soaking a spongy bread in pea-green herbed yogurt sauce.\n\nBy Pete Wells\n\nCoqodaq\n\n1 star\n\nKorean\n\n$$$\n\nFlatiron district\n\nYou can have a good time at Coqodaq, especially if you like eating Korean fried chicken out of a bucket and spending money on Champagne. The restaurant exploits our sentimental nostalgia for the chain restaurants of childhood, along with our suspicion that the future will be worse than the present so we’d better live it up while we can.\n\nBy Pete Wells\n\nSpice Brothers\n\nNYT Critic’s Pick\n\n2 star\n\nMiddle Eastern\n\n$\n\nEast Village\n\nShawarma may seem like an unlikely choice for two classically trained chefs, especially in a city that already has a full variety of revolving meat towers. But the insight behind Lior Lev Sercarz and David Malbequi’s first restaurant together is that shawarma can be a vehicle for rubs, marinades, sauces and last-minute dustings of one powder or another.\n\nBy Pete Wells\n\nPenny\n\nNYT Critic’s Pick\n\n3 star\n\nAmerican, Seafood\n\n$$$\n\nEast Village\n\nSeafood of one kind or another turns up in almost every item on the menu, handled with unusual sensitivity and clarity. Penny is a little reminiscent of the seafood counters of Barcelona, such as Lluritu and Cal Pep.\n\nBy Pete Wells\n\nIlis\n\n1 star\n\nAmerican, Scandinavian\n\n$$$$\n\nGreenpoint\n\nMads Refslund, the Danish-born chef and an owner of ILIS, is one of the founders of the naturalistic, intricate New Nordic style. His kitchen uses shells, sticks, wax and leaves as service pieces, and many of Ilis’s dishes have a certain spooky pagan beauty.\n\nBy Pete Wells\n\nHamburger America\n\nNYT Critic’s Pick\n\n2 star\n\nAmerican, Hamburgers\n\n$\n\nSoHo\n\nIt’s part fast-food restaurant, part shrine to roadside America, part art installation, part nostalgia immersion. The nostalgia is not some manufactured, soft-core exploitation; it’s more like an attempt to bring the past back to life by re-enacting it, one hamburger at a time.\n\nBy Pete Wells\n\nShaw-naé’s House\n\nNYT Critic’s Pick\n\n2 star\n\nAmerican, Caribbean\n\n$$\n\nStapleton\n\nShaw-naé Dixon, the chef and owner, makes a from-scratch style of soul food not often seen in New York City. A self-taught cook, Ms. Dixon has freely adapted the old Southern standbys, lightening here, tightening there.\n\nBy Pete Wells\n\nNoksu\n\n2 star\n\nAmerican, Korean\n\n$$$$\n\nKoreatown\n\nThis is the first kitchen run by the chef Dae Kim. He’s full of talent, a star in the making. But his ideas need to be shaped and formed, and the setting he’s working in is so generic, in a luxe way, that it undercuts what’s distinctive in his cooking.\n\nBy Pete Wells"
