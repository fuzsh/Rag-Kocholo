        "text": "Yesterday I published an image of Le Coq on top of the church in Lénault. Le Coq has long been the unofficial symbol of France, adopted by its national sports teams. However the OFFICIAL symbol of the Republic of France is in fact Marianne whose image appears on many coins, stamps and all government paperwork. If you are unlucky enough to get a French tax bill it will be Marianne you'll see on the letter head.\n\nSo who was Marianne and why is she the symbol of the Republic France? For this I must thank a French friend who wrote the following piece explaining the history of the lady who now represents Liberté, Egalité and Fraternité. Below is my translation of her piece with the original, in French, after that.\n\nWhy is the symbol of the Republic called Marianne?\n\nWhy a woman?\n\nBecause the word republic in French is a feminine noun - La République.\n\nWhy the name \"Marianne\"?\n\nThis seems to be from the contraction of Marie and Anne, two first names that were very widespread in the eighteenth century among the female population. Marianne embodies the values of the republic and the people of France: \"Liberty, equality, fraternity\". It symbolises the \"motherland\", the nurse, the protector, the warrior!\n\nLiberty Leading the People by Eugène Delacroix (1798–1863)\n\nEven though the 1958 Constitution has taken the tricolour as France's National Emblem, Marianne still represents the French Republic. Marianne is shown wearing a phrygian cap, typically worn at the time of The French Revolution and an emblem of freedom and of the Republic. The phrygian cap was ealier worn by freed slaves in Greece and Rome as a symbol of their freedom. This type of cap was also worn by sailors and galley-slaves in the Mediterranean and would have been taken back by the revolutionaries to the south.\n\nUnder the third Republic (from 1870) the number of statues and busts of Marianne multiplied, particularly in the town halls. Several different representations developed according to what she was to emphasise - the revolutionary character or the \"wise\" character of Marianne. In some cases the phrygian cap was considered too revolutionary and has been replaced by a tiara or a crown of laurels.\n\nBust of Marianne wearing a laurel crown by Théodore Doriot and found in the French Senate\n\nSo Marianne never exisited as a real person and she was created to embody everything France stands for today summed up in those three words: Liberté, Egalité and Fraternité - Freedom, Equality and Fraternity.\n\nPourquoi le symbole de la République se nomme Marianne ?\n\nPourquoi une femme:\n\ncar le mot République est un nom féminin.\n\nPourquoi le prénom \"Marianne\" :\n\ncela semble provenir de la contraction de Marie et Anne, deux prénoms très répandus au XVIIIe siècle parmi la population féminine.\n\nMarianne incarne les valeurs de la République et du peuple français: \"Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité\". Elle symbolise la \"mère patrie\", la nourricière, la protectrice, la guerrière!"
