        "text": "Although Three Crowns has become one of Ruiz's best-known works and is regarded as one of his most accessible films, when it was screened at the Cannes Film Festival it had a high walk-out rate as it was seen as \"deliberately unsynopsizable\", according to critic Janet Maslin. Despite this, it was well received for a made-for-TV work, winning the director the Perspectives du Cinéma Français award at the Festival. Ruiz later claimed it was his least favorite of his own films, due to the fact that he had adhered to a conventional script when making it, rather than creating scenes that simply \"wanted to exist\". Nevertheless, he returned to the theme of mysterious storytelling-obsessed sailors many years later in Litoral (2008)."
