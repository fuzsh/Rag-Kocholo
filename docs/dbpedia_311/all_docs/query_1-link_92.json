        "text": "This dark fairy tale by the late, great Raúl Ruiz (see 3/18 at 9:15) is a surreal, nightmarish variant on Peter Pan. It contains a 10-year-old “lost boy” who has murdered his family; a sleepwalking maid who may be the boy’s mother; and a crazed lecher who keeps the servant imprisoned on his rocky island. (There are no pirates.) Rape, incest, and castration factor into this sexually charged, visually stunning, absurdist fantasia that operates on dream logic. “Magical, perversely playful and macabre.” –Time Out Film Guide. Subtitles. 111 min.\n\nSpecial admission $12; members, CIA & CSU I.D. holders, and those age 25 & under $9; no passes, twofers, or radio winners.
