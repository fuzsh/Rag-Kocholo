        "text": "About\n\nThree Crowns of the Sailor will screen from an archival 16mm print.\n\nA dazzling dream voyage through the unearthly recollections of a drunken sailor. Approached by a student who has just murdered his professor, the sailor agrees to provide the young man safe passage in exchange for his listening to the sailor's life story - along with a payment of the titular three Danish crowns. Chilean filmmaker Raúl Ruiz was one of cinema's most imaginative fabulists and this is perhaps his most vivid dreamscape - overflowing with memories drenched in lurid colour and mystical invention.\n\nAges 18+"
