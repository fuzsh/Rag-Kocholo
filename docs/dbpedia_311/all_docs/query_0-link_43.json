        "text": "Sailor Moon in France refers to the Sailor Moon translations and merchandise released in France.\n\nAnime\n\nTranslation and Channels\n\nFrench logo\n\nFrance was one of the first foreign countries to screen the Sailor Moon anime, which premiered in the country on December 23, 1993 on TF1's now defunct children's programming block \"Club Dorothée.\" Like the original North American distributors, the French did not originally get the rights to Stars, and ended the series at SuperS. The first eight episodes were broadcast Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday, but subsequent episodes were shown every Wednesday. In April 1994, reruns started airing and were shown every Monday and Thursday, while the new episodes continued being shown on Wednesdays. Once summer started, the older episodes started being shown every weekday.\n\nAfter the first season finished airing on June 1, 1994, Sailor Moon R started on June 8. Although episode 67 was aired on December 12, 1994, the subsequent episodes did not start airing until February 8, 1995. While the second season was still airing, reruns of the first season began showing once more, and aired between June 26 and August 28 in the same year. The second season finished with episode 89 on October 10, 1995.\n\nThe success of the series until that point on TV prompted the producers to release the Sailor Moon R movie in the country as well, dubbed as \"Sailor Moon, Le Film: La Fleur Maléfique\" (Sailor Moon, the Film: The Evil Flower). It was first shown in theaters on May 15, 1996 (the same premiere date as the premiere of episode 123), but was considered a commercial failure, with only 17,000 tickets sold in Paris. The movie was shown on TV in the same month, on AB Cartoons, then a VHS release followed in April 1997, and later aired on the channel AB1.\n\nThe third season began on October 11, 1995 and concluded June 12, 1996, while the fourth season aired beginning June 19, and finished with episode 149 in August 1997. The last seventeen episodes of the SuperS season were not initially broadcast on TV, but were released on VHS, then later on DVD. When they were aired on TV, they were aired only on TMC and AB Cartoons.\n\nLater reruns of the series were aired on TMC's children block \"Récré Kids\" (1996 - 1997), TVA (1997 - 1999), AB Cartoons (1996 - 1999; renamed \"Mangas\" in 1998), RTL9 (1998), Club RTL (Luxembourg and Belgium; 2002), and Fox Kids (beginning with 2000).\n\nHome Media Releases\n\nThere have been three VHS releases in France. The first was produced by MangaLand in 1995. The first 64 episodes were released on VHS by Mangas over sixteen tapes, each containing four episodes. The last tape, covering episodes 61 to 64 was released on January 1, 2001. The last seventeen episodes of the SuperS season were not initially broadcast on TV, but were released on VHS in December 1996, and then on three DVDs in 2004. This release started at episode 149 and used promotional images from the first three seasons, which included Sailor Uranus, Sailor Neptune, and the Moonlight Knight.\n\nIn September 2013, Kazé France started releasing the entire Sailor Moon anime on DVD box sets, containing all episodes in Japanese and French with new French subtitles. The previously unreleased fifth season, the Sailor Moon S movie, Sailor Moon SuperS movie, and the Sailor Moon SuperS Special have also been released on DVD, dubbed with a completely new cast.\n\nCensorship and Changes\n\nThe original opening and ending theme songs were replaced with a new song called \"Sailor Moon,\" sung by Bernard Minet. Certain episodes from SuperS used the third opening from Sailor Moon S and featured footage originally used along with \"Tuxedo Mirage\" as the ending theme, although it was played with \"Otome no Policy.\"\n\nEpisodes 18, 20, 106, and 108 were not broadcast by TF1 at any time. However, they were aired on every other channel on which the series was broadcast.\n\nThe scene where Usagi hugged Mamoru in his apartment, which faded into a shot of statues in the park, was cut from episode 93.\n\nZoisite and Kunzite were changed to become brothers.\n\nHaruka and Michiru's relationship was explained away by saying that Haruka was a man in civilian form, and Michiru was his girlfriend.\n\nFisheye was changed to be female, but the moment where \"he\" showed his chest was kept.\n\nZirconia was changed to be male.\n\nArtemis was changed to be female in some episodes, but later other characters referred to him as \"he\" or sometimes with both male and female pronouns. Luna remained female, however.\n\nA few cultural references were removed and some scenes showing Japanese writing were cut.\n\nAll insert songs in the first season were retained, but almost all songs were deleted from Sailor Moon R onward. \"Azusa Nigou\" in episode 99 was replaced with a non-vocal version of \"Otome no Policy.\" \"Route Venus\" was left in as an instrumental version in episode 154. \"Watashi-tachi ni Naritakute\" was left in as an instrumental version in both episode 158 and episode 159.\n\nIn several occasions during the third season, Rei's nightmare about the upcoming Silence was cut. It was entirely removed from the beginning of episode 90, leaving only the brief flashbacks she had later on. In episode 119, her nightmare was again cut from the beginning of the episode. Most of the scenes in which characters' Pure Heart Crystals were stolen were shortened.\n\nThe opening preview and title card sequence were cut from the beginning of each episode, and the French title of the episode would instead be shown in the very first scene. The only exception was in episodes 59 and 86, in which the opening preview of the episode was shown, with the episode title over them.\n\nIn Kazé's uncut DVD release, all visual changes made to the show by AB were removed and the original theme and insert songs were used.\n\nCharacter Names\n\nThe French dub changed some characters' names without explanation during the show: for example, An was first called \"Annette\" in episode 47 but was then called \"Anne\" in episode 59, and Naru and Umino changed from \"Nanou\" and \"Marc\" to \"Nina\" and \"Joël,\" respectively, in episode 131. That is because there were multiple persons who adapted the scripts for each season, the person in charge varying almost every episode.\n\nSailor V was almost never called by that name. In the first episode she was called \"Sailor Moon\", but in later episodes she was just called \"Sailor.\" Some exceptions included episode 21 where she was \"Sailor V,\" episode 33 which used \"la cinqiuème Sailor\" (the fifth Sailor), and in episode 42 where they called her \"Sailor Vénus.\"\n\nThe villains in the Stars season and the Sailor Moon SuperS movie were the only ones who did not receive localized names.\n\nSailor Senshi\n\nOriginal French Usagi Tsukino/Sailor Moon/Princess Serenity Bunny Rivière/Sailor Moon/Princesse Sérénité Ami Mizuno/Sailor Mercury Molly/Sailor Mercure Rei Hino/Sailor Mars Raya Hino/Sailor Mars Makoto Kino/Sailor Jupiter Marcy Maurane/Sailor Jupiter Minako Aino/Sailor Venus Mathilda (Amélie)/Sailor Venus Haruka Tenou/Sailor Uranus Frédérique/Sailor Uranus Michiru Kaiou/Sailor Neptune Mylène/Sailor Neptune Setsuna Meiou/Sailor Pluto Sylvana/Sailor Pluton Hotaru Tomoe/Sailor Saturn Olivia Williams/Sailor Saturne Chibiusa/Sailor Chibi Moon Camille/Sailor Chibi Moon Mamoru Chiba/Tuxedo Mask Bourdu/L'Homme Masqué\n\nTommy (episode 36)\n\nFriends of the Senshi\n\nOriginal French Naru Osaka Nanou\n\nNina (episode 131) Gurio Umino Marc\n\nJoël (episode 131) Shingo Tsukino Charly\n\nTommy (episode 40)\n\nGuillaume (SuperS) Reika Nishimura Prisca\n\nMarine (SuperS) Yuuichirou Kumada Théodore Lambert\n\nHippolyte (SuperS) Momoko Momohara Magali\n\nLéa (SuperS) Kyuusuke Sarashina Joël\n\nGaullame (SuperS)\n\nFirst Season\n\nOriginal French Dark Kingdom Le royaume des ténèbres Queen Metalia Reine Métallia Queen Beryl Reine Péril Jadeite Jedaïte Nephrite Néflyte Zoisite Zoïzite Kunzite Kunzite\n\nSailor Moon R\n\nOriginal French Moonlight Knight Le Chevalier du Clair de Lune Ail/Seijuurou Ginga Alex/Serge Antonin An/Natsumi Ginga Annette (episode 47 - 49)/Nathalie Antonin\n\nAnne (episode 50+) Rubeus Robin\n\nRubeus (episode 89) Esmeraude Émerald Koan Carole Berthier Bérénice Calaveras Sélimène Petz Perrine Saphir Saphir Prince Demande Prince Diamant\n\nSailor Moon S\n\nOriginal French Kaolinite/Kaori Carolina/Carole Eudial Eugénia Mimete Babette Tellu Théodora Cyprine Emilie Ptilol Emilia Mistress 9 Grande prêtresse Alexandra (High Priestess Alexandra) Pharaoh 90 Pharaon 90\n\nSailor Moon SuperS\n\nOriginal French Tiger's Eye Oeil de Tigre Hawk's Eye Oeil de Faucon Fisheye Oeil de Poisson Zirconia Zirconoa CereCere Flora JunJun Nina VesVes Prisca PallaPalla Carla Nehellenia Néhélénia Helios/Pegasus Prince Hélios/Pégase\n\nSailor Stars\n\nOriginal French Kou Seiya/Sailor Star Fighter Aster/Sailor Star Fighter Kou Yaten/Sailor Star Healer Nocté/Sailor Star Healer Kou Taiki/Sailor Star Maker Ether/Sailor Star Maker\n\nMovies\n\nOriginal French Kakeru Ozora Ludovic Himeko Nayotake Estelle\n\nVoice Actors\n\nIn the French dub, one actor often played several roles, and several actors played the same role, sometimes changing during the same episode.\n\nAB dub\n\nThe French dub was produced in the SOFI studios and was directed by Philippe Ogouz.

It was released from 1995-1999 in paperback book editions, most of which had the same covers as the Japanese editions. The back of each book had no summary and simply featured art from one of the artbooks. Each of the covers was extra-long and folded over, to create cover flaps which also had art from the artbooks. The front cover flap gave a summary of the volume, and the back listed books previous to that one in the series. The logo used was the one from the artbooks, minus \"Pretty Soldier\" in Japanese, and each volume was given its own title. Three of the French manga covers were printed with mixed-up covers: volume one had the cover for volume two, volume two had the cover for volume six, and volume six had the cover for volume one.\n\nEach volume of the manga was given its own title:\n\nMétamorphose (Metamorphosis)\n\nL'homme masqué (The masked man)\n\nLes justicières de la lune (The moon fighters)\n\nLe cristal d'argent (The silver crystal)\n\nLa gardienne du temps (The guardian of time)\n\nLa planète Némésis (Planet Nemesis)\n\nBlack Lady\n\nLe lycée infini (The infinite high school)\n\nUranus et Neptune (Uranus and Neptune)\n\nSailor Saturne (Sailor Saturn)\n\nLa princesse Kakuya (Princess Kakuya)\n\nPégase (Pegasus)\n\nHélios (Helios)\n\nRoyaume Elusion (Elusion Empire)\n\nLa reine Nérénia (Queen Nerenia)\n\nLes Starlights (The Starlights)\n\nSailor Galaxia\n\nLe Chaos Galactique (Galactic Chaos)\n\nMost of the dialogue in the French editions was accurate, and there were very few alterations of Japanese elements. The only major change in this regard was that Rei Hino became Catholic and her chant was changed to \"Vade retro, satanas!\" (\"Go back, demon!\", a Latin exorcism). Her school's name was also changed to the \"Saint Anne Academy for Girls.\"\n\nThe bulk of the main characters had the same or similar names as the Japanese version. However, the attacks and transformations were not given exact translations, and some were never called the same thing twice. The villains' names were also very different, and many had their genders changed: Kaolinite became \"Elvira,\" Zirconia became a man, the Amazon Trio were all female (and Hawk's Eye was named \"Oak\"), and the Amazoness Quartet were never given names. Mistress 9 became \"Maîtresse 9\" (literal translation). The Death Busters were also incorrectly called \"Death Bastards.\" Princess Kaguya's name was incorrectly translated as \"Kakuya.\"\n\nIn addition, there were some mistakes such as referring to the previously named \"Rubis\" as \"Zoisite\" in the short story \"Casablanca Memory.\" A few other characters were given different names for no apparent reason: Sailor Mercury became \"Sailor Mercure\" by the third book and Séverine was once called \"Setusna.\"\n\nThere is a common misconception among fans that Haruka Tenou became a man for the French manga, but this was not the case. She was referred to as \"he\" at first, before anyone knew she was female. After her identity was discovered, she was always referred to as \"she,\" and her feminine figure was undeniable even outside of sailor uniform. The relationship between Haruka and Michiru remained vague; when they first appeared and Haruka was thought to be male, they were referred to as boyfriend and girlfriend, but later they were called \"best friends.\"\n\nGlénat also published the three original volumes of Codename: Sailor V. In their translations, the names of the enemies were either changed or poorly romanized: Fluorite and Danburite became \"Flolight\" and \"Danbright,\" and Kunzite was called \"Qunsight\" instead of the usual \"Quartz.\" Ace's name was spelled as \"As,\" the French spelling of the name of the card.\n\nThe first artbook was also licensed by Glénat and was released in a hardcover format with the liner notes translated.\n\nThe shinsoban edition of the manga, including Sailor V, was released in France by Pika Edition beginning in July 2012. Their translation was closer to the original than Glénat's, and kept all the original names, although some accents were added to the names to help younger readers with the pronunciation (for example, \"Tomoe\" was written as \"Tomoé\"). \"Daimon\" was spelled \"Daemon,\" and some English words such as \"Queen\" were unchanged. The names of the attacks were not translated, though Tuxedo La Smoking Bomber became \"Tuxedo Smoking Bomber.\" The two pages at the end of the second volume where the early concept art was shown were left entirely untranslated. In the Sailor V manga, the villains in the \"Pet\" chapters had their names changed to French versions of their original Japanese onomatopoeia names, and became \"Miaw Miaw,\" \"Waf Waf,\" and \"Buzz Buzz.\"\n\nBeginning in October 2020, Pika Edition released the \"Eternal\" edition of the manga, with an all-new translation, faithful to the original.\n\nCharacter Names\n\nJapanese French Usagi Tsukino Bunny Tsukino Mamoru Chiba Manoru Chiba Ami Mizuno Amy Mizuno Rei Hino Raya Hino Makoto Kino Mako Kino Minako Aino Minako Aïno Haruka Tenou Frédéric Tenno Michiru Kaiou Mylène Kaio Setsuna Meiou Séverine Meio Hotaru Tomoe Olivia Tomoe (Glénat)\n\nHotaru Tomoé (Pika Edition) Chibiusa Mini-Bunny Sailor Chibi Moon Sailor Mini Moon Tuxedo Mask Tuxedo Masqué Kunzite Quartz Zoicite Rubis Nephrite Nethrite Jadeite Jade\n\nTransformations and Attacks\n\nSailor Moon\n\nOriginal French Translation Moon Prism Power, Make Up Pouvoir du prisme lunaire!

It was the only known official international release of any Sailor Moon video game.\n\nEpisode 1 of the dubbed anime was titled \"Le vilain petit canard devient un cygne !\" (The ugly duckling becomes a swan!) in Kazé's DVD release, which was a reference to the fairy tale \"The Ugly Duckling\" written by Hans Christian Andersen.\n\nIn the TF1 broadcast, when Rei used Fire Soul Bird in episode 54, there were added subtitles on screen translating the writing on the ofuda as \"exterminer le diable!\" (exterminate the devil!).\n\nEpisode 18 was titled \"Poupée de Cire, Poupée de Son,\" which was a reference to a popular song by France Gall.\n\nEpisode 103 was titled \"Le retour de la petite guerrière\" (The return of the small warrior) even though it was not known at the time that Chibiusa was a Sailor Senshi.\n\nIn 1996 AB released a music video of Bernard Minet performing the French theme song, which used footage from the third season.\n\nThe Messiah was often referred to as \"la grande prêtresse\" (the high priestess), which became part of Mistress 9's name (Grande Prêtresse Alexandra).\n\nHaruka's name in the French manga was \"Frédéric,\" which is a name spelling used only for men (\"Frédérique\" is the feminine spelling). This was a possible reason why many fans believed that her gender had been changed in the manga.\n\nAlthough Minako was renamed \"Mathilda\" in the French dub, she was sometimes called \"Amélie Morin,\" which was the name of her voice actress.\n\nIn episode 46, Usagi's failed test was changed to a math test instead of an English test, as it was in the first episode.\n\nIn episode 58, Sailor Mercure incorrectly called herself \"Sailor Mercury.\"\n\nIn episode 70, Carole said Bérénice was her friend, instead of her sister.\n\nIn episode 89, Sailor Moon called herself \"Guerrière de la Lune\" (Moon Warrior).\n\nIn episode 93, Bunny mentioned that Mathilda was fluent in Spanish.\n\nIn episode 102, Carolina said that she would meet with Bunny at Tokyo's Eiffel Tower.\n\nFrédérique called Bunny \"Face de Lune\" (Moon Face).\n\nWhen Act 15 of Sailor Moon Crystal first aired, Usagi used the phrase for Moon Prism Power, Make Up instead of the new one that went with the Crystal Star. However, this mistake was corrected in the DVD release.\n\nViluy was never given a name in the French dub, and she had two voice actresses: one, Agnès Gribe, for her Viluy form, and another, Amélie Morin, for her Yui Bidoh form.\n\nFrançois Leccia, an actor who played a number of roles in the French dub, died in 2009."
