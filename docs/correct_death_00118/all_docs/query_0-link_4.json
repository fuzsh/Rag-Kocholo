        "text": "Pearl Street\n\n17 State Street (6 Pearl)\n\n17 State Street (6 Pearl)\n\nAfter leaving the Pearl Street address, the family moved âuptownâ to 55 Courtland Street â the site where the World Trade Towers stood and have now been replaced by the new âFreedom Towerâ\n\nFreedom Tower\n\nIn 1826 the Melvills moved to a house at 33 Bleeker Street in NYC â a bit further âuptownâ (and also going from the west to the east side of Manhattan) in what might have almost been thought of as suburbs! This house also, is gone and in its place is a red brick building with the ZÃ¼rcher Art Galerie on the first floor and apartments above.\n\nBleeker St\n\nBleeker St\n\nIt was while Herman lived here that he and his older brother Gansevoort (1815-1846) started to attend the New York Male High School which must have included a grammar school.\n\nTwo years later, in 1828 the family moved to 675 Broadway âonly a short distance away. This building too was also demolished. It is now a large building running from Broadway to Mercer Street along West 3rd Street.\n\n675 Broadway\n\nThe West 3rd St. side of the building\n\nThe entrance at 240 Mercer Street\n\nThere is some thought he may have lived at 103 East 10th in Dec 1861, but this is not well documented.\n\n103 East 10th\n\nAfter his marriage, Melville and his family moved back to New York City\n\nHerman married Elizabeth Knapp Shaw August 4th 1847 and after a honeymoon in Canada, Herman and his wife moved to 103 4th Ave. in New York City, just slightly south of East 14th Street. Like the other Melville houses, this one also has been replaced by a much taller building.\n\nsouth of East 14th Street\n\nThe lower building is a post office. The taller building to the left occupies the spot where Melville would have lived. It is more or less connected with the building to its left, but the brick work implies 2 separate buildings.\n\nThe tall brown building is where the Melvilleâs would have lived.\n\nAccording to Hershel Parkerâs 2 volume biography of Melville, it is possible that Melville stayed at 150 East 18th Street in January of 1862 (Parker Vol 2 p481 Howard p 271\n\nMelvilleâs last residence in New York, and the place where he died, was 104 East 26th. Just off Park Ave. South. (The current building uses that street as an address. A small entrance way, however, is all one can find with the East 26th Street address, but this building at least has a plaque memorializing Melvilleâs home there.\n\nAfter his death he and some of his family were buried in the Bronx at Woodlawn Cemetery. It is best to go by subway there. The Woodlawn stop is probably the closest to the grave site, but the cemetery is very interesting and it is worth a visit just to look around."
