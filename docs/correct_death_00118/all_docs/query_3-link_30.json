June 6, 1846: 2 col 1.\n\nDEATH OF GANSEVOORT MELVILLE.\n\nThe intelligence of the death of Mr. MELVILLE, proves alas, to be too well founded! He expired at his lodgings in London, on the 12th of May. His complaint was an enlargement of the heart brought on by excessive application and confinement necessarily devolved upon him in consequence of the continued illness of Mr. McLANE. He was attended during his sickness by several of the most eminent physicians in London: and all that skill and assiduous attention and the kindness of devoted friends,—not the least devoted of whom to the extent of his physical strength was Mr. McLANE—was done to avert a fatal termination. But in vain. He died in the full possession of his faculties and with resignation to the inevitable stroke, coming as it did under circumstances peculiarly trying to all the faculties and sympathies of our nature.Mr. MELVILLE was well known and deservedly esteemed here. He was a nephew of highly respected townsmen, Judge GANSEVOORT. To his family to sisters and brothers to whom he was tenderly attached and especially to his widowed mother, not less than to his friends he was endeared by high and noble qualities. At the period of his departure on the mission which has proved the fulfilment of his mission in the world, he was a resident of the city of N York, engaged in the practice of the law, associated with a younger and talented brother.

Mr. Mellville [sic] was thought a great deal of by his family and his friends in this city, where he was well known and much esteemed. He was a young man of great promise and remarkable genius. He possessed high oratorical powers. During the campaign that resulted in the election of Mr. Polk, he travelled hundreds of miles over the country, delivering speeches to the people. He was a young man of elevated sentiment, fine education, and will be deeply regretted by all who knew him. He has left two brothers who are now in this city, one of whom, Herman Melville, is the author of an extraordinary book called \"Typee,\" giving an account of his adventures in the South Seas, and almost equal in interest to the celebrated Robinson Crusoe.\n\nLansingburgh Democrat.\n\nJune 13, 1846: 2 cols 2-3.Miss Melville, Sister of the late Ganesvoort [sic] Melville, returned home in the steamer Great Western.\n\nRochester Daily Democrat\n\n.

Sometimes they fell asleep; and being missed directly that anything was to be done, their shipmates often amused themselves by running them aloft with a pulley dropped down the scuttle from the fore-top.One night, when all was perfectly still, I lay awake in the forecastle; the lamp was burning low and thick, and swinging from its blackened beam; and with the uniform motion of the ship, the men in the bunks rolled slowly from side to side; the hammocks swaying in unison.Presently I heard a foot upon the ladder, and looking up, saw a wide trousers' leg. Immediately, Navy Bob, a stout old Triton, stealthily descended, and at once went to groping in the locker after something to eat.Supper ended, he proceeded to load his pipe. Now, for a good comfortable smoke at sea, there never was a better place than the Julia's forecastle at midnight. To enjoy the luxury, one wants to fall into a kind of dreamy reverie, only known to the children of the weed. And the very atmosphere of the place, laden as it was with the snores of the sleepers, was inducive of this. No wonder, then, that after a while Bob's head sunk upon his breast; presently his hat fell off, the extinguished pipe dropped from his mouth, and the next moment he lay out on the chest as tranquil as an infant.Suddenly an order was heard on deck, followed by the trampling of feet and the hauling of rigging. The yards were being braced, and soon after the sleeper was missed: for there was a whispered conference over the scuttle.Directly a shadow glided across the forecastle and noiselessly approached the unsuspecting Bob. It was one of the watch with the end of a rope leading out of sight up the scuttle. Pausing an instant, the sailor pressed softly the chest of his victim, sounding his slumbers; and then hitching the cord to his ankle, returned to the deck.Hardly was his back turned, when a long limb was thrust from a hammock opposite, and Doctor Long Ghost, leaping forth warily, whipped the rope from Bob's ankle, and fastened it like lightning to a great lumbering chest, the property of the man who had just disappeared.Scarcely was the thing done, when lo! with a thundering bound, the clumsy box was torn from its fastenings, and banging from side to side, flew toward the scuttle. Here it jammed; and thinking that Bob, who was as strong as a windlass, was grappling a beam and trying to cut the line, the jokers on deck strained away furiously. On a sudden, the chest went aloft, and striking against the mast, flew open, raining down on the heads of a party the merciless shower of things too numerous to mention.Of course the uproar roused all hands, and when we hurried on deck, there was the owner of the box, looking aghast at its scattered contents, and with one wandering hand taking the altitude of a bump on his head.\"\n\nThe Dollar Newspaper\n\n[Philadelphia, PA].

On this occasion it was resolved to hold a Mass Meeting in his spacious Saloon.The meeting organized by placing OLD BEESLEY AT THE TOP OF THE HEAP. The business first presented, was the merits of all Authors, ancient and modern, foreign and domestic; the subject ranged from Old Herodotus to Herman Melville, and was most thoroughly handled. During the interval, music arose with its voluptuous swell from Flute, Fiddle, and Flageolet. The subject, or subjects, being most\n\nadvantageously disposed of,\n\nthe question arose—\"\n\nCan\n\na certain individual afford to advertise more than\n\nOld Top?\n\n\" when it was admitted that he\n\nCan if\n\nhe has 100 guitars, 100 fifes, 101 flageolets, 200 flutes, 309 accordeons, and 507 violins; he\n\nCan if\n\nhe has 5,000 vols. books, one cart load of slates, 100 reams writing paper, one ton of stationary of all kinds, from a ledger to a wafer; he\n\nCan if\n\nhe has steel engravings enough to cover the floor of Congress, and lithographs enough to cover the field of Cerro Gordo; if he\n\ncan\n\npile Pelion upon Ossa with illustrated papers, annuals, holiday presents, &c. &c., then he is a competitor—if he does not possess all these facilities he must be content to let\n\n\"Old Top\"\n\nremain at THE TOP OF THE HEAP!

I find it laid down in none of the astronomical charts in my possession nor am I able to fix it in any constellation or group. I recollect observing a similar appearance and pointing it out to Professor MITCHELL of the Cincinnati Observatory on his visit to this city last winter. he could make nothing of it. Perhaps you, who have the range of the sideral, as well as the terrestrial sphere, will be able to help me. Yours respectfully,\n\nProf. of Astronomy and Celestial Trigonometery,\n\nColumbia College, N. Y.\n\nTO YANKEE DOODLE, Esq.\n\nWe have received communications of a similar tenor to the foregoing from several other quarters: among them, one from a distinguished scientific gentleman at Staten Island, who dwells upon the fluctuating and uncertain character of this light, \"which,\" to use his own expressive language, \"seems to be all up one moment and all down the next.\" A letter has, also, just come to hand from a farmer, living at Hackensack, New Jersey, who describes a similar light, as flooding the neighborhood where he lives, shining, he says, from the direction of New York city, and bewildering, with its sudden and dazzling glare, the cattle in the fields. He speaks of having lost a fine heifer, engulphed in a morass, by attempting to follow its will-o'-the-wisp shiftings; also of the narrow escape of a neighbor's son, at Sekokus, who lost his foothold on a bridge, gaping at it. These communications all close with a request that YANKEE DOODLE will enlighten them as to the character of this new planet. In answer, YANKEE DOODLE suggests, it must be THE BARNUM which shines, at about S. S. E. from the City Hall, just over the American Museum. It is unquestionably a most potential planet, and has presided over the birth of a great many wonderful and curious creatures. It was under this star, we think, that Mrs. JOYCE HEATH attained her 104th birth-day and came to be the nurse of General WASHINGTON. This was the natal star also, we believe, of the FeeJee Mermaid. It ruled for a time the destinies of General TOM THUMB, and now culminates powerfully, according to popular belief, in the direction of the Chinese Junk. Its place was first fixed by a Mr. BARNUM, an enterprising citizen of this city, and it appropriately bears his name.\n\nWe have observed that every Monday evening, during the session of the City Council, it wheels about, as by some magical influence, and blazes in at the southern window of the Hall, with great power.\n\nWe have learned from a subordinate in the Mayor's office, just arrived, that this course of proceeding on the part of THE BARNUM saves the city about five shillings weekly in candles, and that the City Aldermen regard Mr. BARNUM as a great public benefactor.\n\nYankee Doodle 2(42). July 24, 1847. 153.\n\nOne of its Assistant Editors \"Reflects Credit\" on the Courier and Enquirer.\n\nYANKEE DOODLE makes no profession of superior morality, but he will at all times endeavor to respect the decencies of life and preserve the proprieties of language. A writer, whose initials (G. W. P.) [George Washington Peck] make him known as one of the assistant editors of the Courier & Enquirer [Morning Courier and New-York Enquirer] newspaper, takes Mr. HERMAN MELVILLE to task, in the last number of the American Review in high parsonical style, for the freedom of his \"Omoo.\" Mr. P. is not entitled to the throwing of the first stone, and if he had made up his mind to lynch \"Omoo,\" he should have selected cleaner shot than the following to pelt it with. Are we reading a miscellaneous magazine, for the study and the drawing room, or have we come upon a stray leaf in physiology, bound in among the pages of the \"American Review, a Whig Journal,\" by mistake?\n\n\"It is nothing new to hear conceited men boast of their perfect irresistibleness with the sex. 'Oh, it is the easiest thing in the world,' we remember, one of these gentry used to say, a la Mantalini; 'a woman is naturally cunning, now only you keep cool and you’ll soon see through her; a man must look out for himself, a woman for herself,' &c. This very person, as we happened to know, through a confidential medical friend, could no more, at that very time, when his conversation was in this lofty strain, have wronged a woman, than Charteris could have committed the crime for which he was hung. Since then, and confirmed by various other experience, we have always doubted when we hear a man, especially on a short acquaintance, and most especially in a book that goes to the public, pluming himself on his virility—letting it be no secret that he is a 'very devil among the women.' Once, at a refectory in —, we were supping with a friend, when, the tables being full, there came a little, long-necked, falling-shouldered, pumpkin-faced young man, and took the end of ours. We exchanged a few words, and presently he dashed, without previous preparation, into a full confession of what he styled his 'peculiar weakness,' in which, if we were to believe him, he let out enough to show that he might have out-bidden the Satyrs, in Spenser, for the favors of Helena.

He said there were plenty of good men and a fair field this year. Speaking of some who had lately behaved very well, Mr. Arthur said:“The shark is only an angel well governed.” Not being quite understood, he added:“Did you ever hear of Herman Melville, one of our novelists? He wrote ‘Typee.’ When I went into the Custom-house first, as an associate officer, I saw a list of men doomed to be decapitated. Among them was the name ‘Herman Melville.’ It struck me as singular, and I inquired whether he was any relation of the author. They told me he was the same man. I had read ‘Typee’ and ‘Omoo’ and ‘Moby Dick’ with a good deal of interest, and I said: “It is certainly a shame to turn out a man like that from a mere clerkship.” I had him saved. Then when I became Collector of the Port I kept him in my eye and protection again, though I never spoke to him. It was Melville, in his novel of ‘Moby Dick,’ who depicted a sermon by a negro who told of an escape from a shark, and after describing the shark in horrible language as a monster of iniquity and vice, he ended by saying: ‘But, my breddren, we mustn’t tink we is much better dan de shark. De angels is only sharks well governed.’”Herman Melville is said to be still in the Custom-house, aged 60 years. He was born in New York city and brought up near Troy, when he concluded to go to sea. He deserted in the Marquesas Islands, and was directed by the savages and went from group to group of the islands until in 1843 he shipped about one of our frigates and came home. He published ‘Typee’ in 1846. The next year he married a daughter of Chief Justice Shaw, and then went into tale-writing as a business in Massachusetts. As late as 1860 he went around the world again. After such a life of adventure and literary prominence, it is strange to see Melville doomed by politicians to lose his clerkship, and only saved by the youthful remembrance of General Arthur.

S. Doolittle.\" As an inducement to research, Leyda had printed in the 1969 Supplement a full-page photograph of the tooth as inscribed to Melville by Captain Worth and by Melville to Doolittle. On 4 July 2006, after Google and other Internet tools were available, Scott Norsworthy (a non-academic, despite his PhD in literature) informed me that the recipient was the Albany artist Edwin Stafford Doolittle (1843-1879), who in 1867 had a studio in New York City. He was one of who knows how many artists Melville knew personally. Then in February 2010 while I was looking for something else in the free fultonhistory.com database I found a 1 June 1887 article by S. S. Stafford, Doolittle's heir (a nephew?), written for the Albany Journal, headed: \"A SPERM WHALE'S CAPTURE / THE LIVES OF THREE MEN AND SIX HOURS' WORK REQUIRED.\" Stafford began: \"Lying on my desk and used as a paper weight is the tooth of a \"Cachelot\" or sperm whale,\" a \"mass of solid ivory, nine inches long by three wide and weighing 33 ounces.\" Then he told a thrilling story which Captain Worth, a son-in-law of Owen Chase, must have told Melville in person. It's hard to know whether to be more pleased at having Doolittle and Worth identified or more chagrined at our taking so long to identify them. And when did Worth meet Melville? During the months he was home from December 1861 to October 1862, during which Melville was for some months at one or another rented lodging in Manhattan? Such question will not be answered by contributors to academic journals like American Literature, those critics still satisfied, even now, that all they need to know about Melville is in the vaunted pre-1994 \"full-scale biographies.\" Such critics are not driven by love of Melville.\n\nParker, Hershel. \"Rough Draft of the Introduction to The New Melville Log.\" Fragments from a Writing Desk.

He was emphatically a man; and his writings are of a merit so extraordinary that it seems amazing that little stories, without a bit of life or character in them, can be sold by hundred thousand, while “Typee,” “Omoo,” and the great “Moby Dick” are passed by when some editor and publisher undertakes to present them once more to the public.

It is quite time, that Melville’s life was written, since his fame is steadily growing among readers who would probably be glad to learn the details of his life. It is fifteen years since Melville died, fifty-five since he published his remarkable story of “The Whale,” better known under its later title of “Moby Dick.”Yet we still have to acquire such knowledge of his personality as is possible from meager articles in encyclopedias, and a general idea that much of his autobiography is worked into his books. “Typee” and “Omoo” were, indeed, more or less professedly a narrative of the author’s adventures among the romantic islands of Vivien,—which Stevenson was the first to make really popular with English readers. They are still not so well-known as they might be, though few who have fallen under their spell will refuse to join in Stevenson’s enthusiastic criticism that their author was a howling “cheese.” In “White Jacket” and “Moby Dick” Melville did for the sea what in the earlier books he had done for the South Sea Islands.Mr. Louis Becke has well described the innate fascination of his work:—“He was of the sea; he loved it. Its hardships, its miseries, its starvation, its brutalities, and the grossness and the wickedness that everywhere surrounded him in his wanderings through the two Pacifics held but little place in the mind of a man who, ragged and unkempt, as was too often his condition, had a soul as deep and wide and pure as the ocean itself, a soul that for ever lifted him up above all mean and squalid things.”So he stands in our literature among that little band of writers, from Marryat and Michael Scott to Mr. Joseph Conrad, who have written of the sea with the inspiration that is born of love and knowledge.—“Manchester Guardian.”\n\nDaily News\n\n[Perth, Australia].
