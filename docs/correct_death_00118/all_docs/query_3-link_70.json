        "text": "Please don’t think of me as a sob sister who sees their drama as unique. What I’m describing\n\nin general detail is the situation and dilemmas facing every homeless person. Until more permanent housing is found, we’re at the mercy of cons, cops, and/or goons representing the property owners. So we soldier on, joining the lines of our fellows carting around their everything from sleeping spot to sleeping spot. You see the weariness and the frustration on our faces, always having to be on the move and get on the move at a moment’s notice.\n\nThe numbers from the National Alliance to End Homelessness are unambiguous on this point: For every unhoused person who finds a shelter bed or a studio apartment, there is one who has been, and will be, on waiting lists for months. Or years. Even decades. And then you need to factor in the effect of inflation on housing availability, as well as its impact on the number of unhoused individuals. At any given time, affordable, low-income housing is only a fraction of the available housing on the market. And things can only get worse when housing bubbles expand, shrink or burst."
