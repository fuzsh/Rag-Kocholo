He is most known for his sea-themed novels, which include his masterwork Moby Dick (1851).\n\nSee the fact file below for more information about Herman Melville, or you can download our 24-page Herman Melville worksheet pack to utilize within the classroom or home environment.\n\nKey Facts & Information\n\nHERITAGE AND YOUTH\n\nMelville’s upbringing and early life significantly shaped the conflicts in his creative vision. Born to Allan and Maria Gansevoort Melville, he was the third child among eight siblings.\n\nHis ancestors, Scottish and Dutch pioneers, held prominent roles in the American Revolution and the new nation’s political and commercial spheres.\n\nHis grandfathers included Maj. Thomas Melville, a Boston Tea Party participant and New York importer, and General Peter Gansevoort, a key figure in fortifying Fort Stanwix during the Revolution.\n\nDescribed by his father as “backward in speech and somewhat slow in comprehension… of a docile and amiable disposition,” young Melville suffered weakened vision due to scarlet fever.\n\nAfter the family’s import business failed in 1830, they moved to Albany, where Herman briefly attended Albany Academy. Following Allan’s death in 1832, the family faced financial difficulties.\n\nGansevoort, the eldest son, took over his father’s business and household responsibilities. Herman worked as a bank clerk on his uncle’s farm in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, before joining his family there.\n\nDespite limited resources, Herman enrolled in Albany Classical School in 1835, gaining prominence in the local debating society. However, dissatisfied with teaching in Pittsfield, he returned to Albany after three months.\n\nWANDERINGS AND VOYAGES\n\nMelville spent his youth seeking security, with much of his writing reflecting a similar spiritual quest. His travels began in 1837 when Gansevoort went bankrupt, forcing the family to move to Lansingburgh (later Troy).\n\nHerman studied surveying at Lansingburgh Academy for an Erie Canal job that fell through.\n\nGansevoort then arranged for him to sail as a cabin boy on the “St. Lawrence” to Liverpool in 1839.\n\nUpon returning, Melville faced a tough job market, briefly taught at a school that closed without paying him, and eventually followed his uncle to Illinois before setting out for the South Seas on the whaler “Acushnet” in January 1841.\n\nIn June 1842, the “Acushnet” anchored in the Marquesas Islands, inspiring Melville’s first book, Typee (1846).\n\nAccording to Typee, Melville and a companion escaped the ship and were held by the Typee people for about four months, though records show he joined the Australian whaler “Lucy Ann” in August. Regardless, Typee depicted the valley as a peaceful haven from a competitive culture.\n\nMelville’s second book, Omoo (1847), was based on his subsequent adventures, including a mutiny and imprisonment in Tahiti, which he escaped unscathed.\n\nThe book humorously chronicled his island travels and criticized colonial and missionary impacts on the Tahitians.\n\nHis actual time on these trips was brief. In November, he joined the whaler “Charles & Henry” as a harpooner, leaving the ship in Lahaina, Hawaii, six months later. After sustaining himself for over three months, he joined the frigate “United States” as an ordinary seaman in August 1843 and was discharged in Boston in October 1844.\n\nTHE YEARS OF ACCLAIM\n\nMelville’s family prospects brightened when his brother Gansevoort was appointed secretary to the U.S. legation in London after Polk’s 1844 victory.\n\nInspired by his family’s reception to his South Seas stories, Melville wrote them down, ushering in his years of glory.\n\nTypee and Omoo stirred zeal and anger, but Gansevoort’s death left Melville head of the family and more committed to writing.\n\nHe married Elizabeth Shaw in 1847, applied unsuccessfully for a government job, and began writing Mardi.\n\nIn 1847, Melville started contributing to a literary newspaper.\n\nHe was seen as an extroverted literary figure in New York, but his wife described him as writing in harsh conditions. Mardi was poorly received, but he quickly wrote Redburn and White Jacket.\n\nTraveling to England in 1849, Melville eased his publisher’s doubts and returned in early 1850. White Jacket was praised, and its critique of Navy injustices garnered political support, though both books had somber undertones.\n\nReading Shakespeare deeply affected Melville, balancing Emerson’s optimistic transcendentalism. Inspired by Hawthorne’s Scarlet Letter, Melville bought a farm near Hawthorne and began Moby Dick, influenced by their friendship.\n\nTheir relationship deepened Melville’s creative vision but eventually cooled. Moby Dick was published in 1851, but it did not bring immediate acclaim.\n\nThe novel explores the human spirit’s triumphs and failures through the dramatic tale of Captain Ahab and the white whale.\n\nMelville’s next book, Pierre (1852), reflected his struggles and alienation. It was a critical financial failure, leading to his career’s collapse at age 33.\n\nDespite hardships, he continued writing, producing Israel Potter (1855) and notable stories for Putnam’s Monthly Magazine like “Bartleby the Scrivener” and “Benito Cereno,” marked by his growing despair and contempt for hypocrisy.\n\nIn 1856, Melville traveled Europe and the Levant, documenting his journey. His final novel, The Confidence-Man (1857), satirized America’s commercial corruption.\n\nAfter this, he undertook three American lecture tours and joined his brother on a sea voyage in 1860, which he abandoned in San Francisco.\n\nTHE YEARS OF WITHDRAWAL\n\nMelville abandoned writing books to focus on poetry despite low chances of publication.\n\nTo support his family, he sought government favor but was denied a consular appointment and enlistment in the Navy. A legacy from his father-in-law eased his financial burden, leading to the sale of “Arrowhead” and a move to New York City in late 1863.\n\nHis first poetry volume, Battle-Pieces and Aspects of the War (1866), was privately published. He found a stable income as a customs inspector, which allowed him to write during his free time.\n\nDespite health issues, Melville continued writing. His son Malcolm accidentally shot himself in 1867, and his other son, Stanwix, died in 1886 after a long illness.\n\nThese tragedies and his custom job reduced his creative output. In 1888, he published John Marr and Other Sailors With Some Sea-Pieces privately.\n\nHe retired by 1889 and worked on unfinished projects, including Timoleon (1891) and Billy Budd.\n\nBilly Budd, completed in 1891 but published in 1924, tells of a sailor who kills a master-at-arms by accident and accepts his execution, leaving a legacy of hope. Melville died on September 28, 1891, largely unrecognized, with only one obituary.\n\nMelville’s work, grounded in reality and symbolic truths, reflected his era’s internal conflicts and human nature’s dualities.\n\nThough initially overlooked, he is now considered one of America’s great writers, with contemporary criticism acknowledging his profound insights.\n\nLEGACY AND HONORS\n\nMelville, New York, on Long Island, was named in Melville’s honor in 1854, three years after Moby Dick was published.\n\nThe Library of America (LOA) released pieces in 1982 to commemorate Melville’s seminal role in American culture; Typee, Omoo, and Mardi were included in the inaugural collection.\n\nLater books included Melville’s 1983 publication of Redburn, White-Jacket, Moby Dick, and 1985’s publication of Pierre, Israel Potter, The Confidence-Man, Tales, and Billy Budd.\n\n2019 saw the publication of LOA’s whole collection of poems.\n\nOn August 1, 1984, the United States produced a commemorative stamp worth twenty cents in honor of Melville as part of the Literary Arts Series of stamps released by the Postal Service. The issue’s first day was held at the Whaling Museum in New Bedford, Massachusetts.\n\nThe New York City Herman Melville Society, which held meetings at 104 East 26th Street, named Herman Melville Square in 1985. Melville lived at this address from 1863 to 1891, writing Billy Budd and other works. In Lansingburgh, New York, Melville’s home is home to the Lansingburgh Historical Society.\n\n2010 saw the naming of a species of extinct sperm whale in Melville’s honor, Livyatan melvillei. The fossil was found by paleontologists who were Moby Dick admirers and dedicated their findings to the writer.\n\nThe renowned English ghazal “Tonight” by Kashmiri-American poet Agha Shahid Ali concludes with the words “Call me Ishmael tonight.”\n\nHerman Melville Worksheets\n\nThis fantastic bundle includes everything you need to know about Herman Melville across 24 in-depth pages.

He is best known for his novel “Moby-Dick,” which is considered one of the greatest works of American literature.\n\nWhat is “Moby-Dick” about?\n\n“Moby-Dick” is the story of Captain Ahab’s obsessive quest to kill Moby Dick, a giant white whale. The novel explores themes of vengeance, the limits of knowledge, and the struggle between man and nature. The narrative is structured around the experiences of Ishmael, a sailor on Ahab’s whaling ship, the Pequod.\n\nWhat other notable works did Melville write?\n\nBesides “Moby-Dick,” Melville wrote several other significant works, including “Typee” and “Omoo” (adventure tales based on his experiences in the South Seas), “Bartleby, the Scrivener” (a short story about a peculiar law copyist), and “Billy Budd, Sailor” (a posthumously published novella).\n\nHow was Melville’s work received during his lifetime?\n\nMelville’s early works, such as “Typee” and “Omoo,” were commercially successful and gained him some fame. However, “Moby-Dick” and his later works were not well-received by contemporary readers and critics. Melville’s reputation declined, and he died in relative obscurity. It was only in the 20th century that his work was re-evaluated and he was recognized as a major American writer.\n\nWhat themes are commonly found in Melville’s writing?\n\nMelville’s writing often explores complex themes such as the ambiguity of good and evil, the limits of human knowledge and understanding, the struggle for individuality, and the impact of civilization on nature. His works frequently delve into philosophical and existential questions, often through richly symbolic and allegorical narratives.\n\nLink/cite this page\n\nIf you reference any of the content on this page on your own website, please use the code below to cite this page as the original source.\n\nLink will appear as Herman Melville Facts & Worksheets: https://kidskonnect.com - KidsKonnect, July 10, 2024\n\nUse With Any Curriculum\n\nThese worksheets have been specifically designed for use with any international curriculum.
