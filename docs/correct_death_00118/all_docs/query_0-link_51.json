        "text": "Herman Melville (1819-1891) was an author and poet. Melville is best known for the novel Moby-Dick.\n\nLife[]\n\nBorn in New York City in the August of 1819, Melville's parents were the descendants of nobility and had links to the founding of America. Despite this, the Melville family was plunged into poverty by Melville's father. This led to Melville spending most of his childhood between houses and having a meager education.\n\nShortly after Melville's meager schooling ended, his father died after experiencing \"signs of delirium\". After work as a clerk and a schoolteacher, Melville took posts on sailing vessels. These voyages took Melville to various distant islands in the Pacific and inspired his writing - most notably in his first published books. According to Melville, most of his education took place during voyages on sea through reading the ship's library.\n\nShortly after returning, Melville wrote his first two books - Typee and Omoo, based on his sea-voyages - which were met by critical success. Melville's third novel, Mardi (his first deviation from the style of writing seen in his first two novels), flopped critically. His next two books (Redburn and White-Jacket) were, according to Melville, written only for the money.\n\nShortly before the publication of Moby-Dick, Melville met fellow author Nathaniel Hawthorne. The two became quick friends, with Melville describing Hawthorne as essentially being the next William Shakespeare. Though Moby-Dick is now considered Melville's magnum opus, it was a commercial failure when first published.\n\nrest to be added\n\nWriting style[]\n\nDue to his time spent on the sea, many of Melville's works take place on sailing vessels.\n\nrest to be added\n\nNotable works[]\n\nTypee\n\nOmoo\n\nBartleby, the Scrivener\n\nPoetry[]\n\nBattle-Pieces and Aspects of the War\n\nClarel\n\nJohn Marr and Other Sailors\n\nTimoleon\n\nNovels[]\n\nMardi\n\nRedburn\n\nWhite-Jacket\n\nMoby-Dick\n\nPierre\n\nIsrael Potter\n\nThe Confidence-Man\n\nNovellas[]\n\nThe Encantadas\n\nBenito Cereno\n\nBilly Budd, Sailor\n\nSee also[]\n\nNathaniel Hawthorne\n\nEdgar Allan Poe\n\nSources[]"
