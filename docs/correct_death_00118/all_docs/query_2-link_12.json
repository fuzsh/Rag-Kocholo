        "text": "Date of Birth August 1, 1819 Date Of Death September 28, 1891 Age 72 Years Death Cause Congestive Heart Failure\n\nHerman Melville, also named as “Melvill” was a famous American author who is known for his creative work including novels, short stories, and poetry. He was born on August 1, 1819, and rose as the best writer of the American Renaissance time. After marking a golden literature era he sadly died on September 28, 1891, from congestive heart failure. Let’s have a look at his legacy and real death facts!\n\nHe wasn’t just a well-known novelist; he was also a prolific short-story writer, poet, lecturer, teacher, sailor, and customs inspector. His pursuit of literature began with his study at The Albany Academy in Albany, New York. Melville wrote in a variety of literary genres, including travel writing, tales of captivity, nautical fiction, gothic romance, allegory, and tall tales. He was a key player in the literary movement known as Romanticism.\n\nMelville married Elizabeth Knapp Shaw in 1847, and the two of them went on to have four children. In the tranquil Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City, he is laid to rest. Herman Melville is regarded as a key character in literary history because of the different experiences he had during his life and the literary works he produced.\n\nprofessional and Literary challenges\n\nHerman Melville, known for his literary masterpiece “Moby Dick,” faced a series of professional challenges in the later years of his life. His masterpiece, “Moby Dick,” was widely disregarded by literary critics throughout his lifetime despite his early success with books like “Typee” and “Omoo,” among others. It took several years for the novel’s complex themes and metaphorical layers to receive the attention they deserved.\n\nTo the last, I grapple with thee; From Hell’s heart, I stab at thee; For hate’s sake, I spit my last breath at thee! (Herman Melville).\n\nAlong with it, Melville struggled financially during this time. He was disappointed by the negative response to several of his works, such as “Pierre,” and found it difficult to stay afloat financially. He took on a number of jobs to provide for his family, including working as a customs officer in the ports of New York.\n\nLate-Life Insights on Personal Tragedies\n\nHerman Melville experienced both professional difficulties and personal tragedy in his senior years. The emotional difficulties Melville had for the rest of his life were exacerbated by the tragic suicide of his eldest son Malcolm Melville in 1867.\n\nMelville kept writing despite these obstacles. He wrote poems and other literary works that were influenced by his philosophies and experiences. Many of his later works, including “Clarel: A Poem and Pilgrimage in the Holy Land,” which explored spiritual difficulties, were inspired by his travels.\n\nOn September 28, 1891, Melville’s trip came to an end when he suddenly suffered a heart attack and died at the age of 72. Interestingly, Melville’s literary fame rose in the years after his passing. As historians and critics came to recognise the breadth and significance of his contributions to American literature, “Moby Dick” in particular was acknowledged as one of the finest works in American literary history.\n\nKnowing how to grow old is the masterwork of wisdom and one of the most difficult chapters in the great art of living! (Herman Melville).\n\nThe writings of Herman Melville, particularly “Billy Budd, The Confidence-Man, Redburn and Omoo” are still widely read, admired, and researched by literature lovers and scholars today. His writings and life continue to play a significant role in the evolution of American literature, and readers of all ages continue to be moved by his examination of important issues."
