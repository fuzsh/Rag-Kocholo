        "text": "Malcolm Melville died on September 12, 1867, at age 18 from--to quote his death certificate--a \"pistol shot wound in (his) right temporal region.\" Contemporary designations of the mode of his death changed within hours from suicide, to accident, to death while of unsound mind. Historically, the mode of his death has remained equivocal. In order to approach this enigma a \"psychological autopsy\" of an equivocal death case as identical to Malcolm Melville's as was possible was conducted as though it were a genuine current \"open\" case at the Los Angeles Suicide Prevention Center in 1973. That procedure resulted in a near-unanimous judgment by the center staff that the most accurate certification of the death as described was \"probable suicide,\" which would then be certified as \"suicide.\" In this paper the assertion is made that Herman Melville himself had been a psychologically \"battered child\" and, in a way typical for battered children, psychologically battered his own children when it came his turn to be a parent. The further assertion is made that, for Malcolm, his father was suicidogenic; and established this penchant in Malcolm (through his neglect, active rejection, fearsomeness, and his fixed attention to his own writing--Redburn, White Jacket, and Moby Dick) within the first 2 years of Malcolm's life. For Malcolm, the psychological basis of his suicidal state was isolated desperation--a ubiquitous characteristic of most suicides. Malcolm had a deep unconscious feeling of not being wanted by his father; that it would be better if he were out of the way, dead. On the morning of his death, the choice for Malcolm was between the memory of his mother's kiss a few hours before and the terror of (and the need to protect himself against) his father's rage to come."
