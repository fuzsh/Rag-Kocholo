        "text": "GOVERNANCE: The Yavapai-Prescott Indian Tribe are governed by a President, Vice President, and three board members. Board members serve two-year terms, with elections held in July of even-numbered years. The Board meets the second Friday of each month. The Yavapai-Prescott Indian Tribe resides in Congressional District 4; Legislative District 1.\n\nCONSTITUTION:\n\nCOMMUNITY PROFILE: The Yavapai have lived in central and western Arizona for centuries. Today there are three primary groups of Yavapai: The Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation, the Yavapai-Apache Nation, and the Yavapai-Prescott Indian Tribe.\n\nThe Yavapai-Prescott Indian Reservation was established in 1935 on 75 acres of the former Fort Whipple Military Reserve. The Reservation was expanded to just under 1400 acres in 1956. According to the 2018-2022 U.S. Census, approximately 551 individuals live on Yavapai-Prescott Tribal land adjacent to Prescott, Arizona. The Reservation is 1,400 acres of rolling hills, of which several hundred acres have been closed to development in order to preserve the natural beauty of the area.\n\nAccording to the Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, in the past the Yavapai-Prescott Indian Tribe relied upon timber, mining, and agriculture. As tourism and retail services increased in Prescott, the Tribe's reliance on natural resources declined. Current enterprises include Bucky's Casino and Prescott Resort, Yavapai Casino, Sundog Business Park, and Frontier Village Shopping Center."
