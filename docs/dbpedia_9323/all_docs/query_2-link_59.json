        "text": "Posted at 20:10h in Prescott by Prescott Dentistry\n\nAt Prescott Dentistry we value the beautiful architecture that stands as a reminder of our origins and of our city’s historical roots, so we thought we’d give you an introduction to the history of Prescott. Whether you’ve lived in this city for your entire life or you’re new to our fair town, we hope you like our little tour of this beautiful city’s humble beginnings.\n\nPrescott got its start in the 1800 and 1900s as a stopover for cowboys, miners, and the many other people who were moving Westward. Quite a few of our streets in downtown Prescott are named for prominent people who helped establish the town of Prescott. The name of our city was given in honor of William H. Prescott, who is regarded as America’s first scientific historian (Encyclopedia Britannica, 2017). Territorial Governor John Noble Goodwin determined where Prescott should be located, and he also decided it should serve as the region’s capital. Prescott remained the capital of Arizona until 1889, minus a 10 year span from 1867- 1877, when the capitol was moved to Tuscon. Once Phoenix began to expand, the capital was moved to Phoenix, Arizona, where it has remained.\n\nDue to its proximity to mineral-rich mountains, Prescott is widely known for its roots in mining. When visiting downtown Prescott, you can also see the city’s rich ties to the West, since a number of the original historical buildings are still in use today. After major fires erupted in the early 1900s, some of the buildings in the downtown area were rebuilt using bricks as the construction material. Other fun facts about Prescott can be found by clicking on this link.\n\nWe’re glad Prescott treasures our historical buildings as a reminder of our roots and strong ties to the early Western culture of the United States. Our saloon-style buildings and our brick courthouse stand as reminders of the miners, cowboys, and other adventurers who forged new lives in America’s Wild West.\n\nAt Prescott Dentistry, we’re glad to meet our fellow Prescott residents. We invite you to stop by our conveniently located offices on Whipple Street. Incidentally, Whipple Street is named for Fort Whipple, a tactical army base in the Prescott area which was used in the mid-late 1800’s by the United States Cavalry during the indian wars. Or contact us with any questions you may have concerning your oral health care. Meanwhile, enjoy our fine city and all it has to offer!"
