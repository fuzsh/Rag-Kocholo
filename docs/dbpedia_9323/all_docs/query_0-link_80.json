Richard Ewell's Camp\n\n(1858), near Sawmill\n\nA temporary Federal encampment located 12 miles northwest of Fort Defiance (2), near Washington Pass.\n\nFort Defiance (2)\n\n(Navaho Indian Reservation)\n\n(1851 - 1861, 1863 - 1864), Fort Defiance\n\nThe first Federal fort in the state. A temporary camp was first established here in September 1851, a permanent post was begun in the spring of 1852. Located at the mouth of Cañon Bonito on the west side of Black Creek. Attacked by 1000 Navajo Indians in April 1860. Abandoned in April 1861 for Fort Fauntleroy, NM, but regarrisoned in July 1863 by New Mexico Volunteers under Col. Kit Carson, and renamed Fort Canby. Abandoned in October 1864 and then burned by the Indians, with only the walls remaining. In 1868 the abandoned post became the Navajo Indian Agency. The site is currently in use by the Navajo Nation as the Tribal Headquarters. All that currently remains of the old post is a three-story stone building from the Indian Agency period.\n\nCamp Mansfield\n\n(1863, 1868 ?), near St. Michaels\n\nA temporary camp located seven miles south of Fort Defiance (2), established by CA Volunteers. Also known as Camp at Corner Rock (1868 ?).\n\nHubbell Trading Post (National Historic Site)\n\n(Navajo Indian Reservation)\n\n(1878 - 1967/present), Ganado\n\nNot really a fort, but historically important in the developement of Arizona. Operated by the NPS since 1967. There are several trading posts on the Navajo Reservation, most are not of any historic importance.\n\n* Listed for historical interest only *\n\nCamp Canby\n\n(1863 - 1864), near Ganado ?\n\nA base of operations (July 1863 - October 1864) used by Col. Kit Carson and the NM Volunteers (1st Infantry) against the Navajo, supposedly located 28 miles southwest of Fort Defiance (2). Possibly existed as such only on maps of the period, as the then abandoned Fort Defiance (2) was known as \"Fort Canby\" by these same troops. Possibly also created as a ruse to confuse Confederate spies.\n\nCamp Florilla\n\n(1864), Kinlichee\n\nOne of Kit Carson's camps, located near Cross Canyon.\n\nCamp at Jacob's Well\n\n(1863), south of Sanders\n\nA NM Volunteers post ?\n\nCamp Supply (1)\n\n(1863), near Holbrook\n\nA temporary supply camp used by Kit Carson, located on the north bank of the Little Colorado River, two miles east of town.\n\nCamp Holbrook\n\n(1882), Holbrook\n\nA temporary Federal encampment (July 1882) (1st Infantry, Company K, and 3rd Cavalry, Troop H).\n\nJoseph City Fort\n\n(1860's ? or 1870's ?), Joseph City\n\nA Mormon settlers' fort. There was a site monument \"Old Fort\" listed in the records of the Daughters of Utah Pioneers.\n\nCamp Sunset\n\n(1858 - 1882, intermittent), near Winslow\n\nOriginally established by the Army's Camel Corps in 1858. Later used intermittently by trappers, Mormon settlers, and the military until the railroad came through the area in 1882. Located six miles east of town along the Little Colorado River. A post office was established here in 1876.\n\nCamp Colorado Chiquito\n\n(1863), near Winslow ?\n\nAn Army camp on the Little Colorado River at Canyon Diablo.\n\nCamp Schroeder\n\n(1858), Navajo Indian Reservation\n\nA temporary Federal camp (8th Infantry, Company V).

Exact location undetermined.\n\nLee's Fort\n\n(Glen Canyon National Recreational Area)\n\n(1871 - 1880's ?), Lee's Ferry\n\nA Mormon stone fort, restored by the National Park Service. It was built to protect the ferry that once operated here from 1871 - 1928. The ferry was run by John Doyle Lee, a wanted fugitive at the time, for only two years (1874 - 76) before he was captured by U.S. Marshalls and executed. The fort was converted to a trading post soon after.\n\nWinsor Castle\n\n(Pipe Spring National Monument)\n\n(1870 - 1888), Moccasin\n\nA Mormon-built red sandstone-walled fort with two double-story sandstone buildings. This isolated outpost served as a way station for people traveling across the Arizona Strip, that part of Arizona separated from the rest of the state by the Grand Canyon. It also served as a refuge for polygamist wives during the 1880s and 1890s. The LDS Church lost ownership of the property through penalties involved in the federal Edmunds-Tucker Act of 1887, and was sold off in 1888. Acquired by the NPS in 1923 with the creation of the park, which is completely surrounded by the Kaibab Paiute Indian Reservation (created in 1907). Preserved and maintained by the National Park Service.\n\nFort Garrett\n\n(unknown dates), near Pearce Ferry\n\nNot really a fort, it was a crude 12x14-foot rock shanty built on the north side of the Colorado River by a man named Garrett and Bill Shanley when they were living in that area. There are no roads leading to it. You must hike or go on horseback. Located within the 1976 addition to the Grand Canyon National Park.\n\nFort Mohave\n\n(1859 - 1861, 1863 - 1890), Fort Mohave\n\nA Federal fort on the Colorado River at Beale's Crossing to protect the ferry to Needles, California. It was abandoned and burned in May 1861, the troops transferring to Los Angeles, CA to quell a civil disturbance there. It was initially known as Camp Colorado (1) (April 1859). Renamed Camp Mohave (May 1863 - April 1879) after the post was reactivated by CA Volunteers. This post was most likely the \"Fort Navajo\" that Gen. James Carleton described in 1862 dispatches, to mislead Confederate spies in California. Adobe structures were built in 1870. Abandoned in May 1890, turned over to the Fort Mohave Indian Reservation in September 1890 for use as an Indian school, but closed in 1935. The buildings were torn down in 1942, but some ruins remain.\n\n(NOTE: \"Mohave\" is generally spelled today with an \"h\" east of the Colorado River, and spelled with a \"j\" west of the Colorado River. Both are pronounced the same. However, it was almost always spelled with a \"j\" in U.S. War Department records.)\n\nFort Silver\n\n(1863), near Oatman\n\nA rock cabin used by Army troops (CA Volunteers) from Fort Mohave while prospecting for silver, located in the hills along Silver Creek about five miles north of town. The door frame lintel was engraved with \"US ARMY\". The stone ruins were last reported still extant in 1979.\n\nCamp Colorado (2)\n\n(1868 - 1871), Parker\n\nA Federal tent camp, originally called Camp on the Colorado River, located on the Colorado River just west of town. Established in November 1868 by the 14th Infantry, Company H. Replaced by the 12th Infantry, Company G, until April 1871.\n\nCamp La Paz\n\n(1874 - 1875), La Paz\n\nA temporary CA state militia camp and supply depot (4th Infantry, Companies F and G) (April 1874 - May or September 1875) located at an old mining town, about ten miles north of Ehrenberg, consisting of adobe structures which had recently been abandoned at the time. Between 1862 and 1870 this was the site of a large colony of gold prospectors before it was abandoned. Portions of the ghost town were excavated by the National Park Service and the Chemehuevi Indian Nation in 1971.\n\nCamp Lincoln (1), a subpost of Fort Yuma, was temporarily established here in May-August 1864 by the CA Volunteers (4th Infantry, Company F).\n\nDetachment at Ehrenberg\n\n(1875 - 1877), Ehrenberg\n\nA temporary military detachment post to oversee supply shipments coming in from California, as the Colorado River had shifted course at La Paz, necessitating a new depot site. A Quartermaster storehouse was washed away in a flood in the early 1900's.\n\nFort Tyson\n\n(1856), Quartzsite\n\nA fortified Butterfield - Overland stage station (aka Tyson's Well Station), which was operated by Charles Tyson. A small museum is currently located in the original building. Also here is the gravesite of Hadji Ali (aka \"Hi Jolly\"), a Syrian camel owner who helped the U.S. Army try to use camels instead of horses in the desert during the 1850's.\n\nCamp Alexander\n\n(1867), near McConnico ?\n\nA temporary Federal camp located between Fort Mohave and Camp Beale's Springs.\n\nCamp Beale's Springs\n\n(1871 - 1874), near Kingman\n\nSome ruins remain of this fortified stage station located a few miles northwest of town off of US 93 (site marked). The Army (12th Infantry, Company F) also built 12 adobe buildings with shingle roofs and a three-tent hospital (March 1871 - April 1874). Another website at GhostTowns.com\n\nCamp Peach Springs\n\n(1894), Peach Springs\n\nA temporary subpost of Fort Whipple (11th Infantry, Company B), it lasted about one month (July-August 1894).\n\nCamp Willow Grove\n\n(1867 - 1869), southeast of Valentine\n\nA temporary Federal (14th Infantry, Company E) tent camp (August 1867). In 1868 the 8th Cavalry, Companies E, F, and K also occupied the site, until withdrawn in October 1869. Site is located on the north side of Willow Creek on private property, about 40 miles east of Kingman. Site excavated in 1966 by the Museum of Northern Arizona. Some ruins (stone fireplace pits) still remain.\n\nFort Rock Spring\n\n(1866 ?), southwest of Seligman\n\nCamp Rock Spring was a temporary camp and stage stop, located about two miles south of the Camp Willow Grove site. Shown on some maps, but probably never actually garrisoned by any Army troops.\n\nFort Rock\n\n(1864), Fort Rock, southwest of Seligman\n\nA settlers' defense against Indians. Located about 60 miles northwest of Prescott along the present Mohave - Yavapai county line. Most likely the same site as above.\n\nFort Moroni\n\n(1881 - 1887 ?), Fort Valley\n\nA civilian log stockade located seven miles northwest of Flagstaff in what came to be known as \"Fort Valley\". It was built under the direction of John Willard Young while heading a group of Mormons cutting railroad ties in the area. It became headquarters for his Moroni Cattle Company (1881 - 1883). After being sold to the Arizona Cattle and Wood Company, it was renamed Fort Rickerson and the walls were cut to fence height by 1887. No physical evidence of the fort is present today.\n\n(thanks to John Vankat for additional info)\n\nCamp at Bear Spring\n\n(1863 - 1864), near Flagstaff\n\nA temporary military encampment, believed to be located at today's Elden Spring, located four miles northeast of town.\n\nCamp Tuthill\n\n(Coconino County Park and Recreation Area)\n\n(1928 - 1955), near Flagstaff\n\nAn Arizona National Guard training area on 426 acres with two dozen buildings, located south of the city along AZ 89A. Known as Fort Tuthill from 1929-1948. Site now a county park and fairgrounds, adjacent to Pulliam Municipal Airport. The original Mess Halls are now used as exhibit buildings, and the old Infirmary is now the Coconino County Parks and Recreation Department office.\n\nCamp on Lake Carleton\n\n(1866 ?), Mormon Lake\n\nA temporary Army camp noted on some maps, probably never actually built.\n\nCamp on Oak Creek\n\n(1881), near Sedona\n\nA temporary subpost of Fort Verde (June-July 1881), located in Oak Creek Canyon. Occupied by the 12th Infantry, Company K, and the 6th Cavalry, Companies H and L.\n\nCamp Pomeroy\n\n(1863), southern Coconino County\n\nA temporary camp (November-December) for the Army (CA Volunteers) wagon trains during the establishment of the first Fort Whipple on Cienega Creek. Exact location unknown. The wagon road from Antelope Springs (present-day Flagstaff) to Chino Valley (Fort Whipple) had proven to be very rough, and half the load of each wagon had to be left behind under guard to be retrieved later.\n\nCamp Hualpai\n\n(Prescott National Forest)\n\n(1869 - 1873), Juniper, south of Seligman\n\nAn Army (8th Cavalry) tent camp first known as Camp Devin (May 1869), then two weeks later renamed Camp Toll Gate, until August 1870. Abandoned in July 1873. Located on a mesa overlooking Walnut (Mohave) Creek, one and one-half miles southeast of Aztec Pass and northeast of Mount Hope, in the Juniper Mountains within the present-day Prescott National Forest on the Old Military Trail #1 off of Forest Road 95, about two miles west of its junction with Forest Road 6. Sometimes referred to as Fort Hualpai in official reports (note spelling - the Indian tribe of that name is spelled \"Hualapai\"). Some rock foundations and fireplace pits still remain. A post office for the town of Juniper was established here in 1882 - 1883.\n\nLocated here or nearby in 1881 was Camp on Walnut Creek.\n\nCamp Rawlins\n\n(1870 - 1871), near Simmons\n\nA temporary subpost of Whipple Barracks established in February 1870, located 17 miles southeast of Camp Hualpai, in the Williamson Valley west of Paulden. Occupied by the 3rd Cavalry, Companies C and G, during April-August 1870.\n\nCamp Date Creek\n\n(1867 - 1873), Date Creek, and Skull Valley\n\nA Federal post established in January 1867, originally as Camp McPherson located about three miles north of the Date Creek settlement. After only two months (March 1867) the post moved 25 miles north to Skull Valley, following the movements of the Indians, and was renamed Camp Skull Valley. It moved back to Date Creek after only two months (May 1867), the former camp name being restored (?), or now simply known as Camp on Date Creek. The camp was relocated again in August 1867. In 1868 it was moved again, but still along Date Creek. It was formally named Camp Date Creek in November 1868. Occupied in 1868 by the 14th Infantry, Companies H and I. The Date Creek Agency and Indian Reservation was established nearby in 1871 for the Yavapai (also known as the Apache-Mohave) and Hualapai Indians. Some rock walls and adobe ruins, as well as the post cemetery, still remain at the final (fourth) site on the O X Ranch property (private), about 1.4 miles past the ranch headquarters.

Hospital)\n\n(1864 - 1898, 1902 - 1918), Prescott\n\nFirst established in December 1863 and originally located about 20 miles north of town on Cienega Creek near Del Rio Ranch north of Chino Valley (no remains, site marked). The first post was composed of a tent camp for the soldiers while construction was begun on several log buildings; a Quartermaster storehouse, Commissary storehouse, hospital, carpenter and blacksmith shops, and corrals for the oxen, mules, beef cattle and sheep brought in from New Mexico. A guardhouse and kitchen were built with stone. This original post also briefly served as the Arizona Territorial Capital from January to May 1864 before the government was transferred to the newly established town of Prescott. The military post was relocated in May 1864 to its present site on Granite Creek on the Yavapai Indian Reservation. The former site on Cienega Creek was then officially renamed Camp Clark, although it may have been known by that name as early as August 1863 when the site was first surveyed by John Clark and a company of CA Volunteers under Capt. Nathaniel Pishon. Further use of the Camp Clark site after 1864 is not documented.\n\nThe new post on Granite Creek was a large rectangular pine-log stockade about 200 feet square with several log buildings on each side of the enclosed parade ground. The post hospital was located outside of the stockade. Several stock corrals were also bullt. This site was sometimes also referred to as Camp Whipple. The post was torn down and completely rebuilt in 1869, and was officially designated headquarters of the Military Department of Arizona in April 1870. The adjacent Whipple Quartermaster Depot (also built in 1864) became a separate command from Fort Whipple in October 1870. The Whipple Depot burned down in April 1872 but was rebuilt on a new site by July, and was later renamed Prescott Barracks in 1878. It was merged with Fort Whipple into one reservation called Whipple Barracks in April 1879. The 1st Arizona Territorial Volunteer Infantry were mustered-in here in July 1898. The post was abandoned by the Regular Army in March 1898, but regarrisoned in 1902. Placed on care-taker status in February 1913. A U.S. Army General Hospital was established at Whipple Barracks in 1918. The Public Health Service took over the hospital in 1920, and then the Veterans' Bureau in 1922. In 1931 the newly formed Veterans Administration took over all hospital operations from the War Department. The post is also commonly referred to as the Fort Whipple Hospital.
