        "text": "Today we explored a former railroad track near the Yavapai College Trail that we visited yesterday. We walked only a short distance into the Prescott VA Medical Center grounds before encountering a fence. Near the baseball diamond we discovered an historic gate facing land north owned by the Yavapai Prescott Indian tribe. The gate was rededicated in October 1993 as an Eagle Scout Project by Nathan van den Berg and Troop 7. The plaque reads as follows:\n\nGeneral Order #27\n\nThe recent discovery of gold near the San Francisco Mountains within the District of Northern Arizona and the flocking thither of many citizens of the United States … renders it necessary that a small military force should be sent to these new gold fields to preserve order and give security to life and property in that region until the civil officers of Arizona now enroute from the east shall arrive and set in motion the machinery of civil government … The troops to go to the new gold fields will establish at or near them a military post which will be known as FORT WHIPPLE in honor of Brig. Gen. Amiel W. Whipple who fell in the Battle of Chancellorsville and who as a 1st Lieutenant of Topographical Engineers in 1853 explored the road leading from Albuquerque, New Mexico, through the country of these new gold fields.\n\nJames R. Carlton\n\nBrigadier-General Commanding\n\nOctober, 1863\n\nThere is another gate near the Yavapai College Performing Arts Center. A small bunny tasted the grass on a lawn as we followed sidewalk through the Prescott Veterans Affairs Medical Center grounds. We returned to Yavapai College via a connecting walkway along 89A. It is fun to imagine what Prescott’s early territorial history was like."
