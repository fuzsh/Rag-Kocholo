SHPO and participating federal agencies will provide updates (what’s new, what’s coming down the pike) as well as briefs on survey and reporting standards. Consultant Q & A. Moderated by Kim Ryan. Arizona Room, Hassayampa Inn\n\n1 pm to 5 pm\n\nCLG Training (Arianna Urban). Intended for Certified Local Government staff and members of historic preservation commissions, this training session will focus on the ins and outs of running a successful historic preservation program at the local level. SHPO staff will be presenting on archaeological compliance, design review for historic districts, educational programs, CLG grant opportunities, historic preservation plans, design guidelines, zoning ordinances, local designation, and how each component works together to build a strong citywide preservation program. Please bring your questions, ideas, and concerns, as we learn about the unique challenges and opportunities Arizona's CLGs face. Marina Room, Hassayampa Inn\n\nAssessing Historic Masonry Buildings for Adaptive Reuse (Chris Schrager). This workshop will introduce condition assessments of historic masonry buildings, to determine their viability for adaptive reuse and interpretation. We have an opportunity to walk through the 1910s-constructed Bucky O’Neill Hotel on Cortez St. with its private owner, who is rehabilitating the property. Participants will be able to see the historic elements that convey integrity of design, materials, and workmanship, as well as discuss methods by which older structures can be brought up to modern safety standards within the context of preserving their character-defining features. We will also discuss how some architectural features are intrinsic to the stories that historic structures covey. There will be three one-hour “tours” of the building, each with a maximum of ten participants, starting at 1 pm, 2 pm, and 3 pm. 226 N. Cortez St.\n\nToward Reconciling Differing Views on Yavapai Origins Symposium (Organized by Scott Kwiatkowski and Albert Nelson). Yavapai elders rarely meet with anthropologists. Perhaps as a result, there has long been a disconnect between Yavapai views of their genetic and cultural origins and the beliefs of many anthropologists and archaeologists. Using formal presentations, this symposium will explore, analyze, and discuss diverse perspectives on who the Yavapai people are, when and where they originated, how they articulate with prehistoric archaeological cultures, and related topics. Yavapai elders will get the last word in a roundtable discussion. Gathering Center, Yavapai-Prescott Indian Tribe, 530 E. Merritt, Prescott\n\n5:30 pm to 8 pm\n\nKeystone Awards Reception. The Elisabeth Ruffner Keystone Award for Community Leadership honors individuals whose commercial, political, philanthropic, artistic, planning, or advocacy efforts have contributed to their communities' quality of life, sense of place, and heritage appreciation. In construction, the keystone connects and stabilizes the whole, providing necessary support and strength. The Keystone Award recognizes community leaders whose motivation and passion have fostered the resources and connections necessary for preservation to thrive within their communities. The award's namesake, Elisabeth Ruffner, is a tireless advocate for historic preservation who has devoted her public life to enhancing her hometown of Prescott, AZ.

Geared towards archaeological beginners, non-practitioners, and those wanting a refresher. Sundance Room, Elks Performing Arts Center\n\nIntersections Between Planning & Preservation: Prescott's 2025 General Plan & Historic Master Plan Updates (Kaylee Nunez, George Worley, Tammy DeWitt). This will be a three-part presentation from City of Prescott's Planning & Preservation staff. We will be discussing the City's 2025 General Plan update; specifically, why it is important to integrate Preservation into the update and the importance of Preservation in our community. We are also updating our Historic Preservation Master Plan (HPMP), aiming to be done in 2025 as well. We will discuss the contents of the HPMP update as well as the details of the public hearing & participation process for such, including the launch of ARCHES data platform that will house Prescott's Preservation data. Lastly, we will discuss how we bring Planning & Preservation together in daily practice & how we will be looking towards enhanced technologies to deliver information from both Divisions to the public moving forward. Arizona Room, Hassayampa Inn\n\nPlanning Revelry: The Monroe Street Abbey (Terry Goddard, Eddie Jones, Maria Salenger, Chris Winters, Dan Patry, Joseph Sembrat, Ean Frank, Susan Lawson). Constructed in 1929, the First Baptist Church was placed on the National Register of Historical Places in 1982 for exemplifying a progressive concept of the religious auditorium supporting evangelism through staged presentation. Dramatic effects were made possible for pageantry and church plays within the Italian Gothic revival structure. Years after the congregation moved out of downtown Phoenix, the building caught fire and the roof collapsed. The Nonprofit Housing Opportunity Center, led by former Phoenix Mayor and Attorney General Terry Goddard, acquired the building in 1992, saving it from demolition and has been working on the redevelopment ever since. Over the years, nature planted a garden inside the towering auditorium open to the sky. Seeing the potential of the place as an armature for community to engage and a secret garden to grow in the city, the project team opens the Monroe Street Abbey to the public this year as a remarkable event space. Marina Room, Hassayampa Inn\n\n11:40 am to 1:40 pm\n\nLunch on your own\n\n​\n\nNoon to 1:30 pm\n\nFt. Whipple Walking Tour (Kat Ferguson, Tom Kistner). Step back in time and explore a part of the storied grounds of Historic Fort Whipple in Prescott, Arizona, established in 1864 to protect settlers and miners in the newly established territorial capital of Arizona. Led by Archaeologist Kat Ferguson and Facilities Manager Tom Kistner. The tour will begin at the Officers’ Quarters, a series of residences built at the turn of the 20th century, which are currently being renovated to house Veterans in need. It will also cover other buildings that offer insight to past life at the Fort, including medical facilities and the newly reopened Ft. Whipple Museum. Kat will give an overview of the Archaeological importance of the site, being formerly occupied by the Yavapai-Prescott Indian tribe. The tribe still maintains a reservation of a little under 1500 acres immediately to the west of the Ft. Whipple/VA property.\n\nTime: 12 p.m. to 1:30 p.m.\n\nMeeting Location: At Ft. Whipple, park near Building 11/Officers Quarters (booth attendant can help direct you)\n\nMaximum participants: 20\n\nSelf-transportation, walking, wear comfortable shoes, wear sunscreen, and bring water.\n\nADA/accessibility: Yes\n\nHosts: Kat Ferguson (MS, RPA), Project Integrator for AZ VA; Tom Kistner, Project Manager for Prescott VA Facilities\n\n​\n\n1:40 pm to 2:50 pm\n\nAre You Ready for Changes to the NAGPRA Regulations? (Reylynne Williams, Angela Garcia-Lewis, Martha Martinez, Darius Enos). Tribal Historic Preservation Offices of the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community and the Gila River Indian Community will continue the discussion from the 2023 AZHPC on developing a NAGPRA Plan of Action and/or NAGPRA Comprehensive Agreement. The new NAGPRA Regulations Subpart B are in effect. Let's Navigate this together! Crystal Hall, Elks Performing Arts Center\n\nBeale Wagon Road: Preservation Challenges of a Well-Travelled Route (David Purcell). The Beale Wagon Road pioneered travel on the 35th Parallel route, later traversed by the Atlantic & Pacific Railway, National Old Trails Highway, Route 66, and Interstate 40. With so much development within the same corridor, what remains of this iconic road and how are the remaining segments being preserved? Sundance Room, Elks Performing Arts Center\n\nAcknowledging the Past for an Inclusive Future (Rikki Riojas, Alisha Vasquez). Historic preservation as a movement has, in practice excluded the communities it aims to serve through its planning efforts. This session analyzes the importance of acknowledging the past harm historic preservation has caused community through exclusion in cultural projects. Without acknowledgement and conscious effort, the excluded communities remain hesitant to participate in future projects. Los Descendientes De Tucson’s Mexican American Museum will share how their Community Charlas or “talks” provide means of acknowledging the past harm historic preservation has caused while giving a means for genuine inclusion of community input moving forward. Through the creation of new these foundations, administrators can allow community lead preservation and programming and start to heal the networks broken over 50 years ago. Arizona Room, Hassayampa Inn\n\nThe Navajo Bridge (Jerry Cannon). This session is about the Navajo Bridge crossing over the Colorado River. There are two bridges named as one, span a remote canyon in Arizona. The first, built in 1928, linked Arizona to southern Utah. As vehicles became wider and carried larger loads, the narrow roadway and small load capacity made it inadequate for modern traffic. ADOT built a new parallel bridge in 1994, keeping the first as a pedestrian crossing. Both bridges span the Grand Canyon. The bridge built in 1928 is Arizona's most historic bridge. Marina Room, Hassayampa Inn\n\n3:10 pm to 4:20 pm\n\nWildfires and Archaeological Sites: Planning Site Protection in a Wildfire Environment (John Rose, Levi Guffey, Jason Nez, Ashley Stabenow, Ashley Schuchardt, Jason Williams ). This session discusses the planning involved in assessing and protecting heritage sites before, during, and after wildfire incidents. Crystal Hall, Elks Performing Arts Center\n\nPreserving the Spirit of Place: Heritage Resources and the Sonoran Desert Conservation Plan (Ian Milliken). The award-winning Sonoran Desert Conservation Plan (SDCP) is Pima County’s plan for balancing the conservation and protection of our cultural and natural resource heritage with our efforts to maintain an economically vigorous and fiscally responsible community. The plan affirmed that Pima County’s non-renewable multicultural heritage resources are a vital part of our community’s collective identity and are worthy of preservation for current and future generations. In this session, we reflect on the plan’s achievements and failures through a presentation of its development, 20+ years of implementation, and its future. Sundance Room, Elks Performing Arts Center\n\nPlanning the Past, Preserving the Future: Prescott's Western Heritage Foundation and Center, A Success Story (Drew Desmond, Stuart Rosebrook, Dennis Gallagher). Since May 2019, when the Western Heritage Center opened on historic Whiskey Row, one of the primary goals has been engage the public with Yavapai County heritage and history nonprofit organizations. The mission of WHC – a non-profit, public history organization managed entirely by volunteers and financed by donations – is to share and promote the stories of the past, present, and future with exhibits, education, public events, presentations, and lectures. From the beginning, WHC board leadership has worked closely with local museums and heritage organizations to showcase their collections and drive visitation and participation. Additionally, WHC has been open and welcoming to private collectors who believe in the organization’s mission and agreed to loan their private collections for exhibit at WHC. The result has led to greater public involvement and interest in WHC's educational mission and greater awareness of the public’s role in preserving local history for future generations. Arizona Room, Hassayampa Inn\n\nRehabilitation of the 1931 Prescott Post Office & Federal Courthouse (Bill Otwell). The United States Post Office declared the structure as surplus when the upper 2 floors housing the Federal Court, Marshall and associated agencies vacated the space. This initiated a long process to sell the property. Local preservation enthusiasts Ty Fitzmorris and Newt Lynn purchased the building as is including the law library and all fixtures and furnishings. Ty and Newt previously commissioned Otwell Associates to restore other Prescott historic properties including the Raven Cafe, Peregrine Bookstore, and Natural History Institute. The presentation by Bill Otwell will touch on the process of rehabilitation from the discovery of complete original architectural plans, construction photos and full-scale shop drawings in the basement though the design and construction efforts. The result is a repurposed structure that is a good example of preserving every aspect of a resource while providing an enjoyable environment for the new tenants. Ty and Newt offered to share the lobby with the Post Office, so we still have the use of the first purpose built postal facility in Prescott. Marina Room, Hassayampa Inn\n\n4:30 pm to 5:30 pm\n\nGovernor's Heritage Preservation Honor Awards. Since 1982, the Arizona Preservation Foundation and State Historic Preservation Office have partnered to present the Governor’s Heritage Honor Preservation Awards. The awards recognize people, organizations, and projects that represent outstanding achievements in preserving Arizona’s historic resources. Elks Theater\n\n6 pm to 8 pm\n\nReception. Join us for the main conference reception after the Governor’s Awards. Marina Room, Hassayampa Theater\n\n8 pm to 10 pm\n\nMovie – Red Rock West. Though taking place in Wyoming, Red Rock West was filmed in places in southern Arizona like Elgin, Canelo and, most prominently, Wilcox. The 1993 film stars Nicholas Cage as a down-on-his-luck drifter mistaken for a hit man until the real hit man shows up. Also starring, Dennis Hopper, Laura Flynn Boyle, and J. T. Walsh, this twisty neo-noir has been hard to find for decades. Join us for a rare opportunity to see a true gem of forgotten cinema. Elks Theater\n\nThursday, June 27\n\n7 am to 8:30 am\n\nDowntown Walking Tour (Bill Otwell). Join Bill Otwell, renowned local preservation architect, for a walking tour of Prescott's historic downtown We’ll traverse the charming streets and vibrant plaza that have witnessed over 150 years of Prescott’s history unfold. Amidst the bustling Plaza, we'll discover gems like iconic Whiskey Row, where saloons and boarding houses once catered to the needs of pioneers and prospectors. Each building tells a story, offering glimpses into Prescott's evolution from a rough-and-tumble frontier town to a thriving cultural hub. Our journey will also take us past landmarks such as the historic St. Michael's Hotel, the Knights of Pythias building, the Bashford Block and will end at the United States Post Office, a Depression Era Beaux Arts masterpiece. The USPS was recently restored by Otwell’s firm and won a Governor’s Honor Preservation Award in 2022.\n\nTime: 7 a.m. to 8:30 a.m.\n\nMeeting Location: Hassayampa Inn Lobby\n\nMaximum participants: 25\n\nWalk to the meeting site, wear comfortable shoes, wear sunscreen and bring water.\n\nADA/accessibility: Yes\n\nHost: Bill Otwell, Principal, Otwell & Associates Architects\n\nWillow Lake Tour (Scott Courtright). Prior to development of park facilities at Willow Lake in 2003, archaeological testing and data recovery excavations occurred within a Prescott Culture habitation site that contained 21 residential structures occupied between A.D. 800 and the early A.D. 1200s. The archaeological investigation took place where two parking areas and recreational facilities were planned. When the City of Prescott learned that such a substantial site was present and that there was widespread community interest in the site, the location of one parking lot and some facilities was modified and an archaeological interpretative site was proposed. The interpretive site ended up consisting of interpretive signage and permanent ramadas constructed over three of the excavated pit houses. This tour will include a visit to the interpretive site, discussion about what was learned about the inhabitants of the site, and how public interest in archaeology can lead to the preservation of sites that would otherwise be destroyed by development. Meeting location to be determined.\n\n8:30 am to 10 am\n\nKeynote Speaker (Bonnie McDonald). Over her 11-year tenure as President & CEO, Bonnie McDonald has led Landmarks Illinois to become a statewide and national voice for relevant change at this inflection point for the preservation movement. Bonnie’s transformative leadership has led Landmarks Illinois to focus on people and their vital connection to place, and to develop collaborative solutions addressing community concerns like climate change, affordable housing, and lack of access to capital. Elks Theater\n\n10:30 am to 11:40 am\n\nLeveraging AZGeo for Historic Preservation (Kasey Green, Ian Milliken, Helen Erickson). The AZGeo Data Hub is Arizona’s official State Geospatial Clearinghouse. It is an initiative of the Arizona Geographic Information Council (AGIC) and was developed in partnership with the Arizona State Land Department. AZGeo provides access to online map services, FGDC compliant metadata, geospatial data downloads, and applications which are utilized by municipal, regional state and tribal governments, private companies, and the public to support the needs of Arizona’s citizens. This presentation will highlight three examples of how AZGeo is being leveraged to support historic preservation in Arizona: SHPO Historic Properties Map Viewer, Camp Naco, and National Historic Butterfield Trail. Crystal Hall, Elks Performing Arts Center\n\nStations, Trails, and Conservation Challenges in Pima County’s Cienega Creek Natural Preserve (Courtney Rose). Following the guiding preservation principles of the Sonoran Desert Conservation Plan (SDCP), Pima County is developing management plans for conservation lands under the regulatory component of the Multi-Species Conservation Plan (MSCP), with goals promoting long-term conservation of natural resources and cultural heritage. One such plan includes the Cienega Creek Natural Preserve, a unique place with flowing water, riparian vegetation, and rich in cultural heritage with many ancestral sites—including trails. The Butterfield Overland National Historic Trail (1858-1861), signed into law in 2023, runs through the Preserve, making it a pivot point for cultural heritage interpretation, as there are important stories of the land that came before, during, and after the Butterfield Trail. This presentation will discuss agency collaboration, site stewards, and challenges in creating and implementing interpretive plans while staying focused on the primary goal of conservation. Sundance Room, Elks Performing Arts Center\n\nPlanning Together: Integrating Site Planning and Interpretive Planning at Taliesin West (Rebecca Barron, Ashley Pelletier). In January 2024 the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation (FLWF) and Sasaki began working together to envision the future for the Taliesin West property, Frank Lloyd Wright’s winter home and desert laboratory in Scottsdale, AZ through the development of Comprehensive Site Master Plan. The decision to develop this plan now, aligns with state and local planning agendas, ongoing operational and preservation challenges, and changing ecological conditions, as well as the development of a new Interpretive Master Plan for the site following extensive audience research in 2019. Developing these two plans in tandem is critical, so that the Foundation can change and grow by developing new modes of engagement and multi-layered tour programs, while also maintaining their commitment to best practices in historic preservation and sustainable site management as outlined in the Taliesin West Preservation Master Plan. This presentation, co-presented by the Foundation and Sasaki will provide an overview of Phase 1 of the process, outline the next steps in Phase 2, and reflect on the lessons learned while working together to further Wright’s Legacy of innovation and sustainable development over the next 10 years. Arizona Room, Hassayampa Inn\n\nCamp Naco Progress Update: Strategic Planning & Design Process (Brooks Jeffery, Corky Poster). Camp Naco is a cornerstone of Buffalo Soldier history in Arizona and represents the proud tradition of Black military regiments after the Civil War. The Camp’s 17-acre site and 100+ year-old adobe buildings sit just 600 yards north of the US-Mexico border in the community of Naco Arizona and reside on the ancestral lands of the Chiricahua Apache. In 2022, the City of Bisbee and Naco Heritage Alliance received $8.1M in funding support, initiating a 4-year journey to (1) Preserve and rehabilitate the site’s 20 buildings and open spaces; (2) Develop place-based programming to reactivate the site by interpreting its diverse cultural landscape and addressing community needs; and (3) Build organizational capacity to successfully sustain Camp Naco’s mission into the future. This session will provide a Year 2 progress update on the project including the strategic planning and design process efforts to translate the above goals into reality. Marina Room, Hassayampa Inn\n\n11:40 am to 1:40 pm\n\nLunch on your own\n\n1:40 pm to 2:50 pm\n\nA Valley of Data: Applying GIS Data to Understanding Prehistoric Settlements in the City of Phoenix (Laurene Montero, Lauren Tennison, Stephanie Sherwood). Phoenix is within the ancestral lands of the O’Odham, and this buried cultural landscape has yielded considerable data through decades of archaeological research. Recognizing that the more we can learn about prehistoric settlement in the lower Salt River Valley, the better we can plan for preservation, education, and management of these nonrenewable resources, PMAP was created. This project includes a team of working and retired professionals with the goal of applying modern analytical GIS techniques towards an understanding of prehistoric settlements. Members of our team, in collaboration with representatives from SRPMIC and GRIC THPO, created a story map using PMAP data to educate the public about the rich cultural heritage of Phoenix. Beginning with digitization of the village of S’edav Va’aki, PMAP plans to include mapping at the artifact level and within other archaeological sites so that we may continue to learn about the prehistory of Phoenix. Crystal Hall, Elks Performing Arts Center\n\nLiving Landscapes: Documenting Cultural Landscape Features During Class I and Class III Survey (Avi Buckles, Shane Anton, Bernadette Carra, LeRoy Shingoitewa, Holly Houghton). Cultural resources baseline studies traditionally include only information on archaeological and historical resources. Information pertaining to non-archaeological tribal perspectives on the landscape is often lacking in traditional Class I desktop and Class III pedestrian surveys. Traditional views of the landscape and tribal heritage, however, involve much more than just archaeological sites and historical records. As noted by many early cultural geographers like Carl Sauer, and as known for millennia by traditional knowledge keepers, people and culture are innately tied to the natural landscape, the plants, the animals, the hills, and the water sources. Indeed, to many tribal people in the Southwest these natural resources are the very reason their ancestors flourished, and they are innately tied into their ancestral sites, cultural traditions, and spirituality. Federal agencies, state agencies, SHPOs, and private companies are increasingly acknowledging the importance of cultural landscapes during project planning and consultation with Native American tribes. This session focuses on best practices to collect data on cultural landscape during desktop and pedestrian surveys. Culturally significant plant reviews, identification and recording of spring areas (including seasonal springs), photographic or drone documentation of prominent landforms, and review of Native American place names are easily attainable data collection strategies that show respect to tribal history and heritage, not just archaeological research. WestLand cultural resources staff will share these best practices and suggest further avenues for documenting aspects of cultural landscapes that will be of interest and use to tribes, agencies, and private landowners during project planning. Sundance Room, Elks Performing Arts Center\n\nSaving Structures Can Be a Moving Experience (Duffie Westheimer, Garrett Denny). Moving structures should be considered as a preservation solution. This keeps them out of landfills, serving the community, and preserving community history. Moving structures also preserves the energy they embody — “sustainability” at its best. Structure relocator Garrett Denny is a 5th generation Arizonian, and 2nd generation structure relocator. His experience extends to construction so he can speak to every aspect of the processes of moving and restoring. He has moved small and large buildings as well as a train! He has stories to tell. Duffie Westheimer will speak to and show images of the projects GR Denny and Son have done for Flagstaff’s Townsite CLT, and nearby. Townsite CLT’s work is meeting our charitable mission of preserving our community by showing what can be done with historic properties, which includes lifting, and moving structures. Arizona Room, Hassayampa Inn\n\nLessons Learned the Hard Way: Common Mistakes with Historic Tax Credits (Alison Dunleavy). Historic Tax Credits are an important tool for heritage preservation, encouraging the preservation of historic structures while providing financial incentives for redevelopment. However, without an effective plan in place, historic tax credit projects can go from complex to impossible. As preservation consultants, we have seen it all – clients, contractors, consultants, who have innocently (and not so innocently) jeopardized millions in historic tax credits. Join us for an entertaining and irreverent session on what NOT to do if you want to emerge successful in the historic tax credit experience. This session promises practical experience based on real life situations from a fun-loving preservation consultant. Marina Room, Hassayampa Inn\n\n3 pm to 5:30 pm\n\nCharlie Ben Wilson House Tour (Scott Kwitakowski, Bill Otwell, Pat Dahlen, Roanna Weahkee). The Charlie Ben Wilson house was one of five residential structures constructed during the Great Depression on what is now that Yavapai-Prescott Indian Reservation as part of Civil Works Administration (CWA) public works project #P-43. Abandoned since 1965, the house was documented to State standards in 2013, and was restored in 2015 by Greseth Builders under the direction of Otwell Associates, Architects. This will be the first public tour allowed for the historic property. During the tour, topics of discussion will include the history of CWA Project P-43, how the transition from traditional to Western-style housing occurred, construction of the project’s Historic Building Preservation Plan, how the restoration project was funded, and what occurred during the restoration. Additionally, Charlie Ben Wilson’s adopted granddaughter will remember her grandfather and the time she spent in the house growing up. Self-driving. 530 E. Merritt St.\n\n3:10 pm to 4:20 pm\n\nPlanning for the Future: Archaeological Collections Curation for Cultural Resource Management (Chris Caseldine). Federal and state laws and regulations require curating archaeological collections in perpetuity. Since at least the latter part of the twentieth century, the museum world recognized that archaeological practices would soon lead to a precarious position – a lack of space to curate collections. This has led to repositories in Arizona being reluctant to issue new curation agreements or only accepting collections mandated by statute. The proliferation of projects requiring a curation facility has led to a difficult situation for cultural resource management firms and land managers.

Our project focuses on implementing historic preservation in interior design education, using Arizona State University's senior design studio as a case study. In the themed project 'The Rebirth of the First Baptist Church,' students collaborate with the Children's Museum of Phoenix in Spring 2023 and The Design School at ASU in Spring 2024 to transform the 'wounded' building into a new educational space. Throughout the course, students engage in multiple self-reflection activities to comprehend heritage trauma and develop design strategies for passing on the building’s history to the next generation. Notably, this course (1) allows students to approach historic preservation projects from the 'inside' – addressing both the interior spaces and their inner selves, (2) highlights the significant role of interior designers who showcase nuanced design approaches in preserving and reusing historic interiors, and (3) challenges students to act as heritage educators, inspiring us preservationists with their creativity and unique strategies.

Join us in a thought-provoking session that delves into the pivotal role of tracking historic preservation projects as a cornerstone in community planning. Discover the importance of vigilantly monitoring threatened buildings, maintaining a watchful eye on structures of interest, and celebrating the success stories of preservation initiatives. In this session, we will spotlight the Arizona Preservation Foundation's groundbreaking initiative – the \"Preservation Tracker.\" This statewide tool promises to revolutionize how communities engage with and safeguard their architectural heritage. By categorizing buildings based on critical factors such as date of construction, historical significance, architectural style, ownership, and building type, the Preservation Tracker empowers communities to make informed decisions and shape a collective vision for the future. Be part of this transformative movement by contributing to the Preservation Tracker. Learn how your community can actively participate, adding key historic or vintage buildings of interest and concern into the system. This interactive session aims to ignite a sense of responsibility for our architectural legacy and inspire collaboration for the betterment of our communities. Together, let's build a more resilient future while honoring the rich tapestry of our past. Marina Room 1, Hassayampa Inn\n\nLitchfield Park: The Evolution of a \"New Town\" (Mary Dickson). Litchfield Park sprang from the desert in 1917 when Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company sought cotton for their tire manufacturing. The small settlement continued to flourish throughout the decades with cotton, cattle, and citrus farms. In the early 1960's, with growth from the metro Phoenix area heading westward, the community embarked on a bold venture – becoming a \"New Town\". Based on an English urban planning model, Litchfield Park took dramatic steps to create an oasis in the west valley. One of only two cities west of the Mississippi, and the only one in Arizona which follows the New Town model, Litchfield Park continues to benefit from this urban design concept. Learn about the history of LItchfield Park and its' attempt at defying urban sprawl. Learn how historic buildings continue to play a vibrant part in the southwest valley and why the dream of a New Town was never fully completed!
