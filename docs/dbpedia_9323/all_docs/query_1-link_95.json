Drug tests (those that analyze samples of hair and urine) attempt to detect usage of illegal drugs over a lengthy time period, generally ranging from a week to several months. However, alcohol tests are aimed at detecting consumption of a legal - though regulated - substance within a much shorter timeframe. Rather than testing for past usage, an alcohol drug test will register only the immediate presence of alcohol in the human body.\n\nBreath Alcohol Drug Test\n\nOtherwise known as a breathalyzer, Breath Alcohol Test (BATs) make frequent appearances in sitcoms and crime shows. That is because they are quite commonly used given that the test is easy to administer and provides nearly instantaneous results. Police officers rely on breathalyzer exams to detect when drivers are on the road and above the legal alcohol limit. Because BATs provide only a current-moment snapshot of the body's blood alcohol content, they should only be administered when someone is required to be sober at the current time. Such cases would include driving a vehicle or operating heavy machinery.\n\nAccredited Drug Testing centers are dedicated to providing accurate results every time. For that reason, our certified staff only administers DOT-approved Evidential Breath Testing devices (EBTs). Procedures are meticulously controlled to ensure that all results are admissible in a court of law.\n\nDOT only permits a breath alcohol test. Urine alcohol tests are not permitted by the Department of Transportation. Therefore, a DOT regulated employee would take a 5 panel DOT urine test but only a breath alcohol test if required.\n\nUrine Alcohol Drug Test Finally, for rare cases an EtG exam will be administered to determine if alcohol has been consumed over a 5 day period. EtGs are typically reserved for individuals undergoing a court-ordered sobriety or alcohol rehabilitation program.\n\nSaliva / Oral Fluid Alcohol Test\n\nAccredited Drug Testing also offers a saliva specimen alcohol test in addition, to breath and urine testing.
