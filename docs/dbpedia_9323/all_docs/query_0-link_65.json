        "text": "Fort Whipple Museum, a key link to Prescott’s past that had been off-limits to the public for four years, is again welcoming visitors. It held its grand opening in May.\n\nThe museum commemorates the founding and ongoing service of the frontier military outpost established in 1864, the same year Prescott was founded. It protected settlers through the end of conflict with local Indian tribes in 1886, then converted into a tuberculosis sanitarium during World War I, the forerunner to today’s Bob Stump Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center.\n\nFort Whipple Museum is operated by Sharlot Hall Museum, which has its large campus downtown on Gurley Street. But due to Fort Whipple’s location on the VA hospital property, on AZ-89 just north of AZ-69, that location was subject to a much longer COVID shut down than most facilities.\n\nJackson Medel, curator of collections and exhibits at the Sharlot Hall Museum, said the VA’s mandatory pandemic-related closure lasted for about two and a half years, adding, “The museum itself is staffed by volunteer docents, like the buildings on our main campus, and during that time some volunteers retired, moved on or shifted their emphasis in volunteering. So, we basically lost volunteer staff during the mandatory closure.”\n\nPaid staff turnover brought additional complications. Once the closure was lifted, Medel said, Sharlot Hall and the VA went to work on a new operating agreement for Fort Whipple.\n\n“We have finally gotten the agreement finalized and volunteer staff in place and are very excited to get it up and running again,” he added.\n\nFort Whipple has been instrumental to Prescott’s development from two angles, he said.\n\n“Fort Whipple was a military base for many years and was a significant part of the development of Prescott itself, bringing people and goods to the area. Once it became a hospital it retained that significance but in a different way.\n\n“It was a site of medical advancements and treatment. It was a major employer that also brought people to the area,” Medel said.\n\nMost of Fort Whipple’s buildings are still in use.\n\nThe one that houses the museum was built around 1905 as lodging for doctors and officers as the hospital expanded. The exhibits inside chart that history of territorial military, hospital history and Whipple’s role in Prescott through those avenues.\n\nVisitors can learn about Col. Amiel Whipple who inspired the fort’s name, the fort’s prominence during Arizona’s territorial days and as the base of Buckey O’Neill and the Rough Riders in the Spanish-American War, and its transformation into a place of healing for military veterans.\n\nIt includes artifacts from Yavapai and Anglo settlers, weapons used in battles and medical supplies, plus displays about New York Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia’s childhood at the fort.\n\nMedel said the Prescott area was deprived of one of its primary links to the past and some of the best presentations of its military history, while those who visit and work at the VA campus may have been most keenly affected.\n\n“It was a resource for staff, patients and visitors to use while working or being at the hospital. I think the value it added to people’s experience there is significant and will hopefully be appreciated now that it is available to those folks again,” he said.\n\nAdmission to Fort Whipple Museum is free, and it is open on Fridays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Medel said the hours will be expanded as enough volunteer docents are trained to cover additional shifts."
