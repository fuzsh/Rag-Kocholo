        "text": "Description\n\nThe Arizona House of Representatives, President of the Council and the Assistant Secretary of the Arizona Territory signed a resolution as a formal expression of regret for the death of President Abraham Lincoln in February 1866. This article is an official recording of the opinion of the people of Arizona almost a year after the event. A copy of the resolution was sent to President Lincoln's family and was published in the Arizona Miner newspaper as well as other journals of the Pacific and Atlantic States. Originally established as a Republican newspaper in 1864 by Territorial Secretary Richard McCormick (nominated by President Lincoln in 1863), the publication grew to become very politically partisan when racist Democrat John H. Marion took over as editor in 1867. Arizona became a state in 1912.\n\nTranscription\n\nRegarding the death of Abraham Lincoln.\n\nWHEREAS, There has been, to this time, no formal expression of regret on the part of the people of Arizona over the untimely and lamentable death of Abraham Lincoln, the sixteenth President of the United States; therefore\n\nResolved, By the House of Representatives, the Council concurring, That we record our abhorrence of the dastardly act which deprived the nation of the valuable life of Abraham Lincoln, when his great statesmanship and noble character had won the confidence and applause of the civilized world, and the wisdom of his administration of public affairs, at the most critical period in the life of the American people, was universally conceded.\n\nResolved, That here where civil law was first established by the generous consideration of his administration, as elsewhere upon the continent, which owes so much to his honest and persistent devotion to liberty to justice and to the government of the people, his name is honored and revered as that of a true patriot, a profound ruler, and a magnanimous and unselfish man, whose highest motive was the public good, and whose consistent career has elevated the dignity, brightened the renown, and enriched the history of the Republic.\n\nResolved, That a copy of these resolutions be forwarded to the family of the illustrious dead, and to the present President of the United States, also that they be published in the ARIZONA MINER, and in the principal journals of the Pacific and Atlantic States.\n\nJAMES S. GILES,\n\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives.\n\nHENRY A. BIGELOW,\n\nPresident of the Council.\n\nA true copy of the original on file in my office.\n\nHENRY W. FLEURY,\n\nAssistant Secretary of the Territory.\n\n[Transcription by: Ricarda H., Dr. Susan Corbeseroâ€™s Class, Ellis School, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]"
