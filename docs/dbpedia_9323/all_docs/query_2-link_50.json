Instructed to follow the 35th Parallel of north latitude, Whipple traveled east to west. In western Arizona, he drifted south of the 35th Parallel because of the scarcity of water between today's Kingman and the Colorado River. He then went upstream to present-day Needles and continued along the 35th Parallel to Cajon Pass and the Los Angeles basin.\n\nLater, during the American Civil War, General Whipple was a division commander at the battles of Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville. He was mortally wounded at Chancellorsville while defending Washington, D.C. He died in 1863.\n\nWhipple Mountains, San Bernardino County, California.
