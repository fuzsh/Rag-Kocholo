The MSCs report to the Assistant Adjutant General for Army (TAAG-Army), who in turn reports to the Adjutant General (TAG). Both officers are appointed by the governor.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe Maryland National Guard traces its roots to 1634, with the landing of two militia captains at St. Mary's City. It has a long and illustrious history.\n\nAmerican Revolutionary War[]\n\nDuring the American Revolution, members of the \"Maryland Line\" repeatedly charged a vastly superior British force at the Battle of Long Island, buying time for the Continental Army to escape. It is from this incident that Maryland draws one of its official nicknames, \"The Old Line State.\" This was the first time the American Army had used the bayonet in combat. Later in the war, the Maryland militia made a number of additional bayonet charges, including at Cowpens, where their charge turned impending defeat into victory, and at Guilford Courthouse, where they forced the elite British Foot Guards to retreat.\n\nWar of 1812[]\n\nMain article: Battle of North Point\n\nDuring the War of 1812, the Maryland militia held the line at the Battle of North Point in 1814, commanded by Brigadier General John Stricker. There, they held up the British attack for two hours, long enough for the defense of Baltimore to be shored up. The British forces, many of whom were veterans of the Napoleonic Wars took around 300 casualties and, though they won the field at North Point, they would eventually turn back rather than attempt an assault on the American defenses at Baltimore.[1] Not all the militia regiments performed with equal distinction. The 51st, and some members of 39th, broke and ran under fire. However, the 5th and 27th held their ground and were able to retreat in good order having inflicted significant casualties on the advancing enemy.[2] The 175th Infantry (ARNG MD), derived from the 5th Regiment, is one of only nineteen Army National Guard units with campaign credit for the War of 1812.\n\nAmerican Civil War[]\n\nFrom 1841 to 1861 the senior militia general was Major General George H. Steuart, commander of the First Light Division.[3] Until the Civil War he would be the senior commander of the Maryland Volunteers.\n\nIn 1833 a number of Baltimore regiments were formed into a brigade, and Steuart was promoted from colonel to brigadier general.[4] From 1841 to 1861 he was Commander of the First Light Division, Maryland Volunteer Militia.[3] Until the Civil War he would be the Commander-in-Chief of the Maryland Volunteers.[5][6] The First Light Division comprised two brigades: the 1st Light Brigade and the 2nd Brigade. The First Brigade consisted of the 1st Cavalry, 1st Artillery, and 5th Infantry regiments. The 2nd Brigade was composed of the 1st Rifle Regiment and the 53rd Infantry Regiment, and the Battalion of Baltimore City Guards.[7]\n\nBy April 1861 it had become clear that war was inevitable. On April 16 Steuart's son, George H. Steuart, then an officer in the United States Army, resigned his captain's commission to join the Confederacy.[8] On April 19 Baltimore was disrupted by riots, during which Southern sympathizers attacked Union troops passing through the city by rail. Steuart's son commanded one of the Baltimore city militias during the disturbances of April 1861, following which Federal troops occupied the city. In a letter to his father, the younger Steuart wrote:\n\n\"I found nothing but disgust in my observations along the route and in the place I came to - a large majority of the population are insane on the one idea of loyalty to the Union and the legislature is so diminished and unreliable that I rejoiced to hear that they intended to adjourn...it seems that we are doomed to be trodden on by these troops who have taken military possession of our State, and seem determined to commit all the outrages of an invading army.\" [9]\n\nSteuart himself was strongly sympathetic to the Confederacy and, perhaps knowing this, Governor Hicks did not call out the militia to suppress the riots.[10] On May 13, 1861 Union troops occupied the state, restoring order and preventing a vote in favour of Southern secession. Steuart moved south for the duration of the American Civil War, and much of the general's property was confiscated by the Federal Government as a consequence. Old Steuart Hall was confiscated by the Union Army and Jarvis Hospital was erected on the estate, to care for Federal wounded.[11] However, many members of the newly formed Maryland Line in the Confederate army would be drawn from the state militia.[12]\n\nMaryland militia units fought on both sides of the Civil War. At the Battle of Front Royal, the Union 1st Maryland was engaged and defeated by the Confederate 1st Maryland. The lineage of the Confderate 1st Maryland is perpetuated by the 175th Infantry Regiment, whose lineage dates back to 1774.\n\nGreat Railroad Strike of 1877[]\n\nDuring the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, on July 20 Governor Carroll called up the 5th and 6th Regiments from Baltimore to stop strikers in Cumberland from disrupting rail service. While marching from their armories to a Baltimore and Ohio Railroad train at Camden Station, an armed mob attacked the troops. The 6th Regiment fired on the mob, killing 10 and wounding 25, and several members of both regiments were injured by stones and bricks.[13] The troops were then besieged by 50,000 rioters inside Camden Yards until the arrival of federal troops in Baltimore. The building, now part of a professional sports arena, still bears bullet holes from rioters firing at troops inside.\n\nMexican Border raids of 1916[]\n\nIn response to Pancho Villa‚Äôs cross-border raids, the Maryland National Guard was called up in 1916 and deployed for seven months to the town of Eagle Pass, Texas, on the Mexican border.[14]\n\nWorld War I[]\n\nDuring the First World War, most Maryland National Guard troops served as part of the 29th Division, and their campaign credits include Meuse-Argonne. In addition, the 1st Separate Company, an all-black unit, served as part of the 372nd Infantry Regiment, although ostensibly assigned to the 93rd Division, actually fought under French control. One of the Maryland National Guard's longest-mobilized units during the war was the 117th Trench Mortar Battery, which served under the 42nd Division from October 1917 until the end of the war. It was the first Maryland unit to see combat, and participated in all of the AEF's major battles during that period.\n\nWorld War II[]\n\nSee also: Omaha Beach\n\nWorld War II also saw the mobilization of the Maryland National Guard. Again, most were assigned to the 29th Infantry Division, where they took part in the D-Day landings and fought their way across France and Germany. In 1945, they missed being the first unit to link up with the Soviet Red Army on the Elbe River by a matter of hours.\n\nKorean War[]\n\nThe Maryland National Guard had very few troops mobilized for the Korean War, but those that were played an important role. The 231st Transportation Truck Battalion was the first National Guard unit to land in Korea, and were immediately put to use keeping supplies flowing within the Pusan Perimeter. Originally a segregated, all-black unit, the 231st was integrated during this service in Korea, only to be again segregated when it returned to state status.\n\nVietnam War[]\n\nAlthough no Maryland Army National Guard units served in Vietnam, the Maryland Army Guard played a significant role during the Cold War. Across the state, Nike missile batteries, armed with nuclear warheads, were manned by Maryland National Guardsmen to defend the National Capital area from Soviet bombers from the mid-1950s until the early 1970s. Maryland National Guard troops were also kept busy with riot-control duty in the 1960s and early 1970s, most notably during the Baltimore Riots of 1968, the Salisbury riots of May, 1968, the University of Maryland student riots of 1970-72, and the Cambridge Riots of 1963 and 1967.[15]\n\nGlobal War on Terrorism[]\n\nSince the September 11 attacks, the Maryland Army National Guard has mobilized a number of units, including the 58th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, for service in Iraq; Afghanistan; Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; and Kosovo. Guardsmen from the 115th Military Police Battalion were among the first and most heavily called upon, having arrived at the Pentagon on Sept. 12 and subsequently served in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Guantanamo Bay. Maryland elements of the Combat Aviation Brigade, 29th Infantry Division served in Iraq, Maryland elements of the Combat Aviation Brigade, 42nd Infantry Division served in Afghanistan, and Maryland National Guard elements were attached to 44th Medical Brigade/XVIII Airborne Corps for service in Iraq. Maryland is also home to several Special Operations units, most notably Company B, 2nd Battalion, 20th Special Forces Group (Airborne) and Special Operations Detachment, Joint Forces. Members of these units have both been mobilized to serve in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Currently, the Special Operations Detachment, Joint Forces was selected and mobilized to create the Special Operations Command for the newly created United States Africa Command.\n\nHistoric units[]\n\n115th Armor Regiment (United States)\n\n158th Cavalry Regiment (United States)\n\n110th Field Artillery Regiment (United States)\n\n224th Field Artillery Regiment (United States)\n\n115th Infantry Regiment (United States)\n\n175th Infantry Regiment (United States)\n\n224th Aviation Regiment (United States)\n\n121st Engineer Battalion (United States)\n\nCurrent Units[]\n\nJoint Forces Headquarters\n\nHeadquarters - Headquarters Company\n\nRecruiting & Retention Battalion\n\nTraining Support Battalion\n\nDet. 13, Operational Support Air Command\n\nMedical Detachment\n\n32nd Civil Support Team (WMD)\n\n1958th Contingency Contracting Team\n\n229th JAG Trial Defense Team\n\n229th Band\n\n58th Troop Command\n\n1297th Support Battalion\n\n175th Infantry Regiment (United States), attached to the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 28th Infantry Division, Pennsylvania Army National Guard\n\nCompany B, 2 Battalion, 20th Special Forces Group (United States)\n\nDet 2, HHD, 2 Battalion 20th Special Forces Group (United States)\n\nSOD - Joint Forces Command\n\n70th Regiment\n\n58th Battlefield Surveillance Brigade (United States)\n\nHeadquarters - Headquarters Company\n\n1st Squadron, 158th Cavalry Regiment\n\nUSAR Intelligence Battalion\n\n729th Support Company\n\n629th Signal Company (Network Support)\n\n29th Infantry Division Combat Aviation Brigade\n\n[16]\n\nNotable members[]\n\nRaymond Berry, professional football Hall of Fame inductee\n\nJohn R.
