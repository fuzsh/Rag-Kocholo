        "text": "ANNAPOLIS, Sept. 8, 1862.\n\nWhereas, it has been represented to me upon authority which seems unquestionable, that a portion of the rebel army of the South, now in arms against the Union, have crossed our border, and is encamped upon our territory, menacing the City of Baltimore and other portions of the State with a hostile attack; and it is expedient besides all the powers with which the Government may be prepared to meet this daring invasion, that our own citizens should without delay, organize throughout the State such a militia force as may effectually assist in defending our homes and fireside against the assault of the invader.\n\nI, therefore, in virtue of authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the State, hereby call upon her citizens to enroll themselves at once in volunteer military organization, that no possible power at command may be overlooked in preparing to meet every emergency. In the City of Baltimore, I would especially call upon our citizens to organize at once and complete the formation of the First Light Division of Maryland Volunteer Militia, in which several companies have been already filled, and their officers commissioned.\n\nAs a mistaken impression seems to exist, to some extent, of a purpose to offer to the government the services of this division, or some portion of it, as United States volunteers for nine months, and this impression may tend to retard the formation of the division, I would take this occasion to reiterate the assurance already given to many who have consulted me on the subject -- that no one by becoming a member of any company in that division places himself hereby in the power of the officers of the organization to transfer his services, without his consent, to the volunteer forces of the United States. Whilst opportunity will be given to any regiment or brigade connected with the division to make such tender of their services to the government, no member of any such regiment can be constrained to such a course by the majority of the command, nor without his individual visual consent.\n\nWith this understanding of the character of this military organization, I hope to see the ranks of the First Light Division immediately filled, prepared, when called into the service of the State or city, to respond effectually in maintaining their peace and ministering to their defence. At the same time, any portion of it disposed to extend the sphere of its usefulness, will have the opportunity, with the consent of the Government, of uniting their exertions with the other volunteers from Maryland in the service of the United States.\n\nTo the citizens of the several counties I would I would appeal, and especially commend to them the formation of volunteer cavalry companies, as better adapted than any other to the present emergency.\n\nI have provided and am ready at once to distribute cavalry arms and accoutrement sufficient for all that will probably be organized; and while every effort will be made to arm and equip also all infantry volunteers that may offer, let our loyal citizens not wait for the [???] of arms, but organize everywhere without delay, and assist in driving from the state the invading host that now occupies its soil, armed with any weapon which opportunity have furnish.\n\nGiven under my hand and the Green Seal of the the State this 8th day of September, 1862.\n\nBy the Governor, A.H. BRADFORD.\n\nWM. B. HILL, Secretary of State."
