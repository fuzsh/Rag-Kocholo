        "text": "For the record, this regiment and the 3rd NC Regiment served together for almost the entire war, assigned to the same brigades and fighting in all the same battles/skirmishes except for Farmville, VA.\n\nThe 1st NC Regiment was organized at the race track near Warrenton in the spring of 1861. Governor John W. Ellis appointed the field officers on May 8, 1861, and company officers were commissioned on May 16th. Over 1,500 enlisted men have been recorded for the ten companies. In July, after the organization was perfected, the regiment was ordered to Richmond, and was assigned to Brigadier General Theophilus H. Holmes' Brigade, at Brooks' Station, near the mouth of Acquia Creek. While here Company B was detached and ordered to the mouth of Acquia Creek to man the heavy guns in the batteries stationed there, and was engaged in several skirmishes with the enemy's gun-boats.\n\nIn the Spring of 1862 a portion of the North Carolina Troops, iucluding the 1st NC Regiment, was ordered to Goldsborough to meet an advance of the enemy from New Bern. At this time, Lt. Colonel Matthew W. Ransom was elected Colonel of the 35th NC Regiment, and accepted; Major John A. McDowell was made Lt. Colonel; Captain Tristrim L Skinner, of Company A, became Major.\n\nThe regiment having been again ordered back to Richmond, arrived on the battlefield of Seven Pines just after the battle had been fought (June 1, 1862). Here it remained for several weeks, chiefly on picket duty, with an occasional skirmish with the enemy, and lost several of its men. While here a new brigade was formed, composed of the 1st and 3rd North Carolina regiments, the 4th and 44th Georgia regiments, and Brigadier General R. S. Ripley (SC) was assigned to its command, with Major General Daniel H. Hill (NC) being in command of the division.\n\nOn the 26th of June, after a circuitous and fatiguing night march, the regiment arrived in the vicinity of Mechanicsville. Here a detail of one company from each regiment was made, and Major William L. DeRosset, of the 3rd NC Regiment, was placed in command. Ripley's Brigade, having been selected as the assaulting column, was ordered across the bridge and to form line of battle. It advanced to the attack in front of the splendid artillery of the enemy strongly posted across the pond at Elyson's Mills near Mechanicsville. The slaughter was terrific, yet the 1st NC Regiment pressed forward in the face of this murderous fire for more than half a mile, advancing steadily to what seemed inevitable destruction, till it reached the pond, when it was ordered by the right flank and took shelter in a skirt of woods below. In this assault Col. Mumford S. Stokes was mortally wounded, Lt. Col. McDowell badly wounded and Major Skinner killed. Capt. James A. Wright, of Company E was killed; Capt. R. W. Rives, of Company H was mortally wounded and soon died; four Lieutenants, and more than half of the men of the regiment were killed and wounded. On the 27th, the enemy having retreated, this regiment, with the army, pursued them in the direction of Cold Harbor by way of Bethsaida Church. There being now no field officers and but few company officers in the regiment. Major William R. Cox, of the 2nd NC Regiment, was ordered to take command in this battle.\n\nThe next day the Chickahominy River was crossed at Grape Vine Bridge and the march continued in the direction of White Oak Swamp via Savage's Station. Here, after a sharp skirmish, the enemy was repulsed at Gaines's Mill. From this point the regiment marched in the direction of Malvern Hill by way of Quaker Road, and turning to the right after passing the church, was soon under fire from the enemy's guns on Malvern Hill. The troops taking shelter under the crest of the hill, formed a line of battle and were ordered by Major General Daniel H. Hill to assault the strong natural position of the enemy on the plateau. Arriving at Poindexter's Farm, at the crest and in full view at close range of the enemy's infantry and artillery, this regiment, together with the 3rd, went by the left flank, in perfect order, and took advantage of a cut in the road. It was here that the gallant soldier, Col. Gaston Meares, of the 3rd NC Regiment, was killed while bravely leading his regiment. Brigadier General Charles Winder (SC), of the Stonewall Brigade, then assumed command of this and the 3rd NC Regiment.\n\nAmong the killed at the battle of Malvern Hill was Capt. John Benbury, of Company A, beloved and mourned by the entire regiment. After this battle Capt. Hamilton A Brown, of Company B, was promoted to Lt. Colonel, and Capt. James S. Hines, of Company C, became the new Major. The regiment remained for several days in this locality, Major General Daniel H. Hill's Division, of which it was a part, having been left to watch Union General George McClellan's movements. While here, Lt. Col. Brown and Maj. Hines were detailed to go to Raleigh to procure the regiment's quota of conscripts. They returned with about five hundred new recruits. After being assigned to their proper companies and sufficiently drilled, the regiment, with the division, was moved by rail to Orange Court House.\n\nAbout the 9th of August the regiment moved in the direction the army had taken, passing the battlefield of Cedar Mountain, and was in reserve at 2nd Manassas and Chantilly, Virginia. Afterwards it crossed the Potomac River at Point of Rocks and camped near Frederick, MD, where it remained for several days, then crossed the South Mountain at Crampton's Gap and remained at Boonsboro, MD, until the 14th, when it participated in the battle of Boonsboro Gap, its position being on the right of the Braddock Road. At one time during this battle six companies were hotly engaged, losing several men.\n\nAfter dark the army withdrew and moved in the direction of Sharpsburg, MD, where it arrived on the morning of the 15th, taking position in a cornfield on the ridge north of the town. Here we fed abundantly on green corn and pumpkins, till the firing of the enemy's artillery in the afternoon admonished us of more important matters. On the following day this regiment, with the brigade, while supporting a battery, was subjected to a heavy fire from the enemy's artillery across Antietam Creek. At daylight on the 17th the firing began at close range. The troops were soon moved by the left flank, at double-quick, and occupied a position at a burning farm building. After a hard battle of an hour, Brigadier General R.S. Ripley (SC) having been wounded in the neck, the advance to the front and left was ordered by Col. George P. Doles, of the 4th Georgia, now in command.\n\nAfter an irresistible effort on our part, the Federals were driven from, and we gained possession of, the celebrated cornfield. On, on, this vast army approached our thin ranks. Word was passed: \"Fix bayonets, boys!\" We nerved ourselves for the attack, which was murderous beyond description, continuing for more than an hour and a half. Ripley's Brigade, after bearing the brunt of the battle, was ordered to retreat, the enemy not pursuing. The manner of this. retreat was slow and in order and under Major General Hill's personal supervision. Observing an abandoned caisson, he, Major General Hill, ordered the soldiers to remove it from the field, remarking: \"We will not leave the enemy so much as a wheel.\" The retreat was continued to the Dunkard Church on the Hagerstown Road, where, after being supplied with ammunition, our lines were reformed, the enemy making no further demonstrations on that day. The following day the troops rested on the field, in plain view of the enemy's lines, and during the night crossed the swollen Potomac River back into Virginia. The loss of the regiment in this battle was more than fifty per cent, of the number engaged, including some of its best officers and men, among the number Capt. Thomas S. Bonchelle, of Company B.\n\nAfter resting for several weeks in the lower valley, the army moved by way of New Market Gap, passing Orange Court House in the direction of Fredericksburg, Virginia. The regiment and brigade continued its march to Port Royal on the Rappahannock River, where it remained for several days. On the morning of the 12th of December the troops moved back in the direction of Fredericksburg, marching the greater part of the night and reaching Hamilton's Crossing on the morning of the 13th. In this battle this regiment was in the second line until the evening of the first day, when it took position in the first line. The enemy being driven back, the Confederates lay on the field, anticipating another furious battle, and \"bitterly thought of the morrow.\" Before dawn the line was advanced to the railroad, within three hundred yards of the enemy, but no blood was shed this day, and but one shot was fired.\n\nThe enemy sent a flag of truce on the 14th, asking permission of Lt. General \"Stonewall\" Jackson to remove their dead and wounded, who were lying in heaps on that portion of the railroad occupied by this regiment. The permission was promptly granted by the General. The troops were employed during the dark and rainy night following in tearing up the nearby railroadan extremely difficult taskas orders were given to accomplish this work in silence, as well as in the dark, \"without lights and without noise.\" The enemy retreated, and thus ended the first battle of Fredericksburg.\n\nAfter this the regiment built and occupied winter quarters on the Rappahannock River, near Skinker's Neck. There the winter of 1862-'63 was spent on picket duty along the river. While stationed at this point the regiment, which had been in Major General Daniel H. Hill's Division, was now changed to Jackson's old division, commanded by Major General Isaac R. Trimble (VA), and our gallant Georgia comrades, the 4th and 44th Regiments, were exchanged for the 10th, 23rd, and 37th Virginia Regiments. These regiments, with the 1st and 3rd NC Regiments, formed a new brigade, and Brigadier General Raleigh E. Colston (VA) was assigned to command it.\n\nOn the 29th of April this regiment left its camp at Skinker's Neck and marched to Hamilton's Crossing, thence in the direction of Chancellorsville, VA. On the 2nd of May, a Saturday morning, while waiting in the road on the east of Chancellorsville, the members of this regiment witnessed an interview between General Robert E. Lee and Lt. General Stonewall Jackson. These generals went apart from their staff officers and sat down upon the leaves. General Lee unfolding a map that he had taken from his pocket, and pointing out to General Jackson with a pencil on the map, who nodded assent. In a short while General Jackson arose and called Major Alexander Pendleton, his chief of staff, and through him ordered the troops to move by the left flank. Then commenced that grand strategic movement that has since been the wonder and admiration of the world. Rapidly marching around the enemy's lines to his right and rear, crossing the plank road and arriving on the old turnpike road about 4 p.m., two and a half miles west of Chancellorsville, having marched in all more than fifteen miles in a few hours, and about five miles in a direct line from the starting point in the morning, Jackson's Corps had been detached from the main body of the army to make this attack.\n\nOn this march regimental commanders were ordered to march in rear of their regiments with a guard of strong men with fixed bayonets, to prevent straggling. Immediately on arrival at the stone road the troops were formed in three lines of battle, Colston's Brigade being in the second line. The order to advance was obeyed with promptness. Rushing on towards the enemy's camp, the first scene that can be recalled was the abundant supply of slaughtered beef and rations cooking. We ontinued the pursuit until night, when the enemy made a stand within a mile of the Chancellor House. Here great confusion ensued. The two front lines having become mingled, were halted and reformed. This regiment, being in better alignment than most of the others. Lt. General Jackson in person ordered it to advance as skirmishers in front of the line. Shortly after being thus deployed it was charged by a company of Federal cavalry, which proved to be a part of the 8th Pennsylvania. The greater portion of them were unhorsed and captured. This was a critical period in the battle, and Lt. General Jackson seemed unusually anxious. He gave instructions to the Colonel of this regiment to fire upon everything coming from the direction of the enemy.\n\nOn Sunday, the 3rd of May, the 1st NC Regiment was formed on the right of the road, and, advancing, captured the first line of the enemy's worksa barricade of huge logs with abatis in front. The portion of these works that crossed a ravine and swamp, and which was favorable to the occupancy of the enemy, was assaulted three times by the Confederates before it was finally held. This regiment, with the major part of the brigade, participated in the last two of these charges. It was then that Major General J. E. B. Stuart, who was in command (Generals Jackson and Hill having both been wounded on the evening before) ordered the whole line forward. The enemy's earthworks in front were carried by storm and many pieces of artillery which occupied them were captured. We were now in full view of the Chancellor House, and the captured guns were turned on the fleeing enemy. Soon the Chancellor House was in flames, and a glorious victory perched upon our banners.\n\nThe Confederate line was again moved forward and executed a wheel to the left, bringing this regiment and brigade immediately to the Chancellor House, hence this brigade, which had been commanded since early in the day by Lt. Colonel Hamilton A. Brown (Capt. Louis C. Latham being in command of the regiment, Col. John A. McDowell and Maj. Jarrett N. Harrell having been wounded), was the first of the Confederate troops to reach the Chancellor House, Lt. Colonel Brown being the fifth brigade commander that day, as per his report in \"War Records.\" During one of these assaults alluded to above this brigade became detached from the division, and when it arrived at the Chancellor House was between two of Major General Robert E. Rodes' Virginia brigades. On the 6th of May, the brigade marched to U. S. Ford on the Rappahannock River. While here the enemy was permitted by General Lee to lay a pontoon-bridge and send over several hundred ambulances to the battlefield of Chancellorsville for their wounded. A whole week was consumed in effecting this object, after which the brigade was removed and operations resumed. The troops now returned to the vicinity of Fredericksburg.\n\nEarly in June, soon after the Chancellorsville battle, Major General Edward Johnson (VA) was assigned to command the Stonewall Division, and Brigadier General George H. Steuart to command Colston's Brigade. The division was now composed of Paxton's, or the First Brigade, known as the Stonewall Brigade, Jones', or the Second Brigade, and George H. Steuart's, the Third Brigade.\n\nFrom its bivouac near Fredericksburg our army now marched in the direction of Winchester, the Second Corps crossing the Blue Ridge at Chester Gap. Arriving at Winchester, we participated in the battle of the 13th and 14th of June, which was very disastrous to the Federal. After the battle on the evening of the 14th, Johnson's Division was ordered to intercept and capture the routed enemy, and for this purpose the division marched all night, and by a circuitous route by way of Jordan's Springs, arrived at daybreak near Stephenson's Depot, on the Valley Pike. During a sharp battle at this place, in which the regiment was sorely pressed. Lt. John A. Morgan, with a squad of men, saved the day by taking command of and operating a Confederate battery which this regiment was supporting, after nearly all the regular artillerymen had been killed or wounded.\n\nSeveral hundred of the enemy threw down their guns and surrendered. Portions of four regiments, with their colors, surrendered to this regiment. At this stage of the battle the regiment volunteered to reconnoiter the field to the Carter house, a mile distant, and succeeded in capturing two hundred horses. In this last battle the 1st NC Regiment lost the gallant Capt. John S. R. Miller, of Company H, formerly Adjutant of the regiment. On the 18th of June, the regiment crossed the Potomac River at Shepherdstown and encamped near the Dunkard Church, on the previous battlefield of Sharpsburg. While here the Rev. George Patterson, the Chaplain of the 3rd NC Regiment, having been solicited, read the burial service over the noble heroes of the 1st and 3rd Regiments who had fallen on this battlefield in 1862 and were buried near this church.\n\nFrom this camp the regiment, with the brigade, marched via Hagerstown to Chambersburg, Greencastle and McConnellsburg to the vicinity of Carlisle and on to Gettysburg, having marched twenty-five miles the last day, but arrived too late to participate in the engagement of the first day. The position of the regiment the next day was about two miles east of the town, the regiment being the left of the brigade and extreme left of the army. In the charge that took place at 4 p.m. this regiment, after crossing Rock Creek, assembled on the right, and with the brigade assaulted and captured the enemy's works at the southeast base of Culp's Hill. Lt. Green Martin, of Company B, was the first to enter the works, where he received a mortal wound. At this juncture the officer in command of this regiment sent a message to Major General Johnson to the effect that with re-inforcements he could cut the Baltimore Pike.\n\nOn the morning of July 3rd the second line of the enemy's works, strongly posted on Culp's Hill, was assaulted. The fighting here was desperate, the enemy using his artillery at close range and with great effect. The attack failed and we fell back to the works that we had first captured and at night retreated to the position occupied on the first day, west of the town, leaving most of our dead, thirty-eight in number, on the field. Next day we turned our faces toward Virginia, and after several skirmishes and hard marches, arrived at Williamsport, MD, and forded the swollen Potomac River on the 15th, the men having to put their cartridge boxes on their bayonets to keep them above the water. After various marches via Front Royal and Page Valley, and with some skirmishing, we reached Orange Gourt House early in August, participated in the Bristoe Campaign in October, by having an occasional skirmish with the enemy.\n\nOn the 27th of November this regiment was engaged in a short, sharp fight at Payne's Farm, where the commanding officer of the regiment, Lt. Colonel Hamilton A. Brown, was shot through the hand, when lock-jaw threatened, and the command was turned over to Capt. Louis C. Latham. In this battle the enemy was driven from the field after a loss of several of the regiment's best men. At Mine Run the regiment was engaged in several skirmishes, but in no general battle. Thus ended the campaign of 1863, and the regiment built winter quarters near the Rapidan River, and did picket duty along the river at Mitchell's Ford during the winter of 1863-64. Colonel John A. McDowell having now resigned, Lt. Colonel Hamilton A. Brown was promoted to Colonel, Major Jarrette N. Harrell to Lt. Colonel and Capt. Louis C. Latham to Major. The regiment was now thoroughly reorganized and the vacancies filled with competent company officers, carefully selected, all of them an honor to their State.\n\nOn the 4th of May camp was broken and the regiment, with the brigade and division, marched in the direction of Locust Grove and met the enemy on the evening of the 15th in the first day's battle of the Wilderness, where, after a hard fight, a portion of the regiment captured two pieces of artillery and more than one hundred prisoners in an opening on the old stone road. A portion of the 1st NC Regiment, Lt.Obadiah R. Scott being one of the leading spirits, suddenly emerged from a thicket of pines and attacked a Federal artillery battery on its flank. Here the fighting was desperate, clubbed-guns and bayonets being used. \"Twas claw for claw, and the devil for us all.\" This portion of our regiment, having crossed the road and obliqued too far to the right, was now in rear of the enemy's lines opposed by Major General Robert Rodes (VA) on the right of the road. At length General Rodes succeeded in routing this portion of the enemy's line and a perfect stampede ensued. We could only avail ourselves of the above-named gully, from which we had just captured so many of the enemy, while this vast herd of fleeing Federals came rushing through and over us without firing a gun or speaking a word. While we were yet in this temporary concealment, Colonel James N. Lightfoot, of the 6th Alabama, in pursuit of the routed foe, dashed up to this battery, mounted the guns and, with flag in hand, claimed the capture. We in turn rose up from this now famous gully and, to his astonishment and disappointment, proved to him that the prize and the honor were ours. The remaining portion of the regiment, with the brigade, arrived in time to assist in reclaiming the battery from Colonel Lightfoot and the 6th Alabama. The enemy being reinforced, made another advance, and we were in turn driven back to our first position, leaving the guns between the lines. We, however, removed them from the field on the night of the 6th, after the firing had ceased.\n\nOn the night of May 7th the movement was commenced by the right flank and the march was continued throughout the next day, the 8th, through the dust, heat and smoke (the woods being on fire), the regiment arriving in the evening near Spotsylvania Court House. The enemy was marching on a road nearly parallel with ours, and where the roads came together, at sundown, a brisk engagement took place. While going into this action, on the right by file into line, colorbearer W. H. Lee was decapitated by a shell. Capt. William H. Thompson picked up the colors, and bore them until the regiment had finished the movement and taken its place in line.\n\nThe night of May 8th and the day of May 9th were spent in building works. On the 10th, Brigadier General George P. Doles' (GA) works having been captured immediately on the left, this regiment and brigade were sent to his assistance. After a most sanguinary battle of two hours, in which we lost some of our bravest and best men. Lt. Larkin Curtis among the number, the works were recaptured and we returned to our position in line. The regiment rested on the 11th. On the morning of the 12th, dark and rainy, a fitting prelude to a day that was dark in the fullest sense of the term, the enemy made a desperate assault on the salient angle occupied by Jones' Brigade, this regiment being immediately on the right of it. For a short time the fighting was desperate. The terrific onslaught of this vast multitude was irresistible, there being a rectangular mass of twenty thousand Federal troops, not in line of battle, but in column of regiments doubled on the centre, supported by a division on each flank, in all more than thirty thousand troops concentrated against this one point. The portion of the works assaulted by this formidable column was little more than four hundred yards wide.\n\nAll but about thirty of the whole 1st NC Regiment were captured, the Colonel wounded and captured and recaptured three times; the last time from the enemy's ambulance corps, who, in turn, were made prisoners, and bore him to the Confederate rear instead of the Yankee rear, as was their intention. A hickory tree, said to be sixteen inches in diameter, was cut down by minnie balls alone and fell near our works. From this time until the close of the war the regiment was a mere company, but preserved its organization, and was, with the 3rd NC Regiment, transferred to Cox's Brigade and participated in all the battles in which that brigade was engaged between Spottsylvania and Richmond.\n\nAbout this time Lt. General Jubal Early (VA) was assigned to command the Second Corps, and was ordered to Lynchburg to meet Hunter's Raid, at which point the corps arrived on the 18th, and after some skirmishing the enemy withdrew during the night and was driven from this portion of Virginia, leaving his artillery and a portion of his train. General Early then marched in the direction of Staunton, passing Lexington. From this point, the army marched in the direction of Washington City by way of the Valley and Monocacy Junction, near Frederick, where a battle took place, the enemy being greatly damaged. Next day, after a long march through the dust and heat, the regiment and the army reached Silver Spring, in view of the dome of the Capitol, where, after some further skirmishing. General Early finding himself confronted by an overwhelming force and his flank threatened, withdrew to the Valley by way of Leesburg and Snicker's Gap. General Early now organized a corps of sharpshooters from the different regiments in the Second Corps, this regiment furnishing its quota, and its Colonel was appointed to command the corps of sharpshooters thus formed.\n\nAfter this the sharpshooters were engaged in almost daily skirmishes with the enemy, and took part in the battles of Winchester, August 17th; Charlestown, August 21st; Smithfield, August 29th; Bunker's Hill, September 3rd, and in the bloody and disastrous battle of 3rd Winchester, September 19th, in which the veteran Major General Robert Rodes (VA), who had ever been equal to occasion, was killed, and also some of our bravest and best officers and men, the true and genial Capt. Thomas D. Boone, of Company F, being among the wounded in this unfortunate battle. In this engagement the Confederates, ten thousand in number, met thirty thousand of the enemy.\n\nGeneral Early retreated and took position at Fisher's Hill, where he was again overpowered, and retreated up the Valley to Waynesboro. The Confederates being reinforced, returned down the Valley, and marched, on the night of the 18th of October, around the end of the Mansanutton Mountain, crossed the Shenandoah River at Bowman's Ford, and attacked the enemy at daylight in his rear at Belle Grove, the sharpshooters capturing twelve pieces of artillery before the main body arrived. This strategy on the part of General Early was pronounced by military critics to be equal, or even superior, to that of General Robert E. Lee at Chancellorsville. Oa account of overwhelming odds, the Confederates were prevented from following up their advantages, and our decided victory of the morning was turned into a signal defeat before the day was over. A portion of this regiment and the sharpshooters were now under the immediate command of Major General Stephen D. Ramseur (NC), who, collecting his veterans behind a stone fence, and fighting like a lion, in this his last battle, was mortally wounded. Although this regiment had never been in his command, it had, as if by accident, been thrown with him in many bloody battles, and his undaunted courage and heroic conduct inspired many a faltering spirit to revive and \"rush on to victory or to death.\" A patriot, a hero, a martyr!\n\nThe army again retreated up the Valley, and after the defeat of Sheridan's Cavalry at Rudes Hill, near Mt. Jackson, the Valley Campaign of 1864 ended. After this the Second Corps of the Army of Northern Virginia returned to Petersburg and took up winter quarters within a few miles of the city.\n\nAbout the middle of February, 1865, the 1st NC Regiment, with the other troops of the corps, moved south of Petersburg, to near Sutherland's Depot. Here the regiment remained until about the middle of March, when the troops were ordered into the trenches in front of Petersburg, and there it remained until the night of the 24th of March, when that portion of the regiment, with the sharpshooters which had been engaged in the assault and capture of Fort Stedman (Hare's Hill) before daylight, as a portion of the assaulting column, including its commander, Col. Hamilton A. Brown, was captured by the enemy, under the command of Brigadier General Napoleon B. McLaughlen, but was shortly afterwards recaptured, and in turn captured General McLaughlen and his command. General McLaughlen asked permission to surrender his sword to Major General John B. Gordon (GA). Permission was granted, for the reason that it was not certain that he was a prisoner, or would be long, as captures and recaptures were so frequent. Upon his surrendering his sword to General Gordon, he was moved back to the Confederate rear and was safe, a prisoner. After this the fort was stubbornly held by the Confederates against great odds for more than four hours, when, by a sudden rush on the part of the enemy on the right, the lines were closed and the greater part of the sharpshooters, together with Col. Hamilton A. Brown, their commander, were cut off and forced to surrender again.\n\nThe march from Petersburg to Appomattox was but a series of engagements until the memorable day of the 9th of April in 1865. This brigade was now commanded by that veteran soldier. Brigadier General William R. Cox (NC), who, as his men were retiring, ordered a halt, and the command was given: \"Right about, face!\" It was promptly obeyed, and once more, and for the last time, these few ragged, foot-sore and half-starved North Carolinians stood in the strength of their invincible manhood, opposed to the men they had met and had driven back on many a bloody field. Once more the command rang out in the clear, firm voice of the intrepid General Cox: \"Ready, Aim, Fire!\" And the last volley fired by the Army of Northern Virginia was by North Carolina troops, this regiment among the number. \"Defeated, but not dishonored.\"\n\n* The above was written by former Colonel Hamilton A. Brown on April 9, 1900, and provided as Pages 136-156, in the compilation known as \"Histories of the Several Regiments and Battalions from North Carolina in the Great War 1861-'65 - Volume I,\" edited by Walter Clark, and published by E.
