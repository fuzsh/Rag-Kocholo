        "text": "Raising and lowering the flag outside the firehouse\n\nDiscussions of safety drills and creating safety messages to share with personnel\n\nCleaning the dorms\n\nSweeping and mopping the floors\n\nCooking the meals\n\nParticipate in mandatory fitness and conditioning program\n\nDaily training drills\n\nAttend workshops or classes designed to inform firefighters on the latest advancements in medical technology, fire science, emergency treatment and prevention\n\nMaintenance of all apparatus (checking fuel levels, examining for damage or wear, etc)\n\nMaintenance of all equipment (uniforms, tanks, etc.)\n\nInventory of supplies\n\nDiscussion of recent or past firefighting, emergency medical responses and working out strategies to cope with unexpected occurrences during emergencies\n\nEvery activity is important and given attention. A fire truck cannot respond to an emergency if it is low on fuel. A facemask can cause a fatality if it has a crack in it. A firefighter’s entire day is spent, in one way or another, preparing for emergencies. In our department SAFETY is the top priority!\n\nTeamwork is another key component of HCDFRS. Modern fire stations have separate sleeping and bathroom/shower facilities for men and women. Older stations have been retrofitted with separate bathroom/shower facilities, but common sleeping areas remain. The Department makes every effort to provide the best available solution to privacy issues at each station. And by the way, everyone takes turns cooking, so you might want to start thinking about some of your favorite family recipes.\n\nLike members of the armed services, firefighters and EMTs follow a command structure based on rank, with firefighters and EMTs at the lower end of the scale. A paramilitary structure requires you to take orders from those of higher rank. When on duty, firefighters cannot leave the station to take care of personal business nor can they make or receive cell phone calls while en route to or working on an incident. Firefighters are expected to come work on time every day they are scheduled to work including during snowstorms, hurricanes or other severe weather. Lateness is not tolerated. You are held accountable for your behavior – off and on the job, inside and outside Howard County."
