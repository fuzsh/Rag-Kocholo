        "text": "427 Commercial St.\n\nBoston, MA 02109\n\nPrimary: 617-223-3123\n\nEmergency: 833-449-0539\n\nMission\n\nSector Boston, \"The Birthplace of the Coast Guard,\" is a regional operational command responsible for coastal safety, security, and environmental protection from the New Hampshire-Massachusetts border southward to Plymouth, Massachusetts out to 200nm offshore. Sector Boston directs over 1,500 Active Duty, Reserve, and Auxiliary members, four multi-mission response boat stations, 3 multi-mission cutters, and an Aids to Navigation Team to protect and secure vital infrastructure, rescue mariners in peril at sea, enforce federal law, maintain our navigable waterways, and respond to all hazards impacting the maritime transportation system and coastal region.\n\nThe institutions that form the modern day Coast Guard were born here. The first commissioned cutter in the Revenue Cutter Service, the MASSACHUSETTS, was built in Newburyport in 1789, homeported in Boston, and commanded by Boston-born John Foster Williams; his final resting place is in the North End within sight of the Sector. Fabled lifesaver, Joshua James, served in the surfboat services from 1841 starting at age 15 until his death in 1902 at the age of 75; he was personally credited with over 200 lives saved. He received command of the Point Allerton Lifesaving Station in Hull, Massachusetts in 1889 at age 62 and died on the beach after drilling with his hand-rowed surf boat crew. During his 13-year command, his station was credited with 540 lives saved. The Coast Guard operates a station at Point Allerton to this day. Boston Light celebrated its 300th anniversary in September 2016 and was the first light house constructed in what is now the United States. Built in 1716 on Little Brewster Island in Boston Harbor, it was destroyed by withdrawing British forces in 1776 during the Revolutionary War, and later reconstructed to the same exact dimensions in 1783 by the Massachusetts government. The Light was ceded to the United States government in 1790 and was administered under several Lighthouse bureaus before being made part of the U.S. Coast Guard in 1942. It is the only remaining permanently manned light house in federal service.\n\nThe men and women of Sector Boston maintain the same traditions as those who founded our nation and our service and serve the nation and coastal Massachusetts with the same dedication. We take inspiration from those that heroically laid our foundation and are devoted to remaining \"Semper Paratus\", Always Ready, just as they did.\n\nCommand\n\nSector Commander: CAPT Kailie J. Benson\n\nDeputy Sector Commander: CDR Joel B. Carse"
