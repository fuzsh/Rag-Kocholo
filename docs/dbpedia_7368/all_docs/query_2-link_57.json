The bulk of Company C, under original enlistments, had been among the earliest volunteers and captured at the battle of Hatters Inlet Batteries on August 29, 1861; Capt. Alexander P. White being then 1st Lieutenant in the Independent Grays [Company A of the 7th NC Volunteers], commanded by Capt. William F. Martin.\n\nCompany DOrange CountyThis company was brought in by John W. Graham, who had entered the service as 2nd Lieutenant on April 20, 1861, in the Orange Guards [Company G of the 27th NC Regiment], which with the Guilford Grays, (both of them ante-bellum volunteer companies,) had been ordered to coast defense duty at Fort Macon. On June 21, 1861, he was appointed Aide-de-Camp to Brig. Gen. Richard C.

Thomas, 2nd Lieutenant, November 1, 1864.\n\nCompany FCleveland County, mainlyHenry F. Schenk, Captain, April 1, 1862, Major July 31, 1862, resignation accepted on August 15, 1863; Benjamin F. Grigg, Captain, August 5, 1862 (Lincoln County), from 1st Sergeant May 10, 1862, (earlier in the Bethel Regiment); Valentine J.

Graves, Captain, August 1, 1862, from 1st Lieutenant July 5, 1862, (earlier in the 13th NC Regiment); James D. Patterson, 2nd Lieutenant, July 5, 1862, resignation accepted on February 13, 1863; Samuel R. Holton, 1st Lieutenant, February 13, 1863, from 3rd Lieutenant July 28, 1862, (often detailed on brigade staff), from 1st Sergeant; Robert T. Faucette, 2nd Lieutenant, March 1, 1863, from 1st Sergeant and transferred with fifteen (15) men from Company D, promoted to 1st Lieutenant and transferred back to Company D on September 18, 1864; Robert W. Belo, 2nd Lieutenant, September 18, 1864, from 3rd Lieutenant March 1, 1863, from 1st Sergeant (captured and lost his right foot at the battle of Ware Bottom Church on May 13, 1864); Solon E. Burkhead, 3rd Lieutenant, September 18, 1864, from 1st Sergeant in Company D, enlisted from Randolph County.\n\nCompany IRutherford CountyThis company was composed of recruits mainly from Rutherford County and enlisted in February of 1862, by 1st Lieutenant James W. Kilpatrick and Private Lawson Harrill, both then of Company D, 6th NC Volunteers, sent home for recruits. They secured 76 men and organized as Company N on April 7, 1862, at Fredericksburg, VA, by electing James W. Kilpatrick Captain, Lawson Harrill 1st Lieutenant, James H. Sweezy 2nd Lieutenant, and Henry A. L. Sweezy 3rd Lieutenant. Later the following officers were elected to fill vacancies and promoted as follows: At the battle of Seven Pines Capt. James W. Kilpatrick was killed on May 31, 1862 and Lawson Harrill promoted to Captain on June 1, 1862, James H. Sweezy to 1st Lieutenant, Henry A. L. Sweezy to 2nd Lieutenant, and Joseph M. Walker elected 3rd Lieutenant. All of Company N was transferred to the 56th NC Regiment on June 19, 1862 and was then designated as Company I, known as the Rutherford Rifles. On August 28, 1862 James H. Sweezy's, 1st Lieutenant, resignation was accepted, on account of ill health and soon afterwards he died. This caused the following promotions: Henry A. L. Sweezy to 1st Lieutenant on August 28 1862; Joseph M. Walker to 2nd Lieutenant, and Philip H. Gross was elected 3rd Lieutenant (September 22, 1862) from the ranks. At the battle at the Davis House, known as the battle of 2nd Weldon Railroad, on August 21, 1864, 1st Lieutenant Henry A. L. Sweezy was killed, and the following promotions followed: Joseph M. Walker to 1st Lieutenant, Philip H. Gross to 2nd Lieutenant, and Orderly Sergeant Lewis M. Lynch to 3rd Lieutenant. During the month of February, 1865, in latter part of the Siege of Petersburg, 3rd Lieutenant Lewis M. Lynch was killed by a sharpshooter, and Sgt. Columbus P. Tanner was elected 3rd Lieutenant, but was never granted a commission. This company was first attached to the 16th NC Regiment (State Troops) and made the thirteenth company [Company N] in that Regiment. On April 8th, this Company commenced the long march to Yorktown, a distance of 130 miles, and arrived on April 19th. On May 2nd, 1862, Yorktown was evacuated, and at Williamsburg the 16th NC Regiment was held as a reserve to support the line of battle. This was on the famous retreat of General Joseph E. Johnston during the Peninsula Campaign between the James and York rivers. At Seven Pines on May 31, 1862, this attached company, only in service about two (2) months, went into that fearful battle and fought like veterans. Capt. James W. Kilpatrick, Drummer J. G. Price, W. M. Brooks, A. K. Lynch, and H. R. Sorrels were killed, and seven (7) wounded. Soon after this battle the company was ordered to Camp Mangum, near Raleigh, NC, and was designated as Company I of the 56th NC Regiment on June 19, 1862.\n\nTotal commissioned and non-commissioned officers and men of Company I were (first and last), 146; killed in battle and died from wounds, 23; wounded and sent to hospital, 24; died from diseases, 29; discharged for disability, 5; besides a large number of slight wounds not reported.\n\nCompany KMecklenburg and Iredell countiesFrancis R. Alexander, Captain, July 26, 1862, mortally wounded in a night charge on June 17, 1864, at the beginning of the Siege of Petersburg, and died on June 19, 1864 (Mecklenburg); John F. McNeely, Captain, June 20, 1864, from 1st Lieutenant December 11, 1862, and 2nd Lieutenant July 2, 1862 (Iredell); James A. Wilson, 1st Lieutenant, July 2, 1862, resignation accepted on December 11, 1862 (Mecklenburg); James W. Shepherd, 1st Lieutenant, June 20, 1864, from 2nd Lieutenant December 11, 1862, from 3rd Lieutenant July 2, 1862 (Iredell), captured on March 25, 1865 at Hare's Hill (aka Fort Stedman); Charles M. Payne, 2nd Lieutenant, June 19, 1864, from 3rd Lieutenant December 20, 1862, from Sergeant (Davidson County), often detailed on Regimental Staff as Acting Adjutant, captured on April 1, 1865 at the battle of Five Forks; John A. Lowrance, 3rd Lieutenant, July 1, 1864, from Sergeant from Corporal (Mecklenburg), captured on April 1, 1865 at the battle of Five Forks.\n\nMay 21, 1862, Col. H. B. Watson assumed command of the Camp of Instruction, with Capt. Alfred H. Belo as Adjutant of the Post and Battalion Drillmaster. The letter designation above given for each company showed the relative rank of its Captain; but the dates of their commissions as they now appear in Moore's Roster, are not thus accurately corroborated.\n\nJuly 31, 1862Organized today by the election of Field Officers. The following shows the result, with Staff and succession as far as preserved:\n\nPaul Fletcher Faison, Colonel. Had been Major 4th NC Volunteers. (Northampton) Class of 1861 at West Point.\n\nGranville Gratiot Luke, Lieutenant Colonel, from Captain of Company A. (Camden)\n\nHenry Franklin Schenk, Major, from Captain Company F, Resignation accepted on August 15, 1863. (Cleveland)\n\nJohn Washington Graham, Major, September 1, 1863, from Captain Company D. (Orange)\n\nEdward Joseph Hale, Jr., Adjutant, August 1, 1862; promoted to Assistant Adjutant General (A.A.G.) of Brig. Gen. James H. Lane's (NC) Brigadeon October 24, 1863. (Cumberland)\n\nJohn W. Faison, Adjutant, December 1, 1863. (Northampton) Captured on April 1, 1865 at the battle of Dinwiddie Court House.\n\nGeorge B. Barnes, Assistant Quartermaster (AQM), August 1, 1862, from 2nd Lieutenant Company E. (Northampton)\n\nThomas C. Halyburton, Assistant Commissary of Subsistence (ACS), August 1, 1862, from Captain Company H. (Iredell)\n\nJames Mason Clark, Color Sergeant August 1, 1862, and Ensign September 24, 1864, from Sergeant Company D. (Orange)\n\nColumbus Alexander Thomas, Surgeon. (Warrenton)\n\nCharles H. Ladd, Surgeon. (South Carolina)\n\nMoses John DeRosset, Surgeon. (Wilmington)\n\nCader Gregory Cox, Assistant Surgeon. (Onslow) William T. Taylor, Sergeant Major, from Private Company B, promoted to Captain Company B, February 22, 1865. (Cumberland)\n\nJoel Mable, Sergeant Major, August 8, 1862, from Private Company K. (Mecklenburg)\n\nWilliam W. Graves, Quartermaster Sergeant, from Private in Company C. (Pasquotank)\n\nStephen O. Mullen, Commissary Sergeant, from Corporal in Company C. (Onslow)\n\nJohn Irvin Elms, Ordnance Sergeant, from Private in Company K (Onslow)\n\nBailey Buie, Hospital Steward, from Private in Company E. (Moore)\n\nWilliam Fenoni, Drum Major, August 1, 1862. (Italy)\n\nWilliam W. Wallace, Drum Major, from Private in Company A. (Northampton)\n\nOn August 1, 1862, Col. Paul F. Faison assumed command, and on August 8th the regiment moved to Goldsborough.\n\nFor the next three (3) months we were frequently on the march and counter-march in reconnoissances between Goldsborough, Warsaw, Magnolia, Beaver Dam Church, Wilmington, the seacoast, and Tarborough. Off the coast we saw the Federal blockading squadrons, which our Advance and other vessels eluded on frequent trips.\n\nOn November 3rd, we marched through Tarborough to meet our forces retreating from Williamston, and all went into camp near Cross Roads Church. The 26th NC Regiment was sent out on reconnoissance.\n\nOn November 4th, Governor Zebulon B. Vance, who had been elected Governor from the position of Colonel of the 26th NC Regiment, arrived with Brig. Gen. James G. Martin, Adjutant General of North Carolina. Gov. Vance's reception by his old command was something unique. As the enemy were not in speaking distance, so fine a disciplinarian as their model commander, Col. Henry K. Burgwyn, had to waive ceremony for the time being. The sincerity of their congratulations was attested by utterly ignoring the dignity hedging about his new position, and recalling the camp-fire scenes where the jovial spirit by his wit and humor had always found a silver lining to the darkest cloud, and led them to look upon any sacrifice that might be offered in the name of \"the good Old North State,\" as a privilege.\n\nCHECKING FOSTER'S RAID.\n\nOn November 5th, Brig. Gen. James G. Martin's (NC) command, consisting of the 17th, 26th, 42nd, 56th, and 61st NC Regiments, Walker's squadron of cavalry and two or three (2-3) batteries of artillery, set out for Hamilton [Martin County]. Within six (6) miles of that place the enemy was reported between us and Tarborough. Counter-marched to within three (3) miles of Cross Roads Church. Just at nightfall, Capt. William H. Crawford's company [2nd Company B] of the 42nd NC Regiment encountered the enemy's cavalry, losing none, and the enemy, according to prisoners captured on November 6th, suffering a loss of sixteen (16) killed and wounded. Six (6) of their dead were left on the field. Slept in line of battle expecting a general attack at daybreak.\n\nOn November 6th, the enemy retreated, and we pursued through a drenching rain; bivouacked in six (6) miles of the terminus of the Wilmington & Weldon Railroad from Tarborough.\n\nOn November 7th, it snowed through the day and into the night; marched to the railroad terminus. At this point Brig. Gen. Martin organized three (3) brigades of the six (6) regiments, the 44th NC Regiment having joined us on November 5th; our Col. Paul F. Faison commanding a brigade composed of the 17th NC Regiment, under Lt. Col. John C. Lamb, and the 56th NC Regiment under Lt. Col. Granville G. Luke. The 47th NC Regiment, Col. Sion H. Rogers, came in on November 9th.\n\nOn November 11th, Col. Faison's Brigade reached Hamilton. It is evident now that the campaign is ended, and the enemy frightened from his attempt on Tarborough, has returned to Washington, NC. Their raid was under command of Maj. Gen. John G. Foster, late a superintendent of the United States Military Academy at West Point while Col. Faison was a cadet there. The utterly wanton destruction of household and other private property left in their trail has not inspired their pursuers with any respect for their soldierly qualities. It is estimated that they have carried off 3,000 laborers (slaves) from Martin and adjoining countiesa more legitimate prize, as without such wasting of the sinews of war, the struggle may be prolonged indefinitely.\n\nSERVICE ON THE BLACKWATER.\n\nOn November 15th, the 56th NC Regiment takes up line of march for Franklin, VA, and crosses the Roanoke River at Hill's Ferry, a mile from Palmyra [Halifax County]. On November 16th, through Bertie County by Woodville, bivouacked in a mile of Rockville, making nineteen (19) miles. On November 17th, we reached Murfreesborough [Hertford County], about twenty-two (22) miles. On November 18th, we marched through the town; reception and escort by Colonel Wheeler's Cavalry. Reached Monroe, VA, a ferry on the Nottoway River, eighteen (18) miles. On November 19th, we crossed the Nottoway River, passed through Franklin, six (6) miles beyond, and went into camp. Line of defense includes this point with old South Quay and Cherry Grove. Heavy entrenchments thrown up along this linea week's work. Brig. Gen. Roger A. Pryor (VA), with a portion of Brig. Gen. James J. Pettigrew's (NC) Brigade, is in command at Franklin, Brig. Gen. Pettigrew's headquarters being at Petersburg.\n\nOn December 8th, a detachment of the 56th NC Regiment, with another from the 42nd NC Regiment, have rebuilt the bridge over the Blackwater River at Joyner's Store. A gunboat on the river was fired into by a portion of Company I, under 1st Lt. Henry A.L. Sweezy. On December 9th, our detachments returned from Joyner's Store, bivouacked near the 52nd NC Regiment, who had been with us at Wilmington last Summer. On December 10th, we rejoined the regiment in camp, expecting an advance of the enemy by morning. 1st Lt. Matthew W. Fatherly, of Company C, had fired into a patrol gunboat at the junction of Nottoway and Blackwater rivers. On December 11th, Col. Paul F. Faison, with six (6) companies, reported to Brig. Gen. Roger A. Pryor (VA) at Franklin, leaving the other four (4) companies with Lt. Col. Granville G. Luke at New South Quay. Brig. Gen. Pryor made a foraging expedition across the river through Carrsville and Windsor, returning on December 28th without loss, and having taken one prisoner.\n\nWhile on the Blackwater River we were thrown with the 11th NC Regiment, now under Col. Collett Leventhorpe, who had been a Captain in the British Army. To this regiment the 56th NC Regiment would concede the palm for superiority in the manual of arms, while for excellence in tactics, military bearing and discipline, it yielded to none. Col. Faison was fresh from West Point, and the officers had chosen him with a full appreciation of the importance of these essentials. Of our service along the Blackwater River the writer heard Brig. Gen. Pryor say: \"Colonel Faison was always on time with his regiment.\"\n\nThe regiment was also fortunate in the assignment of its Quartermaster, Commissary and Surgeons, Capt. George B. Barnes and Capt. Thomas C. Halyburton being efficient men of affairs, while Drs. Columbus A. Thomas, Charles H. Ladd, Moses J. DeRosset, and Cader G. Cox stood high in their profession. Dr. DeRosset had taken a foreign course, and was an accomplished French and German scholar.\n\nEASTERN NORTH CAROLINA.\n\nOn January 4, 1863, off with Brig. Gen. James J. Pettigrew's (NC) Brigade for Rocky Mount, NC, reaching that point about dark. On January 17th, we were on to Goldsborough, and camped within a short distance of Brig. Gen. John R. Cooke's (NC) Brigade, Brig. Gen. Junius Daniel's (NC) being on the other side of the town.\n\nAn advance of the enemy is anticipated from the coast. On January 20th, went into bivouac near Brig. Gen. Pettigrew's Brigade, two (2) miles east of Magnolia Station [Duplin County]. On January 21st, we bivouacked near the academy east of Kenansville, and reported to Brig. Gen. Robert Ransom, and thus became a part of that brigade.\n\nOn February 22nd, off for Wilmington, and at Camp Lamb until February 24th, when we marched out to Old Topsail Sound. On March 9th, Brig. Gen. Ransom followed with the 25th, 35th, and 49th NC Regiments.\n\nOn March 28th, Capt. John W. Graham, Company D, detailed to relieve Adjutant Edward J. Hale as Judge Advocate, since early in January, of court-martial, sitting in Wilmington. 2nd Lt. Robert D. Graham has been Acting Adjutant in the absence of Adjutant Hale. Brigade remaining here about ten (10) days, and passing through Goldsborough, where a short halt was made, reached Kinston on April 1st.\n\nOn April 17th, we marched out of camp, east of the premises of George Washington, and proceeding across the river, expected to go down the Dover Road some eighteen (18) miles to reinforce the 59th NC Regiment, which had engaged the enemy at Sandy Ridge. Learning of their withdrawal, we bivouacked on the south side of the river. On April 19th, we marched to Wyse's Fork, and offered battle; but the enemy withdrew, and we returned to camp at Kinston.\n\nOn April 24th, the 56th NC Regiment is on picket duty east of Wyse's Fork, below Kinston. Companies H and K, under Capt. Francis R. Alexander [K], hold the Neuse River Road; Companies E, G and I, under Capt. Lawson Harrill [I], the Dover Road at Gum Swamp, while Companies A, B, D and F, under Maj. Henry F. Schenk, were posted on the Upper Trent Road at Noble's Farm. Company A was held in reserve.\n\nFIRST GUM SWAMP.\n\nOn April 28th, the enemy driving in the picket line, attacked Companies E, G, and I about 3 p.m. Their line shows four (4) flags, indicating as many regiments, say 1,600 men, in the front line, while our total is 180 men, with earthworks proving rather a death-trap than a defense. The slight elevation of the railroad embankment, four or five (4-5) feet, as it emerges eastward from the swamp, had been utilized to face the enemy advancing on our left flank. This faced north, while a breastwork of equal length, say 150 yards, facing east, starting at a right angle from this improvised line, extended around southward and then westward into the same swamp.\n\nThus the enemy, advancing to the crest of the elevated ground on the south, overlooking the railroad embankment, could count our men aligned along it. In this unequal contest the detachment of three (3) companies under Capt. Lawson Harrill [Company I] held their position for two (2) hours, when they were joined by the Colonel, who, after continuing the fight stubbornly on this and the second line occupied on the west side of the swamp, over three (3) hours, at the approach of night, finding the enemy in sufficient numbers to surround his men, withdrew them. Citizens in their rear report the enemy's loss at 10 killed and 18 wounded. Our loss was one officer and three (3) men killed. This officer is 1st Lt. Jarvis B. Lutterloh [mortally wounded, died the next day], of Fayetteville, commanding Company E. His genial spirit and gallant behavior had made him a favorite throughout the regiment. The men killed were Private Neill T. McNeill, of Moore County; Private Washington M. Vickers, of Orange County, and Private Miles M. Nelson, of Henderson County.\n\nA courier from Maj. Gen. Daniel H. Hill (NC) about sundown reached the four (4) companies at the upper Trent River crossing to warn them that they were now cut off, when Maj. Henry F. Schenck drew in his pickets, and avoiding the column by a circuitous march, had all at Wyse's Forks within the lines about sunrise. This was the Major's last field service. He had long fought against failing health, but was now completely broken down and was at once sent to the hospital, from which he was eventually retired by the board of examining surgeons, with the respect and sympathy of his many friends.\n\nOn May 16th, Brig. Gen. John R. Cooke's North Carolina Brigade has come to Kinston from the vicinity of Charleston, SC. On May 17th, the 56th NC Regiment relieves a regiment of Brig. Gen. Junius Daniel's North Carolina Brigade on outpost duty at Gum Swamp, which is eight (8) miles below Kinston, on the Dover Road. The line of defense has been improved by Col. Henry M. Rutledge with his 25th NC Regiment of Brig. Gen. Robert Ransom's (NC) Brigade. The breastwork, already noted, extending out of the east side of the swamp at a point on the south (right), and continuing around to the north to the fatal railroad embankment (here running back through the swamp at a right angle), is now carried across it, extending the arc of the circle northwest until it enters the swamp again. The railroad embankment thus becomes a traverse, while others are added against the enfilade from the east and south. The country road from New Bern to Kinston here winding like the letter S crosses the Atlantic & North Carolina Railroad three (3) times, and thus with it completes a dollar mark ($) within two (2) miles behind us. A redoubt with one gun commands the first crossing immediately in our rear.\n\nMay 21st. Scouts late this afternoon report an advance of the enemy from New Bern, four (4) companies of cavalry having crossed Core Creek.\n\nSECOND GUM SWAMP.\n\nMay 22nd. While the regiment is in line of battle, seven (7) companies occupying the circular earthworks, with the other three (3) posted at gaps in the swamp occurring on the right flank, Company I occupying the extreme point a mile to the south, our pickets are driven in at daylight. 2nd Lt. Robert D. Graham soon thereafter calls the attention of the Colonel to an order plainly heard on the left, \"Throw out your skirmishers,\" and is sent out with six (6) men to reconnoiter. Finds the enemy advancing a strong line of skirmishers, with a line of battle behind them, opens the battle by getting the first fire, and returns to report their position. The left wing, ready and waiting for them as they rush forward to the assault, receives them with a steady fire, and they take shelter in a screen of dense woods separated from us by an open space of 100 yards in width.\n\nThe fire here is maintained briskly for some time, and then their next regiment advances against the right wing of our seven (7) companies, where the reception is equally effective, again silencing their fire. These demonstrations after a considerable interval are renewed with the same result, and the third time all is silent.\n\nAt this point Col. Paul F. Faison expressed to the writer a determination to charge them, and sent him around their right flank with twenty (20) men to locate them. It was soon evident why they had not up to this time, about 10:30 a.m., used against our front their third regiment of infantry supporting the first two (2), nor the three (3) pieces of artillery held under cover near the Dover Road and supported by the four (4) companies of cavalry, of which we heard the evening before, constituting the brigade here assembled. Another force, whose strength we must learn by feeling it, is now rapidly closing in on the Dover Road directly in rear of our right flank. They have not pierced any point in the line committed to the 56th NC Regiment; but however there, they have gained the rear of the redoubt, and can soon rake the road through the swamp with our own gun. The Colonel is amazed that there is no attack upon them by the always reliable regiment that had been posted at the next crossing as our reserve. They soon develop a considerable force, taking the redoubt in the rear, and a hasty retreat along the railroad before they can gain it, now offers the only escape from capture by the two (2) brigades between which the battalion is being wedged in. Col. Faison accordingly withdrew it, and keeping up a running fire, saved the greater portion of his command before the enemy got possession of the railroad.\n\nThe enemy had rushed in between 2nd Lt. Robert D. Graham's reconnoitering party and the retiring battalion, but by a circuitous route through the swamp, he joined the rear companies as they were successfully replying to an attack from the swamp upon the left flank of the column. The defense was here vigorously maintained for some time, Lt. Col. Granville G. Luke shouting: \"Give it to them boys; it will be all right tomorrow.\" But the left flank and rear of our new line of battle are now open to the advancing brigade that we have fought throughout the morning on the east side of the swamp, while our right flank and its rear are commanded by the other brigade, which after gaining the crossing that was occupied by our reserve regiment when the battle opened, is rushing in from that point on the west to join the line coming over the railroad embankment from the south, and thus completing the circle around us.\n\nThe battle is evidently over, and we must save as many men as we can through the swamp in our rear north of the railroad. Plunging into the dense tall growth of reeds, we were met by demands to surrender. The alternative seemed to be capture or to receive a volley of musketry at close quarters. But the cover of the reeds was complete at a short distance. Taking advantage of this and playing men as pawns, the writer sent the smaller number between himself and the enemy directly into their hands. Without waiting to see this maneuver completed, he faced about and set the column in motion in another direction. The enemy realized only about 20 percent of the prize that was within their grasp at this point; for 150 men were thus rescued with the assistance of 3rd Lt. Charles M. Payne, of Company K, since an able Presbyterian Doctor of Divinity, recently deceased.\n\nAdjutant Edward J. Hale, Jr., who had acted with coolness and gallantry throughout the whole engagement, was near this point of the rear guard and brought out a good number.\n\nIf there was any officer of the regiment who failed to measure up to his duty in either of the two (2) battles at this outpost, we never discovered it. A court of inquiry acquitted our Colonel commanding. Of this result none of his comrades had entertained the least doubt.\n\nMajor Edward J. Hale has recently written me:\n\n\"I notice that Professor D. H. Hill, in 'Confederate Military History,' Vol. IV, page 155, says that the Fifty-sixth and Twenty-fifth Regiments were surprised at Gum Swamp 22 May, 1863. This is not true of the Fifty-sixth, whatever may be true of any others. We had been engaged for some hours at intervals with the enemy in our front, which we had completely protected and defended by repulsing his three several attacks. No part of the line defended by or belonging to the Fifty-sixth was punctured.\n\n\"After the third repulse of the enemy an order was given to withdraw the regiment to the Kinston side of Gum Swamp, as the enemy had crossed it some miles south of us. I was shot while directing this movement, but paid no attention to the matter until next day. Shortly after we had gotten most of the men across the country road, I remember that you and I were chatting beside the railroad about the want of orders. We saw the Twenty-fifth in line a few hundred yards to the rear (west). Word was started to them that with a change of front to the south, we would join them in attacking this new force of the enemy which was then coming up from that direction. But suddenly the Twenty-fifth was marched away towards Kinston. Our support being thus withdrawn, we then had nothing to do but to save as many as possible from capture.\"\n\nCapt. Wiliam G. Graves now writes: \"I have never felt any scruples about this fight, as no blame could be placed upon the men or regimental officers.\"\n\nBrig. Gen. Robert Ransom (NC), just returned from sick leave, barely escaped capture as he was coming to the outpost and had only passed to the front of the reserve, when he was met by a volley from the enemy at that instant emerging from the swamp to attack the rear of the redoubt and of our right flank. Two (2) regiments of the enemy had gained this position, led by a native guide in a circuitous, all night march of fourteen (14) miles in single file through a marsh that they found well nigh impassable. They thus avoided by several miles the line committed to the 56th NC Regiment, and came upon the field from the southwest.\n\nCol. Paul F. Faison was just then quiet for the want of something to shoot at; and was ready to make a counter-charge at the most favorable point; but it seems that his silence was mistaken in the rear for a surrender. This misunderstanding and the consequent withdrawal of the 25th NC Regiment at the very instant when it should have charged and united with us to crush their rear attack, was the mistake of the day. But from such mistakes even Napoleon was not free.\n\nMaj. Gen. Daniel H. Hill (NC), reaching the outpost with Brig. Gen. Robert Ransom's (NC) and Brig. Gen. John R. Cooke's (NC) Brigades about 5 p.m., pushed the enemy back within his fortifications at New Bern, a shell there killing Col. J. R. Jones, of the 58th PA Regiment, who had commanded the two brigades in the attack on the 56th NC Regiment [not accurateCol. Jones was killed the next day at Batchelder's Creek]. The brigade in our front was immediately under Colonel Pierson, of one of the four (4) Massachusetts regiments, while Colonel Jones accompanied the column that penetrated the swamp. He was a brave, energetic officer, and doubtless would have been appointed a general for this affair which he reported that afternoon as \"partially successful.\" He therein says that \"the enemy was able to defend himself sometime under cover of a swamp, and when finally broken, his men mostly escaped,\" and that he \"almost took General Ransom himself, who was accidentally at the post.\"\n\nOur loss was three (3) Lieutenants and 146 men captured, 1st Lt. David S. Ray, of Company D, dying of his wounds next day in New Bern. He was a gallant and meritorious officer, who had the confidence and affection of the company, of which he was in command. Capt. John W. Graham being on detail as Judge Advocate of the Court-Martial at Wilmington. 2nd Lt. Robert D. Graham was promoted to 1st Lieutenant, and 1st Sergeant William Turner was promoted to 2nd Lieutenant.\n\nQuery: How did it happen, when it was known at the outpost on the afternoon of May 21st, and presumably at headquarters early in the evening, that a column was advancing from New Bern on the same road by which the four (4) regiments had attacked this outpost within the last four (4) weeks, and this column was morally certain to reach it next morning, that an effective force of three (3) brigades at Kinston, only eight (8) miles distant and ample to give the enemy a complete surprise by striking the first blow, or at least simultaneously with their assault upon our single regiment and possibly cutting off their line of retreat, if strategically disposed during the night, did not start towards the scene of action until the next afternoon, after the incident was closed? No explanation is found in the official records or other source of information.\n\nMay 28th. The brigade is off for Virginia via Goldsborough and Weldon, reaching Petersburg by train in the night. May 29th, on to Richmond, and bivouacked at Camp Lee (State Fair Grounds).\n\nJune 2nd. Right-about to Petersburg again, and next day proceeded to Ivor, on the Norfolk & Petersburg Railroad.\n\nJune 13th. Brig. Gen. Robert Ransom has been promoted to Major General [commissioned on May 26, 1863]; Col. Matthew W. Ransom to Brigadier General today. Back in Petersburg and march over to Drewry's Bluff on the James River, halfway between Petersburg and Richmond. The appearance of troops in permanent quarters, on garrison duty, is here a novel sight to our command, so constantly in motion.\n\nJune 17th. Back to Petersburg, and June 21st to Halfway Station, towards Richmond. Occupied former cabins of Brig. Gen. Junius Daniel's North Carolina Brigade.\n\nDuring this month all the enlisted men captured at Gum Swamp, have been exchanged and returned to duty.\n\nJune 26th. Night march to Seven Pines.\n\nJune 29th. Brig. Gen. Matthew W. Ransom's (NC) Brigade is engaged in dismantling breastworks constructed here by the enemy under Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan a year ago. Major Generals Arnold Elzy (VA), Robert Ransom (NC), and Daniel H. Hill (NC) have recently been successively in command at Richmond. Both Brig. Gen. Matthew W. Ransom's and Brig. Gen. John R. Cooke's Brigades had been ordered up to participate in the counter-invasion to the north, but at the solicitation of these post commanders were retained for protection of the capital. General Robert E. Lee's letter on the subject says: \"I have always considered Cooke's and Ransom's Brigades as part of the Army of Northern Virginia.\"\n\nBATTLE AT CRUMP'S FARM [aka BOTTOM'S BRIDGE].\n\nOurs was now a duty of observation and reconnoissance to meet any demonstration of the enemy from the seacoast. Thus an opportunity was given to participate in one of the most brilliant campaigns of the warsharp, quick and decisive. The enemy watching our capital could learn approximately the strength of the small force, protecting it. Accordingly Federal Maj. Gen. John A. Dix and Maj. Gen. Erasmus D. Keyes, advancing cautiously by the way of the White House, apparently had a walk-over.\n\nJuly 2nd. Maj. Gen. Daniel H. Hill (NC), without waiting for them to approach nearer to his fortified line of defense, which he had not enough troops to adequately man, moved out rapidly upon them with Brig. Gen. Matthew W. Ransom's North Carolina, Brig. Gen. John R. Cooke's North Carolina, and Brig. Gen. Albert G. Jenkins' South Carolina Brigades, Branch's Virginia Battery of Artillery and three others-a total of sixteen (16) gunsand a squadron of cavalry. He met them at Crump's Farm, near Bottom's Bridge, between sunset and dark, and immediately opened such a vigorous assault that the enemy were compelled to assume the defensive, and night found them in full retreat, doubtless believing that those three (3) brigades must have been immensely reinforced since their last reports had come in. Brig. Gen. Ransom's Brigade sustained the only loss on our side, one man killed and two (2) wounded. Six or seven (6-7) prisoners taken admitted a loss of thirty (30) on their side.\n\nJuly 11th. To Petersburg again, and camped on Dunn's Farm.\n\nRAID AGAINST WELDON BRIDGE CHECKED.\n\nJuly 28th. A part of the 49th NC Regiment and three (3) companies of the 24th NC Regiment and a battery of Georgia Artillery, met Spear's Regiment of New York Cavalry and Dodge's Mounted Riflemen and several pieces of artillery at Boon's Mill, ten (10) miles south of Weldon and two (2) miles from Jackson, NC. The 56th NC Regiment arrived that evening, but the enemy had withdrawn. Disposition was made for attack that night; but they did not return. The 49th NC Regiment lost one man killed, and in the 24th NC Regiment three (3) were wounded. The enemy buried 11 of their dead on the field.\n\nAugust 1st. Back to Garysburg, and camped near Mr. Moody's.\n\nAugust 12th. To Halifax Court House, and August 13th took boat for Hamilton. Down the Roanoke River seventy-three (73) miles, arriving in the afternoon.\n\nAugust 14th. Company D, under 1st Lt. Robert D. Graham, detached to Poplar Point, and threw up breastworks covering the river landing.\n\nAugust 16th. Returned through Palmyra and Halifax to Garysburg.\n\nSeptember 1st. Capt. John W. Graham of Company D, on retirement of Maj. Henry F. Schenk, is promoted to Major, 1st Lt. Robert D. Graham to Captain, and Sergeant Joseph B. Coggin to 1st Lieutenant. For the succeeding four (4) months, eight (8) companies of this regiment and the 21st NC Regiment were posted in the West to meet any incursions from East Tennessee, and to break up the refuge found there by deserters and lawless characters from the several States, and to see that the Conscription Act was fairly enforced. The effort was to gain friends, and make no new enemies for the State in her desperate struggle, and thus keep the people united in domestic tranquility. The moral effect of this movement was salutary, whether now viewed from a Confederate or Federal standpoint, and it is beyond doubt that it was so regarded by Federal Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant when the war was over, and the proscription naturally following it was at fever heat.\n\nTwo companies, H and E, under Capt. William G. Graves [Company H], were protecting the building of the Confederate ram Albemarle on the Roanoke River near Halifax, at Edwards' Ferry.\n\nOctober 24th. Adjutant Edward J. Hale, Jr., is promoted to Assistant Adjutant General and assigned to Brig. Gen. James H. Lane's (NC) Brigade. As his modesty naturally forbade the incorporation of his military record in his history of the Bethel Regiment [1st NC Volunteers], and as he contributed so largely to the efiiciency of the 56th NC Regiment, it will be a pleasure to every survivor of the latter to have an outline of so brilliant a career here preserved for the honor of the State that we all love so well.\n\nPrivate in Bethel Regiment April 17 to November 13, 1861; 2nd Lieutenant December 2, 1861, and Adjutant 56th NC Regiment August 1, 1862, to October 24, 1863; Judge Advocate Court-Martial at Wilmington January to March, 1863.\n\nDesignated by General Robert E. Lee to convey to Federal Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant assent and permit to remove his dead and wounded lost at Cold Harbor on June 2, 1864, Lt. Gen. Grant reluctantly thus acknowledging a defeat.\n\nAssigned as Assistant Adjutant General to Brig. Gen. William B. Taliaferro's (VA) Division, Army Northern Virginia, but re-assigned to Brig. Gen. James H. Lane's (NC) Brigade on petition of its officers, in consequence of Brig. Gen. Lane being absent, wounded.\n\nFor ''conspicuous gallantry and merit\" recommended by Brig. Gen. James H. Lane (NC), Maj. Gen. Cadmus M. Wilcox (NC) and Lt. Gen. A. P. Hill (VA) for Colonel of the 28th NC Regiment on request of all its officers then present, September 26, 1864; but the Act of the CSA Congress was found to provide only for the regular line officers.\n\nIn March of 1865, he was commissioned Major and Assistant Adjutant General; wounded at 2nd Gum Swamp and at the Wilderness, and was in the surrender at Appomattox. At the crisis in the battle of Fussell's Mills, August 16, 1864, (commanding the Darbytown Road in front of Richmond), Brig. Gen. James H. Lane's (NC) Brigade was put in under the eye of General Robert E. Lee to recapture the lost line. Col. William M. Barbour [37th NC Regiment] commanding, was wounded and the charge arrested, but the Adjutant General assumed command and pushed forward to a speedy victory. In the presence of the troops he was thanked by the chief engineer, Brig. Gen. Walter H. Stevens (VA). For the latter's consideration he then recommended that the line of defense be here so changed as to give full effect to the modern long-range small arms, commanding approaches over wide plains, therefore to be preferred instead of precipices. This was then a new departure in fortifications, but was promptly adopted and superintendence of the work given to Maj. Hale, so that when the next morning dawned the enemy found four (4) miles of such defenses awaiting their assault, and withdrew. It was effectually adopted by the Turks at Plevna, while much later the British lost Majuba Hill by adhering to the antiquated system.\n\nIn the North Carolina victory at 2nd Reams Station, August 25, 1864, he had a similar experience. Brig. Gen. James Conner (VA) was disabled and Col. William H.A. Speer [28th NC Regiment] mortally wounded just as Brig. Gen. James H. Lane's (NC) Brigade started forward. He assumed command, and they were among the first over the line.\n\nLosing only by a legal technicality the promotion to Colonel in the line, as above mentioned, the extraordinary commission of Major and Assistant Adjutant General of Brigade was given him as some measure of compensation. He was succeeded as Adjutant by John W. Faison.\n\nFIRST EXPEDITION AGAINST NEW BERN.\n\nIn January of 1864, an expedition was organized for the recapture of New Bern, under Maj. Gen. George E. Pickett (VA).\n\nJanuary 28th. Reached Goldsborough, the 56th NC Regiment reported to Brig. Gen. Montgomery D. Corse, commanding a Virginia Brigade. At night Brig. Gen. Seth M. Barton (AR), commanding his own brigade and the other four (4) regiments under Brig. Gen. Matthew W. Ransom (NC), marched out on the Neuse River Road for New Bern.\n\nJanuary 31st. Column consisting of Brig. Gen. Robert F. Hoke's North Carolina, Brig. Gen. Thomas L. Clingman's North Carolina, and Brig. Gen. Montgomery D. Corse's Virginia Brigade (temporarily including the 56th NC Regiment), took the Dover Road, passed through Gum Swamp, whence we marched down the railroad track some six (6) miles, turning into the country road again at Sandy Ridge, the scene of a fight between the 49th NC Regiment and the enemy last year, and went into bivouac about eight (8) miles beyond, making twenty-three (23) miles that day. Skirmishers out that night from Brig. Gen. Corse's Brigade under Maj. John W. Graham, of the 56th NC Regiment.\n\nFebruary 1st. Set out at 2 a.m. and captured the outpost at Bachelor's Creek. Here Col. Henry M., Shaw, 8th NC Regiment, was killed at the opening of the engagement. A portion of Brig. Gen. Robert F. Hoke's (NC) men, with Companies B and I, of the 56th NC Regiment, were actively engaged. Our total loss was eight (8) killed and fifty (50) wounded. We captured 250 prisoners with the blockhouse. The railroad crosses the creek at this point, and the 56th NC Regiment made a race to strike the track in the rear of the train carrying the residue of the enemy to New Bern. They escaped. The fort was destroyed and a large quantity of Quartermaster and Commissary stores secured.\n\nOur part being thus accomplished, we listened in vain for Brig. Gen. Seth M. Barton's (AR) guns as a signal for our further advance. At night Capt. Robert D. Graham, with 100 men from Companies D and K, of the 56th NC Regiment, with two (2) pieces of artillery, was posted by Brig. Gen. Montgomery D. Corse (VA) on the Washington Road as a force of observation against a garrison cut off in the fort at the crossing of Bachelor's Creek. At daylight Colonel Chew came out with the 29th and 30th VA Regiments and with Capt. Graham's detachment moved upon the garrison. The 30th VA Regiment and the artillery was moved around to the right of the road, while the rest of the force took position on the left. A demand was then made for surrender; and the enemy finding himself within point-blank range of the artillery in his rear, to which he could not reply, without bringing his own outside the fort, capitulated. Our spoils were a section of artillery with caisson, and 100 stand of small arms, with a supply of ammunition. The prisoners, 120 men and four (4) officers. Captain Cowdy commanding. Meanwhile the enemy had advanced from New Bern upon Brig. Gen. Hoke, and been repulsed.\n\nBrig. Gen. James G. Martin (NC), on the Wilmington Road, had carried everything before him up to the reserve works. Every assault had been successful, and Brig. Gen. Seth M. Barton (AR) could readily have found men to take the task assigned him. But as he reported it impracticable, the whole expedition was finally abandoned, when it seemed the general opinion that a determined assault would have been crowned with success.\n\nI leave the above recital, as most of this sketch, just as written during the war. On consulting U.S. Official Records, I now find that I have expressed the opinion of both Brig. Gen. Robert F. Hoke (NC) and Maj. Gen. George E. Pickett (VA). But it therein also appears that Brig. Gen. Seth M. Barton (AR) in his official report, says that before abandoning his attempt to cross Brice's Creek, he made, together with the two (2) brigade commanders under him, a personal reconnoissance. He requested a court of inquiry, and this request was recommended accordingly to Adjutant General Samuel Cooper by General Robert E. Lee.\n\nFebruary 5th. Rejoined our own brigade under Brig. Gen. Matthew W. Ransom (NC) at Kinston, and on February 7th, we reached Weldon on train via Goldsborough.\n\nFebruary 8th. Ordered to Richmond, but countermanded just as the train is about to pull out. In camp again near the Moody house. Daily exercises in company and battalion drill, each Captain successively acting as regimental commander.\n\nEXPEDITION TO SOUTH MILLS.\n\nFebruary 26th. Off for Franklin, VA, on the Blackwater River, crossed at Old South Quay, and marched to South Mills, Camden County, NC. From this point commissary stores are gathered; and a detachment of the enemy appearing, is chased down the Dismal Swamp canal by Colonel Dearing with his battalion of cavalry to within twelve (12) miles of Norfolk. Captured a 1st Lieutenant, a Surgeon and half a dozen privates. The object accomplished, the wagon trains under our protection having been loaded and started back, the return commences on the night of March 4th, and at the two (2) creeks first to be crossed, Capt. Robert D. Graham's company of the 56th NC Regiment, as rear guard, had prepared bright fires that there should be no delay in crossing. The enemy were reported to have ascended the Chowan River, and were expected to pay us some attention before we were back across the Blackwater River with our long train of wagons loaded with provisions. Halted at Sandy Cross, twenty (20) miles from South Mills, for two (2) days. No appearance of the enemy.\n\nRECAPTURE SUFFOLK.\n\nMarch 7th. Proceeded to within eight (8) miles of Old South Quay and learned that the enemy had again occupied Suffolk.\n\nMarch 9th. Passed through Somerton at 10 a.m., and at a church within three (3) miles of Suffolk, routed a cavalry outpost and pressed on to the railroad. Here the enemy's cavalry formed to charge the 24th NC Regiment; but a few well-directed shots put them to flight. Capt. Cicero A. Durham, promoted to Assistant Quartermaster for gallantry in the line and known as the Fighting Quartermaster of the 49th NC Regiment, gathered a squad of a dozen mounted men among the teamsters, and charged them in turn. Seeing the paucity of his numbers, they made a stand, but were attacked with such vigor that they resumed their flight before the infantry could get within range. The 56th NC Regiment was second in the column, led by Lt. Col. Granville G. Luke, and complimented on the good order sustained on a double-quick pursuit of three (3) miles. The only escape for the cavalry was by completing a semi-circle outside the earthworks, defending the town, before we could run through on the street and road forming the chord to the arc. With their spurs and the aid of the shells from our artillery, they beat the race.\n\nWe had no cavalry and did not lose a man, but Federal Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Butler, like Job's warhorse, \"smelleth the battle afar off,\" and pens to the Secretary of War the following bulletin as it appears in Official War Records:\n\nFort Monroe, 12 March, 1864.\n\nNo. 1.\n\nCole's Cavalry, Second United States, had a skirmish the day before yesterday with the enemy near Suffolk, Va. While making a rcconnoissance, they came upon Ransom's Brigade, consisting of four regiments of infantry, four pieces of artillery and 300 cavalry. The enemy made a charge upon two squadrons of Cole's, and were handsomely repulsed with a loss of about sixty.\n\nThe charge brought the colored soldiers into a hand-to-hand fight with the rebels, and the enthusiastic testimony of their officers is that that they behaved with the utmost courage, coolness and daring. I am perfectly satisfied with my negro cavalry.\n\nBenj. F. Butler,\n\nMajor-General.\n\nHon. E. M. Stanton.\n\nWe pursued them to Bernard's Mills, capturing the camp of the white troops and returned with one piece of artillery and considerable stores.\n\nThree (3) negro soldiers took refuge in a house in town and refusing to surrender, perished in its flames. Another, rushing out with his gun and fighting to the last, was shot.\n\nMarch 11th, returned to Franklin via Carrsville. March 12th, off by rail to Weldon, and in camp near Mr. Moody's at Grarysburg, and on March 17th, muster and inspection for January and February, 1864, by Colo. Paul F. Faison.\n\nTHE PLYMOUTH CAMPAIGN.\n\nApril 14th. The 24th, 25th, and 56th NC Regiment, under Brig. Gen. Matthew W. Ransom (NC), set out by rail and reported to Brig. Gen. Robert F. Hoke (NC) at Tarborough. The 49th NC Regiment was on outpost duty near Edenton, and its place was now supplied by the 8th NC Regiment, from Brig. Gen. Thomas L. Clingman's (NC) Brigade.\n\nApril 15th. The column, consisting of Brig. Gen. Robert F. Hoke's (NC) Brigade under Col. John T. Mercer of the 21st GA Regiment, which was then with it; Brig. Gen. James L. Kemper's (VA) Brigade, under Col. William R. Terry, and Brig. Gen. Matthew W. Ransom's (NC) Brigade with Pegram's Battery, under Brig. Gen. Ransom, and Stribblings', Graham's Virginia, Miller's, Moseley's, and Read's batteries of artillery belonging to Col. James Dearing's command, and Dearing's Battalion of cavalry, took up the line of march against Plymouth, NC. At Hamilton we were joined by the 35th NC Regiment. Passing through Williamston and Jamesville, we reached the vicinity Sunday, April l7th, a little before nightfall.\n\nImmediately a strong line of skirmishers, including Company I, of the 56th NC Regiment, was thrown out from Brig. Gen. Ransom's Brigade, under Maj. John W. Graham, and pushed forward nearly to the entrenchments. A picket post of eleven (11) men was surprised, nine (9) captured, one killed and one escaped. A reconnoissance in force was made in front of Fort Gray, on Warren's Neck, between the mouths of two (2) creeks emptying into the Roanoke River, two (2) miles west of Plymouth, and Col. Dearing's artillery crippled one of the gunboats so that it sank on reaching the wharf. A redoubt was immediately begun on the Jamesville Road leading south for our 32-pound Parrott gun. The ironclad C.S.S. Albemarle, Cdr. James W. Cooke, was expected during the night. Fort Gray's armament was one 100-pounder and two 32-pounders.\n\nApril 18th. The C.S.S. Albemarle, for some reason, was making slow progress down the Roanoke River, and the day passed without a sign of it. Shelling at intervals was kept up, the 56th NC Regiment suffering but one casualty, the wounding of a man in Company H. During the night Col. Faison, with 250 men, had completed the earthwork near the Washington and Jamesville Road from which to bombard the fort at Sanderson's.\n\nAt sundown a demonstration on both sides of Lee's Mill, Bath Road, was made against the enemy's south front by the artillery and Brig. Gen. Matthew W. Ransom's (NC) Brigade. Our assaulting column was formed with the left resting on Frank Fagan's house on the Jamesville Road, a mile and a quarter south of town, and two (2) regiments, the 24th and 8th NC Regiment, beyond the Lee Mill Road at Redd Gap. The 56th NC Regiment was next on the left, and then the 35th NC Regiment, while the 25th NC Regiment connected us with Brig. Gen. Robert F. Hoke's (NC) right. The batteries following on the heels of a battalion of sharpshooters composed of Companies B, I, E, and A, of the 56th NC Regiment, under their worthy CaptainsFranklin N. Roberts, Lawson Harrill, Joseph G. Lockhart, and Noah H. Hughes, led by Capt. John C. Pegram, Assistant Adjutant General, driving the enemy over their breastworks, advanced steadily from position to position, firing with the utmost rapidity, while the rest of the brigade in the line of battle kept pace with them. Brig. Gen. Ransom was conspicuous on the field, keeping his mount throughout the engagement. This was kept up till 10 p.m., the enemy replying with great spirit from his forts and gunboats, carrying twenty (20) pieces. The object was as far as possible to draw the enemy's fire in this direction, while Brig. Gen. Hoke's Brigade assaulted in earnest the \"85th Redoubt\" at the Sanderson House, some distance to our left. The fort was carried after a very stubborn resistance and the death of its commander, Captain Chapin. Among our killed we mourn the loss of the brigade commander, the gallant Col. John T. Mercer, of the 21st GA Regiment. 3rd Lt. Charles R. Wilson, of Company D, and 14 men of the 56th NC Regiment were wounded at our end. Col. Mercer was a West Point classmate of Maj. Gen. J. E. B. Stuart (VA), Lt. Gen. John B. Hood (TX), Brig. Gen. George Washington Custis Lee (VA), and Maj. Gen. William D. Pender (NC). He is buried at Tarborough beside his last named comrade.\n\nApril 19th. Towards day Col. William J. Clarke, with his own, the 24th NC Regiment, and the 56th NC Regiment, was posted below the town on the Columbia Road, to prevent escape in that direction. But the enemy was still confident in the strength of his fortifications, even after the loss of the \"85th Redoubt\" and the arrival of our ram, Albemarle, the same night passing the big guns at Warren's Neck unharmed. It sank one of their gunboats, the Southfield, and chased off the other two (2), the naval commander, Flusser, being killed on the deck of the Miami. The enemy still held a continuous, thoroughly fortified line, well constructed, from a point on the river, near Warren's Neck, along their west and south fronts, and terminating on the east in a swamp, bordering which a deep creek, known as Conaby, a mile or two further east, runs into the Roanoke River, on the south bank of which Plymouth is situated. It has four (4) streets parallel with the river and five (5) at right angles to it. Fort Williams, projecting beyond the south face of the parallelogram, is ready for action on all four (4) sides and enfilades, right and left, the whole south front of the fortifications, while Battery Worth was built to command the west, water and land, approach.\n\nBetween the latter and Warren's Neck was \"85th Redoubt\" at Sanderson's House. At Boyle's steam mill near the road entering Second Street from the west was another redoubt outside the entrenchments, and within the southwest angle still another at Harriet Toodles'. On the east center was Fort Comfort, with a redoubt on either side of the Columbia Road at James Bateman's and Charles Latham's. Brig. Gen. Robert F. Hoke (NC) ordered an assault from this (east) side by Brig. Gen. Matthew W. Ransom's (NC) Brigade. Accordingly that night our sharpshooters effected a crossing of Conaby Creek on felled trees with some opposition. A pontoon bridge was laid, and before the night was far advanced, the brigade was over. With a line of skirmishers out in front, the brigade slept in line of battle, and perhaps never more soundly, for tired nature's sweet restorer was welcome, even on the eve of certain battle.\n\nApril 20th. At the first break of day Brig. Gen. Matthew W. Ransom (NC) was again in the saddle, and his ringing voice came down the line: ''Attention, brigade!\" Every man was upon his feet instantly, and the adjusting of twisted blankets across the left shoulder and under the belt at the right hip was only the work of another moment; the line of battle was formed, \"Fix bayonets,\" \"Trail arms!\" \"Forward march!\" and the charge began. The alignment was as follows: The 56th NC Regiment on the right, flanked by Company I, as sharpshooters, (resting on the Roanoke River and near the Albemarle, then engaged, as it had been at intervals through the night, with Battery Worth on the river face of the town), and 25th, 35th, 8th, and 24th NC Regiments successively on to the left. On our part of the line a large drove of cattle was encountered and driven on as a living wall between us and the enemy until they reached the canal, down which they refused to plunge, or escort us further. Maddened by this strange spectacle of \"man's inhumanity to man,\" they turned about, and \"with no reputation to lose,\" dashing through our line, sought safety in flight. The canal was found with steep banks, but fortunately with fordable water. Ranks were necessarily broken in getting across, but were soon in perfect order on the farther side, and the forward movement resumed. The next obstacle was a swamp, in places waist deep, through which the regiment floundered as best it could, impeded by the mire and cypress knees with which it abounded. The 56th NC Regiment was the first through, and immediately reforming under an oblique fire from the left, charged up a slight hill, and routed the opposing regiment sheltered behind a fence of palings, here the outer line of the town. This and the adjacent houses blocked further advance in regimental line of battle.\n\nBut the halt here was only for a moment. Company I pressed straight forward, sweeping everything before them between Water Street and the river bank, while the 25th NC Regiment on getting through the swamp and finding the 56th NC Regiment in its front, debouched to the right and thus went up Water Street between the 56th NC Regiment and its detached company. At the same instant Brig. Gen. Ransom, reaching this point, the 56th NC Regiment moved off by the left flank and entered the town on the next street east, by filing to the right, left in front. Maj. John W. Graham was at the extreme left, now head of column, and on gaining the open space about the county jail, deployed the regiment forward into line of battle, just in time to checkmate a battery of artillery taking position to rake the street with its guns. These movements and the obstacles encountered, again divided the regiment, carrying the Colonel and Lieutenant Colonel back to Water Street to direct the extreme right, while the Major, with eight (8) companies, pressed forward to silence the artillery. The fire, delivered before we could reach them, was fortunately a little too high, the shells in a direct line being plainly visible as they passed over, and the guns were at once in our possessionnot, however, until one brave fellow had blown up his limber in our faces, killing his nearest horses and wounding several of our men. It would be a pleasure here to record his name. The man retreating with the caisson was killed in the street, with four (4) of his six (6) horses, by a shell from Fort Williams.\n\nThis wing of the regiment, then, without waiting for any support, as all seemed to have enough to do, swept on fighting between these two (2) streets the entire length of the town, and without a halt charged the redoubt in their front, constituting a west section of the enemy's heavy line of fortifications, facing front and rear. Here they captured a Pennsylvania regiment, and Maj. John W. Graham, mounting the works with the regimental flag, waved it to Brig. Gen. Robert F. Hoke's (NC) Brigade, now under Lt. Col. William G. Lewis (afterwards Brigadier General), and thus announced that the way was open on that side. In this last charge the 24th NC Regiment went in abreast with us, having entered the town by the Columbia Road, which leads into Second Street, after crossing Conaby Creek with a northwest trend and then midway changing to due west. While the 8th and 35th NC Regiments swung around to invest Fort Comfort, the 24th NC Regiment overcoming all opposition before them at the Bateman and Latham redoubts, pushed forward and connected with our left flank as we struck the fortificationsredoubt and entrenched camp.\n\nMaj. Graham's prisoners, some 300 of infantry and artillery, were turned over to Capt. Joseph G. Lockhart, when, under shelter of a ravine, uniting his battalion with Brig. Gen. Robert F. Hoke's (NC) Brigade, he swept down first the west and then the south entrenchments to Fort Williams, into which Federal Brig. Gen. Henry W. Wessels had withdrawn with the remnant of his army. The 24th NC Regiment came up on the other side. After consultation with Lt. Col. William G. Lewis, it was deemed unnecessary to assault it, as its surrender would be compelled by our artillery with the aid of sharpshooters being rapidly posted to overlook its interior from the windows and tops of the nearest houses. The two (2) opposing generals then met in a personal interview, and the demand to capitulate was refused. But the inevitable was soon acknowledged by raising a white flag, as we had silenced every gun in the fort.\n\nMeantime, the part assigned to Capt. Lawson Harrill's men, under their fearless leader, had been as effectually accomplished. Through water hip deep, they had crossed the canal and swamp, and keeping near the river, passing around houses and bursting through garden and yard fences, they reached the rear of Battery Worth, containing the 200-pounder, specially provided to anticipate the coming of our ironclad Albemarle. One volley was sufficient. The white flag was run up and the battery, with some twenty (20) artillerymen, surrendered to him.\n\nTaking the prisoners with them from this battery on the river, they immediately charged to their left and thus struck in the flank and rear the right section of the enemy's line of battle occupying the breastworks, here on Water Street, facing up the river. His demand to surrender was promptly complied with, and while Capt. Harrill here gathered in his prisoners, largely outnumbering his own rank and file, Lt. Col. Lewis' men who had held the attention of the enemy in their front, came in at a double-quick over the causeway leading through the swamp on the west of Plymouth, passed Capt. Harrill's position, and joined Maj. Graham's detachment at the upper ravine further to the south, as above noted.\n\nHow does it happen, then, that the capture of Battery Worth, or Fort Hal, noted above as by Company I, has been claimed for Company B, with whom were Col. Paul F. Faison and Col. James Dearing (VA), a portion of the 25th NC Regiment supporting the artillery? Both claims are literally true.\n\nA correspondent to the Fayetteville Observer, on April 22, 1864, says: \"On the river face of the town was a camp entrenched to resist any attack from the water, and a little lower down an earthwork for the same purpose.\" The latter, admitted to be Battery Worth, we must observe the distinction between the two, though close together.\n\nAs to the time of the first movement, Capt. Lawson Harrill's report is embodied in the foregoing narration. Federal Brig. Gen. Henry W. Wessells report: \"At daylight the following day, 20 April, while my right and front were seriously threatened, the enemy advanced rapidly against my left, assaulting and carrying the line in that quarter, penetrating the town along the river and capturing Battery Worth.\" This left the entrenched camp not yet captured, and as no other Confederate troops were in that quarter at that early hour, the claim of Company I to Battery Worth is thus afiirmed.\n\nFrom this point of time Brig. Gen. Wessells thus continues: \"A line of skirmishers was formed from the breastworks perpendicularly towards the river in hopes of staying the advance. This effort succeeded for a time; but the troops seemed discouraged and fell back to the entrenchments.\"\n\nThe conduct of the 56th NC Regiment was well calculated to create such discouragement, as it broke through all obstacles, driving the enemy from the streets, yards, houses, cellars, and bombproofs, from which Maj. Graham says they came out like a colony of prairie puppies, or groundhogs on the 2nd of February. As those not captured in this charge were thus gradually pressed back to their double-faced entrenchments, the infantry garrison in the entrenched camp at Battery Worth, guarding the water approach and, owing to the contour of the ground, not in sight from his side of the fortifications when Capt. Harrill some two (2) hours before had taken the artillerymen out of the battery, appear now to have had their attention diverted from the commotion of the Albemarle downstream to their right and Brig. Gen. Robert F. Hoke (NC) up the river to their left. They now for the first time saw their enemy in the town, and were ready with the portion of the retreating line that had joined them, to enfilade Company B as it came up. Here Col. Faison, with this gallant company under Capt. Franklin N. Roberts, had his hands full for some time and accomplished important results, as described by the subsequent Captain, then 1st Sergeant Alexander R. Carver:\n\n\"In this charge our 3rd Lt. Benjamin W. Thornton, fell on Water Street with a bullet through the side of his forehead near the eye. I stopped long enough to see the wound, and thought him dead; but he survived for a day or two. Our company had become detached by the evolutions and obstacles in getting through the town. Just before Brig. Gen. Henry W. Wessells capitulated, say by 9 or 10 o'clock, we had reached the vicinity of Fort Hal, with the 200-pound gun bearing on the river. It was full of the enemy, on whom we were firing with our rifles and they were briskly returning our fire. Col. Paul F. Faison came up to me during this firing, when I pointed to a hill on the right overlooking the fort, and said if the artillery were posted there, we would have the fort in five (5) minutes. Soon after he left me, I saw our battery open from the hill, and immediately a white handkerchief was hoisted on a bayonet above the fort. I was very near and ran for the fort. Col. James Dearing got across the moat and into the fort ahead of me, and jumped on tbe big gun as if he were going to spike it, when I met an officer at the gate and demanded his surrender. He asked to be allowed to surrender to some higher officer. I called Col. Dearing and he told him to surrender to me. He thereupon handed over his sword and pistol, which I kept during the war. I think he belonged to the infantry. He had on his overcoat.\"\n\nSo there were two (2) captures of the same fort, separated by an interval of two or three (2-3) hours.\n\nCol. James Dearing subsequently fell [as a Brigadier General] on April 6, 1865, at High Bridge [aka Farmville], on the retreat towards Appomattox Court House, in a hand-to-hand contest with Major Read, of Maj. Gen. Edward O.C. Ord's staff, both antagonists going down together. The big gun was naturally the chief attraction to him, and of course he believed to the day of his death that his portion of the line had captured it, whereas it clearly appears that it had been silent for at least two (2) hours, ever since Capt. Lawson Harrill carried off the artillerymen who had served it. It was the infantry of the adjoining entrenched camp, together with some others, who had taken refuge in the vacant fort, that he and Col. Faison so effectually silenced; and we may say in the spirit of the generous Admiral Winfield Scott Schley, who later said in 1901 \"there was glory enough for all.\"\n\nThe possibilities of such independent actions by detachments may be better understood when it is remarked that within the fortifications on the west side were three (3) ravines, and on an elevation between the lower one and the river was planted Battery Worth, with the entrenched camp lower down. The redoubt at Boyle's Steam Mill on the road on this side of the town, appears to have been blown up by a shell entering its magazine, and so it offered no resistance to our infantry, while that at Harriet Toodle's, about the southwest angle, and the intervening entrenched camps were taken with the connecting breastworks.\n\nThe writer was near Brig. Gen. Robert F. Hoke (NC) when he received Federal Brig. Gen. Henry W. Wessels, accompanied by his officers, as his prisoner. There was everything in his courteous and considerate bearing to lessen the sting of defeat. Dismounting from his horse and clasping the captive's hand, he assured him of his respect and sympathy, and added: ''After such a gallant defense you can bear the fortune of war without self-reproach.\"\n\nBrig. Gen. Henry W. Wessels' official report, made after his exchange four (4) months later, says that Brig. Gen. Hoke's conduct was courteous and soldier-like. His return of casualties, killed, wounded, and missing was 127 officers and 2,707 men, from the 16th CT Infantry, 2nd MA Heavy Artillery, 2nd NC (Union) Infantry, 12th NY Cavalry, 85th NY Infantry, 24th NY Battery, and 101st and 103rd PA Infantry. Besides 3,000 stand of small arms and some twenty (20) pieces of artillery, there was a large quantity of all other supplies.\n\nIn our advance there were no shirks. The respective muster rolls might be exhibited as lists of those deserving honorable mention. The splendid conduct of Color Guard Corporal Job C. Hughes, of Camden County [Company A], is here gratefully remembered.\n\nThe regimental colors were carried by a Sergeant, later on given the rank of Ensign by the Confederate Congress, and he was supported by eight (8) volunteer Corporals. This guard of three (3) ranks in line of battle formed the extreme left of the right center company. This position fell to Company D, and was retained by it to the end of the war. It was thus in the assault upon the redoubt beyond the head of Second Street that the Captain of this company found Corporal Hughes at his side while a blue coat in front was drawing a bead on him within a space less than the width of the street\"Hughes, kill that Yank,\" followed, and the enemy's aim was as deliberately changed to save his own life. There was one report from two (2) rifles, and both men went down. It was the last shot ever fired by the Federal. His sight was as good as that of his foeman, his minie ball perforating Corporal Hughes' blanket (13) thirteen times, as it was twisted and worn as above described, but ended with the penetration of the breast-boneprobably owing to his not having driven the ball home in too rapidly loading his piece. Within about a month he was at his post again. He was a brother of the gallant Capt. Noah H. Hughes of Company A. In this charge the brave Corporal William J. Daves, volunteer to the Color Guard from Company I, was killed, and Private James P. Sossaman, of Company K, was also severely wounded at the flag.\n\nThe Albemarle had advanced along the river front with the charge, firing over the line. The honor of capturing Fort Comfort on our left, fell to the 35th NC Regiment and it was renamed Fort Jones in honor of its Colonel [John G. Jones].\n\nBrig. Gen. Robert F. Hoke (NC) was thereupon promoted to Major General in recognition of this successful initiation of this campaign, and of a well earned record for gallantry and efliciency in the Army of Northern Virginia, and Col. James Dearing (VA) was made a Brigadier General. Lt. Col. William G. Lewis [43rd NC Regiment] was soon thereafter promoted to Brigadier General.\n\nIn the 56th NC Regiment, we have one complete company report of casualties:\n\nCompany D: Mortally wounded, Private James W. Hall, Private John W. Holsemback, and Private Simpson Riley3. Severely wounded, 3rd Lt. Charles R. Wilson, Corporals Green W. Montgomery, and William W. Redding, Privates William F. G. Barbee, DeWitt W. King, Cyrus Laws, James R. Miller, Burroughs Pool, James Roberts, Lewellyn Taylor, Thomas J. Taylor, Harris Wilkinson12. The commander of the company and others were also struck, but not put hors du combat.\n\nIn Company F, 1st Lt. Valentine J. Palmer, bravely leading Company F, was severely wounded as we passed the court house. 3rd Lt. Benjamin W. Thornton, of Company B, was mortally wounded, the ball entering just above the eye, and coming out near the ear, but was still able, though his sight was gone, to recognize the writer when he visited him with other wounded that evening. He was a faithful and efficient soldier from Fayetteville. The other regiments of the brigade also bore conspicuous parts. One company, at least, of the 56th NC Regiment, and perhaps nearly the whole regiment, here secured a complete equipment of first class rifles.\n\nCompany I was most fortunate in doing its gallant part, having none permanently disabled and the ever faithful Corporal William J. Daves at the colors being its only man killed today.\n\nSince writing the above we have found in the files of the Fayetteville Observer, on May 9, 1864, the report of Adjutant John W. Faison, and give the casualties accordingly:\n\nCompany AKilled: Lemuel Sawyer. Wounded: Sergeant Samuel S. Smith, Corporal Thomas G. Ferrell, William Garrett, Job C. Hughes (in breast), James H. Johnson, Henry Williams, William G. Gallop, and William Gilbert.\n\nCompany BWounded: 3rd Lt. Benjamin W. Thornton, mortally. Sergeant Leonidas H. Hurst, Warren Carver, John T. Moore, William Handy, and Richard H. Averett.\n\nCompany CWounded: Joel S. Sawyer, Basil A. Hackney, John Howard, Pleasant M. Pendergrass, Levi W. Williams, and John Parker.\n\nCompany D(Given above, 3 killed, 12 wounded).\n\nCompany EWounded: 2nd Lt. Jacob M. Jacobs, Sergeant Lemuel Harrell, Corporal William H. Turner, Hector M. McNeill, Hezekiah Wheeler, William H. Holland, William H. McBryde, William H. Turner, and Joseph Banks.\n\nCompany F1st Lt. Valentine J. Palmer, Corporal Anderson Nowlin, Allen C. Cogdale, Adney C. Cogdale, William Chitwood, Hosea M. Gladden, John G. Webb, J. W. Lindsay, Thomas P. Cabaniss, and Noah W. Ross.\n\nCompany GKilled: Thomas W. Noblin and Ozark D. Kimzey; wounded, Hewit Allen, Ellsberry Carlan, James B. Holinsworth, Landon M. Greer, Henry R. Perry, Leroy Smith, and Stephen Taylor.\n\nCompany HWounded: 1st Lt. Samuel R. Holton, Charles D. Donoho mortally, Thomas F. Barnwell, Noah C. Fox, Thomas Gately, James H. Miles, David Miller mortally, Bedford J. Page, William M. Thompson, David A. Thompson, and John Chisenhall.\n\nCompany IKilled: William J. Daves; wounded, Thomas R. Campbell, Samuel Green, Housand D. Harrill, J. P. Philbeck, Henry W. Price, and Riley H. Wall.\n\nCompany KWounded: John Strider, James P. Sossaman, and James W. Auten.\n\nIn the same issue is found the report of Capt. Sterling H. Gee, Assistant Adjutant and Inspector General, giving Brig. Gen. Matthew W. Ransom's total casualties in the three (3) days' operations, as follows:\n\nKILLED WOUNDED TOTAL Officers Men Officers Men 8th NC Regiment 2 18 5 102 127 24th NC Regiment 2 11 3 85 101 25th NC Regiment 0 3 0 20 23 35th NC Regiment 1 19 4 84 108 56th NC Regiment 0 4 4 80 88 Maj. Moseley's Artillery 0 0 0 17 17 Maj. Read's Artillery 0 2 1 9 12 5 57 17 397 476\n\nThe surrender, already noted, took place at 10:30 a.m. Several interesting, though partial, accounts of this affair were published in the Fayetteville Observer soon after the battle.\n\nApril 21st. Maj. John W. Graham, with Company I, 24th NC Regiment, Capt. Edwin A. Boykin; Company K, 25th NC Regiment, 1st Lt. Jesse M. Burlison; and Company D, 56th NC Regiment, Capt. Robert D. Graham, was placed in charge of Fort Gray on Warren's Neck.\n\nApril 22nd. Visited by the commanding Major General who found the post in much better order than we had.\n\nApril 25th. Detachment rejoined the brigade. At 10 a.m. the column set out for Washington, NC, leaving as a garrison at Plymouth Brig. Gen. James G. Martin's North Carolina Brigade, which has just joined us.\n\nApril 26th. Arrived in front of Washington, NC. Some shells thrown at us from the enemy's forts. The enemy withdrew during the night to concentrate at New Bern. Thus the second point in the campaign was scored in Maj. Gen. Robert F. Hoke's (NC) favor, this time without the loss of a man.\n\nApril 28thMay 2nd. At Greenville probably awaiting the arrival of the Confederate marines and pontoons from Richmond. Crossed the Tar River here and Contentnea Creek at Coward's Bridge, where we were joined by Col. John N. Whitford's 67th NC Regiment.\n\nMay 5th. We passed the Neuse River on a pontoon bridge, not far from where we left the Contentnea Creek. On nearing New Bern, Brig. Gen. William G. Lewis' (NC) Brigade made a dash upon the redoubts at Deep Gully; but the enemy fled to avoid capture. The main column then crossed the Trent River at Pollocksville, captured a Block House near a mill dam, and took position near the railroad bridge. Brig. Gen. James Dearing's (VA) cavalry and artillery moved to the south and captured the Block House on Brice's Creek that Brig. Gen. Seth M. Barton (AR) thought such a Gibraltar last February, and took fifty (50) prisoners. A section of Capt. Henry Dickson's North Carolina Battery [13th NC Battalion Light Infantry], from Orange County, under 1st Lt. Halcott P. Jones, supported by part of Brig. Gen. Nathan G. Evans' South Carolina Brigade, now under Brig. Gen. William S. \"Live Oak\" Walker (SC), moved to the front and engaged the enemy's railroad ironclad monitor. Brig. Gen. Matthew W. Ransom's (NC) Brigade was not far from the south bank of the Trent River.\n\nPreparations were made for putting in the river that night a pontoon bridge, first parallel with the stream, securing it to the bank at the lower end and swinging the other across with the current under the protection of our guns, to the New Bern side within the enemy's line of fortifications. The spirit of the troops assured success, and thus was to culminate our North Carolina campaign of 1864.\n\nPETERSBURG AND RICHMOND.\n\nMay 6th. The intended assault has been abandoned, and Federal Brig. Gen. Innis N. Palmer, U.S.A., is left in quiet possession of New Bern; for the morning finds us on a forced march for old Virginia again. Federal Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Butler is coming up the south side of the James River via Bermuda Hundreds, with 30,000 men to attack Petersburg. If possible, we must get there first. Maj. Gen. Robert F. Hoke (NC), in a recent letter, says: \"Your mention of what was intended at New Bern is correct and I had no doubt of its success. The recall was one of the greatest disappointments I ever had.\"\n\nMay 8th. Reach Kinston at 8 a.m. and via Goldsborough proceed to Weldon.\n\nMay 9th. Off for Petersburg by rail as far as Jarratt's Station. Here Brig. Gen. August V.Kautz's Federal cavalry have dashed in and cut the line of railway. March thence along the track to Stony Creek, about twenty (20) miles, that night. The weird hooting of the great owls in the swamps was almost human in its intonations and called forth comments, half in earnest and half in raillery, here and there along the line, such as: \"That is a bad sign, boys; hard times in old Virginia, and worse a'coming.\"\n\nMay 10th. At Stony Creek we take the trains that have come out to meet us, and are soon in Petersburg. Stack arms on Poplar Lawn. The generous hospitality of Judge Lyon, William R. Johnson, and other citizens is pleasantly remembered. Hear that the place has been held till our arrival by the single brigade of Brig. Gen. Johnson Hagood's South Carolinians. Lt. Gen. Daniel H. Hill (NC), too earnest to be long quiet, is occupying the anomalous position of volunteer Aide-de-Camp to General Pierre G.T. Beauregard (LA), commanding at Petersburg, pending a dispute with President Jefferson Davis as to an assignment proper to his rank. (This quarrel seems to have resulted in a failure to present his appointment to the CSA Congress for confirmation.) He was noted for a disposition \"to feel the enemy;\" and on such occasions his feelings were very rough. Our coup de main of July 2, 1863, at Crump's Farm below Richmond, he had just repeated here with more terrible odds, against Federal Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Butler's advancing column. With this handful of men, he had met him near Chester and made such a desperate assault as to put him on the defensive to await further developments. In the time thus gained reinforcements arrived, and we knew that with the Army of Northern Virginia we could successfully hold Richmond and Petersburg against all opposing forces then in the field. With Maj. Gen. Robert F. Hoke (NC), there were now Brig. Gen. Matthew W. Ransom's North Carolina, Brig. Gen. William G. Lewis' North Carolina, Brig. Gen. William S. Walker's (formerly Evans') South Carolina, Brig. Gen. Montgomery D. Corse's Virginia, and Brig. Gen. James L. Kemper's Virginia Brigades. This division took position a short distance beyond Swift Creek.\n\nMay 11th. Moved to Half-Way House. The enemy now appears in great force between us and Petersburg, occupying both the railroad and turnpike. We offer battle; but nothing follows beyond some sharp skirmishing. Brig. Gen. Matthew W. Ransom's (NC) Brigade forms the extreme Confederate left, near the river.\n\nBATTLE OF 12 MAY.\n\nMay 12th. This brigade is moved across the turnpike and posted near the winter quarters on rising ground to the right, facing Petersburg, forming now the right flank. In the afternoon, advanced down the railroad towards Petersburg, and occupied breastworks at a point near where the fortified line crosses this road. Here the line terminates after changing its general course and running off at almost a right angle (towards the river on the left near _____ house). Our artillery is engaged with that of the enemy in the woods to the front. A line of skirmishers is scarcely formed and thrown out to our right and rear for a reconnoissance under \"the fighting Quartermaster of the Forty-ninth,\" Capt. Cicero A. Durham, when they receive a volley from a line of battle in ambush, and this gallant leader and many of his brave comrades have fought their last fight. A rush is made by the enemy, and Maj. Gen. Hoke and Brig. Gen. Ransom, just arrived at the house for consultation, barely escape capture. On came the line as to an easy victory, but not as quick as was our command in leaping to the other side of the breastworks.\n\nAfter a sharp fight they were repulsed by the well-directed shots of a portion of the 56th NC Regiment holding the top of the steep bank of earth, while their comrades in the deep ditch below handed up their rifles as rapidly as they could be reloaded. There were here many instances of individual bravery, and it is a matter of regret that the State, at whose call these men offered their lives, has no fuller account of them. In Company B, Private Dixon P. Blizzard was killed, and the gallant 3rd Lt. Alexander R. Carver, then a Lieutenant and subsequently Captain, lost an arm. Private David R. McKee, of Company D, Orange County, is now remembered as among the conspicuous ones in the position which he occupied, and from which he fired sixteen (16) times with steady aim, and it is thought, with fatal effect, at such close quarters. When the exposed portion of the brigade, after resisting the assault upon it, had been withdrawn behind this effective fire, the 56th NC Regiment as rear guard, retired in perfect order. They had simply practiced the tactics of Forrest and checkmated a rear attack of the enemy. \"Face about and get in their rear,\" was his only order for a similar occasion. The perfect discipline of the command was evinced by there being no sign of a panic. Private Solomon Thomas Owens and Private George O. Griffin, of Company I, were also among those who displayed coolness and courage in this action, the former being severely wounded. From exposure he had lost his voice so that he could not speak above a whisper. The wound directly above his breast instantaneously cured his aphonia (laryngitis).\n\nBut the enemy is evidently in such force that we concentrate upon our second line of defenses. Each side watches for the initiative from the other. At night there is cheering along our lines, and the cause is that General Pierre G.T. Beauregard (LA) has just come in from Petersburg.\n\nSECOND DAY'S FIGHT.\n\nMay 13th. The writer saw General Beauregard on the field. Of medium size and military bearing, his most striking feature is his sharp bright eye, and a thoughtful, intelligent expression befitting his reputation as one of the best military engineers. Firing kept up through the day by the artillery and skirmishers.\n\nTHIRD DAY'S FIGHT.\n\nMay 14th. Brig. Gen. Matthew W. Ransom (NC) is severely wounded in the left arm by a minie hall and does not return to the brigade till the fall. Col. William J. Clarke, of the 24th NC Regiment, as senior Colonel, succeeds him. Battle at long range continued through the day.\n\nFOURTH DAY'S FIGHT.\n\nMay 15th. Yesterday's program continued, in which we again lose a brigade commander, Col. Clarke being wounded in the shoulder by the fragment of a shell. Col. Leroy M. McAfee, of the 49th NC Regiment, then assumes command. The 56th NC Regiment occupied a position on the line near the Washington Artillery, of New Orleans.\n\nWithout the means of corroboration, I here note that we hear that President Jefferson Davis, who has come down from Richmond, orders General Pierre G.T. Beauregard (LA) to make a general assault tomorrow, and that General Beauregard files a protest, in view of the terrible odds against his available forceat least 3 to 2, probably double thatand protected by breastworks.\n\nBATTLE OF DREWRY'S BLUFF.\n\nMay 16th. Soon after midnight the brigade is moved from the trenches, occupied for the last three (3) days, and formed in line of battle across the Petersburg Turnpike, facing towards Petersburg, with the left of the 56th NC Regiment resting on the turnpike. Up to this time it was thought we were going out to get a rest. This opinion, however, was dispelled by the issuing of an extra quantity of cartridges. But for the first time in our history, we start in on the reserve line. Just before dawn we move forward supporting Brig. Gen. Bushrod R. Johnson's Tennessee Brigade. They suffer severely near the turnpike, their advance being impeded by obstructions of telegraph wire upon which many of them are tripped within deadly range. But they gallantly carry the line in their front, while our 24th and 49th NC Regiments take the enemy's line of works in a piece of woods to their right. The assault is, as Mr. Davis had predicted, successful at every point; while Maj. Gen. Robert Ransom (NC), having come out from Richmond with three (3) Brigades, is sweeping down their left flank, and rear, capturing some regiments entire. Before Maj. Gen. Ransom reaches them, spasmodic efforts here and there are made to regain lost points along the line, from which we had dislodged them; but they are repulsed in each instance. They rush down the turnpike with their artillery nearly to our lines, just taken from them, and open fire; but their guns are soon in our hands, men and horses going down under the terrible fire with which they are met. It was not far from this point that the writer saw the President during this battle. He was probably nearer Federal Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Butler than he had been for four (4) years, as his courier whom we captured in the vicinity, said he was then very near the general. (At the National Democratic Convention of 1860, in Charleston, SC, Butler gave fifty-seven successive votes for Davis as his choice for President of the United States.)\n\nAnd now we waited anxiously for the attacks to be made on the right flank and rear of the enemy by Maj. Gen. William H.C. Whiting (VA) with the two or three (2-3) brigades in his hands on the Petersburg side. But in vain! This plan carried out with the courage for which the General had already made a reputation among the bravest and the best soldiers in the Army of Northern Virginia, should have resulted in the capture of all of Maj. Gen. Butler's artillery and wagons, (that he was safely withdrawing in our sight), and a good portion of his Army of the James. Lt. Gen. Daniel H. Hill was with Maj. Gen. Whiting, but without command. Both his prayers and imprecations to deliver the coup de grace were without avail. Is it an evil genius that thus hovers above the Confederate cross? For this is not the first time that it has been checked on the high tide to an effective victory by a voice that certainly came not out of the North, saying: \"Thus far shall thou go, and no farther.\"\n\nThe only casualty remembered in the regiment as of today is the mortally wounding of Private Green W. Bowers, of Company D, by a rifle ball which also went through an artillery horse near him on the front line.\n\nBUTLER BOTTLED UP.\n\nMay 17th. Though we have not captured Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Butler, we have \"bottled him up\" (as Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant reports it to President Abraham Lincoln), between the James and Appomattox rivers, and a much smaller force will be amply sufficient to hold our shorter line across the narrow neck from bend to bend of the here converging rivers, which lower down diverge considerably before uniting, thus suggesting Lt. Gen. Grant's figure. Our line extends from near Bermuda Hundreds on the former to a point in the vicinity of the Confederate Fort Clifton on the latter. Lt. Gen. Daniel H. Hill (NC) urges another assault.\n\nMay 18th. With a picket line advanced, we throw up a counter line of works, receiving a shelling from Maj. Gen. Butler's gunboats.\n\nMay 19th. Company D is out in front, some 500 yards to the right of the Howlett House, rectifying the line of rifle pits to conform to the possible line of attack and defense. Consultation with Brig. Gen. William G. Lewis (NC), recently promoted from Lieutenant Colonel to Brigadier General, and well known as an engineer of ability, who appears on the line.\n\nBATTLE OF WARE BOTTOM CHURCH, OR CLAY'S FARM.\n\nMay 20th. Companies B and H, Capt. Franklin N. Roberts and Capt. William G. Graves, relieve Company D, which joins the regiment. About 2 p.m., General Pierre G.T. Beauregard (LA) makes a general assault from right to left on Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Butler's line, and drives it in three-quarters of a mile on the right, and something less on the left. Our troops on this part of the line were put in too spasmodically, in unsupported detachments, allowing the enemy to reinforce from point to point as successively threatened, or to make a counter-charge and flank movement with fresh troops against ours before they could recover from the disorder incident to a headlong rush into the contested positions. The fight upon the part of the 56th NC Regiment ended with the enemy's picket line, from which we had driven their advanced line of battle, in our possession. The loss to the 56th NC Regiment was 90 killed and wounded in less than half as many minutes, Lt. Col. Granville G. Luke being one of the wounded.\n\nIn Company D, as follows: Washington Blackwood, Jesse Clark, John Clark, James Hicks, Elzy Riley, James Roberts, William N. Sims, and Corporal James Erwin Laycock; also James M. Clark, Ensign, and Jesse Brown and William E. Faucett, all wounded. Jesse Brown, like Corporal Hughes at Plymouth, had his twisted blanket pierced a dozen times by a minie ball which burnt his arm without breaking the bone, and he will return to duty in a few days. The Captain of Company D promoted Solon E. Burkhead from Private to 1st Sergeant for conspicuous bravery in this battle, known as the battle of Ware Bottom Church, or Clay's Farm. Among the wounded in Company H was 2nd Lt. Robert W. Belo, who lost a foot. Company I lost some of its best men: Sergeant Amos Harrill (brother of the Captain), Corporal William C. L. Beam, George O. Griffin and the brothers, Jackson and Joseph Tessenear, all killed, and twelve (12) men wounded. Company A here lost a great favorite in the wounding and capturing of the brave Isaac G. Gallop, who later died in captivity.\n\nMay 21st. Busy strengthening the new line, and May 22nd, 3rd Lt. Charles R. Wilson and others rejoined the company, having been wounded at Plymouth.\n\nMay 23rd, Flag of truce to bury the dead on the contested ground between the two lines. A ghastly sight. Some are not recovered, as they fell within the enemy's lines, three (3) days agoa sad uncertainty around some hearthstones until peace on earth shall return again. Information is obtained of the gallant Brig. Gen. William S. \"Live Oak\" Walker, whom we met on the field just to our right, May 20th, in command of Brig. Gen. Evans' (SC) Brigade, Colonel Elliott now commanding. The enemy report him doing well after the amputation of his leg.\n\nSome of the casualties of the last week's operations were:\n\nCompany BKilled: Dixon P. Blizzard; wounded. 3rd Lt. Alexander R. Carver, and John Tart.\n\nCompany CWounded: Corporal James A. Matthews and William Childress.\n\nCompany ESergeant Isaac N. Clark and Benjamin J. Garner; wounded, Benjamin F. Sykes.\n\nCompany FWounded: 3rd Lt. Alfred R. Grigg, William C. Wolf, Michael W. Crowder.\n\nCompany GKilled: James J. Tucker; wounded, Robert P. Smith and Robert C. Love.\n\nCompany HWounded: Sergeant Thomas F. Montague, Corporal Norfleet A. Horn, David May, James O. Scoggins, Sergeant Sidney A. Thompson (POW), Corporal Hiram C. Murchison (POW), William F. Lackey, Hawkins Bledsoe (POW), Joseph Bolin (POW), George W. Bogle (POW), Silas L. Carden, John T. Lee (POW), Franklin C. Patterson (POW), Thomas J. Peed (missing, probably killed), John M. Stewart (POW), Jesse H. Vickers (POW), William S. Whitaker, Gaston Roberts, William T. Patterson (POW). Missing: Newton P. Combs (POW), John L. Cazorte (POW), and James S. Massey (killed).\n\nCompany IWounded: Sergeant Columbus P. Tanner, George W. Spurlin, David P. Smart, James M. Michael, John W. Canipe, and George J. Horton.\n\nCompany KWounded: Sergeant James J. McNeely, George W. Edwards, Zachariah H. Morgan, and Alex C. Shields.\n\nMay 25th. In the romantic intimacy that has sprung up between the pickets of the two (2) opposing armies, a soldier in the 25th NC Regiment lends his pick to a Yankee to dig his rifle pit, a new one being made necessary by our last move upon them; and the blue coat returns it after completing the job.\n\nMay 31st. Maj. Gen. Robert F. Hoke (NC), with his di"
