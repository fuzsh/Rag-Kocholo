        "text": "The First Continental Congress met in September 1774, in the Hall of Carpenters’ Company, Philadelphia. A Committee of Correspondence was elected by the citizens of Philadelphia to determine the most effective means of resisting the British and to carry out the nonimportation resolutions of the Congress. The Committee first met on the afternoon of Thursday, November 17, 1774, in the Pennsylvania State House. That evening three of the members, together with twenty-five other gentlemen, gathered according to tradition in Carpenters’ Hall and associated as the Light Horse of the City of Philadelphia, a name that was later changed to First Troop Philadelphia City Cavalry.\n\nThis purely volunteer cavalry troop was the first organized in defense of the colonies. Today the Troop is certainly the oldest mounted military unit and quite possibly the oldest military unit of any kind that has been in continuous service to the Republic. The times that called it into being, and the character of the original members who fought through the seven years of the American Revolution, together forged concepts of service and a body of tradition that have given it a continuity of purpose for 230 years.\n\nThe gentlemen of the Philadelphia Light Horse were professional men, shipowners, importers, or traders, generally of conspicuous prominence in the affairs of the day. The membership was not to confine itself to public or civil life, for many were to hold commissions in the Continental service and in the Army and Navy of the State. The Rolls of the Troop ever since have been enriched by outstanding individual records in all branches of military life.\n\nA number of social organizations played an important part in forming the new cavalry unit. The oldest of these was the Schuylkill Fishing Company, a club that numbered many Troopers among its officers. Other organizations from which the Light Horse drew its members were the Schuylkill Company of Fort St. Davids, the St. Andrew’s Society of Philadelphia, the Society of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick, and the Society of the Sons of St. George. The Gloucester Fox Hunting Club had especial influence. The “round black hat bound with silver cord and buck’s tail” and the dark brown short coat faced and lined with white worn by the Trooper of the Revolution were similar to the hunting coat and cap in which its club members rode to hounds. Captain Samuel Morris was Gloucester’s first president and Captain Robert Wharton its last, and twenty-five Troopers were among its members during the War.\n\nThe associates who met on the evening of November 17, 1774, voted to equip and support themselves at their own expense and to offer their services to the Continental Congress. The company prepared for active duty by holding drills at five in the morning and five in the afternoon several times a week.\n\nAbraham Markoe, a Danish subject, was chosen to be the first Captain because of his energy in organizing the Troop and his previous Danish military experience. Though prevented from open participation in the War as a result of the Neutrality Edict issued by then King Christian II of Denmark, Captain Markoe took an active part in the defeat of the enemy by all other available means.\n\nAt the time there was no common flag in use by any of the colonies. Not long after the news of the Battle of Lexington reached Philadelphia, Captain Markoe presented the Troop with the Standard that was to be carried in the battles of Trenton, Princeton, Brandywine, and Germantown, and on all parades until about 1830, when it was retired for safekeeping.\n\nWhen George Washington was appointed Commander in Chief of the Continental Army in June of 1775, the Troop assumed varied duties. Close personal contact with the General developed as he was escorted to distant points in the Colonies. The command was frequently called upon to provide detachments to accompany prisoners and spies, to bear dispatches for the Committee of Safety, and to march with money for delivery to the Army.\n\nThe drift of political affairs in 1861 made it evident that the Troop might be called into active service. When the call for volunteers was made by the federal government on April 15th 1861, the Troop at once tendered its services. As a unit, First City Troop was the only volunteer cavalry organization accepted under President Lincoln’s first ninety-day call up of state militia units. Ultimately, First City Troop played an integral part in the Civil War, both as a Pennsylvania militia unit and by the actions of individual First City Troopers serving with other units. The impact of their involvement was deep and far-reaching.\n\nIn accordance with time-honored custom, Divine Service was attended at St. Peter’s Church on the Sunday preceding departure for active duty and on May 13th, 1861, the Troop was mustered into service for ninety days. Each man was equipped at his own expense with the uniform of the United States Dragoons. The War Department agreed to supply arms, horse furniture and camp equipage, but horses and many other necessities were unavailable from Washington. To meet these needs, $4,050 was contributed by members and friends of the unit.\n\nThe unit left on May 30th to join the 2nd U.S. Cavalry at Carlisle. and by June 7th it had reached Williamsport on the Potomac. The Troop led the main body across the river to Falling Water, VA. On reconnaisance the following day, the Troop encountered a small body of mounted Confederates who retreated without offering resistance. After a day of uneventful maneuvering, the Troop was again near Falling Water, when skirmishers on the front and right flank became engaged with the enemy. The forces of the Confederacy on that field were infantry commanded by Colonel “Stonewall” Jackson and cavalry commanded by Colonel J.E.B. Stuart. On the Union side the First Wisconsin, Eleventh Pennsylvania Rangers, McMullin’s Rangers, Perkins’ Battery and the First City Troop were brought to bear.\n\nAs the battle was joined, the Troop was hurried to the top of a hill in support of one section of Perkins’ Battery. There a brisk fire was opened upon the enemy. Although the encounter was brief and losses not heavy on either side, it was the first engagement of the Civil War in which troops had been used in any numbers in a systematic manner. Colonel J.J. Abercrombie, the brigade commander, wrote: “Captain Hudson’s second Light Battery and the City Troop under Captain (Thomas C.) James aided materially in driving the enemy from the field.”\n\nFollowing this first battle, the Troop saw duty at Bunker Hill, Charlestown, Harper’s Ferry, Key’s Ferry and Sandy Hook, Maryland, as well as keeping pickets on the south side of the Potomac. Upon the expiration of its three month’s service the organization was ordered home. It was complimented in orders by its Commanding General and Colonel George H. Thomas, who commanded the Brigade, as well as by General Robert Patterson. In retrospect, as a “school for cavalry officers,” the Battle of Falling Water was invaluable. As the war increased in scope and ferocity, many additional cavalry units would be formed for federal service. Ultimately, forty-nine members of the Active Roll of April 15, 1861, as well as eight members of the Honorary and Non-Active Rolls, would serve as officers in these new federal units.\n\nAfter federal service was complete, the Troop returned to Philadelphia and mustered out on August 17th, 1861. Many members of the Troop subsequently volunteered to join the Union Army. Concurrently, the Troop recruited new members to fill the vacancies of those marching off to battle in federal ranks. The Troop – as a unit – would continue its traditions and its service to the Commonwealth throughout the war.\n\nIn early May of 1862 the Troop offered its services to protect the City of Washington which again appeared to be in peril. Before the Troop’s offer could be accepted, however, the Confederate forces fell back. The subsequent disasterous campaign of the Virginia Peninsula caused alarm in the North and the Troop met daily to recruit and to train new members. In September, when the Confederate Army had crossed the Potomac and encamped at Frederick, the Troop planned to organize a cavalry regiment which would by officered by its current members. A large storeroom was rented as a recruiting station, and five hundred men were promptly enlisted. The project had to be abandoned however, because at this stage in the war, horses and other requisite equipment were unavailable from the state and difficult to procure in such numbers on the civilian economy.\n\nOn April 4th, 1863, The Governor of Pennsylvania signed the Act of Incorporation of the First Troop Philadelphia Cavalry, which had previously been approved by the State Legislature.\n\nOn June 15th, 1863, following the advance of the Confederate Army into the Cumberland Valley, President Lincoln called out 50,000 militia. At this stage, most members of First Troop Philadelphia City Cavalry were serving with other federal units or had already become casualties of the war. The thirty one remaining members organized under Cornet Samuel J. Randall, furnished themselves with horses and equipment, and rode for Harrisburg, arriving there on June 19th. They were immediately accepted into service without swearing in and ordered to Gettysburg. At 4:00 AM on the 21st of June, the Troop was the first military unit to arrive on the scene of what was about to become the pivotal battle of the Cival War. The residents of Gettysburg, relieved to see Union soldiers, were extremely generous to the Troop, then and throughout the campaign. Given the paucity of the Troop’s commissary supplies, this generousity was greatly appreciated and long remembered.\n\nAt Gerrysburg, Cornet Randall reported to Major Granville O. Haller. In that no one was certain where General Lee and his vast force might be, Cornet Randall was immediately ordered to take a detail of ten men to reconnoiter the Chambersburg Turnpike toward Cashtown. There they captured two Confederate soldiers who were sent to the rear under the escort of three Troopers. The reconnaissance established the presence of Jenkins’ Brigade of Stuart’s Cavalry Corps, operating between Williamsport and Chambersburg, which was military intelligence of significant import at this preliminary stage of the battle.\n\nThe same afternoon, in response to rumors of a force approaching Fairfield, the remainder of the Troop was ordered out to reconnoiter, accompanied by Major Haller and Captain Bell with an additional squad of cavalry which had arrived. Just east of Fairfield they observed about one hundred and sixty Confederate mounted infantry scouting the countryside for forage and remounts. The main Confederate body was stationed on the outsikirts of the town while detachments were sent out in various directions. Major Haller left Captain Bell and his cavalry squad in place and cautiously led the First City Troopers to within a half mile of the town. From that point he ordered a charge that swept through the town, driving the enemy back to a nearby mountain pass.\n\nFor the next few days the Troop was employed on patrols covering roads leading in the direction of the enemy. Split into three detachments on June 25th, the Troop continued to live in the saddle, observing and reporting on the enemy’s movements. Shots were frequently exchanged on these missions as Troopers swung close to ememy formations or galloped in even closer in quest of prisoners needed for intelligence purposes.\n\nIn one instance, operating together on a mission to York, the entire Troop was nearly enveloped, narrowly escaping capture by riding long and hard. The Troop reached York so covered with mud and grime as to be unrecognizable as either Union or Confederate. From York the Troop moved to Wrightsville and from there across the Susquehanna to Columbia, where it spent the night. The next day it recrossed to observe the enemy advancing in force under General John B. Gordon. A formation of recently raised militia infantry, operating in that area, was engaged by Gordon’s force. Many of the Union militia were quickly enveloped and captured by the battle-hardened Confederate regulars. The Troop’s efforts were essential in preserving order among the many others who were near panic, particularly as the last of these companies approached the bridge over the Susquehanna with Gordon’s infantry hot on their heels. The military authorities on the scene determined to destroy the bridge which, with it’s twenty-one spans across the Susquehanna, was more than a mile long. Four Troopers detailed under the supervision of Major Knox of the 9th New York CIty Cavalry set to work setting fire to the bridge at sundown of June 28th. This heroic task took place under the guns of the Confederate soldiers. When the Confederates drove the Troopers from the bridge and attempted to extinguish the fires it was too late. The bridge was fully engulfed by the flames and, by midnight, the destruction was complete. General Gordon, writing years later, stated that the destruction of that single bridge at that moment in the battle eliminated any possibility of a march on Philadelphia.\n\nA scouting party of twenty-one men crossed the Susquehanna on July 2nd in flat boats and proceeded toward York. Betrayed by an informer, the unit was forced to break off its march and take up defensive positions in a cemetary near Heidelburg. The men slept with sentries posted at the extremeties of a short crossroads, their horses tethered nearby, saddled and ready. In the early evening a thunder of hooves was heard on the main road from Harrisburg to Gettysburg and on a parallel road that branches off from York Springs and runs to Hunterstown. About 6,000 of J.E.B. Stuart’s cavalry were observed traversing these roads far into the night. During their passage they completely surrounded the cemetary but never discovered the squad. Sergeant Robert E. Randall hovered with this small command on the outskirts of the ensuing battle at Rommel’s Farm, taking a number of stragglers and sixty horses.\n\nThe detachement rejoined the Troop on July 6th near Harrisburg. On July 15th the entire Troop was ordered to Philadelphia, where a riot was threatened, opposing the draft newly ordered by President Lincoln. The Troop was discharged on July 31, after remaining on duty during the draft.\n\nAlthough the Troop did not participate directly in any of the grinding and colossal battles which changed the course of the Civil War, history duly notes that the efforts of the First City Troop and Bell’s Cavalry alerted the Union forces to the presence and intentions of the Confederate formations, providing Union General Meade the insight he needed to correctly move and position his forces in the critical hours leading up to the historic engagement. In addition, historians agree that the various cavalry skirmishes which involved the Troop in the eastern gorges delayed the Confederate movement in force across South Mountain. In fact, so well did these “irregular” forces meet the enemy advance, Confederate leaders believed they were already confronting the battle tested forward security elements of the Army of the Potomac. This gave Federal troops much needed time to move into the Gettysburg area. The difference of a single day could have changed the outcome of the campaign in the Confederate’s favor.\n\nFirst City Troop received the prestigious honor of escorting President Lincoln in June of 1864 on his visit to Philadelphia, but less than one year later an assassin’s bullet compelled the grief-stricken Troopers to don their uniforms for their President again, this time as escort and honor guard for the funeral procession of the slain Commander-in-Chief.\n\nMany First City Troopers performed admirably throughout the war in Federal service, providing outstanding examples of sacrifice and duty. Captain James, commander of First City Troop during the first ninety-day call-up, later commanded the 9th Pennsylvania Cavalry Regiment and was considered to be among the best of the Union cavalry commanders. Lieutenant Price, another First City Troop officer, recruited the 2nd Pennsylvania Cavalry and became their Lieutenant Colonel, and much of the officer corps of the 6th Pennsylvania Cavalry (Lancers) was comprised of First City Troopers.\n\nThe men of First City Troop acquitted themselves with honor, skill and courage throughout the Civil War and provided the country a shining example of the role of the citizen-soldier during one of the darkest periods in United States history.\n\nAt the October meeting of the Troop in 1865, Generals Grant, Meade, Sheridan, Thomas, Torbert and Crawford, as well as Admirals Farragut and Porter were elected to the Honorary Roll of the First Troop Philadelphia City Cavalry. Generals Meade and Torbert were present as guests of the Troop at the Anniversary Dinner on November 17th, along with Generals Patterson and Cadwalader.\n\nIn 1867, the Militia Act of 1864 was amended and this secured for the Troop its “original vested rights, priveleges and immunities.” During these years the unit was reorganized with the strong backing of Generals Patterson, Meade and Cadwalader and the many members who had served as officers under other guidons during the War Between the States returned to the ranks of the Troop."
