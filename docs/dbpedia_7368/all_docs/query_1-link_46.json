        "text": "Brevet Brigadier-General James Shaw, Jr., U.S.V.\n\nBrevet Brigadier-General James Shaw, Jr., son of General James and Eliza Field (Godfrey) Shaw, was born in Providence, Rhode Island, September 25, 1830. His father commanded the First Light Infantry from 1830 to 1835, and ordered the firing on the mob in 1831,-the first instance in the country where a mob had been suppressed by the militia; was active on the side of \" law and order\" during the \" Dorr War,\" and was afterwards commander of the First Brigade Rhode Island Militia.\n\nGeneral James Shaw, Jr., was educated in the public schools of Providence, graduating from the High School in 1846. He was an active member of the First Light Infantry from 1850 to 1857. At the commencement of the Rebellion, being unable to go with the First Regiment, he suggested to the citizens of the Sixth Ward the formation of ward companies for the purpose of learning to drill. He was made first lieutenant and then captain of the Sixth Ward Guards. This example was followed by every ward in the city and every town in the State.\n\nOwing to Captain Shaw's exertions a regiment was formed from these companies, and he was elected colonel. In the spring of 1862 the following despatch was received from the Secretary of War: \" Enemy advancing on Washington; send every available man immediately,\" and Colonel Shaw was called on by the governor to organize the Tenth Rhode Island Volunteers. In thirty hours after the call a regiment was formed, armed, clothed, equipped, and en rorctc for Washington. Waiving the right to the command, Colonel Shaw asked for one who had received a military education for colonel, and took the lieutenant-colonelcy May 26, 1862; was promoted to colonel August 6 of the same year, and served in the defences of Washington. At the end of three months the command was mustered out. He re-entered the service December 31, 1862, as lieutenant-colonel of the Twelfth Rhode Island Volunteers, and served with the Ninth Army Corps before Fredericksburg, Newport News, and in Kentucky.\n\nWhen the Twelfth Regiment was mustered out he appeared before \"Casey's Board,\" and was the fifth out of seven hundred examined to receive the grade of colonel, and was appointed October 27, 1863, to the command of the Seventh United States Colored Troops. He joined the regiment November 12, 1863, in Maryland; was post commander at Jacksonville, Florida; commanded brigade in the expedition to Cedar Creek and Camp Melton; participated in the battle on John's Island; was commended for wisdom and bravery in action; returned to Virginia and moved on Richmond; he commanded First Brigade, Third Division, Tenth Army Corps, August 13 to 21, August 25 to September 25, and October 25 to December 4, 1864. Commanded First Brigade, Second Division, Twenty-fifth Army Corps, from its formation, December 4, 1864, until it was disbanded in 1866. Commanded Second Division, Twenty-fifth Army Corps, February 21 to March 13, 1865, and participated in the capture of Petersburg and the triumph at Appomattox. He commanded the sub-district of Victoria and Central District of Texas from February 21 to May 9, 1866, and was mustered out with his regiment November 16, 1866, bearing on his flag, by authority, the names of the battles of Cedar Creek, Baldwin, Kingsland Road, Fuzzel's Mills, White Point, John's Island, Fort Gilmer, Darbytown Road, Armstrong's Mills, Petersburg, and Appomattox Court House.\n\nGeneral Shaw married, September 22, 1853, Elizabeth Williams, daughter of James and Amanda (Potter) Fisher, of Pawtuxet, Rhode Island. They have had three children,-James, Walter Arnold (died May 3, 1873), and Howard Armington.\n\nSource: Officers of the Volunteer Army and Navy who served in the Civil War, published by L.R.
