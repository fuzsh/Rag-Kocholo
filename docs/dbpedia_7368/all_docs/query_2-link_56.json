Accepting that the term staff ride represents a process of going to the actual location where actions took place and critical decisions were made, all under the stress of combat and with incomplete or plain wrong information, it follows that to conduct an effective staff ride demands careful planning and preparation beforehand.\n\nTo that end, this staff ride handbook is organized into clearly laid-out, highly functional components.\n\nThese are part one, The Opposing Forces; part two, Southern Campaign Overview; and part three, Field Study Phase. This third phase bears special mention because it serves as a blueprint to set up the staff ride via a series of some 14 “stands” or stops, each oriented to a particular piece of terrain or vital campaign or battle stage. Parts four, Integration, and five, Support, provide a clear, cogent, and eminently workable plan for a high-value assessment of Guilford Courthouse.\n\nIf a campaign is reckoned a series of operations aimed at some specific outcome and conducted in a given expanse of space and time, then Skinner comes rightly to the vital architecture of this one: the major decisions of the two opposing commanders—Lieutenant General Lord Charles Cornwallis for the British and Major General Nathanael Greene for the Americans—and the interactions in combat of their contending armies. His approach brings us straight to the central purpose and greatest value of the staff ride, one not to be gained in any other way. Rather than being merely a review or catalog of decisions, at each of the aforementioned (in part three) stands, the author asks staff ride participants the classical questions: 1) Can you discern, at this particular stand or stage of the contest, that a decision was made (or if no decision was made, that in itself—the “no decision”\n\n—becoming functionally the decision)? 2) What exactly was the decision that was made? 3) Who made it? 4) Was it reasonable based on the information available at that time (as opposed perhaps to what is known today, after the fact)? 5) To whom was it communicated? 6) What effect did the decision have on the outcome of the event?\n\n1 Earl Cornwallis to Sir Henry Clinton, Charlestown, 6 August 1780, in Charles Derek Ross, ed., Correspondence of Charles, First Marquis Cornwallis, vol. 1\n\n(London: John Murray, 1859), 54.\n\n2 Russell F. Weigley, The Partisan War: The South Carolina Campaign of 1780–1782 (Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 1970), 52.\n\n3 Earl Cornwallis to Sir Henry Clinton, Williamsburg, 30 June 1781, in Ross, Correspondence of Charles, First Marquis Cornwallis, 102.\n\nXI\n\nIn all this, Skinner sees the discernable beginning and ending points of the campaign as 18\n\nJanuary and 15 March 1781. That is, 18 January marks the aftermath of the British defeat at the Cowpens battle in South Carolina and Cornwallis’s decision, in near fury, to mount a hell-for-leather in-all-weather pursuit of Greene’s army as it sought to escape by falling back across North Carolina.\n\nIn this so-called Race to the Dan, Cornwallis failed to trap and destroy Greene, although he destroyed wagons and precious food and rations in an effort to lighten the load and so speed up his army’s rate of march. The Americans were instead able to escape to safety on the far side of the Dan River—\n\nfrom which point they might return to fight on some future day of their own choosing.\n\nThat is precisely what happened. The second date, 15 March, marks what proved to be the end-point of the campaign: the concluding, three-hour battle at Guilford Courthouse, where Cornwallis claimed victory—but lost one-quarter of his redcoats to death or injury. When this news crossed the Atlantic to Britain, it spurred no end of rebuke from opponents of the war against the Americans.\n\nCharles James Fox, for example, leader of the Whig opposition to King George III’s Tory ministry, argued that another such “victory” might leave the British in America with no army at all. All the fruitless marching back and forth had failed to conquer Greene, and Guilford Courthouse—far from the victorious battle Cornwallis claimed—was instead something “very nearly allied to decisive defeat.”4\n\nBut the real situation for the British was now worse or about to prove even more so than the sar-casm could represent. The campaign and battle marked a turning point in the contest for the South.\n\nFollowing the loss of their only army in the South at Charleston in May 1780 (arguably Britain’s single biggest victory of the war), and the routing of a second army at Camden three months later, American fortunes were now changing. After nearly a year of these severe reversals, they were swinging over to the initiative and a series of successes. In the run-up to Guilford Courthouse, for example, South Carolina militia and Continental dragoons under Lieutenant Colonel Henry “Light-Horse Harry” Lee, Robert E. Lee’s father, managed to lure into ambush a sizable force of North Carolina Loyalists trying to join Cornwallis. The near annihilation of that force continued a process started at Kings Mountain the previous October, with its loss of a substantial number of the Loyalists available to the British in South Carolina. The message was clear: any Loyalists taking the field on the side of the redcoats would be joining a losing side, and they would pay the price. No further sizable body of Loyalists came forward.\n\nAnd at this point the Americans became—unlike the 1780 pitched battles whereby both sides planned the encounter on a prearranged battleground—winners of a conventional pitched battle in which they were losers only in Cornwallis’s dispatches. His push into North Carolina and heavy losses in battle broke the back of British efforts to bring the two Carolinas back under crown authority\n\n—a goal of London’s policy from the start.\n\nIt was at this juncture that Cornwallis chose to turn the vector of British effort in the South away from his assigned task of protecting Charleston and the gains made since the previous May toward a new direction: north to Virginia. To be sure, British amphibious raids already sought to cut American lines of communications in Governor Thomas Jefferson’s state, and certainly Cornwallis’s initial foray netted successes, including destruction of much of the tobacco crop and capture of some number of the state’s legislature. But when Cornwallis turned north, Greene turned south—and to a campaign that would roll up the British and Loyalist positions in the Carolinas and Georgia one by one and eventually regain the great prize: Charleston.\n\nBut the British were by now on the road to defeat at Yorktown, Virginia, the result of a strategic 4 See in particular Cornwallis’s comments dated 12 June 1781, “State of the War in America,” in Parliamentary Register or History of the Proceedings and Debates of the Second Session of the House of Commons, Fifteenth Parliament of Great Britain (London: J. Debrett, 1782), 378. See also John W. Gordon, “Guilford Courthouse,” in South Carolina and the American Revolution: A Battlefield History (Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 2003), 144–48; and John Ferling, Almost a Miracle: The American Victory in the War of Independence (New York: Oxford University Press, 2007), 494–500.\n\nXII\n\ntoxic cocktail set before them by French seapower and the French and American armies acting together, as well as strategic and command discord in their own ranks. For the Franco-American allies, French admiral François-Joseph-Paul, comte de Grasse, was key, bringing his fleet from Europe via the Caribbean and up to the Virginia coast, so preventing the Royal Navy from being able to break through and rescue Cornwallis’s army in its fortifications. Lieutenant General George Washington, commander in chief of the Continental Army, and Lieutenant General Jean-Baptiste-Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau, feinted an attack on New York and then moved with dispatch south to lay siege to Cornwallis. French siege artillery pounded Cornwallis’s positions. All of this occurred before British help could arrive. Cornwallis’s Virginia invasion was a disaster. At Yorktown, on 19 October 1781, Cornwallis surrendered, amounting to the loss of a second British army in the field, this one coming very nearly four years to the day after General John Burgoyne’s surrender at Saratoga, New York, on 17 October 1777 and effectively closing out major fighting in North America.\n\nStaff ride participants will want to consider carefully the British command relationships at play, with overall policy and strategy for the American war being set at the ministerial level in London by Lord George Germain and overseen in America by the commander in chief in North America, Lieutenant General Sir Henry Clinton. Clinton and Cornwallis both had proven combat records, and both had seen considerable service in America.\n\nClinton is alternatively argued to be the most insightful British general to fight the Americans or one of the least energetic; Cornwallis is argued to be other than insightful or by far the most aggressive and energetic of the British generals to fight the Americans.5 It is worth remembering that the war in America was not to be Cornwallis’s last and that he would go on to defeat the French-backed United Irishmen’s revolt in 1798, a significant threat to Britain in its home islands, and that he would die on active service in India, but only after he had greatly advanced Britain’s fortunes in the subcontinent.\n\nAnd the contest in the South was also a competition between two British strategic approaches. One, Clinton’s, argued that it was a revolutionary war that demanded the perhaps more-revolutionary (by eighteenth-century standards, at least) approach of holding enclaves and securing them by creating a Loyalist militia. Some of the Loyalists could also be formed into provincial units and brigaded with the redcoats, thus providing additional maneuver forces.6\n\nCornwallis, on the other hand, judged that the only target that mattered was the Americans’\n\nfielded forces and that these must be defeated by the most direct and decisive means available. He saw occupying Virginia as essential to this process, as it would force the Americans to come out and meet the British in decisive battle or face having the southern colonies cut off from the rest of “the States.”7\n\nThe process of analyzing how and why all this played out as it did is the vital goal of any staff ride. Focused on a critical eight-week period in the sixth year of the American Revolution, Skinner’s A Game of Hare & Hounds: An Operational-level Command Study of the Guilford Courthouse Campaign, 18 January–15 March 1781, makes such analysis a rewarding task.\n\nJohn W.

Colossians 3:23.\n\nXV\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nDuring the afternoon of 15 March 1781, two armies—one comprising British and German regulars, the second a collection of American Continental Army regulars, state troops, and militia—fought the pivotal Battle of Guilford Courthouse. On the surface, the battle was a remarkable tactical victory for the British. When viewed within the context of the British strategy in the Southern Campaign, the outcome of the Guilford Courthouse battle was a victory devoid of strategic benefit. Lieutenant General Lord Charles Cornwallis’s army was rendered incapable of consolidating any gains, and without the security presence of British regulars, Loyal Americans (also known as Loyalists or Tories) were not willing to risk their lives and property in service to the crown.\n\nCornwallis subsequently abandoned North Carolina, thereby ending the crown’s last realistic attempt to gain and retain American territory sufficient to serve as leverage when the time came for peace negotiations. Conversely, Major General Nathanael Greene displayed an impressive grasp of linking operational design to strategy, which, as a consequence, gave the Americans ultimate control of the Carolinas—despite his dismal tactical record while in command of the Southern Department, the Continental Army’s organizing unit for regiments of Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia. The study and analysis of the Guilford Courthouse battle can and should reveal insights at the three levels of war: strategic, operational, and tactical.\n\nThe importance of the Guilford Courthouse battle is best understood by briefly reviewing the state of the British Southern Campaign in June 1780. Orchestrated by Lieutenant General Sir Henry Clinton, commander in chief of the British forces in America, expeditions during the winter of 1779–80 had won a series of impressive victories, taking Savannah, Augusta, and much of the Savannah River valley between South Carolina and Georgia. Clinton scored one of the largest British victories in the entire war when a joint army-navy expedition captured the major port city of Charleston, along with its Continental garrison of approximately 3,300 troops, in May 1780.\n\nCaptured Patriot militia were paroled and sent home, and at first, pacification efforts seemed to go well, with British officers and cadre hard at work organizing Loyalist militias to secure vital logistics points. From that apparent point of complete dominance, British fortunes in the South rapidly deteriorated. British arrogance and ineptitude in the treatment of rebel sympathizers and undecided\n\n“fence-sitters” drove many paroled Patriot fighters back into active resistance. Small Patriot partisan bands, mostly under the direction of Francis Marion (the “Swamp Fox”) and Thomas Sumter (the\n\n“Gamecock”) attacked isolated British outposts and ambushed Loyalist detachments. Most skirmishes were won by the Patriots, and by late summer the rebels had gained a marked moral advantage over their Tory enemies.\n\nConcerned with the deteriorating security situation, Cornwallis tried a risky expedient, sending a corps of the best Loyalist militia regiments, led by Scottish regular Major Patrick Ferguson, into the rebel sanctuary areas along the Blue Ridge Mountains. Aroused by the threat to their settlements, Patriot militia regiments formed a punitive expedition that annihilated Ferguson’s militia corps at Kings Mountain on 15 October 1780.\n\nThe stunning Patriot victory at Kings Mountain not only reversed the string of tactical successes by the British, but “spirit[ed] up the people” opposing the British occupation.1 Bereft of his best militia regiments, Cornwallis suspended his offensive drive into North Carolina to return his regular units to pacification duties back in South Carolina. Greater trouble for Cornwallis came when Major 1 Gen Nathanael Greene letter to Col Daniel Morgan, “The Detached Command Formed Which Won Cowpens,” 16 December 1780, in Theodorus B. Myers, Cowpens Papers, Being Correspondence of General Morgan and the Prominent Actors (Charleston, SC: News and Courier Book Press, 1881), 9, hereafter Greene to Morgan, 16 December 1780.\n\nXVI\n\nGeneral Greene took command of the threadbare Southern Department in late 1780. Selected by General George Washington to replace the incompetent Major General Horatio Gates after his defeat at the Battle of Camden, Greene proved an inspired choice for command, as he was not only a competent logistician, but a gifted strategist. After gaining situational awareness and understanding of the southern theater, Greene implemented a Fabian strategy, designed to minimize his weaknesses while neutralizing Cornwallis’s greater combat strength.2 First, Greene adopted a delaying strategy to preserve his precious Continental units, attacking only isolated British detachments and avoiding decisive battle with Cornwallis’s superb regular units. Although Greene struggled at times in his relationships with local Patriot militia leaders, particularly with Thomas Sumter, Greene was able to employ Whig partisans to harass British forward bases and lines of communication. By adopting an indirect operational approach, Greene expected to weaken Cornwallis enough to prevent British consolidation of political gains in South Carolina; ideally, enough to force Cornwallis to abandon the Carolinas altogether.\n\nGreene certainly had his own challenges, with the lack of supplies around Charlotte, North Carolina, and the general turbulence in his militia units. In another stroke of brilliance, Greene turned his logistics problem upside down and, in the process, utterly confounded Cornwallis. Greene split his army, ordering the light infantry and dragoons under the command of Brigadier General Daniel Morgan across the Broad River in northwestern South Carolina. Meanwhile, Greene marched the remaining Continentals and logistics trains to Cheraw Hill in far northeastern South Carolina.\n\nOrdering Morgan so far west accomplished several purposes. First, Morgan could draw his own provisions from the region, reducing the logistics strain on the Continental Army, while simultaneously denying the same resources to British units. Second, the presence of armed Continentals served to\n\n“spirit up” the local Patriots, and suppress potential and actual Tory sympathizers.3 Most importantly, Greene’s dispositions denied Cornwallis the freedom of maneuver, as a British advance toward either army would expose vulnerabilities for the other American army to attack. Goaded into action by Morgan’s incursion, Cornwallis attempted to trap Morgan’s flying army (Continental infantry and dragoons supported by light infantry militia; see Selected Glossary for more information), sending Lieutenant Colonel Banastre Tarleton’s British Legion to the west in pursuit. Tarleton’s overaggressive advance ended in a total defeat at the Cowpens on 15 January 1781.4 Disrupted and encircled by Morgan’s innovative three-line area defense, Tarleton lost around 80 percent of his 1,100 dragoons and infantry to death or capture.\n\nThe back-to-back defeats at Kings Mountain and the Cowpens provoked Cornwallis into abandoning his pacification mission in an all-out pursuit of Greene’s consolidated army in what is now known as the Race to the Dan. By early February 1781, Cornwallis’s command was hungry and tired, stranded in the destitute Dan River valley along the North Carolina-Virginia border with no effective Loyalist support. Cornwallis stubbornly refused to abandon his pursuit, and Greene skillfully kept the British Army at arm’s length across the Dan River, while his army refitted and received militia and state line reinforcements from Virginia and North Carolina. Although he was loath to risk his Continentals in battle, Greene realized that he had to fight Cornwallis to keep his regulars from returning to pacification tasks. Once Greene felt he had received sufficient supplies and reinforcements, he crossed the American force back into North Carolina in late February 1781. Even in close proximity to the enemy, Greene carefully moved his force to remain just out of reach of Cornwallis’s army until the British supply situation became critical. Finally, Greene camped his force of militia and Conti-2 Greene is even credited with convincing Gen Washington to adopt such a strategy of wearing down an opponent through a war of attrition and indirection.

Morgan, General Daniel Morgan: Reconsidered Hero (Morganton, NC: Burke County Historical Society, 2001), 22.\n\nXVII\n\nnentals at Guilford Courthouse, allowing Cornwallis to move to contact on 15 March 1781. The ensuing battle resulted in a narrow tactical win for the British field army, which retained possession of the ground and the abandoned Continental artillery pieces, while Greene successfully extricated his Continental regiments without severe manpower losses.\n\nIn the end, Cornwallis won the battle but, in the process, had driven his command to and beyond its offensive culmination point, as its regiments were badly hurt and could no longer effectively provision themselves in the region. Consequently, Cornwallis withdrew his command to the friendly seaport of Wilmington, North Carolina. Greene swiftly took advantage of Cornwallis’s withdrawal by marching back into South Carolina to reduce the remaining British bases. Although the Southern Army never won a single major battlefield victory during the remainder of the war, Greene’s indirect approach in leading the campaign ultimately drove the British from interior South Carolina. By the end of the war, the British were penned in their coastal enclaves around Charleston and Savannah, powerless to protect Loyalist supporters. Even in the dark days immediately after the Cowpens, and facing pursuit by an implacable enemy, Greene accurately envisioned the outcome of the Southern Campaign: “It is necessary we should take every possible precaution to guard against a misfortune.\n\nBut I am not without hopes of ruining Lord Cornwallis, if he persists in his mad scheme of pushing through the Country. . . . Here is a fine field and great glory ahead.”5\n\nGreene was not an exceptionally good battlefield commander, especially when compared to Morgan and Cornwallis. For example, Greene neglected much of Morgan’s thoughtful advice in handling militiamen by not giving them a realistic mission and clear commander’s guidance before the Battle of Guilford Courthouse. Greene lacked the ability to motivate and inspire the militia by direct example; after giving a tepid speech to the North Carolina militia at the first line, Greene retired to the Continental third line before the battle. Lacking a firm command presence, the first line collapsed quickly when confronted with British bayonets, and few North Carolinians remained to support the rest of the battle. Unlike Morgan’s relatively compact deployment at the Cowpens, Greene deployed his individual lines too far apart for mutual support, thus leaving his army open to defeat in detail.\n\nGreene’s genius is seen in his firm focus on operational goals, weakening Cornwallis’s army while avoiding the destruction of his Continental regiments. In that respect, Greene performed admirably.\n\nFrom the time his army crossed the Dan until the Battle of Guilford Courthouse on 15 March 1781, Greene played a daring game of hare and hounds, maintaining the initiative and forcing Cornwallis to react.6 Greene personally selected advantageous terrain near Guilford Courthouse and ensured his force had a well-thought-out plan in the event of a withdrawal.\n\nBy comparison, General Cornwallis comes across as a hard-fighting tactical commander who, despite having a professional military education, could not grasp the operational and strategic im-plications resulting from his tactical decisions. This point is probably best illustrated by Cornwallis’s decision to burn most of his logistics train during the pursuit of Greene’s army. From a tactical standpoint, the move allowed Cornwallis’s army to move faster and reduced the number of fighters needed to secure the trains. From an operational standpoint, the decision gravely impacted the ability of the British Army to sustain itself at long distance from the closest supply depots. Furthermore, Cornwallis did not study the British failures at Kings Mountain and the Cowpens to distill tactical lessons for future battles with the Americans. At Guilford Courthouse, Cornwallis used essentially the same linear infantry tactics as was used at Camden, even so much as employing his light infantry in the battle line 5 Nathanael Greene: Gen Greene to BGen Isaac Huger, 30 January 1781, in The Papers of General Nathanael Greene, vol. 7, 26 December 1780–29 March 1781, ed. Richard K. Showman, Dennis M. Conrad, and Roger N. Parks (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1994), 220. Greene’s remark came after he learned of Cornwallis’s burning of the baggage wagons, lightening the load of the army for the planned pursuit of Greene’s army.\n\n6 Hare and hounds refers to an early 1800s outdoor game in which some of the players leave a trail and others try to follow the trail to find and catch them; also a portable game of the same name and concept played with a board and pieces.\n\nXVIII\n\ninstead of performing their traditional battlefield screening and skirmishing tasks. Furthermore, the British Legion, crippled by the loss of its light infantry and the wastage of its best horses, was largely unable to penetrate the American dragoon screens to gather actionable intelligence about American strengths and dispositions. As a consequence of such leadership failures, British and Hessian units repeatedly blundered into American kill zones, and suffered heavy casualties at Guilford Courthouse.\n\nAlthough the battle took place more than 236 years ago, study of the Guilford Courthouse battle set within the context of the Southern Campaign will reveal many valuable insights into the operational and strategic levels of war. Many lessons are to be found at the tactical level as well. Of particular interest to junior leaders are the vignettes that highlight the exercise of leadership in combat, and how the participants faced their moment of destiny in battle.\n\nPLANNING AND ORGANIZATION\n\nA Game of Hare & Hounds: An Operational-level Command Study of the Guilford Courthouse Campaign, 18 January –15 March 1781 provides a systematic analysis of this key battle in the American Revolution.\n\nPart one provides a basic description of the American and British armies: weapons, tactics, logistics, communications, engineering, intelligence, and medical support. Part two offers a campaign-level overview followed by a detailed description of the battle. Part three recommends an itinerary of sites (or stands) to visit on the battlefield. Each stand is organized with directions, orientation to the battle site, detailed description of the action that occurred at the location, and vignettes drawn from participants in the battle, and each concludes with suggested questions for analysis. Part four provides an outline for the integration phase, in which students synthesize their classroom and field phase learning, ideally to glean relevant lessons for use in their military profession. Part five of this guide is written for the operations and logistics staff planners who will handle all of the administrative, training, and logistics coordination inherent with any good training event. Note, the author has included many direct quotes from primary source material throughout; original word and name spelling and capitalization variations have been retained without individual notations except where absolutely necessary for clarity. appendix A gives thumbnail biographical sketches of the major participants, appendix B provides a detailed order of battle, and appendix C gives a chronological account of the campaign. Finally, a selected bibliography is included with recommended sources for additional study before the terrain walk. The bulk of this guide is intended for the instructor/\n\nfacilitator, the individual who guides the execution of an applied history training event. To do so, the facilitator must become thoroughly familiar with the material, which is best done in conjunction with a personal reconnaissance to walk the battlefield and understand the relationship between the physical terrain features present at the time of the battle, and the historical events as they unfolded on the ground.7\n\nBefore conducting the classroom study and actual battlefield terrain walk, the instructor should provide a recommended list of read-ahead materials so students can gain a basic knowledge of the campaign and battle. The selected bibliography in the back of this guide is an excellent starting point, as it includes many digital documents easily downloaded at no cost to the student. Fortunately, a fair amount of primary source material, in the form of eyewitness accounts and reports, is available, which greatly helps in understanding the human dimensions of the battle. Besides this handbook, the author recommends the detailed National Park Service (NPS) study, The Battle of Guilford Court-7 Curtis S. King, “The Staff Ride” (PowerPoint presentation, Military History Instructor Course, U.S. Army Combat Studies Institute, Fort Leavenworth, KS, 2013), 1.\n\nXIX\n\nhouse written by Charles E. Hatch Jr., which is available at no cost from the NPS history publications repository.8\n\nIndividual study by the student is followed by an instructor-facilitated classroom study that im-parts basic historical and operational knowledge. To best increase buy-in and participation, the instructor should use a seminar format that assigns students to present a short functional briefing that describes a particular facet of the battle, such as major battlefield personality, warfighting function, branch or functional area, or major events before or during the battle.\n\nThe terrain walk portion of the staff ride should take no more than eight hours, as the battlefield (less the visitor center video and terrain map) is easily traversed on foot. The battlefield is relatively compact and encompassed by a paved multiuse road 2.25 miles (3.62 kilometers [km]) long. By foot, the walking distance from the American first line to the final battle line is slightly more than 1 km.\n\nThe battlefield is fairly well preserved in its original condition, with some significant exceptions. First, several monuments were installed after the battle that have no connection to the events of the battle, and if not accounted for by the staff ride facilitator, these can serve as a distraction during the terrain walk. The muddy fields traversed by Cornwallis’s troops in their first line attack are today covered in grass. The area west of the Joseph Hoskins farmstead, where Cornwallis initially deployed his troops, and around New Garden Meeting House, which saw the opening skirmish between Tarleton and Lieutenant Colonel Henry “Light-Horse Harry” Lee III, are now part of the urban sprawl of Greensboro, North Carolina. Most significantly, the open terrain to the west of the American third line, the portion that stretches from NPS marker 7 to 5, is flanked by a large marker that incorrectly identifies the area as the American third line. Later NPS scholarship places the position of the American third line about 400 meters uphill to the east-northeast, closer to the old courthouse.9 At the time of the final battle at the third line, much of the vale near the creek had been a cleared farm plot gone fallow, but today the intervening area is thickly wooded, which can cause some difficulties for participants trying to visualize the final engagements on the third line.\n\nThe sequence of stands in the guide is ordered to facilitate a logical flow with minimal backtracking; but the facilitator can easily add, modify, or delete stands as needed to best support the training objectives and time available. Each stand is written incorporating the U.S. Army Combat Studies Institute’s (CSI) staff ride logic structure: orient, describe, and analyze (ODA).10 First, provide orientation to the terrain and physical conditions (time, weather, and lighting) present at the time of the battle. Next, the instructor should lead a description of a particular action or aspect of the battle, when possible using the included vignettes from participants of the battle to illuminate the face of battle. Particularly useful here are role players describing their decisions and actions during the battle. Finally, an analysis portion should be included to provide time to allow students a chance to share insights derived from critical analysis, instructor-led synthesis of concepts and ideas, and a linkage to possible modern applications. At the end of the terrain walk comes the critical point of the entire event, the integration phase, which should take place shortly afterward, permitting students to capture, synthesize, and orally articulate their observations and insights. To omit or rush this portion is to miss the entire point of the staff ride: What did I learn, and how do I apply what I learned today to improve myself and/or my profession?11\n\n8 Charles E.

This first chapter will provide the reader with a concise survey of the organization, weapons, tactics, and support functions of the British and American armies, details that provide context to the historical events and leader decisions covered in the later chapters. For a more in-depth study of the subject, the reader is encouraged to consult the references in the selected bibliography, beginning with Charles E. Hatch Jr.’s study, Guilford Courthouse National Military Park: The Battle of Guilford Courthouse, which is available free of charge via the National Park Service’s digital reference library.1\n\nUNIT ORGANIZATION\n\nPrewar Colonial America\n\nBefore the American Revolution, the standing militia consisted of all able-bodied White males, aged 16–60, who were required to periodically assemble, or muster, for training with a musket, ammunition, and basic supplies. In times of threat from hostile intruders, militia were liable for service up to 90 days, but in practice the colonial governor would discharge the militia as soon as the crisis was passed. The militia was deemed sufficient to provide both internal and external security, so few British regular troops were stationed in America prior to the French and Indian War of 1754–63. During that conflict, a small number of Americans were enlisted as volunteer (Provincial) troops, with the majority of support given to the British Army from regular militia who were employed as scouts, guides, and skirmishers.\n\nAlthough a victory for the British, the war produced a wedge between American militia and British regulars: the Americans felt the British were arrogant and condescending, while Major General Edward Braddock’s defeat at the Battle of the Monongahela on 9 July 1755 exposed rampant ineptness within the British establishment. In turn, British regulars disdained the lack of discipline in the American militia ranks. Disagreements over the sharing of wartime costs, particularly the quartering and feeding of the regulars, was a contributing cause of the American Revolution in April 1775.2\n\nBirth of the Continental Army\n\nAfter the Middlesex County battles at Lexington and Concord in April 1775, New England militia units converged on Boston to reinforce the Massachusetts regiments besieging the town. Each state had its own commander in chief and problems with unity of command soon became apparent.\n\nSo, on 14 July 1775, the Second Continental Congress created a new national army by mustering state militia regiments into service for a six-month period. To command the new Continental Army, Congress selected Colonel George Washington, a Virginia militia colonel with combat experience during the French and Indian War. By March 1776, General Washington and Congress had organized a Continental Army with an authorized strength of 13,000 officers and soldiers in 27 regular infantry regiments. To exercise theater-level operational command, Congress created three departments, 1 Charles E. Hatch Jr., Guilford Courthouse National Military Park: The Battle of Guilford Courthouse (Washington, DC: U.S. Department of the Interior Office of History and Historic Architecture, 1971).\n\n2 Richard W. Stewart, ed., American Military History, vol. 1, The United States Army and the Forging of a Nation, 1775–1917, 2d ed. (Washington DC: U.S. Army Center of Military History, 2009), 30–32.\n\n5\n\neach commanded by a Continental major general. Significantly, the department commander lacked command authority over state militia units, unless explicitly granted by the state governor.3\n\nThe infantry regiment was the largest permanent tactical unit in the Continental Army. Commanded by a colonel and assisted by a lieutenant colonel and major, the regiment was authorized eight companies, each with 1 captain as commander, 4 other officers, 8 noncommissioned officers (NCOs), 2 musicians, and 76 privates, totaling 728 officers and soldiers. Enlisted soldiers were generally drawn from the lower classes of society, and their length of enlistment varied according to the fortunes of war.4 By contrast, most officers came from the prewar gentry or mercantile class and were usually commissioned for the duration of the war. For field service, regiments were grouped into brigades or divisions commanded by a senior colonel or brigadier general, which were in turn combined into a field army commanded by a major general. Staff roles were filled by detailed regimental officers. One such example was Lieutenant Colonel Otho Holland Williams, who functioned both as an adjutant for the Southern Department and deputy commander of the 1st Maryland Regiment.\n\nMost logistics functions, quartermaster, and transportation activities were handled by skilled civilian contractors.\n\nThe high cost of recruiting, training, and sustaining both horses and dragoons meant the Continental light dragoon establishment was limited to four regiments, each authorized 280 officers and troops. In a cost-avoidance move, many states raised their own militia dragoon troops, which were cheaper to maintain than the full-time Continental troops. Dissatisfaction with the poor self-defense capabilities of the dragoons led Washington in 1780 to reorganize the dragoon regiments into legionary corps by converting two troops into light infantry. The change not only created a better-balanced light unit, but with 100 fewer horses to feed it produced a substantial cost savings for the cash-strapped Americans. The success of the legionary corps led to further reorganization to create partisan corps, each authorized four troops of dragoons and four companies of light infantry.5\n\nDespite the relative lack of artillery units in the colonial militias, the Continental Army was able to field a fairly robust and effective artillery force under the leadership of Major General Henry Knox.6 In 1776, the Continental Army organized a 12-company artillery regiment using captured British cannons and a cadre of ex-Royal artillerymen from the French and Indian Wars. The regiment served as an administrative headquarters to the artillery companies, with each authorized 6 officers, 8 NCOs, 9 bombardiers, 18 gunners (ranked as privates but paid extra as specialists), and 32 matrosses (artillery privates ranking below gunners). During campaigns, artillery companies were usually attached in direct support to Continental infantry brigades.7\n\nProviding specialized logistics support to the Continental Army were artificer companies supervised by the department’s Quartermaster Department.8 In the Southern Department, Major General Greene established an intermediate logistics depot at Salisbury, North Carolina, to support operations in the Carolinas and Georgia. Salisbury functioned as a distribution point for supplies 3 Steven E. Clay, “Staff Ride Guide to the Saratoga Campaign” (unpublished draft manuscript, Combat Studies Institute, U.S. Army Combined Arms Center, 2017), 3–5. The length of detail varied from 90 days for traditional militia unit up to 18 months for state line units, such as the Virginia Line units that fought at Guilford Courthouse.\n\n4 Robert K.

Artificers were skilled craftsmen who provided important logistics support. Quartermaster artificers built and maintained camp barracks, wagons, and bateaux (flat-bottomed boats) and in the field assisted combat troops in building field fortifications. Artillery artificers had similar carpentry skills, used in building artillery carriages and wagons, but were trained to repair cannon and small arms.\n\n6\n\nand ordnance stores, as well as providing equipment maintenance and manufacturing support to Continental units in the region.9\n\nThe American Army: State Troops\n\nTheoretically, each state adopted the Continental regimental structure for their militia regiments, but in practice the units varied in organization, method of recruitment, and length of service. As Greene was to realize, Patriot militia units came with considerable advantages, as well as significant limitations.\n\nTheoretically, militia would report for field duty with the basic arms and accoutrements, requiring little more than daily rations and an occasional resupply from Continental ordnance stores. In reality, many of these troops reported for duty missing vital equipment and even weapons, so Greene’s quartermasters had to keep stocks of muskets, uniforms, and accoutrements for resupplying state troops. When around their home districts, Patriot militia provided invaluable intelligence concerning the terrain and loyalty of the population and would often fight harder in the defense of their homes and townships. A significant number of militia officers and NCOs had prior experience in frontier or conventional wars and some even had prior Continental experience. When intelligently led and employed according to their capabilities, militia units were potent force multipliers for the Continental Army—best exemplified by Brigadier General Daniel Morgan’s skillful employment of militia at the Cowpens in January 1781.10 However, Patriot militia had significant weaknesses. If well-led, a militia might stand for a time under heavy fire, but it would invariably give way to a British bayonet assault, as these troops were seldom trained or equipped for bayonet fighting. The motivation and effectiveness of the militia units tended to drop the farther they marched from their home districts. Even with quality leadership, discipline in militia units was seldom good, and a battlefield reverse would often result in widespread desertions. Finally, the predilection of militia to bring their own horses and their demands for fodder further burdened the already strained Continental quartermaster system.11\n\nThe Continental Southern Department, 1779–81\n\nFirst organized in February 1776, the Southern Department evolved into a backwater after then-major general Sir Henry Clinton’s bungled attempt to take Charleston, South Carolina, in April 1776. The uncoordinated British attempt to force Charleston Harbor failed partially due to the stubborn American resistance, but principally due to the failure of the British Army and Royal Navy to coordinate their actions. Emboldened by the British failure, southern Patriots largely suppressed Loyalist (Tory) militia organization efforts within the region. The surprise capture of Savannah, Georgia, in December 1778 alerted the Americans to the British shift in strategy toward the southern colonies. Congress scraped together reinforcements and by early 1780, department commander Major General Benjamin Lincoln had a force of 3,500 troops defending Charleston. Lincoln’s force included all of the Continental infantry regiments from Georgia and the Carolinas, state regiments from Virginia, and a small contingent of regular and militia dragoons. After an extended campaign and siege, marked in large part by American ineptness, now-lieutenant general Clinton’s army captured Charleston on 12 May 1780. Clinton had learned from the mistakes of 1776 and employed an indirect approach to isolate Charleston from its vulnerable landward side and used capable liaison 9 Lawrence E. Babits and Joshua B. Howard, Long, Obstinate, and Bloody: The Battle of Guilford Courthouse (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2009), 25.\n\n10 Wright, The Continental Army, 166.\n\n11 Wright, The Continental Army, 67–75.\n\n7\n\nofficers to prod the reluctant Royal Navy commodore to effectively support the British Army. Further disaster befell the American cause when the last remaining Continental detachment in South Carolina was destroyed at the Waxhaws on 29 May 1780 by Lieutenant Colonel Banastre Tarleton’s British Legion.12\n\nThe Continental Congress responded to the Charleston debacle by reconstituting the Southern Army in North Carolina, using the reinforced Maryland-Delaware Division as a nucleus. Congress overruled General Washington’s objections to appoint Major General Horatio Gates, the hero of the Saratoga campaign, as the department commander. Disregarding sound advice from his subordinates, Gates then marched his little army through the pro-Tory pine barrens of central South Carolina to attack the poorly defended British base at Camden. Warned of Gates’s approach by Loyalist sympathizers, General Lord Charles Cornwallis consolidated his scattered regiments and marched to confront Gates. Advanced elements of both armies fought a brief meeting engagement on the night of 14 August 1780. The next morning, Gates badly fumbled his combat deployment, placing his militia regiments so that they were easily shattered by Cornwallis’s best regiments, who in turn outflanked and crushed the outnumbered Continentals, killing 900 and capturing 1,000 prisoners along with the American artillery park and logistics trains. Assuming that American resistance was largely crushed, Cornwallis decided to resume his advance into North Carolina after the fall harvest.\n\nCornwallis’s plans were upended when a band of Patriot militia demolished his best militia forces at Kings Mountain, South Carolina, in October 1780.\n\nStunned by the disaster and plagued by sickness in the ranks, Cornwallis suspended his offensive and withdrew his army to winter quarters around Winnsborough, South Carolina.13 Meanwhile, in December 1780, Major General (and Quartermaster) Nathanael Greene rode into Hillsborough, North Carolina, and quietly relieved Gates from department command. Greene reviewed his command to find only 905 Continentals and 1,500 militia—many sick and all dispirited and hungry. After performing a reconnaissance of his new department and briefly pondering his dismal circumstances, Greene moved to seize the initiative. Mindful of his weak army, Greene deliberately planned to divide it to confound Cornwallis, thus keeping the British from resuming the offensive into North Carolina. First, Greene sent the flying army of 1,200 light infantry and dragoons under command of Brigadier General Morgan west of the Catawba River to threaten the British supply base at the town of Ninety Six, South Carolina. Meanwhile, Greene marched the rest of his army into the pro-Patriot Cheraw Hill region in South Carolina, where he could safely subsist his command while threatening Cornwallis’s lines of communication to the coast.\n\nGreene’s strategy of dividing his army triggered a violent reaction from Cornwallis, who in turn split his army in an attempt to trap and destroy Morgan’s light corps. Instead, Morgan set up a well-planned defense at the Cowpens, and decisively defeated Lieutenant Colonel Tarleton’s British Legion there on 17 January 1781. Afterward, Greene consolidated his army and withdrew toward North Carolina with hundreds of British prisoners in tow. During several weeks in January and February 1781, Greene orchestrated an extended delaying action (which included evacuating the Salisbury depot) that ended when the Americans reached sanctuary in southern Virginia with no appreciable losses. There, Greene refitted and reorganized his army, which consisted principally of Brigadier General Isaac Huger’s Virginia Continental Brigade of 900 fighters and Colonel Otho Holland Williams’s Maryland Continental Brigade of 800 soldiers. In support of the Continental infantry were 210 dragoons, around 600 light infantry and riflemen, and a Continental artillery company of four 12 Babits and Howard, Long, Obstinate, and Bloody, 6.\n\n13 John W. Gordon, South Carolina and the American Revolution: A Battlefield History (Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 2003), 92–95.\n\n8\n\n6-pounder cannons. Greene was still critically short of militia personnel, with Colonel Andrew Pickens’s Carolina militia regiment of 200–300 troops as his best contingent. While the Continentals rested and refitted, Greene called for more militia reinforcements.14\n\nThe British Army: Regulars, Provincials, and Militia\n\nRegulars\n\nBy 1780, Lord George Germain, secretary of state for the American colonies, was in overall control of British grand strategy in North America, which was divided into two defined geographic commands. Clinton functioned as commander in chief and governor-general of all British -controlled land from the south of the Saint Lawrence River down to the Gulf of Mexico.15 As in the Continental Army, infantry regiments were the largest permanent tactical unit in the British Army and were normally paired in temporary brigades under a field army commanded by a major or lieutenant general.\n\nBritish regiments were commanded by a colonel assisted by a lieutenant colonel, a major, and a small specialist staff, and were nominally composed of 12 infantry companies. When a regiment deployed to North America, two companies were left behind in Britain for recruiting, leaving eight line infantry and two flank companies, one of light infantry and the other a grenadier company. Originally, grenadier companies were formed by tall and strong infantry employed in assaulting fortifications with black powder grenades. By 1776, the grenadier function was obsolete, but the name was retained as a mark of honor for the infantry company deployed on the right of the regiment, traditionally the point of decisive action in combat. Light infantry companies were organized and trained to provide skirmishers, when the regiment was not traditionally deployed to protect the left of the regiment. The grenadier and light infantry companies naturally attracted the best soldiers in the regiment, so they were often grouped into ad hoc assault battalions under division or army control. Compared to the theoretical fighting strength of 544 muskets in a Continental regiment, a British regiment organized for combat fielded only 448 muskets.16\n\nThe high cost of shipping and maintaining horses in North America meant the British limited their mounted troop strength in the American colonies to two dragoon regiments. By comparison, the British Army was well supported by the Royal Artillery Regiment, which was considered a separate and coequal military service. Royal Artillery battalions served as a purely administrative echelon, with the artillery company as the primary tactical echelon. Artillery companies had a standard organization that varied according to the availability and type of cannon systems. Cannons were useful for their moral effect on the battlefield but were heavy and costly to move, a factor that limited British field artillery employment in the Southern Campaign to 3- and 6-pounder cannons.17\n\nThe British Army clearly held many tactical advantages over the Continental Army, as it was a well-established professional military force with a long tradition of battlefield victory. Many of the officers and NCOs were combat veterans, but regardless of combat experience, all were capable of quickly molding new recruits into professional soldiers. As a consequence, the Continental Army fought at a decided disadvantage in the early years of the war, not reaching tactical parity until the Battle of Monmouth near Monmouth Court House, New Jersey, in June 1778. However, the tactical prowess of the British Army was constrained by significant strategic weaknesses, particularly logistics, 14 Babits and Howard, Long, Obstinate, and Bloody, 220–21.\n\n15 David K. Wilson, The Southern Strategy: Britain’s Conquest of South Carolina and Georgia, 1775–1780 (Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 2005), 59–60.\n\n16 Wright, The Continental Army, 47–49. The actual combat strengths of infantry regiments were generally 40–60 percent of authorization due to sickness and details.\n\n17 Clay, “Staff Ride Guide to the Saratoga Campaign,” 19–22.\n\n9\n\nas the supply lines between England and North America were long and vulnerable to enemy interdiction. In addition, recruiting of native British volunteers was difficult, as soldiering was not considered an honorable profession and lurid tales of combat in the wilds of North America dissuaded many volunteers. Even after the depot regiments collected a sufficient number of new recruits, many were bound to die by disease or accident before even reaching their regiments in the field. As a consequence, British infantry regiments in North America were chronically undermanned throughout the war.18\n\nProvincials\n\nThe practice of enlisting Americans in provincial regiments dates back to the French and Indian War and was revived as a means of offsetting shortages of regular units. Provincial regiments enjoyed the same pay and benefits as the regulars but were limited to service only for the duration of the war. In the hierarchy of the British Army, provincial officers were lower in status than regulars and were not entitled to half pay and permanent retention of rank after demobilization. Many of the provincial units to serve in the Southern Campaign were actually raised in New York and New Jersey, including one such provisional corps of volunteers organized by Major Patrick Ferguson in late 1779. After the capture of Charleston, Ferguson’s provincials were used to organize and train Carolina Loyalist militias. In October 1780, Ferguson’s provincial corps and some 800 of his best militia were killed or captured at the Battle of Kings Mountain. Left untouched by the disaster was the 150-person Royal North Carolina (Provincial) Regiment, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel John Hamilton, which remained with General Cornwallis’s army throughout the Southern Campaign, serving as the guard force for the British logistics echelon.19\n\nAs noted earlier, the British lacked sufficient light dragoons for intelligence, patrolling, and flank security missions. Lieutenant General Clinton prodded local Loyalists to raise additional provincial units, and by July 1778, the British Legion was organized with 250 dragoons and 200 light infantry under the field command of Lieutenant Colonel Tarleton. For the Southern Campaign, additional infantry units and a 3-pounder cannon section were attached to the British Legion to create a robust combined arms regiment of 1,100 fighters. However, Tarleton’s tactical ineptitude led to the loss or capture of most of his command at the Battle of Cowpens in January 1781, reducing the British Legion to a remnant of 272 mounted soldiers.20\n\nLoyalist Militia\n\nThe British expended considerable effort during the summer of 1780 in organizing district militia regiments as part of the overall pacification strategy, with Major Ferguson and his provincial troops as trainers and cadre. In late August 1780, Cornwallis ordered Ferguson to deploy with his best militia regiments into the Blue Ridge piedmont to expand his pacification and recruiting efforts. Aroused by the Loyalist presence so close to their settlements, the Overmountain men formed an expedition that surrounded and destroyed Ferguson’s Loyalist corps at Kings Mountain in October 1780.21 Soured by the poor performance of the Loyalist militia at Kings Mountain, Cornwallis halted organizing the militia until the loss of the light infantry at the Cowpens forced the resumption of recruiting efforts. By that 18 Clay, “Staff Ride Guide to the Saratoga Campaign,” 22.\n\n19 “An Introduction to North Carolina Loyalist Units,” On-Line Institute for Advanced Loyalist Studies (website), accessed 7 November 2018.\n\n20 Babits and Howard, Long, Obstinate, and Bloody, 80.\n\n21 Wilma Dykeman, With Fire and Sword: The Battle of Kings Mountain 1780 (Washington, DC: National Park Service, Department of the Interior, 1991), 12–14. The overmountain region was the area to the west of the Appalachian Mountains settled principally by Scots-Irish settlers after the French and Indian War, in defiance of English law. Although conscious of old abuses by the crown, and resentful of the high-handed behavior of the royal governor before the American Revolution, these western settlers did not become involved in the war until they were threatened by Loyalist incursions. Those Patriots who crossed back to the east over the mountain to fight against Loyalist forces were referred to as Overmountain men.\n\n10\n\nstage in the campaign, few Loyalists were willing to volunteer, partly out of fear of Patriot retribution but also due to frequent abuse by the British regulars, as Commissary Charles Stedman ruefully related:\n\n“[the British] could not have proceeded but for the personal exertions of the militia, who, with a zeal that did them infinite honour, rendered the most important services . . . in return for these exertions, the militia were maltreated by abusive language and even beaten.”22 Later in North Carolina, Cornwallis\n\n“erected the king’s standard, and invited by proclamation all loyal subjects to repair to it, and take an active part in assisting him to restore order and constitutional government.”23 Ruin soon fell on the British efforts when a newly recruited Loyalist militia battalion was destroyed in a one-sided battle, Pyle’s hacking match, in February 1781. The destruction of Colonel John Pyle’s Loyalist unit made obvious the inability of the British to protect their own supporters, as noted by Patriot militia commander Colonel Andrew Pickens: “It has knocked up Toryism altogether in this part.”24\n\nThe German Units\n\nBesides recruiting from loyal Americans, Britain contracted for combat units from several German states, finding the payment easier than the effort to raise and equip additional regiments. The Landgraviate of Hesse-Cassel was the largest contributor to the British effort, and so Americans generically called all German units “Hessians” regardless of origin. The Germans were not truly mercenaries, as the regiments were organized for conventional European wars, and staffed with long-service professional soldiers who did not individually volunteer for overseas duty. The troops received no additional pay or incentives for being in America; instead, the financial benefits accrued to the German princes who contracted out their regiments. German regiments were organized differently than British or American units, with variations between different German states. Each German regiment was commanded by a colonel, seconded by a lieutenant colonel, major, and a staff of 18 other officers and enlisted. A typical German regiment was composed of five or six line infantry companies and one grenadier company.\n\nEach company was led by a captain, up to 3 lieutenants, and 10 NCOs and comprised between 114\n\nand 165 enlisted. A German regiment could field between 525 and 690 muskets depending on how it was organized—surpassing the firepower of a British regiment, and on par with, if not surpassing, that of the Continental regiments.25\n\nTwo German units were among the reinforcements sent to Cornwallis’s army in early 1781. The first was a single jäger (hunter) rifle company detached from its parent regiment and commanded by Captain Friedrich W. von Roeder. The company was authorized two officers, one NCO, and 78 riflemen. Jägers were fighters recruited from hunters and gamekeepers and trained and equipped to perform light infantry and sharpshooting missions. The second German unit was the Von Bose Regiment of five companies, which deployed to America in 1776. The Von Bose saw minor service in New York and New Jersey before taking part in the Savannah campaign in 1778. The Von Bose wore blue uniforms with white facings, similar enough to Continental uniforms to cause confusion on the battlefield. For the campaign, platoons of Von Bose infantry were task organized with platoons of the Ansbach jägers.26\n\nWEAPONS\n\nMuskets\n\nThe primary infantry weapon used by the British Army was the Short Land Pattern Brown Bess 22 As quoted in John Buchanan, The Road to Guilford Courthouse: The American Revolution in the Carolinas (New York: Wiley, 1997), 244.\n\n23 Charles Stedman, The History of the Origin, Progress, and Termination of the American War, vol. 2 (London: J. Murray, 1794), 332.\n\n24 Buchanan, The Road to Guilford Courthouse, 39.\n\n25 Clay, “Staff Ride Guide to the Saratoga Campaign,” 20–22.\n\n26 Babits and Howard, Long, Obstinate, and Bloody, 80–81, 88–89. Ansbach jägers were so called after the city of their origin: Ansbach, Germany.\n\n11\n\n.75-caliber smoothbore flintlock musket of varying lengths, which weighed around 10 pounds, fired a .69-caliber one-and-a-half-ounce lead ball, and mounted a deadly 16-inch socket bayonet. Tactics of the time emphasized the shock value of massed volley fire, so the weapons were not equipped with sights and soldiers seldom received marksmanship training. The British Army fielded the first Short Land Pattern muskets in the 1720s, and many were furnished to the colonial militia armories; consequently, many Brown Bess muskets saw service in the Patriot militia ranks. British fusilier regiments, such as the 23d Foot (Welch Fusiliers), were issued a fusil, a slightly lighter and shorter version of the Short Land Pattern musket.\n\nAt least 48,000 of the .69-caliber French Charleville Model 1763 and 1766 muskets were smuggled into the colonies from France beginning in 1777 and were adopted as the primary musket issued to Continental regiments. The M1766 musket was 57 inches long, weighed about 10 pounds, and fired a 1-ounce .65-caliber ball, which was often supplemented with the addition of lead buckshot in each paper cartridge (buck and ball) that would theoretically create a shotgun-like pattern of projectiles with each volley. Some American militia units carried the Charleville, but more carried Brown Bess muskets or a mix of personal rifles and shotguns.\n\nThe Von Bose Regiment was armed with .72-caliber Potzdam Model 1720 muskets, which had an overall length of 51 inches and a barrel length of 34 inches and weighed about 9 pounds. The\n\n.72-caliber bore meant the German troops could use the same .69-caliber cartridges used by the British, thus simplifying logistics. By 1780, the weapons fielded to the Von Bose Regiment were more than 50 years old and in poor repair, leading Major Johann Christian du Buy to unsuccessfully lobby for replacement with the Brown Bess muskets. Apparently, du Buy’s request was ignored until after the Guilford Courthouse battle, when the regiment belatedly received new Brown Bess muskets from stores at Wilmington, North Carolina.27\n\nMuskets versus Rifles\n\nIn terms of strict accuracy, the smoothbore musket had an effective range one-third less than that of a rifle—less than 100 meters versus 300 meters.28 Yet, despite the obvious disadvantages in range and accuracy, muskets offered more advantages in combat compared to rifles, which is why muskets were the principal infantry weapon of European armies. First, mass-produced muskets were robustly made, designed for hard usage and ease of maintenance in the field. Second, smoothbores were much less affected by black powder fouling due to the loose fit of the ball in the barrel. When fired at close range, the heavy lead musket ball was capable of causing carnage in the enemy ranks, even more so with buck and ball cartridges. Finally, a bayonet-tipped musket gave a musketeer a decided advantage over a rifleman in close-in combat.29\n\nFinely crafted muzzle-loaded flintlock rifles were employed by both sides, but in secondary or specialist roles. A skilled shooter using their own Pennsylvania rifle could accurately hit a squirrel at 200 meters and an adult-size target out to 300 meters. In exchange for such accuracy and range, the effective rate of fire was about one round per minute, as the rifleman had to measure powder from a horn, nest the ball into a greased patch, and pound the whole into the rifling with a ramrod—a task that increased in difficulty once unburnt powder fouled the bore. Rifles were designed for hunting, not combat; they were not designed to mount bayonets and would break apart if used in hand-to\n\n-hand combat. Variations in each handcrafted rifle meant a skilled gunsmith had to repair the weapons, 27 Bill Ahern and Robert Nittolo, British Military Long Arms in Colonial America (Pittsburgh, PA: Dorrance, 2018), 409.\n\n28 Lawrence E. Babits, A Devil of a Whipping: The Battle of Cowpens (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1998), 13.\n\n29 Babits, A Devil of a Whipping, 13.\n\n12\n\nwhile the shooter had to cast their own bullets.30 Pennsylvania or Deckard rifled flintlock muskets ranged in caliber from .36 to .48. The Ansbach jägers used a similar .67-caliber hunting rifle ( büchse); thus, German riflemen were known as jäger, which means hunter in German. Smaller and shorter than a Pennsylvania rifle, the büchse has a correspondingly shorter effective range of 175 yards.31\n\nSecondary Weapons\n\nIn terms of the tactics of the time, the bayonet was the mission-essential secondary weapon for regular infantry soldiers. After reducing the strength of an enemy’s formation through firepower, an infantry regiment would march forward and break a shaken enemy line with the press of the bayonet.\n\nBayonets for each army were all similar in basic design: a long spike blade varying between 14 and 18\n\ninches in length and mounted to the muzzle of the weapon by a socket and stud.\n\nOfficers on both sides carried swords, both as a badge of rank and for close-range combat, and some specialist troops, such as the soldiers of the Ansbach jäger company, carried a short sword ( Hirschfänger or deer catcher) when a bayonet was not practical. Continental officers were ordered by General Washington to carry a spear-like spontoon (a.k.a. half-pike) as a visible mark of authority on the battlefield. British officers had long rejected the use of spontoons on the battlefield, and some went further by exchanging their swords in favor of a privately procured fusil (light flintlock musket) and bayonet, thus reducing their visibility to a sharp-eyed Patriot rifleman. The practice was con-demned by Lieutenant General Clinton, as he believed a fusil-armed officer was too easily distracted from their command duties:\n\nGeneral Burgoyne and I have often represented the absurdity of officers’ being armed with fusils, and the still greater impropriety . . . by which they neglected the opportunity of employing their divisions to advantage. . . . an inconvenience which I had long apprehend-ed might result from officers’ carrying fuzees, which was then and had been the general practice on the American service.32\n\nOne common secondary weapon carried by American soldiers was the tomahawk or hatchet that made for a lethal close-range weapon capable of killing or immobilizing an opponent with a heavy blow.\n\nDragoons\n\nThe cavalry organizations on both sides in the Southern Campaign were routinely task organized with light infantry to form robust mobile units suitable for screening, pursuit, and delaying actions in support of the main infantry force. Unlike European cavalry, who were only trained to fight while mounted, light dragoons were trained to fight both on horseback and as dismounted skirmishers with the light infantry. For dismounted work, dragoons carried a smoothbore flintlock carbine, while the heavy-bladed saber was the weapon of choice when mounted, as mounted shock action with the saber was preferred by commanders on both sides.33\n\nArtillery\n\nNomenclature for artillery guns was based on the weight of the solid shot; a 3-pounder gun fired 30 Babits, A Devil of a Whipping, 14–15.\n\n31 Babits and Howard, Long, Obstinate, and Bloody, 81.\n\n32 “British Officer Infantry Weaponry, 1768–1786,” His Majesty’s 62d Regiment of Foot (website), accessed 10 January 2018.\n\n33 Babits, A Devil of a Whipping, 20.\n\n13\n\na solid shot weighing 3 pounds, and so on. Guns were made of durable bronze; 6-pounder guns mounted on a wood and iron two-wheeled carriage weighed 900 pounds and required two horses to move. Three-pounders mounted on a wheeled carriage weighed about 500 pounds, light enough for movement by a single horse or the gun crew during a battle. Three- and 6-pounders were considered field guns due to their relatively light weight and mobility. The standard crew for a 6-pounder field gun was 15 soldiers led by a commissioned officer and seconded by a sergeant and a corporal; the 3-pounder crew was a minimum of one officer, two gunners, and eight fighters. Each gun crew had one or more specialist gunners who calculated distance and elevation and rammed, aimed, and sponged the cannon, while the bombardier handled the vent and loading of the correct ammunition in the breech. The remaining crew consisted of matrosses and artillery privates, the soldiers who positioned the gun and passed ammunition to the bombardier.34\n\nCannons fired four major types of ammunition: shot, grape, canister, and shell. Solid cast iron round shot was used primarily against massed infantry and cavalry targets but was also used for battering fortifications and engaging in counterbattery fires. Maximum ranges for a 6-pounder gun firing solid shot was around 1,000 meters; the 3-pounder’s range was about 800 meters. Grapeshot was a medium-range antipersonnel round consisting of a cluster of golf ball-size metal balls loaded in a wood and canvas container that disintegrated during firing to release a cluster of projectiles toward the target. Canister, or case shot, consisted of musket balls packed in a tin container that shattered on discharge to release a shotgun-like fan of bullets against enemy formations at ranges of less than 400 meters. Shells were hollow iron spheres filled with explosives, primarily fired at high angles from howitzers and mortars to explode on or within enemy fortifications and installations.35\n\nTACTICS\n\nInfantry Tactics\n\nBy 1780, conventional linear tactics built around the flintlock musket and bayonet had been in use for more than 100 years. For combat, infantry were deployed in linear formation, usually in two to three ranks to maximize the effect of en masse or volley fire to the front. Infantry regiments formed the standard infantry tactical unit, known as heavy infantry or the line infantry. The primary tactical goal of every army was the synchronized employment of all arms, infantry, dragoons, and artillery to break the enemy line of battle. Once the enemy line broke, a bayonet charge and pursuit by dragoons was employed to seal the victory for the still-intact infantry line.\n\nThe standard sequence of events for battle opened with an approach march in column formation by the attacking army to reach a suitable battle position. Open ground, with a natural obstacle such as a river or swamp to protect one or both flanks was considered ideal for an army assuming a defensive role. When possible, the attacking army would deploy from its marching columns into battle line out of range of the enemy’s cannon systems. Once deployed, the attacking force would advance to within 100 yards of the enemy line, the effective engagement range of the musket. During this approach march, skirmishers, sharpshooters, and artillery on both sides would engage to attrite and demoralize the enemy force.\n\nOnce within a suitable killing distance, infantry regiments would begin engaging with controlled volley fire directed by the officers, which was intended to shock and break cohesion of the enemy unit.\n\nA well-trained unit could load and fire its weapons about three times per minute while under fire; 34 Janice E. McKenney, The Organizational History of the Field Artillery, 1775–2003, Army Lineage Series (Washington, DC: U.S. Army Center of Military History, 2007), 9–10.\n\n35 “Artillery,” AmericanRevolution.org, accessed 26 June 2019.\n\n14\n\nin practice, volley fire by company or division was done to avoid having the entire regiment without loaded muskets. Speed was stressed over accuracy, as the shock of repeated volleys was intended to stagger and disorder the enemy line. Under ideal combat conditions, about 20 percent of the rounds from a volley were expected to hit an enemy infantry line at 50 yards. Casualties were naturally lower at greater engagement ranges or when the natural cover or fortifications were involved in the fighting.\n\nThe cumulative effect of sustained volley fire was intended to produce casualties and a loss of cohesion that would soften up the enemy line sufficiently for a bayonet attack. Fierce hand-to-hand fighting could take place if the troops in the weaker line stood and fought; more likely, the disorganized side would break and retreat. Few infantry regiments, even well-trained ones, possessed the discipline to actually stand and receive a bayonet charge, and for the poorly equipped Patriot militia and state units, retreat was the usual outcome when facing British regulars.\n\nIn addition to the line (heavy) infantry, there were a number of specialist infantry units. Light infantry companies were specially trained to advance in an open skirmish line, performing screening and reconnaissance duties well ahead of the parent regiment. Skirmishers operated in fireteams of two to four fighters, with one or more soldiers engaging the enemy with aimed fire while the others reloaded, all well-dispersed to present a reduced target to enemy skirmishers. During the Southern Campaign, the Americans generally used their light infantry in their designated role, while their British counterparts often consolidated the light units into a provisional line infantry battalion. British and Hessian grenadiers, for which there was no American equivalent, were generally consolidated into provisional battalions for concentrated employment as specialist assault troops. Rifle-armed troops on both sides were similarly employed as light infantry, with tactics modified to account for their slower rates of fire and vulnerability to line infantry. Besides performing skirmishing tasks, riflemen were commonly used to engage enemy commanders and weapon crews, usually from the flanks or an overwatch position where reach and accuracy of the rifles could be used to maximum effect. Shortly before the Guilford Courthouse battle, Major General Greene task organized his rifle battalions, light infantry companies, and dragoons into what he termed a corps of observation—a combined arms grouping that maximized the effectiveness of each system while minimizing individual vulnerabilities.\n\nIn particular, the riflemen needed the close presence of bayonet-armed light infantry and friendly dragoons for protection against hostile infantry and dragoons. With the notable exception of the Kings Mountain battle, every major battle in the South was fought by musket-armed Continental and British regulars using modified linear tactics, while dragoons, riflemen, and artillerymen performed important but auxiliary roles.\n\nDragoon Tactics\n\nIn theory, dragoons were organized and equipped to ride to their place of battle, dismount at a distance from the objective, and maneuver into combat fighting with muskets or rifles. These tactics required the dragoons to leave the horses under the care of every fourth person in the unit. As this practice would considerably reduce the firepower of the squadron, the tactic was seldom used in combat. Instead, dragoons fought mounted, attacking the flanks or rear of vulnerable infantry units with slashing broadsword attacks, while relying on attached infantry to provide a base of fire and protection against a superior force. Other battlefield tasks for the dragoons were the engagement of hostile mounted troops, reconnaissance, and pursuit of a defeated enemy. At the Battle of Guilford Courthouse campaign, Lieutenant Colonel Tarleton’s British Legion consisted of 272 mounted troops, while Greene’s army fielded 244 dragoons divided between Lieutenant Colonel Henry “Light-Horse Harry” Lee and Washington’s Corps of Observation.\n\n15\n\nArtillery Tactics\n\nIn terms of battlefield employment, infantry and dragoon tactics were relatively simple and straightforward. By contrast, the artillery arm was a specialized, technically oriented branch requiring skilled officers and soldiers to function properly on the battlefield. Each type of cannon (gun) had peculiarities and variables impacting the weapon’s effectiveness, factors compounded by the effects of wind, temperature, and humidity. Consequently, artillery specialists required mathematical skills and a great deal of training before gaining proficiency as gunners. As casualties were inevitable in combat, cross-training each fighter to learn the tasks of the others was necessary. Once crews gained proficiency, the company commander would train the gun sections to function together. Tactically, sections of two to three guns were commonly assigned in a direct support role to an infantry brigade, although the army commander might elect to keep them in general support, ready for counterbattery, harass-ment, or reinforcement roles. Gunners preferred to emplace their weapons well out of enemy rifle range, positioned on the friendly flank so that the guns could enfilade (fire down the long axis) of the enemy infantry as it closed within range. For long-range engagements, gunners calculated the fall of the shot to create a bounce or ricochet effect through the enemy line, thus maximizing casualties. At engagement ranges less than 400 meters, gunners would switch from solid shot to grape or canister and would continue the engagement until the enemy line was within 100 meters, too close to safely fire. The guns could then revert to a flank protection role, although they were often withdrawn into reserve to avoid casualties from enemy rifle fire. On the attack, guns were unlimbered (detached or unpacked) from their vulnerable draft animals, and the crews pushed and dragged the guns forward, ready to lend immediate fire support at the quick halt. In improved defensive positions, guns were emplaced on the flank of the principal infantry line, positioned behind a redoubt of earth in such a way to enfilade the enemy infantry with grape or canister rounds before reaching the friendly works\n\n—without being engaged in return by enemy riflemen or guns. The longer-range 6-pounders were emplaced to perform both antipersonnel and counterbattery tasks against hostile artillery.36\n\nFortification and Defensive Tactics\n\nThe use of deliberate fortifications during the American Revolution was fairly common in the Northern theater but seldom used in the Southern Campaign. This discussion will focus principally on temporary field works, generally a trench line with a sloped earth curtain, redans, redoubts and lunettes (see selected glossary). When time permitted, more elaborate features like abatis (obstacle of felled trees with sharpened branches facing the enemy) and chevaux-de-frise (a defense of timber or iron barrel with spikes and often strung with barbed wire) were added to slow and canalize enemy assault columns.\n\nWhen properly integrated together, field works were intended to protect friendly troops and artillery from enemy fire, while also hindering the enemy’s ability to penetrate into the depth of the defenses.\n\nWhen possible, field works incorporated favorable terrain and were laid out for mutual support with interlocking fields of fire. Especially when reinforced with fascines (rough bundle used to strengthen a structure) and gabions (similar to modern Hesco barriers), earthen fortifications could absorb considerable bombardment before collapse, allowing the defensive force to inflict disproportionally heavy casualties on an attacking infantry force.\n\n36 McKenney, The Organizational History of the Field Artillery, 1775–2003, 11–12.\n\n16\n\nTactics in the Southern Campaign\n\nThe tactical offensive was the preferred form of operations during the American Revolution, and commanders would generally assume a defensive posture for economy of force reasons, either an area defense to deny the enemy access to terrain, or in a point defense role to protect an installation or town. Tactics were often unconventional, dictated by the types of units and equipment and logistics support available, and further influenced by physical and human terrain in the Carolinas: 1. British units abandoned the conventional three-line deployment in favor of a two-line combat deployment used by the Continental Army, which allowed the regiment to cover a greater front.\n\n2. Regiments were deployed in looser formations, with more space between individual soldiers, in adaptation to the denser terrain of the South.\n\n3. Due to their chronic shortage of heavy infantry, British light infantry and grenadier were often employed as conventional infantry.\n\n4. Field guns were not often used in the field; when available, they were kept in general support under the direct command of the senior commander on the field.\n\n5. Riflemen were used to attrite enemy commanders and crew-served weapon systems.\n\n6. Riflemen, dragoons, and infantry were routinely task organized for mutual support.\n\n7. Out of necessity, the American army had to use militia and state troops in an offensive role.\n\n8. Greene maintained a strategic defensive posture but assumed a tactical offensive posture through local attacks to keep the British off-balance. Cornwallis followed the “best defense is a good offense” approach and would aggressively attack any Continental unit within striking distance of his regulars.\n\nLOGISTICS\n\nEach side operated with a significant set of logistics constraints that shaped the course of the campaign. At the strategic level, Great Britain had a well-organized system to move supplies and ordnance stores from England to ports in South Carolina. At the operational and tactical level, frictions and inefficiencies (in the form of poor roads and insurgent attacks) hindered the British distribution of supplies and reinforcements from ports to forward operating bases (FOBs) like Ninety Six and Camden. Frustrated with his lumbering supply trains during his pursuit of Greene, Cornwallis burned all nonessential wagons and supplies and attempted to live off the land—a decision that led his troops and horses to the brink of starvation in the weeks before the Battle of Guilford Courthouse.\n\nAfterward, Cornwallis bitterly realized his disregard for sound logistics arrangements had forced his command beyond its logistical culmination point. As a consequence, he had to cede the initiative to Greene after Guilford Courthouse and withdraw his command to refit—leaving Greene’s army effectively in control of all but the coastal ports of the Carolinas. By contrast, Greene’s close attention to logistics matters, both friendly and enemy, ultimately paved the way to a decisive strategic victory in the Southern Campaign. Thus, a good understanding of the logistical systems and methods used by both sides is vital to understanding why the Southern Campaign unfolded as it did.\n\nStrategic Logistics\n\nAt the beginning of the war, the Americans were at a severe disadvantage to Great Britain, with Congress and the state governments having to cobble together a national logistics system from 17\n\nscratch. The Second Continental Congress had the notional responsibility for arming, equipping, and supplying Continental forces in the field. In reality, Congress had little financial or political power to dictate logistics priorities to the states, so most logistics support for American units came from the state governments. Congress took the first step to reform the Continental Army logistics system by creating a commissary general, quartermaster general, and commissary of artillery. Primarily concerned with strategic logistics, this embryonic Continental staff also provided assistance to their counterparts in the geographical departments and field armies. In terms of a strategic industrial base in America, most goods of military value were produced by local, private entrepreneurs.\n\nAny controls or priorities placed on these businesses were imposed by state governments, which were also principally responsible for raising and equipping their own militia organizations and Continental Army regiments recruited from within the state. Many of the various types of supply\n\n—food, for example—had to be sought out and purchased directly from the producer by a purchasing agent. Both the states and the Continental departmental quartermasters employed purchasing agents to acquire goods and materials to support their respective units, creating competition for scarce goods that inflated prices. Speculation and fraud ran rampant, and much time and energy was spent by government officials attempting to curb these problems. Adding to these headaches was the fact that Continental paper money, not backed by a system of taxation or currency reserves, was rapidly devalued, which made the challenge of acquiring supplies even more problematic. By 1781, American quartermasters lacked money and specie, and so had to impress provisions and livestock from private owners, in exchange for a receipt for later payment—but only if the owner could prove their loyalty.\n\nEffective in the short term to alleviate supply shortages, such strong-arm tactics carried the risk of damaging civilian support for the Continental war effort.\n\nA particularly acute problem for the rebellious colonies was obtaining weapons and ordnance stores, as no large-scale manufacturing capability existed in America. Working through a network of secret agents, Congress gained covert support from the French and Spanish governments, who saw the opportunity to hurt the English by extending support to the rebels. The trickle of smuggled aid turned into large shipments of war materiel after the American victory at Saratoga in 1777, which convinced France to declare war on England. By the end of the war, more than 100,000 muskets and bayonets, more than 200 cannon, and many tons of ordnance stores had been delivered to the Americans from French and Spanish arsenals—all purchased on credit extended by the French monarchy.37\n\nCompared to that of the new American nation, the British strategic logistical system was well established, roles and responsibilities were delineated, and the whole was backed by a robust financing system. That did not mean the system was efficient, but by almost any measure the British system was significantly better than the American system. On the plus side, Britain had more than a century of experience mounting expeditionary operations and had a well-developed network of arsenals, factories, and depots capable of producing large quantities of supplies and equipment to sustain an expeditionary army in North America. Furthermore, the Royal Navy was powerful enough to ensure the movement of supplies to the British Army’s overseas field forces would at least reach the North American seaports without serious interference by enemy vessels.\n\nTo oversee provisioning in North America, the Treasury Board commissioned a civilian commissary general of provisions to work for each commander in chief. The commissary general was seconded by a military deputy and supported by a small staff of civilian employees. The commissary general department had the responsibility to inspect and verify delivery of provisions for troops and 37 Larrie D. Ferreiro, Brothers at Arms: American Independence and the Men of France and Spain Who Saved It (New York: Knopf, 2016), 335.\n\n18\n\nlivestock. Duties ranged from overseeing contractors, inspecting and verifying delivery of goods, and settling accounts with vendors. Although subject to directives from the Treasury Board, the commissary general for America received their day-to-day orders from the commander in chief, Lieutenant General Clinton.\n\nThe logistics process began in the British Isles, where provisions and military stores ordered by the commissary general were collected from factories, depots, and suppliers and loaded on chartered merchant ships at the Irish port of Cork. After a convoy across the Atlantic Ocean, the transports unloaded at regional depots, principally Charleston, South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia. Every year during the war, some 400 ships were required to move the necessary supplies and reinforcements from Great Britain. Assuming the supplies shipped from England were not spoiled or destroyed in transit, port quartermasters had to receive, store, and distribute the supplies across a considerable distance on unimproved roads, all while under constant threat of rebel attack. As the British did not have a dedicated quartermaster corps to manage the entire supply chain, civilian agents coordinated the purchase of transportation, storage, and distribution facilities, while accounting and safeguarding thousands of pounds worth of property and supplies.\n\nOrdnance stores, quartermaster supplies, and replacement equipment and uniforms only formed a small portion of the cargo shipped from Great Britain. Instead, the largest portion of the cargo consisted of consumable items for the soldiers: principally pork and beef, wheat flour and hard bread, and butter and salt, but also including other foodstuffs like oatmeal, peas, cheese, bacon, fish, raisins, and molasses. Scurvy, brought on by a lack of vitamin C, was a perennial problem, especially during the winter months, so soldiers were given large quantities of spruce beer, vinegar, and sauerkraut.\n\nWhen in season, fresh vegetables were shipped as well, but their issuance was intended only for hospital patients, as healthy soldiers were expected to obtain or raise their own produce.\n\nBritish Operational and Tactical Logistics\n\nFollowing the successful capture of Charleston in May 1780, Clinton designated Commissary General Nisbet Balfour as the military commandant for the Charleston port and garrison. Besides directing the defenses of the port, Balfour was responsible for safely distributing supplies and reinforcements to field magazines at Camden and Ninety Six in South Carolina and the base at Augusta, Georgia.\n\nBalfour was assisted by a commissary of captures, who safeguarded Loyalist property in addition to collecting and repurposing provisions, cattle, and property seized from the king’s enemies. Repeated insurgent attacks on the British lines of communication across South Carolina required the diversion of many regular troops for security tasks. Finally, to ensure Cornwallis’s army had sufficient supplies to support the next phase of the offensive, British quartermasters had to carefully synchronize the stockpiling of supplies t"
