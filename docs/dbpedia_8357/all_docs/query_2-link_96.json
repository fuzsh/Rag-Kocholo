        "text": "Julian Fawcett is the trouser-less ghost of a Conservative MP who died at Button House in 1993. He has the ability to move objects slightly, which he used to try and scare Alison by pushing her out of the window which granted her the ability to see and communicate with the ghosts.\n\nBiography[]\n\nHistory[]\n\nJulian was born on May 9, 1945, to a wealthy family; his mother was a \"humble greengrocer's daughter\" who had a \"national chain of stores that went on to become Britain's biggest supermarket brand\" and his father was a \"humble ear and nose surgeon at London's largest private hospital\".[4] He attended Harrow School where he claims he was confident and not nervous at all on his first day. His family also had 4 other homes besides the one they lived their daily lives in.\n\nJulian was studying at the University of Cambridge in July 1969, during the first Apollo Moon Landing and said that he was experiencing his own Moon Landing (referring to his first threesome) and missed the real one.\n\nDuring his time as an MP, Julian was confident and quite sleazy about himself and acted a bit egocentric, while also lobbying against an animal welfare bill. In one of the news articles, Julian finds on the internet after he died, he is shown walking a beagle, presumably his own. Julian was attending a fundraiser at Button House when he died, while having sex with another politician called Lindsay; he died of what Lindsay believed was a heart attack mid-intercourse[2] after drinking Champagne earlier that day.[5] Before his death, he had cheated on his wife on many other occasions which mean he hardly saw her or his daughter. When he died, his daughter, Rachel, was 4 and during his time alive, he didn't spend one Christmas with her. Rachel, was born in 1988.[6]\n\nIn 1990, he was suspended from the Commons for something unknown and wrote an article on some car reviews.[7]\n\nWhen died, he searched up his name on Google, he found many articles on how he had died in a 'sex scandal' and when he asked Alison about it, he said 'you mean every person on the planet just think of me as the weirdo MP who died in some sex scandal?' to which Alison replied 'Wait, that was you?' He was clearly embarrassed by this as he denied this fact after Alison asked. One of the articles Julian finds online says \"Outspoken Tory MP Julian Fawcett was found dead in a Country Estate Button House last Monday. First reports claim that he was in the middle of a tryst with suspected girlfriend...\" Another reads \"[Julian] Fawcett MP was pronounced dead this morning, 18th March, by the local coroner who [...] called to Button House in the early hours by the police after an anonymous tip.\"\n\nAt the time of his death, he had some other, implied to be illegitimate, children.[3]\n\nHis autopsy, which occurred on 21 March 1993 at 09:30am, revealed that he had a \"yellow, pallid, enlarged, hardened, fatty\" liver and an \"enlarged, dilated\" heart with \"evidence of local necrosis\" and that he died from \"myocardial infarction\" caused by \"a combination of substance abuse and sudden exertion\".[8]\n\nDeath[]\n\nJulian found his first day as a ghost very stressful. He was confused when he saw his own body being taken away, and the fact that he could walk through walls. We see this in 'A Lot To Take In'. His first reaction to meeting the other ghosts was fainting, which caused Robin to cheer \"New guy!\". He was also perplexed as to why he couldn't leave the house when he tried over 100 times (Robin counted how many times Julian tried on his first day). Julian didn't want to be dead yet, so he tried denying it, forcing himself to think that this is some sort of prank or dream, but after seeing how real Humphrey's talking severed head looked, he had to embrace the fact that he was dead, he had to now \"live\" with it. At the end of the episode, we see that Julian has finally made his peace with being a ghost. He announces to the other ghosts that he is a dead, to which they all clap for him and congratulate him.\n\nHe is the first ghost that Alison notices after her return from hospital.\n\nAt one point, he boasted about getting a luxurious house using parliamentary expenses, then immediately asserts that builders are all thieves.\n\nHe likes to prank the living, partly because his special power -being able to move things- lends itself to it and partly because that's just the way he is, he gets bored easily. It may also be partly because he had been drinking champagne at the time of his death and as Thomas points out,[5] he is therefore always mildly \"tipsy\".\n\nOf all the other ghosts, he appears to be closest friends with Robin, playing chess with him on most occasions. When Julian died, Robin was the one who helped him most to feel at home. This could either be because Robin is the oldest ghost so has seen many come and go and would like everyone to feel welcome, or it just simply be because he wanted to be friends with Julian.\n\nQuotes[]\n\n\"Actually known as a Moroccan tea party\" (Who Do You Think You Are)\n\n\"Just a couple of chaps in the library.\" (Happy Death Day)\n\n\"Never did like cornflakes.\" (Free Pass)\n\n\"It's not about the cheese! It's about the fun!\" (Getting Out)\n\n\"Order, Ordaaaahhhh!\" (About Last Night)\n\n\"Are you on drugs?\" (Redding Weddy)\n\n\"Well close the door then. I've had a hell of a day\" (Bump In The Night)\n\n\"Pinch on the bum, no harm done!\" (Perfect Day)\n\n“Peepeepoopoo” (Redding Weddy)\n\nPowers[]\n\nJulian has a special ability - an ability that the other ghosts are actually jealous of - he is able to touch and move things in the real world. However, this power does have a down side, it is very difficult for him to move stuff so does it sparingly. The other ghosts don't seem to realize how much of an effort this is for him as then consistently ask him to use his powers.\n\nHe uses this power malevolently in the first episode, where he pushes Alison out of the window while she's leaning out.\n\nBy the third season, Julian seems to have practiced his power enough to apply it consistently in small ways without it being too much of a difficulty. For example, he presses buttons such as those on the TV remote control and Mike's laptop computer.\n\nInspiration[]\n\nAccording to the website IMDb, Julian is based around the politician Stephen Milligan, his demise and the scandal that followed[9]\n\nGallery[]\n\nPromos[]\n\nScreenshots[]"
