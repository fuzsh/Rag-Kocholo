In this beautifully produced book, art historian Childs (Art, University of Maryland, College Park) explores Humphrey&#39;s life and career as an artist, and examines how Humphrey&#39;s art transformed her experiences growing up as an African American woman into narratives that speak to the human spirit. The more than 45 stunning color plates that accompany the text range from Humphrey&#39;s early abstract art through her groundbreaking lithographs in the figurative narrative style.
