        "text": "Allen Jenkins has one of those mugs and voices that is instantly recognizable the second he’s on screen and opens his mouth. He’s never the lead, or even the major second lead, but he’s always there to provide ample support. My first introduction to Allen Jenkins was in his numerous appearances on I Love Lucy, often as a police officer. His most memorable appearance was in a late second season episode, “Ricky and Fred Are TV Fans.” In this episode, Lucy and Ethel are upset about becoming boxing widows when Ricky and Fred settle in for the evening to watch “the big fight.” It is established that Ricky and Fred have spent a lot of evenings watching boxing on television and their wives are fed up with being ignored night after night. Lucy and Ethel decide to go down to the corner drug store and call Ricky on the phone. Lucy will disguise herself as one of her friends and ask Ricky to call Lucy to the phone, which should clue him in that Lucy and Ethel are gone. The plan doesn’t work however, as Ricky just answers the phone, calls Lucy to the phone, sets the receiver down, then returns to watching the fight. The entire crowd in the drug store is caught up in the fight, including Officer Jenkins (Allen Jenkins). Lucy unable to get the drugstore clerk’s attention (because he’s watching the fight on television), decides to make change for herself. The bell on the cash register gets Officer Jenkins’ attention and he accuses Lucy of trying to rob the drug store. Lucy and Ethel get away.\n\nLater, Lucy and Ethel return to the Ricardos’ apartment only to see the phone still off the hook and Ricky and Fred still watching the fight–they didn’t even notice the women’s disappearance. Insulted, Lucy decides to climb up onto the roof to cut the electricity to the Ricardos’ apartment. It seems a little drastic, and she has no fear about being electrocuted, but that’s how Lucy works, she doesn’t screw around. Anyway, while Lucy and Ethel discuss which cord is running to the Ricardos’ apartment, Officer Jenkins finds them and brings them down to the precinct. Now at the police station, Officer Jenkins tells his superior, Officer Nelson (Frank Nelson), that he’s finally tracked down the infamous female robbers, “Pickpocket Pearl” and “Sticky Fingers Sal.” The women are identified based on their hair color. ‘Pearl’ is a blonde and ‘Sticky Fingers’ is a brunette, who must have dyed her hair red, deduces Officer Nelson.\n\nLUCY: Dyed your hair. A lot you know. My hair is naturally red. Isn’t it Ethel?\n\nETHEL: Look Lucy, let’s not add perjury to our other charges.\n\nLUCY: Well I might have expected something like that from you. Pick. Pocket. Pearl.\n\nLucille Ball as “Lucy Ricardo” and Vivian Vance as “Ethel Mertz” in “Ricky and Fred Are TV Fans” in I Love Lucy. Originally aired June 22, 1953.\n\nAllen Jenkins went all the way back to 1939 with Lucille Ball when he appeared with her in the RKO film, Five Came Back. In the film, nine passengers board a flight from Los Angeles to Panama City. During the flight, the plane flies directly into an intense nighttime storm, which ends with the plane crashing into a rainforest. The passengers and crew survive. Eventually the plane is repaired, but can now only support the weight of five passengers. The passengers and crew must decide which five people will get to return home. Lucy plays Peggy Nolan, a woman with a shady past and Allen plays Pete, a gunman who is tasked with escorting the son of a gangster back home.\n\nEight years prior to Five Came Back, Allen had made his film debut in the 1931 short film, Straight and Narrow playing what else? An ex-convict. Allen played many unsavory characters throughout his career. He also appeared in many memorable pre-code films such as: Three on a Match (1932), Employees’ Entrance (1933), 42nd Street (1933), Blondie Johnson (1933), and Jimmy the Gent (1934). During the production code era, he played opposite big Warner Brothers stars like Errol Flynn (The Perfect Specimen (1937), Footsteps in the Dark (1941), and Dive Bomber (1941)) and Humphrey Bogart (Marked Woman (1938), Dead End (1937), and The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse (1938) ).\n\nJenkins was born on April 9, 1900 in Staten Island, New York. Despite often being cast as the dimwitted thug or comic relief, Jenkins actually had a long pedigree when it came to show business training. His family earned their living in show business and he later trained at the reputable American Academy of Dramatic Arts. In the 1920s, Jenkins was working steadily on Broadway, even replacing Spencer Tracy in the play, “The Last Mile.” Jenkins’ turn in Tracy’s role is what led to Darryl F. Zanuck discovering him and bringing him out to Hollywood to work for Paramount Pictures. His first major role was reprising his Broadway role of “Frankie Wells” in the 1932 film adaptation of Blessed Event, starring Lee Tracy. This role led to Jenkins receiving steady work, often in gangster films throughout the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nIn Ball of Fire, Jenkins has a memorable role as the garbage man who rattles off one slang word after another, much to the bewilderment of the professors who are trying to write a comprehensive encyclopedia on American slang. He would later reprise his role in the film’s 1948 remake, A Song is Born.\n\nGARBAGE MAN: I could use a bundle of scratch right now on account of I met me a mouse last week.\n\nPROFESSOR ODDLY: Mouse?\n\nGARBAGE MAN: What a pair of gams. A little in, a little out, and a little more out.\n\nPROFESSOR BERTRAM POTTS: I am still completely mystified.\n\nGARBAGE MAN: Well, with this dish on me hands and them giving away 25 smackaroos on that quizzola.\n\nPROFESSOR BERTRAM POTTS: Smackaroos?\n\nPROFESSOR ODDLY: Smackaroos? What are smackaroos?\n\nGARBAGE MAN: A smackaroo is a…\n\nPROFESSOR BERTRAM POTTS: No such word exists.\n\nGARBAGE MAN: Oh, it don’t, huh? A smackaroo is a dollar, pal.\n\nPROFESSOR BERTRAM POTTS: Well, the accepted vulgarism for a dollar is a buck.\n\nGARBAGE MAN: The accepted vulgarism for a smackaroo is a dollar. That goes for a banger, a fish, a buck, or a rug.\n\nPROFESSOR BERTRAM POTTS: Well, what about the mouse?\n\nGARBAGE MAN: The mouse is a dish. That’s what I need the moolah for.\n\nPROFESSOR ODDLY: Moolah?\n\nGARBAGE MAN: Yeah. The dough. We’ll be stepping. Me and the smooch, I mean the dish. I mean the mouse. You know, hit the jiggles for a little drum boogie.\n\nAllen Jenkins as “Garbage Man,” Richard Hadyn as “Professor Oddly” and Gary Cooper as “Professor Bertram Potts” in “Ball of Fire” (1941).\n\nOne of Jenkins’ last film roles was as the elevator operator who takes pity on the perpetually hungover Thelma Ritter in Pillow Talk (1959). Later, he moved to television, where he often played cops, or characters in blue-collared jobs. Aside from I Love Lucy, Jenkins also appeared in Adam 12, Bewitched, Batman, and The Man From U.N.C.L.E. He also made frequent appearances on Red Skelton’s show, The Red Skelton Hour, and also had a role in the 1950s sitcom, Hey Jeannie! (1956-1957). He is also remembered for voicing Officer Dribble on the cartoon series, Top Cat (1961-1962).\n\nAllen Jenkins passed away on July 20, 1974 from lung cancer at the age of 74.\n\nHUNK: Maybe I’m wrong. We all make mistakes, boss. That’s why they put the rubber on the ends of pencils.\n\nAllen Jenkins as “Hunk” to Humphrey Bogart in Dead End, 1937.\n\nOnce again I’ve fallen off the posting train. I need to make it more of a habit, but I struggle to find time. Then, I had trouble with my WordPress account and I couldn’t post. I finally got that fixed. I didn’t want to miss posting on National Classic Movie Day. I also plan to post about the late, great Doris Day soon.\n\nFor this year’s National Classic Movie Day, the Classic Film and TV Cafe are asking participants to post his or her top 5 favorite films from the 1950s.\n\nWithout further adieu, here are mine:\n\nThe Long, Long Trailer (1954)\n\nThis is my absolute favorite movie of all time. I have probably seen it a hundred times (no exaggeration). I’m a big fan of I Love Lucy and Lucille Ball. The Long, Long Trailer is basically a 90-minute I Love Lucy episode. Ball and Desi Arnaz’ (aka Lucy and Ricky Ricardo on I Love Lucy) character’s first names in ‘Trailer’ are very similar to those of their Ricardo counterparts– Tacy and Nicky, respectively. This MGM comedy is hilarious and I never tire of it, even though I’m at the point where I can recite the dialogue. Quotes from this film regularly make it into everyday conversations I have with friends and family (only those who have seen this film of course). My favorite quote to use, while driving, is “Turn right here, left.”\n\nThe Long, Long Trailer tells the story of Tacy and Nicky Collini, newlyweds who are embarking on a road-trip for their honeymoon: Los Angeles to Colorado. The Collinis decide to purchase a 40′ New Moon trailer for their journey. The film depicts the Collinis trying to handle trailer life and all the trials and tribulations that come with it: noisy trailer parks, parking on uneven surfaces, getting stuck in the mud, spending the night on a noisy highway, weight limits, cooking, parking, backing in, and more. Will the newlyweds’ marriage survive the trip?\n\nMy favorite part of the movie is when Tacy and Nicky decide to go off-roading and end up stuck in the mud. The trailer is all whopperjawed. Tacy and Nicky get through dinner and go to bed. Nicky is on the downhill side. He has no issues getting into bed. Tacy on the other hand, is on the uphill side and can’t stay in bed. One may ask why she doesn’t make her husband move over and she can share his bed. Well that would be the logical solution, but since this is Lucy, that isn’t going to happen. After a couple of feeble attempts to get into bed, the jack holding the trailer up (kind of) collapses in the mud and Tacy goes flying out the door. Nicky, awoken by his wife’s blood-curdling scream, comes to the door and says: “What’s the matter honey? Can’t you sleep?” While sitting in a 5′ deep mud puddle, Tacy gives him a look that could only convey “[expletive] you.”\n\nGidget (1959)\n\nI’ve mentioned Gidget many times on this blog, but it’s worth mentioning again. I love this movie. I’ve seen it dozens of times and I never tire of it. Sandra Dee is adorable. James Darren is hunky. The story is relatable. Gidget was the start of the 1950s-1960s teen surf movie craze and I’m all in for teen surf movies. Of all the teen surf movies (the ‘Beach Party’ films, For Those Who Think Young, Gidget Goes Hawaiian, etc.) the original Gidget film is the best.\n\nIn this coming of age story, Sandra Dee plays the titular character, Frances “Gidget” Lawrence, a seventeen year old tomboy who is uneasy about her girlfriends’ new hobby: manhunting. Frances is more interested in snorkeling than finding a boyfriend. Her friends on the other hand, act like they’ll be old maids if they aren’t “pinned” by the end of the summer aka the beginning of their senior year of high school. The girls (except Frances) try posturing and flaunting themselves in front of a group of male surfers, but fail to catch their attention. Frances clumsily tries to play along, but gets frustrated and goes snorkeling instead. Her friends ditch her. Frances, swimming in the ocean, gets stuck in kelp.\n\nIn the first of a couple kelp episodes, Frances is saved by one of the surfer boys, “Moondoggie,” played by James Darren. Frances is infatuated with him from the get-go. And frankly, who wouldn’t be? Frances is nicknamed “Gidget” by the boys (a portmanteau of “girl” and “midget”). She also takes an interest in surfing and is soon hanging out with the boys everyday. Her surfing skills steadily improve and pretty soon, she’s good enough to really “hang” with the boys. Throughout all the surfing scenes, Gidget and Moondoggie grow closer, culminating with a kiss at the luau. However, Gidget’s awkwardness threatens to keep them apart.\n\nMy favorite part of this film is probably Moondoggie serenading Gidget at the luau and planting the kiss on her. I also love the scene with the fight at Kahuna’s beach shack and the elderly neighbor’s witness statement to the police: “When I saw that other one (Moondoggie) run in there (the beach shack). I knew there’d be trouble. I can spot trouble through a crack in the blinds.”\n\nAll About Eve (1950)\n\nOne of the best known classics in Hollywood, I never tire of this film. The cast. The dialogue. The story. Everything about this film is perfect–except Thelma Ritter’s abrupt exit during the first half of the film. What happened to Birdie? She went to get the guest’s coat and never came back! This story is timeless, even in real life. No matter how great and indispensable you think you may be, there’s always someone waiting in the wings who is better than you are.\n\nAll About Eve begins at the Sarah Siddons Award ceremony. Rising star Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) is slated to receive the prestigious Sarah Siddons award, the highest honor given to persons in the theater community. As acerbic critic Addison DeWitt (George Sanders) introduces the cast of characters, us as the audience knows that there is a story behind Eve’s rise to stardom. Huge star Margo Channing (Bette Davis) looks like she wants to shoot Eve. The playwright Lloyd Richards (Hugh Marlowe) and director Bill Sampson (Gary Merrill) of Eve’s award-winning play do not look proud or happy in the slightest. Lloyd’s wife, Karen (Celeste Holm) takes over the narration and lets the audience in on the true story about Eve Harrington.\n\nOn a rainy night, after another performance of Margo’s hit play, “Aged in Wood,” Karen comes across Eve, a young woman she’s repeatedly spotted waiting outside the backstage exit. Thinking she’s doing the young woman a favor, Karen invites the young woman inside to meet her idol, Margo Channing. Little does Karen know what lurks ahead. As the story progresses, we see Eve slowly insinuate herself into Margo’s personal and professional life. Perhaps this is why Birdie disappears! Eve’s goal is to star in Lloyd’s next play, Footsteps on the Ceiling.\n\nWhat I love about this film is how slowly Eve’s scheme unfolds. It is not obvious that Eve is taking over Margo’s life. It’s only through the music, Birdie’s “I told you so” face, and Margo’s growing frustration that we figure out what Eve is doing. As Eve gets away with more and more, the more brazen she becomes–such as calling Lloyd to her apartment in the middle of the night. My favorite part of the film is Addison’s take-down of Eve and Eve’s comeuppance at the end when she meets #1 fan, Phoebe (Barbara Bates).\n\nPillow Talk (1959)\n\nStarring the recently departed Doris Day, this film is her first of three films with co-star Rock Hudson. Of their three films together, the others being Lover Come Back (1961) and Send Me No Flowers (1964), Pillow Talk is my favorite. I love the catchy theme song, Doris and Rock’s undeniable chemistry, Tony Randall, and Doris’ gorgeous wardrobe. The film is funny, romantic and a little sexy.\n\nIn Pillow Talk, Doris stars as Jan Morrow, an interior decorator. She’s a successful career woman who’s driven up the wall by the romantic escapades of her party line partner Brad Allen, played by Rock Hudson. Tony Randall portrays Jonathan Forbes, a mutual friend of Jan and Brad’s. Jan and Brad bicker constantly on the party line. Jan tries to offer a compromise over the use of the line, but Brad is unwilling to participate. Jan ends up (unsuccessfully) filing a complaint against Brad with the phone company.\n\nOne night, Brad and Jan just happen to be at the same nightclub. Brad sees her and learns her name, figuring out that she’s the one who he bickers with on the party line. He concocts the fake persona of “Rex Stetson” a Texas cattle rancher. Using a Texas drawl, Rex successfully picks up Jan and takes her home. Soon they are seeing each other regularly. Jan finds herself falling for “Rex.” Brad/Rex finds himself falling for Jan.\n\nMy favorite part of this film is watching 6’5 Rock Hudson try to squeeze himself into a tiny sports car, Jan’s maid Alma (Thelma Ritter) drinking Hudson under the table, and every scene with Tony Randall. He is hilarious. Pillow Talk set the pace for the sexy 1960s sex comedies. Watch 2003’s Down With Love (with Renee Zelwegger and Ewan McGregor) for a fun send-up of Pillow Talk and the other sex comedy tropes.\n\nRear Window (1954)\n\nThis is my favorite Hitchock film. Everything about this film is fantastic: the story, the dialogue, the cast, the sets, everything. I absolutely love the set of this film. Hitchcock’s courtyard set is amazing. The attention to detail is fantastic. I love how the other neighbors all have storylines, even though they never set foot in James Stewart’s apartment. Miss Torso, Miss Lonelyhearts, The Songwriter, all the neighbors are fantastic. The only fault in this film is the cheesy way the ending looks, but I’ll chalk that up to 1950s technology.\n\nIn Rear Window, James Stewart plays photographer LB “Jeff” Jeffries, who is homebound after breaking his leg. He is bored and spends most of his days watching the goings on of his neighbors in the courtyard. He devises names for the neighbors and keeps up on their lives. One neighbor in particular, Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), catches his attention. It seems that Thorwald had an invalid wife, until all of a sudden, he didn’t. Curious about what happened to Mrs. Thorwald, Jeff begins watching him more intently with a large telephoto lens.\n\nJeff sees Thorwald engaged in all kinds of suspicious activity and is determined that he was behind his wife’s disappearance. Using his binoculars and camera lenses, Jeff basically engages in a stakeout. Throughout all his investigation work, Jeff’s girlfriend, Lisa Fremont, played by Grace Kelly, and his nurse Stella, played by Thelma Ritter come and go. At first the ladies are dismissive of Jeff’s interest in Thorwald and his determination to prove him a murderer. However, after seeing Thorwald’s behavior first-hand, the ladies are hooked and soon join Jeff in his stakeout. Lisa and Stella become further involved in Jeff’s independent investigation when they leave the apartment to gather evidence from Thorwald’s garden and home.\n\nMy favorite part of this film is the scene with Jeff, Lisa and Stella watching Thorwald scrub his walls. “Must’ve splattered a lot,” Stella says matter of factly. Lisa and Jeff look at her disgusted. She then defends her position, saying “Come on. That’s what we’re all thinkin’. He killed her in there, now he has to clean up those stains before he leaves.” I also love Grace Kelly’s wardrobe. If there was ever an actress who epitomized Hollywood glamor, it’s Grace Kelly.\n\nAll About Eve, the showbiz drama to end all showbiz dramas, starts in the present time at an annual theater award banquet. Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter), the evening’s recipient of the most prestigious award–The Sarah Siddons Award (for distinguished achievement), is set to take the stage. The evening seems like a pleasant affair, but the narrator Addison DeWitt (George Sanders), quickly informs us that all is not what it seems. As Eve ascends the steps and is about to take the award from the presenter, the picture freezes. In a knowing and almost sarcastic tone, we are advised that we will “learn all about Eve” shortly. The film quickly segues into a flashback, where we, as the viewer, assume that we will be taken on a journey to find out how Eve earned herself the prized Sarah Siddons Award trophy. When I first saw this film, I knew that Eve had to have done something scandalous or nefarious to get there–and if you’re like me, this premonition will only hook you into wanting to take the ride to learn ALL ABOUT EVE.\n\nTrust me. It’s worth it. That Eve is a real piece of work.\n\nWe first meet Eve outside of a theater on a dreary evening in New York City. It is pouring outside and Eve, wearing a raincoat and bucket hat is huddled next to one of the side doors. She has just come from seeing her idol, Margo Channing (Bette Davis), perform in her latest play, “Aged in Wood.” Karen Richards (Celeste Holm), a friend of Margo’s and wife of the play’s author, Lloyd (Hugh Marlowe), spots Eve outside. Karen remarks to Eve that she’s seen her outside of the theater every evening after a performance. Eve (who at this point seems like a genuine, starstruck young woman), comments that she loves Margo Channing and has seen every performance of this play. She even remarks that she’d first seen Margo perform in San Francisco, where she became an instant fan. Karen invites Eve inside to meet her idol.\n\nThe wheels are in motion…\n\nInside the theater, we meet Margo and all of her other theater friends and colleagues. Aside from Karen and husband Lloyd, there’s Bill Sampson (Gary Merrill) (Margo’s boyfriend and director of the play) and Margo’s assistant Birdie (Thelma Ritter) (also a former vaudevillian). They’re laughing about an interview Margo gave and Karen introduces Eve to Margo and appeases to her ego by gushing over her. After prompting her to tell the group how she found Margo and ended up in New York City, Eve gives her first of many excellent performances. Eve tells a sob story about how she came from Milwaukee, WI and worked in a dead end career as a secretary in a brewery.\n\nEVE: “When you’re a secretary in a brewery, it’s pretty hard to make believe you’re anything else.”\n\nShe then discusses how she dabbled in theater in her town, but of course, Eve with her fake humility, says she was awful. It was at this theater where she met “Eddie” who was a radio technician, but was also in the Air Force. Then Eddie was sent into combat when “The War” came. Eve went back to work at the brewery and lived for Eddie’s once a week letters. She saved her vacation time and money to be able to meet Eddie in San Francisco for a vacation. Eddie never showed up. He was killed in combat. Now in San Francisco, Eve decided to look stay in town and look for work. One night, Margo Channing came to town to perform “Remembrance” at the Shubert Theater, which Eve attended, and ultimately led to her following Margo back to New York and brings us to the current events. The group is sympathetic to Eve’s story and instantly feel compassionate toward her plight. The only person who is not convinced is Birdie.\n\nBIRDIE: “What a story! Everything but the bloodhounds snappin’ at her rear end”\n\nAfter accompanying Margo and Bill to the airport so he can catch his flight to Hollywood, Eve ends up being invited to live in Margo’s home and work as her assistant. For awhile, Eve dotes on Margo and Margo is in bliss. However, Eve has an ulterior motive. By taking care of Margo and all her affairs for a few weeks, she can learn all there is to learn about Margo Channing and her friends and colleagues. At the theater, Margo catches Eve on the theater stage, modeling Margo’s costume and pretending to bow and accept applause from an invisible audience. When Eve realizes that she’s been caught, she has a look of terror on her face, but Margo chalks up Eve’s reaction to embarrassment and assumes that Eve’s actions are those of a wannabe theater actress.\n\nLater that evening, Margo receives a phone call at 3:00AM. Apparently, she had placed a call from New York to California at 12AM (Pacific Time) to wish Bill a Happy Birthday. Margo assumes that Eve placed the call on her behalf. It is apparent that Margo is confused and not sure if Eve’s intentions were pure or if there was some underlying motive. The next morning, Margo and Birdie discuss Eve and Birdie’s instinctive dislike of her.\n\nMARGO: She (Eve) thinks only of me, doesn’t she?\n\nBIRDIE: Well let’s say she thinks only about you, anyway.\n\nMARGO: How do you mean that?\n\nBIRDIE: I’ll tell you how: like…like she’s studying you, like you was a play or a book or a set of blueprints–how you walk, talk, eat, think, sleep…\n\nMARGO: I’m sure that’s flattering. There’s nothing wrong with it.\n\nMargo asks Eve about the phone call. Eve admits that she forgot to tell Margo about the phone call. She then nonchalantly mentions that she also sent a telegram to Bill for his birthday and smirks as she leaves and closes the door. The musical score then pops in with its wonderful shrieking violins and loud crescendos. This music is a continual theme and is heard throughout the film each time Eve does something else nefarious.\n\nFrom this point on, Eve’s behavior just gets more brazen as she works to take over Margo’s career. Some of the things she does:\n\nEve finds out Margo’s understudy is pregnant and under the guise of humility, manages to manipulate Karen into asking Max into giving the role of Margo’s understudy to her.\n\nMargo arrives late for an audition with another Addison DeWitt protegee, Miss Caswell (Marilyn Monroe). Eve, Margo’s understudy, auditions with Miss Caswell instead. She gives a brilliant performance (according to Addison). Later, after Margo feuds with Lloyd about Eve (and Lloyd vents to Karen), Karen decides to play a joke on Margo to teach her a lesson and cause her to miss a performance (and help out Eve at the same time). This will later backfire on Karen big time.\n\nEve goes on stage in Margo’s place and wins rave reviews. Just by “sheer coincidence,” Addison and all the other top theater critics in town just happened to be in the audience when Eve made her stage debut. Hmm. Isn’t that curious?\n\nHaving taken over Margo’s role, Eve tries to take over Margo’s boyfriend Bill, the director of “Footsteps on the Ceiling.” It doesn’t work. “Just score it as an incomplete forward pass,” he tells her. From here on, Bill is suspicious of Eve. Addison also witnesses Eve’s attempt to seduce Bill.\n\nEve then has a friend call Lloyd in the middle of the night to tell him that Eve is having some sort of emotional breakdown and that he needs to come over right away. He comes to her hotel. Eve then presents this as Lloyd leaving Karen in the middle of the night and coming to her. She is convinced that she will marry Lloyd and he will write plays and she’ll star in them.\n\nAddison, under the pretense to find out more about Eve’s background, states that he is going to write a column about her. Actually performing a fact-checking mission, Addison asks Eve about her backstory. He also does end up writing a column about his interview with Eve where he (and Eve) tear Margo apart.\n\nEve blackmails Karen into convincing Lloyd to give her the coveted role of Cora (the role written for Margo) in “Footsteps on the Ceiling.” Eve threatens to expose Karen’s scheme and how it caused Margo to miss the performance that allowed Eve to be “discovered.”\n\nMargo however, has the last laugh. During Bill’s welcome home party, already feeling irritated and upset with Eve, Margo introduces Eve to Addison, the acerbic theater critic who writes very blunt and sometimes scathing newspaper columns about the theater world. Margo knows that if there is anything to find out about Eve’s true intentions, Addison will find out.\n\nAt first Addison appears to have been taken in by Eve. He takes her under his wing (along with Miss Caswell) as a protegee. He’s present for her audition with Miss Caswell and he is present when Eve goes on in Margo’s place. It is assumed that he probably helped to arrange for all the local critics to be present. However, Addison catches on to Eve and works to expose her for the fraud and sociopath she really is (takes one to know one, right?).\n\nThen comes one of the best, most delicious scenes in the film. Eve, after all her backstabbing, lying, selfishness, etc. is finally exposed for the fraud she is and Addison uses her manipulation tactics against her. He exposes the fact that Eve didn’t leave Milwaukee willingly. She was having an affair with the boss and the boss’ wife had her husband followed by detectives. Eve and the boss’ affair wasn’t proven–but she was given $500 to get out of town. She never went to San Francisco. She used the $500 to go to New York. There was no Eddie. No Shubert Theater (it doesn’t even exist in San Francisco!). He exposes her real name. It’s not Eve. It’s Gertrude. She has parents whom she hasn’t seen or talked to for three years.\n\nThen Addison delivers the gut punch:\n\nADDISON: “That I should want you at all suddenly strikes me as the height of improbability. But that, in itself, is probably the reason. You’re an improbable person Eve and so am I. We have that in common. Also a contempt for humanity, an inability to love or be loved, insatiable ambition–and talent. We deserve each other.”\n\nAddison blackmails Eve and states that she now belongs to him. She has no choice but to acquiesce, otherwise, she’ll lose the theater career she worked so hard for (worked hard in a different way, but it was probably hard work nonetheless).\n\nBack in the present day, the screen unfreezes, and Eve accepts her award. She gives some fake praise to her “friends” and colleagues thanking them for helping her get the Sarah Siddons Award. After the ceremony, Margo gives Eve a pretty good burn and pretty much tells her exactly what she thinks of her. This is also one of my favorite parts of the movie.\n\nMARGO: “Nice speech, Eve. But I wouldn’t worry too much about your heart. You can always put that award where your heart ought to be.”\n\nYikes. You go, Margo.\n\nFinally, it’s karma’s turn.\n\nEve returns home from the ceremony to discover a young girl asleep in her room. The girl wakes, introduces herself as “Phoebe,” and informs Eve that she’s president of the “Eve Harrington Fan Club” at her high school. She idolizes Eve and wants to be a theater actress. Hmm… sound familiar? Phoebe continues to appeal to Eve’s ego and soon finds herself working as Eve’s assistant in the hotel room. Hmm… Addison quickly stops by to bring Eve back her award that she left in the back of the limo. Eve has Phoebe answer the door.\n\nADDISON (to Phoebe): “Hello there. Who are you?”\n\nPHOEBE: “Miss Harrington’s resting, Mr. DeWitt. She asked me to see who it was.”\n\nADDISON: “We won’t disturb her rest. It seems she left her award in the taxicab. Will you give it to her?”\n\n(Phoebe holds the award and looks at it with the awe of a stage struck fan girl. Addison knows this look)\n\nADDISON: “How do you know my name?”\n\nPHOEBE: “It’s a very famous name, Mr. DeWitt.”\n\nADDISON: “And what is your name?”\n\nPHOEBE: “Phoebe.”\n\nADDISON: “Phoebe?”\n\nPHOEBE: “I call myself Phoebe.”\n\nADDISON: “Why not? Tell me Phoebe, do you want some day to have an award like that of your own?”\n\nPHOEBE: “More than anything else in the world”\n\nADDISON: “Then you must ask Mrs. Harrington how to get one. Miss Harrington knows all about it.”\n\n(Addison closes the door with a smirk on his face, knowing the fate that awaits Eve).\n\nGame. Set. Match.\n\nPhoebe takes Eve’s award to the bedroom to pack it in Eve’s trunk (per Eve’s request) and spots Eve’s rhinestone studded cape draped across the trunk. She puts it on, grabs the award and practices accepting the award in Eve’s three-way mirror. In the closing scene, the mirror’s reflection shows a bunch of Phoebes. This is a very effective scene and provides the film’s motif: “There is always someone smarter, more attractive, funnier, etc. waiting in the wings.”\n\nUnrelated to Eve:\n\nWhat happens to Birdie? She goes to deliver the sable coat to the owner and never returns. One can assume that perhaps Eve was so efficient that Birdie wasn’t needed and lost her position. However, she appears to have been a good friend of Margo’s, so that seems unlikely. Thelma Ritter, where did you go?"
