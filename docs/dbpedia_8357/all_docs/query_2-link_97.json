        "text": "EXCERPT: I peeped through the small window in the Rose Room door, and saw Pippa holding a piece of paper up to an elderly audience of three. She pointed her finger to the edge of the canvas and swooped her hand down in a sweeping motion. When she had finished talking, she put down the paper, and it was then she waved and beckoned for me to go in.\n\nI shuffled in, feeling the eyes of the room on me and my pink pyjamas. I should have gone for my Sunday best slippers.\n\n'Lenni, hi!'\n\n'Hi, Pippa.'\n\n'What brings you here?'\n\nI struggled to think how to phrase exactly what had brought me here. A long dead man and his unequally loved sons. A fish. A priest. An itching to do anything other than mind white water rafting. . . None of those made enough sense to verbalize in front of a geriatric audience.\n\n'Fancy doing some painting?' she asked.\n\nI nodded.\n\n'Pull up a seat and I'll bring you some paper. The theme this week is stars.'\n\nI turned to find somewhere to sit and there she was. Sitting all alone on the table at the back. Her hair catching the sunlight and shining like a ten pence piece, her cardigan a deep shade of purple and her eyes set on the paper in front of her, on which she was sketching with a nubbin of charcoal. The mauve miscreant, the periwinkle perpetrator. The old lady who stole something from the bin.\n\n'It's you!' I said.\n\nShe looked up from her drawing and stared at me for the briefest of moments, letting me come into focus. Then, with recognition and delight, said, 'It's you!'\n\nABOUT 'THE ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF LENNI AND MARGOT': Life is short. No-one knows that better than seventeen year old Lenni living on the terminal ward. But as she is about to learn, it's not only what you make of life that matters, but who you share it with.\n\nDodging doctor's orders, she joins an art class where she bumps into fellow patient Margot, a rebel-hearted eighty three year old from the next ward. Their bond is instant as they realize that together they have lived an astonishing one hundred years.\n\nTo celebrate their shared century, they decide to paint their life stories: of growing old and staying young, of giving joy, of receiving kindness, of losing love, of finding the person who is everything.\n\nAs their extraordinary friendship deepens, it becomes vividly clear that life is not done with Lenni and Margot yet.\n\nMY THOUGHTS: \"Though my soul may set in darkness, it will rise in perfect light; I have loved the stars too fondly to be fearful of the night.” - Sarah Williams, The Old Astronomer to his Pupil.\n\nThe One Hundred Years of Lenni and Margot melted my heart. For a book about death and dying, it is full of love, life and joy. I cried buckets. I laughed - snorting coffee laughter.\n\nThe paintings of Lenni and Margot are accompanied by stories that provide snapshots of their lives. From Lenni we learn of her first and only kiss, her alcoholic mother, and the father she sends away. We learn of Margot's marriage, and her husband's abandonment of her following the death of their infant son; of Meena, the woman who saved her; of Humphrey who fostered Margot's love of the stars and which she passes on to Lenni. One of the most beautiful moments in this book for me was when Margot takes Lenni outside the hospital to look at the stars:\n\n'I find it so peaceful,' Margot told me after a while.\n\n'Me too.'\n\n'Do you know,' she said slowly, 'that the stars that we see the clearest are already dead?'\n\n'Well, that's depressing.' I took my hand from hers.\n\n'No,' she said gently, linking her arm through mine, 'it's not depressing, it's beautiful. They've been gone for who knows how long, but we can still see them. They live on.'\n\nThey live on.\n\nI am not going to say anything else about this wonderful book other than it you haven't yet read it, then please do. It is funny, and sad, and tragically beautiful. A book that is going on my 'forever' shelf. A book that contains lessons for us all, ones that most of us never knew we needed.\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\n#TheOneHundredYearsofLenniandMargot\n\nI: @itsmariannecronin @randomhouseuk\n\nT: @itsmcronin @RandomHouseUK\n\n#fivestarread #contemporaryfiction #deathanddying #sliceoflife\n\nTHE AUTHOR: Marianne was born in 1990 in Warwickshire, England.
