        "text": "The Mormon Tabernacle Choir took the top spot on Billboard Magazine's Traditional Classical Albums Arts list for 2012. The Orchestra at Temple Square took the No. 3 spot on the same list.\n\nThe choir and orchestra were also on four other Billboard year-end lists, including No. 3 and No. 9 on the Traditional Classical Albums list, for “Glory! Music of Rejoicing” and “This Is the Christ,” respectively; No 4 on the Traditional Classical Albums Imprint list; No. 5 on the Traditional Classical Albums Label; and No. 12 on the Classical Crossover Album for “Glad Christmas Tidings” featuring David Archuleta.\n\nBillboard's year-end charts are calculated using custom formulas that look at product sales, streaming music and radio play.\n\nIt was 10 years ago, in 2003, when the choir of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints formed its own recording label and struck a partnership with Deseret Book, according to a news release about the choir.\n\n“This designation is much deserved and reflects the masterful music that the choir and orchestra produce, both in concert and recordings,” Deseret Book CEO Sheri Dew stated in a news release. “It’s well known that Mack Wilberg is a musical genius, and this just further validates it.”\n\nAlso in 2012, the choir launched its own YouTube channel at youtube.com/MormonTabChoir, which reached 1 million views this week.\n\nOther Mormon artists are also enjoying success on Billboard’s lists.\n\nThis week, the Piano Guys were on the top spots in both the Classical Albums and New Age Albums chart. Also, violinist Lindsey Stirling was No. 2 on the Classical Albums chart."
