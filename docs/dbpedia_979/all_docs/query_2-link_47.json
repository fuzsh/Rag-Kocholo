        "text": "Away in a Manger\n\nChanges: There's nothing in the Bible about Jesus not crying, so I've changed what the little Lord Jesus did.\n\nAway in a manger, no crib for a bed,\n\nThe little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head.\n\nThe stars in the sky looked down where he lay,\n\nThe little Lord Jesus asleep in the hay.\n\nThe cattle are lowing, the baby awakes,\n\nBut little Lord Jesus no crying he makes an interest he takes.\n\nI love Thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky\n\nAnd stay by my side until morning is nigh.\n\nBe near me, Lord Jesus, I ask Thee to stay\n\nClose by me forever, and love me, I pray.\n\nBless all the dear children in thy tender care,\n\nAnd take us to heaven, to live with Thee there.\n\nWords: Verses 1 & 2 Unknown, Verse 3 attributed to John Thomas McFarland.\n\nGod Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen\n\nChanges: We don't know the weather condition the shepherds faced (and changing this also means the rather iffy rhyming of 'wind' with 'mind' and 'find' is no longer there.). There's also another ox...\n\nGod rest you merry, gentlemen,\n\nLet nothing you dismay.\n\nFor Jesus Christ our Saviour\n\nWas born on Christmas day,\n\nTo save us all from Satan's pow'r\n\nWhen we were gone astray;\n\nO tidings of comfort and joy,\n\nComfort and joy,\n\nO tidings of comfort and joy.\n\nFrom God our heavenly Father\n\nA blessed angel came.\n\nAnd unto certain shepherds\n\nBrought tidings of the same,\n\nHow that in Bethlehem was born\n\nThe Son of God by name:\n\nThe shepherds at those tidings\n\nRejoiced much in mind,\n\nAnd left their flocks a-feeding,\n\nIn tempest, storm, and wind, As joy was unconfined,\n\nAnd went to Bethlehem straightway\n\nThis blessed babe to find:\n\nBut when to Bethlehem they came,\n\nWhereat this infant lay\n\nThey found him in a manger,\n\nWhere oxen livestock feed on hay;\n\nHis mother Mary kneeling,\n\nUnto the Lord did pray:\n\nNow to the Lord sing praises,\n\nAll you within this place,\n\nAnd with true love and brotherhood\n\nEach other now embrace;\n\nThis holy tide of Christmas\n\nAll others doth deface:\n\nWords: English Traditional, 18th Century.\n\nGood Christian Men, Rejoice\n\nChanges: The 'Ox and ass' don't make an appearance until the 7th century. So I've updated the 1st verse with more accurate words.\n\nGood Christian men, rejoice\n\nWith heart and soul and voice;\n\nGive ye heed to what we say,\n\nJesus Christ is born today;\n\nOx and ass We must all before Him bow,\n\nAnd He is in the manger For He has come to save us now.\n\nChrist is born today;\n\nChrist is born today!\n\nGood Christian men, rejoice\n\nWith heart and soul and voice;\n\nNow ye hear of endless bliss,\n\nJesus Christ was born for this:\n\nHe hath opened heaven's door\n\nAnd man is blessed forever more.\n\nChrist was born for this;\n\nChrist was born for this!\n\nGood Christian men, rejoice\n\nWith heart and soul and voice;\n\nNow ye need not fear the grave,\n\nJesus Christ was born to save;\n\nCalls you one and calls you all\n\nTo gain His everlasting hall.\n\nChrist was born to save;\n\nChrist was born to save!\n\nWords: Heinrich Suso; translated into English by John M. Neale.\n\nI Saw Three Ships\n\nChanges: Where to start with this one?! Well, Bethlehem is about 50km (30 miles) from the sea and there's no big river in Bethlehem for anyone to sail up! I think we'll just have to let this carol go. It was basically a folk tune from the middle ages and might as well stay as one!\n\nI saw three ships come sailing in,\n\nOn Christmas day on Christmas day.\n\nI saw three ship come sailing in,\n\nOn Christmas Day in the morning.\n\nAnd what was in those ships all three?\n\nOn Christmas day on Christmas day.\n\nAnd what was in those ships all three?\n\nOn Christmas Day in the morning.\n\nOur Saviour Christ and His lady,\n\nOn Christmas day on Christmas day.\n\nOur Saviour Christ and His lady,\n\nOn Christmas Day in the morning.\n\nAnd where they sailed those ships all three?\n\nOn Christmas day on Christmas day.\n\nAnd where they sailed those ships all three?\n\nOn Christmas Day in the morning.\n\nAll they sailed in to Bethlehem,\n\nOn Christmas day on Christmas day.\n\nAll they sailed in to Bethlehem,\n\nOn Christmas Day in the morning.\n\nAnd all the bells on earth shall ring,\n\nOn Christmas day on Christmas day.\n\nAnd all the bells on earth shall ring,\n\nOn Christmas Day in the morning.\n\nAnd all the angels in heaven shall sing,\n\nOn Christmas day on Christmas day.\n\nAnd all the angels in heaven shall sing,\n\nOn Christmas Day in the morning.\n\nAnd all the souls on earth shall sing,\n\nOn Christmas day on Christmas day.\n\nAnd all the souls on earth shall sing,\n\nOn Christmas Day in the morning.\n\nAnd let us all rejoice again,\n\nOn Christmas day on Christmas day.\n\nAnd let us all rejoice again,\n\nOn Christmas Day in the morning.\n\nWords: Traditional\n\nIn the Bleak Midwinter\n\nChanges: This is actually my favourite carol, but I wanted it to be even better! The one definite change is in verse 2 swapping 'stable' for 'humble' as Jesus probably wasn't born in a stable. Jesus also probably wasn't born in the midwinter either. However 'In the mild late summer' or 'In the mid of Autumn' doesn't have quite the same ring to it, so we'll leave verse 2 as it is!\n\nIn the bleak midwinter,\n\nFrosty wind made moan;\n\nEarth stood hard as iron,\n\nWater like a stone.\n\nSnow had fallen, snow on snow,\n\nSnow on snow;\n\nIn the bleak midwinter,\n\nLong ago.\n\nOur God, heaven cannot hold Him,\n\nNor earth sustain,\n\nHeaven and earth shall flee away\n\nWhen He comes to reign.\n\nIn the bleak midwinter\n\nA stable humble-place sufficed\n\nThe Lord God Almighty,\n\nJesus Christ.\n\nAngels and archangels\n\nMay have gathered there,\n\nCherubim and seraphim\n\nThronged the air.\n\nBut His mother only,\n\nIn her maiden bliss,\n\nWorshipped the Beloved\n\nWith a kiss.\n\nWhat can I give Him,\n\nPoor as I am?\n\nIf I were a shepherd,\n\nI would bring a lamb.\n\nIf I were a wise man,\n\nI would do my part;\n\nYet what I can I give Him -\n\nGive my heart.\n\nWords: Christina G. Rossetti\n\nIt Came Upon the Midnight Clear\n\nChanges: There's nothing about angels having harps in the Bible. (We also don't know that it was at midnight, but it was dark when the shepherds saw the angels, that's close enough...)\n\nIt came upon the midnight clear, that glorious song of old,\n\nFrom angels bending near the earth, to touch their harps of gold, who sing their song so bold!\n\n'Peace on the earth, good will to men,' from heaven's all gracious King!\n\nThe world in solemn stillness lay, to hear the angels sing.\n\nStill through the cloven skies they come, with peaceful wings unfurled,\n\nAnd still their heavenly music floats, o'er all the weary world;\n\nAbove its sad and lowly plains, they bend on hovering wing.\n\nAnd ever o'er its Babel sounds, the blessed angels sing.\n\nYet with woes of sin and strife, the world has suffered long;\n\nBeneath the angel-strain have rolled two thousand years of wrong;\n\nAnd man, at war with man, hears not the love song which they bring:\n\nO hush the noise, ye men of strife, and hear the angels sing.\n\nAnd ye, beneath life's crushing load, whose forms are bending low,\n\nWho toil along the climbing way with painful steps and slow,\n\nLook now! for glad and golden hours come swiftly on the wing.\n\nO rest beside the weary road, and hear the angels sing!\n\nFor lo! the days are hastening on, by prophet bards foretold,\n\nWhen, with the ever-circling years, shall come the age of gold;\n\nWhen peace shall over all the earth its ancient splendors fling,\n\nAnd all the world give back the song which now the angels sing.\n\nWords: Edmund H. Sears, 1849.\n\nOnce, in Royal David's City\n\nChanges: Jesus probably wasn't born in a stable, so all the sheds and stables have been replaced with better options. We also delete ALL of verse three as it's Victorian moralising nonsense!\n\nOnce, in royal David's city,\n\nStood a lowly cattle shed humble sted,\n\nWhere a mother laid her baby\n\nIn a manger for His bed.\n\nMary was that mother mild,\n\nJesus Christ, her little child.\n\nHe came down to earth from heaven,\n\nWho is God and Lord of all,\n\nAnd His shelter was a stable so humble,\n\nAnd His cradle was a stall:\n\nWith the poor and meek and lowly\n\nLived on earth our Saviour holy.\n\nAnd through all His wondrous childhood\n\nHe would honour and obey,\n\nLove and watch the lowly mother\n\nIn whose gentle arms He lay.\n\nChristian children all should be\n\nMild, obedient, good as He.\n\nFor He is our childhood's pattern:\n\nDay by day like us He grew;\n\nHe was little, weak and helpless;\n\nTears and smiles like us He knew:\n\nAnd He feeleth for our sadness,\n\nAnd He shareth in our gladness.\n\nAnd our eyes at last shall see Him\n\nThrough His own redeeming love;\n\nFor that child, so dear and gentle,\n\nIs our Lord in heaven above;\n\nAnd He leads His children on\n\nTo the place where He is gone.\n\nNot in that poor lowly stable cradle,\n\nWith the oxen standing by,\n\nWe shall see Him, but in heaven,\n\nSet at God's right hand on high;\n\nWhen like stars His children crowned,\n\nAll in white shall wait around.\n\nWords: Cecil F. Alexander, 1848.\n\nSee, Amid the Winter's Snow\n\nChanges: Jesus probably wasn't born in the winter and there's no mention of snow in the Bible. This means the carol really needs a new title!\n\nSee, amid the winter's snow, the heav'nly show\n\nBorn for us on earth below,\n\nSee, the Lamb of God appears,\n\nPromised from eternal years.\n\nHail, thou ever-blessed morn!\n\nHail, redemption's happy dawn!\n\nSing through all Jerusalem:\n\nChrist is born in Bethlehem!\n\nLo, within a manger lies\n\nHe who built the starry skies,\n\nHe who throned in height sublime\n\nSits amid the cherubim.\n\nSay, ye holy shepherds, say,\n\nWhat your joyful news today;\n\nWherefore have ye left your sheep\n\nOn the lonely mountain steep?\n\n'As we watched at dead of night,\n\nLo, we saw a wondrous light:\n\nAngels singing, \"Peace on earth\"\n\nTold us of the Saviour's birth.'\n\nSacred Infant, all divine,\n\nWhat a tender love was Thine,\n\nThus to come from highest bliss\n\nDown to such a world as this!\n\nTeach, O teach us, holy Child,\n\nBy Thy face so meek and mild,\n\nTeach us to resemble Thee\n\nIn Thy sweet humility.\n\nWords: Edward Caswall\n\nThe First Noel\n\nChanges: Jesus probably wasn't born in the winter; there's nothing about the shepherds seeing the star (although you kind of need them to for all of verses two and three to work...) and we don't know there were three wise men. So multiple little changes needed in this one!\n\nThe first noel the angel did say\n\nWas to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;\n\nIn fields where they lay keeping their sheep,\n\nOn a cold winter's In the midst of the night that was so deep.\n\nNoel, noel, noel, noel,\n\nBorn is the King of Israel!\n\nThey looked up and saw a star\n\nShining in the east, beyond them far,\n\nAnd to the earth it gave great light,\n\nAnd so it continued both day and night.\n\nAnd by the light of that same star\n\nThree Some wise men came from country far;\n\nTo seek for a King was their intent,\n\nAnd to follow the star wherever it went.\n\nThis star drew nigh to the north-west;\n\nOver Bethlehem it took its rest,\n\nAnd there it did both stop and stay\n\nRight over the place where Jesus lay.\n\nThen entered in those wise men three with glee\n\nFull reverently upon their knee,\n\nAnd offered there in His presence\n\nTheir gold, and myrrh, and frankincense.\n\nThen let us all with one accord\n\nSing praises to our heavenly Lord,\n\nThat hath made heaven and earth of nought,\n\nAnd with His blood mankind hath bought.\n\nWords: English Traditional\n\nWe Three Kings\n\nChanges: The Bible doesn't give a number of the Magi or say that they were Kings. Another carol which really needs a new title!\n\n(All)\n\nWe three kings Wise Men of Orient are\n\nBearing gifts we traverse afar;\n\nField and fountain, moor and mountain\n\nFollowing yonder star.\n\nO Star of wonder star of night\n\nStar with royal beauty bright\n\nWestward leading still proceeding\n\nGuide us to thy perfect light.\n\n(Gaspar)\n\nBorn a king on Bethlehem plain.\n\nGold I bring, to crown him again.\n\nKing forever, ceasing never.\n\nOver us all to reign.\n\n(Melchior)\n\nFrankincense to offer have I.\n\nIncense owns a deity nigh.\n\nPrayer and praising, all men raising;\n\nWorship Him, God on high.\n\n(Balthazar)\n\nMyrrh is mine its bitter perfume\n\nBreathes a life of gathering gloom\n\nSorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying\n\nSealed in the stone cold tomb.\n\n(All)\n\nGlorious now behold Him arise,\n\nKing and God and sacrifice;\n\nAlleluia, alleluia,\n\nEarth to the heavens replies.\n\nWords and Music: John H. Hopkins,Jr., 1857\n\nWhat Child is This\n\nChanges: The Ox and Ass are back - so they need to go! But bonus points with this carol for the shepherds 'guarding' Jesus. This fits in with the 'Migdal Eder' birth theory.\n\nWhat child is this, who, laid to rest\n\nOn Mary's lap is sleeping:\n\nWhom angels greet with anthems sweet,\n\nWhile shepherds watch are keeping?\n\nThis, this is Christ the King,\n\nWhom shepherds guard and angels sing:\n\nHaste, haste, to bring Him praise,\n\nThe babe, the Son of Mary.\n\nWhy lies He in such mean estate,\n\nWhere ox and ass animals are feeding?\n\nGood Christians, fear, for sinners here\n\nThe silent Word is pleading.\n\nNails, spear shall pierce Him through,\n\nThe cross be borne for me, for you.\n\nHail, hail the Word made flesh,\n\nThe babe, the Son of Mary.\n\nSo bring Him incense, gold and myrrh,\n\nCome, peasant, king, to own Him;\n\nThe King of kings salvation brings,\n\nLet loving hearts enthrone Him.\n\nRaise, raise a song on high,\n\nThe virgin sings her lullaby.\n\nJoy, joy for Christ is born,\n\nThe babe, the Son of Mary.\n\nWords: William C. Dix, 1865"
