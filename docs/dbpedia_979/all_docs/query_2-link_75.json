In the bleak midwinter a\n\nstable place sufficed the Lord God Almighty,\n\nJesus Christ.\n\nAngels and archangels may have gathered\n\nthere, cherubim and seraphim thronged the air;\n\nbut his mother only, in her maiden bliss,\n\nworshiped the beloved with a kiss.\n\nWhat can I give him, poor as I am? If I were a\n\nshepherd, I would bring a lamb; if I were a\n\nWise Man, I would do my part; yet what I can\n\nI give him: give him my heart.\n\nIt Came Upon a Midnight Clear(Bb/F)\n\nIt came upon the midnight clear, that glorious\n\nsong of old, from angels bending near the\n\nearth, to touch their harps of gold: \"Peace on\n\nthe earth, good will to men, from heaven's all-\n\ngracious King.\" The world in solemn stillness\n\nlay, to hear the angels sing.\n\nStill through the cloven skies they come with\n\npeaceful wings unfurled, and still their heavenly\n\nmusic floats o'er all the weary world; above its\n\nsad and lowly plains, they bend on hovering\n\nwing, and ever o'er its Babel sounds the\n\nblessed angels sing.\n\nAnd ye, beneath life's crushing load, whose\n\nforms are bending low, who toil along the\n\nclimbing way with painful steps and slow,\n\nlook now! for glad and golden hours come\n\nswiftly on the wing. O rest beside the weary\n\nroad, and hear the angels sing!\n\nFor lo! the days are hastening on, by prophet\n\nseen of old, when with the ever-circling years\n\nshall come the time foretold when peace shall\n\nover all the earth its ancient splendors fling,\n\nand the whole world send back the song which\n\nnow the angels sing.\n\nJingle Bells(G/D)\n\nDashing through the snow in a one horse open\n\nsleigh, O'er the fields we go laughing all the\n\nway. Bells on bobtail sing making spirits bright,\n\nWhat fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song\n\ntonight. Refrain.\n\nRefrain: O, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the\n\nway; O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open\n\nsleigh.

Glory\n\nto God, all glory in the highest. Refrain.\n\nYea, Lord, we greet thee, born this happy\n\nmorning, Jesus, to thee be all glory given.\n\nWord of the Father, now in flesh appearing.\n\nRefrain.\n\nAdeste, fideles, laeti triumphantes; venite,\n\nvenite in Bethlehem. Natum videte Regem\n\nangelorum. Venite adoremus, venite\n\nadoremus, venite adoremus, Dominum.\n\nO Come, O Come, Emmanuel(Em/E)\n\nO come, O come, Emmanuel, and ransom\n\ncaptive Israel, that mourns in lonely exile\n\nhere until the Son of God appear.\n\nRefrain: Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall\n\ncome to thee, O Israel.\n\nO come, thou Wisdom from on high, and\n\norder all things far and nigh; to us the path\n\nof knowledge show and cause us in her ways\n\nto go. Refrain.\n\nO come, thou Dayspring, come and cheer our\n\nspirits by thine advent here; disperse the gloomy\n\nclouds of night, and death's dark shadows put\n\nto flight. Refrain.\n\nO come, Desire of nations bind all peoples in\n\none heart and mind. From dust thou brought us\n\nforth to life; deliver us from earthly strife. Refrain.\n\nO Holy Night(C/E)\n\nO holy night! the stars are brightly shining,\n\nIt is the night of the dear Savior's birth! Long\n\nlay the world in sin and error pining Till He\n\nappeared and the soul felt its worth. A thrill\n\nof hope the weary world rejoices, For yonder\n\nbreaks a new and glorious morn! Refrain.\n\nRefrain: Fall on your knees! O hear the angel\n\nvoices! O night divine, O night when Christ\n\nwas born. O night divine! O night, O night\n\ndivine!\n\nLed by the light of faith serenely beaming,\n\nWith glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.\n\nSo led by light of a star sweetly gleaming,\n\nHere came the wise men from out the Orient\n\nland. The King of Kings lay thus in lowly\n\nmanger, In all our trials born to be our friend.\n\nRefrain.\n\nTruly He taught us to love one another; His\n\nlaw is love and His gospel is peace. Chains\n\nshall He break, for the slave is our brother,\n\nAnd in His name all oppression shall cease.\n\nSweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise\n\nwe, Let all within us praise His holy name.\n\nRefrain.\n\nO Little Town of Bethlehem(F/A)\n\nO little town of Bethlehem, how still we see\n\nthee lie; above thy deep and dreamless sleep\n\nthe silent stars go by. Yet in thy dark streets\n\nshineth the everlasting light; the hopes and\n\nfears of all the years are met in thee tonight.\n\nFor Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all\n\nabove, while mortals sleep, the angels keep\n\ntheir watch of wondering love. O morning\n\nstars together, proclaim the holy birth, and\n\npraises sing to God the King, and peace to\n\nall on earth!\n\nHow silently, how silently, the wondrous gift\n\nis given; so God imparts to human hearts\n\nthe blessings of his heaven. No ear may\n\nhear his coming, but in this world of sin,\n\nwhere meek souls will receive him, still the\n\ndear Christ enters in.\n\nO holy Child of Bethlehem, descend to us,\n\nwe pray; cast out our sin, and enter in, be\n\nborn in us today. We hear the Christmas\n\nangels the great glad tidings tell; O come to\n\nus, abide with us, our Lord Emmanuel!\n\nSilent Night(Bb/F)\n\nSilent night, holy night, all is calm, all is bright\n\nround yon virgin mother and child. Holy infant,\n\nso tender and mild, sleep in heavenly peace,\n\nsleep in heavenly peace.\n\nSilent night, holy night, shepherds quake at the\n\nsight; glories stream from heaven afar, heavenly\n\nhosts sing Alleluia! Christ the Savior is born,\n\nChrist the Savior is born!\n\nSilent night, holy night, Son of God, love's pure\n\nlight; radiant beams from thy holy face with the\n\ndawn of redeeming grace, Jesus, Lord, at thy\n\nbirth, Jesus, Lord, at thy birth.\n\nSilent night, holy night, wondrous star, lend thy\n\nlight; with the angels let us sing, Alleluia to our\n\nKing; Christ the Savior is born, Christ the\n\nSavior is born!\n\nStille Nacht, heilige Nacht!

There's a star in the\n\nsky! There's a mother's deep prayer and a baby's\n\nlow cry! And the star rains its fire while the\n\nbeautiful sing, for the manger of Bethlehem\n\ncradles a King!\n\nThere's a tumult of joy o'er the wonderful birth,\n\nfor the virgin's sweet boy is the Lord of the earth.\n\nAy! the star rains rains its fire while the beautiful\n\nsing, for the manger of Bethlehem cradles a King!\n\nIn the light of that star lie the ages impearled; and\n\nthat song from afar has swept over the world.\n\nEvery hearth is aflame, and the beautiful sing in\n\nthe homes of the nations that Jesus is King!\n\nWe rejoice in the light, and we echo the song that\n\ncomes down through the night from the heavenly\n\nthrong. Ay! we shout to the lovely evangel they\n\nbring, and we greet in his cradle our Savior and\n\nKing!\n\nWe Three Kings(Em/B)\n\nWe three kings of Orient are; bearing gifts we\n\ntraverse afar, field and fountain, moor and\n\nmountain, following yonder star. Refrain.\n\nRefrain: O star of wonder, star of light, star with\n\nroyal beauty bright, westward leading, still\n\nproceeding, guide us to thy perfect light.\n\nBorn a King on Bethlehem's plain, gold I bring\n\nto crown him again, King forever, ceasing\n\nnever, over us all to reign. Refrain.\n\nFrankincense to offer have I; incense owns a\n\nDeity nigh; prayer and praising, voices raising,\n\nworshiping God on high. Refrain.\n\nMyrrh is mine; its bitter perfume breathes a life\n\nof gathering gloom; sorrowing, sighing, bleeding,\n\ndying, sealed in the stone-cold tomb. Refrain.\n\nGlorious now behold him arise; King and God\n\nand sacrifice: Alleluia, Alleluia, sounds through\n\nthe earth and skies. Refrain.\n\nWe Wish You a Merry Christmas(G/D)\n\nWe wish you a Merry Christmas, We wish you\n\na Merry Christmas, We wish you a Merry\n\nChristmas, And a happy New Year.

We won't go until we get some,\n\nWe won't go until we get some, We won't go until\n\nwe get some, So bring it right here.\n\nWe wish you a Merry Christmas, We wish you\n\na Merry Christmas, We wish you a Merry\n\nChristmas, And a happy New Year.\n\nWhat Child Is This?(Em/E)\n\nWhat child is this who, laid to rest, on Mary's lap\n\nis sleeping? Whom angels greet with anthems\n\nsweet, while shepherds watch are keeping?\n\nRefrain: This, this is Christ the King, whom\n\nshepherds guard and angels sing; haste, haste,\n\nto bring him laud, the babe, the son of Mary.\n\nWhy lies he in such mean estate where ox and\n\nass are feeding? Good Christians, fear, for sinners\n\nhere the silent Word is pleading. Refrain.\n\nSo bring him incense, gold, and myrrh, come,\n\npeasant, king, to own him; the King of kings\n\nsalvation brings, let loving hearts enthrone him.\n\nRefrain."
