        "text": "‘God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen’ is one of our favourite minor key Christmas carols, but what are the lyrics about and why don’t they all rhyme?\n\n‘God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen’ is one of the oldest Christmas carols there is, and one of the most popular. The carol originates from 16th-century England and the earliest known printed edition was published in 1760.\n\nIt has been known by different names throughout history, including ‘God Bless You, Merry Gentlemen’ and ‘God Rest Ye, Merry Christians’, and even makes an appearance in Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol, early on when Scrooge is terrifying carol singers with his foul temper.\n\nThe novel reads: “At the first sound of ‘God bless you, merry gentlemen! May nothing you dismay!’, Scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled in terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog and even more congenial frost.”\n\nRead more: 30 greatest Christmas carols of all time\n\nWhat are the full lyrics to ‘God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen’?\n\nGod rest ye merry gentlemen\n\nLet nothing you dismay\n\nFor Jesus Christ our Saviour\n\nWas born on Christmas Day\n\nTo save us all from Satan's pow'r\n\nWhen we were gone astray\n\nO tidings of comfort and joy\n\nComfort and joy\n\nO tidings of comfort and joy\n\nFrom God our Heavenly Father\n\nA blessed Angel came;\n\nAnd unto certain shepherds\n\nBrought tidings of the same,\n\nHow that in Bethlehem was born\n\nThe Son of God by Name.\n\nO tidings of comfort and joy,\n\nComfort and joy\n\nO tidings of comfort and joy\n\nThe shepherds at those tidings\n\nRejoiced much in mind,\n\nAnd left their flocks a-feeding\n\nIn tempest, storm and wind,\n\nAnd went to Bethlehem straightway\n\nThe Son of God to find.\n\nO tidings of comfort and joy,\n\nComfort and joy\n\nO tidings of comfort and joy\n\nBut when to Bethlehem they came,\n\nWhereat this infant lay,\n\nThey found Him in a manger,\n\nWhere oxen feed on hay;\n\nHis Mother Mary kneeling down,\n\nUnto the Lord did pray.\n\nO tidings of comfort and joy,\n\nComfort and joy\n\nO tidings of comfort and joy\n\nNow to the Lord sing praises,\n\nAll you within this place,\n\nAnd with true love and brotherhood\n\nEach other now embrace;\n\nThis holy tide of Christmas\n\nAll other doth efface.\n\nO tidings of comfort and joy,\n\nComfort and joy\n\nO tidings of comfort and joy.\n\nWhat is ‘God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen’ about?\n\nLike a lot of well-known Christmas carols, the lyrics (see below) of ‘God Rest Ye’ centre around the joy experienced at the news of Christ’s birth – all sung in a beautiful minor melody.\n\nBorn on Christmas Day, the Christ the Saviour will “save us all from Satan's power / When we were gone astray.”\n\nThe lyrics are wonderfully uplifting and it is indeed difficult to feel dismay with those wonderful “tidings of comfort and joy” the carol shares in abundance.\n\nRead more: Best Christmas carols in a minor key\n\nWhy don’t all the lyrics in ‘God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen’ rhyme?\n\nLast year, we noticed carol singers and vexed tweeters were taking to their keyboards to vent over the fact second and forth lines of the third verse of ‘God Rest Ye’ don’t rhyme exactly as they should.\n\nIt’s the carol’s sheer age that contributes to this.\n\nYou see, back in 16th-century England, some pronunciations were pretty different, owing to a Great Vowel Shift – a series of changes in pronunciation that affected the long vowels used in English – roughly during the 15th to 18th centuries.\n\nLong vowels shifted upwards; that is, a vowel that used to be pronounced in a lower place in the mouth would be pronounced in a different place, higher up in the mouth. ‘wind’ used to be pronounced ‘waind’, as in ‘find’; it had a longer vowel, which was pronounced in a lower place in the mouth to its modern pronunciation.\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary confirms this – that until a few hundred years ago, ‘waind’ used to be the normal English pronunciation for ‘wind’ when used in poetry.\n\nSo there you have it."
