        "text": "Visitors to the beautifully restored Sistine Chapel in Rome often are surprised to discover, as they turn their eyes to view the ceiling, that the seven Old Testament prophets alternately are spaced with five pagan Sibyls. Why should this be?\n\nActually, such prophesies from the ancient literature served to convince early Christians that even the pagan nations were anticipating the arrival of a Messiah. The text of the Iudicii Signum preserved in a parchment score from 10th century Spain records one such Sybelline prophesy: \"From Heaven shall come a king who shall reign forever, present in the flesh to judge the world. And here before the Lord all kings shall be made to stand ...\"\n\nSimilar prophesies were found in the Old Testament scriptures. For example, in Isaiah 9:6, we read \"for unto us a child is born, unto us a son I given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall be called wonderful, counsellor, the Mighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace.\" Isaiah's Messianic prophesy can be found in a sample of Jewish cantillation of the first century, which places us solidly in the earliest historical context. And it's worth hearing, because Jewish cantillation actually provides the formula for the earliest Christian singing, evolving over a few centuries into the various Christian chant traditions, such as Gregorian and Byzantine styles.\n\nThe Old Testament also provides an interesting insight into Jewish music in the service of God, the kind of music Jesus would have heard in the Temple. In Psalm 150, the faithful were encouraged to praise God with an assortment of instruments: the trumpet, psaltery, the harp, with timbrel and dance, stringed instruments, the organ (yes, they had organs in those days!), the \"loud\" and the \"high-sounding cymbals. Let everything that hath breath praise the Lord.\" Indeed, Jewish services were intense and emotional, a practice that ended with the destruction of the Temple in 79 CE.\n\nThe New Testament, however, has little to say about music, perhaps because early Christians were humble folk, practicing in secrecy during the long period of persecution, more concerned with the very survival of the new faith and still uncertain about the formalities of developing a ritual or form of worship service. No doubt there was singing, and perhaps even simple instrumental accompaniment, but whatever it was is lost to us in the obscure shadows of history.\n\nSixth century Gregorian chant (named after Pope Gregory, though it predates his time) is preserved largely through its continued use in the Roman Catholic Church and its various monastic communities, but its pure clean sound as heard today on CDs bears little resemblance to ancient performances by untrained amateur male choristers. Sung in Latin, \"Puer Natus est Nobis\" (\"for unto us a Boy is Born\") would have been an appropriate holiday selection.\n\nThe desire of the parishioners to participate more actively in Christmas church services through singing led to folk traditions and the evolution of hymns, and even musical theater pieces, performed in French churches. A medieval drama called \"The Play of Herod\" survives in primitive but legible score, with all roles indicated and modest instrumental accompaniment. The \"Play of St. Nicholas\" exists in several versions, all relating his good deeds and generosity to the poor. Our Santa Claus is a modern manifestation of this kindly saint.\n\nAmong the great composers who have enriched the classical styles of Christmas music we must list Giovanni Gabrieli, whose massive choral compositions often filled the cavernous interior of St. Mark's Cathedral in Venice. So, too, we must include the prolific Johann Sebastian Bach and his six Christmas cantatas; Frenchman Hector Berlioz's \"L'Enfance du Christ\"; Charles Camille Saint-Saens' \"Oratorio de Noel\"; and, of course, we would be remiss to ignore Georg Friedrich Handel's \"Messiah.\" Curiously, \"'Messiah' is unique among the 20 oratorios ... in being the only one which has any connection with the Christian religion.\" So said England's famous conductor, Sir Thomas Beecham.\n\nThe leaders of the Protestant Reformation placed greater emphasis on congregational singing and the composition of a vast collection of hymn tunes by many inspired religious and secular composers. A simple Christmas \"hymn\" tune familiar to us all can be traced back to the German composer Michael Praetorius in the early 17th century. He produced a substantial body of \"popular\" religious music, much of it based on Protestant hymn tunes. He is best remembered for one specific piece, the beautiful setting of \"Lo, How a Rose e're Blooming,\" a symbolic reference to the virgin birth.\n\nPerhaps the most beloved of all Christmas carols is \"Stille Nacht, Heilige Nacht,\" composed in 1818 by schoolmaster and organist Francis Xavier Gruber to a text by the Rev. Joseph Mohr. \"Silent Night\" was first performed in the Bavarian church of St. Nicholas near Salzburg, Austria, on Christmas Eve of that year. The church organ was in disrepair, so the congregation sang to a guitar accompaniment.\n\nThe list of Christmas \"carols\" from the 17th century on runs to many hundreds, perhaps even in the thousands. Here, I can only turn to a few of my favorites, oddities though they be. A most unusual composer who was active before, during and after the American Revolution was William Billings.\n\nSelf-trained, Billings turned out a substantial catalog of songs, both religious and patriotic, and he was not averse to using an old song with a new text. His tunes have a sharp, jaunty quality to them, as we hear in one of his most popular numbers called \"Boston.\" Don't be fooled by the title: A revolutionary ballad was revised as a Christmas carol. \"Let all your fears be banished hence; glad tidings we proclaim, for there's a Savior born today, and Jesus is his name.\"\n\n\"Adeste Fideles\" dates back to the 1700s, but in the American colonies around 1800, the text of the time read, \"Lord, t'is a pleasant thing to stand, in gardens planted by thy hand ...\" The melody of \"Hark, the Herald Angels Sing\" was composed by the famous Felix Mendelssohn, but to a very different lyric: a tribute honoring Gutenberg for the invention of the movable print.\n\nIrving Berlin's \"White Christmas\" of 1942 set the standard for the secular Christmas song, and a lovely, memorable tune it is. But now all the songs are about snow, and memories, and love both cherished and frustrated, and roasting chestnuts, about getting — and not getting — presents, and Santa Claus, and eight reindeer (one with a red nose), about homecoming, and twinkling lights, decorating Christmas trees, sled-riding ... Let's see. Have I forgotten something?\n\nM.J. \"Al\" Albacete is an adjunct professor at Kent State University at Stark and executive director emeritus of the Canton Museum of Art."
