Joy is connected with hope. We can be joyful in dire circumstances but have joy because we know this is not the end. Joy is anticipation that there is a good ending and the source is very good.\n\nPersonally, I will be very glad when 2016 is part of my history. There have been trials and tragedies I’d just as soon forget. But in the midst of it all, I am choosing to have joy.\n\nNo matter your circumstances this season, may you find joy and have a Merry Christmas!"
