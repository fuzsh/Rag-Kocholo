        "text": "We pride ourselves on offering one of the highest and best quality wine label printing services available. Because labels purchased for personal use tend to be subjected to extreme scrutiny - you have ordered them for a special purpose; of course you want them to be perfect - and are also subjected to the rigors of shipping, packing in boxes, refrigeration, etc, we focus on the following key issues:\n\nPrint Quality\n\nAs a general rule, commercial wine labels are printed on the most technologically advanced presses in the world. Wine is an expensive product and a large portion of the total budget for producing a bottle of wine is given over to packaging. Matching this quality in the world of short run, personalized labels is a daunting task. Over the years we have continually striven to improve our print quality and raise standards and our labels are now all printed to photographic or near photographic quality.\n\nDigital Die-Cutting\n\nUnlike most of our competitors we do not print on pre-cut sheets. All of our die-cutting is done AFTER printing, much like the process used by commercial wine label printers. This results in a much greater level of consistency, allowing for tight borders and truly professional results. And because our die-cutting system is a digital process, we can create complex, custom die-shapes, on the fly, at very little cost to the consumer.\n\nDurability\n\nUnlike commercial labels, which are not subjected to the same scrutiny, our labels are made to withstand a great deal of abuse and still look great. They are moisture and scuff resistant, and are able to withstand the effects of prolonged exposure to U.V. light. Meeting this high quality standard in a way that allows for affordable short run production has been one of our biggest challenges yet also one of our greatest triumphs. When you order from us, you do not need to worry about your labels losing patches of ink when they rub against the edges of a cardboard box, or disintegrating when exposed to condensation.\n\nPlease note however that while our labels are resistant to moisture and condensation, we do advise against fully submerging your labels in water or other liquids, as this will result in liquids being absorbed into the edges of the labels over time.\n\nMaterial Options\n\nGlossy Laminated Self-Adhesive Paper - This option has been our standard since the middle of 2011. The print quality is very good and the laminate provides an unbeatable level of durability and excellent moisture resistance while maintaining a slightly textured feel."
