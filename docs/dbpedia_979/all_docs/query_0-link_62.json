        "text": "This exhortation was given at King’s Cross Church on December 17, AD 2023.\n\nThe Incarnation of God highlights a foundational truth of the gospel – that God first comes to us.\n\nBut while the Incarnation is the ultimate example of this truth, it is not the first demonstration of it. This is how it has always been, from the very beginning when God sought after Adam and Eve in the Garden as they hid in their shame (Gen. 3:9:10, 15. Throughout all of history, we see God as the Great Initiator in the salvation of His people.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nThis communion meditation was given at King’s Cross Church on December 17, AD 2023.\n\nIn Philippians 2 the Apostle Paul writes, “Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus, who, being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God, but made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a servant, and coming in the likeness of men. And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross…” (2:5–8).\n\nHere at this Table we are reminded of the humility of Christ, the One who came down from heaven in order to become a servant of all. And the Apostle Paul says that this is not just something we ought to acknowledge or admire, but something we are to imitate. In the life of Christ, beginning with His incarnation all the way to His death, we find our chief example of what it looks like to live for the glory of God.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nThis is an OT exegetical paper I wrote as part of the ordination process in Knox Presbytery of the Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches (CREC). Forgive any typos…\n\nIntroduction\n\nThroughout church history, the Book of Isaiah has been one of the most beloved books of the Old Testament, containing precious promises concerning the coming of our Lord. By most accounts, Isaiah is the second-most referenced Old Testament text in the New Testament, preceded only by the Psalms. According to scholar John F.A. Sawyer, Isaiah is quoted or alluded to in the New Testament about 250 times, with an astonishing forty-five of the sixty-six chapters represented.[1] In the prologue to his translation of Isaiah, St Jerome stated that Isaiah “should be called not so much a prophet as an evangelist. For he pursued all the mysteries of Christ and his church so clearly that you would think he was not prophesying about the future but recounting the history of what was past.”[2] Similar sentiments are shared by St Augustine and many others, with Matthew Poole noting “that some ancients called [Isaiah] the ‘fifth evangelist.’”[3]Clearly Isaiah has been a treasure of the church throughout the ages.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nThis communion meditation was given at King’s Cross Church on December 18, AD 2022.\n\nIn both Matthew and Luke’s nativity accounts we are told how Christ was born in Bethlehem, the birthplace of King David.\n\nThis was to fulfill the words of the Prophet Micah when he declared unto Bethlehem that though they are too small a city to be among the clans of Judah, from them shall come forth one who is to be the ruler of Israel, whose coming forth is from of old, from ancient of days (Micah 5).\n\nThere is another significance to the location of Bethlehem, for Bethlehem in Hebrew means “House of Bread.”\n\nIt’s interesting that in his narrative, Luke points out a seemingly minor detail not just once but three times. He notes that Mary laid her firstborn son in a manger, for there was no place for them in the inn. This detail surely highlights the humility of the incarnation, that our Lord and King was not born in a palace but a stable.\n\nBut it also points to something else. Here in Bethlehem, in the House of Bread, lays a child in a feeding trough—the One who is the Bread of Life. And here at this Table, we remember how from that day on His humility increased. This Bread of Life was eventually broken for us and for the life of the world.\n\nSo come, and welcome, to Jesus Christ.\n\nThis exhortation was given at King’s Cross Church (Moscow, ID) on December 18, AD 2022.\n\nBefore the coming of our Lord, God sent John the Baptist, to ready His people for the great arrival of their Messiah. He was a forerunner, a herald whose cry of repentance was to prepare the Bride to meet her Bridegroom.\n\nAs it was written in the Book of Isaiah,\n\n“The voice of one crying in the wilderness:\n\nPrepare the way of the Lord,\n\nMake his paths straight.\n\nEvery valley shall be filled,\n\nAnd every mountain and hill shall be made low,\n\nAnd the crooked shall become straight,\n\nAnd the rough places shall become level ways,\n\nand all flesh shall see the salvation of God.”\n\nContinue reading →\n\nThis sacrament which we are about to partake of together is a visible reminder of our Lord’s first Advent.\n\nThe true physicality of the incarnation is matched here by the physicality of this Supper. The eternal Son, begotten of the Father, truly became man.\n\nYou could behold Him with your eyes. You could reach out and touch Him with your hands. Just as you see and touch this bread and wine here today.\n\nAnd this is sacrament is also a reminder of Christ’s second Advent. As the Apostle Paul says in the words of institution proclaimed each week, “For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until He comes.”\n\nSo here at this Table we look back at our Lord’s first Advent and His work on our behalf.\n\nWe look forward to His second Advent, awaiting our blessed hope, the appearing of our great God and Savior.\n\nAnd we behold now our Lord, for He comes to us here in this moment in simple bread and wine.\n\nSo come and welcome to Jesus Christ.\n\nThis excerpt is from ‘Through the Gates of Splendor’ by Elisabeth Eliot.\n\n“One Sunday afternoon, December 18, Nate Saint sat at his typewriter to tell the world why they were going—just in case. In speaking these words he spoke for all: ‘As we weigh the future and seek the will of God, does it seem right that we should hazard our lives for just a few savages? As we ask ourselves this question, we realize that is is not the call of the needy thousands, rather it is the simple intimation of the prophetic Word that there shall be some from every tribe in His presence in the last day and in our hearts we feel that it is pleasing to Him that we should interest ourselves in making an opening into the Auca prison for Christ.\n\nAs we have a high old time this Christmas, may we who know Christ hear the cry of the damned as they hurtle headlong into the Christless night without ever a chance. May we be moved with compassion as our Lord was. May we shed tears of repentance for these we have failed to bring out of darkness. Beyond the smiling scenes of Bethlehem may we see the crushing agony of Golgotha. May God give us a new vision of His will concerning the lost and our responsibility.\n\nContinue reading →\n\n“Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, the son of David” (Mt. 22:42).\n\nChristmas is a season which almost all Christians observe in one way or another. Some keep it as a religious season. Some keep it as a holiday. But all over the world, wherever there are Christians, in one way or another Christmas is kept.\n\nPerhaps there is no country in which Christmas is so much observed as it is in England. Christmas holidays, Christmas parties, Christmas family-gatherings, Christmas services in churches, Christmas hymns and carols, Christmas holly and mistletoe,—who has not heard of these things? They are as familiar to English people as anything in their lives. They are among the first things we remember when we were children. Our grandfathers and grandmothers were used to them long before we were born. They have been going on in England for many hundred years. They seem likely to go on as long as the world stands.\n\nBut, reader, how many of those who keep Christmas ever consider why Christmas is kept? How many, in their Christmas plans and arrangements, give a thought to Him, without whom there would have been no Christmas at all? How many ever remember that the Lord Jesus Christ is the cause of Christmas ? How many ever reflect that the first intention of Christmas was to remind Christians of Christ’s birth and coming into the world? Reader, how is it with you? What do you think of at Christmas?\n\nBear with me a few minutes, while I try to press upon you the question which heads this tract. I do not want to make your Christmas merriment less. I do not wish to spoil your Christmas cheer. I only wish to put things in their right places. I want Christ Himself to be remembered at Christmas! Give me your attention while I unfold the question—”What think ye of Christ?”\n\nContinue reading →"
