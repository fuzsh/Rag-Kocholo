        "text": "This is a gem of an album, containing not only some glorious and seldom heard pieces but is also the only available recorded version of ‘Soberana Maria’ (anon.). ‘A piece of heart-breaking beauty, sung exquisitely a capella’ wrote a reviewer on Amazon.com of this admirable album made in 1968 – one of Roger Norrington’s earliest recordings. It was made for the Decca label before his extended recordings for EMI. Featuring choral music for the Christmas season from the early Baroque era, the music is sung in Spanish, Latin, English and German. The original title of the LP ‘Glad Tidings’ has been restored for this reissue.\n\n‘This album is perfect for keeping Christmas sacred. The combination of glory and joy in the music is overwhelming. It is also a great exposure to chorale works in German, Spanish, Latin and English. I would buy it for track 3 alone-the hauntingly beautiful ‘Soberana Maria’ will send chills up your spine.’ Customer review on Amazon.com\n\n‘Christmas has, of course, inspired some of music’s greatest masterpieces; it has also inspired some of its stickiest lollipops. The difficulty is to get a balanced diet and though the present record has its sweet-ish moments, there is more than enough serious music to prevent the mixture becoming sickly … The men soloists in these are excellent, and the bass, Stafford Dean, manages the difficult ‘Gostling’ part most dexterously. Altogether a very creditable and enjoyable affair and a most suitable Christmas present … a winner’ Gramophone"
