        "text": "\"We Wish You a Merry Christmas\" is a popular secular 16th century English carol from the West Country of England.\n\nThe origin of this Christmas carol lies in the English tradition where wealthy people of the community gave Christmas treats to the carolers on Christmas Eve such as \"figgy puddings\" that were very much like modern-day Christmas puddings. It is one of the few traditional holiday carols that makes mention of the New Year celebration. The simple chorus and holiday greetings have made it a popular finale to many holiday specials over the years.\n\nThe song is notably sung, with alternate lyrics, in the Phineas and Ferb Holiday Favorites album as its 16th and final track. This version is also featured in the Season 3 episode, \"A Phineas and Ferb Family Christmas\" and, the original version, is sung in the Season 2 episode, \"Phineas and Ferb Christmas Vacation!\", sung by Danville carolers.\n\nThe song was also sung on Good Luck Jessie: NYC Christmas, when Zuri explained to Jessie and Teddy what Christmas truly is, since they were both frustrated about the subway stalling and being unable to reach NYU for their college tour or to an audition for a small movie role. The entire subway car sang the song, and a lady who Zuri pleaded for lasagna offered her a piece.\n\nLyrics[]\n\nVideos[]\n\nBackground Information[]\n\nThe Phineas and Ferb Holiday Favorites album lists \"The Cast of Phineas and Ferb\" as the song's singers.\n\nThis song speaks more of Isabella's family, showing she has relatives from Mexico and Jerusalem.\n\nIn \"A Phineas and Ferb Family Christmas\", Vivian Garcia-Shapiro makes a cameo, wearing the same blue sleeveless dress she wore in \"Picture This\".\n\nThe \"calculator-slash-Hindi-English-translator\" Baljeet mentions may be the one that he gets from Buford (and is automatically smashed by Buford's baseball bat) in \"Phineas and Ferb Christmas Vacation!\".\n\nBefore \"A Phineas and Ferb Family Christmas\", a music video using a combination of clips from the series combined with some created for the video was aired. It debuted during the opening of the Disney Store in New York City on November 9, 2010. It also aired on Disney Channel November 26 @ 8pm during the premiere of The Suite Life on Deck episode of I'm in the Band. The music video was also seen on Disney XD UK on December 20, 2010. The \"Happy Holidays from Phineas and Ferb\" scene at the end was cut. The Disney XD logo was seen when the music video played.\n\nThe first section of Isabella's line was skipped when it played on Disney Channel.\n\nWhen Buford sings his lines (and gives Baljeet a wedgie), he and Baljeet are in a Nativity Play; Buford playing as the angel and Baljeet playing as the shepherd (in the Gospel of Luke), who was visited by the angel after Christ was born.\n\nIsabella says in \"Phineas and Ferb Christmas Vacation!\" that she doesn't celebrate Christmas. However, in the song, she sings about celebrating it with her family.\n\nThe following lines \"I warn you, my new -inator/Will force you to serve me later/So why not just choose to cater/To my every whim?\" and the speaking lines, \"Sorry, sir...\" from Carl Karl and the talk between Heinz Doofenshmirtz and Francis \"Major\" Monogram: \"Oh, great. Well now we've mentioned it. / You know, no one would have noticed if you'd have just kept your mouth shut.\" were cut from \"A Phineas and Ferb Family Christmas\".\n\nThough not the Phineas and Ferb version of the song, We Wish You a Merry Christmas was sung by carolers to force Heinz Doofenshmirtz into giving them figgy pudding in the episode \"Phineas and Ferb Christmas Vacation!\"\n\nSecond time Isabella sings her catchphrase, the first being her song in The Dad-inator. This is also the 2nd time she sang it in an episode, the first being \"What'cha Doin?\" in \"Rollercoaster: The Musical!\"\n\nIn the Dinosaurs universe they celebrate a Christmas like-holiday called Refrigerator day, as seen in the episode Refrigerator Day. Refrigerator Day has carols, one of which is \"We Wish You A Merry Fridge Day\", a parody of We Wish You A Merry Christmas.\n\nReferences[]\n\nWe Wish You a Merry Christmas Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Wish_You_a_Merry_Christmas#From_Warrell_.281935.29\n\nThis page uses Creative Commons Licensed content from the Phineas and Ferb Wiki.
