        "text": "The Mormon Tabernacle Choir continues to reach milestones, both in the traditional medium of commercial recording and in the new medium of the Internet, specifically with its new YouTube Channel launched last year.\n\nThe latest year-in-review issue of Billboard Magazine, the recording-industry trade publication, features the year-end charts for 2012. In one of those charts, the choir, with its sister organization the Orchestra at Temple Square, was named the No. 1 Traditional Classical Albums Artists.\n\nOverall, the choir and orchestra charted on five of the year-end lists and twice on an albums list. It placed No. 3 and No. 9 on Traditional Classical Albums (for the albums \"GLORY! Music of Rejoicing\" and \"This Is the Christ\" respectively); No. 4 on Traditional Classical Albums Imprint; No. 5 on Traditional Classical Albums Label; and No. 12 on Classical Crossover Albums (for the album \"Glad Christmas Tidings\" featuring David Archuleta).\n\nThe magazine's year-end charts are calculated using custom formulas that incorporate product sales, streaming music and radio play.\n\nThe choir, which has been making recordings for more than a century, recently observed the 10th anniversary of the formation of its own recording label. It is a partner with Deseret Book Co., which handles all product distribution and marketing.\n\n\"This designation is much deserved and reflects the masterful music that the choir and orchestra produce, both in concert and recordings,\" said Deseret Book CEO Sheri Dew regarding the Billboard Magazine achievement. \"It's well-known that [musical director] Mack Wilberg is a musical genius, and this just further validates it.\"\n\nThe choir has recorded nearly 200 albums, including five gold records (indicating sales of 500,000 copies or more each), two platinum records (1 million copies or more each), and a Grammy Award earned in 1959 for its signature song \"Battle Hymn of the Republic.\" Its latest recording is \"Teach Me to Walk in the Light & Other Children's Favorites,\" available in stores and as an iTunes download.\n\nIn addition to its recording industry success, the choir on Jan. 17 topped 1 million views on the YouTube Channel it launched less than three months ago, on Oct. 30. The channel had an estimated 3.23 million minutes watched by viewers by the end of 2012.\n\nSubscribers to the YouTube Channel, in decreasing order of number of viewers, hail from the United States (No. 1), Brazil (No. 2), the Philippines (No. 10), Russia (No. 19) and Malaysia (No. 25) among other nations.\n\nThe full program of David Archuleta performing with the choir at the 2011 Christmas concert had the highest views, followed by Alex Boyé singing \"I Want Jesus to Walk with Me.\" Other favorites are \"Music and the Spoken Word\" broadcasts, Alfie Boe singing \"Bring Him Home,\" the choir performing \"Hallelujah\" from \"Christ on the Mount of Olives,\" and the African spiritual \"Betelehemu.\"\n\nTo access the channel, go to www.YouTube.com/user/MormonTabChoir.\n\nThe \"Music and the Spoken Word\" program is the world's longest-running continuous network broadcast. It airs on more than 2,000 TV, radio and cable stations across the country.\n\nThe 360 choir members are accompanied by the 110-member Orchestra at Temple Square and three organists: Clay Christiansen, Richard Elliott and Andrew Unsworth. Ryan Murphy is the assistant music director."
