        "text": "It may lay a claim on helping to come up with Santa Claus’s famous winter wardrobe, but Coca-Cola is beaten by John Lewis when it comes to the brands British people identify most closely with Christmas, according to research released on Friday.\n\nThe British retailer narrowly pipped the US firm, with 27% of those who responded saying they equated it with the festive period: one percentage point ahead of Coca-Cola.\n\nThe supermarket chains Marks & Spencer, Tesco and Sainsbury’s made up the rest of the top five. Argos, Cadbury and Asda were next, with Toys R Us and Amazon accounting for the remainder of the top 10.\n\nAccording to the research, the UK was most keenly anticipating the release of Christmas adverts from the same top three brands – John Lewis, Coca-Cola and M&S – in exactly the same order.\n\nJohn Lewis was one percentage point ahead of Coca Cola again, with the former on 38%, while M&S lagged behind on 27%.\n\nThe John Lewis Partnership brand Waitrose, which fired the first shot in this year’s battle of the Christmas advert, did not make it on to the list.\n\nThe survey found that women were significantly more likely than men to associate John Lewis with Christmas – 32% of the former picking it out, against 21% of the latter.\n\nAnd the brand was particularly associated with Christmas by 35- to 54-year-olds, with 32% choosing it. Coca-Cola, on the other hand, was most closely associated with the festive period by younger people.\n\nRegionally, the association of John Lewis with Christmas was strongest in Wales, while, for Coca-Cola, it was in Yorkshire and, for M&S, north-east England.\n\nResearchers from the agency MindMover, working on behalf of the online advertising firm RadiumOne, carried out an online survey of 1,000 people aged 16 and older in August this year."
