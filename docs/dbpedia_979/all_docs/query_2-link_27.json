holidays.\n\nAnd it's not just the decorations, the food, the food and the presents.\n\nWe love the music.\n\nTonight, we'd like to share one Christmas song that is especially beloved in the Philippines.\n\nAnd for good reason.\n\nOn New Year's Day 1942, a few weeks after the bombings at Pearl Harbor, Manila was attacked.\n\nBy the time the war Ended three years later, it was almost completely destroyed.\n\nThen, a year after that, on Christmas night 1946, a young Filipino musician by the name of Filipe de Leon climbed to the top of the tallest remaining ruins.\n\nThere, as he looked out on the dark devastation of war, he was inspired to write this carol of peace.\n\nIt has brought hope and healing to the Filipino people ever since.\n\nMay it bring hope to you this Christmas as well.\n\n[piano music ] ♪ Ang gabi'y payapa ♪ ♪ Lahat ay tahimik ♪ ♪ Pati mga tala ♪ ♪ Sa bughaw na langit ♪ ♪ Kay hinhin ng hangin ♪ ♪ Waring umiibig ♪ ♪ Sa kapayapaan ♪ ♪ Ng buong

newest, closest friends.\n\nThe Nativity story means something special to us as women.\n\nThe journey to Bethlehem, the stable, the manger we don't take any of that lightly.\n\nMary is not just another character in the Bible.\n\nShe is a mother.\n\nA first-time mother with a unique role and responsibility.\n\nI still remember my feelings when I learned I was expecting a daughter.\n\nFeelings that are perfectly expressed in this next song.\n\nWhether we are daughters, sisters, aunts, mothers, or grandmothers, Christmas for us includes thinking about new life coming into the world and nurturing the next generation.\n\nIt's the story we all share as women.\n\nThe story that goes on.\n\n♪ So this is the tale my mother told me, ♪ ♪ That tale that was much ♪ ♪ too dull to hold me, And this is the surge and the rush ♪ ♪ she said would show, our story goes ♪ ♪ on.\n\nOh, I was young I forgot that ♪ ♪ things outlive me; my goal was the kick that life ♪ ♪ would give me.\n\nAnd now like a joke something moves ♪ ♪ to let me know our story goes on.\n\n♪ ♪ And all these things I feel and more ♪ ♪ My mother's mother felt and hers before.\n\n♪ ♪ A chain of life begun upon the shore of ♪ ♪ some dark sea ♪ ♪ has reached to me!\n\n♪ ♪ And now, I can see the chain extending, ♪ ♪ my child is next in a line that has no ending, ♪ ♪ and here am I full of life that her child will feel ♪ ♪ when

a very good evening to you.\n\nWhat a pleasure and privilege it is, for me, to be with you this evening.\n\nAnd together with this extraordinary choir amazingly talented orchestra!\n\n[applause] This evening, we come together to share a true story from over 80 years ago.\n\nIt takes place near a region connected with my own heritage, the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.\n\nAnd it's also about people who were Jewish, like many of my own ancestors devoted to their faith and deeply dedicated to their families.\n\nDuring this period, they lived in a land occupied by a foreign power.\n\nWell not unlike the Holy Family so long ago.\n\nIndeed, it's a familiar scene in the world today, suggesting that this is a story for our time.\n\n♪ Once in royal David's city ♪ ♪ Stood a lowly cattle shed ♪ ♪ Where a mother laid her baby ♪ ♪ in a manger for his bed.\n\n♪ ♪ Mary was that mother mild, ♪ ♪ Jesus Christ her little child.\n\n♪ In the final months of 1938, the shadow of war was spreading across Europe.\n\nHitler's armies had marched into the borderlands of Czechoslovakia, forcing Jewish families, among others, to flee their homes and seek refuge inland.\n\nAs the light of Hanukkah And Christmas drew near, so did the darkness of ethnic cleansing.\n\nMeanwhile, 800 miles away in London, a 29-year-old English stockbroker, Nicholas Winton, was preparing for a ski vacation in Switzerland.\n\nBut, just days before his departure, a friend called from Prague.\n\n\"Nicky,\" he said, \"forget the skis.\n\nYou need to see what's happening here.\"\n\nNicky, the son of Jewish-German immigrants, had a background in international banking and was fluent in German and French.\n\nLong interested in world politics, he was naturally curious and immediately changed his plans.\n\nNicky arrived in the Czech capital on New Year's Eve.\n\nThere, in the throes of winter, he found sprawling encampments of refugee families, mostly Jewish, huddled in tents and makeshift huts, at best.\n\nThey were trapped.\n\nVisas for adults were nearly impossible to obtain, much less for entire families.\n\nSome wanted to escape, and others were determined to stay, but most agreed that something had to be done to safeguard their children now, before it was too late.\n\nWell Nicky turned this problem over in his mind: \"If it's not impossible,\" he thought, \"then there must be a way to do it.\"\n\nWorking with other organizations, a plan emerged: By special waiver, children could leave the country without their parents, as long as host families abroad took them in.\n\nWell as word spread of the plan, parents lined the hallways and staircases of Nicky's hotel, begging for their little ones to be included.\n\nIf they could get their children out of the country, they would find a way to follow them.\n\nThree weeks later, when Nicky's holiday vacation came to an end, he carried home the names and photographs of literally hundreds of children, entrusted to him by their parents.\n\nBack in London, Nicky worked at the Stock Exchange by day and coordinated the rescue by night.\n\nTo expedite the effort, well he \"borrowed\" stationary from the British refugee committee, adding the words \"Children's Section\" and calling a meeting of one to appoint himself \"Honorary Secretary.\"\n\nUsing that title, he wrote to various governments for help.\n\nSeveral declined, but the British Home Office agreed.\n\nAs long as Nicky provided a #50 guarantee for each child now that's the equivalent today of over four-thousand American dollars per child.\n\nWith the assistance of his mother and a growing circle of helpers, Nicky threw himself into recruiting host families, raising funds, and securing visas.\n\nFor nine months the work continued.\n\nAnd for nine months, children traveled by train and ferry to England.\n\nAmong the most moving images of Nicky's service are parents on the train platforms at Prague Wilson Station.\n\nHiding their grief, they took their children in their arms, assured them of an exciting adventure ahead, and promised to be reunited soon.\n\nThrough that spring and summer of 1939, as train whistles blew and steam filled the skies, parents waved goodbye, pleading for the strength that only God could provide.\n\n♪ Maoz tsur y'shuati ♪ ♪ L'cha naeh l'shabeiach ♪ ♪ Tikon beit t'filati ♪ ♪ V'sham toda n'zabeiach.\n\n♪ [choir humming] All too soon, war was declared, and the Czech border closed.\n\nAt final count, 669 children had been rescued.\n\nWith few exceptions, their families perished, never to be seen again.\n\nThe only record of the rescue was a scrapbook, made by one of Nicky's team members.\n\nThe book's pages were brimming with lists of children, emigration passes, diplomatic correspondence, and so on.\n\nBut Nicky was not focused on the past.\n\nHe was thinking about the future.\n\nSo, the scrapbook went into the attic and Nicky moved on with his life.\n\nHe married, had three children, worked in local business and government affairs, organized assistance for the disabled and elderly, and went about doing good wherever a need was found.\n\nFor some 50 years Nicky rarely spoke of his rescue work, and when he did, well it was only in passing.\n\nAnd that brings us here, to a setting like this one.\n\nIn the months before Nicky's 80th birthday, his wife Grete found herself in the attic sorting papers.\n\nAnd there, in a worn leather case, she discovered the scrapbook.\n\nWell needless to say, she was astonished.\n\n\"Who were these children?\n\n\"she wondered, and why didn't she know about them?\n\n\"Well, it happened so long ago,\" Nicky explained.\n\n\"Quite frankly, I haven't given the episode much thought since.\"\n\nAs they talked, they agreed that the book and the history in it had to be preserved.\n\nAnd with the help of a well-known Holocaust expert, the story began to come to light.\n\nEventually, the BBC invited Nicky to appear on a television program called \"That's Life.\"\n\nAnd what happened next was a total surprise, even to Nicky himself.\n\nBack here you will see is the list of all the children and the foster families who took them in.\n\nThis is Vera Diamant, when she was 10, now she is Vera Gissing.\n\nShe had no idea that Nicholas Winton had, in fact, arranged her rescue!\n\nBut we did find her name, Vera Diamant, who she was then, on his list.\n\nVera Gissing is with us here tonight.\n\nHello, Vera.\n\nAnd I should tell you that you are actually sitting next to Nicholas Winton.\n\n[applause] -Thank you -One more story for you.\n\nMilena Fleishman.\n\nMilena, I believe you still have the nametag you wore round your neck when you arrived as a little girl at Liverpool.\n\n-Yes, I have.\n\nI wore this around my neck.\n\nAnd this is the actual pass that we were given to come to England, and I'm another of the children that you saved.\n\n[applause] -Can I ask, is there anyone in our audience tonight who owes their life to Nicholas Winton.\n\nIf so, could you stand up please?\n\n[gentle orchestral music] In his last years, Nicky was continually surrounded by his honorary children and grandchildren, all grateful to finally understand the story of their lives.\n\nAnd though Nicky was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II and often referred to as \"The British Schindler,\" he rejected adulation.\n\n\"I am not a hero,\" he insisted.\n\n\"I just did what needed to be done.\"\n\nWhen Nicky died at the age of one hundred and six, most of the original children had still not been found.\n\nBut the known posterity of his rescued family numbered over six thousand.\n\nIn time, Nicky's scrapbook was placed in Yad Vashem, the World Holocaust Remembrance Center in Jerusalem.\n\nAnd in that setting, his wartime service shines as it should, in memory of the parents and families who sacrificed to save their children.\n\nNicky was once asked, \"Why did you keep the scrapbook a secret?\"\n\n\"I didn't keep it a secret,\" he said, \"I just didn't talk about it.\"\n\nWell, perhaps that's because Nicky knew he had more good to do in his life, more than could be contained in any book.\n\nFor gifts of goodness are truly endless.\n\nAs we are blessed, we bless others.\n\nAnd the giving goes on.\n\nDuring that last winter before the war, Jewish parents in Czechoslovakia were not able to celebrate Hanukkah in all the customary ways.\n\nBut they knew that in the Hanukkah menorah, the single center candle lights all of the others.\n\nThe light of God's goodness in just one person can bring light to many, now and for generations to come.\n\nThis season, what endless light will we bring to others?\n\nWhat stories will fill the scrapbooks of our lives?\n\nFor some it will be helping refugees in war-torn lands.\n\nFor others, it will be visiting a lonely neighbor or even lifting up a downcast friend.\n\nWhatever we do, the spark of our tiny effort can fill this world with light and write a story of hope and peace that never ends.\n\nAnd in that spirit, as the Choir sings a final, newly written verse of the carol, \"Once in Royal David's City,\" we invite you to sing along.\n\nAnd if, this year, you wish to dedicate yourself to sharing God's light through service to others, turn on the light of your phone.\n\nLift it up high.\n\nAnd let it be the symbol of His Light and Life, shining through you, to all the world.\n\n[choir and audience singing] ♪ Light of God grow bright within us, ♪ ♪ Let Thy love in us increase, ♪ ♪ Shine through us in all our service, ♪ ♪ Lift us up in

[applause] Thank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nMy goodness, Thank you so very much.\n\nBut... we're not finished yet.\n\nBecause this evening, we have the most wonderful surprise.\n\nWe are absolutly delighted to have with us the son of Nicholas Winton.\n\nPlease join me in welcoming his namesake, Mr. Nick Winton.\n\n[applause] I'm still a bit overcome.\n\nAmazing.\n\n[applause] -Nick, thank you so much for being here.\n\nAnd I don't have to say it.\n\nA huge welcome from everyone.\n\nNick you are, are you not, the last of your father's three children still alive?\n\n-Yes, sadly that's true.\n\nMy brother died quite young.\n\nSorry, I'm still very overcome by the evening.\n\nMy sister died quite recently.\n\nUm, but I shall also say that there are many thousands all over the world who are alive because of the rescue that my father did.\n\nMany of them considered him to be their father or their grandfather or even their great-grandfather because he was their only living connection with their past.\n\nThe rest of their family had perished.\n\n-Remarkable.\n\nAbsolutely remarkable.\n\nCould you tell us what you have found to be most helpful about your father's experience for you, personally?\n\n-Well.\n\nI guess the most valuable lesson I've learned is that each one of us changes the world every single day.\n\nSounds kind of grandiose.\n\nBut it may be just in small ways like helping someone with their groceries, or even just a smile when they need something.\n\nAnd of course we also make life worse by not doing something that's needed.\n\nBut my father he believed in what he called active goodness.\n\nThat is, to be a good person we should actively do things to help others rather than be passive.\n\nSimply avoiding doing anything bad.\n\nHe spent most of his very long life helping to make the world a better place and loved doing it.\n\nAnd that, to me, is the essence of the Christmas spirit.\n\n-Nicky, we're so grateful to you for coming here and we wish you, your family and all those that you love a very blessed and truly joyful Christmas.\n\n-Thank you [applause] ♪ One in hope, One in love, ♪ ♪ One in Thee this blessed, ♪ ♪ holy

to the Romans, I found the most beautiful expression of the life I had hoped to live.\n\nI read about a life of caring, generosity, and being there for other people.\n\nSince then, I've had the opportunity to read biblical scripture in many live presentations and I've been privileged to record the Bible in its entirety.\n\nAnd whether or not we imagine ourselves rocking Little Jesus in the manger as described in the carol, I hope that this reading, this Christmas, will inspire us to regard one another as lovingly and tenderly as a newborn child, for we are all God's children.\n\nAnd it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.\n\nAnd all went to be taxed, everyone into his own city.\n\nAnd Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem to be taxed, with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.\n\nAnd so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.\n\nAnd she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.\n\nAnd there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.\n\nAnd, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them: and they were sore afraid.\n\nAnd the angel said unto them, fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.\n\nFor unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord.\n\nAnd this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.\n\nAnd suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.\n\n♪ Angels from the
