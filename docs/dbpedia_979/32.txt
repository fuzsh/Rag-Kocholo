This is a gem of an album, containing not only some glorious and seldom heard pieces but is also the only available recorded version of ‘Soberana Maria’ (anon.). ‘A piece of heart-breaking beauty, sung exquisitely a capella’ wrote a reviewer on Amazon.com of this admirable album made in 1968 – one of Roger Norrington’s earliest recordings. It was made for the Decca label before his extended recordings for EMI. Featuring choral music for the Christmas season from the early Baroque era, the music is sung in Spanish, Latin, English and German. The original title of the LP ‘Glad Tidings’ has been restored for this reissue.
