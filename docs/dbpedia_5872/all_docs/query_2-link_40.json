        "text": "This work is aimed at reporting a personal, and thus partial, history of the dynamics and stability concepts within the framework of classical mechanics. The idea is to introduce these concepts without using mathematics and formula, but rather through practical and clear examples. For this purpose, it has been chosen to take in consideration some simple dynamic phenomena that we are used to live with, but that are able to explain more complex concepts. The paper starts with a brief summary on equilibrium concept evolution, passes through stability problems and arrives to more advanced concepts, such as structural stability and dynamical integrity.\n\nConsider a gas confined to the left half of a container. Then remove the wall separating the two parts. The gas will start spreading and soon be evenly distributed over the entire available space. The gas has approached equilibrium. Why does the gas behave in this way? The canonical answer to this question, originally proffered by Boltzmann, is that the system has to be ergodic for the approach to equilibrium to take place. This answer has been criticised on different grounds and is now widely regarded as flawed. In this paper we argue that these criticisms have dismissed Boltzmann&#39;s answer too quickly and that something almost like Boltzmann&#39;s answer is true: the approach to equilibrium takes place if the system is epsilon-ergodic, i.e. ergodic on the entire accessible phase space except for a small region of measure epsilon. We introduce epsilon-ergodicity and argue that relevant systems in statistical mechanics are indeed espsilon-ergodic."
