        "text": "<strong>Monday</strong>, 8:00am - 9:30am ■ MA01 Tutorial: Attractive Formulations of Integer Programs Cluster: Tutorials Invited Session 1 - Tutorial: Attractive Formulations of Integer Programs Warren Adams, Clemson University, wadams@clemson.edu, Richard Forrester The mathematical representation of a decision problem can greatly affect solution strategies. We discuss reformulation and linearization techniques for 0-1, nonlinear continuous, and general discrete problems that can promote efficient optimization algorithms. Emphasis is given to program size and relaxation strength. General theoretical results will be provided, as well as detailed computational experience for a variety of problem classes. ■ MA02 Software Development and Bank Branch Performance Under the DEA Microscope Cluster: Data Envelopment Analysis Invited Session Chair: Joseph C. Paradi,CMTE, University of Toronto, paradi@mie.utoronto.ca 1- Assessing the Loan Quality and Business Generation Efficiency of a Large Canadian Bank’s Branch Network Using DEA Barak Edelstein,CMTE, University of Toronto, barak@mie.utoronto.ca, Joseph C. Paradi Intermediation efficiency of the retail branch network of one of Canada’s five largest banks are done using three DEA models: to maximize loan quality by minimizing the levels of bad loans produced; to seek to maximize the levels of deposits and loans generated; maximize the levels of potential business that could be generated with no regard to loan quality. Efficiency scores are not only affected by different market characteristics, but a small number of DMUs in a subgroup will generally lead to a higher percentage of efficient DMUs and higher average efficiency scores. 2- Software Production Efficiency Without Size Parameters Using DEA Christopher McEachern,CMTE, University of Toronto, christopher.mceachern@utoronto.ca, Joseph C. Paradi This study uses Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to evaluate 26 software projects completed at a Canadian bank. Internal measures of project risk, complexity, and customer satisfaction are used to assess three facets of the software process: time-to-market, cost estimation, and cost minimization. Very few DEA studies have accounted for risk/complexity in modeling software development; as well, this study does not rely upon an explicit measure of size to account for software development output. 3- The Use of DEA in the Measurement of Software Development Efficiency: A Quality Focused Approach Joseph C. Paradi,CMTE, University of Toronto, paradi@mie.utoronto.ca, D. Schmidt New DEA models for measuring software development efficiency were introduced using end-user quality experience as the main output instead of traditional size metrics. Projects with higher quality were found to be more efficient while larger, riskier, more complex projects had slightly lower efficiency. The relationship between size/risk/complexity and project quality was found to be negligible. DEA based software development productivity measurement offered managerially useful results. 4- Measuring and Incorporating Meaningful Proportional Slacks in Radial DEA Models, and Aspects of Non-Discretionary DEA Models Barak Edelstein,CMTE, University of Toronto, barak@mie.utoronto.ca, Joseph C. Paradi The Full Proportional Slack (FPS) radial DEA model proposes a new methodology for calculating slacks in radial DEA models. The measured slacks represent the full amount by which the corresponding variable needs to be adjusted, thus giving meaning to the slack to variable ratio. The proposed Proportional Slack Adjusted (PSA) DEA model incorporates these slacks into the overall efficiency score. The models are fully units invariant and produce optimal slack selection should alternative optimal solutions exist. INFORMS SAN FRANCISCO— 2005 MA04 1 ■ MA03 Innovation in Teaching OR/MS Contributed Session Chair: Elia Chepaitis, echepaitis@mail.fairfield.edu 1 - Design and Use of a Continuing Case in a Course on Opns Mgmt - and also Project and Information Mgmt James Stewart, Collegiate Professor, University of Maryland University College, Business & Executive Programs Department, 3501 University Boulevard East, Adelphi, MD, 20783, United States, jstewart@umuc.edu, Joseph D’Mello The challenges of designing and using a continuing case in an online, internationally-oriented MBA course in operations, project and information management are addressed. It is found possible to address selected tools and techniques in each field so that students become managerially familiar with them and apply them in an integrated way that improves organizational performance in a new country. 2 - Supporting Self-Studying of Students with a Spreadsheet-Based Tutoring Software Ralph Scheubrein, University of Hohenheim, Dept. 510A, Stuttgart, 70593, Germany, ralph@scheubrein.com Students can deepen their understanding of quantitative methods if they implement the method on his/her own. In this presentation the simple spreadsheetbased tutoring system ExcelTutor is presented which supports the student to learn the steps which are necessary to compute the result of a specific method. The system provides the student with feedback about the correctness of the result and the time necessary to find the solution. 3 - Project Scheduling in Agile Product Development Abdelghani Elimam, Professor, American University in Cairo, 113 Kasr el Aini Street, Cairo, 11511, Egypt, aelimam@aucegypt.edu, Bajis Dodin Product development involves a large number of sequential activities leading to extended cycle time. We propose an approach to allow overlapping of activities that could reduce this cycle time. By starting an activity before completing its predecessors we run the risk of reworking part of this activity. We study the impact of overlapping on project duration and the expected amount of rework. A stochastic project network model is developed and computationally tested. 4 - Reengineering The Capstone IS Course: Leading Group Inquiry into Mission and the General Good Elia Chepaitis, echepaitis@mail.fairfield.edu This paper describes a radical departure from the traditional capstone course in the information systems (IS) major—away from individual projects toward a group inquiry into the profession’s mission and the general good. The intent of the course is to explore and discuss the widening scope of IS in areas that involve the general welfare: security and privacy, misinformation, vice, the protection of intellectual property, the adequacy of the information infrastructures, economic development, disaster management, and information ethics, for example. By and large, due diligence has been left to the market and to business organizations, with occasional public funding, oversight, and coordination—such as in the rare case of Y2K. Strategies for the greater good, in areas noted above, have been illdefined and uncoordinated, and this course will scrutinize these in the light of the University’s Jesuit mission and ideals. ■ MA04 Emergency Preparedness, Disaster Response, and Homeland Security Sponsor: Public Programs & Processes Sponsored Session Chair: John Hall, National Fire Protection Association, 1 Batterymarch Park, Quincy, MA, 02169-7471, United States, jhall@NFPA.org 1 - Emergency Response and Follow-Up to the 9/11 Pentagon Crash: Lessons Still Unlearned Doug Samuelson, InfoLogix, Inc., samuelsondoug@yahoo.com In the emergency response to the 9/11/01 crash at the Pentagon, although much went well, serious problems of communication and coordination created additional, unnecessary hazards to life and safety. Follow-up regarding secondary health effects has been largely neglected. We present several recommendations for improvement. 2 - Building Evacuation Guidance, An Optimization with a Simulation Component Mike Walters, Vice President for Modeling and Analysis, Regal Decision Systems, Inc., 2309 Belair Road, Third Floor, Fallston, MD, 21047, jmwalters@RegalDecision.com"
