        "text": "In an old email (2003!) from my Berliner Humboldt Universität colleague/buddy Michael Burda, I found a gem he forwarded to me from Brad DeLong’s Semi-Daily Journal (July 6, 2003). I was unable to establish a link to the original page at DeLong’s current website.\n\nToday’s post is an article from 1905 that provides spending data based on family accounts kept by the wife of an anonymous professor over a nine year period. Let me provide my thoughts why I believe the professor in question was at Harvard University.\n\nNote that the G.H.M. in the byline to the article appears to be reporting what he was told by an unnamed professor. From the Table of Contents for vol. 95 of The Atlantic Monthly, there is an article (The Ethics of Trust Competition) written by one Gilbert Holland Montague (note: G.H.M.), whom I conclude was the author of the article “What Should College Professors Be Paid?” posted below.\n\nMontague received his BA (1901) and MA (1902) at Harvard where he also went to law school, graduating in 1904. He was an instructor in economics at Harvard while a law student. It would appear from the biographical sketch below that he probably was working at a New York law firm at the time the article was published.\n\nI suppose it would be possible to identify the anonymous professor assuming he overlapped with Montague’s years at Harvard. It seems reasonable to begin a search in the Harvard Law School or the Harvard department of economics. From the article posted below we are told the accounts are based on household records for 9 years (perhaps: 1895-1904) covering two years at the rank of instructor, two years as assistant professor and the last five years at the rank of associate professor. The nine year of accounts begins with the marriage of the couple that had its first child (or servant) after two years. Maybe somebody will track down the Harvard professor, but for my purposes, I am satisfied with establishing a likely Harvard connection.\n\n_____________________________\n\nGilbert Holland Montague, 1880-1961\n\nLawyer, pro-business economist, book collector; economics instructor of FDR.\n\nBorn Springfield, Mass., 1880; BA Harvard, 1901; MA 1902; instructor in economics at Harvard while attending Harvard Law school, Franklin D. Roosevelt was one of his students; graduated Harvard Law School, 1904; worked for New York legal firm; clerked for NY Supreme Court, 1908-1910; special deputy attorney general prosecuting election fraud; taught engineering contracts at Brooklyn Polytechnic, 1906-1917; leading practitioner of antitrust law (Sherman and Clayton acts ); employed representing nearly all the large oil companies; actively involved in pro-business “lobbying” and public policy; involved in numerous congressional investigations and committees; served as an advisor to the Treasury and Justice departments; on Attorney General’s Commission to Study Antitrust Laws, and authored most of its 405-page final report calling for reduced government restrictions on private enterprise, 1955.\n\nHe is particularly of note for his collection of over 15,000 books and 20,000 pamphlets. He collected manuscripts, including a 14th century copy of the Magna Carta. He was a relative of Emily Dickinson and kept a collection of over 900 of her items. He became somewhat of an expert on Emily, and donated his collection to Harvard in 1950, enabling a number of questions about her life to be answered.\n\nA firm believer in free trade, he wrote diligently in defense of free markets and reduced government involvement in business. He wrote a number of books, including Business Competition and the Law (1917) and Rise and Progress of the Standard Oil Company (1903).

H. M.\n\n[Gilbert Holland Montague(?)]\n\nA GREAT deal has been written of late, especially in the annual reports of college presidents, regarding the inadequacy of the compensation received by university teachers. The writer, to whom the question is one of vital importance, has seen many of these general statements, but has failed to ﬁnd any which has taken up the matter in conclusive form. This he hopes to do here concisely.\n\nPrimarily the question is one of standard of living. If a grocery clerk can maintain his family in a suitable degree of decency and comfort on seventy-ﬁve dollars a month, have we a right to expect that a college instructor can do the same? The answer to this involves the demands which society makes upon the respective individuals.\n\nTo get at this point the writer analyzed the itemized household accounts which his wife has kept for the past nine years, during which time he has been connected with one of our large and wealthy universities. Two years were spent as instructor, two as assistant professor, and the next ﬁve as associate professor.\n\nSumming up his total expenditures for these nine years, and in like manner his salary for the same period, he ﬁnds his expenditures have been to his salary in the ratio of 2.1 to 1.\n\nHis average annual expenditure has been $2794.27.\n\nHis average salary has been $1328.15.\n\nFor the privilege of teaching he has paid the difference, or $1466.12 annually, from private means.\n\nEven the unbusinesslike professor must pause before such a state of affairs, and try to fathom the reason for this discrepancy, when his ﬁrm belief is that he is living on as low a scale of economy as is possible for him in his position.\n\nIn order to ﬁnd out where the bad management might be, — if bad management there was, — he divided his expenditure account into thirty-one separate items, arranged in tabular form under the following heads: —\n\nHousehold Furnishing and Repairs.\n\nGroceries, Meat, Fruit, Vegetables, etc.\n\nServants.\n\nFuel.\n\nLight and Water.\n\nGardener and Grounds.\n\nLaundry.\n\nTaxes.\n\nLife Insurance.\n\nFire Insurance.\n\nRent, or Interest on House and Lot.\n\nBicycles and repairs. Horse, care and feed.\n\nDoctors and Dentists.\n\nHospitals, Nurses, Drugs.\n\nDeath Expenses.\n\nLegal Services.\n\nInterest on Borrowed Money, for running expenses.\n\nP. O. Box, Postage, Stationery, Telegrams, Telephone, Express, etc.\n\nNewspapers, Books, and Periodicals.\n\nClothing, Dry Goods, Shoes, etc.\n\nLearned Societies and Social Clubs.\n\nUniversity Gifts and Supplies. Typewriting, Printing and Mimeographing.\n\nChildren’s Tuition and Pocket Money.\n\nSubscriptions and Charity.\n\nTheatre, Concerts, Athletic Sports.\n\nChristmas and other Gifts. Entertainment of Friends.\n\nWine, Beer, Tobacco, Candy, and other Luxuries.\n\nPersonal and Toilet Supplies.\n\nBusiness and Recreation Trips, Hotels, R.R. Fare, Carfare, etc.\n\nFamily Obligations, or Payment of Education Debt.\n\nSavings, other than Life Insurance, looking toward old age.\n\nHe believes that, assuming that a college professor has the right to marry and have two or three children, there is not a single one of these items which may be omitted from a consideration of expenses to cover a period of years. The whole question, then, resolves itself into this: how much per year is it reasonable to allow for each of these items?\n\nIn the community in which he lives, with a family of two adults, two children, and one servant, at the present high prices of the necessities of life, he believes that the sums he mentions are the very least upon which his household can be conducted. And he bases this belief upon a most accurate analysis of fully itemized accounts.\n\nTaking up the items in detail: —\n\nHousehold furnishing and repairs.\n\nThis item must cover, for a period of years. the original cost of household furniture of all descriptions. In addition, it must look after natural wear, tear, and breakage of furniture, glass, dishes, kitchen utensils, rugs, curtains, bedding, etc., as well as carpentry, plumbing, and the like. It must also provide for pictures, “works of art,” and household adornments in general.\n\nDoes $75 a year seem excessive for this? Say $6 a month.\n\nFor ﬁve persons a grocery bill of $25 per month, a meat bill of $15, milk, $5, fruit, vegetables, butter and eggs, $10, or a total of $55 ($11 per person), should not seem unreasonable.\n\nWe must pay $25 a month for even a passable servant. Shall we expect our wives to bear and rear children, do all of the housework, sustain their social duties, and remain well and strong?\n\nKitchen, ﬁreplace, and furnace fuel will aggregate $120 per year, or $10 a month.\n\nLight and water average with us just $5 a month.\n\nThe labor of a gardener one day a month is $2.\n\nOur laundry averages just $10 monthly. Our servants will do no laundry work.\n\nAn investment of $5000 in house and lot, together with personal property and poll tax, makes this $10 a month.\n\nIf there were no house owned, the rent item (11) would have to be increased.\n\nTo protect the family of a man who is not in a position to save, $5000 life insurance is not too much. The monthly premium on this amount, assuming a twenty-payment ordinary life policy, will be $10.\n\n$3000 insurance on house, and $2000 on personal property, makes $18 per year, or $1.50 a month.\n\nSix per cent on $5000 invested in house and lot is $300 annually, or $25 a month. This does not provide for depreciation, maintenance, and repairs. No desirable house on the campus can be rented for less than $35.\n\nNot caring to pay so large a rent, we live off the campus and use bicycles. Their depreciation and repairs average $2 a month. Keeping a horse would cost $8 a month.\n\nAn experience of ten years shows us that not less than $10 a month may be set down for doctors and dentists for the family. A single attack of appendicitis in ten years will take the whole of this.\n\nHospitals, nurses, and drugs average $5 a month.\n\nSince the average duration of life is about forty years, in a family of four individuals one death is to be expected every ten years. This item may be set down at $2 a month.\n\nOccasional notary and minor legal services average $1 a month.\n\nCertain expenses, like life insurance and taxes, being payable in large amounts, necessitate loans from the bank, which are gradually repaid. This item may be set down at ﬁfty cents monthly.\n\nFor a live family with connections, postage, stationery, telegrams, telephones, express, freight, cartage, and allied items, will aggregate $3 a month.\n\nNewspapers, books, and periodicals college professor is supposed to revel in this sort of thing. Suppose we allow him $5 a month.\n\nTo clothe four individuals neatly and completely cannot cost less than $180 a year, can it?\n\nThis is $15 a month.\n\nLearned society and social club initiation fees and dues must amount to at least $2 monthly.\n\nUniversity gifts and supplies, type-writing, etc. We are constantly going into our pockets for small items which the university will not or cannot furnish without unbearable delay; or we may be working on lines of investigation which call for outlay. Say $1 a month.\n\nIn our case, our children are of the kindergarten and primary school age, so this item is only $9 a month.\n\nOlder colleagues, whose children have advanced to the music lesson and preparatory school age, say they must allow $50 to $60 monthly.\n\nSome families belong to a church. We all have charitable instincts, we are of that class to which the call of needy or suffering humanity appeals.\n\nMay we allow $2 a month?\n\nOur education has given us a reﬁned appreciation of the drama, and we have a knowledge of and love for the best music. The annual foot-ball game is a social event which every loyal member of the college community is supposed to attend. We cut this out long ago. Grand opera exists for us only in the memory of our German days.\n\nLet us keep the spark alive by taking our wives once a month to a cheap concert; say $1.\n\nWe have children and friends; there are birthdays and anniversaries, as well as Christmas. Is $50 a year too much? This is $4 a month. Dinners, receptions, and the like, are not for us.\n\nOccasionally a man is jaded; he has a wild desire to “blow himself.” May he have $1 a month pocket money, to share with his wife?\n\nMost of us can shave ourselves, but we cannot cut our own hair, although we may invert a bowl over the heads of our youngsters, and trim around the edges.\n\nHere is another $1.\n\nWhen summer comes, a teacher is pretty nearly always exhausted. His work is trying and conﬁning. His family requires an occasional change of air.\n\nHis professional needs may call for a long journey to attend an important meeting of fellow workers, etc. For an average geographical location $100 a year, or $8.50 a month, is not too much to cover these items. For an exceptional location, like the extreme Paciﬁc coast, this item should be trebled.\n\nThe writer has known many colleagues whose education expenses had put them under obligations which they were pledged to repay. In most cases it takes ten years to wipe out these obligations. Sometimes at the end of this period not even the beginning of discharging the debt has been made. Our college professors often come from families whose means are small. The support of aged parents or other relatives may have to be borne by them in common with their brothers and sisters. Every man is apt to have some such claim on himself or his wife.\n\nTo cover these items let us allow him $10 a month.\n\nA few, a very few, of our colleges pay pensions to their old and worn-out teachers. In such cases perhaps there is no need for a man to lay aside something for his old age, or to make provision for his children’s start in life.\n\nPerhaps he owes a duty to his children, to give them as good an education and chance as he himself received. If so, he must begin to lay aside for it.\n\nWhere there is no pension, should he not aim, after thirty years of faithful service, to have $10,000 laid aside? He is not in a position to know of places where he can get large returns on his small investments.\n\nShall we allow him $250 a year to put aside (providing there are no “exceptional and unusual” expenses that year, as there always are)?\n\nLet us say $20 per month.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThese are certainly not great demands. Yet, summing them up, taking the smaller of the two when two sums are mentioned, we have $262.50 monthly, or $31501 per year. Let us talk no more of bad management,—we and our wives face an impossible problem.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIf this seems extravagant to those who have to determine upon the proper minimum compensation for a man of long training, education, and reﬁnement, we must ask them to look over these items carefully, one by one, and put down what they think a fair sum for each item for a family of the college professor’s social status. Then let them foot up the total. The average college professor’s salary, in the United States, is about $2000.2 The inevitable deduction from the table of analyzed expenses, borne out by the experience of the writer and of all of his colleagues whom he has consulted, is that this must be increased sixty per cent, —the increase to be uniform in all grades, from instructor to head professor.\n\nIf the profession of teaching is to attract the highest type of efficient manhood, a living salary must be paid. A man who devotes his life to the cause of the advancement of education must feel a “call ” to it. He should be of a type which joyfully relinquishes all desire to accumulate worldly wealth or to live in luxury. Large salaries, commensurate with what equal ability would bring in other lines of work ($10,000 to $50,000), might be just, but would be undesirable, as they would tend to serve as bait to attract mercenary and lower types of men.\n\nBut a man ﬁt to occupy a chair in a university should be paid enough to enable him to live in decency and comfort, rearing and educating his children, and retiring in his old age to something other than absolute penury.\n\nThe writer would commend a careful study of his table to all college trustees.\n\nCan a man, whose energies are spent in so unequal and impossible a struggle to make both ends meet, maintain freshness and vigor in his work, be an inspiration to his students, and fulﬁll in scholarship the promise of his early years? The alternative demanded by the conditions is celibacy.\n\n1 The difference between this sum and the writer’s average of $2,794.27 is accounted for by the fact that he has saved nothing, and that his accounts begin with his ﬁrst year of married life, when both his wife and he were well supplied with clothing, books, pictures, and certain items of household furnishings. No children and no servant for the ﬁrst two years. Owning our own home since the second year, we have not included anything for rent or interest.\n\n2 This includes not merely full professors, but the other ranks as well.\n\nSource: The Atlantic Monthly, vol. 95, no. 5 (May, 1905), pp. 647-650.\n\nRobert M. Haig was a public finance economist at Columbia University, the successor to Edwin R. A. Seligman as McVickar Professor of Political Economy. In Haig’s papers is the following memo from James Angell (the “Executive Officer”, i.e. chairperson, of the department of economics within Columbia’s faculty of political science) reporting the results of a 1950 survey of former graduate students in the department. Just under 1,200 questionnaires were sent out. The response rate was about one-third. Duration data for different stages of graduate study, occupations/salaries in 1950 by final completed stage of graduate study were tabulated.\n\nA gender breakdown for occupation/salaries is also provided. It is interesting to note that the 1950 gender gap between men and women for people with economics Ph.D.’s from Columbia (1931-50) who were teaching was 7.2%.\n\nIn current prices, the average 1950 salaries of the economics Ph.D.’s from Columbia (1931-50) were: $59,000 (teaching); $88,500 (government); $94,000 (other economics related work); $108,000 (all non-economic-research related work).\n\nNote: The urban CPI has increased by a factor of 9.9 since then: (CPI July 1950 24.1, July 2015 238.7).\n\n_____________________________\n\nJune 20, 1951\n\nTo: The Members of the Department of Economics\n\nFrom: James W. Angell\n\nSubject: Occupations and Salaries of Our Former Graduate Students\n\nLast summer, in order to improve our records on former graduate students in the Department, brief questionnaires were sent out to the 1,182 students who had received the M.A. degree, or passed the Ph.D. oral examination, or received the Ph.D. degree, in the twenty years 1931-1950. We were primarily concerned to obtain their present addresses and occupations, but we also asked for the dates when the several academic standings had been achieved, and for the latest (1950) salary.\n\nWe received only 377 replies, or 32 per cent of the number of questionnaires sent out. Of the total sent, 84 questionnaires, or 7 per cent, were returned because the Post Office could not locate the addresses.\n\nIt is probably that the replies received do not constitute a representative sample, especially with respect to salaries: in the main, the less successful students are presumably those who are less likely to reply to such inquiries. But a partial check of the names of those who did not reply shows that this was not always so. A number of the group who did not reply are known to be holding good positions.\n\nAn analysis of the replies has been made by our colleague, Frank W. Schiff chiefly with respect to (1) the time intervals between the dates of achievement of the several academic standings, (2) present (1950) occupation, and (3) present (1950) salary. Not all those who replied answered all the questions, and the several group totals are hence not always consistent. The various results are summarized in the following tables.\n\nNumber of Replies, Grouped by Half-Decade When Highest Academic Standing Achieved by Student Was Attained: 1931-1950\n\nHighest Standing Attained Years\n\nTotal Replies\n\nM.A. Passed Orals\n\nPh.D.\n\n1931-35\n\n39 18 4 17\n\n1936-40\n\n60 26 11\n\n23\n\n1941-45\n\n68 26 12\n\n30\n\n1946-50\n\n210 126 48\n\n36\n\n1931-1950 377 196 75\n\n106\n\nTable 2 shows the arithmetic average of the number of years which were required to move from one level of academic standing to another. Because the number of observations is small, extreme values have considerable influence. It was felt that eliminating a few extreme values would hence give a more representative result; but the unadjusted totals are also shown, for comparison. The retarding effect of the war is conspicuous in most cases. Table 3 shows the distribution for each stage, over the period as a whole, of the numbers of years required; and the median values to the nearest whole year (these values in some cases differ markedly from the arithmetic averages shown in Table 2).\n\nAverage (Arithmetic) Number of Years Elapsed Between Dates of Attainment of Levels of Academic Standing: 1931-1950 (Extreme Values Omitted)\n\nYears\n\nA.B. to M.A. A.B. to Orals A.B. to Ph.D. M.A. to Orals M.A. to Ph.D.\n\nOrals to Ph.D.\n\n1931-35\n\n2.8 6.2 9.4 3.7 6.3 2.5\n\n1936-40\n\n2.4 5.2 10.8 3.1 7.6 3.1 1941-45 2.3 4.7 9.8 2.9 7.1\n\n3.7\n\n1946-50 3.6 6.6 11.7 2.2 9.3\n\n5.6\n\n1931-1950a\n\n3.0\n\n5.8 10.6 2.8 7.8\n\n4.1\n\nNumber of observations before adjustment\n\n324\n\n155 98 145 87\n\n78\n\nNumber omitted\n\n20\n\n6 3 9 2\n\n3\n\n1931-50: unadjusted averagesa\n\n3.8\n\n6.4 11.2 3.5 8.4\n\n4.5\n\naArithmentc averages for the whole period, not of the averages for the sub-periods.\n\nDistribution, by Numbers of Years, of Periods Elapsed Between Dates of Attainment of Levels of Academic Standing, 1931-1950\n\nNumber of Years Elapsed\n\nA.B. to M.A. A.B. to Orals A.B. to Ph.D. M.A. to Orals M.A. to Ph.D.\n\nOrals to Ph.D.\n\n1-2\n\n179 31 0 78 3 28\n\n3-4\n\n56 32 2 31 12 18\n\n5-6\n\n36 28 11 12 19 15 7-8 19 26 19 13 18\n\n8\n\n9-10\n\n11 13 15 2 16 3 11-12 5 11 21 5 8\n\n4\n\n13-14\n\n6 7 13 3 3 1 15-16 7 2 7 0 5\n\n0\n\n17-19\n\n2 2 4 0 0 1 20-29 2 2 4 1 2\n\n0\n\n30-40 1 1 2 0 1\n\n0\n\nTotals 324 155 98 145 87\n\n78\n\nMedians\n\n2 6 11 2 8\n\n4\n\nIt is interesting to note that although the sum of the medians of the numbers of years elapsed between A.B. and M.A., plus M.A. to Orals, plus Orals to Ph.D. is only eight, the median for that relatively small number of students (less than one-third of the whole sample: Table 1.) who actually covered the whole course to the Ph.D. itself is 11 years. This is presumably due in largest part to the fact that relatively few students had the financial means to go straight through from A.B. to Ph.D. without interruption. Most of them had to take time out to earn more money.\n\nTable 4, taken from a study by Professor Stigler, compares data for Harvard and Columbia.1 The Harvard students may or may not be brighter; but the substantially greater financial assistance given to students at Harvard must also help to account for the conspicuous differences in most years and fields.\n\nAverage Number of Years Elapsed Between A.B. and Ph.D. at Columbia and Harvard, 1900-1940\n\n1900\n\n1910 1930\n\n1940\n\nNatural Sciences\n\nColumbia\n\n7.6 8.0 9.4 9.2 Harvard 6.8 8.3 6.2\n\n6.1\n\nSocial Sciences\n\nColumbia\n\n4.3 9.8 10.3 12.9 Harvard 4.8 4.5 10.5\n\n8.7\n\nHuman-ities\n\nColumbia\n\n4.7 9.3 13.9 14.3 Harvard [6.3] [9.2] [7.9]\n\n[8.8]\n\nAll Fields\n\nColumbia\n\n6.3 9.2 10.8 11.7 Harvard 6.2 8.4 8.0\n\n7.8\n\n1George J.

But not all the replies received contained data on salaries, so that this sample is 12 per cent smaller than that used for Table 5 (331 replies instead of 377). The omissions are fairly uniform by major groups, however, and to avoid complicating the Table, the absolute numbers of relies in each group are not given. The few groups in which high average salaries were reported each contain, regrettably, only 1 to 4 cases; even the $10,300 group (Ph.D.’s, Other Economic Work, 1936-40) has only 5 members. It should also be emphasized that the data cover salaries only, not total earnings. Royalties, lecture fees and the like are not included. Thirty-one, or 9.4 per cent of the total, reported salaries of $10,000 or more.\n\nAll figures are arithmetic averages for the relevant groups. Thus the first column shows the averages for the entire period, 1931-1950, not the averages of the sub-period averages. Since the lowest-paid group (1946-50) is also much the largest (Table 1), the averages for the period 1931-50 as a whole are in one sense heavily biased downward. For example, for the period as a whole the average salary as computed by averaging the sub-period figures is $6,579, not $5,714.\n\nAverage Salaries in 1950, Grouped by occupations and by Half-Decades When Highest Academic Standing Was Attained: 1931-1950\n\nHighest Academic\n\nStanding Attained\n\nEntire Period 1931-50\n\n1931-\n\n35 1936-\n\n40 1941-\n\n45\n\n1946-\n\n50\n\nM.A.: aver-ages\n\n$4,772\n\n$6,709 $6,830 $5,534\n\n$3,988\n\nTeaching\n\n3,891\n\n5,294 5,525 3,980\n\n3,503\n\nGovern-ment\n\n5,436\n\n8,113 6,867 5,881\n\n4,110\n\nOther economic work\n\n5,123\n\n7,890 11,150 5,371\n\n4,240\n\nAll other\n\n4,660\n\n4,625 4,900 12,000\n\n3,935\n\nPassed Orals: aver-ages\n\n5,862\n\n11,375 7,055 6,738\n\n4,709\n\nTeaching\n\n4,066\n\n— 5,438 4,737\n\n3,783\n\nGovern-ment\n\n6,993\n\n7,250 6,450 8,340\n\n5,760\n\nOther economic work\n\n7,887\n\n15,500 8,975 —\n\n5,711\n\nAll other\n\n16,000\n\n— — —\n\n16,000\n\nPh.D.: aver-ages\n\n7,175\n\n8,593 7,719 6,691\n\n6,622\n\nTeaching\n\n5,964\n\n7,700 6,009 6,077\n\n5,017\n\nGovern-ment\n\n8,936\n\n8,350 8,900 9,360\n\n8,808\n\nOther economic work\n\n9,494\n\n17,250 10,300 6,480\n\n11,167\n\nAll other\n\n10,900\n\n— — —\n\n10,900\n\nTotals: aver-ages\n\n5,714\n\n8,089 7,240 6,306 4,679 Teaching\n\n4,806\n\n7,023 5,786 5,531\n\n3,979\n\nGovern-ment\n\n6,523\n\n7,904 7,358 7,628\n\n5,331\n\nOther economic work\n\n6,592\n\n10,495 9,973 5,833\n\n5,031\n\nAll other\n\n5,963\n\n6,166 4,900 12,000\n\n5,747\n\nTable 6 makes no differentiation between men and women. Of the 377 replies received, 73 (19 per cent) were from women. Of these women, 49 were regularly employed in 1950 and reported their salaries. Of the remaining 24, most were apparently married (though information on marital status was not requested), and either not working for a salary or only working part-time.\n\nTable 7 therefore shows the break-down for average salaries as between the 282 reporting men and the 49 reporting women who were regularly employed in 1950. There is no category for “unemployed;” no respondent, with one possible exception, reported difficulty in finding employment.\n\nIt is striking that although the average salaries for women usually run well below those for men in comparable brackets, the difference for teachers in the various categories is relatively small.1 The table also does not indicate the wide dispersions for the several groups of women. In 1950 2 women Ph.D.’s were earning $10,000 or more.\n\n1No significance should be attached to the fact that the average salary for all women in teaching slightly exceeds the salary shown for men. These figures are not comparable because a much higher percentage of women teachers who reported were in the Ph.D. category than of men teachers.\n\nFor the group as a whole, 28 men and 3 women were earning $10,000 or more in 1950.\n\nAverage Salaries in 1950 (Table 6), Grouped by Sex: for Entire Period, 1931-1950\n\nMen\n\nWomen\n\nAll Graduates\n\nNum-ber\n\nAver-age Salar-ies\n\nNum-ber\n\nAver-age Salar-ies\n\nNum-ber\n\nAver-age Salar-ies\n\nM.A.: aver-ages\n\n134\n\n$4,843 30 $4,455 164\n\n$4,772\n\nTeaching 43 3,923 7 3,695 50 3,891 Govern-ment 34 5,758 12 4,524 46 5,436 Other economic work 37 5,129 8 5,125 45 5,123 All other 20 4,734 3 4,173 23 4,660\n\nPassed Orals: aver-ages\n\n62 5,939 6 5,066 68\n\n5,862\n\nTeaching 37 4,066 — — 37 4,066 Govern-ment 10 7,480 4 5,775 14 6,993 Other economic work 13 8,538 2 3,650 15 7,887 All other 2 16,000 — — 2 16,000\n\nPh.D.: aver-ages\n\n86 7,368 13 5,892 99\n\n7,175\n\nTeaching 53 6,033 10 5,600 63 5,964 Govern-ment 18 8,936 — — 18 8,936 Other economic work 13 10,100 3 6,666 16 9,494 All other 2 10,900 — — 2 10,900\n\nTotals: aver-ages\n\n282\n\n5,854 49 4,912 331\n\n5,714\n\nTeaching 133 4,803 17 4,816 150 4,805 Govern-ment 62 6,959 16 4,837 78 6,523 Other economic work 63 6,858 13 6,300 76 6,592 All other 24 6,186 3 4,173 27 5,963\n\nSource: Robert M.

Henry Schultz, the young hot-shot professor for mathematical economics and statistics wanted a fully-automatic Monroe calculator with an electric motor drive (pictured above). With discounts, the calculator and stand cost $631. To get a relative price (in a hurry), I note that the nine month salary for Henry C. Simons at the rank of Lecturer was $2790, i.e. $310 per month. Thus figure that calculator-with-stand ran roughly two months of (approximately) instructor rank pay today.\n\nRecommendation to appoint Henry C. Simons May 20, 1927: University of Chicago Archives. Office of the President, Mason Administration. Box 24, Folder 2.\n\nCf. a request to purchase two calculators for the use of the Columbia University economics faculty in 1948.\n\n_______________________\n\n[carbon copy]\n\nJanuary 8, 1928\n\nMr. J. C. Dinsmore [Purchasing Agent]\n\nFaculty Exchange\n\nMy dear Mr. Dinsmore:\n\nI am enclosing a requisition against the instruction fund of the Department of Economics for $652.13 [sic] which is to cover the purchase of the following material:\n\n1 Monroe Machine – KAA 203…$825.00\n\nless 15% and 10%…….$631.13\n\n1 Fowler Manson Sherman Stand (low)… 21.00\n\nTotal $651.13\n\nProfessor Henry Schultz is anxious to have these articles delivered as promptly as possible. Will you please telephone me when they arrive so that I can tell you to what room they should be delivered.\n\nSo that there will be no delay in the attached requisition being approved promptly, I quote a paragraph taken from a letter of September 24 from Mr. Woodward to me:\n\n“I have arranged with Mr. Plimpton for you to draw on the instruction budget of the Department of Economics for the sum of $2600 in order to provide Mr. Schultz with equipment, supplies, and clerical assistance. It should be clearly understood that this arrangement is for the present year only.”\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nL. C. Marshall [chairman of the department]\n\nLCM: GS\n\nSource: University of Chicago Archives. Economics Department. Records & Addenda. Box 6, Folder 2.\n\n_______________________\n\nAbout the KAA model:\n\n“Model KA from 1922 was the first Monroe calculator with an electric motor drive. The machine has an AC induction motor of about 5″ diameter mounted externally on a cast-iron bracket at the left-hand rear. The motor occupies the dead area under the extended carriage, and so requires no additional desk space. The motor rotates in one direction only at 1500RPM. The mechanism is driven through a planetary gearset, with two dog clutches operated by the Add and Subtract bars to select forward or reverse rotation. The case has been widened by an inch and a half to accommodate the control mechanisms on the left-hand side. The winding handle has been replaced with a knurled brass knob, but the crank can easily be re-fitted to operate the machine by hand.\n\nThe carriage has glass windows above the numerals, but carriage shift and register clearing are still manual. The item count knob is at the lower left of the keyboard, with an additional control lever at the upper left to silence the overflow bell.\n\n…[The] Monroe’s head office, which was in New York City until the mid-1920s.\n\nA fully-automatic variant (the Model KAA) was built during the mid to late 1920s. The KAA is wider again than the KA, and has a single column of “on-the-fly” multiplier keys to the left of the main keyboard.”\n\nSource: John Wolff’s Web Museum.
