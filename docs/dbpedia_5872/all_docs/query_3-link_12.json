        "text": "GERARD DEBREU, a French-born mathematician and economist who taught at Berkeley for three decades, pioneered what later became a widespread deployment of formal, and rigorous, mathematical analysis within economic theory. For his achievements, especially work regarding markets and the general equilibrium, he was awarded the Nobel prize in 1983.\n\nProbably Debreu’s ultimate contribution came in his comparative youth, when he played a leading role in advancing thinking on market- clearing pioneered by Adam Smith, who reasoned that the “invisible hand” would, through price adjustments, allocate goods optimally — an idea extended in the 19th century by Leon Walras.\n\nSmith and Walras contended that all markets — for goods and services, labour, other factors of production — should simultaneously clear, leaving supply and demand in equilibrium."
