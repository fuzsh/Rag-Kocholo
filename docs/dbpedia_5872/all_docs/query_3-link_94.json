        "text": "Maurice Allais, who won the Nobel in economic science in 1988 for his influential insights into markets, risk, interest rates and myriad other economic phenomena, died Saturday at his home near Paris. He was 99.\n\nThe French government announced his death.\n\nDr. Allais, the first Frenchman to win the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science, stood out for both the quality of his original thinking and how little it was noticed outside France.\n\nThe lack of attention can be explained by the fact that little of his work was translated into English. In part this was his own doing: until late in his career he was reluctant to write in English, by far the preferred language of the economics profession.\n\nHis work on the theory of markets was carried out at the same time as similar work by the American economist Paul Samuelson and the British economist John Hicks, both of whom won Nobels in the 1970s. His mathematical proof that classic markets function as efficiently as Adam Smith had theorized provided the groundwork for his pupil Gérard Debreu to win a Nobel in 1983.\n\nDr. Allais (pronounced al-LAY) discovered what came to be called the “golden rule” of economic growth: real income is accumulated most efficiently when the interest rate is equal to the growth rate of the economy. This concept presaged work by Edmund Phelps and Robert Solow, both of whom won Nobels, as well as the ascension of the monetary theories of Milton Friedman.\n\nDr. Samuelson in 1958 independently, and unknowingly, recreated the research that Dr. Allais did a decade earlier on how to construct economic models that span generations. Dr. Samuelson once said that had the early works of Dr. Allais been available in English, “a generation of economic theory would have taken a different course.”\n\nDr. Allais wrote more than 1,000 articles and three dozen books, all crammed with complex mathematical formulas. But he also found time to advise the French government on economic issues: his analyses of monopolies was used by the government to set prices for the railways, utilities and mines it owned after World War II.\n\nMaurice Felix Charles Allais was born in Paris on May 31, 1911, to parents who owned a small cheese shop. His father died in a German prison camp during World War I, and he was raised by his mother on the edge of poverty. A mathematics teacher persuaded him to study science rather than history.\n\nHe excelled at top schools and universities, studying both engineering and economics. He witnessed the devastation of the Depression on a trip to the United States in the 1930s, later referring to the inspiration provided by “a graveyard of factories.”\n\n“I needed to know why,” he wrote of the experience. “My motivation was an idea of being able to improve the conditions of life, to try to find a remedy to many of the problems facing the world. That’s what led me into economics. I saw it as a way of helping people.”\n\nDr. Allais earned his doctorate from the University of Paris in 1949. He had already worked as a top bureaucrat in France’s national mines administration, served in the French army and written his two most influential books, “In Quest of an Economic Discipline” (1943) and “Economy and Interest” (1947).\n\nIn 1953, he came up with a new way of thinking about economic decision-making by providing convincing mathematical proof that people often put emotional considerations first. His theory, overturning classical economic thought, came to be called the Allais paradox.\n\nDr. Allais’s wife, the former Jacqueline Bouteloup, died in 2003. He is survived by a daughter.\n\nDr. Allais’s hobby of experimental physics was as intellectually challenging as his profession. He conducted well-regarded experiments with pendulums on gravity and magnetism, the results of which he and some other scientists thought contradicted the theory of relativity. Most people considered them inconclusive.\n\nHe also enjoyed commenting on current events, often questioning economic orthodoxy. For example, he thought protectionism, derided by free-market purists, could be justified as a means for countries to protect themselves from the pressures of globalization. And a remark he made about Wall Street in an interview with The Los Angeles Times in 1989 has been echoed by many others since, particularly in recent times. He called it “a veritable casino.”"
