        "text": "Research universities are colleges and universities whose faculty are active in research and publishing. Research universities offer a wide array of doctoral programs, especially in the sciences. They tend to be big, with tens of thousands of students.\n\nDo you prefer a larger university setting, such as largest public university in your state? Research universities are typically big, offering degrees in many different disciplines.\n\nIs a big high-powered research environment the thing for you? If not, you should think about a liberal arts college. In deciding on an undergraduate institution, ask yourself what sort of environment will best help you to be happy and excel.\n\nConsider whether you are self motivated enough to be a face in the crowd for some classes and largely unknown on campus at a large university. Of course you can find clubs and friends at a large university, but often liberal arts colleges have a more personal quality to them. If you want the community feel, a research university may not fit you well.\n\nAre you interested in STEM fields? Research universities have that name for a reason â real research is happening there. This can create an exciting atmosphere for students interested in STEM. Attending a research university can give you a better chance of getting into better programs for graduate degrees, although a lot of that depends on your performance.\n\nBack to Top\n\nOften referred to as âteaching collegesâ liberal arts colleges put a premium on undergraduate studies and offers a broad range of subjects for students to study. A college of liberal arts typically provides smaller class sizes, more direct engagement with professors, and, most importantly, the opportunity to sample a wide range of subject areas on the way to a bachelorâs degree.\n\nDo you want your professors to know you? Liberal arts colleges strive to cultivate campus cultures that encourage tight bonds between professors and students.\n\nProfessors at these schools will typically conduct original research. Yet the best of these schools offer their faculty reduced teaching loads so that they can both be productive researchers and still have plenty of time for students (both in and outside the classroom).\n\nDo you want to feel like you know everybody? One of the most enticing features of a liberal arts college is that in very little time, you can feel like you know whoâs who, which can create strong friendships and make walks across campus more fun. While your sports teams may never be on ESPN, itâs more likely that youâll know the athletes as your peers.\n\nBeyond student and faculty relationships, itâs not unusual for the school president and other administrators to learn who you are. When faced with problems with your student account or the need to switch classes, this can be comforting during a stressful moment.\n\nBack to Top\n\nOnline colleges are typically the same colleges and universities you could attend in-person, but for certain degree programs the college or unviersity has made the degree programs available to be completed online. For over 5 million students, online degree programs allow students to earn their degrees in the most flexible format available.\n\nOnline degrees are as respected as the on-campus degrees you could earn from the same schools. Thereâs usually no distinction between the two degrees, and your degree and transcript will not say that the degree was earned online.\n\nOnline degree programs are offered by a vast majority of colleges and universities, and the number of offering continues to grow. Whether you are searching for an associate, bachelorâs, masterâs, or doctorate, thereâs a good chance you can earn your degree online from a respectable online college.\n\nAre you a self-driven student? Perhaps the hardest aspect of obtaining an online degree is whether you will be disciplined enough to manage your time and course demands.\n\nMany online students report that online college made them more disciplined in all areas of their lives, but the flexible, self-paced learning that makes online colleges attractive can often be the same qualities that make it difficult. If you tend to be a procrastinator, you need to be honest with yourself. You can change your habits and propensities, or you can throw money down the drain.\n\nDo you need the flexibility of an online degree program? Most online students study online because of time demands of balancing work and life, or because the online college affords them the chance to attend a better school without moving.\n\nIf you are serious about earning your degree for career advancement, online colleges make it possible. The most flexible options among online degrees are those that are asynchronous, meaning you donât have scheduled times to meet with your class online. However, many students seek synchronous online degree programs so that they have some structure â set meeting times, scheduled exams, etc.\n\nThe good news is that attending an online college doesnât mean you will miss out on getting to know your professors and classmates. In fact, many online students who have experienced both online and on-campus courses report having easier access to their professors.\n\nSince most communication with your professor is expected to be in text â via email or your class learning management system â it makes asking your questions easier. The same students also report that they got to better know the thoughts of their classmates. While in-person course conversations can be dominated by a few extroverts, online courses that require online discussions make it so that you see all of your classmatesâ thoughts and questions.\n\nIf youâre interested in an online bachelorâs degree, check out what the best online colleges offer, or search our online degrees for the exact program that interests you. In either case, you will find well respected colleges and universities that offer online degrees.\n\nBack to Top"
