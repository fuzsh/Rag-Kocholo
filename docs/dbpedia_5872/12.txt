Gerard Debreu, a former University of California-Berkeley economist who won a Nobel Prize for breakthroughs in the study of supply and demand, has died, his family said. He was 83.

Debreu died on December 31 in Paris, said his son-in-law, Richard De Soto. Debreu had suffered a series of strokes and had been in an assisted living centre in the French capital.
