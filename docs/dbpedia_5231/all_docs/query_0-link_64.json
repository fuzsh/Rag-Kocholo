Introduction  Watermelon is a globally important vine & juicy Cucurbitaceous crop and it is grown widely in China, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, Brazil, India, Algeria, Turkey, Iran, Russia, Uzbekistan, Mexico, U.S.A and other Middle East countries besides Bangladesh  Fruits of watermelon are nutritionally rich and it contains different kinds of important health promoting vitamins, minerals and anti oxidants (Rabbany et.al., 2013).  Basically it is a dry season crop and in Bangladesh it is grown in the late Rabi season.  Besides ‘Char land’ watermelon is also cultivated in the low-lying areas, lands adjacent to hilly regions and also in the plain lands of Bangladesh.  During the Bengali dry months of Chaitra & Baishakh (March –April) when everybody feel uneasy due to hot sunny days and excessive dry weather condition then this watermelon fruits give a big relief to the Bangladeshi people as the watermelon fruits become available during that period. And its mesmerizing taste as well as juicy red colored flesh quenches the thirst of its people by giving a huge satisfaction as it contains 90% water in its flesh ( Sarker et.al., 2017).  In Bangladesh, annually watermelons are cultivated in near about 25,740 hectares of land and 6,00,514 metric tons of watermelons are produced with an average production of 23.33 Mt/ha. Only in the 8 regions of Potuakhali district 13,718 hectares of watermelon is cultivated.\n\n3. Contd…….  Besides its tastier juicy flesh its rind is also consumed in the preparation of culinary Bangla food items.  In Bangladesh it is mainly cultivated in the districts of Patuakhali, Bhola, Borguna, Noakhali, Pirojpur, Bagerhat, Sunamganj, Pabna, Natore, Panchagarh, Gopalganj, Jhenaidah, Chuadanga, Feni, Satkhira etc.  In Bangladesh different types of watermelon viz., plain whitish green rind colour, blackish green rind colour, black, green stripe in light green background rind, yellow rind with red inner flesh etc. are cultivated.  Besides red colored flesh, watermelon having yellow flesh are also sold here in Bangladesh  Watermelon with different shapes and sizes including oblong, oval shaped, oval round, round, elongated etc. are cultivated in Bangladesh  Grafted watermelons (using bottle gourd or pumpkin root stock) produce high quality watermelons and also gives higher yield.  It is also cultivated on trellis in some areas of Bangladesh in the off season  In the Southern part of Bangladesh it is hugely cultivated and it is one of the major crop grown here and watermelons of this region have a high demand in the market due to its high quality.  Both hybrid and Open Pollinated (O.P) varieties are cultivated by the growers but the demand of hybrid varieties is much higher than the O.P varieties.\n\n4.

BRAC Activities on Watermelon Research • Since we have no better quality released high yielding watermelon variety in Bangladesh our watermelon research activity is totally variety screening oriented. • Top quality exotic watermelon varieties are collected from the agents of different reputed foreign companies and/or seed samples are collected from annual APSA conference and are given trial in major water melon growing areas to select suitable watermelon variety/varieties before marketing. • Seeds of selected best watermelon variety/varieties through variety screening are thus imported and these exotic varieties are sold to the growers through dealers. • So far, 6 watermelon varieties (4 hybrid varieties & 1 OP variety) have been released from BRAC for commercial cultivation. • The name of the hybrid varieties are ‘Long Dragon’ ‘Super Alexander’, ‘New Dragon’, ‘Black Bull’ & ‘Abe Dragon’ while the name of the OP variety is ‘Feng bao’.\n\n8. Watermelon Variety Screening (2009-10) Four exotic watermelon varieties along with the check variety were evaluated in Thakurgaon district to identify suitable variety/varieties for marketing. Seeds were sown on 14.01.10 in sandy loam soil rich plot maintaining 2.5 m X 2.0 m spacing. Standard production practices were followed so that each variety can express their performances accurately Data on morphological as well as yield contributing characters were collected and analyzed critically at the end of the season.\n\n9.

Variety Screening Trial During the Year 2012-13 Fifteen exotic watermelon varieties were selected for conducting variety screening trial along with four suitable check varieties in Santhia, Pabna. Seeds were sown on 02.02.13 in farmers plot and standard cultural practices were followed to raise a good crop. Harvesting of watermelons was started from 119 days. All along 5 exotic varieties were found to be promising.  One yellow rind watermelon line was selected for trellis cultivation.\n\n13.

Yellow Flesh Watermelon An uncommon early season type Yellow Flesh Watermelon variety (harvesting 7-8 days ahead than other varieties) evaluated in a farmer’s plot at Amkhola Char, Golachipa , Potuakhali, Bangladesh with other 9 different type of watermelon varieties as a part of BRAC on farm evaluation of watermelon program. Its performance was found to be satisfactory compared to other varieties. Major characteristic features of this variety are: 1. Normal type crop growth & development, moderate spreading habit. 2.Almost roundish oval type fruit, fruit wt. around 6-7 kg. 3.Attractive orange yellow colored flesh with brownish yellow seed. 4.Crispy compact juicy flesh and complete absence of hollowness in the fruit. 5. Relatively less seed in the unique type flesh and very sweet taste (TSS = 12- 130Brix). 6. Yield 50-60Mt/ha.\n\n37.

Cultivation of BRAC Watermelon Variety ‘Black bull’ in the Off season Since in Bangladesh watermelon fruits are now available throughout the year therefore, seeds of widely adapted variety of BRAC watermelon ‘Black bull were sown in Ishwardi, Pabna, in the last week of March (Sowing date: 21.03.19) and its fruits were harvested in middle of June (harvesting date; 15.06.19). Nice fruiting was observed and good quality watermelons were harvested and sold in the market at higher price as the supply of watermelons in this period was very few.\n\n39. ‘Black Bull’ in the off season at Ishwardi\n\n40. Performance of Promising Watermelon Line ‘Tiger’ in 2 successive years During the year 2017-18 season through variety screening trial in Ulania, Golachipa among the 20 exotic varieties; variety ‘Tiger’ (code WM 11/17) was found to be promising and in the next year i.e. in 2018-19 same variety was given trial in Rangabali of same upazilla and same unique varietal characteristics having early flowering and good quality larger fruit was recorded.\n\n41.

Extra early season watermelon cultivation in Sunamganj District Watermelons are widely cultivated in Bangladesh in the late Rabi season. Here normally its seeds are sown in the month of December-January and its fruits are harvested during the month of April-May. But the practice of watermelon cultivation in the Tahirpur upazilla of Sunamganj district is quite different. Here the season starts during the month of September - October and the watermelons are harvested during the month of February. By selling the extra early season watermelon in the market, the growers earn 2-3 times more profit than the normal season. Therefore, BRAC watermelon variety 'Abe Dragon' has been cultivated in the extra early season this year (2019) at Tahirpur Upazilla, Sunamganj and its performance has been found to be promising. This trial also proved that 'Abe Dragon' watermelon variety is equally productive both in the normal season & also in the extra early season.\n\n44.
