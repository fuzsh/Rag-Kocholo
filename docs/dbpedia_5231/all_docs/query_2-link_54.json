        "text": "124 SHEIKH MUJIBUR RANMAN and a worker who was ready to give his all for the people. Moreover, he was idealistic and efficient. At that time no political organization was backing us. Our workers would campaign on feet and often go without food. Students in Dhaka were still involved in the strike. It was decided that all of us would head for Tangail. I would reach there on 19 April. On 16 April we found out that the Students' League convener Naimuddin Ahmed; the vice-president of the Salimullah Hall Student League, Abdur Rahman Chowdhury (now an advocate); Dewan Mahbub Ali (also an advocate now); and many others had secretly signed a bond with the university. Many who weren't Students' League members but self- proclaimed progressive students had also signed the bond. Indeed, out of twenty-seven students, almost half had put their signature to it. This was because they had been informed that if they had failed to sign it by the 17th they would be expelled from the university. When the news spread that the convener of the Students' League as well as the Salimullah Hall vice-president had signed the bond students got disheartened. I gathered as many of them as I could and tried to catch hold of Naimuddin. But it was difficult to track him down and he managed to elude us. Finally, we managed to get hold of him one evening in the house where he used to lodge then. He confessed that he had signed the bond and said, 'What else could I do? I had no other option. I have all sorts of problems.' I lost my temper with him. When I got back I summoned those Students' League workers still with us to a meeting that night. Many of them turned up. We decided at the meeting to expel students who had signed the bonds. We decided that we would print pamphlets at night and then distribute them in the university. Kazi Golam Mahbub was made our joint convener. He had been working for us selflessly all along. In those days law classes were held in the morning. The students of the law department went on strike and picketing began at 10 a.m. Student workers decided to lie down in front of the university gate. Only one girl student took an active part in the strike. Her name is Nadira Begum. She is Professor Munier Chowdhury's sister. She sat down in front of the gate with the male students. Only 10 to 15 students were supporters of the All East Pakistan Student League. They trampled all over the prostrate students. One of them began abusing Nadira in filthy language. The general students got upset at their actions. I saw what was going on and requested everyone to stay away from trouble. I told them, 'We have no objections if you want to attend classes or go in. But please don't trample over the protesting students. And please don't use obscene language.' They ignored us and kept going in and coming out of the gate, walking THE UNFINISHED MEMOIRS 125 over the striking students. I couldn't do anything about the situation. By now many students had gathered on the spot. They now attacked these disorderly students who fled upstairs and took refuge wherever they could. I stood in front of the gate and tried to prevent the enraged students from taking any further action. In any case, the strike was observed successfully. A meeting was held and the strike ended. Dr Osman Ghani was the provost of Salimullah Hall then. At the meeting of the executive committee he requested that the expulsion order against us should be withdrawn. Principal Ibrahim Khan supported him. However, the other members of the committee didn't agree to his proposal. The strike was held on the 18th as well. It was decided that there would be another strike the next day. It seemed to me that students on the whole were losing interest in the protest movement. On the afternoon of the 18th I concluded that there was no point in going ahead with the strike. We therefore went out in a procession that evening to the Vice Chancellor's house. We told him, 'We take our positions here and won't budge from this place till the expulsion orders are withdrawn.' We were going to have a hundred students sit down in front of the Vice Chancellor's residence through the day and night. We then took over the rooms in the ground floor of the Vice Chancellor's residence. We began to occupy these rooms turn by turn. This is how the 18th ended. However, I was the only one who stayed there all the time. This is because I came to know that the Vice Chancellor was planning to call the police at any moment. At 3 p.m. on the 19th a big contingent of police force arrived led by a district magistrate and an SP. I immediately asked the others to organize a meeting where they could elect a committee to carry on the movement. I felt that I should be ready to go to jail like the rest. The district magistrate gave us five minutes to leave the spot. I told eight of the students that they should stay put but asked the others to leave. The eight students and I did not budge from our positions. The student representatives felt that the movement had slackened and believed that my being arrested and sent to jail would give the movement a boost. I accepted their line of reasoning. When the five-minute deadline elapsed, the district magistrate ordered the police to arrest us. Tajuddin Ahmed (now general secretary of the Awami League) was among those hauled up although he had been told not to court arrest. He now did a smart thing by pretending he was a press reporter. He took out a slip of paper and started noting down the names of the students who had been arrested. This ruse worked and he was let off. I winked at him. They took us in a van and brought us to the jail. 126 SHEIKH MUJIBUR RAHMAN From the next day our protest movement gained momentum. A complete general strike was observed. Even those I had dissuaded from courting arrest got themselves arrested in the next three days. Among them were Khaleque Nawaz Khan, Kazi Golam Mahbub, Aziz Ahmed, Oli Ahad, Abul Hasnat, Abul Barkat, K.G. Mustafa and Bahauddin Chowdhury. They were all front-ranking workers of our party. It was obvious that we would be unable to continue the movement without them. Classes resumed and we remained in jail. Thirty to thirty-five of us had been arrested and were being held in Dhaka jail. We were in Ward 5, which was on the second floor. Some of us had been given the status of upper-class prisoners but others had been denied this privilege and had a more miserable time. For example, the food supplied to the latter group was not wholesome. Nevertheless, we decided that we would stick together and share whatever food was given to us. Those of us in jail belonged to two groups. Three were radicals and were called 'communists' by the rest. None of the three belonged to the Students' League. The rest of us did. We spent our time playing games. Barkat shared a room with me. At night he used to sing. He was good at it. We had some books with us and the jail library gave us access to some more. Everyone would spend some time studying. Since all of us were still students we were also quite naughty. Aziz Ahmed and I were the oldest of the prisoners. The jail physicians were authorized to recommend special diets for prisoners and were thus besieged with requests by us. Barkat exceeded all of us in naughtiness. Every time a physician came to see us he would cry out, 'My leg hurts. Please prescribe some eggs and milk for me.' Everyone would laugh at his antics. We would also spend hour after hour discussing politics. Only Bahauddin Chowdhury's parents lived in Dhaka. He was the youngest of us all and I was very fond of him. Bahauddin's mother would send him loads of food. He would share it with everyone. Still, when he went to sleep at night the others would gang up and raid his food or hide it. Bahauddin wouldn't rebuke them but would tell me about his plight. I would shout at the others. But no one would confess to having been party to the raids. The ones who stayed up at night playing cards were supporting them. Barkat was never able to hide anything from me and would tell me the truth. Khaleque Nawaz had a tough time too. He was very hirsute. Some of the boys would capture bedbugs and release them over his body. He would shout obscenities at them. In the evening we would play volleyball. Mr Amiruddin Khan was the superintendent. He was very fond of us. He THE UNFINISHED MEMOIRS 127 would provide us with whatever we needed. He had instructed everyone working in the jail to ensure that we were comfortable. One day I hurt myself in the arm while playing. I was in great pain and was unable to bear it any more. They were about to send me to Medical College. However, a physician who had just started working in the jail somehow managed to fix my arm and the pain began to subside gradually. In the end I didn't have to go to hospital. In my village home my parents had become quite upset when they heard about my condition. Renu and my daughter Hasina used to stay with them. Hasina had just learned to walk then. I received a letter from Renu in jail. My father also sent me some cash since Renu knew that I used to smoke and that I might have run out of money. She asked me to let her know if I needed more. They began to release us in ones and twos from the first week of June. The university had quieted down by now. Mr Shamsul Huq had managed to defeat the Muslim League candidate Khurram Khan Panni and was now an MLA. This was the first time the Muslim League had tasted defeat in Pakistan. They had to pay this price for indulging in coterie politics. We had been very apprehensive about the outcome of the elections when we were in jail. Mr Huq, on the other hand, had been unhappy with us because we had courted arrest instead of going to Tangail to campaign for him. However, when he found out what had really happened he saw that we had had no other option. How had the Muslim League, a party that had been so enthusiastically supported by people in 1947, tasted defeat so swiftly? It could be put down to coterie politics, rule of tyranny, inefficient administration and absence of sound economic planning. The country continued to be ruled according to British policies. But people had expected the administration to run according to different principles in a free land. They had hoped that after the English left they wouldn't be exploited and would truly get the opportunity to improve their lot. Now their hopes were belied. People were getting frustrated. Unfortunately, our leaders weren't bothered by the discontent being expressed by the masses. Jinnah's death had seen the birth of cliques and the beginning of the politics of conspiracy. Liaquat Ali Khan had now monopolized power. He couldn't tolerate anyone else. He used to talk about democracy but he never practised it. The people of East Bengal had loved and respected Jinnah. People had his name on their lips everywhere. When Liaquat Ali Khan became the prime minister, educated people expected that at the very least he would rule efficiently and follow the 128 SHEIKH MUJIBUR RAHMAN ideals of Jinnah, his guru. One wonders if things would have turned out differently if MrJinnah had left behind a constitution. Whatever he did or had to say used to be accepted by the masses. Liaquat Ali Khan failed to wield that kind of power. When Jinnah was the Governor General he made very good use of the power vested in him. Khawaja Saheb was too amiable and weak to be effective. He didn't have much of a personality. Liaquat Ali didn't approve of the movement that we had launched. The leaders of his party in East Bengal had managed to mislead him about us. The prime minister of East Bengal, Nurul Amin, was too dependent on government officials and their reports. He began to believe the reports they had filed and act brutally on the basis of what he read in them. Even the defeat they suffered in the Tangail by-election didn't open their eyes or that of his cronies. The government party declared, 'No matter what has happened, Shamsul Huq will not be allowed to sit in the Legislative Assembly.' They filed a lawsuit against the election result. When Shamsul Huq came to Dhaka after having triumphed in the election, the people of Dhaka and its student community gave him a grand reception. They brought out a huge procession headed by him and went round Dhaka celebrating his victory. We enjoyed the whole spectacle from jail. On his return to Dhaka, the old Muslim League workers called a meeting of party workers in the city to discuss their future course of action. This meeting was scheduled for 23 June 1949. Most of us had been released from jail. Only Bahauddin Chowdhury and I were left in prison. Bahauddin, though quite young, wasn't being allowed to leave because he was suspected of being a communist. At this time they were imprisoning quite a few people under the Public Security Act on this ground. It is what we otherwise know as imprisonment without trial. Among the people thus imprisoned many had been in jail during British rule too. Now I found out how painful imprisonment could be. When they locked us in the evening I used to feel horrible. As soon as the sun set every prisoner was confined to his room, the door was locked and the counting of inmates began. I used to like listening to the stories the other prisoners had to tell about their lives and the good times and bad times they had been through. In those days it was illegal for prisoners to smoke or chew tobacco. However, political prisoners were exempted from this law. They could buy cigarettes and tobacco with their own money. Ordinary prisoners THE UNFINISHED MEMOIRS 129 would go crazy for a smoke. But the prison authorities would try anyone who was found smoking illegally. Prisoners would be delighted if the guards were generous enough to allow them to smoke a cigarette. I used to give the non-political prisoners a bidi or two to smoke, which they enjoyed furtively. People were gearing up for a grand meeting of workers. From our jail cells we came to know of the elaborate preparations going on. An office had been set up at 150 Mughaltuli. Shawkat Mia was looking after all the logistical details. Who else in Dhaka was competent enough to take care of food and accommodation matters? Yar Mohammad Khan, a veteran League worker of Dhaka, was assisting him. Mr Khan was resourceful in that he had the finances and the manpower to help. Advocate Ataur Rahman Khan, Ali Amjad Khan, and Anwara Khatun MLA were also helping them. We were anxiously awaiting the outcome of the preparatory work being done in the run-up to the meeting. They had contacted me for my views on the matter. I told them, 'There is no point in pursuing the Muslim League any longer. This party has now become the establishment. We shouldn't become part of the Muslim League even if they invite us to join them. This is because they now operate through coteries. They can no longer be called a party of the people. They have no policy at all.' They also wanted to find out from me whether I would like to continue to work in the student front or join the political organization they were thinking of creating. This was because if we didn't form an organization that could take on the role of the opposition this country would turn into a dictatorship. Some time back Mr Kamruddin had created an organization called Gana Azadi League but its activities never went beyond the paperwork he did. In the end, the meeting that the others were organizing was scheduled to be held in Mr Humayun's Rose Garden house since no halls or space was available. Prominent political leaders as well as workers attended this meeting. Sher-e-Bangla A.K. Fazlul Huq, Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhasani and Allama Maulana Ragib Ahsan were among those present. MLAs who attended included Khairat Hussein, Mrs Anwara Khatun, Ali Ahmed Khan and Habibur Rahman Chowdhury alias Dhonu Mia. Veteran leaders from different districts also joined the meeting. Everyone agreed on creating a new political organization. It was named East Pakistan Awami Muslim League. Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhasani was made its president, Mr Shamsul Huq its general secretary, and I the joint secretary. I read in the papers that I was identified in reports as a 'security prisoner'. However, it was my view that since Pakistan had been achieved there was no further reason to create a political organization tied to communal 130 SHEIKH MUJIBUR RAHMAN ideals. I was for a non-communal party based on a sound manifesto. In the end I decided that the time had not yet come for such an organization. Perhaps those who had devised the East Pakistan Awami Muslim League had created it after thinking over all the issues involved. A few days after the Awami Muslim League was formed, it was announced that Bahauddin and I would be released. My fellow workers must have heard of this announcement. When we left the jail gate we saw a large crowd led by Maulana Bhasani waiting to receive us. Bahauddin whispered to me, 'Previously nobody would have bothered to greet me with a garland but because I am accompanying you I will get at least one garland as my share.' I laughed and told him, 'If no one has a garland to spare for you I myself will deck you with one.' When we went out I saw that my father was waiting for me too. He had come all the way from our village home to greet me. I bowed down and touched my father's feet and did the same with Maulana Bhasani. At this time shouts of 'Long live Awami Muslim League', 'Long live Students' League' and, for the first time, 'Long live Awami League' could be heard. I greeted Mr Shamsul Huq and said, 'Mr Huq, your victory is the victory of the people.' He embraced me and said, 'Let's start moving.' Later the Awami Muslim League came to be known as the Awami League. A few people were made vice presidents of the Awami League. They were Mr Ataur Rahman Khan, Abdus Salam Khan, Ali Ahmed Khan and Ali Amjad Khan. There was someone else elected to this position but I can't remember his name now. The first meeting of the working committee of the Awami League was held at 150 Mughaltuli. Sher-e-Bangla A.K. .Fazlul Huq joined this meeting. A subcommittee to work on a constitution and another one to work out our future course of action were formed. We began working for the party in earnest. Shawkat Mia put up a huge signboard. He arranged for chairs, tables and everything else that we needed. Before I had been released from jail the Awami League had already held a public meeting at Armanitola Maidan. This was the first time Maulana Bhasani gave a public speech in Dhaka. The people of Dhaka had heard Mr Shamsul Huq before. Huq too was a good orator. The Muslim League had resorted to strong-arm tactics to prevent the Awami Muslim League from holding this meeting. Numerous people had gathered for the event but just as it was to start some hired goons damaged the microphone and smashed the stage that had been erected for the occasion. They beat up many of our workers too. Badshah Mia, who was notorious for his violent behaviour, used to live in Babu Bazar (Badamtali Ghat) at this time. He had a lot of followers who used to flex their muscles THE UNFINISHED MEMOIRS 131 and lord it over everyone else in these parts of Dhaka. He had been told that those who were working for the Awami League and organizing its meetings were out to destroy Pakistan. They should therefore be prevented from organizing any meetings in the area. He was paid 500 rupees to deploy his thugs to prevent us from holding the meeting. Badshah Mia came from a good family but he had got into bad company and had taken part in the Hindu—Muslim riots. Quite a few lawsuits had been filed against him for his role in them. After he had disrupted the proceedings and left, Mr Arifur Rahman Chowdhury, a long-time resident of the neighbourhood, went to him and said, 'Mr Mia, you've managed to break up our meeting. However, we're going to reorganize and start again. First listen to what we have to say before taking any further action. If you hear us saying anything contrary to Pakistan then go ahead and disrupt it once again'. Mr Chowdhury was very soft-spoken. He had been active in politics since the time of the Khilafat movement of the 1920s. He had sacrificed everything that he had for the nation and was a descendant of Barisal's Ulania family of zamindars. Badshah Mia and his gang members began to listen to the speeches being delivered from a street corner. After the first few speakers had delivered their speeches Badshah Mia went to the dais and declared, 'I have something to say. You'll have to let me speak.' Who had the guts to oppose him? For all practical purposes the whole of Armanitola Maidan was his fiefdom. Badshah Mia took the microphone and said, 'Muslim League leaders have misled us about you all. They gave me 500 rupees to break up your meeting. I have that money in my pocket now. It will be a sin for me to accept their money. I'm going to tear up the money in front of your eyes.' As he spoke, he took out a bundle of five-rupee notes and threw it at the audience. The notes began to fly all over the meeting. Some of the people present picked up a few of the notes while others tore them up. Badshah Mia went on to say, 'From this day onward I've decided to join the Awami League. I challenge anyone to disrupt an Awami League meeting in Armanitola Maidan from now on.' Members of the audience now garlanded Badshah Mia. Those present felt heartened by the incident. It was now obvious that the Muslim League had stooped to strong-arm tactics and had even paid thugs to disrupt Awami League proceedings. Indeed, they had no sense of shame and had been pursuing such tactics for a long time now. They continued to do so till we succeeded in forcing them to abandon such policies. They had made up their minds that they wouldn't allow any sort of opposition to their rule. Why didn't they realize that they had lost 132 SHEIKH MUJIBUR RAHMAN support among the masses and should now take steps to regain their confidence? Why had they attempted to use repressive measures against the opposition and resorted to force? I had just been released from jail, and my father had travelled to Dhaka in order to take me to our village home. I told my father, 'Please go home alone for now. I'll join you all in a week's time.' However, I needed money and had to return home soon to get some. Moreover, I had a strong urge to see my ageing mother and my wife and daughter. I sent word to Faridpur's Mr Salam that I would like to address a public meeting in Gopalganj and that he should be present there. A branch of the Awami Muslim League had been formed in Gopalganj. The old Muslim League committee had now become transformed into the Awami Muslim League committee. This was because the Government of Pakistan had facilitated the formation of a subdivisional Muslim League organizing committee consisting of the people who were our opponents. I left for home soon after I had sent the message to Mr Salam asking him to organize a meeting in Gopalganj. This meeting was actually held sometime in mid-July. Mr Salam agreed to take part in it and I came from my village home to speak on the occasion. Thousands of people were throngiig to the venue. In the morning all of a sudden the government imposed Section 144. We decided that we would hold the meeting in the mosque compound. If this meant breaking the law, so be it! The mosque was huge and the field in front of it was big enough to hold thousands of people. Mr Salam endorsed our plan. When the meeting began, the SDO entered the mosque premises and imposed Section 144 inside it. We protested. The police entered the mosque and started to beat up people. They used their batons and a scuffle ensued in which people and the police got hurt. Mr Salam and I expressed our unwillingness to leave the meeting. We were arrested. The people decided to encircle the mosque to prevent the police from taking us away. The police officers realized that they wouldn't be able to remove us from the spot and take us to prison or court without resorting to shooting at us. As far as we could tell, even the police personnel were reluctant to impose Section 144 inside the mosque and had to do so at the insistence of the SDO. When the subdivisional police officer saw that the public had blocked the roads, he realized that things had taken an ugly turn and that a violent outbreak was imminent. So he told Mr Salam and me, 'If there is THE UNFINISHED MEMOIRS 133 violence a lot of people will die. You will get bail immediately. Tell the people to disperse and remove the roadblocks. We will take you to court now and arrange for your bail.' It was evening by then. People had come to attend the meeting from far away. It was drizzling too. It was hard for us to predict how things would turn out in the dark. Many people who had come to the meeting had armed themselves with sticks and oars. The SDOs began to pressurize me in particular to speak to the crowd and placate them. Mr Salam and the Gopalganj subdivisional district leaders conferred with me and we decided that I would give a speech requesting the audience to disperse. I spoke to the crowd, had my say and requested everyone to remove the roadblocks and leave. The crowd had confined the police and us for a few hours already. Now the public decided to let us go. It took three minutes to travel from the mosque to the court. The public escorted us, chanting slogans supporting our movement. We were freed on bail at 8 p.m. The crowd then dispersed. This was the first public meeting organized by the Awami League outside Dhaka. What was notable was that the government had tried to prevent it by imposing Section 144. The next day the local Awami League held a meeting. Kazi Altaf Hussein was made the convener of the Gopalganj Awami League and the local Muslim League president. Advocate Kazi Mozzaffar Hussein was made the chair. Something that happened at this time is still etched in my memory. Kazi Altaf Hussein and I had decided that we would meet Maulana Shamsul Huq (now the principal of Lalbagh Madrasa). His house was in our union. People as a whole venerated him. The two of us took a boat to his house at 10 p.m. It was a small boat and it was operated by a single boatman. We were sailing on the river Modhumati and the boatman lived on its banks. On one bank of the river was Faridpur district and on the otherJessore and Khulna. At one point the river was very wide. We knew that river pirates were particularly active here. I had dozed off out of sheer fatigue and had no idea that our boat had reached this area. This was quite typical of those of us who grew up in this land of rivers. My companion, however, was still awake. Another boat soon came close to ours. The people aboard asked our boatman if we had some matches with us. This was a well-known gambit used by river pirates before raiding other boats. Coming still closer to our boat they said, 'Where is this boat going?' Our boatman said, 'To Tungipara,' which is the name of my village. They then asked him, 'Who is on the boat?' The boatman said that I was on it. One of the pirates immediately hit our man with an oar and saying, 'You swine, why didn't you tell us that this is the boat of our honoured Sheikh?' they left quickly. 134 SHEIKH MUJIBUR RAHMAN Our boatman came inside the passenger area of the boat and started weeping. This woke me up. Mr Hussein had hidden his watch and ring by this time. He was a rich businessman and liked to wear expensive things. I said to him, 'What's happening?' He and the boatman told me what had happened. Mr Hussein joked with me, 'The river pirates respect you a lot and we've survived just because your name came up. It was a close shave!' I replied, 'I guess they think I am one of them!' We had a hearty laugh at this. However, the boatman was inconsolable. His back had been badly hurt. We were therefore forced to moor the boat in a nearby village. As a result, we reached our destination at 10 a.m. even though we should have been there by daybreak. We found Maulana Huq in the madrasa. We conferred with him and left for our homes. I stayed back in our village home for a few days. My father was very upset when he heard that I didn't want to study law at Dhaka University any more. He said, 'If you don't want to continue your studies at the university go to England and get a bar at law degree from there. If necessary, I will sell my land to finance your studies.' I said, 'What is the point of my going to England now? I don't want to run after money by becoming a lawyer.' I was still angry at the Muslim League leaders. What they were doing with Pakistan was contrary to the Pakistan I had dreamed of Things needed to change. Ordinary people depended on us and would direct their questions at us. The country had become independent: why wasn't anything being done to alleviate their sufferings? Corruption had increased and there were reports of food scarcity. Political prisoners were being jailed without trial. Muslim League leaders seemed unwilling to accept Bengali as the state language. Already West Pakistan was seeing a lot of industrial activity. East Pakistan, on the other hand, was being ignored. The capital of the country was in Karachi and everything was concentrated in West Pakistan. East Bengal was getting nothing. I shared my thoughts about the situation and my plans for the future with my father. He said, 'You don't have to do anything for us. But you are married and have a daughter. You need to do something for their sake.' I said, 'You have managed to keep aside some land for us. If I can't manage to do anything I'll come back and do something here. But injustice shouldn't be left unopposed.' My father said nothing more to me. No sooner had I left my father than my wife, Renu, told me, 'How long do you plan to go on like this?' I realized that she had been listening to our conversation. Renu suffered a lot but she never complained. She used to do her best to save money for me so that I could be financially unencumbered. I returned to Dhaka. When I left Renu wasn't well at all. I still had my job THE UNFINISHED MEMOIRS 135 with the Ittehad newspaper. They still paid me but did so irregularly since they were facing financial difficulties. This was because the East Pakistan government would often ban the paper. Besides, newsagents would often not pay them for copies sold. The paper was more popular in East Bengal. When I came back to Dhaka I got involved in organizing the annual meeting of the Students' League as soon as possible. We were going to stage a council meeting for the first time. We all wanted elections immediately and I wanted to be relieved from my position. The conference was ultimately held in Dhaka's Tajmahal Cinema Hall and I presided over the session. In my speech I said, 'From this day I don't want to be a member of your organization. I don't have the right to be part of a student organization since I am no longer a student. I will therefore say goodbye to you all. But the people of East Bengal will never forget the part played by the Students' League in leading them forward. The sacrifices you have made to uphold the dignity of our mother tongue will always be in the minds of the people. You have also managed to play the role of the opposition. And without an opposition party democracy cannot flourish.' This was the sum of what I said on the occasion. I had written my speech down before speaking but I no longer have a copy of the speech. The elections were held next. Dabirul Islam, then in jail, became the president and Khaleque Nawaz Khan the general secretary. Nobody had any reservations about Dabirul Islam but not everyone was for Khaleque since he tended to be garrulous and often let his tongue run away with him. In the end I managed to convince everyone that he should be elected. The people present honoured my last request to them by electing him. But I must confess with the benefit of hindsight that the man I had succeeded in getting elected to the position of general secretary ended up doing more harm than good for the organization. This was because Khaleque wasn't able to take firm decisions despite the best intentions. He wasn't able to judge the pros and cons of issues put forward by others perhaps because he lacked the ability to do so. It was only because of the efforts of the Dhaka City Students' League General Secretary Abdul Wadud that the party set- up wasn't irreparably affected during Khaleque's tenure. Later Wadud became General Secretary of the East Pakistan Students' League. Although I had ceased being a member, the leaders of the organization kept in touch with me. I never hesitated to offer them advice when they needed it. They continued to respect me as the founder of the Students' League. 136 SHEIKH MUJIBUR RAHMAN After much hard work, Mr Shamsul Huq managed to produce a draft manifesto and the outline of a constitution for our party. He consulted us repeatedly during the process. We worked through consensus in our working committee meetings to help him formulate the manifesto and constitution. The meetings went on for a few days. Once in a while there were heated exchanges between Mr Huq and Maulana Bhasani on some points. One day Mr Huq became very upset and told the Maulana, 'You won't understand these things. This is because to understand them you need to be a highly educated person and that is precisely what you aren't.' The Maulana got so mad at this that he left the meeting in a huff. I went over to Mr Huq and told him that he shouldn't have said such a thing to the Maulana even if it was true. Mr Huq then went over to the Maulana, apologized to him, and persuaded him to return to our meetings. Mr Huq wasn't the type who nursed his wounds. Maulana Bhasani was given the responsibility of selecting the members of the working committee. We didn't like the people he had chosen at all. I said to him, 'Where did you get such people and why did you make them members of the working committee? They will leave us at the first opportunity.' The Maulana replied, 'What else could I do? I don't know too many people here. I chose from the names given to me by your students.' I said, 'Just you see what these people do in times of crisis.' The working committee adopted the draft manifesto. We decided that we would approve it at our council meeting. We would print the draft manifesto and circulate it before the meeting so that people would be ready with their proposals for consideration. We decided to get the draft ready to elicit public opinion on it. In it we proposed that East Pakistan be given complete autonomy. Only defence, foreign affairs and monetary policy would be vested with the centre. We also emphasized that Bengali would have to be made one of the major state languages of Pakistan. We had come up with many other economic and political programmes. We began to devote ourselves completely to organizational work. Maulana Bhasani, Mr Huq and I went to Jamalpur subdivision of Mymensingh for the first meeting. Mr Haider Ali Mollick, a lawyer of Jamalpur, had set up the Awami League there. Hatem Ali Talukdar, a student leader of the subdivision, had worked hard to make the meeting successful. When we reached the meeting site we saw that there was a huge turnout. Just when the meeting was to begin, ten to fifteen people started to shout. We decided to ignore them and went on with our programme. The leaders of our Jamalpur wing had decided that Shamsul Huq would preside over the meeting and Maulana Bhasani would be the chief speaker. THE UNFINISHED MEMOIRS But no sooner had we begun the meeting than we found out that Section 144 had been imposed. The police came and handed a piece of paper to the Maulana informing him of this. I said, 'I refuse to obey this injunction; I am going to give my speech regardless.' The Maulana stood up and said, 'Section 144 has been imposed. They won't let us hold the meeting but let us pray to God.' He then led the prayer. For half an hour he led the prayer and in the process he managed to say everything that he wanted to say. The police officers and staff had no option except to join him. By the time he had finished the Maulana had managed to insert a full speech into his prayer. The police and Muslim League people present could only watch helplessly! That night we had been invited to dinner and Maulana Bhasani accompanied us to the venue. But he was clearly upset and wouldn't eat. What had annoyed him was that Mr Huq had been asked to preside over the meeting and not he. This put us in a fix. I tried to point out to him how people would misconstrue his stance. But nothing I said could placate him. He felt that he had been insulted. Mr Huq also spoke out and expressed his dissatisfaction at the Maulana's outburst in public. This was the day I realized that the Maulana wasn't very broad-minded. Nevertheless, I used to respect him since he was ready to sacrifice everything for the cause of the people. To do anything great, one has to be ready to sacrifice and show one's devotion. I believe that those who are not ready to sacrifice are not capable of doing anything worthy. I was able to come to the conclusion that to engage in politics in our country one must be ready to make huge sacrifices to make our people happy. The Muslim League government, I was convinced, would continue to be repressive and would try to stay in power by adopting brutal means. But cowering from its oppression would only make us susceptible to more of the same treatment. The reputation of the Muslim League was being used to hoodwink people for the time being, but this wouldn't last forever. It was still able to cast a spell on people but if we could expose what was going on inside the League and if we could build an effective opposition to it the party would not dare adopt brutal tactics any more! We returned to Dhaka and called a public meeting at Arm anitola Maidan to address the food shortage crisis. People were living under miserable conditions. The Maulana presided over this meeting while Ataur Rahman Khan, Shamsul Huq and I spoke on the occasion, The Muslim League was planning to disrupt proceedings but since Badshah Mia had now joined us they didn't have the courage to do anything much. The result was a meeting that attracted an immense crowd. Nothing like this had happened 138 SHEIKH MUJIBUR RAHMAN before here. The people in general and the citizens of Dhaka in particular were now accepting us. Besides all of us speakers had been actively involved in the movement to attain independence for Pakistan. That is why the masses wouldn't be persuaded by any attempts to characterize us as 'enemies of the state'. After all, we had been in the forefront of that movement. Maulana Bhasani declared, 'When Mr Liaquat Ali Khan comes to Dhaka in October we would like to discuss the food situation and the issue of political prisoners and their release. If he refuses to meet us we'll have another meeting and then go to meet him en masse.' A few days later the newspapers reported that Mr Khan was scheduled to arrive in Dhaka on 11 October. The Maulana asked me to send him a telegram so that he could set up a meeting with a delegation representing our party. The telegram was sent in the Maulana's name. Mr Shamsul Huq was quite busy at this time with his marriage preparations. I therefore had to look after all the activities of the party. However, I would confer with Mr Huq all the time. He had told me that I should direct all the organizational activities of our party. We were so close that there was no possibility of misunderstanding between us. I could see that Maulana Bhasani was beginning to dislike Mr Huq. He would speak out against him at every opportunity. I would try my best to prevent a confrontation between the two of them. However, the Maulana didn't dare criticize him to his face. It will be unfair if I fail to record the contributions of Mrs Anwara Khatun who was a member of the Legislative Assembly and who would pitch in with her own money when the need arose. Mr Ataur Rahman Khan was also always available when his services were needed. He had no previous political experience and he wasn't politically astute. Nevertheless, he was well educated, sincere and ready to work for the party. I managed to develop a good rapport with him. In district after district Mr Suhrawardy's supporters had started to join the Awami League. At about this time Calcutta's daily Ittehad was on the verge of closing down. Mr Suhrawardy had left Calcutta for good for Karachi. Mr Manik Mia had also left Calcutta but when he reached Dhaka he had almost nothing with him. He too now lodged with us in Mughaltuli. Mr Suhrawardy himself had managed to come away with nothing much except a few clothes. The Indian government had confiscated all his possessions. Many will be surprised to hear that he didn't own a house in Calcutta. The house he lived in at 40 Theatre Road was a rented one. He had put up with his brother in Karachi because he didn't even have the means to feed himselfi THE UNFINISHED MEMOIRS 139 Of the older leaders of Dhaka, only Mr Kamruddin didn't join our party. Abdul Kader Sardar supported us financially. He had the financial resources as well as a loyal following and was therefore able to help. He had confronted the Khawaja family of Dhaka all his life. He used to help the poor and that is why the masses loved him. We hadn't been able to form our district committees as yet but there were a few exceptions. In Chittagong Mr M.A. Aziz and Zahur Ahmad Chowdhury and in Jessore the Pir Saheb of Kharki and Habibur Rahman headed the district committees. Mr Mashiur Rahman and Khaleque supported us but not openly. In Faridpur an organizing committee had been formed with the help of Salam Khan. We had decided that we would form branches of our party in every district by the end of 1949. We would head for the districts whenever we managed to get a break. The response was inspiring. The Nawab that he was, Liaquat Ali Khan did not feel that he had to condescend to reply to the Maulana's telegram. We of course knew that he was coming to Dhaka on 11 October. He had told journalists he had no idea what the Awami League was! We called another public meeting in Armanitola Maidan on 11 October. We had one microphone and our workers went around on a horse carriage to announce the date and time of the meeting. They were in Nawabpur Road when some hired goons of the Muslim League attacked them, around three or perhaps four in the afternoon. The goons beat up our workers and snatched away the microphone from them. There were three of our workers in the horse carriage at that time. It was as if there was no law and order in the country at all! Our workers came to our Mughaltuli Awami League office to report what had happened. I was in a meeting with eight or ten of our workers then. Some of them had managed to recognize a few of the assailants since they had worked together in the Muslim League not too long ago. I said, 'This is very unfair. Let's go to them and ask them why they have acted in this manner and demand our microphone back from them. It will be best if they return it. If not, what should we do? We can at least lodge a complaint with the police.' I took along with me the Students' League's Nurul Islam (he worked for the Ittefaq later) and Chawk Bazar's Nazir Mia and Abdul Halim (he is now joint secretary of the National Awami Party. At that time he was joint secretary of the City Awami League). We headed for their Victoria Park office since I had found out that they had reassembled there. They used to hang around the first floor of the Cooperative Bank building. 140 SHEIKH MUJIBUR RAF-IMAN When we reached the building we found them deep in discussion. I knew two of them, Ibrahim and Alauddin, from my Muslim League days. I said, 'Why have you snatched our microphone away? That is very unfair. Give it back to us.' They said, 'We didn't take it and have no idea who is responsible for it.' But we knew for sure that they had been present when the microphone was taken away from Nurul Islam. He said as much to them, pointing out that they had argued with him before snatching away the microphone. Right then two Awami League workers, Yar Mohammad Khan and Hafizuddin, were passing by in a rickshaw. I hailed Yar Mohammad and appraised him about what was happening. He was a long-time resident of the city. He came from a good family, was well-off, and had many people working for him. He told them, 'Why did you take away the microphone?' One of them replied, 'So what if we have?' At this Yar Mohammad raised his fist and hit the man. Halim landed a blow too. Their colleagues at the Muslim League now joined in and attacked us. Halim sprinted to his neighbourhood to assign people from there to defend us. The owner of Presidency Library, Mr Humayun, came out and took Yar Mohammad to his office. Meanwhile our opponents began to hail abuse on us from outside the office. I took a rickshaw and rushed to the Awami League office where I recruited some ten to twelve of our workers. Our opponents did not notice my exit; otherwise they would have targeted me. Hafizuddin took a rickshaw too and sped to Yar Mohammad's neighbourhood. Instantly, his brother, relatives, friends and neighbours thronged to the spot. Halim too came back with a group of men from his neighbourhood. Those who were abusing Yar Mohammad vanished immediately. Many members of the Khawaja family had joined hands with our assailants. A government minister had also witnessed the scuffle from the upper floor of a building in the neighbourhood. When I came back to the scene, the police had arrived. Yar Mohammad's men accompanied him and they attacked the local Muslim League office, which was just round the corner in Roy Saheb Bazar. There were some criminal elements in this neighbourhood. They used to beat up people and were basically goons for hire who specialized in beating up students. Whenever they saw our workers or students cross Roy Saheb Bazar in a procession they would swoop upon them and beat them up. Many workers and students had suffered because of their brutal activities. These goons were brought to justice at the mosque by the neighbourhood. At the time in old Dhaka petty justice was served at the neighbourhood mosque, where the accused was brought forward and socially tried. If found guilty, he was beaten up. THE UNFINISHED MEMOIRS 141 From this day forward, no one had the courage to assault or harass us any more in this area. From this time onward Yar Mohammad began to take an active part in politics too, consolidating our party's strength in Dhaka city. I was able to create a group of youth volunteers by going from neighbourhood to neighbourhood. This was when a group of youths from Shamsabad and Bangshal joined the Awami League. Shamsabad was next to Bangshal and Armanitola Maidan. These young men took over the organization of our meetings in Armanitola Maidan from then onward. The Muslim League was unable to disrupt them, although they did their utmost to prevent us from holding meetings. On 11 October we held a mammoth meeting at Armanitola Maidan. The entire maidan and the roads around it filled up with people. I spoke after Mr Shamsul Huq had delivered his speech. Maulana Bhasani had already addressed the crowd. Because we knew that the meeting could be disrupted at any time, we had ensured that the Maulana would be the first speaker. The Maulana told me that I should deliver my speech keeping in mind that we would go out in a procession as soon as I had finished speaking. I stood up and delivered my speech and then put this question to the people: 'If a man is murdered, what should the punishment be?' The crowd said in unison, 'Hanging.' I asked the crowd again, 'And what punishment should await those who have killed thousands of people?' The crowd yelled once more, 'Hanging.' I said, 'No! They should be shot dead.' I still remember the exchanges that took place then. I concluded my speech by saying, 'Let's march in a procession so that Mr Liaquat Ali Khan is able to see what exactly it is that the people of East Bengal want.' The procession then began. The Maulana, Mr Huq and I led it. When we reached Nawabpur rail crossing I noticed that the police had blocked the road and were waiting for us with raised rifles. But we had no intention of breaking the law. In any case we had no desire to battle the police. We took a turn towards the rail station and the crowd followed us. Our plan was to cross the Nazjrabazar rail line and enter Nimtali and then turn around at Dhaka Museum and take the road that would bring us back to Armanitola Maidan. But when we reached Nazirabazar we discovered that the police was blocking our way and would not allow us to proceed any further. By now it was time for the evening prayer. The Maulana started to pray on the road. Mr Shamsul Huq joined him immediately. The police began to fire tear gas shells. The crowd retaliated by throwing stones and bricks at them. This went on for about five minutes. The police kept advancing towards us and then assaulted us. A group of our workers lifted 142 SHEIKH MUJIBUR RAHMAN the Maulana on their shoulders and took him inside a hotel. A few of our workers were hurt badly and some of them were arrested; Mr Shamsul Huq was among those arrested. Blows landed on me from many directions. I fell into a roadside ditch and almost fainted. Although Kazi Golam Mahbub was also hurt, he managed to remain fully conscious. Some people lifted me up and put me on a rickshaw which took me to Mughaltuli. My feet were bleeding profusely. Some said that I had been hit by a bullet while others declared that I must have been hit by a tear gas canister. Still others felt that I had hurt myself when I had slipped. A physician showed up and dressed my wounds. He gave me a sedative since I was in such intense pain. Chittagong's Faziul Huq BSc, Abdur Rab and Rasul were among those who sustained head injuries. They had been arrested. My relative Saifuddin Chowdhury aka Surja Mia who belonged to the Faridpur Dattapara zamindar family was with me all this time and took good care of me. I stayed awake till 9 p.m. Around this time the police surrounded our Mughaltuli office where I was living then and asked us to open the doors. Because this was an iron door and could be locked from inside forcing it open was not going to be easy for them. Saifuddin Chowdhury woke Kazi Golam Mahbub, Mofiz and me and said, 'The police have come to arrest you all.' While I was in the sedative-induced sleep, Maulana Bhasani had sent instructions directing me to evade arrest. My body was sore and I had fever. I could hardly move. Nevertheless, I got up and began to think of various ways of making my escape. Shawkat Mia had already fled. He was familiar with the roads of this part of town. We used to live on the third floor and there was a two-storeyed building next to ours. One way out was to jump down from the third floor of our building to the roof of the other one. However, there was a gap between the two buildings and if I failed to land properly I would surely die. But I took the risk and jumped. Kazi Ghulam Mahbub and Mofiz followed me. Because Saifuddin was not involved in politics there was no reason why anyone would arrest him. He thus stayed put. As we were going down the stairs from the rooftop one of us somehow managed to knock a bucket and it fell down with a bang. The owner of the house immediately began screaming. We froze in our tracks. The policemen were too busy trying to break the door open and so paid no heed to the racket. No sooner had we managed to cross the slums surrounding our building and hit the main road than we heard the police finally breaking the door and entering it. We would have to cross Maulvibazar. Three policemen were patrolling the road, moving from one side of the road to the other. When we saw THE UNFINISHED MEMOIRS 143 them far ahead of us we crossed the road. They were unable to detect our movement. After we had crossed Maulvibazar we decided to take refuge in a friend's house that was close by. We spent the night there. In the morning I bade farewell to my two companions since they had no arrest warrant against them. But if they were found with me they might be arrested. I stayed with Abdul Malek Sardar in his Mahutuli house. From here I moved to Captain Shahjahan's house. His wife Noorjahan Begum used to treat me like her brother. She had no interest in politics. I was injured and unwell—where else could I go in Dhaka then and who would give me refuge at this time? The lady looked after me well and brought some medicine for me from a physician. I stayed in that house for a couple of days. However, the Intelligence Branch (IB) people were keeping a close eye on this house since I was a regular visitor here. At 8 p.m. two officers showed up. Just at this time one of the party workers began to approach Begum Noorjahan to inquire about my whereabouts. Seeing lB officers, the party worker's facial expression became such that it was quite apparent where I was. I was in the next room and could hear everything. However, she was quite shrewd and able to think on her feet. Excusing herself to go to the kitchen to serve them tea, she took me downstairs and told me about the interrogation. I asked her for a shawl since I only had a lungi and kurta with me. Luckily for me, she had washed these clothes and had them ironed for me. She brought me a shawl and showed me the safest way out. When I left the house the lB people were still talking to her. I was aware that they had posted two policemen outside the house but I managed to elude them. Maulana Bhasani was putting up with Yar Mohammad. I had to meet him to find out why he had wanted me to evade arrest. Personally, I do not believe in the kind of politics where one takes refuge underground since I detested covert politics and did not approve of furtive actions. I took a rickshaw to a fellow party worker's house. The two of us then headed for Yar Mohammad's house. One could enter the house through a rear door. We took this route in. The policemen who were guarding the front door thus failed to spot us. The Maulana and Yar Mohammad seemed very glad to see me. By this time I had recovered somewhat from my injury. I asked the Maulana why he had wanted me to flee and avoid arrest. In a Muslim League meeting, Nawabzada Liaquat Ali Khan had declared: 'I will smash the head of anyone who dares to take part in Awami League activities.' This, despite his assertions that he believed in democracy! The fact is he didn't like the idea of an opposition at all. He couldn't stand the idea that anyone would dare criticize his government's policies. If anyone 144 SHEIKH MUJIBUR RAFIMAN within his party had the temerity to speak out, he would cause trouble for that man. An example is his treatment of Nawab Mamdot, the prime minister of West Punjab. He was absolutely dedicated to Mr Jinnah. At Jinnah's directive, he had given up his vast landholdings and his title of Nawab. That Liaquat Ali Khan was not ready to accept the existence of any other party except the Muslim League is also obvious in his speeches. Thus he declared in a speech at the Muslim League Council meeting in 1950: I have always said, rather it has always been my firm belief, that the existence of the League, not only the existence of the League, but its strength is equal to the existence and strength of Pakistan. So far as I am concerned, I had decided at the very beginning, and I reaffirm it today, that I have always considered myself the prime minister of the League. I never regarded myself as the prime minister chosen by the members of the Constituent Assembly. He wanted to be the prime minister not of a people but of a party. He had forgotten that a country could not be equated with any one political party. A democratic state can have many political parties; this is only natural if one goes by the law. It is unfortunate that Liaquat Ali Khan was bent on preventing any political party other than his own from coming into existence in Pakistan. Only a dictator could say 'I will smash the head of anyone who takes part in Awami League activities', not anyone who believed in and upheld democracy. Having captured all political power after Jinnah's death, he had become intoxicated with a sense of unlimited power. Maulana Bhasani said to me, 'Go to Lahore since Mr Suhrawardy is there at the moment. Try to meet him and Mia Iftekharuddin. Tell them about the state of affairs in East Bengal. We need a party that can be representative of the whole country. Talk with Pir Manki Sharif and see if we can transform the Awami League under Mr Suhrawardy's leadership into a party that is genuinely all-Pakistan. No one except Mr Suhrawardy has the ability to lead such a party.' In Karachi, meanwhile, Liaquat Ali Khan had been denouncing Mr Suhrawardy in the filthiest language imaginable: 'India has let loose this dog on us,' he said publicly. And yet MrJinnah had never said anything derogatory about Mr Suhrawardy. Such are the ironies of fate! To elect Mr Liaquat Ali Khan all the students of Aligarh Muslim University had to take to the streets. If it were not for those students who had stayed behind in Aligarh, Rafi Ahmed Kidwai would have defeated him. I don't know what he had done for the birth of Pakistan except making statements in Delhi THE UNFINISHED MEMOIRS 145 underJinnah's shadow. Who knows how events would have turned out if Mr Suhrawardy had not succeeded in becoming the prime minister of East Bengal and consolidated the Muslim League in India? Mr Jinnah was aware of Mr Suhrawardy's achievements and therefore accepted his deeds. Mr Suhrawardy had taken up the case on behalf of Nawab Mamdot in Lahore. 2° No doubt Liaquat Ali Khan considered the charges he had brought against the Nawab as an achievement! He was out to harass him because the Nawab didn't care a fig about him. I told Mr Bhasani, 'How will I go to Lahore? I will have to pass through the whole of India. I will have to prove that I am a Pakistani and only then will the Indians allow me to travel across their country to go to West Pakistan.' No passports and visas were being issued at that time. All my woollens were in my village home. I had no money. And in East Punjab anyone suspected of being a Muslim ran the risk of being murdered. I couldn't figure out how to reach Lahore in these circumstances. And over here there was a search warrant against me and the police were on the lookout for me. Mr Bhasani said, 'How can I tell you how you can go to Lahore? All I can say is you should go to Lahore any way you can. You should meet Mr Suhrawardy there and tell him everything.' Sometime early in 1949, Maulana Bhasani, Mia Iftekharuddin and many others had met Mr Suhrawardy and had decided that if the Muslim League continued to be controlled by a coterie they would form a new party. Mr Suhrawardy had approved of this. Now they needed Mr Shaheed Suhrawardy's and Mr Mia Jftekharuddin's help, both of whom were on the best of terms. I took leave of the Maulana. The only warm clothing I had was an achkan. I borrowed some money from my uncle Zafar Sadek. I also drew upon part of the money being held for me in the Ittehad for the work I had done for them. I decided to leave for Lahore with this small amount of money. I knew if I could reach Lahore one way or the other and meet Mr Suhrawardy I would be fine. Somehow I managed to do just that. I reached Lahore after an arduous journey. I slipped through the nets of the East Bengal police with great difficulty. They had been raiding house after house and had looked for me in many localities. They had gone to my village and discovered that I was not there. Lahore was enduring a cold wave. I found it difficult to cope with the cold. Besides, I had never been to the city before. I knew nobody there except 146 SHEIKH MIJJIBUR RAHMAN Mia Iftekharuddin. I knew that Mr Suhrawardy was staying with Nawab Mamdot. I kept my baggage in front of a shop and called the Nawab's house. I was told that he was not in Lahore and would return to the city two days later. I had only two rupees with me. What was I supposed to do? Where was I to keep my baggage? It was 1 p.m. and I was feeling quite famished since I had not had anything since the morning. If I spent the two rupees what would I do afterwards? After pondering my predicament, I decided to phone Mr Iftekharuddin. He was not at home. I got on a tonga and gave directions to his house. I had his address with me. When I alighted in front of his house with my baggage, the security guard told me he wasn't home. He asked me to sit in the vestibule. I kept my suitcase in a corner. I wrote down my name and address on a slip of paper and asked the guard to give it to Mr Iftekharuddin when he came back. As soon as he returned home and saw the slip, Mr Iftekharuddin came out to meet me. He recognized me instantly and treated me affectionately. Seeing how exhausted I was, he immediately had a room arranged for me. He advised me to shower and freshen up. He said we could discuss the situation in East Bengal over lunch. Barisal's S.A. Saleh had already written to Mia Saheb and Shaheed [Suhrawardy] Saheb and told them I would be in Lahore. Saleh was a boyhood friend and Mr Nuruddin's first cousin. We had worked together for the Pakistan movement for a while. Mia Iftekharuddin, his wife and I discussed the political situation of the country as we ate. I told him how things were in East Bengal. I informed him of Maulana Bhasani's views and narrated the way the government was using force to suppress dissent. Mr Iftekharuddin had already quit the ministry. He said, 'Look, it's been a while since I left politics. I won't be taking part in politics actively any more. I have work of my own for the time being.' He asked, 'How is the Muslim League faring in East Bengal?' I said, 'If we have elections I believe we will be able to defeat them and they will lose by a huge margin.' He seemed reluctant to believe this. Begum Iftekharuddin, however, felt that this was possible since 'only recently East Bengal had witnessed a movement against the League'. The Begum seemed well informed about the political situation and about events at home and abroad; it seemed to me that she was very well read too. That night I had fever. Mr Iftekharuddin got a physician to examine me. He bought the drugs prescribed for me and I recovered in a couple of days. He had only one guest room in the house. Mr Suhrawardy's brother Shahed Suhrawardy was due to visit Lahore and stay in the house. Therefore I had to leave in the next day or so. I sensed that they would prefer me to do so. THE UNFINISHED MEMOIRS 147 Mr Iftekharuddin said that he was willing to come up with a solution for me. Mr Suhrawardy had returned to Lahore by then. I was no longer ill but Lahore was very cold. I reached Nawab Mamdot's house at 11 a.m. one day. Mr Suhrawardy was in the lawn, discussing a lawsuit with some lawyers. As soon as he saw me approaching he rose from his chair and embraced me warmly. He said to me affectionately, 'How did you come? You look ill; where have you put up?' He introduced me to everyone present. When they had left he turned his attention to me. I told him all that had happened in East Bengal. He inquired about the leaders and workers he knew. He wanted detailed information about the situation in our country. Those who have not met him will not be able to imagine the extent of his love for East Bengal. Mr Suhrawardy told me that he would have been in a terrible spot financially if he hadn't started working on the case he had on his hands then. He refused to allow me to return to Mr Iftekharuddin's house. We had dinner together along with Nawab Mamdot who had joined us. Mr Suhrawardy told the Nawab about my situation. The Nawab too asked me all sorts of questions to find out how things were in our country. In the evening Khan Ghulam Muhammad Khan Lundkhar and Pir Salahuddin (then a student) came to meet Mr Suhrawardy. Mr Lundkhar had been expelled from the Frontier Province recently and was banned from ever returning to the province. He had been the general secretary of the Frontier Muslim League. He was very happy to see me. Mr Shaheed Suhrawardy requested him to find a hotel for me, preferably a low-cost one. PirJalaluddin was then a student leader of the Punjab who had already earned a name for himself as a party worker. I took leave from Mr Iftekharuddin later. He said if he had had enough space in his house he would never have let me leave. I assured him I would be fine. Mr Suhrawardy took me to a shop and said, 'I have to get some clothes since the two suits I have aren't sufficient.' In addition to ordering some clothes for himself he bought a good-quality blanket, a sweater, some socks and a muffler, and inquired if I needed any clothes. But I was aware that he was struggling himself, so I said I wouldn't need anything at all. When he was dropping me off at my hotel he said, 'I have bought these clothes for you but let me know when you need anything.' I was relieved to have a really warm sweater and a blanket since the cold was getting to me. Every morning I would go to meet Mr Suhrawardy and I would come back home in the evening after spending the day with him. I became a good friend of the Nawab's brothers. Three days later Mr Lundkhar told me, 'Let's go visit Campbellpur. The Frontier Awami League is going to 148 SHEIKH MUJIBUR RAHMAN hold its executive committee meeting there. You can have discussions with Pir Manki Sharif and other leaders of the party there. I agree with you that the party branches of the two provinces should get together and form an All Pakistan Awami League under the leadership of Mr Suhrawardy.' The two of us approached Mr Suhrawardy. He said, 'Go and talk things out with them. It will be a good thing if we can get all the Awami Leagues of the provinces together; I myself am discussing the issue with the Nawab in Punjab.' Mr Suhrawardy gave me some money. The two of us got into Mr Lundkhar's car and headed for Carnpbellpur at ten that night. Mr Lundkhar was driving the car himself. By the time we reached Rawalpindi it was early morning. We rested there for a while, took our breakfast and headed for Campbellpur afterwards, arriving in the town around afternoon. This was the first time I was entering the Punjab or the Land of Five Rivers. I took an instant liking to it. People still haven't forgotten the terrible riots that broke out in East and West Punjab at that period. Hundreds of thousands of refugees flooded the province of West Punjab but things eased up soon since hundreds of thousands of Sikhs and Hindus had also left at the same time. Muslims had taken over their property. Just before leaving for Campbellpur I had issued a press statement on the state of affairs in East Bengal mentioning the imprisonment of Maulana Bhasani and Shamsul Huq, the harassment of political workers and the food crisis in the province. Both the Pakistan Times and Imroze featured the press release prominently since both were owned by Mia Iftekharuddin. It was at this time that I became acquainted with the editor, the famous poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz, and his associate Mr Mazhar. It won't be an exaggeration to say that these men were learned and brilliant. Both of them as well as Mr Iftekharuddin believed that Bengali should be a state language of Pakistan. They also agreed that our demands were just. Before writing down my statement I had showed it to Mr Suhrawardy. He had gone through it and approved it. We reached Campbellpur eventually. The District Bungalow had been reserved for the Pir Saheb. In a short time executive committee members as well as general members of the Frontier Awami League reached the venue. The meeting was being held here because Mr Lundkhr was not allowed to travel from West Punjab to the Frontier Province. Ii was here that I first met Pir Manki Sharif, Sardar Abdul Ghafur, Sardar Sikander and Mr Shamim Jung, who had once been a minister, and other prominent leaders of the region. The meeting went on for a long time. At one stage, THE UNFINISHED MEMOIRS 149 they allowed me to join the meeting. It was taking place in the District Bungalow. Two armed guards made sure that no one from the detective branch was allowed inside the bungalow. The meeting went on till late at night. I gave a speech in English there. One gentleman whose name I have now forgotten translated my speech into Pashto. When I finished speaking, the issue I had raised of creating a trans-Pakistani organization was taken up. I could see that in the end almost everyone agreed to my proposal. After Ghulam Muhammad Lundkhar had ended his speech they decided to send a delegation comprising three members to Mr Suhrawardy to invite him to head the organization. The meeting ended late that night. At that time special permission was needed to cross Attock Bridge. The Pir Saheb had the necessary papers and was thus able to leave that night. Some of us stayed back in the bungalow. Mr Lundkhar took me to a small hotel. I had my dinner there and spent the night in it. That night it struck me forcefully how cold Punjab could be in winter! I am from East Bengal, a land where one can go through an entire winter with only a light blanket. Here you have to wear layer upon layer of warm clothes and wrap yourself in blanket after blanket. And yet it is so cold that sleep evades you despite the layers of clothes and the blankets! The Pir was saddened by what he had heard about East Bengal and told us about the atrocities being perpetrated by Quayyum Khan in the Frontier Province. Khan was guilty of incarcerating many leaders and workers there. He would impose Section 144 as soon as he heard of a meeting being held. Apparently, he would never think twice about employing the police to assault a procession with batons and bullets. The situation had become unbearable. It could be said that the tyranny of the state in East Bengal was nothing compared to that in the Frontier Province. He had thrown Lundkhar in jail. Although Khan released him later, he saw to it that Lundkhar was expelled from the Frontier Province. Lundkhar was therefore in Lahore. We left for Lahore the next morning. Before that I had one request to make: how could I go back without seeing Attock Bridge and Attock Fort? After all, it was only a few miles away. Mr Lundkhar agreed to take me to see the bridge. I crossed the bridge and entered the Frontier Province. He sent a guide with me. There were a few fruit shops along the way. I bought some fruits and returned. You needed a pass to enter Attock Fort since a few war prisoners were interned within. From a distance I could see a few Sikh prisoners working inside. After I had returned Mr Lundkhar took us all back to Lahore. We eventually reached Rawalpindi. We rested there for a while. I saw that Mr Lundkhar knew quite a few people there. He would 150 SHEIKH MUJIBUR_RAHMAN -- stop the car every once in a while to smoke the hookah. Wherever he stopped at a wayside hotel or a restaurant someone or the other was sure to bring a hookah for him. All these people seemed to belong to the Frontier Province. We stopped for tea in Jhelum, Gujrat and Gujranwala. When we reached Lahore it was almost 10.30 p.m. Mr Lundkhar dropped me off at my hotel promising to take me back to Suhrawardy and give me a report on the decisions taken. Followers of the Punjab's Nawab Mamdot increasingly found themselves sidelined in the Muslim League. He had not formed a party yet. But he was considering it and hoping to form one after the conclusion of the lawsuit. Many well-known workers and leaders, all veteran Muslim Leaguers, had been meeting Mr Suhrawardy. He had agreed to address a public meeting in Sargodha district. He asked me to accompany him. Since I had very little to do I agreed to accompany him. Sargodha was full of refugees from India and it was obvious that there was no end to their misery. Mr Suhrawardy gave his speech. I was also asked to speak by many people but I told them that I didn't understand Urdu or Punjabi and the people here could not understand English and so how could I speak to them? Mr Suhrawardy said that I could be excused from speaking. However, I was introduced to the assembly. I greeted everyone and then sat down. I could see that Mr Suhrawardy's popularity extended to a place even as remote as Sargodha. In the Lahore hotel where I was staying, Mr Aziz Beg and Mr Khurshid (who would later become president of Azad Kashmir) had rented two rooms from which they were publishing the weekly Guardian. They had read the statement I had made in the Pakistan Times and had published extracts from it in their paper. I met them and discussed all the issues with them. A Guardian representative met me and brought out a feature about me. Slowly the politicians of Lahore became aware that I was staying in Lahore. The hotel manager had already informed me that the detective branch was shadowing me. He also told me that someone was always tailing me on a full-time basis. Whenever I went out on a walk or on a tonga my tail would follow me on a bicycle. Courtesy of Pir Jalaluddin I met a representative of the Punjab Muslim Students' Federation. We talked about the importance of forming an all- Pakistani student organization. Others like Mr Fahmi and Mr Nur Mohammad (he had just come from Delhi) who were leaders of the student fronts also agreed with me on this issue. I went to the Law College hostel on a few occasions to talk over the issue with them. I said, 'Even if I am no longer involved in a student organization, if you are ready to form THE UNFINISHED MEMOIRS 151 an all-Pakistani organization, I will be able to persuade the East Pakistan Students' League to join you.' They said yes to my proposal and we decided to form such an organization. They drafted a constitution for it and asked me to carry it to Dhaka. I agreed and volunteered to inform the leaders of the Students' League in East Pakistan about their view. They would then write to their West Pakistani counterparts and a joint declaration would be issued from the Punjab and Bengal. An unfortunate incident took place at this time. I went to the Pakistan Times office to meet Mr Mia. It was around 11 a.m. Mr Mia was not in his office. I waited for him for a while but he didn't show up. I had work to do with Mr Suhrawardy and was supposed to meet him in the high court. Soon after I had set out three or four people confronted me and asked me where I was from. I said, 'From East Pakistan.' Suddenly, one of them grabbed me by my hand while another one held on to my shirt and yelled, 'You are Pakistan's enemy.' Another brought out a hunter and the fourth a knife. I managed to free my hand and told them, 'Do you know who I am?' They said, 'Yes, we do.' I said, 'Either listen to me or if you want to have a fight let's do so on a one-to-one basis.' One of them tried to box me but I managed to deflect his blow. By this time a crowd had gathered. Some of them asked me what was going on. I said, 'I have no idea. I am from East Bengal. I had gone to the Pakistan Times office to meet Mr Mia. I can't understand why these people want to beat me up.' Among the people who had assembled were some students and some gentlemen. They told my attackers something and one of them actually abused my assailants. In the end the thugs left the scene. I went to the Law College hostel to inform Kazmi about what had taken place but he was not there. I hired a tonga and went to the high court to meet Mr Suhrawardy. I was all worked up and hadn't eaten anything. When we went out in the evening to the Nawab's house I told him about the incident. Mr Suhrawardy informed the Nawab about my encounter. I returned to my hotel before dusk set in. When Kazmi met me in the evening and found out what had happened he took some students along with him to the site of the incident and tried to find out from the shopkeepers of the area the identity of my assailants. They told him that they were not from the neighbourhood and must have come there from another area. It was obvious that they had been let loose on me by the Muslim League. Here too they were using strong-arm tactics. Lundkhar said to me, 'You will have to be on your guard from now on.' I decided that I wouldn't tell anyone else about this incident. Senior government officials of the Punjab treated the Nawab with great respect. They soon came to know of what had happened to me. My problem was 152 - - SHEIKH MUJ!BUR RAHMAN that I had difficulty in communicating in Urdu. On the other hand, the ordinary Punjabi didn't speak Urdu fluently. What they used was a mixture of Urdu and Punjabi while I could only use a mixture of Bengali and Urdu. At around this time a conference organized by progressive writers of the Punjab took place. Mr Mia requested me to take part in it. I did so but as a guest since I wasn't a writer myself. The conference went on for two days. Mr Lundkhar also took part. Unfortunately, when he went to attend a session, someone or the other or perhaps a band of men set his car aflame. In the 1942 movement his house had already been torched since he was president of the Frontier Congress at that time. He had joined the Muslim League as soon as he had left jail. Lundkhar told me, 'These incidents are not unusual in Lahore. However, I am a Pathan and they are scared of me. They don't have the guts to confront me and so will always try to attack me when my back is turned.' A month had gone by; how much longer wouldj have to stay in Lahore? I pointed out to Mr Suhrawardy that Maulana Bhasani, Mr Shamsul Huq and our fellow workers were behind bars in Dhaka. But Mr Suhrawardy said, 'As soon as you reach Dhaka they are going to jail you but this may not happen here in Lahore.' I replied, 'But they can arrest me here and send me to Dhaka since Mr Liaquat Ali is angry with me. Moreover, the government in East Pakistan must also be out to get me wherever I am. They will tell the central government to force the Punjab government to hand me over to them. This may happen any time now. After all, I haven't been quiet here. If anything is going to happen to me, it's best that it happens in East Bengal since in prison in East Bengal they will serve me rice and I will not survive if I have to eat the roil they serve in West Pakistani prisons! Indeed, I am fed up with the roti and meat I have to eat here every day. And if I have to stay in jail anywhere, it's best to serve time with my fellow workers.' Mr Suhrawardy said, 'In that case, make arrangements to go back.' He asked me what route I would like to take. I said, 'There is only one land route and that is through East Punjab. I don't want to take this route. I would like to fly from Lahore to Delhi and take the train from t]ìere. I'll need a permit to travel through India. Such a permit can be issued only by the Indian deputy high commissioner in Lahore.' I added, 'I have already talked to Mr Mia and he has assured me that he will tell the deputy high commissioner to issue me a permit since he knows him well.' Mr Suhrawardy asked me to get ready to leave. A few of my friends were then undergoing training in Lahore's Civil Service Academy. I went to meet them there. I ended up meeting a lot of my friends. One of them was a leader of the government party and had THE UNFINISHED MEMOIRS 153 opposed the movement that had gone on to establish the claim of our mother tongue. He said, 'You must have tea with me. Having come to Lahore I realize that you all were right to launch the movement for Bengali and I was wrong to oppose it. Many of the people here hate Bengalis.' I didn't say anything in response since that would be inappropriate. After all everyone present was in government service and someone or the other could take offence. I got my permit and decided to leave immediately since Mr Mia had told me not to waste any time. The permit said that I would have to leave India within three days. Three days was all the time I had! I calculated that I would just about manage to pass through India in that time. Mr Suhrawardy paid my hotel bills and bought me an Orient Airlines plane ticket to Delhi (this was then a Pakistani carrier). He also gave me some money for my incidental expenses. At that time you were permitted to take only fifty Pakistani rupees to India and only fifty Indian rupees to Pakistan. But it was difficult to procure Indian currency in Pakistan. Mr Suhrawardy asked Nawabzada Zulfikar (Nawab Mamdot's younger brother) to put me on the plane since he had heard that there was a move to arrest me at the airport. In that event the Nawabzada was to inform Mr Suhrawardy about my predicament. The Nawabzada therefore accompanied me to the airport. I noticed that he kept my luggage at a distance. He then took me to an official's room. That man examined my permit. He went through my luggage and said, 'Sit down here for a while and don't go anywhere.' Nawabzada Zulfikar told me, 'They seem to be up to something because it is time for the flight to leave but nothing is happening.' The passengers were made to board the plane and then asked to deboard. They seemed to be waiting for directions from above. The Nawabzada eventually found out that the whole delay was on my account. An hour later the plane was given permission to leave and I was told I could board it. I took leave from him and got on the plane, requesting him as I did that he should inform Mr Suhrawardy of the incident. I could see that they had taken all this time to decide whether I should be allowed to leave or be detained here. In the end they must have come to the conclusion that they shouldn't make the Punjab suffer for what was really Bengal's headache! I was acutely aware that I had only three days to cross all of India. If the East Pakistan government was alerted, they would arrest me either at Darshana or Benapole border crossing. The permit clearly said that I would not be allowed to stay in India. If the Calcutta government officials knew about me they would not hesitate to intern me in their prison since I was Shaheed Suhrawardy's follower! 154 SHEIKH MUJIBUR RAHMAN I was feeling sad about leaving Mr Suhrawardy behind since I had spent a lot of time under his tutelage. I had been showered with his affection and had worked under his leadership. In Bengal people venerated him and the Muslims of the region had joined the movement for Pakistan at his call. Unfortunately, the man whose gesture had inspired thousands to sacrifice their lives without hesitation had nothing now. The colleagues he had once taken pride in now considered him an enemy. Who knows how long it would be before I could meet him again? Without his guidance and help, we would not be able to establish a political party in East Bengal and prevent the Muslim League from establishing itself in the province. I felt that the nation would once more be able to benefit from his organizational acumen and leadership skills. I reached Delhi and immediately headed for the second-class railway waiting room, where I kept my luggage. I showered, ate, left my luggage with a guard and then went out. I had already bought my ticket. The train was scheduled to leave that night and I had a lot of time on my hands. I took a tonga to Jama Masjid since I wanted to see how the Muslims were doing. During Partition the city had witnessed fierce riots. I found that Muslims were still doing business in some of their shops. However, I didn't have the courage to talk to anyone. I walked to the Red Fort. I had been there before but now the Indian flag was flying on it. Inside, things had changed somewhat. Muslims now had only a few shops inside it. I didn't feel like staying there for long. I therefore left, took another tonga and headed for the Anglo-Arabian College, where I had participated in the Muslim League Convention in 1946. I then decided to go around New Delhi. This part of the city was being transformed and looked very different. It was now the capital of India. Muslims had ruled India for hundreds of years here but they were of no consequence at present. Their presence was tangible only in the pages of history. Who knows if even this memory would be retained in the future? The Hindu bigots who were responsible for the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi would surely not tolerate people from another religious community. It was here in Delhi that conspiracies were hatched to kill Mahatma Gandhi, Pandit Nehru and Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy. God had saved Mr Suhrawardy from death. Those who had assisted Nathuram Godse, Gandhi's assassin, had confessed as much during Gandhi's murder trial. I boarded my train that night. I had a reserved seat. There were three other gentlemen in the second-class car with me. I didn't have the courage to talk to anyone. I began to read a newspaper. This was a time when India was witnessing intermittent communal outbreaks. But after the death of THE UNFINISHED MEMOIRS the Mahatma the Congress government was compelled to take punitive measures against the communal RSS [Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh] and Hindu Mahasabha workers. In the wake of the Mahatma's martyrdom— brought on by his determination to safeguard the lives of Muslims—his followers had begun to react against the forces of communalism. They had also started to behave in a friendly manner with Muslims. When I woke up the next morning I saw that two of the passengers had left and there was only other person in the car with me. He was from West Bengal. He asked me where I was from and where I was heading. I told him the truth. I said I was on my way to East Bengal from Lahore and that my home was in Faridpur district. The man said, 'I am from Barisal myself. I am now working in Delhi.' We talked for a long time. He was feeling sad because he wouldn't be able to eat the fish and vegetables of East Bengal, or breathe its air, or ever return to his land of birth, since all his relatives had left Barisal. The gentleman asked me to get down at Howrah and spend the night with him in his house. He said, 'Please stay with me; you won't have any problems there at all.' I thanked him saying, 'I'll have to leave tomorrow morning and that's why I'll spend the night in a friend's house.' But when I was all alone I thought: where should I go now? I didn't want to stay in a hotel. In the end I decided that I would go to my friend Khondokar Nurul Alam's house and stay with him. I went to his Park Circus house to find he was not in, but his brother received me warmly. Nurul Alam returned home after a while. He seemed delighted to see me again. We dined together and then went out for a stroll. Alam told me, 'I don't know what to do; I'm here all by myself my friends have all left. But what will I do in Dhaka? I don't have any money to invest in a business. Mr Nurul Amin will never offer me a job since I was on Mr Suhrawardy's side and was working with Mr Hashim for him.' I couldn't say anything to Alam since I didn't have the ability to offer him anything in Dhaka. My own future was quite uncertain and for all I knew I might have to eat jail food tomorrow! However, Nurul Alam told me that he had applied for a job in the Pakistani deputy l,iigh commissioner's office. I telephoned the railway people and found out that the train to Khulna would leave at 11 a.m., reach Benapole in the evening and Khulna at 10 p.m. I bought an inter-class ticket. I knew I would have to hoodwink the police at the Benapole border. The East Bengal government would surely have alerted their people that I would be attempting to cross the border in a day or two. Its detective branch was no doubt busy trying to trace me so that I could be put behind bars. I was also ready for jail but before I was interned I wanted to meet my parents, family members and my children. I 156 SHEIKH MUJIBUR RAHMAN had written to Renu from Lahore and she would be looking forward to my visit. Everyone at home would be eagerly awaiting me. I also needed to go to Dhaka to talk things over with my colleagues. The work we were doing would have to go on even if I was arrested. I also needed to raise some money. Our party really was short of funds. I believed that I could raise some money for it on my own. I knew some admirers of Mr Suhrawardy who would not be able to refuse me if I approached them. Our train stopped at Ranaghat for a long time. To find out if anyone was carrying any contraband items, the Indian customs officers searched the car as well as the passengers' baggage. They rummaged through my luggage too. By evening we came to Benapole. I got off the train before it stopped at the station. I had become familiar with a passenger in my car and enlisted his help. I requested him to show my luggage to the Pakistan customs official if they wanted to inspect it since I had some work to do. I also told him that it might be a while before I returned. Since it was dark I felt that I could take shelter under a tree. Members of the detective branch and some police officers were going from car to car and examining everything in sight. When I saw them approaching I went to the other side of the train to hide myself. I was determined to elude them. I was thinking of my loved ones all the time. A few months back my eldest son, Kamal, had been born but I had not been able to spend any time with him. Hasina saw so little of me that whenever I met her she would not let go of me. I was overwhelmed by the thought that I was a father-as well as a son and wanted to be with my family members once again. I knew they were all looking forward to my visit home and were sure that I would go and meet them as soon as I returned from Lahore. Certainly, Renu would be staying awake for me. She always endured hardship and never protested. Because she kept quiet and never complained I felt even sadder! Maulana Bhasani, Mr Shamsul Huq and my co-workers were languishing in jail. I felt depressed thinking about them too. Even if I was unable to do anything to change the situation, to be near them would be some consolation. As the train started to move again, and as it began to gather speed, I ran and caught up with it and boarded it. I doubt if I could have been able to do that if I was even a minute late. The train had now picked up speed but I kept thinking I would have to be on my guard when we arrived in Jessore. I was aware that the rail station was normally full of people from the detective branch. A few minutes before the train reached J essore station I went into our car's toilet. I came out only after the train had started to move again. A student had now entered our car. As soon as I came out of the toilet he said to me, Aren't you Mujib?' I asked him to THE UNFINISHED MEMOIRS 157 move closer to me and whispered, 'Don't call me by my name.' He was in the Students' League and immediately understood why I didn't want to be identified by my name. Because the train was full no one seemed to have noticed. And that was a time when I wasn't that well known. Also, the student got down at the next station. I knew what the situation in Khulna would be like. Since my childhood I had travelled through this city. To go to Calcutta for my studies, I had to cross it. The train reached Khulna at around 11 p.m. When all the passengers had got down from the train I took out my kurta, folded it and wrapped it inside my bedding. I rolled my lungi to my knees. I carried my bedding on my head and my suitcase in my hand. I hurried towards the river landing station as if I were a coolie. The men from the detective branch failed to detect me. I crossed the railroad and entered the river landing station. I exited from another gate and took a rickshaw. I retrieved my kurta from my bedding and wore it once more. The rickshaw puller was from Gopalganj and recognized me immediately. He said, 'Sir, how come you are dressing up here?' I told him, 'There is a lot that I could tell you but I will have to explain everything to you later. First, let's leave the station right away.' I knew I would have to tell him at least a few things that had happened to me. Since he was from Gopalganj he would not betray me. I had a cousin who worked in Khulna. I knew where he lived and so headed for his house. I sent the rickshaw puller to my uncle's house. My uncle was a very capable man. I sent him to the landing station to buy two first-class reserved tickets on the steamer for me so that I could travel in privacy. I also got in touch with a friend who worked for the river steamship company. He advised me to board the steamer just a couple of minutes before it started. He would see to it that the steamer left as soon as I boarded it. He was aware that the landing station too was teeming with men from the detective branch. Unfortunately, because of fog the steamer took a long time to dock in the station and had to delay its departure by an hour. In other words, it would now leave at 7 a.m. This was a problem since at 6 a.m. it is still quite dark at this time of the year but by seven the sun would be up and I would be quite conspicuous. My uncle had loaded our baggage on the steamer by then. He had helped me don a coat and trousers and even a hat. When the steamer finally started to leave I sprinted on to it. My friend was still standing on the landing station. As soon as he saw me he ordered that the walkway be withdrawn, and the steamer was on its way. I managed to exchange glances with him and thus convey my gratitude. Now my hopes were up—I would be able to reach home! I stayed inside 158 SHEIKH MUJIBUR RAHMAN the cabin the whole day and had food brought to it. Quite a few people had seen me board the ship. The ship stopped in Gopalganj before moving on to Barisal and then Narayanganj. Many of the people were travelling to Gopalganj. The steamer itself wouldn't go all the way to Gopalganj town but would offload passengers three miles away at a place called Manikdaha where they had constructed a new landing station. This is because the river had silted up near the town. When the ship landed at Manikdaha I surveyed the scene outside. Two of our workers—RahmatJan and Yunus—recognized me instantly when they looked my way and called out my name excitedly. I signalled to them to shut up since the police would be raiding our village home in a bid to nab me if they got wind of my arrival. Rahmat Jan and Yunus were actually travelling to Barisal where they studied at the college. They came to me right away. The ship was leaving then. I said, 'How did you recognize me?' They said, 'We know your eyes so well!' I told them, 'If the police find out that I am around they will try to arrest me as I walk home.' They said, 'Mujib Bhai, this is Gopalganj; unless you want to be arrested, no one will dare arrest you from here.' The people of Gopalganj usually added the honorific 'Bhai' or brother to my name when addressing me. On occasions both the father and son of a family would end up calling me 'Bhai'! It usually took me two hours from Gopalganj to the landing station closest to our house. We arrived at the Gopalganj landing station around evening. It took me another hour by boat to get home. When I reached it, everyone was surprised as well as delighted. Nobody had imagined that I would be able to return home. My daughter just wouldn't let go of me and refused to go to sleep. I told my father about everything that had happened to me. I asked someone to keep an eye on the road. We posted a guard so that he would stay awake in the outhouse throughout the night to ensure that no one entered undetected. Our house was big and always full of people. I wouldn't be unhappy if I was arrested now. However, I would still have liked to go to Dhaka once more before they interned me. I explained to my father as well as Renu that I wouldn't be able to stay home for long. In the end, I stayed with my family for seven to eight days. I told them, 'I won't be able to go to Dhaka via Barisal; neither can I travel through Gopalganj. They will be on the lookout for me and will arrest me if they can trace me. What I can try to do is board a launch from a landing station that is two stops away from Gopalganj. Then I will get down at Kabirajpur and take a boat to Shibchar in Madaripur subdivision. From Shibchar I will board another launch. But before I do so I will spend a day or two with my sister [who lived five miles away from Shibchar] and her family.' THE UNFINISHED MEMOIRS 159 Renu said to me, 'Who knows how long we will have to stay apart! Let me come along with you to Shibchar and take the opportunity to spend two more days with you. I will take our children along. Your father can come later to bring us back home.' I gave in to her proposal since I knew that if they got hold of me this time they would keep me in jail forever. Although going all the way to Shibchar by boat was quite arduous we decided to leave. Two of our workers, Shahidul Islam and Siraj, accompanied us. They were still in school but were very fond of me. Now the two of them are businessmen. Shahid is still very loyal to me and backs me up in everything I do. Siraj has switched his allegiance to another party but still respects me. They went with us as far as Kabirajpur and stayed awake the whole night to make sure that we were safe. They had left their homes without warm clothes on a wintry night. In fact, Renu gave them her own shawl so that they could stay warm that night. We eventually arrived at my sister's house and ended up staying there for seven days. I was getting more and more attached to my children. I didn't feel like leaving them but knew I would have to. I had consecrated myself to the cause of my country—so what was the point of becoming sentimental about my family? If one loves one's country and its people one must be ready to sacrifice something and in the end might have to give up everything. My father had given me some money when I left our home. Renu had also brought along some money for me. I told Renu, 'You were by yourself for a long time but now there are two of our children to keep you company. I know you can't expect any sort of financial assistance from me. You will have to manage on your own somehow. I am aware that you won't be asking for help from my father again and again. And in any case, where will my father get the money to meet all our needs? I don't need a lot of money. They are certain to detain me soon. I won't be able to elude them forever.
