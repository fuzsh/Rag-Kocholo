        "text": "The present paper aims to understand the role of Islamic NGOs in transforming gender relations in the rural areas of Bangladesh. Based on fieldwork carried out over the period of July 2010 - February 2011 in Bangladesh, this paper argues that Islamic NGOs have changed the ideological structure shaping the lives of rural women, through the issues of empowerment and piety. Islamic NGOs have been successful in mobilizing women to create a „sense of guilt‟ regarding interest charges by the microcredit program of non-Islamic NGOs, and have advocated an Islamic version of „women empowerment‟ by enhancing Muslim women‟s agency. Hence, a „different model of gender relations‟ in contrast to the liberal model is emerging that envisages Muslim women‟s piety as central to constructing „good women‟ which informs the way they appear and behave in the public. For the purpose of the research, qualitative interviews, FGDs, and observations were conducted with the beneficiaries of Shari‟a based microfinance programs of Muslim Aid, Masjid Council for Community Advancement (MACCA) and Islamic Bank Foundation (IBF) in three different districts of rural Bangladesh.\n\nAfter a period of political oblivion, the religious right in Bangladesh has not only made electoral gains in the early 1990s but also successfully engaged in political alliances which allowed it to campain virtually unopposed for an Islamic state where women could step outdoors only at their own peril. Their many-speared campain included attacks on development organisations which empowered women through offering loans, skills training and employment opportunities. They have argued that female emancipation is not part of God's plan. Therefore, schools for girls have not remained unscathed. Women who dared to challenge existing social codes, alongside those who did not have, are equally victims of violence and moral censure. These activities were at odds with the development objectives of the state. Yet, at times the role of the state was an ambivalent one. Where decisive action could have stemmed the tide, none was forthcoming. This paper seeks to examine the position and status of women in Bangladesh in relation to the interplay of religion and politics. In order to do so it will first present some relevant background information on the history of the country and recent data on socioeconomic indicators of female status. A discussion of the nature of women's subordination and resistance follows : the women's movement, though weak, has achieved some success in negotiating policy changes at the state level. Therefore, its interactions with the state merit some attention. An assumption shared by feminist scholars is that the patriarchal postcolonialist state reinforces gender inequality and\n\nBangladesh is widely deemed to have made rapid progress on gender equality and women's empowerment. How to understand the apparent advances of women in a poor, populous, Muslim-majority country in the belt of classic patriarchy? This paper locates the origins of these changes in the immediate aftermath of Bangladesh's struggle for independence in 1971, when a series of visible ruptures to the patriarchal bargain dramatized the ongoing crisis of social reproduction. This drew elite attention to the conditions of landless rural women, creating space for their programmatic inclusion in the political settlement, within a newly biopolitical project of national development. The paper argues that it is possible to make sense of the gains women have made as well as old and new obstacles to gender justice-including women's continuing responsibility for care-in this critical juncture in the political history of gender relations in Bangladesh.\n\nThere is no denying that women in many societies suffer from multiple layers of discriminations and social exclusion, and that the patriarchal social structure aggravates their susceptibility to various forms of oppression and abuse. Men have enjoyed various privileges at the expense of women’s rights and wellbeing. Whenever challenged, custodians of gender-based inequalities have used social mythologies, and sometimes pseudo-religious arguments, to facilitate and sustain the complex structure of gender stereotypes and to defend their privileges, and thus to perpetuate their domination over women. As a result, as far as gender relations are concerned, especially in Muslim cultural contexts, religion and patriarchy seem enmeshed and inseparable because of misuse and wrong interpretations or misapplications of Islamic religious texts. However, people of good will and sound judgment and intellectuals with substantial socio-cultural knowledge and Islamic scholarship have said it over and over again that the religion of Islam is a means of, and not an impediment to, women’s liberation and empowerment."
