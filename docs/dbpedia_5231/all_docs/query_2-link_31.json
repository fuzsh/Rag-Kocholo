The number of countries withcoverage under 10% of the population hasdecreased from 34 in January to 18.Some Advance Market Commitmentsupportedcountries - for example,Bhutan, Cambodia, Viet Nam, Maldives,Fiji and Bangladesh - have coverageabove 70%.Yet despite this progress, and the easingof global supply constraints, inequitiesbetween lower and higher-income countriesare continuing to cost lives and areprolonging the pandemic by increasingthe threat posed by the emergence of new,potentially more dangerous variants of thevirus. Only 16% of people in low-incomecountries have received a single vaccinedose - compared to 80% in high-incomecountries.In certain lower-income countries,many of the most at-risk people in society- healthcare workers, the elderly and thosewith underlying health conditions - aregoing unprotected while young, healthyadults receive booster doses in wealthiercountries.art & cultureSiam to star in Hindifilm 'In the Ring'>Page 10Dhaka Declaration by CCfSClimate change:SouthAsia in high vulnerableSafiqul iSlamSouth Asia has been identified as one ofthe most vulnerable regions in the worldfor climate change in the DhakaDeclaration of the InternationalConference on Climate Change and FoodSecurity in South Asia (CCFS) organized atDhaka University. Noting that 40 percentof the world's natural disasters occur inSouth Asia as a result of climate change,various recommendations have beenmade from the conference to formulateand implement short and long term programsto address the adverse effects of climatechange. These recommendationswere presented at the Meet the Press eventheld at Professor Abdul Matin ChowdhuryVirtual Classroom on Saturday. DhakaUniversity Vice-Chancellor Prof. Md.Akhtaruzzaman was present as the chiefguest on the occasion. At the meet-thepressevent, the chairman of the internationalcommittee of 'CCFS' Dr. MannavaShivakumar and the chief organizing coordinatorof the conference organizing committeeAHM Mustafizur Rahman spokesat the event.The International Conference onClimate Change and Food Security inSouth Asia, is held in Dhaka from May 18to 20. This Conference was jointly organizedby Dhaka University and CNRS,France and sponsored by the WorldMeteorological Organization (WMO); theFood and Agriculture Organization (FAO).There were eight technical sessions in thisInternational Conference.The experts say that the agriculture inSouth Asia is highly vulnerable to climaticvariability and climate change especially inrain-fed regions. Climate change hasmulti-dimensional impacts on agroecosystemsin South Asia, includingincreases in temperature, declines in freshwater availability, sea level rise, glacialmelting in the Himalayas, increased frequencyand intensity of extreme events,and shifting of cropping zones. They allimpact agriculture and the related foodsector as well as the general economies,societies and environment in South Asia.South Asia accounts for some 40 percentof globally-recorded extreme events.According to the 6th Assessment Reportof the Intergovernmental Panel onClimate Change (IPCC), the next few yearswill be critical. There are hard choices to bemade about infrastructure; new serviceprovision systems; policies and incentivesand public investment so that developmentpathways in South Asia can shifttowards sustainable development anddevelopment becomes climate resilient.Philippines detects first caseof Omicron sub-variant BA.4MANILA : The Philippines has detectedOmicron sub-variant BA.4 from a Filipinocitizen who flew in from the Middle Eastearly this month, the Department ofHealth (DOH) said on Saturday.The DOH said the asymptomaticpatient, who arrived in the country on May4, tested positive for COVID-19 four dayslater. Quoting data from the EuropeanCenter for Disease Prevention and Control(ECDC), the DOH said Omicron BA.4 is avariant of concern (VOC).\"Compared to a variant of interest, aVOC is seen to either spread faster orcause worse illness,\" the DOH said, warningthat \"BA.4's faster transmission is likelybecause of its ability to evade immuneprotection.\"\"While the ECDC has not observed anychange in severity for BA.4 compared toother Omicron sub-variants, we must becareful because the faster transmissionwill lead to a spike in cases that could overwhelmour hospitals and clinics,\" the DOHwarned. The DOH urged the local governmentunit where the first BA.4 case wasdetected to \"rapidly implement detectionand isolation\" of people who may havebeen exposed to the patient.BA.4 and BA.5 were first detected inSouth Africa in January and February 2022,respectively, and since then, they havebecome the dominant variants in that country.On May 17, the DOH confirmed the localtransmission of the highly transmissibleOmicron sub-variant BA.2.12.1 in threeareas, including Metro Manila.The Philippines has detected 17BA.2.12.1 cases so far. According to theDOH, there is no community transmissionof the BA.2.12.1. Studies showed thatBA.2.12.1 is highly transmissible due toadditional mutations than the originalOmicron strain.While this sublineage has not beenobserved to lead to more severe disease orfatality, it has the potential for immuneescape. The Philippines now has3,688,508 confirmed COVID-19 cases,including 60,455 deaths.Slum dwellers including children and teenagers held a sit-in program in the capital's Kalyanpur slum onSaturday seeking space for education.Photo : Star mail"
