        "text": "There has been a massive impact of global climate change on the environment that is already evident in various parts of the world. Bangladesh is heavily affected by different climate change issues, and riverbank erosion is one of them. Among others, women are the most vulnerable and suffer the most during the riverbank erosion in Bangladesh. Thus, the key focus of this paper was to understand the impact of riverbank erosion on the lives of women applying a qualitative research method. The objective of the paper was to understand the vulnerabilities and survival strategies of women living in riverbank erosion areas. Findings suggest that the impact of riverbank erosion on the lives of poor women is diverse. It creates a burden for the family members, and in most cases, they fall into a vicious circle of poverty. Despite the increased workload of women due to the unequal distribution of labor in the family, some women also experience a sense of empowerment with their engagement in various income-generating activities, decision-making process and increased physical mobility.\n\nBangladesh is situated in riverine and deltaic region in South Asia where riverbank erosion is a catastrophic climate induced disaster in Bangladesh. The present study has been undertaken to investigate the impact of riverbank erosion on lives and livelihoods of the displaced people in the SouthEastern Bangladesh. Both quantitative and qualitative data have been used through in-depth interviews, focus group discussion and questionnaire survey. The study reveals that riverbank erosion is addressing displacement, hidden hunger and poverty, loss of land and identity of coastal people. Besides, displaced persons face social, economic, cultural stigma in their community. People have used different types of indigenous knowledge to reduce the sufferings of the affected people. The findings of this study are vital for policymakers to articulate and implement effective approaches and programs to reduce vulnerability and to increase the local adaptation processes in order to improve such households' livelihood all over Bangladesh.\n\nHuman history is all about coping or crumbling with the changing climate. Bangladesh is one of those countries, which is tagged as one of the most vulnerable to climate change. Climate-driven hazards are exhibited frequently in the haor (wetland) -regions of the country. Shonir Haor is the largest freshwater reservoir and one of the major wetlands of Bangladesh, located at Tahirpur Upazila of Sunamganj district. This study provides an understanding of climate change and gender roles in the northeastern part of Bangladesh, where soil erosion is one of the most common natural hazards. It states the gender role and adaptation strategy with the danger of soil erosion. In erosion-prone areas people, especially, women are worried about the loss of their homesteads and other sufferings and misery. Since men tend to leave the area in search of employment, all the responsibility of the household falls on the shoulders of women. Moreover, women are affected more severely than males, but they tolerate their vulnerable situation furtively and hardly show any objection and try to play an effective role in their household and family. Data and information that have been used in the paper are collected by a research team that brings together a range of methodological approaches, including Life Histories, Case Studies, In-depth Interviews, and Focus Group Discussions (FGD) in order to obtain deeper insights into the study area.\n\nNatural disasters are the most frequent phenomena in Bangladesh. More or less every year, the people of Bangladesh face various kinds of disaster such as flood, draught, and cyclone. Considering the existing social structure of Bangladesh women are the most vulnerable to natural disasters and bear the challenges of the pre, post and during disaster survival. However, despite various difficulties they play the most crucial role to maintain their families during natural disaster. The present study intends to focus on the vulnerabilities and the capabilities of the rural women during the flood of 1998. For women and children the flood of 1998 caused tremendous sufferings due to their socio-economic conditions in the society. It was noticeable that although women were more vulnerable to disasters they did play the most crucial role for coping with disasters. Women faced severe problems to protect their families during flood. Among those the poor people suffer from lack of food, clothing...\n\nBangladesh, a disaster-prone South Asian country, is affected by the multiple issues of climate change such as global warming, sea level rise, floods, and riverbank erosion. The issue of climate change has created unprecedented rural risks, shocks, and everyday problems in the lives of the people living in the borderlands of Bangladesh. Based on a field survey in the Northern parts of Bangladesh, Bhurungamari, this chapter details the experiences and perspectives of the rural villagers regarding the issues of floods and riverbank erosions. The work is theoretically based on the sustainable livelihoods framework (SLF). We interviewed 240 people from the villages under the Union Parishad of Bangosona hat, Paiker Chara, and Char Bhrungamari, situated in the district of Kurigram\n\nThis study examines flood-induced vulnerabilities among women in northern Bangladesh. Poor and disadvantaged women are more vulnerable to disasters than men due to the conditions that predispose them to severe disaster impacts. Women suffer from physical injuries and are often evicted from their dwellings due to floods. Difficulties in finding adequate shelter, food, safe water, and fuel for cooking, as well as problems in maintaining personal hygiene and sanitation, prevent women from performing their usual roles at home. All of these are problems related to women’s gender identity and social roles. Many poor and destitute women remain unemployed during and after floods. Women also suffer from domestic violence and are subject to harassment when taking shelter or refuge at community centers. These particular vulnerabilities and problems interrupt women’s mitigation efforts and adaptation capacities in disaster risk reduction.\n\nOne of the major fallouts of the new development paradigm in India is the huge displacement of human population. In the wake of this, the government has come up with the National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy. But the policy has failed to address most of the crucial issues of resettlement and rehabilitation, especially concerning gender. One important but often ignored reason behind this is the inadequate attention given to various local institutions that play a very crucial role in the everyday survival and coping of the displaced population, particularly women. Based on an ethnographic study of the women displaced by Ganga erosion in Malda district of West Bengal, the present paper examines the role of such local institutions in the everyday lives of these women. The main finding is that the degree of vulnerability of displaced women depends upon their institutional affiliations and hence any rehabilitation and resettlement policy should take into consideration the vitali...\n\nFlood is one of the most common and devastating disasters in the northern region of Bangladesh. The objective of this research is to investigate how and to what extent flood has been affecting people’s livelihood and how men and women are taking steps to mitigate the impact and cope up with the situation. The research work was conducted based on a qualitative point of view and the lens of feminist research methodology. This study has revealed that flood-induced vulnerability affects men and women differently. Women experience the severity of the flood and household food insecurity much more than men as women are responsible for maintaining the household, taking care of everyone, and playing the role of buffer and absorber the impact. To mitigate the impact and cope up with the devastating effects of floods, men and women employ different strategies. While men go to nearer or far towns or cities for alternative livelihoods, women remain within the household and try to mitigate the i..."
