        "text": "The Mexican state of Chiapas is strongly Indian and traditional.\n\nIt's geologically complex and home to a staggering array of plants and animals.\n\nBut, it's the people who make it different, breathtakingly so.\n\nFunding for In the Americas with David Yetman was provided by Agnese Haury ♪ Funding for In the Americas with David Yetman was also provided by the Guilford Fund.\n\n♪ ♪ ♪ The State of Chiapas has a variety of cultures natural historical places, fauna, flora, geology unmatched anywhere else in the world.\n\nIt's a place of unequaled diversity.\n\nChiapas is the southernmost state in Mexico - it abuts Guatemala.\n\nMore than half the state is in rugged mountains with profound canyons.\n\nThe most famous is Sumidero Canyon.\n\nThe gateway to this deep chasm is the ancient city of Chiapa de Corzo.\n\nIt's a half hour drive through the clouds to the overlook of the canyon.\n\nSumidero Canyon is a national park in Mexico.\n\nIt has a supreme advantage of being able to view the canyon from the top, look down 3,000 feet and from the bottom, which you can get to by water.\n\nWe have the advantage of having a native archeologist show us what she has discovered.\n\nYou can know the river at its bank, but when you go to the top of the canyon, you see the magnitude, the importance and strength that this river has.\n\nThe first complete successful exploration of the canyon was was done by the group known as Pañuelo Rojo, or red bandana.\n\nBefore them, there were many explorers who unfortunately failed to conquer the canyon The Pañuelo Rojo group was dedicated to explore all around the top of the canyon before thy descended to the Chicoasén Dam.\n\nOnce completed, they submitted their reports about how dangerous the circumnavigation was.\n\nThis happened in 1960.\n\nIf you have heard of Chiapa de Corzo, you know that Corzo is great.\n\nIt has the big river next to it and it is the entrance to Sumidero Canyon from the river.\n\nThe Canyon is a great representive icon for the municipality and the state.\n\nFrom a social perspective, the canyon, is one of the most important natural preserves and producers of oxygen.\n\nIt has a lot of trees and wildlife.\n\nIt is located on an important trade route and a communication path historically and continuing to this day.\n\nI grew up on the banks of the river, and in my childhood, I learned to float there.I learned to breathe,to manage the water resource as it provides us food,fish.\n\nWe learn to live in concert with the river.\n\nWe have to be friends with the river.\n\nNow it is dangerous because there are dangerous places, such as the eddies, that you have to know about.\n\nWe must first respect it, care for it, so that it can also be a friend of ours.\n\nFortunately, in 1980, Sumidero Canyon was declared a national park and that has helped in the conservation of this place and our city.\n\nit was much greater in the past, but we still have time to save it for future generations.\n\nA few thousand feet below, Chiapa de Corzo sits on the banks of the great Rio Grijalva.\n\nThe city is home to a very old culture and its fiesta is unlike any other.\n\nSo, here's the traditional drink of Chiapa de Corzo.\n\nIt is called pozol and I have to choose whether I want the dark with cocoa in it or the white.\n\nSalud!\n\nTha'ts good.\n\nThat's good, it tastes, It's very much like a rich cocoa with cornmeal in it.\n\nSo she's drunk this ever since she was a little kid.\n\nI's a traditional thing to drink it in the morning with everything they serve it with food.\n\nSo, it has to be served in what they call the jícara, this old this old gourd, otherwise it's not really legitimate pozol.\n\nIt kind of fills you up in a very solid way.\n\nThis is nutritious pozol.\n\nSo, that combination of fruits is very elaborate as a neighborhood adornment that they take to various churches They beforehand figure out who's going to do where so they don't conflict with each other.\n\nBut, there's gobs of these happening throughout the fiesta and they are elaborately strung withlimes, pineapples, bananas, coconuts.\n\nAnd each neighborhood is sort of in competition for the church So, this is kind of a welcome to the saint who's the patron saint of the fiesta and its been a year since he's been welcomed.\n\nSo they take them up to the church up here and that's just one of the opening salvos of the fiesta of Saint Sebastian in Chiapo de Corzo.\n\nThose big figures that are kind of grotesque like clowns,their job is to lighten things up for everybody, to make the atmosphere happy.\n\nWe take a break from the fiesta to ride into the canyon in a bo It gives a view of the wild canyon walls and rock art and variety of flora and fauna.\n\nI'm glad we're in the boat.\n\nNoemi says she was born right there so she lived all her life along the edge of the river here The river originates in Guatemala,it's a long way away, it's 730 kilometers long before it dumps into the Gulf of Mexico So, we can see the old original remnants of the old bridge here, the old rusty orange remnants.\n\nSo this was built in 1950, the new bridge.\n\nHere we see cormorants, ducks.\n\nThey generally have a grey color and we see over there a flock of black vultures.\n\nThese are fundamental for the conservation of Sumidero Canyon.\n\nThere're important relationships between animals and plants here.\n\nIf an animal dies or something, the vultures consume the rotten meat to absorb it back into the ecosystem.\n\nIn this part of the canyon, the river is alive with crocodiles and on the sides of the banks you'll see many many iguanas and a variety of birds.\n\nYou'll see cormorants, various herons, you'll see even a couple of ibises.\n\nWhat is amazing is that they survive still with the pollution that the river experiences.\n\nAnd the crocodiles seem to be quite fat.\n\nWell, they live on fish and there are fewer fish, far fewer fish than there used to be.\n\nBut still, it's a pretty exciting place to see wildlife.\n\nIt's a protected area.\n\nYou can't hike in here, you can't get out of the boat.\n\nSo it's about as pristine as you're going to find anywhere in the country.\n\nIt's been here for a long time, this is old limestone over 100 million years old but the canyon itself is only about 15 million years old.\n\nSo as this limestone is uplifted the river very slowly cut through it and pretty soon we have this incision here, this great chasm.\n\nAnd you can see the layers of the limestone.\n\nThis limestone here was once at the bottom of the ocean.\n\nThis is actually rainforest.\n\nHow do we know?\n\nBecause there are monkeys in here.\n\nThe humidity increases, the amount of rain over 80 inches per year, it's an astonishingly wet place with a variety of trees.\n\nA mixture of cultures exists here.\n\nThere is a mixture of cultures between Meccas among Chiapanecas among Zoques among Mayas.\n\nThis was a watercourse of a cultural exchange of commodities and knowledge.\n\nAlthough there are traces of occupational evidence from the Olmeca state, such as rough tuxtla figures.\n\nThe strongest evidence found here are from the Chiapaneca culture.\n\nWhen the Spanish began their wars of conquest here in 1521, 1527, the Chiapanecas decided to flee along the river before being conquered by the Spaniards.\n\nThese people, the Chiapanecas, about who noemi is speaking of and is studying, nobody knows exactly who they were.\n\nBut they were clearly here at the time of conquest, they were different from the Olmecs, they were different from the Mayas, they were perhaps people who came from Nicaragua.\n\nBut it's really intriguing the studies that Noemi is doing to know that the Chiapanecas were here and maybe they, made the paintings that she is studying, the rock art.\n\nSo, some of the paintings that she is studying are above, way above the current water line because the river used to get higher than it does now.\n\nThose are now protected because the water is so low that graffiti artists can't get at them.\n\nThe lower ones have been defaced but the ones that are really high you can study at least from a distance.\n\nSo, this formation is called the Christmas Tree and with very good reason.\n\nAnd Noemi explains that during the wet season, we're in January which is the dry season, there's a lot of water that comes out there and has created these sort of cave formations.\n\nFrom Chiapa de Corzo, we follow an old highway route into the highlands where indigenous cultures dominate the countryside.\n\nIn the late 1990s, these highlands were the setting for a powerful Indian rebellion whose leaders referred to themselves as Zapatistas.\n\nThe uprising, armed and well planned, shook the roots of Mexican society and continues to do so.\n\nWe are fortunate to visit one of the most Indian towns in the state.\n\nThis is the town of Tenejapa in the state of Chiapas, Mexico.\n\nit's a mountain town like many thousands of other mountain towns in Mexico surrounded by pine trees and oak trees.\n\nBut this town is very very different.\n\nIt is an Indian town, one of the most Indian towns in all the country and it has a fiesta that is unlike any I have ever seen and my guess is any other that you have ever seen.\n\nGuiding us into this complex world is anthropologist Gillian Newell.\n\nShe knows her way around the town and the people trust her.\n\nTenejapa maintains the essence of the tradition of the Maya culture left to us by our parents and grandparents.\n\nThe Mayordomo, or the community stewards, continue to remain strong in the task of each of the cultural activities during the ceremonial festivities.\n\nRight now we're having the opening presentation at this house and they're welcoming.\n\nSitting next to me is the administrator of the culture, a very important position in this town, it's a town of about 3,000 people and he has the very difficult position of watching over all of the, what they call the Mayordomos, the men in charge of the fiestas to make sure everything works right.\n\nThere are ten different fiestas in the town each year.\n\nIt is during the ceremony that posh is consumed.\n\nWe drink a little and then store it in our flasks so that we can finish the ceremony.\n\nI've been able to sample the posh at their insistence and found that it is highly acceptable though it is only about ten o'clock in the morning.\n\nThe Mayordomos, or stewards, are responsible mostly for safekeeping.\n\nFor example, protecting the clothing articles and necklaces of the saints.\n\nThey need to decorate on the altar and shelter more than anything else the dress, the necklaces of the saints, and also arrange what is holy within the church.\n\nOn the very day of the festival, they parade the saints around the main street of the town.\n\nThere are nine groups of Mayordomos, or stewards.\n\nEach group arranges and prepares their virgin and their saint to parade around the town.\n\nInside they have both wild and domesticated fruit as a backdrop for the adoring of Joseph and Mary, the two saints we see.\n\nSo these are the vestments that the women are carrying for all of the saints that they use in the church.\n\nSo these big bags, then, are full of the clothing, the vestments, that they use for the saints and for adorning the sacred objects.\n\nSo, San Ildefonso is the patron saint of this town.\n\nThe person who carries the cross has a very special status.\n\nHe is the first assistant to the festival.\n\nSo in this town, the Mayordomos, sort of the local chieftains who are in charge of a saint, and the town has various saints.\n\nEach Mayordomo is in charge of one of those saints.\n\nOne of the things they do that is very important is three times a year, they wash, they launder the clothing of the saints and they take it to a special place.\n\nThe musicians start every ceremony and without the musicians starting it, you can█t really have the ceremony.\n\nThe bromeliads that you can see from time to time, the gentleman next to me is actually one of the Mayordomos.\n\nThey view with great reverence █ it█s wild,it█s sturdy,it doesn█t wilt, and it█s a red color.\n\nFlowers this size are not real common so they have to spend a lot of time picking them.\n\nIf someone was carrying one of those, you can bet that is an important person and only the men get to do it.\n\nWell, we're seeing a community ritual where different parts come together.\n\nOn the one hand, you have the community with nature, you have the community with the saints, have the community really with life and everything life presents.\n\nSo right now we're being given Coca Cola which to many people will seem jarring, right?\n\nBut it's to lift the spirits, right?\n\nWe just had an event where we were inside, you had the music, you had the dancing which is very rhythmic.\n\nAnd it's rhythmic in the sense that it sort of captures the heart.\n\nThe posh It is a drink that is really for the spirit.\n\nWhen we got to the town, the minister of culture who graciously allowed us to come in here, led us through a street and then through the narrowest of alleys.\n\nSo is it select people who come here?\n\nWho comes to this?\n\nWell, you go into a different dimension almost.\n\nYou are leaving the public life, you are leaving your public self and you go to your inner spirit really.\n\nSo, going through the alley symbolizes that, you know?\n\nThe vientre to the womb.\n\nWhere we all started, we all started in the same way.\n\nSo the ritual represents that.\n\nAt some point the women said to me, You need to be here.\n\nAnd I left the role of being the teacher of the Unicach and the people who were accompanying you, to being the woman.\n\nSo, the ritual celebrates that.\n\nIt celebrates life,it celebrates the life force.\n\nSeparation is really clear.\n\nWomen are on the left, men are are on the right.\n\nIt goes to sort of the organization of life.\n\nThe fact that the women have included me means a lot, it means an entry.\n\nReally, if you are a woman, it means you have children, it means you've been married.\n\nThe women eat after the men which in oriental terms means you k now we see it as discrimination.\n\nthe way the world is, right?\n\ng So, the people said hello to us and then we had to say hello to everybody.\n\nThey pulse you, you know?\n\nThey measure your strength, they measure how much you are able of being, of doing, of talking.\n\nIts connection to the earth, its connection to the continuation of life.\n\nEach family is associated with a water hole, with a place of living, with a lineage, and with a force of nature, right?\n\nWhich connects to a bigger clan system which then connect to a patron saint of that clan system, of that way of life.\n\nOne god, the air, the sun, all those elements play their own role so every different family has their role in the community.\n\nThey're together,but each person has their own individual role.\n\nSo, I pointed out that my hat, they said it's because it's American, and I said, Well, it really isn't, it's made in Australia, and I pointed out where it says on the hatband Made in Australia.\n\nAnd he pulled his off and pointed to an imaginary hatband and said, Made in Tenejapa.\n\nNow, they're studying us as much as we're studying them.\n\nRight, exactly.\n\nAbsolutely, absolutely.\n\nIt's a curiosity of who we are.\n\nIt's warm, it's heavy.\n\nI think at night it would be very nice, but in full sun, um, I feel like I'm being led to a sacrificial altar.\n\nThere is a hierarchy, a first and second Mayordomo, that must be present for the ceremony Musicians play an important role women, the wives of the Mayordomos.\n\nthe ceremony, prayer, this must be performed by the main character.\n\nAnd they need to decorate every altar with the canchi it is this wild fruit.\n\nAnd the cupal then, the cupal is a very important food as an offering to a saint.\n\nWhich, in this case, it is Saint Alonzo.\n\nI have been studying archeology for four years and archeology practically goes beyond that which we are witnessing now.\n\nIt is much older and one must take into account the creation of our civilization.\n\nAnd we are Mayas Tztetal, always starting in what many researchers call preclassic time And what we're actually seeing here is the result of the development of our culture through time.\n\nAnd really, the Maya culture is here, we witness it every day in each ceremony, in each ritual and each Mayordomo will continue to practice all that.\n\nIt's a continuation that has been going on for 2,000 years.\n\nWe are practically a product of that world - of what is called the Pre-Hispanic Maya.\n\nIn the state of Chiapas, the lowlands are dominated primarily by Mestizos.\n\nIn the highlands, they are dominated primarily by Originarios, as the Indians call themselves It's there that the ancient traditions prevail as do the conflicts between the Indians and the government.\n\nFunding for In the Americas with David Yetman was provided by Agnese Haury
