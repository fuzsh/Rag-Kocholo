        "text": "c. AD 250-900 Classical Maya city states flourish in the far south of modern-day Mexico, as well as in neighbouring Guatemala and Belize, before suffering a mysterious collapse.\n\nc. AD 0-500 - Major cultural and religious centre of TeotihuacÃ¡n flourishes. Thought to have been one of the world's largest cities at the time, but little is known about its ethnic and political nature.\n\n6th-7th century - Influx of new peoples into central Mexico from the north, including speakers of Nahuatl.\n\n800-1000 - High point of the Toltec culture, centred on the city of Tula, in modern-day Hidalgo province.\n\n10th-16th centuries - Revitalised Maya civilisation blossoms in the northern Yucatan peninsula, creating major cities such as Chichen Itza and Uxmal.\n\n1428-1521 - The latest of a long line of indigenous civilisations, the Aztec Empire - an alliance of Nahuatl-speaking city states led by Tenochtitlan - establishes hegemony over much of central Mexico.\n\n1521-1820 - Mexico forms part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain.\n\nIndependence\n\n1810-21 - War of Independence ends with the creation of the short-living Mexican Empire, which includes Central America to the southern border of modern-day Costa Rica, as well as what is now the southwestern US.\n\n1824 - Mexico becomes a federal republic. Central American provinces secede, becoming Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica.\n\nThe new Mexican state is marked by tension between the conservative Spanish-origin landowning elite and the largely indigenous landless minority, resulting in instability and frequent armed conflict.\n\n1836 - Former province of Texas, by now increasingly populated by English-speaking Americans, secedes after a war, going on to join the United States nine years later.\n\n1846-8 - Mexican-American War ends with Mexico being forced to sell its northern provinces (including modern-day California, Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona and Utah) to the US.\n\n1855-72 - \"La Reforma\" period, characterised by liberal reforms limiting the power and landholdings of the Catholic Church.\n\n2007 October - Heavy rains flood nearly the entire southern state of Tabasco. Some 500,000 are made homeless in one of the country's worst natural disasters.\n\n2009 March - Army troops enter Ciudad Juarez, on the border with the US, as open warfare erupts between rival drug gangs.\n\n2012 July - The Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) candidate Enrique Pena Nieto wins presidential election.\n\n2013 July - Miguel Angel Trevino Morales, head of the brutal Zetas drugs cartel, is arrested in the highest-profile arrest since President Pena Nieto adopted a policy of targeting local bosses rather than big names.\n\n2014 August - Mexico's Congress approves sweeping reforms to the country's energy sector that will open the market to foreign oil firms and strip state-owned energy group Pemex of the monopoly it has held since nationalisation in 1938.\n\n2018 October - The US, Canada and Mexico reach a new trade deal - the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) - to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta).\n\n2018 - Left-wing former mayor of Mexico City, Andres Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador, is inaugurated president after winning an overwhelming victory in the July presidential election."
