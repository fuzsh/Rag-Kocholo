        "text": "edit\n\nIntroduction\n\nTuxtla Gutierrez is the capital and the largest city of the Mexican southeast state of Chiapas. It is the most developed, populated and therefore the state's most important municipality. A busy government, commercial and services-oriented city, Tuxtla (as it is commonly known) had one of the fastest growing rates in Mexico in the last 40 years. Unlike many other areas in Chiapas, it is not a tourist attraction, but a transportation hub for tourists coming into the state, with a major airport and a bus terminal.\n\nedit\n\nWeather\n\nTuxtla Gutierrez features a tropical wet and dry climate under the Köppen climate classification. With its relatively low altitude, the area has a hot and relatively humid climate with most rain falling in the summer. Except for a rainy and dry season (summer-fall and winter-spring respectively) there is little variation in the climate during the year. Even the distinction between the rainy and dry season features a quantity of rain.\n\nedit\n\nGetting There\n\nBy Plane\n\nSince opening in 2006, Ángel Albino Corzo International Airport, with IATA code TGZ, has become one of the more important airports in the country and the busiest in Southwestern Mexico, with 1,388,706 passengers traveling in 2018. It is also one of the most modern facilities in the country, covering 740 hectares. It's cost was about one billion pesos to build and was funded by government and private investors. There is taxi service from the airport to Chiapa de Corzo and the city and bus service to the First Class station and to San Cristobal de las Casas. The new facility can receive direct flights from the United States. Central America and South America. As of January 2019, there are direct flights to Mexico City, Guadalajara, Monterrey, Cancun, Puebla, Tijuana and Mérida.\n\nedit\n\nSleep\n\nedit\n\nKeep Connected\n\nInternet\n\nInternet cafe's are widely available and you generally can find one in the direct vicinity. Sometimes photocopy stores or photo processing stores will double as an internet cafe with a couple of computers. Look for signs reading \"Acceso a Internet\" or \"Cibernautica\" or \"Cibercafe\". Charges range from approx. US$1 an hour to US$3 an hour, depending on the location.\n\nPhone\n\nSee also International Telephone Calls\n\nPhone cards can be purchased anywhere and are needed for the majority of public phones. To call any number outside your region you have to dial 01 then followed by the area code. If calling a cellphone from a normal phone start with with 044 if the cell phone is registered in the same state where you are calling from or 045 if the cell phone in registered in another state. If calling cellphone to cellphone just dial the 10-digit number. To make an international call dial 00 followed by the country code then the local number. To call to Mexico, also dial 00 (most of the times) followed by the national code 52. For a landline you would have to dial 0052 + (area code) + (8 digit local landline number) for a cell phone you would have to call 0052 (1) followed by the 10 digit cell phone number.\n\nPost\n\nThe Mexican postal service is operated by Correos de México. The post service in Mexico is pretty good although not very cheap. It is reliable regarding the sending of postcards, but it takes at least a week to send it to other countries (US/Canada), more so if you send it to Europe or Australia. For packages it is better to use international services like FedEx or UPS. If you are sending a package internationally with the Mexican postal service, take the package OPEN to the post office, they may want to inspect it. Seal it up at the post office. Post offices typically open from 8:00am to 6:00pm Monday to Friday, and 9:00am to 1:00pm Saturday. You will find post offices (Oficina de Correos) is almost any town or city in Mexico. To buy stamps it is best to go to the post office, although you can also get them at stamp machines, located outside the post offices, at bus stations, airports and some commercial establishments."
