        "text": "Schools for Chiapas has compiled this comprehensive timeline with hundreds of entries relating to the Zapatistas and the rebellion in Chiapas.\n\nYou can also read a basic introduction to the Zapatistas here, and watch a short introduction video here.\n\nSources: Enlace Zapatista, ezln.org, El Kilombo Intergaláctico, Global Exchange, Chiapas Support Committee, Kiptik, casa collective, La Jornada, Building Bridges in Chiapas Project.\n\nKEY DATES 10 – 20 – 30 years.\n\n1983 Formation of the EZLN\n\n1993/4 Uprising in Chiapas, January 1st.\n\n2003 Autonomous Municipalities launched\n\n2012/13 40,000+ Zapatistas march into five towns in Chiapas, the biggest public demonstration to date.\n\nRelevant Historical Background.\n\n300-900 CE: Mayans settle in the area we call Chiapas, Mexico\n\n250 CE: The Mayan civilization, centered in the Yucatán peninsula, becomes one of the most dominant of the region’s groups, reaching its peak around the sixth century A.D., during the Classic period of Mesoamerican history. The Maya excelled at pottery, hieroglyph writing, calendar-making and mathematics, and left an astonishing amount of great architecture.\n\n1519-21: Spanish conquistadors led by Hernán Cortés oversee the conquest of the Aztecs and Maya – 500 years of domination and exploitation begins.\n\n1528: Spanish conquistador Captain Diego Mazariegos arrives in Chiapas, declares himself first Lieutenant Governor of Chiapas (1528 – 1529), and settles in Villa Real de Chiapa (later renamed San Cristóbal de las Casas).\n\nLate 1500s: More than half of the Mayan population killed by disease and repression.\n\n1712: Spanish tribute demands along with crop failures create an indigenous Tzeltal uprising in Chiapas – Spaniards brutally put it down.\n\n1810: September, 16. Father Manuel Hidalgo calls for Mexican Independence from Spain in “El Grito de Dolores”, and this becomes Mexican Independence day. War of Independence ensues, and Spanish are defeated.\n\n1824: Chiapas changes from under the dominion of Guatemala to being a Mexican state, which benefits the ruling elites.\n\n1867-70: Indigenous rebellion over taxation, market control and religious freedom in Chamula, a Tzotsil stronghold in the Chiapas Highlands. Once again brutally put down by the Spanish Crown forces based in the garrison town of Cuidad Real (San Cristóbal de las Casas).\n\n1910: Beginning of the epic 10-year long Mexican revolution, triggered by unrest amongst peasants and urban workers. Due to its geographical isolation, Chiapas remains relatively untouched by events in the rest of revolutionary Mexico.\n\n1911: Mexico’s dictator, Porfirio Diaz, is overthrown. The new president is Francisco Madero, a liberal. Madero introduces land reform and labor legislation. Political unrest continues with Emiliano Zapata leading a peasant revolt in the south. Again, Chiapas is barely affected by land reform or the changes in the structure of power.\n\n1919: Assassination of Emiliano Zapata, at Chinameca, on the 10th April. With his death, the true revolutionary potential of the Mexican Revolution is lost.\n\n1928-1970s: The pace of land reform continues to stagnate in Chiapas, culminating with thousands of indigenous being forced off arable land and into the sparsely populated Lacandon jungle.\n\n1968: Tlatelolco Massacre. Student demonstration during the Olympic Games is fired upon by Mexican security forces in Tlatelolco, Mexico City. Hundreds of protesters are killed and wounded, and thousands are arrested. The ensuing months of repression of the social movement lead many activists into clandestinity and the formation of guerilla nuclei.\n\n1974: Diocese of San Cristóbal de las Casas organizes the Indigenous Congress – 1200 delegates from 300 communities come together to demand land reform, education in indigenous languages, health care and labor rights.\n\n1979: “Plan de Ayala” created by the Chiapas-based National Coordinating Committee – two dozen peasant communities declare themselves independent of the government.\n\n1982: The new governor of Chiapas, General Absalon Castellanos Dominguez, increases military repression in the face of indigenous rebellion – his forces kill 102 campesinos, 327 more disappear, 590 imprisoned, 427 kidnapped and tortured, 407 families forced to move and 54 communities are overrun by security forces in an attempt to quell rebellion.\n\n1982: Activists from the National Liberation Forces (FLN), including Marcos, arrive in Chiapas.\n\nNov. 17, 1983: The EZLN (Ejercito Zapatista Liberacion Nacional, or Zapatista National Liberation Army) is founded by three indigenous activists and three mestizos.\n\n1985 – Earthquake in Mexico City kills thousands and makes many more homeless. An active civil society arises to act in solidarity with victims where the government has let the people down.\n\n1986: EZLN enters its first indigenous community at the invitation of local leaders.\n\n1988: Carlos Salinas, PRI, steals the Presidential election from Cauhtemoc Cárdenas.\n\n1989: The EZLN grows to 1300 armed members.\n\n1992: President Salinas “reforms” Article 27 of the Mexican Constitution to allow for privatization of ejidos (community landholdings), effectively ending land reform.\n\n1993: Zapatista communities approve a military offensive by the EZLN. The Clandestine Indigenous Revolutionary Committee-General Command (CCRI-CG) is formed to lead it.\n\n1994: Uprising and peace talks\n\nJanuary 1st: Uprising! The Zapatistas declares war on the Mexican government on behalf of the country’s indigenous people. They launch their uprising on this day because it is the date the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) goes into effect. From their base in Mexico’s southernmost state of Chiapas, the Zapatistas seize government offices and occupy thousands of acres of private land. The insurgents demand democracy, liberty, and justice for all Mexicans. The EZLN’s General Command issues the First Declaration of the Lacandon Jungle, and the municipalities of San Cristóbal de las Casas, Ocosingo, Las Margaritas, Altamirano, Chanal, Oxchuc, and Huixtan are all taken by the rebels.\n\nEarly January: The Mexican army responds by sending troops to the state. Firefights last for 12 days. Representatives of national and international human rights groups swarm into the state. After a series of pitched battles causing 145 deaths and hundreds of casualties, both sides agree to a cease-fire.\n\nFebruary 21: Dialogue for peace between the EZLN and the federal government, moderated by San Cristóbal’s bishop Samuel Ruiz García, held in the cathedral of San Cristóbal de las Casas. The EZLN declares that the results of the talks will be submitted to a long consultation among all the Zapatista communities and civilian bases of support.\n\nMarch 24: Assassination of PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, probably by another faction of the PRI. Due to the unstable political climate, the EZLN’s consultations are temporarily suspended.\n\nApril 9: Bishop Samuel Ruiz, mediator in the peace talks, is nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for the first time.\n\nJune 12, 1994: The Second Declaration of the Lacandon Jungle is issued by the EZLN. The results of the consultation are made public: 97.88% reject the government’s proposals for reaching a definitive solution to the conflict, while only 2.11% are in favor of signing peace. However, only 3.26% manifest a desire to return to hostilities, so the decision is made to continue abiding by the cease-fire, while opening a new dialogue with civil society.\n\nAugust 5-9: Civil society mobilized in the jungle: The National Democratic Convention (CND) is held in EZLN territory, Chiapas, with more than 6,000 people from around the country in attendance to dialogue with the Zapatistas.\n\nLate August: The new PRI presidential candidate, Ernesto Zedillo, wins by a landslide.\n\nOctober 11: Peace talks end. The EZLN breaks off all talks with the federal government, citing continued repression, a build-up of the Mexican army’s forces around their territory, and increased military provocations.\n\nDecember 19: The EZLN launches a new, “nonviolent” military offensive in Chiapas with the help of the civilian population. Overnight, over half of Chiapas is declared “rebel territory” without a single shot being fired, as Zapatistas announce the formation of 38 autonomous municipalities, an area roughly the size of the state of Maryland.\n\nLate December: Financial crisis – The Mexican government announces that it will default on loan payments to the International Monetary Fund. The Mexican peso goes into a free fall, losing half its value. A month later, in a leaked memo, Chase Manhattan Bank issues a report calling for the Mexican government to “eliminate the Zapatistas” in order to stabilize the country.\n\n1995: Military offensive and new peace talks in San Andres\n\nJanuary 1st: Third Declaration of the Lacandon Jungle is issued by the EZLN, calling for the creation of a National Liberation Movement.\n\nFebruary 9, 1995: The federal government suddenly launches a military offensive against the EZLN and their communities of supporters, both inside and outside of Chiapas. President Zedillo, in a dramatic television appearance, announces arrest warrants for the “top Zapatista leadership”, unilaterally breaking the cease-fire. The EZLN, however, retreats into the mountains, as do most of their support bases, and refuses to return fire against the government troops. Implementing a strategy of civilian-targeted warfare, the army displaces 20,000 campesinos, destroys Zapatista headquarters and starts constructing new military bases all over the territory.\n\nThe army fails to locate the CCRI-CG(General Command) of the EZLN in order to apply the arrest warrants. However, several dozen people in Chiapas, Mexico State, Veracruz, and Mexico City are arrested, tortured, and jailed on trumped-up terrorism charges for supposedly being members of the EZLN.\n\nMarch 11: Upon tacitly recognizing the failure of the military operation, the Mexican Congress approves (and the President signs) the Law for Dialogue, Reconciliation, and a Just Peace in Chiapas. The law calls for a reinitiation of peace talks, a suspension of military operations against the EZLN, a suspension of arrest warrants against its supposed leadership. A legislative commission, the Commission on Concordance and Pacification (Cocopa), will be in charge of facilitating and laying the bases for this new dialogue.\n\nAugust: Zapatistas hold the first international consulta (consultation, or plebiscite) to let all Mexicans, and even foreigners, vote on the EZLN’s demands, as well as on the very future of the rebel organization. Over one million people vote to support the Zapatista proposal to transform the EZLN into an independent political force. The consulta represents the EZLN’s greatest success yet in opening up dialogue with civil society.\n\nSeptember 10, 1995: The EZLN proposes six major themes for the new dialogue: Indigenous Rights and Culture; Democracy and Justice; Welfare and Development; Reconciliation in Chiapas; Rights of Women in Chiapas; and, finally, the Cessation of Hostilities.\n\nOctober 18-22: The first phase of the San Andrés talks is held between the EZLN and the Federal Government with regards to Indigenous Rights and Culture.\n\nOctober 28: The EZLN suspends the “red alert”, and announces it will attend the upcoming second phase of peace talks in San Andrés regarding Indigenous Rights and Culture.\n\nDecember, 1995: The EZLN responds to the destruction of their headquarters in La Realidad by constructing five autonomous centers of resistance (“Aguascalientes“) in the villages of La Realidad, Oventic, La Garrucha, Morelia and Roberto Barrios.\n\nDecember 31, 1995/January 1, 1996: The Fourth Declaration of the Lacandon Jungle is issued by the EZLN, calling for the formation of a new Zapatista organization–the Zapatista Front of National Liberation (FZLN)–which is to be a national, nonviolent, and independent civilian political force with its base in the EZLN. This carries out the EZLN’s promise to abide by the results of the Consulta.\n\n1996: Negotiating the San Andres Peace Accords, and the first Intercontinental Encuentro.\n\nJanuary 3-10: The first National Indigenous Forum is held in San Cristóbal de las Casas, attended by 24 comandantes of the EZLN, as well as nearly 500 representatives of over 30 indigenous groups from throughout the country.\n\nFebruary 16th: The Zapatistas and the federal government sign the first set of accords resulting from the Dialogue of San Andrés: 40 pages of national reforms to be undertaken regarding Indigenous Rights and Culture. But Comandante David warns: “This is only a small agreement, on paper. We will not be tricked into thinking that what has been signed is a peace agreement.”\n\nMarch 21: The negotiations on the issue of Democracy and Justice begin in San Andrés. The dialogue becomes a monologue, however, as the government’s representatives refuse to discuss any of the EZLN’s proposals.\n\nJuly/August: First Zapatista Intercontinental Encuentro (Meeting) for Humanity and Against Neoliberalism. Thousands of people from around the world come to the Chiapas jungle to attend.\n\nAugust 1, 1996: Schools for Chiapas was officially born during “The First Intergalactic”, as the international community and the autonomous Mayan communities gathered together for the first mass encuentro.\n\nAugust 12th: The plenary session in San Andres on Democracy and Justice ends with no agreement between the parts.\n\nOctober 9th, 1996: Comandanta Ramona represents the Zapatistas at the Permanent National Indigenous Congress in Mexico City. She is the first Zapatista to appear publicly outside of Chiapas.\n\nDecember: President Zedillo formally rejects the San Andres Accords. This decision plunges the peace process into crisis.\n\n1997: Peace talks breakdown, Acteal massacre\n\nJanuary 11th, 1997: The EZLN meets with the inter-party Peace Commission COCOPA in La Realidad, and rejects the government’s counterproposal. The EZLN reiterates that it will not return to the negotiating table with the government until the San Andrés Accords on Indigenous Rights and Culture are implemented.\n\nJanuary – March: Military and police presence and repression dramatically increase in Chiapas while the peace process stalls.\n\nFebruary 1st: 9,000 civilian Zapatistas march through San Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapas, demanding the government honor the San Andrés Accords on Indigenous Rights and Culture.\n\nApril-July: Dozens of murders of mainly civilian Zapatistas in the northern zone of Chiapas, killed by pro-government paramilitary squads or police.\n\nSeptember 8: 1,111 members of the EZLN (representing 1,111 Zapatista base communities) travel to Mexico City to be present for the founding of the Zapatista National Liberation Front (FZLN), the civil political arm of the movement.\n\nDecember 22nd, 1997: Acteal massacre. The “Peace and Justice” paramilitary group, affiliated with the PRI, attack the hamlet of Acteal in the Highlands of Chiapas, where refugees from recent paramilitary attacks are taking refuge. The attackers launch a 5-hour killing spree, murdering 45 people–mostly women and children–and wounding 25 others. Despite their proximity to the site of the attack, the public security police do not intervene.\n\n1998: Military attacks on Zapatista Municipalities\n\nJanuary: The EZLN does not respond militarily to the paramilitary offensive, insisting it still wants to see a political solution to the conflict.\n\nJanuary 12: Demonstrations are held worldwide to protest the violence in Chiapas and demand the compliance of the San Andres accords. In Ocosingo, Chiapas during a peaceful demonstration, the state security police opens fire, killing one indigenous women and injuring two children.\n\nFebruary: The Zedillo administration begins a campaign to expel foreign human rights observers from Chiapas. Over the 150 are expelled during the next two years.\n\nApril 11, 1998: The army launches an attack on various Zapatista autonomous centers. Over 1,000 troops and police violently invade four communities, arresting community leaders.\n\nIn the newly declared autonomous municipality of Ricardo Flores Magon, in the town of Taniperlas, hundreds of state and federal police, along with the army and immigration officials, destroy the municipal offices, beat local inhabitants, and arrest and incarcerate dozens, including 12 foreigners, who are deported.\n\nMay 1: Police, military and immigration officials launch an assault on the autonomous municipality of Tierra y Libertad, located in the town of Amparo Agua Tinta. 53 people are arrested.\n\nJune: The army invades the Zapatista community of San Juan de Libertad, leading to a firefight between military and indigenous locals. Eight civilians and one policeman are killed.\n\nJune-December: Zapatista autonomous municipalities continue to operate despite the military repression, due to a groundswell of popular support in the region.\n\n1999: National and international consultation\n\nMarch: The Zapatistas organize La Consulta (the plebiscite) on Indigenous Rights and Culture, in order to pressurize the government into implementing the signed San Andres accords. The Zapatistas send one man and one woman (5,000 civilian Zapatistas in total) to every municipality in the country\n\nMarch 21: Three million Mexicans vote to demand the implementation of the San Andres Accords.\n\nApril: State police occupy the autonomous community of San Andres Sakamch’em, site of the San Andres Accords, and install a PRI mayor. The next day, 3,000 unarmed Zapatistas nonviolently force the police to leave the town and re-install their own elected authorities.\n\nAugust: The military deploys paratroopers to occupy the remote village of Amador Hernandez, the final link in plans to build a road that will encircle the Zapatistas in the Lacandon Jungle. The community resists with nonviolent protests, but the military encampment remains.\n\n2000: Fall of the PRI\n\nJanuary: Low-intensity warfare continues in Chiapas.\n\nSpring 2000: Zapatista communities register to vote in historic numbers in preparation for upcoming elections in which the “old dictatorship” PRI will lose their monopoly on power.\n\nJuly 2, 2000: Opposition presidential candidate Vicente Fox, of the center-right National Action Party (PAN), wins the presidential election by a landslide, in what is widely hailed as the country’s first democratic election. The governing PRI loses power for the first time in 70 years.\n\nNewly elected President Fox pledges to solve the Chiapas conflict “in 15 minutes.”\n\nAugust 2000: Following in Fox’s footsteps, Pablo Salazar wins the Chiapas gubernatorial race on a coalition ticket that unites several parties opposed to continued rule by the PRI.\n\nNovember 30: Fox assumes the presidency and the Zapatistas break a five-month long silence and call for the new administration to meet three conditions before peace talks can resume: withdraw troops from seven of the 250 military encampments, release all Zapatista political prisoners, and implement the San Andres Accords.\n\nDecember, 2000: President orders the army to withdraw from a few positions in the rebel area of Chiapas as a token goodwill gesture. Over the next five months he dismantles seven military bases and frees some of the Zapatista political prisoners. However, few real changes emerge, and the low intensity war and paramilitary attacks continue.\n\n2001: Zapatista Caravan goes to Mexico City\n\nJanuary: President Fox’s promise to implement the San Andres Accords falters as the army continues to maintain bases at five of the seven sites they must withdraw from before dialogue can start.\n\nSpring 2001: ‘The march of the people who are the colour of the earth‘ is launched from Chiapas, as twenty-four ski-masked Zapatista commanders, including Marcos, leave Chiapas on a caravan for indigenous rights, mobilizing hundreds of thousands as they tour the country.\n\nMarch 11: The Zapatista caravan enters the Zocalo, Mexico City, greeted by 250,000 people.\n\nApril 25: The senate unanimously approves a mutilated version of the San Andres Accords.

Some Basque groups respond by telling him to mind his own business.\n\nThe first displacement of indigenous villages begins in the Montes Azules biosphere reserve despite vigorous non-violent protest by locals and their supporters.\n\n2003 Birth of the Caracoles and the Autonomous Good Governments\n\nJanuary 1st: 15,000 masked Zapatistas gather in San Cristóbal to mark the ninth anniversary of the uprising, taking over the city for a night. It is the largest show of Zapatista strength to date.\n\nApril: The Zapatistas mobilize and speak out against the war on Iraq.\n\nSummer 2003: President Fox’s party, the PAN, loses badly in state and national mid-term congressional elections. The PRI regains control in many areas of the state.\n\nAugust 8, 9, 2003: Birth of the Caracoles and Junta. The Zapatistas implement the San Andrés accords themselves in their territories without government permission. A celebration is held in Oventic attended by more than ten thousand people. The Zapatistas formally declare the death of the Aguascalientes, and the birth of the five autonomous Caracoles, political and cultural centres, and their Good Government Juntas, who “govern by obeying”. This marks the full separation of the Zapatista civil and military structures and authorities, and the symbolic creation of full autonomy.\n\nAugust: Radio Insurgente, the Zapatista radio station, begins broadcasting.\n\nSeptember: In response to the birth of the Caracoles, the Mexican government and paramilitary groups step up harassment of the Zapatista communities.\n\nNovember 17, 2003: The Zapatistas celebrate the 20th anniversary of the founding of the EZLN.\n\n2004: Consolidating autonomy, defending territory\n\nJanuary 1: The 10th anniversary of the uprising, celebrated by large crowds in all five Caracoles.\n\nThe year is marked by an increase in military and police presence, and by renewed efforts to remove communities from the Montes Azules biosphere reserve “in the interests of preserving the jungle”.

Zapatista support bases block all major roads in Chiapas in solidarity with APPO. The “Oaxaca Commune” is destroyed.\n\nDecember: First phase of the Other Campaign draws to a close, having covered 45,000 kilometers across Mexico and mobilized hundreds of thousands of citizens.

EZLN Commanders return to Chiapas because of the increase in attacks on Zapatista communities by paramilitary groups. The attacks are part of a coordinated assault by paramilitaries and landowners to take back land ‘recuperated’ by the Zapatistas in 1994.\n\nJuly: More than 2,000 people attend The Second Encounter between the Zapatistas and the Peoples of the World is held in three of the Zapatista Caracoles – Oventik, Morelia and La Realidad.\n\nAugust: Two more Zapatista communities are expelled from Montes Azules.\n\nSeptember: Paramilitaries attack Zapatistas in Bolon Ajaw,\n\nSeptember 22: The EZLN suspends the Other Campaign tour in the face of the rapidly deteriorating situation faced by Zapatista communities: evictions, paramilitary attacks, invasions, persecution and threats.\n\n2008: Drug War in Mexico intensifies, violence against Zapatistas increases\n\nJanuary: The Third Encounter between the Zapatista Women and the Women of the World, named after Comandanta Ramona, is held over the New Year in La Garrucha.
