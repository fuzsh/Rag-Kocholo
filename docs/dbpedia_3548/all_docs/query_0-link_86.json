        "text": "[xviii], 163, (1), 252, 152pp. 6 copper-engraved plates, 1 portrait plate of Cortes, and 2 maps. Modern full dark brown morocco signed binding intricately tooled in blind on the spine and boards, leather lettering label, gilt, silk headbands worked in three colors: red, white and green. Double-marbled endpapers.\n\nThe portrait of Cortes, sometimes seen as a frontispiece, is here facing Book I, page 25. The upper right corner of the title page has been clipped, not affecting any text, but affecting the double border rules and has been restored in manuscript. The Cortes portrait is lightly foxed. The panorama has a closed marginal tear along the bottom just touching the image. Otherwise this is a clean, bright text with stunning illustrations.\n\nImportant resource by the Chronicler of the Indies on the conquest of Mexico by Spain, covering the three year period between the appointment of Cortes and the fall of the city of Mexico.\n\nPalau 318693. Sabin 86467. ESTC T135491.\n\n."
