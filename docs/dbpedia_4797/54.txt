Derby countdown | Kauai King, 1966

The Courier-Journal is recapping Derby winners in reverse order heading into the 141st Kentucky Derby on May 2. Today: The 95th winner, Kauai King (1966)

With division heavyweights Buckpasser and Graustark sidelined by injuries, Kauai King went wire to wire for a half-length victory over Advocator, after which jockey Don Brumfield of Nicholasville, Ky., proclaimed, “I’m the happiest hillbilly hardboot in the world.” It was the first Derby appearance for Brumfield, trainer Henry Forrest and owner Ford Stable and made Kauai King to date the only Derby winner born in Maryland. Kauai King also did what his sire couldn’t do, the head decision in the 1953 Derby to longshot Dark Star being the great Native Dancer’s only career loss. Kauai King’s mile in 1:35 remained the fastest for a Derby winner until Spend a Buck’s 1:34 4/5 in 1985. The Preakness gave Kauai King his fourth straight win, his Triple Crown bid dashed with a Belmont fourth. Against Forrest’s recommendation, the Derby winner ran back in Chicago’s Arlington Classic, suffering a career-ending injury when fifth to Buckpasser, who missed the Triple Crown with a hoof injury but went on to be Horse of the Year. Kauai King went on to be a stallion in Maryland, England and Japan, where he died in 1989.
