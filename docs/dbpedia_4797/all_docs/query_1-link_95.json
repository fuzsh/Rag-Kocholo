        "text": "The post-position draw for the $2 million Preakness (G1) is over. For the most part — unlike the Kentucky Derby (G1) — where a horse starts is unlikely to affect how a horse finishes.\n\nWhat is the most successful Preakness post position?\n\nThe Preakness, at 1 3/16 miles, is a sixteenth of a mile shorter than the 1 ¼-mile Derby. The field usually numbers about half as many as the 20-horse Derby. And there’s no calvary charge to the first turn.\n\nSince 1909, the most successful post has been post 6 with 17 winners. However, post 6 has produced only one winner since Oxbow in 2013. That was Rombauer in 2021.\n\nIn the past nine editions of the Preakness, the winningest post has been post 1 with three: American Pharoah in 2015, War of Will in 2019, and National Treasure in 2023. Prior to American Pharoah’s win, the last winner from post 1 was Tabasco Cat in 1994.\n\nSince 2014, posts 1-7 have each produced at least one Preakness winner.\n\nPreakness winners by year, followed by winning post position:\n\n1909 Effendi 4\n\n1910 Layminster 9\n\n1911 Watervale 1\n\n1912 Col.
