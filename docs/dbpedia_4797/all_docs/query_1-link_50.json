        "text": "Local dignitaries and state representatives came out to the Hanapepe Fields on Feb. 13 for Opening Day of the Kauai Senior Softball Association. Pat Baniaga welcomed teams and guests. Albert Carveiro was introduced and sang the national anthem and Hawaii Pono`i. Baniaga read the names of players who passed away last year: Teddy Daliglig, Sr., Joe Brun, Raymond Espino, Brian Silva and Yukie Shigeta.\n\nHe continued by introducing the 2016-2017 league officers.\n\nIncoming League Manager Jeffrey Kimoto introduced special guests and dignitaries. Attending were Councilmembers Mel Rapozo, Gary Hoosier, Ross Kagawa, Arryl Kaneshiro, Mason Chock, Kipukai Kualii, Rep. Ron Kouchi, Rep. Derek Kawakami, and Rep. Dee Morikawa.He continued with the introduction of 2015 winners and 2016 teams.\n\nThrowing the first pitch was Mayor Bernard Carvalho, Jr., batting was Angie Serota of the Da Kruzers team, and catching was Councilchair Mel Rapozo.\n\nLeague President Mike Curtis gave closing remarks.\n\nA total of 67 teams in eight divisions participated in this year’s Hawaii State Senior Softball Tournament that wrapped up Thursday on the Big Island.\n\nOf the eight division champions, five are from Kauai.\n\n“We did very well. We won every game by at least five runs,” said Kawaihau senior softball coach William “Bradda” Rittmeister on Saturday.\n\n“The success was because of the defense and because of the hitting,” Rittmeister said. “Everybody was hitting, from 1 to 10. They were just banging the ball all over the field.”\n\nKawaihau won the G division of the tourney, beating Pueo of the Big Island, 16-10.\n\n“They were leading in the first three innings, 5-0,” Rittmeister said. “Then in the fourth inning, we came back and tied the game. Then we went back and forth for one or two innings. Then in the sixth inning, Don Pezario hit a three-run homer. The rest of the game, the defense held.”\n\nThe Kawaihau coach added winning the title game was a great feeling.\n\n“For a bunch of old folks, it makes them feel happy going over there and winning it,” he said.\n\nIn the semifinal game, Kawaihau topped West Kauai, 8-6.\n\n“We thought we were going to lose to West Kauai,” Rittmeister said.\n\nThe other Kauai teams that won division titles were the Ohana Rebels in the B division, the Rookies in the C division, Bartek in the E division and the Kuku Aces in the H division.\n\nHANAMAULU — When Clifford Lee joined the Hanamaulu Hillsiders softball team four years ago, there was no pavilion.\n\nThere was work that needed to be done with the home field of the Hillsiders, and there were the players ready to do something about it.\n\nThursday, the pavilion at the Peter Rayno Sr. Park was dedicated by the County of Kauai.\n\n“This was just a vision four years ago,” Lee said. “There were a lot of people who came to give a hand, including the players’ wives, and other people.”\n\nSpearheaded by Kenneth Tamashiro Construction, Tamashiro a senior softball player himself, the Hanamaulu pavilion was funded through an $80,000 county grant.\n\n“How this was done is a model,” Mayor Bernard Carvalho Jr. said. “This pavilion is not just for the softball players. It’s for the community — the young people from the neighboring King Kaumualii Elementary School, and people in Hanamaulu.”\n\nLee was speaking with King Kaumualii vice principal Fig Mitchell, noting how they appreciated the help of the King Kaumualii “ladies who use this during their break.”\n\n“They helped us a lot,” Lee said. “When the students are here using the place, they jump in and talk to the kids if they get out of line.”\n\nKauai County Council Chair Mel Rapozo said they normally get calls only if there are complaints.\n\n“I want to see more projects like this,” Rapozo said. “When the community builds a facility like this, they own it.”\n\nTamashiro and the Kauai senior softball players are no strangers to undertaking these types of projects, having been involved in major work in Kapaa, Eleele, and Kaumakani fields.\n\n“This is not the end,” Lee said. “I want to continue to beautify the park, working with the school and the county. As long as I’m able and healthy, I want to move on to other areas where we can help.”\n\nJade Battad, officiating the dedication services, described the pavilion as “this is what love built.”"
