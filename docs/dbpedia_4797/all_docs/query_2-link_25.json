        "text": "In June, the Hawaii Department of Transportation (HDOT) granted the most contracts, worth $2,671,031,708, followed by the U.S. Navy, which granted $1,113,924,900 in contracts, and the City & County of Honolulu at $82,026,875. All told, 13 government agencies in Hawaii awarded $3,966,936,108 to 70 contractors. This was an increase of 2,384 percent over June 2021 when there were 31 contracts valued at $159,663,003.\n\nThis is news we can use, when as recently as May 2022 in Hawaii there was a loss of 1,600 jobs, or 4.3 percent, for construction, mining and logging, according to the Associated General Contractors of America. (Hawaii lumps all three of those industries in one).\n\nHDOT projects include: $2,645,511,801 to Hiilawe Construction LLC for pavement projects at various Big Island locations; $10,657,367 to Road Builders Corp. for street rehabilitation – Unit 89A; $8,633,000 to Grace Pacific LLC for road resurfacing and reconstruction from Mile Post 6.4 to Mile Post 10.43 on Maui.\n\nThe Navy awarded a $995,000,000 multiple-award construction contract for harbor projects in Hawaii and Wake Island to: Hawaii contractors Hawaii Harbors Constructors JV, Nan Inc. and Kiewit Infrastructure West Co.; Manson Construction Co. of Seattle; and Nova Group Inc. and The Dutra Group, both of California.\n\nTwo other Navy contracts granted in June are worth nearly $120 million. One, worth $98,000,000, went to a disabled-veteran owned, small-business, multiple-award construction contract for work at various locations throughout the state. The contractors for this project include: Hawk Niking LLC of Wahiawa; SSQ-API LLP JV of Waialua; Tokunaga Elite JV LLC of Pearl City; AN41-AAK JV LLC of Visalia, California; and Warfeather GM JJC LLC of Oklahoma. The third Navy contract went to Nan Inc. for $20,924,900 to replace the Working Dog Treatment Facility at Joint Base Pearl Harbor Hickam.\n\nA total of 10 government agencies awarded 57 contracts in May 2022, bringing the month’s tally to $261,607,572.\n\nIt was a 232 percent increase from the $78,736,942 awarded in May 2021.\n\nUniversity of Hawaii awarded the bulk of jobs in May totaling $108,970,551, followed by the Navy at $97,257,700.\n\nThe island of Oahu received 88 percent of the contracts, valued at $230,910,730.\n\nSwinerton Builders landed the single-largest award of $56,145,000 for renovations at Sinclair Library at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. The next-largest award, valued at $50,000,000 from NAVFAC Pacific, went to InSynergy/Robert JV LLC for architecture and engineering services in the agency’s area of operations, including Hawaii.\n\nOn the Big Island, the largest\n\ncontract, $10,715,000, went to Isemoto Contracting Co. Ltd. for the expansion and improvement of Waiakea Ula Park in Hilo. On Maui, Pacific Commercial Services LLC landed the largest job valued at $1,609,750 to furnish environmental response services for state highways."
