        "text": "Longtime musician and on-air Maui radio personality, Shane Kaonohiokalā Kahalehau, was recognized by the Hawaiʻi Academy of Recording Arts with the 2024 Nā Hōkū Hanohano award for Most Promising Artist of the Year.\n\nKahalehau described the recognition as a “full circle” moment for his career, which spans 30 years. Over the years, he has been a member of successful island groups that include the Hawaiian Rhythm Band, Island Heat and Sly Dog.\n\n“I started as a young child playing ʻukulele and singing Hawaiian music and though reggae music has been my forte, Hawaiian music will forever be the music of my heart,” he said.\n\nKahalehau began his career in radio at Pacific Media Group in 1994 where he is known as the “Hawaiian Home Boy” to his on-air audience. He is both the Program Director of KPOA 93.5 FM and the host of the stationʻs “Aloha Morning Show” from 6 to 10 a.m.\n\nKahalehau, who grew up on Hawaiian Homelands in Paukūkalo, was given his HHB moniker from his mentor and fellow KPOA radio personality, the late Henry “Boy” Kanaʻe, also known as “The Hawaiian Supaman.”\n\n“I am so proud, to say the least. I know how genuine Shane is,” said Sherri Grimes, Vice President and General manager of Maui Radio Operations at Pacific Media Group. “Shane’s authenticity comes across every morning on KPOA, and that same connection is made through his music. One of many things I appreciate working with Shane is he always keeps it real,” said Grimes.\n\nIn addition to his win as the Most Promising Artist of the Year, Kahalehau also garnered a nomination in the category for 2024 EP Release of the Year. That award went to “In Your Hawaiian Way” by the late Bruddah Waltah Aipolani, who Kahalehau paid tribute to during the ceremony in a medley performance alongside Sean Naʻauao and Manaʻo Company.\n\nKahalehau was recognized for his work on Kaonohiokalā, an album produced by fellow Maui musicians Kason Gomes and Kalani Miles of Mea Nui Records. The album features favorites like “‘Īnikiniki Mālie” and “Kaulana Nā Pua.” It also has original compositions: “Do Right,” and “Tight Rope.” It ends fittingly with “Isaiah 40:31,” a promise of renewed strength for the weary.\n\n“I’m so humbled to be in the presence of all of our music makers of Hawaiʻi. It’s no doubt that I wouldn’t be here this evening if not for my King and Savior Jesus Christ,” he said in accepting the award on Saturday at the Hawaiʻi Convention Center.\n\nKahalehau’s son, Nuʻu continues the family’s music legacy, and is now a minister in Praise and Worship at King’s Cathedral.\n\nWhile this was Kahalehau’s first Nā Hōkū win, it is the third time he has been nominated by the Hawaiʻi Academy of Recording Arts.\n\nA full list of winners and Maui highlights are posted here.\n\nMaui Now’s / Pacific Media Group’s Wendy Osher contributed to this report."
