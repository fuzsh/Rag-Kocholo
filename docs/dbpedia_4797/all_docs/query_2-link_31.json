        "text": "Since six-year-old Libby Barker wrote the first two lines about her thoughts on peace in Lahaina in the Hawaiian Islands in June 1996, the International Peace Poem has grown to more than 200,000 lines from people in more than 90 countries including Willie Nelson, Arlo Guthrie, Miss America, and Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Billy Collins.\n\nThe International Peace Poem reaches into the classrooms, where students spend study time focusing on the importance of peace and nonviolence in their lives and others and looking at Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as a role model for achieving change through nonviolent methods. One of his role models was Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nWe were invited to the United Nations to participate in Peace Millennium Day in 2000 to share our work promoting peace in education. For the past 24 years, we have focused on encouraging the writing of poetry and peace in the classrooms and honoring the legacy of civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Tens of thousands of students in Hawaii and elsewhere have sent peace poems to us. We hold Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Peace Poetry Awards ceremonies yearly on Oahu, Maui, Kauai, and the Big Island.\n\nSucceeding governors and mayors provide certificates to winners, and for a couple of years, while the nation was in lockdown due to the Covid virus, Hawaii’s First Lady Dawn Ige delivered the opening speech via video, and students from the four island counties were recognized on video with winners having the opportunity to recite their poems. 2023 marked our return to regular physical venues with gatherings on several islands. \"To view videos of virtual award ceremonies, click here. \"Here.\"\n\nSeveral sponsors and artists each year donate posters, paintings, hand-made jewelry, and ‘ukuleles to top winners. Hundreds of parents gather in each county to celebrate their child’s achievements.\n\nWe hope to expand our educational program in the near future to form chapters in other parts of the United States and are looking for teachers in other states to send their poems along with a photograph of their students to us. We have a couple of lesson plans that teachers may use in their classrooms. We believe there is a growing need to create a peaceful atmosphere of respect and creativity in our schools and our society. Writing about peace and nonviolence is a step in the right direction. Click on the Globe at your top left to view Peace Poems sent to us by students from more than 90 countries.\n\n\"You can use this form by going to the Globe, click on Add Your Own Lines, and send us your Peace Poem.\"\n\nAs an individual or part of a classroom. It may be sent in the language of your country and hopefully, with an English translation. Please type your name, city, and country!\n\nMany thanks to the scores of volunteers who help at the awards ceremonies each year in the Hawaiian Islands and the businesses and artists who donate prizes. One of the major contributors has been the Polynesian Voyaging Society and Oiwi TV, with their wonderful photographs of the double-hulled sailing canoe Hokule’a as it sails on goodwill missions worldwide. Photographs of the Hokule’a as well as other wonderful photographs have been put on limited edition posters and given as prizes to finalists attending our annual ceremonies.\n\n\"Mahalo\" Melinda Gohn \"Peace Poem Director\""
