In the am- ateur radio field, this group Is the National Industry Advi- sory Committee* Amateur Radio Service Subcommittee (Ml AC), The group has 17 members, of whom about two-thirds normal- ly attend the yearly or twice- yearly meetings. The most recent meeting was held at the FCC headquarters in Washington with eleven mem- bers present. More of the mem- bers are interested and influen- tial amateurs than industry rep- resentatives, with the only true industry representatives being me from 73, John Lindhofm from QST, Chris Imlay from QSTt and Alan Dorhoffer from CQ.

We had been asked for a report on high-speed transmis- sions for emergency communi- cations and on the possibilities of developing more amateurs for emergency operations. I made the following report, which you may find of interest. Amateur Radio Emergency Commu n i ca t i ons; The Future? AE the 1351 NIAC meeting I dis- cussed the matter of the lagging American technology in electronics. Since thai time this has been a mat- ter of continued interest in the gener al media, with articles in The Wati Street Journal and several other well* read publications. It was my concept that much of the explanation for this increasing tech- nology gap lies in the moribund na- ture of amateur radio in our coun- try. . .particularly as compared with the vital and growing interest in ama- teur radio in Japan. I felt that this stemmed from the proposed \"incen- tive licensing\" rules of 1963. at which time amateur radio in the US stopped its growth for an eleven year period. Indeed, had our ranks contin- ued to grow at the rate a! which they had been expanding from World War II until that time, we would have reached our present amateur popula* tjon in about If The result of this has been a seri- ous lack of the most precious life- blood of amateur radio, the 14- and 15-year-old newcomers. Even the spurt of interest in the mid-1970s which resulted from the national enthusiasm for Citizens Band ra- dio brought In more middle-aged re- cruits than youngsters. Unfortunate- ly, these are not the type of amateurs who decide to dedicate their lives to careers in electronics or commun i cations. Thus we have a rapidly aging group of amateurs, with the large part of them well beyond the age when we would expect them to contribute to the advance of American technology. This largely comes from people in their 20s and 30s. not in their 40s and 50s. One possible solution to the prob- lem would be to encourage the intro- duction of amateur radio into as many high schools as possible. This Is the age recruit which we need, . . which our country needs. Without this group Joining our hobby I feel that America can only face further humiliation at the hands of the Japa- nese engineers and technicans. Fur- Iher, should any international con- flict develop, we will have to be very sure that the next time we have Ja- pan on our side. Indeed, if Japan had introduced the no-code ham license in the 1930s it is possible that the war couid have turned out differently. We should remember that Hitler publicly regretted his stopping of amateur radio In Germany and ascribed much of the failure of Germany in the war to the resultant loss of technicians Since we all agree that another in- ternational war is unthinkable and impossible, there is no real reason to even worry about our technical peo- ple who might be needed in that in- stance. Still, that does leave us with a gradual falling behind in business as the Japanese, with their army of engi- neers and technicians, surpass us in calculators, watches, television sets, video recorders, video players and disks, tape recorders, hi-fi systems, amateur radio equipment, all com- munications equipment, telephones, test equipment. . and so on. it seems to me that the further we allow ourselves to fall behind in technology, the more we will fall behind economically. I have visited I us I about every part of the world in recent months and on every front I find the Japanese firms getting ahead of us, Despite the serious problems our Administration is hav- ing In trying to cut down on ex- penses, it may be lime for a White House symposium on this critical sit- uation, with some dramatic mea- sures to tackle the problem. There have been two major techno- logical revolutions In the amateur radio field In the last twenty years. The first was the introduction of single sideband transmissions in the late 50s. which resulted in a change to that mode for virtually all phone shortwave communications on the amateur bands. . . and its use by the military. The second major lechnol* ogy change was the development of the FM transceiver and repeater which came along in the late 60s and developed through the 70s. Smce then, despite great leaps ahead in digital and integrated circuit technol- ogy by industry, little change can be seen in our ham bands. The groups of amateurs working for 73 Magazine are hard at work on a new technology, This will be intra* duced on twenty meters, probably on H,100 kHz, as an on-the-air bulletin board. It is our plan to have a radio transceiver system which will auto- mat I caMy answer queries from other stations on that frequency, sending at first a menu of the available mate- rial on the bulletin board. As an example of how this would work, a station would send a call for W2NSD/1 and sign its call. W2NSD/1 would then respond with a list of op- tions of information. Let's say the in- quiring station opts for #1, a current DX advisory.

Al the end of the transmission Ihe inquiring sta- tion would have an option of sending unlisted information for possible in- clusion on the bulletin board. This would be received at W2NSDH and stored for editing by the operator, it then could be added to the #1 list of information. Number I wo might be a list of con- tests during the next few weeks, with scoring information, where 10 send logs, where to get full details, and so on. Again, further information could be sent to W2NSD/1 at the end of the bulletin transmission. Plans are to have lists of bam- tests and conventions, the latest FCC releases, proposed rule changes, lists of nets and their fre- quencies, changes in repeater calls or channels, VHF information, RTTY Information, SSTV information r . . and so on . En addition to encouraging the use of advanced digital techniques over the air, these transmissions would be experimental in nature, helping ama- teurs develop systems capable of communications via ASCfl at 300- . 1200-. and 9600-baud speeds. The re- sponse of W2NSD/1 would be set to match the calling speed of bulletin board users. 9600 baud can be sent within the confines of an amateur voice channel and, when you con* sider that this is approximately 8500 words per minute, it is an efficient means of exchanging information. Let's carry this on to the next step. How does this have anything to do with emergency communications, the basic function of NlAC? Most of the emergency nets of today are on voice and are incredibly inefficient as far as handling volumes of traffic Is concerned. Let's look into the future and see where our high-speed auto- malic digital communications exper- iment is taking us. In a few years we may be using small keyboards on which we will be able to type messages. Indeed, these are already on the market, with the Radio Shack TRS-B0 pocket comput- er selling for $230. Let's Imagine that instead of just calling a net control station to send a message, the net calls each station in the net in turn and asks if there Is any traffic. With digital calling, this polling of a net could be done in milliseconds, not minutes with endless repeating of callsigns. At 3500 words per minute, the net control could call each partic- ipating station and ask for traffic in less than a second. If a message has been typed on the pocket computer, the station would automatically dump it over the air when polled. The control station computer would read ihe address and pass the message along to the addressee instantly. Wilh a network like this it would be possible to handle thousands of times as much traffic as at present with no tosses or errors. Further, links with low-band long-range sta- tions could be set up as part of the emergency network . ... even to link- ing through satellites via microwave transmissions. This is not a gee-whiz dream of Ihe future Everything needed has al- ready been invented, so ail amateurs have to do is apply the technology we already have developed in the com- puter field to radio communications. This should be good for amateur ra- dio in that it will generate a new inter- est in communicating via this new technology. It will be good for Indus- try In that ali amateurs will be want- ing new equipment. And It will enable amateurs to provide an emergency communications system far beyond anything imagined a year or so ago. We are taking the first step with W2NSD/1 in the establishment of Ihe radio bulletin board. We will be ask- ing the FCC for permission to experi- ment with 1200- and 9600-baud trans- missions.

I was hiking alone in these frigid mountains, my only link to the outside world a compact package of imported electronics 12 73 Magazine • December, powered by a pitifully small battery pack. I intended to use my Kenwood 2400 HI to access a two-meter repeater located on a mountaintop eight mites jway. In case of trouble, the HT would be my only way of yelling \"Mayday.\" Suddenly I was aware of the sounds hanging in the ho/en evening air: the roar of my small stove and the sweep of the wind-driven snow. Something was miss ing. The HT had been quiet for a long time. The reassur- ing CW ID of the Mount Washington repeater had not broken the squelch fur at least half an hour. Preo< cupied with stamping out a firm platform in the deep powder snow, setting up my mountain tent, getting the stove going, and making leady for the long night ahead, I had not noticed the HT's silence Now that si lence was overwhelming With clumsy, mittened hands I groped through my pack tor the HT I wiped the (frost from the LCD readout and was relieved to see it indicating 6.055 — the wrong frequency. I had inadvertently depressed the RLV button while setting the frequency to 6,655 earlier and was listening on the repeater's input fre- quency instead of its out- put frequency, When I restored the switch to the normal position, I caught the tail end of the cheerful CW ID of KIOIQ/R, The repeater was still working and so was my HT I went back to melting snow and supper preparations as the winter darkness slowly tilled my campsite. This trip had come about as a combination of my in- terests in winter mountain- eering and amateur radio, Andr by bringing tin HT along. I was able to justify doing something I normally could not justify — making the trip alone With the HT, I would always be able to reach the outside world and, in the event of trouble, would be able to let some- one know where I was I also thought it would be fun to yack with my fellow hams as I trekked through the Presidential Range in deep winter The Presidential Range lies in the White Mountains of northern New Hamp- shire. This wilderness area provides the most challeng- ing winter hiking and climb- ing in New England The re- gion is known for its foul weather and, before the anemometer blew away, the highest wind gust ever recorded on the surface of the planet was clocked at an incredible 231 mph on Mt Washington's summit At 6,288 feet, Washington is no giant among mountains Its reputation as a cruel place in winter, however, is first-hand knowledge to all eastern hikers and climbers who have spent time scut- tling across its windswept slopes or scaling the walls of its icy ravines. 1981 My plan was to hike into the national forest south of Mt Washington place a high camp at tree line on the Presidential Ridgef spend the night, and then hike down the ridge the fol- lowing day, I hoped to pass over the summit of Mt, Washington before heading for civilization at Pinkham Notch Camp I intended to cover a total of thirteen miles in two days, gaming most of my altitude the first day on the four-mile ap- proach up the ridge. Weather, of course, would play a major role in the success of any plan. The winter of 1980/81 was unus- ually cold in New England and the weekend I chose for my trip was no excep- tion I was well aware of the consequences that had be- fallen those foolhardy enough to be caught high on that exposed ridge in severe winter conditions. Wind-chill factors in excess of — 1 00 degrees were com- mon and, if the weather and winds did not cooperate, my plans would have to change. I had no success per- suading any of my friends to go with me, Perhaps the ominous weather forecasts which predicted snow on Friday night and Saturday with gradual clearing and plunging temperatures on Sunday dissuaded them. In any case, as I hiked along Saturday morning under my fully-loaded, forty-pound Kelty pack, I was glad to be alone, Working my way up through the forest, the only sounds intruding on my solitude were the rhythmic swish of my snowshoes through the powder and the occasional ID of the Mt Washington repeater. The Mount Washington repeater has the widest coverage of any machine in New England, Situated six thousand feet above sea level, it provides reliable communications over a 300-mile, five-state area Though it shares its moun- A Sunday morning self-portrait at fifteen below zero. taintop with TV, FM broad- cast, and commercial mi- crowave installations, it has few intermodulation or desense problems. The machine is privately owned and is open to the public, The only contribu- tion requested from the large number of daily users is good operating practice. The machine is supported by equipment donations from hams in the north country, and maintenance and repairs are carried out by its licensee, A I Ox ton K101Q and by Bill \"Mac\" Beal W1PNR. The central role Ox ton and Beal play in the machine upkeep and maintenance is the key to its reliability in the harsh mountain environment. Luckily for the users, both Al and Mac spend con- siderable amounts of time on the summit of ML Wash- ington in the course of their duties as staff members of the Mount Washington Ob- servatory. The Observatory, a non-profit research facili- ty which operates year- round, is rich in folklore and ethereal nocturnal visitors. Rumor has it that at least one ghost is in residence on the summit, on wild nights when the wind is whining, he gives certain Obser- vatory staffers the pleasure of his company, Oxton and Beal are more concerned with repeaters than rumors, however. Their repeater is a VHF Engineering kit. A scratch- built control system pro- vides tone decoders and in- terface for the autopatch, audio processing, link to another machine seventy miles away in Concord NH, and auxiliary inputs Duplexers are by Sinclair and were provided by the Northeast FM Repeater As- sociation The special Gam half-wave vertical antenna, enclosed in a fiberglass radome, is fed with heliax cable cast off by the neigh- boring TV station. Transmit- ter output is 18 Watts, 20 Watts ERP The repeater is voice-accessed and the trustees encourage users to say nice things when bring- ing the machine up. The dentist's office \"Ahhhhhh\" is frowned upon. Normal repeater power is drawn from ac mains, but the ma- chine is capable of running on solar power and has even been run on wind power. 73 That night there was no shortage of wind for power generation on Mt. Wash- ington. Though it bullied my tent, I was comfortable within the narrow confines of my mummy sleeping bag. Drawn tightly down across my face and around my shoulders, the bag pro- vided a life-sustaining en- vironment. The tempera- ture within the bag was a humid seventy degrees Four inches away, outside the bag's nylon and fiberfill walls, the temperature was flirting with the bag's minimum comfort rating. fifteen degrees below zero I had placed two full-length closed-cell foam pads be- neath me which provided 1-1/4 inches of insulation from the chilling, hard- packed surface of the snow While I stayed on the pads, I stayed warm In addition to my b'2\" frame, I had managed to stuff a quart of water, the inner liners of my hiking boots, assorted articles of clothing, a bag of GORP (good old raisins and pea- nuts), my HT, a spare nicad pack, and a headlamp into the bag with me. These carefully chosen items Magazine * December. 1981 13 were the only things that would not be frozen solid in the morning and, as long as 1 didn't roll over too often, I was totally content, I had been dozing in the bag for about two hours when the Granite State FM Net was called to order. This public service net handles national and regional traffic in two separate sessions and nor- mally convenes at 7:00 pm on the repeater in Concord NH Once the net is under- way, the Concord and Mt. Washington repeaters are linked, providing coverage of the entire state. For some reason, however, the link was not functioning and, while I could hear the net proceedings from Concord on my HT, I was not able to check in. I wanted to pass a piece of routine traffic to a friend and fellow ham in Bo/eman MT who had been a frequent companion on many previous winter trips Without the link, however, it was doubtful that I would be able to get my traffic through. Shortly after the net began, net control, N1 ALM, briefly left the Concord ma- chine and appeared on the Mt, Washington repeater asking if anyone had out- going traffic for the net As I gratefully passed the text of my message to htm, we both had to laugh about the propensity we hams have for establishing and main- taining communications between weird locations. Like coral reefs, maximum security prisons, desert ghost towns, or mountain- side campsites. Dana's check number matched mine on the first count and while I languished in my sleeping bag, my message began its relay to Montana. Outside, the weather was deteriorating. The constant swish of built-up snow sliding off my tent and the increasing staccato of the wind did not bode well for the next day's planned route. The exposed ridge, lashed by the northwest wind, would be drifted with new snow making travel la- borious and time-consum- ing. I lay mulling over my plans and reminded myself that tht1 trip was supposed to be fun. I was almost asleep when the squelch was broken by my own callsign The gang at W2NSD/1r 100 miles south in Peterborough, was trying to raise me. We had agreed to keep an 8:00 pm sked Saturday evening and at 7:45 pm they were anx- iously calling. Most of my fellow staffers were sure I was mad for making the trip in the first place and it was a skeptical and curious group that gathered at the 73 ham shack to hear of my progress. After assuring them that I was not in a bar somewhere within range of the repeat- The winter landscape — more fit for a hobbit than a man. 14 73 Magazine • December, 1981 er, I filled them in on what I had been doing since leav- ing Peterborough As we spoke to one another across the intervening miles, I imagined their world as it was at that moment: a warm, well-lit, fully- equipped ham shack crowded with friends enjoy- ing themselves. It was very different from the cold, dark world I was in. For a moment, I envied their comfort and camaraderie. AC1Z was on frequency when I concluded my sked. Willy, an employee of the TV station on the summit of Mt. Washington, volun- teered to go next door to the Observatory and get the latest weather forecast for me. It was not good. The forecast called for bitter cold, widely-scattered snow squalls for the next twenty four-hours, and winds gust- ing to 100 mph. At that mo- ment, it was minus twenty degrees on the summit and winds were gusting to b0 mph. I thanked him, ad- mired his mettle, and then shut down the rig and fell asleep. Sleep was fragmented and Sundays dawn came slowly The orange walls of my tent gradually picked up color as the sun rose behind an icy scrim of fog and blowing snow I lay awake for a long time in my sleeping bag trying to psych myself up for the inevi- table. The hardest part of any winter camping day is leaving a warm sleeping bag and getting into cold clothes, frozen boots, and an icy world Despite being in my fourteenth hour in my bag, it was easier to lay there pondering the best (and quickest] scenario to follow in getting dressed than to actually get out of the bag and dress, I snapped on the HT and passed time listening to the idle chatter of other early risers on this frigid New Hampshire Sunday morn- ing. Occasionally, a clipped New England accent would comment on everyone's favorite topic, the weather. \"Ayup Marshall, a might cold here this mahnin. About twenty-five below. Acourse that's on the windy side of the bahn.\" As my fellow hams had their second and third cups of coffee, I struggled to get my stove going. Repeated priming finally heated the generator up enough to sus- tain combustion and soon I too was contemplating the morning's cold over a hot cup of Java, It has snowed heavily during the night and the stubby, frozen shapes here at tree-line were a more ap- propriate landscape for a hobbit than a ham. The wind-driven snow had sculpted grotesque and beautiful figures during the night as it packed into the scrub growth and pucker brush and fresh drifts covered even the deepest of yesterday's tracks. Once I was out of my bag, the morning cold kept me moving Standing in one place for any period of time invited the relentless ad- vance of the cold up through my boots and into my body. To keep warm, I busied myself with break ing camp — a reluctant sleeping bag was forced in to its small stuff sack, dirty pots left to freeze were chipped clean of breakfast remnants, and my tent was folded and forced into my pack. The weather was as fore- cast Clouds and blowing snow swirled around me as I wrestled my pack onto my back. As soon as I had it on, the HT I had carefully zipped into a side pocket came alive N1AHN, a friend I had spoken with the previous day, was calling to check on my progress. John was ten miles away in the village of North Conway After a short chat with him, I moved off into the storm feeling good that a local was around and interested. Conditions deteriorated with each foot of altitude I gained. By the time I was above the last of the scrub, it became obvious to me that I would not be able to continue the traverse, The poor visibility meant that I would be walking compass azimuths on that wild ridge and, should I have to back* track, would be walking directly into the full force of the wind. Frostbite was a definite possibility and as I stood with my back to the gale, peering down the ridge, I had to remove my met a I frame eyeglasses because they were drawing heat out of my skin so rap- idly that my cheeks and temples were losing sensa- tion. My windpants and anorak hood drummed wildly in the wind, and through the tunnel vision of my wool balaclava, I saw a landscape no sane person would inhabit I couldn't resist moving a short distance down the ridge and breaking out the HT for a quick test, how- ever I lifted six distant repeaters from my high point and, as each one came up, 1 announced that KA1 D/portable, Presiden- tial Ridge NH, was listening. Thankfully, no one took the opportunity to chat, and I rapidly retreated toward the relative security below tree line. While breaking my way down the trail, I managed to raise a friend and let him know of my change in plans. Ken W1NFE was lo- cated in Bretton Woods, a small hamlet at the foot of the mountains. We agreed that I would let him know when I was safely back at the trail head I skied, slid, and slipped the four miles off that ridge thinking of hot showers, hot food, and cold beer. In a few hours, I was down. The temperature at the trail head was minus four- teen, but it was warm when compared with the cold I'd felt up on the ridge, I flopped my Kelty on the * mi «- i « am Swirling clouds and wind-driven snow on the Presidential Ridge. snow and began fumbling through its labyrinthine pockets for my car keys. As I listened for what I thought would be the final time to the ID of the Mt. Washing- ton repeater, it occurred to me that my Kenwood 2400 HT was one of the more reliable companions I have had the pleasure of hiking with It didn't freeze up and performed well under less than ideal conditions. Unfortunately, I was not out of the woods once my hike was over. I twisted the key in the ignition and after a few lethargic turnovers, the engine fired to life. I smugly congratulated my- self for the care I had taken in tune-up and battery maintenance while I habit* ually glanced at the oil pressure gauge. My smug- ness disappeared when I saw U resting on zero I anx- iously let the engine idle for ten seconds, twenty sec- onds, a long minute. The gauge never moved. Worse still, the tappets were grow- ing gradually noisier. Ap- parently, my adventure was just beginning. I shut the engine down and sat in the cab with a sick feeling growing in the pit of my stomach. As I went through the mental gymnastics of what could be wrong, the inside of the windows began to frost up, enclosing me in an icy, translucent cave I ruminated on the situa- tion for several minutes when that most noble of human traits, blind opti- mism, took hold. I simply said to myself, \"This can't be happening. I'll just start this thing up and all will be well/' So, I did and it wasn't The oil pressure re- mained zero while the en- gine clattered away alarm- ingly, I admitted to myself that I had a problem. Sitting in the sub-zero in- terior of a disabled vehicle thirty miles from the near- est garage with night com- ing on gets old quickly. The images of hot showers and hot food I had conjured up hours earlier on the trail were still fresh in my mind and I resolved to somehow escape the developing de- bade, Then it dawned on me: For the first time in nearly twenty years of ham- ming, I had — if not an emer- gency—at least a large bummer on my hands which could be minimized by ham radio I reached for the mobile rig, but before I could turn it on it occurred to me that I should be using the HT instead. This was the kind of situation I had brought it along for in the first place and it seemed fit- ting to use it to extricate myself now. My first call was to W1NFE. Ken was the clos- est and he answered almost immediately After I gave him a brief description of my problem, he took the situation in hand. A tow truck was reluctantly dis- patched—no small accom- plishment on a country Sun- day afternoon. The cheap- est motel in town was alerted to expect an unex- pected guest and a few res- taurant recommendations soon followed, too To say that the village of Twin Mountain was desert- ed when the tow truck pulled me in is an under- statement of considerable proportion. Besides the garage man and me, only a few scroungy dogs roamed the windswept streets. Noth- ing could be done for the van that nightr so I hoofed off toward the motel that Ken had suggested. One other guest was in residence, he too a victim of car trou- ble. After we commiserated briefly, I made a few phone calls to find all the area restaurants closed I then went upstairs to settle into the stillness of my room, lit- tering it with layers of damp clothes and thawing wool knee socks while I munched on the remnants of my trail lunch. Then I headed for the shower Sitting on the edge of the bed afterwards, flushed with the warmth of a very long shower, I resigned my- self to an early and un- eventful evening. I lavishly kicked the room's thermo- stat up another notch and stretched out on the bed waiting for something tolerable to appear on the only channel the rabbit- eared TV would receive. To my amazement, the phone rang. W1NFE had tracked me down and was calling to in- vite me to share dinner and spend the evening with him and his family At that mo- ment, the world suddenly looked brighter Ken soon arrived and we headed out to dinner in the twenty-be- low night listening to the familiar voices on the Mt. Washington repeater.! 73 Magazine • December, 1981 15 The FT-ONE is the culmination of an all-out design project by Yaesus top engineering team. Working without the usual cost constraints, Yaesu's design group is proud to unveil the instrument they \"always wanted to design,\" a revolutionary blend of computer and RF technology. GENERAL COVERAGE, ALL SOLID STATE The FT-ONE is a full-coverage all-mode transceiver, equipped for reception on any frequency between 150 kHz and 29.99 MHz, with transmit coverage on all nine present and proposed amateur bands In countries where permitted, ttie FT-ONE may be programmed to trans- mit throughout the 1. 8-29. 99 MHz range. KEYBOARD FREQUENCY ENTRY Fully digitally synthesized, the FT-ONE uses a front panel keyboard for initial frequency entry, Frequency change is then accomplished via the main tuning dial or the pushbutton scanner, with tuning in either 1 0 Hz or 100 Hz steps possible. Truly the eontesters dream, the FT-ONE permits extremely fine tuning and instantaneous band change with equal facility. DUAL VFO SYSTEM Ten digital VFO's with memory are provided, in conjunction with an A-B selection scheme that allows instant recall ot any transmit, receive, or transceive frequency desired For split-frequency operation, such as on 7 MHz SSB, the operator may select TX on VFG-A and RX on VFO-B, automatically storing the calling and listening frequencies for each pile-up. For net operations, a non- volatile memory board is available as an option, to eliminate the possibility ot dumping memory, FULL CW BREAK-IN Recent advances in solid-state technology have finally made full CW break-in r^jable enough to be incorporated into a Yaesu product. Now you can select traditional semi-break-in (for use with amplifiers not equipped for full break-in) or full high-speed break-in. When using amplifiers so equipped, ttie keyer output lead may be interrupted vraa rear panel jack and routed to the break- m sequencing input on your amplifier. SWITCHING REGULATOR POWER SUPPLY Extremely compact and light in weight, the switching regulator power supply reduces substantially the space required to produce the operating voltages used in the FT-ONE, Highly efficient and uniquely Stable, the switching regulator supply provides superb reliability in a field of design long neglected by amateur manufacturers. ELITE CLASS PERFORMANCE FEATURES In addition to the full break-in and superb receiver filters, Yaesu's design team packed the FT-ONE with subtle virtues that others might have overlooked. Rear panel jacks allow the use of both an external receiver and an independent receive antenna, such as a 160 meter Beverage. While scanning, automatic halting on a received signal may be programmed, . perfect for watching a band for openings. If you're a DX-peditioner, an optional Curtis 8044 keyer board is available, so you won't need an external keyer thai only wastes suitcase space And if your amplifier fan is louder man it should be. there's even a micro- phone squelch (AMGC) to reduce background noise pickup between words and sentences1 ONE YEAR FACTORY WARRANTY Because of the level of attention to design detail, parts selection, and factory quality control, your FT-ONE is backed by a one-year factory warranty for the original purchaser at retail. Prompt and meticulous attention to your warranty needs will be provided by our Ohio And California Service Centers, in addition, ail units sold in the United Stales will be inspected and tested after clearing Customs, and will include a Service Manual in the puchase price. GAIN/INTERCEPT OPTIMIZED RECEIVER FRONT END Utilizing up-conversion with a first IF ot 73 MHz, the FT-ONE RF amplifier stage uses push-pull power transistors configured to pro- duce a typical output intercept of +40 dBm. The first mixer utilizes a diode ring module followed by a low noise post amp, for optimum noise figure consistent with modern day intercept requirements The result is a receiver with a typical two-tone dynamic range well in excess of 95 dB {14 MHz, CW bandwidth). Additional gam tailoring is provided via a PIN diode attenuator controlled from (he front panef. FILTERS READY FOR COMPETITION Three filler bandwidths are available for CW operation (two for FSK!}, using optional 600 Hz or 300 Hz crystal fitters. Filter insertion losses are equalized for constant If gain. Both IF Shift and Variable Band- width are provided, and two CW filters may be cascaded, for competition-grade selectivity. For SS8 work, the Variable Bandwidth feature eliminates the need for costly 1 .5 kHz or 1 .8 kHz filters, as any intermediate bandwidth may easily be programmed using the standard, cascaded SSB filters To top it all off. a high-performance audio peak and notch filter is standard equipment. EXPANDED OPERATING DISPLAYS Digital displays for the VFO Frequency, memory channel, and RIT offset are provided for quick frequency identification. The large front panel meter provides easy viewing of transceiver operating para- meters, including final transistor collector current, input DC voltage, FM discriminator center tuning, speech processor compression level, and forward/reflected relative power. NOT AVAILABLE AS OPTIONS Its hard to believe that other manufacturers still insist on making such essential items as a noise blanker or speech processor extra-cost options . We find that these are less expensive to incorporate and more reliable in operation when installed on our assembly line No AC power supply is available as an option for the FT-ONE . either, it's equipped for operatron from 100/1 10/1 17/200/220/234 volts AC. or 13.5 volts DC And it goes without saying that there will not be an external VFO offered for the FT-ONE — were confident tftat ten VFO's are quite enough ! Experience the FT-ONE in your Authorized Yaesu Dealer's showroom today. This may be the last Amateur transceiver you will ever own. +m Warranty policy available upon request. SASEt please.

Whether you use the ubiquitous Hustler system, the Rex Bassett an- tennas, or motorized won- ders like Cubic's, you need something to mount it on that will support the consid- erable load the antenna presents while motoring down the highway. The mounts offered by the man- ufacturers are rarely confi- dence-inspiring. Mechani- cal integrity and protection of the coax connection are the primary areas that need attention. The TLM-2 mount from Rex Bassett solves the prob- lems in both areas, as long as your antenna fits a stan- dard 3/8-24 mount. Best of all, it doesn't require a band around the bumper (which won't fit many small cars). The mount resembles an in* verted teacup, with a thick gray finish applied All hardware exposed to the elements is stainless steel- On the bottom of the mount is a threaded SO-239 connector. A single hole is drilled through the bumper or rear deck, and the mount is screwed down with hefty hardware and a thick rub- ber washer. Once installed, this mount isn't going any- where—it's rock solid! The SO-239 connector on the other side of the mounting surface is also an important advance. If you mount the antenna on the rear deck of your car, problems with water-logged coax are a thing of the past. Installed on the bumper, the coax will need some sort of pro- tection from the elements, I have used Coax-Seal (avail- able at most dealers) with great success. Rex Bassett's antenna products have acquired a reputation for intelligent design and rugged durabil- ity. The TLM-2 mount con- tinues that tradition.

The author sug- gests several options, and the design readily accom- modates others. One such option, to make typing easi- er, is described in this arti- cle, I found the basic key- board awkward to operate because of the key-interlock feature which disables all other keys while one is de- pressed. Although other keys may be struck, nothing will come out— and that was my problem: striking the next key too soon resulted in omitted characters. The answer is n-key roll- over. With n-key rollover, second, third, etc., keys may be struck while the first and/or succeeding keys are still held down, yet code will go out in perfect sequence {the capability exceeds the demand). The technique used by Horowitz W1HFA for his Compucoder {QSTf June, 1975), two resistors and one capacitor in each keyswitch lead, was adapted for this modification, as shown in Fig. 1, Essentially, the func- tional difference between the original WB9WRE diode matrix and the modified one is the duration of the key- switch input. The static, or rest, condition of data buses K0-K7 and the strobe input is high in both cases* When a key is struck, diodes in the key-switch line take selected data buses low to form the 8-bit binary code represent- ing the character keyed. One or more of the low data buses take the strobe input The right design — for all the right reasons. In setting forth design pa- rameters for ARGOSY, Ten-Tec engi- neers pursued the goal of giving amateurs a rig with the right features at a price that stops the amateur radio price spiral. The result is a unique new trans- ceiver with selectable power levels (convertible from 10 watts to 100 watts at the flick of a switch), a rig with the right bands (80 through 10 meters including the new 30 meter band), a rig with the right operational features plus the right options, and the right price for today's economy— just $549. Low power or high power, ARGOSY has it Now you can enjoy the sport and challenge of QRPp operating, and. when you need it* the power to stand up to the crowds in QRM and poor band conditions. Just flip a switch to move from true QRPp power with the correct bias voltages to a full 100 watt input. New analog readout design. Fast, easy, reliable, and efficient. The modern new readout on the ARGOSY is a mechanical de- sign that in- stantly gives you all significant figures of any frequency. Right down to five figures (± 2 kHz). The band switch indicates the first two figures (MHz), the linear scale with lighted red bar- pointer indicates the third figure (hundreds) and the tuning knob skirt gives you the fourth and fifth figures (tens and units). Easy. And effi- cient—so battery operation is easily achieved. The right receiver features.

In the original version, the key- switch provides a direct ground which retains the 8-bit code on the data buses and holds the strobe input low, preventing reset until the key is released. Con- versely, there is no direct ground path in the modified version. The keyswitch dis- charges the capacitor, send- ing a negative-going pulse to form the 8-bit code and trig- ger the strobe. When the negative-going pulse is com- plete, the data buses and the strobe input revert to the static (high) state and are ready for the next keystroke. The depressed key is inert until released; after release, the capacitor recharges and the key may be used again (there is no discernible de- lay). Foolproof key debounc- ing is a bonus feature of this modification. The keyswitch panels I used were removed from old computer termi- nals that had individual magnetic reed-switch mod- ules mounted on rails. Some of the switches, outwardly identical to all others but used for special or dual functions, caused sporadic character iterations. I tried numerous strobe pulse widths, and even a 555 wired as a one-shot, without result. A partial cure, effec- tive for some but not for all of the aberrant keys, was fi- nally achieved using capaci- tor conditioning on the strobe-input line. These key- ing anomalies completely disappeared after the key- board was modified. With due respect to WB9WRE, it's a matter of opinion whether his— or any other— keyboard makes CW music; some would say that on ly a bug i n the hands of an expert can do that! Music or not, this keyboard will play a better tune after this simple modification. ■ Photo A. Aluminum angle stock hotted to the sides supports aluminum lopf bottom, and rear panels.

THE ROBOT 800 SPECIALTY MODE TERMINAL If you have been shopping around for RTTY equipment, you probably have asked yourself: \"How can I get high performance, multiple-mode capabilities without spending a fortune?' Robot Research has answered this question through the use of microprocessor technology The Model 800 is the most complete specialty mode terminal ever offered for under $1000; yet it has features and performance capabilities which put it in the class of systems costing twice this amount or more1 All that's needed to have a complete opera t- ing system is the addition of a stan- dard TV monitor HOW DID WE DO IT? The most advanced RTTY sys- tems on the market are designed for multiple applications As a result, these systems are burdened with ex- otic features which are seldom used on amateur radio These 'features* add to the cost, complicate opera- tion, and in some cases even com* promise performance! The 800 does not attempt to dou- ble as a hobby computer or a time- share terminal. It was designed ex- pressly for use as a specialty mode communcations terminal for ama- teur radio, and nothing else! By focusing our attention on this simple concept, we are able to provide a product which works better, costs less, and is easier to operate than those systems which try to do \"everything\" and end up doing nothing very welL ONE EXAMPLE: The single most important factor which affects RTTY receive perfor- mance is the quality of the demod- ulator In the 800, we do not allow for a wide variety of shift frequencies through the use of tuneable filters. There are only two shifts which are used in amateur RTTY, and tuneable discriminator filters are both expen- sive and are poor in performance. The 800 uses separate mark and space discriminator fitters for each of these two shifts which are pre* cisely tuned at our factory. Even though the center frequency for the mark filter is the same for both wide and narrow shifts, the bandwidth is different and therefore requires sep- arate filters. By giving careful atten- tion to these details, we can equal or exceed the performance found only in expensive stand-alone terminal units. WHAT ABOUT FEATURES? The Model 800 has all of the ad- vanced operating features such as split-screen, word and line editing, message memories, autostart, SELCOM, and many others. In addi- tion, the 800 has a complete set of operating aids such as an on-screen Status line, graphic tuning indicator, and a side-tone oscillator. To get a complete picture of all of the fea- tures which the 800 offers, we sug- gest that you contact us for a full- color brochure, or visit one of our dealers for a demonstration.

Time was, if you had a srnal I tar and wanted to put a synthesized two- meter rig in it, you either cultivated a sadistic disregard for your passen- ger's knees or got yourself one of the two rigs on the market with a compact separate control head. The new Kenwood TR-7730 is part of a trend that will change all that. Measuring a mere 2\" high, 5.75\" wide, and 775\" deep, it will fit in the smallest of cars without usurping precious legroom and is even compact enough to fit in the extra radio slot located in the console of many newer cars. One might suppose that a great deal was sacrificed to cram ev- erything into such a small package. Surprisingly, this is not the case. Without fur- ther ado, lets take a tour of what the TR-7730 has to offer. The Features Starting in the upper left- hand corner of the front panel, we find the memory channel selector and two square push-buttons — one marked \"M\" and the other marked \"MR\", The \"M\" but- ton loads the frequency shown on the digital display into one of the five memo- ries. This frequency can later be recalled by pressing the \"MR\" button and choos- ing the desired position on the rotary selector. On memories 1-4, the transmit- ter offset is set with the switch on the far right-hand side of the front panel. Memory 5 programs both The Kenwood TR-7730. 26 73 Magazine * DecembGf, 1981 transmit and receive fre- quencies, allowing access to repeaters using non-stan- dard splits. Beneath the memory controls are the combina- tion power switch and vol- ume control and the squelch. Directly to the right of these is the main tuning knob, which steps through the band in a simi- lar manner to the knob on the TR-9000. Just to the right of the main tuning knob is a switch which selects either 5- or1Q-kHz steps with each click of the main tuning knob, a high/low power se- lector, and an on/off switch for a user-installed CTCSS encoder. Directly above these are three switches as- sociated with the scanning circuitry. Pressing the \"Scan\" switch starts the 7730 scanning up the band. It will stop on any signal that breaks the squelch and resume scanning when the signal drops If you hold down the scan button con- tinuously, the rig scans at twice the normal rate. If you wish to remain on a fre- quency, press the PTT switch on the mike or the \"Hold\" button on the front panel. Pressing the \"MS\" switch scans the five fre- quencies programmed into Top view of the Kenwood TR-7730. Bottom view of the Kenwood TR-773Q. the memories, The scan and hold switches work in both the band- and memory- scanning modes. The up/down switches on the microphone function only in the band-scanning mode. All displays are of the LED variety There is a bar- graph S/rf -meter similiar to that on the TR-7800, al- though the display on the TR-7730 seems to be less prone to flickering. Above this are three LEDs, The one on the far right lights to in- dicate that a repeater off- set has been selected, the middle when the unit is transmitting, and the left when a signal that breaks the squelch is present. To the left of this is the main frequency display. Most of the rear panel is dedicated to a heat sink for the final amplifier. In a clus- ter on the left side are the antenna connector, power cable, speaker jack, and a three^prong jack for a mem- ory backup power supply. Big Rig Performance Kenwood wisely avoided compromise in the rf stages in their down-sized rig. The transmitter and receiver stages are strikingly similar to those in the TR-7600, Space was saved by shrink- ing the control circuitry, re- placing some discrete com- ponents in the audio chain with JCs, and simplifying the final stage. Specifica- tions are virtually identical for the two rigs. Sensitivity is rated at better than .5 uV for 30 dB S/N. Selectivity is spec'd at 12 kHz at 6 dB down and 25 kHz at the — 60-dB point In the high- power mode, our unit ex- ceeded its rated 25 Watts at all frequencies between 144 and 148 MHz Output in the low-power position is continuously adjustable, making it easy to match the rig to amplifiers requiring only 10 Watts or so of drive As with most commercial rigs, the deviation level was set slightly high for the close-talking most hams use to improve signal to noise in a car, but was easi- ly readjusted. In actual use, the TR-7730 is a champ. It worked perfectly the mo- ment it came out of the box. Both transmit and re ceive audio have the usual Kenwood characteris- tics— high fidelity with no sacrifice of intelligibility. The squelch is extremely sensitive and seems to latch up resolutely, without the mushtness encountered on many rigs. The controls are thoughtfully shaped and lo- cated—most of us should have no trouble putting the TR-7730 through its paces in a dark moving vehicle. The bar-graph S-meter, which first struck me as be- ing a gimmick of question- able utility, turned out to be extremely useful It's a lot easier to read at a glance than a D'Arsonval movement. The only thing more en- joyable than using this rig is deciding where to install it! It's so small that the possi- bilities are almost endless. After considerable debate, I removed the AM radio from my Dodge Colt's dash board and cut away the plastic faceplate with a fine-toothed saw and a cou- ple of files. I didn't know whether or not the rig would actually fit until the faceplate was completely cutaway. Behind the dash I found two metal braces, of- fering plenty of support. The fit is so tight that I didn't have to screw the rig down. I connected the re- mote speaker jack to the in- dash speakers supplied with the car. Not for the squeamish, an in-dash or console instal- lation can nevertheless be extremely satisfying, I used to enjoy having my car look like a mobile NASA control center, with rigs hanging everywhere, but I get even more pleasure from the clean setup I now have. If you decide to try an m-dash installation, just be sure that there is plenty of air circulation available. Inad- equate cooling can kill a rig. I used the Kenwood MC-46 DTMF mike, and I must admit I have a love/ hate relationship with it. On the plus side, it has all 16 tones, which is useful, and the audio quality of the condensor mike element is unquestionably superior to the mike packed with the rig. On the negative side of the ledger, the mike is small! It took me a couple of days to learn how to han- dles it without inadvertent- ly pushing one of the but- tons on the pad The hang- up hook resembles those on other microphones I own, but it is slightly smaller, so it won't stay put in either of the mike holders in my car, The small size no longer bothers me, but I am still looking for something to hang the mike on when I am not using it. My advice is to check out the mike careful- ly before buying, and if it seems too small to cope with, pick up a Kenwood MC-45 You'll need to re- wire the mike connector, but the 45 is a solid, full- sized microphone, sure to please the most ham-hand- ed ham! The MC-46 has some nice features, though, and is probably well worth the effort required to get used to it Nothing is perfect, of course, and the TR-7730 is no exception. I found three relatively minor things I would like to see improved. First, the main frequency display is anything but easy to read. No doubt the loca- tion I chose for the rig Continued on page 196 73 Magazine • December, 1981 27 HUSTLER HF MOBILES DELIVER FIXED STATION PERFORMANCE Hustler HF antennos delivi outstanding signal reports Wherever you're mobile?
