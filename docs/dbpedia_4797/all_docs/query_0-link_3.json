Mr. Anthony Fden. has made a declar- ation In the House of Commons that Great Brit- ain will honor to the full her engagements under Locarno. From the standpoint of OFeat~firitain - the extent of the--guilt of Germany has to be defined. Prance has already taken an adaman- tine attitude on that guilt and be lieves that her own hands are clcap to the Pac^ she h»» nego- tiated with Russia. When the French -Soviet Pact waa ln~proeesff of naRotiatlon. con.slderable umbrage to it was taken in Germany. There was both hostility and Indignation that France rtieald link herself with an Ea.sfern and^a Commtinl.st State. It was pointed euVW Germany thav she eouid even mat- ' tew by joining the Pact. This suggestion was met with .srnrn Germany, under Herr Hitler, could not contemplate such an alliance. The at- titude of Germany towards the Soviet Power Is .summed up by The neuf<;rhp Alluenielne Zeltung when It said: \"Soviet Russia today .shows the face of Janus. In spite of all disavowals and subter- fuges. Soviet foreign policy and Commlntern are Siamese twins.\" The German contention Is that the French-S5vlet Pact goes clean against the spirit of Locarno. .Tlierr is an irreconcilable viewpoint a.s between France and Germany on which the League of Nations has to render a verdict, -Apart from the implirations afTertinpr the Locarno Part.

The actual deficit is $6,600,000.\" A dispatch of this character unquestionably will do harm to British Columbia's interests, not only to the credit of the Province but to the llkelttieod of any new capital coming here from British sources. The point Is tliat no matter what may be the rategory under which the depletion of .sinking,' funds come.s, (he bnrrowinc.s from the Dominion Government definitely come under an Increase in the Provincial debt.

HIDDKN TAXES Ti'.o.'je who. flgurafivelv .speaking, are throwing , up their liats with glee at the idea of compulsion by the State for provision for their bodily ills w:ll Inul their mood very much chastened Imme- diately, that the taxation goes into effect. The character of that taxation has been set forth In a prelim 11, uv milline of the provisions of the fortftqommg Bill. Evidently in the matter of .. taxation neither a flnahfiial nor a mathematical mind was brought to bear on the subject. In this respect if is well to point out a feature of what is proposed as Indicative of the loo.se fash- Ion In which the whole scheme of compulsory health insurance is beln^ devl.sed. It is set forth with the utmost clearness that Uia'tax for health Insurance will be 1 per cent for enipliiyers and 2 per cent for employees^ It la set fo>th with equal cleame.ss that the mini- mum contribution of any employee will be 35 ( cntu weekly. It Is in respect to thl.s minimum that the proposals put forward ofTlcially are arithmetically at fault. A minimum tax of 35 ceilU per week u a toUl of tltJO per annum. Th$A amount Is 2 per cent of a yearly .salary or wage of $910. Every one affected by the legis- laUon to to pay at least this mtolmum. ao that r In the rase.^ of all earning a yearly .salary or wage y of less than $910 (and thefe are many thousands in thto eategory) they win be paying more than 2 per cent of their .salaries or wages for health insurance. They will, in other words, be subjected to hidden taxation. In the ease oi a person earning $10 a week, on the oflflclal basis, he or she wUl be paying nearly 4 per cent of the .salary or Wag* tnitoad of the 2 per cent ao frequently htrtldtd M tho baato of tiM Mctolatioii. There Is the same arithmetical dl.screpancy Where the employers' taxes are concerned. The mtnliBttin tax ait for an cml^oyer Is 20 cents per employee, which amounts to $10.40 per annum. Ou an arithmetical basis this means that for every employee who receives less than $i.040 a year the employer's tax will be greater than 1 per cent pf the wage or salary. The smaller the vfage Isr Um greater proportionately will be the tax on the employer. This feature of the leg^- latlon docs not .seem to have been recognized by employers. They should awaken to the fact that, according to an oflVial explanation of what the forthcoming Bill will contain. It is not 1 per rent of the payroll of those receiving le.ss than $1,800 ^ a year that the employer wiU be called. «pair to pay In the form of a tax. but what wtU amount to 2 pet cent, or POMibly juore. \"\"^^ The foregotog figures, studied with the aid of any ai ithmeflcal prlTner which muld be obtained from the Free Text Books Branch of the Provto- clal X>epaitiheRt dl Sdudation, will illustrate that the ofTlcial outline of the compulsory health ta- surancc legislation is contradictory to terms. The todividual who has a salary orjragi laaa than ^,i,„.,..ttlfll. per, alburn will be .tJixrfl mnre thaa 2 per. cent; th« employer will pay more than i per rent on all salaries or weger less than $i,040 per annum. This mean.s that the tax on todustry generally, to be promoted on behalf of health lhaurance, will be heavier than anticipated.

No Prime Minister or Premier Is standing over treasuries with .shot- guiu to keep plunderers at bay. Rt. Hon. WlUlam Lyon Maekensle King Is not likely to endanger hi* precious health by too great zeal in defence ot the Dominion treasury. No piarti'al iiolitician is worried about the alleged neces&ity of bal- ancing revenues and expenditures for the purpose of warding off to- evltaWe lasolvency. Government Ls no longer a science; it Is an orgy. Treasuries are being raided not only by todlviduals who believe they have a right to \"live upon the OBontry.\" as some of them did to the days of Mackenzie. Treasuries are beUig looted by countless com- miflsions whose tovestlgatiions will be frulfle.s.s. whose reports will be valueless, and whose cost Ui in demnitles and traveling expense!, in tlie aggreRate will amount to more than the entire cost of government in the days when Liberalism wa.^ In its infancy and Its fine prtociples mtrely in the bud. • • • When the treasuries are as bare as Old Mother Hubbard's cupboard, and more money is needed, the money can be borrowed. t»lk about the simplicity of Father Abcr- hart and the credulity of hi^ lowers -and the Judgment of the philosopher t^iat the people of Eng- land ars mostly fools.
