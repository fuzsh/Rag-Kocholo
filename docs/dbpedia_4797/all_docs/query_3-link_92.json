        "text": "The film, loosely based on the life of former senator Panfilo Lacson, took the biggest plum, being named the festival’s best picture during the awards night on Friday at the Meralco Theatre in Pasig City.\n\nJoyce Bernal was named the best director for the film, and its leading star Robin Padilla was the best actor. 10,000 Hours also snared the awards for sound engineering, musical score, visual effects, production design, editing, cinematography, original story, screenplay and supporting actor (Pen Medina).\n\nBernal dedicated her award to her son and the film’s producers.\n\n“When they talked to me, they said they wanted to win an award, and it came true. They also wanted to earn, but we haven’t earned yet, so is it okay that the award came first?” Bernal said.\n\nThe film also won the Fernando Poe Jr (FPJ) Memorial Award for Excellence, which was presented by Sen. Grace Poe-Llamanzares and her son, Brian, and the Gat Puno Villegas Cultural Award.\n\nMy Little Bossings won the Third Best Picture and Best Original Theme Song awards. Aiza Seguerra was the best supporting actress and Ryzza Mae Dizon, the best child performer.\n\nMaricel Soriano was named best actress for her role in Girl Boy Bakla Tomboy.\n\nThe horror film, Pagpag: Siyam na Buhay, bagged the Youth Choice Award and the Best Makeup trophies.\n\nBoy Golden: The Arturo Porcuna Story starring E R Ejercito, won the award for Best Parade Float.\n\nPadilla acknowledged that 10,000 Hours may not have been a big box-office grosser.\n\nThe filmfest’s top earners were My Little Bossings, Girl Boy Bakla Tomboy and Pagpag.\n\nIn the New Wave category, Dukit won for best picture, as well as best director for Armando Lao.\n\nWilly Layug, Bambalito Lacap, and Bor Ocampo tied for best actor.\n\nAgot Isidro’s performance in Alvin Yapan’s Mga Anino ng Kahapon won her the best actress award and the film also won the special jury prize. Girl Boy Bakla Tomboy won the Most Gender-Sensitive Film award for the main event.\n\nSpecial recognition was given to Optical Media Board chairperson Ronnie Ricketts.\n\nDaniel Padilla was named Male Star of the Night and Eugene Domingo the Female Star.\n\n10,000 Hours is a fictional rendition of Lacson’s flight from the country after the court ordered his arrest in 2010 for allegedly masterminding the murders of publicist Salvador “Bubby” Dacer and Emmanuel Corbito in 2000."
