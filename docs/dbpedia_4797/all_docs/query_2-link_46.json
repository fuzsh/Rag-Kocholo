        "text": "Our style of Beer is best defined by our mission to truly be the best; true to style, bold, adventurous, and assertive. We typically have two to three IPA’s on tap with many other styles available as well.\n\nWe offer over a full line up of over a dozen of our handcrafted ales from IPAs, Pales, Golden, Red, Stouts, and Porters. We often brew with local ingredients such as Taro (Kalo), Blood Orange, and Passion Fruit. If you can’t stay for a pint and wish to take one home for later, that’s okay! We sell 24oz, 40oz, and 64oz growlers as well as 32 oz Crowlers (cans) you can take home with you. We also offer kegs for special parties or functions.\n\nBelow is a list of all our beers that we brew but for an accurate list of beer available today, we encourage you to stop by our brewpub and check out our beer menu board as they change on a regular basis. Follow us on social media for up-to-date information on us and our brewer’s specials.\n\nCraft brewing has become a global phenomenon that includes a rich culture of community. Breweries share a mutual respect for each other while engaging in the pursuit to create unique, memorable flavors and aromas. Statewide and national competitions serve as a way for microbreweries to showcase their creations and sample the work of others. We are proud to represent the World’s Westernmost branch of the microbrewing culture.\n\nEach of our recipes is the result of many batches and experiments. Every flavor has been curated over time and we are eager to share with you the results of our efforts.\n\nTaste for yourself."
