This year, we added another editors’ pick as well. The top restaurants were announced during a live reception held Aug. 27, 2024 at The Kāhala Hotel & Resort.\n\nThe Hale ‘Aina Awards are the state’s longest-running and most prestigious dining honors, started by HONOLULU Magazine in 1984 to elevate the best restaurants in Hawai‘i. Whether you’re looking for weekend brunch spots, your new favorite cocktail or the best places to indulge your sweet tooth, we got you. This list of Hale ‘Aina-winning restaurants is your all-year, can’t-miss dining guide.\n\nSee our upcoming September 2024 issue for the stories behind some of the Hale ‘Aina Award honorees.\n\nCongratulations to this year’s winners for operating at the highest levels of quality and offering Hawai‘i’s most delicious and innovative dishes."
