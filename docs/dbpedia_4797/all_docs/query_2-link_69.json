        "text": "NAIOP Hawaii has served as the state’s premier association of development industry leaders and decision-makers since 1988.\n\nFor nearly three decades our annual Kukulu Hale Awards program has recognized individuals and organizations whose projects, professional achievements, and civic service have contributed to Hawai‘i’s economic growth and enriched our community.\n\nWe invite you to read about this year’s awardees and distinguished entries in the following pages. Special honorees include D.R. Horton Hawaii, Developer of the Year; Randy Hiraki, Lifetime Achievement; Kūhiō Lewis, Outstanding Service Award; and Nordic PCL Construction, Contractor of the Year.\n\nOn behalf of our board of directors and NAIOP Hawaii’s 180-plus members, I extend deepest gratitude to our Kukulu Hale sponsors, jurors and committee members. Their generous support makes this year’s program possible.\n\nMahalo!\n\nReyn Tanaka,\n\n2024 President\n\nNAIOP Hawaii\n\n2024 Kukulu Hale Jurors\n\nKukulu Hale Awards Committee\n\nJennifer Camp and Catherine Camp, Co-Chairs\n\nTodd Apo, Liana Dietz, Larry Heim, Mike Imanaka, Glen Kaneshige, Courtney Kosaka, Mele Pochereva, Barbie Rosario, Sunny Rosario, Leighton Yuen\n\nDeveloper of the Year – Ku Ho’okela Award: D.R. Horton Hawaii\n\nFor 50 years, D.R. Horton Hawaii has been building affordable and workforce housing for Hawai‘i’s families. During that time, the homebuilder’s dedicated team has constructed upwards of 15,000 homes across O‘ahu, Maui, Kaua‘i and Hawai‘i Island, with thousands more on the horizon. D.R. Horton Hawaii continues its legacy of commitment to local communities not just through the homes it builds but through its partnerships across Hawai‘i.\n\nSince 2005, D.R. Horton Hawaii has believed in the tremendous potential West O‘ahu holds for Hawai‘i’s families. It has worked for many years to bring this project to fruition. At 1,550 acres, Ho‘opili, in West O‘ahu, is D.R. Horton Hawaii’s largest project in the Islands. When complete, the master-planned community is expected to offer up to 11,750 new homes within a variety of mixed-use neighborhood design concepts.\n\nMany of the housing units are created with families in mind, with affordable rental and for sale opportunities for those earning between 30% AMI to above 200% AMI. Ho‘opili, which means to come together in Hawaiian, will create opportunities for families to grow and businesses to thrive, with community centers, tot lot and recreational parks, temporary soccer fields, and a Bark and Ride Park for dogs.\n\nHo‘opili is O‘ahu’s first master-planned community to be integrated with the Skyline rail. It is designed for both vertically and horizontally integrated mixed-use development around the Keoneae at UH-West O‘ahu and the Honouliuli at Ho‘opili rail stations.\n\nWhile D.R. Horton Hawaii is rooted in building homes for Hawai‘i’s families, its team members are proud to build and grow relationships by giving back through volunteerism and in-kind and charitable contributions. For years, D.R. Horton Hawaii has partnered with the Institute for Human Services, Special Olympics Hawaii, and Blood Bank of Hawaii and donated parcels of land to the Waianae Coast Comprehensive Health Center for a new clinic and the Hawaiian Humane Society for its Kosasa Family Campus at Ho‘opili to ensure much-needed services are available to West O‘ahu families and the community.\n\nIts team is actively involved in the Ho‘opili community, partnering with the Ho‘opili Community Association and the Ho‘opili Neighborhood Watch to host family friendly, community-oriented events on Ho‘opili’s Festival Street, safe driving campaigns, and urban garden learning fairs.\n\nAcknowledging the area’s rich history, 159 acres of land in Ho‘opili is planned to remain in perpetual commercial agriculture contributing to O‘ahu’s food sustainability needs for generations to come. Community urban gardens are integrated within Ho‘opili to provide residents opportunities to practice sustainable farming methods and grow their own fruits, herbs and vegetables. Single-family home lots come with fully landscaped edible garden yards consisting of fruit trees such as citrus and banana, herbs such as lemongrass and rosemary, shrubs such as sugarcane and pomegranate, and raised planting beds growing green onions, lettuce and eggplant. Mango, ulu and avocado trees can be found throughout Ho‘opili’s parks and condominium properties.\n\n“Our team is dedicated to D.R. Horton Hawaii’s mission, and commitment to community is paramount to our success,” said Tracy Tonaki, D.R. Horton Hawaii’s president. “Building homes is more than just a job; it is something we are very passionate about and our promise to Hawai‘i’s families in the place that we call home. On behalf of our entire D.R. Horton Hawaii ‘Ohana, we are extremely humbled by and grateful to NAIOP Hawaii for this extraordinary honor.”\n\nLifetime Achievement Award- Holo Pono Award\n\nRandy Hiraki\n\nPresident, Commercial Plumbing, Inc.\n\nRandy Hiraki was just eight months shy of his 30th birthday when he opened a small residential plumbing company in his garage with a business partner. Never did he imagine that nearly 40 years later Commercial Plumbing would have grown to be the largest plumbing company in Hawai’i, with projects that span the islands and business sectors, from hotels and hospitals to high-rise residential and research facilities.\n\nRandy’s introduction to a plumbing career took place in high school when he signed up for a vocational seminar “because we got a free lunch and the rest of the school day off,” he recalls with a chuckle.\n\n“I learned that plumbers were the highest paid trade at the time and decided that’s what I wanted to do.” The day after graduation he started as an apprentice at a large plumbing company, learning the nuts and bolts of the trade on the way to earning his journeyman license. In 1984 Randy enrolled in an SBA program to learn the fundamentals of running a small business; the following year he was in business, taking on small residential jobs and eventually expanding into commercial work.\n\nHe has built the company on innovation, integrity, and customer service, and he places a high value on training and continuing education to keep his employees and himself tuned in to the latest industry advancements. Some innovations come from Randy’s own inventive mind; his ideas for new, high-tech equipment are brought to life with help from a robotics engineer in Colorado.\n\n“Not only is Randy a good tradesman, but he’s also a very good businessman,” acknowledges Vice President Mark Suzuki, who was brought aboard 24 years ago to help grow the company and oversee its financial and administrative functions.\n\nToday Commercial Plumbing is employee-owned. It operates under an E.S.O.P. adopted in 2011 and a top down commitment to using the latest technology and developing a talented team to provide the best quality of work at the best prices. The company’s nearly 250 employees include not only skilled plumbers, sprinkler fitters and project managers, but also mechanical engineers and designers trained in 3D building information modeling (BIM) and CAD.\n\nBelieving the key to success is good, loyal employees to keep local industries going, Randy’s biggest goal is to provide mentorship and training that enables his employees to run the company someday so they, too, can be successful in life – and continue to provide good jobs for home-grown talent. He also wants employees to understand that when a company does well, it’s important to give back to the community.\n\nLeading by example, Randy has served on the board of the Great Aloha Run for the past 17 years and offers the company’s professional services pro bono for worthy causes, including the plumbing for Kahauiki Village housing community for homeless families and projects at University of Hawai‘i sports facilities. Three large food distribution events on O‘ahu during the pandemic and, more recently, collecting and loading containers of food and supplies for Maui wildfire victims are just some of the ways that Commercial Plumbing employees have come together in company-sponsored support of community needs.\n\nNAIOP Hawaii salutes Randy Hiraki for his decades-long success as a business leader who hasn’t lost sight of his company’s humble beginning.\n\nOutstanding Service Award\n\nKūhiō Lewis\n\nCEO, Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement\n\nSince taking the helm of the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement (CNHA) in 2018, Kūhiō Lewis has been instrumental in driving the growth of this community development financial institution, a nonprofit committed to advancing cultural, economic, political and community development for Native Hawaiians. Programs he has initiated in just six years not only have uplifted thousands of local individuals, families, and businesses, but also have transformed the 24-year old organization, leading to CNHA’s recognition as one of Hawai‘i’s top 100 companies in 2023.\n\nThese programs include the Hawaiian Trades Academy, established in 2020 to raise household income for local families by providing highly valued certifications like Hazmat, Hazwhopper, OSHA, CDL; a revolving Loan Fund that has raised over $20 million to help more than 300 businesses and individuals access capital through CNHA’s community development lending arm; and Pop-Up Makeke, an innovative, online marketplace launched in 2021 to help Native Hawaiian businesses survive the pandemic. The marketplace continues to thrive and has supported over 400 businesses, generated $6.5 million in sales, and sold over 600,000 local products globally.\n\nCNHA’s tourism arm, Kilohana, was established in 2022, a pivotal year in which the organization secured a $27.4 million contract from the Hawai‘i Tourism Authority, becoming a prime marketer and tourism steward for the state. Then, in response to the Maui wildfires last August, CNHA sprang into action with Kako‘o Maui, an initiative to quickly and efficiently deploy resources to Native Hawaiian communities impacted by the fires. The program has raised over $34 million in private donations and has provided multi-faceted support for Maui’s recovery efforts. It has served more than 4,000 Maui residents in various ways, including continued housing for those displaced by the fires, a resource center that serves as a hub for multiple service providers, and certifications for over 400 residents to work in the burn zone.\n\nThis track record aptly has earned Kūhiō a reputation as a leader who gets things done without letting bureaucracy get in the way, thereby enabling CNHA to pivot and implement programs quickly to seize opportunities or meet urgent needs.\n\nHis journey up to now hasn’t been entirely by choice. “It seems as though these responsibilities have found their way to me,” he says. “My life took unexpected turns. I became a parent in high school; graduated three years later than planned; became a single parent at 21; and attended community college to discover my path. It was there that I was introduced to the beginnings of my leadership journey within the Hawaiian community. These were the elements shaping my life’s trajectory, with my kuleana (responsibility) calling out to me.”\n\nKūhiō explains that growing up from modest beginnings has given him a profound outlook on life: “I’ve learned that nothing worthwhile comes without effort; you have to work for it and sometimes fight for it. Instead of fixating on obstacles, I focus on finding solutions and taking action. I choose to surround myself with like-minded individuals who share a determination to challenge the status quo.”\n\nKūhiō’s determination, innovation, and commitment to community advancement have led to what some have described as CNHA’s transformation from “an organization for Hawaiians” to “a Hawaiian organization for Hawai‘i.”\n\n2024 Kukulu Hale Award Winners\n\nNew Project Award – Commercial/Other Over 40,000 SF\n\nCivil Beat Plaza\n\nEntrant: G70\n\nDeveloper/Owner: 3650 Waialae LLC\n\nLead Design Firm: G70\n\nGeneral Contractor: Nordic PCL Construction, Inc.\n\nThe Civil Beat Plaza is a new ground-up, mixed-use commercial office building with sustainability and innovation baked into the DNA of its design. Although the building is brand new, it strives to evoke and maintain a harmonious presence along Waialae Avenue that blends into the eclectic existing urban fabric of the surrounding built environment, while honoring the historical nature of the neighborhood through massing, materials, color, patterning, and retail street frontage. The existing Goodwill that was located on the site is retained and becomes the prominent face to the neighborhood along with a neighborhood restaurant located at the corner plaza.\n\nNew Project Award – Commercial/Other Over 40,000 SF\n\nKona Village, A Rosewood Resort\n\nEntrant: Nordic PCL Construction, Inc.\n\nDeveloper/Owner: KW Kona Investors LLC\n\nLead Design Firm: Walker Warner Architects\n\nGeneral Contractor: Nordic PCL Construction, Inc.\n\nKona Village, A Rosewood Resort, is an iconic hideaway that was devastated by a tsunami in 2011. This beloved resort remained in disrepair until 2023 when the re-imagined 81-acre property with 150 thatched-roof bungalows reopened. Five restaurants and bars, including the original resort’s Shipwreck building, Talk Story bars, and Asaya Spa are powered 100% by solar energy. Several buildings have been designed for LEED Gold Certification. Working with the natural landscape and existing archaeological landmarks, the design respectfully restores the original Pacific Island style with modern touches and innovative sustainable elements.\n\nNew Project Award – Commercial/Other 40,000 SF or Less\n\n‘Āhuimanu\n\nEntrant: Hunt Companies Hawai‘i\n\nDeveloper/Owner: Hunt Companies Hawai‘i\n\nLead Design Firm: Steve W.G. Au & Associates\n\nGeneral Contractor: Shioi Construction, Inc.\n\n‘Āhuimanu is a 36,000-square-foot, mixed-use town center located in historic Kīlauea Town on Kaua‘i. The project was developed by Hunt Companies to bring improved convenience and quality services to local Kīlauea residents and visitors, who previously had to travel to Princeville for neighborhood services or to shop. By mid-2022 ‘Āhuimanu was fully leased, and construction was completed in September 2023. Anchored by the 12,700-square-foot Kīlauea Market + Café, ‘Āhuimanu’s tenants include a wide variety of restaurants, retail and community services. Most are established Kaua‘i businesses seeking outlets on the North Shore.\n\nNew Project Award – Commercial/Other Over 40,000 SF\n\nAC Hotel Honolulu\n\nEntrant: Allied Builders System\n\nDeveloper/Owner: Continental Assets Management\n\nLead Design Firm: NORR, Inc.\n\nGeneral Contractor: Allied Builders System\n\nThe AC Hotel Honolulu is an exciting renovation and adaptive reuse of the 1960s-era office building originally designed by the renowned Hawai‘i architect, Ernest Hara. This project helps preserve and resurrect an elegant mid-century modern building by enhancing its appearance and optimizing its use. It reactivates an important intersection in downtown Honolulu and adds a new urban boutique hotel to serve business travelers as well as tourists and locals who want an alternative hotel option outside the Waikiki area. This project will contribute significantly to the economic growth and revitalization of this area.\n\nRenovation Award – Commercial/Other Over 40,000 SF\n\nHawaii State Federal Credit Union\n\nEntrant: Nordic PCL Construction, Inc. & hi-arch-y LLC\n\nDeveloper/Owner: Andrew Rosen\n\nLead Design Firm: hi-arch-y LLC\n\nGeneral Contractor: Nordic PCL Construction, Inc.\n\nThe new Hawaii State FCU headquarters consolidates multiple locations and brings together 240 employees to streamline customer service efficiency and prioritize wellness, collaboration, and innovation.

This consolidation provides the staff with space and resources for future growth, while promoting employee collaboration through innovation and technology.\n\nRenovation Award – Commercial/Other 40,000 SF or Less\n\nPapa Pilialoha – The Friendship Floor\n\nEntrant: Ferraro Choi And Associates, Ltd.\n\nDeveloper/Owner: Central Pacific Bank\n\nLead Design Firm: Ferraro Choi And Associates, Ltd.\n\nGeneral Contractor: J Kadowaki Inc.\n\nPapa Pilialoha – The Friendship Floor is a communal workspace created to cultivate inspiration and engagement among Central Pacific Bank employees who typically work remotely or have hybrid schedules. The design was shaped by input from a cross section of departments and generations. Over 12,500 square feet of open concept and multi-functional spaces accommodate everything from individuals’ focused work to large special events. Features include sit-to-stand workstations, formal and casual gathering spaces, a wellness/nursing room, treadmill desks, phone booths, and a ‘Park and Recreation’ area to decompress and socialize with coworkers.\n\nPublic/Government Project Award\n\nWalter Dods, Jr. RISE Center\n\nEntrant: Hunt Companies Hawai‘i\n\nDeveloper/Owner: Hunt Companies Hawai‘i\n\nLead Design Firm: Design Partners, Inc.\n\nGeneral Contractor: Moss & Associates\n\nThe University of Hawai‘i and UH Foundation embarked on a bold vision for an immersive, multi-story, live-learn-work community woven into the entrepreneurial ecosystem. They hired Hunt Companies to design, build and finance the RISE Center, which offers 374 undergraduate students the opportunity to live and learn in spaces that include state-of-the-art technology and hands-on workshop spaces for collaboration and mentorship. RISE serves as a catalyst for economic diversification and fosters an environment of workforce development, generating valuable opportunities for young people through venture creation and collaboration with established organizations.\n\nNonprofit Project Award\n\nDiamond Head Theatre\n\nEntrant: Allied Builders System\n\nDeveloper/Owner: Diamond Head Theatre\n\nLead Design Firm: Studio Red Architects\n\nGeneral Contractor: Allied Builders System\n\nAt 17,000 square feet, the new Diamond Head Theatre is a focal point for the local arts community in Hawaii, featuring a full fly loft, enhanced audio-visual capabilities, and improved sight lines. It includes additional restrooms, an expanded box office, upgraded concessions, new dressing rooms, green room spaces, an improved scene shop, and back-of-house areas. With a commitment to environmentally sensitive design, the project used locally sourced CMU blocks and oriented the building to utilize prevailing winds for a covered exterior lobby. The team collaborated with the theatre to ensure continuous operation throughout the project, minimizing performance interruptions.\n\nGreen Building Award\n\nKona Village, A Rosewood Resort\n\nEntrant: VCA Green\n\nDeveloper/Owner: Kennedy Wilson\n\nLead Design Firms: Delawie\n\nGeneral Contractor: Nordic PCL Construction, Inc.\n\nEvery aspect of Kona Village was premised on the rich cultural heritage of “Malama Honua,” the Hawaiian phrase meaning “to care for our earth.” Respecting the Native Hawaiian knowledge of sustainability as a lived practice, the project includes the state’s largest private solar array, a reverse-osmosis water treatment plant, a comprehensive composting program, and much more – all contributing to three LEED v4 Gold certifications. For this complex rebuild of the original resort, which was devastated by a tsunami, the development team found balance among respecting culture, minimizing impact, and participating in the modern-day tourism industry.\n\nContractor of the Year: Nordic PCL Construction\n\nWith more than eight decades of building some of the most prominent projects that define Hawai‘i’s skyline, Nordic PCL Construction’s fingerprints can be found on all the major islands of Hawai‘i. Founded in Honolulu as a sole proprietorship, Carl John “C.J” Haglund was a Swede who set roots in the Islands and named his company “Nordic” as a tribute to his Scandinavian descent. Haglund sold Nordic Construction Company just as Hawai‘i entered an era of unprecedented growth following the end of World War II. Succeeding owners grew Nordic to a mid-size contractor with Hawai‘i’s transformation from agricultural communities to a tourism mecca and East-West business hub.\n\nIn 1995, the opportunity to partner with Denver-based PCL Construction Services for the $200M design-build Hawai‘i Convention Center laid the foundation for Nordic to eventually become part of the PCL family of companies in 2008. Although the acquisition provided the financial strength and resources to allow the kama’aina company to grow, Nordic PCL Construction maintained its personalized approach to working with clients by “being big on capability with a small company feel.” Nordic PCL’s president, Glen Kaneshige, says the company’s growth and longevity would not have been achievable without a team who embrace the timeless values that govern how local business relationships are managed. “We are only as good as our people, and successful projects depend on successful relationships,” says Kaneshige. “It is rare for a construction company to last for more than eight decades, but great partnerships with clients, design professionals, subcontractors and unions are paramount.”\n\nWhile Nordic PCL’s projects are often identified by a tower crane like the ongoing Hilton Grand Vacations Ka Haku timeshare tower at the former location of the King’s Village Shopping Center in Waikiki or the Halawa View Apartments near Aloha Stadium for Pacific Development Group, the company has undertaken unusual projects like the reconstruction of Kona Village Resort on 81 acres of lava fields. The company is also completing the conversion of the King Kalakaua Plaza (“Niketown”) in Waikiki into timeshares. Nordic PCL’s portfolio runs the full gamut of market sectors including hospitality, healthcare, commercial office, retail, military, light industrial, and education.\n\nInvesting locally through community service matters for a business to be considered local in a geographically isolated location like Hawai‘i. The desire to give back to the community is a fundamental value Nordic PCL embraces and fosters to build cultural understanding and deepen relationships. The company supports charitable giving through fundraising and direct involvement with local charities that include the Aloha United Way, Hawaii Foodbank, Habitat for Humanity, American Heart Association, Special Olympics, Teach For America, and Child & Family Service. Selfless giving builds better communities, and Nordic PCL’s commitment to the local community is an integral piece of the company’s culture. By exemplifying the spirit of kokua and ‘ohana, the company has been recognized as one of Hawai‘i’s “Best Places to Work” and “Most Charitable Companies” on multiple occasions by Hawaii Business Magazine.\n\nKaneshige postulates that growing and sustaining market presence requires keeping focused on the three “Rs” – Results, Relationships, and Reputation. “Great results develop the relationships that will forge reputation. Without the relationships and reputation, it would be challenging for any construction company to succeed in Hawai‘i let alone last more than eight decades.”\n\nDistinguished Entries\n\n1 Hotel Hanalei Bay\n\nEntrant: G70\n\nDeveloper/Owner: SOF-XI Kauai PV Hotel LP\n\nLead Design Firm: : Lake Flato (concept/ schematic) & G70 (Architect of Record)\n\nGeneral Contractors: Layton Construction; Nordic PCL Construction Inc.\n\nCentral Pacific Bank Flagship Branch Renovation\n\nEntrant: MGA Architecture LLC\n\nDeveloper/Owner: Central Pacific Bank\n\nLead Design Firm: MGA Architecture LLC\n\nGeneral Contractor: : Nordic PCL Construction, Inc.\n\nGirl Scouts of Hawai‘i STEM Center for Excellence\n\nEntrant: G70\n\nDeveloper/Owner: Girl Scouts of Hawai‘i\n\nLead Design Firm: G70\n\nGeneral Contractor: Hensel Phelps\n\nGrand Wailea Humuhumunukunukuapua‘a\n\nEntrant: Nordic PCL Construction Inc.\n\nDeveloper/Owner: BRE Hotels & Resorts\n\nLead Design Firm: G70\n\nGeneral Contractor: Nordic PCL Construction Inc.\n\nHale Makana O Mo‘ili‘ili\n\nEntrants: Moss & Associates & AHL\n\nDeveloper/Owner: ‘Ikenakea Development\n\nLead Design Firm: AHL\n\nGeneral Contractor: Moss & Associates\n\nHalewai‘olu Senior Residences\n\nEntrants: First Hawaiian Bank & American Savings Bank\n\nDeveloper/Owner: The Michaels Development Company\n\nLead Design Firm: WRNS Studio\n\nGeneral Contractor: Unlimited Construction Services, Inc.\n\nHalewai‘olu Senior Residences (Green Entry)\n\nEntrant: Unlimited Construction Services, Inc.\n\nDeveloper/Owner: The Michaels Organization\n\nLead Design Firm: WRNS Studio\n\nGeneral Contractor: Unlimited Construction Services, Inc.\n\nHanalei Base Yard Office and Garage\n\nEntrant: Unlimited Construction Services, Inc\n\nDeveloper/Owner: County of Kauai\n\nLead Design Firm: Marc Ventura AIA, LLC\n\nGeneral Contractor: Unlimited Construction Services, Inc\n\nHawaii Hochi Offices & Warehouse Renovation\n\nEntrant: MGA Architecture LLC\n\nDeveloper/Owner: Hawaii Hochi, Ltd.\n\nLead Design Firm: MGA Architecture LLC\n\nGeneral Contractor: Hawaiian Dredging Construction Co.\n\nHawaiian Humane Society Kosasa Family Campus\n\nEntrant: Allied Builders System\n\nDeveloper/Owner: Hawaiian Humane Society\n\nLead Design Firm: Pacific Asia Design Group, Inc.\n\nGeneral Contractor: Allied Builders System\n\nHonolulu Coffee at Grand Hyatt Kauai Resort & Spa\n\nEntrant: Layton Construction\n\nDeveloper/Owner: Honolulu Coffee\n\nLead Design Firm: Workshop.
