        "text": "The trail from Commonwealth to Commonwealth for the most famous horse race in America starts in 1918 when Kentucky-bred Exterminator, aka Old Bones, won the Kentucky Derby for Virginian Willis Sharpe Kilmer, who made his fortune selling the popular medical tonic “Swamp Root.”\n\nBefore his sophomore campaign, Kilmer’s future Hall of Fame trainer Henry McDaniel purchased a “work horse” for his Derby hopeful Sun Briar. McDaniel bought Old Bones and two other fillies in a package for $9,000, a huge price for the times,approximately $128,000 in current dollars, and well outside Kilmer’s $700 budget, $10,000 current value.\n\nKilmer was never a fan of Exterminator calling him “that Truck Horse” and we don’t know if it was because of the huge price tag or because the future Horse of the Year was, how do we say this gently, unattractive.\n\nNone the less, Exterminator went on to show up Sun Briar in the morning and to beat all his rivals in a muddy run for the roses.\n\nBefore he retired his jockey would say, \"When he was at his best, Exterminator could have beaten Man o' War or Citation or Kelso or any other horse that ever lived on any track doing anything.\" No hyperbole there.\n\nAs a gelding, Exterminator went on to compete in 99 races, winning 50, finishing second and third, 17 times each. His lifetime earnings amounted to $252,996 which was a big pile of money back in his day, about $3.6 million today.\n\nKilmer would find his way back to the winner’s circle on the first Saturday in May with Virginia-bred Reigh Count, who was born in the Shenandoah Valley somewhere near New Market, VA.\n\nIn 1934, Isabel Dodge Sloan of Brookmeade Farm in Upperville won the Derby with the New Jersey-bred Cavalcade. Brookmeade is now Joe Allbritton’s Lazy Lane Farm which produced Preakness winner Hansel. Before Sloan’s tenure at the Upperville nursery ended, she bred, Belmont winner and Horse of the Year, Sword Dancer who is happily ensconced in the Virginia Racing Hall of Fame.\n\nFast forward 32 years to 1966, when Dr. Frank O’Keefe of Pine Brook Farm bred the Kentucky Derby winner. For reasons unknown to us now, O’Keefe decided to foal his mare Sweep in Maryland. She crossed the Potomac and delivered a colt by Native Dancer who would be named Kauai King. In addition to the Derby, Kauai King would also win the second jewel of the Triple Crown, the Preakness Stakes.\n\nSix year’s later the world’s Kentucky Derby focus landed on Virginia and it was there for two straight years. Back-to-back Derby winner’s are rare for owner’s and it has only happened a two other times in the history of the race. On three occasions, the double involved future Triple Crown winners.\n\nVirginia’s The Meadow Stud was represented in the Churchill Downs winner’s circle in 1972 by Kentucky-bred Riva Ridge and again in 1973 by Virginia-bred Secretariat. Only two others have won back-to-back Derbies.\n\nCalumet Farm in Lexington, KY has done it twice with Ponder in 1948, Triple Crown winner Citation in 1949, Iron Liege in 1957, and Tim Tam in 1958. E.R. Bradley won consecutive renewals of the Kentucky Derby in 1931 with Twenty Grand and 1932 with Gallant Fox. Secretariat, Citation and Gallant Fox were all Triple Crown winners.\n\nIn 1980, Bert and Diana Firestone of Catoctin Farm in Waterford, VA captured the Derby and the hearts of American’s horse racing fans when their Kentucky-bred filly Genuine Risk became just the second girl to win the roses, breaking 65 year distaff drought. A $32,000 yearling, Genuine Risk would lose a controversial Preakness to Codex and finish second in the Belmont to eventual champion Temperence Hill.\n\nOne year after Genuine Risk’s popular victory, Thomas Mellon Evans’ Virginia-bred Pleasant Colony and his boisterous and colorful trainer Johnny Campo would capture the Derby and the Preakness only to lose the Belmont at the hands of Summing and a questionable judgment of the pace by jockey Jorge Velasquez. We won’t say that Summing stole the race, but he stole the race while PC’s jock napped back in third place.\n\nIn 1993, Sea Hero gave Virginia breeder Paul Mellon the victory in the last major race unconquered by Mellon’s Rokeby Stables. The Upperville Virginia multi-millionaire, philanthropist and horsemen had won most of the major races in America including the Belmont Stakes as well as some important races in England and France.\n\nThe Polish Navy colt’s win in the Derby made owner-breeder Mellon the only person to ever win the Kentucky Derby, the Epsom Derby, and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, having captured the latter two with Mill Reef in 1971. He still posthumously holds that record.\n\nIn 1994, a horse named Go For Gin won the Kentucky Derby and you would have to dig deep to figure out his Virginia connection. A Kentucky-bred, Go For Gin was purchased by Virginians Anne and Richard J.M. Poulson of Hare Forest Farm in Orange, VA.\n\nThe sales ticket was signed by John Finney the long-time president of the Fasig-Tipton auction company that conducts the famous Saratoga yearling sales. Finney picked out the colt at the Keeneland November Mixed Sale in Lexington, KY for a final bid of $32,000. The Poulsons then entered the colt in the Saratoga Select Yearling Sale the next August where he was purchased for $150,000—a tidy gross profit of $118,000 in a little over eight months time.\n\nThe Poulsons have never voiced publicly any regret about having sold the eventual Kentucky Derby winner.\n\nAnne Polsoun said, “My husband put it perfectly when it happened saying ‘We are commercial breeders and we want to be known for the horses we sell not the ones we keep.’ That’s it in a nutshell.”"
