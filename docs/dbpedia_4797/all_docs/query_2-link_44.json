        "text": "Marissa Boerner\n\nKealakehe High School\n\nFrom the canoe to the pool and soccer field, Marissa Boerner has filled her high school years with athletic achievement and dedication. As a leader and co-captain of the varsity water polo team, Marissa earned the title of Most Valuable Player. She also led her team to place third in their division in the 2023 Queen Liliuokalani Canoe Race.\n\nIn addition to her athletic success, Marissa was a member of the National Honor Society (NHS) where she embraced the values of service and making a difference. “NHS has been a great opportunity to make a difference here in our school community and beyond,” Marissa says. “These volunteer activities may be small, but it’s something that can make someone’s day or even have a lasting impact.”\n\nMarissa’s dedication to making a difference doesn’t stop there. With a drive for volunteer work, she devotes much of her time to enriching the lives of children. She’s worked as a kid’s ministry volunteer, leading and inspiring kindergarten students. As a mission trip volunteer, she went to an orphanage in Tijuana where she engaged with children, took part in community outreach events, and participated in construction projects.\n\nFrom a young age, Marissa has envisioned herself as a future veterinarian, inspired by her parents’ compassionate efforts in rescuing and caring for stray animals. She says, “Becoming a veterinarian is the best way I can help and care for animals in need in Hawaii and beyond.” Although Marissa is still deciding on which college to attend in the fall, she knows that her path will include pre-veterinary medicine.\n\nAndrew Paresa\n\nWaiakea High School\n\nAs a cross country and track and field distance runner, Andrew Paresa is not afraid to go the extra mile. In 2023, he supported his team at the Boys Track and Field Championship as well as the Boys Cross Country Championship.\n\nAndrew’s dedication extends to the classroom and his extracurricular activities. He served as secretary for the National Honor Society, taking charge of the organizational structure of meetings and events. He was a John A. Burns School of Medicine Neighbor Island Medical Scholar and a College Board Advanced Placement Scholar with Distinction. Andrew also served as vice chairperson of the Hawaii State Student Council, representing 175,000 Hawaii Department of Education students. “As Hawaii vice chairperson, my main goal is to help all students reach their full potential.”\n\nAndrew aspires to become a physician to make a difference in people’s lives, particularly in underserved areas. He says, “I want to help revolutionize rural health care, especially in Hilo. It’s been a goal of mine ever since I realized the impact physicians make in the lives of their patients.”\n\nThis fall, Andrew will attend the University of Southern California to get his undergraduate degree in biochemistry, then plans to return to Hawaii to continue his education at the University of Hawaii John A. Burns School of Medicine.\n\nSydney Endo\n\nPunahou School\n\nA talented soccer player and team captain, Sydney Endo dedicated herself to her school’s junior varsity and varsity soccer teams. She also committed her talents to the track team until a knee injury sidelined her, requiring surgery. Despite this setback, she refused to be deterred. She says, “Despite all of the challenges, I recovered well and made a lot of progress in physical therapy that I’m very proud of.”\n\nHer perseverance is also evident in the classroom. Sydney was a member of the National Honor Society and successfully tackled Advanced Placement classes while consistently earning top marks in her coursework.\n\nSydney’s strong work ethic extends to her volunteer work. Her most notable experience was at The Queen’s Medical Center, where she worked in the intensive care unit, supporting a team of medical professionals. There, Sydney discovered her aspiration for nursing. Her first-hand experience working with patients and their families showed her how rewarding it could be to care for others. This experience resonated deeply with her Filipino heritage where “everyone is treated as an extended family member.” She adds, “This commitment to others, coupled with the observations I made while volunteering, has inspired me to become a nurse.”\n\nHer volunteer experience at a senior home for people with advanced dementia strengthened Sydney's dream of becoming a nurse in her community. This conviction led her to choose Seattle University, where she will be majoring in nursing starting this fall. After graduation, Sydney hopes to work in the field of anesthesiology.\n\nKylee Hamamoto\n\nPunahou School\n\nKylee Hamamoto is a track star and team player. For her determination and teamwork, Kylee was nominated and voted Most Inspirational Player by her teammates and coaches. She also served as a board member and athlete representative for the Spartan Track Club, Hawaii’s fastest growing track and field club, where she was also a two-time USA track and field Junior Olympics Qualifier, placing in the top eight in Hawaii.\n\nOff the track, Kylee completed 10 Advanced Placement classes while serving as the highest-ranking Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) female cadet in her school’s battalion. Beyond the Punahou campus, Kylee was the youngest student researcher and presenter at the University of Hawaii West Oahu’s 2023 Aha Hoolokahi Native Hawaiian Health and Well Being Summit. There, she was able to formulate and research her topic on community outreach and empowerment programs.\n\nKylee is the founder and executive director of WeGo!, Hawaii’s largest youth-led pro bono social entrepreneurship enterprise, which has reached over 20,000 young women and supported more than 50 student ventures. WeGo! has reached female youths across various languages, socioeconomic statuses, and ethnicities, while also successfully launching a scholarship fund with thousands of dollars to provide facilitated financial support to low-income members. Her organization stands by its mission to create cyclical community impact and leadership through female innovation. Kylee also hosts and interviews female professionals for the WeGo! podcast, “Where do WeGo?”\n\nKylee will be attending Yale University where she plans to study women’s, gender, and sexuality studies on a pre-law track. “I hope to continue my work with WeGo! and support youth and social entrepreneurship here at home. I aspire to never be ‘pau hana’ or finished working, remaining dedicated to meaningful service and connections.”\n\nDiyora Kamilova\n\nIolani School\n\nWhen doctors advised her to give up wrestling and cross country because of arthritis, Diyora Kamilova faced the difficult reality of giving up her athletic pursuits. She decided to give sports her all for as long as she could. “I am proud of my perseverance and dedication to both sports,” she says. “Even when the pain in my joints was unbearable, I showed up to the track or weight room and pushed myself to the best of my abilities.”\n\nDiyora was a member of the Cum Laude Society and a nationals qualifier for speech and debate. She embraced her love for public speaking, bringing awareness to discrimination against Central Asians and advocating for her home country of Uzbekistan, while empowering others. As co-captain of the speech and debate team, she inspired her peers to succeed by demonstrating leadership and fostering a culture of excellence.\n\nThrough her volunteer experience at a Kaiser Permanente clinic, Diyora learned how impactful a caring physician can be. She is passionate about helping people, including those who are neurodiverse. Reflecting on her family’s experience, she emphasizes, “When my brother was diagnosed with autism, I realized how important health care is for the neurodivergent community.”\n\nThis fall, Diyora will attend Amherst College in Massachusetts, where she’ll major in neuroscience. She hopes to become a pediatric neurologist that specializes in neurodevelopment disorders.\n\nElle Mizue\n\nIolani School\n\n“I never expected to discover my life motto and goals sitting in a chain sandwich restaurant,” Elle Mizue says. “But Jersey Mike’s motto is to be ‘A Sub Above’ in everything you do.” That motto pushed her to do her best, particularly in wrestling and judo. She spent three years on both teams, setting her goals high until she became the wrestling state champion and two-time Interscholastic League of Honolulu champion, and placed twice in the state in judo.\n\nElle also applied that do-your-best mentality to her schoolwork. Her strong work ethic in academics paid off when she became a National Merit finalist in 2023, placing her among the highest-scoring students in the nation. As an Advanced Placement scholar, Elle received top marks on all her exams, and was a member of Iolani School’s Cum Laude Society.\n\nUnderstanding the value of hard work, Elle volunteered at the Salt Lake Judo Club, where she helped beginners and young children learn and develop their skills. She was also a tutor at the Iolani Writing Center, helping students and training new tutors, while also organizing school conferences as the Hawaii Model United Nations League chief of staff.\n\nElle plans to apply the Jersey Mike’s motto to every aspect of her college career at Amherst College in Massachusetts. “My goal is to find a career I am passionate about that will service the world and my community,” she says. “Even though I don’t know exactly what I want to do, I do know that I want to do everything to the best of my ability.”\n\nTalen Koerte\n\nKauai High School\n\nFor 10 years, Talen Koerte competed for Swim Kauai Aquatics. The experience paid off. Throughout high school, Talen claimed the state champion title in the 200-meter backstroke and broke the Kauai Interscholastic Federation record in the 100-yard backstroke and 200 medley relay. Talen is inspired by the words of his great-grandfather, who used to say, “If you’re going to be a ditch digger, be the best ditch digger there ever was.”\n\nIn school, Talen ranked first out of 223 students based on grade point average, while committing his time to the Boy Scouts of America. As an Eagle Scout, he helped lead his troop as assistant senior patrol leader. “Being an Eagle Scout has been a pivotal accomplishment that provided valuable lessons in leadership, planning, and working effectively with diverse personalities,” he says.\n\nDuring his 10 years with the Boy Scouts, his most meaningful experiences were from his troop’s volunteer work honoring the gravestones of veterans on Veterans Day and Memorial Day. These experiences have motivated Talen to give back to his community. He says, “The values of scouting fuel my desire to return home after college and contribute to making Hawaii a better place.”\n\nTalen will attend California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, studying civil engineering. He hopes to use his degree to contribute to the betterment of Kauai and make a positive impact on the world around him.\n\nShyloh McCann\n\nKapaa High School\n\nA gifted athlete, Shyloh McCann dedicated all four years of high school to her soccer team, making it to the state championship in both years of varsity soccer. When they qualified for the semi-finals in her junior year and the quarterfinals during her senior year, she was ecstatic and knew that her team’s dedication and hard work had paid off.\n\nShyloh will be graduating as valedictorian and looks forward to attending college. She believes that helping her community is about taking action. She worked with the Kauai Christian Fellowship to deliver food to people in need during the pandemic as well as when the Hanalei bridge closed due to flooding. She also helped with community outreach events through the Hanalei Initiative, a community and environmental needs nonprofit.\n\nAfter college, Shyloh aspires to establish a nonprofit in Hawaii to support youth affected by drug addiction in their families. The organization will provide a range of services tailored to meet their unique needs, including counseling, mentorship, educational support, and recreational activities. “By creating a safe and supportive environment, I hope to empower youth to overcome adversity, build resilience, and realize their full potential,” she says.\n\nIn the fall, Shyloh will attend the University of California, Los Angeles, where she’ll major in business economics. “By combining my passion for social justice with my academic pursuits and practical skills, I am confident in my ability to make a meaningful and lasting impact on the lives of individuals and families in Hawaii.”\n\nMadison Strand\n\nKing Kekaulike High School\n\nFrom competing in cross country and swimming, to diving and soccer, Madison Strand has always strived for excellence. Each season, she dedicated herself to every team she was a part of. She says, “More than anything, I am proud for getting involved and dedicating myself to my teams and my sports.”\n\nMadison excelled in academics as well. She maintained straight A’s while attending classes at the University of Hawaii Maui College for dual credits. She was also the president of the Debate Club, which started an annual schoolwide spring debate where all grades can compete.\n\nMadison’s most memorable volunteer experience was with Becca’s Closet Maui, a nonprofit organization that provides free prom and formal dresses to young girls. When the Maui wildfires devastated West Maui, the smoke damage impacted their inventory of dresses, shoes, and accessories. With the help of the owners and founders of Becca’s Closet, Madison reached out to as many brands, companies, and organizations as possible for donations, accepting about 2,000 dresses and making prom more accessible to Maui students.\n\nMadison will attend the University of Portland. She hopes to return to Hawaii to pursue a career in nursing. “Being a part of this community means having goals that are larger than myself,” she says. “It’s important for me to come back and help to improve what we have here in Hawaii.”\n\nJasmyn Yoshikawa\n\nBaldwin High School\n\nJasmyn Yoshikawa is a softball all-star. She says that being part of the two-time reigning MIL softball championship team and receiving recognition as first and second team all-star was one of her proudest athletic accomplishments. “I am thankful for all my coaches, trainers, and teachers who made it possible for me to be successful in school while playing the sport that I love,” she says.\n\nNamed on the principal’s list every year, Jasmyn excels in the classroom.
