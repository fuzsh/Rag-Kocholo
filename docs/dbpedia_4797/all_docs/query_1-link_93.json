        "text": "Nicknamed the “Garden Isle,” Kauai is beloved for its 550 square miles of lush tropical vegetation and pristine beaches; its wild terrain made it an apt filming location for the likes of “Lord of the Flies,” “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” and the Jurassic Park franchise. While still beautiful and rustic, more recently Kauai has seen a rise in posh new hotels, including the stunning 1 Hotel Hanalei Bay.\n\nReady to plan your next trip to Kauai? Read on to discover the best hotels and resorts in the region, from opulent five-star lodgings to budget-friendlier rooms, plus plenty of choices for residential-style stays with room for larger groups. As a travel journalist who has explored all over Hawaii for work and leisure many times over the last 15 years, I curated this list with expert recommendations from Travel + Leisure editors, contributors, and readers, along with winners from our World’s Best Awards.\n\nGrand Hyatt Kauai Resort & Spa\n\nAlso available to book at Expedia.com\n\nWhat We Like\n\nThis expansive resort is packed with amenities for families, including a pool with the longest resort waterslide in the state.\n\nWhat to Consider\n\nExpect to do some walking at this spread-out resort, as it’s situated on 50 acres.\n\nLocated on the South Shore, this resort sprawls over 50 acres, offering lush gardens and pools that are the stuff of dreams for families: one is tricked out with four waterslides — including the longest resort waterslide in Hawaii at 150 feet. (Fear not, child-free travelers: there’s also a quiet adults-only pool.)\n\nAdditionally, there’s a 1.5-acre saltwater lagoon that offers a sandy beach complete with swim-out islands. On-site are championship golf and the full-service Anara Spa, a grand 45,000-square-foot space that includes a 24-hour fitness center, open-air yoga studio, and dry and steam saunas. Tidepools restaurant offers fine dining under thatched-roof bungalows perched above a koi-filled lagoon at the base of a waterfall.\n\nThe Details:\n\nLocation: Koloa\n\nDistance From Airport: 16 miles\n\nAccessibility: Accessible guest rooms, restaurants, swimming pool\n\nLoyalty Programs: World of Hyatt\n\nParking: Self-parking included in the resort fee, or valet parking for $40 per day\n\nResort Fee: Yes\n\nRates: From $960 per night\n\n1 Hotel Hanalei Bay\n\nAlso available to book at Expedia.com\n\nWhat We Like\n\nThis is the island’s posh new addition, with a focus on wellness and a next-level spa and fitness center.\n\nWhat to Consider\n\nBe prepared to splash out for rooms here, with starting rates in the four figures.\n\nOpened in 2023 on the site of the former St. Regis Princeville, 1 Hotel Hanalei Bay is an ultra-posh new entry onto Kauai’s hotel scene. The North Shore property situated on a legendary beach is all about biophilic design principles, with natural landscapes woven through low-impact structures that blend seamlessly into their cliffside environment. Streams and gardens dot the property, where there are 252 airy rooms, including 51 suites.\n\nThe 18,000-square-foot Bamford Wellness Spa includes cryotherapy and hyperbaric chambers, infrared saunas with halotherapy, ice baths, a meditation pod, and a salt pod flotation chamber. And the 10,000 square-foot Anatomy fitness center is an open-air oceanfront environment with indoor and outdoor yoga spaces. Among the many dining options is the signature 1 Kitchen, with a plant-driven menu and one of the island’s largest wine lists.\n\nThe Details:\n\nDistance From Airport: 29 miles\n\nAccessibility: Accessible rooms, restaurants, bars, and restrooms, braille signage, plus an all-terrain beach wheelchair available for guests who need it.\n\nLoyalty Programs: Mission by 1 Hotels\n\nParking: Valet with $50 charge plus tax per night\n\nResort Fee: Yes\n\nRates: From $1,200 per night\n\n“When it comes to setting, this was one of the most stunning hotels I've stayed in. You can't beat its position on beautiful Hanalei Bay, overlooking Makana Mountain and the start of the Na Pali Coast. It's a wellness-focused hotel, and the spa, gym, and wellness programming are top notch. (But that doesn't mean you can't indulge in some Mai Tais; we even learned a recipe we now use at home.) 1 Hotel Hanalei Bay is extremely romantic — you'll wake up to rainbows most mornings — and it's where my fiancé and I chose to celebrate our engagement. Still, I think it could be just as ideal for a girls' getaway.”\n\n–Nina Ruggiero, Senior Editorial Director\n\nKo’a Kea Resort on Po’ipu Beach\n\nAlso available to book at Hotels.com\n\nWhat We Like\n\nThis resort offers the island’s closest hotel accommodations to the water, sitting on stunning Poipu Beach.\n\nWhat to Consider\n\nThe pool is on the smaller side, and the restaurant closes early.\n\nLocated on the sunny South Shore, this 121-room boutique resort with unobstructed views sits on Poipu Beach, a stretch of golden sand and sea known for top-notch snorkeling, diving, and surfing. Rooms and suites were renovated in 2022, and all feature balconies or private lanais. The resort offers direct beach access; it’s the closest resort to the beach on the island.\n\nOn-site is the full-service restaurant, Red Salt, now offering the weekly dinner Pa’ina series that gathers 14 guests at a time for a golden-hour meal with chef Noelani Planas. The property now also offers cabana dinners: six-course meals in an oceanfront cabana with front-row seats of Poipu Beach. There’s also a poolside bar and grill featuring Hawaiian dishes, plus a full-service spa with five treatment rooms, a couples suite, and two outdoor spa cabanas. The property also features an expansive oceanfront lawn and fire pits. In partnership with Envoy, you can reserve a private Tesla during your stay to explore the island. Ko’a Kea earned a place on our World’s Best Awards list in 2023.\n\nThe Details:\n\nLocation: Koloa\n\nDistance From Airport: 15 miles\n\nAccessibility: Accessible rooms available.\n\nLoyalty Programs: Stay Golden\n\nParking: Yes, $35 per night plus tax per vehicle\n\nResort Fee: Yes\n\nRates: From $494 per night\n\nTimbers Kauai – Ocean Club & Residences\n\nAlso available to book at Tripadvisor.com\n\nWhat We Like\n\nResidential-style accommodations all have multiple bedrooms, lanais, and sea views.\n\nWhat to Consider\n\nA convenient location near the airport also means airplane noise under the flight path.\n\nThis property occupies prime oceanfront location within the 450-acre Hōkūala resort, and is surrounded by idyllic walking and biking trails. The two- to four-bedroom residences and townhomes each offer at least three private lanais as well as ocean views. Here, there is the Jack Nicklaus Ocean Course, two-tiered infinity pool, fitness center with group classes, lagoons, beach access, and oceanfront dining. There’s also a kids club available. Timbers scored a spot in our World’s Best Awards in 2022.\n\nThe Details:\n\nLocation: Lihue\n\nDistance From Airport: 3 miles\n\nAccessibility: Accessible parking, rooms, and elevator for upper floors.\n\nParking: Free valet parking\n\nResort Fee: No\n\nRates: From $1,895 per night\n\nThe Lodge at Kukui’ula\n\nAlso available to book at Hotels.com\n\nWhat We Like\n\nThis property offers a wide range of lodging sizes and full access to the suite of amenities offered by the Club at Kukui'ula — golf, spa, dining, pools, tennis, and more.\n\nWhat to Consider\n\nServices here are focused more on club members than hotel guests.\n\nLocated on the sunny South Shore, this resort community offers exclusive access to The Club at Kukui'ula through its home rentals. Luxury residential accommodations located at the entrance to the club offer indoor-outdoor island living, with options for cottages, bungalows, and villas, offering one-, two-, three- and four-bedroom options. Each spacious home has a gourmet kitchen, dining area, roomy lanai, and private outdoor garden showers. They’re all walking distance from the club and its services.\n\nThe Details:\n\nLocation: Koloa\n\nDistance From Airport: 11 miles\n\nAccessibility: Accessible rooms and common areas\n\nParking: Yes, included with resort fee\n\nResort Fee: Yes\n\nRates: From $1,200 per night\n\nKauai Shores\n\nAlso available to book at Tripadvisor.com\n\nWhat We Like\n\nThis hotel offers an uncommonly budget-friendly option, with high value for the price and bike rentals included with the resort fee.\n\nWhat to Consider\n\nWhile colorful and cheerful, rooms may feel dated.\n\nThis hotel offers a knockout beachfront location, offering guests direct access to the peaceful Royal Coconut Coast. Although the hotel is far more budget-friendly than most on our list, its rooms are well maintained with retro-inspired design tinges, and feature modern amenities, including flat-screen TVs, high-speed Wi-Fi, air conditioning, and open-air lanais. The large windows offer views of the lush tropical gardens, pool, mountains, and sea. Complete the experience with beachside yoga and dining at Lava Lava Beach Club. Bike rentals are included with the resort fee.\n\nThe Details:\n\nLocation: Kapa’a\n\nDistance From Airport: 7 miles\n\nAccessibility: Accessible rooms, common areas, signage, on-site parking, registration desk, trained staff\n\nParking: Yes, included with resort fee\n\nResort Fee: Yes\n\nRates: From $238 per night\n\nThe Westin Princeville Ocean Resort Villas\n\nAlso available to book at Hotels.com\n\nWhat We Like\n\nThe largest villa accommodations here sleep eight adults with residential-style amenities.\n\nWhat to Consider\n\nThe cliffside location means no direct beach access.\n\nThis family-friendly cliffside vacation ownership resort is near Anini Beach and a short drive from Hanalei Bay. Dining options include the Princeville Bistro or Nanea Bar & Grill. There’s a 24-hour fitness studio as well as outdoor pools overlooking the ocean. Each residential-style villa here includes a furnished lanai, living and dining areas, a fully equipped kitchen, washer and dryer, and sofa bed, so they’re ideal for groups traveling together. Floorplans range from studio accommodations to two bedrooms up to 1,300-plus square feet, with room for as many as eight adults.\n\nThe Details:\n\nLocation: Princeville\n\nDistance From Airport: 25 miles\n\nAccessibility: Accessible guest rooms, on-site parking, elevators, and swimming pools. Service animals welcome.\n\nLoyalty Programs: Marriott Bonvoy\n\nParking: Yes, $25 per day\n\nResort Fee: No\n\nRates: From $438 per night\n\nMarriott Kauai Lagoons - Kalanipu’u\n\nAlso available to book at Hotels.com\n\nWhat We Like\n\nThis property offers lodgings in two- and three-bedroom villas, so it’s perfect for group or family travel.\n\nWhat to Consider\n\nGiven the residential format, there isn’t a full suite of amenities on-site; there are no food or beverage outlets.\n\nMarriott's Kauai Lagoons overlooks the deep blue sea surrounded by sparkling lagoons and beautiful coastline along the east shore. The property offers spacious villa vacation rentals, just right for groups or multigenerational family travel. There’s a two-level pool, whirlpool spa, and fitness center offering group fitness classes. Two- or three-bedroom vacation rentals have ocean views, separate living spaces, sofa beds, and full kitchens plus spacious balconies. From the resort, it’s easy to access nearby island attractions such as Fern Grotto, Huleia National Wildlife Refuge, and Opaeka'a Falls.\n\nThe Details:\n\nLocation: Lihue\n\nDistance From Airport: Less than one mile\n\nAccessibility: Accessible on-site parking, elevators, and swimming pools. Service animals welcome.\n\nLoyalty Programs: Marriott Bonvoy\n\nParking: Yes at $25 per day\n\nResort Fee: No\n\nRates: From $577 per night\n\nSheraton Kauai Coconut Beach Resort\n\nAlso available to book at Tripadvisor.com\n\nWhat We Like\n\nThe hotel is conveniently located near the airport and close to drug and grocery stores, which is particularly useful for families traveling with kids.\n\nWhat to Consider\n\nThe rocky beach doesn’t make for ideal swimming.\n\nLocated on Kauai’s eastern coast, this family-friendly resort is situated in the cute and eclectic town of Kapa'a, and is centrally located with easy access to the airport and nearby adventures (such as Smith's Tropical Paradise, and Wailua Falls), with 360-degree views of the island's natural beauty. The property features an infinity pool with separate sides for children and adults. Plus, there’s on-site dining at The Crooked Surf, Moa Moa, and Luau Ka Hikina. Rooms boast mini fridges and private lanais.\n\nThe Details:\n\nLocation: Kapa’a\n\nDistance From Airport: 7 miles\n\nAccessibility: Accessible on-site parking, elevators, rooms, service animals welcome\n\nLoyalty Programs: Marriott Bonvoy\n\nParking: Free on-site parking or valet is available for $20 per day\n\nResort Fee: Yes\n\nRates: From $382 per night\n\nThe Royal Sonesta Kauai Resort\n\nAlso available to book at Tripadvisor.com\n\nWhat We Like\n\nThis resort has an enormous all-ages-friendly pool, an accessible starting price point, and is conveniently located near the airport.\n\nWhat to Consider\n\nHospitality and housekeeping services may be spotty.\n\nThis beachfront resort is conveniently located merely two miles from Lihue Airport, so it’s easy to get situated and start enjoying your trip right away. Rooms feature views of the ocean, gardens, or pool. On-site are four restaurants, a spa, salon, and fitness center, and the largest one-level pool in Hawaii: a sweeping round blue expanse in the center of the property with the hotel buildings arranged around it. The property offers direct access to Kalapaki Beach, and is situated near nature reserves including Kalepa Mountain Forest Reserve and the Ahukini Recreation Pier State Park.\n\nThe Details:\n\nLocation: Lihue\n\nDistance From Airport: 2 miles\n\nAccessibility: Accessible rooms, signage, spa, pool, and more\n\nLoyalty Programs: Sonesta Travel Pass\n\nParking: Yes, $30 self-parking or $40 valet per night\n\nResort Fee: Yes\n\nRates: From $319 per night\n\nKoloa Landing Resort at Poipu, Autograph Collection\n\nAlso available to book at Hotels.com\n\nWhat We Like\n\nThis resort offers some of the largest accommodations on the island, with villas up to four bedrooms. It also has a great pool complex.\n\nWhat to Consider\n\nThis is not a beachfront property.\n\nSituated on 25 acres of lush grounds, this property offers studios, one-, two-, three-, and four-bedroom villas ranging from 500 to 3,600 square feet. Studios have kitchenettes and full-size washer/dryers and the villas have full kitchens and private bathrooms for every bedroom. One of the largest single-level pools on Kauai, the main pool here comprises 350,000 gallons of water and features waterslides, an infinity edge, swim-through waterfalls and grotto, a kids’ splash pad, dancing water fountains, and more.\n\nThere’s also the Lagoon pool with an island, lagoon, basketball hoop, and fire pits. A smaller pool with waterfalls is for adults only. On property are the full-service Spa at Koloa Landing; the couple’s treatment rooms have a private lanai, rainfall shower heads and the island’s only Japanese Ofuro soaking tub. The hotel is just a short walk from the Shops at Kukui’ula Village.\n\nThe Details:\n\nLocation: Koloa\n\nDistance From Airport: 14 miles\n\nAccessibility: Accessible parking, elevators, pool, restaurants, rooms, and more. Service animals welcome.\n\nLoyalty Programs: Marriott Bonvoy\n\nParking: Yes, complimentary on-site self and valet parking.\n\nResort Fee: Yes\n\nRates: From $634 per night\n\nKnow Before You Go\n\nConsider renting a car\n\nKauai is one of the more remote Hawaiian islands, so the easiest way to get around is with your own car. Rideshare and taxis work too, but they can be expensive and not as plentiful as on the mainland. Some hotels run shuttles on a schedule, and there is also a public bus system.\n\nUnderstand the different regions of Kauai before booking accommodations\n\nDifferent regions of Kauai offer different experiences, so take this into account before booking and consider splitting your time between several accommodations if you want a varied experience. The main regions with accommodations are the North Shore (Princeville, Hanalei), east coast (more densely populated), and South Shore (home to family-friendly beaches and more affordable vacation lodgings).\n\nExpect precipitation\n\nKauai is generally warm and tropical year round, with substantial rain. The dry season runs from April to October, and the months between November and March are considered the wet months. December and January — popular months for travel from the mainland — see the most rain.\n\nHow We Chose These Hotels\n\nAlesandra Dubin is a travel and lifestyle journalist who has visited Hawaii for work and leisure many times over the last 15 years (most recently getting stuck in the state in January for days after the grounding of Alaska Airlines’ 737 Max 9 fleet).
