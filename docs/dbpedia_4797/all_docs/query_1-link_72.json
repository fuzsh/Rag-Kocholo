We were introduced to Mamas in 1982 and its become our favorite, not just because of the food and the location, but because of the staff who have become our special friends.\n\nCarol and Bill Eckhoff\n\nSuch a magical dining experience! First and foremost I would like to mention that the staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcome for our anniversary dinner. We were so glad to have celebrated at Mama's Fish House.\n\nSeeno S., Los Angeles, CA, June 2021\n\nDefinitely my favorite meal we had in Maui! I loved the Hawaiian decor and music and fresh tropical flowers. The little cove the restaurant is on was one of the most beautiful little slices of Maui coastline I've seen! We will definitely make coming to Mama's a tradition!\n\nEllie K., Fresno, CA, July 2021\n\n1 / 4"
