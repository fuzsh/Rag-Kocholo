        "text": "The character of a nation cannot be far from the kind of movie it produces, watches and rewards with accolades.\n\nOn New Year’s Day, I watched the movie Family Matters with my family and we enjoyed every bit of it. There was no dull moment. The film has depth. Everyone in the theater seemed to be in a perpetual anticipation of what will happen next, and how might the story end. There were a few laughs in between and sometimes tears in the eyes, and prick in the heart all throughout.\n\nI seldom appreciate a movie for its overall quality, but this one, for me, takes the awards if the awards were to be given based on correct criteria. Though, in fairness to the other Metro Manila Film Festival entries, I haven’t seen any one of them. Having said that, it’s a huge, huge wonder why Family Matters didn’t win a single award except for Gatpuno Antonio J. Villegas Cultural Award, whatever that award means. Worse, its actors and actresses didn’t even get to be nominated when they performed so well and I thought they had very good chances of winning the best acting and best supporting acting awards as they are all natural before the camera, including the children.\n\nFamily Matters can be likened to the 1975 movie, One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. It was a light but poetic drama. There were no spectacular scenes and acting in the movie but it was aptly applauded in the Oscars as a runaway winner, having bagged 35 awards, including best picture, best actor, best actress and best director. The only difference is that Family Matters lost, and lost big, during the MMFF awards night.\n\nIt’s curious. Could there be manipulation/corruption or “drama” that happened “inside” among the festival’s organizers/people or it’s a mere case of myopia on the part of the judges?\n\nFamily Matters is an excellent light drama movie without being excessively dramatic to be entertaining and win hearts. It has profoundness in its story and script, and in the manner it was directed. Except for the part wherein the male members of the family were drinking, I rate it 10, or even 11.\n\nTrue to its sub-title, “Balik Pagmamahalan,” the movie is intentional in teaching moral lessons and imbibing good values to its viewers. It is a drama about a fairly big family to which every Filipino family today can relate. I liked all of it, but I especially liked the portions wherein scenes could have evolved to transform the movie into a heavy drama flick, but each one was prevented from making the heavy drama happen because everyone involved in the squabble/fracas knew how to forgive and forgive quickly, for nobody’s perfect. There was acceptance in the relationships. It’s a family that prays.\n\nThe movie is a rebuke to the children who are uncaring to their elderly parents, to the busy parents who are irresponsible, and to the modern youths who are addicted to gadgets. The plot’s heavy drama is left in the imagination of the viewers, with bated breath. Watch every scene well, listen intently to the words of the characters and fathom the message – and thus it is expected that one would leave the movie house a better child, a better father, a better mother, a better husband and wife and a better grandchild.\n\nThe words of Lolo Francisco (played by Noel Trinidad) rang a bell when he collected the phones and gadgets of every member of his entire family for a three-day special family bonding occasion: “In order to connect, you have to disconnect.”\n\nYou lost, Family Matters, but cheer up! You won big in much greater aspects/categories. And in the eyes of Heaven where there are no crooks, you are the real winner.\n\nCongratulations!"
