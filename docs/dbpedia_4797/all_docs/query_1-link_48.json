        "text": "Concho Valley Electric Cooperative, Inc.’s (CVEC, Inc.) project to extend middle mile broadband infrastructure to underserved areas of Tom Green and Coke counties is intended to accommodate the population growth that continued in rural Texas. This population influx is increasing the demand for fast, reliable broadband connectivity across the state. New and existing customers require more middle mile bandwidth to provide access to true broadband speeds as they rely on the internet to work from home, attend virtual classes, shop, participate in telehealth services, use next-gen 911 services, and in all the other ways a stable, fast internet connection has become a necessity to modern life. The existing middle-mile infrastructure is not meeting this demand in the area, providing substandard speeds, network congestion, and very little redundancy.\n\nThe project will develop the 208.9-mile County of Grafton middle-mile backbone through population centers by building new fiber optic cable to close gaps and leveraging existing infrastructure to reduce the cost of buildout. The backbone will be available for municipalities to tap into and run additional fiber optic cable through their municipalities to reach the last mile. The network will provide the electronics and optics necessary to provide service at identified municipal/County anchor locations and will allow for future growth and expansion with minimal additional equipment. The non-municipal/County locations will be served through dark fiber access only, allowing ISPs to make their own investments within individual communities.\n\nThe project is composed of two elements, added middle mile fiber route miles, and upgrading electronics to support the increased network de-mand.\n\nThe first element, the incorporation of the new fiber route miles, will facilitate additional redundancy, resiliency, and survivability of the net-work. In addition, the added fiber routes will reduce latency for anchor institutions providing critical network services. The new route design for eastern North Dakota will be comprised of 4 additional network segments. These segments will be Bismarck, ND to Carrington, ND, Jamestown, ND to Carrington, ND, Devils Lake, ND to Carrington, ND and Fargo, ND to Carrington ND. This will create a fully meshed topol-ogy within the state. The western portion will also benefit by adding an additional network segment between Alexander, ND and Max, ND. The project will add a total of 612.99 leased fiber route miles to DCN’s mid-dle mile backbone infrastructure.\n\nSubrecipient BEK will be adding a total of 28.4 new construction fiber route miles to their middle mile backbone infrastructure. Subrecipient DCT will be adding a total of 233.2 new construction fiber route miles to their middle mile backbone infrastructure. A combined total of 874.59 fiber route miles will be added with the proposed project.\n\nThe second element, upgrading electronics to support the increased net-work demand, will ensure the network has the capacity that is in demand from anchor institutions enabling them to serve critical services to the citizens of North Dakota.\n\nThe purpose of the project is to enhance ENMR Telephone Cooperative's existing network's infrastructure by creating alternate paths and increasing resiliency and bandwidth with upgrades and new fiber routes. It includes the construction of five new fiber segments, one of which completes a fiber ring linking Kermit, Texas to Jal, New Mexico in the southern edge of the middle mile network. The other four new fiber segments will create alternative diverse paths connecting Santa Fe and Albuquerque, New Mexico. The applicant's existing wholesale customers will immediately benefit from the expanded capacity and increased reliability. The applicant's objectives for the proposed project include assurance that last mile providers have access to affordable middle mile transport to the internet.\n\nHawaiian Telcom, Inc is proposing to build an economically and environmentally sustainable, open access middle mile infrastructure that will benefit unserved and underserved communities and improve the resiliency of existing broadband services in the state of Hawaii. Project URGENT consists of 15 new terrestrial and undersea routes and over 600 kilometers of fiber. The digital divide is particularly prevalent in Hawaii communities that are unserved or underserved especially on islands like Maui, Molokai, Kauai, and Hawaii island, rural Oahu communities - Waianae, Nanakuli, North Shore, and Hawaiian Home Lands, which are \"tribal\" lands set aside for homesteads for native Hawaiians having at least 50% Hawaiian blood. These areas are particularly vulnerable, and Hawaii is ranked amongst the worst states in the nation in terrestrial broadband coverage (54%) and amongst the slowest average download speeds. Project URGENT also addresses climate-related risks such as coastal flooding and erosion and the impact from natural disasters such as volcanic eruptions and fires, tsunamis, and hurricanes.\n\nThe Appalachian Ohio Middle Mile Expansion project focuses on key gaps in Appalachian Ohio's open middle mile infrastructure. Building upon NTIA's previous investments in the Ohio Middle Mile Consortium (OMMC), the applicant's design reaches two counties currently lacking any open middle mile, establishes new POPs in three counties, and densifies the existing network in six additional counties. The design closes multiple rings, increases reliability and resiliency for the entire service area, and creates additional interconnection points among the original OMMC members. The proposed 239 miles of new fiber (primarily aerial) (minimum of 288 strands) will pass within 1,000 feet of 16,257 households, 525 Community Anchor Institutions, and 2,114 businesses. The project will provide dark fiber and lit capacity to ISPs, local telcos, and community institutions (schools, healthcare facilities, local government facilities) over the 239 new miles as well as over 711 existing miles of fiber. As a community benefit, the applicant intends to provide Indefeasible Rights to Use (IRUs) on the network to the K-12 Information Technology Centers (ITCs) serving school districts in the region (OME-RESA and META Solutions), the Southern Ohio Health Care Network (a high-speed fiber network that serves over 350+ health care facilities in 40 Ohio counties), and OARnet (the state's academic fiber network).\n\nThe State of Kansas Departments of Commerce (the applicant) and Transportation (KDOT) (project partner) are working together with private and non-profit partners to create a 682-mile open-access middle-mile fiber optic and network, with plans to connect multiple new internet exchange points throughout the State. The purpose of the project is to connect to multiple new internet points throughout the State and offer dark fiber for last-mile service providers that have the capabilities to light the fiber and need the scalability associated with dark fiber access. The proposed route will provide lit service access to support smaller ISPs as well as other providers with smaller project scopes that prefer lit services to deploying their own fiber or electronics. This will enable last mile providers with a range of objectives to connect to this network and access end users.\n\nThe proposed network will support the needs of last-mile service providers, increase capabilities for anchor institutions, enable connections to unserved and underserved households, and increase competition in local markets, thereby creating more affordable service options.\n\nAccording to the applicant the project proposes a cost-effective approach of utilizing existing and planned communication networks to provide connectivity for ISPs to deliver broadband to end users in need. The project offers an opportunity to leverage the applicant’s energy infrastructure management network to provide a high quality, cost-effective middle mile fiber routes. In addition to building new routes to connect its remaining infrastructure and making that fiber available for middle mile broadband, the applicant will be offering unused capacity on its existing fiber network (24 strands) as new open access middle mile. Six segments comprising 775 miles of new build will provide 72 fiber strands for dark fiber leasing. Opening 1,365 miles of applicant-owned fiber to public access will provide 24 strands to facilitate last mile connections. The design also supports efficient connections to unserved and underserved anchor institutions. The resulting network will enable fiber connections that can provide 1 Gbps symmetrical across a wide area of Iowa.\n\nThis project will extend middle mile infrastructure to unserved and underserved areas and promote broadband connection resiliency through the creation of alternative network connection paths. It will expand from Missouri into the state of Oklahoma and will increase redundancy and resiliency as well as increasing competition in this rural area. This project it will also reduce costs and spur the more rapid deployment of last mile services in rural areas. In particular, these routes have the potential to grow and strengthen fixed wireless and cellular connectivity, including advancements in new wireless technologies which are not supported by other means than fiber.\n\nThe Infrastructure for Michigan's Peninsulas and Critical Crossings (IMPACC) includes two routes crossing Michigan's lakes, and unserved counties and towns to bring middle mile infrastructure into rural counties serving over 35,000 homes in need of broadband internet connectivity. Placing approximately 535 route miles of new middle mile fiber connecting the Upper Peninsula of Michigan to the lower with a redundant path to create connectivity options for western Michigan to peering points in Chicago. Improving connectivity and redundancy for unserved and underserved areas of the UP and western Michigan. Route #1: The undersea fiber connection across Lake Michigan to Chicago from Benton Harbor and St. Joseph, MI., creates a shorter, redundant, and more reliable middle mile route to Chicago. Extending through un/underserved areas of southwest rural Michigan to an Inter-Exchange Carrier (IXC) facility in Byron Center, MI. Route #2 begins in Gulliver in the Upper Peninsula, travels undersea and makes landfall at Beaver Island then continues undersea to Charlevoix, MI. After landfall in Charlevoix, the route continues south and east through sections of unserved towns to reach an IXC point in Gaylord.\n\nActivities to be performed: The project will place 535 route miles of new middle mile fiber that will integrate into existing networks to provide middle mile access and ultimately serve end users throughout the state of Michigan. The project will use fiber to build new middle mile network through unserved and underserved communities with a commitment to open access and carrier neutral non-discriminatory interconnect. The period of performance is expected to be 5 years.\n\nThe purpose of the Pima County Regional Middle Mile Fiber Optic Ring is to ensure that affordable, reliable and accessible high-speed broadband services can be provided to as many communities, county and local facilities, anchor institutions and recreational areas as possible. The proposed project creates a 134-mile contiguous open access fiber network ring. The infrastructure will be made available to all viable internet service providers (ISPs) and other government entities to lease, share or swap resources. This future proof design has the capacity to accommodate expansive growth in the region. The network is designed in a ring surrounding the outer area of greater Tucson, Arizona and surrounding rural communities. The proposed middle mile network path connects to 4 Central Office (CO) facilities. These four Tier 1 connections provide a link to the backbone of the public internet with physical interconnections for the exchange of traffic. The proposed middle mile infrastructure will reduce the cost for last mile providers to connect unserved and underserved communities by providing a neutral network that last mile providers can access in a non-discriminatory open access model.\n\nThe QSH Nome to Homer Express Route, serves dual purposes: 1. It extends the existing network, and completes a ring, connecting previously constructed network Fairbanks to Nome, via Prudhoe Bay, Point Hope, to this project's route from Nome to Homer, and leased facility from Homer to Fairbanks, resulting in a redundant survivable ring connection to various cable systems toward the lower 48; and 2. it provides connectivity along the newly constructed route at Emmonak, Naknek, King Salmon, Igiugig, and Homer. 55% of the project area is measured as unserved. The households below 150% of poverty level (excluding Fairbanks, Kenai Penisula reached by leased network) is 24%. Connecting these communities with a fiber network will enable last mile providers to offer unrestricted connectivity to end users, enabling distance learning, telehealth options and economic development in traditionally remote and isolated areas.\n\nThe applicant proposes to build and operate the Connect Alabama Network for 677.1 route miles: 411.5 route miles for access to unserved area, 29.8 route miles for access to underserved areas, and 235.8 route miles for connectivity to four Internet peering points. The entire proposed route will be buried fiber in conduit of at least 144 count fiber. The applicant's Connect Alabama network aligns well with NTIA's Middle Mile Program's priorities: providing symmetrical 1 Gig services to anchor institutions within 1000 feet of the route while also offering fiscally sustainable middle mile, non-discriminatory interconnection to last mile broadband providers, documented interest from 2 last mile providers, and benefiting national security interests for fiber broadband connectivity along the route. The Connect Alabama network affords redundancy (preventing a single point of failure), high reliability, and high-speed broadband throughout the 26 unserved/underserved Alabama counties it traverses and enables open access to last mile providers, electrical cooperatives, military facilities, and the Poarch Band of Creek Indians tribal headquarters along its path. The network proposes to support wholesale and retail broadband services throughout the life of the project.\n\nThe purpose of the Oregon, NorCal, Nevada middle mile project is to provide a middle mile fiber network (645 miles) that will serve rural areas that currently have inadequate broadband services. The project includes twenty-three (23) access points to provide ready access to the applicant's local ISP partners. The network has been designed to include access points to serve underserved and unserved areas in all three states. In addition to the fiber route, the applicant is also partnering with another service provider to construct middle mile infrastructure in the form of 180-foot towers that can host up to 4 last mile wireless ISPs that will provide fixed and mobile 5G wireless broadband. The cell tower infrastructure enables fixed wireless broadband as well as expanding mobile 5G broadband.\n\nThe purpose of this project proposal is to construct a new, 644-mile underground middle mile fiber route that would serve some of the most rural areas in Western Texas, stretching from Dallas to El Paso. It will facilitate broadband service to several unserved and underserved areas. The network has been designed to include access points that can serve 236 community anchor institutions. Additionally, a partner will construct nine 180-foot-tall towers along the proposed route. Each tower can host up to 4 wireless Internet Services Providers (ISPs) that can provide both mobile and fixed 5G wireless broadband service. Throughout the route, and through its local ISP partners and digital equity consultancies, the applicant plans to promote digital equity efforts to enable communities to harness their new broadband capabilities.\n\nThe purpose is to create new access points along the applicants 822-mile, five-state, underground existing middle mile fiber route, providing a highly resilient alternative to the aerial fiber used currently, which is subject to outages, to provide better service to unserved and underserved areas. The applicant identified 209 community anchor institutions that are located within 1 mile of the fiber route that could have access to the network. A portion of the funding will allow the project partner to construct 180-foot towers that will provide non-discriminatory access to up to four wireless ISPs to provide mobile and fixed broadband service within a 5-mile radius of each tower."
