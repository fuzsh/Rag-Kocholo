        "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio - Saturday is a historic day in Kentucky Derby history, in 14 different ways. The 142nd Derby in Louisville, Kentucky, also is the 14th to be run on May 7 since 1921, when it became a fixture on the first Saturday in May.\n\nViewing the Derby through the lens of May 7 offers a decade-by-decade slice of the great race's history.\n\nMay 7 is the day a supposed fix went wrong, an owner lost a bundle and a winning jockey lost a career.\n\nMay 7 is the day one of the most beloved Triple Crown champions began his historic run.\n\nMay 7 also is the day that great horse died.\n\nMay 7 is the day two of sport's best jockeys rode their first Derby winners - 17 years apart, and once against one another.\n\nAnd May 7 is a day of upsets, including one of the biggest betting paydays in horse racing history.\n\nPlease view the following slide show to see their stories, photos, videos and more:\n\nBy Tim Warsinskey, The Plain Dealer\n\nA view of the 1921 Kentucky Derby. (Library of Congress)\n\n1921, Behave Yourself\n\nIn 1921, Purdery was the heavy favorite, but the smart money was on Black Servant. Or, at least they thought they were smart. Overlooked by betters was the brown colt Behave Yourself, who was Black Servant’s stablemate and hardly his equal in any measure of the time. Both were owned by Col. E.R. Bradley and trained by Herbert “Derby Dick” Thompson, who both would go on to Derby fame.\n\nThe race was among the greatest in the Derby’s first 50 years, and the intrigue even better.\n\nBehave Yourself was closed out at the start was forced to go wide for over three-quarters of a mile, during which he gamely passed 11 competitors.\n\nA Plain Dealer wire story headlined “Kentucky nag is winner of Derby honors” described the end as “one of the most spectacular stretch drives that has ever graced a Derby finish.\n\n“C. Thompson, who used rare judgement in riding Behave Yourself, slipped through on the rail with his charge and then straightened out for the final run and was head to head with his stablemate,’’ the story continued. “The two pulled away from Prudery and the rest of the field and under hard punishment continued side by side and step for step down the stretch.\n\n“A deafening roar escaped the crowd as Behave Yourself stuck his nose in front of his stablemate at the sixteenth pole. Responding gamily at the urging of his rider, the winner very slowly gained until Black Servant’s nose was even with his heaving withers. The two continued to race in this position until they flashed under the wire, with Behave Yourself having a scant advantage of three-quarters of a length.’’\n\nBehave Yourself paid $19.30 to win on a $2 bet.\n\n1921: A fix or a hat?\n\nWhat happened to the supposedly superior Black Servant in the 1921 Derby? Theories abound, and most of them center around a reported fix gone wrong.\n\nAuthors Elliott Kalb and Mark Weinstein list the race in their book “The 30 Greatest Sports Conspiracy Theories of All Time” and write owner E.R. Bradley bet $250,000 on his horse, Black Servant, and that his other horse, Behave Yourself, was to stay out of the way. They write that among the theories reported at the time was that jockey Charles Thompson tried in vain to restrain Behave Yourself, but the horse would not cooperate; and that Thompson might have placed his own big side wager on his own horse.\n\n1921: 'Take back!'\n\nIn “Two Minutes to Glory,” authors Pamela K. Brodowski and Tom Philbin present another, oft-repeated story about the 1921 finish:\n\n“Then it happened; a spectator skipped his hat near Black Servant’s head (in the final seconds of the race), and for just a heartbeat the bolt pricked up his ears and lost stride. Thompson grabbed the moment and drove by Black Servant. . . Black Servant’s jockey, Lucien Lyke, knew Thompson wanted to win the race, but he wasn’t supposed to. He screamed above the thundering hoofbeats, ‘Take back, you (expletive)!’”\n\nBrodowski and Philbin also said grooms and stablehands that bet on Black Servant were furious and beat up Thompson in the dressing room after the race. Legend also has it that owner E.R. Bradley was so incensed that he saw to it that Thompson never rode another Derby again, and he didn’t.\n\nTrainer “Derby Dick” Thompson went on to win the Derby three more times (Bubbling Over, 1926; Burgoo King, 1932, and Brokers Tip, 1933). He is tied with Bob Baffert and D. Wayne Lucas for second-most Derby victories.\n\nChurchill Downs. (AP/Ed Reinke)\n\n1927, Whiskery\n\nWhiskery bested Osmand in the final sixteenth-mile and won by a head under jockey Linus “Pony” McAtee. Whiskery finished third at the Preakness. Whiskery was sold to stud after the season, but proved sterile and returned to the track as a gelding. In 70 races, he compiled a record of 14-16-8. McAtee also won the 1929 Derby.\n\nBurgoo King, winner of the Kentucky Derby, is shown in the Winners' Circle with his jockey, Eugene James, May 8, 1932, at Churchill Downs in Louisville. (AP Photo)\n\n1927, Burgoo King\n\nCol. E.R. Bradley – owner of 1921 winner Behave Yourself and the ill-fated Black Servant – is the all-time Derby leader with 28 entrants – all of which began with the letter B.\n\nBurgoo King was the third of Bradley’s four Derby winners and was ridden by 19-year-old Eugene James, who drowned two years later in Lake Michigan. Burgoo King retired to stud and died at Darby Dan Farm in Columbus in 1946.\n\nWatch Burgoo King win the Kentucky Derby\n\nJockey Eddie Arcaro, aboard his mount Larwin, poses in the winner's circle after his victory in the 64th Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs racetrack in Louisville, Ky., May 7, 1938. (AP Photo)\n\nLarwin, 1938\n\nLarwin, the only Kansas-bred Derby winner, is best remembered as the first of jockey Eddie Arcaro’s record five winning Derby horses. Arcaro, a Hall of Famer, won more classic races than any other jockey and won the Triple Crown twice. He guided Larwin to an early lead on the rail and kept him in the lead despite swerving to the middle of the track down the stretch.\n\nWatch Lawrin win 1938 Kentucky Derby\n\nTrainer Ben Jones, left, holds Calumet Farm's Ponder in the winner's circle at Churchill Downs, Louisville on May 7, 1949, after the three-year-old colt by Pensive, with Jockey Steve Brooks up, upset the field by winning the 75th running of the Kentucky Derby. (AP Photo)\n\n1949, Ponder\n\nRidden by Hall of Famer Steve Brooks, Ponder was last at the midway point of the race and beat stablemate Capot, who later won the Preakness and Belmont. The Derby win was the fourth for trainer Ben Jones, tying him for the most at the time with “Derby Dick” Thompson. Ponder was third at the Preakness and went on to beat Citation at the 1950 San Antonio. Ponder, the son of 1944 winner Pensive, sired 1956 Derby champion Needles. Ponder died in 1958.\n\nWatch Ponder win 1949 Kentucky Derby\n\nWillie Shoemaker waves his cap from Swaps as he stands in winner's circle after capturing Kentucky Derby May 7, 1955. (AP Photo)\n\n1955, Swaps\n\nThe “California Comet” was a descendant of both Man ‘o War and War Admiral and frequently appears on lists of greatest thoroughbreds of all time. Swaps carried Bill Shoemaker to the first of four Derby victories in a field that included 2-year-old champion Nashua, ridden by five-time Derby champ Eddie Arcaro. Swaps closed strong to finish 1½ lengths ahead of Nashua in 2:01.80. He returned to California instead of running the Preakness and won Hollywood Park’s Will Rogers.\n\nSwaps was Horse of the Year in 1950. Swaps is one of four horses buried at the Kentucky Derby Museum adjacent to Churchill Downs. The others are Derby winners Brokers Tip (1933), Carry Back (1961) and Sunny's Halo (1983).\n\nWatch Swaps win 1955 Kentucky Derby\n\nVenetian Way and Jockey Bill Hartack are covered with roses after winning the 86th running of the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs, May 7, 1960.

(AP Photo)\n\n1960, Venetian Way\n\nVenetian Way took Hall of Famer Bill Hartack to the second of his record-tying five Derby wins. The Kentucky-bred chestnut sprinted to a 3½-length win over Belly Ache in 2:02.40. Venetian Way was fifth in a six-horse Preakness and second at the Belmont. He would win only one other race and died at age 7.\n\nWatch Venetian Way win 1960 Kentucky Derby\n\nThis photo shows Kauai King (8), Advocator (3) and Blue Skyer (12), left, racing down home stretch at Churchill Downs during the Kentucky Derby in Louisville, Ky., on May 7, 1966. The horses finished in that order. (AP Photo)\n\n1966, Kauai King\n\nKauai King sprinted to the fastest mile in Derby history (1:35), a mark that stood for 23 years, and won wire-to-wire in 2:02. He beat Advocator by a half-length. Kauai King won the Preakness – his fourth straight victory – but the streak ended with a fourth-place finish at the Belmont. He was injured the following year, retired to stud and died in Japan in 1989.\n\nWatch Kauai King win 1966 Kentucky Derby\n\nSeattle Slew, with Jean Cruguet in the irons, wears the traditional blanket of roses in the Winner's Circle at Churchill Downs in Louisville KY., Saturday, May 7,1977.

(AP Photo)\n\n1977, Seattle Slew\n\nConsidered among the five or 10 greatest horses of all time, Seattle Slew was owner Mickey and Karen Taylor’s $17,500 yearling bargain who went on to become the 10th Triple Crown champion.\n\nHe also was the only Triple Crown champion purchased at a public auction and the first who was unbeaten in his career at the time.\n\nSeattle Slew was gangly as a yearling, born with his right front foot turned out and was known as “Baby Huey” for his gangly gait early on. Soon, he would be called “The People’s Horse.’’\n\nUnder Jean Cruguet, he beat Run Dusty Run in the Derby by 1¾ lengths in 2:02.20. He went on to win the Preakness by 1½ and the Belmont in mud by four lengths. He survived a nearly fatal virus and won five starts in a year later, including a victory over Triple Crown winner Affirmed at Belmont’s Marlboro Cup.\n\nIn one of the last photos of Seattle Slew, the great champion looks on, Thursday, April 11, 2002, at Hill' n Dale farm, in Lexington, Ky. He died May 7, 2002, on the 25th anniversary of his Kentucky Derby victory.

He sired Derby and Belmont winner Swale, and Belmont and Breeders’ Cup Classic winner A.P. Indy.\n\nSeattle Slew died in his sleep the morning of May 7, 2002, at Hill 'n' Dale Farm in Lexington. It was 25 years to the day after his Derby triumph. He was 28, which is said to be in human equivalent years about 90 years old.\n\nSeattle Slew had been the only living Triple Crown winner. Affirmed, who won the Triple Crown the year after Seattle Slew in 1978, died at age 26 in 2001.\n\nAmerican Pharoah became the next Triple Crown winner in 2015.\n\nTom Wade stands with his wife, Kathy, as they view the statue of Triple Crown winner Seattle Slew prior to a memorial service for the horse Friday, July 19, 2002, in Lexington, Ky.

He was the last living Triple Crown winner.

Sunny’s Halo was the second Canadian-bred Derby winner.\n\nHis problematic shins and ankles forced trainer David Cross to a course that was somewhat ahead of his time, training Sunny’s Halo in a pool for horses and running him only twice before the Derby, including a win at the Arkansas Derby. He retired after the 1983 season and had a successful stud career. He was Texas's leading sire by lifetime progeny earnings ($26 million) at the time of his death in 2003, which was 20 years after his Derby win.\n\nHe is one of four horses buried at the Kentucky Derby Museum adjacent to Churchill Downs. The others are Derby winners Brokers Tip (1933), Swaps (1955) and Carry Back (1961).\n\nJockey Gary Stevens at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky., Saturday, April 26, 2014.

Wayne Lucas, jockey Gary Stevens and the massive filly Winning Colors were an unbeatable combination. Beating Forty Niner by a neck, Winning Colors became the third filly Derby champion. She finished third at the Preakness and was the last of six horses in the Belmont. She retired in 1989 and died in 2008.\n\nWatch Winning Colors win 1988 Kentucky Derby\n\nTrainer Nick Zito, right, and groom Ignatius Allen, wipe down Go For Gin after his workout May 6, 1994 in Louisville, Ky., the day before Go For Gin won the Kentucky Derby.

Then it rained – hard – on Holy Bull’s presumed parade.\n\nTorrential rains the night before gave the Derby track its first sloppy rating in nearly 40 years. Holy Bull started slow and never got up to speed. Go for Gin surged early and led by as many as four lengths. He finished two lengths ahead of Strodes Creek, giving trainer Nick Zito and jockey Chris McCarron each their second Derby wins.\n\nGo for Gin was second at both the Preakness and the Belmont and went on to a successful stud career, siring seven stakes winners, including Grade 1 winner Albert the Great. He retired from stud in 2011 and, at age 25, he is the second-oldest living Derby champion.\n\nWatch Go For Gin win 1994 Kentucky Derby\n\nGiacomo, left, with jockey Mike Smith up, wins the 131st Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs, in this May 7, 2005 in Louisville, Ky. (AP Photo/Al Behrman, File)\n\n2005, Giacomo\n\nThe most bizarre 1-2 finish in Derby history had 50-1 long shot Giacomo (2:02.75) narrowly beating another 50-1 long shot, Closing Argument. One of the early favorites, Afleet Alex, was third by a length and went on to win the Preakness and Belmont. Owner George Steinbrenner’s much ballyhooed 5-2 favorite Bellamy Road was a flop in seventh place.\n\nGiacomo paid $102.60 on a $2 bet, in the second-greatest upset in Kentucky Derby history (Donerail paid $184.90 in 1913).\n\nThe exacta ($9,814), trifecta ($133,134) and superfecta ($864,253) all smashed Derby records.\n\nTrainer John Shirreffs won his debut Derby and jockey Mike Smith won his first Derby in his 12th attempt. Giacomo was third at the Preakness and seventh at the Belmont Stakes.\n\nGiacomo is the most recent gray horse to win the Derby – and this year there are four grays, an unusually high number.\n\nHe is a stud horse in Oregon.\n\nWatch Giacomo 2005 Kentucky Derby upset\n\n2011, Animal Kingdom\n\nMore than the odds were stacked against Animal Kingdom. Jockey John Velasquez didn’t get the mount until the day before the Derby because of injuries. Animal Kingdom drew the 16 post position and went off at 21-1 odds.\n\nHe fell behind early, but zoomed past three horses down the stretch to win by nearly three lengths in what his first start on dirt.\n\nAnimal Kingdom was the Preakness runner-up and sixth at the Belmont, but went on to win the Dubai World Cup two years later. He is standing in stud in Lexington."
