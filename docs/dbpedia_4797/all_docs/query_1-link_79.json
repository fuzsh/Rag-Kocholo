        "text": "Liberty Island Wins the Shuka Sho and Crowned Triple Crown Champion\n\nOverwhelming favorite Liberty Island claimed this year’s Shuka Sho to sweep the Triple Crown races for fillies including the Oka Sho (Japanese 1000 Guineas, 1,600m) and the Yushun Himba (Japanese Oaks, 2,400m) held in spring. She is the seventh filly to dominate all fillies’ Triple Crown races following Mejiro Ramonu (1986), Still in Love (2003), Apapane (2010), Gentildonna (2012), Almond Eye (2018) and Daring Tact (2020). She also extended her G1-winning streak to four including last year’s Hanshin Juvenile Fillies (1,600m), which earned her the JRA Award’s Best Two-Year-Old Filly title. With this race, trainer Mitsumasa Nakauchida captured his eighth JRA-G1 victory following his Yushun Himba title with this filly, while jockey Yuga Kawada marked his 25th JRA-G1 win following the Sprinters Stakes with Mama Cocha two weeks earlier and also conquered all seven G1 races for three-year-olds. Starting this year, Japanese-bred horse that achieves the fillies’ Triple Crown title will receive a bonus of 100 million yen.\n\nLiberty Island broke smoothly and settled two-wide in good position behind the leaders, around seventh along the backstretch, and made headway 600 meters out while turning the last corners wide. After taking command around the 400-meter pole, the Duramente filly found another gear to exert a strong drive along the stretch and, although threatened by the fast-closing chase by Masked Diva before the wire, managed to hold off the Rulership filly by a length margin for her Triple Crown title.\n\n“I’m grateful that we were able to achieve the Triple Crown. She is a horse with great ability, so I placed top priority on letting her run comfortably and finding a good path for her. I was confident of her victory when we had an open space at the third corner. She has great potential, and her dreams for the future are wide open, but first of all, I would like to praise her for achieving the Triple Crown,” commented Yuga Kawada.\n\nThird pick Masked Diva broke sharply and eased back to settle around 13th. Though meeting traffic at the top of the stretch, the filly found an opening 300 meters out and dislodged a powerful late charge that timed the fastest last three furlongs to close in on the leader but was a length short at the wire to finish second.\n\nSecond pick Harper sat around fifth in front of the winner, angled out slightly turning the final corner and, while unable to keep up with the winner’s speed, managed to pass the tiring frontrunners 100 meters out but missed the runner-up spot before the wire for third.\n\nOther Horses:\n\n4th: (5) Duraâsat around 8th behind winner, passed one by one at stretch, nose short of 3rd place\n\n5th: (8) Moryanaâsaved ground around 14th, quickened between horses until 50m out\n\n6th: (3) Malaki Naiaâhugged rails around 7th, showed effort but never threatened\n\n7th: (18) Emuâbroke poorly, trailed in rear, launched 3rd fastest late kick, belatedly\n\n8th: (4) Kona Coastâset pace, showed tenacity until 100m out\n\n9th: (15) Hip Hop Soulâtraveled around 15th, circled wide, showed belated charge\n\n10th: (12) Doe Eyesâsettled 3-wide around 9th, lacked needed kick\n\n11th: (13) Ravelâtracked leaders around 3rd, remained in contention until 100m out\n\n12th: (11) Kita Wingâsat 2nd from rear, passed tired rivals\n\n13th: (9) Mississippi Tesoroâchased leader in 2nd, faded after 200m pole\n\n14th: (16) Pipiolaâran 4-wide around 9th, showed little at stretch\n\n15th: (10) Grand Bernadetteâpositioned around 15th, even paced\n\n16th: (1) Festes Bandâtracked leaders around 3rd on rails, met traffic 100m out, dropped back\n\n17th: (17) Soleil Vitaâraced around 5th outside winner, outrun after final corner\n\n18th: (14) Conch Shellâtraveled 3-wide around 13th, unable to reach contention\n\nTHE 28TH SHUKA SHO (G1)\n\n3-year-olds, Fillies, 2,000 meters (about 10 furlongs), turf, right-handed\n\nSunday, October 15, 2023Â Â Â Â Â Kyoto RacecourseÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â 11th RaceÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Post Time: 15:40\n\nTotal prize money: ¥ 238,600,000 (about US$ 1,822,000 <US$1=¥131>)\n\n3-y-o: 55 kg (about 121 lbs), 2 kg allowance for Southern Hemisphere-bred born in 2020\n\nCourse Record: 1:56.8Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Race Record: 1:56.9 [Mikki Queen (JPN, by Deep Impact), 2015]\n\nSafety factor: 18 runnersÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Going: GoodÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Weather: Fine\n\nFP BK PP Horse\n\nJockey S&A\n\nColor\n\nWgt Odds\n\n(Fav) Margin\n\n(L3F) Sire\n\nDam\n\n(Dam’s Sire) Owner\n\nBreeder\n\nTrainer 1 3 6 Liberty Island (JPN)\n\nYuga Kawada F3\n\nb.\n\n55.0 1.1\n\n(1) 2:01.1\n\n(33.6) Duramente\n\nYankee Rose\n\n(All American) Sunday Racing Co., Ltd.\n\nNorthern Racing\n\nMitsumasa Nakauchida 2 4 7 Masked Diva (JPN)\n\nMirai Iwata F3\n\nd.b.\n\n55.0 13.0\n\n(3) 1\n\n(33.5) Rulership\n\nMask Off\n\n(Deep Impact) Shadai Race Horse Co., Ltd.\n\nShadai Farm\n\nYasuyuki Tsujino 3 1 2 Harper (JPN)\n\nChristophe Lemaire F3\n\nb.\n\n55.0 12.9\n\n(2) 2-1/2\n\n(34.3) Heart's Cry\n\nSeresta\n\n(Jump Start) M's Racing\n\nNorthern Racing\n\nYasuo Tomomichi 4 3 5 Dura (JPN)\n\nArata Saito F3\n\nd.b.\n\n55.0 26.5\n\n(5) Nose\n\n(34.1) Duramente\n\nIsis\n\n(King Halo) Cypress Holdings LLC.\n\nGrande Farm\n\nYasuyuki Takahashi 5 4 8 Moryana (JPN)\n\nNorihiro Yokoyama F3\n\nb.\n\n55.0 29.0\n\n(7) Neck\n\n(33.9) Epiphaneia\n\nGarder le Sourire\n\n(Daiwa Major) Fumio Takahashi\n\nNorthern Racing\n\nYoshinori Muto 6 2 3 Malaki Naia (JPN)\n\nKenichi Ikezoe F3\n\nd.b.\n\n55.0 107.3\n\n(11) 1/2\n\n(34.2) Just a Way\n\nKauai Lane\n\n(King Kamehameha) Shadai Race Horse Co., Ltd.\n\nShadai Farm\n\nTatsuya Yoshioka 7 8 18 Emu (JPN)\n\nMirco Demuro F3\n\nb.\n\n55.0 201.8\n\n(15) Neck\n\n(33.8) Harbinger\n\nSourire\n\n(Special Week) Koji Maeda\n\nNorth Hills Co,.
