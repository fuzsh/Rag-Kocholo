        "text": "King of Hawaii from 1795 to 1819\n\nKamehameha I (Hawaiian pronunciation: [kəmehəˈmɛhə]; Kalani Paiʻea Wohi o Kaleikini Kealiʻikui Kamehameha o ʻIolani i Kaiwikapu kauʻi Ka Liholiho Kūnuiākea; c. 1736? – May 8 or 14, 1819), also known as Kamehameha the Great,[2] was the conqueror and first ruler of the Kingdom of Hawaii. The state of Hawaii gave a statue of him to the National Statuary Hall Collection in Washington, D.C., as one of two statues it is entitled to install there.\n\nBirth and childhood\n\n[edit]\n\nPaternity and family history\n\n[edit]\n\nKamehameha (known as Paiʻea at birth),[3] was born to Kekuʻiapoiwa II, the niece of Alapainui, the usurping ruler of Hawaii Island who had killed the two legitimate heirs of Keaweʻīkekahialiʻiokamoku during civil war. By most accounts he was born in Ainakea, Kohala, Hawaii. His father was Keōua Kalanikupuapa'ikalaninui; however, Native Hawaiian historian Samuel Kamakau says that Maui monarch Kahekili II had hānai adopted (traditional, informal adoption) Kamehameha at birth, as was the custom of the time. Kamakau believes this is why Kahekili II is often referred to as Kamehameha's father. The author also says that Kameʻeiamoku told Kamehameha I that he was the son of Kahekili II, saying, \"I have something to tell you: Ka-hekili was your father, you were not Keoua's son. Here are the tokens that you are the son of Ka-hekili.\"\n\nKing Kalākaua wrote that these rumors were scandals and should be dismissed as the offspring of hatred and jealousies of later years.[9] Regardless of the rumors, Kamehameha was a descendant of Keawe through his mother Kekuʻiapoiwa II; Keōua acknowledged him as his son and he is recognized as such by all the sovereigns[10] and most genealogists.\n\nAccounts of Kamehameha I's birth vary, but sources place his birth between 1736 and 1761, with historian Ralph Simpson Kuykendall believing it to be between 1748 and 1761. An early source is thought to imply a 1758 dating because that date matched a visit from Halley's Comet, and would make him close to the age that Francisco de Paula Marín estimated he was. This dating, however, does not accord with the details of many well-known accounts of his life, such as his fighting as a warrior with his uncle, Kalaniʻōpuʻu, or his being of age to father his first children by that time. The 1758 dating also places his birth after the death of his father.\n\nKamakau published an account in the Ka Nupepa Kuokoa in 1867 placing the date of Kamehameha's birth around 1736. He wrote, \"It was during the time of the warfare among the chiefs of [the island of] Hawaii which followed the death of Keawe, chief over the whole island (Ke-awe-i-kekahi-aliʻi-o-ka-moku) that Kamehameha I was born\". However, his general dating has been challenged as twenty years too early, related to disputes over Kamakau's inaccuracy of dating compared to accounts of foreign visitors. Regardless, Abraham Fornander wrote in his book, An Account of the Polynesian Race: Its Origins and Migrations: \"when Kamehameha died in 1819 he was past eighty years old. His birth would thus fall between 1736 and 1740, probably nearer the former than the latter\". A Brief History of the Hawaiian People by William De Witt Alexander lists the birth date in the \"Chronological Table of Events of Hawaiian History\" as 1736. In 1888 the Kamakau account was challenged by Samuel C. Damon in the missionary publication; The Friend, deferring to a 1753 dating that was the first mentioned by James Jackson Jarves. But the Kamakau dating was widely accepted due to support from Abraham Fornander.\n\nConcealment and childhood\n\n[edit]\n\nAt the time of Kamehameha's birth, his father, Keōua, along with his half-brother, Kalaniʻōpuʻu, were serving Alapaʻinui, ruler of the island of Hawai’i; Alapaʻinui had brought the brothers to his court, after defeating both of their fathers in the civil war that followed the death of Keaweʻīkekahialiʻiokamoku. Keōua had died while Kamehameha was very young, thus the boy was raised in the court of his uncle, Kalaniʻōpuʻu. The traditional mele chant of Keakamahana (chiefess and wife of Alapainui) mentions that Kamehameha was born in the month of ikuwā (autumn/winter), or around November; Alapai gave the young Kamehameha to Keaka and her sister, Hākau, to raise, once the ruler discovered the infant had indeed survived.\n\nOn February 10, 1911, the Kamakau version was challenged by the oral history of the Kaha family, as published in newspaper articles also appearing in the Kuoko. After Kamakau's history was published again (this time to a wider, English-reading public in 1911 Hawaii), the Kaha version of these events was published by Kamaka Stillman, who had objected to the Nupepa article.\n\nConquest of the islands\n\n[edit]\n\nHawaii Island\n\n[edit]\n\nKamehameha was raised in the royal court of his uncle Kalaniʻōpuʻu. He achieved prominence in 1782, upon Kalaniʻōpuʻu's death. While the kingship was inherited by Kīwalaʻō, Kalaniʻōpuʻu's son, Kamehameha was given a prominent religious position as guardian of the Hawaiian god of war, Kūkaʻilimoku. He was also given control of the district of Waipiʻo Valley. The two cousins' relationship was strained after Kamehameha made a dedication to the gods instead of allowing Kīwalaʻō to do that. Kamehameha accepted the allegiance of a group of chiefs from the Kona district.\n\nThe other story took place after the prophecy was passed along by the high priests and high chiefs. When Kamehameha was able to lift the Naha Stone, he was considered the fulfiller of the prophecy. Other ruling chiefs, Keawe Mauhili, the Mahoe (twins) Keoua, and other chiefs rejected the prophecy of Ka Poukahi. The high chiefs of Kauai supported Kiwalaʻo even after learning about the prophecy.\n\nThe five Kona chiefs supporting Kamehameha were Keʻeaumoku Pāpaʻiahiahi (Kamehameha's father-in-law/grand uncle), Keaweaheulu Kaluaʻāpana (Kamehameha's uncle), Kekūhaupiʻo (Kamehameha's warrior teacher), and Kameʻeiamoku and Kamanawa (twin uncles of Kamehameha). They defended Kamehameha as the unifier Ka Naʻi aupuni. High Chiefs Keawe Mauhili and Keeaumoku were by genealogy the next in line for aliʻi nui. Both chose the younger nephews Kīwalaʻō and Kamehameha over themselves. Kīwalaʻō was soon defeated in the first key conflict, the Battle of Mokuʻōhai. Kamehameha and his chiefs took over Konohiki responsibilities and sacred obligations of the districts of Kohala, Kona, and Hāmākua on Hawaiʻi island.\n\nThe prophecy included far more than Hawaiʻi island. It went across and beyond the Pacific Islands to the semi-continent of Aotearoa (New Zealand). He was supported by his most political wife Kaʻahumanu and father, High Chief Keeaumoku. Senior counselor to Kamehameha, she became one of Hawaiʻi's most powerful figures. Kamehameha and his council of chiefs planned to unite the rest of the Hawaiian Islands. Allies came from British and American traders, who sold guns and ammunition to Kamehameha. Another major factor in Kamehameha's continued success was the support of Kauai chief Kaʻiana and Captain William Brown of the Butterworth Squadron. He guaranteed Kamehameha unlimited gunpowder from China and gave him the formula for gunpowder: sulfur, saltpeter, and charcoal, all of which are abundant in the islands. Two westerners who lived on Hawaiʻi island, Isaac Davis and John Young, married native Hawaiian women and assisted Kamehameha.\n\nOlowalu Massacre\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Olowalu Massacre\n\nIn 1789, Simon Metcalfe had been captaining a fur-trading vessel, the Eleanora, while his son, Thomas Humphrey Metcalfe, captained the ship Fair American along the Pacific Northwest Coast; the two parties were to rendezvous in the Hawaiian Islands. Fair American was held-up when it was captured by the Spanish and then quickly released in San Blas, north of Panamá.\n\nThe Eleanora finally arrived in 1790, where it was greeted by chief Kameʻeiamoku. During their interactions, the chief is allegedly to have offended or insulted Captain Metcalfe somehow, causing him to strike the chief with a rope's end. Sometime later, while docked in Honuaula, Maui, a small boat—which was tied to the larger ship, and had a crewman inside—was stolen by native islanders. When Metcalfe discovered where the boat was taken, he sailed directly to the village of Olowalu. There, he confirmed that the boat had been broken-apart and the shipmate murdered. Previously, Metcalfe had resorted to violence when he fired muskets into another village near where he had been anchored, ultimately killing some of the residents. This time, furious, Metcalfe took-aim at Olowalu, ordering all cannons aboard the ship to be moved to one side, facing the island. As the captain initiated his trading calls and greetings to the locals, hundreds of people—men, women, children and elderly—ventured down to the beach to trade, on foot and by canoe. When the islanders were within range, Metcalfe ordered the cannons to be fired on the Hawaiians, killing over 100 of them.\n\nSix weeks later, Fair American was stuck near the Kona coast of Hawaii where chief Kameʻeiamoku was living, near Kaʻūpūlehu. Kameʻeiamoku had decided to attack the next foreign ship to avenge the strike by the elder Metcalfe. He canoed out to the ship with his men, where he killed Metcalfe's son and all but one (Isaac Davis) of the five crewmen. Kamehameha took Davis into protection and took possession of the ship. Eleanora was at that time anchored at Kealakekua Bay, where the ship's boatswain had gone ashore and been captured by Kamehameha's forces because Kamehameha believed Metcalfe was planning more revenge. Eleanora waited several days before sailing off, apparently without knowledge of what had happened to Fair American or Metcalfe's son. Davis and Eleanora's boatswain, John Young, tried to escape, but were treated as chiefs, given wives and settled in Hawaii.\n\nInvasion of Maui\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1790, Kamehameha's army invaded Maui with the assistance of John Young and Isaac Davis. Using cannons from the Fair American, they defeated Maui's army led by Kalanikūpule at the bloody Battle of Kepaniwai while the aliʻi Kahekili II was on Oahu.[26]\n\nIn 1791, Kahekili and his brother Kāʻeokūlani reconquered Maui and also acquired cannons. In April or May 1791, Kahekili tried to invade the island of Hawaiʻi, but was defeated in a naval battle called Kepuwahaʻulaʻula near Waipiʻo. Kamehameha had to wait for the civil war that broke out in 1793 after the death of Kahekili to finally win control of Maui.\n\nDeath of Keōua Kuahuula\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1790, Keōua Kūʻahuʻula, who came to rule the districts of Kaʻū and Puna, took advantage of Kamehameha's absence in Maui and began raiding the west coast of Hawaii. He also advanced against the district of Hilo, deposing his uncle Keawemaʻuhili.[26] When Kamehameha returned, Keōua escaped to the Kīlauea volcano, which erupted. Many warriors died from the poisonous gas emitted from the volcano.[26]\n\nWhen the Puʻukoholā Heiau was completed in 1791, Kamehameha invited Keōua to meet with him. Keōua may have been dispirited by his recent losses. He may have mutilated himself before landing so as to render himself an inappropriate sacrificial victim. As he stepped on shore, one of Kamehameha's chiefs threw a spear at him. By some accounts, he dodged it but was then cut down by musket fire. Caught by surprise, Keōua's bodyguards were killed. With Keōua dead, and his supporters captured or slain, Kamehameha became King of Hawaiʻi island.\n\nMaui and Oʻahu\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1795, Kamehameha set sail with an armada of 960 war canoes and 10,000 soldiers. He quickly secured the lightly defended islands of Maui and Molokaʻi at the Battle of Kawela. He moved on to the island of Oʻahu, landing his troops at Waiʻalae and Waikīkī. Kamehameha did not know that one of his commanders, a high-ranking aliʻi named Kaʻiana, had defected to Kalanikūpule. Kaʻiana assisted in cutting notches into the Nuʻuanu Pali mountain ridge; these notches, like those on a castle turret, were to serve as gunports for Kalanikūpule's cannon.[30] In a series of skirmishes, Kamehameha's forces pushed Kalanikūpule's men back until they were cornered on the Pali Lookout. While Kamehameha moved on the Pali, his troops took heavy fire from the cannon. He assigned two divisions of his best warriors to climb to the Pali to attack the cannons from behind; they surprised Kalanikūpule's gunners and took control. With the loss of their guns, Kalanikūpule's troops fell into disarray and were cornered by Kamehameha's still-organized troops. A fierce battle at Nuʻuanu ensued, with Kamehameha's forces forming an enclosing wall. Using traditional Hawaiian spears, as well as muskets and cannon, they killed most of Kalanikūpule's forces. Over 400 men were forced over the Pali's cliff, a drop of 1,000 feet. Kaʻiana was killed during the action; Kalanikūpule was later captured and sacrificed to Kūkāʻilimoku.\n\nKauaʻi and rebellion of Nāmakehā\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter his conquest of Oahu in the summer of 1795, Kamehameha I prepared his forces for the conquest of Kauaʻi, the last remaining island kingdom out of his control. In the spring of 1796, he attempted to continue with his forces to Kauaʻi but he lost many of his canoes in the strong winds and rough seas of the Kaʻieʻie Waho channel. He returned to Hawaii to pacify the rebellion of Nāmakehā (brother of Kaʻiana) in Hilo and ruled from Hawaii for the next six years as he consolidated his conquests and prepare for a second invasion of Kauaʻi. At Hilo, Kamehameha I commissioned the building a large fleet of 800 (according to Kamakau) double-hulled war canoes called peleleu along with Western schooners, and he also stockpile large number of guns, canons and ammunition. He took his peleleu to Maui where he stayed from 1802 to 1803 and then to Oʻahu in late 1803 or early 1804. While in Oʻahu, a large percentage of his force was killed by the maʻi ʻokuʻu epidemic, which was thought to be either cholera or bubonic plague. Kamehameha I contracted the illness but survived. The second invasion of Kauaʻi was postponed.\n\nIn April 1810, Kamehameha I negotiated the peaceful unification of the islands with Kauaʻi. His court genealogist and high priest Kalaikuʻahulu was instrumental in the monarch's decision not to kill Kaumualiʻi, the ruler of that island, when he was the single member of the aliʻi council to agree with Kamehameha's own reluctance to do so. The other aliʻi continued with the plan to poison Kaumualiʻi when Isaac Davis warned him, making the ruler cut his trip short and return to Kauaʻi, leaving Davis to be poisoned by the aliʻi instead.\n\nAliʻi Mo'i of the Hawaiian Islands\n\n[edit]\n\nAs ruler, Kamehameha took steps to ensure the islands remained a united realm after his death. He unified the legal system. He used the products collected in taxes to promote trade with Europe and the United States.\n\nThe origins of the Law of the Splintered Paddle are derived from before the unification of the Island of Hawaiʻi. In 1782 during a raid, Kamehameha caught his foot in a rock. Two local fishermen, fearful of the great warrior, hit Kamehameha hard on the head with a large paddle, which broke the paddle. Kamehameha was stunned and left for dead, allowing the fisherman and his companion to escape. Twelve years later, the same fishermen were brought before Kamehameha for punishment. The king instead blamed himself for attacking innocent people, gave the fishermen gifts of land and set them free. He declared the new law, \"Let every elderly person, woman, and child lie by the roadside in safety.\"[36]\n\nYoung and Davis became advisors to Kamehameha and provided him with advanced weapons that helped in combat. Kamehameha was also a religious king and the holder of the war god Kūkāʻilimoku. The explorer George Vancouver noted that Kamehameha worshiped his gods and wooden images in a heiau, but originally wanted to bring England's religion, Christianity, to Hawaiʻi. Missionaries were not sent from Great Britain because Kamehameha told Vancouver that the gods he worshiped were his gods with mana, and that through these gods, Kamehameha had become supreme ruler over all of the islands. Witnessing Kamehameha's devotion, Vancouver decided against sending missionaries from England.\n\nLater life\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter about 1812, Kamehameha returned from Oahu and spent the last years of his life at Kamakahonu, a compound he built in Kailua-Kona. As was the custom of the time, he had several wives and many children, though he outlived many of them.[40]\n\nFinal resting place\n\n[edit]\n\nWhen Kamehameha died on May 8 or 14, 1819, his body was hidden by his trusted friends, Hoapili and Hoʻolulu, in the ancient custom called hūnākele (literally, \"to hide in secret\"). The mana, or power of a person, was considered to be sacred. As per the ancient custom, his body was buried in a hidden location because of his mana. His final resting place remains unknown. At one point in his reign, Kamehameha III asked that Hoapili show him where his father's bones were buried, but on the way there Hoapili knew that they were being followed, so he turned around.\n\nFamily\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: House of Kamehameha\n\nKamehameha had many wives. The exact number is debated because documents that recorded the names of his wives were destroyed. Hiram Bingham I lists 21 wives, but earlier research from Mary Kawena Pukui counted 26. In Kamehameha's Children Today authors Charles Ahlo, Rubellite Kawena Johnson and Jerry Walker list 30 wives: 18 who had children, and 12 who did not. They state the total number of children to be 35: 17 sons and 18 daughters.[46] While he had many wives and children, only his children through his highest-ranking wife, Keōpūolani, succeeded him to the throne. In Hoʻomana: Understanding the Sacred and Spiritual, Chun stated that Keōpūolani supported Kaʻahumanu's ending of the Kapu system as the best way to ensure that Kamehameha's children and grandchildren would rule the kingdom.\n\nKey- (k)= Kane (male/husband)\n\n(w)= wahine (female/wife)\n\nSubjects with bold titles, lavender highlighted, bold box= Direct bloodline\n\nBold title, bold, grey box= Aunts, uncles, cousins line\n\nBold title, bold white box= European or American (raised to aliʻi status by marriage or monarch's decree)\n\nRegular name and box= makaʻāinana or untitled foreign subject\n\nKāneikaiwilani (k)Kanalohanaui (k)Keakealani (w)Ahu-a-ʻI (k)Piʻilani (w) IIMoana (k) Lonoikahaupu (k)Kalanikauleleiaiwi (w)Kauauaʻamahi (k)Keawe II (k)Lonomaʻaikanaka (w)Kauhiahaki (k)Iliki-a-Moana (w) Keawepoepoe (k)Kanoena (w)Haʻaeamahi (k)Kekelakekeokalani (w)Alapainui (k)Keaka (w)Keeaumoku Nui (k)Kamakaimoku (w)Kaeamamao (k)[i]Kaolanialiʻi (w)[i] Kameʻeiamoku (k)\n\nKamakaʻeheikuli (w)Keōua (k)Kahekili II (k)Kekuiapoiwa II (w)Ikuaʻana (w)Heulu (k)Moana (w)Keaweʻopala (k)Nohomualani (k) Keaweaheulu (k)Ululani (w)Hakau (w)Kanaʻina (k)Kauwa (w)Eia (k) Kepoʻokalani (k)[i]Alapai (w)[i]Keohohiwa (w)Keōpūolani (w)Kamehameha I\n\nKalaniʻōpuʻu (k)Kānekapōlei (w)Kiʻilaweau (k)Nāhiʻōleʻa (k)Kahoʻowaha II (w)Inaina (w) Hao (K)Kailipakalua (w) Kamanawa II (k)[i]Kamokuiki (w)[i]ʻAikanaka (k)Kamaeokalani (w)Kaōleiokū (k)Keoua (w)Luahine (w)KalaʻimamahuKaheiheimālie Kamehameha II\n\nKamehameha III\n\nKekūanaōʻa (k)Kahalaiʻa\n\nLuanuʻu (k)Pauahi (w)Kīnaʻu (w)Pākī (k)Kōnia (w)Kanaʻina IIKaʻahumanu III Kapaʻakea\n\n(1815–1866)[i]Keohokālole\n\n(1816–1869)[i]Keʻelikōlani (w)Kamehameha IV\n\nKamehameha V\n\nKaʻahumanu IV\n\nPauahi Bishop (w)Bishop (k)Lunalilo (k)\n\nKaliokalani\n\n(1835–1852)[i]Kalākaua\n\n(1836–1891)[i]\n\nKapiʻolani\n\n(1834–1899)\n\nLiliʻuokalani\n\n(1838–1917)[i]\n\nDominis\n\n(1832–1891)Kaʻiulani\n\n(1842–?)[i]Kaʻiminaʻauao\n\n(1845–1848)[i]Cleghorn\n\n(1835–1910)Likelike\n\n(1851–1887)[i]Leleiohoku II\n\n(1854–1877)[i] Kaʻiulani\n\n(1875–1899)[i]\n\nNotes:\n\nIn popular culture\n\n[edit]\n\nKamehameha I is the namesake of Goku's signature technique and energy attack in the Japanese media franchise Dragon Ball.
