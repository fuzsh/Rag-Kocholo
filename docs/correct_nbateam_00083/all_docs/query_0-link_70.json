As a standout star, Felton went onto play in college where he was voted Carolina Player of the Year in his freshman season and eventually became a Bob Cousy Award winner, an NCAA Champion, and a member of the First Team All-ACC squad in 2005. The point guard was picked as the 5th overall selection in the 2005 NBA Draft. He showed how good he was early on with a breakout game where he scored 31 points and averaged 11.9 points per game in his rookie season earning his NBA All-Rookie Second Team honors. Since then he has played for four other teams and had similar success including with the Knicks where his shooting has been instrumental in winning key games, including against the defending league champions at the time.\n\nBook Raymond Felton for your Next Event\n\nDisclaimer: AthleteSpeakers assists companies seeking to hire talent like Raymond Felton for speaking engagements, virtual meetings, appearances, product endorsements, and business sanctions.
