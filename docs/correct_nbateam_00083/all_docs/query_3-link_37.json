        "text": "Vin GetzCorrespondent I\n\nNew York Knicks: Is Raymond Felton an Elite Point Guard?\n\n0 of 11\n\nJonathan Daniel/Getty Images\n\nAfter years of relative obscurity in Charlotte, Raymond Felton is suddenly on the big city map.\n\nHe's helping serve up a winning record for the New York Knicks in what could be their first over .500 season in a decade.\n\nThe co-captain has equally impressive numbers to match. He's scattered all over the top 10 in numerous statistical categories amongst NBA point guards this year.\n\nSo far, Felton has \"made it\" in New York, but can he make it anywhere else? Is he one of the league's elite point guards today?\n\nThere's good points to be made on both sides of the fence.\n\nPhoto: Raymond Felton and Derrick Rose. Is that two elite point guards or one?\n\nYES: Felton's Offense Speaks For Itself\n\n1 of 11\n\nChris Trotman/Getty Images\n\nRaymond Felton is having the best offensive year of his career—by far.\n\nHe has jumped into the \"elite\" discussion by averaging 17.5 points and 8.9 assists per game. His career bests before this season were 14.4 and 7.4, respectively.\n\nAgainst the Golden State Warriors he scored 35. His high for assists this year, 17, came against the Denver Nuggets.\n\nFelton also has 19 double-doubles and one triple-double in just half a season.\n\nIn 44 games, he has had 10 or more assists 22 times and scored 20 or more 16 times.\n\nNO: He Still Has a Number Of Offensive Deficiencies\n\n2 of 11\n\nStreeter Lecka/Getty Images\n\nFelton is 60th amongst all guards (shooting and point, minimum 200 FGA) in field goal percentage.\n\nHe's 69th in three-point field goal percentage (minimum 50 3PA), hacking an uncalled for 76 of 221 treys.\n\nHis efficiency rating (PER) is just under 20, which is probably the minimum for an elite player.\n\nHe also turns the ball over too much and could use a little practice at the line (87%).\n\nYES: Felton Plays Some Mean Defense\n\n3 of 11\n\nEzra Shaw/Getty Images\n\nFelton manages both ends of the floor well: offense and defense.\n\nHe has 82 steals already and averages nearly two a game. He should finish the season with over 325 rebounds, playing above his 6'1\" height.\n\nFelton is also adept at creating turnovers.\n\nNO: Minus This Year, Felton's Career Numbers Are Average\n\n4 of 11\n\nAl Bello/Getty Images\n\nBefore landing in the biggest media market in the country, Raymond Felton was a relative unknown. He still flies a little under the radar.\n\nHis career shooting percentage hovers around 41% and he averages about 1,000 points and 500 assists a year. He turns the ball over 200 times a season and sports a below 80% free-throw percentage.\n\nThese are not elite numbers.\n\nYES: He Runs The No. 2 Offense In The NBA\n\n5 of 11\n\nStreeter Lecka/Getty Images\n\nFor most of the season, in fact, he was running the No. 1 offense in the league. Denver recently overtook the top spot.\n\nThe Knicks are averaging 106.7 points per game, thanks in great part to Felton's smart play, ball handling and floor management. He's quick and fits perfectly into Mike D'Antoni's hyper offensive scheme.\n\nYou can credit Felton for making everyone around him better, especially the Knicks young players—Wilson Chandler and Danilo Gallinari are being fed the ball and having breakout years. Landry Fields is maturing quickly behind Felton's lead.\n\nAnd Amar'e Stoudemire is having the best year of his career, after playing with Steve Nash for six years. Hmm.\n\nNO: Felton Goes Into Offensive Slumps That Affect The Knicks' Ability To Win\n\n6 of 11\n\nNick Laham/Getty Images\n\nIf you're trying to find an answer for the Knicks' current woes, take a look at Felton's line.\n\nIn the Knicks' recent six game losing streak, Felton averaged under 14 points a game. His assists and steals were both under his season averages.\n\nThe same held true when the Knicks went 3-8 to start the season.\n\nFelton shot just 36% in January.\n\nYES: Felton Rises To The Occasion Against Better Teams\n\n7 of 11\n\nStreeter Lecka/Getty Images\n\nOn the other hand, Felton's numbers against some of the best teams in the league are above his season averages. He's a big-game player.\n\nAgainst the Celtics: 10 apg / 21.5 ppg\n\nAgainst the Spurs: 7 apg / 25.5 ppg\n\nAgainst the Bulls: 11 apg / 20 ppg\n\nAgainst the Nuggets: 14.5 apg / 19 ppg\n\nAgainst the Hornets: 13 assists / 17 points\n\nNO: Lack Of Rings, Hardware, Honors and Playoff Experience\n\n8 of 11\n\nDoug Pensinger/Getty Images\n\nIt's tough to be considered elite when, in five and a half years, you've appeared in only four playoff games.\n\nFelton will possibly (likely? hopefully?) have the chance to raise his postseason stock in 2010-11.\n\nUntil then, he has 11.8 ppg in the playoffs and no playoff wins.\n\nHe didn't win Rookie of the Year or any other NBA award and has no first team honors or league leaderships, either.\n\nYES: Felton Hits Clutch Shots That Keep The Knicks In Games\n\n9 of 11\n\nThe game-winner against the Toronto Raptors was probably Felton's biggest bucket of the year, but less spectacularly though just as important, he consistently keeps the Knicks in the game by pacing opponents.\n\nIn the win against the Spurs, for another example, it was Felton's play that staved off a late charge from San Antonio.\n\nNO: He's Not As Good As The True Elite Point Guards\n\n10 of 11\n\nConclusion: Is Raymond Felton an Elite Point Guard?\n\n11 of 11\n\nChristian Petersen/Getty Images\n\nSo, is Raymond Felton an \"elite\" point guard?\n\nNo. But he could be.\n\nHe is a very good point guard. He is at times an excellent point guard. Knicks' fans think, and rightfully so, that he is a great point guard. Sometimes he's the best point guard in the league on a particular night.\n\nBut until the name \"Felton\" is mentioned in the same sentences as the other elite NBA point guards, past and present, he will not be considered one of them.\n\nA strong playoff run, or even a ring, would help, but the Knicks will take a double-double against the Heat Thursday night to start.\n\nX"
