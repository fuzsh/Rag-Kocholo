        "text": "He remembers a time where he was like Russell Westbrook. No, Raymond Felton was never one of the most athletic point guards in NBA history, but you hear the excitement and confidence in his voice as he recalls the younger version of himself.\n\nAt least for a second. In the middle of questions, Felton jets into other topics like a point guard who’s wired to set up his teammates. As Felton sits courtside at the Thunder’s practice facility, Jerami Grant is taking jump shots.\n\nFelton, now 33 years old, is looking out toward the future.\n\n\"He’s one of those guys I’ve been on top of, trying to make things better for him,\" Felton said nodding toward Grant. \"That’s the way I approach it, just trying to make things easier on my teammates.\"\n\nFelton has certainly made a 5-7 start a little easier on the Thunder.\n\nFelton, the least heralded of Sam Presti’s offseason acquisitions, has been rock solid during the Thunder’s rocky start to the season – a player who has carved out his niche and sought respect along the way.\n\n--\n\nFelton has played for seven teams since he was drafted fifth overall by the then-Charlotte Bobcats in 2005. Of the Thunder’s 12 opponents this season, he’s played for four of them (Knicks, Trail Blazers, Nuggets, Clippers). Sunday will make five when the Thunder hosts the Mavericks.\n\nThe Thunder didn’t know what to expect from its backup point guard spot last season other than a massive drop off when Westbrook exited games. Felton, signed for the $2.3 million veteran’s minimum this summer, has filled that role with success.\n\nWhen Westbrook was off the floor last season, the Thunder’s offense was worse by 10.5 points per 100 offensive possessions. Point guards Norris Cole and Semaj Christon struggled to lead the second unit, and were net negatives (minus-6.4 and minus-6.5, respectively) when on the floor.\n\nEven after the Thunder’s recent four-game losing streak, the bench has a net rating (point differential per 100 possessions) of plus-6, sixth in the NBA. While the staggering of lineups with the core four of Westbrook, Carmelo Anthony, Paul George and Steven Adams has helped the second-unit’s numbers, Felton has been a reliable hand in the transition.\n\nFelton is averaging 7.8 points, 2.3 assists and a steal while shooting 49.3 percent, 46.2 percent from 3-point range (12-of-26).\n\n“I think the glue guy to that group has really been Raymond,” Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. “I think having veteran leadership back there from him at least allows me to communicate, and then he’s so good at managing the game, that regardless of the personnel that’s out there he can do a really terrific job of getting everybody where they need to be.”\n\n--\n\nTwo summers ago, Dallas was over the salary cap and couldn’t even bring Felton back on the veteran's minimum. Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle and Clippers coach Doc Rivers connected, as the Clippers were looking for a backup to Chris Paul.\n\nCarlisle told Rivers he was getting a true pro. Rivers told Presti the same thing this summer.\n\n“Rick was exactly right,” Rivers said. “We wanted him back in the worst way if we could have had him back.”\n\nThe Clippers also went over the cap this summer and couldn’t bring back Felton. He has no animosity, but he’s honest, believing a checkered past has hurt him as a pro.\n\nHe was traded four times in a four-year span. He was vilified in Portland for being out of shape and struggling as a starter on a 28-win team in 2012.\n\nClippers guard Austin Rivers doesn’t get people giving Felton “crap about being overweight.” “He knows how to use his size,\" he said. \"He uses that body of his and bumps you out of the way to finish.\"\n\nAfter getting traded from the Knicks to the Mavericks in 2014, Felton pled guilty to gun charges of attempted criminal possession of a weapon and criminal possession of a firearm in New York. The NBA suspended him the first four games of the 2014-15 season.\n\n“For a while, people were viewing me in a way that wasn’t me,” Felton said. “I’m always a person that if I make a mistake, I’m never gonna run from something. I just face whatever happens.\n\n“I went through a lot off the court, so it was a lot of stuff I had to build back. I’m being blessed to still play this game. That’s my role and I’m accepting it fully, and when I get out there I’m doing my job.”\n\n--\n\nJust because Felton has accepted a shift from starter to second unit since hitting his 30s doesn’t mean he’s benched his competitive streak.\n\nThe game is simple: One-on-one. Make a shot, you stay on offense. Get a stop on defense and you switch to offense. With a physique that contrasted the taller, more slender ones around him, Felton still gets his shot off, proving he's brought more than just post-practice trash talk with him to Oklahoma City.\n\nHis self-assurance sometimes get him into trouble. Friday against the Clippers, he sneered backing up the smaller Jawun Evans before forcing up an 18-footer and shaking his head in a 2-of-6 game. It doubles as confidence the Thunder's second-unit lacked at guard last season.\n\nLater, Anthony joined the group, poking at his former Knicks teammate.\n\n“Old man coming through. Geriatric,” Anthony announced happily about a veteran the same age as him. But the joke didn’t stab like a snarky social media one-liner about Felton’s weight. It didn’t sound like the wave of disapproval at the Moda Center in Portland last week.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Felton hit a step-back jumper for his 12th and 13th points, and heavy boos poured down on the geriatric as he walked off during a Portland timeout.\n\nFelton booed back, all the way to the Thunder bench.\n\n“I’m not one of those guys to this day that’s just gotta be considered one of the best in the world,” Felton said. “I could care less about that.\n\n“What I care about more than anything is my respect, and I feel like I have that respect from my peers and guys around the league.”"
