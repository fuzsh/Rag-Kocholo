        "text": "Former NBA player Raymond Felton looks much different since retiring.\n\nFelton was a superstar for the UNC Tar Heels during his days in college and had an incredibly successful NBA career that lasted from 2005 through 2019.\n\nThere's no question he was an unbelievably talented basketball player. However, you wouldn't know he was a former superstar and NCAA champion by what he looks like these days.\n\nFelton played in the Knicks' annual celebrity and alumni game, according to BroBible, and the internet lost it when they saw his current appearance.\n\nIt's not an exaggeration to say he looks like a different human.\n\nInternet stunned by Raymond Felton's weight gain.\n\nFor context, the photo below is of Felton late in his NBA career when he was with the Oklahoma City Thunder. Take a glance and then take a look at the video above.\n\nDoes that look like the same person to you? I wouldn't have ever recognized him.\n\nNaturally, the internet had a ton of fun with the situation. Below are some of the most notable reactions.\n\nNow, I couldn't care less what people decide to eat. This is America. If you want to eat terribly and not exercise and let yourself go, that's your choice.\n\nAnd before you all blow up my email at David.Hookstead@outkick.com, I also used to be very fat. I know what it's like. It's absolutely awful.\n\nThen, I decided during the 2018 Syracuse/Clemson football game as I looked at an entire living room table of Taco Bell and Mountain Dew for myself that I should probably stop drinking soda and eating healthier.\n\nYou can see the difference below.\n\nHowever, it's also perfectly fine to laugh when the rest of the internet finds something funny. I think that's the bucket this Raymond Felton video falls in. People seem to be in a genuine state of shock.\n\nHaving said that, the real joke is on us because Raymond Felton made more than $53 million during his NBA career and was a legit hooper. I - even though I'm no longer fat - definitely can't say the same. Let me know your thoughts on Felton's weight gain at David.Hookstead@outkick.com."
