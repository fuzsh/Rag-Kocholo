        "text": "In a recent appearance on the Run Your Race podcast, Felton proclaimed Anthony was more of a pure scorer than his Airness himself, Michael Jordan, and King James, Kobe, or T-Mac Tracy McGrady, who’s often in the conversation. “That dude, just the way he can score, how easy it is for him, I don’t know nobody who’s better, to be honest with you. I’m talking Tracy McGrady, I’m talking about MJ, I’m talking about Kobe, LeBron, all these guys. The way he used to score at every level, I don’t know nobody who’s better, for real,” Felton said. “Post-up, got footwork, midrange is impeccable, shoot the three, athletic, can dunk on you, get to the basket, had handles like a point guard. I’m just saying – whatever you want, he can give to you,” Felton went on to say. “Whatever you want. ‘If you want just midrange all game, I got you. You want me to post you up? I got you. You want me to shoot the three? I got you.’”\n\nMichael Jordan, especially early on his tenure as owner, was hands-on. He would make himself accessible to players. Occasionally, he even reminded them of why he’s, arguably, the greatest player of all time. Gerald Henderson: We were getting our ass kicked for about a week. I show up to the training room the next morning. I was a rookie so I had to get my stuff out of the way first and he’s already in there stretching and he’s got practice gear on. I said “What are you about to do, man?” He said “I’m gonna come up there and kick y’all ass.” He’s in there talking s–t for however long. He comes up there and he gets into our scrimmages. He jumped on our second team. Our first team had like Stephen Jackson, Gerald Wallace, Raymond Felton, and — who else started that year? — Boris Diaw. On our second team it was me, Derrick Brown, DJ Augustin, maybe Tyrus Thomasand somebody else. He looked like prime Michael Jordan, without the quickness and the jumping ability. But it was just all MJ work. Talking smack the whole time.\n\nWhen Raymond Felton joined Ian Begley and SNY’s Chris Williamson on the latest edition of The Putback, he was asked about what advice he would give to Dennis Smith Jr. and Frank Ntilikina, two young point guards trying to find their way while playing in the bright lights of New York. “Just confidence, man. Having confidence in yourself. Don’t get caught up in just all the pressure,” Felton said in this week’s Putback Extra. “There’s a lot of pressure to play in New York. It’s a lot of pressure. The fans in New York really love basketball, they really love their Knicks, and if you ain’t putting up, they’ll let you know. It’s a lot of pressure. If you can’t take it, and I’ve seen it hurt a lot of people’s careers.”\n\nFelton explained that even if the young guards are struggling with their shots, there are other ways that they can impact the game and win over the New York fans. “That’s one thing I felt in that arena, it’s one thing that I felt from the fans. I think that’s the biggest thing I would help those guys with, just trying to be complete players,” Felton said. “Everybody thinks it’s all about scoring. ‘I’ve got to score all these points to get my money and get this contract,’ and it’s like yeah you do have to be able to put the ball in the basket, you’ve got to score, but there’s a lot of other things you can do, too, to get paid in this league.”"
