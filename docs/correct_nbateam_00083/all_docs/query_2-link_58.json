        "text": "Hoops Hypotheticals\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n16 min read\n\n·\n\nAug 18, 2023\n\n--\n\nWelcome back! You can check out the rules and format of our hypothetical NBA All-Star audit here and earlier entries in the series here. We’re jumping back in below with a review of the 2010 through 2014 All-Star Games and, as noted in the title to this post, there are a couple selections that are, for lack of a better word, bonkers…\n\n2010 Eastern Conference Team\n\nPlayers with enough All-NBA votes to retain their All-Star selection: Chris Bosh, Al Horford, Dwight Howard, LeBron James Joe Johnson, David Lee, Paul Pierce, Rajon Rondo, Derrick Rose, Dwyane Wade\n\nPlayers Added to the End-of-Season Team:\n\nAndrew Bogut (149 All-NBA votes, Third Team) — Like Andre Miller, Lamar Odom, and Marcus Camby before him, it’s great to see an underappreciated player who never made an actual All-Star Game in Andrew Bogut get some recognition in this exercise. Bogut was great this year, averaging 16/10/2 with 2 blocks per game. His offensive numbers are just okay and they drag down his overall advanced metrics to ordinary levels, but if his defensive metrics are isolated then Bogut is one of the best in the league. He had a defensive rating of 98, which was second-best in the league behind Dwight Howard’s 95, and he was in the top seven of defensive win shares and defensive BPM despite playing fewer games than the players above him.\n\nBrook Lopez (6 All-NBA votes) — Lopez averaged 19/8/2 per game with mediocre efficiency and advanced numbers, though his Nets were one of the worst teams of all time and accomplished just 12 wins. That win total should probably preclude Lopez’s appearance here, so I’m not sure what led him to receive six All-NBA votes.\n\nPlayers Removed from the End-of-Season Team:\n\nGerald Wallace (5 All-NBA votes) — As cool as it is to see Bogut get in, I hate seeing Wallace fall out of his only All-Star berth. He definitely should’ve been in over Lopez if nothing else. Wallace was great this season, helping the historically moribund Bobcats to 44 wins and their first ever playoff appearance. He was phenomenal on defense and earned a First Team All-Defensive selection. He also posted a terrific 11.5 win shares, which was good enough for sixth in the league, and averaged 18/10/2 per game.\n\nKevin Garnett (1 All-NBA vote) — At this stage of his career, Garnett was transitioning to more of a leadership and defensive specialist role instead of his peak performances dominating every facet of the game. He was fine this year, averaging 14/7/2 with strong defense and good advanced metrics and the Celtics remained very good, so it makes sense that Garnett remained in the All-Star conversation.\n\nAllen Iverson (0 All-NBA votes) — Unfortunately, Iverson’s career was cratering at this point. He remained immensely popular but was far from an All-Star, averaging 14/3/4 per game, playing in just 28 games, and bouncing between the Grizzlies, 76ers, and, ultimately, out of the league completely at season’s end.\n\n2010 Western Conference Team\n\nPlayers with enough All-NBA votes to retain their All-Star selection: Carmelo Anthony, Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan, Kevin Durant, Pau Gasol, Steve Nash, Dirk Nowitzki, Brandon Roy, Amare Stoudemire, Deron Williams\n\nPlayers Added to the End-of-Season Team:\n\nCarlos Boozer (33 All-NBA votes) — There were no holes in Boozer’s resume this year and he certainly warranted an All-Star selection, averaging 19/11/3 to go along with great advanced numbers and a 53–29 record for the Jazz.\n\nPlayers Removed from the End-of-Season Team:\n\nChauncey Billups (24 All-NBA votes) — Billups is a victim of circumstance this year. Pau Gasol had made the actual All-Star game as a center in 2010. However, because he was a forward in All-NBA voting, he had to be a forward in our hypothetical All-Star team as well. This had a trickle-down effect, as the forward competition in the West was brutal and, ultimately, both hypothetical wild card spots went to West forwards in Gasol and Boozer. This meant that only four of the five West guards who made the actual All-Star Team could also make the hypothetical team, with Billups being the odd man out. It also meant that a new center had to assume the center spot vacated by Pau. This opening went to Chris Kaman, who had fewer All-NBA votes than not just Billups, but the following three players as well. Kaman also had just 2.4 win shares this year, which has to be one of the lowest totals for an All-Star ever. Had Pau remained at center, then Kaman would be out and Billups would make the hypothetical team as a wild card.\n\nZach Randolph (20 All-NBA votes) — In his first season in Memphis, Randolph averaged 21/11/2 and prompted a 16-win turnaround to get the Grizzlies to 40–42. This was the birth of grit’n’grind.\n\nJason Kidd (18 All-NBA votes) — After entering the league as a notably bad jump shooter, Kidd fully realized his shooting potential this year by shooting 42% from beyond the arc on 5.2 attempts per game. He averaged 10/5/9 and 2 steals per game overall and helped the Mavs to 55 wins.\n\nChris Paul (14 All-NBA votes) — Paul’s numbers were as good as ever, including amazing advanced metrics, but he played in just 45 games on the year.\n\n2011 Eastern Conference Team\n\nPlayers with enough All-NBA votes to retain their All-Star selection: Carmelo Anthony, Kevin Garnett, Al Horford, Dwight Howard, LeBron James, Paul Pierce, Rajon Rondo, Derrick Rose, Amare Stoudemire, Dwyane Wade, Deron Williams¹\n\nPlayers Added to the End-of-Season Team:\n\nAndrew Bogut (13 All-NBA votes) — Bogut makes it two All-Star additions in a row, though this season was very different from last. Bogut was top-notch defensively in 2010 but somehow got even better in 2011. His per game rebounding and block numbers improved, his defensive rating improved from 97 to 96, and his other defensive metrics also improved. However, his numbers dipped considerably on the offensive side of the ball. He also missed more games to injury and the Bucks won eleven fewer games than the previous season. This caused his overall advanced numbers to drop too. As such, while Bogut feels like a deserving All-Star in the East this year, it doesn’t feel quite as obvious as last year.\n\nPlayers Removed from the End-of-Season Team:\n\nChris Bosh (2 All-NBA votes) — The players who made the actual East All-Star team were at a disadvantage this year due to both Deron Williams and Carmelo Anthony being traded from the Western Conference to the Eastern and retaining their All-Star status in the latter, thus forcing two incumbent East players out. However, Bosh and the two following players had such meager All-NBA totals that it looks like they may have been booted from the team even if Melo and Williams hadn’t been traded cross-conference. That being said, I think Bosh suffered from some anti-Heat bias in this first season of the Heatles era. Bosh’s individual number understandably dropped now that he was sharing the ball with LeBron and Wade, but he still posted respectable per game numbers of 18/8/2 to go along with great advanced numbers and a 58–24 record for the Heat. Had Bosh not had the stigma of being a Heat player, I suspect he would’ve retained an All-Star spot with this resume.\n\nRay Allen (1 All-NBA vote) — Allen’s case isn’t as convincing as Bosh’s though. The Celtics were still very good and Allen continued to post great advanced numbers and legendarily efficient shooting splits, but his per game numbers dropped to 16/3/2.\n\nJoe Johnson (0 All-NBA votes) — Johnson’s per game numbers were slightly better than Allen’s at 18/4/4, but his team wasn’t as good at 44–38 and his advanced numbers were nowhere near as good as Allen’s, including a -5 net rating. Johnson also missed ten games and had some bad shooting percentages, so it isn’t surprising to see him lose his spot.\n\n2011 Western Conference Team\n\nPlayers with enough All-NBA votes to retain their All-Star selection: Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan, Kevin Durant, Pau Gasol, Manu Ginobili, Kevin Love, Dirk Nowitzki, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook\n\nPlayers Added to the End-of-Season Team:\n\nLaMarcus Aldridge (135 All-NBA votes, Third Team) — This was Aldridge’s fifth season in the league. He was already posting good per game averages of about 18/7/2 through his first few years in the league, his Blazers teams were already hovering around the 50-win threshold, and his efficiency and advanced numbers were already good, if not great. But in the 2011–12 season, Aldridge got a couple more minutes per game and a few more shots per game and his averages spiked to 21/9/2 as a result, and his advanced numbers improved as well. Likely due to this uptick, the All-NBA voters took note and Aldridge joins our hypothetical All-Star Team.\n\nZach Randolph (67 All-NBA votes, Third Team) — Randolph joined the hypothetical All-Star Team last season in his first campaign with the Grizzlies and both the team and Randolph improved this year to coalesce into a formidable power. Randolph averaged 20/12/2 per game with good advanced metrics.\n\nAndrew Bynum (9 All-NBA votes) — Bynum posted magnificent advanced numbers and the Lakers won 57 games on the season. However, Bynum played in just 54 total games and had pedestrian per game numbers of 11/9/1 and 2 blocks. Tyson Chandler was right behind Bynum in All-NBA voting this year and had a very similar resume but with far more games played, so I feel that Chandler may have been the better candidate to occupy the second All-Star center spot in the West this season, though Bynum’s inclusion is far from horrendous.\n\nPlayers Removed from the End-of-Season Team:\n\nBlake Griffin (36 All-NBA votes) — I complained a bit in the last section about Chris Kaman making the 2010 hypothetical All-Star Team over Chauncey Billups due to the center quota. A similar complaint could be made this year, albeit to a far lesser degree. Griffin, even as a rookie, was probably a better All-Star candidate than Bynum. Griffin averaged 22/12/4 per game with great advanced numbers and more games played. That being said, his Clippers were far worse than Bynum’s Lakers so an argument could be made that the Lakers were more deserving of a third All-Star next to Kobe and Pau than the Clippers deserving of even one.\n\nYao Ming (0 All-NBA votes) — Yao made the actual All-Star team through the fan vote but played in only five games on the season before ultimately retiring.\n\n2012 Eastern Conference Team\n\nPlayers with enough All-NBA votes to retain their All-Star selection: Carmelo Anthony, Roy Hibbert², Dwight Howard, LeBron James, Joe Johnson, Paul Pierce, Rajon Rondo, Derrick Rose, Dwyane Wade\n\nPlayers Added to the End-of-Season Team:\n\nTyson Chandler (60 All-NBA votes, Third Team) — The aura around Chandler and his defense following the Mavs’ title win in 2011 was palpable. Everyone loved Chandler, myself included. He won Defensive Player of the Year in 2012 and although his per game numbers appear mediocre, his advanced numbers were terrific.\n\nJosh Smith (33 All-NBA votes) — Smith was always on the cusp of an All-Star spot and it’s very possible that some bias against the player played a role in his never attaining All-Star recognition. That’s unfortunate, as although the criticism around his shot selection and occasionally oblivious attitude was not unfounded, he remained an impactful player for some very good Hawks teams. In an era of weak competition at forward in the East, Smith definitely should have made at least one All-Star game, so I’m glad to see him get one here. He averaged 19/9/4 per game for a 40–26 Hawks team (which was a .606 winning percentage due to the lockout) and posted some of the best defensive metrics in the league.\n\nKevin Garnett (22 All-NBA votes) — Both Garnett and the Celtics were beginning to trail off a bit at this point in time. Garnett’s per game numbers of 16/8/3 remained respectable and his advanced numbers are fine, but he was now in the space of a fringe All-Star as opposed to the no-brainer he was for most of his career.\n\nPlayers Removed from the End-of-Season Team:\n\nDeron Williams (14 All-NBA votes) — Based purely on per game averages, Williams’ 21/3/8 make him look like an All-Star. But his advanced metrics and team record reveal a player who wasn’t very impactful. The Nets were not good and Williams posted a -5 net rating.\n\nLuol Deng (5 All-NBA votes) — Deng was a thoroughly well-rounded player and a critical piece of an East-leading Bulls squad. I suspect that his comparatively low PPG total of 15.3 is what kept him off of many All-NBA ballots.\n\nChris Bosh (2 All-NBA votes) — I’m not sure what resulted in Bosh receiving so few All-NBA votes this year. His per game numbers remain good at 18/8/2, the Heat were still among the best in the league, he played most of the season, and his advanced numbers are very good. At surface level, he appears to be a more deserving All-Star pick than Garnett.\n\nAndre Iguodala (0 All-NBA votes) — This one bums me out. I can’t believe Iguodala didn’t get a single All-NBA vote! Removing Iguodala’s only All-Star nod feels very unfair, particularly since he had a very good case for inclusion this year. His defensive metrics were among the best in the league, his 76ers had a winning record, and his overall advanced numbers are great. However, like Deng, his scoring rate doesn’t jump off the page and this is likely what prevented his recognition. As such, his 12/6/5 per game averages may have been his doom.\n\n2012 Western Conference Team\n\nPlayers with enough All-NBA votes to retain their All-Star selection: LaMarcus Aldridge, Kobe Bryant, Andrew Bynum, Kevin Durant, Marc Gasol, Blake Griffin, Kevin Love, Dirk Nowitzki, Tony Parker, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook\n\nPlayers Added to the End-of-Season Team:\n\nAl Jefferson (30 All-NBA votes) — Big Al averaged 19/9/2 and posted strong advanced metrics for a Jazz team a bit above .500.\n\nPlayers Removed from the End-of-Season Team:\n\nSteve Nash (24 All-NBA votes) — Nash averaged 12/3/10 per game and, although he was still a very efficient scorer, his overall advanced numbers were starting to decline. That, in addition to the Suns hovering around .500, is what removed Nash from locked-in All-Star status this year.\n\n2013 Eastern Conference Team\n\nPlayers with enough All-NBA votes to retain their All-Star selection: Carmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh, Paul George, Kyrie Irving, LeBron James, Joakim Noah, Dwyane Wade\n\nPlayers Added to the End-of-Season Team:\n\nBrook Lopez (132 All-NBA votes) — Brook’s mammoth haul of 132 All-NBA votes shows that he was very well-regarded this year. He was unfortunate to miss out on both the actual All-Star Team and the All-NBA team. On a Nets squad boasting Deron Williams, Joe Johnson, and Gerald Wallace, Lopez was probably the team’s best player, averaging 19/7/1 with 2 blocks per game and strong advanced numbers and helping the team to 49 wins.\n\nAl Horford (31 All-NBA votes) — Horford’s effectiveness was often taken for granted, this year being no exception. The Hawks were good, Horford’s advanced numbers were good, and his per game numbers of 17/10/3 on strong efficiency were good. So in case it isn’t clear, prime Al Horford was good at basketball³!\n\nPaul Pierce (24 All-NBA votes) — Pierce persisted as an impactful player late in his career and although the Celtics were now just a .500 squad, Pierce continued to be an efficient scorer and posted per game averages of 18/6/5.\n\nDeron Williams (6 All-NBA votes) — Oddly, Williams was removed from last year’s hypothetical All-Star Team after posting good per game averages but with ugly advanced metrics for a bad team. Whereas this year, his per game numbers dropped a bit to 19/3/7 but his advanced numbers rebounded splendidly, the Nets rebounded to 49 wins, and Williams missed the actual All-Star team only to be added to the hypothetical one… almost an exact inverse of last year!\n\nRaymond Felton (3 All-NBA votes) — Yuck! This feels gross. Obviously, the competition among East guards was very weak this year. Paul George had made the actual All-Star Team as a guard but had to be switched to forward for our hypothetical teams following his All-NBA recognition at forward. This opened up an additional guard spot on our hypothetical teams for an already-depleted pool of talent. Felton is the lucky player to benefit. Felton was the fourth or fifth best player on an exciting Knicks team that was finally starting to piece things together around Carmelo Anthony. He averaged 14/3/5 per game, though his efficiency and advanced metrics are mediocre at best.\n\nPlayers Removed from the End-of-Season Team:\n\nTyson Chandler (19 All-NBA votes) — Chandler lost out on his All-Star center spot to Brook Lopez and Al Horford, but it feels so weird to have Felton on this hypothetical team representing the Knicks instead of Chandler. Chandler continued to average a double-double this season to go along with elite defensive metrics.\n\nLuol Deng (8 All-NBA votes) — Deng loses his second straight All-Star selection. Deng’s resume this year isn’t as strong as last year’s though, as his advanced metrics aren’t favorable and the Bulls were no longer the best team in the East following Derrick Rose’s injury\n\nKevin Garnett (8 All-NBA votes) — Garnett basically lost his All-Star spot to teammate Paul Pierce and I think that was the right call. Garnett’s individual averages, defense, and advanced metrics were no longer All-Star caliber at this point.\n\nRajon Rondo (1 All-NBA vote) — Rondo’s numbers were undeniably All-Star caliber but he played in just 38 games on the season and none following the All-Star break.\n\nJrue Holiday (0 All-NBA votes) — Jrue’s 17/4/8 per game averages are fine, but his advanced numbers are not good. His -8 net rating is particularly ugly.\n\n2013 Western Conference Team\n\nPlayers with enough All-NBA votes to retain their All-Star selection: Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan, Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin, James Harden, Dwight Howard, David Lee, Tony Parker, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook\n\nPlayers Added to the End-of-Season Team:\n\nMarc Gasol (292 All-NBA votes, Second Team) — Gasol won Defensive Player of the Year and the Grizzlies won 56 games. His 14/8/4 per game averages bely his playmaking impact. His defensive metrics were also among the best in the league.\n\nStephen Curry (72 All-NBA votes) — Curry was already shooting the lights out and posting absurd advanced numbers and uber-efficient shooting percentages, yet people (myself included) still hadn’t quite noticed how impactful Steph was becoming. At this point in time he was still more of a novelty or curiosity in the public eye than an MVP candidate, but he was clearly All-Star worthy at this point in retrosepct.\n\nPlayers Removed from the End-of-Season Team:\n\nLaMarcus Aldridge (62 All-NBA votes) and Zach Randolph (45 All-NBA votes) — Aldridge and Randolph surprisingly share many parallels. Although they entered the league at different points, they both arguably became stars at the same time in the early 2010s and anchored teams which were dark horse contenders and/or fan favorites. They posted similar per game numbers and had similar strengths and weaknesses. Interestingly, they both had dips in form in the 2012–13 season too. Aldridge’s per game numbers remained about the same at 21/9/2, but his advanced numbers dropped considerably and the Blazers dropped to 39 wins. Meanwhile, Randolph’s advanced metrics remained strong and the Grizzlies were better than ever, but he was struggling to recover his individual numbers following an injury-plagued 2011–12 campaign, finishing the season with 15/11/1 averages on subpar efficiency.\n\n2014 Eastern Conference Team\n\nPlayers with enough All-NBA votes to retain their All-Star selection: Carmelo Anthony, DeMar DeRozan, Paul George, Roy Hibbert, Kyrie Irving, LeBron James, Joe Johnson, Joakim Noah, Dwyane Wade, John Wall\n\nPlayers Added to the End-of-Season Team:\n\nAl Jefferson (191 All-NBA votes, Third Team) — Jefferson was finally beginning to get the attention he deserved as a star player in 2014. Jefferson never made the All-Star game in his career, but the Third Team All-NBA appearance is nice consolation. After surprisingly joining the Bobcats in free agency in the summer of 2013, he spurred a 22-win turnaround that got the team above .500 and averaged 22/11/2 along the way.\n\nKyle Lowry (29 All-NBA votes) — Despite being subject to rampant trade rumors, Lowry fully emerged as a star in 2014 and began to cement himself as a Toronto legend. His 18/4/7 per game numbers are fine, but his advanced numbers are terrific and the Raptors won 48 games.\n\nPlayers Removed from the End-of-Season Team:\n\nPaul Millsap (2 All-NBA votes) — Millsap was a fun role player in Utah prior to 2014 but he emerged as a valuable commodity in his first season in Atlanta in 2013–14. He was certainly good this year, averaging 18/8/3 per game, but he wasn’t yet a slam dunk All-Star choice.\n\nChris Bosh (1 All-NBA vote) — This exercise has not been kind to Chris Bosh, though I would argue that he was still All-Star caliber in the seasons prior to this one in which he lost an All-Star spot. However, it’s more difficult to argue his worthiness this season. The Heat remained very good, but Bosh’s individual numbers, both per game and advanced, dropped noticeably.\n\n2014 Western Conference Team\n\nPlayers with enough All-NBA votes to retain their All-Star selection:\n\nPlayers Added to the End-of-Season Team:\n\nGoran Dragic (115 All-NBA votes, Third Team) — I recall a lot of people feeling that Dragic was a big snub for the actual 2014 All-Star game so it makes sense that he wound up with a Third Team All-NBA selection and a spot on the hypothetical All-Star team as a result. He averaged 20/6/3 for a very fun Suns team and also shot the ball extremely efficiently and posted great advanced numbers.\n\nTim Duncan (63 All-NBA votes) — The Spurs rebounded from their heartbreaking Finals loss in 2013 to win 62 games in the 2013–14 campaign with Duncan continuing to anchor the team’s defense. Both his per game numbers and overall advanced metrics were beginning to slide a bit, but he remained extremely impactful on defense.\n\nPlayers Removed from the End-of-Season Team:\n\nAnthony Davis (40 All-NBA votes) and Dirk Nowitzki (37 All-NBA votes) — As good as Duncan was, I think both AD and Dirk have similarly strong cases for inclusion in his place. Davis’ Pelicans weren’t very good and he played just 67 games, but his per game numbers were much better than Duncan’s at 21/10/1 with 3 blocks, he had a much higher usage rate and a lot more attention from defenses, and he still posted great defensive numbers and better advanced numbers than Duncan. Meanwhile, Dirk averaged 21/6/2, shot extremely efficiently, helped the Mavs to 49 wins, and also posted amazing advanced numbers.\n\nKobe Bryant (0 All-NBA votes) — Kobe’ omission is due to his career-altering Achilles injury and his six total games played.\n\n¹ Both Carmelo Anthony and Deron Williams had made the actual All-Star Team in the West this season, but both are on the hypothetical East All-Star Team due to their mid-season trades in the month following the actual All-Star game. Interestingly, although Melo would have made the hypothetical All-Star Team in the West too had he not been traded, Williams actually would not have made the hypothetical West All-Star Team had he not been traded.\n\n² Deron Williams had more All-NBA votes than Hibbert but Hibbert retains his spot through the leveling formula I implemented for centers as noted in the opening post of this series. This is the seventh and final time that a center benefited from this formula.\n\n³ To be fair, the post-prime Horford that we’re still seeing in the modern NBA is still good too!"
