        "text": "point guard is back in the Pee Dee for his eighth annual at Mullins High School. The camp has evolved into four days of basketball, film sessions, and talks about how to become successful in life.\n\nMore than 130 kids have flocked to Felton's Camp at Mullins High. Felton and his staff are running the campers through drills and playing games inside the Mullins High gym.\n\nFelton, who won two Class A State Championships at Latta High, a two-time WPDE Mister Hoop Zone winner, and a National Championship at North Carolina, is coming off his most successful season in the NBA.\n\nWith Felton running the Knicks from his point guard postition, New York beat the Boston Celtics in the opening round of the playoffs. Indiana eliminated New York in the second round.\n\nFelton said he has learned over the years that the best way help young players improve in both basketball and in life is through discipline.\n\nOn Wednesday, Felton told the kids at his camp, \"I wasn't the best player around here coming up, but I worked every year, and I got better every year, and I had a goal, and I had a dream, and I wanted it. You gotta put in the time. Even to this day, I'm not the best player in the NBA, but I bust my behind every day, I work out every day, I work out to be the best I can.\"\n\nFelton's four-day camp will end on Thursday, June 20."
