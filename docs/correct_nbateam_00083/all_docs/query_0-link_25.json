        "text": "Before Wednesday, Raymond Felton had played a grand total of 15 minutes in five games this season.\n\nHe blew by that total in a hurry against the Denver Nuggets.\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks' veteran point guard made his first start of the season and played 29 minutes, scoring 10 points and dishing out five assists in relief of the injured Rajon Rondo, who was out with what is believed to be a minor left Achilles problem. Felton did not have a turnover.\n\nHe got to the rim a couple of times and worked the pick and roll and essentially showed that, if the situation arises, he's capable of contributing on this team on a regular basis.\n\n\"Still a little rusty, first game playing a lot of minutes, but it felt good,\" Felton said. \"I'm a professional. I'm on a great team. There's a lot of guys on this team that have been all-stars. Now we're all on one team. You're going to go through times when you're not going to play. I get that. I'm just happy to be on a good team.\"\n\nFelton missed the first two months of the season with a right ankle sprain and he tweaked it again on Wednesday late in the 114-107 loss to Denver.\n\n\"I like the way Felton plays,\" coach Rick Carlisle said. \"He's a very good player. He's definitely a rotation player and he'd start on a lot of teams. We're fortunate to have him. Unfortunately, he kind of tweaked his ankle. The thing you love about him is he's such a fighter that he got up, stayed in the game and knocked the free throws in and kept playing. He set a really good tone for us, even though he hasn't played much. He was ready to play.\"\n\nFelton said the ankle problem wasn't anything to worry about. He's resigned to the fact that his ankle is not going to be 100 percent this season.\n\n\"It's a little tweak,\" he said. \"It's a little sore, like it was going to be anyway. I was still able to keep playing, so I'm fine.\""
