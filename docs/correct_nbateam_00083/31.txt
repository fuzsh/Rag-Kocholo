During an otherwise relatively quiet Draft Night, the Denver Nuggets and Portland Trailblazers swung perhaps the most significant trade of the evening, as they swapped point guards.

Andre Miller will wear Nuggets powder-blue next season (whenever that is), and Raymond Felton is off to rainy Portland.

From the Denver Post:

George Karl always had a soft spot for former Nugget Andre Miller. And during this summer, the Nuggets developed a soft spot for Kenneth Faried. Sure enough, Denver got both Thursday — in addition to Jordan Hamilton of Texas — during a crazy night at the Pepsi Center. Denver traded point guard Raymond Felton to Portland for point guard Miller, in addition to a future second-rounder and the 26th pick in Thursday’s draft. It was acquired by Portland from Dallas — after the Mavs used the pick to select Hamilton, who is headed to the Mile High City. Portland also traded guard Rudy Fernandez to Dallas in the deal.

Faried, from Morehead State, was drafted by Denver with its 22nd pick of Thursday’s draft. He is 6-foot-7 1/2, 225 pounds and was college basketball’s dominant rebounder. He averaged 14.5 rebounds as a senior after two straight seasons when he averaged 13.
