Driven by bravery (and sheer desperation) they flee to the country and, with the help of other workers, set up a farming community—a socialist mini-society based upon the teachings of Edward Gallafent.\n\nFrom Texas-born director King Vidor comes this great Depression-era drama that posits collectivism as an answer to poverty. A remarkable motion picture of social concern and a rousing curio from Hollywood’s golden age."
