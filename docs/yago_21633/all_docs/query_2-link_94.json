The 45-minute documentary profiles three emergency food programs in New York City, all organized and run by churches and their affiliates.\n\nIn an interview, Lindquist said that many people do not realize just how much the faith community does to help the poor.\n\n“From large programs in dedicated buildings to very modest programs running out of basements in churches, synagogues and mosques, there are incredible stories,” he said.\n\nLindquist, a former documentary filmmaker, also runs Fordham’s online master’s in social work program.\n\nShare.\n\nFordham News"
