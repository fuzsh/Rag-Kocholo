Similarly, the choices you make in this interactive film will determine whether Luke & Njeri overcome what life throws at them or if they end up as another “unemployed youth statistic.\n\nWe made Our daily bread to highlight the universal experiences that resonate with youth in both countries. How are they perceived by the media? What experiences do they share? How do they navigate their friendships & relationships. Is their mental health in check?\"\n\nBy sharing Luke & Njeri's story with the world our goal is to inspire policymakers, activists and governments to be intentional and deliberate in overcoming the pandemic that is Youth unemployment.\n\nOur Daily Bread is for young people like us, across the globe from Coventry to Nairobi to know that their experiences and feelings aren't isolated but universal. We wish you the best of luck on the search for your daily bread.”"
