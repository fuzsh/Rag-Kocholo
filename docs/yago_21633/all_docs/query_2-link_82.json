        "text": "In Șerban Georgescu’s Our Daily Bread, the challenges of female employment in Romania come into sharp focus. With an emphasis on the resilience of the women within MamaPan, a Romanian artisan bakery located in its capital of Bucharest, the film sheds light on the systemic barriers that hinder women’s progress in the country’s labour market. Furthermore, it examines explicitly the intersectional experiences of Roma women, who continue to face compounded discrimination and marginalisation in the country.\n\nThrough personal narratives from its owner and employees, Georgescu invites audiences on an intimate journey into these women’s lives, revealing a determination to redefine destiny in a society marked by inequality as it ventures further and further from its communist past. As the bakery teeters on the precipice of closure, the diverse array of female protagonists emerges as beacons of strength and mutual support. From a formerly homeless woman reclaiming her identity (Luminița) to a Roma struggling with illiteracy (Adriana) to a mother of three grappling with financial burdens (Andreea), each epitomises the diverse array of challenges faced by women in the country. Delving into these personal struggles, Our Daily Bread is able to expose the broader societal issues surrounding gender dynamics.\n\nGender dynamics & Roma marginalisation\n\nLike virtually all countries, Romania grapples with ongoing gender inequality in the workplace, albeit the data isn’t all bleak. According to the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report 2022, the country ranks 90th in the world regarding overall gender equality. The report highlights persistent gender gaps in economic participation and opportunity, political empowerment, educational attainment, health, and survival. These disparities are deeply rooted in societal norms, cultural expectations, and structural barriers that hinder women’s advancement, with numbers exponentially increasing in rural communities. Moreover, across the country, women are often expected to juggle multiple roles, including caregiver, breadwinner, and household manager. This narrative approach leads to the film’s primary strength, exposing the paradoxical nature of Romania’s labour market.\n\nOn the other hand, according to Eurostat, in terms of the labour force, the 2023 Romanian gender pay gap stands at 3.6% — second in the EU only to Luxembourg. Additionally, according to BestJobs, women hold 34% of management positions, 3% higher than in the EU. Romania’s overall female labour force participation stands at 46.4%, also resulting in a #1 EU ranking.\n\nThe Roma community, one of the largest ethnic minority groups in the country, confronts entrenched discrimination and marginalisation (for those, like me, living in the country, the pandemic-era videos of police brutality and inhumanity against Roma continue to serve as an entrenched reminder of this reality). According to the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, Roma women in Romania face double discrimination based on both gender and ethnicity, including gender-based violence, restricted access to education and healthcare, and limited opportunities for socio-economic advancement. According to the Roma Health Report, Roma women in Romania also experience higher rates of infant mortality, lower life expectancy, and greater vulnerability to various health risks compared to non-Roma women. The report also states that Roma women hold an astronomical unemployment rate of 65% and are 10% more likely to be illiterate than Roma men. So, as those with foreign education assume employment with relative ease, those without possess virtually no tangible lifelines. In highlighting the experiences of Adriana, a Roma woman in MamaPan, Our Daily Bread acknowledges these dynamics firsthand, bringing attention to the intersecting forms of discrimination this marginalised group faces.\n\nAs the bakery teeters on the precipice of closure, the diverse array of female protagonists emerges as beacons of strength and support.\n\nCamaraderie\n\nBut it’s not all grim at MamaPan as the film also captures the camaraderie and mutual support among the women, illuminating the strength that emerges from collective empowerment. Through MamaPan’s bustling kitchen and the intricacies of bread-making, there is an element of Our Daily Bread that borders on the poetic, morphing into a sensory experience, sociocultural exploration, and a vivid reminder of the often unseen who form the bedrock of our society. With this, the bakery itself serves as a potent symbol — a place of sustenance, community, and encouragement.\n\nBut while Our Daily Bread successfully humanises the experiences of its subjects, it occasionally leaves the broader context of systemic issues in the shadows. Though interesting, organic, and honest, the film’s heavy focus on individual narratives may leave some longing for a more comprehensive examination of the socio-economic framework within which MamaPan operates. Its stories are all very personally specific. However, Georgescu’s juxtaposition of the warmth within MamaPan against the backdrop of social marginalisation reveals the stark contrast between the nurturing environment within the bakery’s walls and the judgmental societal norms that shape the outside lives of its employees.\n\nCatalyst for change\n\nOur Daily Bread can potentially serve to catalyse change (or, at least, awareness). Through its focused storytelling, the film is a solid look at the broader issues of female employment and discrimination against Roma women, compelling viewers to question the existing biases perpetuating inequality and social separation. Our Daily Bread is a testament to the unwavering spirit of the MamaPan women striving for a more equitable Romania."
