        "text": "Original Associated Exhibitors Title lobby card 11x14 Very Good Condition FLORENCE VIDOR\n\nFlorence Vidor was directed by her then husband King Vidor in this melodrama based on a novel by Henry Kitchell Webster. We believe the male on this card to be Clyde Fillmore. The caption on the card reads \"You're my wife, and I'm tired of this nonsense.\" The card is in very good condition. The upper right corner has a dog-ear crease. There is a tear on the right border, and some surface paper loss in the upper border area. This card could be very easily restored to present beautifully. RARE! MovieArt Original Film Posters in Austin, Texas guarantees this lobby card to be vintage, authentic, original. MovieArt Austin does not sell reproductions.\n\nKING VIDOR -\n\nFlorence Vidor - Actor"
