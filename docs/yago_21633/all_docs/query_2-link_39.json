        "text": "This documentary-installation piece by the Austrian film-maker Nikolaus Geyrhalter left me speechless. It is a compilation of coolly framed, static shots of hi-tech farming in various colossal bio-factories throughout Europe. Vast production lines of animals, and some plants and flowers, are shown being harvested in huge rows, seen from dizzying, vertiginous perspectives. Farmed salmon are slurped out of the water by giant hose contraptions, and then gutted, relentlessly, endlessly, by a machine whose workings are filmed with utter dispassion. The suspended bodies of pigs sway gently as they arrive, one after the other, at an unspeakable device that efficiently rips them open to remove their intestines; an act of repeated violence that reminded me of Macbeth's claim to have \"unseamed\" Malcolm \"from the nave to th'chops\".\n\nA sequence showing cows introduced one-by-one into a machine that will kill them, then turn them upside down for the carcass to be removed, is all but unwatchable, unbearable. Yet this is not presented as violent or even especially dramatic, and the movie does not invite tears, in the manner of Jamie Oliver or Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall. It is affectless; it juxtaposes the heartless treatment of animals with that of plants, and the chief emotion is awe. This is what agribusiness might look like on another planet, or what our agribusiness looks like, when viewed from another planet. It seems like fiction, like a mad set-dressing for some sci-fi nightmare inspired by Fritz Lang or Stanley Kubrick: and yet it is all real. I have never seen anything like it in all my life, and yet you and I put the results of it in our mouths every day."
