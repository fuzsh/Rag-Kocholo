        "text": "GRAND RAPIDS, Mich., Jan. 15, 2015 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- RBC Ministries announces that it will now operate around the world under the name Our Daily Bread Ministries, effective immediately.\n\nThe worldwide ministry will adopt the name of their flagship publication Our Daily Bread, one of the most widely used devotionals in the English language and available in more than 55 other languages. Non-English speaking affiliates will adopt the local language equivalent of the Our Daily Bread name.\n\nEven though the ministry distributes more than 60 million resources annually in over 150 countries, research showed public awareness of the RBC Ministries name was generally low compared to the well-known Our Daily Bread name.\n\n\"Since the launch of the Our Daily Bread devotional in 1956, we continue to be amazed at how God uses this resource to help millions of people around the world grow closer to Him,\" said Rick DeHaan, president of Our Daily Bread Ministries and grandson of founder Dr. M.R. DeHaan. \"The familiarity of this name will help our entire ministry better connect with people around the world and expand the reach of all our Bible-based resources.\"\n\nThis move consolidates the organization's numerous ministry efforts into a more singular, connected global presence. All ministry efforts of the organization, including Our Daily Journey, Discovery Series, Discover the Word audio, Day of Discovery video, Discovery House Publishers, and Christian University GlobalNet will share the same, new logo mark.\n\nIn addition to changing their name and adopting a single logo mark, Our Daily Bread Ministries will make several other changes. This will include a relaunch of more than 20 ministry websites, new video-based devotionals, improved mobile apps, and expanded ebook offerings that provide a more engaging experience with their full range of Bible-based resources.\n\n\"Although our name and logo is changing,\" said DeHaan, \"our focus remains the same: reaching out to people all around the world with the message of God's love.\"\n\nFor more information about the name change, visit www.ourdailybread.org/spread-the-word.\n\nAbout Our Daily Bread Ministries:\n\nOur Daily Bread Ministries is a nondenominational, nonprofit organization that distributes more than 60 million resources in 150 countries. Through print, radio, television, DVD, podcast, book, mobile app, and websites, Our Daily Bread Ministries encourages people to draw closer to God and helps them grow in their faith. Since 1938, Our Daily Bread Ministries has trusted in God above all else and relied on His wisdom and strength to guide their ministry.\n\nOur Daily Bread Ministries is not funded or endowed by any group or denomination.
