We follow several other people who have a connection to either the cooking show or the cookbook. They must all figure out how they will survive or get back home safely as the world is falling apart around them. They have to all decide whether they are going to just survive—or thrive—as they work to rebuild their communities. Those who thought they were prepared discover they really weren’t, and their shared faith is what gives them hope in a future …. without electricity.",

        "text": "Daily Bread is a satisfying post-apocalyptic drama centered around the aftermath of a catastrophic EMP (electromagnetic pulse) which wipes out all technology—including transportation and communication—and sends humanity into a tailspin. We find ourselves peeking into the lives of several different characters and groups as they process the disaster. Holly (Sandra Belforte) is a privileged woman living in urban Washington, D.C.; her sister Carol (Eliza Kelley) and her husband (Skip Lipman), however, are tried-and-true doomsday preppers. Holly scoffs at her sister’s eccentricities until she is faced with the reality Carol warned about. Briana (impressively portrayed by Brianna Tyson) is a confident prepper teenager who is eager to use her skills, but when she finds herself far away from the safety of camp, fear sets in. Tiffany McMillan (Francesca Finnerty) is the star of a popular cooking show; she along with her two sisters and their production crew (a total of seven “foodie” girls) are fortunately stranded at their family’s well-stocked farm, minus one crew member. Skylar (Katherine Caruso), their set designer, is left to fend for herself at a hotel in town, where she becomes an unlikely hero. Co-op teacher and prepper Rebecca (Ruth Wilson), her adult son Dan (Joseph Durbin), and his daughters, must band together in the face of an uncertain future.\n\nWriter and director Nina May has outdone herself with this completely fresh, utterly addictive, faith-based show. Each episode is paced perfectly; there is always enough storyline to keep you wanting more. Every character is intriguing, with personality and depth. It’s dark enough for the subject matter, but even as it tackles the gloom of humanity, it delivers comedic breaks, hopeful moments and important lessons. The theme of bread is dealt with consistently throughout the series, playing on the idea from the series’ name that what we take for granted one day may be vital tomorrow. What was important yesterday suddenly isn’t so important today. What was once a necessity is now a luxury. My favorite line of the series comes from episode three, in which a branch breaking outside scares the foodie girls, and Sophie McMillan (Shelia Avellino) observes that “we only heard it because there were no other sounds competing with it.” The EMP created widespread panic and chaos, causing the worst of humanity to reveal itself; but it also removed distractions and brought clarity. Only when there are no other competing sounds can we hear the truth of who we are, where our priorities lie, and who we could become. Daily Bread is the thought-provoking, entertaining, family-friendly drama you’ve been searching for. Daily Bread contains some mature themes such as death and a suicide attempt, as well as some mild violence and lots of gun usage; however, the mature content is handled very tastefully. For these reasons, it may not be appropriate for very young viewers. Therefore, we are pleased to award this captivating show the Dove Seal of Approval for Ages 12+. As always, use your best judgement according to your family’s convictions and sensitivities."
