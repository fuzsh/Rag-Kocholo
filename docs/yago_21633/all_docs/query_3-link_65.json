Contents are indispensable in modern society How livestock farming, agriculture, etc. that support 'food' how to \"manufacture\" food by advanced high tech technology and support the standard of living in modern society It has been taken.\n\nThere is no extra narration, etc., just the image of each industry is just taken from a fixed viewpoint. There are four trailers on the official website, but full of stuff just with the contents of this trailer ... .... Please be careful as some content can not be tolerated by some people.\n\nDetails of browsing and contents are from the following.\n\nOur daily bread - Home - Geyrhalterfilm\n\nThe trailer is from the following. There are four in all. Requires QuickTimePlayer.\n\nOur daily bread - TRAILER - Geyrhalterfilm\n\nScreened in Austria on April 12, 2006, screened in the United States on November 24, 2006, scheduled to screen in the Netherlands on January 4, 2007 and in Germany on January 18, 2007. Japan is undecided.\n\nAbout the contents, the following blog briefly touches it.\n\nSVP 2 - Blog | At the Amsterdam International Documentary Film Festival - How to make the belly of the maker\n\nA broiler production factory (a place that can be described as a \"factory\"), countless chicks sent on a belt conveyor. The staff wearing white clothes and stinking rolling chicks packed in the next box. An already dead chick is thrown off and thrown away in another box. While a myriad of chickens kept moving in indoor poultry farming places are wandering, trapped trucks are like big rubber balls, and they scrape roughly into chickens and pack them in a shipping box. The broiler caught in this way is put on a hook by a leg and is hung upside down, and this is carried again by the conveyor, and the neck is dropped and the wings are plucked. It is not a laughing matter, but it is exactly like a black joke as a broiler that has become naked goes around the factory side by side while being suspended from his feet. But it is so black that it can not be laughed at all from the fact that it is linked to our stomach because of reality. In such circumstances, \"Our Daily Bread\" will firmly capture the appearance that looks terribly, repeating upshot with a fixed camera. And the female staff who was sorting out the chick gently capture the bread in the canteen from directly in front of you. It seems that her state of silence and jealousy and uncomfortable appearance seems to be bad for the work she has done.\n\nIt seems to be quite intense content, but I feel like I'm going to be a very impressive movie.\n\nDec 05, 2006 14:29:00 in Video, Posted by darkhorse_log"
