        "text": "The petit bourgeouis Weber family lives in sectored Berlin after the Second World War and struggles to make ends meet. Karl Weber, an unemployed cashier, observes from a distance how his son Ernst and daughter Inge participate in the construction of a new socialist society. However, he cannot understand their vision and instead confides in his other son Harry, who is trying to obtain quick money through illicit business.\n\nThese two different life paths threaten to tear the family apart. But after Karl gets caught in one of Harry's schemes and sees the remarkable progress made by Ernst's factory, he realizes whose ideas can actually help the family build a new future."
