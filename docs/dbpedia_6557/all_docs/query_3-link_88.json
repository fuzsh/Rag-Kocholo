        "text": "BBC Comedy Short Films offer emerging talent the chance to bring their comedy ideas to life. This initiative provides writers, directors, and producers with a platform to develop and showcase new worlds and memorable comedy characters.\n\nThe first year saw significant success with Mobility winning the BAFTA for best short-form and Funboys being commissioned as a series for BBC Three. This year, the focus is on using the Short Film strand as a stepping stone for potential TV series. The aim is to allow talent to experiment and develop their work without the pressure of having every aspect of a possible future series fully mapped out.\n\nShort films should serve as a testing ground for dialogue, tone, character dynamics, and chemistry, with the goal of further development for television. The initiative continues to seek the best and most exciting comedy talent from around the UK.\n\nThe programme is currently prioritizing ideas that align closely with the genre brief, emphasizing comedy-first concepts with high gag rates and strong comic characters.\n\nDetails\n\nDuration: Short films should be around 10 minutes.\n\nBudget: Each film is set at a £100k tariff.\n\nAvailability: Current short films can be watched on BBC iPlayer, with new releases throughout the year.\n\nThis opportunity is open to UK-based production companies only; individual submissions are not accepted. The brief is rolling with no set deadline, so production companies can submit their ideas at any time.\n\nFor more info and to apply, head to: https://www.bbc.co.uk/commissioning/comedy/shortform/"
