        "text": "I was also going to suggest Ghosts, and if they‚Äôve ever watched Horrible Histories they‚Äôll recognise most of the actors.\n\nMy kids like the gone wrong series on IPlayer.\n\nFor films, Mitchell‚Äôs vs the Machines is very funny.\n\nThank you! We‚Äôve seen ghosts over and over. We love it!! We want more of the same but really struggling!\n\nAt that age mine liked Outnumbered, Father Ted and Blackadder.\n\nThere are some good older comedies on Brit Box - stuff like The Good Life, Porridge and ‚ÄòAllo ‚ÄòAllo.\n\nThe Fast Show is on iPlayer and is still funny.\n\nUpstart Crow is family friendly, I think.\n\nI loved little Britain and the Catherine Tate show at that age, well slightly younger, I was 8 and 9 when they came out. Possibly not what you are going for though.\n\noutnumbered, the inbetweeners (though possibly inappropriate in some people‚Äôs view), Friday night dinner.\n\nFather Ted might be a bit of a stretch for that age, depends how strongly you feel about ‚Äúfeck‚Äù and ‚Äúarse‚Äù.\n\nGhosts, but you‚Äôve already seen it!\n\nAt that age I was probably watching all the Croft and Perry shows, but they‚Äôre probably too dated for a modern 12yo!\n\nIm watching father ted with my nearly 10 year old. I prewatch so know if there are any problematic bits and we either skip episode or the scene. C4 has warnings on the episodes so just avoid the adult nature ones.\n\nAlso Blandings is a big hit. Its on britbox. When we finish S2 we are going to watch jeeves and wooster.\n\nBut my DDs fave? Death in paradise and murder she wrote.\n\nOoh I second Miranda, bleeped Taskmaster and outnumbered\n\nI'd be surprised if tweens understood the humour in The Office but happy to be proved wrong!\n\nWe loved Fawlty Towers at that age but might benefit from a pre watch like @mogtheexcellent with Father Ted (LOVE father ted)\n\nSome Mothers Do Ave Em is on iPlayer at the moment and I'm loving it! Never seen it before. Very silly\n\nRadio not TV but Cabin Pressure! Might be my favourite thing ever. Definitely tween appropriate and very British\n\nDS is 12 and loves comedy.\n\nHe‚Äôd second the recommendations of Miranda, The IT crowd, Friday Night Dinner, Citizen Kahn and Ghosts. Plus a hearty recommendation for ‚ÄòAllo ‚ÄòAllo and Dad‚Äôs Army. I think because they are period comedies they‚Äôve dated less than other shows (un-PC elements notwithstanding)\n\nI was so excited to show him Red Dwarf and it felt strangely dated. I don‚Äôt know why. Ditto One Foot in the Grave, which I loved back in the day."
