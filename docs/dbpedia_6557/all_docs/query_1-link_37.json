When jewel thief, Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro), takes a slight detour to London on route to delivering a huge stolen diamond to his boss in New York, he unwittingly sets off an avalanche of sinister and comic events that wind their way through the rough and tumble worlds of bare-knuckle boxing, Irish gypsies, pawn shops, pig farming and... a stray dog. Snatch, Guy Ritchie's brilliant follow up to his critically acclaimed Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, exposes us to his hip and helter-skelter view of London's gangster underbelly. Ritchie's characteristic fast-paced and constantly twisting story features a madcap ensemble cast of larger-than-life characters, including Jason Statham, an unlicensed boxing promoter; Stephen Graham, his bumbling Sidekick; Alan Ford, the local underworld kingpin; Dennis Farina, Franky's no-nonsense boss; Vinnie Jones, a legendary thug; Rade Sherbedgia, a psycho double-crossing Russian; and Brad Pitt, in a hilarious turn as a fast-talking gypsy bare-knuckle boxer.",

        "text": "As Ritchie's second feature film, Snatch is well done and shows inklings of the master craftsman he will eventually become.\n\nJuly 21, 2021\n\nIt is unquestionable that the script and direction are of an impressive level that places the filmmaker as one of the most eloquent writers and brightest narrators that emerged from the perfidious Albi√≥n in the last two decades. [Full Review in Spanish]\n\nApril 22, 2020\n\nWith this morbidly bouncy black comedy Ritchie finds a sneaky way to avoid sophomore slump: by passing his freshman tests all over again. And now for something completely different, please.\n\nMarch 6, 2018\n\nAn entertaining romp of a crime caper flick that wants to be funny more than it wants to be dangerous or mysterious.\n\nJune 22, 2017\n\nSnatch uses and abuses the template of its breakthrough predecessor, elevates it, and delivers an equal, if not better, version of a film we have all seen before, yet much better the second time around.\n\nJune 22, 2017"
