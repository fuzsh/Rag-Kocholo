        "text": "Alfie, British romantic comedy film, released in 1966, that featured a breakout performance from Michael Caine and caused a sensation with its frank depiction of casual sex.\n\nThe film—based on a radio play turned stage play turned novel—presents Alfie (played by Caine) as a streetwise, self-absorbed bloke who lives only to seduce and abandon as many women as possible. Although the birth of his child with a onetime lover (Julia Foster) fails to inspire him to settle down, his carefree ways are tempered when a woman (Vivien Merchant) with whom he has had a casual fling becomes pregnant and opts for an abortion. The film ends on an ambivalent note as Alfie encounters and is hurt by a woman (Shelley Winters) just as promiscuous as himself.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nAlfie became the definitive representation of the younger generation’s increasingly laid-back attitude toward sex in the 1960s. The narrative technique of having Caine’s character address the audience directly was hailed as innovative, and Caine’s performance, in the wake of his acclaimed work in Zulu (1964), helped to establish him as a leading man. In 2004 an American remake of the film was released, with British actor Jude Law in the title role."
