        "text": "Hot fuzz is a brilliant British comedy with laughs from start to finish with a sense of mystery and gore a perfect film with all aspects I love. The pace of the film is perfect not fast or slows with action at a slower pace because of the comedy it has with it. The story is amazing with a London officer being to good and violent for London and is moved to a small country side village, at first everything seems boring to the main protagonist played by Simon pegg. That soon changes as people start to die and are covered up every time as accidents. Simon peg later goes on to discover the village council are killing people off that don’t meet there standard to make the village the best they can. My favourite part about the film is when Simon peg returns to the town to meet back up with his police partner to take down the village council I love it because of its bad ass aspect but as well as it being done in a comedic way even though it’s a shoot up. I would recommend this film to anyone for its multiple genres in one and it very entertaining to anyone who would watch it.\n\nPrint this review"
