        "text": "If there's one thing that is truly subjective, it's comedy. Nothing worse than someone telling you you're about to watch ‘one of the best comedy films’ of all time just for you to barely muster a scoff out of politeness. But even so, there are some gems in the landscape of comedic film that are just undeniable. You'd be hard-pressed to find anyone, for instance, who wouldn't raise a chuckle at hearing “It's just a flesh wound”, from Monty Python and the Holy Grail, or “What is this? A centre for ants?” from Zoolander.\n\nComedy is a broad spectrum, from farce and satire to sketch and improv. Within that, also, are lots of different subgenres, like romcoms and action comedies. It's hard to mould it into any distinct form, which makes trying to make a list of some of the definitive funny films of our time a little bit of its own kind of farce. But hey, we'll try – because comedy is a serious business.\n\nHere are some of GQ's definitive best comedy films.\n\n22. Superbad (2007)\n\nEvery generation gets its new spin on a definitive classic high school comedy, the 80s got The Breakfast Club, the 90s had Clueless and the 00s had Superbad. Offering an alternative lens to the high school experience from the point of view of the nerds, Superbad made the bold move of making us hang out for an hour and a half with people that lowkey sucked. They're gross, morally ambiguous and more than a little bit annoying. If that's not the high school experience in a nutshell, I don't know what is. It's impossible to state how, at one point, McLovin was simply the funniest something could be. You can watch Superbad on Netflix.\n\n21. Easy A (2010)\n\nWelcome to the stage, Emma Stone. The first lead role for the actress who had been knocking up scene-stealing parts in the likes of Superbad and The House Bunny, Easy A is a breath of comedic fresh air. It's a heightened look at the high school experience based on The Scarlett Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne, where rumours rule the roost and reputational downfall is contingent on a rogue hook-up. Any mention of Easy A isn't complete, however, without mentioning Stanley Tucci and Patricia Arquette who are contenders for the best parents to ever be played on screen, with the kind of easy quirk that manages to not fall into millennial cringe. Easy A also marks the true start of the era of Tucci thirst. We owe it so much! You can watch Easy A on Netflix.\n\n20. Borat! Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (2006)\n\nDepending on where you fall on the line of cringe comedy, you either love or absolutely hate Borat. For the UK, Sacha Baron Cohen's blundering Kazakh journo was just another persona following the highs of Ali G. To Americans, where Borat's escapades take place, he was a menace, a plague, a nuclear bomb of disruption (and not just from the influx of “My wiiiiiiife”) that came immediately after its release. In the film, Cohen poses as a roving reporter traversing the states, meeting real-life Americans along the way who have no idea they're actually being stitched up for what will end up being a culturally defining movie – whoops! If you're not a fan of people being made the butt of the joke, Borat will be slow, catchphrase-filled torture. But that's what comedy is – divisive! And, whatever your vibe, you have got to at least respect the absolute cojones on Cohen to commit to the bit. You can watch Borat on Disney+.\n\n19. The Great Dictator (1940)\n\nIt's easy to look back now and think that a comedy tearing apart the machinations of Hitler and the Nazis was easy pickings, but for Charlie Chaplin to so overtly point a laughing finger at the leader in 1940, just a few years after his ascension to power, was a bold move. It's an even braver choice still when you consider this was Chaplin's first true sound film after dominating the silent screen. But as the reigning king of comedy, a title that he still holds as a legacy today, if he couldn't do it nobody could. Taking on two roles in the film, it's a biting mix of farce and political satire, a cocktail only Chaplin could shake up to perfection. You can watch The Great Dictator on Amazon.\n\n18. Mean Girls (2004)\n\nVery few true teen comedies stand the test of time – culture changes, humour evolves, jokes tarnish with age – but Mean Girls is like a fine wine, even with its more problematic noughties hallmarks. With Tina Fey, who was riding high as one of the definitive saviours of SNL at the time, at the helm, the dialogue is sharp and biting - just try not to shout “She doesn't even go here!” along with it. Lindsay Lohan is a magnetic presence on screen, something often lost in the conversation around her, while Amanda Seyfried, Rachel McAdams and Lacey Chabert are a perfect comedic cohort. You can watch Mean Girls on Amazon.\n\n17. Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery (1997)\n\nThe farce-fuelled renaissance of the 90s gave us slapstick comedy with a side-portion of balls-out bro humour. These weren't your nana's Carry On movies – they were, first and foremost, stupid films aimed at younger audiences who found nothing funnier than a nut punch. Mike Myers, Gen X king of clowning, introduced us to Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery, a riff on suave 60s spy classics of the 60s. After the titular Powers is cryogenically frozen in his swinging heyday, he's warmed back up in the 90s, facing a clash of cultural sensitivities. But while he blunders through casual misogyny and horndog antics, he has to take down a villain - Dr. Evil, who Myers also plays. In all honesty, Austin Powers is a little rough to watch now as its jokes are so hit-and-miss. But when they hit, oh do they hit baby, yeah! You can watch Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery on Amazon.\n\n16. Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping (2016)\n\nMovies to come out of the SNL cast over the years have been hit and miss, to say the least, but if anyone was going to ace the assignment it was The Lonely Island, who had such a finger on the pulse of a digital youth that their filmed sketches revitalised the show forever. Tapping into the 2010s boom in popstar documentaries, Andy Samberg's Conner4Real is the amalgamation of Justin Bieber and Justin Timberlake from hell. With digs at Macklemore, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga and Kanye West, every pixel of the screen is dripping in some kind of referential observational humour, taking it to the extreme as every good Lonely Island product does. Mixed with bops that have no business being as catchy as they are and more familiar faces than you can count, Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping is a relic of millennial humour that somehow stands the test of time. You can watch Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping on Amazon.\n\n15. Office Space (1999)\n\nIt's weird that a film about mundane capitalism in the late 90s can feel so dated and novel in the cold light of 2024, but with our perception of work post-pandemic all but dismantling the drudgery of office cubical work, a film like Office Space takes new shape as a nostalgic curiosity. The film is a layered piece, weaving in a story about unending hypnosis with corporate fraud, but the crux of it is that working sucks, man. Being micromanaged by your lame boss sucks and being confined to a soulless grey sucks too. Office Space is the peak example of a cult hit. After launching in box office flop territory, its DVD release and late-night Comedy Central syndication made it a Gen X working man's creed. You can watch Office Space on Disney+.\n\n14. The Birdcage (1996)\n\nA remake of the musical La Cage aux Folles, The Birdcage takes the straight man vs the funny man trope and doubles it, literally. Any list of comedies without an appearance from Robin Williams would be sacrilegious, an unparalleled talent who never managed to go too big despite being absolutely enormous in everything he did. The Birdcage is a film of a bygone era, propped up by stereotypes that, at best, seem charmingly kitsch and, at worst, sometimes veer troublesome. But it's a film with such a big heart that it's impossible to weigh too heavily on its flaws. You can watch The Birdcage on Amazon.\n\n13. Dr Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964)\n\nStanley Kubrick isn't exactly known as a laugh-a-minute kind of director, but it's remarkable that every genre he tried his hand at – science-fiction, horror, melodrama – all somehow managed to be the best versions of those things. His go at comedy, Dr Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, is classic Kubrick in that it's wildly cinematic and just that tiny bit inaccessible. Much like Chaplin's The Great Dictator, Kubrick situates his comedy in the throws of war, this time a nuclear holocaust. As black comedy as black comedy can come, it's arguably one of his greatest works, which is possibly the highest praise it could ever get. You can watch Dr. Strangelove on Amazon.\n\n12. Blazing Saddles (1974)\n\nSome of the best comedies to come out of Hollywood are the ones that can poke fun at themselves, and Mel Brooks knows exactly how to chew up and spit out the Hollywood machine in the most slapstick of ways. Blazing Saddles is a satire of the American West and just how white Hollywood loved to make it. Told from the perspective of the first Black sheriff in a white town, it's raunchy, vulgar, wading thigh-high into bad taste and, at times, almost cringing in its throw-anything-at-the-wall humour. But even so, propped up by the likes of Gene Wilder and Cleavon Little, it's a bonafide comedy classic for a reason. You can watch Blazing Saddles on Amazon.\n\n11. Shawn of the Dead (2004)\n\nMixing comedy and horror is like bringing a pot of custard to a boil, done correctly it goes down smoothly but without a deft hand it can curdle into something neither funny nor scary. The silkiest custard ever, then, is Shaun of the Dead, one of the definitive benchmarks of the genre. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost somehow made a parody of the zombie one of the best zombie movies of all time. The film takes the survivalist trope into new territory by making it painfully relatable. Sure, we probably all would love to be a hero but, let's be honest, if zombies came to eat our brains tomorrow we'd probably choose to hide out in a pub or cover up a bite for fear of being a nuisance too. You can watch Shaun of the Dead on Amazon.\n\n10. Withnail and I (1987)\n\nSometimes, the best comedy is infused with tragedy. Withnail and I is a tableau of poverty, alcoholism and listlessness wrapped up in two eternally iconic characters – Withnail (Richard E. Grant) and Marwood (Paul Gann) – for multiple generations of cinema watchers. The pair are out-of-work actors finding solace and something close to purpose at the bottom of a bottle. They waffle through their days making terrible choices while alienating everyone around them and see others as a potential meal ticket. There's a sense of ambition still left in Marwood, who seems to have a finger's grip on reality, whereas Withnail is destined for a life destroyed by his vices. Doesn't sound like cheery stuff and, to be clear, it's not. But there's humour in their desperation, a particularly British sensibility of taking the piss when everything is undeniably pretty grim. You can watch Withnail and I on Amazon.\n\n9. When Harry Met Sally (1989)\n\nRomcoms get a bad rap when it comes to comedy lists, mostly because people often forget the whole ‘com’ aspect of them. It's tricky, especially since some weigh more heavily on the romantic aspect with just a few quips thrown in here and there. But perhaps the best romcom of all time – When Harry Met Sally – finds itself at the apex of most lists of the genre because its comedy offerings are just as impressive as its schmaltz. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan are the ultimate romantic duo, posing the age-old question of ‘Can men and women just be friends?’. In this instance, the answer is no, but to get there, they endure more than a decade of getting to know each other's quirks before figuring it out. We should all want more of what When Harry Met Sally is having! You can watch When Harry Met Sally on Amazon.\n\n8. Ghostbusters (1984)\n\nWho ya gonna call? We don't even need to say the name. When a song and costume from a film is almost as culturally relevant now as it was almost 40 years ago when it was released, you know you have a defining classic on your hands. A sci-fi-comedy with a heavy lean towards comedy, Ghostbusters is a nostalgia fest that doesn't need to rely on its childhood fondness to remain relevant. With comedy chops from Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson, it's an underdog story of goofs vs ghouls. A great example of just how good the film is can be gleaned from the fact that countless sequels and remakes have tried to emulate its success and none have even come close to its magic. You can watch Ghostbusters on Netflix.\n\n7. Groundhog Day (1993)\n\nYou can't beat the OG time loop movie – Groundhog Day, truly the best to ever do it. Bill Murray, who really had the most stellar run for a while, plays a disillusioned local TV host who ends up re-living the same day ad infinitum until he learns the value of being selfless. Waking up to the same Sonny and Cher song every day may get old, but thankfully watching Groundhog Day never manages to. You can watch Groundhog Day on Netflix.\n\n6. Zoolander (2001)\n\nThe late 90s and early 00s brought a new comedic force to the forefront, The Frat Pack. A playful spin on the 80s cohort, it was a carousel of actors who frequently collaborated with each other to make some kind of microcosm of bro humour. Leaders of the pack were Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson who supercharged their cultural dominance with Zoolander, a film that takes aim and the vapid world of male models. It's absurd in the most deliciously early 00s way, an era where it felt like no money was being spared to parody as many things as possible. The quotes still hit (\"What is this? A centre for ants?!), the cameos still shock (hey David Bowie!) and the blue steel is still as striking as ever. Listen to your friend Billy Zane, and watch this movie. You can watch Zoolander on Amazon.\n\n5. Airplane! (1980)\n\nThe spoof comedy has had many maestros, from the Marx brothers to Mel Brooks. Their conceit is simple: take an iconic property and inject mile-a-minute absurdity into them. Many have faired well, but none quite so much as Airplane!, which riffed on the 70s Airport series of disaster films. The comedy boards us on a Chicago-bound LA flight where everything from farcical food poisoning to inflatable auto-pilots materialises. The film keeps the bare bones of its melodramatic inspiration weaved throughout, which makes its frequent dip into the silly all the more hilarious. Many comedies from 40 years ago don't stand the timeless test, and in many ways, Airplane! doesn't either (it has its fair share of racially insensitive jokes). But just the sheer number of jokes and bits - far too many to even try to count! - surely keep it in the air (don't call it Shirley). You can watch Airplane! on Amazon.\n\n4. Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1974)\n\nFrankly, if a Monty Python wasn't included on this list we'd have to turn ourselves in for crimes against boomer nostalgia. But having said that, despite it being the epitome of a ‘you couldn't get away with this these days' example against sensitive snowflakes, it is very, very funny. Although they had a series and just a handful of features to their name, Monty Python feel so ubiquitous to the landscape of British comedy you'd be forgiven for believing they were pumping a steady stream of content like an assembly line. Monty Python and the Holy Grail took us into the world of an Arthurian legend and is, plain and simple, a masterpiece. From the one-liners to the songs to the ridiculous surrealism, it launched Monty Python into a legend status of their own. You can watch Monty Python and the Holy Grail on Netflix.\n\n3. Bridesmaids (2011)\n\nEnough girlbosses, it's time for girl-losers. Absolute girl-failures beyond measure. Enter Bridesmaids and Kristen Wiig's overnight ascension into the history books of defining comedy voices. As we said, SNL alum films have hit and miss, but none have hit harder than Bridesmaids. The film touches on very real and unique relationships between women, especially in the sensitive times around weddings, bringing together friendship groups and feeling like you're moving at a different pace than everyone else. Impossible to overstate just how much of a wave Bridesmaids made in 2011, one that is still being felt today. You can watch Bridesmaids on Amazon.\n\n2. Some Like It Hot (1959)\n\nSo much of our comedic output and sensibilities can be traced back to the golden era of 1950s screwball comedy, and one that stands head and shoulders above the rest is Some Like It Hot. Starring Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis as a pair of crime witnesses forced to disguise themselves as women to join an all-female band and escape the mob. It's a classic sex comedy, an ‘oooer’ in film form thanks to a flirty performance from Marilyn Monroe and the swarthy charm of Curtis. Monroe is positively luminous in the role of the oblivious bombshell, a talent that's, sadly, still barely mentioned in the conversation of her legacy. You can watch Some Like It Hot on Amazon.\n\n1. Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004)\n\nNews team, assemble! It's probably never best to judge a film's lasting merit on how well it went down with teenage boys at the time of its release, but despite the absolute biological and chemical warfare it committed on a generation of younguns, Anchorman is more than the sum of its quotes (although they are great). Even though he had been the undisputed king of SNL, the film cemented Will Ferrell as a comedy superstar and gave us a new evolution of the frat pack that included Paul Rudd and Steve Carrell. The 00s loved parody and making the mundanity of something ludicrous, case and point the life of 1970s newsreaders in San Diego. The film is so, so stupid. Just absolutely idiotic and silly and, still, it's completely balanced. It's a good thing they never tainted its legacy with an awful sequel, huh? You stay classy, San Diego. You can watch Anchorman on Amazon."
