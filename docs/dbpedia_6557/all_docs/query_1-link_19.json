        "text": "Pulford, more well known as \"Brick Top”, is a ruthless gangster. He runs a criminal operation built on Betting on Unlicensed Fights. Whenever people fail him, he feeds them to his man-eating pigs.\n\nSection heading[]\n\nBrick Top is an unlicensed boxing promoter. He also arranges betting on almost every possible thing, such as dog fights.\n\nBrick Top is an expert on the subject of getting rid of dead bodies. He has the body cut into six pieces, then pulls the hair and teeth out for the sake of the pig's digestion.\n\nHe likes to use at least sixteen pigs to go through the job in one sitting, as they will go through a body that weighs two hundred kilograms in about eight minutes. Hence the expression \"As greedy as a pig.\"\n\nIt is rumoured that Brick Top's favourite means of disposal include a stun gun, a plastic bag, a roll of tape, and 16 hungry pigs. Also putting traitors in a sack and holding saws at their neck is a favourite way of interrogation."
