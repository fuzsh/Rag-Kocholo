        "text": "Dark Humor Definition\n\nWhat makes the best dark comedies?\n\nSome of the movies on this list don't really set out to be dark comedies, but they still make us laugh at things that are truly unfortunate or just plain sad.\n\nSome of the best movies in existence are dark comedies, and they are often built on cynical representations of otherwise dramatic subjects.\n\nOther times, they are films that make us laugh despite being rather accurate representations of society or powerful institutions.\n\nDark Comedy Definition\n\nWhat is dark comedy?\n\nDark comedy, black comedy or black humor is a sub-genre of comedy where commonly objectionable topics and events are used in a satirical manner as a source of humor in a narrative work. A dark comedy can be a movie, TV show, novel, podcast, or any other form of narrative art.\n\nDark comedies intend to make light of events that would otherwise be considered too painful to discuss. The hope is that viewers will gain a cathartic experience, or simply laugh at some absurd situation.\n\nYou will probably disagree with this list in one way or another. Maybe you don’t think a particular film should be considered a dark comedy.\n\nWe drew a very simple line...\n\n“Do the tragic events on screen make us laugh throughout the film?”\n\nIf the answer was, “yes”, then the film was considered for our list.\n\nWe’ve defined dark humor, so here’s our list of the best dark comedies.\n\nBest Dark Comedy Movies\n\n1. Fargo\n\nThe Coen Brothers created this dark comedy about greed and inferiority. The filmmaking techniques in this movie are some of the best ever, and worth study. Highly human, and a great protagonist. Oh yeah? Ah jeez.\n\nFargo | Truecoat\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “Jerry Lundegaard's inept crime falls apart due to his and his henchmen's bungling and the persistent police work of the quite pregnant Marge Gunderson.”\n\nBest Black Comedies\n\n2. American Psycho\n\nMuch like the novel by Bret Easton Ellis, this dark comedy movie directed by Mary Harron shows us that just because we're following a serial killer doesn’t mean the story has to be all gore and gloom.\n\nHold onto you funny bone for this dark comedy. Sorbet?\n\nAmerican Psycho Business Card Scene • Subscribe on YouTube\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “A wealthy New York City investment banking executive, Patrick Bateman, hides his alternate psychopathic ego from his co-workers and friends as he delves deeper into his violent, hedonistic fantasies.”\n\nList of Dark Comedy Films\n\n3.Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\n\nStanley Kubrick directed one of the earliest and truly one of the best dark comedies ever. You can't get much darker than nuclear war, and Kubrick filmed this movie made a single war room cinematic.\n\nDr. Strangelove | Total Commitment\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “An insane general triggers a path to nuclear holocaust that a War Room full of politicians and generals frantically try to stop.”\n\nBest Black Humor Movies\n\n4. Fight Club\n\nThis dark comedy directed by David Fincher could be considered a lot of different things, like one of the greatest films of all time, but it has the great ability to make you laugh at just pure violence.\n\nI haven't laughed like that since grade school.\n\nFight Club | I Wan't You To Hit Me\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “An insomniac office worker and a devil-may-care soap maker form an underground fight club that evolves into something much, much more.”\n\nBest Dark Comedies\n\n5. Pulp Fiction\n\nThis dark comedy from Quentin Tarantino took the classic crime stories and gave them a twist. Adrenaline shots to the heart, burning pop-tarts, samurai swords, gimps, and speed bumps pave the way for this dark comedy movie that changed cinema forever.\n\nPulp Fiction | Ready, Honey Bunny\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “The lives of two mob hitmen, a boxer, a gangster's wife, and a pair of diner bandits intertwine in four tales of violence and redemption.”\n\nList of Dark Comedy Films\n\n6. Burn After Reading\n\nThe Coen Brothers are mainstream filmmakers with a dark sense of humor who make dark comedies like no one else. this dark comedy begins like a John Le Carre spy novel but quickly becomes one of the best dark comedy movies of all time.\n\nBurn After Reading | Osbourne Is Out\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “A disk containing mysterious information from a CIA agent ends up in the hands of two unscrupulous and daft gym employees who attempt to sell it.”\n\nBest Dark Comedy Movies\n\n7. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\n\nTerry Gilliam can be considered a surrealist filmmaker, and each of his movies has a rich psychological theme attached. This dark comedy is centered around Hunter S. Thompson on assignment in Las Vegas.\n\nFear and Loathing in Las Vegas | Somewhere Around Barstow\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “An oddball journalist and his psychopathic lawyer travel to Las Vegas for a series of psychedelic escapades.”\n\nList of Dark Comedy Movies and TV Shows\n\n8. The Big Lebowski\n\nThe Coen Brothers attack with one of the greatest comedy films of all time. Quite possibly their best film overall. Think this film should be number one on our dark comedy movie list?\n\nYou know what I say? Mark it zero.\n\nThe Big Lebowski | I'm The Dude\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “Jeff \"The Dude\" Lebowski, mistaken for a millionaire of the same name, seeks restitution for his ruined rug and enlists his bowling buddies to help get it.''\n\nBest Dark Comedy Movies\n\n9. O Brother, Where Art Thou?\n\nThe Coen Brothers show up again with this dark comedy movie that is an adaptation of Homer’s Odyssey. The Coens take one of the earliest stories in history and ask “What if it was meant to be a dark comedy?”\n\nO Brother, Where Art Thou? | Your Truly\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “In the deep south during the 1930s, three escaped convicts search for hidden treasure while a relentless lawman pursues them.”\n\nBest Dark Comedies\n\n10. In Bruges\n\nMartin McDonagh broke onto the scene with this dark comedy. The entire movie is an essay on good, bad, heaven, hell, purgatory... and Bruges. It has definitely earned a place on our list of the best dark comedy movies.\n\nIn Bruges | A Lollipop Man\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “Guilt-stricken after a job gone wrong, hitman Ray and his partner await orders from their ruthless boss in Bruges, Belgium, the last place in the world Ray wants to be.”\n\nBest Dark Humor Films\n\n11. Very Bad Things\n\nThis dark comedy from Peter Berg is one of the best. The rhythm of the edit, the camera movement, and the use of every department to support the theme of dark comedy show why this film is such a classic.\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “A prostitute is killed during a bachelor party and the attendees turn on each other as the wedding approaches.”\n\nList of Black Comedy Films\n\n12. The Death of Stalin\n\nStalin’s death is far from tragic, but this dark comedy from Armando Iannuci shows us the mad dash for power in a struggling Soviet Union, and how the passing of a “great leader” is a comedy-rich subject.\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “Moscow, 1953. After being in power for nearly 30 years, Soviet dictator Josef Stalin takes ill and quickly dies. Now the members of the Council of Ministers scramble for power.”\n\nBest Dark Comedy Movies\n\n13. Snatch\n\nThe dark comedy directed by Guy Ritchie showed the world how Ritchie commands tone in his films, and much like Wes Anderson or The Coen Brothers, he can jump back and forth more effectively than most.\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “A disk containing mysterious information from a CIA agent ends up in the hands of two unscrupulous and daft gym employees who attempt to sell it.”\n\nBEST DARK COMEDIES\n\n14. Falling Down\n\nThe dark comedy directed by Joel Schumacher is one of those $25 million dollar films you wish Hollywood would still make. The opening scene may be one of the greatest examples of sound design and emotion.\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “An unemployed defense worker frustrated with the various flaws he sees in society, begins to psychotically and violently lash out against them.”\n\nList of Dark Comedy Films\n\n15. Birdman\n\nThe dark comedy directed by Alejandro G. Inarritu not only won the Academy Award for Best Picture, but it also made a lot of people laugh at violence, sexual harassment, and Broadway. Dark stuff my friends.\n\nBirdman\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “A washed-up superhero actor attempts to revive his fading career by writing, directing, and starring in a Broadway production.”\n\nBest Dark Comedy Movies\n\n16. The Grand Budapest Hotel\n\nWes Anderson’s dark comedy about a hotel concierge wrongly accused for the murder of his elderly lover may be Anderson’s best film yet. Wes Anderson is a true auteurist filmmaker, and a funny one at that.\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “The adventures of Gustave H, a legendary concierge at a famous hotel from the fictional Republic of Zubrowka between the first and second World Wars, and Zero Moustafa, the lobby boy who becomes his most trusted friend.”\n\nBest Dark Comedies\n\n17. Death to Smoochy\n\nThis dark comedy directed by Danny Devito boasts a really great cast and a great premise. You need directors like Danny Devito who find the comedy in the greed that surrounds children’s entertainment.\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “A kids show host, Rainbow Randolph, is fired in disgrace while his replacement, Sheldon Mopes, aka Smoochy the Rhino, finds himself a rising star. Unfortunately for Sheldon, the business of kids television isn't all child's play.”\n\nList of Dark Humor Films\n\n18. The Lobster\n\nYorgos Lanthimos directed this dark comedy before The Favourite, and his tone, location, and performances from his actors cement this as one of the best dark comedy movies that really leans into the dark comedy definition.\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “In a dystopian near future, single people, according to the laws of The City, are taken to The Hotel, where they are obliged to find a romantic partner in forty-five days or are transformed into beasts and sent off into The Woods.”\n\nBest Dark Comedy Movies\n\n19. The Cable Guy\n\nThis dark comedy directed by Ben Stiller follows a normal guy with some mild bravery issues, and a social outcast raised by television. This film is a really great example of how to humanize your antagonist.\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “A lonely and mentally disturbed cable guy raised on television just wants a new friend, but his target, a designer, rejects him, with bad consequences.”\n\nBest Dark Comedies\n\n20. Hot Fuzz\n\nHot Fuzz is the best of the dark comedy movies directed by Edgar Wright, because it is both the darkest and the funniest. This movie may, at times, be a parody of other films... but Wright has reinvented comedic cinema.\n\nHot Fuzz\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “A skilled London police officer is transferred to a small town with a dark secret.”\n\nList of Dark Comedy Films\n\n21. God Bless America\n\nAnother dark comedy from Bobcat Goldthwait that shows, very clearly, what the definition of dark comedy means. Very rarely will you find yourself cheering on the exact person we hate to see in the news.\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “On a mission to rid society of its most repellent citizens, terminally ill Frank makes an unlikely accomplice in 16-year-old Roxy.”\n\nBest Dark Comedy Movies\n\n22. Raising Arizona\n\nThis is one of the first dark comedies from The Coen Brothers, and it is one of the more sadistic to boot. Nick Cage is great, The Coens really dipped into stylistic filmmaking that they scale back for later films, but never lose.\n\nRaising Arizona\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “When a childless couple of an ex-con and an ex-cop decide to help themselves to one of another family's quintuplets, their lives become more complicated than they anticipated.”\n\nList of Dark Comedy Films\n\n23. American Beauty\n\nSam Mendes directs this dark comedy that proved to producers that he could handle other laugh riots like... Road to Perdition, Jarhead, Revolutionary Road and a few James Bond movies. Stars Kevin Spacey.\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “A sexually frustrated suburban father has a midlife crisis after becoming infatuated with his daughter's best friend.”\n\nBest Dark Comedy Movies\n\n24. Thank You For Smoking\n\nJason Reitman directs this dark comedy that defends the world of big tobacco or at least one human behind big tobacco. He uses cinema and cutaways in a very clever way to add the necessary style to this movie.\n\nThank You for Smoking\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “Satirical comedy follows the machinations of Big Tobacco's chief spokesman, Nick Naylor, who spins on behalf of cigarettes while trying to remain a role model for his twelve-year-old son.”\n\nBest Dark Comedies\n\n25. Election\n\nAlexander Payne directs this dark comedy about a high school class election and shows why he is one of the best American comedy directors working today. Payne would then direct Sideways and The Descendants.\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “A high school teacher's personal life becomes complicated as he works with students during the school elections, particularly with an obsessive overachiever determined to become student body president.”\n\nList of Dark Comedy Films\n\n26. Trainspotting\n\nDanny Boyle directs this dark comedy that took junkie culture and made it both funny and a bit hard to watch… so I guess that’s just junkie culture. Double feature this with Requiem for a Dream for a fun night.\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “Renton, deeply immersed in the Edinburgh drug scene, tries to clean up and get out, despite the allure of the drugs and the influence of friends.”\n\nBest Dark Comedy Movies\n\n27.

A Clockwork Orange\n\nStanley Kubrick directs one of the more fringe dark comedies on this list, not because of the subject matter, but rather the approach.

Shaun of the Dead\n\nEdgar Wright directs this dark comedy that shows the early signs of a true auteur. This film would lead to another dark comedy, Hot Fuzz.

A put-upon momma's boy wants his mother dead. Who will pull it off?”\n\nBest Dark Comedy Movies\n\n39.

He takes on a job with a crazed passenger, whose sought-after ledger implicates some seriously dangerous criminals.”\n\nBest Dark Comedy Movies\n\n47. Observe and Report\n\nThis dark comedy from Jody Hill shows us Seth Rogen at his darkest.
