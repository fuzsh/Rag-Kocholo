        "text": "A Snatchblock is constructed in such a way that reeving is easy, because one of the side plates can be opened. Any end connection of the wire will therefore not have to be taken off. The eye of the Snatchblock fits on the standard D-shackle or bow shackle.\n\nThe heavy duty models of our Snatchblocks are available with a sheave diameter of 6 to 46 inches and a wire diameter of between 22 and 93 mm. Due to the heavy duty construction, they are very suitable for e.g. offshore operations. Our Snatchblocks are also available with the accompanying shackle included.\n\nMaterial: Mild steel\n\nSafety Factor: 4 times\n\nFinish: Painted RAL 5013\n\nTemperature Range: -20째C up to +180째C / -4째F up to 356 째F\n\nStandard Certificates: Certificate of Conformity, 3.1 Material Certificate EN 10204\n\nGroove size can be modified on request for customized rope sizes."
