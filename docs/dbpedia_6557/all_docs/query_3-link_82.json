        "text": "Are we back in a golden era of British films? With the likes of The Favourite, Ex Machina and Dunkirk all released in recent years, it certainly seems like it. But where to start? C&TH cuts through the noise with our selection of the best new British films to watch now, plus where to find them.\n\nBest New British Films To Watch Now\n\nSaltburn\n\nEmereld Fennel’s sophomore directorial feature begins at Oxford University, following Oliver (Barry Keoghan) and Felix (Jacob Elordi) as the former struggles to find his place amid the latter’s upper-class friends. What ensues is an intense friendship that gets darker and weirder when Felix invites Oliver to spend his summer holidays at his home (aka mega mansion), Saltburn.\n\nStream It: Saltburn is streaming now on Prime Video.\n\nWhere Was Saltburn Filmed? (& Can You Visit?)\n\nPoor Things\n\nVictorian Britishness is filtered through a weird, steampunk lens in Yorgos Lanthimos’ Poor Things, led by an eerie woman named Bella (Emma Stone) who has been brought back to life Frankenstein style with her own baby’s brain transplanted into her head. Here’s exactly what to expect.\n\nWatch It: Poor Things is in cinemas now, with a digital release TBC.\n\nWonka\n\nThough Willy Wonka is decidedly American, we’re expecting some British humour from Wonka, which was written and directed by Paul King (previously directing Paddington and Paddington 2) and co-written by Simon Farnaby of the Horrible Histories troupe. Plus, it was filmed in the UK – so we’re claiming it. Learn all about the film here.\n\nWatch It: Wonka is still in cinemas, but you can pre-order it to stream at home on Prime Video and iTunes.\n\nRye Lane\n\nA love letter to Brixton and Peckham, and named for the real Rye Lane Market, Rye Lane follows two young Black Londoners, Yas (Vivian Oparah) and Dom (David Jonsson), who spend the day together while recovering from terrible breakups. Directed by Raine Allen-Miller, the film has been praised for its vibrant yet candid portrayal of British life.\n\nStream It: Rye Lane is streaming now on Disney+.\n\nThe Banshees of Inisherin\n\nStarring Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson and Barry Keoghan, this Irish black tragicomedy transports viewers to the fictional Irish isle of Inisherin, where Farrell and Gleeson play two lifelong friends who face turmoil when one abruptly ends their relationship, with surprisingly gory consequences.\n\nStream It: The Banshees of Inisherin is streaming now on Disney+.\n\nThe Banshees Of Inisherin: Where Was It Filmed? (& Can You Visit)\n\nWhat’s Love Got To Do With It?\n\nSet between London and Lahore, What’s Love Got To Do With It? Is produced by British film studio Working Title Films, starring Lily James, Shazad Latif, Shabana Azmi and Emma Thompson, James plays a filmmaker documenting her childhood friend and neighbour’s arranged marriage to a bride from Pakistan.\n\nStream It: What’s Love Got To Do With It? is streaming now on Netflix.\n\nRoald Dahl’s Matilda The Musical\n\nInspired by the West End show via Roald Dahl’s classic childhood tale of a mistreated schoolgirl with strange powers, Roald Dahl’s Matilda The Musical arrived in British cinemas at the start of December in 2022 to immediate popularity and acclaim. Starring Alisha Weir as the titular Matilda Wormwood, Emma Thompson as the infamous Trunchbull, Lashana Lynch as loveable Miss Honey and Boiling Point’s Stephen Graham as Mr Wormwood, it’s an all-singing, all-dancing, star-studded affair.\n\nStream It: Matilda The Musical is streaming now on Netflix.\n\nLady Chatterley’s Lover\n\nD. H. Lawrence’s famously steamy novel got the Netflix treatment in 2022, starring Emma Corrin and Jack O’Connell. Set across the expansive (fiction) Chatterley estate, the film follows Conni (the titular Lady Chatterley) who embarks on an affair at the instruction of her paralysed husband in order to have a child.\n\nStream It: Lady Chatterley’s Lover is streaming now on Netflix.\n\nLiving\n\nDirected by Oliver Hermanus from a screenplay written by Nobel Prize winner Kazuo Ishiguro, inspired by Akira Kurosawa’s 1952 Japanese film, Ikiru. Bill Nighy plays Rodney Williams, a senior London County Council bureaucrat in 1953 London, who has just received a terminal cancer diagnosis. Nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay at the 2023 Oscars, Nighy is up for his first Academy Award, for Best Actor.\n\nStream It: Stream Living for free with a Prime Video subscription.\n\nAftersun\n\nAlso earning Paul Mescal his first Oscar nomination – in the same category as Nighy, no less – Aftersun was produced by BBC Film and the BFI.
