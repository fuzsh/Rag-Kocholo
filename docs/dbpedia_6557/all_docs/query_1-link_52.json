        "text": "In the year 2000 film Snatch, lead character Turkish keeps an office in an old crumbling Caravan (Travel Trailer), in establishing shots of exterior around the caravan we see a character (Charlie) cooking sausages on a flaming BBQ grill, and we see boxer Gorgeous George training with a punching bag. Turkish and his partner Tommy discuss the need to buy a better Caravan, which is central to the plot.\n\nThe entire area is somewhat dark and seems to have at least one or two walls, implying it may be indoors, however a Caravan would typically be needed for an office if you were outdoors, and one wouldn't usually cook on a BBQ inside a building.\n\nWhere is this caravan / training facility located, is it outdoors but near an overpass or other building, giving it a somewhat indoor appearance? Is it in a warehouse or other large structure that might be big enough to make cooking with a BBQ feasible, but still warrant using a Caravan for an office? Or is it at some other kind of place entirely?"
