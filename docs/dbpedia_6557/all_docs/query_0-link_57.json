While roaming the streets of Paris, a pickpocket swipes a bag containing a bomb and inadvertently ruins a bank heist attempt by corrupt French government officials. Now labeled as a terrorist threat and running for his life, the only person who can save him is Sean. This unlikely duo joins forces to solve the case before they become victims in a devious plot of international conspiracy."
