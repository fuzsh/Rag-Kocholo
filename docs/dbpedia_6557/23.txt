It would probably take two or three viewings to work out all the plot twists of Snatch. Actually, it's to the credit of writer-director Guy Ritchie that these tangled relationships are as clear as they are. But plot isn't what this movie is about. Mixing Damon Runyon's love of lowlife lingo ("Who took the jam out of your doughnut?") with a bit of Tarantino-ish violence, the plot is just a frame for a gallery of eccentric characters, lively dialogue, and offbeat situations.

The ensemble cast provides many delightful characterizations, including British comic Alan Ford as crime boss Brick Top and Brad Pitt as an Irish gypsy with an accent so thick that no one can understand anything he says. Energetic as it is, Snatch isn't for all tastes. The incessant violence will bother some viewers, particularly a few scenes that cross the line from comical to nasty.
