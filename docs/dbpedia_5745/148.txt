Abstract

James W. Cronin started his career in high energy physics, won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1980 for the discovery of CP-violation, and amongst others, discovered hard parton scattering phenomena in nuclear collisions, an observation known as the "Cronin-effect". In 1986 he decided to move to cosmic ray physics which lead to the construction of the first 1 km2 class large air-shower array CASA-MIA. In 1991, as his masterpiece, he started building a collaboration to construct an instrument of unprecedented size for studying cosmic rays with energies up to 1020 eV. Construction of the Pierre Auger Observatory began in 2002, was finished in 2008, is taking data since like a "Swiss Clock", as Jim used to call it, and has dramatically advanced our understanding of ultra-high energy cosmic rays.
