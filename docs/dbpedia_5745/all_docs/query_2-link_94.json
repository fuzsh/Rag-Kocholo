        "text": "The Department of Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Sciences at the University of Michigan is the oldest degree program and the second oldest department of its type in the country.\n\nIn the late 1940s, the Department of Aeronautical Engineering organized a graduate program for Air Force officers who came to U-M for training. One of the courses offered began with introductory material in neutron-nuclear physics and included some material on reactor physics, such as diffusion theory and elementary criticality calculations. The course was held on a classified basis.\n\nIn the early 1950s, when the material became available on an unclassified basis, it was decided to offer the course college-wide. Developing interest in nuclear energy led to the introduction of several additional courses including Radiation Measurements, taught in Electrical Engineering, a Radiation with Matter, also taught in Electrical Engineering, and Industrial Applications of Radiation, taught in Chemical Engineering.\n\nInterest in the area grew to the point that an interdepartmental committee was appointed by the Dean of Engineering in 1952 to administer a graduate program in Nuclear Engineering. It was decided in the early 1950s to construct a research reactor, as part of the Michigan Memorial Phoenix Project (MMPP) established as a World War II memorial in 1948. The existence of a program with the responsibility for developing peaceful uses of nuclear energy at U-M attracted additional attention and a significant number of graduate students to the Nuclear Engineering program. The Ford Nuclear Reactor (FNR), built with a $1 million grant from the Ford Motor Company, reached initial criticality in 1957 and was the third university campus reactor constructed in the United States.\n\nThe first Master’s degree in Nuclear Engineering was awarded in 1954. The first three PhD degrees were awarded at the spring commencement in 1958. By 1958, about 110 graduate students were enrolled and about eight faculty members were associated with the program on at least a part-time basis: Henry Gomberg, William Kerr, John King, Paul Zweifel, Edward Martin, Richard Osborn, Lloyd Brownell, and George West.\n\nThe first student chapter of the American Nuclear Society was organized at the University of Michigan and was officially chartered in December 1955. The Department initially offered only a graduate program, with degrees at the Master’s, professional, and doctoral levels. It was a national leader in the establishment of PhD programs in Nuclear Engineering and in Nuclear Science. In 1959, a tradition of long-standing was begun by the administration of a “preliminary” examination for the incoming class of doctoral candidates."
