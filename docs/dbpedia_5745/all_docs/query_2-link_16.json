        "text": "'This was also the discovery of the proton and Rutherford showed that the “nucleus of hydrogen” existed in the nucleus of other atoms and thus appeared as a basic building block. The first nuclear reaction initiated by a human and the discovery of the proton are big steps in themselves, but from these reactions you can also infer the sizes of nuclei. It also led to the development of nuclear accelerators - so that you could induce all sorts of different nuclear reactions.\n\n‘This discovery, and the earlier work done by Rutherford that established the existence of an atomic nucleus itself, essentially established the field of nuclear physics right here in Manchester.’\n\nTo mark the centenary, and for the first time in the University’s history, Rutherford’s private research room will be opened to the public. This is part of a special exhibition called ‘Rutherford's Manchester: the birthplace of nuclear physics.’\n\nVisitors will be guided around some of the most important scientific sites of discovery at the University before entering the building where Rutherford and his colleagues began the field of atomic physics.\n\nDr James Hopkins, the University’s Historian and Heritage Manager, added: ‘This is a unique exhibition about a unique scientist responsible for one of the world’s biggest scientific breakthroughs. This University and this city is the birth place so of nuclear physics and the exhibition explains the importance of the work carried by Rutherford and his colleagues at the University demonstrates the enormous impact of their discoveries.’\n\nThe new exhibition celebrates the Nobel Prize winner’s huge contribution to nuclear physics and clears up some misconceptions along the way.
