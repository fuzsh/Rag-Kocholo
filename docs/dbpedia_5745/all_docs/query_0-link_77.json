        "text": "John is an acclaimed environmental advocate named a “Hero for the Planet” by Time Magazine for his groundbreaking work on New York’s Hudson River. He is executive director of the Center for Technology Policy and the Environment and its Blue Colab program at Pace University’s Seidenberg School for Computer Science and Information Systems. The Center is devoted to advancing technologies and policies that assure the public’s right-to-know the quality of their water.\n\nJohn’s environmental career began with the urging of folksinger Pete Seeger, whom he met at a dock restoration project on Beacon, NY’s Hudson River waterfront in 1973 (Photo: Pete and John discussing a Hudson River map display in Beacon). John began as a volunteer co-editor with Pete and Ed Renehan of the North River Navigator, Clearwater’s monthly newsletter at the time, and then was appointed a “River Rat” in the Pipewatch program under the direction of the first Hudson Riverkeeper, Tom Whyatt, appointed by the Hudson River Fishermen’s Association (HRFA) in 1971. John’s Pipewatch investigations helped bring the first enforcement actions in New York State under the two-year old 1972 Federal Clean Water Act. John became Clearwater’s Environmental Action Coordintator, continuing his investigative work and helping to organize the first citizen movement to close the Indian Point nuclear power plant in Buchanan, NY.\n\nJohn served as district project coordinator and environmental advisor for Congressman Hamilton Fish, Jr., but resigned over Fish’s support for an anti-choice constitutional amendment. He joined the staff of the New York State Assembly Committee on Environmental Conservation, under its chairperson, state Assemblyman Maurice Hinchey where he advanced legislation and policies on coastal zone management, river protection, and closure of toxic waste sites. He served on a special staff investigating U.S. Army involvement in Love Canal, where his research into the history of secret Manhattan Project contractors in New York State revealed that Linde Air Products discharged uncontrolled radioactive wastes into the underlying aquifer in Tonawanda, NY. The Department of Energy subsequently ordered a cleanup. He left his state legislative job to spend three seasons as a Hudson River commercial fisherman and business agent for the New York State Commercial Fisherman’s Association.\n\nIn 1983, HRFA named John the second Hudson Riverkeeeper, after having served on the HRFA board since 1976. His 17-year stint as the pollution-fighting Riverkeeper began with a landmark victory against the Exxon Company which he caught sending oil tankers to rinse their holds in the Hudson, and pirate fresh river water for the company’s Lago refinery in Aruba. That year, John founded the Hudson Riverkeeper Fund, Inc. (HRF), with HRFA president Robert H. Boyle and environmental attorney Neal Brown, and served as executive director for both HRF and HRFA. In 1992, on behalf of both boards of directors, Cronin and Brown formally consolidated the two organizations into Riverkeeper, Inc., a unique pairing of environmental and fishing interests. Together with the Environmental Litigation Clinic and its senior attorneys, Professors Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Steven Solow, and Karl Coplan, John helped bring a string of successful cases against corporations and government agencies that resulted in more than $25 million for river restoration.\n\nThe nation’s only water “Keeper,” John travelled the country helping to found Keeper programs on other waterways, and provided funds for some of the startups, incluging for Long Island Soundkeeper Terry Backer, and NY-NJ Harbor Naykeeper Andy Wilner. He and Backer co-founded the National Alliance of River, Sound and Bay Keepers, which Kennedy later reorganized and incorporated in 2000 as the Waterkeeper Alliance. Today, 360 water keepers work on six continents. (Pictured are the first WaterKeepers, attending an annual meeting of the National Alliance of River, Sound and Bay Keepers in Portland Maine, circa 1990. Rear, L-R: Michael Herz, San Francisco Baykeeper; Terry Backer, Long Island Soundkeeper; Joe Payne, Casco Baykeeper; John Cronin, Hudson Riverkeeper; Terry Tamminen, Santa Monica Baykeeper; Rick Dove, Neuse Riverkeeper. Front, L – R: Andy Wilner, NY-NJ Harbor Baykeeper; Cynthia Poten, Delaware Riverkeeper; Sally Bethea,Chattahoochee Riverkeeper; Ken Moser, Puget Soundkeeper; John Torgan, Narragansett Baykeeper.)\n\nJohn’s affiliation with Pace University dates to 1986 when he co-founded the Environmental Litigation Clinic with Professors Nicholas Robinson, Richard Ottinger and Kennedy. In 1991, the Law School awarded him an Honorary Juris Doctor for his work on the Hudson and with the Clinic. In 1999, he was inducted as the university’s first Resident Scholar in Environmental Studies. Later, as full-time Senior Fellow for Environmental Affairs, he taught environmental policy, and co-founded the Environmental Policy Clinic with Professor Michelle D. Land, which, among many achievements, wrote and succcessfully lobbied the New York Elephant Protection Act prohibiting the use of elephants in circuses and other forms of entertainment. At present, in addition to directing Blue CoLab, he teaches advocacy skills in the Master’s in Environmental Science and Policy program, and is Land’s co-instructor in the Animal Advocacy Clinic, which helped lead passage of state legislation banning wildlife killing contests in New York.\n\nAmong John’s many honors are: Time Magazine Hero for the Planet; Honorary J.D., Pace University School of Law; Jefferson Gold Award for Public Service; Thomas Berry Environmental Award; American Fisheries Society William E. Ricker Award; EPA Region I Environmental Merit Award; EPA Region II Environmental Quality Award; Top 100 Irish-Americans; and Vanity Fair Hall of Fame.\n\nJohn is co-author with Kennedy of the 1999 book The Riverkeepers, with an introduction by Vice-President Al Gore. His other writings include many popular and academic articles, and Op Eds on environmental policy for The New York Times, USA Today, The Hill, HuffPost, Times Union, LoHud, and the Earthdesk blog, where he was chief contributor and editor. He wrote and co-produced The Last Rivermen, a documentary film about the demise of the Hudson River commercial fishing industry, short-listed as a runner-up in 1992 Academy Award voting.\n\nJohn has been profiled by many broadcast outlets, including: Today Show, CBS Sunday Morning, NBC Nightly News, Good Morning America, CNN, Charlie Rose, Bill Moyers Reports, History Channel, Outdoor Channel, and more.\n\nHe has been the subject of three books and scores of print articles, including::\n\n~ The Wall St. Journal: “A unique presence on America’s major waterways.\n\n~ People Magazine: “Equal parts detective, scientist and public advocate.”\n\n~ The New Yorker: “Professional responsibility and personal obsession meet on the river in John Cronin.”\n\n~ Knight Ridder Newspapers: “A hero in one of the great success stories of the modern environmental movement.”\n\nHonors and Awards\n\nHonorary Juris Doctor, Pace University School of Law\n\nTime Magazine Hero for the Planet\n\nJefferson Gold Award for Public Service\n\nThomas Berry Environmental Award\n\nAmerican Fisheries Society Wiilam E.
