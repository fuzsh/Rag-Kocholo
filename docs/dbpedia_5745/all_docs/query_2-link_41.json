        "text": "Last week Neil de Grasse Tyson was on Bill Maher's show and the topic of nuclear weapons came up.\n\nTyson said, \"modern nukes don't have the radiation problem.... They're a different kind of weapon than Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\" When pressed by Maher, he said, no, there is no radiation issue \"if it's hydrogen bombs.\"\n\nWith all due respect to Dr. Tyson, does anyone know what in blazes he's talking about?\n\nMy understanding is that ALL thermonuclear or \"hydrogen\" bombs still have a fission primary that uses at least as much fissile material as Fat Man, and therefore even the smallest TN bomb would be at least as irradiative as the original fission bombs, albeit with more \"bang for the buck\". However, AFAIK most also utilize a shell of additional fissile material which undergoes fission as a result of the huge neutron flux from the fusion, rendering these much dirtier than the original bombs. Wikipedia says specifically that retrofitted W87 warheads use a U235 shell to make the second fission stage even more powerful (and more radioactive).\n\nIs there anything known about \"newer\" post-cold war weapons designs and/or trends that could justify what he said? My only thought was that he might have been talking about relative \"dirtiness\" per unit of yield being smaller with modern bombs, but I'm not even sure that much is true when you factor in the fissile shell which seems to be a common feature. Otherwise I'm at a loss to understand why he would say what he said.\n\n$\\begingroup$\n\nAs others have mentioned, hydrogen bombs use a fission trigger.\n\nIn addition many used a tamper made of fissile materials. This way the neutrons from the fusion reaction can create an additional fission reaction.\n\nFrom Wikipedia: \"The secondary's relatively massive tamper (which resists outward expansion as the explosion proceeds) also serves as a thermal barrier to keep the fusion fuel filler from becoming too hot, which would spoil the compression. If made of uranium, enriched uranium or plutonium, the tamper captures fast fusion neutrons and undergoes fission itself, increasing the overall explosive yield. Additionally, in most designs the radiation case is also constructed of a fissile material that undergoes fission driven by fast thermonuclear neutrons. Such bombs are classified as two stage weapons, and most current Tellerâ€“Ulam designs are such fission-fusion-fission weapons. Fast fission of the tamper and radiation case is the main contribution to the total yield and is the dominant process that produces radioactive fission product fallout.\"\n\n(Emphasis added by me).\n\nMany hydrogen bomb designs would have a more than 50% fission yield. And since the yield tends to be far greater than the fission only bombs of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki era, potential for radioactive fission by-products can be much worse.\n\nanswered Mar 4 at 18:11\n\nHopDavidHopDavid\n\n27311 silver badge77 bronze badges\n\n$\\endgroup$"
