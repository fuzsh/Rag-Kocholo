        "text": "Station 2\n\nNuclear fission was discovered at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry in December 1938. While bombarding uranium with neutrons, Otto Hahn and his colleague Fritz Straßmann discovered that fission products such as barium were also created in the process. In January 1939, Lise Meitner and her nephew Otto Frisch provided the explanation. As an Austrian Jew, Meitner had emigrated from Germany in the summer of 1938, but she continued to correspond with Hahn from her exile in Sweden.\n\nExperiments by Enrico Fermi, notably the irradiation of uranium with neutrons in 1934, set the stage. Over the course of many years of work, Hahn, Meitner and Straßmann tried to explain the processes they observed. They hypothesized that elements heavier than uranium – transuranium elements – were formed during bombardment. On 19 December 1938, they arrived at an unexpected conclusion: Hahn and Straßmann showed, with the help of special chemical separation and analytical methods, that the reaction products observed were radioactive barium isotopes. Evidently, during the experiments the atomic nuclei ‘burst’, as Hahn so famously put it. This was something the chemists were unable to explain theoretically – all the more so given that this ‘bursting’ was at odds with all previous experience.\n\nMeitner and Frisch realized that the uranium nucleus can be pictured as an electrically charged drop of liquid in accordance with the previously formulated drop model. Capturing an extra neutron caused the nucleus to oscillate so much that it split into two fragments of roughly equal size and releasing a huge amount of energy in the process. Frisch called the previously unknown nuclear reaction ‘nuclear fission’, which quickly caught on internationally\n\nNotes on nuclear fission - the second Nobel Prize"
