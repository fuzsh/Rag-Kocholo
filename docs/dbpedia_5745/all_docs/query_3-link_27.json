        "text": "A famous group of mathematicians, important above all for the development of functional analysis, was the group of the Scottish Café in Lwow, Poland, a group of mathematicians that between the two World Wars gathered at that café around the personality of Stefan Banach.\n\nThrough the work of Hugo Steinhaus and Stefan Banach, Lwow had become one of the most important centers of functional analysis, and, in 1929 they founded the journal Studia Mathematica, specialized in functional analysis.\n\nThe publication of the journal was interrupted at the beginning of the Second World War, and was resumed in 1948.\n\nA fundamental role had the atmosphere of the Scottish Café, where Banach and his colleagues used to gather, discussing about problems of mathematics.\n\nStanislaw Ulam recounts that the tables of the café had marble tops, so they could write in pencil on the table during their discussions. To avoid the results to be deleted by the waiter every day, Banach’s wife provided them with a large notebook, which became known as the Scottish Book and was subsequently published.\n\nAmong the most well-known attenders of the discussions at the Scottish Café there were Stefan Banach, Hugo Steinhaus, Stanislaw Mazur, Stanislaw Saks, Stanislaw Marcin Ulam.\n\nA recent reconstruction of the history of the mathematicians of the Scottish Café can be found in the paper Chris Zielinski, ‘Mathematicians at the Scottish Café’, (2018). The author’s grandfather Tomasz Zielinski was the owner of the Scottish Café.\n\nM. Lothaire (the M. simply stays for \"Monsieur\", i.e. \"Mr.\") was the pen name of a group of mathematicians and computer scientists, many of whom were former students of Marcel-Paul Schützenberger. The name is used as the author of three seminal books on the combinatorics of words. Since the members of Lothaire were, at least initially, French, Italian and German, and in view of the fact that its founder, Schützenberger, was the heir to an ancient Alsacian family, was chosen the name of Lothaire I, founder of Middle Francia, an ephemeral kingdom extending from Frisia to northern Italy. The whole history is explained in the Preface of the 1997 edition of Combinatorics on Words:\n\n[...] In his review for the Bulletin of the London Mathematical Society, John Howie had suggested a possible pun on \"l'auteur\". There is really nothing of this Lacanian type. Lothaire was the grandson of Carolus Magnus [...] he reigned over Lotharingia, a kingdom comprising part of France, Germany and Italy more or less centered in Alsace [...]. It became established that the students of M.-P. Schützenberger, himself of a renowned alsacian family, were citizen of a mythical kingdom of Lotharingia [which actually takes his name from Lothaire II, son of Lothaire I]. There is today a Lotharingian seminar of combinatorics holding frequent meetings in France Germany, and Italy [...]\n\nLothaire was (and in part it still is) a group structured like Bourbaki, while the following are names used informally and sometimes simply humorously to write some mathematical works, without having a structured group behind them.\n\nArthur Lancelot Besse was the name of a group of French differential geometers; Blanche Descartes was the name used by R. Leonard Brooks, Arthur Harold Stone, Cedric Smith, and W. T. Tutte to publish some papers in Eureka, a mathematical student magazine in Cambridge; L. T. F. Gamut was the fictitious author of \"Logic, Language and Meaning\" (vol. 1 & 2), two monography written by the Dutch logicians Johan van Benthem, Jeroen Groenendijk, Dick de Jongh, Martin Stokhof and Henk Verkuyl; G. W. Peck was the pseudonymous used as author (or co-author) of a number of papers in combinatorics (Paul Erdős was one of the actual authors), while John Rainwater is the \"author\" of important results in functional analysis.\n\nFinally, mention should be made of the Project Polymath, which is a collective mathematical problem-solving project. An online platform enables mathematicians to work together to find a solution to a problem, improve a result, check a proof, etc. The project began in 2009 on Timothy Gowers' blog and has the support of Terence Tao and Michael Nielsen, a specialist in open science.\n\nIn addition to the Pythagorean school, cited in nwr's answer, there is an equally famous group of the ancient era, the peripatetics or peripatetic school, which was the name given to the Lyceum of Aristotle.\n\nThe peripatetics were a group of students that gathered around the personality of Aristotle, and took its name from the cloister (peripatos) in which they walked and held their discussions. They dealt with philosophical and scientific disciplines, that, of course, were not so distinct as nowadays.\n\nIn particular, from a scientific point of view, Aristotle and his disciples dealt not only with physics, but also with biology.\n\nEven if physics, and his treatises collected in Physics, are the most well-known aspect of Aristotle's philosophical and scientific thought, in a subsequent period of his life Aristotle dealt with biology, and his biological researches were the fruit of long and precise studies he carried out, with the collaboration of his disciples, during the twelve years of direction of the Lyceum.\n\nUndoubtedly, even before him [Aristotle] the Greeks had undertaken various inquiries of biological nature, but Aristotle provided a new approach to these researches [...]. We need only recall that, in his works about biology, he speaks of about five hundred animal species, many of them studied with anatomic dissections, drawings of organs, and so on.$^1$\n\nHis most important book about biology is Parts of Animals.\n\nThe peripatetic Theophrastus, the successor of Aristotle as director of the Lyceum, continued the naturalistic and biological studies of his master, in his treatises Enquiry into Plants (Historia Plantarum) and On the Causes of Plants .\n\nThe successor of Theophrastus, the peripatetic Strato of Lampsacus, marked a decisive turning point in the course of studies of the Lyceum, stressing again the physical aspect rather than the biological one of naturalistic philosophy, coming to express the necessity of a rapprochement to Democritus. He attempted to reformulate Aristotle's physics theories on the base of Democritus’ atomism. Several modern scholars consider Strato as the 'highest point of Greek physics': but, unfortunately, we keep of him too little to judge exactly the value of his scientific researches and the meaning of his reinterpretation of Aristotle’s heritage .$^2$\n\n$^1$ Geymonat L., Storia del pensiero filosofico e scientifico.
