        "text": "Nobel laureate and scientific luminary Enrico Fermi (1901-54) was a pioneering nuclear physicist whose contributions to the field were numerous, profound, and lasting. Best known for his involvement with the Manhattan Project and his work at Los Alamos that led to the first self-sustained nuclear reaction and ultimately to the production of electric power and plutonium for atomic weapons, Fermi's legacy continues to color the character of the sciences at the University of Chicago. During his tenure as professor of physics at the Institute for Nuclear Studies, Fermi attracted an extraordinary scientific faculty and many talented studentsâ€”ten Nobel Prizes were awarded to faculty or students under his tutelage.Born out of a symposium held to commemorate the hundredth anniversary of Fermi's birth, Fermi Remembered combines essays and newly commissioned reminiscences with private material from Fermi's research notebooks, correspondence, speech outlines, and teaching to document the profound and enduring significance of Fermi's life and labors. The volume also features extensives archival materialâ€”including correspondence between Fermi and biophysicist Leo Szilard and a letter from Harry Trumanâ€”with new introductions that provide context for both the history of physics and the academic tradition at the University of Chicago.Edited by James W. Cronin, a University of Chicago physicist and Nobel laureate himself, Fermi Remembered is a tender tribute to one of the greatest scientists of the twentieth century.Contributors:\n\nHarold Agnew\n\nNina Byers\n\nOwen Chamberlain\n\nGeoffrey F.
