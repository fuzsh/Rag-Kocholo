        "text": "Some of the most famous physicists in history include Albert Einstein, known for his groundbreaking theories of relativity and mass-energy equivalence; Isaac Newton, whose laws of motion and gravity revolutionized the study of physics and laid the groundwork for modern calculus; Marie Curie, the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and a pioneer in the study of radioactivity; and Stephen Hawking, who made groundbreaking contributions to the study of black holes and the origins of the universe despite being diagnosed with a debilitating motor neuron disease.\n\nHowever, these are just some examples of scientists that have contributed to the understanding of the physical world. There are many more names, some of which we will touch upon in this article and our famous physicists series. Curious? Keep reading!\n\nScientists in physics\n\nPhysics is one of the main branches of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). It contains many fields of study within it, like nuclear physics, mechanics, electronics, etc. and it is closely linked with mathematics.\n\nEven though we consider physics a separate branch nowadays, the separation between the sciences is not as clear as it may seem. For centuries, scientists who contributed to physics also contributed to mathematics, chemistry and even biology. Thus, some names might be renowned in several fields. In fact, in this article, you might find names that you have heard of in other sciences before.\n\nMarie Curie (1867 - 1934) is famous not only for her work in physics but also in chemistry, and Blaise Pascal (1623 - 1662) touched upon many important disciplines apart from physics, including biology and philosophy.\n\nGalileo Galilei\n\nOne of the most famous polymaths (a person who is interested and knows in topics that cover a broad range of knowledge) is Galileo Galilei (1564 - 1642). Born in Italy in the 16th century, he was an astronomer, physicist and engineer. Galileo is famous for his numerous contributions to the fields of astronomy and physics, including:\n\nthe discovery of the four largest moons of Jupiter,\n\nthe observation of sunspots,\n\nhis work on the laws of motion and the principle of inertia, and\n\nthe invention of the telescope.\n\nGalileo's support for the heliocentric model of the solar system, proposed by Copernicus in 1543, brought him into conflict with the Catholic Church. Copernicus' book on the subject had been banned, as the heliocentric model was considered heresy by the Church. Galileo was judged for initially supporting this model, and sentenced to house arrest for the rest of his life. If he had not renounced the heliocentric model during the trial, he could have been sentenced to death.\n\nThe heliocentric model of the solar system states that the Sun is the centre of the solar system and that the planets (like the Earth, Venus, Jupiter, etc.) revolve around it. The idea that the Sun is the centre of our solar system is correct, however, the model had to be revised later as it contained a lot of inaccuracies.\n\nFamous nuclear physicists\n\nThe study of atomic nuclei and their properties and behaviour constitutes the field of nuclear physics. This area of physics encompasses an investigation into the composition and structure of atomic nuclei, as well as the interactions that occur between atomic nuclei and subatomic particles. Nuclear physics also encompasses the applications of nuclear energy in diverse fields, including energy production, medicine, and materials science.\n\nThe applications of nuclear physics range from life-saving uses such as tests and treatments for cancer to mass-destruction weapons like the atomic bomb. All of these applications are owed in part to the famous nuclear physicists that paved the way to where we are now:\n\nLise Meitner (1878 - 1968):Meitner was an Austrian physicist who is best known for her contributions to thediscovery of nuclear fission. She was one of the few women in her field during her time and faced discrimination due to her sex and Jewish heritage.\n\nEnrico Fermi (1901-1954): Fermi was an Italian physicist who was instrumental in the development of the first nuclear reactor. He won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on nuclear reactions.\n\nMarie Curie (1867 - 1934): Curie was a Polish-born physicist and chemist who is best known for her pioneering work in the field ofradioactivity. She was thefirst woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person to win two Nobel Prizes in different fields, and the first female professor at the University of Paris.\n\nRobert Oppenheimer (1904 - 1967): Oppenheimer was the director of the Manhattan Project, which developed the first atomic bomb. He is often referred to as the \"father of the atomic bomb.\" However, he opposed the creation of the hydrogen bomb, and following the war, Oppenheimer became an outspoken opponent of nuclear weapons and a leading advocate for arms control and disarmament.\n\nNiels Bohr (1885 - 1962): Bohr made important contributions to the development of quantum mechanics and the understanding ofatomic structure. He proposed the Bohr model of the atom, which describes electrons as orbiting the nucleus in discrete energy levels.\n\nTable 1.

This field is particularly useful in areas where experimental data is limited or absent and paves the way for future demonstrations. Theoretical physicists devise theories and hypotheses using advanced mathematical concepts, to describe the behaviour of the universe on both a microscopic and macroscopic level.\n\nThe work of theoretical physicists is centred on developing new models and theories that can explain existing observations and make predictions regarding the behaviour of the universe. The scope of their research encompasses a vast array of topics, including quantum mechanics, general relativity, and particle physics. Some of the most renowned theoretical physicists are:\n\nAlbert Einstein (1879 - 1955): Einstein is known for histheories of relativity, which transformed our understanding of space and time. He also made significant contributions toquantum mechanics and the development of the atomic bomb, which he later opposed for ethical reasons.\n\nStephen Hawking (1942 - 2018): Hawking was an English physicist currently known for his work on black holes and the origins of the universe. You might know him from his multiple popular science books like \"A Brief History of Time\", or the movie based on his life, \"The History of Everything\".\n\nRichard Feynman (1918 - 1988): Feynman specialised in quantum mechanics. He proposed the concept of quantum electrodynamics, which describes the interactions between particles and electromagnetic fields. Feynman also made contributions to the development of the atomic bomb.\n\nMax Planck: Max Planck was a German theoretical physicist who is considered one of the founders of quantum mechanics. He is known for his work on the relationship between energy and frequency, which led to the development of the concept of the photon. In Germany, the Max Planck Society is a prestigious university-independent research compendium of 86 research institutes spanning from physics to law.\n\nErwin Schrödinger: Erwin Schrödinger was an Austrian theoretical physicist whose research focused on quantum mechanics. He is best known for his thought experiment involving a cat, known as \"Schrödinger's cat\". The experiment is designed to demonstrate the paradoxical nature of quantum superposition, which is the idea that subatomic particles can exist in multiple states at the same time.\n\nTable 2.

However, many more women have participated and significantly contributed to physics, both in the past and in the present.\n\nChien-Shiung Wu (1912 - 1997): Chien-Shiung Wu was a Chinese-American physicist who is especially known for the discovery of parity violation in nuclear physics. Parity is a fundamental symmetry in physics that relates to the behaviour of a physical system under mirror reflection. In certain types of nuclear decay, such as beta decay, the parity of the resulting particles is not conserved. This means that the resulting particles are not mirror images of their initial state, and the process violates parity symmetry. The discovery of parity violation in nuclear decay was a significant milestone in the study of fundamental symmetries in physics.\n\nVera Rubin (1928 - 2016): Rubin was an American astronomer who focused on explaining dark matter. She was the first woman to be allowed to observe at the Palomar Observatory, and she was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1993.\n\nEmmy Noether (1882 - 1935): Noether was a German mathematician and physicist who made significant contributions to the development of abstract algebra and theoretical physics. She is known for her theorem, which relates symmetries in physics to conservation laws, and she was the first woman to obtain a doctorate in mathematics from the University of Erlangen.\n\nTable 3.

However, in this article, we will focus on scientists from the United States and Britain.\n\nFor a deeper understanding on scientists from other countries, you can read the following articles on each individual scientist, or our German article \"Berühmte Phycisisten\".\n\nSteven Weinberg (1933 - 2021): Weinberg won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1979 for his work on the unification of two of the fundamental forces of nature - the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces. He has also made significant contributions to the theory of cosmology and the study of particle physics.\n\nMurray Gell-Mann (1929 - 2019): Gell-Mann won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1969 for his work on the classification of subatomic particles known as hadrons. He also proposed the concept of quarks, which are now considered to be the building blocks of protons and neutrons.\n\nLisa Randall (1962 - ): Randall is a theoretical physicist who has significantly contributed to the field of particle physics and the study of extra dimensions. She is known for her work on the Randall-Sundrum model, which proposes the existence of a hidden extra dimension of space.\n\nTable 4.

He has to be one of the most famous physicists in history. He is known for his laws of motion and his theory of gravitation, which revolutionized our understanding of the universe. Newton also made important contributions to the development of calculus.\n\nJames Clerk Maxwell (1831 - 1879): Maxwell was a Scottish physicist who is known for his work on electromagnetic theory. He proposed a set of equations that describe the behaviour of electric and magnetic fields, which helped pave the way for the development of modern electronics.\n\nPaul Dirac (1902 - 1984): Dirac was an English physicist who worked in the field of quantum mechanics.

Although the research in physics (and other STEM branches) has been radically transformed over the last centuries, and many extremely important discoveries have been made, there is still a lot to unravel within this scientific discipline. Thus, the contribution of current physicists to the field is extremely important and deserves recognition.\n\nRemember, they might be the Einstein of future generations!\n\nLisa Randall (1962 - ), already mentioned in this article, is a theoretical physicist and professor at Harvard University. Her work focuses on particle physics and cosmology, with a particular emphasis on the relationship between gravity and the structure of the universe. Randall is best known for her work on the theory of extra dimensions,which proposes that our universe may be embedded within a larger, higher-dimensional space. Her work has helped to explain why gravity is so much weaker than other fundamental forces and has provided a framework for understanding the behaviour of particles at high energies.\n\nBrian Greene (1963 - ) is a theoretical physicist and string theorist whose work focuses on the mathematical underpinnings of the universe and the nature of space and time. Greene is best known for his work on string theory, which proposes that the fundamental building blocks of the universe are not particles but rather tiny, one-dimensional objects called strings. His research has helped to explain the nature of gravity and has provided a framework for understanding the behaviour of particles at high energies.\n\nMichio Kaku (1947 - ) whose work focuses on the unification of the fundamental forces of nature and the nature of time. Kaku is best known for his work on string theory, which proposes that the fundamental building blocks of the universe are not particles but rather tiny, one-dimensional objects called strings. He has also worked on the theory of everything, which seeks to unify all of the fundamental forces of nature into a single, cohesive framework.\n\nKip Thorne (1940 - )is a theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate who works on the properties of space and time, as well as the behaviour of matter and energy in extreme environments. Thorne is best known for his work on the theory of relativity, particularly the study of gravitational waves. He was one of the founders of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), which successfully detected gravitational waves for the first time in 2015. This groundbreaking discovery opened up a new window into the universe, allowing scientists to observe and study objects and phenomena that were previously hidden from view.\n\nEd Witten (1951 - ) is a theoretical physicist and mathematician who focuses on the unification of the fundamental forces of nature and the nature of space and time. Witten is best known for his work on string theory. He also developed M-theory, a more encompassing theory that includes multiple dimensions and branes.\n\nTable 6.

In other words, they are science communicators and authors of scientific non-fiction books as well as researchers. Their contribution in that respect is harder to quantify, but extremely important too, to help dispel myths surrounding science and motivate future generations to participate in science or become scientifically literate. As the world becomes more technological, it is important that we understand the basics of science and technology to keep up.\n\nFamous Physicists - Key takeaways\n\nHistorically famous physicists rarely contributed to just one discipline, but rather their knowledge allowed them to contribute to several branches of STEM.\n\nCurrent physicists are many times also science communicators, trying to raise awareness of how our planet works and motivating future generations into contributing to science too.\n\nSome of the most famous physicists of all time include Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton, Niels Bohr and Marie Curie, among others.\n\nReferences\n\nhttps://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/the-truth-about-galileo-and-his-conflict-with-the-catholic-church#:~:text=But%20four%20centuries%20ago%2C%20the,Galileo%20Galilei%20to%20abandon%20it.\n\nhttps://www.space.com/heliocentrism\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/event/Manhattan-Project\n\nhttps://www.atomicarchive.com/resources/biographies/meitner.html"
