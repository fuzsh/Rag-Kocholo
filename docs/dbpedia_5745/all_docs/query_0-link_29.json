        "text": "Nobel Prize \"for the discovery of violations of fundamental symmetry principles in the decay of neutral K-mesons\".\n\nProfessor James W. Cronin is a renowned experimentalist who finished his PhD in nuclear research at the University of Chicago in the 1950's.\n\nHe returned to the same place as a professor in 1971, after having performed a number of very succesful experiments to study the symmetry between matter and antimatter which lead to the discovery of Charge Conjugation and Parity (CP) violation for which he was awarded the nobel prize in Physics in 1980 together with his colleague Val Fitch.\n\nAccording to this symmetry matter was expected to behave identically as the mirror image of antimatter, but they discovered that this was not true.\n\nThis is a profound discovery that makes absolute differences between matter and antimatter and may explain why the Universe developed in the beginning to contain more matter than antimatter.\n\nHe is also widely known for having discovered the \"Cronin effect\" by which the bonding of nucleons in heavy atoms is shown to affect the interactions at high energies."
