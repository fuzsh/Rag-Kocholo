        "text": "The Manhattan Project would not have been possible without the efforts and skills of hundreds of scientists and engineers who either directly contributed to the Manhattan Project or broadly contributed to nuclear research. Several scientists and engineers that worked on the project had unique stories that led them to their work on such a groundbreaking wartime effort. Their revolutionary scientific breakthroughs occurred in a relatively short amount of time under the immense pressure of World War II. Ultimately their efforts ushered the world into the atomic age. Learn more about a few of these remarkable scientists and engineers below.\n\nClick on the articles below to explore the scientists and engineers of the Manhattan Project and those who contributed to nuclear research â–¼"
