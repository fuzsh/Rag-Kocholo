        "text": "Marie Sklodowska Curie, the discoverer of radium and winner of two Nobel Prizes, is without question the most famous woman in radiation science. She faced obstacles and prejudice, and achieved breakthroughs that changed the world. Her dramatic life has been portrayed in movies and television shows.\n\nMany other women also overcame professional challenges to advance our understanding of radiation, but their stories remain relatively unknown. Scroll down for the stories of three such women in history: Lise Meitner, Chien-Shiung Wu, and Rosalind Franklin. To hear the story of a woman working in radiation science in our time, watch our video presentation from EPAâ€™s Lee Veal.\n\nOn this page:\n\nSpotlight on Lee Veal\n\nBiographies\n\nSpotlight on Lee Veal\n\nMs. Lee Veal, Director of the Radiation Protection Division, talks about her experience as a woman in science and provides advice to anyone pursuing a science career."
