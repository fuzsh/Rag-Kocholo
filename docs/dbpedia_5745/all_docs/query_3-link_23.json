        "text": "American physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer headed the Manhattan Project, with the goal of developing the atomic bomb, and Edward Teller was among the first recruited for the project. Leo Szilard and Enrico Fermi built the first nuclear reactor. Ernest Orlando Lawrence was program chief in charge of the development of the electromagnetic process of separating uranium-235.\n\nOther notable researchers included Otto Frisch, Niels Bohr, Felix Bloch, James Franck, Emilio Segr√®, Klaus Fuchs, Hans Bethe, and John von Neumann. The person who oversaw the Manhattan Project, however, was not a scientist. He was Leslie Groves, a brigadier general in the U.S. Army."
