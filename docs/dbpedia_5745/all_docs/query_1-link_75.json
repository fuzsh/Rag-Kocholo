        "text": "Cronin\n\nPublication day – Ireland and the UK\n\nIt’s the official publication day of Blood Runs Green in Ireland and the UK. I’ve marked it by grading student essays.\n\nThe UK launch of the book was held in Waterstones in Liverpool on Monday night. There was a great crowd for the event (and plenty of prosecco and wine to reward those who gave up some of their Monday evening sunshine to come along)\n\nThe format of this event was different to the others that I’ve done. This time I was in conversation with Dealan O Donghaile, a colleague from the English Department at Liverpool John Moores University. I really enjoyed the conversation format. We hadn’t really decided on how it would work so I think the chat flowed pretty naturally. Deaglan did a really good job with questions that allowed me to tell some of the most interesting stories in the book (without giving too much away). After we’d chatted for a while there was a lively Q&A session with some really interesting questions and observations from the audience.\n\nAfterwards a gang of us continued the evening with more wine and food.\n\nTo mark the publication day LJMU have run a story about the book on the university website which is wonderful.\n\nNext stop is the Dublin launch which will take place on 12 May in the City Assembly House on South William Street at 6.00pm. After that I’ll take a small break from the book and return to work on my two museum projects. Never a dull minute!\n\nChicago, New York, Dublin, Liverpool\n\nAnother whirlwind week.\n\nPacked up and said farewell to the Newberry Library and Chicago and headed to New York for the last few days of the trip.\n\nDecided that the best way to shake off the lethargy and boredom brought on by hours sitting in the airport and plane was to walk the High Line. It was a glorious evening and despite the throngs that had the same idea it was lovely and the first evening off I’d had in a month.\n\nOn our wander back to the hotel (where we’d been given a suite…which made me very tempted to spend the few days lounging in the sitting room!) we passed Barnes and Noble at Union Square and on Fiifth Avenue. I couldn’t resist popping in to see if the book was in store and was thrilled to find it on the shelves!\n\nThe following day we spent the morning wandering through the Met marvelling at their collection and then had a late lunch in the sunshine at Central Park before I had to spruce myself up for the final talk of the trip at the American Irish Historical Society.\n\nThe AIHS has the most fantastic building on Park Avenue just opposite the MET. With its chandeliers, wood panelling and grand piano it’s certainly the grandest venue I’ve been in on this trip (though the rather make-shift screen was in constant danger of toppling over throughout the talk – I think I was saved by the cable ties and the step-ladder!). The questions after the talk were really interesting and I had some really good conversations with a former New York cop, the author of a book on the Molly Maguires, some members of the AOH, and a distant cousin that I’d never met before.\n\nNext day (after an obligatory visit to The Strand bookstore) we headed for home. There was a cinematic moment as we sped through Manhattan in a yellow cab. I checked my email and there was one from the publishers telling me that the New Yorker is giving Blood Runs Green a mention next week. Such a thrill.\n\nA quick stop in Dublin for a proper fry-up and a shower and then on to Liverpool and back to teaching my students.\n\nI popped down to Waterstones on Thursday and was delighted to see my book not only has a table, but also a window display!\n\nThe UK launch of Blood Runs Green is in Liverpool on Monday. It’s at 6pm at Waterstones Liverpool One. All are more than welcome.\n\nThe Newberry Library, Signings and more chat\n\nOn Tuesday 24 March I did a ‘Meet the Author’ event at the Newberry Library. About 100 people braved the cold to come along which was wonderful. The Q&A session at the end was really lively and enjoyable. It was a real treat to meet one of the students who had taken a class with me at the Library back in 2009.\n\nThe talk at the Newberry was very special to me as the library is where the whole Cronin project began when I stumbled across a report of his funeral in the Chicago Times. Ever since then the library has been a home from home and I’ve been back every year for at least a few weeks, sometimes staying up to five months. The library is a treasure trove and I never leave without having ideas for several new projects. This trip has been no exception and I’ve been following up the story of how the wife of one of Chicago’s leading Irishmen (and the owner of a number of gambling dens) disguised herself as a nun and ran off with a local priest.\n\nThere was an unprecedented run on Blood Runs Green that evening and the Newberry bookstore ran out. But all is well and it’s back in stock (and if anyone in Chicago wants to pick up a signed copy the Newberry Library is the place to go!)\n\nNext morning I was (unfortunately) up bright and early to chat with Sean Moncrieff on Ireland’s Newstalk. The interview was fun despite the poor line which had me shouting down the phone (never ideal when you’re being interviewed in a library – thankfully it was so early very few were in!). That afternoon I gave a talk about some new research that I’ve been doing on the illustrations of Thomas Nast and the Q&A after provided me with lots of new leads and food for thought so the next two weeks will be a scramble of research and talks and catching up with some friends.\n\nMarch 2015 has certainly turned out to be a most interesting month!\n\nReviews, Readings & Exhibitions\n\nWell it’s been quite the week.\n\nI had a great time reading at the Seminary Co-Op and met with a descendant of the murdered man Dr Cronin. It was a really treat to meet with Jim Cronin and his wife (and I’m anxiously waiting to hear what he thought of the book!)\n\nOn Saturday the ‘Irish Times’ published a review of ‘Blood Runs Green‘. I’ll confess to a slightly sleepless night before the review came out but I was thrilled when I read it. I’m particularly chuffed to be described as an ‘academic Sherlock Holmes’. I’m thinking of getting that on my business cards!\n\nhttp://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/review-blood-runs-green-the-murder-that-transfixed-gilded-age-chicago-by-gillian-o-brien-1.2145983\n\nI was invited to see the new Art Institute exhibition ‘Ireland: Crossroads of Art and Design, 1690-1840’. It’s glorious and anyone who has a chance to see it should go along. At the symposium on Saturday and the dinner that evening (in the stunning University Club) it was great to catch up with some old friends and collaborators…and it’s tempting me back into doing some 18th century research again.\n\nIf anyone is around Chicago tomorrow evening (and wants to brave the weather!) I’ll be speaking at the Newberry Library at one of their ‘Meet the Author’ events at 6.00pm.\n\nPublication day looms…\n\nCopies of Blood Runs Green have arrived (both to my house and to bookstores!).\n\nIt was a real thrill to finally see the finished product and I’m delighted with it. The publishers have done a great job and the book looks (and feels) wonderful. I’ve been afraid to examine it too closely as I’m bound to find an error somewhere (if anyone finds one I definitely don’t want to know…unless of course it goes into a second edition!)\n\nNow I have the somewhat daunting task of going out and about to talk about the book. I’m much more comfortable sitting in an archive or teaching in a classroom but I’ve got to step considerably out of my comfort zone over the next few weeks to give talks and do some radio and TV interviews.\n\nFor anyone interested (and in the Chicago area) I’m talking at the Seminary Co-Op on Wednesday 18th March at 6pm\n\nhttp://www.semcoop.com/event/gillian-obrien-blood-runs-green\n\nOn Tuesday 24 March I’m doing a ‘Meet the Author’ event at the Newberry Library in Chicago\n\nhttp://www.newberry.org/03242015-blood-runs-green-murder-transfixed-gilded-age-chicago\n\nI’ll be on NPR’s ‘Weekend Edition’ next weekend and I’m really looking forward to doing that interview in a few days. I have an interesting St Patrick’s day lined up. There’ll be no parade, Guinness or shamrock for me this year. Instead I’ll be taking leaping in and out of Chicago taxis for the day. I’m doing an interview on WBEZ’s ‘Afternoon Shift’ and then high-tailing to the WTTW studios to appear on ‘Chicago Tonight’. It’s all quite a change from grading essays, teaching and working away in virtually silent archives!\n\nIn the midst of all the hustle and bustle of the last week which was filled with some great student presentations, hours spent reading drafts of essays and the hassle of making travel plans I also got an unexpected but wonderful review of Blood Runs Green in Times Higher Education. According to the review:\n\nBlood Runs Green is that rarer beast – academic research in the guise of a true crime account. But it leaps off the page like the best fictional murder mystery… O’Brien paints a vivid picture of what was then the longest-running trial in US history with a verve that would make John Grisham and company green with envy. . . . Blood Runs Green is all that’s best in academic writing: detailed research, accessible writing—and a rattling good yarn. It certainly kept me turning the pages like the best crime novel.\n\nThe full review can be found here: http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/books/blood-runs-green-the-murder-that-transfixed-gilded-age-chicago-by-gillian-obrien/2018802.article\n\nA new adventure awaits!\n\nA first glimpse…\n\nIn a month I’ll be winging my way to Chicago to start research on a new project. I’ll be examining some overlooked Thomas Nast cartoons that are held by the Newberry Library. I can’t wait to get back to the library and delve into some research and to catch up with friends. I realised the other day that it’s almost 10 years since I first visited Chicago. Little did I know then – when I took a notion to break up a trip to San Francisco with a few days in Chicago – that I’d spend a lot of the next decade immersing myself in the history of the city and of the Irish in the city.\n\nThe research trip also coincides with the publication of Blood Runs Green so I’ve a hectic month in Chicago with some TV and radio to do, talks in libraries and bookstores and a few lectures both on the book and on the new project. It’s all beginning to feel very real now. A few days ago I got a proof copy of the book (the version that’s sent out pre-publication to newspapers etc in the hope that they might review it). It was great to see and hold the manuscript in a bound form. I’m now eagerly awaiting my first sighting of the actual book.\n\nThe process from completion of the manuscript to the arrival of a book into the bookstores is a long one. The full draft of the manuscript was sent to the publishers in October 2013. The final polished version was sent in May 2014. In October last year I received the manuscript in its final form (looking very much as it does in the book). Several weeks of proofreading (and hair pulling!) ensued before the manuscript was returned to Chicago (hopefully with all spelling/grammar/punctuation errors erased!) After that there followed discussions about the book title and the cover images. And now I’m in the midst of setting up meetings and talks and writing articles and generally back thinking about the book (and constantly noticing books that have just been published or that are about to be published that would have been useful to read before finishing my book…but I guess that’s always the way).\n\nNow I’m busy second-guessing what I might be asked in any interviews – at least I don’t have to footnote those!\n\n10 weeks to go!\n\nA new year, a new week, a new book. 2015 started very well when I got my hands of the University of Chicago Press Spring Catalog (all 375 pages of it!). It’s the size of a telephone directory (for those who remember telephone directories!) so I was expecting a lengthy trawl in search of my book but, lo and behold, it appears in all its glory on page one!\n\nThere’s a smaller History Catalog and one of the illustrations from the book is on the front cover. I’m particularly pleased about that as that image was the one I had suggested might be used as the cover image for Blood Runs Green. It didn’t make it to the front page (but appears in all it’s glory inside the book) so I’m really pleased to have that image from Judge made it to some front cover!\n\nThe original color illustration by Bernhard Gillam is a quite astonishing image (I’m very grateful to Mimi Cowan who first alerted me to its existence).\n\nAt the forefront of the picture the simian murderer stands over the body of the slain Dr Cronin. In case there was any doubt that the murderer is an Irishman the green flag is adorned with harp and the slogan ‘Freedom to Ireland’. The title of the image is ‘Under False Colors’ and the text below reads: ‘The noble cause of Irish freedom is retarded and disgraced by such deeds as this, and the assassin is repudiated by every good Irishman’ The Cronin murder took place in Chicago but in this image the location has been transposed (or at least connected) to Ireland. Behind the main image there is a small wooded area where two bodies lie at the base of the tree. A wooden post and sign reads ‘Phoenix Park’. For those in the know the dead men are Lord Frederick Cavendish, the recently appointed Chief Secretary to Ireland and his under-secretary and right-hand man Thomas Burke. In May 1882 (almost exactly seven years before Cronin’s death) the two men were ambushed as they strolled through the Phoenix Park in Dublin close to the vice-regal lodge (now Aras an Uachtarain the official residence of the President of Ireland). The Dublin murders generated huge attention (& Charles Stewart Parnell was erroneously linked to the deaths). Five men were found guilty of the murders and executed…many in Chicago expected the same fate to befall those accused of Cronin’s murder.\n\nIt’s interesting that Judge assumed that readers would be sufficiently familiar with the Phoenix Park murders and would connect them in some way to Cronin’s murder that the editors saw no need to provide any further information within the journal. In some ways it’s a testimony to the sophistication of the journal’s readership and it highlights just how much attention had been devoted to Irish republicanism and the Cronin murder in the previous few months.\n\nSerendipity (& generosity)\n\nThe temptation when researching and writing a book is to stay in an archive working away until the finished text is polished enough to be seen by outside eyes. However tempting it’s not always a good idea. The airing of ideas before a project is completed offers the chance for others to make comments and suggestions that you might not have thought of while sitting in a dusty archive. While researching Blood Runs Green I was very lucky to come across many scholars who were happy to share their knowledge with me and whose suggestions and recommendations have greatly enhanced the book.\n\nI gave a paper at the Newberry library where I spoke about the murder of Dr Cronin and I mentioned the fact that there were a number of illustrations of the murder published at the time. Somebody asked if I’d seen the famous Puck cartoon about immigration which was published in June 1889. The illustration, “The Mortar of Assimilation— And the One Element That Won’t Mix” by. C.J. Taylor, shows a weary Lady Liberty dejectedly using her spoon of “equal rights” to stir a bowl full of foreigners who are seeking citizenship. On the edge of the bowl, a simian Irishman brandishing a bloody knife and clasping a Clan flag dances defiantly, refusing to blend with the other immigrants determined to become Americans. I knew the image as it has been reproduced in many books since 1889 but I’d never looked at the original. In the reproductions the words ‘Clan na Gael’ are rarely legible but they’re clear to see on the original print. Given that the image was published at the height of the publicity surrounding the murder of Dr Cronin it was obviously referencing the on-going debate about the ability of Irish immigrants to be both American and Irish.\n\nOn another occasion following a talk it was suggested that I contact a retired professor at the University of Illinois as he had done some research on the Cronin murder many years previously. I met him for lunch one afternoon and he told me that he’d read the Cronin murder trial records about thirty years previously but had decided against writing a book about it as he felt he didn’t know enough about Irish history to put the murder in context. Previously I’d been informed that the murder files were missing and had been missing since the 1950s. He assured me that he’d seen them so I contacted the Illinois State Archives in Springfield and they promised that they’d search for them. Three days later as I sat on the Red Line heading for the Newberry Library in Chicago I received a phone call from an archivist at the Archives telling me that they’d located the over 7,000 pages associated with Cronin murder trial. So I set off on the (very slow) train to Springfield. There, alongside many days spent in the archives, I met a man who was on a Lincoln pilgrimage (dressed as Lincoln), a woman with Lincoln’s stovepipe hat meticulously painted on every fingernail, a man who turned out to be a hologram and I was introduced to the culinary delight that is the Horseshoe!\n\nThere were a myriad of other serendipitous moments and I was fortunate to meet many generous scholars who shared with me their knowledge of art history, Chicago history, literature, Irish history and much more. The world of academia can be a selfish place, but it’s also full of people with enormous knowledge and enthusiasm and kindness."
