A sequel, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, followed in 1997. The third chapter, Austin Powers in Goldmember, debuted in 2002, meaning viewers have been waiting 16 years for Powers' eccentric universe to be revived.\n\nThis isn't the first time Myers has stoked fans' hopes for a fourth flick. In May this year, he told Entertainment Tonight he would \"love\" to make a movie from Dr Evil's perspective.\n\nAll the Netflix Original films coming out in 2018\n\nShow all 8\n\n\"It would be Dr Evil one, Austin Powers four, that's how I would roll,\" he added.\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
