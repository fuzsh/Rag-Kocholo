        "text": "Much like Mischa Barton, the Canadian actor Mike Myers is of British parentage (they’re from Liverpool). Sadly for him and us, his odious Fat Bastard character from his Austin Powers franchise seems to employ Liverpudlian and a slight Canadian lilt along with the supposedly Scottish twang that he’s meant to be portraying. One can only hope that he didn’t try it on his teammates when he took part in 2010’s Soccer Aid match for charity in the U.K. because you wouldn’t want to mess with them. Comedy can only take you so far.\n\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/v/nixR6wVa4HY]"
