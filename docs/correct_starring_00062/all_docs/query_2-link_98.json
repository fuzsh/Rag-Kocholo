        "text": "Everyone knows it pays to laugh at yourself.\n\nIn Hollywood, it really pays.\n\nWith its clever use of product placement, \"Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me\" simultaneously elicits laughs and free advertising. The movie exhibits a sense of self-awareness that makes fun of the often-criticized technique, yet also profits from it.\n\n\"This type of product placement is sophisticated,\" said Robert Thompson, professor of film and television at Syracuse University. \"It's a tongue-in-cheek kind of thing that gets the (producers) out of trouble because we assume that they know better.\"\n\nIt seems that everybody, including moviegoers, knows better. A booming product placement industry has attracted in recent years as much criticism as it has dollars. Such publicity has created more savvy moviegoers, and for that reason, producers and writers normally use placement that remains inconspicuous.\n\nBut with his overcharged libido and off-color jokes, Austin Powers is anything but normal. Rather than use subtle placement, the movie does the opposite by using over-the-top techniques that are so blatant as to evoke laughs.\n\nThe most prominent example is a Heineken joke that gives the word \"Heinie\" a dual purpose. If it seems superfluous, that's because it is.\n\n\"The placement was a little gratuitous,\" admitted Norm Marshall, chairman and CEO of Norm Marshall and Associates, the product placement firm that represents Heineken. \"We didn't have complete control over how that was going to play out, but it works for that crowd.\"\n\nThe Heineken joke likely would not have appeared but for a pre-production deal struck between the beer company and New Line, the film's studio. In exchange for the placement, Heineken has promoted the movie in its in-store displays, which translates into millions of dollars in free promotion for the movie.\n\nThough some deals involve cash payments, others, like the Heineken deal, are quid pro quo agreements in which studios trade placement with advertising exposure. The marketing campaigns use Austin Powers to sell products, but in doing so, they also increase awareness of the movie. That can be priceless, according to Roger Thompson, president of the American Marketing Association's Sacramento, Calif., chapter.\n\n\"In a sense, product placements are an extension of the movie. It's another tactic to drive ticket sales. And product placement keeps a movie visible, so when it comes out on video, they can sell it again.\"\n\nThe product placement dynamic is hardly a new concept. It has existed at least since James Dean used an Ace Comb in the 1955 classic \"Rebel Without a Cause.\" Countless teens followed suit soon thereafter.\n\nBut the 1990s versions of the Ace Comb -- Coca-Cola beverages, McDonald's restaurants and more than 1,000 other products -- have spawned an entire industry in which firms, script readers and studio executives exist solely to place brand names in movies.\n\nModern-day product placement traces back to 1982, when the Steven Spielberg film \"E.T.\" featured Reese's Pieces, and sales of the then-obscure candy skyrocketed. Based on the \"E.T.\" model, subsequent films began placing more brand names while creating marketing opportunities for tie-ins.\n\nMore recently, however, several films have implicitly poked fun at product placement, as \"The Truman Show\" did last year by including fake products sprinkled throughout the movie.\n\nAnd Mike Myers himself, who co-wrote and stars in \"The Spy Who Shagged Me,\" mocked product placement in his 1992 film, \"Wayne's World.\" An exchange involving characters Wayne, Garth and an industry executive cleverly sandwiches brand names like Doritos and Pizza Hut between statements like \"Contract or no, I will not bow to any sponsor.\"\n\nNevertheless, gratuitous scenes like the Heineken one in \"Austin Powers\" make some film experts a bit wary. Those who respect film as an art form worry that the commercialism undermines the integrity of scripts.\n\n\"If it's not necessary, then it's gratuitous, and that just makes it lousy art,\" said Richard Walter, professor of screen writing at UCLA. \"There's always got to be a lot of subtext and subtlety. If an audience is aware of product placement, it is testimony to the poor craft of that movie.\"\n\nStill, Walter and others suggest that if product placement contributes to a movie by providing realistic props or improving a story line, the technique is worthwhile. The line between commercialism and plot development, which \"Austin Powers\" tends to blur, depends on the necessity of the placement.\n\n\"There's no question that it will have an influence over plot lines,\" said David Stewart, chair of the marketing department at the University of Southern California. \"The question is whether it needs to be there. Is the question over which car to use or whether to write a car into a script? At one point, you're writing advertising copy; at the other, you're writing a movie script.\"\n\nJust because a product appears in a movie does not mean a deal has been struck, however. Those in the industry differentiate between product placement, which shows a brand name solely for commercial purposes, and product usage, which includes a product because it is essential to the plot.\n\nAmerican movies, created in a culture permeated by brand names and logos, are bound to include certain products. As the culture becomes more commercial, so do its movies.\n\n\"I can see a bunch of these comic movies getting material out of consumer brand names; that's part of the American experience,\" said Thompson, who has studied popular culture for more than 20 years. \"In 'Austin Powers,' it makes perfect sense because the movie is about making fun of our culture.\"\n\nThriving on its kitschiness, \"Austin Powers\" connects with viewers through a multitude of popular-culture references. Inevitably, that means the inclusion of brand names.\n\n\"What people don't realize is that so much of that stuff was not designed as product placement,\" said producer Jay Roach, who added that test groups \"loved all the product references\" and \"said there could be even more.\"\n\nOne such group was largely responsible for a scene in which Evil henchman Fat Bastard belts out a rendition of Chili's Grill & Bar's \"Baby Back Ribs,\" a tune famously played in the restaurants' advertisements. \"It showed up in the movie because (lead actor) Mike Myers was actually ad-libbing during a test screening and people were falling out of their chairs laughing,\" said Louis Adams, a Chili's spokesman. \"It got such a great reaction that they asked us if they could keep it in.\"\n\nSimilarly, Starbucks never asked to be in \"Austin Powers.\" The movie depicts Dr. Evil as the leader of the Starbucks empire, invoking the dark image the coffee chain has garnered in some circles. Despite the inherent criticism the placement suggests, Starbucks may have the last laugh.\n\n\"Mike Myers came to us,\" said Chris Gimbl, Starbucks spokesman. \"We had no control over the content, but at the same time realize that this is a comedy. We have never been a company afraid to laugh at ourselves. We thought it was funny.\"\n\nBrands appearing in the movie, such as Philips Electronics and Virgin Atlantic Airways, hope that success breeds success. \"Whatever product is in 'Austin Powers' is very hip because it's allowing itself to be made fun of,\" said Thompson, the Syracuse professor.\n\n\"As any sixth-grader knows, if you don't allow yourself to be made fun of, you're not cool.\""
