        "text": "What’s Aged the Best?\n\nShould Have Won: Starbucks as an evil corporation\n\nActually Won: The word “mojo”\n\nAbsolutely, using the term “mojo” traces back to this movie, and it’s embedded so deep in our culture that younger generations don’t even realize where it came from anymore. Dr. Evil being in cahoots with Starbucks is comedic gold. If they made this movie today, they’d probably swap Starbucks out for some big tech company, but even after 25 years, Starbucks is still a corporate titan. The joke holds up, especially with all their union controversies and their omnipresence. Imagine if Dr. Evil had taken Number 2’s advice back in 1999 and invested in Starbucks instead of scheming to blow up the world. He would’ve seen a 2,000% return on investment! Austin Powers wouldn’t have been able to alter that kind of success.\n\nWhat’s Aged the Worst?\n\nShould Have Won: Vanessa Kensington dying off the way she does\n\nActually Won: Felicity Shagwell sleeping with Fat Bastard\n\nThe hosts of this episode were massive Heather Graham fans, so seeing her in bed with such a revolting character is tough to watch. But let’s be real, in the context of the movie’s plot, it’s the only way for her to slip him the tracking device in a funny way. Now, let me just say this: the writers did Elizabeth Hurley so dirty. Yeah, she didn’t want to do the sequel, and sure, James Bond always had a new leading lady. But come on, don’t treat the audience like idiots. We knew her mom was Austin’s sidekick decades earlier. Why wouldn’t Basil stop Austin from marrying her if he knew too? In the Bond movies, they never bother explaining why there’s a new girl in each film. The writers here should’ve taken a page from that playbook.\n\nUnanswerable Question\n\nShould Have Won: Would Jennifer Aniston be better as Felicity Shagwell?\n\nActually Won: Was mojo based off of Viagara?\n\nThe question about Aniston never came up because the episode was hosted by two card-carrying members of the Heather Graham Fan Club. Graham’s career was scorching hot in 1999. She was fresh off “Boogie Nights” and “Lost in Space.” Landing her as the female lead in the summer’s biggest comedy was a huge deal. It cemented her status as a bona fide star at the APEX of her career. But let’s be honest, was she really the best for the role? She’s incredibly beautiful, but her acting here is pretty awful. You know who was also at the top of their game in 1999, is beautiful, and can act in a comedy? Jennifer Aniston. She was the top-billed star of the biggest sitcom at the time. Aniston hadn’t done a movie that transcended her stardom yet. It makes sense to have a woman play the straight character in a silly comedy, but Aniston could have played off Myers so much better, making it more memorable. It took years for Aniston to get her movie career going, and she could have not only nailed this role but also skyrocketed her career.\n\nJoey Pants That Guy Award\n\nShould Have Won: Michael McDonald\n\nActually Won: Mindy Sterling\n\nThis one didn’t make sense because Sterling is definitely a “that guy,” but this is the movie that everyone knows her from. People see her in anything and immediately go, “Frau!” But she’s already in the role. The award should go to someone whose name you don’t know and have to look up because you’ve seen them in other things. That’s why it has to be McDonald. He’s in the first movie, where his role is much funnier, but for those who watched “MadTV” back in the day, he was an icon. Many don’t know his name but definitely recognize him as the “Stuart” character from the show.\n\nWho Won the Movie?\n\nShould Have Won: Verne Troyer\n\nActually Won: Mike Myers\n\nIt’s the first “Austin Powers” movie that Myers truly owns. It solidifies him as the biggest star in comedy at the time, and this movie is the proof of his success and why he earned that title. But if anyone really “wins” the movie, it’s Verne Troyer. Playing Mini-Me catapulted him into household name status and made him a major celebrity for years. He went from bit parts in movies to landing roles in high-budget films like “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone,” appearing in music videos, and getting tons of TV cameos. Troyer’s character became so popular from this movie that he scored a large role in the third installment of the series. Without the Mini-Me part, Troyer might have been forgotten in Hollywood. But after this movie was released, everyone was talking about him, and he became an enduring iconic figure."
