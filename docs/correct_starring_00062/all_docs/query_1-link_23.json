        "text": "Mike Myers Bohemian Rhapsodied his way into cinemas back in 1992, playing hilarious slacker Wayne Campbell in the hit comedy Wayne's World.\n\nBut then, in the spirit of 'easy come, easy go', the Canadian actor dropped off the Hollywood radar.\n\nBetween lawsuits and reports of \"diva\" behaviour on set, Myers kept a low profile and took a six-year hiatus from 2012.\n\nHere's a look at what happened to Myers as he stages a Hollywood comeback.\n\nWhy did Mike Myers stop making movies?\n\nAfter starring in a string of comedies including Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery and The Love Guru, Myers' star was surprisingly on the decline.\n\nSeven years ago, when he was interviewed by GQ magazine, Myers revealed the movie offers became far and few. From 1991 to 2014, he was only offered 15 film roles.\n\nMyers' troubles can be traced back to 2000, when he shocked many after he abruptly quit the movie Dieters halfway through production, citing issues with the script.\n\nThis caused Universal to sue Myers for a reported US$5 million (approx. $6.5 million) and production company Imagine Entertainment sued him for an additional US$30 million (approx. $40 million) for breach of contract.\n\nREAD MORE: What happened between Hugh Grant and Liz Hurley?\n\nThe former Saturday Night Live star countersued, citing \"violations to [his] right of privacy, abuse of process, and fraud on the part of Universal\".\n\n\"The claims made by Imagine are fictional and without merit. Ironically, Mike Myers has substantial claims against Universal, Imagine and Brian Grazer, but he has refrained from filing those claims for several weeks because of discussions that have been taking place between Universal and Mike Myers' representatives,\" his lawyer, Martin Singer, said at the time.\n\n\"Mike Myers has lost the most by not making this movie, which he has worked on for approximately 20 months without receiving one penny from Universal.\"\n\nAfter hashing it out, all parties dropped the lawsuits and agreed to work together on another project, the live-action adaptation of the Dr Seuss classic The Cat in the Hat.\n\nIn 2018, when Myers appeared to stage a comeback, he put his six-year film hiatus down to spending more time with his wife Kelly Tisdale and kids Spike, nine, Sunday, six, and Paulina, five.\n\n\"It's all weird. I grew up in government-assisted housing in Toronto, so all of this is bizarre and fun. This is the happiest time of my life,\" he told People of balancing family life and showbiz. \"I have a lot of stuff coming and I think I may have found the right balance now and I'm super thrilled.\n\n\"I know what I'm doing in terms of my kids now, so that was a good six years.\"\n\nWas Mike Myers \"difficult\" on set?\n\nMore problems allegedly arose while filming The Cat in the Hat in 2003. Myers' co-star Amy Hill — she played Mrs. Kwan in the movie — later labelled him a \"diva\" for his alleged behaviour on set.\n\n\"It was just a horrible, nightmarish experience,\" Hill told US entertainment news site AV Club. \"I don't think he got to know anybody. He'd just be with his people and walk away. People would come and then he'd stand there.\n\n\"There was a guy who held his chocolates in a little Tupperware. Whenever he needed chocolate, he'd come running over and give him a chocolate. That's what divas are like, I guess. Or people who need therapy.\"\n\nREAD MORE: What happened to the Sweeten twins on Everybody Loves Raymond?\n\nDirector Penelope Spheeris also called Myer out for his alleged antics on the set of Wayne's World in 1992.\n\n\"He was emotionally needy and got more difficult as the shoot went along,\" Spheeris told Entertainment Weekly in 2008. \"You should have heard him b----ing when I was trying to do that 'Bohemian Rhapsody' scene: 'I can't move my neck like that! Why do we have to do this so many times? No one is going to laugh at that!'\"\n\nWhat is Mike Myers doing now?\n\nMyers was conspicuously absent from films between 2012 and 2018. Recently, however, he appears to be staging a comeback.\n\nIn 2018, he had a pivotal role in the crime-thriller Terminal opposite Aussie actress Margot Robbie and British star Simon Pegg. That same year, Myers also had a small role in the Bohemian Rhapsody biopic, playing music executive Ray Foster.\n\nAccording to Myers' IMDb page, he is slated to reprise his role as Austin Powers in the fourth instalment of the popular action-comedy. The last time he played the quirky spy was in the 2002 offering, Goldmember, opposite Beyoncé.\n\n\"[My son] keeps asking me, 'Where's the fourth Austin Powers,' which is the weirdest thing. I'm like, 'Get off my back. I'm doing my best,'\" Myers told People in 2018.\n\nREAD MORE: What happened to Cameron Diaz?\n\nWhat his Mike Myers' net worth?\n\nMyers is worth a reported US$200 million (approx. $263 million). The vast majority of his wealth comes from the Shrek franchise.\n\nThe actor voiced the titular character in all four films Shrek 2 (2004), Shrek the Third (2007) and Shrek Forever After (2010), including two Christmas and Halloween TV specials Shrek the Halls (2007) and Scared Shrekless (2010).\n\nThe franchise has so far totalled a reported US$3.5 billion (approx. $4.6 billion), and the actor earned US$43 million (approx. $56 million) from all four movies.\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, sign up here to receive our top stories straight to your inbox"
