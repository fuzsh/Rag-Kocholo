        "text": "Wayne’s World and Austin Powers star Mike Myers looked unrecognisable as he posed on the red carpet at the 49th AFI Lifetime Achievement Award gala on the weekend.\n\nThe event marked the comic actor’s first professional public outing in more than a year, and some fans had trouble recognising him with his grey buzz cut, stubble and youthful-looking skin.\n\nWATCH THE VIDEO ABOVE: Mike Myers debuts new look.\n\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\n\nWhen Entertainment Tonight posted pictures from the red carpet on Instagram, many followers said they had to do a double-take.\n\n“He looks great but would never have recognised him if his name wasn’t mentioned in the caption,” one person wrote.\n\n“What in the Wayne’s World is going on here?” wondered another.\n\n“No way!!!\n\n“I had to do a double-take here.\n\n“Hmmm well good for him, love Mike Myers.”\n\n“Transition to Dr. Evil nearly complete,” joked a third, referring to the other character Myers plays in the Austin Powers series.\n\nOne person said they thought he might have had a “procedure”.\n\n“He looks very different, he definitely had some kind of procedure. Unrecognisable,” they wrote.\n\nOne follower said Myers was starting to resemble English actor Derek Jacobi, while another rather bluntly claimed that he was sporting a “face full of filler”.\n\n“It looks like he got some fillers, injections, got his brows done. Cleaned up and modernised,” said another.\n\nOthers thought the only difference was that Myers had simply let his hair go grey — and he looked a whole lot better as a result.\n\n“I never thought he was attractive until right now!” one fan gushed.\n\n“I mean he just gets better and better looking,” another said.\n\n“I think he looks adorable.”\n\n“Well, how cute is Mike Myers!” enthused another.\n\nMyers is best known for his breakthrough role in Wayne’s World (1992), the Austin Powers movies (1997 - 2002) and for voicing the character of Shrek (2001 - 2010).\n\nBut he disappeared off the radar in recent years after numerous reports emerged that he was unpleasant to work with.\n\nCat in the Hat co-star Amy Hill painted an unflattering portrait of Myers in an interview with The A.V. Club in 2016, saying working with him was “hell” and that he could act like a “diva” at times.\n\nWayne’s World director Penelope Spheeris once described him as “emotionally needy” and someone who became “more difficult as the shoot went on”.\n\nSo I Married An Axe Murderer producer Rob Fried told The Telegraph that Myers was “a visionary, but his way of getting what he wants is to be remote and threaten and express anger”.\n\nLast year, Myers refuted a claim that he had a security guard on the set of 2006 flop The Love Guru sacked for looking him in the eye.\n\nJay Brody claimed that he was warned that “if you look at him, you’re going to get fired”, and was later fired after he “caught his eye for a second”.\n\nMyers’ representatives later sent a statement to Entertainment Weekly refuting the claim.\n\n“Mike knows nothing about this,” they said.\n\n“Not aware of anyone being hired or fired.”\n\nIt seems Myers went into retreat as these various reports emerged, but now he’s back in the spotlight — and with a brand-new look to boot."
