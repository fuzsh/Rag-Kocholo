        "text": "With his keen observational eye and ear, Canadian actor and writer Mike Myers created some of the most memorable comedic characters in TV and film history. From the time of his American breakout on \"Saturday Night Live\" (NBC, 1975- ) in the early 1990s, Myers' success lay in his fully-realized, heavily detailed characterizations and his spot-on mimicry. In an era of cynical insider comedy like \"Seinfeld\" (NBC, 1989-1998), Myers also set himself apart with affable, silliness that was refreshingly free from hip irony or mean-spirited intent. The outrageously funny sight gags in the \"Austin Powers\" series of films never came across as an eye-rolling mockery of the 1960s British films that inspired them, the same way that the \"Wayne's World\" series celebrated the suburban basement experience instead of snickering at it.

In a typically quirky move, Myers moved back to television as the host of a rebooted \"The Gong Show\" (ABC 2017- ), although he did the entire series in character as aging British television personality Tommy Maitland, never acknowledging the joke. If nothing else, Myers' body of work introduced dozens of lasting catchphrases into the pop culture stream. \"Way!\""
