        "text": "What Is Mike Myers' Net Worth and Salary?\n\nMike Myers OC is a Canadian-born actor, comedian, writer, and producer who has a net worth of $200 million. Mike Myers first became famous as a cast member on \"Saturday Night Live.\" He appeared on the show from 1989 to 1995 and created some of the show's most memorable characters, such as public access host Wayne Campbell, German talk show host Dieter, and \"Coffe Talk\" hostess Linda Richman.\n\nMike's breakout role came in 1992 with \"Wayne's World,\" which he co-wrote and starred in with Dana Carvey. The film became a huge success and spawned a sequel, cementing Myers' status as a major comedic talent. He went on to create and star in the \"Austin Powers\" trilogy, in which he played multiple characters, including the titular spy and his arch-nemesis, Dr. Evil. The films were a huge hit, earning a collective $700 million worldwide, and have since become a cult classic. Mike received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2002, and he was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada (OC) in 2017 for his work as a comedian, writer, and producer.\n\nEarly Life\n\nMichael John Myers was born on May 25, 1963, in Scarborough, Ontario. His father, Eric Myers, was an insurance agent, and his mother, Alice \"Bunny\" E. Myers (n√©e Hind), was an office supervisor and Royal Air Force veteran. They had immigrated to Canada from Liverpool, England. Mike has two older brothers, Paul and Peter. He grew up in suburban Toronto, where he attended Sir John A. Macdonald Collegiate Institute, and graduated from Stephen Leacock Collegiate Institute in 1982.\n\nCareer Beginnings\n\nMyers began appearing in commercials as early as the age of two. When he was ten years old, he starred in a commercial for British Columbia Hydro alongside Gilda Radner. After graduating from high school, he joined The Second City Canadian touring company. Subsequently, he moved to the United Kingdom, where he was a founding member of the improv group The Comedy Store Players. Around that same time, Mike joined comedian Neil Mullarkey on the British children's program \"Wide Awake Club.\" In 1986 he moved back to Toronto, where he joined the cast of The Second City Toronto in their main stage show. In 1988, he moved to Chicago, where he trained, performed, and taught at the Improv Olympic.\n\n\"Saturday Night Live\"\n\nIn 1989, Myers joined the cast of NBC's \"Saturday Night Live.\" At \"SNL,\" Mike performed legendary characters such as Linda Richman, Dieter, Wayne Campbell, and many more. The Wayne character landed Myers and fellow \"SNL\" cast member Dana Carvey their own movie adaptation, which was titled \"Wayne's World\" (1992). \"Wayne's World\" was both a critical and commercial success, grossing $183 million worldwide. After two more films, \"Wayne's World 2\" (1993) and \"So I Married an Axe Murderer\" (1993), and another three years on \"Saturday Night Live,\" Mike took a temporary hiatus from performing.\n\n\"Austin Powers\"\n\nMyers reemerged in 1997 with the film \"Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery.\" It was followed by the sequels \"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me\" (1999) and \"Austin Powers in Goldmember\" (2002). The sequels were wildly successful, grossing $312 million and $296.6 million, respectively. In the \"Austin Powers\" franchise, Myers played not only the title role of Austin Powers but the roles of Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard, and Goldmember as well.\n\n\"Shrek\"\n\nAnother highly successful franchise that Myers was part of was the DreamWorks animated \"Shrek\" series, in which he voiced the titular role of Shrek the ogre. The franchise's films include \"Shrek\" (2001), \"Shrek 2\" (2004), \"Shrek the Third\" (2007), \"Shrek the Halls\" (2007), and \"Shrek Forever After\" (2010). He also provided his voice for \"Shrek 4-D,\" a theme park ride at Universal Parks and Resorts. The \"Shrek\" films were some of the most successful for DreamWorks; the first one grossed $484.4 million worldwide, the second grossed $919.8 million, and the third grossed $798.9 million.\n\nOther Projects\n\nIn June 2000, Universal Pictures sued Myers for $3.8 million for backing out of a contract to make a feature film. The original project was supposed to be based on his \"SNL\" character Dieter, and the original contract was $20 million. Myers countersued, saying he did not honor the original contract because his script was not ready. Eventually, he and Universal reached a settlement, and he agreed to make another film with them. The resulting movie was \"The Cat in the Hat\" (2003).\n\nOne of his rare non-comedic projects was the 1998 film \"54.\" Although it was not critically or commercially successful, Mike received positive attention for his efforts. Other projects he has been involved in include \"The Love Guru,\" which he co-wrote, co-produced, and starred in, Quentin Tarantino's \"Inglourious Basterds\" (2009), and supporting roles in \"Terminal\" (2018) and \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" (2018). He also created and starred in the 2022 Netflix series, \"The Pentaverate.\" Among Myers' awards are seven MTV Movie Awards, an Emmy Award, and two Canadian Comedy Awards.\n\nNotable Salaries\n\nMike earned $1 million for 1992's \"Wayne's World.\" He earned $3.5 million for the sequel.\n\nHe earned $3.5 million for the first \"Austin Powers\" movie, $7 million for the second, and $25 million for the third.\n\nMike made $3 million for the first \"Shrek\" movie, $10 million for the second, and $15 million for the third and fourth installments.\n\nThe above salaries just cover his acting duties in the respective films. He has earned hundreds of millions of dollars as a producer and creator of his various franchises, especially \"Shrek.\"\n\nOther Work\n\nThe film \"Supermensch: The Legend of Shep Gordon\" (2013) was Myers' directorial debut. It was screened at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival. Mike is a member of the band Ming Tea along with Susanna Hoffs and Matthew Sweet. Together, they performed the songs \"BBC\" and \"Daddy Wasn't There\" for the \"Austin Power\" films. As an avid fan of the Monty Python comedy troupe, Myers appears in the documentary telefilm \"Monty Python: The Meaning of Live.\" He also appeared onstage during the final night of their live show \"Monty Python Live (Mostly)\" at the O2 Arena.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nMyers began dating actress and comedy writer Robin Ruzan in the late 1980s after they met at an ice hockey game in Chicago. They married in May 1993, eventually divorcing in December 2005. In 2006, he began dating Kelly Tisdale. The couple married in New York City in late 2010 and have three children together.\n\nMike Myers released a book, \"Canada,\" in 2016, which is a memoir of his native country's history and popular culture.\n\nReal Estate\n\nIn January 2017, Mike paid $14.675 million for a 4-bedroom condo in New York City's Tribeca neighborhood. For some reason he was not satisfied with the property, selling it just four months later for $14 million. That's a good way to burn around $700k.\n\nIn August 2018, Mike paid $15.35 million for a penthouse in NYC's Chelsea neighborhood. The 5,600-square-foot apartment has four bedrooms, a study, a 65-foot terrace overlooking High Line Park, two total terraces spanning 1,000 square feet, a library, a media room, and a large open-concept living room and kitchen. Mike listed his penthouse for sale in May 2023 for $20 million.\n\nIn 2014, he bought an 8-acre lake-front home in Colchester, Vermont, for $1.65 million.\n\nIn 2007, he paid $7.9 million for a home in New York City's SoHo neighborhood. At one point, he listed this property for sale for $17 million and ultimately accepted a little under $13.2 million in March 2018."
