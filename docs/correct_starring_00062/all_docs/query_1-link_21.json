        "text": "Mike Myers as secret agent Austin Powers (with some \"shagadelic\" co-stars) in the 2002 spy parody, \"Austin Powers in Goldmember.\"\n\nFor years the actor-writer-producer has tickled TV and movie audiences with his colorful, silly characters. He now has a new hyphenate: director, of a documentary on a real-life figure who is as colorful as any of Myers' comic ones.\n\nBy CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan\n\n\"Saturday Night Live\"\n\nLeft: Some of the characters created by Mike Myers during his six years on \"Saturday Night Live.\"\n\nAs a child, Myers - a Toronto native who would join the Second City comedy troupe - appeared in a TV commercial in which Gilda Radner played his mother. Years later, Myers saw Radner on \"SNL.\" As he recounted to CBS News' Tracy Smith, Myers then announced to his family, \"I'm gonna be on this show one day.\n\n\"And they're like, 'Yeah, okay, fantastic,'\"\n\n\"But you knew it?\" Smith said.\n\n\"You know, I don't know if I knew it. But I knew I wanted to be. I don't know anything, dude! I actually don't make plans, that's the other thing, too. So little of everything that I do is part of a master plan.\"\n\nNew York City\n\n\"My training is from Second City,\" Myers told CBS News' Tracy Smith. \"I went right from high school to Second City Theatre Company in Toronto. And in that show, in one night I would do, like, 15 characters.\"\n\nMyers said the crew at \"SNL\" was extremely generous: \"The crew is the audience for the read-through on Wednesdays. I read the 'Wayne's World' sketch for the first time, and it was last sketch in the pack -- there was, like, 40 sketches. And they just loved it. They got big, giant laughs, and then I got in the show. And then [after] it was on the air, I ran into somebody in the crew. And they said, 'Wow, that 'Wayne's World' thing, dude, it's a hit. I was on the subway, and people were doing 'Wayne's World.'\n\n\"That's so nice - 'Thank you for passing that along!'-- 'cause I thought I was being fired every week, you know?\"\n\n\"You really did?\"\n\n\"I did. I didn't have an office for a year. My office was me cross-legged on my coat by the elevator bank. And Lorne [Michaels] literally said to me a couple times, 'Do you work here?'\"\n\n\"Wayne's World\"\n\nMike Myers' first film was \"Wayne's World\" (1992), based on the \"Saturday Night Live\" skit and co-starring fellow \"SNL\" actor Dana Carvey as Garth. A sequel soon followed.\n\n\"So I Married an Axe Murderer\"\n\nMike Myers played a man afraid of commitment - and who wouldn't be, if your intended (Nancy Travis) is a butcher and possible serial killer? - in \"So I Married an Axe Murderer\" (1993).\n\nInternational Man of Mystery!\n\nIn 1997 Mike Myers introduced his parody of James Bond movies (or rather a parody of James Bond parodies), \"Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery,\" co-starring Elizabeth Hurley.\n\nDr. Evil\n\n\"Here's the plan. We get the warhead and we hold the world ransom for ... ONE MILLION DOLLARS!\"\n\n-- Mike Myers as Austin Powers' nemesis, the villainous Dr. Evil.\n\n\"54\"\n\nIn the 1998 drama \"54,\" Mike Myers played Studio 54 owner Steve Rubell.\n\n\"The Spy Who Shagged Me\"\n\n\"You're fab, you're switched on, you're a bit of alright!\"\n\nMike Myers returned - this time with Heather Graham as Felicity Shagwell - in \"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me\" (1999).\n\n\"The Spy Who Shagged Me\"\n\nCBS News' Tracy Smith asked, \"Did you know when you developed 'Austin Powers' that the audience would get it?\"\n\n\"No, you never know,\" Myers replied. \"I thought you would have had to have grown up in my house to get the film. I'm just a huge fan of James Bond, and a huge fan of all the James Bond spoofs, you know what I mean?\n\n\"And I love the style of it, and I love Burt Bacharach -- which is really the genesis of 'Austin Powers,' the song, 'The Look of Love.' I was just asking myself, 'What happened to swinger culture? What happened to stewardesses are sexy, and Sweden is sexy? That's the genesis of the movie.\"\n\n\"The Spy Who Shagged Me\"\n\nComedian Mike Myers, with his wife Robyn, imitates the villain of his new film, \"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,\" at the premiere at Universal City, Los Angeles, June 8, 1999.\n\n\"Shrek\"\n\nMike Myers provided the voice of the ogre \"Shrek\" in the 2001 animated film based on William Steig's book. The film spawned two sequels.\n\nAustin and Foxxy\n\nIn his third outing as Austin Powers, the 2002 comedy \"Austin Powers in Goldmember,\" Myers starred opposite Beyonce Knowles as Foxxy Cleopatra.\n\nAustin and Foxxy\n\nMike Myers and Beyonce.\n\nDr. Evil and Mini-Me\n\nMike Myers as Dr. Evil, and Verne Troyer as his miniature clone, Mini-Me.\n\nFat Bastard\n\nIn \"Austin Powers in Goldmember,\" Mike Myers also played the extremely obese Fat Bastard - Scottish sumo wrestler and henchman of Dr. Evil.\n\n\"View From the Top\"\n\n\"Would you consider yourself a people person?\"\n\nMike Myers interviews prospective flight attendants (who try not to notice his errant eye - no, it's that one) in the comedy \"View From the Top\" (2003).\n\n\"The Cat in the Hat\"\n\nMike Myers played the title role in the live-action film of Dr. Seuss' \"The Cat in the Hat\" (2003), co-starring Dakota Fanning and Spencer Breslin.\n\nSlimed!\n\nMike Myers gets slimed at Nickelodeon's 17th annual Kid's Choice Awards at UCLA's Pauley Pavillion on April 3, 2004 in Los Angeles.\n\n\"Night of Too Many Stars\"\n\nMike Myers (as the Eccentric Millionaire) and host Jon Stewart perform onstage at the \"Night of Too Many Stars: An Overbooked Benefit for Autism Education,\" at the Beacon Theatre October 15, 2006 in New York City.\n\n\"The Love Guru\"\n\nMike Myers starred as Guru Maurice Pitka, who tries to help a hockey player get his mojo back, in the 2008 comedy, \"The Love Guru.\" Jessica Alba costarred.\n\n\"Supermensch\"\n\nMike Myers was so taken with Shep Gordon (left) - the charismatic manager of such rock acts as Alice Cooper (top left), Teddy Pendergrass and Blondie - that he made him the subject of a movie. \"Supermensch: The Legend of Shep Gordon\" is Myers' documentary about Gordon's life and career, from his early days in L.A. with Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin, to the legendary luaus at his Maui estate, with more famous faces (such as Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger, bottom left) than your average Oscar party.\n\n\"Supermensch\"\n\nDirector Mike Myers and music manager Shep Gordon pose in the SXSW Photo Booth during the premiere of \"Supermensch,\" during the 2014 SXSW Music, Film + Interactive Festival at the Paramount Theatre on March 9, 2014 in Austin, Texas.\n\nFor more info:\n\n\"Supermensch: The Legend of Shep Gordon\" (Official site)\n\nFollow Supermensch on Twitter"
