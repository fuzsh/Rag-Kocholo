        "text": "Would Mike Myers ever be open to returning to the silver screen as Austin Powers? Two words: yeah, baby!\n\nThe Pentaverate actor revealed he'd be down for reprising his role as the iconic character in a new interview with SiriusXM's Jess Cagle, telling the host he \"would love to do\" a fourth movie in the hit comedy franchise.\n\nBut, he teased, \"I can neither confirm nor deny the existence or non-existence of such a project, should it exist or not exist.\"\n\nMyers, 58, played various characters in the spy spoof film series, including the titular Austin \"Danger\" Powers and Powers' main nemesis Dr. Evil.\n\nAfter Cagle, 56, told Myers his response felt \"like a confirmation\" of a forthcoming addition film, the actor quipped, \"It was a non-confirmed, confirmation confirmation.\"\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human-interest stories.\n\nEverett (2) Mike Myers as Austin Powers and Dr. Evil\n\nRELATED: Mike Myers Brings Back Dr. Evil and Reunites with Rob Lowe and Seth Green in New GM Super Bowl Ad\n\nMyers first made his debut as Powers — a secret agent who was cryogenically frozen in 1967, only to wake up to a completely different world 30 years later — in 1997's Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, with Elizabeth Hurley as his fellow spy and love interest, Vanessa Kensington.\n\nHe also played Dr. Evil in the film, and would go on to portray additional villains Fat Bastard and Goldmember in the franchise's two follow-up installments: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999) and Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002).\n\nBack in 2018, the Saturday Night Live alum told PEOPLE that his son Spike, now 10, \"keeps asking me, 'Where's the fourth Austin Powers?', which is the weirdest thing. I'm like, 'Get off my back. I'm doing my best.' \"\n\nMyers said Spike was falling asleep one night and asked if there would be a fourth installment to the franchise. \"And I said, 'I'd like to. I don't know.' Then he said, 'What's Dr. Evil's lair?' And I said, 'An oil rig,' and he said, 'What's an oil rig?' I said, 'It's where you drill oil at sea.' \"\n\n\"He goes, 'It should be a sewer,' and fell asleep,\" the actor added.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Why Mike Myers Took a Six-Year Break From Hollywood: \"I Have Three Beautiful Kids\"\n\nWhile it has been 20 years since Myers has graced the big screen as part of the Austin Powers universe, he recently appeared in a Super Bowl ad for GM that saw Dr. Evil agree to save the planet from climate change before trying to take it over.\n\nThe February commercial also saw him reunite with three of his Austin Powers costars: Seth Green, Rob Lowe and Mindy Sterling.\n\nWorking with Green, 48, Lowe, 58, and Sterling, 68, again after two decades \"was like we hadn't missed a beat,\" Myers told PEOPLE at the time. \"It's like it was five minutes ago. After three kids I don't have a sense of time anyways.\"\n\nAnd the Emmy winner called it \"unbelievably flattering\" when Austin Powers fans come up to him in real life and quote lines from the comedies.\n\n\"It's absolutely gratifying,\" Myers said. \"It's people of all ages and from around the world. It's hard for my head to take in sometimes, but it's just a great experience. The Dr. Evil speech, when he's with Carrie Fisher — 'The details of my life are quite inconsequential ... ' — I've had people recite the entire speech. And me going, 'God, I had to do that in 15 takes.' \"\n\nThe Pentaverate premieres Thursday on Netflix."
