        "text": "This article is about the actor. For other people with similar names, see Michael Myers (disambiguation).\n\nMichael John Myers OC (born 25 May 1963) is a Canadian actor, comedian, screenwriter, producer and director, known for his run as a performer on Saturday Night Live from 1989 to 1995 and for playing the title roles in the Wayne's World, Austin Powers and Shrek film franchises. He made his directorial debut with the documentary Supermensch: The Legend of Shep Gordon (2013). He semi-retired from acting in 2012, though he had supporting roles in Terminal and Bohemian Rhapsody (both 2018).\n\nEarly life[]\n\nMichael John Myers was born in Scarborough, Ontario, on May 25, 1963,[3] to English immigrant parents from the Old Swan area of Liverpool.[4][5] His father, Eric Myers, was an insurance agent, while his mother, Alice \"Bunny\" E. Myers (née Hind), was an office supervisor and a veteran of the Royal Air Force.[6] He has two older brothers: Paul, a musician and Peter, who worked for Sears Canada.[7] He grew up in suburban Toronto districts, both North York and Scarborough,[8] where he attended Sir John A. Macdonald Collegiate Institute. He then graduated from Stephen Leacock Collegiate Institute in 1982.\n\nCareer[]\n\nEarly career[]\n\nMyers began performing in commercials at two years old. At the age of ten, he made a commercial for British Columbia Hydro, with Gilda Radner playing his mother.[6] At 12, he made a guest appearance as Ari on the TV series King of Kensington. At 16, he was the guest star of Season 1 Episode 10 \"Boy On Wheels\" of the TV series The Littlest Hobo.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Myers was accepted into The Second City Canadian touring company. He moved to the United Kingdom, and in 1985 he was one of the founding members of The Comedy Store Players, an improvisational group based at The Comedy Store in London.\n\nThe next year, he starred in the British children's TV program Wide Awake Club, parodying the show's normal exuberance with his own \"Sound Asleep Club\", in partnership with Neil Mullarkey.\n\nHe returned to Toronto and The Second City in 1986 as a cast member in The Second City's Toronto main stage show, Second City Theatre.[9] In 1988, he moved from Second City in Toronto to Chicago. In Chicago, he trained, performed, and taught at the Improv Olympic.\n\nMyers made many appearances, including as Wayne Campbell, on Toronto's Citytv in the early 1980s, on the alternative video show City Limits hosted by Christopher Ward; Myers also made several appearances after the launch of MuchMusic, for which City Limits was essentially the prototype. Myers also appeared as Wayne Campbell in the music video for Ward's Canadian hit \"Boys and Girls\".\n\nThe Wayne Campbell character was featured extensively in the 1986 summer series It's Only Rock & Roll, produced by Toronto's Insight Production Company for CBC Television. Wayne appeared both in-studio and in a series of location sketches directed and edited by Allan Novak. Myers wrote another sketch, \"Kurt and Dieter\", co-starring with Second City's Dana Andersen and also directed by Novak, which later became the popular \"Sprockets\" sketch on Saturday Night Live.\n\nFilm[]\n\nMyers made his film debut when he and Dana Carvey adapted their Wayne's World Saturday Night Live (SNL) sketches into the feature Wayne's World (1992). It was among the most successful films of the year and was followed in 1993 by Wayne's World 2; Myers starred in So I Married an Axe Murderer the same year. He took a two-year hiatus from performing after the end of his time as an SNL regular.\n\nMyers returned to acting with the film Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997), followed by the sequels Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999) and Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002). Myers played the title role (Austin Powers), the villain (Dr. Evil), a henchman (Fat Bastard) and another villain (Goldmember) in all three films.\n\nOne of Myers' rare non-comedic roles came in the film 54 (1998), in which he portrayed Steve Rubell, proprietor of New York City's famous 1970s discotheque Studio 54. The film was not critically or commercially successful, though Myers received some positive notice.[10][11]\n\nIn June 2000, Myers was sued by Universal Pictures for US$3.8 million for backing out of a contract to make a feature film based on his SNL character Dieter. Myers said he refused to honor the US$20 million contract because he felt his script was not ready. Myers countersued, and a settlement was reached after several months where Myers agreed to make another film with Universal. That film, The Cat in the Hat, was released in November 2003 and starred Myers as the title character.[12][13][14] It received negative reviews and performed unsuccessfully at the box office.\n\nIn 2001, Myers provided the voice of Shrek in the DreamWorks animated film of the same name, having taken over the role after the originally planned voice actor Chris Farley died in December 1997. He reprised this role in Shrek 4-D (a theme park ride) in 2003, Shrek 2 (2004), Shrek the Third (2007), the Christmas and Halloween television specials Shrek the Halls (2007) and Scared Shrekless (2010), and Shrek Forever After (2010).\n\nMyers received the MTV Generation Award in June 2007, making him the second Canadian to win the award (following Jim Carrey in 2006).[15]\n\nIn 2008, Myers co-wrote, co-produced, and starred in the poorly received The Love Guru, and in 2009, he had a minor role as British general Ed Fenech in Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds.\n\nIn 2018, after an eight-year hiatus from feature films, Myers appeared in supporting roles in Terminal (2018)[16] and Bohemian Rhapsody (2018).[17]\n\nOther work[]\n\nMyers had a cameo appearance in Britney Spears' music video \"Boys\" as Austin Powers.[18] Britney Spears, in turn, makes a cameo in Austin Powers in Goldmember, performing \"Boys\".\n\nIn a 2005 poll to find The Comedian's Comedian, he was voted among the top 50 comedy acts by fellow comedians and comedy insiders.[19]\n\nMyers is a member of the band Ming Tea along with The Bangles' guitarist and vocalist Susanna Hoffs and musician Matthew Sweet. They performed the songs \"BBC\" and \"Daddy Wasn't There\" from the Austin Powers films.[20]\n\nIn 2011 Myers returned to The Comedy Store in London to perform a one night only comeback of his role with The Comedy Store Players. The UK comedy website Chortle praised his performance.[21]\n\nMyers' 2013 directorial debut, Supermensch: The Legend of Shep Gordon, was selected to be screened in the Gala Presentation section at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival.[22] In 2017, Myers began hosting a reprised version of The Gong Show in heavy makeup as a fictional British host known as Tommy Maitland.[23]\n\nAn avid follower of the Monty Python comedy troupe, in July 2014 Myers appeared on stage at the O2 Arena on the final night of their 10 dates live show, Monty Python Live (Mostly), and also appears on the documentary telefilm Monty Python: The Meaning of Live.[24]\n\nIn April 2019, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Myers will be starring in and executive producing a comedy series for Netflix, with it to last for six episodes and him playing multiple characters.[25]\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nMyers began dating actress and comedy writer Robin Ruzan in the late 1980s after meeting at an ice hockey game in Chicago, during which Myers caught a puck and used the incident as an icebreaker to strike up a conversation with Ruzan. The couple married on May 22, 1993, and Myers later referred to Ruzan as \"his muse\".[26][27] The couple filed for divorce in December 2005.[28]\n\nIn 2006, café owner Kelly Tisdale confirmed reports that she and Myers were dating. Myers and Tisdale married in New York City in a secret ceremony in late 2010.[29] They have three children: a son born in September 2011[30] and two daughters.[31]\n\nMyers is a Dungeons & Dragons player[32] and was one of several celebrities to have participated in the Worldwide Dungeons & Dragons Game Day in 2006.[33]\n\nHe supports the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League.[34] He named two characters in the first Austin Powers film Commander Gilmour and General Borschevsky, after then-Maple Leafs players Doug Gilmour and Nikolai Borschevsky.[35]\n\nMyers has played for Hollywood United F.C., a celebrity soccer team.[36] He played in the 2010 Soccer Aid for UNICEF UK football match, England vs. R.O.W (Rest of the World) and scored his penalty during a sudden-death shootout after the game ended 2–2 (June 6, 2010). The Rest of the World team beat England for the first time since the tournament started. Myers is a fan of Liverpool F.C.[37]\n\nIn 2014, Myers starred in a commercial with his brother Peter for Sears Canada, using \"humorous banter to spread the message that, despite rumours, Sears wasn't shutting down\". Peter at the time was senior director of planning at Sears head office in Toronto, and he was laid off in 2017 after Sears Canada filed for bankruptcy.[7]\n\nIn 2016, Myers published a book, Canada, about the country's history and popular culture.[9]\n\nMyers currently lives in Tribeca, New York.[38]\n\nMyers is also a member of the Canadian charity Artists Against Racism.[39]\n\nAwards and honours[]\n\nIn 2003, he was inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame.[40]\n\nFor contributions to the motion picture industry, Mike Myers was honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7042 Hollywood Boulevard.[41]\n\nIn 2015, his face was put on a stamp by Canada Post.[42]\n\nOn June 30, 2017, he was named an Officer of the Order of Canada by Governor General David Johnston for \"his extensive and acclaimed body of comedic work as an actor, writer and producer.\"[43]\n\nFilmography[]\n\nFilm[]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1992 Wayne's World Wayne Campbell Also writer 1993 So I Married an Axe Murderer Charlie McKenzie / Stuart McKenzie Wayne's World 2 Wayne Campbell Also writer 1997 Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery Austin Powers / Dr. Evil Also writer and producer 1998 54 Steve Rubell Thin Pink Line, The Tim Broderick Pete's Meteor Pete 1999 Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me Austin Powers / Dr. Evil / Fat Bastard Also writer and producer Mystery, Alaska Donnie Shulzhoffer 2001 Shrek Shrek Voice 2002 Austin Powers in Goldmember Austin Powers / Dr. Evil / Fat Bastard / Goldmember Also writer and producer 2003 Nobody Knows Anything!
