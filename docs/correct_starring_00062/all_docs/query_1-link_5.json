        "text": "Mike Myers, one of the most multifaceted performers of his generation, has brought an astonishing array of memorable characters to life in film and television as an actor, director, producer, writer, and creator behind such iconic characters as Wayne Campbell, Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, and Shrek.\n\nMyers made his directorial debut with the award winning documentary, Supermensch: The Legend of Shep Gordon, which chronicles the life of talent manager, Shep Gordon. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and was released by RADiUS-TWC in partnership with A&E IndieFilms. The documentary also earned an Emmy nomination for its “Outstanding Arts and Cultural Programming.”\n\nBorn and raised in Toronto, Canada, Myers began his professional career with Chicago's Second City Troupe. Saturday Night Live producer Lorne Michaels' discovery of Myers at Second City led to his debut as a featured performer and writer on the show in 1989. Myers successfully brought his popular SNL character, Wayne Campbell, to the big screen in Wayne's World and Wayne’s World 2, which he also wrote.\n\nMyers also created, wrote, produced and starred in the smash hit, Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery. Myers portrayal of Austin Powers spawned two sequels, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and Austin Powers: Goldmember. Myers lent his voice to the title role of Shrek, the beloved green ogre for the DreamWorks animated franchise, which include Shrek, Shrek 2, Shrek the Third, and Shrek Forever After. So I Married an Axe Murderer, Myers’ first film following his tenure at SNL, is a cult classic.\n\nMyers received a star on the Walk of Fame in Hollywood, California for his impressive body of work and an ensemble SAG award for his memorable work in Quentin Tarantino’s Inglorious Bastards. He was also honored with the 'Jack Benny Award' by the student body of the University of California, the AFI Star Award at U.S. Comedy Arts Festival, numerous MTV Movie Awards including the MTV Generation Award, and has a star on Canada's Walk of Fame. His character, Shrek, also has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Myers signed an overall deal for television with HBO in 2015."
