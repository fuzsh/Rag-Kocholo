        "text": "Jay Roach has spoken about a potential fourth Austin Powers adventure – the first instalment since 2002's star-studded and bats**t crazy Goldmember.\n\nThe director is responsible for all three of the Austin Powers movies and, last year, Mike Myers (who plays the titular spy) even said the fourth entry was \"looking good\".\n\nSo what's Roach's perspective on any new material?\n\nRelated: Mike Myers revives Austin Powers' Dr Evil for late night skit\n\nHe recently told The Independent: \"We've been trying to think up an idea that could earn a fourth film for a long time, but it's always up to Mike. He and I always thought there was more to do with Dr Evil.\n\n\"To be honest, I don't know how we'd do it without Verne [Troyer]. We always had ideas of revealing a whole life that he had that would have taken his character [Mini-Me] much further. If Mike cracks it and figures it out, we would definitely do some kind of tribute to him. I'm there if he ever wants to do it.\"\n\nRelated: Mike Myers pays tribute to the late Verne Troyer\n\nThe Mini-Me actor sadly passed away back in 2018, after a long battle with alcohol addiction and depression.\n\nHe starred in the last two Austin Powers movies – The Spy Who Shagged Me and Goldmember – so Verne's absence from any new project would be sorely felt."
