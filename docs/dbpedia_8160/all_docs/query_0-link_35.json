Theodore Abu Qurrah himself is one of the main characters in this work, the narrator of Michael's story and not the author. In parallel with “Martyrdom of St. Michael”, another text is preserved in Georgian sources, “The Life of Theodore of Edessa”, which was probably translated from Greek by Ephrem Mtsire. In it, as an integral part of the work, the so-called “Abu Qurrah” is also mentioned, however, with significant changes - the introductory part is omitted, in which Theodore Abu Qurrah is mentioned as the narrator of Michael's story, and Michael himself is quoted as a relative of Theodore of Edessa, Bishop of Edessa.\n\nWe are interested in the relationship between Theodore Abu Qurrah and Theodore of Edessa. We will try to find out what these two figures have in common, whether they were identified with each other and what caused this fact? Was Theodore Abu Qurrah just a literary alter ego, or was he a real person? Why was Theodore Abu Qurrah, the narrator of Michael's story, replaced by Theodore of Edessa in his life? Is it due to the motive of Basil of Emesa - the author of “The Life of Theodore of Edessa”- to further glorify the merits of his uncle, by connecting him with such a great figure as St. Michael or are we dealing with a misunderstanding? Should we consider that in the original version of “Martyrdom of St. Michael” instead of Theodore Abu Qurrah, the story of Michael was told to the sanctuary monks by Theodore of Edessa, who was later replaced by Theodore Abu Qurrah due to a mistake made by a particular person? In addition, we will discuss the relationship between John of Damascus and Theodore Abu Qurrah and present our hypothesis on how the tradition of the disciple-teaching of Theodore Abu Qurrah and John of Damascus should have been established on the basis of the union of John of Damascus and Theodore of Edessa.\n\nKeywords: Theodore, Michael, Martyr, Edessa, Haran\n\n\"Spekali\" #17\n\nStudy of Literature\n\nAvtandil Nadareishvili\n\nThe Relationship between Fantasy Genre and Religion (Based on the works of Rowling, Martin and Tolkien)\n\nDOI: 10.55804/jtsu-1987-8583-15-6\n\nThis article is part of a doctoral dissertation.

It is also considered a hymn of divine devotion. The main idea of the poem ― marriage ― is perceived as an allegory of the return of a person cleansed from sins to the kingdom of God through love. From this point of view, it is noteworthy to understand the symbols of the mentioned text and their relationship with the main problem, self-awareness, raised in “Davitiani”.\n\nKeywords: Self-awareness, Marriage, Robe, Summer\n\n\"Spekali\" #17\n\nStudy of Literature\n\nKetevan Grdzelidze\n\nA Commentary to W.
