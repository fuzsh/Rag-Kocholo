        "text": "Analysis (ai): The poem \"I hate you – I love you\" is a powerful and moving expression of complex emotions. The speaker oscillates between love and hate, admiration and disgust. This ambivalence is reflected in the poem's language, which is at times lyrical and tender, and at others harsh and unforgiving.\n\nThe poem is written in free verse and is notable for its lack of rhyme or formal structure. This gives the poem a sense of spontaneity and urgency. The language is simple and straightforward, but this simplicity is deceptive. The poem is full of subtle imagery and symbolism, which gives it a richness and depth that belies its apparent simplicity.\n\nThe poem is divided into three stanzas. The first stanza expresses the speaker's hatred for the object of their affection. The speaker focuses on the object's weakness, self-pity, and failure to take action. The second stanza expresses the speaker's love for the object. The speaker describes the object as a \"diamond\" that is \"fixed\" to their dreams. The third stanza expresses the speaker's ambivalence towards the object. The speaker acknowledges that their love for the object is poisoned, but they cannot help but feel it.\n\nThe poem has been compared to the work of other poets, such as William Blake and Emily Dickinson. It is similar to Blake's work in its exploration of the human psyche and its use of symbolism. It is similar to Dickinson's work in its use of short, concise lines and its focus on the complexities of human emotion.\n\nThe poem \"I hate you – I love you\" is a powerful and moving expression of complex emotions. It is a poem that will resonate with anyone who has ever experienced the complexities of love and hate.\n\nRead more →"
