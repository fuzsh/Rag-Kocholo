        "text": "Long time followers of Gravity From Above may know that this is actually my second site.\n\nMy long running essay site, The Anadromous Life has also been running a YouTube channel for several years now. It has accrued some interest, with a few videos receiving many thousands of views. (Especially the puppetry lectures.) We would like to take this moment to say that we will be starting two more channels in the very near near future. One is entitled The Anadromist and this one will be closest in content to this site. I’ve felt I needed a place to ramble on about the many kinds of topics that I won’t have time for here. The other will be dedicated to my new life in Tbilisi Georgia.\n\nAnd yes indeed I am now happily living in Tbilisi Georgia. It has been quite the time. I am learning Georgian (Kartuli) and I work for Union of Tbilisi Museums. And I have made good friends. Yet things are not quite as I expected, and that includes financially. My Gravity From Above documentary has stalled again. And I am wondering how I will be able to ship my full container to Georgia within the next year. If you wish to help us out with Gravity From Above you can do so through PayPal. You can choose between a a one time gift or you if you wish you can contribute an amount every month for a year. PayPal is probably the most cost efficient way of helping us with Gravity From Above and moving to Georgia. Thanks for helping me stay afloat with this dream. I couldn’t do it without you.\n\nDONATE HERE.\n\nThanks\n\nFrom Tbilisi, Georgia\n\nByrne Power"
