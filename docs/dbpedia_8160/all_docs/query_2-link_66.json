        "text": "This video is about the books I intend to read or at least start reading in January. My granddaughter is in the thumbnail holding the books but she doesn’t appear in this video. Pandemic restrictions prevent me from having access to a wide selection of books. Public transport is not running and my local bookshop only stocks around three shelves of books in English, from which I have bought all the ones that interest me. In addition, Tbilisi English Book Swap, which has been a great source of reading material, hasn’t been meeting because of the restrictions.\n\nI’d like to read Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy (there will be a readalong of this from 6 January led by Sofia Clef, here is her video about the readalong:\n\nAnother tome I’d like to read is Little Dorrit by Charles Dickens.\n\nI also have Noir, a cyberpunk novel published in 1998 by K W Jeter.\n\nI also added ლექსები – ნოდარი დუმბაძე (Poetry by Nodar Dumbadze), I would like to be able to read a whole book in Georgian, even one intended for six year olds.\n\nIt has been a long time since I last read a novel in French, I have Fort comme la mort by Guy de Maupassant, the story of an aging painter and his mistress, Maupassant was more famous for his short stories than his novels.\n\nFinally I have a fantasy novel on my kindle app called Sword of Kaigen by M L Wang, this was recommended by Gregory LaPerche’s in his video :\n\nI wish you all a happy new year.\n\nIt is tough being isolated\n\nWhen the world is closed\n\nI’m not an expert on poetry, I wouldn’t know an Iambic Pentameter from an anaphora, but I know what I like and I like this. This is a collection of verbally frisky poems for our times. Musings on the lockdown, the pitfalls of online dating and the jobsworth in the chemist’s who deems shampoo a non-essential item.\n\nThere is humour and pathos as the accidental buccanneer steers her course through the “perilous waters” of online dating. Starbucks lemon muffins are likened to “bulging bosoms, veritable sugar tits”. The pixie is not afraid to confront deeper issues like her bipolar disorder and other mental health issues, “peeling back the layers, wondering who I am”. Some of the musings were written during the coronavirus lockdown in London (N22) and reflect on the surrounding paranoia and the binge buying of bog roll, others cover exotic travels to Marrakesh. She wonders whether to “paint a red plague cross on the door.” The pixie sweetly declares that during this pandemic I’m stockpiling hugs and there is plenty of fairy to cut through the gunge . There are many targets for the pixie’s poison pen like the “Poshification of everything”.\n\nThe lockdown is a time for reflection and reaching out to those around us.\n\nLove each other\n\nNow more than ever\n\nIf someone falls silent\n\nSend them a message\n\nMy rating 4.5 out of 5\n\nThree poems by Vazha-Pshavela translated by Donald Rayfield. The three poems are Host and Guest, Aluda and Snake Eater.\n\nVazha-Pshavela is one of the giants of Georgian literature. I often ask my Georgian students who their favourite writer is and Vazha Pshavela comes up in more responses than any other writer. I wanted to see what the fuss was about, so I was happy to find this English translation of his poems at Dry Bridge Market. This was published in Soviet times in 1981. Unfortunately, the translation didn’t inspire me, I don’t know why. It may be that Georgian is so difficult to translate meaninglfully into English, particularly when it comes to poetry. Donald Rayfield has translated many Georgian writers and written books on Georgian Literature, he is an expert on the subject.\n\nMaybe, I will just have to learn Georgian, so I can appreciate the original words. The three poems are about the Khevsurs and their conflict with the Chechens set against a backdrop of the Caucasus Mountains . It is about heroes and shows the problems raised by the interaction of the individual with a mountain society. In the Snake Eater , Mindia, a captive attempts to kill himself by eating a snake: “Mindia thought, if he ate the snake he would be free of his troubled life.” but instead of dying he gains occult powers: “from that day on he understood what birds sang, plants and animals spoke when they were glad or suffering.” Vazha-Pshavela is also writes idiosyncratic and evocative depictions of Nature – for which he felt a deep love. In Host and Guest , Joqola, a Muslim and Zviadauri, a Christian meet by accident as they are hunting in a damp forest. Joqola invites his new companion to his home to celebrate their kill but this hospitality flouts the tradition of enmity between the two tribes and Musa, the rabble rouser, turns on Joqola:\n\nYou headstrong fool, we’ll tie you too, if you defy the common voice. How dare you mutiny against that which we decree is right?"
