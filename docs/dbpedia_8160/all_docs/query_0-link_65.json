        "text": "In the period after Stalin's death and the breakdown of the monolithic dogma of Socialist realism, the most exciting cultural practices were associated with three cults: the cults of youth, individualism and westernness. In the following period of Stagnation (zastoi) and Brezhnev's less liberal political doctrine, the process of cultural disintegration was even intensified. Avtorskaia pesnia (literally “author’s song”) responded ideally to the zeitgeist. It was not only close to individualism, youth culture and student population, but also to the process of cultural disintegration. Avtorskaia pesnia is sometimes called the poetry of wild youth. Emerging as a temporary autonomous zone (cf. Hakim Bey), as part of the so-called apartment culture or the institution of communal art, it is related to the phenomenon of magnitizdat. It directly influenced the development of Russian rock music - it is argued that this is one of the reasons why text dominates over music in Russian rock - and poetry in general. In the period of late Soviet socialism it was probably the most attractive and the most widespread form of cultural production and consumption. In this paper, I will analyze avtorskaia pesnia as a deterritorializing milieu (A. Yurchak) par excellence. In order to address the question of whether Soviet culture was homogeneous or heterogeneous during the Brezhnev era, I will also do a close reading of the poetry of two prominent Russian bards, B. Okudzhava and V. Vysotskii, paying special attention to one of the most authoritative Soviet cultural myths and ideologems, that of “motherland” (rodina).\n\nThis article provides a translation, context and a commentary on Vyacheslav Ivanov’s three Greek poems dedicated to his friends, who were active in Russian Neuhumanismus, the classical scholars Mikhail I. Rostovtsev (Rostovtzeff) and Tadeusz F. Zieliński, and the philosopher of religion Grigory A. Rachinsky. The poems were published in his poetry collection” Nezhnaja tajna”, ΛΕΠΤΑ (“Soft Secret. Light verses”) in St Petersburg in 1912. The Greek poems (and one poem in Latin) were included in the part titled “Humaniorum studiorum cultoribus”. The author argues that the Greek poems can be dated to between 1910–1912, that is, around the time when they were published."
