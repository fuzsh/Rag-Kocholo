        "text": "Vazha-Pshavela, the son of nature\n\n“ Every genius is nourished by his native land. Geniuses are those who can be received by other nations like their innate sons,” Writes famous Georgian poet, Vazha-Pshavela in his iconic essay, “Cosmopolitanism and Patriotism.” Little did he realize that he himself was the personification of all this: A genius, whose work accurately portrays the divinity of earthly energy that unites all life on earth, a child of mountainous region of Pshavi, who felt both the beauty of nature and the chaos humanity caused to it.\n\nSadly, due to the fact that southern Caucasian literature is relatively unknown, other nations barely have any chance to receive Vazha as their “native son.” My hope is that by collecting his work and analyzing it through these translations, Vazha-Pshavela can be as familiar to the world as he is in his homeland of The Republic of Georgia.\n\nIn the 1930’s, a famous philosopher and the founding father of phenomenology, Edmund Husserl, developed various theories that involved Humanizing the Animal and Animalizing the Human. In that study he claimed that an animal’s psyche is far more anthropomorphic than previously thought. Amazing, isn’t it? Vazha realized the same thoughts, but used literature instead of scientific experiments. He made allusions to a proud eagle or an antagonistic spade with his poems and stories. His writing contains many interesting and deep characters, despite the fact that some of them aren’t even homo sapiens.\n\nThe best example of this would be his famous poem, “The Eagle”:\n\nThe eagle\n\nI saw an eagle, which was wounded,\n\nHe was at war with ravines and spades,\n\nInjured, he struggled getting up,\n\nBut could not, he had no aid…\n\nOne wing on the ground he carries,\n\nWith blood evident on his chest:\n\n“Oh, watch out spades, be warry!\n\nYou had me at my worst,\n\nIf not, I would have seen your feathers,\n\nScattered all over the valley, first!”\n\nA lot of local literary critics believe that the main character, a wounded eagle, is a personification of Georgia, authors homeland itself, because of its rough history and geopolitical location, but according to some sources, Vazha has denied metaphorical aspect of the verse numerous times, claiming that he had seen this specific scene play out right before his eyes, while being out in the woods.\n\nThe story of an eagle does not end here, it continues in another poem, called “Futile War”:\n\nFutile war\n\nSpade and raven could not give each other rest,\n\nOn the eagle’s nest:\n\nFrom head to mouth, one devoured the other,\n\nOn the stolen land of another,\n\nFrom beak to beak,\n\nTo claws, breezing through,\n\nBoth had the desire,\n\nForeign land to acquire,\n\nThose fools Think: The owner of this nest,\n\nUp, in the mountains, has been laid to rest,\n\nLittle do they know of the eagle,\n\nThat is approaching, roaming the skies,\n\nHis land is calling,\n\nWhile fire burns in his eyes!\n\nSpade and raven are clearly portrayed as an evil force in this story: cowardly, violent and antagonistic, even towards each other. We also see our eagle, the main character, potentially getting the justice he deserves, or rather, the nature deserves, because everything going according to its plan is a major supporting theme in poet’s work.\n\nAs I have mentioned earlier, the role of a solitary philosopher isn’t the only part Vazha played as the member of progressive society in Georgia: he was also an avid political and social critic, publicist, known for his complex and honest ways of approaching the problem, who was especially vocal in his criticism of the Georgian Orthodox Church, which was strongly influenced by Russian imperialism and power, which he found very disgraceful and offensive, as he himself also identified as a Georgian orthodox.\n\nVazha was also interested in metaphysical evolution of Christianity and how the believers viewed Christ, as messiah.\n\nDo we live up to gods’ expectations? Do we function morally as a society? Are we loyal to the legacy of Christ?\n\nThose and many other theological questions form one of my favorite poems by him, called “Where is the Christ, or his teachings?”\n\nWhere is the Christ, or his teachings?\n\nWhat kind of existence am I in? What has fallen upon me?\n\nI have almost gone mad and became a beast,\n\nOn human flesh, I feast,\n\nI drink human blood, like water,\n\nWith millions of gallons not being enough per day,\n\nI am Worthy of being called humankind’s hunger,\n\nI despise myself, for living that way,\n\nEven so, I cannot change, being astray.\n\nOh, how was the Nazarene deceived,\n\nWhen he thought that brotherhood and unity, he could achieve!\n\nhe acknowledged,\n\nSuch love, as he believed in it, himself,\n\nIn Christianity and its teachings, as well,\n\nHow do we get misled, where does it start?\n\nEverything seems to be distantly apart,\n\nas the revelation was late,\n\nFor these beliefs, he was crucified:\n\nHe has planted his wisdom, in a form of a tree, for it to reside,\n\nOh, how he suffered, how he tried,\n\nSo that men would not be pitted like wolfs, against one another,\n\nShow me the fruit his sacrifice bore,\n\nWhen and where have you tasted its core?\n\nWhen will the time come,\n\nFor humans to call each other “brother”?!\n\nGeorgia, always war-torn and suffering, has bred many geniuses, with Vazha being one of the most distinguished ones, but because of little to no cultural/global integration, those geniuses are often forgotten in the lengthy mazes of time. My mission, as a young Georgian, is to keep our legacy alive, in any ways I can and even though this article is not perfect, I hope you know more about my country than you did yesterday.\n\nUsed literature:\n\nVazha-Pshavela, “Cosmopolitism and Patriotism”, translation by Rebecca Gould and Natalia Bukia-Peters.\n\nHusserl (1973: 317): “Die humanisierte […] Welt, in der […] alles Weltliche humanen Sinn hat”.\n\nAll of the above poems were translated by me."
