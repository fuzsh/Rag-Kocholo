        "text": "Our Hotels\n\nAccommodation as part of the cultural experience of the trip\n\nWe believe that accommodation reflects the cultural experience of a trip, so we choose our guests' accommodation very carefully.\n\nWe do not put our guests in chain hotels, but in smaller, typical local accommodation. We do this best in the countryside, away from the big cities, but as we travel in small groups, we can usually manage this in the big cities such as Tbilisi, Kutaisi or Batumi.\n\nTo give you a better idea of your stay in Georgia, we have put together a small list of the types of accommodation we usually stay in when travelling.\n\nCentrally located hotel in the old town. The rooms are spacious and the hotel is tastefully decorated. The hotel is run by the owner herself, who takes great care to ensure the satisfaction of her guests.\n\nA great advantage of the hotel is that, despite its central location, it is very quiet and cosy.\n\nThe small Hotel Capra is run with love and passion by Zini and Shako, a young Georgian couple.\n\nAll the rooms have a fantastic view of the mountains and you can enjoy the scenery from your room without having to go outside.\n\nThe young landlady Zini is an excellent cook and spoils her guests with delicious regional specialities.\n\nHotel Tower was one of the first modern family hotels in Stepantsminda with comfortable rooms and private bathrooms. The hotel does not have a perfect view of the famous Kazbek Mountain, but the location of the hotel is very quiet and you can also walk to the centre of town in about 10 minutes.\n\nMost of the rooms are relatively small, but have all the necessary amenities for a relaxing stay.\n\nThe hospitable owner Ruso runs the small hotel herself, cooks her own meals and makes all guests feel at home.\n\nLocated in the historic Green Flower quarter above the old town of Kutaisi, Hotel Green Flower is run by a young West Georgian couple. The hotel has a perfect view over the city and a good location not far from the centre.\n\nThe rooms are very spacious and most of the beds are larger than average.\n\nThe hostess - Ana - and her mother cook delicious West Georgian specialities, and her husband Shota makes excellent but somewhat unusual regional wines in their own wine cellar in the basement of the hotel.\n\nBeko, a trained carpenter, is the owner of this very cosy hotel and built the entire building, including the interior, together with his brother and his father.\n\nBeko usually receives the guests himself and his family cooks very tasty specialities with various mountain herbs. Dinner at Beko is delicious, but breakfast exceeds all expectations.\n\nAll the rooms are very tastefully furnished and most of them are made of wood.\n\nThe hotel, now a small hotel complex with farming, bee-keeping and livestock, is a good example of what a person can achieve if they work hard and with determination.\n\nThe landlord, Walodia, started offering rooms and good food at a time when there was little interest in the region and the roads were very bad. But after some 20 years, the one-man show has become a real family business.\n\nFamily-run hotels\n\nFamily-run hotels are a special type of accommodation in Georgia. As the name suggests, they are run by local families. They are not star hotels, but they are clean and well maintained.\n\nAll the rooms have their own bathroom (most of them have free Wi-Fi) and they host their guests with excellent local specialities that are prepared with a lot of love.\n\nPlease note that local standards are not always the same as European standards. The management of these establishments is often makeshift, but the staff are very friendly. However, you may find a window stuck or a lock not working."
