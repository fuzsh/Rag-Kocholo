        "text": "2022\n\n“A Doll’s House Reimagined”: Annual Ibsen Lecture 2022 with playwright Tanika Gupta (UK)\n\nThis year’s guest of honour for the Annual Ibsen Lecture is British playwright Tanika Gupta. Her adaptation of Henrik Ibsen’s A Doll’s House is on the National Curriculum in UK secondary education.\n\nTime and place: Dec. 15, 2022 6:00 PM – 8:00 PM, Ibsen Museum & Teater, Henrik Ibsens gate 26, 0255 Oslo\n\nThe event is taking place at the newly renovated Ibsen Museum & Teater. The museum is currently closed to the public, but will generously open its doors for this special event. Coffee will be served, and admission is free.\n\nTanika Gupta\n\nOver the past 25 years, Tanika has written more than 25 stage plays that have been produced in major theatres across the UK and has written extensively for television and BBC Radio drama. Tanika’s play The Empress and her adaptation of A Doll’s House are on the National Curriculum in the UK for GSCE school examinations in higher education.\n\nRead more about Tanika’s work\n\nTanika’s adaptation of A Doll’s House transposes the setting of Ibsen’s classic play to India in 1879 where ‘Nora’, now Niru, is an Indian woman married to ‘Torvald’, now Tom, an English man working for the British Colonial Administration in Calcutta. Niru risks her own reputation in order to save her husband’s and in the process discovers herself.\n\nThis new version of A Doll’s House takes a fresh look at the play shining a light on British colonial history and race relations as well as gender politics and class.\n\nAssociate Professor Liyang Xia at the Centre for Ibsen Studies will have a conversation with Tanika about the idea behind this play, its relevance to today’s world and the rehearsal process.\n\nReadings of excerpts from Gupta’s version of A Doll’s House will be performed by Lavleen Kaur and Simon Lay.\n\nAbout the actors\n\nLavleen Kaur is a Norwegian actress and dancer of Indian origin. She is also a writer, director and criminologist.\n\nNorwegian media crowned her as Henrik Ibsen's “First Lady” in 2006, as she made history by being the first woman of immigrant background ever to be casted for three of his plays’ leading role in Norway's three most prestigious theatres that year: As Nora in A Doll’s House at The National Theatre, as Hedda Gabler in Hedda Gabler at Rikstheatret and as Ekanta/Elida Wangel in Lady from the Indian Sea at The Central Theatre.\n\nSimon Lay is a British actor who has lived in Oslo since 1994. As well as working in films and television he has worked extensively in theatre in England, France and Italy and since 2001 has regularly directed at Rogaland Teater.\n\nAbout The Annual Ibsen Lecture\n\nHosted annually by the Centre for Ibsen Studies at UiO, Annual Ibsen Lecture invites internationally renowned scholars and practitioners to share their views and practices of Ibsen’s works. Previous guests include Narve Fulsås and Tore Rem (2021), Sabiha Huq and Robert Mshengu Kavanagh (2020), Samuel Adamson (2019), Joan Templeton (2015), Mark Sandberg (2013), Thomas Ostermeier (2010), Erika Fischer-Lichte (2008), and Terry Eagleton (2007).\n\nIn-house Seminar: Ibsen, Adaptation, and the Question of Progress\n\nOlivia Noble Gunn, Associate Professor of Scandinavian Studies at the University of Washington, will present her ongoing book project on Future Ghosts.\n\nTime and place: Nov. 23, 2022 2:15 PM – 4:00 PM, Seminar room 4, Sophus Bugges hus\n\nMy current book project, Future Ghosts: Ibsen, Adaptation, and the Question of Progress, explores a particular archive of hauntology: twenty-first century adaptations of Henrik Ibsen’s major works in drama, film, performance, and the novel. In this talk, I focus on the concept of progress before turning to the example of Indian Arm (2105), an adaptation of Little Eyolf by Japanese Canadian playwright Hiro Kanagawa. I argue that Kanagawa’s adaptation conjures the hegemonic history of child-saving, its philosophies and policies of de- and re-homing children, across the span of the twentieth century (the century of the child and of death). Especially when read together, Little Eyolf and Indian Arm raise the specter of delinquency and the haunted grounds of the boarding school. Finally, I return to the concept of progress by considering how my approach to Ibsen in Future Ghosts might raise the specter of anachronism. What does it mean to use contemporary adaptations to revisit the past?\n\nOlivia Noble Gunn is Associate Professor of Scandinavian Studies and the Sverre Arestad Endowed Chair in Norwegian Studies at the University of Washington, Seattle. Her latest book is Empty Nurseries, Queer Occupants: Reproduction and the Future in Ibsen’s Late Plays (Routledge 2020).\n\nPlease note that this event will be live streamed on Zoom.

Henrik Ibsen og dekadansen (\"Abnormal\" Women. Henrik Ibsen and Decadence).\n\nThe event will be held in person (not streamed). You will find the room on the third floor of Georg Sverdrups hus, above Café Georg (not within the library itself).\n\nTime and place: Oct. 18, 2022 2:15 PM – 4:00 PM, Undervisningsrom 1, Georg Sverdrups hus\n\nEivind Tjønneland is professor emeritus of Scandianvian Literature at the University of Bergen. For ten years he also taught History of Ideas at the University of Oslo. He has published extensively on Henrik Ibsen. Apart form a dozen articles and the book Ibsen og moderniteten (1993), he edited the two anthologies Gloria Amoris - Kjærlighetens Komedie 150 år (2012) on Love's Comedy and Henrik Ibsens Kongs-Emnerne - teater, historie og resepsjon (2020) on The Pretenders.

This book is the theme of today's seminar.\n\nIn-house Seminar: Ibsen the Seducer. Male Power at Play on Female Psyche. On Ibsen and the “Princesses”\n\nAstrid Sæther (University of Oslo) will present her recent book I skyggen av Ibsen (In Ibsen's Shadow).\n\nThe event will be held in person. Zoom streaming will be provided, but registration is mandatory for remote attendance. A Zoom link will be sent on the day of the seminar.\n\nTime and place: Sep. 15, 2022 2:15 PM – 4:00 PM, Seminar room 4, Sophus Bugges hus\n\nDuring a decade (1889 – 1899) Ibsen successively established short, but intensive relations with four young women. They have been portrayed in biographies written by men as power seeking, greedy, vampires, like beings that sucked on Ibsen’s fame. A closer study shows that these women were not predators but victims. Who were the four “princesses”, as he named them? Can these relationships be analyzed through Kierkegaard’s character John the Seducer in Either / Or (1843)? This lecture, based on Astrid Sæther's recent book I skyggen av Ibsen, is a biographical contribution to Ibsen scholarship.\n\nAstrid Sæther is an Associate Professor Emerita at the University of Oslo's Centre for Ibsen Studies. She was a Senior lecturer at the University of Copenhagen (1979-89), Associate Professor of Scandinavian Literature and Director of the Ibsen Center at the University of Oslo (1990 – 2015), as well as a Visiting Professor at UC Berkeley, Scandinavian Department (2013). She is the author or editor of several books and articles on Ibsen, among these: \"Ibsen and Brandes\" (2006), \"Suzannah. Fru Ibsen\" (2008), \"The Biographical Ibsen\" (2009), \"Ibsen between Cultures\" (2016), and \"I skyggen av Ibsen\" (2022).\n\nIN HOUSE-SEMINAR DOUBLE BILL: Ibsen's Middle Ages / Roles in Ibsen's plays\n\nSolenne Guyot (University of Strasbourg, France) and Paulo Ricardo Berton (Federal University of Santa Catarina, Brazil) will present their ongoing projects as guest researchers at the Centre for Ibsen Studies.\n\nThe event will be held in person. Zoom streaming will provided, but registration is mandatory for those attending on Zoom.\n\nTime and place: Aug. 8, 2022 2:15 PM – 4:00 PM, Seminar room 210, Henrik Wergelands hus\n\nPart I - Ibsen's Middle Ages (Solenne Guyot)\n\nWhile Ibsen is considered the “father of modern drama”, the way he fabricated a certain vision of the Middle Ages in his plays has received little attention from posterity. Yet, Ibsen had devoted himself to the writing of medieval historical dramas at the beginning of his career, and references connected to the medieval world also appear in his later plays. By studying the presence of the Middle Ages in Ibsen’s works — and not only in the historical ones — the aim of this project is to reconsider the traditional categorisation of the dramatist’s production. The classification of his production into three distinct categories (historical/realist/psychological dramas) focuses on what differentiates Ibsen's plays. However, the project investigates how intertextuality between Ibsen’s plays and the Icelandic sagas, the Nordic ballads and the Germanic legends can be seen as an element of continuity throughout his production.\n\nPart II - Roles in Ibsen's Plays (Paulo Ricardo Berton)\n\nAccording to semiotician A. J. Greimas, there are four levels of manifestation of character: the actant, the role, the character itself and the actor. The intermediary function - the role - is a connector between the deepest structures, which exist only on an abstract level, and the finished character description, a complete creation, realized in the stage through its representation by the actor. This seminar will then propose six roles that Ibsen will repeatedly develop in his work: firstly a couple formed by a man and a woman, then a detonator that will shake the marital structure, and beyond these three, an old love, a son/daughter and a new love. These roles will be exemplified through some of the plays written by the Norwegian playwright.\n\nSolenne Guyot is a first-year PhD student in Scandinavian Studies at the University of Strasbourg. She received a B.A. in Humanities, a M.A. in General and Comparative Literature and a M.A. in Medieval Studies. She currently teaches courses on European interculturality and Scandinavian literature for Bachelor’s students at the University of Strasbourg.\n\nPaulo Ricardo Berton is an Associate Professor II of Literature (PPGLit/UFSC) and Dramatic Writing, Theater Direction and History and Theory of Drama and Theater (ART/UFSC), currently in post-doctoral leave at the Wiener Wortstätten (Vienna/Austria).\n\n2020\n\nIbsen in Arabic\n\nThe Norwegian Embassy in Cairo has the pleasure to invite you to a webinar on Ibsen in Arabic.\n\nTime and place: Dec. 14, 2020 4:00 PM–6:00 PM, ZOOM\n\nOn the occasion of the project “Ibsen in Translation” coming to an end, the Norwegian Embassy in Cairo wishes to celebrate the famous Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen, and shed some light on him and his work’s prominent place in Arabic, and especially Egyptian, society, literature and culture.\n\nThe “Ibsen in Translation” project has been led by the Centre of Ibsen Studies at the University of Oslo. It is a unique translation project where translators work together, exchanging experiences in the course of the translation work. The project aims to translate Henrik Ibsen's 12 contemporary dramas into 8 languages directly from Norwegian, including classical Arabic and Egyptian Arabic.\n\nThroughout this webinar, we hope to discuss Ibsen in Arabic, both from a linguistic perspective, but also from a more societal and cultural point of view. To contribute to this discussion, we have the honour of having with us a distinguished set of panellists.\n\nProgram\n\n17:00 - 17:05.

Huq is an Ibsen scholar who received her doctoral degree from the Centre for Ibsen Studies in 2014. Her research has focused on South Asian Ibsen adaptations in various post-colonial contexts. Her latest book in the working is Ibsen on the Decolonised South Asian Stage: Traversing Texts and Contexts.\n\nIn their discussion, McLaren and Huq will touch upon how Ibsen has been viewed, practiced and received in Africa and South Asia, as well as their own practice and research in theatre. The discussion will be moderated by Associate Professor Liyang Xia from the Centre for Ibsen Studies. The audience will have opportunity to ask questions towards the end of the webinar.\n\nBios\n\nAbout Robert Malcolm McLaren\n\nRobert Malcolm McLaren (aka Robert Mshengu Kavanagh) is a fourth generation South African of Scottish descent.

Most of these adaptations premiered in the mid-1930s—a period in film history that saw a marked decrease in Ibsen adaptations on a global scale: Fritz Wendhausen’s Peer Gynt (1934), Detlef Sierck’s Stützen der Gesellschaft (1935, and Hans Steinhoff’s Ein Volksfeind (1937).\n\nOne important reason why the Nazis appropriated Norwegian literature in general and Ibsen in specific, is found in their mission to restore an alleged lost ‘Nordic’ or ‘German’ identity. In 1933, for instance, publicist Eberhard Freidank wrote an article on the frantic call to ‘hyper-Nordify’ Germany by spiritual and cultural means. Nazi ideologues projected onto the Nordic man an ideal self in terms of a positive image. This perceived thus represented an antidote to the dark double of the “Jew.” Against this backdrop, Ibsen was “adopted” as a German writer, his plays appropriated in line with Nazi ideology, and the Norwegian settings of the film adaptations served as Germany’s displaced doubles.\n\nIn this in-house seminar, Thor Holt will present how Nazi cinema (mis)used Ibsen in order to provide a positive source of orientation for German audiences. One key to an understanding of the ideological labor of these Ibsen adaptations is found in the specific modalities of othering that came into play when the Nazi era Ibsen adaptations screened in front of audiences in the Third Reich. The settings of these Ibsen adaptations gradually blurred the boundaries between Norway and Germany in films that anticipated the annexation of Norway and supported this alleged homecoming as a driving force in the Nazi worldview.\n\nThor Holt obtained his PhD from the University of Oslo in January 2020. He is currently associate professor at the Centre for Ibsen Studies\n\nWebinar: The Greatest Event in A Doll’s Life – Who are the “Noras” in today’s China?\n\nIn-house Webinar: Associate Professor Liyang Xia (Centre for Ibsen Studies) will have a conversation with some of the artists involved in the theatre piece The Greatest Event in a Doll’s Life and discuss topics such as the creative process, the societal impact, and the controversies of this project.\n\nTime and place: May 28, 2020 10:00 AM–11:30 AM, Online webinar\n\nHow you may join the lecture\n\nPlease use the zoom link: https://uio.zoom.us/j/63524060505\n\nAbout the webinar\n\nIn 2019, a group of four Shanghai-based women in their late twenties and early thirties created a Chinese/English bilingual performance called The Greatest Event in a Doll’s Life. This project merges concepts from Ibsen’s A Doll’s House (1879) and Chinese literary master Hu Shi’s The Greatest Event in Life (1919), the latter being inspired by the former. The Chinese name of this production—Sheng Nü Zhi Jia (Home of “Leftover Women”)—points to the focal issue that the artists hope to address: the phenomenon of a state-sanctioned propaganda to pressure Chinese women over the age of 25 into marriage and motherhood.\n\nGuo Yangyang, Lelia TahaBurt, Lin Cuixi and Selena Lu, being both creators and performers of the project, tell their personal stories about their relationship to marriage, family, and womanhood through this theatre piece. Their project was the winner of Ibsen Scholarship in 2019 for having the ambition to “become a revolutionary feminist manifesto of our time”.\n\nAbout LIN Cuixi\n\nLIN Cuixi is contemporary theatre maker, performer and a former computer programmer. With a special interest in gender narratives and human-technology relationship, she makes evocative performances through cross-disciplinary and collaborative processes. Recent works include 'The Greatest Event in a Dolls' Life', 'Annata', 'cybercafe' and ‘SOUP’ (McaM Shanghai/Wuzhen International Theatre Festival, 2018).\n\nAbout Fabrizio Massini\n\nFabrizio Massini was starting off as performer and director in Florence, Fabrizio embarked on a sinological career in 2002 with a BA in Intercultural Studies from the University of Florence.

This lecture will be held as a webinar because of the coronavirus.\n\nTime and place: May 15, 2020 2:15 PM–4:00 PM, Zoom\n\nHow you may join the lecture\n\nhttps://uio.zoom.us/j/63211303060 Meeting ID: 632 1130 3060\n\nAbout the webinar\n\nProfessor Ellen Rees explores the significance of the racialized status of the character Gerd in Ibsen’s \"Brand\", the dramatic poem that launched his literary career in 1866.\n\nGerd and the play’s protagonist are widely recognized as having a “mysterious sibling relationship,” but why does Ibsen complicate this family relationship by revealing her status as half Roma (or “Tater”) in the fourth act? Why have nearly all scholars ignored Gerd’s racialized status? Why is Gerd’s ethnicity so often erased in the casting of stage productions? Ibsen wrote \"Brand\" at a time when official policies concerning minoritized groups were becoming increasingly oppressive in Norway. The webinar will explore how Ibsen engaged with, perpetuated, and undermined stereotypes regarding one of Europe’s oldest and most unfairly vilified ethnic groups.\n\nWelcome to the webinar!\n\nWebinar: \"Et dukkehjem\" in Slovenian\n\nIn-house Webinar: Guest lecture by assistant professor Marija Zlatnar Moe about translating drama between peripheral languages - translating Ibsen into Slovenian. This guest lecture will be held as a webinar, as the first scheduled event was canceled because of the coronavirus.\n\nTime: Apr. 2, 2020 2:15 PM–4:00 PM\n\nHow you may join the lecture\n\nConnect to the webinar (Zoom) on and use the password: 070492.\n\nTranslation of peripherical languages\n\nTranslation between peripheral languages has its particularities, and translating drama even more so.\n\n- I will touch upon particularities in connection with drama translation from Norwegian (bokmål) into Slovene, and present the first findings from my research on the five available translations of Ibsen's \"Et dukkehjem\" in Slovene, which appeared between 1892 and 2016. Three of them are indirect translations, probably via German, and only one has so far been published in a book. \"Et dukkehjem\" is, however, considered a classic in Slovenia and a part of the secondary school literary curriculum, which would probably warrant a new modern translation of the play for use in schools, says Zlatnar Moe.\n\nAbout Maria Zlatnar Moe\n\nMaria Zlatnar Moe is assistant professor at the faculty of Arts, University of Ljubljana in Slovenia. This spring she is a guest researcher at the Centre for Ibsen Studies.\n\nAssitant professor Moe works at the Department of translation at Universitet of Ljubljana where she teaches general translation courses from English into Slovene at the BA level, literary translation and translation for arts and humanities at the MA level. Her research is focused mainly on literary translation with a focus on translation between peripheral/minor languages, drama (re)translation, the ideological issues of translation, translation of sacred texts and translation didactics.\n\nShe also works as a literary translator from English and Norwegian into Slovene. Among her recent publications, Center and Periphery: Power relations in the world of translation (with Tanja Žigon and Tamara Mikolič Južnič). Ljubljana: Znanstvena založba Filozofske fakultete, 2019.\n\nWelcome to the webinar!\n\nIn-House Seminar with Olivia N. Gunn\n\n\"Ibsen and the \"Nanny Chapter\": Women's Labor in the Late Plays\"\n\nTime and place: Feb. 11, 2020 2:15 PM–4:00 PM, seminar room 1, P.A Munchs hus\n\nWho is the proper occupant of the nursery? The obvious answer is the child, and not an archive, a seductive troll-princess, or poor fosterlings. Nevertheless, characters in \"Hedda Gabler\", \"The Master Builder\", and \"Little Eyolf\" intend to host these improper occupants in their children’s rooms. Dr. Gunn calls these dramas ‘the empty nursery plays’ because they all describe rooms intended for offspring, as well as characters’ plans for refilling that space.\n\nOne might expect nurseries to provide an ideal setting for a realist playwright to dramatize contemporary problems. Rather than mattering to Ibsen in terms of naturalist detail or explicit social critique, however, they are reserved for the maintenance of characters’ fears and expectations concerning the future. Empty Nurseries, Queer Occupants intervenes in scholarly debates in child studies by arguing that the empty bourgeois nursery is a better symbol for innocence than the child. Here, ‘emptiness’ refers to the common construction of the child as blank and latent. In Ibsen, the child is also doomed or deceased, and thus essentially absent, but nurseries persist as spaces of memorialization and potential alike.\n\nNurseries also gesture toward the domains of childhood and women’s labor, from birth to domestic service. ‘Bourgeois nursery’ points to the classed construction of innocence and to the more materialist aspects of this book, which inform our understanding of domesticity and family in the West and uncover a set of reproductive connotations broader than ‘the innocent child’ can convey.\n\nAbout Olivia Noble Gunn\n\nOlivia Noble Gunn is Assistant Professor and the Sverre Arestad Endowed Chair in Norwegian Studies in the Department of Scandinavian Studies at the University of Washington, Seattle.

He will be visiting Oslo to discuss his latest play Wife (2019), inspired by A Doll’s House.\n\nTime and place: Nov. 21, 2019 6:00 PM–8:00 PM, National Library, Store Auditorium on 1st floor\n\n“A rousing look at 60 years of sexual identity.” -Michael Billington, The Guardian\n\n“This is the most important adaptation of A Doll’s House I have come across in recent years.” -Julie Holledge, Professor, Centre for Ibsen Studies\n\nThe Centre for Ibsen Studies proudly presents an evening with Samuel Adamson at the Annual Ibsen Lecture on 21 November at the National Library. Adamson has previously reworked Ibsen’s \"A Doll’s House\" (2003), \"Pillars of the Community\" (2005) and \"Little Eyolf\" (Mrs. Affleck, 2009); the last two were commissioned by the Royal National Theatre in London. \"Samuel Adamson’s exciting new play explores the evolving institution of marriage. Sam has had a long relationship with Ibsen. We are delighted to have him in Oslo in order to discuss the disconcerting and surprising aspects of Ibsen’s works that are made relevant again and again by dramatists like him,\" says Liyang Xia, Acting Head of the Centre for Ibsen Studies.\n\nThe Annual Ibsen Lecture includes an exclusive discussion between Adamson and Xia. It will also feature a special reading of scenes from Wife by actors Erik A. Schjerven, Amalie Krogh and Veronika Smit​.\n\nIn \"Wife\", Adamson expands Ibsen’s narrative to explore the power relations in same-sex relationships, giving a new twist to the ever-growing interpretations of Ibsen’s most infamous ending. “The great quality of his play is that it shows we are still waiting for the miracle promised at the end of \"A Doll’s House\" and that the quest for the ideal continues,” The Guardian wrote after the play’s premiere in London earlier this year.\n\nSamuel Adamson is the winner of \"Whatsonstage Theatregoers’ Choice Best New Play Award 2008\" and \"Evening Standard Theatre Awards 2014\".\n\nThe Annual Ibsen Lecture is free and open to the public. Previous speakers have included Terry Eagleton (UK), Thomas Ostermeier (Germany) and Joan Templeton (US).\n\nIn-house seminar 31.

The film, however, has been discussed as subversive to the pressures of Nazi ideology; director Detlef Sierck (Douglas Sirk) described his Ibsen film as a film aesthetic breakthrough in the acclaimed book Sirk on Sirk (1971). Detlef Sierck changed his name to Dougals Sirk after he emigrated to California in 1939. Before he left the Third Reich, Sierck made some the best films in Nazi cinema and turned Swedish actor Zarah Leander into a superstar. His melodramas, perhaps most notably La Habanera (1937) for Ufa under Hitler and Imitation of Life for Universal under Eisenhower, have been hailed as subversive masterpieces—and have inspired some of the most influential directors in film history. “I have seen six films by Douglas Sirk. Among them were the most beautiful in the world,” Rainer Werner Fassbinder once said.\n\nWith Pillars of Society, Sierck/Sirk made a film that both confirms and opposes Nazi ideology. Heinrich George, known as the foreman of the Heart Machine in Fritz Lang’s Metropolis (1927) and Franz Biberkopf in Phil Jutzi’s Berlin Alexanderplatz (1931), plays the main role as consul Bernick.\n\nIntroduction before and discussion after the film\n\nThe film will be introduced by Thor Holt from the Centre for Ibsen Studies. Holt has written a PhD dissertation on film adaptations of Ibsen in the Third Reich. After the screening, he will be joined by actor Julie Støp Husby, who played Dina Dorf in Riksteatret/Nationaltheatret’s Pillars of Society in 2016, and Eirik Frisvold Hanssen, head of the film section at the National Library of Norway.\n\nBoth the introduction and the debate will be held in English.

Lene Therese Teigen will present the DESK-project (2010-2013), in which she and her collaborators discovered, reread and presented the plays to an audience. Thoughts on structure and content in the plays of some of these playwrights will be presented. She will also reflect upon women’s roles in Norwegian society in the period. Welcome!\n\nAbout Lene Therese Teigen\n\nLene Therese Teigen is a writer-director, based in Oslo. She was educated at the University in Bergen with a major in theatre studies, specializing in dramaturgy and directing, and has professor competence in playwriting. Her plays are being produced in Norway and abroad, sometimes with herself as director. She has published three novels and an anthology on drama history in addition to her plays. Integration of academic research with artistic works is central to her production. As a playwright she creates texts with several equal characters, and her works are marked by a special focus on gender awareness and equality.\n\nIbsen in Weimar Cinema\n\nCentre for Ibsen Studies announces the first ever cinema screening of Victor Barnowsky’s Peer Gynt (1919) in Norway. The film will be introduced by Thor Holt from the Centre for Ibsen Studies. A discussion will follow after the screening.\n\nTime and place: Sep. 16, 2019 7:00 PM, Oslo 16 (earlier: Stenersen Museum), Munkedamsveien 15, Oslo\n\nEvent registration\n\nRegister here: thor.holt@ibsen.uio.no\n\nEntrance: Free\n\nAbout the film\n\nPeer Gynt (1919) was produced before, but premiered after Germany’s military and moral defeat in World War I. The famous theater director Victor Barnowsky teamed up with star producer Richard Oswald in order to turn the most popular Ibsen play in Germany into a silent film. Some of the top stars in what should be known as Weimar cinema joined them. Conrad Veidt (a strange passenger and the button-moulder) soon performed the iconic role as the somnambulist in The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920). Ilka Grüning (mother Aase) is perhaps most famous for her role in Casablanca (1942).\n\nBarnowsky’s Ibsen adaptation was originally launched in two parts: Peer Gynts Jugend og Peer Gynts Wanderjahre und Tod. «Peer Gynt surpasses the so-called average production by far, and it will find a grateful audience. Not to mention that it will become a box-office hit anyway because of its world-famous title,» critic B. von Joachim predicted in Der Film in April 1919. What did the German audience see in 1919 that we cannot see or grasp today? Peer Gynt misfired both commercially and ideologically; Barnowsky never made a film again.\n\nPeer Gynt (1919) was found by EYE Film Institute in Amsterdam—the national, Dutch film archive. A couple of years ago, a new digital restoration from the original nitrate copy was carried out by the National Library of Norway. The first public screening of the film was at the National Library in 2017. Peer Gynt is screened at a cinema (in DCP quality) for the first time at Oslo16 this Monday.\n\nThe National Library has translated the Dutch intertitles into English. Thanks to Beta Film for permission to screen the film.\n\nThe exclusive screening is made possible in cooperation with the National Library of Norway and the film centre Oslo16.\n\nFilm details\n\nRunning time: 58 minutes\n\nOriginal title: Peer Gynts Jugend and Peer Gynts Wanderjahre und Tod\n\nProduced: Germany, 1918\n\nDirected by: Victor Barnowsky\n\nText: English\n\nFormat: DCP\n\nOrganizer\n\nCentre for Ibsen Studies in cooperation with Oslo16 and the National Library of Norway\n\nIn-house seminar: Tracts, Tragedy, and Trolls. Ibsen in the USA\n\nWelcome to the autumn's first In-house seminar at the Centre for Ibsen Studies!\n\nTime and place: Aug. 28, 2019 2:15 PM–4:00 PM, Seminar room 210, Henrik Wergelands Hus, Blindern Campus\n\nDean Krouk, Assistant Professor of Nordic Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, will lecture on \"Tracts, Tragedy, and Trolls: Some Thoughts on the History of Ibsen in the United States\".\n\nIs there an American version of Ibsen? Not really, but this talk will discuss some telling moments in the history of the reception and interpretation of Ibsen in the US, from the early, non-English-language engagements to midcentury figures such as Arthur Miller and Eva Le Gallienne to the recent explosion of interest in “An Enemy of the People.”\n\nEntrance is free and everyone is welcome. Even if you, just as Marilyn, have only read Arthur Miller's version of \"An Enemy of the People\"...\n\nStaging the Nineteenth Century: Ibsen, Hegel, Nietzsche\n\nKristin Gjesdal (Temple University, USA).\n\nTime and place: Apr. 26, 2019 1:00 PM–2:00 PM, Seminarrom 7, P.A. Munchs hus, 1. etg\n\nHenrik Ibsen’s work has long fascinated philosophically-minded readers. From Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud to Theodor W. Adorno and Stanley Cavell, philosophers have argued that Ibsen’s work raises questions of profound intellectual value. Less attention, though, has been given to Ibsen’s philosophical orientation. As part of a larger European movement to reinvent drama, Ibsen and his fellow playwrights turned to the philosophy of their time. It should come as no surprise that this group took a special interest in modern philosophy of drama. Hand in hand with the institution of the modern theater, philosophy of drama developed in the work of philosophers such as Gotthold Ephraim Lessing and Johann Gottfried Herder, but found its mature form, in Ibsen’s own time, in the works of G. W. F. Hegel and Friedrich Nietzsche.\n\nFocusing on the work of Henrik Ibsen, I explore and actualize the relationship between philosophy and drama in the Nineteenth Century—not by suggesting that either philosophy or drama should have the upper hand, but by indicating how a sustained dialogue between them can bring out the best in both.\n\nIn-house seminar: Ibsen’s reception in China\n\nTime and place: Mar. 27, 2019 12:15 PM–1:30 PM, seminar room 6, PA Munchs hus, Blindern Campus, University of Oslo\n\nLiyang Xia.\n\nThe history of Ibsen’s reception in China goes back to the early twentieth century, when China looked to the West for models of modernization. During the time of China’s May Fourth Movement, or New Culture Movement (1910s-1920s), Chinese intellectuals who received Western education played important roles in introducing ideas such as Western science and democracy to the Chinese population. Many of these intellectuals were famous Ibsenites. Their understandings of how China should relate to the West did not always agree with each other. And yet the diversity of discourse on the relationship between Ibsen and Chinese modernization has been lost in both China’s official history and scholarly enquiries. Rather, Ibsen is presented as part of a unified effort to modernize China in the early part of the twentieth century. In Liyang’s lecture, she will talk about how the unity in the understanding and usage of Ibsen – at the time when he was first introduced to China – is an invention rather than a fact, while a more accurate understanding is far more complex.\n\nLiyang Xia has a PhD degree in Ibsen Studies from University of Oslo. Her current projects include remapping Ibsen’s early reception in China, re-translating all of Ibsen’s works into Chinese, and running theatre workshops on Ibsen’s plays.\n\nIn-house seminar: On the Spanish reception of A Doll's House (1890-2010s)\n\nIris Muñiz (University of Oslo).\n\nTime and place: Mar. 19, 2019 2:15 PM–4:00 PM, seminar room 3, PA Munchs hus, Blindern Campus, University of Oslo\n\nAbout \"A Doll’s House\"\n\n\"A Doll’s House\" is arguably Ibsen’s most popular play in the world – it is too, by far, his most popular play in the Hispanic world, both in terms of theatrical events and published translations.\n\nFirst published in Spanish in 1892, the play came to represent not only Ibsen as an author, but also the entire Nordic literature and the supposed Nordic national character, and, in parallel, it was often used as a symbol for the female emancipation movement. Stereotypical ideas about Nordic character and its relation to feminist movement, in contrast with the national image of Spanishness have accompanied almost every Spanish-language reception event ever since.\n\nAboute this lecture\n\nIn her lecture, Iris Muñiz will provide an overview of how the play was received throughout the last century, with an emphasis on (a) the translation history of the play; (b) the early Spanish-speaking film adaptations; (c) how Francoist anti-feminist ideology spurred theatrical adaptations; and (d) why María and Gregorio Martínez Sierra may be considered the most important mediators of the play in Spain.\n\nThis presentation builds on Muñiz’ dissertation \"A Doll’s House of their own\", defended last autumn in the University of Oslo, as well as on several of her published and unpublished articles about other aspects of the Spanish-speaking reception of Ibsen. While this presentation is fundamentally focused on Spain, it also includes some aspects of the Latin-American reception.\n\nIris Muñiz obtained her Ph.D. from the University of Oslo in November 2018. She is currently a guest researcher at the Centre for Ibsen Studies.\n\n2018\n\nEsotericism and the Humanities\n\nA joint workshop by IKOS and the Centre for Ibsen Studies at the University of Oslo\n\nTime and place: Dec. 13, 2018 12:00 PM–Dec. 14, 2018 2:30 PM, Room 389, PA Munchs hus\n\nAbstract\n\nWhat happens when a scholar in the humanities, be it literature, art, music, anthropology, history or religious studies finds esoteric elements in his/her object of research?\n\nWhich strategies and methodologies are advisable in order to study how esoteric currents relate to the exoteric world outside and how their specificity intersect with the research aims, scopes and traditions of other disciplines? This interdisciplinary workshop aims at gathering scholars within different research fields, who have been occupied with case studies that have touched upon the questions above.\n\nFollowing its infancy in the 1960s, in the last three decades the academic study of Western esotericism has flourished as an independent branch of religious studies. However, the methodological aspects of how this field of study intersects with other disciplines, have not yet been studied thoroughly.\n\nThis workshop aims to start a discussion in order to develop conceptual tools and methodological strategies both for scholars in the humanities who encounter Western esotericism in their research, and for scholars of Western esotericism interested in expanding their research scope. The workshop will be led by a literary scholar (Giuliano D’Amico) and a historian of religion (Cecilie Endresen) at the University of Oslo, and gathers scholars from Norway, Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Sweden.\n\nThe expertise and the affiliations of this group, ranging from Ibsen to Islamic Studies, from the Theory of Science to Popular Spiritism, from Film Studies to Art History, are chosen strategically. The workshop, in fact, is intended as a first step towards a future application for workshop grants from The Joint Committee for Nordic Research Councils for the Humanities and the Social Sciences (NOS-HS).\n\nProgram\n\nThursday 13 December (Room 389, PA Munchs hus, Blindern)\n\n12.00-13.00 LUNCH for the speakers\n\n13.00-13.15 Cecilie Endresen and Giuliano D’Amico (University of Oslo): Introduction\n\n13.15-14.00 Olav Hammer (University of Southern Denmark): “Esotericism and the literature of mysticism”\n\n14.00-14.45 Benedikt Hjartarson (University of Iceland): “Edifying Form: On the Literary Esotericism of Þórbergur Þórðarson”\n\n14.45-15.00 PAUSE\n\n15.00-15.45 Marja Lahelma (University of Helsinki): “Artists as producers and mediators of esoteric knowledge”\n\n15.45-16.30 Cecilie Endresen (University of Oslo): “Albanian esotericism, pseudo-linguistics and new religious authorities”\n\n18.30 DINNER for the speakers\n\nFriday 14 December (Room 389, PA Munchs hus, Blindern)\n\n9.00-9.45 Anne Kalvig (University of Stavanger): “Contemporary, spiritual stuff and how to label and study it as a part of culture”\n\n9.45-10.30 Henrik Johnsson (University of Tromsø): “Occult Fiction Considered as a Literary Genre”\n\n10.30-10.45 PAUSE\n\n10.45-11.30 Dirk Johannsen (University of Oslo): “The mystical breakthrough - Naturalism and occult explorations in Nordic literature 1871-1897”\n\n11.30-12.15 Kristoffer Noheden (University of Stockholm): \"Nature's Imagination: Surrealism, Esotericism, and Ecology.\"\n\n12.15-13.00 LUNCH for the speakers\n\n13.00-13.45 Giuliano D’Amico (University of Oslo): “The Fantasy of Peer Gynt: appropriation, overinterpretation, or...?”\n\n13.45-14.30 Discussion and further plans\n\nPractical information\n\nBlindern campus and PA Munchs hus are best reached by the Underground (T-Bane).

It has gained critical acclaim in feminist West African theatre for its treatment of issues in African feminism. The most noticeable departure of this adaptation from the source text is the ending where the protagonist makes a claim to motherhood. This departure from the original play provides an important view into African feminism.\n\nAnother major change is the use of Pidgin English, a blend of English and local West African languages which is spoken by characters added to the original narrative. The use of Pidgin English in West African theatre is not uncommon and its popularity has encouraged many studies. From the perspective of post-colonial theatre studies the use of Pidgin language in plays most often connotes a resistance to Standard English, generally considered a marker of colonial authority. In this presentation, instances of the use of Pidgin English in the adaptation and its added value are examined.\n\nSefakor Solace Anku is a PhD fellow at the Center for Ibsen studies.\n\nWelcome!\n\nGabriela Zapolska in Et Dukkehjem: Ibsen for everyone?\n\nThe Centre for Ibsen Studies welcomes you to a lecture by Ewa Partyga (Institute of Art, The Polish Academy of Sciences) on the significance of Gabriela Zapolska's performance as Nora for Polish theater towards the end of the 19th century.\n\nTime and place: Apr. 20, 2017 11:00 AM, Seminar room 114, Harriet Holters hus\n\nGabriela Zapolska deserves most of the credit given for the popularity of \"Et Dukkehjem\" among the Polish theatre audience in the last decades of the 19th century. She was performing Nora from 1882 until 1900, bringing Ibsen not only to Cracow and Lviv but also to small provincial Polish towns. Some critics claim her performance was secondary to the legendary first Polish Nora by Helena Modrzejewska who played the role in Poland only once (Warsaw, March 1882). However, the artistic criteria used as an argument in critical assessment cannot be separated from ideological notions. Zapolska chose a very different mode of expression in the public sphere from Modrzejewska.\n\nAs an interesting writer and playwright, controversial columnist, literary critic, and an actress; Zapolska was an original, independent, and bold thinker. In her public statements and literary works she provoked conservatives and supporters of women’s rights movements equally. Analysing her Nora performance provides an opportunity to discuss several intersecting problems: the relation between the perception of her public persona and the reception of her interpretation of Ibsen, the role of \"Et Dukkehjem\" in shaping her project of a more inclusive theatre, and finally the influence of Ibsen’s play on Zapolska’s elaborated approach to early feminism.\n\nGuest lecture: Ibsen in Cultural Exchange: Prospects and Potentialities\n\nGuest lecture by Professor Sabiha Huq from Khulna University, Bangladesh.\n\nTime and place: Feb. 27, 2017 10:15 AM–12:00 PM, Group room 7, 3rd floor Georg Sverdrup's House\n\nHenrik Ibsen has been one of the key figures in cultural exchange between the European countries. Most of his plays were staged in major European countries by the end of the nineteenth century. They conveyed sociopolitical messages which contributed in the European enlightenment and therefore had a global impacted as well. In this manner, Ibsen was always part of the soft power. Especially after the fall of the Eastern Block, Ibsen played a strong role as cultural ambassador of Northern Europe to the Subcontinent, influencing major sociopolitical change.\n\nSince the beginning of worldwide cultural diplomacy, several attempts to employ Ibsen as part of the soft power have been recorded. Projects such as Nora’s Sisters, Ibsen between Cultures, international Ibsen festivals, inter-university Ibsen research collaborations, translation projects and many more, have all contributed to global awareness regarding women’s emancipation, globalization, the rise of religious fundamentalism, and other crucial issues.\n\nAt present Ibsen functions as an emissary of change for the Islamic countries, South Asia, and Africa; while at the same time being part of a global cultural exchange between Europe and countries like USA, Australia, England, Germany. This lecture focuses on how Ibsen has gradually become part of the modern soft power and how his work may contribute to cultural relations in future years.\n\n2016\n\nConference: The Scandinavian Moment in World Literature\n\nIn the last decades of the nineteenth century Scandinavian literature emerged as a power to be reckoned with in European and world literature. How can we explain the rise of such a phenomenon from the periphery? How was the so-called \"Modern Breakthrough\" received abroad? And what were some of the effects of this wave of literature and drama?\n\nThe conference will sum up major results of the research project SCANMO, funded by The Norwegian Research Council. Invited speakers will present research on related topics and offer international perspectives on Scandinavia's \"Modern Breakthrough\".\n\nTime and place: Dec. 1, 2016 10:00 AM–Dec. 2, 2016 4:00 PM, University of Tromsø\n\nProgramme\n\nThursday 1 December (Faculty main building E 0.105)\n\n10:00 Opening.

Munchs hus: Seminarrom 3\n\nMiranda will explain her own take on Ibsen’s classic Et Dukkehjem (A Doll’s House, Casa de muñecas), what she has preserved and what has she changed on her adaptation of the script, and how she built her play on Spanish collective memory, women’s history and the world of radio that brought mass entertainment inside the dark cluttered sitting rooms of Franco’s time that were like jails for the Spanish women who were not allowed to work or have property of their own without their male tutor’s permission, passed on from their father’s into their husband’s hands. In the play Nora’s door-slamming is interpreted as a theatrical experience under the light of feminist theories from Virginia Woolf’s A room of one’s own (1929), and Carmen Martin Gaite’s Desde la ventana (1987).\n\nMiranda was inspired by her grandmother’s shocking separation in the late 1950s (divorce was not allowed in Spain until 1981), her childhood memory of her grannie explaining how she one day took one suitcase in one hand and her two children in another and decided to start a life of her own, facing bravely the Francoist catholic society’s prejudices. The play was built on her wondering “What if my grandmother was indeed Nora?\n\nHow many Noras were in Spain during the Francoist dictatorship?\n\nOpen for all.\n\nBook launch: A Global Doll's House. Ibsen and Distant Visions\n\nThis book addresses a deceptively simple question: what accounts for the global success of A Doll’s House, Henrik Ibsen’s most popular play?\n\nThis book launch is a part of the Ibsenfestival from 8th to 25th of September.\n\nTime and place: Sep. 21, 2016 5:30 PM–6:30 PM, Nationaltheatret Festivalbar\n\nUsing maps, networks, and images to explore the world history of the play’s production, this question is considered from two angles: cultural transmission and adaptation.\n\nAnalysing the play’s transmission reveals the social, economic, and political forces that have secured its place in the canon of world drama; a comparative study of the play’s 135-year production history across five continents offers new insights into theatrical adaptation. Key areas of research include the global tours of nineteenth-century actress-managers, Norway’s soft diplomacy in promoting gender equality, representations of the female performing body, and the sexual vectors of social change in theatre.\n\nProgramme\n\nLed by Professor Julie Holledge (Centre for Ibsen Studies, University of Oslo), this collaborative project brings together Ibsen specialists with scholars in digital humanities and theatre studies:\n\nDr Jonathan Bollen (University of New South Wales, Australia), Research Co-ordinator of AusStage, the Australian database for researching performance (2006-13);\n\nProfessor Frode Helland, (Director of the Centre for Ibsen Studies, University of Oslo, Norway), author of Ibsen in Practice (2015);\n\nProfessor Joanne Tompkins (University of Queensland, Australia), author of Theatre’s Heterotopias (2014), and co-author with Holledge of Women’s Intercultural Performance (2001), winner of the Rob Jordan Book Prize.\n\nFree entrance.\n\nIbsen, cholera, and the drama of science\n\nGuest lecture by Keith Oatley.

A long critical tradition—from James Huneker to Raymond Williams, Robert Brustein, James McFarlane, Michael Meyer—claims that Shaw’s anti-idealist argument turned Ibsen the artist into Ibsen the mere polemicist. Shaw’s mistake was to read the plays as the embodiment of a lesson, illustrations of a thesis, exercises in moral persuasion.\n\nIn her talk, drawn from her book in progress for Palgrave/Macmillan’s new “Shaw Series,” Prof. Templeton introduces the “other Shaw” of the Quintessence, the Shaw who has not been allowed to live because he has been buried under an overdetermined notion of Shaw as half sociologist/half preacher. One of Shaw’s great quarrels with the late Victorian theatre was its irrelevance to actual life, and of all the puerile ingredients that constitute this irrelevance, the “stock characters” or stick figures that passed for characters were particularly appalling. For Shaw, one of the great glories of Ibsen’s “new drama” was Ibsen’s complex portraits of what Shaw called “actual people in actual life”. The fact is that Shaw was one of the first writers in any language to appreciate and analyze Ibsen’s men and women based on close reading of the texts.\n\nTempleton examine some of these portraits, including John Rosmer, Rebecca West, and Hedda Gabler, to present a new writer of the Quintessence: Bernard Shaw as psychologist.\n\nThe Henrik Ibsen Lecture 2015 is given by Joan Templeton, Professor Emerita of Long Island University. Templeton is a major Ibsen scholar whose work is appreciated worldwide. She is the author of Ibsen’s Women, Munch’s Ibsen and over fifty articles on Ibsen and other dramatists, in PMLA, Modern Drama, Scandinavian Studies, and elsewhere, and the editor of Ibsen News and Comment. The past president of the International Ibsen Committee and the Ibsen Society of America, she has held research fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Fulbright program and the American-Scandinavian Foundation. She has taught at the Universities of Paris IV-Sorbonne, Tours and Limoges. Her current project is a book on Shaw and Ibsen for the Palgrave Macmillan Shaw series.\n\nThe lecture is open to all. We serve coffee, tea and light snacks.\n\nWelcome!\n\nPerception of characters in Ibsen’s When We Dead Awaken\n\nCan a close reading of Ibsen reveal the reasons of his characters' often incomprehensible and erratic behaviour?\n\nThe guest lecture is in English, and is open to all.\n\nTime and place: Oct. 5, 2015 12:30 PM, Seminar room 210, Henrik Wergelands hus\n\nMany of Ibsen’s plays leave the audience with mingled feelings and even with a sense of contradiction that can be traced back to the often seemingly incomprehensible and erratic behaviour of the characters.\n\nThe following lecture and workshop will primarily focus on \"When We Dead Awaken\" in the quest for an explanation of this fact. Ibsen’s latest play will be discussed in the context of the works by the author himself as well as in consideration of the views expressed by some of Ibsen’s contemporaries (e.g. M.J. Monrad, C. Petersen, O. Brahm, H. Bahr, H. v. Hofmannsthal).\n\nThe lecture is followed by a workshop consisting of close reading and discussion.\n\nThe guest lecture is held by Ph.D. fellow Pavel Knápek, University of Pardubice, Czech Republic.\n\nWe serve coffee, tea and light snacks.\n\nWelcome!\n\nIbsen’s Empty Nurseries: Freedom, Responsibility, and the Reproductive Metaphor\n\nWhy does Henrik Ibsen empty nurseries and then fill them up with books, a troll-princess, and urchins?\n\nThe guest lecture is open to all.\n\nTime and place: Sep. 16, 2015 10:00 AM, Seminar room 210, Henrik Wergelands hus\n\n\"… it is always important to take stock of where feminism is, even as that effort at reflection is necessarily marred … No one stands within a definition of feminism that would remain uncontested.\" – Judith Butler, “The Ends of Sexual Difference?” (2004, 174)\n\nIn \"The Lady from the Sea\", after the death of her son and a period of neurotic crisis, Ellida discovers (with the aid of her husband) freedom and responsibility. But Ellida’s breakthrough leads to Ibsen’s reprise: he now gets to work emptying and then filling nurseries with books, a troll-princess, and urchins.\n\nThis talk focuses on Ibsen’s interest in (pro)creativity, expressed by means of these nurseries and the reproductive metaphor in \"Hedda Gabler\", \"The Master Builder\", and \"Little Eyolf\". As my title and epigraph suggest, this discussion is part of a larger project in which I revisit the “woman question” in what is sometimes called the post-woman era, shifting focus from freedom and individualism to sexual difference and queerer matters.\n\nOlivia Noble Gunn received her MA in performance studies from New York University, her PhD in comparative literature from University of California Irvine.

The project has arranged three seminars, one at each university. The goal is to investigate different philosophical issues relevant to Ibsen's plays.\n\n2014\n\nIbsen for Critiquing the Gender Structure of South Asian Islamic Societies\n\nThe seminar is in English, and is open to all.\n\nTime and place: Dec. 4, 2014 1:15 PM, Seminar room 210, Henrik Wergeland's house, Blindern\n\nSouth Asia has been an important region in making significant new plays based on Ibsen in which gender has been spotted as an issue that deeply influenced the adaptations. These adaptations basically commented on traditional power structure existing in South Asian societies and stressed the necessity of women's emancipation.\n\nThere have been a number of plays adapted from the gender persperctive since the nineteen nineties and the present discussion covers one Pakistani and two Bangladeshi adaptations of \"A Doll's House\", \"Ghosts\" and \"Peer Gynt\" in which traditional and religious views are in conflict with the rising gender awareness.\n\n\"Gurriya Ka Ghar\" is an Urdu adaptation of \"A Doll's House\" by Tehrik-e-Niswan, a thetare that started its journey as an organization for securing women's rights. The play shows the decadence of the society which is based on corrupt and false Islamic values that help the society exploit women in the name of responsibilities.\n\n\"Krishnabibar\" is adapted from \"Ghosts\"; set against a progressive middle class Islamic society, it directly advocates women's education and strongly protests against the misinterpretation of Islam by some so-called religious leaders.\n\n\"Peer Gynt\", adapted as \"Peer Chan\", calls for women's freedom in remote and rural societies where education and women's empowerment are hardly attainable.\n\nThese plays display how Ibsen has become a tool for questioning the exploitative nature of the South Asian Islamic societies, which situation has recently attracted global attention because of the Nobel Peace Prize recipient Malala's campaign.\n\nSabiha Huq is Professor at Khulna University in Bangladesh. She has a doctoral degree in humanities from Centre for Ibsen Studies, UiO. She defended her doctoral thesis \"The Nation Speaks through the Global: Transformations of Peer Gynt in South Asia and in a Norwegian Valley\" in September this year.\n\nWe serve coffee/tea and biscuits.\n\nWelcome!\n\nSvanhild: Ibsen Meets Artaud in the 21st Century\n\nGrusomhetens teater uses physical acting techniques in their staging of Ibsen´s \"Svanhild\".\n\nThe In-House seminar is in English, and is open to all.\n\nTime and place: Oct. 23, 2014 1:15 PM, Seminar room 210, Henrik Wergeland's house\n\nIn 2009, director Lars Øyno staged the world premiere of Henrik Ibsen´s chamber opera, \"Fjeldfuglen\"; five years later, he directed a second world premiere of Ibsen´s, his unfinished drama \"Svanhild\". After originally appearing at his independent theatre group in Oslo, Grusomhetens Teater, the pieces have also participated in the International Ibsen Festival, as well as toured internationally.\n\nØyno will discuss how he came to direct the premieres of these two plays of Ibsen´s from 1859, with particular emphasis on \"Svanhild\" in 2014. He will also discuss some of the unique theatrical elements and physical acting techniques distinct to his artistic vision with Grusomhetens Teater, a group working since 1992 in the tradition of Antonin Artaud and his \"theatre of cruelty\".\n\nØyno is a professional actor and director, as well as the Artistic Director of Grusomhetens Teater in Oslo, which he founded in 1992.\n\nWe serve coffee, tea and light snacks.\n\nWelcome!\n\nHow to Become a World Dramatist – Ibsen’s International Breakthrough\n\nIbsen’s road to success was a series of breakthroughs, with \"The Feast at Solhaug\" in Norway, with \"Brand\" in the Nordic countries, with \"Pillars of Society\" on the European continent (through Germany and Austria), with \"A Doll’s House\" globally (through England).\n\nTime and place: Oct. 10, 2014 1:15 PM, Seminar room 210, Henrik Wergeland's house\n\nThe Ibsen Centre welcomes you to an In-House seminar to learn about the sub-surface details of Ibsen’s road to success.\n\nThe seminar is in English, and is open to all.\n\nWelcome!\n\nProgram\n\nStåle Dingstad, The Smiling Power\n\nRecently, the newspaper Verdens Gang elected Henrik Ibsen to be the most important Norweg"
