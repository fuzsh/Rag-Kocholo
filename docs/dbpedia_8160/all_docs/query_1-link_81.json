This became a preoccupation of mine from age 13 onwards. Ever since then, writing has given me a means of coming to terms with the inevitability of death.\n\nORP: How has your writing or art changed over time?\n\nRRG: Producing the first draft has always been exciting for me, but there is a particular pleasure that comes from being able to revise older work. I have been spending a lot of time lately revising things that I wrote decades ago, and discovering new things about myself in the process.\n\nORP: Name three artists or writers have impacted your work.\n\nRRG: Most recently: Kafka, Richard Yates, and Robert Duncan, each for very different reasons.\n\nORP: Who do you hope reads your work and why?\n\nRRG: I think I am more interested in duration over time than in reach over space. I would like to be read by someone a long time in the future. Even if it is just one person, that is fine.\n\nORP: What’s next for you artistically?"
