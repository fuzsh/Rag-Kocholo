        "text": "part I\n\n“Sometimes I Feel Like A Motherless Child” is a Negro spiritual written in the late nineteenth century that echoes the slavish existence of African-Americans during those times. Pier Paolo Pasolini used this melody in his film, “The Gospel According to St. Matthew”, in a scene which pictures shepherds coming to see infant Christ. In the very next clip, Joseph, Mary, and little Jesus have to leave their native Bethlehem, due to dangers young messiah might face.\n\nI think it is an interesting parallel, especially in terms of the musical effect.\n\nParallels can be found anywhere, even in different, opposing mediums, because we, as a global society, are always connected through the chain of events, be it one way, or another.\n\nMetaphysical loneliness of being is a recurring theme in the work of Vazha-Pshavela, one such example being his iconic poem, “Populus”, that discusses the unfortunate fate of an anthropomorphic violet:\n\nPopulus\n\nOh, how pitiful is the violet,\n\nThat came to be on mountains!\n\nWretched, always harmed by cold,\n\nOr stricken by lightning, on its top;\n\nGod gave the pitiful,\n\nA short lifespan,\n\nIn this realm, for its loveliness,\n\nA mere second of existence, is the plan,\n\nWhen violet starts to wilt,\n\n“Oh!” to god, it will weep:\n\n“Why was I given life, O’Lord,\n\nIf a short stay, was my reward?”\n\nPopulus, like a “motherless child”, also happens to be a slave of a cruel fate, doomed to suffer and die alone…\n\nFrom Negro spirituals to modern hip-hop, African-American music has been a steady guide to understanding the complex and tragic history of those brave people, but in terms of influence on popular culture, jazz music definetly takes the lead: emerging from the brothels of New Orleans, the saying goes that if you play something in a spur of a moment, then it’s most definetly jazz! But the main question of this essay is, does it have anything to do with Georgian culture? It does and i already mentioned the answer above: the spur of a moment. If you think about it, the craddle of our country lies in words born from the spur of a moment that we call spoken folk poetry: Tush kaphya, for example, which is also popular in other mountainous regions of Georgia.\n\nKaphya (Arabic:Rhyme) is a poetic genre of Georgian oral tradition, a satirical-humorous poem, which is created through verse competitions (much like a rap battle). Questions and answers are obtained through poems, both by someone else and by one’s own poems. In Pshav-Khevsureti, Kaphya is also known as the poem of self, in fact, the practice was so well-known in the region of Pshavi, that Vazha himself wrote one:\n\nKaphya\n\n(dedicated to Shio of the Cave)\n\nReceive this small offering\n\nFrom your brother,-\n\nMy heart aches as well,\n\nI know the feeling of being oppressed by the enemy all too well,\n\nTeach children by using their means,\n\nThose tunes, that are close to the heart,\n\nThe love for nature and greens,\n\nAnd our ancestor’s way of war.\n\nKeeper of secrets for our daughters and sons,\n\nYou slog silently in your cave,\n\nThe fortune and misfortune of the little ones,\n\nOn your heart feels like an ulcer, engraved.\n\nWho knows, when will the time come again,\n\nFor me to approve, the words that are spoken raw by men,\n\nSo, I am sending you my regards,\n\nAs well as brotherly hugs!\n\nTo understand the poem, it is important to know who Shio of the Cave was:\n\nAn ecclesiastical figure, one of the Assyrian fathers, founder of Shiomghvimi Monastery Complex, devoted believer and a hermit, who is famously know for living in an isolated cave, hence his moniker, “Shio of the Cave”, is one of the most important people in Georgian history.\n\nThe “poem of self” that Vazha created is a dialogue, a “Kaphyan duel” with the honorable past of Georgia, with Shio of the Cave as the symbol, as author’s homeland has become a shell of its former self during his time… Isn’t jazz the same? Music that defies times and space, connects performers of all time periods and always rejoices in the spur of the moment, just like Kaphyan duels…\n\nRelated Post\n\nCosmopolitan patriotism during the crisis\n\n“Patriotism, just like life and the connections with it, is present within one when they are born into this world; it contains pieces within itself that a no sane human can deny and those so-called pieces show themselves in mother language, historical past, historical territories, in the faces of famous figures, literature and so on. […]\n\nWhat created me as a human being?\n\nWhat created me as a human being? Why did I not come as rain? I could have been forever On clouds core and chest, as bead and chain, Always ready to fall on the ground, As a cold or snowy little grain, My elder would never sacrifice me, In such a dreadful manner, as is […]\n\nKaphya\n\n(dedicated to Shio of the Cave) Receive this small offering From your brother,- My heart aches as well, I know the feeling of being oppressed by the enemy all too well, Teach children by using their means, Those tunes, that are close to the heart, The love for nature and greens, And our ancestor’s way […]\n\nFor Girlie\n\nGirlie, the most I love about you, Is how you channel a fox: You never dare to stare, Yet the boys you always mock. From time to time, you smile, Slowly, in your heart, emotions you pile: While Swinging a swordless sword, You cut the heart cords. On my heart still shows, The way you […]\n\nThe eagle\n\nI saw an eagle, who was wounded, He was at war with ravens and spades, Injured, he struggled to get up, But could not, he had no aid… One wing on the ground he carries, With blood on his chest, Oh, watch out spades, be wary! You had me at my worst, If not, I […]\n\nMy Grandfather’s Will\n\nChild, why do you cry, What misfortune has come by? Enduring while in distress, Has always been the rule of a man! A crying man is not a good fit, Weeping like a woman, is just not it, You must scare the enemy with your sword, His footsteps you must follow, like a wolf, Your […]"
