        "text": "In the period after Stalin's death and the breakdown of the monolithic dogma of Socialist realism, the most exciting cultural practices were associated with three cults: the cults of youth, individualism and westernness. In the following period of Stagnation (zastoi) and Brezhnev's less liberal political doctrine, the process of cultural disintegration was even intensified. Avtorskaia pesnia (literally “author’s song”) responded ideally to the zeitgeist. It was not only close to individualism, youth culture and student population, but also to the process of cultural disintegration. Avtorskaia pesnia is sometimes called the poetry of wild youth. Emerging as a temporary autonomous zone (cf. Hakim Bey), as part of the so-called apartment culture or the institution of communal art, it is related to the phenomenon of magnitizdat. It directly influenced the development of Russian rock music - it is argued that this is one of the reasons why text dominates over music in Russian rock - and poetry in general. In the period of late Soviet socialism it was probably the most attractive and the most widespread form of cultural production and consumption. In this paper, I will analyze avtorskaia pesnia as a deterritorializing milieu (A. Yurchak) par excellence. In order to address the question of whether Soviet culture was homogeneous or heterogeneous during the Brezhnev era, I will also do a close reading of the poetry of two prominent Russian bards, B. Okudzhava and V. Vysotskii, paying special attention to one of the most authoritative Soviet cultural myths and ideologems, that of “motherland” (rodina).\n\nThis thesis regards history of Georgian Inner Kartlia (Shida Kartli) region and course of Georgian-Ossetian relationship over the centuries. Historical affiliation of so-called South Ossetia, as a region detached from among others Shida Kartli, is one of the work topics. Determining the affiliation and historical identity of this region is the main goal of work, and the substantive basis is to confront Georgian and Ossetian sources. The work also describes the general history of the region, including the influence of neighboring countries on the Caucasus and the nations living in it. Describing the course of inter-ethnic relations allowed to draw conclusions why Ossetian separatism emerged in the 1920s. The answer to this question is in the growing Georgian-Ossetian antagonisms and the influence of the Bolsheviks on some national minorities in Georgia. The analysis of historical events and the ethnic conditions of the Caucasus allowed to determine the genesis of Ossetian separatism, which influenced further events of the 1990s. In order to examine the nature of the relationship between Georgians and the Ossetians, historical maps were used, which determine the ethno-territorial range of Caucasian nations, as well as some testimonies of contemporary researchers, mainly Johann Anton Güldenstädt. The analysis of the studies of Caucasian researchers dealing with the above problem, as well as primary sources, was necessary to achieve goals of work.\n\nIn Georgia, the fables of Panchatantra are well-known through the book of Kalila and Dimna. However, some rare examples of direct parallels with the fables of Panchatantra appeared in Georgian literary sources and folk oral narratives. Next to the brief history of Panchatantras’s journey through centuries, and an overview of Georgian historical chronicles Kartlis Tskhovreba (The Life of Kartli), A Book of Wisdom and Lies by Sulkhan-Saba Orbeliani, and Georgian folktales outline the transformations of some fables from Panchatantra in Georgia. The paper examines the role of animals in the fables in general, and shows the ways of interpretations on the example of the theme of ingratitude in context of European and Oriental narrative traditions."
