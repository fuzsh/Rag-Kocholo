Adam Kotsko teaches in the Shimer Great Books School at North Central College, where he teaches widely in the humanities and social sciences. He grew up in Davison, Michigan, and completed his undergraduate degree at Olivet Nazarene University (2002), where he majored in English. He completed his Master of Arts in Religion (2005) and PhD in Theology, Ethics, and Culture (2009) at the Chicago Theological Seminary. Prior to joining the faculty of North Central College, he also taught at Kalamazoo College and Shimer College.

Adam’s research focuses on political theology, continental philosophy, and the history of Christian thought. He is the author, most recently, of The Prince of This World, a study of the political legacy of pre-modern Christian ideas about the devil, and Neoliberalism’s Demons, which argues that the contemporary political-economic order functions on the basis of a logic of moral entrapment that echoes the theological concept of demonization. A good overview of his work can be found in this recent interview.
