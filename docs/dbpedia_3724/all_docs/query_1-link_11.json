        "text": "Olivet Nazarene University (ONU) is a Christian liberal arts university located in the village of Bourbonnais, Illinois, United States. Named for Olivet, Illinois, ONU was originally established as a grammar school in east-central Illinois in 1907. It is affiliated with the Church of the Nazarene and is the annual site of the Church's \"Regional Celebrate Life\" youth gathering for the Central USA Region. It is one of the largest members of the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities.\n\nHistory\n\nPresidents A.M. Hills 1909–1910 Ezra Franklin 1910 - Feb. 1912 J.E. Hoover Feb. - Jun. 1912 E.F. Walker Jun. 1912-1913 E.P. Ellyson 1913–1914 John H. Norris Jun. - Nov. 1914 E.P. Ellyson Nov. 1914 - Mar. 1915 A.L. Whitcomb Mar. - Sep. 1915 E.F. Walker 1915–1916 Benjamin Franklin Haynes 1916–1917 J.E. Hoover 1917–1918 M.E. Borders Mar. - Sep. 1918 C.L. Hawkins 1918–1919 J.W. Akers Jan. - ? 1919 J.E.L. Moore 1919–1922 Newport W. Sanford 1922–1926 T.W. Willingham 1926–1938 A.L. Parrott, Sr. 1938–1948 Selden Dee Kelley 1948–1949 Harold W. Reed 1949–1975 A. Leslie Parrott, Jr. 1975–1991 John C. Bowling 1991–present\n\nOlivet Nazarene University traces its roots to 1907, when the Eastern Illinois Holiness Association started Miss Mary Nesbitt's grammar school in a house in Georgetown, Illinois. In 1908, the school's founders acquired 14 acres in the village of Olivet, and moved the grammar school to the proposed campus. A Wesleyan–holiness community sprang up around the school.\n\nIn 1909, the liberal arts college was chartered and named Illinois Holiness University, with A. M. Hills from Texas Holiness University as its first president. It was then given to the Church of the Nazarene in 1912, with E. F. Walker as president, and inherited one of the most populated Nazarene regions in the United States. It was renamed Olivet University in 1915, and again in 1921 to Olivet College.\n\nThe economic solvency of the school became a problem in the 1920s, and the trustees were forced to declare bankruptcy in 1926. The school's treasurer, T. W. Willingham, purchased the school back at an auction and was elected president. In 1939, the main building on campus was destroyed by fire. This prompted the school to look for a new location. Under President A.L. Parrott, the school moved in 1940, onto the previous 42-acre (170,000 m) campus of St. Viator's College. With the move, the school's name was changed to Olivet Nazarene College (ONC). The school's name was changed again in 1986 to Olivet Nazarene University (ONU).\n\nThe past twenty years have been marked by a massive change in the culture and image of Olivet. Following the appointment of John C. Bowling as University president, the university began appealing to a more diverse set of students from different Christian denominations. The school began several different construction projects to mark the growth of the school as a whole. The university has also recently subdivided itself into one college and four schools: the College of Arts and Sciences, School of Education, School of Professional Studies, School of Theology and Christian Ministry, and the School of Graduate and Continuing Studies.\n\nCampus\n\nONU's campus is 250 acres (1.0 km) in the village of Bourbonnais, Illinois, outside the city of Kankakee, Illinois, with 30 buildings. Four buildings are original from St. Viator College, including Burke Administration, Chapman Hall, Miller Business Center, and Birchard Gymnasium. There are also satellite campuses for adult education in Rolling Meadows, Illinois and Hong Kong.\n\nCampus Features\n\nSince Olivet Nazarene University relocated to Bourbonnais, the campus has undergone several different waves of construction. In addition, within the past two years, there have been numerous construction projects including the construction of the Betty and Kenneth Hawkins Centennial Chapel, the largest theater in Kankakee County, which seats approximately 3,059 people, and the Student Life and Recreation Center, which opened in December 2012.\n\nIn total, there are seven academic buildings (Burke, Wisner, Weber, Reed, Larsen, Forton Villa, and Leslie Parrott), two gymnasiums (Birchard and McHie), and six residence halls (Chapman, Hills, Nesbitt, Parrott, McClain, and Williams). The university also has several off-campus apartment buildings (Old Oak, Oak Run, University Place, Grand, Stadium, and Bresee). Centennial Chapel has showcased many Christian artists including Bill Gaither and Chris Tomlin.\n\nThe university has also completed their student life and recreation center which was opened on December 12, 2012. This building serves as central hub for the campus and features various things like an Olympic-sized pool, jacuzzi, lazy river, resistance pool, indoor track, the tallest collegiate rock climbing wall in North America, various classrooms, offices, a fitness center, game room and coffee shop.\n\nOrganization\n\nONU is one of nine regional U.S. liberal arts colleges affiliated with the Church of the Nazarene. ONU is the college for the \"Central USA Region\" of the United States. In terms of the Church of the Nazarene, the \"Central Region\" comprises the Wisconsin, Northwestern Illinois, Illinois, Chicago Central, Northern Michigan, Michigan, Eastern Michigan, Northwest Indiana, Northeastern Indiana, Indianapolis, and Southwest Indiana districts, which include Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, and Indiana. Each college receives financial backing from the Nazarene churches on its region; part of each church budget is paid into a fund for its regional school. Each college or university is also bound by a gentlemen's agreement not to actively recruit outside its respective \"educational region.\"\n\nAcademics\n\nONU has been accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools since 1956 and offers bachelor's degrees in 67 academic majors. The School of Graduate and Continuing Studies offers master's degrees, nontraditional adult degree-completion programs, and a doctor of education degree only offered at Rolling Meadows as well as a master of \"professional counseling\" degree offered at a site in Hong Kong and distance education for a master in education degree. The 2007 acceptance rate for students who applied to the college was 70.3 percent.\n\nStudent life\n\nThere were 4,636 students at the college in 2007, 3,190 of whom were undergraduates. ONU students are from 40 states and 20 countries, and represent 30 Christian denominations. The university offers over 80 different clubs with many different focuses. All of the clubs and student organizations are sponsored by the Olivet Nazarene University Associated Student Council. Some of the most influential clubs on campus include Capitol Hill Gang, the university's political society, and the campus chapter of the International Justice Mission.\n\nThe school also supports two club sports teams which are loosely affiliated with the university. This first of these is the ONU Men's Volleyball team which was the first sports club to be established. In addition, in 2010, the Black Penguins, a club Ultimate Frisbee team was created and reached the UPA's College Nationals, reaching that level again in 2014.\n\nAthletics\n\nOlivet Nazarene athletic teams are known as the Tigers; the university is member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) and compete as a member of Chicagoland Collegiate Athletic Conference (CCAC). ONU also competes in the North Central Region of the National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA). Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cheerleading, cross country, football, golf, soccer, swimming, tennis and track & field; while women's sports include basketball, cheerleading, cross country, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track & field and volleyball.\n\nThe purple and gold colors and the athletic nickname at Olivet Nazarene have existed since 1940, when ONC students first played Bethany Nazarene College (BNC), and intervarsity athletics began with another game between ONC and BNC in 1966.\n\nSince 2002, the Chicago Bears have held their summer training camp at the school, which will continue through 2022. ONU was originally affiliated with the Division III Northern Illinois-Iowa Conference of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) from 1974 to 1997, ONU became a charter member of the Mid-States Football Association in 1994 (football-only).\n\nNotable alumni\n\nJared \"Slim\" Smith (Freshmen year only), Prolific gamer (Particularly Rock Band), engineer for Commomwealth Edison, partially responsible for keeping the North American power grid online.\n\nKendall Blanchard, President of Georgia Southwestern State University.\n\nJohn C. Bowling, President of Olivet Nazarene University.\n\nPaul Cunningham, former General Superintendent of the Church of the Nazarene.\n\nJames Diehl, former General Superintendent of the Church of the Nazarene.\n\nR. Wayne Gardner, notable Nazarene minister and president emeritus of Eastern Nazarene College.\n\nAdam Kotsko, author, translator and professor of humanities at Shimer College.\n\nMike Overy, former baseball player for the California Angels.\n\nLes Parrott, a professor of clinical psychology for Seattle Pacific University, author, and motivational speaker.\n\nKelli Reisen, Christian musician, associated with John Elefante.\n\nBen Zobrist, baseball player for the Tampa Bay Rays.\n\nHomosexuality\n\nAccording to the 2009-2013 Manual of the Church of the Nazarene: \"Homosexuality is one means by which human sexuality is perverted. We recognize the depth of the perversion that leads to homosexual acts but affirm the biblical position that such acts are sinful and subject to the wrath of God. We believe the grace of God sufficient to overcome the practice of homosexuality (1 Corinthians 6:9-11). We deplore any action or statement that would seem to imply compatibility between Christian morality and the practice of homosexuality. We urge clear preaching and teaching concerning Bible standards of sexual morality.\"\n\nWoody Webb, VP for Student Development, stated: “We want to talk about this issue with students, and we want them to feel safe doing so. If they come to us and want help understanding their same sex attractions, our offices are open. While we won’t help a student accept [his or her] same sex attraction and enter a gay lifestyle, if they realize that their same sex attraction is contrary to God’s will for them, we will walk with them on their journey.” If a student is attempting to overcome homosexual tendencies, the University will accept them into counseling services. The only way that ONU will not accept a student into the counseling program is if the purpose of the counseling is directly related to accepting their homosexuality. In addition, if this is the case, Olivet will refer the student to an outside counseling agency."
