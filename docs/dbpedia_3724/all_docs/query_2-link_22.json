        "text": "Read\n\nOctober 3, 2018\n\nWhite male hegemony may turn out to be finite, but white male creepiness is eternal.\n\nUnfortunately this slim but entertaining book doesn't meet this lofty tagline. While there is an introductory Freudian reading of the concept of creepiness, Kotsko feels it might be a modern English translation of Unheimlich as opposed to the standard Uncanny. Soon after the introduction this phenomenon is explored through cinematic and TV examples. I have a cursory knowledge of most of the examples cited but felt this an inchoate or simply flawed pursuit.\n\nThis book belongs to a trilogy of works where the author confronts Awkwardness, our riveting interest in sociopaths and now this. Is there a solution? The author advises white straight males to move out of the spotlight.\n\nAs if.\n\nIt is intriguing that he wrote this book during the Obama years when Secretary Clinton was certainly going to be next president. Who could have anticipated the backlash -- first to the election of DJT but then the climate change which is #MeToo? The final event/movement made the discussion of the show Louis more than a little unsettling. Kotsko looks forward to a future of hysteria but only as an illumination.\n\nAs I age I find myself present in the world and do as little as possible to present myself as creepy. I harbor doubts about the effectiveness of such. A friend asked me yesterday if I was too preoccupied with The Holocaust. I wasn't sure and asked around: my friend Tim said, that for a gentile, perhaps--but he gave me a pass since \"I was woke.\"\n\nApril 16, 2017\n\nEntertaining pop-culture criticism of a type I love, and haven't yet had enough of: deadly serious writing about topics not typically regarded as 'serious', in this case mainly TV shows and cartoons. In this book – the last in a loose trilogy, the other entries being Awkwardness and Why We Love Sociopaths – Kotsko uses a Freudian framework to examine four categories of 'creepy' characters: the pervert, the psychotic, the obsessive, and the hysteric. He argues that the modern usage of 'creepy' is, in fact, a more accurate translation of Freud's 'unheimlich' than the more commonly used 'uncanny': creepiness is creepy precisely because of its proximity to the familiar and pleasant, and because creeps either believe they are behaving normally, or try too hard to cover up their inherent creepiness. The examples used are familiar cultural touchstones (plenty of shows I haven't watched, but none I haven't heard of); the style is smart but readable. Interesting, illuminating writing about an intriguing subject.\n\n(You can read the introduction to Creepiness at The New Inquiry. This piece is what originally made me want to read the book, more than two years ago – although I don't know what it says about me that I always found those adverts absolutely hilarious, and it never really occurred to me to think of them as creepy.)\n\nTinyLetter | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr\n\nMay 15, 2017\n\nA survey of recent pop culture tv, film and advertising using Freud's pathologies (psychosis/perversion/obsession/hysteria) as a guide. I did kind of like the idea that much of pop culture is stale because it overly relies on the obsession/perversion pathologies, and that the way forward is to develop dramas/characters that lean more psychotic (ie recoiling from reality to build self-contained worlds), or preferably hysteric (as it's a more total rejection of the social order).\n\nOctober 5, 2019\n\nA somewhat unsatisfying conclusion to the trilogy that leans on the 4 Freudian diagnostic categories to organise its account of creepy media. The theoretical conclusion (hysteria is good, actually) is true enough, if unsurprising, but the book really shines in its concrete analysis of manic pixie dream girls and the like.\n\nNovember 22, 2020\n\nThis book begins with an analysis of an advertisement created by the marketing people at Burger King. Creepiness is an attempt to keep a foothold on existence when you have no mandate to exist.\n\nOctober 19, 2022\n\nHonestly I think it’s creepy that he focuses on what’s creepy.\n\nJune 21, 2015\n\nI liked the dwelling into Burger king's King, that I never understood as a meme.\n\nI didn't expect that the book would point out creepiness as a trait of white masculinity. But then the (tv) examples range in gender and race? Do they still count as the product of (possibly) white male tv writers? So I guess it's something else as the definition of someone who doesn't respect boundaries. Anyway, I liked how it mentioned Nice guys and coupled them with Manic Pixie dream girls. Even taught me about Manix pixie men, and the analysis of Louie's 4th season with Louis CK as the ultimate pervert was definitely new for me. The books ends by suggesting hysteria and self-acceptance as a viable way of coping.\n\nThis is a lot about cinema and TV, and I'm glad I've seen most of the works he mentioned, but the book can be spoilery for others (underlined the ones discussed deeply): Breaking bad, Mad men, Girls, True blood, Full house, Family matters, The Sopranos, House of cards, Dexter, Orange is the new black, Peep show, Louie; and movies like Her, Eternal sunshine of a spotless mind, Spring breakers, The royal Tenembaums, Moonrise kingdom.\n\nApril 3, 2015\n\nAs an extension of 《Awkwardness》i was hoping Kotsko would be going in a similar direction; unfortunately he fell into the language of that great failed scientist Freud and Frued's act of trying to explain away unheimlich as well as many other ambigious emotions and moods and expressions of human being. I was deeply disturbed by Kotsko's classifying of the creep and the awkward individual as both neurotic individuals and then trying to take a clinical term in Frued to say we are all a little neurotic. Also very clearly written, Kotsko also provides some interesting interpretation of tv characters."
