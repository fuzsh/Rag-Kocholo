As of 2013, he is an assistant professor of humanities at Shimer College in Chicago. He is especially known for his interpretative work on Slavoj Žižek and Giorgio Agamben, as well as his writing on American popular culture.\n\nKotsko's better-known works include Why We Love Sociopaths (2012), Awkwardness (2010), and Žižek and Theology (2008). He has published three translations of works by Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben.\n\nKotsko is also known for his blogging, now in its second decade. He posts chiefly on a group blog titled An und für sich, but continues to maintain his original blog, titled simply The Weblog.[1] Prior to the rise of blogging, he had maintained a blog-like website titled The Homepage.[1]\n\nEarly life and education[]\n\nAdam Kotsko was born in Flint, Michigan, and grew up in nearby Davison, a trajectory he shares with filmmaker Michael Moore.[2][3] He has credited his school experiences in Davison with giving him a love of literature.[2]\n\nKotsko earned his BA at Olivet Nazarene University in Bourbonnais, Illinois in 2002.[4][2] From there, he went on to the Chicago Theological Seminary, where he completed an MA in religious studies in 2005, with a thesis in the form of a translation and commentary on Jacques Derrida's essay \"Literature in Secret: An Impossible Filiation\".[5] He completed his Ph.D. in theology, ethics, and culture at CTS in 2009.[4] His doctoral dissertation was titled Atonement and Ontology,[6] and argued that an understanding of atonement theory requires a social-relational ontology.[7]\n\nIntellectual and teaching career[]\n\nSoon after completing his doctorate in 2009, Kotsko began teaching at Kalamazoo College, a liberal arts college in Michigan.[9] Initially a one-year appointment, it was subsequently extended to two.[10]\n\nIn 2011, Kotsko was hired by Shimer College, a very small Great Books college in Chicago. He was one of three new Shimer professors hired that year, the school's largest intake of new faculty in more than a decade.[11] In his first year, he participated in a major reworking of the school's upper-level core Humanities courses. He has also served on numerous committees in Shimer's unusual self-governance body, the Shimer College Assembly; in April 2013 he was additionally elected parliamentarian of the Assembly.[9]\n\nKotsko is known for his writings on the interpretation of the philosopher Slavoj Žižek, whom he has credited for causing him to \"break out of one particular intellectual ghetto and into another\" by changing his self-identification from \"non-Republican\" to leftist.[2] His first published book was on Slavoj Žižek, titled Žižek and Theology, the first volume of T&T Clark's \"Philosophy and Theology\" series.[12] In a somewhat unusual circumstance for academic writers, it was published in 2008, before he had completed his dissertation.[1] In 2012, Kotsko published a more popular article on \"How to Read Žižek\" in the Los Angeles Review of Books,[13] which was republished in Italian by Internazionale.[14]\n\nKotsko has also published three book-length translations of works by Italian theologian Giorgio Agamben. He has also published and delivered a number of papers on Agamben. He has argued that Agamben's Highest Poverty, his translation of which was published in 2013, is \"ultimately about confronting neoliberalism.\"[15]\n\nKotsko has published two short books on popular culture, Awkwardness: An Essay (2010) and Why We Love Sociopaths: A Guide to Late Capitalist Television (2012). Each book draws out a specific theme found in contemporary American TV shows; Awkwardness addressing the curious rise of \"awkward humor\" in the 21st century and Why We Love Sociopaths addressing the trend toward a certain type of deeply antisocial protagonist. Both books were greeted with general acclaim, with the Oxonian Review declaring that \"Awkwardness is just what a work of philosophy should be\",[17] and Scott Berkun describing Why We Love Sociopaths as \"a second cousin to Postman’s classic Amusing Ourselves to Death.\"[18] Why We Love Sociopaths, however, also drew criticism for its admittedly[19] non-technical use of the term sociopathy.\n\nThe success of Awkwardness has led to Kotsko being cited as an authority on awkwardness in the press, including by US News and World Report.[20]\n\nAs of 2013, Kotsko reported himself to be working on a project on the Devil, as a follow-up to his 2010 work on redemption.[21] He has previously presented a paper before the American Academy of Religion on the ways that thinking of the Devil are informed by Agamben's writing.[22]\n\nBooks[]\n\nŽižek and Theology (2008).
