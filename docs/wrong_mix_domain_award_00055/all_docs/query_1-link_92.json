        "text": "What’s important about her scientific work?\n\nInspired by the discovery of radioactivity by Henri Becquerel in 1896, alongside her husband, Pierre Curie, Marie discovered radium and polonium and developed important theories on radioactivity. She developed the first treatments for cancer, and also developed portable x-ray machines.\n\nWhat do we know about her childhood?\n\nMarie’s family lost all their property and fortunes so her family was poor but her father made sure she was well educated. She won a gold medal whilst at school, and kept it in her drawer, like treasure to remind her what she could achieve. As a girl, she wasn’t allowed to attend university with her brother, and moved to Paris, France.\n\nWhat struggles did she face?"
