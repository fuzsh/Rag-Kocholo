        "meta_description": "“On 27 November 1895, Alfred Nobel signed his last will and testament, giving the largest share of his fortune to a series of prizes in Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Literature and Peace – the Nobel Prizes. In 1968, Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden’s central bank) established The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel.” (quoted from Nobelprize.org) On 10 December 2018 this year’s main award ceremonies take place in Stockholm and Oslo, adding the latest laureates to the list. The distribution of prizes is not only unbalanced from a geographical but also a gender perspective: 62 women vs. 1013 men in 118 years of the Nobel prizes. Marie Curie was the first women to be awarded a Nobel prize, in Physic, jointly with her husband Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel for the discovery of Radium. In 1911 she was awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Only 18 awards were given to female scientists in the categories Physics, Medicine and Chemistry, the others were awarded for achievements in the field of Literature or the fight for Peace.

        "text": "Technical Notes\n\nThis map shows each country proportional to the numbers of all female laureates in all Nobel categories won by citizens from there between 1901 and 2018.\n\nData sources\n\nThis map uses data by The Nobel Institute (last accessed December 2018). We aim to map as complete data as possible and therefore estimate data for missing values. In some cases, missing data for very small territories is not used in the cartogram and that area is therefore omitted in the map.\n\nFurther notes on the data, as well as all modifications to the original data source are noted in our data sheets.\n\nDownload data file"
