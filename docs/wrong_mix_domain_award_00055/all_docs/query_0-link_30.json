        "text": "On 27 November 1895, Alfred Nobel signed his last will and testament, giving the largest share of his fortune to a series of prizes in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and peace – the Nobel Prizes. In 1968, Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden’s central bank) established The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. Learn more about the Nobel Prize laureates here.\n\n621 Nobel Prizes\n\nIn the statutes of the Nobel Foundation it says: “A prize amount may be equally divided between two works, each of which is considered to merit a prize. If a work that is being rewarded has been produced by two or three persons, the prize shall be awarded to them jointly. In no case may a prize amount be divided between more than three persons.”\n\nAll Nobel Prize laureates\n\nBetween 1901 and 2023, the Nobel Prizes and the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel were awarded 621 times to 1000 people and organisations. With some receiving the Nobel Prize more than once, this makes a total of 965 individuals and 27 organisations. See Multiple Nobel Prize laureates.\n\nList of all Nobel Prize laureates\n\nList of Nobel Prize awarded organisations\n\nLists of all Nobel Prize laureates in\n\n| Physics | Chemistry | Physiology or medicine | Literature | Peace | Economic sciences |\n\nYears without Nobel Prizes\n\nSince the start, in 1901, there are some years when the Nobel Prizes have not been awarded. The total number of times are 49. Most of them during World War I (1914-1918) and II (1939-1945). In the statutes of the Nobel Foundation it says: “If none of the works under consideration is found to be of the importance indicated in the first paragraph, the prize money shall be reserved until the following year. If, even then, the prize cannot be awarded, the amount shall be added to the Foundation’s restricted funds.”.\n\nPhysics: 1916, 1931, 1934, 1940, 1941, 1942\n\nChemistry: 1916, 1917, 1919, 1924, 1933, 1940, 1941, 1942\n\nPhysiology or medicine: 1915, 1916, 1917, 1918, 1921, 1925, 1940, 1941, 1942\n\nLiterature: 1914, 1918, 1935, 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943\n\nPeace: 1914, 1915, 1916, 1918, 1923, 1924, 1928, 1932, 1939, 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1948, 1955, 1956, 1966, 1967, 1972\n\nEconomic sciences: –\n\nNobel Prize laureates and affiliation\n\nHere you can find out which universities, research institutions or companies Nobel Prize laureates were affiliated with at the time of the Nobel Prize announcement.\n\nNobel Prize laureates listedby affiliation\n\nThe youngest Nobel Prize laureates\n\nPhysics\n\nChemistry\n\nPhysiology or medicine\n\nLiterature\n\nPeace\n\nEconomic sciences\n\nThe oldest Nobel Prize laureates\n\nPhysics\n\nChemistry\n\nPhysiology or medicine\n\nLiterature\n\nPeace\n\nEconomic sciences\n\n65 Nobel Prizes to women\n\nBetween 1901 and 2023 the Nobel Prize and prize in economic sciences have been awarded 65 times to women.\n\nList of all female Nobel Prize laureates\n\nTwo Nobel Prize laureates declined the prize\n\nJean-Paul Sartre, awarded the 1964 Nobel Prize in Literature, declined the prize because he had consistently declined all official honours.\n\nLe DucTho, awarded the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize jointly with US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.

The Board of the Nobel Foundation examined the statutes, and an interpretation of the purpose of the rule above led to the conclusion that Ralph Steinman should continue to remain a Nobel Prize laureate, as the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet had announced the 2011 Nobel Prize laureates in physiology or medicine without knowing of his death.\n\n“Family Nobel Prize laureates”\n\nThe Curies were a very successful ‘Nobel Prize family’.

Since 1926, the ceremony has taken place at the Stockholm Concert Hall with few exceptions: 1971 in the Philadelphia Church; 1972 in the St. Erik International Fair (known today as Stockholm International Fairs) in Älvsjö, 1975 in the St. Erik International Fair and in 1991 at the Stockholm Globe Arena.

During 1905-1946 the Nobel Peace Prize award ceremonies were held at the Nobel Institute building, during 1947-1989 in the auditorium of the University of Oslo and since 1990 at the Oslo City Hall. The King of Norway is present, but it is the Chairman of the Nobel Committee who hands over the prize to the laureate/s.\n\nCeremonies archive\n\nThe Nobel Prize insignias\n\nAt the Nobel Prize award ceremonies on 10 December the Nobel Prize laureates receive three things: a Nobel Prize diploma, a Nobel Prize medal and a document confirming the Nobel Prize amount. Each Nobel Prize diploma is a unique work of art, created by foremost Swedish and Norwegian artists and calligraphers. The Nobel Prize medals are handmade with careful precision and in 18 carat recycled gold.\n\nThe Nobel Prize medals in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine and literature are identical on the face: it shows the image of Alfred Nobel and the years of his birth and death (1833-1896). Nobel’s portrait also appears on the Nobel Peace Prize medal and the medal for the prize in economic sciences, but with a slightly different design. The image on the reverse varies according to the institution awarding the prize.\n\nMore about the Nobel Prize medals\n\nThe Nobel Prize diplomas\n\nEach Nobel Prize diploma is a unique work of art, created by foremost Swedish and Norwegian artists and calligraphers.\n\nMore about the Nobel Prize diplomas\n\nThe Nobel Prize amount\n\nAlfred Nobel left most of his estate, more than SEK 31 million (today approximately SEK 1,702 million) to be converted into a fund and invested in “safe securities.” The income from the investments was to be “distributed annually in the form of prizes to those who during the preceding year have conferred the greatest benefit to mankind.”\n\nThe Nobel Prize amount for 2023 was set at Swedish kronor (SEK) 11.0 million per full Nobel Prize.\n\nMore about the Nobel Prize amount\n\n* Why are the individuals and organisations awarded a Nobel Prize called Nobel Prize laureates?\n\nThe word “laureate” refers to being signified by the laurel wreath. In Greek mythology, the god Apollo is represented wearing a laurel wreath on his head. A laurel wreath is a circular crown made of branches and leaves of the bay laurel (in Latin: Laurus nobilis). In Ancient Greece, laurel wreaths were awarded to victors as a sign of honour – both in athletic competitions and in poetic meets.\n\nMore facts on the Nobel Prizes"
