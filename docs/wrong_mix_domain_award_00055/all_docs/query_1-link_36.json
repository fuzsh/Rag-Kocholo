        "text": "The discovery of radioactivity opened the way to new fields of research and applications. In particular, starting in 1903, New Zealand-born British physicist Ernest Rutherford began examining the nature of the alpha radiation emitted by radium. In 1911, his study of this radiation led him to prove the existence of the atomic nucleus. This marked the beginning of nuclear physics.\n\nUpon receiving the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics, in accordance with tradition Pierre Curie gave a speech to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. His topic was radium and radioactivity. Now, over a century later, the conclusion of his speech seems more visionary than ever.\n\nIt can even be thought that radium could become very dangerous in criminal hands, and here the question can be raised whether mankind benefits from knowing the secrets of Nature, whether it is ready to profit from it or whether this knowledge will not be harmful for it. The example of the discoveries of Nobel is characteristic, as powerful explosives have enabled man to do wonderful work. They are also a terrible means of destruction in the hands of great criminals who are leading the peoples towards war. I am one of those who believe with Nobel that mankind will derive more good than harm from the new discoveries.\n\n1"
