        "text": "Congratulations are in order for HRH Crown Prince Hussein of Jordan on his engagement to Rajwa Khaled Bin Musaed Bin Saif Bin Abdulaziz Al Saif. The announcement was made by the Jordanian Royal Court on Wednesday.\n\nThe intimate engagement ceremony was held at Al Saif’s home in the Saudi capital of Riyadh in the presence of the royal’s parents, Their Majesties King Abdullah and Queen Rania. Other guests in attendance included Jordan’s Prince Hassan bin Talal, Prince Hashem bin Abdullah II, Prince Ali bin Al Hussein, Prince Hashem bin Al Hussein, Prince Ghazi bin Mohammed, Prince Rashid bin Al Hassan, and close members of the Al-Saif family.\n\nQueen Rania took to her Instagram account to share photos from the day and captioned them, “I didn’t think it was possible to hold so much joy in my heart! Congratulations to my eldest Prince Hussein and his beautiful bride-to-be, Rajwa.” Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman also wished the pair a “successful and a happy life” and extended his wishes to King Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein.\n\nWho is Rajwa Khaled Bin Musaed Bin Saif Bin Abdulaziz Al Saif?\n\nThe soon-to-be bride, Al Saif was born in Riyadh to Khalid bin Musaed bin Saif bin Abdulaziz al-Saif and Azza bint Nayef Abdulaziz Ahmed al-Sudairi on April 28 in 1994, and is the youngest of four siblings. The 28-year-old received her secondary education in Saudi Arabia, prior to leaving for New York to complete her higher education at the College of Architecture at Syracuse University.\n\nAl Saif also took a nine-day field trip to Dubai in 2016, as part of the course. “What made this trip so memorable for me was seeing the students in the studio experience Arabic culture and architecture for the first time,” wrote Al Saif on her university website. “Dubai is very intriguing, having contemporary architecture while also attempting to maintain the traditional beauty of the Arabic culture and history.”\n\nThe engagement follows that of Prince Hussein’s younger sister, Princess Iman bint Abdullah, who got engaged to Jameel Alexander Thermiotis earlier in July.\n\nBelow, take a look at all the pictures from Prince Hussein and Rajwa Al-Saif’s engagement."
