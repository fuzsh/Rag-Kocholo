        "text": "Wow, that is quite big news. The daughter-in-law of the former tsar of Bulgaria and mother of the next head of the royal Bulgarian family marrying into the Jordanian royal family. Did she have to convert to Islam as well? She 'erected'/'unveiled' (not sure what they did other than take a picture next to it) an Orthodox shrine with her sons only yesterday; see this post by Eya.\n\nI hope her sons are happy with these developments (although it will most likely not be a surprise to them).\n\nDid she have to convert to Islam as well? She 'erected'/'unveiled' (not sure what they did other than take a picture next to it) an Orthodox shrine with her sons only yesterday; see this post by Eya.\n\nI don't think so; a Muslim man can marry a Christian woman not requireing a conversion from her.\n\nAfter all, Princess Miriam is already too old to have children with Prince Ghazi.\n\nI hope her sons are happy with these developments (although it will most likely not be a surprise to them).\n\nAnd I hope his children are happy with them (especially the youngest one, Princess Salsabeel, who turns only eight on 1 October - the elder three are of age already).\n\nI don't think so; a Muslim man can marry a Christian woman not requireing a conversion from her.\n\nAfter all, Princess Miriam is already too old to have children with Prince Ghazi.\n\nAnd I hope his children are happy with them (especially the youngest one, Princess Salsabeel, who turns only eight on 1 October - the elder three are of age already).\n\nTrue! In their case the divorce of their parents is recent so all of this (including the speed in which things seem to have moved) must have been not easy to adjust to.\n\nWould the children live with their mother or father in the case of a divorce in the Jordanian royal family. Most likely their mother? It seems that Hamzah and Noor's daughter is living with Noor...\n\n\"Maryam\" is Arabic for Mary/Miriam.\n\nOh look, we finally had another royal/royal wedding, just a complete surprise one.\n\nDoes anybody have an idea as to how they got together, or do we wait for an explanation?\n\nNo information yet.\n\nBut according to Wikipedia, In 2017, with support from members of the Jordanian royal family, Miriam opened an exhibition of jewels and MdeU pieces ( her own jewellery line) at the Jordan National Gallery of Fine Arts.\n\nFrom King Simeon:\n\n\"On September 3, 2022, in the city of Amman, in the presence of the King of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan Abdullah II, Her Royal Highness Princess Miriam married His Royal Highness Prince Ghazi bin Mohammed\n\nThe Royal Court of Jordan issued an official statement: \"Their Highnesses Prince El Hassan bin Halal and Prince Talal bin Mohammed attended the ceremony. The Hashemite Royal Family wishes Their Royal Highnesses Prince Ghazi bin Mohammed and Princess Miriam Ghazi a long and happy life”.\n\nAfter the long painful period during the illness of Prince Kardam and his subsequent death, the Bulgarian Royal Family rejoices at this wedding. Even more so considering the friendship between the two families.\n\nPrince Ghazi bin Mohammed was born on October 15, 1966 in Amman. He was the son of Prince Mohaved bin Talal (1940–2021) and his first wife Princess Feriyal (born 1945 as Irshaid). His uncle is the late King Hussein of Jordan, making him a first cousin of the current monarch, King Abdullah II. The prince graduated from the prestigious \"Harrow\" high school in London, and then graduated from literature at one of the most prestigious universities in the world, \"Preston\". At the same time, N.C.V. also studied there. Prince Kiril Preslavski, both with the Jordanian prince as roommates during their studies. The prince is King Abdullah II's chief adviser on religious and cultural matters and the king's special envoy. He was also its regent.\n\nPrincess Miriam retains her Orthodox faith even after her wedding.\n\nPrince Ghazi bin Mohammed has been a friend of the Royal Family for many years. After the death of Prince Kardam, on his initiative, a stone commemorative plaque was placed in memory of the Prince on the bank of the Jordan River. This was one of Prince Kardam's favorite places in the Holy Land.\"\n\nhttps://www.kingsimeon.bg/2022/09/n...-za-negovo-kralsko-visochestvo-prints-gazi-b/\n\nThe Princess remains Christian,she was I assume raised Roman Catholic and converted to Eastern Orthodoxy in 1996 when she married Kardam, Prince of Turnovo.\n\nIt must be very rare that the brides of Princes do not convert to Islam upon marriage?\n\nIndeed, but i find interesting that she was allowed to retain her orthodox faith but the men who marry Princesses and don't have an official role usually have to convert."
