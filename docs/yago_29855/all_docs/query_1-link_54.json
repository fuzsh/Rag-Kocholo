        "text": "As far as I know he is the president of the Hashemite Charity Organisation who send aid to Iraq, Bam, Sudan, Algeria etc... they were also in charge of setting up the refugee camps in Ruwayshed before the war.\n\nTwo of his sisters are married with children and live in Jordan, Princess Sumaya runs the PSumaya Unniversity and I don't know what Princess Rahma does. His third sister Princess Badiya is not married and I think she lives in London.\n\nHave not heard that he is going to get engaged, do you know who to? But I have seen him out in Amman during the summer, he is very good looking so i would not be surprised if he was to get married soon, pity though! When i saw him he was with two very pretty girls and another guy, so maybe it is one of them!\n\nHappy 26th birthday to P. Rashid (and to my mother, who is only slightly older! ).

Recent commitments have included field hospitals and aid distribution in the West Bank, Algeria, Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq, South Sudan and those countries affected by the Tsunami. In addition to this, the HCO manages aid to charitable organizations and refugee camps in the Hashemite Kingdom. He currently remains in this post on secondment from the Jordanian Army.\n\nPrince Rashid is currently a Captain in the Jordan Armed Forces, between 1995 and 1998 undertook the following military courses:\n\n1998 - Jordanian Special Forces Ranger Course (Sa'ika).\n\n1998 - Jordanian Army Counter InfiTRFation & Urban Welfare Course.\n\n1998 - UK & Jordanian Armored Reconnaissance Troop Leaders Course.\n\n1997 - Short Service Limited Commissions Course RMA Sandhurst.\n\n1997 - Jordan Special Forces Counter Terrorist Course.\n\n1997 - Jordan Armed Forces Commissioning Course.\n\n1996 - Jordanian Special Forces Unarmed Combat Course.\n\n1995 - Jordanian Army Paratroopers Wings (37 jumps).\n\n1995 - Jordanian Coast guard Underwater Proficiency (SCUBA).\n\n1995 - Jordanian Royal Guard Close Protection Course.\n\nAfter serving as a troop leader with the British Light Dragoons Reconnaissance Regiment then of the UK First Armoured Division, Prince Rashid's last position in the Jordanian Army was as a company commander in Jordanian field reconnaissance battalion.\n\nDuring his time at Harrow, Prince Rashid founded the Interfaith Understanding Society. He also represented the school in polo, judo, rugby and in the public speaking teams. Prince Rashid is currently head of the National Boxing Federation and Captain of the Jordanian Polo Team. In July 2004, he captained an amateur team in the Polo World Cup defeating teams from India and France.\n\nPrince Rashid has accompanied his father, Prince El Hassan bin Talal, on military trips within the Kingdom, and visited Jordanian troops in Croatia and Bosnia on several occasions. He also served as a UN peace-keeper in the Balkans in the late 1990's. Prince Rashid also remains heavily involved wit h the majority of Prince Hassan's current activities.\n\nIn 1995, Prince Rashid worked with the Secretariat of the European Commission Training Office familiarising himself with the workings of the European Union. He has officially visited a number of countries including the Czech Republic, Turkey, Japan, Singapore, India, Ireland, Germany, the United States of America, Russia, Romania, Pakistan, Uzbekistan Poland, the United Kingdom, France, Canada and most Middle East countries.\n\nIn December 1994, The Prince accompanied His Majesty the late King Hussein to the Islamic Summit in Morocco.\n\nHis Royal Highness's interests include current affairs, 20th century history, polo, scuba diving and some martial arts.\n\nshelley said:\n\nYes, there is a link on his father's site : www.majliselhassan.org\n\nActually, I've tried this site:/www.elhassan.org, the one you provided didn't work so I did a search and got this site as a result.\n\nI attached the picture, Masha Allah he really looks nice and handsomethough I can see that his lips are turning a bit purplish from smoking\n\nThere are 2 more pictures in his bio of him playing polo http://www.elhassan.org/reg/family/rashid.html\n\nI think itâ€™s incredible that he went to Pakistan to help, he did go to several countries but I guess this time is different because of him being half Pakistani. I couldnâ€™t have been prouder of him.\n\nCondolences to the Pakistani members here in TRF and to the Pakistani and the people who got damaged from the earthquake.\n\nCopyrights http://www.elhassan.org/\n\nAttachments\n\nPRportraitResized.jpg\n\nI have looked at many oictures of this young man, and have come to the conclusion that he is not a morning person ! Whenever there are pictures that must have been taken later on in the day, he looks better. Apparantly, these planes always leave at the crack of dawn as they are very slow and need hours to get anywhere, so that figures ! May God bring him safely home.\n\nI am glad that he is actually out there doing something worthwhile .I often wonder how he feels about his lot in life. He was the only son of the man who was crown prince for thirty five years and then when his father was dumped he too lost out. But he finished his education, went to Sandhurst, has carved a professional niche for himself and also has found a sport that he enjoys doing and is reasonably good at. He was obviously not spolit despite the possibility being the only son and youngest child of his parents. I hope he finds a nice girl one day too.\n\nRashid was in the same year at Caius college with me; didn't know him that well but well enough that I would sometimes go over for a cup of tea. Really funny seeing a prince making me a cup of tea! I remember seeing him leave in a huge hurry from our college accomodation the day that the King died and the line of succession had changed. I asked him if he was alright as he got into the car; I didn't realize at the time that he was about to lose his inheritance. Very sad.\n\nJordanian Field Hospital Starts Mission in Pakistan Amman\n\nOct. 13(Petra)-- The field hospital dispatched by Jordan to Pakistan to help the affected people by the devastating earthquake that hit Pakistan on Saturday has been completed .

Search and rescue efforts stopped in Balalkut , therefore, the Jordanian rescue team will join the field hospital in Rawalkut to help in relief and evacuation operations. His Royal Highness Prince Rashed bin Al-Hassan who left the Kingdom inspected the hospital and was reassured on its tasks there.\n\nAn extract from the Pakistani newspapers:\n\nâ€‹\n\nhttp://www.dawn.com/2005/10/15\n\nThe News Internet Edition - English Newspaper of Pakistan\n\nMr Aziz said he discussed further promotion of political, diplomatic and economic ties with the Jordanian monarch, who was here on a brief visit.\n\nHe recalled the close and cordial relations between Pakistan and Jordan characterized by religious affinity and commonality of views on important issues.\n\nJordan was among a few countries that immediately responded to Pakistanâ€™s appeal for the international assistance following the quake.\n\nThe prime minister said Jordan had sent two plane-loads of relief goods and more assistance was on the way.\n\nEarlier in the day, Prince Rashid Bin El Hassan of Jordan also called on the prime minister to discuss relief efforts.Prince Rashid, the son of Prince Hassan Bin Talal and Princess Sarvath, personally escorted a mobile hospital on Oct 10. He supervised the entire process of setting up the 25-bed hospital in Rawalakot, which is manned by a support staff of over 50, including 11 doctors.\n\nhttp://www.petra.gov.jo/nepras/2005/Nov/21/28980500.htm\n\nPrince Rashid joins earthquake donors in Islamabad\n\nAmman/ Nov.21/(Petra)-- Deputizing for His Majesty King Abdullah II, HRH Prince Rashid bin Al Hassan joined an international donors conference on reconstruction held in Islamabad on Friday in the wake of October's devastating earthquake that killed about 74,000 people and left over 3.5 million homeless.
