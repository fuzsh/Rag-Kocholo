Her grandfather, Khan Bahadur Hafiz Mohammed Wilayatullah's family served for several generations at the Court of Bhopal, one of the largest Muslim Princely States. The family is reputed to have come originally from the Hijaz and are regarded as both Quraishi and Chishti. There are documents held in the State Archives of India which trace the family's presence in India back to the time of the Emperor Auranzeb, and it is assumed that some earlier branches of the family came to India with the first Muslim conquerors. Many of the Princess' paternal ancestors were writers and poets. Unusually, Her Royal Highness' great grandmother was a published authoress and her grandfather a well known poet of his time throughout India.\n\nBegum Shaista Suhrawardy Ikramullah,daughter of the well-known doctor, savant and statesman Sir Hassan Suhrawardy, and mother of Princess Sarvath, was Pakistan's first woman member of Parliament.

The family is directly descended from the Sufi mystic and saint Shaikh Shahabuddin Suhrawardy, who lived in Baghdad in the 12th Century. Shaikh Shahabuddin was the author of what came to be regarded as the standard work on mysticism 'Awriful-Maariffi'. He was a disciple and successor of Shaikh Abdel Kadir Gilani, and the mosques and shrines over their tombs still survive in Baghdad and are places of pilgrimage to this day.\n\nOther members of the family included Shaikh Shabuddin Yahya Suhrawardy, who came to be known as 'Shaikh al Makhtuli' and was born in Persia, but lived, was executed and buried in Aleppo. Many of the Suhrawardys were scholars and reformers. Her Royal Highness' great grandfather Shaikh Obaidullah al Obaidi Suhrawardy was known as the 'Bahr-ul-Uloom', or the sea of knowledge. He was not only ahighly respected scholar of Arabic and Persian, but unusually for that time, believed that English was the key to a modern education. He was also one of the founders of the Dacca Maddrassah, a boys' school founded very much on the principles of an English grammar or even public school, which was one of the very first bi and trilingual schools in the sub-continent. Shaheed Suhrawardy was one of the founders of Pakistan and held the posts of Finance Minister, Justice Minister andn Prime Minister of Pakistan. Begum Ikramullah's maternal ancestors were Persian Aristocrats from Shiraz who came to India in the 17th century."
