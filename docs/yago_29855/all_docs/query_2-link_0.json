        "text": "Jordanian prince (born 1947)\n\nPrince El Hassan bin Talal[1] (Arabic: الحسن بن طلال, born 20 March 1947)[2] is a member of the Jordanian royal family who was previously Crown Prince from 1965 to 1999, being removed just three weeks before King Hussein's death. He is now 20th in line to succeed his nephew King Abdullah II.\n\nBackground and personal life\n\n[edit]\n\nPrince El Hassan is a Prince of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. He is the third son of King Talal and Queen Zein. He is thus a younger brother of late King Hussein and uncle of the present King Abdullah II.\n\nPrince El Hassan is a descendant of Mohammed. His family is descended in patrilineage from Hassan, the elder of the two sons of Fatima Zahra and Ali, the daughter and son-in-law of Mohammed. {cite}\n\nMore recent male-line ancestors served as Sharifs of Mecca. In the early 1900s, the kingdom of Hejaz was set up in western Arabia by the Western powers in order to torment the Ottoman empire, and Hassan's great-grandfather, already Grand Sharif of Mecca, was made king of this state. That kingdom did not last long, being soon conquered by Al Saud. However, one of the sons of the Grand Sharif, Prince El Hassan's grandfather, King Abdullah I, became king of Transjordan in 1946. In 1949, after annexing the West Bank in Palestine, and \"uniting\" both banks of the Jordan River, it was constitutionally renamed the \"Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan\", commonly referred to nowadays as Kingdom of Jordan.\n\nMarriage and issue\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1968, Prince El Hassan married Sarvath Ikramullah, whose family belongs to the feudal aristocracy of Bhopal state in central India. Her father, Mohammed Ikramullah, was an Indian politician who chose to move to Pakistan at Partition and became a diplomat there. His brother (Princess Sarvath's uncle), Mohammad Hidayatullah, choosing to remain in India, rose to become the 11th Chief Justice of India and then, after retirement from the judiciary, became the 6th Vice President of India. Princess Sarvath's mother, Begum Shaista Suhrawardy Ikramullah, came from the prominent Suhrawardy family of Undivided Bengal. She was the daughter of Hassan Suhrawardy and first cousin of former Prime Minister of undivided Pakistan, Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy.\n\nPrince El Hassan and Begum Sarvath Ikramullah first met in London in 1958, when they were both mere children. Their families knew each other very well and they played together as children. In the mid-1960s, they married with the full consent of their families. They have four children together:\n\nPrincess Rahma (born 13 August 1969)\n\nPrincess Sumaya (born 14 May 1971)\n\nPrincess Badiya (born 28 March 1974)\n\nPrince Rashid (born 20 May 1979)\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nPrince El Hassan was educated first in Amman. He then attended Sandroyd School in Wiltshire before going on to Summer Fields School, Oxford, followed by Harrow School in England, then Christ Church, a college of the University of Oxford,[3] where he graduated BA with Honours in Oriental Studies and later proceeded to MA. Hassan is fluent in Arabic, English, French and German. He has a working knowledge of Turkish and Spanish, and studied Hebrew at university.[4]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1965, Hassan was named as Crown Prince of Jordan after the constitution was amended.[5] He was frequently regent during his brother's absences from the country. During Hussein's final illness in January 1999, he was replaced by his nephew Abdullah three weeks before the king died.[6] Abdullah subsequently inherited the throne of Jordan.\n\nIn 2009, he joined the project \"Soldiers of Peace\", a film against all wars and for global peace.[7][8]\n\nOn 10 June 2013, he was appointed as the chairman of the advisory board on water and sanitation (UNSGAB) by the United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.[9]\n\nRemoval as Crown Prince\n\n[edit]\n\nAs King Hussein was undergoing cancer treatment in mid-1998, the King assigned Crown Prince El Hassan a range of powers and authority to act as regent. With his newly gained powers, Hassan exercised a number of steps to consolidate his position as heir and future king, which included: (1) \"orchestrating the removal of the [unpopular] government\" of Abdelsalam Majali and appointing former Royal Court chief Fayez al-Tarawneh in his place, (2) organizing dialogue and reconciliation with opposition groups, most prominently the Muslim Brotherhood, and (3) attempting to effect changes at the top of the military. Hassan's attempted changes to the top hierarchy of the military angered King Hussein and led him to resume full duties as king. It is also a commonly cited reason for Hassan's removal as crown prince on 24 January 1999.[10] Hassan's removal took shape through a 14-page typed letter, described by American historian W. Andrew Terrill as \"extremely harsh\", in which King Hussein expressed \"unmistakable disappointment in Crown Prince El Hassan\" and ordered his replacement with Hussein's son Abdullah. Terrill describes King Hussein as perhaps having felt that Hassan had \"interest in shifting the line of succession to his own family\", which led to his dismissal as Crown Prince three weeks before Hussein's death.[11]\n\nCrown Prince El Hassan's attempted consolidation of power led the sickly King Hussein to break off \"intensive\" treatments for lymphoma and fly back home to Jordan in order to address the issue.[12] At first, the King attempted to negotiate with Hassan, placing the King's younger son Hamzah as Hassan's crown prince to ensure that the line of succession would not switch to Hassan's line. However, Hassan's Pakistani wife Sarvath vetoed the proposal, particularly because of her reported distaste for Hamzah's American-born mother Queen Noor and her desire to have her son Prince Rashid in the line of succession. King Hussein instead replaced Hassan with his own son Abdullah, who had backing within the military and whose position as eldest son of the king would allow him to be enthroned by royal fiat, unlike Hamzah whose enthronement would require confirmation from the Jordanian Parliament.[12]\n\nOrganizations\n\n[edit]\n\nPrince El Hassan has been a very active participant in Jordanian and International civil society. He founded the Royal Scientific Society in 1970, the Annual Bilad Al-Sham Conference in 1978, and the Royal Aal al-Bayt Institute for Islamic Thought in 1980. He has also established the Al al-Bayt University in Mafraq, the Hashemite Aid and Relief Agency, the Islamic Scientific Academy, the Triannual Conferences on the History and Archaeology of Jordan, the Amman Baccalaureate School, and the Al-Hassan Youth Award. He founded and chairs the Independent Bureau for Humanitarian Issues, Independent Commission on International Humanitarian Issues, the Higher Council for Science and Technology, the Royal Institute for Inter-Faith Studies, the Foundation for Intercultural and Interfaith Research and Dialogue, the Arab Thought Forum since 1981, the Kawakibi Democracy Transition Center, and the West Asia – North Africa Forum (WANA Forum), and was chair of the Policy Advisory Commission for the World Intellectual Property Organization from 1999 to 2002.\n\nHe has served as the president of the Club of Rome from 1999 to 2007, the board of directors for the Center for Peace Studies and Conflict Resolution at the University of Oklahoma, the Parliament of Cultures, the Royal Jordanian Polo Club, and the International Tolerance Foundation for Humanities and Social Studies, and is honorary president of the Euro-Mediterranean Association for Cooperation and Development since 2012.[13]\n\nPrince El Hassan is also a patron of the Post-War Reconstruction and Development Unit at the University of York,[14] the Swiss Rights and Humanity non-profit organization, the British Institute in Amman, and the Woolf Institute,[15] in addition to being a member of the Global Leadership Foundation, the Chairman the United Nations Secretary-General's Advisory Board on Water and Sanitation,[16] the Advisory Board of British think tank Gold Mercury International, the board of directors of the Nuclear Threat Initiative (since 2002), the Board of Trustees of the Foundation for Interreligious and Intercultural Research and Dialogue (FIIRD) at University of Geneva, Switzerland,[17] the Executive Committee of the International Crisis Group, the International Advisory Board of Forum 2000, the Committee of Personalities of Institut Catala De La Mediterrania, the Informal Advisory Group to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the Commission on Legal Empowerment of the Poor, the International Board of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Board of World Religious Leaders for the Elijah Interfaith Institute,[18] the Trilateral Commission, the Advisory Council for Research of the Center for Democracy and Community Development (since 2010), and the Independent Eminent Experts group of the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia, and Related Intolerance.\n\nPrince El Hassan supports ecocide becoming a crime at the International Criminal Court stating Ecocide would need to be a true ICC crime inline with the Rome Statute and in harnessing the power of international criminal law for the protection of our shared global government.'[19][20]\n\nHonours\n\n[edit]\n\nNational\n\n[edit]\n\nJordan:\n\nHonorary Knight Grand Cordon with Collar
