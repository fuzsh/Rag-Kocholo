The prince of Jordan, El Hassan bin Talal and his wife, Princess Sarvath El Hassan, visited the Pope in the Vatican.

During their meeting, they talked about inter-religious dialogue. In fact back in 1994, the prince founded the Royal Institute for Inter-Faith studies in the city of Amman, which promotes dialogue through academics.

They spoke for about 30 minutes and during the meeting the Prince also introduced members of his staff.

As a gift, the Prince gave the Pope three books with key texts of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The books are written in Hebrew, Greek and Arabic.
