        "text": "Fitness Standards\n\nPhysical Fitness Evaluation\n\nThe below training fitness standards are different from the Applicant Physical Abilities Test (APAT) fitness standards.\n\nThis hand-out has been designed to educate the reader on the United States Secret Service Physical Fitness standards and the proper protocols necessary to accomplish those standards. Recruits who will be attending training at the James J. Rowley Training Center (JJRTC) are expected to arrive in good physical condition, ready to begin a functional fitness program.\n\nThe fitness evaluation measures strength, endurance, and aerobic capacity in four core elements. The core elements are: push-ups, sit-ups, chin-ups, and the 1.5 mile run. The fitness evaluation will be administered at the beginning, during, and end of training. Secret Service weapon carrying employees are additionally required to participate in the Secret Service Physical Fitness Evaluation quarterly.\n\nThe following point system will be applied to the fitness category level achieved by the student in accordance with their age and gender. The point system will be applied to the four (4) core elements of the U.S. Secret Service Individual Fitness Profile Evaluation.\n\nStart in the UP position. Back and legs should be straight. Body should be pushed up with the arms fully extended with the elbows locked. Hands are shoulder width apart. Feet should be side by side with the toes tucked in. Lower your body to the floor until the chest contacts (a fist of the partner or a rolled up towel). Back should be kept straight and in line with the buttocks. Raise the body until the elbows are in a fully locked position. Repeat this sequence as many times as possible for ONE MINUTE.\n\nNORM FOR MALES\n\nPush Ups - 1 Minute\n\nFitness Category Point Value Age Category Level 20-29 30-39 40-49 50+ Excellent 4 55 50 42 39 Very Good 3 50-54 41-49 35-41 29-38 Good 2 46-49 36-40 28-34 21-28 Poor 1 38-45 30-35 22-27 16-20 Very Poor 0 37 29 21 15\n\nNORM FOR FEMALES\n\nFitness Category Point Value Age Category Level 20-29 30-39 40-49 50+ Excellent 4 40 30 23 23 Very Good 3 30-39 25-29 19-22 19-22 Good 2 26-29 20-24 12-18 12-18 Poor 1 20-25 13-19 8-11 8-11 Very Poor 0 19 12 7 7\n\nLie down on your back. Bend your knees and hips so your feet are flat on the ground. Your feet should also be anchored to the ground. Utilize a partner or a heavy object. Place your arms across your chest with the palms resting on opposite shoulders. Back should be in contact with the floor up to the bottom of the shoulder blades. This is the STARTING position. Curl upward until the elbows touch the thighs two to three inches from the knee. Return to the STARTING position until the entire shoulder blade touches the floor. Repeat this sequence as many times as possible in ONE MINUTE.\n\nNORM FOR MALES\n\nSit-Ups - 1 Minute\n\nFitness Category Point Value Age Category Level 20-29 30-39 40-49 50+ Excellent 4 47 43 39 35 Very Good 3 42-46 39-42 34-38 28-34 Good 2 38-41 35-38 29-33 24-27 Poor 1 33-37 30-34 24-28 19-23 Very Poor 0 32 29 23 18\n\nNORM FOR FEMALES\n\nFitness Category Point Value Age Category Level 20-29 30-39 40-49 50+ Excellent 4 44 35 29 24 Very Good 3 38-43 29-34 24-28 20-23 Good 2 32-37 25-28 20-23 14-19 Poor 1 27-31 20-24 14-19 13-10 Very Poor 0 26 19 13 9\n\nGrab the chin-up bar with a shoulder-width, under hand grip. Keeping your arms completely straight, hang at armsâ€™ length. You may cross your ankles behind you. This is the STARTING POSITION. You should return to this position each time you lower your body back down. Squeezing your shoulder blades together and pulling your upper arms down forcefully, pull your chest to the bar. ONE REPETITION is counted each time the chin rises above the bar. One cycle is completed when the body returns to the starting position with the arms fully extended. There is NO TIME LIMIT for this exercise.\n\nNORM FOR MALES\n\nChin-Ups\n\nFitness Category Point Value Age Category Level 20-29 30-39 40-49 50+ Excellent 4 11 10 8 5 Very Good 3 9-10 8-9 6-7 3-4 Good 2 7-8 6-7 4-5 2 Poor 1 5-6 5-6 2-3 1 Very Poor 0 4 2 1 0\n\nNORM FOR FEMALES\n\nFitness Category Point Value Age Category Level 20-29 30-39 40-49 50+ Excellent 4 4 4 4 4 Very Good 3 3 3 3 3 Good 2 2 2 2 2 Poor 1 1 1 1 1 Very Poor 0 0 0 0 0\n\nYou will cover a 1.5 mile course running at near maximum effort. This run will require a nearly exhaustive effort to attain your best score. You should refrain from eating two hours prior to the test, but drink plenty of water before and after the run. The run should not be done on a tread-mill. To simulate testing conditions during training, the run may be completed on asphalt and over a course that has varying levels of elevation.\n\nNORM FOR MALES\n\nFitness Category Point Value Age Category Level 20-29 30-39 40-49 50+ Excellent 4 10:16 10:47 11:44 12:51 Very Good 3 10:17-11:41 10:48-12:20 11:45-13:14 12:52-14:24 Good 2 11:42-12:51 12:21-13:36 13:15-14:29 14:25-15:26 Poor 1 12:52-14:13 13:37-14:52 14:30-15:41 15:27-16:43 Very Poor 0 14:14 14:53 15:42 16:44\n\nNORM FOR FEMALES\n\nFitness Category Point Value Age Category Level 20-29 30-39 40-49 50+ Excellent 4 12:50 13:42 14:30 15:56 Very Good 3 12:51-14:24 13:43-15:08 14:31-15:57 15:57-16:58 Good 2 14:25-15:26 15:09-15:57 15:58-16:58 16:59-17:54 Poor 1 15:27-16:33 15:58-17:14 16:59-18:00 17:55-18:49 Very Poor 0 16:34 17:15 18:01 18:50"
