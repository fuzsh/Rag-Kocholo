        "text": "While we often know a lot about physical illness, there tends to be less knowledge about mental health or substance use problems. This lack of understanding leads to fear and negative attitudes toward individuals living with mental health or substance use problems. It prevents people from seeking help and providing appropriate support to people around them.\n\nMental Health First Aid (MHFA) is offered to someone with an emerging mental health or substance use problem or in crisis, until appropriate treatment is found or the situation resolves. An evidence-based course, MHFA Standard has been proven to give participants:\n\nthe tools to recognize signs of decline in mental well-being.\n\nthe ability to talk about their mental health.\n\nthe knowledge to discuss professional and other supports that could help with recovery or improved mental well-being.\n\nthe confidence to reach out to these supports.\n\nthe tools to assist during a mental health or substance use crisis, and.\n\nthe knowledge to use MHFA actions to maintain oneâ€™s own mental wellness.\n\nThis 9-hour course opens with a self-directed module (Module 1) that focuses on the information and strategies that participants will discuss and practice throughout the live classroom modules (Modules 2 and 3). Course participants will complete Module 1 before participating in Modules 2 and 3.\n\nUpon registration, participants will receive a Participant Reference Guide which outlines MHFA actions for mental health and substance use problems and crises.\n\nModule 1: Self-directed module that introduces participants to the concepts of the course and Mental Health First Aid actions.\n\nModule 2: Live classroom module that discusses tools on how to apply MHFA actions to situations of declining mental well-being and guidelines for MHFA conversations with diverse populations.\n\nModule 3: Live classroom module that gives participants the opportunity to practice applying MHFA actions to crisis situations and discusses the importance of self-care."
