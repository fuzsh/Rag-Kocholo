But it’s nothing unless you know the walkie-talkie lingo.\n\nLuckily, mastering film set walkie talkie lingo isn’t as hard as finding your film crew. We’ve compiled the most-used walkie talkie codes and radio etiquette tips to have you saying “10-4 over and out” in no time.\n\nHow to Use Walkie Talkie Lingo\n\nwalkie talkie lingo\n\n1. What is common walkie talkie lingo?\n\nBefore you can give yourself a walkie talkie code name, you gotta speak the radio lingo. Think of this list as a walkie talkie dictionary:\n\n10-1 – “I need to go the bathroom” (number 1)\n\n10-2 – “I need to go the bathroom” (number 2)\n\n10-4 – “I understood the message”\n\n20 – Location; as in, “What’s your 20?”\n\nCopy – “I heard and understood the message”\n\nGo Again – “I did not understand the message, please repeat”. You can also say “come back on that”.\n\nEyes on… – When someone or something is spotted; as in, “I’ve got eyes on Spielberg” or “Does anyone have eyes on my lunch box?”\n\nFirst Team - The principal actors in in a scene, as in: “walking first team to set\"\n\nSecond Team - the stand-ins for the principal actors\n\nLock it Up – “Don’t let anyone through”. This is usually an instruction to a PA who was told of a door or area they must block.\n\nFlying in – When someone or something is en route; as in, “I’m flying in masking tape.”\n\nOn it – When you understand the request and are actively working on it. Use only if you have started the work.\n\nEthan for Nicky – ‘Ethan’ being your name, ‘Nicky’ being the person you want to reach.\n\nGo for Nicky – The response. “I heard you call for me, what’s up?”\n\nWalkie Check – When you first turn on your walkie talkie. Someone will reply with “Good Check” so you know your walkie talkies working.\n\nKeying – When someone is accidentally holding down the “talk” button on their walkie. Someone will catch it and say “keying” or “someone’s keying.”\n\nGoing off walkie – When you’re taking off your walkie talkie or can’t talk anymore.\n\nSpin that, please – When something is said on channel 1 that needs to be passed along to other channels. This is usually assigned to a key set PA or 2nd 2nd AD before the shoot.\n\nStandby – “I hear you, but I’m too busy to reply.”\n\nStanding by – “I’ve completed the task and am awaiting further instruction.”\n\nStrike (or 86) – When something needs to be removed; as in “Strike that prop” or “86 those C-stands from staging”.\n\nKill – When something needs to be turned off; as in “Kill the fog machine.”\n\nWHAT DOES 10-1 MEAN ON A FILM SET?\n\nOn a film set, 10-1 is the walkie talkie code for the bathroom. While literally meaning you need to pee, using as this as a catch-all saves your film crew from t.m.i.\n\nIf you find you need more time (maybe the craft services is all beans), just ask to “Upgrade your 10-1.”\n\nadvanced walkie talkie lingo\n\n2. Examples of advanced lingo\n\nFilm set slang is as infinite as it is weird. Now that we’re past ‘What’s your twenty,’ here’s some film crew terminology you could hear on a channel:\n\nAn example of a 2nd AD using a walkie talkie\n\nMartini shot – The last shot of the day. The next shot is \"Tequila.\"\n\nChoker – A tight close-up of eyes only, as in: “Flying in Mr. Depp for the choker.”\n\nBaby legs – The legs of a camera tripod.\n\nBogey – Sometimes “Bogie.” It’s someone not supposed to be on set.\n\nFour-banger – A large trailer with four doors, a production room, a dressing room, and a crew bathroom.\n\nHot Brick - A battery with a full charge.\n\nThere’s obviously more walkie talkie lingo beyond that, but it gets kind of random.\n\nwalkie talkie codes\n\n3. Radio etiquette on set?\n\nThis matters more than you think it does.\n\nGive up your walkie talkie if someone higher than you runs out of battery.\n\nSpeak slowly, clearly, and at a moderate volume.\n\nCut back on jokes and other non-sequiturs.\n\nLearn your crew’s voices to avoid constantly asking who you're speaking with.\n\nBe brief and to the point. Bluntness is best.\n\nThink before you speak. Concise your point into walkie talkie codes. Are you saying something offensive? Just think.\n\nWait a beat before you begin to speak. Don’t hit the button right when you speak. You’ll have to repeat yourself.\n\nBe aware of your walkie talkie’s buttons. Don’t accidentally switch your dials on, or turn down the volume and miss important instructions.\n\nAsk twice when needed. While it’s always best to say “10-4 over and out,” if you don’t understand, don’t be afraid to ask again. Repeating instructions back can help this.\n\nCheck your channel often to make sure you didn't forget to switch back.\n\nThink about buying your own surveillance earpiece. These are cheap and may be in short supply when you get to the set.\n\nKeep your mic a good distance from your mouth while speaking. You don't want your voice to be too loud. 3-5 inches away should be good enough.\n\nMake sure your mic wires are underneath the back of your shirt. Loose wires are a danger to yourself and others.\n\nLearning radio etiquette is a matter of experience. But more often than not, treating a walkie talkie as a powerful instrument of communication rather than a toy resolves most issues.\n\nPRO TIP: INVENT YOUR OWN WALKIE TALKIE LINGO\n\nAre you working with an ultra famous actor? Or how about a difficult to manage shark robot?\n\nThen create some walkie talkie code names. By tailoring your radio lingo to your specific project, you can save time and inject some fun throughout the production.\n\nIn StudioBinder, you can easily add walkie talkie channels when you create your call sheet.\n\nStudioBinder's Call Sheet Builder has footer space for channels.\n\nThat way when your crew gets their call sheet text the night before, they’ll be in the loop.\n\nwalkie talkie channel\n\n4. Walkie talkie channels on film sets\n\nNow you that you the most common walkie talkie codes, it’s time to turn to the channels. Not every production is the same.\n\nHere are some common walkie talkie channels you'll find on productions.\n\nWhile it can vary from set to set, the most common walkie talkie channels are:\n\nChannel 1 - Production\n\nChannel 2 - Open, for one-on-one conversation\n\nChannel 3 - Transportation\n\nChannel 4 - Open, for one-on-one conversation\n\nChannel 5 - Open, for one-on-one conversation\n\nChannel 6 - Camera\n\nChannel 7 - Electric\n\nChannel 8 - Grip\n\nPRO TIP: CHECK THE CALL SHEET FOR WALKIE TALKIE CHANNELS\n\nEvery film set is different. No two walkie talkie codes are alike. Before you walk on set, ready to sling radio lingo left and right, review the call sheet. The walkie talkie channels being used may have changed.\n\nwalkie talkie etiquette switching channel\n\n5. Switching channels etiquette\n\nThe number of channels and departments vary from production to production.\n\nChannel 1, however, will be the main channel. Used primarily by the production coordinator and PAs, this is where people call for each other and make general requests and notifications.\n\nFor one-on-one communication, switch to Channel 2. If you have a question or can’t reply with one of the terms above, Channel 2 is for you.\n\nTo switch walkie talkie channels, call for someone to “Switch to 2.” The receiver will respond: “Copy, switching to 2” and then \"On 2\" after they switch. Then, chat normally.\n\nWhen you’re finished, call: “Back to 1.” The receiver should respond “Copy, switching back to 1.” And voila.\n\nOn a hectic set, keeping walkie talkie channels open is key.\n\nA WALKIE TALKIE CONVERSATION EXAMPLE\n\nKnowing enough walkie talkie lingo, you can easily decipher this:\n\n1st AD: Does anyone have eyes on The Falcon?\n\nPA: Flying The Falcon in now.\n\n1st AD: What’s your 20?\n\nPA: Melrose and Santa Monica.\n\n1st AD: 10-4. Can you bring him to make-up?\n\nPA: Copy that, going off walkie.\n\nThe PA mounts a series of hard turns.\n\nPA: Walkie-check.\n\n1st AD: Good check.\n\nPA: Falcon at make-up. Standing by.\n\n1st AD: 10-4 over and out.\n\nCreate, send, and track call sheets in a snap.\n\nCall sheet spreadsheets are so 20th century. Create call sheets online. Send via email or text message.
