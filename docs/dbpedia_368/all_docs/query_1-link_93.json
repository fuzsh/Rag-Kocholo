        "text": "Columbus General Depot, Established 1918: For 100 years, a small military post in central Ohio played a major role in supporting U.S. servicemen and women around the world. The Defense Supply Center Columbus was established in 1962 after undergoing numerous name changes during its history dating back to 1918 when the military installation was constructed to support America's Allied Expeditionary Forces. DLA Land and Maritime, headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, provides weapons system and platform support to U.S. forces and federal agencies worldwide, managing more than two million unique inventory parts to support several thousand multiservice weapons systems and the warfighters who rely on them.\n\nINSTALLATION HISTORY\n\nThis center has served in every major military engagement since World War I. America's production effort in World War I arrived at an impasse in 1918 when transportation lines to ports of embarkation for troops and materials became filled to capacity. There was a clear need for a new military depot and although the Columbus site was a combination of swamp and farmland, it was advantageous because it afforded immediate access to three important railroad lines. The U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps made the first purchase of land, 281 acres, to construct a government military installation in April, 1918. Warehouse construction began in May of that year, and by August, six warehouses were receiving materiel for storage. Those original warehouses remained in use through the 1990s, but were demolished in 2000.\n\nAfter WWI, the installation's operations were reduced to the conditioning and sale of the stockpiles of materiel which had been needed in wartime. At the start of WWII, acquisition of additional acreage almost doubled the size of the installation as the civilian workforce rose to well over 10,000. This expansion made the Columbus Quartermaster Depot, as it was then known, the largest and busiest military supply installation in the world. During the final 11 months of the war, the depot housed more than 400 German prisoners of war.\n\nAmidst the wars, the conflicts and humanitarian relief efforts, the men and women of the installation worked continuously to establish direct and fast moving supply lines to support our troops in all parts of the world.\n\nThe installation's operational activities were assigned to the U.S. Army Supply and Maintenance Command in July 1962. The following year, it became the Defense Construction Supply Center under what is presently known as the Defense Logistics Agency.\n\nIn January 1996, the Defense Construction Supply Center was merged with the Defense Electronics Supply Center formerly of Dayton, Ohio, to arrive at its 14th name change, the Defense Supply Center Columbus.\n\nThe Center's 1996 reorganization was a product of the 1993 Base Realignment and Closure Commission's ordered merger. Decisions made during BRAC 1995 transitioned the center to a total weapon systems management posture.\n\nThe BRAC 2005 Commission noted that the Defense Supply Center Columbus had the ability to expand and take on new missions. These changes had a positive impact on the procurement landscape at Defense Supply Center Columbus, and are part of an ongoing process.\n\nDriving with Darbee: WOSU Columbus Neighborhoods special on the history of DSCC from its beginnings in 1918 to recent events. The video tours different historical sites around the base including the site where the original warehouses were, a WWII era warehouse and the site of a WWII POW camp for German soldiers on the land the base golf course occupies. It was produced in 2017 as part of the ongoing Columbus Neighborhoods series.

Today, the Defense Supply Center Columbus is host to 33 tenant organizations on the 520-acre site.\n\nIt is a unique installation that capitalizes on the synergy of state, federal and defense organizations such as the Ohio National Guard and Reserves, the Chalmers P. Wylie Ambulatory Care Center (VACC) , the Defense Finance and Accounting Service , and Defense Information Systems Agency , which are collocated on or near the site.\n\n2024 Commander in Chief's Annual Award for Installation Excellence winner\n\nDSCC is among the six winners of the 2024 Commander in Chief’s Annual Award for Installation Excellence.\n\nThe Commander in Chief’s Annual Award for Installation Excellence recognizes the outstanding and innovative efforts of the people who operate and maintain U.S. military installations.
