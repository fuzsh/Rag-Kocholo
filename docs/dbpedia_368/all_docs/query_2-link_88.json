        "text": "Why gender balance?\n\nThere is ample evidence that investing in women is the most effective way to lift communities, companies, and even countries. Countries with more gender equality have better economic growth. Companies with more women leaders perform better (see study, The Bottom Line: Corporate Performance and Women's Representation on Boards). Peace agreements that include women are more durable. Parliaments with more women enact more legislation on key social issues such as health, education, anti-discrimination and child support.\n\nThe evidence is clear: equality for women means progress for all.\n\nWomen in Maritime - IMO's gender programme\n\nToday, women represent only 1.2% percent of the global seafarer workforce as per the BIMCO/ICS 2021 Seafarer Workforce Report. This represents a positive trend in gender balance, with the report estimating 24,059 women serving as seafarers, which is a 45.8% increase compared with the 2015 report.\n\nWithin this historically male dominated industry, IMO has been making a concerted effort to help the industry move forward and support women to achieve a representation that is in keeping with twenty-first century expectations.\n\nWithin the framework of maritime development, and through its Women in Maritime programme, under the slogan: \"Training-Visibility-Recognition\", IMO has taken a strategic approach towards enhancing the contribution of women as key maritime stakeholders. IMO continues to support the participation of women in both shore-based and sea-going posts.\n\nIMO is strongly committed to helping its Member States achieve the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly Goal 5 \"Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls\".\n\nIMO's gender programme was initiated in 1988. At that time, only a few maritime training institutes opened their doors to female students. Since then, IMO's gender and capacity-building programme has helped put in place an institutional framework to incorporate a gender dimension into IMO's policies and procedures. This has supported access to maritime training and employment opportunities for women in the maritime sector.\n\nOther partners\n\nWISTA International\n\nThe Women's International Shipping and Trading Association (WISTA International) is an international networking organization with a mission is to attract and support women, at the management level, in the maritime, trading and logistics sectors. WISTA was granted consultative status with IMO in 2018.\n\nConsultative status gives WISTA the opportunity to promote diversity, inclusion and women's empowerment. WISTA can now formally contribute to the discussion for increasing capacity in the maritime industry, a critical component of which is promoting women in the industry, both shoreside and shipboard, and also showcasing the varied technical skills and leadership that women can and do bring to the industry.\n\nWISTA's efforts support the overarching principles in IMO's Strategic Plan, especially the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women. It is envisaged that WISTA will play an important role helping IMO reach out to women in the maritime industry.\n\nWISTA is a strategic partner to the GEF-UNDP-IMO major project on ‘Building Partnerships to Assist Developing Countries Minimize the Impacts from Aquatic Biofouling’, also known as ‘GloFouling Partnerships’. This partnership will help bring female experts, including marine scientists, to biofouling conferences and other project activities.\n\nWebsite: https://wistainternational.com"
