Originally serving as a movie house under Paramount Pictures with “an acre of seats”, it would later stage vaudeville shows and play host to the likes of the Marx Brothers, Frank Sinatra, George Burns, Bob Hope and more.\n\nLearn More\n\nShea's Smith 658 Main Street\n\nOnce Laube’s Old Spain, now a 237 seat “black box” theatre, Shea’s Smith Theatre has played host to Off-Broadway productions, comedy, and collaborative productions with local theatre companies since 2000. Somewhat of a chameleon space, it also offers ample room for events and special occasions with the adjoining Shea's Bistro & Bar.\n\nLearn More\n\nShea's 710 710 Main Street\n\nShea’s 710 Theatre is the latest space to be added to the Shea's PAC campus. Housing 558 seats and offering Broadway productions and plays produced by local and international theatre companies, it is considered a “thrust stage”, where the stage projects into the auditorium and audiences can sit on three sides.\n\nLearn More"
