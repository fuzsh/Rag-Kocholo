        "text": "In Phase 01, you’ll go through physical and mental challenges to test your ability to excel in basic leadership skills required of a commissioned Officer. You’ll also be expected to pass the Army Combat Fitness Test (ACFT), Leadership Reaction Course, and Combat Water Survival Test.\n\nIn Phase 02, you’ll put the skills you learned in the first phase to the test. You’ll be evaluated on your ability to lead a team during an intense 18-day mission in the field. This phase also includes Senior Leader Seminars and the Transitioning to Becoming Commissioned Officers course.\n\nYes. If you’re not already a Soldier, you must complete the 10-week Army Basic Combat Training or equivalent military basic skills course before enrolling in OCS. Enlisted and Army Reserve Soldiers enrolling in OCS would have already completed the course.\n\nAt graduation, you will be given a formal commission as a U.S. Army Officer and assigned to the rank of second lieutenant, the first of the commissioned ranks.\n\nWhile non-military college graduates and current military candidates do not compete with each other for available OCS slots, the more prepared you are for the physically rigorous demands of OCS, the better. About 65% of OCS applicants are accepted.\n\nThe better you score at OCS, the better your chances are to get the job you want. After you rank your top job choices based on what the Army has available, you’ll be matched with one of your preferred jobs based on an assessment of how your OCS scores and qualifications match the needs of the role."
