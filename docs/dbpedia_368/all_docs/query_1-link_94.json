        "text": "This information is designed to help teachers respond to students who may need support. It is not intended to be used as a diagnostic tool or to replace the use of formal assessments employed by mental health professionals. Additionally, it is important to consider the context of the situation, individual differences, and cultural and linguistic considerations.\n\nTeachers are an important part of establishing and maintaining healthy environments for children to learn and grow. Teachers can help students who are not confident in themselves or who are afraid to make a mistake to build their feelings of confidence. Teachers can also play an important role in referring students experiencing low self-esteem to professionals in the building who can be of assistance.\n\nPerceived competence is a belief that one has skills in a particular area (e.g., math, spelling, peer relationships). Self-esteem and perceived competence are necessary for students to take risks in their learning and to bounce back after failure or adversity. Low self-esteem or lack of confidence leaves students doubting their ability to succeed, making them hesitant to engage in learning or take appropriate academic growth risks. Self-esteem is often built and buttressed through estimable acts and achievementsâ€”even small ones."
