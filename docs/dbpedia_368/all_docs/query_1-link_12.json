Week One is preparation for the 12 weeks of training ahead. Recruits can expect a flurry of paperwork, haircuts, uniform and gear issue, medical evaluations and the initial strength test. By week’s end, they will meet the drill instructors who will be with them throughout training. In their quest to prove they belong with U.S. Marines, recruits will likely experience:\n\nFood rations and sleep deprivation\n\nRigorous round-the-clock marches\n\nLow- and no-light infiltration movements\n\nCombat resupply and casualty evacuation scenarios\n\nLeadership screening maneuvers\n\nValues-based training and assessments\n\nTeam-dependent negotiation of obstacles\n\nTeam field firing combat scenarios\n\nFun Fact\n\n: The U.S. Marine Corps mascot is Chesty, an English bulldog, named after Marine Lt. Gen. Louis B. “Chesty” Puller, the only Marine to earn five Navy Crosses.\n\nWhere Is Marine Basic Training?\n\nMarine recruiters work with the following locations for training: Marine recruiters work with the following locations for training:\n\nMarine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, South Carolina\n\nMarine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego, California\n\nThe East Coast location follows similar training programs to the West Coast location. In 2021, MCRD San Diego began accepting female recruits. Where recruits are assigned depends on which side of the Mississippi River they live. The intensity of recruit training leads to a bit of competition and rivalry between the two recruit depots. “Hollywood Marines” are made in San Diego, according to Marines hailing from Parris Island, the original MCRD.\n\nMCRD Mascot Matchup\n\nCpl. Opha May, an English Bulldog, is serving as Parris Island’s first female mascot. A distinction her namesake, Opha May Johnson, first earned as the Marine Corps’ first enlisted female in 1918. Lance Cpl. Manny is an English Bulldog named after Sgt. Johnny R. Manuelito, a Navajo Code Talker, serving as San Diego’s mascot.\n\nDo You Get Paid for Basic Training?\n\nRecruits earn pay as E1s during basic training. The Marine Corps will direct deposit payment on the 1st and 15th days of the month.\n\nPay for BMT depends upon your rank. Every enlisted recruit starts out as an E1, and can expect an annual salary of around $19,803.60.\n\nBMT is 13 weeks, so the average E1 payment for basic training is around $4,950 plus meals and housing.\n\nWhat to Bring to Basic Training Marines?\n\nRecruits should pack light. This talent will be among the first of many skills recruits learn. Your recruiter will tell you what you need to bring with you and what items you can’t take to basic training. Be sure to follow orders!\n\n9 Basics for Basic Training\n\nCasual and comfortable clothing, including white undies/bras, calf-length white socks and running shoes\n\nToiletries like toothbrush and case, toothpaste, dental floss and antiperspirant\n\nShower supplies including a washcloth and towel, flip-flops, shampoo, soap, razor and shaving cream\n\nHaircare items such as combs, brushes and hair elastics\n\nEyeglasses and case\n\nA lock (combo or padlock with two keys)\n\nPaperwork including orders, checking account direct deposit form, immunization records, high school diploma or GED, original college transcripts, proof of citizenship if not U.S. born, copies of a lease or rental agreement and copies of prescription medications\n\nFamily documents including certified copies of marriage certificate, divorce decree or separation order, certified copies of children’s birth certificates\n\nID cards including SSN, driver’s license or state ID\n\nMarine Basic Training Phases\n\nYou are probably wondering, “what is basic training like?” if you consider becoming a recruit.\n\nFrom the Marine basic training workout to combat water survival to marksmanship, each training phase will physically and mentally build up Marines’ skillset.\n\nPhase One\n\nReceiving\n\nBucket Issue (standard equipment)\n\nRifle Issue\n\nInitial Strength Test\n\nIntro to Marine Corps Martial Arts Program\n\nWeapons Safety\n\nClose Order Drill\n\nPhase Two\n\nCombat water survival\n\nPhysical and combat conditioning\n\nMartial arts\n\nAcademic instruction\n\nPhase Three\n\nFundamentals of marksmanship\n\nBasic warrior training\n\nField skills\n\nThe Crucible\n\nDid you know?\n\nThe Crucible is the final training exercise – 54 grueling hours of testing recruits’ knowledge, skills and values in the field.

Graduation isn’t a formal event. Think lots of walking, business casual and bleachers.\n\nFamily Resources\n\nFamily members can find more information about what their recruits are going through by visiting MCRD Parris Island or MCRD San Diego.\n\nHow to Contact Someone During Basic Training?\n\nIn an emergency, parents may contact the local Red Cross with details of a recruit’s crisis. The messages go to the recruit’s training battalion. Recruits will notify their family or recruiter when they arrive at training. After that, you can keep in touch with recruits through postcards and letters. Your recruit will send you their mailing address with company and platoon info.\n\nWhat Can I Send Someone During Basic Training?\n\nHold off on the care packages during boot camp. Recruits are focused on the task at hand – thriving in Marine Basic Training. Once your Marine goes to career training or receives an assignment, they will be thrilled to receive care packages.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe bottom line is that recruits are intentionally pushing their limits. Recruits learn to overcome weaknesses in preparation for their service to keep our great nation strong.\n\nU.S. Marines are often recognized as first on the ground – the “tip of the spear.” They are also routinely seen serving embassies in nearly 150 countries worldwide. U.S. Marines know martial arts like Jiu-Jitsu, Taekwondo and Krav Maga. Hence, they are prepared to kick ass without a weapon at all times. On the softer side, U.S. Marines’ premier community action program and beloved American Christmas charity – Toys for Tots, provides millions of kids in need with gifts.\n\nMarines take pride in knowing they stand among the few elite fighters in our country.
