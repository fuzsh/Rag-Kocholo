        "text": "Synopsis\n\nThree days before Red Notice's premiere, Dwayne Johnson said that there was \"there's a good chance\" that fans will see a follow-up to the film. When will 'Red Notice 2' be released?\n\nStarring Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot, and Ryan Reynolds, 'Red Notice' proved to be a major hit and it is still in the cards for Netflix. After it premiered on Netflix on November 12, 2021, it earned mixed reviews from critics with a 37% critic approval rating from Rotten Tomatoes. The audiences widely praised the chemistry of the three main stars. As the action movie became the most-watched film on Netflix, it is natural that it may have a sequel.\n\nDwayne Johnson: Good chance for follow-up\n\nThree days before Red Notice's premiere, Dwayne Johnson said that there is \"there's a good chance\" that fans would see a follow-up to the film. He told SiriusXM, \"I will tell you that just based on of reaction so far and what we've been able to cull from the audiences, there's a good chance that we will see a return of this.\"\n\n2 Red Notice sequels?\n\n'Deadline' reported in January 2022 that Netflix was in \"the early stages\" of planning a back-to-back filming of two Red Notice sequels, hoping that the shooting would begin in early 2023.\n\nRed Notice writer and director Rawson Marshall Thurber was asked to write the script. However, the filming did not begin on time due to the busy schedule of Johnson, Gadot, and Reynolds and the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes.\n\nGal Gadot: Script is finished\n\nBut, talking to 'Collider' in Jun 2023, Gal Gadot said that the script was finished. She said, \"We’re all talking about it. I don’t know if I can say anything! I already read the second script and it’s, whoo! We’re all very excited about it!\".\n\nRed Notice Producer Beau Flynn told 'Collider' that the plan to film back-to-back would depend on the scripts of the follow-ups and how the main trio feels about them. He said, \"Well, we have a ‘Red Notice 2’ script and almost ['Red Notice'] 3. The plan is hopefully if Hiram and I have our way we will make those movies back to back. But it’s going to be all about the scripts and how we feel and how Dwayne, Gal, and Ryan feel about them.\"\n\nWhen will filming begin?\n\nHowever, the filming is not likely to begin in early 2024 as Reynolds is busy Deadpool 3 schedule and Johnson is committed to the WWE during the Wrestlemania 40 season between March and April 2024.\n\nThe production for 'Red Notice 2' may start in late 2024. So, it could potentially be released in mid to late 2025, possibly following in the footsteps of the first film in November 2025.\n\nFAQs:\n\nWhen did Netflix plan to make 2 sequels of 'Red Notice'?\n\n'Deadline' reported in January 2022 that Netflix was in \"the early stages\" of planning a back-to-back filming of two Red Notice sequels, hoping that the shooting would begin in early 2023.\n\nWhen may the production of 'Red Notice 2' begin?\n\nThe production for 'Red Notice 2' may start in late 2024.
