        "text": "Any disqualifications that appear during your MEPS physical exam or interview may prevent you from joining the Army. These disqualifications can include illegal drug use, alcohol dependence, not meeting height and weight requirements, having certain contagious diseases, among others.\n\nAdditionally, law violations can prevent you from enlisting, such as being convicted of any crime that prohibits you from carrying a firearm.\n\nMany conditions require a medical report, and itâ€™s best to obtain these reports prior to your arrival at MEPS so you can complete the full process. Your recruiter can also help you obtain medical records before MEPS and help you complete any waivers, if needed.\n\nWith 65 MEPS located nationwide(Opens in new window), you will work with your recruiter to find one nearest your home. The Army provides lodging at a hotel near the MEPS location for those needing accommodations. This also gives you a chance to get settled and get to know other recruits.\n\nYour parents/guardians are allowed to accompany you to MEPS but are not allowed in the area where the processing and examinations take place. During the Oath of Enlistment ceremony, parents, family, and guests are welcomed to watch and take pictures.\n\nThere are many medical conditions that require a waiver to allow you to serve. Be sure to share all your medical history with your recruiter, so they can help you get the proper documentation and waiver(s) if needed. Failure to do so can result in delays at MEPS or even disqualification from enlistment."
