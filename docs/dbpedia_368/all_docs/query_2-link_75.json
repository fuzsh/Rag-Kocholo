Before an interview or your first day of work, you may be unsure of what exactly the company's dress code is like. Knowing the dress code can help you feel confident and dress appropriately, so you should try to figure out the dress code ahead of time.

Dress codes are especially essential in businesses that meet directly with clients or with other professionals. As an employee, you represent your company, so you must dress appropriately for work.

And how does business casual look different than business formal? Get answers to these questions and more tips on business attire.\n\nCommon workplace dress codes\n\nSome companies may not outline a specific dress code. Instead, they might tell you what the dress code is, and you are responsible for understanding what that entails. Here are four types of common workplace dress codes:\n\nBusiness formal\n\nBusiness formal is the highest level of professional dress code and is most common in high-level or executive positions. Business formal involves wearing a tailored suit or skirt suit and a white button-up shirt with a collar. This type of dress code allows for the least variation. Acceptable suit and shoe colors include black, gray, navy or another neutral color. Acceptable footwear includes oxfords and closed-toe high heels. Men typically wear solid-colored ties with their suits, and women often wear tights when they wear a skirt.\n\nBusiness professional\n\nBusiness professional is somewhat more relaxed than business formal, but it is still very conservative. A business professional dress code is common in professional offices. This dress code typically involves wearing a suit or a skirt paired with a blouse and jacket. Men also have the option of wearing dress pants with a sports jacket as opposed to a suit. Business professional allows for more variety, and people can wear more colors in their shirts, ties and accessories. Men and women should wear closed-toe shoes, such as oxfords, loafers and high heels.\n\nBusiness casual\n\nBusiness casual is the most common dress code in American workplaces, and it can vary based on each workplace. Men typically wear dress pants or khaki pants with collared button-up shirts, and they may also wear a sweater over this shirt. Women can wear business separates and blouses or shirts without collars. This dress code allows for more variation of color in shirts and pants, but patterns should still be simple or reserved for ties and accessories. Closed-toe shoes are still often preferred, but they can be more comfortable as long as they remain professional.\n\nCasual\n\nCasual is the most relaxed type of dress code and is often implemented in creative industries. Casual pants, slacks and skirts are allowed under a casual dress code. Jeans may be permitted depending on the company, but they should always be dark wash and free from holes or designs. Acceptable shirts include polo shirts, sweaters and conservative blouses. Employees can include more patterns in their wardrobe as well. Clean sneakers and open-toe shoes are allowed in a casual workplace, but sandals typically are not.Related: 125 Common Interview Questions and Answers (With Tips)\n\nVideo: First Impressions: Prepare for Your First Day\n\nIn this video, Jenn, an Indeed Career Coach, explains how to prepare for your first day, and provides 4 DO’s and DON’Ts when starting a new job.\n\nHow to ask about dress code\n\nIf you aren't sure what the dress code for a company is, here are some steps you can take to find out:\n\n1. Ask your point of contact\n\nOne way to ask about the dress code is to be direct. If you spoke with a recruiter or hiring manager on the phone, you can simply ask them what the dress code is ahead of your interview or the first day of work. If you have already been hired, they might forget to mention the dress code to you. If you are going for an interview, it is not common for the hiring manager to mention a specific dress code, but asking ahead of time can show your dedication to the company.\n\n2. Network with employees\n\nIf you don't want to ask the hiring manager about the dress code, you can network with the company's current employees. Other employees can be a great resource to determine what to wear for your interview or first day. This can even be a good way to start a conversation with your future coworkers, and they will most likely remember feeling the same way when they started at the company.You might be able to speak to some employees before or after your interview. You can also connect with people online through the company's social media pages.\n\n3. Examine what people wear\n\nIf you have an in-person interview at the company's office, you might not even have to ask about the dress code. You can look to see what everyone else is wearing to determine what the dress code for the company is like. The best way to execute this approach is to look for people working in similar roles to the one you're seeking. Your hiring manager might not be the best example of the company's dress code because they may have dressed up more formally for the interview.\n\n4. Ask at the end of the interview\n\nIf you decide to ask about the dress code during your interview, you should save this question for last. This shouldn't be the most important question, and it is best to frame it as something you are asking because you want the job and want to prepare for your first day. Also, consider how you phrase the question. Rather than asking whether there is a dress code, ask what the company's dress code is to appear more professional.Related: How to Answer \"Tell Me About Yourself\" (Tips and Example Answers)\n\nImage description\n\nBusiness professional typically refers to clothing choices like dark-colored (gray, navy) suits and ties, pantsuits, tidy dresses, skirts or slacks. Tops include button-down shirts (in colors like white or light-blue), blouses and a blazer.Shoes should be closed-toe like an Oxford, loafer and classic heels no higher than 3 inches. Accessories can include minimal jewelry, matching belts and ties in a solid color or stripes. Avoid chunky, noisy jewelry, bold colors and busy patterns.\n\nTips for dressing for your first day of work\n\nDressing for your first day of work can be a big decision. To help make your choice easier, here are some tips for how to dress on your first day of work:\n\nDress comfortably\n\nIt's a good idea to wear something comfortable on your first day of work. You may feel a little nervous on your first day, so wearing something comfortable can help you settle into your new role and workplace more easily. Wearing something comfortable also allows you to focus more on your job and avoid distractions like scratchy material or wobbly shoes.\n\nDon't take chances yet\n\nIf you're considering something that you're not sure fits in the dress code, don't wear it. You can find out later if you can wear that item, but pick something that you know is appropriate for your first day on the job. If you're still unsure of how professional you should dress, it's a good idea to dress more professionally rather than casually.\n\nWear layers\n\nWearing layers is a great idea because it gives you more options. Before you start your job, you probably don't know what the temperature is like in the workplace. Some offices have poor airflow that makes it humid, while other offices have the air conditioning on all day. Wearing layers allows you to be comfortable regardless of what the environment is like. If you wear a nice shirt under your jacket, you can remove your jacket during lunch or breaks to be more comfortable.\n\n&nbsp;"
