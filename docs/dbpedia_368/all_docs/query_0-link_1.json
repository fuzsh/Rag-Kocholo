        "text": "Tight police drama with D.A. Edward G. Robinson trying to protect witness Ginger Rogers from the clutches of evil crime lord Lorne Greene. Rogers and Robinson are both marvelously vulnerable beneath their complementary tough exteriors. The direction is tense throughout. The film makes excellent use of its claustrophobic environs. Brian Keith is also very good as a tough cop.\n\nGinger Gets a Revival\n\nAuthor: dougdoepke from Claremont, USA\n\n12 September 2010\n\nI love it when Mississippi Mac bangs out a tune on his head using a rubber mallet, a clever touch getting comedy relief from a TV parody of a country and western telethon. Otherwise, it’s a pretty somber movie and extended showcase for Rogers then coming off a reverse blacklist of Hollywood right-wingers.\n\nAs it is, Rogers gets ninety minutes of snappy dialog with more brass than spent cartridges on a rifle range. But, frankly, all the tough talk and attitude does get tiresome despite her spirited effort. The fact that she’s 40-something and starting to bulge strikes me as just right for the aging party-girl part. Remember, Sherry (Rogers) is supposed to have been around the block more than a few times and is now looking back over what she suspects is a misspent life. That’s what makes her otherwise hardened character rather poignant and vulnerable.\n\nWhat a shrewd piece of casting to pair the high-key Rogers with the low-key Bryan Keith. At this career stage, Keith was one of the more subtle actors around, able to convey a lot by doing very little. Director Karlson apparently liked him too, casting him also in his 5 Against the House (1955). And for Robinson and Rogers, it must have seemed like old home week at Warner Bros.\n\nBut truth be told, cult director Karlson is wasted in a crime drama that any one of a dozen lesser directors could have handled. At the same time, I didn’t see the major plot twist coming which strikes me as the most memorable part of a too-stagey film; although, like other reviewers, that family spat with sister Clara (McVeagh) is a real barn burner and high point. Anyway, the film’s an okay crime story that really serves as a vehicle for a Ginger Rogers career revival.\n\nA Rough Little Noir With A Fine Cast\n\nAuthor: David (Handlinghandel) from NY, NY\n\n27 August 2006\n\nGinger Rogers is good as the tough-talking woman sprung from prison to testify in a trial. What a strange career she had! Best known for her movies with Fred Astaire, she was also a delightful comedienne. She did some serious work in her prime, winning an Oscar for an only-OK soap opera. But she’s good in “Primrose Path.” She turned tough in many of her fifties outings, and she looked tough too. Here she has sort of a pixie haircut that doesn’t quite work with the character and isn’t flattering to her. But she’s excellent.\n\nEdward G. Robinson, billed second to her, is superb. He always was. That man was incapable of giving a bad performance, no matter how oddly cast he might have been at times. Brian Keith, whom many know for sunny outings in later television, is exceptional as a very tough cop. He really is the focus of this movie, though the Rogers character is the lead.\n\nWho in the world was Lucy Marlow, who got fourth billing? It says prison girl. Hmm. The woman playing the matron, Katherine Anderson, is important to the plot. She is very touching as well.\n\nLorne Green is another actor who played some mean hombres before he became the benevolent dad on TV’s “Bonanza.” His character is less nuanced than the one he plays in “Autumn Leaves.” But he does well by it.\n\nPhil Karlson was an excellent director, who had some of the nastiest, darkest, roughest noirs of the fifties under his belt. This is among the best of them.\n\nThis film is very different from anything of it’s time that I have ever seen.A man has a one night stand with a coworker and gets her pregnant.THEN he meets the woman of his dreams,the woman with everything;charm,good looks and Daddy’s money.We then have a man who is torn between choosing to have it all and doing the right thing.The result of his struggles ends up very tragically as you will see.I was very taken aback by the film’s sexual overtones,though it was only hinted at,of course.With the barrage of remakes in recent years,I am surprised it has not been remade with stronger sexual content.This is a very enjoyable film with good performances all around,particularly those of Shelley Winters and Monty Clift.Liz Taylor’s strong screen presence is also a delight.A definite thumbs up.\n\nAn American Tragedy, on film, becomes an American masterpiece\n\nAuthor: bmacv from Western New York\n\n1 September 2003\n\nBringing Theodore Dreiser’s sprawling novel An American Tragedy to the screen must have been a daunting task, made harder by the constraints Paramount imposed on director George Stevens. The studio had lost big on a version made 20 years earlier, under Josef von Sternberg, and had little faith in a remake. So, hobbled by a tight budget, Stevens scaled back his ambitious plans but delivered, perhaps even to his own surprise, a superbly crafted and and powerfully sustained work of movie art.\n\nHe was lucky that Paramount, edgy about the story, gave him a cast that would guarantee not only good box office but solid performances as well. Montgomery Clift, Elizabeth Taylor and Shelly Winters take the principal roles, with, in the last third of the movie, extra oomph courtesy of Raymond Burr (in a role that may have nabbed him the Perry Mason franchise).\n\nThe jaws of the vise Clift finds himself squeezed into are class and sex. Barely educated, raised by stern members of a religious sect, he luckily (or not) happens to be the shirt-tail nephew of a prosperous entrepreneur who casually offers him work in his factory. Awkward and lonesome, Clift escapes the drudgery of his job by taking up with a mousy co-worker (Winters, toned way down from her platinum-bombshell image at the time). But his nose-to-the-grindstone ways attract the attention of his uncle, who rewards him with a promotion and an invitation up to the manor.\n\nThere he meets Taylor and launches an obsession about her, reinforced by a neon sign visible from his window that blazes her surname through his restless nights (she’s another child of an industrial fortune, raised in wealth and privilege). Somehow, she falls for him – and, need it be added, he for her – despite his coming from the wrong side of the tracks (she hasn’t the faintest notion that for people like him, life may not be the blithe affair it is for her).\n\nOnly one inconvenient fact keeps Clift from taking his rightful place in the sun: He’s left Winters pregnant. The two worlds he occupies are destined to collide, and crash they do when Winters phones him, in the midst of a Hawaiian-themed luau at Taylor’s summer place on the lake, to issue her ultimatum: Marry her or she’ll spill their sordid secret. He leaves abruptly to meet Winters, desperately trying to assemble the plan which will seal three fates.\n\nStevens sustains an overwhelming, ominous momentum, unbroken by even a hint of levity (not even a single bit player is allowed to lapse into shtik). Languorous dissolves and superimposed images heighten the sense of inevitability as each scene, each event glides seamlessly into the next.\n\nMaybe he wasn’t able to pile on the exhaustive social commentary that bulked up Dreiser’s novel, but everywhere there’s sharp detail that he adroitly leaves to be noticed. When Clift shows up hours late at his intimate birthday party in Winter’s cramped room, with the tiny table pushed up against her marble washstand, the ice cream has warmed to lumpy syrup (a self-homage to a similar scene in Steven’s Alice Adams?). With an island combo playing merrily on, Clift sports a lei and eats pineapple out of its shell when Winters calls to break the spell – and this South-Seas reverie is offered up not as Veblenesque excess, but merely as the way Taylor’s crowd spend their days and evenings and nights in an endless round of heedless gaiety.\n\nThe apex of the film’s crescendo is handled with tight, quiet assurance – the reckoning in a rowboat upon a deserted lake. Dusk gathers among the pines like fog, the loons call back and forth, and the rippling waves reflect a demented flash into Clift’s eye as he wrestles with his conscience. Winters natters nervously about the dreary life they’ll spend together while his head swims with luminous visions of Taylor. Then, destiny catches…. Romantic but unsentimental, serious but without pretension, gripping without stooping to the manipulative, A Place in the Sun ranks as a masterpiece of American cinema.\n\nClift, Taylor, Stevens and a spellbinding American tragedy\n\nAuthor: M. J Arocena from New Zealand\n\n28 February 2007\n\nTime does extraordinary things with greatness. If nothing else it confirms it. “A Place in the Sun” is a remarkable example of that theory. I rushed to buy a DVD after watching a BBC documentary on ELizabeth Taylor to celebrate her 75th birthday! In “A Place on the Sun” an Elizabeth Taylor barely out of her teens is paired with Montgomery Clift. She had been raised at MGM and groomed for movie stardom from day one. He was a method actor, complex, introspective and their coupling produced something that I’m tempted to call, unrepeatable. The actors own personal stories, their friendship, mutual love and respect made it possible for their communion to be so transcendental. To make things even more perfect, the film seems a love letter from director George Stevens to his stars and vice versa. Look at the opening credits and tell me if you’ve ever seen a more startling introduction to a character/star. The story of doomed love and descend into darkness is, without question, one of the best ever made.\n\nLet’s hear it for William C. Mellor\n\nAuthor: nick-368 from Caversham, England\n\n18 October 2004\n\nIsn’t IMDb great? As well as reading the detailed and thoughtful criticisms from contributors about a film like this, you can browse through all sorts of IMDb trivia, discovering interesting stuff all the time. My latest favourite activity on the site is checking out films that won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography. Needless to say A Place in the Sun won this award for William C. Mellor. Much has already been said of the beauty and precision of the images. I’d like to add a comment about one shot where Clift is coerced into a speedboat ride with Taylor and her rich pals. The static camera is on the jetty with a portable radio in close-up. The speedboat pulling away and doing a spin in the bay occupies our middle vision, while hills and boats lie in the distance. All of them are in wonderful pin-sharp deep focus, a skill that seems all but lost in today’s productions. The radio announces the discovery of the girl’s body while the boat speeds past, completing the dramatic reason for the shot.\n\nA funny thing I’ve noticed about these great cinematographers is they all seemed to live a good long life, usually working right up the end of their lives. I don’t know why, I just thought I’d mention it!\n\nAs a Film, This is Haunting, Tragic Romanticism…\n\nAuthor: Donald J. Lamb from Philadelphia, PA\n\n4 April 1999\n\nGeorge Stevens’ A PLACE IN THE SUN is a poetic film, filled with tender moments, sadness, and pending doom. Having not read the book, I had the pleasure of seeing the material for the first time, which is preferable if you see a film based on a “classic” novel. Montgomery Clift is his usual mysterious self as he has a scandalous relationship with the homely Shelly Winters and falls instantly in love with a spellbindingly beautiful Liz Taylor, who was only 19 when the picture was made. She glows with energy and a sense of optimism about life, a stark contrast to Clift, whom Taylor has also fallen for. Rumor has it they had an actual affair while making the movie. This is not for all tastes, for it is slow, and Clift is not all that appealing. The idea of dropping a lesser life (with Winters) and pursuing the good life with Taylor is what makes it work and the lengths to which Clift will go are staggering.\n\nGeorge Stevens has a gift for “painting” a movie on-screen. Just see GIANT, also with Taylor, or SHANE, the other two parts of his “American Trilogy”. The scenes on the lake and the way the mood of the movie is painted is quite simply amazing. He also uses slow dissolves that leave a ghostly image on-screen between scenes. This all adds to the atmospheric touch of tragedy that will ensue. Poor Shelly Winters. She always gets a raw deal in films. There are times when you almost sympathize with Clift. Imagine living the life of a socialite with the girl of your dreams and a good job with your family. A life with Winters would be dismal according to Clift and us. What’s right is right, however. An unnecessary court room saga closes the picture to ensure the viewer’s sense of justice. This must’ve been pretty controversial stuff back in the early-50’s\n\nA PLACE IN THE SUN truly is an American tragedy, a portrait of young lives gone wrong with post-WWII optimism as a backdrop. Clift and Taylor shine together, and provide film fans with a romance never to be forgotten. The finale is emotionally draining during Taylor’s expression of undying love. Unfortunately, Clift cannot have it all. A beautiful piece of classical Hollywood film-making with a mix of method acting (Clift) and a love story we wish could work.\n\nStevens took a sensitivity that hadn’t been used since “Jane Eyre.”\n\nAuthor: Righty-Sock (robertfrangie@hotmail.com) from Mexico\n\n31 January 2009\n\nThis is a movie about George Eastman (Clift), a young, gentle laborer without social standing who longs for the better things in life…He is swept off his feet after a chance encounter with wealth, success and upper-class snobbery…\n\nGeorge is introduced to a stunning socialite Angela Vickers (Liz Taylor—never so beautiful) full of sensual delight and threatened by an unattractive factory girl (Alice) he’s already made pregnant… Angela and George fall deeply in love, but Alice Tripp (Winters) presses and chases George until he agrees to marry her… He has a desperate decision, but hesitates… Finding they can’t get married over the Labor Day weekend, George takes Alice boating…\n\nShelley Winters was extraordinary as the distressed co-worker… She made the wronged employee an understandable reaction to human dimensions… As she sits in the rowboat, unconsciously torturing Clift with her thoughts of their future together, Winters is both pathetic and annoying—a special candidate to get rid of…\n\nThe impact of the film depends absolutely on a moral climate that has now less impact on our society… Pre-marital sex is no longer disapproved and abortions are easier to obtain… But the film’s power resided in its exceptionally convincing depiction of the points and questions created by these situations…\n\n“A Place in the Sun” was nominated for nine Academy Awards, and won six…\n\nThe Truth Has A Way Of Sneaking Up On You\n\nAuthor: ccthemovieman-1 from United States\n\n30 November 2005\n\nThis 1950s melodrama was an interesting, involving story. It’s part film-noir, too, which I liked. I say that because the last third of the film featured an expectation of some dreaded act about to be committed, giving it a film noir feel.\n\nOne thing for sure, whatever you label the movie: it’s well-acted, well-directed and well-photographed. Regarding the latter, this really looks good on DVD. No surprise it’s directed well since George Stevens was the director. His resume speaks for itself.\n\nObviously Montgomery Clift and Elizabeth Taylor are the “big names” in this film, but I found Shelly Winters and the character she played to be the most intriguing. She wasn’t really appealing yet one could certainly identify with her feelings of insecurity with Taylor as her competition. “Liz” was in in her prime, looks-wise, with an absolutely classic face.\n\nAnyway, watching the character studies of the antsy Winters and the troublesome Clift were interesting. Clift, as is the case with most of us, causes his own problems and things slowly unravel for him. The story is another example of what can happen when one tries to cover up the truth. It comes back to bite you, big-time!\n\nI really found it refreshing, however, to see Clift’s attitude at the end. It’s the exact opposite of what you hear today. He actually takes responsibility for his actions.\n\nMotor-Cross Meets Dragnet\n\nSolid little programmer from MGM’s B period. The documentary influence of TV’s Dragnet (1951-1959) is apparent in the early police training segment that looks like it was done at the actual Academy. Three trainees buddy-up there, but later switch to the better-paying motorcycle division. There they get involved with black market beef haulers and excitement ensues. Director Wilcox keeps things moving smoothly, while the filming in and around LA lends a realistic feel. Then too, Wynn gets to practice his tart brand of sarcasm as a tough but fair training officer, lending helpful color. As could be expected, the girls (Forrest and Stewart) are strictly secondary, as wife and girlfriend, respectively.\n\nMeeker gets to play a cocky trainee in what could have been a warm-up for his classic Mike Hammer in Kiss Me Deadly (1955). I hope they paid him double for all his stunt work at the end. He earns it. For fans of two-wheelers, there’s a lot of motorcycle cross-country action that shows off their rugged versatility. And what a coincidence, as another reviewer points out, that so many of the male cast went on to cowboy starring roles on TV—look for Chuck Connors as a deputy sheriff in an office scene about 2/3 of the way through. All in all, it’s a solid programmer of the sort soon to migrate to TV, but holds interest, nevertheless.\n\nGreat bad guy vs. motorcycle cops! Lots of old Harley’s!\n\nAuthor: ihunt4u from Ft. Lauderdale, FL\n\n23 July 2000\n\nI saw this movie as a kid when i was about 13 or so. I remeber this as one of the coolest movies I have ever seen. I am sure, now it would seem a little less dramatic, but it has stayed with me all these years. There is one scene where the truck hijackers are stopped by a cycle cop and when they get the chance to knock him out they do. They then take him and put him under the tires of the big rig and {pretty violent for back then} back up over him. A young chuck Conners, Ralph Meeker and Keenan Wynn make this a must see for biker, crime and film noir fans. I believe Ted Turner owns this movie and I wish he would release it on video. Enjoy the film if you can ever see it.\n\nTribute to the Cop on the Cycle\n\nAuthor: kidboots from Australia\n\n14 February 2013\n\n*** This review may contain spoilers ***\n\nBy 1953 Hollywood’s biggest threat was television, much like radio had been in the twenties. Films were coming up with different gimmicks, like 3D and widescreen ie Vista Vision etc but television came up with some interesting ideas as well, like the proliferation of realistic police shows such as “Dragnet” (which actually was developed from the noir movie “He Walked By Night”). It seemed that every crime division had a series – “Racket Squad”, “Federal Men”, “Decoy” had Beverly Garland as an undercover cop and there was even a “Code 3” series which was a nitty gritty show on police procedure that producers hoped would compete with “Dragnet” – but it didn’t.\n\nThis movie starts with some graphic scenes of the aftermath of crashes, some statistics and some grim commentary – “this woman was on her way to the beauty parlour – she won’t be so beautiful now”, then the titles come up, trying to fool the cinema audience into thinking that they were watching a movie length “Dragnet” – but they were not fooled for long. This film was a tribute to the motorcycle cop and after 20 minutes showing the basic training of the rookie cop, it soon got bogged down in their personal lives – until the last 20 minutes. There are three buddies, Russ Hartley (Robert Horton), happily married but who can’t bring himself to tell his wife he has applied for motor cycle duty, Harry Whenlon (Jeff Richards) whose father was killed in the line of duty and O’Flair (Ralph Meeker) a wise guy and skirt chaser. Keenan Wynn plays tough but fair Jumbo Culdane who can see O’Flair has the makings of a good cop.\n\nIt takes the death of Whenlon for O’Flair to come to his senses and the last part of the film has all the action as he tracks down and follows the cattle truck to it’s destination. There are a couple of realistic fights and a shoot out all played out around a vat of quick lime. William Campbell, billed as “the killer” is not so lucky – he is one of the first to go. There is a pretty cheesy ending as luscious Elaine Stewart, whose performance in the film should have been a kick start to better things, promises to visit O’Flair in hospital again, but two seconds later he proves he has not lost his sleazy ways as he quickly chats up a nurse.\n\nSally Forrest, who had the very thankless role of Mary, Hartley’s wife, was a discovery of Ida Lupino’s and proved she was up to the high dramatic performances in some of Ida’s ground breaking films. However when Ida stopped directing, Sally became just another pretty leading lady and “Code Two” was the beginning of the end. The rest of the cast was made up of actors who would make their own name in TV (Robert Horton, Chuck Connors in a bit part) and James Craig, probably hoping this would lead to a comeback.\n\nWith his easy going style (usually hiding psychotic tendencies) and his natural acting, it was hard to believe Ralph Meeker was not a film veteran when he made this. He was a stage veteran though and went on to star in the Broadway production of “Picnic”. I always thought he was the perfect “Alfred Hitchcock Presents” leading man, starring in the very first episode “Revenge”.\n\nBetter than you would Think\n\nAuthor: gordonl56 from Canada\n\n24 November 2013\n\n*** This review may contain spoilers ***\n\nCODE TWO – 1953\n\nA somewhat bottom end, for MGM Studios, that is, tale of three rookie cops who join, The Los Angeles Police Department. The three, Ralph Meeker, Robert Horton and Jeff Richards become friends as they work their way through the training.\n\nMeeker is the cocky one who can’t wait to see some action. Horton is married with a young son. Richards joined because his father had been killed in the line of duty on the force.\n\nIn charge of rookie training is, Lt. James Craig and Sgt Keenan Wynn. The smart arse, Meeker is nearly washed out the first week for not being a “team player”. Wynn however sees something under all the bravado and gives him a second chance. The three make it through basic and are sworn in as L.A. Police Officers.\n\nThey are all assigned to various mundane tasks such as stock taking, school crossing guard etc. This is rather boring and they really what to get to the rough and ready action. All three volunteer for the motorcycle unit. This means more cash, a fancy uniform and out of the office time. That is after several more weeks of training.\n\nMeeker and Richards both take a shine to Horton’s sister in-law, Elaine Stewart. Meeker hound dogs her while Richards is more laid back. Stewart eventually picks Richards and they become an item.\n\nThe trio of rookies all pass the course and get assigned to traffic duty. Traffic stops and accident calls fill their day. Meeker fills his date book with numbers from the tickets he hands out to pretty girls. This happy life ends when Richards pulls over a truck one night for running a stop sign. The driver, Jonathan Cott and his passenger, William Campbell have a truckload of hot cattle. They truck cattle stolen from small ranches etc to an out of town slaughterhouse. The cattle are good for $275 a head. Campbell belts Richards across the back of the head with a monkey wrench. He then backs the truck up over Richards a few times. Then they drive off into the night.\n\nMeeker and Horton take the murder of their friend hard and ask for special duty in the hunt for the killers. They cruise throughout L.A. looking for the truck a witness saw.\n\nThe pair of officers pull over every truck that even remotely looks like the suspect vehicle. No joy there, so they go plainclothes on disguised motorcycles. One evening, Meeker lucks onto the right truck and trails it. The two in the truck cab, driver Cott and his buddy, Campbell, manage to shake Meeker off their tail.\n\nMeeker quickly realizes he has lost the truck and backtracks. He follows a small dirt rode off the highway and spots the truck. It is offloading some cattle at a small slaughterhouse. Meeker hides his bike in the brush and heads in for a closer look see.\n\nHe sees all he needs to and is about to head back to his bike to radio for backup, when he is discovered by Campbell and company. Meeker manages to get in a couple of punches and then draw his revolver. Shots are exchanged with Campbell getting blown down for a ten count. A full-fledged, drag out fistfight between Cott and Meeker is needed before Meeker can get away.\n\nMeeker hotfoots it to his bike and calls for some pronto type help. Horton, Keenan Wynn and several carloads of LA’s finest, arrive in the best tradition of the cavalry to save the day.\n\nAll the bad guys are rounded up and their operation closed down.\n\nThis one starts out like a recruitment film for the L.A. Police Department. It does change pace at about the 35 minute mark and goes quickly from first, to fourth gear. It then plays out for the next 35 like a fast paced cops and robbers film of the 40’s.\n\nI must admit I was not expecting much from the film but was pleased with the bang-up ending. The shootout and fight in the darkened slaughterhouse is handled very well. It was interesting to see an unbilled Chuck Connors (RIFLEMAN) with a small bit as a LA cop. Running for only 69 minutes, it does not overstay its welcome.\n\nThe director of this quickie was Fred M Wilcox. Wilcox only made 10 films of which LASSIE COME HOME and FORBIDDEN PLANET would be the best known. The d of p was Ray June. June, a long time MGM hand, worked mainly on comedy features. Some of these include, I DOOD IT, A SOUTHERN YANKEE, CALLOWAY WENT THAT AWAY, HOUSEBOAT and THE COURT JESTER. He did touch on film noir with SHADOW ON THE WALL.\n\nThis comedy/drama from the olden days has quite a bit to recommend it.Young rube from Indiana moves to New York City,loses all his money,falls in love with a chorus girl(Joan Blondell),and attends a wild hotel party where the bathtub gin is flowing freely,all in the space of about 48 hours!Some interesting cinematography and that great 30’s rapid-fire dialogue which seems to be a lost art these days.Joan Blondell has a very funny scene at a speakeasy craps table.Humphrey Bogart,who was still a starving actor himself at the time,appears briefly in an uncredited role,and as in most of his early roles,has that one moment of unleashed anger that served him so well in later years.Lots of fun.\n\nNew York Licked Me Once”\n\nAuthor: bkoganbing from Buffalo, New York\n\n29 September 2008\n\nHumphrey Bogart’s first appearance in Warner Brothers picture was in a small featured role in Big City Blues which starred Eric Linden and Joan Blondell. It’s the story of a young kid from Hoopersville, Indiana who comes to the New York City to seek fame and fortune and gets a great deal less than he bargained for.\n\nLinden plays our young man fresh off the farm and the first Linden does is look up cousin Walter Catlett who is playing the usual Walter Catlett sharpie. I do love the way Catlett keeps opening his wallet and to his amazement can’t seem to find any money there. He latches on to Linden the way a political ‘consultant’ latches on to a spendthrift candidate.\n\nOf course Linden’s arrival in the Big Apple is cause for a party which means bootleg booze, chorus girls, and some dance music. Catlett takes the liberty and Linden’s money and room to throw a party so Eric can presumably meet some of the ‘important’ people Catlett knows. Among the guests are Joan Blondell and a bevy of her chorus girl friends.\n\nBut things go terribly wrong and one of the girls, Josephine Dunn, winds up dead. When that happens the guests scatter with Catlett the first out the door and Blondell the last, leaving poor Linden holding the bag. Of course Linden panics and spends the next day a fugitive looking for Blondell.\n\nMervyn LeRoy directs Big City Blues at a sprightly pace and when you’ve got players like Blondell, Bogey, Catlett, and most of all Guy Kibbee playing an oaf of a house detective you know the film will be entertaining. In fact down the cast list you’ve got Herman Bing as a waiter, Lyle Talbot as another party guest, J. Carrol Naish as the supplying bootlegger, and Dennis O’Keefe in a small bit in a crap game and more besides, you’re in for a real treat if you’re like me, a big fan of the days when all these faces ruled films. Dick Powell is heard only as a radio announcer.\n\nKibbee by the way turns out to be the hero of the film, but you have to see it to see how he accomplishes that. And of course you have to see what happens to naive young Eric Linden.\n\nSome nice blue cracks in this before the Code film pepper Big City Blues throughout the running time. Although one very big screen legend was in the cast, the film is actually a real salute to some of the great character players the movies ever had.\n\nTerrific pre-Code drama\n\nAuthor: John Seal from Oakland CA\n\n8 December 2002\n\nBig City Blues is a marvelous reminder of the vibrancy of American cinema in the early sound days. Directed by the always reliable Mervyn LeRoy, the film features uncredited performances by a wonderful cast, including Humphrey Bogart, Lyle Talbot, Dennis O’Keefe, Dick Powell (hilarious as the voice of a radio ad-man expounding on the virtues of Yum Yum brand popcorn), and Clarence Muse (who delivers some terrific singing in a speakeasy scene), as well as Joan Blondell as the brassy showgirl with a heart of gold, Eric Linden as a smalltown rube, and especially Walter Catlett as Linden’s Cousin Gibby, who’s responsible for most of the trouble that takes place. Written by Lillie Hayward, the script is hilarious, intelligent, and insightful, especially when it pokes fun at the peccadilloes of big city life. Bogart has a particularly juicy line when, reading from a newspaper, he informs partygoers that the police have recently picked up a criminal with “a handgun in one pocket and a lipstick and powderpuff in the other”! The same party sequence also features the sight of a nervous young lady reading from the infamous (and much censored) lesbian novel “The Well of Loneliness” by Radclyffe Hall. In short, this is a fine example of pre-Code filmmaking and should be of interest to all fans of 30s cinema.\n\nThe New York Experience\n\nAuthor: lugonian from Kissimmee, Florida\n\n5 March 2006\n\nBIG CITY BLUES (Warner Brothers, 1932), directed by Mervyn LeRoy, is a Depression era melodrama without the focus on the unemployed in breadlines or the homeless struggling to survive, but a cliché story about the survival of a country boy who ventures to the big city, the “Big Apple,” better known as New York. Starring Joan Blondell, her role is actually secondary but crucial to the plot, while the Eric Linden, whose name comes below hers, is the central focus.\n\nThe story revolves around Buddy Reeves (Eric Linden), a naive country boy from Hoopersville, Indiana. After inheriting $1100, he decides to fulfill his dream by coming to live in the greatest city in the world, New York. Unable to take his dog, Duke, with him, Buddy offers the pooch to a Willow Junction station master (Grant Mitchell), who accepts the animal only as a loan, knowing full well, that he will do exactly what he did as a youth, by venturing to the big city only to return home disillusioned. However, Buddy believes different, especially since he only has a one way ticket. Upon his arrival at Grand Central Station, Buddy, as he carries his suitcases, strolls down with amazement the busy streets surrounded by the “rush, tension and crowds.” He registers at the Hotel Hercules, room 3663, where his Cousin Gibbony (Walter Catlett) enters the scene to teach him the ropes in becoming a true New Yorker as well as fast-talking his way in acquiring some of his money. Gibbony, a comedic con-artist who claims to know the most important people in town, ranging from Mayor Jimmy Walker to actress Constance Bennett, arranges for the young lad to be introduced to a handful of his friends by having an all night party to take place in Buddy’s hotel room. That evening, Buddy becomes infatuated with an attractive show girl named Vida Fleet (Joan Blondell).\n\nDuring this very active party, which consists of radio background music to current hit tunes as “My baby Just Cares for Me,” Lem Sully (Lyle Talbot), actor and drunk, along with globetrotter Shep Atkins (Humphrey Bogart) get into an argument over the drunken Jackie DeVoe (Josephine Dunn), a Follies girl. A physical fight ensues, leading to a whiskey bottle being thrown across the room, hitting the head of Jackie, causing her death. Suddenly the room is quiet. All the guests make a hasty departure, especially Vida, leaving Buddy to be faced with a possible murder charge. Breaking away as Hummell, the house detective (Guy Kibbee) enters to discover the body, Buddy hides amongst the crowded city, hoping to avoid being arrested by Quelkin (Thomas Jackson) of the homicide squad, who is hot on his trail.\n\nOthers in the cast consist of Inez Courtney as Faun; Ned Sparks as Stackhouse; Jobyna Howland (in her Marjorie Rambeau-type performance) as Mrs. Cartlidge, the 55 Club speakeasy “madame”, along with interesting assortment of notable actors assuming no screen credit, including Josephine Dunn (Al Jolson’s co-star in 1928’s THE SINGING FOOL); J. Carroll Naish as a bootlegger; Herman Bing as a German waiter; Clarence Muse as the black singing waiter vocalizing “Every Day Can Be a Sunday”; and the heard but not seen Dick Powell as the radio announcer advertising Yum Yum Popcorn.\n\nEric Linden is ideally cast as naive but vulnerable young lad, along with Blondell in her usual street smart, tough but loyal girlfriend performance. They would be reunited once more in race-car drama, THE CROWD ROARS (1932) starring James Cagney. Of the supporting players, it is Walter Catlett sporting glasses, derby and cigar (a cross between comedians Groucho Marx and Robert Woolsey), the scene stealer who livens things up.\n\nWith so much happening during its brisk and brief 65 minutes, BIG CITY BLUES moves as quickly as any speeding cars or pedestrians depicted on screen. Along with other then current New York sounding film titles, MANHATTAN PARADE (1931), CENTRAL PARK (1932), 42nd STREET (1933), just to name a few, no other movie studio like Warners captures the feel and essence of New York City life, and BIG CITY BLUES is no exception. Not as well known as the more famous New York movies of this period, it’s worth catching whenever presented during the late night hours on Turner Classic Movies.(**1/2)\n\nAn ex-con who wants to go straight has difficulties trying to reintegrate into society while on parole.\n\nWilliam Holden at 22\n\nSomehow at the age of 22, William Holden looked like a better-looking Tom Hanks. And I’ll bet there are a lot of people who could sit through “Invisible Stripes” and not know it was William Holden.\n\n“Invisible Stripes” stars George Raft, Humphrey Bogart, William Holden, and Jane Bryan.\n\nGeorge Raft plays Cliff Taylor who, once released from prison, decides to stay on the straight and narrow. His pal, Chuck Martin (Bogart) has no such intentions. Cliff, who has a brother (Holden) and a mother (Fay Robson) finds the going tough, unable to get a job he can keep for various reasons, usually someone making trouble for him. His kindly parole officer encourages him to keep trying. With his brother Tim wanting to marry his girlfriend Peggy, and the job situation, Cliff decides to go in with Chuck’s group.\n\nPretty good gangster flick, with Bogart, not long before his breakout role in High Sierra, giving the strongest performance. Raft is playing a good guy so he doesn’t demonstrate a lot of bite. The film has some exciting scenes, particularly toward the end.\n\nHolden, as stated above, is just a kid but does a good job as a man in love who wants to give his girlfriend the world, if only he had some money. It would be 11 years before he made his mark in “Sunset Boulevard” and became a true superstar.\n\nAs an aside, Jane Bryan retired to marry Justin Dart, who took over Rexall Drug chain. She died in 2009 at the age of 91.\n\nIn many ways a typical Warner Brothers gangster film, but a good one.\n\nYou think changin’ your uniform means anything, you’ll still be wearin’ stripes. You may not be able to see ’em, but they’ll be there alright.”\n\nAuthor: classicsoncall from Florida, New York\n\n9 January 2005\n\nGeorge Raft and an unrecognizably young William Holden are top billed as brothers Cliff and Tim Taylor in this 1939 gangster genre film that has both brothers skirting opposite sides of the law as they try to make a life for themselves.\n\nThe story opens with Cliff Taylor and fellow Sing Sing inmate Chuck Martin (Humphrey Bogart) about to leave prison with their sentences completed. Taylor is determined to go straight, Martin can’t wait to get back to his criminal life. As Cliff tries to settle back into his former life with his family, events conspire against him making it difficult to stay on the straight and narrow. Additional pressure comes from brother Tim, who wants to make a better life for himself and fiancée Peggy (Jane Bryan), but earning twenty dollars a week as a mechanic makes him fantasize about “taking what he wants”.\n\nThe film see-saws it’s way back and forth for Cliff, who alternately tries to play it straight and then gets mixed up with Martin’s gangster pals. In that regard, George Raft really gets to portray a con man, hiding his involvement from Tim and his mother (Flora Robson), until events spiral out of control during a botched robbery attempt by Martin’s gang.\n\nIf you’re into film nuances, this one offers a number of treats. For starters, there’s the scene where Bogey’s character Martin is shown coming out of a movie theater with his blonde girlfriend Molly (Lee Patrick); the film that’s playing – 1939’s “You Can’t Get Away With Murder”, starring Humphrey Bogart! Speaking of Molly, she’s almost a dead ringer look alike for Bette Davis, making me do a couple of double takes. And then there’s the brief uncredited appearance of Dead Ender Leo Gorcey as the head stock boy for a general store where Cliff briefly finds a job.\n\nI found myself enjoying this film, even if uneven at times. George Raft and Humphrey Bogart went on to make one more film together in 1940’s “They Drive By Night”, where they share equal billing as brothers involved in wildcat trucking, one might call them brother truckers.\n\nFor it’s own part, “Invisible Stripes” may be hard to come by, not available as a studio release, but many of these Warner Brothers films find their way onto classic movie TV channels like TCM or are available through specialty video houses. This one would be well worth your time, especially if you’re a fan of Raft, Bogey, Holden or the gangster genre itself.\n\nFun & Entertaining\n\nAuthor: boscofl from United States\n\n11 November 2008\n\n“Invisible Stripes” is by no means a great film but I enjoy the heck out of it. Any crime picture that has George Raft and Humphrey Bogart is going to be worth a look. Here they play two cons: Raft planning to go straight and provide for his Mom and kid brother while Bogey returns to his criminal ways. There are so many interesting angles to this picture for true film buffs. First, Raft’s younger brother is played by 21 year old William Holden in his second film. Watching him in this it is amazing he made many more; he is pretty whiny and forgettable as the hotheaded sibling. The great British actress Flora Robson plays their mother in a colossal bit of miscasting but since her role is minimal she retains her dignity (although some of the lovey-dovey exchanges with her movie son Raft are borderline incestuous). Bogey is his typical brilliant self and easily walks off with the picture. While he is continuing his cycle of bad-guy supporting roles his character is not without some redeeming features. Cast as his moll is Lee Patrick; the two would combine again in a couple of years as Sam Spade & Effie Perrine in “The Maltese Falcon.” Another interesting footnote in the film is the brief appearance of Leo Gorcey as a department store clerk.\n\nAnd finally I come to the star, George Raft. He has gained a reputation as a mercilessly wooden performer and some of it is deserved. I have always liked him and find this performance relatively solid; he is acted off the screen by Bogart in their scenes together and his one shot at emoting over his plight as an ex-con is comical but in the overall he is very likable. This is the kind of role Raft wanted to play: the tough guy who is good to his Ma, loyal to his friends, and possessing a strict code of ethics. Despite turning down nearly every role that made Bogart a star, Raft’s brief career at Warners represents his best work.\n\nIf you are a fan of old Warners crime pictures you will have a good time with “Invisible Stripes.”\n\nCritical reaction\n\nTime Out Film Guide calls Invisible Stripes “A thoroughly predictable tale of the tribulations of an ex-con.” A New York Times review from 1940 commented about the unusual lack of prison scenes in the movie. “Let us hasten in all gratitude to add that “Invisible Stripes” is a prison picture in which the stripes are much less visible than usual, most of the action being paroled to the outside in the capable custody of George Raft, Jane Bryan, William Holden and Humphrey Bogart. There are no jute mill scenes, no bullying guards, no big prison break sequence; in fact, we don’t understand why they’ve suddenly commuted our sentence from the customary duration of the picture to a brief prison prelude, a mere graduating exercise at the beginning: good behavior, maybe.”\n\nIt’s a last film by “First National” productions were actually made under Warner Bros. control, even though the two companies continued to retain separate identities until the mid-1930’s, pre-1960 after which time “A Warner Bros.-First National Picture”.\n\nUnable to go Straight\n\nAuthor: bkoganbing from Buffalo, New York\n\n28 August 2005\n\nGeorge Raft and Humphrey Bogart after a stretch in prison are getting out together. Raft is going to make a go of the straight life, but Bogart just wants to get back to being a criminal.\n\nRaft makes a try at it, but the fact he’s an ex-con is continually being held against him. Eventually he rejoins the old gang, but keeps it a secret from mother Flora Robson and brother William Holden.\n\nHolden in the mean time is barely keeping his financial head above water at the gas station he works at. He’s thinking real hard himself that brother Raft might have the right idea. All this is most distressing to Flora Robson and his fiancé, Jane Bryan.\n\nAt Warner Brothers, it’s all been done before, the players slip comfortably into roles that are very familiar to them.\n\nGeorge Raft, a guy with limited skills was always believable in the urban criminal milieu because of who he hung out with. From Owney Madden to Meyer Lansky and most importantly Bugsy Siegel, Raft inhabited the wise guy world and basically was what you saw on the screen. Please recall Warren Beatty’s film Bugsy which was spot on about Raft’s relationship with him.\n\nIt’s interesting to speculate that if Raft had been at Warner Brothers from the beginning of his career instead of Paramount what path it might have taken. The best gangster flicks were done by the Brothers Warner, but by 1939 with their stable of gangster stars established, Raft is like a spare tire there.\n\nThis was Bill Holden’s second film and his joint contract holders of Paramount and Columbia lent him out here. He’s playing the callow youth parts he specialized in before Sunset Boulevard. ‘Smiling Jim’ roles was what Holden disparagingly called these parts. It is rumored that Holden is also one of the extras in the prison yard in the James Cagney-George Raft film Each Dawn I Die. I’ve never been able to spot him though.\n\nFlora Robson’s one great actress, her talents allowing her to play a slum mother and Queen Elizabeth the first. Some critics say she’s wasted here and maybe she is, but one of her better later roles is as Mrs. Gonzo, the Maltese mother in Alec Guinness’s The Malta Story. Very similar part.\n\nJane Bryan’s career was cut short all too soon, but not with tragedy, far from it. Shortly after this Bryan married Rexall Drug founder Justin Dart. She concentrated on the wife and mother thing and she was the wife of one of America’s wealthiest citizens. Later on she had a hand in convincing her husband to back another of her former Warner Brothers contract players in a political career and lived to see Ronald Reagan become our 40th president.\n\nBoth Bill Holden and Humphrey Bogart would feud legendarily on the set of Sabrina in the Fifties. No hint of their future troubles here in Invisible Stripes. Bogart’s done it all before at Warner Brothers. George Raft helped Bogey in his career by shortly turning down High Sierra, The Maltese Falcon and later Casablanca.\n\nFans of all the players mentioned here including myself will enjoy this film which admittedly won’t rank in the top 10 of any of their credits.\n\nThe split that has occurred in their lives is a fissure created by the oldest trick in the female armoury and it has led to Edith leading a life verging on penury, with repossession just a month away. As her bartender regales her beau, Sergeant Jim Hobbson (Karl Malden), “Edie’s a soft touch. And a soft touch is a bad risk.” She threatens to blackmail Margaret and plants a suicide note, shooting her sister in the temple, immediately assuming her identity, leaving Margaret-as-Edith dressed down in her apartment above the bar, departing with the chauffeur who led her to uncover the secrets of Margaret’s double life in the first place. She enters the life of riches stolen from her by a woman whose life is based on a lie. Now she must live one herself. Appearance is everything and Margaret must be Edith –Margaret would never go bare-legged and certainly not die in those awful shoes.\n\nEdith-as-Margaret is visited by the police in order to identify her own body in the morgue. She has to adjust to a life of wealth –with a regular gathering of morbid friends reminiscent of Gloria Swanson’s deathly coven in ??Sunset Blvd. ?? (1950, Wilder) who meet for religion and board games; she must befriend the Great Dane, Duke (who takes to her immediately, having hated his late mistress); she has to figure out the combination to the bedroom safe; and Margaret’s signature being beyond her entirely, she injures her signing hand with a hot poker rather than give herself away to the family lawyer. Then she discovers that Frank left her (Edith) $50,000. When Hobbson visits her with a framed dollar bill commemorating the opening of Edie’s Bar on Figueroa in 1957 she declares, “My sister was very fortunate in having a man who so loved her,” and hands it back to him. She knows now what she has lost.\n\nLike Kate Bosworth, once Edith assumes her sister’s place in the realm of fashion and glamour, she finds the unforeseen and unwelcome encumbrance of a man, this time a gigolo, Tony Collins (Peter Lawford), who soon figures out the truth and holds her secret to ransom in exchange for not giving her up. “You’re not yourself!” he declares. And, once again Davis, ostensibly the good twin (if now a murderess) is undone by the family dog (who savages the rotten Tony to death) and the dogged intentions of Hobbson, the near-retiree who pursues his beloved to the gas chamber via the mechanism of investigation, evidence and animal instinct – because Margaret and Tony poisoned Frank with arsenic.\n\nDespite Edith’s loud protestations of innocence, her performance as Margaret is all too convincing and he rubbishes her claims that she is her identical twin, although the butler knew all along. Morally, of course, she is right and the sick irony of her action is all too clear to her. After the judge pronounces sentence Jim asks her if what she said was true but he doesn’t believe her and at the end, she takes her punishment like a man. In the film’s nod to Psycho (1960, Hitchcock), her final line to Jim is “I’m Margaret. You’re right, Edie wouldn’t have hurt a fly.” Frank’s portrait on the stairwell – the other Gothic trope in the narrative – has had a devastating effect.\n\nTo interrogate Bette Davis’ twin roles –and as we have seen, there were many of them, although in fact she only made two films in which she played actual twins– is to emphasise the sense of metatextuality about her entire career. She played actresses, real and imaginary; rewarded for incarnating Jeanne Eagels and then, career-wise, she re-vamped herself as Margo Channing in an imitation of Tallulah Bankhead, whose stage role of Southern Gothic monster Regina she had already re-imagined in The Little Foxes. She played mother and aunt to the same girl in The Old Maid.\n\nShe pretended to be mother to a disturbed child after herself recovering from a mental illness caused by her own mother to a little girl whose mother is also mentally ill in Now, Voyager. She played a gloss on Joan Crawford in The Star in a script that was really a mirror of her own life and then found herself paired with her sexual nemesis (they had Franchot Tone in common) in yet another brilliant phase of her career in Baby Jane? She retrieved control of her career only to be constantly given roles unworthy of her talent by Jack Warner whilst simultaneously having her debts against the studio forgiven by a marker he never collected and her salary kept at unfeasibly low levels compared with male stars whose grosses she easily outstripped. Her career could be said to have been of two halves, demarcated by the classic All About Eve, a film which paradoxically consigned her rapidly outmoded acting style to the tip of camp whilst appearing to deny the desire for independence her characters had declared in virtually every other role she had played in her career to date. Her body of work boasts an array of roles confected in double lives and the re-invention of banal existences. A Stolen Life was a remake of an existing film itself, a novelistic adaptation and a dramatic masque of Bette Davis’ selves at that time – her sexual antics unleashed after a virginal first marriage previously hidden by a sometimes straitlaced and temperamental alter ego which she attributed to her Puritan upbringing; her fight to play more complex roles sometimes deadened by Warner Bros’ marketing strategies; her decision to go on unpaid suspension rather than take roles that were beneath her abilities; her public image a strategic combination of fact and fiction, a mélange of her onscreen roles and her colourful private life.\n\nDead Ringer seemed to emphatically reinforce her own contemporary financial situation following divorce and family traumas – the one twin happy, duplicitous and wealthy, the other man-dependent and somewhat impoverished (if rich in her talent for finding the right man – who unfortunately has her sent to her death because he is righteous and lawful: justice is sadly not the equal of the law, as in movies, so in life.) It followed Baby Jane? in its reflection of the older Hollywood actress’ experience of a mordant existence lived out behind closed automatic gates with gigolos in attendance in a dayglo Los Angeles Gothic.\n\nThese were aspects of the Davis experience: she had a habit of drawing young gay men to her and convinced herself that she could turn them through marriage. It often took friends and family to persuade her otherwise. Dead Ringer could, then, be read as a reflection upon that characteristic ambivalence towards her own life and career: what might have been and what might yet come to pass (if only one had the right amount of money and the perfect man, provided he didn’t ask too many questions and saw one in just the right amount of shadow.) Her later films basically embellished the idea of sadomasochism that had threaded through the oeuvre since she began being off cast –if she never quite fitted the grade of cast-off. In the examination of any body of work by an artist, there is an echo-chamber of resonance, of art resembling life resembling performance, of a series of writers taking cues from previous writers’ work and, undoubtedly influenced by the actor’s idiosyncrasies and marshalled by their successful onscreen types, creating more and more of the same types, bigger, more emotional, infinitely crazed and overly dramatic, enhanced by audience polling, advertising and marketing strategies, the one feeding necrophiliac-fashion off the other, yet sympathetic to the last.\n\nDavis’ career was an accordion of role-playing and confusion, an expression of insatiable appetite and canny choices, an array of diverse and dazzling technique and puzzling ambiguity, her disarming honesty coupled with cast-iron wit. In life her performance could always eclipse her reality, creating a counterfeit self to detract attention from the real thing. The original was always so much better than the copies. That’s what remains so magical about Bette Davis: she was always acting. You could never tell her apart."
