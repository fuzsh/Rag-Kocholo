        "text": "Army Rangers take on some of the most advanced and rigorous training in the Army. To become a Ranger, you’ll first be tested in the Ranger Assessment and Selection Program (RASP)—a two-phase program to test your abilities and train you to become an Army Ranger. Following RASP, you can volunteer to go through Ranger School, known as one of the toughest training experiences in the Army.\n\nIn Phase 1, you’ll go through physical and psychological tests, as well as be assessed on your strength of character and leadership skills. This phase includes a 12-mile ruck march with a 35-pound dry rucksack in full uniform, land navigation exercises, and medical first responder tests.\n\nRanger School is completely voluntary, but necessary to lead in the 75th Ranger Regiment. If you choose to attend, you’ll spend the first 20 days preparing your mind and body for the rest of Ranger School. The next 21 days are spent in the mountains learning combat patrol missions. In the final phase of Ranger School, you’ll lead small teams to conduct missions in swamps while under extreme stress.\n\nYes. After completing Basic Combat Training (BCT) and Advanced Individual Training (AIT), Soldiers interested in becoming a part of the 75th Ranger Regiment can be screened for the first step of becoming an Army Ranger: Ranger Assessment and Selection (RASP).\n\nRangers are role-model Soldiers physically, mentally, and morally. They make sound judgments, and they never quit, though their bodies may tell them to. Rangers demonstrate discipline both on and off duty.\n\nWhen Rangers are not deployed, they intensely focus on physical fitness and individual training to be ready to deploy at any minute. Otherwise, life on base is similar to any typical Army unit. Additionally, Rangers have excellent Soldier & Family Readiness Groups, providing routine updates about deployments and training exercises, and providing support for challenges related to deployment. Rangers are stationed in one of three bases in the United States: Fort Moore, Hunter Army Airfield, and Joint Base Lewis McChord.\n\nYes. Non-commissioned Officers (NCOs) and Warrant Officers, at ranks of staff sergeant and above, are encouraged to apply. If accepted, they’ll attend RASP 2, a three-week selection course where Officer candidates (including commissioned Officers) are tested on their physical and mental capabilities while learning the special tactics, techniques, and procedures that set the regiment apart, as well as the expectations of leading and developing young Rangers.\n\nWhile the modern 75th Ranger Regiment was established relatively recently, U.S. military units with the same operational philosophy as the Rangers have existed since before the American Revolution. After the attack against the U.S. on September 11, 2001, the 75th Ranger Regiment immediately prepared to “Lead the Way,” spearheading the initial ground invasion of Afghanistan, just as the Rangers did at Normandy in 1944, Grenada in 1983, and Panama in 1989. The Rangers’ iconic motto “Rangers, Lead the Way!” was coined during the Allied invasion of Normandy."
