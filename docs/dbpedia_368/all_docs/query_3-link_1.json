SmithColor processBlack and whiteDistributed byMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer\n\nRelease date\n\nRunning time\n\n69 minutesCountryUnited StatesLanguageEnglishBudget$472,000[1]Box office$711,000[1]\n\nCode Two is a 1953 American film noir crime film about men training to be motorcycle cops. It stars Ralph Meeker, Sally Forrest, Elaine Stewart, Robert Horton, and Keenan Wynn, and was directed by Fred M. Wilcox.\n\nClassmates at the Los Angeles police academy, Chuck O'Fair, Russ Hartley and Harry Whenlon bond as friends. When they socialize at one's house, Russ and his wife, Mary, observe as the extroverted Chuck expresses an interest in Mary's sister, Jane, who seems to prefer the shy Harry instead.\n\nThe three rookie cops become bored on the job. Seeking more action and excitement, they perk up after hearing from Sgt. Jumbo Culdane about the police department's motorcycle squad. Mary is skeptical, fearing for Russ's safety, but all three take the necessary training and are assigned to the motorcycle highway patrol.\n\nWhile chasing a truck together, Chuck's cycle stalls so Harry proceeds by himself. He is knocked cold by one of the men in the truck, which then backs over him. Chuck is devastated by Harry's death and persuades his superiors to let him work undercover to find the culprits.\n\nDiscovering that the men he's looking for are modern cattle rustlers, Chuck confronts them and kills one before he is wounded. The other is taken into custody, and Chuck and Russ soon go back to work.\n\nRalph Meeker as Chuck\n\nRobert Horton as Russ\n\nSally Forrest as Mary\n\nJeff Richards as Harry\n\nElaine Stewart as Jane\n\nKeenan Wynn as Jumbo\n\nRobert Burton as Police Capt.
