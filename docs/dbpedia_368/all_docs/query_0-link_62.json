Horror in the comedy ﬁlm? It seems like a strange combination; one moment a scream, the next moment a laugh. And yet comedy and horror are not strange bedfellows at all. They’ve been around almost as long as movies themselves. As one who grew up reading such periodicals as Famous Monsters of Filmland (although its editor, the legendary Forrest J Ackerman, once admonished me to “never grow up”), I’ve subsequently read hundreds of tomes written about horror ﬁlms as metaphors, full of dark sexual symbolism, of how they can be sexist and misogynistic and may make the viewer insensitive to violence. I’ve read endless treatises on how horror ﬁlms can corrupt the young and, conversely, how they can be cathartic escape valves for our darkest impulses. But I’ve never read a book that related the history of the comedy-horror ﬁlm, that bastardization of unease and chuckles that has alternately delighted and frightened audiences from the days of silent ﬁlms such as The Bat on up to such recent hits as Scary Movie. It seems as though ﬁlm scholars love to get lofty about subtext, but the idea of humor combined with horror ... well, it seems to frighten them. This book attempts to correct that oversight, and also attempts to explore just why we like gallows humor. What is it in the human condition that makes us want to laugh at the darkness around us, especially when things in the real world seem to be at their worst? This book is a chronological look at comedy-horror ﬁlms, a decade by decade examination of the best (and worst) examples of the genre. The (arguably) most important ﬁlms are covered in-depth, and there are two appendices with credits, American release dates and other particulars of over 200 comedy-horror feature ﬁlms from 1914 to 2008, as well as selected short subjects, including cartoons. Needless to say, a tremendous amount of research has to go into a book of this kind, and there was much work involved, for over a year and a half, involving riﬂing through old newspaper clippings, reference books, taped radio interviews I conducted myself, and even perusals of old movie scripts at the New York State Archives. Websites, valuable tools for the researcher provided they’re cross-referenced, were important too, especially the Internet Movie DataBase (www.imdb.com). I hope this book will shed some light on the relationship between humor and horror as well as provide information to the reader about the ﬁlms themselves and the people behind them. The intention was to write a serious—though hopefully entertaining—book about a topic that rarely receives serious attention. Whether or not I’ve succeeded is up to the reader to decide.\n\n1\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nINTRODUCTION “There’s a thin line between horror and hilarity.” —Robert Bloch, author of Psycho\n\nSome people are born in one-horse towns. I was born in a Headless Horseman town. For years now—centuries, even—there’s been a feud going on between the tiny town of Kinderhook, New York (my birthplace and where I still reside), and the slightly larger town of Tarrytown, New York. It isn’t a Hatﬁeld-McCoy type of feud, but rather a literary one, and the gist of it is this: When the great American author Washington Irving wrote his classic story “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,” it was based on real places and real people. Did, in fact, the Headless Horseman ride through Kinderhook or Tarrytown? In Kinderhook, the home team plays at Ichabod Crane Central School, which has a basrelief in the school auditorium of the venerable schoolmaster being chased by the Headless Horseman. I live just down the road from the Sleepy Hollow Motel. And so on. The truth of the matter is, Irving based his characters on actual citizens of Kinderhook and placed them in the Tarrytown setting. So both towns can claim the legend. The home of the real Ichabod Crane—one Jesse Merwin by name—still stands not far from where I live. I write all this by way of introduction to explain my interest in all things both comic and horriﬁc. “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow” was the ﬁrst great comedy-horror story, and remains perhaps the best. Who could ever forget the poor lovesick schoolmaster pursued by that dreadful apparition on horseback—and who wouldn’t chuckle at the fact that it was all just a Halloween prank? Irving’s story contained the blueprint for all comedy-horror tales to follow: it made you laugh one moment and scream the next, and it was all tied neatly together with that Halloween sense of the mischievous. The ﬁlms covered in this book set out to do exactly what Irving did. Some of them succeed spectacularly and some fail miserably. Most of them fall somewhere in the middle. But all of them aim to hit you in the funny bone and at the small of your back, where your spine tingles. Gallows humor, of course, goes back a long way. Whistling past the graveyard supposedly makes one feel safer. But safe from what? A good comedy-horror ﬁlm knows what scares you: ghosts, zombies, vampires, werewolves, psycho killers, monsters of all shapes, sizes and descriptions. But comedy-horror ﬁlms give you what straight dramatic horror ﬁlms don’t: the permission to laugh at your fears, to whistle past the cinematic graveyard and feel secure in the knowledge that the monsters can’t get you. At least not until you stop whistling. Psycho author Robert Bloch once told me: “Both horror and humor require the same distorted conception of reality to be effective.” Who should know more about that subject than the creator of the very witty, but very dangerous, Norman Bates? Of course, humor and horror are both in the eye (or empty eye socket) of the beholder. 3\n\n4\n\nCOMEDY-HORROR FILMS\n\nSome people may think of Stanley Kubrick’s ﬁlm The Shining as a comedy. It certainly has some wonderfully black comedic moments (“Heeeere’s Johnny!”), but the overall effect is one of impending doom, of a journey into the labyrinth of an insane and ghoulish mind. If you ﬁnd that idea funny, then I don’t want to have a beer with you. Unintentionally humorous horror movies (and there are a lot of those) are also not under the purview of this book. Movies such as Robot Monster, for example, may make the viewer laugh at the sheer ineptitude of its special effects (a man in an ape suit with a deep sea diving helmet on his head, sometimes surrounded by soap bubbles), but it was made with such sincerity that it can’t truly be called comedy-horror. This book will not concern itself with bad movies that have been roasted on Mystery Science Theatre 3000. For that kind of irony, you must go elsewhere. Any college campus will do. And ﬁnally, there is one other sub-genre of the horror movie that won’t ﬁnd its way into these pages: the horror nudie, or T&A horror ﬁlm. There’s a New Jersey company called Pop Cinema that produces and distributes movies by the truckload with such titles as PlayMate of the Apes, Kinky Kong, Lord of the G-Strings and Spider-Babe. They usually star young actresses who are willing to disrobe at regular and frequent intervals and get into compromising positions with each other. Although these parodies are frequently quite amusing, their intention is not to tickle your funny bone, but rather to elicit a completely different response from another part of your anatomy. I think you know what I mean. Besides, writing about such ﬁlms would actually be a conﬂict of interest. I’m perfectly willing to confess to being the author of such Pop Cinema movies as Misty Mundae Mummy Raider, The Witches of Sappho Salon, Dr. Jekyll and Mistress Hyde and The Sexy Adventures of Van Helsing. I’m certainly not about to review my own screenplays. Again, if you’re looking for coverage on those particular ﬁlms, you need to look elsewhere. An Internet search engine should be your ﬁrst stop. If, on the other hand, you like to travel through old dark houses to “have a po-ta-to” with Ernest Thesiger or visit Transylvanian castles full of gay Jewish vampires with Roman Polanski, or even spend a camping holiday in the woods with Bruce Campbell and some Deadites, then this could be the book for you. It isn’t all about horror and hilarity, however. Along the way, we’ll take a look at the cultural and social signiﬁcance of comedy-horror ﬁlms in relation to the times in which they were produced. Not to be too lofty, but merely to peer under the surface to discover just why, at any given moment in history, we the audience love to be scared out of our wits while laughing out loud. Some of the movies mentioned in this book may be the source of nostalgic memories for you. Perhaps descriptions of the ones you haven’t seen will intrigue you enough to seek them out. But all of them, good, bad or indifferent, have one thing in common: they want to do what a good Halloween party does. You come into the spooky house, have a few laughs, a few scares, and then return to the real world refreshed. What could be more wonderful than that?\n\n1\n\nTHE SILENTS Unheard Punchlines and Subtitled Screams When the movies were born in the late nineteenth century, there were no “art” ﬁlms. There were really no ﬁlm genres at all; they had yet to be invented. Motion pictures were merely a new invention, a source of amusement rather like computer games were a century later. But fantasy quickly took hold of the infant cinema, and with it, darkness. It began with the ﬁlms of Frenchman Georges Méliès. But it was too early in the game to throw truly horrifying images at fans of the Nickelodeon; they had to be eased into it. As Phil Hardy points out in his groundbreaking book The Encyclopedia of Horror Movies: “Although Georges Méliès’ La Manoir du Diable (1896), with its image of the Devil as a vampire bat, is undoubtedly the ﬁrst horror ﬁlm, in atmosphere and feeling the ﬁlm is far closer to the tradition of comic fantasies in which smiling amazement, rather than terror, was the expected reaction.” Indeed, “smiling amazement” was the expected response to most fantasy-horror ﬁlms of the era; even Thomas Edison’s sixteen-minute version of Frankenstein (1910) softened its horriﬁc impact, reassuring its patrons that the ﬁlmmakers “tried to eliminate all the actually repulsive situations and to concentrate on the mystic and psychological problems that are to be found in this weird tale.” Until the release of Robert Wiene’s The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari in 1919, movie audiences seemed quite uncomfortable with horror. Although the genre had a long and even “respectable” history on the stage and in novels, it took ﬁlmgoers a while to warm up to it. The comedy-horror ﬁlm was, to a large extent, an American invention, which makes perfect sense since Irving’s “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow” is a quintessential early American tale. But much of the material for silent comedy-horror ﬁlms came from the stage rather than from literature. In 1909, a play called The Ghost Breaker was written by Paul Dickey and Charles W. Goddard. It achieved considerable success, and by 1914 there was a ﬁlm version, which is now lost, as are more than sixty percent of all silent ﬁlms. In 1922, it was remade by producer Jesse L. Lasky and director Alfred Green. This version starred Wallace Reid, Lila Lee, Walter Hiers and Alfred Carewe. It too was a rather tepid affair, according to a review in The New York Times from September 11, 1922, in which the unnamed critic wrote: While sitting through The Ghost Breaker at the Rivoli this week you will probably be bothered by the intrusive and persistent reﬂection that it could have been a great deal better than 5\n\n6\n\nCOMEDY-HORROR FILMS it is. And this is disturbing to anyone’s enjoyment of a comedy.... For the fact is that the Dickey-Goddard play offered almost boundless opportunities for fun and thrills on the screen, and they have been taken advantage of only half-way and half-heartedly.... [W]hen the picture ﬁnally does to get the business of the ghosts and the treasure it picks up a little.... So it is not a complete failure.\n\nAnd so our anonymous critic is telling us that the horror elements are much more interesting than the comedy elements in this version of The Ghost Breaker. By this time, of course, we had been through the real-life horrors of World War I and yet we, the collective audience, seemed to crave more horrors upon the screen. But we wanted them diluted with humor. We wanted to whistle past the graveyard of our loved ones, the soldiers, the victims of war. We wanted to laugh in the face of death.\n\nOne Exciting Night During the Roaring Twenties, audiences were indeed roaring at some Broadway plays that combined screams with laughter. One of the earliest shows on the Great White Way to generate fright and titters was Mary Roberts Rinehart and Avery Hopwood’s The Bat, ﬁrst staged at the Morosco Theatre in 1920. Alexander Woollcott’s review of August 24 that year was quite enthusiastic: “The Bat is a wild mystery melodrama, considerably wilder than any seen in these parts for a long time, and it is quite thoroughly interesting.... No end of fun if you let yourself go.” Apparently, a lot of people wanted to let themselves go in the twenties, as The Bat had a long and very successful run. Its success got the attention of legendary ﬁlm director D. W. Grifﬁth, who was, at this stage in his career, looking for a hit. Although Grifﬁth had made the hugely proﬁtable The Birth of a Nation in 1915, he remained a controversial ﬁgure. A movie pioneer who perfected, among other things, the technique of cross-cutting to build suspense, Grifﬁth was also very heavily criticized for the blatant racism in his 1915 epic, the ﬁrst American feature-length ﬁlm. Portraying the Ku Klux Klan as “heroes” who, in his view, restored order to the post–Reconstruction South, Grifﬁth came under ﬁre from the NAACP, who attempted (and failed) to have the ﬁlm suppressed. Grifﬁth had been a child of the South; his father was a Confederate Army colonel and Civil War hero who told the young Grifﬁth many romanticized tales of the war. These stories left a huge impression on him, and when he became a writer and director in the ﬂedgling motion picture business, he used his father’s stories as the basis for several of his ﬁlms. By all accounts a rather humorless man, Grifﬁth was also a staunch Republican, supporting Warren G. Harding, Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover. The Birth of a Nation, although highly impressive in technique, can be uncomfortable viewing today because of its derogatory depictions of black stereotypes, including scenes in which the white “heroes” kill black men to protect white women. Some say that Grifﬁth attempted to “atone” for his bigotry in his next ﬁlm, Intolerance (1916), but the damage had already been done. Although he continued to push the envelope of ﬁlm technique in such ﬁlms as Broken Blossoms (1919), Way Down East (1920) and Orphans of the Storm (1921), his ﬁlms never again achieved the kind of ﬁnancial success accorded to The Birth of a Nation. In 1920, Grifﬁth formed United Artists along with Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks. Looking for a new concept that could give his ﬁnances a shot in the arm, Grifﬁth felt that the stage success of The Bat and other “mystery melodramas” could be easily translated into big-screen box ofﬁce. Under the nom de plume of “Irene Sinclair” he\n\n1. The Silents\n\n7\n\nwrote a screenplay called The Haunted Grande. (He had at one time considered buying screen rights to The Bat, but ultimately decided to do a pastiche of it to save money.) It was intended to be a small ﬁlm by Grifﬁth’s standards, a relatively low-budget affair that would hopefully turn a tidy proﬁt. The ﬁlm’s plot is a somewhat confusing hodgepodge of comedy, mystery and melodrama. An orphan girl (Carol Dempster) born in South Africa is adopted by a Southern society woman and brought to America. Her adoptive mother arranges for her to marry the rather smarmy J. Wilson Rockmaine (Morgan Wallace), with whom she is, of course, not in love. Her affections are given enthusiastically to John Fairfax (Henry Hull, who had just played the lead in the stage production of The Cat and the Canary), who invites her, her adoptive mother and Rockmaine to stay at his country estate. Bootleggers are secretly ensconced there, however, and shortly before the guests show up, the gang’s leader is murdered. There’s also a large sum of money hidden away somewhere on the estate, as well as strange noises, mysterious apparitions (wearing masks à la The Bat) and a police investigation that seems to center on Fairfax as the prime suspect. Eventually retitled One Exciting Night, the ﬁlm was previewed and got a less-than-overwhelming audience response. Grifﬁth decided that the problem with the movie was that it lacked the usual spectacular climax that audiences had come to expect from his productions. He brought the actors back and shot a new and expensive ending involving a terrifying storm. The climactic scene is pretty effective by the standards of the time. It just so happened that Grifﬁth already had some actual hurricane footage that he had shot earlier, so he mixed it in with a storm that he created in the studio (the ﬁlm was shot in Westchester, New York, and the Bronx). The real storm and the studio storm don’t really match, but it is an exciting sequence that goes on for at least ten minutes. Pasteboard trees and outbuildings being “blown” about on wires look pretty phony today, but the entire sequence is so well-edited— a Grifﬁth trademark—that you can almost forgive its artiﬁciality. The “comedy” elements are more difﬁcult to forgive. There are three black characters, and all of them are played by white performers. The most offensive is Porter Strong as a cowardly servant who isn’t above stealing someone’s war medals and claiming them as his own. One of the most stereotypically “blackface” performances ever seen onscreen, Porter’s blatantly racist portrayal is impossible to condone, either dramatically or morally. The other actors are adequate, especially Hull, who would later achieve horror movie stardom as the Werewolf of London in (1935). When Rockmaine (Wallace) is discovered to be the murderer, it’s really no surprise. He’s all but twirled his moustache through the whole picture, and we just knew it couldn’t be the charmingly upscale Fairfax. Released on October 2, 1922, One Exciting Night was reasonably well received by audiences and critics of the time. The New York Times noted, “D. W. Grifﬁth has given himself completely and frankly to old-fashioned, hair-raising melodrama and broad comedy in [this] hilarious thriller. And don’t forget the storm. You won’t, if you see it.” However, the ﬁnal cost of the movie—mainly because of Grifﬁth’s last-minute “hurricane”—only served to put the director even further into debt. His career continued its downward spiral, and by the time the talkies came in, he was more or less ﬁnished. Nevertheless, One Exciting Night remains a pioneering comedy-horror ﬁlm. While the tone of the movie veers wildly from maudlin romance to racist humor to arch symbolism, it is, like so many of Grifﬁth’s ﬁlms, a grand experiment. Later comedy-horror ﬁlms were better at balancing the humor and scares and were certainly more sophisticated in their approach. But once again, love him or hate him, Grifﬁth paved the way.\n\n8\n\nCOMEDY-HORROR FILMS\n\nThe Headless Horseman If you read my introduction to this book (and if you didn’t, shame on you), you will know that one of my favorite stories is Washington Irving’s “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.” What you may not know is that the most authentic ﬁlmed version of the story was made in 1922. Retitled The Headless Horseman, it starred no less an American luminary of the time than Oklahoma-born humorist and actor Will Rogers as Ichabod Crane. The screenplay by its producer, Carl Stearns Clancy, is remarkably faithful to Irving’s story. There are lines in the intertitles that are directly lifted from it (such as Katrina Van Tassel saying to Ichabod Crane, “I’ve heard that you’ve read several books quite through!”). Its brief running time (the prints that survive only run about 52 minutes, barely qualifying as a feature) ensures that padding is kept to a minimum. But here’s what makes it even more authentic: Instead of ﬁlming in some Hollywood studio, this early independent production directed by silent ﬁlm veteran Edward Venturini was actually ﬁlmed on some of the real locations Irving used in his story, in and around Tarrytown, New York. The actual Dutch farmhouses, woodlands and covered bridges of the area, combined with convincing period costumes, bring Irving’s story to life in a way that has never been done since. The fact that the production company called itself the Sleepy Hollow Corporation says a great deal about the ﬁlmmakers’ intentions of staying true to the story’s setting. Crane, of course, is a rather unsympathetic character: he’s a gawky nerd who wants Katrina not for her obvious charms but for her money. A great believer in ghosts, witches and goblins, he ﬁnally gets his comeuppance from town roughneck Brom Bones, who dresses up as the Headless Horseman and frightens Ichabod away from Sleepy Hollow forever. Even though Brom (Mr. Bones?) is a bully, he is at least honest about loving Katrina and we feel little compassion for the gangly and rather pompous schoolmaster. The fact that Rogers, one of the most likable stars in movies at that time, was engaged to play such an unlikable character is a bit of irony that actually works for the ﬁlm. Cast against type, Rogers is every inch the early 19th century schoolmaster, complete with a pigtail tied with a bow. He believes that “if you spare the rod, you spoil the child,” and graphically demonstrates it in one scene in which he beats one of his students for causing a disruption in the class. Rogers is prissy and stern in the role, and while he may be a bit heavier than our usual image of the gangly Ichabod Crane, he plays the part sincerely and well. I have a feeling that Irving would have been thrilled with his performance. The rest of the cast is good too, with Lois Meredith an appealing Katrina Van Tassel and Ben Hendricks Jr. a suitably beefy and athletic Brom Bones. The ﬁlm is also beautifully shot by Ned Van Buren (a suitably early American Dutch name, that). An interesting bit of trivia is that it was the ﬁrst feature photographed on panchromatic negative ﬁlm, which was equally sensitive to every color of the spectrum. The early silents had all been shot on orthochromatic ﬁlm, which had a tendency to make blue skies and blue eyes look ﬂat white. The new panchromatic ﬁlm was perfect for shooting on location, as The Headless Horseman was, capturing moody skies and moody eyes to equally good effect. Speaking of effects, there are very few “special” ones in The Headless Horseman, but the ones that are used work very well. Director Venturini ﬁlmed the ﬁrst sequence in which we see the Horseman (actually a fantasy of Crane’s) in double exposure, making his appearance phantom-like, the way a true apparition might look. A simple effect, to be sure, and one that went all the way back to Melies, but quite effective all the same. There’s another fantasy\n\n1. The Silents\n\n9\n\nsequence (Crane imagines himself tarred and feathered by the villagers) that looks as though it may have been the only sequence actually ﬁlmed in a studio. As such, it doesn’t really match the rest of the ﬁlm, but as it’s a dream sequence anyway, it doesn’t detract from the movie either. The high point of the story—the pursuit on horseback, with the Headless Horseman nipping at Crane’s heels—is skillfully done. Rogers had been a rodeo cowboy, so his riding skills are put to perfect use in this climactic sequence. There are sweeping tracking shots (quite rare in ﬁlms of this era) and close-ups that must have been ﬁlmed from the back of a moving vehicle, showing Crane in the foreground with the Horseman close behind. The only false note is struck after Crane ﬂees the scene when he is bopped on the head by the pumpkin that the “Horseman” has hurled at him. Satisﬁed that he has successfully routed the schoolmaster, Brom Bones pops his head out of his homemade Headless Horseman costume. While it is certainly implied in Irving’s original story that the Horseman was, in fact, Brom Bones, the fact that the author really left it up to the reader to decide was a big part of the charm of the tale. Of course, American comedy-horror ﬁlms of the period generally made it quite clear that whatever supernatural manifestations you thought you had seen actually had logical explanations, and this may have been why the ﬁlmmakers decided to show that the whole thing was really just a Halloween prank. It doesn’t ruin the ﬁlm by a long shot, but this nearly deﬁnitive Headless Horseman could have done without such an obvious bit of visual exposition. Nevertheless, The Headless Horseman—released just after Halloween of 1922 by a company called the W.W. Hodkinson Corporation—remains the most faithful version of the story committed to ﬁlm; Ichabod and Mr. Toad, the 1949 omnibus ﬁlm which contains Disney’s animated version is certainly more exciting, funnier and scarier. Tim Burton’s 1999 Sleepy Hollow is much more elaborate and far more gruesome, but it’s such a free adaptation of the story that it doesn’t even qualify as comedy-horror. The Will Rogers version of The Headless Horseman is the one that Washington Irving himself would have loved, ﬁlmed as it was in his home town. And who knows? Perhaps the spirit of Irving watched the ﬁlming from the window of his house...\n\nThe Bat The Bat ﬁnally reached the screen in 1926 courtesy of director Roland West, who had just ﬁlmed Lon Chaney in The Monster. Under the headline “Productions and Players” in the New York Times of February 15, 1925, was a “preview” of The Monster: The chief attraction at the Capitol this week is called The Monster. We hear that in it there are ghostly hands that stretch forth menacingly, sliding panels through which queer faces appear, and skeletons in closets. It is a story of a mysterious disappearance. Lon Chaney, who was seen in The Hunchback of Notre Dame and He Who Gets Slapped, appears in the title role. The Monster is a surgeon whose twisted brain delights in performing strange operations upon victims lured to his sanatorium....\n\nThe Monster was one of the ﬁrst “mad doctor” movies, and again, it was based on a play (by Crane Wilbur) that had been well-received on Broadway. Although there are comedy elements in The Monster, and it’s a beautifully directed ﬁlm, West didn’t really ﬁnd his comedy-horror voice until he made the ﬁrst ﬁlm version of The Bat. Thought to be a lost ﬁlm for decades, it was ﬁnally rediscovered in the eighties and is now available on DVD. Talk about discovering hidden gems; The Bat is a beauty.\n\n10\n\nCOMEDY-HORROR FILMS\n\nOriginal poster for Alfred Green’s The Ghost Breaker (1922).\n\n1. The Silents\n\n11\n\nFirst and foremost, it’s a splendid looking ﬁlm, with set design by none other than William Cameron Menzies, who would go on to design Gone with the Wind. West’s direction keeps the 88-minute ﬁlm moving at a brisk pace, and the balance between comedy and horror is perfectly summed up by the movie’s tagline: “A laugh with every gasp!” The plot sounds simple: Masked criminal in giant bat costume terrorizes guests at old Gothic mansion. But the story becomes more and more convoluted as it goes along, with $200,000 in hidden loot, characters thought to be dead who aren’t, red herrings a-plenty, shocks wherever you turn and yocks galore. My favorite dialogue exchange is when Detective Moletti (Tullio Carminati) asks the maid (Louise Fazenda) what her full name is. She replies, “Lizzie Allen—whether I’m full or not.” The title cards really nail home the point of “a laugh with every gasp.” But the gasps are good too, particularly the close-ups of the Bat in full costume moving in on Dale Ogden (Jewel Carmen). With huge pointed ears and nasty-looking fangs, he’s a real “monster” before monster movies actually came into vogue, and his visage is one of the more memorable images of the silent era. The players are all fun to watch, with Jack Pickford as the unlikely “hero,” Eddie Gribbon as a Barney Fife–like detective, and Fazenda running all over the house screaming (silently) at every shadow. But the standout performer is Emily Fitzroy as Cornelia Van Gorder, the Agatha Christie–type mystery writer who is renting the mansion. Always calm, cool and collected, she is the one who is instrumental in ﬁnally subduing The Bat; she’s a woman of real guts and intelligence. There’s no doubt that this is one of the ﬁlms that inspired Bob Kane to create Batman (the other was the remake, The Bat Whispers, but more on that later). There’s even a sort of “bat signal” when a moth shows up in a car’s headlights, its shadow looking like a giant bat. And, of course, for better or worse, the idea of a masked killer knocking off people one by one in an old house is the basis of just about every slasher movie from Halloween (1978) to Saw (2003). Filmed almost entirely at night, The Bat has a spooky atmosphere that presages many of the Universal horrors that would come later, including Frankenstein and Dracula. The review in the March 14, 1926, New York Times noted: “People in the theatre yesterday were distinctly affected by the spine-chilling episodes, and they were relieved by the comedy interludes.” That just about says it all.\n\nThe Cat and the Canary One of the most popular of the “thriller” plays of the twenties was John Willard’s 1922 comedy-horror play The Cat and the Canary. It incorporated all the classic ingredients of the “old dark house” mystery: the reading of a will, a family fortune, a haunted mansion and a homicidal maniac called The Cat who escapes from an asylum and takes refuge in the mansion, terrorizing all the guests. New York Times theatre critic Alexander Woollcott reviewed the play on February 8, 1922, noting: The National Theatre has gone in for melodrama in the manner of Mary Roberts Rinehart— spooky melodrama, with a lot of quaking people cooped up in a shadowy old house, the while doors are opened by unseen hands, strangled cries are heard in the darkness and murdered men pitch headlong into the room from behind secret panels.... A creepy young thriller, nicely calculated to make every hair on the head rise and remain standing from 8:30 till nearly 11.\n\n12\n\nCOMEDY-HORROR FILMS\n\nAfter the success of D. W. Grifﬁth’s horror spoof One Exciting Night in 1922, Carl Laemmle, the German-born president of Universal Pictures, sat up and took notice. Although no fan of Gothic horror, he wanted to capitalize on Grifﬁth’s success, and did so with such now-classic ﬁlms as The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923) and The Phantom of the Opera (1925), both starring the great Lon Chaney. But those were, of course, serious productions, and some might say Hunchback is more of an historical drama than a horror ﬁlm. When the Mary Roberts Rinehart-Avery Hopwood play The Bat became a successful ﬁlm in 1926, Laemmle decided the time was right for Universal to enter the comedy-horror arena. He turned to Willard’s hugely popular play because of its commercial potential as a ﬁlm, with its plot centering on a beautiful heiress whose family attempts to drive her insane to collect her inheritance. At ﬁrst, Willard was a bit hesitant to sell the play to Hollywood. As it was still being performed onstage, he feared that, according to ﬁlm historian Douglas Brode, “that would have exposed to virtually everyone the trick ending ... destroying the play’s potential as an ongoing moneymaker.” Ultimately, Laemmle convinced Willard that the ﬁlm would only increase the play’s popularity, so the author relented. Willard was not asked to write the screenplay, which was assigned to Alfred A. Cohn and Robert F. Hill. The next step was ﬁnding a director to take on the task of transforming play into motion picture. Laemmle was highly impressed by the ﬁlm Waxworks (1924), directed by German ﬁlmmaker Paul Leni from a screenplay by Nosferatu screenwriter Henrik Galeen. Widely regarded as a masterpiece of German Expressionism, Waxworks is one of the ﬁrst omnibus ﬁlms, a trilogy of terror with a framing story that takes place at a wax museum. Highly inﬂuential, the ﬁlm brought Leni international fame and Laemmle gave him a chance to work in Hollywood, which he readily accepted. One of the things that impressed Laemmle about Waxworks was the director’s penchant for humor that counterpointed the ﬁlm’s dark themes. Laemmle felt that Leni could combine his Expressionist background and Germanic feel for the Gothic with the humor of the Broadway production, giving it tremendous appeal for American audiences who were hungry for new sensations. Lead actress Laura La Plante, who was chosen to portray heiress Annabelle West, was a veteran of some 50 ﬁlms. Irish actor Creighton Hale, who had appeared in 64 silent ﬁlms including the 1914 serial The Exploits of Elaine and D. W. Grifﬁth’s Way Down East (1920), accepted the comedic “hero” role of Annabelle’s cousin, Paul Jones. The Cat, aka Charles Wilder, was played by Forrest Stanley, who had been in such ﬁlms as Through the Dark (1924) and Shadow of the Law (1926). To round out the cast, Leni and Laemmle cast Tully Marshall as lawyer Roger Crosby, Martha Mattox as housekeeper Mammy Pleasant, Gertrude Astor as Cecily Young, Flora Finch as Aunt Susan Sillsby and Lucien Littleﬁeld as “crazy” psychiatrist (was there any other kind in silent ﬁlms?) Dr. Ira Lazar. In addition to his directing skills, Leni was also a painter and set designer. He did, in fact, design the sets for The Cat and the Canary along with Charles D. Hall, who would later design the unforgettable sets for Dracula and Frankenstein (both 1931). The sets reﬂected the aesthetics of German Expressionism, designed to represent in some subconscious way the emotions of the characters. During the course of directing the ﬁlm, Leni wanted to make sure his actors appeared to be sufﬁciently frightened. According to author Kevin Brownlow in his book Annus Mirabilis: The Film in 1927, The Cat and the Canary cinematographer, Gilbert Warrenton,\n\n1. The Silents\n\n13\n\ntold him that Leni used the sound of a gong to keep the actors on edge. “He beat that thing worse than the Salvation Army beat a drum,” he told Brownlow. The Cat and the Canary opened at New York City’s Colony Theatre in September of 1927 and was an immediate hit. Mordaunt Hall’s New York Times review of September 18 was headlined: “Mr. Leni’s Clever Film: Cat and Canary an Exception to the Rule in Mystery Pictures.” The review went on to note: Just as a painter gives character to his work by daubs from a knife or strokes with his brush, so with lights, shadows and the manipulation of the camera Mr. Leni goes forth and makes something really original with one interesting episode after another.... This is a ﬁlm which ought to be exhibited before many other directors to show them how a story should be told....\n\nLooking at The Cat and the Canary through modern eyes, it’s important to remember that this type of movie—what has come to be called an “Old Dark House” ﬁlm—was really a new genre at the time. Combining screams and scares had been hugely successful on Broadway, and as it turned out, the movies were an even better medium in which to experience sliding panels, thunderstorms, billowing curtains in darkened hallways and that cornerstone of the genre, clutching hands. The stage was one big master shot; in the ﬁlm, Leni’s camera prowled around the house, went in for close-ups, etc. The ﬁlm probably generated more screams and chuckles than any movie before it. The slapstick elements of the ﬁlm may fail to captivate twenty-ﬁrst century audiences, but Hale does a good job playing the reluctant hero, who is frequently wide-eyed with fright. The scene in which he hides under Cecily’s bed is pretty risqué for its time. She strips down to her stockings and undergarments, and he wants to be the gentleman and avert his eyes, but of course he can’t. What still works in The Cat and the Canary just as well as it did in 1927 is the atmosphere. Much of the camerawork is reminiscent of Murnau and of Leni’s own Waxworks. The usual look of silent ﬁlms was achieved by placing a stationary camera in front of the actors. Leni obviously has no interest in that; his camera moves, lurks, even races down corridors where ghost-white curtains billow like wraiths and hairy hands lurk around doorways. This kind of virtuoso camerawork is still being used today in contemporary horror ﬁlms, proving that Leni’s style remains incredibly inﬂuential. Critic Tony Rayns, in The Time Out Film Guide, called The Cat and the Canary “the deﬁnitive ‘haunted house’ movie.... Leni wisely plays it mainly for laughs ... hugely entertaining.” John Calhoun, writing in The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural summed up the ﬁlm’s comedic-horriﬁc aspects nicely, pointing out “Leni’s uncanny ability to bring out the period’s slapstick elements in the story’s hackneyed conventions.... At the same time, Leni didn’t short-circuit the horriﬁc aspects...” There’s no question that The Cat and the Canary is one of the watershed moments of comedy-horror ﬁlms, certainly in the silent era. Leni’s skill at combining the two genres was unsurpassed at that time, and would remain so for the next several years. It remained for the talkies, with their ability to make us actually hear the screams and the funny lines, to beat Leni at his own game.\n\nThe Gorilla The year 1927 also saw the release of Alfred Santell’s The Gorilla, an adaptation of Ralph Spence’s Broadway play. Interestingly enough, a young Walter Pidgeon turns out to be the\n\n14\n\nCOMEDY-HORROR FILMS\n\ngorilla (a costumed killer). The slapstick in the ﬁlm didn’t impress critics of the time, but apparently, it held the interest of actual apes. In a whimsical (but apparently factual) piece in The New York Times of November 17, 1927, headlined “Park Zoo Monkeys See a Gorilla Movie,” it is noted: Bessie, the chimpanzee, and her caged companions in the monkey house at the Central Park Zoo saw their ﬁrst motion picture last night. It was the screen version of The Gorilla, a stage melodrama of some seasons back, which will be shown in a local theatre next week.... Whenever the projection machine was stopped so that the reels could be changed, they raised an incessant racket, chattering and banging their trapeze bars about until the picture started again. Then they became quiet and watched until the next change of reels.... All present agreed that in one respect the monkeys were superior as an audience to some spectators in the movie houses. They didn’t read the subtitles out loud.\n\nThe anonymous author of the piece didn’t have to worry about that much longer; subtitles would soon be a thing of the past. The motion picture was about to ﬁnd its voice, and often it would sound like a high-pitched scream, followed by nervous laughter.\n\n2\n\nTHE THIRTIES Old Dark Houses and Gorilla Suits The stock market crash of October 1929 and the resultant human misery of the Great Depression coincided, ironically enough, with the true birth of the American horror ﬁlm. The ﬁrst ﬁlm to really be identiﬁed as such was Tod Browning’s Dracula, released in 1931 when the Depression was nearing its worst. Once again, human nature seemed to demand a safety valve for its anxieties, and the thirties saw the full ﬂowering of the genre. Despite the fact that money was scarce and every penny in a family’s budget was precious, people ﬂocked to see “the talkies,” especially horror ﬁlms, in tremendous numbers.\n\nThe Bat Whispers Roland West’s gangster ﬁlm Alibi (1929) was an early talkie starring Chester Morris as an unredeemed criminal. In 2005, the ﬁlm was shown as part of a Roland West tribute at the American Cinematheque at the Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles. The tribute noted that the ﬁlm “illustrates [West’s] innovative use of the then-new medium of sound, plus his baroque visuals that were as much inﬂuenced by German expressionism as avant-garde experimentation.” Alibi also featured art direction by William Cameron Menzies. It is, however, West’s remake of his own silent ﬁlm The Bat, retitled The Bat Whispers (to nail home the point that it’s a “talkie”), that remains the director’s best-remembered ﬁlm. One of the reasons for this is that West shot two versions of the ﬁlm simultaneously, one in the standard 1.33 aspect ratio, and the other in an early “widescreen” 65mm process. There was a short vogue in 1930 for various widescreen formats. Happy Days and The Big Trail were released in something called “Fox Grandeur”; Warner Bros. released Kismet in “Vistascope”; MGM’s Billy the Kid went out in “Realife”; and RKO issued Danger Lights in “Natural Vision.” The widescreen mini-trend was premature, however, as many theater managers found the process of converting to new equipment too costly, and ﬁlmgoers didn’t want to pay increased prices to see the ﬁlms, most of which weren’t that wonderful to begin with. It wasn’t until 1953 that the widescreen process started to become the cinema standard. The Bat Whispers was available to theaters in both 35mm prints, photographed by Ray June, and in 65mm prints shot by Robert Planck. Aside from the formats themselves, there are minimal differences between the two versions. The 35mm version is the one most often seen, and it’s stunning enough; it opens with a camera movement that suggests a bat in ﬂight, swooping down at the stroke of midnight from a clock tower to soar through an open window. The use of miniatures combined with full-size sets completes the illusion; the ﬁlming was accomplished thanks to a lightweight camera dolly (created especially for the ﬁlm by 15\n\n16\n\nCOMEDY-HORROR FILMS\n\nOriginal poster art for Roland West’s sound remake of The Bat, the 1930 “talkie” The Bat Whispers.\n\n2. The Thirties\n\n17\n\ntechnician Charles Cline) which allowed the camera to be moved eighteen feet vertically in just a few seconds. Early sound ﬁlms are not known for their ﬂuid camera movements, as ﬁlmmakers were still getting used to the new technology and had a tendency to ﬁlm from within enclosed glass booths, with microphones hidden somewhere on the sets (usually in the furniture, i.e., potted plants). But West liberated his camera, ﬂying along with the Bat through windows and doorways. The ﬁrst few minutes of The Bat Whispers are calculated to give the viewer vertigo, and in 1930, they must have succeeded. Reuniting with his Alibi star Chester Morris, West gave the actor free rein to ham it up as the lead character, a “detective” who is—oh, let’s just say it—actually The Bat. Of course, overacting was the order of the day in early talkie “melodramas,” but Morris really takes ﬂight, as it were, into realms of self-parody. But then again, The Bat Whispers doesn’t take itself seriously for a moment. Mordaunt Hall’s review in the New York Times of January 16, 1931, exclaimed: “A bigger and better picture of The Bat, the old would-be spine-chiller, in which shrieks and giggles are mixed, is to be found at the Rivoli. It is bigger because it is shown on an enlarged screen and it is better because the characters have voices.” The review in Phil Hardy’s Encyclopedia of Horror Movies is even more to the point: “If the material is the routine mixture of screams and laughs, West’s direction is often truly startling, with scenes executed in shadow play, the camera performing stunning arabesques....” Although The Bat Whispers may be dramatically creaky by today’s standards, it’s still fun to watch, and it’s important to note that even in 1930 it was a deliberately “unrealistic” spoof. It has been stated that some of Morris’ “squinting” in the ﬁlm was a result of the exceptionally bright “underlighting” used for his closeups, which eventually burned his retinas and led to a condition that became known as “Klieg Eye.” The best performance in the ﬁlm—and the most understated—is that of Grayce Hampton as Cornelia Van Gorder, the wealthy dowager who refuses to let The Bat frighten her out of her own house. An accomplished stage actress, she gives Van Gorder an excellent “don’t mess with me” personality, stronger and more independent than most female characters you see in ﬁlms today. Some of the humor works and some of it doesn’t, but The Bat Whispers is consistently entertaining from a comedy-horror standpoint, and extremely inﬂuential to this day: Batman creator Bob Kane has been quoted on the record as saying that he saw The Bat Whispers on its original release and it inspired him to create the character of Batman eight years later. Without realizing it, West is indirectly responsible for the whole Batman phenomenon. But then we should have guessed that from Morris’ little speech at the end of the ﬁlm: “The Bat always ﬂies at night ... and always in a straight line!”\n\nThe Old Dark House J.B. Priestley’s 1927 novel Benighted appealed to director James Whale’s mordant sense of humor, which was much in evidence in his Frankenstein (1931), possibly the most famous horror ﬁlm of all time. Dwight Frye as Fritz is both a comic and tragic character, always lurking around the watchtower, pulling up his socks, muttering to himself—and of course bringing back a “criminal brain” to put into the skull of Frankenstein’s creation, rather than the “normal brain” which he dropped on the ﬂoor after being startled by what sounds like somebody clashing a cymbal (an off-screen noise that is never explained). Aside from Frye’s per-\n\n18\n\nCOMEDY-HORROR FILMS\n\nformance, though, Frankenstein is a fairly somber ﬁlm. But you could sense an irony that Whale kept bottled up, just waiting to be released. The following year, it was, in a ﬁlm called The Old Dark House. According to The Encyclopedia of Horror Movies, Priestley later wrote about the title change, which he wasn’t too crazy about: “My American publishers, presumably determined to make money out of one of my books or perish in the attempt, promptly abandoned my title, which has of course a double meaning and tells you almost everything about the novel, and with the title any pretensions the book might have to be a psychological or philosophical novel. They called it The Old Dark House and brought it out as a thriller. So disguised, it had a very good sale indeed.” Following up Frankenstein was going to be a difﬁcult feat for Whale, but he engaged some very talented people to help him accomplish it. A February 14, 1932, New York Times column called “Projection Jottings” noted what was next for the star and director of Frankenstein: “Two Boris Karloff productions went into the hands of the adapters last week at the Universal plant. Benn W. Levy, author of The Devil Passes and Mrs. Moonlight, is in charge of The Old Dark House, a novel by J. B. Priestley. With this assignment The Old Dark House takes on a more or less British hue. Mr. Levy is an Englishman, and so is Mr. Priestley, and so is James Whale, who will direct the ﬁlm. Mr. Karloff also hails from the other side of the pond.” Interestingly, the article went on to say that the second of Mr. Karloff’s new productions would be The Invisible Man, to be adapted by Garrett Fort, who also adapted Frankenstein and Dracula, and to be directed by Robert Florey, who had just completed Murders in the Rue Morgue with Bela Lugosi. As any horror buff will tell you, The Invisible Man was ultimately directed by James Whale and starred Claude Rains in his screen debut. The “Englishness” of The Old Dark House became even more prominent when its cast members were revealed in an April 24, 1932, New York Times article: Universal has collected an interesting cast for its production of The Old Dark House. Charles Laughton, the English actor who gave theatre-goers the shudders in Payment Deferred last Fall, has one of the leads. He was brought over by Paramount and loaned to Universal for this one ﬁlm, his ﬁrst picture in America. Gloria Stuart, the ingénue whose entrance into the ﬁlms caused so much controversy that the Hays Ofﬁce had to step in and adjudicate it, will have her ﬁrst opportunity in The Old Dark House. Raymond Massey, who came over from England to play “Hamlet” and found his way into the pictures, has replaced Walter Byron in the cast.... In addition there are Boris Karloff, Melvyn Douglas and Lillian Bond.\n\nA word about the Gloria Stuart “controversy”: The article makes it sound as though the Hays Ofﬁce had to step in to “adjudicate” because Stuart had done something risqué. But no, the future Oscar nominee for Titanic (1997) had apparently been signed to two separate movie contracts in 1932, one with Paramount and one with Universal. The former stage actress was much in demand, and apparently didn’t consult an attorney before signing both contracts. A court arbitrator had to step in to ascertain which studio would be permitted to “introduce” Stuart to the ﬁlmgoing public, and Universal won. Although it isn’t mentioned in the New York Times piece, Douglas reportedly replaced actor Russell Hopton in the role of Roger Penderel. But undoubtedly the most interesting bit of casting in The Old Dark House is that of Elspeth Dudgeon, a woman, as the patriarch of the bizarre Femm clan. The story goes that Whale couldn’t ﬁnd a male actor who looked old enough to portray the 101-year-old character. Production on The Old Dark House began in the third week of April, 1932, and was completed at the end of May, all at Universal Studios. Although no speciﬁc ﬁgures on the ﬁlm’s\n\n2. The Thirties\n\n19\n\nbudget are available, based on the budget for other James Whale productions of the time, including Frankenstein, one can reasonably estimate that The Old Dark House cost around $250,000. Ernest Thesiger was ﬁfty-three when he appeared in the ﬁlm as Roderick Femm, although he looks considerably older. He had known Whale from their stage work in England, where Whale had a great reputation as a theater director, particularly for Journey’s End. Thesiger had made an impact there as the Dauphin in Saint Joan. Douglas, at the time an up-andcoming star, had been brought to Hollywood by Goldwyn, where he was supposed to have starred in a ﬁlm called Adventure Lady. But the ﬁlm was delayed and Douglas agreed to appear in Whale’s ﬁlm instead, as perhaps the closest role the ﬁlm has to a “hero,” Roger Penderel. Eva Moore, who appeared as Roderick’s sister Rebecca Femm, had been known in her younger days on the British stage as a great beauty, which comes as quite a surprise after seeing her in The Old Dark House. The 62-year-old actress’ disturbingly witty portrayal of the Puritanical Rebecca, who looks as run-down as her house, is one of the more memorable in the ﬁlm. The Old Dark House was supposed to have been Laughton’s debut for American audi-\n\nBoris Karloff and Lillian Bond in James Whale’s comedy-horror classic, The Old Dark House (1932).\n\n20\n\nCOMEDY-HORROR FILMS\n\nences, but Paramount’s Devil and the Deep came out ﬁrst. This was a legal necessity; Paramount had Laughton under contract and loaned him to Universal under the stipulation that Devil and the Deep would be released before The Old Dark House. Screenwriter Benn Levy had written Blackmail (1929), the ﬁrst English ﬁlm in sound, for Alfred Hitchcock. He was asked to come over to the States to write The Invisible Man, but when that ﬁlm was delayed, he accepted the job of writing Devil and the Deep and, eventually, The Old Dark House. He was a friend of Laughton’s and was instrumental in getting the actor cast in both ﬁlms. Massey, an Oxford-educated Canadian, had recently appeared in the British ﬁlm The Speckled Band as Sherlock Holmes. The Old Dark House was his ﬁrst American ﬁlm. He was cast as the other male lead, Philip Waverton, who is married to Stuart’s character Margaret. The cinematographer was Arthur Edeson, who had also photographed Frankenstein, and the art director was Charles D. Hall, who had also worked on Whale’s previous shocker. With all these impressive pedigrees, the stage was set for another big money-maker for Universal. For a number of reasons, however, this was not to be. The Old Dark House was released on October 20, 1932, and garnered mostly negative reviews from around the country. In New\n\nLeft to right: Raymond Massey (on ﬂoor), Lillian Bond, Gloria Stuart, Melvyn Douglas, Boris Karloff, Charles Laughton and Eva Moore in James Whale’s The Old Dark House (1932).\n\n2. The Thirties\n\n21\n\nYork City, the critics seemed to appreciate Whale’s very British humor. Mordaunt Hall wrote in the October 28, New York Times, “This current thriller, like Frankenstein, has the distinction of being directed by James Whale, who again proves his ability in this direction.... Mr. Karloff is, of course, thoroughly in his element as Morgan. He leaves no stone unturned to make this character thoroughly disturbing.” Karloff, in fact, doesn’t have a great deal to do in the ﬁlm. Mostly he gets drunk, makes some really weird vocalizations and chases Gloria Stuart around the house. His one bit of choice acting comes at the death of Saul Femm, memorably played by actor Brember Wills, another friend of Whale’s who came to America just for the role. As Morgan the mute butler, Karloff grieves over Saul’s death, a surprisingly tender moment from what Stuart’s character calls “that brute Morgan.” The fact is that audiences in 1932 were disappointed with The Old Dark House. It didn’t have the shock moments of Frankenstein, and its claustrophobic setting precluded it from having that ﬁlm’s scope. The humor went over the heads of most audiences, and state censor boards insisted on cutting bits out of the ﬁlm, notably a few lines of dialogue uttered by Lillian Bond, in which she admits that her character, Gladys, is “kept” by Laughton’s character, Porterhouse. A shot in which Wills bites Douglas on the throat was also frequently cut by the censors. Ultimately, The Old Dark House did dismal box ofﬁce outside of New York City. Interestingly enough, the only country where it really turned a proﬁt was in England. It may be said that it’s one of the most “British” American ﬁlms ever made, for its gallows humor and straight-faced underplaying is distinctly British. It’s set rather convincingly in the Welsh countryside, and the average viewer today might assume it to be a British-made movie. Some of the ﬁlm’s dialogue was taken directly from the book. When the stranded travelers attempt to ﬁnd refuge from the storm in the old dark house, the door is opened by Karloff, who sounds like he’s trying to talk, but his vocal chords won’t cooperate. Douglas quips, “Even Welsh ought not to sound like that.” Thesiger is absolutely indispensable to The Old Dark House. Prissy, effeminate yet controlled, his performance is one of the most memorable things about the ﬁlm. The dinner scene is priceless, with Thesiger cajoling his guests to “Have a po-ta-to.” Thesiger was perfectly in tune with Whale’s sensibilities, his oddness and eccentricities punctuating the ﬁlm at all the right moments. Moore is equally as impressive, although in a different way. Stuart, as Margaret Waverton, decides to put on a ﬂowing evening gown before dinner, for no apparent reason other than to give pre–Code audiences a bit of cheesecake. “That’s ﬁne stuff,” Rebecca says, pointing to the gown, “but it’ll rot...” Then she reaches out to poke Margaret right above her cleavage: “That’s ﬁner stuff still ... but it’ll rot too, with time.” A very uncomfortable scene, heightened tremendously by Edeson’s camerawork in which we see various distorted reﬂections of Rebecca in the mirror. Laughton, an inveterate scene-stealer, really whoops it up when he comes into the picture midway through, with Bond in tow. Bond is the one who turns out to have the more important role, though, for her character falls head over heels in love with Douglas’. The “love interest” seems a triﬂe out of place in this ﬁlm, as everything else is so pitch perfect. But Bond’s Gladys is a much livelier character than the rather stuffy Margaret, and she invests her role with a lot of good humor and vivacity. The Old Dark House is one of the ﬁnest of all comedy-horror ﬁlms because of Whale’s penchant for the bizarre and because of the wonderful ensemble cast. As Phil Hardy wrote\n\n22\n\nCOMEDY-HORROR FILMS\n\nin The Encyclopedia of Horror Movies, “Allowed free rein for the ﬁrst time in his career, Whale’s black humor revels delightedly.... As much as anything, the delight of the ﬁlm is the subtlety with which Whale shades comedy of manners into tragedy of horrors....” Because of the poor reception afforded the ﬁlm in 1932, the copyright was allowed to lapse and The Old Dark House probably would have become a lost ﬁlm were it not for the heroic efforts of ﬁlmmaker (and Whale friend) Curtis Harrington, who eventually tracked down the negative in the Universal vaults and had it restored. We should all be very grateful to Harrington, because The Old Dark House is almost perfectly realized, both as a black comedy and as a classic horror ﬁlm that has the power to disturb and thrill even today. Whale’s most personal ﬁlm survives, and we get to see his ultimate joke on the audience: that John Dudgeon is really Elspeth. That may have been Whale’s little “gay” punchline to a ﬁlm that reveled in characters that rebelled against the norms of the time.\n\nSh! The Octopus Although there is certainly a lot of comedy in Whale’s Bride of Frankenstein (1935), the ﬁlm’s ultimate theme of tragedy mitigates against it being a comedy-horror ﬁlm. The next real comedy-horror ﬁlm—and one of the weirdest Hollywood movies of the thirties—is a nearly-forgotten Warner Bros. picture called Sh! The Octopus (1937). The fact that it was made during a year when there were virtually no horror ﬁlms released is only one of the odd things about this movie. Another is that, at a running time of only ﬁfty-four minutes, it barely qualiﬁes as a feature. It has been erroneously referred to as a remake of both The Bat Whispers and The Gorilla, but in fact it’s yet another comedy-horror ﬁlm based on a Broadway play of the twenties. Sh! The Octopus, the play, debuted on Broadway on February 21, 1928. The following day, it was reviewed in the New York Times by an unnamed critic who noted, “Parts of the play are funny, parts of it actually do make a little ﬂesh creep, and much of it is just noisy. But it never permits its spectators the luxury of a moment’s slumber.” Written by Ralph Murphy (who also wrote The Gorilla) and Donald Gallaher, Sh! The Octopus is another old dark house thriller, except that this time it’s set in a lighthouse. Perhaps, therefore, one might call it an old dark lighthouse thriller, if that isn’t an oxymoron. The play was advertised as a “sneaky, snaky, slimy mystery,” but it also had very strong horror elements, all of which were left intact when it was ﬁlmed by director William C. McGann. The crazy plot involves Detectives Kelly (Hugh Herbert) and Dempsey (Allen Jenkins), who ﬁnd themselves trapped on a stormy night (of course) in a lighthouse with a group of eccentric strangers. They include artist Paul Morgan (John Eldredge), who has just bought the lighthouse from the government; Vesta Vernoff (Marcia Ralston), who says her stepfather has been murdered; Captain Hook (George Rosener), the one-handed lighthouse caretaker; Captain Cobb (Brandon Tynan), a sailor who is a friend of the artist’s; Polly Crane (Margaret Irving), a woman who claims to have escaped from her overly amorous boyfriend; and Nanny (Elspeth Dudgeon), housekeeper to Dr. Harriman, Vesta’s scientist stepfather. Eventually, a character who calls himself Police Commissioner Patrick Aloysious Clancy (Eric Stanley) shows up, but no one in the lighthouse is above suspicion. After all, there’s Dr. Harriman’s body hanging from the ceiling, dripping blood on everybody. But the blood turns out to be chocolate syrup and the body is actually a dummy. Just what is going on here? If the characters aren’t strange enough, the story continues to get stranger as it goes along.\n\n2. The Thirties\n\n23\n\nThe police department has declared war on The Octopus, an arch-criminal who has his own submarine. Vesta eventually tells the detectives that the lair of the Octopus is beneath the lighthouse. Just to confuse the issue even further, there is apparently a real giant octopus lurking about in a sea cave nearby. Tentacles close and lock the lighthouse doors, preventing everyone from escaping; poison gas ﬁlls the place; and Kelly has an underwater battle with what looks like a man in a rubber octopus suit. As you can see, the plot of Sh! The Octopus deﬁes analysis. As the story continues, it makes less and less sense. There are also encounters with a turtle carrying a candle on its back, a barking seal, some frogs and a really terriﬁc “unmasking” scene in which we discover that The Octopus is actually Nanny, our old friend Elspeth Dudgeon from The Old Dark House. Shortly after, however, we discover that the whole thing has been a dream; it turns out that Kelly has fainted at the hospital where his wife is giving birth and had to be revived with oxygen, which caused him to have a very weird dream indeed. One must wonder if there was more than oxygen going to his head, since Sh! The Octopus is perhaps the most surreal Hollywood comedy-horror ﬁlm ever made. The plot makes no coherent sense; if there is no dead body, then there is no murder. So where is Vesta’s stepfather? Who or what is The Octopus? Why are none of the characters what they seem to be? The short running time of the ﬁlm may indicate that certain plot points were cut out, but in reality the ﬁlm is very close to the play. The New York Times review of the play pointed out, “It all turned out to be a dream at the Royale Theatre last night—not too bad a dream, perhaps, but a singularly crowded one.” A New York Times ﬁlm critic wrote of the movie version on December 24, 1937: “This is another of those scatter-brained spook comedies, with the ﬂiberty-gibbet Hugh [Herbert] and his dead-pan team-mate, Allen Jenkins.... There is the usual assortment of corpses, disembodied voices and clutching hands (or rather, octopi tentacles), and a hopelessly confused shred of plot....” Confused it certainly is, but Sh! The Octopus looks great, thanks to Arthur Todd’s atmospheric monochrome cinematography. Ultimately, the ﬁlm has the look and feel of a dream and the screenplay by George Bricker has its own interior dream logic. The fact is that what starts out as a fairly standard old dark house thriller ends up something like the famous “It May Look Like a Walnut” episode from the classic Dick Van Dyke Show, in which all of Rob Petrie’s friends seemed to turn into aliens (including his wife), until it all turned out to have been a dream brought on by watching an old sci-ﬁ movie on TV. If the humor in Sh! The Octopus had been, shall we say, more timeless, it may have become a classic. But its unorthodox running time and often lame jokes condemned it to semi-obscurity. Here’s a typical exchange from the ﬁlm: VESTA VERNOFF: Poor Nanny! DETECTIVE DEMPSEY: Who’s Nanny? DETECTIVE HAROLD KELLY: Nanny’s a goat! Hoo, hoo!\n\nA word here about Herbert: Although not as broadly unfunny as the Ritz Brothers, he’s certainly an acquired taste for modern audiences. He began his career in vaudeville and went to Hollywood after the advent of talking pictures. His trademark phrase in which he would ﬂutter his hands and remark to himself, “Hoo, hoo, hoo, wonderful, wonderful, hoo, hoo, hoo!” makes it look a bit as if he’s suffering from Tourette’s Syndrome. His perpetually ﬂustered persona carried him through a number of supporting roles, usually as an absentminded professor and very occasionally, as in Sh! The Octopus, as the star. The movie hasn’t been completely forgotten, however. There’s an independent rock\n\n24\n\nCOMEDY-HORROR FILMS\n\nband from Detroit, Michigan, that calls itself—you guessed it—Sh! The Octopus. Given the ﬁlm’s reputation for weirdness, the fact that its title lives on as the name of a rock band seems both ironic and appropriate.\n\nThe Cat and the Canary (1939) In late 1938, the Universal horror cycle started all over again after the successful reissue of Dracula and Frankenstein as a double feature for Halloween. The new owners of Universal, who were looking for a hit, quickly rushed Son of Frankenstein with Karloff, Basil Rathbone and Bela Lugosi into production for a January 1939 release. Horror ﬁlms had been ﬂoundering for a couple of years, partly because of a British ban placed upon them; the British government felt they were bad for public morale during Hitler’s march to conquer the world. But the new life breathed into the classic monsters brought a succession of remakes and sequels. On November 29, 1938, a headline in the New York Times read: “Paramount Plans to Remake The Cat and the Canary—Martha Raye in lead.” The story went on to report: “Paramount today acquired remake rights to The Cat and the Canary from Universal and will ﬁlm it on the Spring schedule with Bob Hope and Martha Raye in the leads. Arthur Hornblow Jr. will produce and writers will be assigned to prepare an adaptation this week.” For whatever reason, Raye ended up not being involved in the remake; the lead female role subsequently went to Shirley Ross, a vivacious singer-actress who is best remembered for singing a duet with Hope of “Thanks for the Memory” in the hugely successful musical feature The Big Broadcast of 1938. Ultimately, however, Ross was unceremoniously dropped from the ﬁlm when a bigger star suddenly became available. On March 2, 1939, the New York Times came out with this headline: “Delay in The Dictator Seen as Paulette Goddard Takes Role in Another Film.” Goddard had been chosen by Charlie Chaplin (her husband) to co-star in his Hitler satire, which eventually became known as The Great Dictator. But the story in the Times revealed that Chaplin was having problems with the project: “Signaling postponement of The Dictator, which Charles Chaplin was to have started March 15, Paulette Goddard ... was engaged today by Paramount for the leading role opposite Bob Hope in The Cat and the Canary. Miss Goddard replaces Shirley Ross, who was originally cast. It is reported that Chaplin is having script trouble on his satire on European politics, and it is probable his ﬁlm will not get under way before summer.” And so it was that Hope and Goddard teamed for what would be the ﬁrst of three ﬁlms. Producer Arthur Hornblow Jr. and Paramount chose Elliott Nugent to direct. He had been a stage actor and leading man in early talkies, but eventually became far better known as a writer, producer and director. The son of playwright-producer-actor J.C. Nugent, he had cut his teeth in vaudeville and got into ﬁlm roles in 1929. He began directing some minor ﬁlms in the early thirties, but his talent eventually got noticed and he graduated to bigger productions. Ultimately, he became one of Hope’s favorite directors, helming such Hope hits as My Favorite Brunette (1947). Other performers cast in The Cat and the Canary included John Beal and Douglass Montgomery as would-be heirs; Gale Sondergaard as Miss Lu, one of her patented “weird housekeeper” roles; and smoothly menacing George Zucco as attorney Crosby. Zucco played Moriarty to Basil Rathbone’s Sherlock Holmes in that same year’s The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes for 20th Century-Fox. Released in November 1939, The Cat and the Canary was an instant smash. In the New\n\n2. The Thirties\n\n25\n\nBob Hope and Paulette Goddard ﬁnd a clue in Elliot Nugent’s The Cat and the Canary (1939).\n\nYork Times, Frank S. Nugent (no relation to the director) wrote: “Since mystery melodramas laid in old dark houses are mostly nonsense anyway, Paramount has had the wit and wisdom to produce a nonsense edition of John Willard’s old shocker The Cat and the Canary. Streamlined, screamlined and played to the hilt for comedy, the new version ... is more harebrained than hair-raising, which is as it should be.... Good show.” Indeed, 1939’s The Cat and the Canary raised the bar for all future comedy-horror ﬁlms. Smoothly produced on impressive sets, the 74-minute ﬁlm is fast-paced and consistently entertaining. It’s the movie in which Hope created his “cowardly” hero role, the wisecracking man of the world who uses quips to ﬁght off his fear. The story features all of the usual clichés: sliding panels, clutching hands, lights that turn themselves on and off, eerie wails and shadows galore. Beautifully shot in black and white, it has an elegant fog-bound atmosphere. The bayou settings don’t look real for a moment, but the dreamlike quality of their appearance only adds to the overall effect of the ﬁlm. Hope has some good lines. When Cicily (Nydia Westman) asks him, “Do you believe people can come back from the dead?” he quips, “You mean like the Republicans?” He also has some bad lines, such as “Let’s all drink Scotch and make wry faces.” But as Nugent pointed out in his review, “Good and bad alike proﬁt from Mr. Hope’s comic style.”\n\n26\n\nCOMEDY-HORROR FILMS\n\nHope has chemistry with Goddard from the start, and all of the other cast members are suitably creepy (especially Sondergaard) or intentionally annoying (Westman). There is really nothing new in the remake except for the approach. Whereas Leni’s 1927 ﬁlm treated the elements of the “old dark house” melodrama as if they were all new, the 1939 version takes an almost post-modern approach. Cast as a stage and radio actor, Hope continually comments on the action throughout the ﬁlm as though he were performing it in a play. “Where’s the leading lady?” he asks the assembled guests, and Goddard appears right on cue. Hope’s winking performance assures us that, although we may have moments of fright and shock, everything will turn out just ﬁne in the end. In a sense, Hope is the audience, just as scared as we are, blurting out his frequently lame jokes to keep from getting “goosepimples on my goosepimples,” as he says at one point. And there’s a certain bit of irony when Hope asks another character, “Where’s Crosby?” Of course, this was a year before Bob and Bing went on the “Road” together. Sadly, this Cat and the Canary is seldom seen today. But if you can ﬁnd a copy of it, you’ll see why audiences of that era were delighted with it. They were ready for something light and frothy, yet mixed skillfully with dark and scary. It was a perfect recipe, arriving as it did between the tragedy of the Great Depression and the upcoming horrors of World War II.\n\nLeft to right: The Ritz Brothers, Bela Lugosi, Anita Louise and Edward Norris in Allan Dwan’s unfunny, un-scary 1939 remake of The Gorilla.\n\n2. The Thirties\n\n27\n\nThe Gorilla (1939) The tagline for the 1939 remake of The Gorilla read: “Laughs plus Thrills = Entertainment.” While that may be true in general, it certainly was not the case in this poorly conceived version of the Ralph Spence play, designed, in this instance, as a vehicle for the Ritz Brothers (Jimmy, Harry and Al). It was their contractual obligation movie, the last ﬁlm they were assigned to do under their 20th Century–Fox agreement. Featured in the cast were Bela Lugosi and Lionel Atwill. Unfortunately, the presence of The Ritz Brothers—the ﬁlm’s raison d’etre—is also its biggest detriment. As adapted by Rian James and Sid Silvers from the play, it’s basically the same old convoluted story about Walter Stevens (Atwill) receiving a death threat from a murderer who calls himself “The Gorilla.” He hires three extremely incompetent detectives (The Ritz Brothers) to protect him until midnight, the predicted hour of his doom. There’s a creepy butler (Lugosi) and a carnival ape (Art Miles in a gorilla suit) lurking around. Patsy Kelly as a maid shrieks herself hoarse. Anita Louise as Atwill’s niece screams herself silly. And the Ritz Brothers mug, grimace and pratfall their way through the movie. A word here about the Ritz Brothers: although their version of The Three Musketeers (1939) isn’t bad, in general they made the Three Stooges look like players in a drawing room comedy of manners. They’re all but impossible to watch today, chewing every piece of scenery in The Gorilla as if they’re playing to the last row in a crowded theater. Although the ﬁlm is only 66 minutes long, their foolish antics make it seem interminable. In other respects, The Gorilla has a lot going for it. Lugosi has an amusing scene or two and even saves the day at the end by sticking a gun in the villain’s back. Atwill is his usual professional self. The direction by Hollywood veteran Allan Dwan is slick and fast-paced, while the camerawork of Edward Cronjager is ﬂuid and crisp. The art direction by Lewis Creber and Richard Day is also ﬁrst-rate, highlighting some lovely Gothic sets. All in all, it’s a very well-produced motion picture. As a comedy-horror ﬁlm, though, it fails miserably. It is, in fact, an abject study in how not to make a comedy-horror ﬁlm: Have an alleged comedy team express every conceivable reaction of shock, terror, disbelief and just plain stupidity, and have them menaced by a man in an ape suit. Stretch this concept—which the Stooges often did in about 20 minutes—to feature length. And wait for the audience to a) laugh, b) scream or c) leave the theater. Most audiences in 1939 opted for the latter. Opening on May 26, 1939, The Gorilla was reviewed in the New York Times rather tersely by Thomas M. Pryor two days later: “It’s all supposed to be either very funny or shockingly thrilling, depending how you look at it. We couldn’t see it either way.” There is one funny line in the ﬁlm, and it belongs to Patsy Kelly. It seems that the carnival gorilla is named Poe, for no particular reason. When the owner of said gorilla tells Kelly to beware, because Poe hates women, she replies, “So does Kipling!” But one mildly amusing line in 66 minutes doesn’t make a comedy-horror ﬁlm.\n\n3\n\nTHE FORTIES Killer Zombies and Comedy Teams By 1940, Hitler and his inhuman cronies were moving quickly in their quest for world domination. London was besieged by the Blitz and the world was becoming a very scary place indeed. By the time the U.S. was forced to enter World War II after Pearl Harbor, it almost seemed as though the apocalypse might be at hand. Yet, as we have learned in the previous two chapters, the human taste for horror (and humor) only seems to be heightened when the world situation is at its most desperate. All through the forties, comedy-horror ﬁlms would force us to face up to our worst fears and to laugh in the Devil’s (i.e., Hitler’s) face.\n\nThe Ghost Breakers After the success of The Cat and the Canary, it was inevitable that Bob Hope and Paulette Goddard would be asked to star in another comedy-horror ﬁlm by Paramount, and the offer arrived in 1940 as another remake of The Ghost Breaker, this time entitled The Ghost Breakers. Director George Marshall, who had just scored a major hit with the comedy-western Destry Rides Again, was signed to do something similar for the comedy-horror genre. The supporting cast for The Ghost Breakers included Richard Carlson (later to become famous for such sci-ﬁ classics as It Came from Outer Space and Creature from the Black Lagoon) as Geoff Montgomery, a suspicious character; the distinguished actor Paul Lukas as Parada, a Cuban real estate agent; Noble Johnson from King Kong as the zombie; and a young Anthony Quinn in a dual role as twin brothers Ramon and Francisco Mederes. There’s also a don’tblink-or-you’ll-miss-it screen debut by Robert Ryan as an intern in an early scene. In many ways, though, the most interesting—and most controversial—support is provided by African-American actor Willie Best as Bob Hope’s “boy” Alex Syracuse (a take-off on Jack Benny’s second banana Eddie “Rochester” Anderson). Best was a victim of the racial stereotyping of the era; he often used the stage name “Sleep ’n’ Eat.” Some of his best-known screen appearances include Shirley Temple ﬁlms such as Little Miss Marker (1934), as well as all-black musicals such as Green Pastures (1936). Despite the demeaning nature of some of these roles, Best performed them with consummate skill and impeccable comic timing, never seen to better effect than in The Ghost Breakers, in which he matches witticisms with Hope, barb for barb. The Kentucky family feud subplot from the original play was jettisoned in favor of having Hope and Best escape from gangsters and head for Cuba, rather than Spain. Once in the Caribbean, the ﬁlm’s plot and style become considerably darker, although the laughs never stop ﬂowing. 28\n\n3. The Forties\n\n29\n\nParticularly chilly are the scenes involving Johnson as the zombie, kept by his old voodoo-conjuring mother (Virginia Brissac) in a shack on the edge of a swamp. His pursuit of Goddard, who tries to escape him by running up a long staircase in the haunted castle she has inherited, is still one of the best zombie scenes on ﬁlm, and one of the most stunningly photographed (by Charles Lang). Hope was known as one of the best practitioners of rapid-ﬁre one-liners in the business. A lot of it had to do with his radio experience, which by its very nature was fast and strictly verbal. A few examples of the non-stop Ghost Breakers banter include a discussion between Carlson, Goddard and Hope regarding zombies. Goddard notes that it must be horrible to be a zombie, prompting Carlson to continue: “It’s worse than horrible, because a zombie has no will of his own. You see them sometimes, walking around blindly with dead eyes, following orders, not knowing what they do, not caring.” Hope, apparently trying to be fair to both political parties, does a reverse take on his line from The Cat and the Canary, quipping, “You mean like Democrats?” Politically incorrect or not, some of the funniest scenes involve Hope and Best. Early in the ﬁlm, a thunderstorm causes the lights to go out and Hope says, “Basil Rathbone must be having a party.” But when he says things to Best like, “You look like a blackout in a blackout. I’m gonna have to paint you white,” that’s the kind of humor that makes modern audiences a tad uncomfortable. However, there’s nothing mean-spirited in the relationship between Hope and Best in the ﬁlm, and part of the fun of it is seeing how these two comic masters top each other with verbal bon mots. One of the best examples of these comes when they’re exploring the castle, and Hope says to Best: “Listen, you stay there, and if a couple of fellas come runnin’ down the stairs in a few minutes, let the ﬁrst one go. That’ll be me.” Alex replies, “If somebody passes you, that’ll be me.” This may be the old “Feets, don’t fail me now” kind of routine, but it works because of the timing and the sheer likeability of the actors, especially Best. When they look at an old portrait that resembles Goddard, Best off-handedly says, “I’m befuddled.” For whatever reason—probably his delivery, which sounds as if it’s improvised—it turns into a very funny line. According to Hal Erickson in All Movie Guide, Hope once said that Best was one of the ﬁnest actors he knew. They (and Goddard) appeared together again the following year in Nothing but the Truth, a non-horror comedy. But The Ghost Breakers may be the ﬁnest and funniest hour for each of them. In the New York Times review of July 4, 1940, Bosley Crowther wrote: It looks as though Paramount has really discovered something: it has found the fabled formula for making an audience shriek with laughter and fright at one and (as the barkers say) the simultaneous time.... It worked out very nicely in The Cat and the Canary last year, and it is working quite as nicely—and even more amusingly, in fact—in The Ghost Breakers....\n\nThe Ghost Breakers is a high-water mark in comedy-horror ﬁlms. Although most of the supernatural manifestations are explained away at the end, as was common with “old dark house” movies, the ghost itself is not. The scene in which we see it, as a white form of ectoplasm drifting out of a sarcophagus, remains one of the eeriest spectral scenes in a Hollywood movie. Marshall remade The Ghost Breakers in 1953 as a Dean Martin-Jerry Lewis vehicle called Scared Stiff. Despite the presence of the always watchable Lizabeth Scott in the Paulette Goddard role, the movie falls ﬂat mainly because of Lewis’ mugging, in what is more or less the\n\n30\n\nCOMEDY-HORROR FILMS\n\nWillie Best role. As is pointed out in The Encyclopedia of Horror Movies, the ﬁlm turns into “a witless mess stretched very thin.”\n\nYou’ll Find Out A less successful comedy-horror ﬁlm was released later the same year as The Ghost Busters, but it had a blockbuster cast: Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi and Peter Lorre. The starring role, however, went to big band leader Kay Kyser, a hugely popular radio star. His “Kay Kyser’s Kollege of Musical Knowledge” ran for eleven years on NBC Radio, and his zany persona foreshadowed the acts of such future off-the-wall bandleaders as Spike Jones. Part quiz show, part big band concert, his program, which featured such loonies as Ish Kabibble (real name: Merwyn Bogue) and Harry Babbitt, was at the height of its popularity when his second ﬁlm for RKO, You’ll Find Out, went into production. Its plot is pretty basic: Helen Parrish plays Janis Bellacrest, a young heiress who inherits the requisite old dark house. Unfortunately, there are those who would like to bump her off for that inheritance, and thereby hangs the rather slight tale. Karloff is a judge, Lugosi a swami complete with turban and Lorre is a scientist. As it turns out, however, they’re all crooks trying to get at Parrish’s fortune. Somehow, Kyser and his band (all playing themselves) get mixed up in this situation and spend some scary times at the gloomy mansion. The result is a mildly amusing mixture, with the usual thunderstorms and apparent “ghosts.” The three big horror stars are given very little to do but look menacing and are mostly wasted. There’s plenty of time out for singer Ginny Simms to warble some tunes, and originally the three “boogie men” were supposed to have sung the ﬁnal song in the movie, “The Bad Humor Man,” but the ﬁnal ﬁlm has spared us that spectacle. Nevertheless, Kyser is amiable enough onscreen, as is the ﬁlm itself under the direction of David Butler. There are a lot of inside jokes and self-deprecating humor. At one point in the proceedings, Professor Karl Fenninger (Lorre) asks Judge Spencer Mainwaring (Karloff), “Who is this fellow, Kyser?” “Some bandleader,” Mainwaring sniffs. Some of the more interesting moments revolve around the use of a musical instrument called the Sonovox, which makes the human voice sound very weird indeed, almost as if it had been recorded in the grave. The device is something like what seventies rock star Peter Frampton used in his live album many years later, but much creepier. One interesting note of trivia: This was the screen debut of actor Jeff Corey, who has a small role as a quiz show contestant. Corey was later a victim of the McCarthy-era blacklist, which forced him to go into teaching: among his acting students were Jack Nicholson, James Dean and Jane Fonda. When the blacklist was ended, he returned to acting and also went on to direct some of the better episodes of Rod Serling’s Night Gallery in the seventies. You’ll Find Out never travels very far or very fast, but it does have a certain charm, as it’s very much a time capsule of the early forties, featuring excellent examples of the musical and comedic styles of that bygone era. Kyser, almost forgotten now, made seven ﬁlms, but You’ll Find Out remains the best-remembered because of its iconic co-stars.\n\nThe Invisible Woman Earlier in 1940, Universal had produced The Invisible Man Returns with Vincent Price in the starring role. James Whale had exploited the comic possibilities of invisibility in his\n\n3. The Forties\n\n31\n\nadaptation of the Wells story in 1933, although for the most part The Invisible Man had been a rather serious study of the tragedy the abuse of such awesome power could bring to the scientist that Claude Rains portrayed. In the sequel, Price, in his ﬁrst starring role in a horror ﬁlm, played a character more sinned against than sinning. John P. Fulton’s invisibility effects were just as good the second time around, and so Universal employed his expertise once again on The Invisible Woman, released on December 27, 1940. Universal’s trust in Fulton was well founded: He received an Oscar nomination for his special effects. The Invisible Woman is in no way a sequel to either Invisible Man movie before it. Although H.G. Wells gets screen credit for inspiration, the story concocted by Joe May (who had directed The Invisible Man Returns) and Curt Siodmak (creator of The Wolf Man), and the screenplay written by Robert Lees, Frederic I. Rinaldo and Gertrude Purcell, takes off in a completely different direction. The emphasis is on screwball comedy under the direction of A. Edward Sutherland, a specialist in both comedy and horror. In 1933, he had helmed the Lionel Atwill starrer Murders in the Zoo for Paramount; at the time he was asked to direct The Invisible Woman, he had just completed the comedy One Night in the Tropics for Universal. The story revolves around classic absent-minded Professor Gibbs (John Barrymore), who invents a machine that can make living things invisible. Naturally, being a slightly mad scientist, he wants to make people invisible, so he advertises in a newspaper for a volunteer for the experiment. The ad catches the eye of lovely department store model Kitty Carroll (Virginia Bruce), who is the adventurous type and willing to try the experiment so she can get revenge on her former boss, Mr. Growley (Charles Lane), who had ﬁred her. Unfortunately, her plans go awry when three gangsters (Oscar Homolka, Donald MacBride and Shemp Howard) steal the device. As usual, Universal assembled an excellent cast. Margaret Sullavan had originally been scheduled to play the title role, but she backed out at the last minute and the part went to Bruce, a busy and talented actress who had just co-starred in Universal’s sophisticated comedy Hired Wife with Rosalind Russell. Handsome leading man John Howard (who in 1942 would play a werewolf in The Undying Monster for Fox) played Dick Russell, a wealthy attorney who gives the professor ﬁnancial backing for his machine; Charlie Ruggles, who had also been featured in Murders in the Zoo (1933), was cast as Russell’s eternally befuddled butler; Margaret Hamilton, the Wicked Witch of the West herself from 1939’s The Wizard of Oz, was given the fun role of Professor Gibbs’ housekeeper, Mrs. Jackson; and Universal contract players Anne Nagel, Mary Gordon (Mrs. Hudson from the Sherlock Holmes ﬁlms) and Maria Montez also appeared in small roles. The aging Barrymore is charming as the slightly addled professor, a scientist who has never managed to produce anything of use to anyone before inventing his invisibility machine. His delight at his “astounding” discovery is palpable; he can be quite cranky too, as when he delivers a line to his car, admonishing it to “put yourself in the garage, lazy bones!” His performance is that of a great actor, past his prime, who’s having a wonderful time playing a role that he never could have portrayed when he was younger. It’s as if “The Great Proﬁle” has felt a burden lifted and just lets himself go. Howard and Bruce have a nice chemistry together and their scenes reveal why The Invisible Woman was considered to be quite risqué in its day. The strict Hays Code enforced by the Breen Ofﬁce didn’t allow for much eroticism on the screen, but Sutherland and company pushed the envelope as far as they could. The conceit, of course, is that you’re only invisible when you’re naked, and the fact that this time it’s a shapely woman rather than Rains or Price puts a whole new spin on the idea. When Bruce sits in a chair next to Howard and\n\n32\n\nCOMEDY-HORROR FILMS\n\nstarts putting on her stockings, her legs are revealed to Howard and the audience, and the temperature deﬁnitely goes up a bit. This kind of “naughtiness” appealed to audiences of the time, starved as they were for any “adult content” they could get on the screen, and it certainly didn’t hurt the movie’s box ofﬁce. The entire cast seems to be having a good time, which communicates to the viewer. Ruggles does some amusing pratfalls and double takes; Homolka wears a hideous toupee and overacts wildly, using his prodigious eyebrows expressively; and Shemp Howard is, well, Shemp Howard. The Invisible Woman is not a great comedy-horror ﬁlm for the simple reason that there are no truly scary moments. Everything is played for comedy to the extent that there’s no real mood or atmosphere. There are some who might call it more of a comedy–science ﬁction movie rather than a comedy-horror ﬁlm. But it is a part of Universal’s great horror cycle and a gender-bending variation on one of their greatest continuing characters. As such, it was the last word on comic invisibility for a while, at least until Abbott and Costello got into the act. But more on that later.\n\nKing of the Zombies After the extraordinary success of The Ghost Breakers, other studios tried to cash in on Paramount’s box-ofﬁce bonanza, including tiny Monogram Pictures, one of the oldest of the so-called “Poverty Row” production and distribution companies. In their press kit for the 1941 release King of the Zombies, they advised movie exhibitors to sell the movie “along the same lines as The Ghost Breakers.” King of the Zombies was a low-budget affair, so the producers certainly couldn’t afford the likes of Bob Hope. But this worked to the distinct advantage of African-American actor Mantan Moreland, who had been knocking around B-movies and “all-black” features for years. King of the Zombies became his greatest showcase, his only leading role in a “mainstream” feature. Born in Monroe, Louisiana in 1902, Moreland reportedly ran away to join the circus when he was only twelve years old. He was brought back home several times, but his desire to be in show business would not abate and he ended up on the vaudeville stage. Moreland performed on Broadway and in Europe, where he honed his comedy skills. Eventually, he drifted into the ﬁlm business, initially appearing in bit parts playing shoeshine boys and waiters. Due to his superb comedy timing, he soon ended up with larger roles in all-black western parodies such as Harlem on the Prairie (1937) and other ﬁlms that mainly played to segregated audiences, such as the 1942 comedy mysteries Mr. Washington Goes to Town and Professor Creeps, as well as mainstream studio movies in which he was usually cast as a terriﬁed, cowardly manservant who inevitably ran away from ghosts, gangsters, monsters or whatever the script called for. Servile roles were pretty much all that African-American actors could hope for in those days, at least for the major studios. But unlike Stepin’ Fetchit and Sleep ’N’ Eat (aka Willie Best), Moreland had higher comedic aspirations. His characters were often smarter than the white leads, and certainly more energetic. Monogram was one of the few studios to see Moreland’s potential as a comic actor. The studio executives put him under contract to appear opposite white actor Frankie Darro in a series of eight mystery comedies, starting with Irish Luck (1939). His character name, Jeff Jefferson, was a moniker that Moreland often used in his Monogram ﬁlms.\n\n3. The Forties\n\n33\n\nUltimately, Moreland became best known as Birmingham Brown, chauffeur to Sidney Toler’s Charlie Chan in the long-running series that Monogram took over from 20th Century-Fox in 1944. He appeared in no less than ﬁfteen ﬁlms in the series, beginning with Charlie Chan in the Secret Service (1944). Toler’s health gradually declined and he died midway through the series; the ﬁnal six ﬁlms starred Roland Winters as the Asian detective, who was never once portrayed by an Asian. But it was King of the Zombies that allowed Moreland the opportunity to really show off his talent to an “integrated” audience. Third-billed in the movie after Dick Purcell and Joan Woodbury, Moreland this time played a character called Jefferson Jackson. It’s his comic timing—and his character’s intelligence—that helps to elevate King of the Zombies far above the usual Monogram fare. Moreland’s Jackson is a valet to two pilots (Purcell and John Archer) whose plane crashes on an uncharted island. When Jackson regains consciousness, he ﬁnds he’s propped up against a tombstone upon which are engraved the words “Rest in Peace.” Muttering to himself, “They sure don’t waste no time around here!” he is happy to meet up with his comrades, who assure him that he isn’t dead. “I thought I was a little off-color to be a ghost,” he remarks. “Off-color” is a pretty good description of the humor, but thanks to Moreland’s smooth and perfectly timed delivery, even the politically incorrect lines seem innocent. One may wince at the stereotypes, but it’s wise to bear in mind that white actors in comedy-horror ﬁlms frequently played cowardly heroes as well. The fact is, Jackson is in many respects the most intelligent character in King of the Zombies; he’s the one who ﬁgures out what’s going on once they take refuge in a mansion owned by one Dr. Sangre (Henry Victor). It soon becomes apparent to Jackson that the mansion is a hotbed of zombies and voodoo. Although the ﬁlm was released on May 14, 1941, months before America entered World War Two, King of the Zombies features an apparent Nazi villain. Victor, in a role originally intended for Bela Lugosi or Peter Lorre (neither of whom could commit to the ﬁlm), speaks in German on his radio transmissions. He claims to be from Austria, but we know better. The presskit for the ﬁlm describes Dr. Sangre as “a secret agent for a European government.” A B-ﬁlm it may be, but it was slightly ahead of its time. Of course, director Jean Yarbrough and writer Edmond Kelso had no intention of making political commentary; they were just crafting entertainment for the masses. And it’s safe to say that both black and white audiences got a kick out of King of the Zombies. It’s the AfricanAmerican character who saves the day here while the white characters remain pretty clueless. Once Jackson bonds with the pretty maid played by Marguerite Whitten, there’s a lot of subtle (and not-so-subtle) subversion of white culture going on. When you consider the fact that a black character causes the downfall of a Nazi, well, the implications speak for themselves. Along the way, the actors (and the audience) have a lot of fun. At one point, Jackson is apparently hypnotized by Sangre into becoming a zombie. But the subtext is that he may be merely pretending to be hypnotized. “Move over, boys,” he says to the other zombies, “I’m one of the gang now.” By the end of the ﬁlm, however, he has the situation well in hand and declares, “If there’s one thing I don’t want to be twice, zombies is both of ’em!” Moreland did show up in another Monogram zombie ﬁlm called Revenge of the Zombies in 1943, but it wasn’t a comedy-horror ﬁlm and it wasn’t nearly as good as King of the Zombies. After all, King of the Zombies was Oscar-nominated for its music score! The music by Edward J. Kay is actually quite good, especially for a low-budget “quickie.”\n\n34\n\nCOMEDY-HORROR FILMS\n\nMoreland hit his cinematic peak with his recurring role in the Charlie Chan series, although the character wasn’t what one would call three-dimensional. Birmingham Brown was forever warning his employer, Chan, not to venture into danger; but again, as in King of the Zombies, he was usually right. By the ﬁfties, audiences became uncomfortable with racial stereotypes in ﬁlms, especially when the civil rights movement really got going in America beginning in the middle of the decade. Moreland, Stepin’ Fetchit, Willie Best and others had a hard time ﬁnding employment and found themselves ostracized by Hollywood. By the late sixties, Moreland made a minor comeback on television, even working with big-time celebrities such as Carl Reiner, Bill Cosby and Godfrey Cambridge. Alas, the timing was poor; by this time, Moreland was suffering from the after-effects of a stroke; he died of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1973. Mantan Moreland, a pioneering African-American performer, was buried in Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery near Hollywood.\n\nThe Black Cat In 1941, Universal, for no particular reason, decided to do another version of Edgar Allan Poe’s The Black Cat, which they had already done in 1934 as a vehicle for Karloff and Lugosi.
