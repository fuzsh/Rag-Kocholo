Massively reduced recidivism. A growing roster of TLM partner organizations. And the unlocked potential of TLM alumni, whose lives have been transformed by their successes.\n\nPartnerships\n\nLeveraging Content and Technology Partners\n\nOur partners span many sectors, but they all embrace the idea that their core content and domain expertise can be valuable to those who donâ€™t have proper access to premium educational content. Research has shown that education and career training directly impact reduced recidivism rates and increased job placement opportunities.\n\nProgram Growth\n\nThe Expansion of TLM\n\nOur work began in San Quentin, where we successfully implemented a Business and Technology Accelerator program. The emphasis was on creating a curriculum focused on market-ready technical skills. The acceptance of the program by the students and Corrections officials was immediate, permanent, and successful. TLM training is now offered in 13 facilities across seven states."
