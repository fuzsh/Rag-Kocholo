        "text": "The CompTIA A+ Core Series requires candidates to pass two exams: Core 1 (220-1101) and Core 2 (220-1102) covering the following new content, emphasizing the technologies and skills IT pros need to support a hybrid workforce:\n\nIncreased reliance on SaaS applications for remote work\n\nHow to remotely diagnose and correct common software, hardware or connectivity problems\n\nEvolving core technologies from cloud virtualization and IoT device security to data management and scripting\n\nMultiple operating systems, when to use them and how to keep them running properly\n\nReflects the changing nature of the job, including how to assess if it’s best to fix something on site, or send it to a specialized provider\n\nCompTIA A+ is compliant with ISO 17024 standards and approved by the U.S. DoD to meet Directive 8140.03M requirements. Regulators and governments rely on ANSI accreditation because it provides confidence and trust in the outputs of an accredited program. Over 3 million CompTIA ISO/ANSI-accredited exams have been delivered since January 1, 2011.\n\nKeep your certification up to date with CompTIA’s Continuing Education (CE) program. It’s designed to be a continued validation of your expertise and a tool to expand your skill set. It’s also the ace up your sleeve when you’re ready to take the next step in your career.\n\nGet the most out of your certification\n\nInformation technology is an incredibly dynamic field, creating new opportunities and challenges every day. Participating in our Continuing Education program will enable you to stay current with new and evolving technologies and remain a sought-after IT expert.\n\nThe CompTIA Continuing Education program\n\nYour CompTIA A+ certification is good for three years from the day of your exam. The CE program allows you to extend your certification in three-year intervals through activities and training that relate to the content of your certification. Like A+ itself, CompTIA A+ CE also carries globally-recognized ISO/ANSI accreditation status.\n\nIt’s easy to renew\n\nYou can participate in a number of activities and training programs, including higher certifications, to renew your CompTIA A+ certification. Complete CertMaster CE, an online, self-paced CE course, or collect at least 20 Continuing Education Units (CEUs) in three years, upload them to your certification account, and A+ will automatically renew.\n\nWant more details?
