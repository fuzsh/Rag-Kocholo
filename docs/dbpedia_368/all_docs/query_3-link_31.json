        "text": "With a reported $200 million budget for \"Folie à Deux,\" the stakes couldn't be higher.\n\nHere's everything we know about the \"Joker\" sequel.\n\nThe 'Joker 2' cast includes Phoenix and Gaga, plus some new faces\n\nDeadline reported in 2022 that Zazie Beetz would reprise her role as Sophie Dumond in the sequel. In the first film, her character, a single mom who lives in the same apartment as Arthur, seems like Arthur's love interest until a major plot twist reveals that their budding romance is a figment of Arthur's imagination.\n\nDeadline later reported several more actors who landed roles in \"Joker 2\": Brendan Gleeson (\"The Banshees of Inisherin\"), Catherine Keener (\"Being John Malkovich\"), and Harry Lawtey (\"Industry\").\n\nThe trailer for \"Folie à Deux\" also revealed that actor and comedian Steve Coogan has a surprise role in the movie.\n\nThe sequel is a musical and will reportedly include at least 15 covers of popular songs\n\nThe first trailer showed Arthur and Harley dancing on rooftops, stages, and the streets of Gotham City. According to Variety, the movie will be \"mostly a jukebox musical,\" and contain at least 15 new versions of \"very well-known\" tracks.\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"Joker 2\" being a musical isn't too far out of left-field considering the first film contained musically driven moments like Phoenix's villain memorably dancing on a set of stairs in the Bronx.\n\n\"I think people will be surprised. I don't think it's going to be what they expect, around it being musical,\" Beetz told Variety in June. \"We all sort of express musically and dancing in our lives day-to-day. I think it's going to work really well.\"\n\nDirector Phillips shared similar comments at CinemaCon when asked if the movie is a musical.\n\n\"We never really talked about it like that, but I like to say it's a film where music is an essential element. To me, that doesn't veer too far from the first film,\" he said. \"Arthur's weird and aloof and all these things\"\n\n\"That informed a lot of the dancing in the first film... it didn't feel like that big of a step here,\" he added. \"It's different, but I think it'll make sense when you see it.\"\n\nThe 'Joker 2' plot will focus on the Joker's romance with Harley Quinn\n\n\"Joker\" centered on Arthur's descent into villainy after becoming disillusioned by his life as a struggling comedian in Gotham City. At the end of the film, he is locked up in Arkham Asylum and is seen speaking with a social worker.\n\nPlot details surrounding \"Joker 2\" remain tightly under wraps, but the first trailer shows Arthur and Harley's first meeting at Arkham Asylum. Unlike the comics, though, this version of Harley is a fellow inmate, not Arthur's psychiatrist, at the asylum. After presumably breaking out of the asylum together, the pair are seen dancing and causing mayhem in town.\n\nThe 'Joker: Folie à Deux' release date is Friday, October 4\n\nThe film arrives in theaters this fall.\n\nImax CEO Richard Gelfond told Business Insider's Jason Guerrasio at CinemaCon that \"Joker 2\" will also be available to watch in Imax 70mm — a format typically reserved for large-scale movies directed by filmmakers like Christopher Nolan and Denis Villeneuve.\n\nThis is a developing story. Check back for updates."
