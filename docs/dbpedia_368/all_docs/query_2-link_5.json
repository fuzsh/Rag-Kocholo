        "text": "A medical coder translates details from a patientâs medical documents, such as physician's notes, lab reports, procedures, and diagnoses into universal medical codes to maintain accurate medical records. Healthcare providers and insurance companies use these standardized codes for billing and record-keeping.\n\nThis administrative role is an important one within the in-demand healthcare industry. Learn more about what a medical coder does and whether this career path is right for you.\n\nWhat is medical coding?\n\nMedical coding is the process of taking a patientâs health care information like medical procedures, diagnosis, necessary medical equipment, and medical services information from the physician's notes. A medical coder transforms this information into universal medical alphanumeric codes.Â\n\nThere are three types of universally known medical alphanumeric codes:Â\n\nInternational Classification of Diseases (ICD): The World Health Organization (WHO) created this internationally used code. The classification system is largely used for the purpose of health recording and data collection, among other uses. These codes can classify symptoms, diseases, illnesses, and causes of death.Â\n\nCurrent Procedural Terminology (CPT): CPT codes identify medical, surgical, and diagnostic procedures and services within the US. The American Medical Association (AMA) developed this system, which includes three categories: procedures and contemporary medical practices, clinical labs, and emerging technologies.Â\n\nHealthcare Common Procedure Coding (HCPCS): The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) developed this coding system to help with processing insurance claims for Medicare or other providers. Coders use them to note medical procedures, products, supplies, and services.Â\n\nMedical coding's primary use is to ensure medical billing and insurance carriers pay and process claims correctly, but the system is also valuable for research purposes and basic medical record-keeping for patients.\n\nEach code tells insurance companies, researchers, and health care providers the exact diagnosis, procedure, and/or medical service provided. In short, these codes act as a universal way to quantify health care visits and make physicianâs notes less abstract for insurance carriers and future health providers.Â\n\nResponsibilities of a medical coder\n\nOne of the core responsibilities of a medical coder is to ensure the accuracy of the medical records you transcribe and the codes you use. Other medical coder job requirements include proficiency in a variety of medical codes and adherence to the medical coding code of ethics.\n\nÂ Some of the day-to-day responsibilities of medical coding jobs include:\n\nTranscribing patient information into appropriate medical codesÂ\n\nExamining medical documents and records for missing informationÂ\n\nConducting chart auditsÂ\n\nCollecting, researching, and filing patient medical information\n\nEnsuring all documents are grammatically correctÂ\n\nComplying with medical coding guidelines and policiesÂ\n\nMedical coding salary\n\nA medical coder working in the US makes an average of $46,660 annually or $22.43 an hour [1]. This salary average includes all medical records and health information specialists, so it's possible you can earn more than this average depending on where you work, the certifications you hold, your level of professional experience, and the hours and/or shifts you work.Â\n\nJob outlook\n\nMedical coders are in relatively high demand. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the profession can expect to see a 7 percent growth rate, which is considered average growth. The BLS also predicts an additional 12,300Â jobs will be added between 2021 to 2031 [1].\n\nSkills needed\n\nInsurance carriers, health care providers, and patients all rely on the accuracy of medical records. Therefore attention to detail is a must, as is proficiency in the coding systems you will be using at your particular health care facility.Â\n\nConsider these key skills if you want to become a medical coder:Â\n\nAttention to detail\n\nTime management\n\nHigh ethical standards\n\nOrganizational skillsÂ\n\nPatienceÂ Â\n\nStrong communication skillsÂ\n\nKnowledge or ability to learn software systems quickly\n\nEducation requirements\n\nYou do not need any previous experience in medical coding to become a medical coder; however, many certification programs require at least one year of professional work experience. If you need to gain professional experience prior to certification, consider applying for positions like billing assistant where youâll gain indirect insight into the medical coding process.Â Â\n\nCertifications\n\nA medical coding certification is a credential in health care coding and billing. It shows you've learned a specific medical coding system, or systems, along with the basics of how to translate patient medical data into codes.\n\nIf you choose to earn a medical coding certification, you have many options. You may obtain certification in general coding or a specialty medical coding certification. You can also choose to stack multiple certifications.\n\nThe most important thing to remember is to choose an accredited program such as the Practice Management Institute (PMI), the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA), or the American Academy of Professional Coders (AAPC). Each one of these accredited organizations has its own set of certifications, each with variations in the medical coding system taught and the application (i.e., type of health care facility).\n\nYou can earn general coding certifications like a Certified Medical Coder (CMC) certificate or a Certified Professional Coder (CPC-A) certificate, or a specialty coding certifications such as urology or pediatric care. The certification you choose can help you to achieve your ideal career path.\n\nThough certification is optional in many cases, a study conducted by the American Academy of Professional Coders (AAPC) found that certified medical coders earned 27 percent more than medical coders without certification [2].Â\n\nYou can complete a certification program at any time throughout your career in medical coding. Some people earn their certificate to get a medical coding job while others earn certifications after completing their associate degree. Some people earn their bachelorâs degree, but itâs not typically a requirement.Â Each employer will have its own specific training requirements.Â\n\nHow to become a medical coder\n\nGetting started in medical coding requires the following steps.\n\n1. Meet the basic prerequisites.\n\nThe basic prerequisites for getting a medical coding job are to complete medical coding training. This can be done in the form of an associate degree program in medical coding, a certificate in medical coding from an accredited organization, or on-the-job in-house training by an employer. To be eligible for training, youâll need your high school diploma or GED.Â\n\n2. Complete medical coding training.\n\nIf you are choosing to earn your associate degree in medical coding, look for a reputable program offered at a community college or vocational school. There are in-person and online options.\n\nIf you would rather earn a certificate in medical coding, think about where youâd like to work. Then try to gain professional experience in that particular health care field, as many certificate programs require some prior experience in medical coding and/or an associate degree.\n\n3. Obtain your medical coding certification.Â\n\nYou can obtain your medical coding certification after completing an associate degree in medical coding or with no degree at all. Entry-level certifications can help you get a medical coding job. You can obtain specialty medical coding certifications at any point in your career as a medical coder.
