First, there was a need for a text which would examine an expanded number of genres. The best two genre books on the market, Thomas Schatz Hollywood Genres and Barry K. Grant Film Genre: Theory and Criticism, were limited to six genres, respectively. 1 These numbers were consistent with Stuart M. Kaminsky pioneer work, American Film Genres, which examines approximately eight genres, depending on how one counts Kaminsky's fascination with variations of the crime movie, to which he devotes several chapters. 2 Only slightly larger numbers are addressed in both a more recent Grant anthology, Film Genre Reader (eleven genres, with some of the pieces recycled from his other collection), and Steven C. Earley rather pedestrian An Introduction to American Movies (twelve genres). 3 Thus, the book in hand examines eighteen genres, with much of the increase coming from both a more ambitious look at \"comedy genres\" and the inclusion of such \"nontraditional\" genres as the problem film, the art film, and the biography picture. Other genres included are swashbuckling adventure film, western, gangster film, film noir, World War II combat film (in the category Action/Adventure); horror, science fiction, and fantasy (in The Fantastic); and the musical and the melodrama (in Songs and Soaps). The reasoning behind the order of the chapters in each division is as follows: In the action/adventure section the adventure chapter goes first because it broadly addresses the division, even to the point of mentioning several of the other member genres. The western and gangster chapters follow because of their pivotal positions as archetypal American genres. Film noir is next because it is in part an outgrowth of the gangster film, or more broadly, the crime movie. The World War II combat chapter is last since it is the most specific of the divisions.\n\nThe comedy section saves the most familiar type (the clown genre) for last, -ixand begins with the most often confused--screwball comedy. The three chapters sandwiched in between (populist, parody, and black humor) seem the most natural bridge. For instance, populism follows screwball because the former is sometimes mistaken for the latter, especially in the films of director Frank Capra. Similar and/or other significant factors can be applied to the chapter order of the other divisions, too. For example, in the fantastic category, the genre order (horror, science fiction, fantasy) follows the historical emergence of each as a film genre of study. The same applies, though to a lesser extent, to the divisions of songs and soaps and the nontraditional genres. The need to examine an expanded number of genres seemed most pressing in comedy. There is the tendency for genre authors either to limit their comedy focus to the screwball variety or to simply call comedy the broadest of all genres and proceed to lump every conceivable type into one very overworked chapter. As comedy theorist Jim Leach has observed with humorous insight, \"a genre which encompasses the visions of Jerry Lewisand Ernst Lubitsch is already in trouble.\" 4 He goes on to request a more ambitious examination of the comedy genres, noting what many film comedy enthusiasts have long felt-\"if a genre is defined too loosely (as in the case of 'comedy') it ceases to be of any value as a critical tool.\" 5 This book attempts to address that limitation by devoting five chapters to five different comedy genres: screwball, populist, parody, black, and clown. This is not meant to imply that these are the limit of all possible comedy genres. But the five would seem to represent the most obvious types visible to the student of film humor. Hopefully, they should provide a more thorough framework from which to study and enjoy the varied richness of comedy. Moreover, though chapters were written as autonomous units, they are frequently cross-referenced to better facilitate one's understanding of the comedy issues at hand. Second, there was a need for a more thorough guideline-oriented genre study. To better facilitate reader insight, this volume's formulaic subjects have been showcased in an ambitious, fittingly formulaic manner. That is, each genre chapter is systematically broken into the following sections: a historical/analytical overview, a bibliographical overview of the genre's key literature, a checklist of these texts, and a filmography of the genre's pivotal movies. Such an arrangement assists the reader in comparing different genres and gives him or her a solid, working foundation for further study. Despite that old gag about an anthology editor being someone who spends his time raiding good books, the reader of an essay collection such as this is undoubtedly best served when each contribution is an original piece (though having a common framework), written specifically for a shared goal. Despite this common framework, certain minor variations occur in the chapter structures. For instance, there is some information contrast between filmographies from chapter to chapter. Thus, the horror filmography includes credits\n\n-x for things like special effects or makeup, categories not so central in other film lists. Moreover, the filmographies themselves are limited to the most central movies in each genre. This was done to give the reader with limited time a more selective choice. Because of this, however, movies cited in the text do not always appear in the filmography. Along similar lines, not every source noted in each chapter's bibliographical overview appears in the checklist. For example, references can be brought in for certain points but are not relevant to the focus of the chapter. Or a weak source might be cited in the overview but not listed in what are essentially recommended readings (the checklist). However, a reference in the overview was necessary in order to show its checklist omission was simply not a mistake. This has been a most ambitious project, but it does not purport to be the end-all to the subject at hand. Like all material aiming for insightfulness, its goal is to further challenge the inquisitive mind. Thus, additional genres not included but worthy of possible further consideration would include disaster films, sports movies, and erotic films. The publication of most books merits many thank-yous, and this is especially true of a work such as this. I am most grateful to Marilyn Brownstein, Greenwood Press's humanities editor and the catalyst for this book. Her ideas and support made the volume possible and her sensitive leadership has had an effect on all my Greenwood books. To credit an essay collection as dependent on its contributors is an understatement. The insights of these people fill the pages and quite literally decide the fate of the book and its organizer, hopefully qualifying me for that comic definition of an editor as someone who uses scissors and taste. Thus, they have provided a most happy fate for the reader. All contributors are proven scholars who have fine-tuned their ideas in the classroom, the ultimate liberal arts laboratory (see the About the Contributors section). Moreover, in an age frequently driven by the philosophy of \"What's in it for me?,\" these teacher/ scholars set pencil to paper out of an obligation to that most sacred of human enterprises--the exchange of ideas. Significant thank-yous are just not possible. With regard to my own genre chapter contributions, these were built upon a lifelong fascination with comedy which started with the humor of my father and both grandfathers. Laughter is very special in my family. Through the years and the books, so many people have helped me that I would need a second volume to list them all. However, I would be remiss if I did not credit the staffs of six archives--the Library of Congress (especially the divisions of Motion Pictures, Copyright, and Manuscripts), the Billy Rose Theatre Collection of the New York Public Library at Lincoln Center, the Research Annex of the New York Public Library (521 West 43rd Street), the Museum of Modern Art's Department of Film ( New York), the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Library (Beverly Hills), and the American Film Institute (Beverly Hills).\n\nCloser to home, additional thank-yous are in order for the strong support of -xi my department chairman, John Kurtz, and my teaching colleague, Darrel Wible; Janet Warmer, my typist and general troubleshooter; and Vera McCoskey, interlibrary loan librarian at Ball State University's Bracken Library. Further acknowledgments are in order for the support and suggestions of family, friends (in particular, Conrad Lane and Joe Pacino), colleagues (especially the professional conferences where early versions of several comedy chapters were presented), and students (particularly, members of my annual American Film comedy seminars). I wish also to credit humor scholar Larry Mintz, who besides supporting my comedy writing through the years, indirectly influenced this book by his recent editing of Humor in America: A Research Guide to Genres and Topics. 6 His request of an overview chapter on American film comedy better helped me prepare for the writing of this volume's comedy chapters. And because of the earlier inception of his book, and my involvement therein, I was privy to an ongoing, mini workshop on editing. Finally, my family merits a truckload of praise for their patience, understanding, and advice through all the mini-crises that constitute editing and writing a book. NOTES 1.

GEHRING \"All this has happened before. And it will all happen again.\" So begins one of my daughter's fairy tales, and it is a fitting description of the genre film. Genre is a French word for a literary type. In film study it represents the division of movies into groups which have similar subjects and/or themes. Sometimes this is an easy task, when your genre is of a given time and place, such as the western. From film frame one it is generally obvious you are in the American West of the second half of the nineteenth century, especially when you are bombarded with more western icons (ten-gallon hats, six-guns, etc.) than you would be in a Zane Grey museum. Some genres are not so immediately obvious. For instance, screwball comedy is not limited to one period and place, although it is often set in the present in the milieu of the idle rich. This genre is more defined by the eccentric courtship of the screwball couple. Sister genres would include the musical and the melodrama--again, types not dependent on a given time and place and readily recognizable icons. Historically, genre lineage can be traced back to the seemingly always intellectually present Poetics of Aristotle, wherein the literature of the day was broken down into types. Thus, for much of the recorded history of man, varying formulaic genre guidelines have been present and growing, though not without detractors. This is best exemplified by the nineteenth-century Romantic movement, which felt the genre structure limited the artist, as did most rules. The still popular notion that \"the artist\" must create something entirely new each time stems from this. The significance of genre stories, however, long predates the Poetics, and might just be addressed by repeating a question which frequently surfaces in genre study: Why does an audience member keep returning to a favored story -1type (genre) which a formalistic structure often makes predictable? Such repetition would seem a bit irrational, rather like the joke with which Woody Allen closes Annie Hall ( 1977): A guy tells his psychiatrist that his brother believes himself to be a chicken. When the doctor asks, \"Why don't you turn him in?\" he receives the reply, \"I would, but I need the eggs.\"\n\nThe genre fan seems \"egged on\" by man's need for the repetitive reaffirmation of certain ritualistic experiences, such as good triumphing over evil, the promise of finding the perfect love, the comic underdog winning--things which do not occur so frequently, if at all, in real life. Even in the case of a genre like black comedy, where the absurdity and ugliness of both man and the modern world are directly addressed in dark, or sick, humor, genre helps one cope through laughter. Multifaceted viewer catharses are a genre given. Thus, the need for the ritualistic experience is as old as man and the first oral tales shared around primitive campfires. Despite today's sophisticated hightech wrappings, genre entertainment would seem to fulfill the most ancient of needs. There are seven key reasons to pursue genre study. The first and most compelling is at the heart of all liberal arts education--to provide both a systematic overview of mankind's masterworks while providing personal insight for the individual. To what genre(s) do you most frequently return? Why? What primal messages, or assurances, are provided by your genre(s)? Second, as with any schematic approach to the arts, genre study helps one organize the ever burgeoning number of films--categorizing them into smaller, more manageable groups. An added plus for the genre approach is that it is probably the classification system most familiar to viewers. While they may have never formally articulated this before, most people have some definite expectations concerning at least the most mainstream of genres, such as the western and the gangster film (genres often considered the most inherently American). After all, through the years much of the Hollywood product--the \"canned\" goods, if you will--has been produced and marketed along genre lines. Using a popular model as a production guideline is an old and efficient way of doing things. It is for that reason that genre theorist Barry K. Grant's description of genre movies as the \"Model T's\" of popular entertainment has about it the perfect tongue-in-cheek appropriateness. 1 Bear in mind, however, that thorough genre study also takes one beyond formulaic fundamentals and reveals all the creatively complex options still available. These might be specific variations on a ritualistic experience or the broad impact some auteurs have had on a given genre model, such as directors John Ford on the western and Howard Hawks on screwball comedy. In fact, genre study has often been the chief beneficiary of any number of auteur works because the focus director was invariably identified with a specific genre. Third, genre study also acts as a natural corollary to what celebrated nineteenth-century literary critic Matthew Arnold called the \"touchstone\" method-producing a guide to what the reader/viewer can expect from a given work, or in this case, genre. 2 Since few people have the viewing opportunities of the -2 film critic, genre analysis steers one to the pivotal examples of whatever genre(s) one might prefer.\n\nFourth, because even watershed films rarely encapsulate everything there is to know about a given movie type, genre study also allows one both to better appreciate the significant elements of the individual film and to examine other viable directions it could have taken, subjects which might not readily be apparent without a broader understanding of the parent genre itself. Fifth, genre study keeps one alive to the cultural changes forever taking place in the world at large. That is, genre analysis frequently operates on a contradiction. It is very much formulaic but at the same time must be flexible enough to incorporate the ongoing changes affecting all genres. Such changes would include the undercurrent of paranoia over communist witch-hunting which surfaced in 1950s science fiction films or the Vietnam antiestablishment 1960s and the emergence of the antihero in most traditional genres (especially the western), not to mention the evolution of black comedy as a mainstream genre itself. At the risk of sounding blasphemous, even pioneer genre writings by pivotal film critics like Robert Warshow (on the western and the gangster film) and James Agee (on comedy) are not without some restrictiveness. Warshow has problems with My Darling Clementine ( 1946), Kiss of Death ( 1947), High Noon ( 1952), and Shane ( 1953); Agee has reservations about comedy outside the silent era. 3 Genre criticism exists as a guide for the inquiring mind (highlighting recurring patterns of cultural significance in the arts), not as a dictator of said patterns. As influential genre author John G. Cawelti has observed, \"When genre critics forget that their supertexts are critical artifacts and start treating them as prescriptions for artistic creation, the concept of genre becomes stultifying and limiting.\" 4 Sixth, to the ongoing credit of Warshow and Agee, however, as well as André Bazin and those who have followed, genre criticism has given credibility to the study of popular culture. Most specifically for the book in hand, this has meant the elevation in importance of the Hollywood studio film. Whereas its genre product was once often considered merely interchangeable links of entertainment sausage squeezed out of a fun factory, today's film historian is capable of such hosannas as comparing the Hollywood studio era to the days of Elizabethan repertory theater companies, most famous for a playwright named Shakespeare. 5 This is called high praise. To put it even more succinctly, one has only to recycle the title of film scholar Gerald Weales's excellent book on a portion of the studio period--Canned Goods as Caviar. 6 Yes, things have changed greatly since 1939, often considered the watershed year of studio creativity, when a young but already celebrated Hollywood director named William Wellman kidded an academic-oriented film audience with the observation: \"Cinema appreciation . . . must be rather like going to school to learn the aesthetic differences between a Pontiac and an Oldsmobile.\" 7 Of course, the nature of popular culture has also changed greatly in the intervening -3 years, which leads one to the next and possibly most startling point for genre study.\n\nSeventh, genre criticism is now starting to act as a bridge between the mainstream popular film and the art film, the latter probably still most closely associated with Swedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman, whose 1950s films so helped create a demand for these more personalized works--such as The Seventh Seal ( 1956) and Wild Strawberries ( 1957). Traditionally, the art film has been considered a nongenre movie because recurring characters and themes were not as readily apparent. However, a marriage has now taken place between the popular film and art cinema. This has accompanied the 1950s decline of the studio system with the emergence of numerous, influential art house European auteurs, especially those associated with the French New Wave (see this volume's parody chapter); a new wave, most specifically François Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard, whose films still managed to pay homage to traditional Hollywood genres; the rise of a 1960s young, antiestablishment audience--complemented by the real arrival of film studies on college campuses; and the materialization since the 1960s of American directors pursuing art house themes (from Arthur Penn to Woody Allen). William C. Siska, author of the art film chapter in this volume, pinpoints Annie Hall ( 1977) as the \"crossover film\" from which this union can be dated. Indeed, one might say Allen tested the popular film-art cinema market even earlier with Love and Death ( 1975), his critically and commercially successful parody of the art film, as well as high art in general (see the parody chapter). Consequently, the application of genre study has come full circle, from credibility for the mainstream popular film to a recognition of its increasing ties with art cinema. In addition, revisionist film theorists are even starting to redefine some popular film products along art film lines, such as Dudley Andrew's provocative claiming of the Frank Capra Middle America film Meet John Doe ( 1941) in his book Film in the Aura of Art. 8 These have been the seven key reasons to pursue genre study. No doubt, additional factors could be cited. But one then begins to court the overkill factor that once inspired the definition of a film censor as \"someone who even sees three meanings in a double-entendre.\" Suffice it to say that genre criticism has become an important tool in the ongoing study of film. And regardless of what the future holds, genre analysis in some form (such as the recent fascination with the more complex \"compound genre\"; see the parody chapter) will continue to exist because \"All this has happened before. And it will all happen again.\" NOTES 1. Barry K.

There are no \"adventure\" films as such, but the term loosely connects a number of more specific genres, all dealing with \"adventures,\" but particularized by certain plot formulas, settings, character networks, icons, and conventions of action which together mark out the range of this category. Most observers include the swashbuckler or sword-fighting picture, the war film or military combat film, the safari or jungle\n\nfilm, and the disaster film under the adventure rubric. Although these groups of films may appear a disparate lot, their patterns of action and character relationships display characteristics which clearly link them together and distinguish them from other genres. In one sense, all non-comic genre films are based on the structure of the romance of medieval literature: a protagonist either has or develops great and special skills and overcomes insurmountable obstacles in extraordinary situations to successfully achieve some desired goal, usually the restitution of order to the world invoked by the narrative. The protagonists confront the human, natural, or supernatural powers that have improperly assumed control over the world and eventually defeat them. This pattern, though found in other genres like the western, the sports film, or the horror film, is most clearly visible in those films conventionally understood as adventure films--the swashbuckler, the war film, safari/jungle epic, and the survival film. In these films mankind is depicted as living in a world fraught with perils of all kinds, but through the -9exemplary effort, cooperation, and bravery of individuals and groups, the social order, without which man would perish, is maintained against all threats to its stability. And yet it is the very hallmark of the adventure films that they give free play to activities which are outside the normal framework of the everyday world, taking place as they do in situations and settings in which social restraints upon the characters are minimal. Hence the key factor which identifies the adventure film is that its characters and their conflicts are located in the romantic past or in an inhospitable place in the present or in the midst of a large-scale war or in some sort of isolation from ordinary life. Adventure films need that sort of distance from the everyday world in order to maximize the dangers and thus to increase the magnitude of the efforts of the characters. If they succeed or fail, it must be on a stage larger than life, a place where heroes can perform splendid deeds, where nobility can be tested by adversity. The exotic settings and flamboyant actions of the characters in adventure films also provide wonderful opportunities for filmic presentation. Spectacle-the depiction of wide vistas of the geography of faraway places, frames full of colorful costumes, masses of people, animals, and objects--playing out events of epic proportions, in and of itself, is a central feature of the adventure genre. Simply seeing this plenitude is one of the pleasures inherent in all film, and nowhere is this pleasure more amply produced than in adventure films. Whether it is the sight of pirate ships booming over the waves, their sails filled with a driving wind, a safari trekking over the steaming veldt, or two armies clashing on a plain, the adventure film provides inherent spectacle. D. W. Griffith knew the appeal of such spectacle. His use of the long shot of battles and his focus on the movement of rescues and chases in Birth of a Nation and Intolerance impressed audiences. Although one could claim both of these films as the archetype of the adventure\n\nfilm in feature-length form, it was not until the 1920s that adventure films became a recognizable genre. Douglas Fairbanks in such films as The Mark of Zorro ( 1920), The Three Musketeers ( 1921), and The Thief of Bagdad ( 1924) almost single-handedly invented and popularized the swashbuckler, while Rudolph Valentino added voluptuous romance to the formula of the dashing hero in his films. AntiGerman war films abounded during World War I, but made a resurgence later in the 1920s. The Big Parade ( 1925), What Price Glory? ( 1926), and Wings ( 1927) were very popular. Visual spectacle made all forms of the adventure film a natural for silent movies. And yet the addition of sound added a dimension which amplified all of the spectacle previously only available to the eye by adding spoken dialogue, sound effects, and music to fill out and expand the power of the image. Though films featuring Tarzan, lord of the jungle, had been made in the silent period, the trumpeting of elephants, the jibbering of monkeys, and the echoing cry of Tarzan himself increased the exotic effect. The authentic sound of cannons, ma-10chine guns, and airplane motors made war films sound as death defying as they looked. And swashbucklers gained immensely from the sound of sword on sword, the crashing of waves, and the strains of melodramatic music during moments of intense conflict. An essential part of the adventure formula is a stirring speech, a call to action by the hero as he rallies his comrades around him. Synchronized dialogue made this possible. During the 1930s the framework of the adventure film was formalized within the context of sound; the basic patterns remained the same throughout the studio years of the 1940s and the 1950s, changing little until the 1960s. This is the \"classic\" period of Hollywood production in which all genres evolved somewhat in response to changes in society, yet maintained an overall consistency. As the studio system dissolved, however, audience acceptance of the tried-and-true formulas waned. From the 1960s to the present, the adventure film dramatically changed its tone. Except for the disaster films of the early 1970s which treated their premises with sincerity, most modern adventure films suggest irony or parody of their basic tenets. For example, The Three Musketeers, based on the Dumas novel, had been made essentially as conventional sword and swagger adventure in 1933, 1948, and 1951 (even Edwin S. Porter had produced an hour-long version in 1912). Richard Lester 1974 Three Musketeers, however, was clearly an attempt to show the famous swordsmen as vain, obtuse, stupid, brawling hooligans, paid mercenaries of a vapid king, engaged in petty duels while the social order crumbled around them, and not as the noble heroes of romantic fiction. In short, Lester's treatment of the genre was antiheroic. This is not to say that the adventure film in its classic form is no longer a viable entity. In 1974, the same year as Lester film, Richard Chamberlain appeared in The Count of Monte Cristo, a made-for-television film which had little trace of irony. He also appeared in a theatrical remake of King Solomon's Mines in 1985 which was also treated conventionally. And the glorious achievements of American servicemen were noted without parody in the Rambo films made by Sylvester Stallone. The story of Indiana Jones in Raiders of the Lost\n\nArk ( 1981), though given a peculiar nostalgic note by being set in the past, appeared at least on one level to be doing the expected: thrilling the audience with countless hairbreadth escapes and dynamic chases. 2 There is no way to predict audience response where genre films are concerned. Sometimes the standard, classic formula, treated with respect, may prove successful. At other times parody and irony capture viewers' imaginations. Perhaps it is safe to say that the potential for irreverence is always present in the world of genre films. Mack Sennett's comedians parodied all the romantic heroes and genres of the silent era, even as the serious films found their audiences. In fact, the same person could thrill to the exploits of Douglas Fairbanks one week, and laugh hysterically at Will Rogers humorously imitating Fairbanks the next. Let us look first at the standard form of the adventure film, to examine its -11patterns of action and character networks in order to discover how the genre works in the first place, and then see what elements in the standard formula lend themselves to irony and parody. As noted earlier, the adventure genre is really a grouping of several more well-defined genres--the swashbuckler, the war film, the safari film, and the survival film. Despite their surface differences in topography, costumes, time periods, and iconography, two major plot structures are clearly discernible. One focuses on the lone hero--the swashbuckler, the explorer who searches for the golden idol, the great hunter who leads the expedition, the lord of the jungle--and the other focuses on a hero interacting with a microcosmic group-the sergeant of a patrol, the leader of a squadron, the person who leads a group of castaways out of danger and back to civilization. The lone hero pattern is most obvious in the swashbuckler. There a decent, law-abiding member of a society (as in nearly all adventure films, a male figure, although there is at least one pirate film in which the protagonist is a female) is cast into the role of outlaw because the society in which he lives has been corrupted from within: a tryannical ruler has come to power and bent law and order to his own selfish ends in Captain Blood ( 1935) and The Adventures of Robin Hood ( 1938), or some social injustice has put the hero in an adversary position to the prevailing social order as in Scaramouche ( 1952) and the three sound versions of The Prisoner of Zenda ( 1937, 1952, 1979). Once outlawed, the hero makes every effort to restore order to society. Sometimes this means literally placing the absent or kidnapped ruler on the throne by overthrowing the false regent; sometimes it is enough that the hero, through his actions, reminds the society that it is time to reexamine its institutions and cast out the people who have been corrupting them. For the most part, there is no attempt at changing those institutions. The prevailing social structure is never questioned. In this respect, the swashbuckler is extremely conservative. If kings rule, that is just fine as long as they are decent kings. In Captain Blood, Errol Flynn rebels against constituted authority only when it is clear that James II of England is a tyrant. Later, when he learns that a new king, William of\n\nOrange, has accepted the throne, Flynn gives up privateering and patriotically enlists to serve under the new, presumably benign rule. In The Scarlet Pimpernel ( 1934) the revolutionaries of France are depicted as villains, whereas the aristocrats are shown to be the representatives of a proper, well-organized, humane, law-abiding society who need to be rescued from the brutish rabble. Political stability and the status quo of traditional social structures are prominent values of this genre. Nevertheless, before the end of the swashbuckler, the hero--invariably of noble blood and descended from an aristocratic family--must become a part of the masses. After recognizing the injustice of his society, the hero separates himself from his peers and allies himself with the poor and the downtrodden, the tortured and the imprisoned. The hero dramatically moves from aristocracy to democracy and thus represents a paradox of the genre. Never fully assimi-12 lating himself into the common herd, always flamboyant and marked by his superior intelligence, grace, and fighting skills, he still expresses the notion that all men can treat each other equally, that distinctions between men based on rank, privilege, and birth are outmoded and unjust in themselves. Robin Hood leaves Locksley Hall and joins his merry men in the forest and stresses egalitarianism. Scaramouche joins a troupe of traveling players and becomes an actor, a member of a profession that absorbs all talented individuals no matter what their backgrounds might be. Captain Blood becomes a common prisoner aboard a slave ship where he is thrown in with men from all walks of life. Frequently the hero's democratic guise creates one of the stumbling blocks to successful union with the heroine, who usually is aristocratic. The romantic subplot of most swashbucklers is surprisingly like the main plot of a romantic comedy--the male and female meet, hate and distrust each other after an initial attraction, bicker and argue throughout the film, and finally resolve their differences at the end in a marriage or the promise of one--except that the hero must rescue the heroine from physical danger at least once during the course of the film. Repelled by the brusqueness of the hero's approach at first, the swashbuckler heroine comes to realize that moral value and social value are represented by action and intent and not by the superficial trappings of title, wealth, costume, or manners. When the heroine has come to understand this proposition, the hero can throw off his democratic disguise and reenter the aristocracy. The two will wed and create a better society, one which retains all the best of the old rules but will ensure that those rules be administered fairly and justly. In addition to the connection with romantic comedy, the swashbuckler shares certain elements with the musical comedy where the hero is also defined as much by his physical expressiveness as by his good deeds. Many of the directors who made swashbucklers also were known for their musicals, and it is easy to see similarities in function and structure between sword fights and dance numbers. George Sidney, for example, directed musicals like Anchors Aweigh ( 1945), Showboat ( 1951), and Kiss Me, Kate ( 1953), and in the same period swashbucklers like The Three Musketeers ( 1948), Scaramouche ( 1952), and Young Bess ( 1953). Gene Kelly plays a song-and-dance man\n\nand a swashbuckling hero in Singin' in the Rain ( 1952) where the connection between the two styles is made comically clear when the film-within-the-film Kelly is making changes its title from \"The Dueling Cavalier\" to \"The Dancing Cavalier.\" Dancing and swordplay are linked not merely by choreography but by their emphasis on style. The dancers and the sword fighters who are most graceful deserve to win because physical proficiency is identified with moral value. Although a fine fencer in real life, Basil Rathbone always looks clumsier in his duels with Errol Flynn simply because he is the villain. Unlike the hero in other adventure films, the swashbuckling hero, like a precursor of James Bond, will often distance himself from his actions and situation to comment upon them ironically. Hence the swashbuckler, even in its -13 most serious forms, is very close to self-parody. Because the hero is frequently in disguise, he is a performer aware that he is giving a performance, capable of giving asides to the audience. In the 1948 The Three Musketeers, when Gene Kelly, in the middle of a deadly serious duel, turns a particularly acrobatic somersault and lands neatly, ready to parry an opponent's thrust, it's done not only for the viewer's amusement but for the character's as well. Personal style and a literate self-consciousness are as fundamental a part of this genre as swords, sailing ships, plumed hats, and caskets of jewels. Though he may have helpers or a crew to work with, the hero of biblical epics, tales of spies or test pilots, explorer stories, safari films, jungle pictures, and the swashbuckler, is essentially a loner, one distinguished from the crowd by superior skills and intelligence, a cut above the ordinary man, a hero in the more traditional sense of the term. Not so the hero of the second large category of adventure films-the survival films. In these the hero is a part of a small group, relatively inconspicuous at first, who works with that group to ensure its survival against great odds and then returns to virtual anonymity after the danger is past and the group's safety is secured. The heroes of war films and disaster films are just regular guys who find themselves in jeopardy within a group thrown together by chance--they all find themselves booked on a particular plane or ship or they are assigned to a particular platoon or boot camp. Even when the group is formed by individuals making a choice--they volunteer for a special mission against the enemy or join a famous squadron or outfit-the implication is clear that no one in the group is superior to any other, that is, until the action develops and the challenges and dangers test the mettle of the group's members. Then the primary hero will emerge to do his extraordinary feats, but always within the context of the group. Survival films, located primarily in a contemporary context, have a grimmer tone than those adventure films featuring the lone hero. Because settings, costumes, and situations, as well as heroes, tend to be less exotic and more immediately familiar to the audience, survival films provide fewer opportunities for viewers to romanticize the activities of the characters. After all, everyone knows that \"war is hell!\" and being held hostage by a group of terrorists is no picnic. We know from daily newscasts that these are everyday occurrences. Nevertheless, the underlying structures of the survival film are similar to those of the romance. They both emphasize the heroic triumph\n\nover obstacles which threaten social order and the reaffirmation of predominant social values such as fair play and respect for merit and cooperation. These values are highlighted in the war and disaster film, seen as the essential ingredients which ensure the survival of the group, even more than the physical and mental skills of the protagonist. In fact, the hero's most important function is to instill, and inspire the group to practice, these values, which are important for the perpetuation of society at large. But rather than dealing with society in its largest numbers (the swashbuckler is often about the fate of the country as a whole), the survival films must first identify and isolate a micro-14cosm of the society. Isolation allows the society to test itself and its components in a circumscribed and easily identified arena, and it allows all the myriad obstacles facing society to be represented by one large and dramatic obstacle. A group is isolated in the desert when a plane crashes in The Flight of the Phoenix ( 1966). An overturned ocean liner contains the microcosm of The Poseidon Adventure ( 1972). Prisons, either civilian or military, provide the isolation in such films as Stalag 17 ( 1953), The Great Escape ( 1963), and Escape from Alcatraz ( 1978). An escape and a mode of transportation are combined in The Runaway Train ( 1986) to isolate the group. Almost all war movies contain a natural separation into smaller groups--the squad, the platoon, the company--allowing for the creation of a democratic microcosm containing a wide spectrum of character types and ethnic groups, specifically organized to fulfill clearly defined objectives. Whether it's a special group like the criminals in The Dirty Dozen ( 1967) or an average group as in The Boys in Company C ( 1978), the isolation presents the opportunity for a close examination of the interaction of individuals to each other and the group enterprise. At the beginning of the survival film, the various characters are shown in everyday situations without life-threatening stress. Then the characters are separated from the society as a whole and confronted with the problem of survival. Most of the time in a survival film is spent depicting the process whereby the group, cut off from the securities and certainties of the ordinary support networks of civilized life, forms itself into a functioning, effective unit. People learn that they can't do it alone, that certain members of the group are good at certain tasks, that everyone has moments of doubt, but each in his own way can help. It is interesting to note that even though stereotypes abound--the self-sacrificing mother, the good-hearted prostitute, the loyal nurse, the frail creature reduced to hysterics--women often play a decisive role in the success or failure of the group in survival films. Certainly much more so than in those adventure films based more closely on the romance featuring the lone hero. In fact, it is necessary to lean heavily on the idea of character types to certify the notion that the mini-society of the isolated group is, indeed, representative of the variety and difference that make up any social entity. Any such group is essentially made up of individuals, all primarily interested in their own happiness, success, pleasure, and survival. Indeed, in the course of normal life, these individuals usually see themselves in competition with the others in the society for these values. It is only when disaster strikes that the value of cooperation\n\nand concern for the good of the whole comes into play. Thus the group in a survival film is usually made up of very distinct characters, almost caricatures. We will recognize a range of personal qualities (courage, cowardice, humor, intelligence, selfishness, self-sacrifice and so forth); a range of ethnic, religious, and economic types (the Jew, Catholic, black, Native American, Hispanic, rich snob, redneck populist, and so forth); and a range of skills, either professionally acquired or amateurishly cultivated (the engineer, the computer nerd, the radio \"ham,\" the Olympic swimmer, the pastor, the used-15 car salesman). Such a breadth of social strata allows the viewer to observe a range of behavior, to see played out the many possible ways in which the average social being might respond if placed in similar life-threatening situations. Through identification with the ordinary characters, the viewer can play out potential ways of meeting crises. Clearly all of the skills and qualities which aid in the group's survival are considered positive; those which serve only individual interests are seen as negative. The black marketeer in a wartime prison camp, the coward whose fear makes him desert his post, thereby threatening the safety of others, the bully who uses the isolation of the disaster as a pretext for enlarging his own ego at the expense of the group, all usually experience rejection from the group, if not actual death, for their failure to think of the group's mutual safety first. One of the basic lessons of the survival film is that crisis creates its own democracy; all sorts of persons from all walks of life, socially acceptable under normal circumstances or not--criminals and prostitutes often redeem themselves in these films, witness The Dirty Dozen--have crucial roles to play if they expend themselves to benefit the group and to reaffirm the value of social order. No matter what they've done in the past, they become worthy of praise if they join in the common cause. In all survival films, some members of the microcosm will end up sacrificing themselves for the good of the group. The \"villains\" are those too concerned with personal welfare, or those too intellectual to act swiftly, or too cynical, or too neurotic, who by their actions obstruct the group's aim of reuniting with the larger society. The hero of the survival film comes to the fore because his skills of perseverance, practicality, and leadership are needed by the group, but once the group reenters the larger society, he is willing to disappear into the crowd. Marked by none of the personal style, quick wit, and self-reflexivity of the swashbuckling hero, the survival film hero is always thoughtful and earnest. John Wayne was the perfect actor for such roles. In fact, personal style and idiosyncratic behavior are seen as undesirable qualities in a survival film hero because of their individualistic, antisocial implications. This is the hero who says afterwards, \"Aw, shucks, anybody could have done it. I just did my duty.\" Unlike the swashbuckler, the survival film is less interested in the aloof loner than it is in the ways in which a variety of individuals hinder or contribute to the creation of social order. In either case, however, whether focusing on an individual hero or a microcosmic group's survival, the adventure film always plays out the mythic ideal of social unity. All the abnormal, exotic, excessive activity of individuals is a necessary component to be sure. During the course of an adventure film, the audience can vicariously live out their fantasies of personal prowess and vigorous action in heightened,\n\nemotionally intense, extraordinary situations, and can be moved by images of titanic struggle against the opposing forces which seek disruption--political upheaval, war, disaster--yet the ending, the closure of the adventure, always returns the viewer to the position of social conformity. All the values in the traditional adventure film uphold and reinforce the status -16 quo, the idea of stability and regularity in the workings of the social order. As Aristotle said, man is a social animal and must never lose sight of that fact. The adventure film will always strive to remind us of that precept. BIBLIOGRAPHICAL OVERVIEW Perhaps because the adventure film is an amorphous category, really a catchall for several more specific genres, it is not surprising that there are very few books and articles devoted to adventure films. What is surprising, however, is that except for the war film, there are very few published works worth reading on any of the more specific genres. A major critical book has yet to be written about the safari or jungle film, the swashbuckler, or the disaster film. If the spy film is included as an adventure genre, there is no single book about it either. To be sure, there are popular treatments given over to some of these areas: a book on Tarzan films, for example, and biographies of Errol Flynn and Douglas Fairbanks which contain some useful information about the swashbucklers these actors appeared in. But there has been an amazing neglect of scholarly interest in what has to be, after all, one of the most consistent and popular areas of Hollywood production. Though not limited to a discussion of films exclusively, one book stands out above all the others as an introduction to that \"complex of situations and conflicts\" which constitutes the matrix, the field, of the adventure film. John G. Cawelti's Adventure, Mystery, and Romance ( 1976) covers all forms of presentation--films, literature, and drama--which revolve about the elements listed in his title, paying particular attention to the way these elements are materialized in popular and not high culture forms. Cawelti probes the psychological underpinnings of these stories, how audiences both desire structure and are structured by narratives which revolve around adventure, mystery, and romance modes of expression. He finds the desires of readers and viewers located in the experience of the works which induce and cater to these attributes. Cawelti first makes the observation that the popular mind associates such narratives with violence and sex. Government panels and citizens' groups are always being formed to investigate the effect such depictions have on viewers, usually fearing a negative influence on the impressionable minds of the young. Too much viewing of scenes of violence and sex presumably leads some audience members to imitative behavior. Cawelti argues against this position by changing the terms. He says that what the audience finds vicariously in adventure narratives is not violence and sex but danger and sex. In a world which is for most people quite ordinary, he posits the need for moments of confrontation with \"the ultimate excitements of love and death,\" but in a structured context--the fictional work--which also\n\nintensifies the experience of order and stability. 3 Thus stories of adventure, mystery, and romance provide a dual satisfaction unavailable in everyday life. The audience can eat its cake and have it, too. -17 Unquestionably, Cawelti's view derives from Aristotle Poetics, just as the detractors derive their fears from Plato's view of fiction as presented in The Republic. But Cawelti quotes a variety of modern commentators as well. For example, he cites Harry Berger, Jr., who sees the desire for stability and the desire for excitement as the two drives which produce culture. \"Man has a need for order, peace, and security, for protection against the terror and confusion of life, for a familiar and predictable world.\" But Berger sees an equally strong drive which is the opposite: \"man positively needs anxiety and uncertainty, thrives on confusion and risk, wants trouble, tension, jeopardy, novelty, mystery, would be lost without enemies,\" and so forth. 4 Building upon the definition that genre fictions are \"moral fantasies,\" Cawelti sets up a typology. 5 Though only some of these apply to the adventure film, they demonstrate the thoroughness of Cawelti's views. First of all, the moral fantasy will embody the values defined by the culture's norms. If in time those norms change, that will be reflected in the genre's notion of who or what is good. But there are basic human goods which seem to have existed in Western culture from the time of the Greeks to the present. Cawelti says we all desire Victory, Love, and Knowledge; each type of genre displays a plot pattern which recognizes these desires. Stories of adventure are about heroic action--the search for justice. Stories of romance are about the meeting of a girl and a boy and the birth of love--the search for true love. Stories of mystery are about unraveling the mystery--the search for truth. Stories of horror and science fiction are about the encounter with a monster or an alien--the search for survival. In all these genres humans undergo suffering and unhappiness, but eventually they are rewarded for their troubles. For Cawelti, \"the central fantasy of the adventure story is that of the hero-individual or group--overcoming obstacles and dangers and accomplishing some important and moral mission.\" 6 This type of story goes back to the earliest epics. What this story represents, in all action genres in which the protagonist is successful, is basically the victory over death. There are, however, other subsidiary values: \"the triumph over injustice and the threat of lawlessness in the western; the saving of the nation in the spy story; the overcoming of fear and the defeat of the enemy in the combat story\"; 7 the return to civilization in the safari/jungle story (with or without prize); and the restoration of proper authority in the swashbuckler. For Cawelti, then, the genres which deal with adventure, mystery, and romance synthesize these two desires, the quest for order and the flight from ennui. As fictions, as stories following extremely codified forms, genres are ordered and conventional, their conflicts neatly resolved by the end of the story. Yet at the same time, they are filled with images of excitement, danger, uncertainty, violence, and sex. Thus the audience, held in the comfort and security of the fictional form, can experience the anxiety and suspense, the thrills and chills of\n\nthe situations depicted. Like the thrill of riding a roller coaster at the amusement park, the feeling of excitement is high, while the real danger is -18low, and it only lasts a specified amount of time. Cawelti invokes Jean Piaget on play and likens the experience of these narratives to the function of play. 8 The tensions and frustrations of everyday life are temporarily transcended. And, of course, like Piaget, Cawelti sees this as a good both for the individual and the society. Cawelti does not sidestep the Marxist critique of such experiences, however. He recognizes that the satisfaction of desires as represented in the adventure, mystery, and romance genres is a fantasy, the therapeutic value temporary. Yet the history of culture suggests that civilized human beings, social human beings, have a bona fide need for stories of this kind in order to keep alive a vision of the ideal in the face of the practical forces impinging upon them. It's well enough to say that people should change the conditions of their existence and make the world a better place through their actions, but most people living in the social community simply don't. The burden of everyday life is too great. But most people have the desire for moral action, and perhaps rather than diffuse such desires, these kinds of generic stories serve to remind the participants of the potential for higher goals. There are two general patterns for these adventure tales, says Cawelti. There are those with \"superheroes\" whose actions and exploits are exaggerated and perhaps defy credulity. These are popular with youthful audiences. The other broad pattern displays an \"ordinary hero,\" one who uses only the normal human attributes to solve the conflicts of the narrative. These stories appeal to adult audiences. James Bond is a \"superhero\" who nevertheless fits the tastes of the latter audience. Cawelti then breaks down this basic pattern of adventure stories by setting and time. For example, the swashbuckler is set anywhere from the late Middle Ages to the nineteenth century in Europe. The combat story is almost exclusively tied to a specific historical war. The safari/jungle film has to be in some exotic location (even Antarctica) during the time of exploration when Western culture and native culture are still in conflict. The disaster film is nearly always in the postindustrial period and very frequently contemporaneous with the making of the film. Cawelti does not deal at any great length with individual adventure films in his book. Yet his work is recommended reading for anyone who is interested in the psychological dimensions of generic fictions whether they occur in film, literature, or drama. Erudite, scholarly, and yet extremely lively, Adventure, Mystery, and Romance is a seminal inquiry into genres and the genre experience.\n\nA quick look at a reference bibliography on film books will find one entitled Adventure in the Movies by Ian Cameron. The title itself should, of course, make it clear that the book is not about the adventure genre per se, but about the quality of adventure found in a variety of movies. Cameron covers war films, safari films, horror films, science fiction films, westerns--indeed any film which has adventure in it. For him, adventure is a kind of heightened -19 excitement produced by the perils of the protagonist in a wide array of films. Though the text is competently written, most of the pages are taken up with still photos from favorite films. Cameron presents himself as a member of the movie audience reminiscing about the wonderful and fabulous films of the past, but there is little analysis of generic form and function in this book. The same may be said about most books on the war film, too. Perhaps because war films are so closely identified with actual historical wars, the primary approach of these books seems to be historical and sociological, not filmic. Nevertheless, the books make important observations about the fantasy of war films and their function as propaganda. That is, they discuss the films made during World War II as aspects of the war effort--how accurate did they depict what was really happening at the front, how effective were they in keeping up morale, and so forth--rather than focusing on the archetypal situations inherent in generic patterns or showing how the films worked as repetitions and variations of earlier films. In the better books, some of this material does show up, making them well worth reading for the person interested in the war film as a genre film. Tom Perlmutter book, called simply War Movies, appears in a series from Castle Books which by and large are picture books. But Perlmutter goes much further and gets into some very accurate observations about the nature of this kind of film. The book is selective but covers films made from World War I up to Vietnam. Thus one gets a good sense of the historical development of the genre. Lawrence Suid, on the other hand, examines very closely the ties between Hollywood and the War Department in World War II and after in his monumental study Guts and Glory. What he demonstrates in great detail, with references to copious amounts of correspondence, is that the government had a great hand in dictating the story values of films made about the military from the 1930s on. In some cases the use of military equipment and personnel by Hollywood producers was contingent upon the narrative reflecting the image the government wanted promoted. Military advisers assigned to guarantee the authenticity of battle sequences, costumes, organizations of ranks, and so forth frequently asked for and got major changes in the script of the film. This is a most fascinating and revealing look at an aspect of filmmaking not generally known. Two other books whose texts contain much rewarding information about the scope and function of the war film were published in 1974 with the same title. Ivan Butler and Norman Kagan each authored The War Film from different publishers. Both select a wide variety of\n\nfilms about the various wars from the past to the present and show the changes and development of these films within the context of film history and the history of the nation in the twentieth century. One of the problems engendered by any discussion of genre, that of definition, arises in most war film books. Perhaps it would be better to speak of the -20 \"combat\" film rather than the war film as the subgenre of the adventure film (see chapter 6). Films in which men come together to engage in battle have very recognizable patterns of conflict and action which engender subsequent films; that is, they do live up to genre expectations. There are other films that use wartime as a background and a setting for their narratives, but they do not focus on the military in action. Stanley J. Solomon, for example, in his book Beyond Formula: American Film Genres, refers to a number of films as \"war\" films, which do not fit the popular definition. He mentions Griffith film America, as well as Birth of a Nation and Intolerance, but few would agree that these are typical adventure genre combat films. Nevertheless they fit into Solomon's thesis: they are films which go \"beyond formula.\" It is always a difficult decision, drawing the line between films that are in a genre and those that become nongenre films when they stretch the limits of the generic formulas and conventions. Solomon does at least distinguish between combat and noncombat films. For example, he gives a close reading to Casablanca as a film in which war is a theme. On the other hand, he says war films are only definable in \"terms of a certain kind of atmosphere.\" 9 The problems inherent in definition are apparent to Solomon, as the following remark suggests: \"Thus the spy film is a category of war films when the spying is carried on by different nations, but becomes a category of crime films if carried on, for instance, between rival companies or gangs.\" 10 Ultimately, each writer has to set up a working definition of the subject at hand. Information on the silent swashbuckler can be found in Lewis Jacobs The Rise of the American Film, but Jacobs groups films on the basis of content and not a more modern definition of genre. He mentions Thomas Ince 1914 version of Typhoon as one of the first \"adventure\" films, covers all of Douglas Fairbanks's films, and notes such silent films as The Prisoner of Zenda, The Sea Hawk, and Beau Brummel, the latter starring John Barrymore. Although there is no definitive work on the jungle/safari film, Richard Maynard's Africa on Film: Myth and Reality mentions the 1932 Tarzan film, King Solomon's Mines, Trader Horn, and other films set in Africa. His treatment is from a sociological perspective. Gabe Essoe Citadel Press book Tarzan of the Movies also contains some fascinating lore about that well-known figure.\n\nFinally, Film Genre: Theory and Criticism, an anthology edited by Barry K. Grant , contains several interesting essays on the disaster film, the biblical epic, and the sports film (which is often defined as a subgenre of the adventure genre). This survey of written material on the adventure genre certainly suggests that there is a great deal of work to be done. Though the war film has been covered from a number of perspectives, the other genres have been given very little attention. The area is wide open for trailblazers who wish to open up the dark continent of the adventure film to the scrutiny of criticism. -21 NOTES 1.

When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.\" --Newspaper editor in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence \"The Western is the only genre whose origins are almost identical with those of the cinema itself. . . .\" --André Bazin, in \"The Western: or the American Film Par Excellence\" ( 1953) 1 The western is the richest and most complex of all American genres, cinematic or otherwise, and the most enduring of all the stories that our society continually tells itself. As an American foundation myth it has been endlessly updated, transformed, and reworked through an array of discursive forms, from wood carvings and folk ballads to pulp novels and cigarette ads. Its lineage can be traced back through centuries of American lore to Indian captivity tales and colonial folk music, to the writings of James Fenimore Cooper and other less renowned fiction writers, and particularly to the popular accounts of the \"taming\" of the American West in the latter half of the nineteenth century. But the western story has been told most frequently, most powerfully, and most accessibly on film. Not until the emergence of the cinema in the early twentieth century as a genuine mass medium, in fact, did the western gain the widespread circulation and thus the \"cultural currency\" to be considered as something of a national legend. This is a complex and perhaps a contradictory cultural issue, for to consider the circulation of western stories via the cinema is also to consider the formal and commercial imperatives of the burgeoning mass medium. From as early as 1903 with the huge success of Edwin S. Porter The Great Train Robbery, western stories were perceived as marketable commodities, and they were re-25\n\npeated and varied until certain basic structural features--many of them specific to the film medium--were clearly understood by both filmmakers and audiences alike. These economic imperatives demanded the repetition of the western story and the steady refinement of its narrative and thematic conventions, but it was the very existence of the movie industry and the social climate it represented that ensured the western's \"larger\" cultural and ideological status. The rise of Hollywood signaled the arrival of America's urban-industrial age, a period when traditional values and established notions of family and community, of the social and political order, and of individual freedom and initiative were radically transformed. Hollywood movies were among the first and were certainly the most widespread and accessible manifestations of an emergent \"mass culture\" which brought with it new forms of cultural expression. The western genre was among the more prevalent of those forms, and in a very real sense it was \"about\" the very same conflicts that the new industrial age (and thus the movies themselves) had come to represent--conflicts between rural and urban lifestyles, between agrarian traditions and the conditions of modern city life, between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, between the old world and the new. The half-century \"life span\" of the genre, then, might be seen as the period necessary for our society to collectively work through those conflicts, to resolve the ideological contradictions that infused the western genre with its basic dramatic structure and its thematic nexus. And thus the socalled death of the western in the late 1960s and early 1970s as a mass media staple may indicate an ideological as well as a historical distance from the virtual world that the genre repeatedly displayed. In essence, of course, the western is both historically and geographically specific; it traces the settling of the American West (defined generally as the land west of the Mississippi) from the end of the Civil War until the early twentieth century. In this sense the western is tied more directly to social and historical \"reality\" than virtually any other film genre, with the possible exceptions of the gangster films and bio-pics of the 1930s and the combat films made during and after World War II. But as Robert Warshow so aptly pointed out in his study of the gangster film, every genre gradually generates its own distinct reality. \"It is only in the ultimate sense that the type appeals to the audience's experience of reality,\" Warshow argued. \"Much more immediately, it appeals to the previous experience of the type itself; it creates its own field of reference.\" 2 This was particularly true of the western, since the historical reality it portrayed already had been \"processed\" for popular consumption not only by writers and painters but by self-styled purveyors of their own mythology, especially such outright hucksters of the symbol as Bill Cody and Wyatt Earp. But given the cinema's commercial, ideological, and formal-narrative imperatives, it was inevitable that historical reality yield to a romanticized and formulaic treatment. Jon Tuska, who has done extensive research into the filming of the West, suggests that movie westerns might be categorized as formula, as -26-\n\nhistorical romance, and as historical reconstruction. 3 Predictably enough, Tuska finds that formulary westerns and historical romances far outnumber authentic reconstructions. The narrative structure of the formulary and romantic western is essentially the same. As Tuska puts it: \"There is conflict within the community. The hero eventually decides to take part in the conflict and his involvement precipitates the death-struggle between himself and one or more villains.\" 4 The conflict invariably is resolved in the most fundamental of all western plot conventions, the climactic gunfight. In the formulary western the outcome of the struggle is altogether predictable: the hero prevails, simply because the formula demands it. Here the historical romance differs. \"What happens in the romantic historical reconstruction,\" observes Tuska, \"happens for an ideological reason.\" 5 A historical romance does not simply play out the familiar formula, as a B-grade western might do, thus repressing the sociopolitical and cultural stakes involved in American history (which did, after all, involve the near extermination of an entire race and the appropriation of their land in the name of progress and Manifest Destiny). Instead it steadily discloses its own \"internal\"--i.e., textually specific--value system, its own particular skew on the issues and conflicts inherent within the western \"story.\" This necessarily varies from one western to another, even if the films in question depict the same historical figures and events--the Earps and Clantons fighting for control of Tombstone, say, or Custer and Crazy Horse at the Battle of the Little Big Horn. We have little trouble with the idea that different film versions of these events tell the story differently, because each telling creates its own narrative context and, beyond that, each is specific to the political and ideological stakes of its era. It is no surprise, for instance, that Custer's legendary Last Stand against the Sioux and Cheyenne in 1876 would be depicted as a glorious and heroic military venture in They Died With Their Boots On, since it was produced by a Hollywood studio in 1942 when nationalism, xenophobia, and a call to arms were the order of the day. Nor was it surprising when some thirty years later in Little Big Man, the same event was portrayed as a self-destructive imperialist venture of absurd proportions, since it was directed by the iconoclastic Arthur Penn at the height of the American antiwar movement, when antiestablishment sentiments were running rampant among the \"youth culture\" for which the film was targeted. All three types--the historical reconstruction, the historical romance, and the formulary western--have been prevalent throughout the genre's development, and in fact all three are at work in any one western film. The conventions of feature filmmaking, and especially the demand that conflict be resolved by an individual, goal-oriented protagonist, require that even the most accurate depiction of historical events be romanticized to some degree. And at the same time, even the most banal and predictable formulation requires a minimum of historical authenticity simply to be recognized as a western. Given the quest for standardization of both the filmmaking process and the -27-\n\nfilm product in the commercial cinema, formulary westerns have dominated Hollywood's output from the very earliest years. In fact, André Bazin's assertion about the cinema and the western sharing certain origins applies to economic and institutional as well as formal-aesthetic qualities. The prototype for studio-based feature film production was refined by Thomas Ince between 1912 and 1915, and most of the products that he rolled off the studio assembly line were mass-produced formula westerns featuring the likes of William S. Hart. And in the late 1920s and early 1930s, when the logistical problems of sound production severely limited location shooting and complex camera work, thus curtailing the production of A-class feature westerns, still formulary B-westerns remained a cinematic staple. In fact, a number of outfits like Republic Pictures were created in the 1930s primarily to crank out B-grade westerns for a seemingly insatiable market. Basic to the western story in whatever formulation is an elemental conflict between civilization and savagery. This is the thematic nucleus and the defining characteristic of the genre, and it informs virtually every aspect of its narrative composition, from character and setting to plot structure and thematics. This basic conflict is expressed in a variety of oppositions: East versus West, America versus Europe, garden versus desert, social order versus anarchy, individual versus community, town versus wilderness, cowboy versus Indian, schoolmarm versus dancehall girl, and on and on. The narrative trajectory of any western animates the governing civilization-savagery opposition, generating a conflict--or more likely a whole series of conflicts--that are steadily intensified until a consummate, climactic confrontation becomes inevitable. The opening to virtually any western immediately cues us to just how the basic oppositions will be animated in this particular \"telling\" of the generic tale. Consider the opening of John Ford classic, Stagecoach ( 1939). The film opens with a shot of Monument Valley, an arid landscape that provides--quite frequently, for Ford--a powerful evocation of the West's \"natural\" hostility toward progress and civilization. As the credits wind down we notice two riders approaching, and as they near the camera Ford dissolves from this vast panorama to the exterior of a cavalry camp. The horizon is suddenly cluttered with tents, flagstaffs, and soldiers. The two riders gallop into camp and dismount, and another dissolve takes us into the telegraph office where a group of uniformed men are huddled around a telegraph. Just before the lines go dead, the machine emits a single coded word: \"Geronimo.\" This is a striking example of both narrative and generic economy: it establishes the setting and the general historical context of the story, and at the same time it fleshes out the classical conventions of the genre at large. Hollywood's depiction of the American West presents a vast wilderness dotted with occasional oases--frontier towns, cavalry outposts, isolated campsites--which are linked with one another and with the civilized East by the railroad, the stagecoach, the telegraph, and other \"tentacles\" of social progress reaching westward. Each oasis is a veritable society in microcosm, plagued by conflicts both -28-\n\ninternal and external. In Stagecoach, for instance, which depicts the journey of eight people via stage through hostile Indian country from one frontier community (Tonto) to another (Lordsburg), we are always aware of an array of conflicts. The internal stability of one community is threatened most dramatically by the murderous Plummer brothers, who are terrorizing the town of Lordsburg; and there are other less immediate threats to social order as well: an embezzling banker, a timid whiskey salesman, a self-righteous women's group (the Law and Order League) which runs a suspected prostitute and an alcoholic physician out of town. At the same time, Geronimo and his band of renegade \"Injuns\" provide an external threat, as does the inhospitable landscape itself. Significantly, all of these issues and conflicts are established before Ford's hero, John Wayne as the Ringo Kid, is even introduced. Typically, the hero embodies these oppositions: he is a naive, moral man of the earth who, just before the story opens, has escaped from prison (where he has been unjustly incarcerated) to kill the Plummers and thus avenge the death of his father and brother. Ringo is a classic westerner, embodying the talents and capabilities of the savage (he is capable of violence, good with a gun), but he feels a necessary allegiance to the force of civilization. His pursuit of the Plummers, in fact, has both a personal and a communal motivation: his obsessive desire for vengeance will also rid Lordsburg of a disruptive antisocial force. The ambivalence of the western hero is evident in other sympathetic characters as well, particularly Doc Boone ( Thomas Mitchell), the philosophical inebriate, and Dallas ( Claire Trevor), the whore with the proverbial heart of gold. Both are being run out of Tonto by the Law and Order League as the story opens, and both are befriended by Ringo once he joins the stage en route to Lordsburg. Like Ringo, both are social outcasts who have violated society's precepts in order to survive. And like Ringo, when various crises arise, these two are the most dependable passengers on the stage. Those crises are resolved favorably, but here again is glimpsed a certain fundamental and not altogether obvious sense of ambiguity. All drama involves conflict, and in Hollywood genre movies--or at least in their classical formulation--conflict is resolved in a way that celebrates both heroic action and the status quo. In Stagecoach, the cavalry rescues the stage from the rampaging Indians just in time for Ringo to face down the Plummer brothers in a gunfight on main street. Ringo prevails, predictably enough, but Ford and Screenwriter Dudley Nichols add an interesting and significant twist in the film's epilogue. Ringo and Dallas, who have fallen in love during the journey, are allowed by Doc Boone and the sheriff to flee to Ringo's ranch \"just across the border.\" As the two ride off together, Doc Boone, ever the cultural commentator, muses to the sheriff: \"Well they're saved from the blessings of civilization.\" This presents at once a cynical and an optimistic vision: the repressive and inadequate social system has been salvaged, but only by an agent--the violent hero-who has no place within that society. Yet at the same -29-\n\ntime, the flight of the uncivilized outlaw-hero and the reformed prostitute to start their own family, itself a society in microcosm, keeps the promise of some utopia in the wilderness open as at least a viable possibility. Although the image of the western hero as an ambivalent figure who embodies the savage and civilized was always essential to the genre, many (perhaps most) classical westerns did not play out this ambivalence in terms of plot resolution. Narrative conflict often was resolved with the suggestion that the westerner might repress his violent, antisocial tendencies and settle down within the community. The promise of marriage and family for Ringo and Dallas at the end of Stagecoach is indicative of this tendency, although their shared status as social outcasts and their final flight to Mexico qualify any one-dimensional reading of the film's outcome. A more simplistic and perhaps more typical example of the genre's penchant for prosocial resolution appears in The Westerner, a 1940 film starring Gary Cooper as Cole Hardin, who mediates a violent confrontation between anarchic cattlemen and defenseless, idealized homesteaders. Hardin strikes up a close friendship with representatives of both groups. On one side is Judge Roy Bean ( Walter Brennan), the selfappointed \"law west of the Pecos\" who nearly lynches Hardin early on when he mistakes him for a horse-thief, but then the two bond together in their mutual regard for rugged individualism and a pragmatic survival-of-the-fittest mentality. On the other is Jane Ellen ( Doris Davenport), the daughter of a homesteader who emerges as their spokesperson and brings out the more civilized impulses in Cole Hardin. The woman-domesticator eventually wins over the hero, who turns against Roy Bean and kills him in a climactic gunfight. And in a brief epilogue, the two are pictured gazing out of the window of their own homestead at the \"promised land,\" with the westerner apparently content to hang up his saddle and guns and to take up farming and child-rearing. This closing image runs counter to the contradictory makeup of the western hero, of course, and thus strains both narrative logic and the hero's distinctive status. Here Cole Hardin has acquiesced to society's emasculating and depersonalizing demands and severely compromised the very nature of his appeal. Much more satisfying are those westerns which have the hero ride off into the sunset at film's end after the requisite showdown, thereby reinforcing the genre's prosocial stance without compromising the hero's essential individuality and antisocial tendencies. This allows the western in its classical formulation to \"play it both ways,\" to celebrate a certain idealized sense of the community and of social order while also emphasizing the self-reliant, rugged figure whose capacity for violence and obstinate individualism put him at odds not only with the forces that threaten the community but with the very same community that he feels compelled to protect since it is incapable of protecting itself. The hero's ambivalent status was foregrounded through a distinctive narrative device that appeared in many westerns, especially during the late 1940s and afterward, while the genre was outgrowing its more simplistic classical -30-\n\nformulation. This device was the incorporation into the familiar constellation of characters of another mediating figure: the initiate hero. In a whole series of successful westerns--notably Red River ( 1948), Shane ( 1952), The Searchers ( 1956), Rio Bravo ( 1958), The Magnificent Seven ( 1960), Ride the High Country ( 1962), El Dorado ( 1967), Little Big Man ( 1970), The Cowboys ( 1972), and The Shootist ( 1976)--the narrative is filtered through the perceptions of a young man, often only a child, who is at first mystified by the heroic westerner but gradually comes to understand the contradictory lifestyles and value systems of those living inside and outside the community. Invariably the initiate opts to remain in the realm of Woman, Hearth, and Home--i.e., in the domain of domestication--while the traditional westerner, having served his heroic function, leaves the community. Curiously enough, as the western genre evolved and the formula was further refined and embellished through repetition, the western hero maintained his ambivalent status while the frontier community and its denizens were depicted in increasingly negative terms. In fact, one of the most fascinating and complex aspects of the western's steady evolution as a cinematic form is how stable--if not downright static or reactionary--the western hero has been while the community has taken on a more \"progressive\" and orderly and at the same time a more malevolent status. In the postwar westerns, in fact, the hero takes on guise of a mythic figure caught in real time: the westerner is depicted in ever more heroic and idealized terms, while the community is seen more realistically--assuming that the \"reality\" of contemporary urban life is alienating, bureaucratic, institutionalized, ruthlessly capitalistic, and ultimately dehumanizing. If we see the western as a historical narrative which served ideologically to enable the audience (i.e., the public) to negotiate a transition from its ruralagrarian past and into its urban-industrial (and postindustrial) age, then the diverging depictions of the hero and the community seem altogether logical. American audiences after World War II necessarily became more familiar with both the hero and the genre and also grew less optimistic about the utopian promise of urbanization, industrialization, and high technology. Images of the western community changed accordingly, which of course affected the hero's motivation and sense of mission. Hence the \"psychological\" westerns of the late 1940s and 1950s which displayed the hero's largely ineffectual efforts to handle his growing incompatibility with civilization as well as the cumulative weight of society's unreasonable expectations. Perhaps the most celebrated example of this generic strain is High Noon, whose release in 1950 marked an onslaught of adult westerns with psychologically complex heroes and confounding social issues. The story takes place on the day that the local sheriff ( Gary Cooper) is due to retire and wed his Quaker fiancée ( Grace Kelly). All this is disrupted when he learns that an outlaw gang is headed for town to kill him. The tension mounts as the sheriff waits, since his fiancée urges him not to face the outlaws and the townspeople either evade -31 or ignore his pleas for assistance. The sheriff and his fiancée face the outlaws, despite her religious convictions against violence, and after disposing of the outlaws in a climactic gunfight Cooper throws his badge into the dirt and leaves the community to fend for itself.\n\nSeveral years later another successful \"adult western,\" Rio Bravo ( 1959), provided a belated response to what director Howard Hawks considered the knee-jerk liberalism of Fred Zinneman High Noon. This film presents an even more helpless and claustrophobic community, but this time the local lawman ( John Wayne) and his deputies ( Walter Brennan, Dean Martin, and Ricky Nelson) refuse any offers of assistance from the obviously inept townspeople. Wayne repeatedly insists that \"this is no job for amateurs,\" and he and the others take on a veritable army of gunfighters hired by a local rancher to break his brother out of jail. The lawmen prevail and thus both the heroes and the community emerge with their integrity intact. But still the hero's incompatibility with the community is altogether obvious; he is motivated more by his professional pride and personal code than by any genuine commitment to the quality of life in the community. In this sense the \"professional western\" was something of an answer to the psychological westerns of a few years earlier. The psychological western posed an implicit question: how could the morally upright, self-reliant western hero continue to defend a repressive, cowardly, and thankless community without breaking down? The professional western offered one of two responses, both of which were informed with the values of entrepreneurial capitalism as well as rugged individualism: either the westerner becomes a paid lawman and develops an antagonistic rapport with the bureaucrats who hire him, or else he becomes an outlaw. And as the community's collective notion of law and order progressively squeezes out those rugged individualists who made that order possible, the latter course becomes increasingly attractive to the classical westerner. At some point, the \"honor among thieves\" and self-styled autonomy of the outlaw is preferable to the emasculating demands of social institutions and the domesticating impulse of Woman. Thus many westerns from the late 1950s onward involve a collective led by an aging but still charismatic hero whose demand for material or monetary compensation for their violent activities, whether those activities be prosocial or antisocial, undercuts the classical hero's unspoken moral code. The more significant professional westerns of the 1960s and 1970s-- The Magnificent Seven ( 1960), The Professionals ( 1966), El Dorado ( 1967), The Wild Bunch ( 1969), Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid ( 1969), The Cowboys ( 1972), The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid ( 1972), The Missouri Breaks ( 1976), and The Long Riders ( 1980)--center on characters who, by traditional generic standards and values, are both heroic and villainous, both civilized and savage, both good and evil. And society itself in these films, which invariably overwhelms and either displaces or destroys the collective, is seen not as a community of helpless citizens and homesteaders but as a vast, insensitive bureaucratic machine. -32Gone, then, is the utopian vision of the classical western. The heroic loner whose moral vision and sense of justice set him apart from--and ultimately above--the community he defended, gradually has evolved into a cynical, selfserving, and self conscious Everyman. There have been occasional films in which the westerner goes out with something more than a whimper, however. In The Wild Bunch, directed by Sam Peckinpah in 1969, for example, the outlaw collective reestablishes its heroic credentials even in the face of extinction. Like the professional groups in The Magnificent Seven, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and other professional westerns, the Bunch has been\n\nforced by legal and military forces to flee into Mexico. There they take up with a corrupt bandit army which, just before the outbreak of World War I, is collaborating with the Germans. In a climactic bloodbath that is both suicidal and redemptive, the Bunch decides to confront the entire bandit army. Peckinpah transforms the apocalyptic finale into a superrealist dream, a ballet of blood and death that is shot and cut with multiple cameras running at different speeds. The result is one of the most powerful and disconcerting sequences in any western--clearly Peckinpah's effort to choreograph the genre's dance of death. But while The Wild Bunch may have signaled the genre's death throes, it scarcely marked its termination. In fact, in the late 1960s and the 1970s there was something of an upsurge in western production which seems to have been brought on by a number of forces. One was the convergence of the antiwar movement and the film industry's pursuit of America's youth as a \"target market.\" Vietnam itself proved to be too sensitive a setting for films that examined the United States' militaristic and colonialist/imperialist impulses, while the western genre provided an apt metaphor for what was happening in Southeast Asia, particularly the cavalry-versus-Injun variation that dealt with Manifest Destiny and the calculated destruction of the Native American race. Hence a spate of \"Vietnam westerns\" like Little Big Man ( 1970) and Ulzana's Raid ( 1972), which were overtly critical of the jingoism and the racial-cultural chauvinism that seemed to info"
