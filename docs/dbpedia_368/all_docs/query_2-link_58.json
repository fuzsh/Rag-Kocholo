Common tools may include combs and hairbrushes, clippers and scissors, straight razors, blow dryers, and curling and flat irons. They also may keep records of products used and services provided to clients, such as hair color, hair treatment, and clipper setting.\n\nThose who operate their own barbershop or salon have managerial duties that may include hiring, supervising, and firing workers. They also may keep business and inventory records, order supplies, and arrange for advertising.\n\nBarbers shampoo, cut, and style hair, mostly for male clients. They also may fit hairpieces, provide facials, trim beards and mustaches, and offer facial and head shaving. Depending on the state in which they work, some barbers are licensed to bleach, color, and highlight hair and to offer permanent-wave services.\n\nHairstylists and cosmetologists offer a wide range of hair services, such as shampooing, cutting, coloring, and styling. They often provide consultation and advise clients on how to care for their hair at home. Some also clean and style wigs and hairpieces.\n\nHairstylists and cosmetologists also provide facial and scalp treatments, makeup analysis, and skincare and nail services. In addition, some recommend hair care or skincare products. For more information about workers who specialize in skincare treatment or in fingernail and toenail services, see the profiles for skincare specialists or manicurists and pedicurists, respectively.\n\nWork Environment About this section\n\nBarbers held about 63,100 jobs in 2022.

Physical stamina is important because they are on their feet for most of their shift. Prolonged exposure to some chemicals may cause skin irritation, so they often wear protective clothing, such as disposable gloves or aprons.\n\nWork Schedules\n\nMost barbers, hairstylists, and cosmetologists are full time, although part-time work is common. Work schedules may vary and often include evenings and weekends—times when barbershops and beauty salons may be busiest.

To qualify for a license, candidates typically must graduate from a state-approved barber or cosmetology program and pass an exam.\n\nEducation\n\nBarbers, hairstylists, and cosmetologists usually must complete a state-approved barber or cosmetology program. Admission to these programs varies by state, with some requiring a high school diploma or equivalent. Programs typically involve a mix of classroom studies and hands-on training and lead to a certificate or other postsecondary nondegree award. Some states require health and safety training as part of these programs.\n\nWorkers may continue to take advanced courses in hairstyling or in other personal appearance services throughout their careers to keep up with the latest trends. Those who want to open their own business also may benefit from taking courses in sales and marketing.\n\nLicenses, Certifications, and Registrations\n\nBarbers, hairstylists, and cosmetologists must obtain a license in order to work. Qualifications for a license vary by state. Generally, a person must meet state-specified minimum age requirements, have a high school diploma or equivalent, and have graduated from a state-licensed barber or cosmetology school.\n\nAfter completing a state-approved training program, graduates take a state licensing exam that includes a written test and, in some cases, a practical test of styling skills or an oral exam.\n\nIn many states, cosmetology training may be credited toward a barbering license or vice versa, and a few states combine the two licenses. A fee usually is required to apply for a license, and continuing education units (CEUs) may be required with periodic license renewals.\n\nState reciprocity agreements may allow licensed barbers and cosmetologists to get a license in another state without needing additional formal training or state board testing. Contact your state licensing agency for details.\n\nImportant Qualities\n\nCreativity. Barbers, hairstylists, and cosmetologists must keep up with the latest trends and be ready to try new hairstyles for their clients.\n\nCustomer-service skills. Workers must be friendly, pleasant, and able to interact with clients to build and retain clientele.\n\nListening skills. Barbers, hairstylists, and cosmetologists must be attentive when clients describe what they want to ensure satisfaction with the result.\n\nPhysical stamina.

They also must keep a neat personal appearance so that clients feel comfortable and want to return.\n\nTime-management skills. Barbers, hairstylists, and cosmetologists need to manage their time efficiently when scheduling appointments and providing services. Clients who receive timely hair care are more likely to return, and some services, such as hair coloring, require precise timing.\n\nPay About this section\n\nBarbers, Hairstylists, and Cosmetologists\n\nMedian hourly wages, May 2023\n\nTotal, all occupations\n\n$23.11\n\nBarbers\n\n$17.38\n\nBarbers, hairdressers, hairstylists and cosmetologists\n\n$16.87\n\nHairdressers, hairstylists, and cosmetologists\n\n$16.81\n\nPersonal appearance workers\n\n$16.79\n\nThe median hourly wage for barbers was $17.38 in May 2023.
