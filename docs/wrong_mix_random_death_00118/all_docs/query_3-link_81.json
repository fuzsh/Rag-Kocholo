Thank you to everyone who surfed alongside me so many waves there in Barcelona, the city where I learned that friendship is certainly longer than love.”\n\nThe emotional star ended the post: \"Thank you to everyone who has been there to cheer me up, dried my tears, inspired me and made me grow. Thanks to my Spanish audience who have always covered me with their love and loyalty. For you, just a see you later, and as my father said so many times, see you around the curves!”\n\nShakira and Gerard split after a 12-year relationship, and the ex-former footballer recently revealed he has listened to the singer’s so-called “diss track” that appears to mock him and his new 23-year-old girlfriend Clara Chia."
