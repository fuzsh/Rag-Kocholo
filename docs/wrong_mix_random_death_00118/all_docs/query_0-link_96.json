It’s a summery, feel-good call to the dance floor with a little Latin spice and a radio-friendly chorus.\"[15] Entertainment Weekly's Et Más called a song \"Latina-empowering track\".[5]\n\n\"Girl Like Me\" became an instant viral hit on YouTube, racking up 23 million views in 3 days[2] and 200 million in less than two months.[17] The song also sparked a viral challenge on TikTok where users challenged themselves to recreate the video's choreography.[18] In the United States, the song debuted on Billboard's Digital Songs in December 2020 at number 37.[19] It later debuted in Hot 100 chart at number 87 on week ending January 16, 2021.[20] The song ultimately peaked at number 67 on its sixth charting week on February 27, 2021.[21] The song became Shakira's 22nd and Black Eyed Peas' 19th Hot 100 entry.
