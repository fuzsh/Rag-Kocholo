In addition, she included an a capella song, \"Alfonsina y el Mar\", originally by Argentine folk singer Mercedes Sosa.\n\nCriticisms of the tour included the overselling of tickets in Guatemala, the long delays at the start of the show, the short duration of the tour, and the accusation of prerecorded music at the concert in Puerto Rico.\n\nDespite this criticism, all of the concerts were quickly sold-out, and Shakira even added some extra concerts due to popular demand. The tour didn't have a long duration, due to the fact that she had recorded an MTV UNPLUGGED session, which took several weeks of planning.\n\nSetlist[]\n\nSouth America & North America\n\n[]"
