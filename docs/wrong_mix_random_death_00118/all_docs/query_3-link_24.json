        "text": "Shakira claims her career took a back seat for many years because of her ex-partner Gerard Piqué.\n\n“For a long time I put my career on hold to be next to Gerard, so he could play football,” the Colombian singer said in a new interview with the Sunday Times published Saturday.\n\n“There was a lot of sacrifice for love,” she added.\n\nShakira, 47, first met Piqué, 37, on the set of the music video for her song “Waka Waka (This Time for Africa”) in 2010.\n\nThree years later, they welcomed their first son, Milan, 11, and had Sasha, 9, two years after that.\n\nThe family was based in Barcelona, Spain, as Piqué played for the city’s soccer team.\n\nShakira coached on “The Voice” in the US on occasion and put out an album “El Dorado” in 2017, but mostly focused on raising her kids.\n\nThen in June 2022, she and Piqué announced their separation in a joint statement.\n\n“We regret to confirm that we are separating,” the former couple said at the time. “We ask for privacy at this moment for the well-being of our children, who are our maximum priority. Thank you in advance for your understanding and respect.”\n\nPage Six later reported that Shakira was “devastated” over Piqué’s alleged infidelity with his now-girlfriend, Clara Chia Marti, who is more than 20 years the “Hips Don’t Lie” singer’s junior.\n\nShakira reportedly found out her ex was having an affair when she discovered jam was missing from their home.\n\nShe exacted musical revenge last year in a song called “Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol 53,” warbling in Spanish, “I’m worth two 22-year-olds/You traded in a Ferrari for a Twingo.”\n\nIt’s not the first time Shakira has spoken bitterly about the end of her relationship with Piqué.\n\nSpeaking to Billboard last year, the mother of two confessed to believing in “till death do us part.”\n\n“My priority was my home, my family. I believed in ’till death do us part.’ I believed that dream,” Shakira said in September 2023.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\n“My parents have been together, I don’t know, 50 years, and they love each other like the first day, with a love that’s unique and unrepeatable. So I know it’s possible.”\n\nShe added at the time, “It’s what I wanted for myself and my children, but it didn’t happen.”\n\nDespite her relationship woes, it has been been a tumultuous time for “The Voice” judge.\n\nIn November 2023, she narrowly avoided possible jail time by pleading guilty to tax evasion in Spain.\n\nUnder a deal that was struck at the last minute, Shakira received a suspended three-year sentence estimated to be around $7.6 million. She is releasing a new album, “Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran,” soon."
