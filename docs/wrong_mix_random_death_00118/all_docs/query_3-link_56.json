        "text": "Shakira made a lot of sacrifices in trying to keep her relationship with Gerard Piqué and their family together. In a new interview with The Times UK, the “She Wolf” singer reflected on how she put her own career on the back burner to support Piqué and his professional soccer career.\n\nShakira, 47, told the publication that she put her “career on hold” for “a long time” so that he could play soccer. She added, “There was a lot of sacrifice for love.” Shakira and Gerard first met in 2010 on the set of the music video for her song “Waka Waka (This Time for Africa).” The couple welcomed their first son, Milan, in 2013 and their son Sasha, in 2015. After twelve years together but unmarried, the couple ended their relationship in June 2020.\n\nRELATED: Shakira Stresses Importance of Being ‘Faithful to Ourselves’\n\nIn Shakira’s opinion, there’s a certain core difference between artists and athletes that makes them often incompatible. “Empathy is key in an artist’s work,” she told The Times. Meanwhile, she said an athlete is in “a constant state of war and has to avoid empathy at all costs.”\n\nAs we previously reported in September, Shakira explained that it was “very difficult” to maintain her career while living in Barcelona. She listed difficulties like how hard it was to get a collaborator there and not being able to leave her children. Now, she resides full-time in the US and can release music faster with better access. However, without a husband to stay at home with the kids, Shakira finds it difficult to juggle being “a present mom” while making new music.\n\nHowever, her kids have also gotten a chance to be there for her mom during some of her biggest career moments. Her boys were by her side at the 2023 VMAs as she geared up to take the stage to perform a medley of her biggest hits while being honored with the Vanguard Award. “They’re so loving and caring, and they inspire me to be better, to be a better person just for them,” Shakira said proudly of her sons in an interview with ET at the time. “They’re just the most amazing thing in my life. They’re everything to me.”\n\nShakira's 6 Best Songs\n\nLaila Abuelhawa is the Top 40 and Hip-Hop pop culture writer for Beasley Media Group.
