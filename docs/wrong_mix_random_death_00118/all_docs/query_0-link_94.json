        "text": "LOS ANGELES, Calif. – For the first time in her career, Shakira Austin has earned herself a spot on the 2021-22 John R. Wooden Award Late Season Top 20 Watch List, as the center rolls through her highly productive senior season.\n\nThe list is comprised of 20 student-athletes who are front runners for the Wooden Award All American Team and Most Outstanding Player Award. Since 1976, the John R. Wooden Award program is one of the top honors in college basketball recognizing the best of the best throughout the sport. The list will be narrowed down during the 2021-22 season with the Wooden award late season list and the National Ballot.\n\nThe senior center continues to pace the Rebels throughout a historic 2021-22 season, as Ole Miss got off to its best start in SEC play since the 2009-10 season at 5-1. Midway through SEC play, Austin leads the team in points (14.4) and rebounds (8.6) per game. The Fredericksburg, Va., native currently leads the SEC in active rebounds with a total of 968.\n\nThe Wooden Award All-American team will be announced the week of the Elite Eight round of the NCAA Tournament.
