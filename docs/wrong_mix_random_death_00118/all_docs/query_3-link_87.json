        "text": "On the heels of her chart-topping new album, GRAMMY®, and Latin GRAMMY® Award-winning artist Shakira has just announced the first-string dates on her highly anticipated world tour, “Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran World Tour,” promoted by Live Nation, with 14 arena shows across North America kicking off this fall. The tour’s first leg will start in November in Palm Desert, CA, and includes a stop in Miami at Kaseya Center on November 20. Known for her dynamic and high-energy performances, Shakira will bring tracks from her new album and her legendary catalog of hits to life on stage.\n\nShakira first hinted at the tour during her appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon last month. On Friday, the global superstar surprised fans at Coachella when she appeared during Bizarrap’s set to perform their global smash hit “Shakira: Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 53” and “La Fuerte,” both featured on her new album. Before exiting the stage, Shakira teased the tour news to a roaring crowd.\n\nCoachella marks the second time in the last month that Shakira has surprised fans with a showstopping performance. Last month, following the album release, Shakira shut down New York City’s Times Square giving a crowd of 40,000+ fans a peek into the energy of her live shows when she performed at the TSX Stage. The performance included her iconic hits like “Hips Don’t Lie,” “Te Felicito/TQG,” and “Session 53,” as well as “Puntería” and “Cómo Dónde y Cuándo” from her new album.\n\nThe tour is in support of her new album, Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran, which in 24 hours of its release became the most streamed album of the year with over 10 billion, and was certified 7x platinum. The album debuted at #1 on Billboard’s Latin Album and Latin Pop Album Charts, while “Puntería” with Cardi B holds the #1 spot on both the Billboard Latin Airplay and Latin Pop Airplay charts. Listen to the album HERE!\n\nThis is Shakira’s first tour since 2018, when she wowed fans at sold out stadiums and arenas around the planet with the El Dorado World Tour, cementing her reputation as “an international pop goddess” (Rolling Stone)."
