        "text": "Wyclef was big with Fugees, but his solo career, at least IMHO, has never hit big as his Fugees days. Now. Shakira. She is still hot. At least she is still. BIG in Rock in Espanol circles. Still neither artist is cheap. Both of 'em must owe some serious money to the Mob.\n\nIt will at least build additional attendance. Rather than dad taking little jimme, now his older sister wants to come along and hell why not mom?\n\nWhat it really does is creates buzz. Wyclef and Shakira are NAME BRAND entertainers. By showing up to sing at half time of an MLS game, people who don't know too much about MLS might pay attention.\n\nReasoning could be:\n\n\"If Shakira, one of the most sucessful female acts in the world is involved with MLS, maybe its something I want to know more about....\"\n\nOther points:\n\nIt will be on the news now.\n\nShakira is Colombian but has strong cross over appeal.\n\nIf Red Bull want to spend ridiculous amounts of money on the icing on soccer's cake....and also on the cake itself...why should anyone argue? Its great...its really great...\n\nSomehow, I think this will turn out to be foible (sp?) investment for Red Bull....its sports ventures have all the marking (to me, at least) of a good company that has gotten to big for itself, and think that everything they throw money at/touch will turn out gold. Is an old story. Just because you are good at one type of marketing in no way means it translates..\n\nHaving said, go Dieter...go Red Bull...go massive amounts of money throw at MLS. MLS will only be the winner...whether or not Dieter has to sell in 4-5 years at a loss or not.\n\nSomehow, something makes me think AEG is the smart money on this. But if Dieter's legacy is to leave a solid NY franchise w/stadium + solid 25k attendance....he's a hero in my book (financial losses or not...).\n\nThe question would be then (way off on the speculative vein)- will a more reasonable business plan at that point be enough to sustain the increase in fandom.....\n\nLong run...its going to be fun....\n\nHave you seen the other stuff? They will have the former cosmos and metrostars players there, including pele, beckenbauer, and donadoni. They have already got this bus trip to dc planned (incouding all you can drink at one of the hottest nights lcubs in DC for the pregame.) And now they throw in Rihanna, Shakira, and Wyclef (who is honestly one of the best performers to see in concert.) Red Bull may end being one of the best things to happen to MLS. Spending the money to make it first rate.\n\nActually he has been quite the success, without the fugees. He has had a couple albums go platinum. In addition, he has become a huge success as a producer, producing everything from Sanatana to Destiny's Child, winning several grammys. He just doesn't put his face all over the screen when he produces. He has also done things that were never intended to be commercial succes, such as his Hatian album all in creole. On top of that, he is one of the best performers out there. He gave a show in New York at Carnegie Hall that was out of this world, and included appearances by Charlotte Church, Mark Anthony, Steveie Wonder, Mary J. Blige, Destiny's Child, and the lsit goes on and on. It's on DVD and is worth watching. It's a very well done, very eclectic concert.\n\nAnd as you said, they are not cheap, so it is nice to see SOMEONE in soccer spending some money to put it on par with other sports shows.\n\nyes, one actually hopes that all of this money that they are throwing around is combined with something people haven't seen in 10 years - good soccer.\n\nThey should try and get as many people as they can that are going down to DC to sign up for partial plans before the match, as after it things may be a little more difficult.\n\njames\n\nOh, come on, they've seen plenty of that, and they'll see it this season--just not from the home team.\n\nI'm not kidding about the \"NASL called\" crack earlier. Guys, this is not the path to sustainability."
