        "text": "Four years after giving an epic performance at the Super Bowl in Miami, Shakira is set to return to the same stage for the CONMEBOL Copa América final this weekend.\n\nTaking place at the Hard Rock Stadium on Sunday, July 14, the Colombian singer will perform during halftime to an audience of thousands cheering on their national teams: Colombia and Argentina.\n\nShakira has previously performed at the Super Bowl and three World Cups, as most can remember 2010’s “Waka Waka (This Time For Africa),” which was the official anthem of that year’s World Cup. She’s expected to play her repertoire of hits during Miami’s final, including the tournament’s unofficial anthem “Puntería.”\n\n“Shakira is an extraordinary South American star who has dazzled the entire world,” said Alejandro Domínguez, president of CONMEBOL, in a statement. “Her songs are sung and danced to in every corner of the planet, turning her art into a global phenomenon that crosses borders and is enjoyed by millions of people.”\n\nThe Copa América final is scheduled for 8 p.m. local time this Sunday, July 14. The tournament is being broadcast on FOX Networks, which includes Fox Sports 1, Fox Sports 2, as well as the Fox Sports app. It is also broadcast on Univision and TUDN with Spanish commentary, as well as FuboTV (free trial available)."
