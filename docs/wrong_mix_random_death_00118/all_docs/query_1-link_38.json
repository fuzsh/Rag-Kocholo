After tickets for the North American leg of her tour had sold out, she announced that she would film and release a video album filmed at The Forum in Los Angeles. To do it, she chose to partner with Done + Dusted.\n\nDirected by our own James B. Merryman, Shakira In Concert was immediately hailed by the Los Angeles Times as “a hero’s return,” with Rolling Stone calling the production her “triumphant return to singing.” The special was also nominated for five categories in the 2020 NY TV Film Awards, winning two: one for Performing Arts Special, and another for Special Event."
