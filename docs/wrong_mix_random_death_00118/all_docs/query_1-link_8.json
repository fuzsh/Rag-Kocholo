        "text": "The third annual Bésame Mucho Festival lineup has been revealed with Shakira, Pitbull, Enrique Iglesias, Los Tigres Del Norte and Banda MS as headliners.\n\nSet to take place in Los Angeles’ Dodger Stadium on Dec. 21, the one-day Latin music festival returns with a jam packed list of performers, including Juanes, Gloria Trevi, Elvis Crespo, Paulina Rubio, Los Tucanes de Tijuana and more.\n\nMany of the acts on the lineup are returning guests though this is the first time Shakira, Pitbull and Enrique are slated to take part. In fact, the Besame Mucho Festival will be the first headlining festival appearance for Shakira who only made a short cameo during Bizarrap’s Coachella set earlier this April.\n\nThe festival will be one of the many dates Shakira is set to perform for as part of her 2024 tour across the United States. Shakira may announce additional dates in the future but as it stands now, her show at the Besame Mucho Fest will end the first leg of her U.S. and Canada shows.\n\nConcert-goers can register to buy presale tickets for Besame Mucho now with the presale starting May 24.\n\nLast year’s Besame Mucho Festival was headlined by Mexican pop rock group Maná, the Marco Antonio Solis-fronted Los Bukis, and pop star Gloria Trevi, with additional performances from Alejandro Fernández, Pepe Aguilar, Natalia Lafourcade and Belinda, among others.\n\nThe Besame Fest began in Los Angeles two years ago and only recently expanded to Austin, Texas earlier this year. The festival is usually split by genre, with emphasis on pop, banda, rock and classics (mostly Mexican norteño music)."
