        "text": "BARCELONA, Spain — Spanish state prosecutors recommended Wednesday that an investigating judge shelve a probe into another alleged case of tax fraud by pop star Shakira.\n\nThe Colombian singer is under investigation for the alleged evasion of 6.7 million euros ($7.2 million) in taxes on her 2018 income via an offshore company. She has denied wrongdoing.\n\nState prosecutors, who had initially brought the allegations forward, are now saying “there is not sufficient evidence” of a possible fiscal crime.\n\nIt will be up to the investigating judge to decide whether to continue with the probe, and possibly recommend that the case be tried, or dismissed.\n\nIn a separate case, Shakira struck a deal in November with prosecutors whereby she acknowledged she had failed to pay Spanish government 14.5 million euros (about $15.6 million) in taxes between 2012 and 2014.\n\nShakira currently resides in Miami after having left Spain following her breakup with the now former soccer player Gerard Pique."
