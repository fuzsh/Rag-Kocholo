        "text": "Coachella's opening weekend witnessed an unexpected twist as Shakira took the stage during Bizarrap's set on Friday evening. The Colombian superstar's surprise appearance thrilled fans and came with a major announcement: She's hitting the road for a global tour later this year.\n\nShakira joined the Argentine DJ at the 23rd annual festival in Indio, California, for a dynamic performance of their tracks \"La Fuerte\" and \"BZRP Music Sessions, Vol. 53.\"\n\nIn a brief pause between songs, Shakira addressed the audience in both Spanish and English, \"I have to share something today. Biza, I'm going on tour. I'm going on tour, finally ... starting here, this November, this year, this city. I can't wait. Couldn't ask for more,\" the singer said. She then revealed her upcoming tour is titled \"Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran World Tour,\" named after her latest album.\n\nThe announcement, which followed a cryptic message she teased earlier in the day, left fans buzzing with excitement.\n\nThe album and tour mark Shakira's return to music after a six-year hiatus. Featuring collaborations with renowned artists such as Cardi B, Rauw Alejandro, and Tiesto, the new album delivers an electrifying blend of pop and Latin music."
