        "text": "(born 1977). Colombian musician Shakira was one of the most successful Latin American recording artists beginning in the early 2000s. She achieved success in both Spanish- and English-speaking markets.\n\nShakira was born Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll on February 2, 1977, in Barranquilla, Colombia, to a Lebanese father and a Colombian mother. She started belly dancing when she was young and by age 10 had begun writing songs and taking part in talent competitions. In 1990 Shakira was signed to a record deal. Her first two albums, Magia (1991) and Peligro (1993), were not very successful. After taking a break from recording to act in the Latin soap opera El oasis, Shakira resumed her music career with Pies descalzos (1995). The album produced several hit songs, including “Estoy aquí,” “Pienso en ti,” and “Un poco de amor.”\n\nAfter releasing the album ¿Dónde están los ladrones? in 1998, Shakira focused on establishing herself in the American market. In 2001 her album MTV Unplugged (2000) won the Grammy Award for best Latin pop album, and she released her first English-language album, Laundry Service, that same year. Although her English-language songwriting skills were questioned by some (Shakira wrote all her own lyrics), Laundry Service sold more than 13 million copies worldwide.\n\nShakira continued her crossover success in 2005 with the release of the Spanish-language Fijación oral, vol. 1 in June and the English-language Oral Fixation, Vol. 2 in November. Both albums debuted in the top five in the United States, and her single “Hips Don’t Lie” (featuring Wyclef Jean) topped charts around the world in 2006. At that year’s Latin Grammy Awards, she captured song-of-the-year and record-of-the-year awards for the single “La tortura,” and Fijación oral, vol. 1 was named album of the year as well as best female pop vocal album. A live recording, Oral Fixation Tour, followed in 2007. Also that year Shakira performed in Hamburg, Germany, as part of Live Earth, a worldwide concert series organized to bring attention to climate change and environmental sustainability.\n\nFor her next English-language album, She Wolf (2009), Shakira adopted an electro-pop sound. The following year her song “Waka Waka (This Time for Africa),” a collaboration with a South African band, was chosen as the official anthem of the 2010 World Cup. The track later appeared on her album Sale el sol (2010), which earned a Latin Grammy for best female pop vocal album. In 2013 Shakira became a coach on the American televised singing competition The Voice."
