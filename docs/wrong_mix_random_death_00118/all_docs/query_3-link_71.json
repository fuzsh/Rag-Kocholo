        "text": "Shakira is going to enjoy her weekend because her tax issues in Spain are officially resolved. After years of dealing with two separate cases, the “Hips Don’t Lie” singer can finally put her legal issues behind her.\n\nOn Thursday, a Spanish investigative magistrate put her final tax fraud case on ice because prosecutors discovered that “there is not sufficient evidence” to indicate that a crime was committed, per the Associated Press. The case is closed and “there is no indication that can prove that Shakira Isabel M. R. had consciously and voluntarily omitted information and documentation with tax significance.” Unless one of the prosecutors appeals the ruling in the next week, the case cannot be resurrected in the future.\n\nThat must be a huge sigh of relief for Shakira, who has had two ongoing tax issues for the past few years stemming from her years in Spain when her ex-boyfriend, Gerard Piqué, played for FC Barcelona. Her first financial fraud case was settled last November with a $15.6 million payment to the Spanish government for failing to pay taxes between 2012 and 2014. It was a last-minute deal struck ahead of her trial. “I have made the decision to finally resolve this matter with the best interest of my kids at heart who do not want to see their mom sacrifice her personal well-being in this fight,” she said in a November 2023 statement. “I need to move past the stress and emotional toll of the last several years and focus on the things I love, my kids, and all the opportunities to come in my career.”\n\nThe 47-year-old singer split with Piqué in June 2022 after 11 years together after his alleged affair. The former couple share two sons, Milan, 11, and Sasha, 9, and while they are co-parenting amicably, she’s enjoying her single life. “I’ve been putting out music here and there, but it was really hard for me to put together a body of work,” Shakira admitted on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in March. “I didn’t have time. It was the husband factor. Now I’m husbandless. Yeah, the husband was dragging me down. Now I’m free. Now I can actually work.”\n\nWith the pain of her breakup and her legal woes behind her, Shakira is ready for a fresh start. If the rumors are true, she might be dating handsome Emily in Paris star Lucien Laviscount. He starred in her recent music video for her single, “Punteria,” but her pals are reportedly telling her to slow down just a bit. “Shakira is desperate to fall in love – but her friends are concerned because Lucien has slowly crept his way up the celebrity ladder while dating women who were all less famous than Shakira,” a source told the Daily Mail. We only want good things for the stunning star, let’s hope her new chapter is the best one yet."
