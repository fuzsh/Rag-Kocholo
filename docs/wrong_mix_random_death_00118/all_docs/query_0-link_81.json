        "text": "Cardi B and Shakira have teamed up in the music video together, “Punteria,” which appears on Shakira’s 12th studio album, Las Mujeres Ya No Llorana. Shakira posted: “Puntería @iamcardib official video OUT NOW!”\n\nShakira’s Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran features 15 other tracks, including “Te Felicito” with Rauw Alejandro, “Monotonía” with Ozuna, “Shakira: Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 53” with Bizarrap and “TQG” with Karol G. The video for Puntería shows the two women amongst chiseled centaurs and goddesses in a pastel, intergalactic setting. Shakira is seen holding a bow and arrow as Cardi sits atop a half-horse, half-man, wearing a white, roped ensemble and platinum-blonde tresses.\n\nAhead of the single’s release, the two superstars spoke about working together. Said Cardi: “When I first met Shakira, it was in Paris at the Fendi show, and I was very, very nervous. I was nervous because I wanted to get next to her, but I was like, ‘I’m not gonna get next to her until they call me.’ I manifested it, but I didn’t know when it was coming …I knew this day would come. It came. God is good, Jesus. I don’t care if she wants me to meow — I’m doing it. Seriously, that is my dream. I always look at your videos and it’s so crazy doing a video with you because all of your videos — you could just tell you take your time from the angle, to the dancing, to the things that pop.”\n\nShakira added, “I wanted to do something with Cardi. We were always discussing internally if it was a good idea to put someone on this song. I always pictured Cardi on this song. I reached out, and here we are. It’s been so fun to work with you. It’s so easy, honestly. She’s like, ‘I’ll do everything.’ I’m like, ‘Are you ready to work long hours? Because I work long hours.’ She’s like, ‘I’ll be there from 6 to 6 a.m.’”\n\nTake a look at the music video for “Punteria” – here.\n\nEditorial credit: Featureflash Photo Agency / Shutterstock.com"
