        "text": "Putting this on our travel bucket list ASAP. Artists in Barranquilla, Colombia, have erected a giant bronze statue of the city's most famous daughter, the one and only Shakira.\n\nShakira, who has found success with both English and Spanish-language songs (also a Coach on Seasons 4 and 6 of The Voice) took to Instagram to express her gratitude for the amazing honor.\n\nAll about Shakira's statue in Colombia\n\nThe statue, from sculptor Yino Márquez, depicts the Grammy-winner in the middle of her signature hip-swiveling dance moves, with her arms raised. A plaque at the base reads in part (in Spanish), that on February 2, 1977, “Barranquilla and the world witnessed the birth of a heart that composes, hips that don’t lie, a voice that moves masses and a pair of bare feet that walk for the good of children and humanity,” according to NBC News.\n\nThe statue is by some estimates 21 feet tall, and looms over the Magdalena River. It was unveiled on Tuesday, December 26, with the singer's parents and Barranquilla's mayor Jaime Pumarejo in attendance.\n\nNBC News notes that this is the second statue of the singer in the city; a monument from 2006 stands outside a soccer stadium.\n\nRELATED: Shakira's All-Time Best Musical Collaborations, from Beyoncé to Bizarrap\n\nOn Instagram, the \"Whenever, Wherever\" hitmaker posted pictures of her adorable parents smiling in front of the figure and posing with the Pumarejo, as well as the plaque in her honor, noting that it was especially nice to celebrate the statue's unveiling on her mom's birthday. Her brothers were in attendance as well.\n\nShe also reposted a news segment about the statue, which uses audio from her iconic song \"Hips Don't Lie,\" and in particular the line, \"Mira, en Barranquilla se baila así,\" which translates to, \"watch, in Barranquilla, they dance like this.\"\n\nIn addition to her many other accomplishments, this year Shakira was awarded the prestigious Video Vanguard Award at the VMAs.\n\n“Shakira is a true global force who continues to inspire and influence the masses with her unique, musical prowess,” Bruce Gillmer, Paramount and chief content officer, Music, Paramount+, said in a press release, via Hola!.\n\n“She’s a trailblazer for women around the world and one of the first artists to lead the globalization of Latin music. Her massive impact across the musical landscape will be long-lasting as she continues to create and entertain at the highest level.”\n\nRELATED: A Rat Almost Crawled on Shakira While She Was Filming Her Latest Music Video"
