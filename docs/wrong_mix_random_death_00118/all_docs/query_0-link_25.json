        "text": "Shakira has received some unwarranted shade from Nestor Lorenzo, Colombia's coach who has been making headlines after he opened up about Colombian superstar Shakira's Copa America halftime show that will be held at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami due to the duration of the spectacle.\n\nShakira's halftime show gets a frown from Colombia's coach, Nestor Lorenzo\n\nThe Copa America final is finally here, and Argentina will try to win their second consecutive tournament against a dangerous Colombia who have everything they need to become the champions.\n\nShakira was born in Barranquilla, Colombia and has been very supportive of their national team during the Copa America, and now that her national team is in the final, it is such an honor to have her in the halftime show, however, Nestor Lorenzo is a stickler for regulation times, as he expressed recently.\n\n\"I hope you enjoy, Shakira is great,\" Lorenzo said on Saturday. \"For a final, when the rules change for both teams, bad pitches for both or same weather for both, then I can't say if its bad or if it favors one side,\" Nestor said.\n\n\"I can't understand it, I wish it were like the rest. When we came out in the 16th minute we were sanctioned, but now that there is a show we can come out in the 20th-minute mark. Players can get cold, but it's on both sides. I found out today that this is how it is, and that's it.\" He elaborated.\n\nColombia defeated Uruguay in an intense game on Wednesday and finished 1-0 after everyone in the team gave their best to retain the lead in a very physical game."
