        "text": "Colombian singer Shakira and Spanish soccer player Gerard Piqué may no longer be together, but that doesn't change the fact that fans shipped them for more than a decade.\n\nThe relatively quiet former couple were an item for 12 years, during which time they welcomed two sons. In June 2022, however, the pair announced that they had called it quits.\n\nAhead, see everything you need to know about Piqué and Shakira's romance—from their honeymoon stages in 2010 to their sudden breakup and what has happened since.\n\nApril 2023: Shakira leaves Spain with her kids.\n\nThe singer announced on Instagram that she is moving away from Barcelona and starting a new era in another city. Per reports, she and sons Milan, 10, and Sasha, 8, will hold a permanent residence in Miami, where much of her family lives.\n\n\"I settled in Barcelona to give my children stability, the same stability we are now looking for in another corner of the world next to family, friends and the sea. Today we begin a new chapter in search of happiness,\" she wrote in Spanish alongside a photo of Barcelona.\n\nShe and her sons were pictured catching a flight out of Barcelona earlier this month.\n\nJanuary 2023: Shakira releases an explosive single addressing Gerard Piqué's betrayal and naming his new love.\n\nThe singer released an explosive single with Argentine hitmaker Bizarrap, titled \"BZRP Music Session #53.\" In it, she sings about a betrayal from a partner, who left her for someone younger and less intimidating.\n\n\"Sorry, baby, I should have thrown you out a while ago / A she-wolf like me is not for rookies / A she-wolf like me is not for guys like you / For guys like you / I'm too good for you and that's why you're with someone just like you,\" she sings in Spanish.\n\nIn the evidently autobiographical bop, Shakira talks about living next to her in-laws and even addresses her tax evasion battle with the Spanish government, which could potentially land her in jail. She also not-so-subtly drops her ex's name, as well as the name of his new girlfriend, Clara Chia Marti.\n\nJanuary 1, 2023: She writes about life after loss.\n\nIn a heartbreaking yet empowering New Year's Day Instagram post following her first holiday season without her longtime partner, Shakira wrote about coping with loss, continuing to love even after being betrayed, and healing with time.\n\n\"Although our wounds continue to be open in this new year, time has surgeon's hands,\" she wrote in Spanish. \"Even if someone has betrayed us, we have to keep trusting. In the face of contempt, keep valuing yourself. Because there are more good people than bad people. More empathetic people than indolent people. There are fewer who leave and more who stay by our side. Our tears are not a waste, they water the soil where the future will be born and make us more human, so in the midst of heartbreak we can continue to love.\"\n\nNovember 2022: Shakira and Piqué reach a custody agreement.\n\n\"We have signed a custody agreement,\" Shakira, 45, and Piqué, 35, said in a joint statement obtained by ABC News on Tuesday, November 8. \"Our sole objective is to provide our children with the utmost security and protection and hope that they can continue with their lives in a safe and calm environment.\"\n\nThey added, \"We appreciate that their privacy will be respected.\"\n\nA source close to the singer confirmed to the news outlet that the couple's two sons, Milan, 9, and Sasha, 7, will move permanently from Barcelona (Piqué's home) to Miami (Shakira's family's home).\n\nOctober 2022: Shakira releases a heartbreak song about her ex.\n\nThe pop star dropped her single \"Monotonía,\" in collaboration with Ozuna.\n\nIn it, she sings in Spanish about the end of her and Piqué's relationship: \"It wasn't your fault, it wasn't my fault / It was monotony's fault / I never said anything but it hurt / I knew this would happen.\"\n\nThe track was released alongside a stunning video directed by Jaume de la Iguana, during which the singer is shot through the chest by her former love and later walks through the streets carrying her own heart.\n\nSeptember 2022: Shakira finally opens up about their split.\n\nIn a new cover interview for ELLE's October issue, the singer broke her silence on her private and sudden split from Piqué, and the emotions she's been going through since.\n\n\"I try to conceal the situation from [our kids] as much as I can,\" Shakira told the magazine. \"It's really upsetting for two kids who are trying to process their parents' separation. And sometimes I just feel like this is all a bad dream and that I'm going to wake up at some point. But no, it's real. And what's also real is the disappointment to see something as sacred and as special as I thought was the relationship I had with my kids' father and see that turned into something vulgarized and cheapened by the media. And all of this while my dad has been in the ICU and I've been fighting on different fronts. Like I said, this is probably the darkest hour of my life.\"\n\nShe continued, \"For [women] like me who believe in values like family who had the dream, the big dream of having a family forever, to see that dream broken or shredded into pieces is probably one of the most painful things that you can ever go through. But I think that women, we are resilient. You know, we have this resiliency that is just innate in all of us. And we are meant to nurture and to take care of those who depend on us.\"\n\nThe singer noted that she made life-altering sacrifices throughout their relationship, most notably that of moving to Barcelona with the Spanish athlete so he could continue his professional soccer career at FC Barcelona, even though it would have been better for her music career to live in the United States.\n\n\"One of the two had to make that effort and that sacrifice. And I did it. I put my career in second gear and I came to Spain, to support him so he could play football and win titles. And it was a sacrifice of love,\" Shakira said. \"Thanks to that, my kids were able to have a present mom, and I have this amazing bond with them that is unbreakable and that sustains us. You know, that is it. That's all I can say.\"\n\nJune 2022: They call it quits.\n\nTo fans' surprise, the singer and soccer star dropped the sudden news that they had broken up after 12 years together. \"We regret to confirm that we are separating,\" they said in a joint statement released by Shakira's PR team. \"For the well-being of our children, who are our highest priority, we ask that you respect our privacy. Thank you for your understanding.\"\n\nFebruary 2020: Shakira performs at the Super Bowl with J.Lo.\n\nThe only thing more special than Shakira's Super Bowl performance with Jennifer Lopez was the fact that the sporting event took place on her birthday. Plus, as if by magic, her then boyfriend Piqué's birthday falls on the exact same day. Soccer player Piqué was born on February 2, 1987, and Shakira was born on the same day, except a decade earlier, in 1977. It seemed that the couple's union was truly meant to be.\n\nJanuary 2020: Shakira discusses her steamy relationship.\n\nIn the couple's 60 Minutes interview in early 2020, Shakira opened up about her decision not to marry Piqué. She said, \"To tell you the truth, marriage scares the shit out of me. I don't want him to see me as the wife. I'd rather him see me as his girlfriend,\" she teased. \"His lover, his girlfriend. It's like a little forbidden fruit, you know? I wanna keep him on his toes. I want him to think that anything's possible depending on behavior.\"\n\nApril 2017: Shakira releases a song about her beau.\n\nIn April 2017, Shakira released the single \" \" from her album , which is all about her love story with Piqué. The title of the single literally translates to \"I fell in love.\" In the lyrics, Shakira proclaimed, \"With you I'd have 10 children / Let's start with two / I only tell you / In case you want to practice.\"\n\nAugust 2017: Shakira candidly discusses motherhood.\n\nIn an interview with Hola! magazine in 2017, Shakira revealed, \"I used to be the center of my world, and now I am only a satellite of my children. It's the hardest job I've ever had.\" She continued, \"I never thought it’d be so difficult, because it takes a lot of your energy. I think of my family a lot; I'm concerned about them all day. It's physical, emotional, and intellectual wear and tear. Thinking of making an album seemed like a Herculean task, like climbing Mount Everest.\"\n\nJanuary 2015: The couple reveals they're expecting again.\n\nIn a series of adorable Instagram pics, Shakira confirmed her second pregnancy. The couple's second son, Sasha Piqué Mebarak, arrived shortly after, on January 29, 2015. The \"Hips Don't Lie\" singer revealed on Instagram, \"The name Sasha is of Greek and Russian descent and means 'defender of mankind' and 'warrior.'\"\n\nJune 2014: Shakira says she has no plans to marry.\n\nOf her relationship with Piqué, Shakira told Glamour in 2014, \"We already have what's essential, you know?
