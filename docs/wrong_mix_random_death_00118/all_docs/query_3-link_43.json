        "text": "On March 26, former The Voice Coach Shakira (Seasons 4 and 6) threw a surprise, pop-up concert in the middle of Times Square. The performance was to celebrate the release of her 12th album, Las Mujeres Ya No Loran. Shakira teased the concert via social media a few hours before the event, and a whopping 40,000 people ended up in the crowd.\n\nDuring the event, she started out by singing her number-one hit ''Hips Don't Lie,'' amping up the ecstatic audience.\n\n“Hola, New York! Oh my God; this is amazing, absolutely insane. It’s so awesome to see you again, to sing for you… Nothing compares to this. Thank you so much for all the love that you’ve been giving me this week during the release of my new album, Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran. And thank you, thank you, thank you for showing up,” she said after the first song.\n\nShakira rocks Times Square with a free concert\n\nThe Grammy winner continued by perfomring songs such as “Te Felicito,” “TQM,” and “Cómo Dónde y Cuándo.” She also sang a track from the album called \"Punteria,\" which has vocals featuring Cardi B and an upcoming music video starring Lucien Laviscount. Then, she wrapped everything up by singing the ultra-popular track ''Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 53.''\n\nSee the amazing moments here.\n\nLas Mujeres Ya No Lloran is out now.\n\nRELATED: A Rat Almost Crawled on Shakira While She Was Filming Her Latest Music Video\n\nShakira on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\n\nOn March 25, the ''She Wolf'' singer appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon to discuss the artistic process of making her new album.\n\n“I was trying to rebuild myself, and music was the glue, but it felt like it was an alchemical process in which I was transforming pain and anger and frustration into creativity and productivity and strength and resilience,” she explained to Fallon. “The resilience of a diamond. So that’s why I picked the metaphor of the precious stones, because of the resilience that us women have today when we have to face adversity.”\n\nRELATED: Shakira Somehow Put Both Legs Behind Her Head: See the Pics\n\nShakira also expressed similar sentiment in a recent statement with Variety. \"Making this body of work has been an alchemical process,\" she said. \"While writing each song I was rebuilding myself. While singing them, my tears transformed into diamonds, and my vulnerability into strength.”\n\nDuring the Fallon interview, she also dropped hints about the surprise New York City concert, saying that ''something [would] happen'' in the Big Apple soon. When asked if she'll go on tour for the new album, she left the possibility open."
