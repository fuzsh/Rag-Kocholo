        "text": "Shakira and Lucien Laviscount are stepping out together. On Tuesday, after the singer wowed a Times Square crowd with an epic performance, she and the Emily in Paris star were photographed dining at Carbone in New York City.\n\nIn the pic, both Shakira, 47, Lucien, 31, opted for mostly black looks. The former, who wore her curly hair down, stunned in shiny pants and a velvet jacket, while the latter opted for a motorcycle jacket, which he paired with a scarf and other coordinating items.\n\nThe dinner came after Shakira surprised a crowd of more than 40,000 in Times Square with an exciting performance in celebration of her recently released album, Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran.\n\nLucien was on hand to support Shakira for her performance, and the pair even posed for a pic together backstage.\n\nThe outing follows the release of Shakira's music video, for her song, \"Puntería,\" which Lucien stars in. The steamy video features the duo embracing in a giant lotus flower.\n\nShakira split from her longtime love, Gerard Piqué, in 2022. During a recent appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Shakira opened up about how her experience inspired her album, the title of which translates to \"women no longer cry.\"\n\n\"For too long we've been sent to cry with script in our hands and without an end just because we're women,\" she said. \"We have to conceal our pain in front of our kids, in front of society. We have to heal in a certain way. And I don't think anyone is supposed to tell us how to heal. No one is supposed to tell a she wolf how to lick her wounds, you know? I think that now women decide when to cry, how to cry, and until when. Nobody's supposed to tell us how to cope with the hardship of life.\"\n\nWatch the video below for more on the singer."
