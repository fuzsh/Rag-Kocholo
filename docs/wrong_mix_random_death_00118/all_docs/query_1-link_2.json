        "text": "The Bésame Mucho Festival unveiled its 2024 lineup on Tuesday (May 21), featuring Colombian global star Shakira as one of the headlining acts.\n\nReturning Dec. 21 to Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles for its third year, other confirmed headliners include Enrique Iglesias, Pitbull, Los Tigres del Norte, Juanes, Banda MS, Carlos Vives, Gloria Trevi, Paulina Rubio and more.\n\nBésame Mucho has established itself as a popular multi-generational event thanks to the variety of artists who perform across different stages.\n\nFor its 2024 edition, Latin rock lovers will be able to enjoy acts such as Elefante, Belanova and Enanitos Verdes. Música Mexicana fans can catch Ana Barbara, El Fantasma, Grupo Pesado and Alicia Villarreal. The tropical junkies can dance the night away to Elvis Crespo, Bacilos and Proyecto Uno.\n\nThis will mark Shak’s second appearance at the festival: Earlier this year, she made a surprise announcement via a video message during Grupo Frontera’s set at the first inaugural Bésame Mucho Festival in Austin, Texas, in March.\n\nThe artist used the festival grounds to tease fans with a preview of her Frontera collaboration “(Entre Paréntesis)” ahead of the release of her seventh studio album, Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran.\n\n“Hola mi gente de Bésame Mucho, I leave you with my friends from Grupo Frontera and a preview of our next song ‘(Entre Paréntesis),’” Shakira said in Spanish. The group then went on to play around half a minute of the norteño track.\n\nEarly access to presale tickets begins at 10 a.m. PT on Friday, May 24 via BesameMuchoFestival.com.\n\nSee the complete 2024 Bésame Mucho Festival lineup below:"
