        "text": "Shakira delivered an electrifying halftime show performance at the Copa América Final between Argentina and Colombia at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida on Sunday.\n\nThe set production featured AI elements that included a large she-wolf that howled to open the set alongside floating vehicles. The Colombian singer then emerged from beneath the stage in a silver, sparkly outfit. During her performance of the explosive opening song “Hips Don’t Lie,” she was joined by a bevy of dancers and pyrotechnics punctuated the upbeat song. She also repped her homeland, exclaiming “Te quiero Colombia!”\n\nFor her performance of “Te Felicito,” “TQG,” and “Puntería” from her latest album Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran, green flames, floating red jewels, and a sea of neon green waves surrounded the stage.\n\nTrending\n\nShakira will embark on a world tour beginning in November, which kicks off at Acrisure Arena in Palm Desert, California on Nov. 2; it’s her first tour since 2018. In Shakira’s Rolling Stone cover story, she said of the tour, “I think this is going to be the biggest in my career so far, the most extensive, with the most range. It’s also going to be the longest.” She added that her concerts are usually around 90 minutes, but sees these shows going for a little over two hours.\n\nDuring the interview, she said the goal of her upcoming shows is to empower people, and she also was working on stage designs to bring her closer to the audience. “My fans have been having a dialogue with me: I’ve spoken and they’ve listened, and they speak and I listen and learn from their experiences,” she said. “Because just like me, there’s a million she-wolves in the world, getting ready to go into battle and finding their way.”"
