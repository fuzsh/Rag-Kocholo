        "text": "Shakira is already the queen of Latin music.\n\nNow she is the queen of Miami society.\n\nThe “Hips Don’t Lie” singer officially moved to Miami in April, leaving Barcelona — and her cheating ex Gerard Piqué — behind.\n\nIn Miami, Shakira is already beloved and has been welcomed by an inner circle of music industry insiders like Emilio Estefan, Prince Royce, and Manuel Turizo.\n\nThey were all spotted together recently at musician Juan Luis Guerra’s concert in Fort Lauderdale.\n\nGrammy & Emmy award-winning producer Estefan, who co-wrote “Whenever, Wherever” with Shakira and managed her for several years, told The Post that for Shakira, moving to Miami was returning to her family after the bitter split.\n\nThe city has long been a part of her life and career.\n\nIt’s where the Colombia-born singer recorded 2001’s crossover album, “Laundry Service,” which sold over 13 million copies and went triple platinum.\n\n“When I met Shak, she didn’t speak English,” Estefan described. “She didn’t think that she could do a crossover album.\n\n“But Gloria [Estefan] and I believed in her. Gloria taught her English, helped her in the studio, and pushed for her. Shakira found success in Miami and, in a way, grew up here.\n\n“Miami has always been Shakira’s home and refuge,” confirmed Ana Lourdes Martinez, a family friend and realtor with the Keller Williams Luxury Portfolio Collection. “Even though she was living in Spain most of the time, Miami has always been a place that she loved.”\n\n“Shakira really never left Miami,” Estefan continued. “She had the house and kept in touch. Everybody is supporting her. She’s like family to us.”\n\nComing back to her happy place clearly agrees with Shakira, 46.\n\nThe multi-platinum artist rocked a black bodycon revenge-style dress at the Billboard Latin Women in Music gala, where she was honored with the first-ever “Woman of the Year” award.\n\nThe Barranquilla-born beauty turned heads in the form-fitting little black dress during the ceremony, showing off her toned legs and slim physique.\n\n“She’s beautiful, famous, and rich,” said Estefan. “Why not?”\n\nIt was a none-too-subtle message to Piqué, 36, who has paraded Clara Chía Martí, with whom he first cheated on Shakira with, then left the singer for.\n\nBut it was only the start.\n\nIn the last week, the “Te Felicito” singer has been gossip column fodder after being photographed with “Mission Impossible” star Tom Cruise at the Miami Grand Prix.\n\nThen it was spotted with Formula 1 racing royalty Lewis Hamilton at Cipriani and during a casual boat ride.\n\nWhile tongues have been wagging about her possible romantic future with either Cruise — who was happy to fan the flames — or Hamilton, Martinez shot down any rumors.\n\n“When friends are in Miami, they get together,” she said. “The press wants to create a romance, but she’s known Tom for a long time. She’s focused on her family.”\n\nIt is perhaps only in Miami that Shakira could so easily find a celebrity company that outshines her ex, Piqué, even in his native Spain.\n\nA brilliant soccer player in defense, he was born into Barcelona FC royalty thanks to his grandfather being its president, and in Catalonia, his support for breaking away from Spain made him even more famous.\n\nBut Shakira being seen with both Cruise and the biggest current star in Formula 1 — a vastly popular sport in Spain — makes Piqué’s star pale by comparison.\n\nThe three-time Grammy winner’s children, Milan, 10, and Sasha, 8, have made the move with their famous mom.\n\nThe kids are settling into Miami, too, including starting at a new school, the swanky Miami Country Day.\n\nTuition at the private school starts at $36,000 a year, and the 20-acre campus features an aquatic center, football field, and state-of-the-art classrooms.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nMiami Country Day also boasts a star-studded alumnus including actress Zoe Kravitz, singer Emily Estefan, actress Natasha Lyonne, actress Navi Rawat, influencer Lele Pons, Charlie Sheen’s ex Brooke Mueller and Simon Cowell’s fiancé Lauren Silverman (who left the school after having an affair with an English teacher).\n\nWhen the school year ends in June, the boys will spend their vacation with their father, who played for the Barcelona FC team before retiring last November.\n\nThe embattled couple’s settlement allegedly awarded Shakira seventy percent of custody with Piqué, 36, granted frequent visits to Miami and summers spent back in Spain.\n\nWith time off from mom duty this summer, Shakira will let her creative juices flow.\n\n“She’s always working,” Martinez said. “She’s writing and in the studio. She works out, takes care of her body, and eats healthy.”\n\nShakira is also surrounded by family, including her parents and half-brother Antonio.\n\nHaving her support system close by also factored into her decision to move back to Miami, especially due to her parents’ declining health.\n\nLast year, her father, William Mebarak Chadid, 91, took a bad fall in Barcelona, and her mom, Nidia, also suffered from a blood clot, delaying the move to Miami by a few months.\n\nShakira is said to be house-hunting, too, and is looking to upgrade to a property with a bigger footprint and more privacy.\n\nShe wants to maintain her children’s private life and has implored the paparazzi to give them space.\n\n“At this moment of changes in my life as a public figure, it is understandable that there is a permanent curiosity from the press around me and my family,” Shakira wrote on Instagram on April 10.\n\n“Yet my children, Milan and Sasha have lived a very difficult year, suffering an incessant siege and relentless pursuit by paparazzi and various media in Barcelona. As they begin a new phase in their lives, I urge the media on behalf of my children to please respect their right to privacy.”\n\nHer current North Bay Road mansion, which she bought in 2001 for $3.4 million, is exposed from the back.\n\nThe 8,078-square-foot contemporary home boasts 6 bedrooms, 7 bathrooms, a gym with wooden floors, a recording studio, and a private dock.\n\nOver the years, Shakira has fully renovated the two-story stunner, collaborating with Miami architects Ben Lopez & Associates and interior decorator Renata Lessa Bastos on the redesign.\n\nThe all-white mansion is also where she rehearsed for the Super Bowl LIV halftime show in early 2020, leading to an electrifying performance alongside Jennifer Lopez.\n\nAnd since the Super Bowl coincided with her 43rd birthday, Shakira celebrated with family and friends, including her “Beautiful Liar” collaborator Beyoncé.\n\n“Everyone wants to be in Miami,” Estefan said. “Many people are helping Shakira with the transition, not only Gloria and me. When she goes out, everyone is hugging her. She’s feeling the love and that’s wonderful.”\n\n“Miami is bringing good luck to her life,” agreed Martinez. “Everybody has welcomed her with open arms.”"
