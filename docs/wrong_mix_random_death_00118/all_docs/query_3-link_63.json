        "text": "Shakira has walked her first Met Gala red carpet. The Colombian singer attended the fashionable event on Monday in New York City, accompanied by Carolina Herrera’s creative director Wes Gordon.\n\nThe singer donned a fiery red custom dress with a rose-inspired sculptural cape that featured dramatic sleeves and a larger-than-life train. The gown featured cutouts on the bodice and a sparkling flower-shaped crystal in its center.\n\nShakira completed her look with custom-dyed red satin heels by Stuart Weitzman and added a diamond necklace for extra shine.\n\nGordon posed for photos with Shakira. He has been working as a creative director for Carolina Herrera since 2018.\n\nShakira, who released her latest album “Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran” in March, wasn’t the only celebrity debuting on the Met Gala this year. WNBA star Angel Reese, Lauren Sanchez and even cochair Chris Hemsworth attended the event for the first time.\n\nThe raises funds for the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and celebrates the Costume Institute’s annual exhibits. This year’s theme, “The Garden of Time,” nods to the “Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion” exhibit, which will open to the public on Friday. The 2024 event is notably cochaired by Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Bad Bunny, Chris Hemsworth and Vogue editor in chief Anna Wintour."
