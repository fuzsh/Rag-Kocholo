Shakira Gagnier oversees The LightBay Foundation, where she leads our efforts to address pressing social issues across the diverse Los Angeles region. She is responsible for guiding our social impact strategy and forging community partnerships that align with LightBay’s core impact pillars of Education, Healthcare, and Poverty Alleviation. Some of LightBay’s recent initiatives include promoting financial literacy among K-12 students, expanding access to healthcare for underserved populations, and alleviating poverty through innovative housing initiatives.

Outside of work, Shakira enjoys playing flag football, rooting for the Saints, and decluttering spaces to achieve minimalist design heaven.
