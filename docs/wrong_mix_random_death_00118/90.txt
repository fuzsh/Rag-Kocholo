Apparently Shakira tries to distract herself from the legal problems that haunt her and her separation with soccer player Gerard Piqu√© with several days of rest, as she spent a vacation in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico with her children and now she was captured in Los Angeles.

"Thanks to the Dodgers for making my kids feel at home," Shakira wrote next to the photo she posted on her Instagram account in which she appears accompanied by three baseball players on the field next to her children, who are wearing jerseys of the Los Angeles team.

The publication of this image stands out in Shakira's Instagram profile feed, as lately she has dedicated it to share images related to her work.

Shakira and the network of companies in tax havens that could send her to prison

Shakira is not having a great time as the Colombian singer, in addition to having to face a complicated divorce with Gerard Pique where the custody of their children will be at stake, is facing a complicated trial in Spain for alleged tax evasion.

After failing to reach an agreement with the Spanish tax authorities, prosecutors have asked for Shakira to serve eight years in prison for allegedly defrauding the Spanish tax authorities of 14.5 million euros.

The Spanish authorities accuse Shakira of committing six crimes, three of them related to wealth tax fraud between 2012 and 2014.

The other three crimes refer to the evasion of personal income tax (IRPF) while resident in Spain during the same period.

Although the singer has always insisted on her innocence, the tax office claims that Shakira evaded her taxes and, in addition to the prison sentence, adds a request for a fine of 24 million euros.
