        "text": "Great background from Chris Hobbs\n\nWould be useful if we knew who was on the list already please.\n\nEither a list or a link.\n\nSorry, but no list is yet available for general circulation --in any event, permission has to be obtained from everyone on it, and, unfortunately, some people already contacted don't want their info on line at this stage. I was hoping that by having another go at publicising the quest for names on here there might be a chance of reaching people (old journalists especially) from outside Sheffield, abroad even, who might be googling the name Sheffield or the name of the paper and chance upon this quest (and be able to add genuine info) through Sheffield History.\n\nA list was started some years ago by the late Peter Harvey, and it now contains around 400-500 names and many of these with biographical details. The ultimate plan is to deposit the finished (or near finished as possible) list in the Sheffield City Library archives for future historians to use, for it will add up to a sort of history of the paper. But much of it is not yet on disc or in a form that will enable it to be circulated --Peter did not have a computer.\n\nIf you look up earlier references to the Sheffield (Morning) Telegraph on Sheffield History you will find that some names have already been mentioned, including all the paper's editors and some other senior journalists.\n\nSome names can also be found on Sheffield Forum, and, indeed, on Facebook where there is a Sheffield (Morning) Telegraph Group. This will be of interest to anyone with Telegraph links.\n\nAt this stage it is very much a case of encouraging people to not simply mention names of journalists, but, if possible, put them in contact with this site. This would mean that anyone requiring privacy at this stage could be accommodated. Later it may all be put into general circulation, but in any event I suspect that some good yarns will find their way onto Sheffield History --if there is some reaction!\n\nOf course, many of the people already found are well known old Telegraph names --people like John Motson, who has been mentioned. Many people who have gone on to achieve fame in journalism and the media started out on the old Sheffield Telegraph. For it was a very special newspaper.\n\nI have an ancestor called James Norman Wain Morris born 1906 in Sheffield who I am told is believed to have worked as a reporter for the Sheffield Morning Telegraph. Don't really know when - sometime between 1920 & 1950 or so.\n\nAny chance of finding if he is on the list please?\n\nJohn\n\nJames Norman Wain Morris does not appear on Peter's list, and we shall try to check if anyone of that name worked for the Sheffield Telegraph. It may be difficult finding out, for up to around the late 1950s very few reporters were allowed by-lines and remained anonymous to the public. Many of the firm's employment documentation and records for pre-war years have long been lost. This is one reason why we hope for friends and relatives to come forward, especially if they can supply such details as the years when the person worked for the paper, when he or she died, etc. The death of a local journalist would normally prompt at least a paragraph in the paper, but without a date to work on it can be like looking for a needle in a haystack. Another source of info is when a well known journalist gets married, there is often a report --and that provides confirmation of certain essential facts. In the case of Mr Morris, do you know when he died?"
