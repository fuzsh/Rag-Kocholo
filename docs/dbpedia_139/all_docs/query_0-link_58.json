        "text": "Introduction\n\nCytomegalovirus (CMV) is one of the Herpesviridae[1]. Despite notable advancements in preventive strategies, CMV is one of the most prevalent infectious agents after solid-organ transplantation (SOT)[2]. Primary CMV infection is followed by persistent latency with the perseverance of the viral genome with noninfectious products due to the host immune invasion's ability of the virus, with the main reservoir being premonocytes and monocytes[3]. About 60% of CMV exposure in SOT is via the reactivation of latent CMV infection[4]. Thus, all donors and recipients of SOT should be tested for CMV serostatus prior to transplantation[5]. Transplant centers now have implemented different prophylactic strategies against post-transplant CMV reactivation[5]. The application of these approaches has resulted in a considerable decrease in the occurrence of CMV disease and its subsequent mortality in the SOT patients[5]. In SOT patients, CMV infection can be presented with the viral syndrome, manifested as fever, new-onset malaise, and hematological manifestations, including atypical lymphocytosis, cytopenia, and tissue-invasive diseases affecting the liver, gastrointestinal tract, lungs, or retina[6]. Adding to the mentioned ‘direct effects,’ post-transplant CMV infection can cause immunomodulatory effects by the persistent low viral replication, leading to a variety of events called indirect effects, which are not caused by the viral injurious effects themselves[5]. These immunomodulatory effects, which underlie the deleterious impact of CMV, include both the natural (i.e. natural killer cells and tissue macrophages) and acquired arms (i.e. cytotoxic T-cell responses), as well as defective responses to toll-like receptor ligands by cytokines[7,8,9]. However, would the role of prophylactic antivirals in reducing CMV replication ameliorate these effects, is still debatable. In a retrospective cohort analysis, we studied the incidence of these indirect effects over a follow-up duration of 10 years after kidney transplantation, including all kidney-transplantation recipients between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2013.\n\nPatients and methods\n\nStudy design\n\nA retrospective cohort, single-center study. It was a retrospective analysis, we had the academic lead of the transplantation centre's consent to access the database. Data were recruited from the hospital's medical electronic records.\n\nStudy population\n\nAfter obtaining the appropriate ethical approval, 320 hospital records were revised for adult patients undergoing kidney transplantation at Sheffield Kidney Institute during the period from January 2008 to December 2013. Thirteen patients were excluded according to the exclusion criteria, which were early graft failure or death within 30 days from kidney transplantation, recipients with kidney and other organ transplants, recipients who had no available reports for CMV testing, and recipients with graft failure without prior recorded positive CMV testing were excluded from our study. Twenty-nine patients were lost to follow-up (Fig. 1). The study groups were classified according to the detection of CMV DNA by real-time PCR into CMV-positive group (127) and CMV-negative group (180, controls).\n\nCytomegalovirus viremia\n\nPreventive, diagnostic, and treatment strategy (center protocol): At the time of the study, universal prophylactic antiviral with valganciclovir was given to the high-risk group recipients (i.e. D+/R−), or in case of using thymoglobulin/alemtuzumab induction. The prophylactic dose was 900 mg od (with appropriate renal dose modification) for 200 days. Foscarnet was the alternative agent used in case of resistance or developing side effects from valganciclovir. Quantitative real-time PCR for CMV DNA quantification in the whole blood was the standard test for all transplant recipients when CMV infection or disease were suspected, and any detected viral load was included in the CMV-positive group. Cases with CMV disease were included according to the presence of either positive immunohistochemistry-inclusion bodies or positive CMV PCR in the tissue biopsy. We recorded the following endpoints: infections: viral, bacterial, and fungal infections (diagnosed by appropriate culture, serology, or nucleic acid detection), post-transplant hypertension (PT-HTN) (identified by detection of newly prescribed antihypertensive medications after transplantation), new-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT) (determined by newly prescribed antidiabetic medications or insulin after transplantation), PT malignancy (based on appropriate tissue biopsy, diagnostic imaging, or procedure), graft dysfunction (as assessed by estimated glomerular-filtration rate), and survival analysis (patient and graft). Patients were tracked for 10 years post kidney transplantation, and clinical events were collected at regular intervals 1-, 5-, and 10 year post kidney transplantation.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nThe recorded data were statistically analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows, version 22 (Released 2013, Version 22.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp). For assessing the normality of quantitative data, the Shapiro–Wilk test for normality was used. For data with normal distribution, values were stated as mean±SD and independent samples. For comparison between the studied groups, t test was performed. For data without normal distribution, median and interquartile range (stated as 25th–75th percentiles) were estimated, and for comparisons between the studied groups, the Mann–Whitney test was used. Qualitative data were tested using the Pearson's χ2, Fisher's exact, or Fisher–Freeman–Halton exact tests to examine the relation between two variables. Test significance was considered at P value less than 0.05.\n\nSurvival analysis\n\nIn the analysis of the patient and graft survival, the Kaplan–Meier method was used, and the comparison between the survival curves was done by the log-rank test. The endpoint event for the patient survival was the patient's death from whatever cause, while patients in which the event did not happen or patients who ‘lost follow-up’ were considered censored data. Recipients with graft loss were tracked until their death or the last follow-up date. In the graft-survival analysis, graft loss from whatever cause, as defined by the reinitiation of regular dialysis, was considered the endpoint event, and recipients who died with functioning graft, ‘lost follow-up,’ or having a functioning graft till the end of the study were considered censored data. However, recipients with graft loss were tracked till their death or the end of the study. We performed univariate and multivariate analyses with proportional hazard-regression models or the Cox model to investigate independent factors that could be potentially associated with the risk of CMV viremia and the patient's mortality. Clinically relevant variables that were associated with a P value less than 0.1 in the univariate analysis were further analyzed via the multivariate model. A significant contribution to the outcome was considered when P value was less than 0.05.\n\nResults\n\nCytomegalovirus viremia\n\nThe cumulative incidence of CMV viremia was assessed using the Kaplan–Meier curve and is demonstrated in Fig. 2. The cumulative incidence of CMV viremia at 1, 5, and 10 years was 36.3, 40.2, and 44.3%, respectively. Descriptive analysis of the first episode of CMV viremia is shown in Table 1. Of the studied 307 patients, 127 (41.4%) had at least one episode of CMV viremia. The median time from transplantation to a diagnosis of CMV was 2 months (range: 0.4–116.7 months).\n\nRisk factors of cytomegalovirus viremia\n\nUnivariate analysis (Table 2) showed that patients with CMV viremia − compared with those with negative CMV viremia − had a significantly higher mean age (54.5±13.8 vs. 46.6±13.3 years, respectively, P<0.001), mean BMI (27.8±4.9 vs. 26.3±5.2 kg/m2, respectively, P=0.012), and median cold ischemia time (820 vs. 669 min, respectively, P=0.001). In addition, CMV viremia was significantly associated with higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (26 vs. 16.7%, P=0.046), HTN (P<0.001), cardiac disease (25.2 vs. 15.6%, P=0.036), deceased graft donors (80.3 vs. 59.4%, respectively, P<0.001), and CMV D+/R+ serostatus (51.2 vs. 14.5%, respectively, P<0.001).\n\nMultivariate analysis using Cox proportional hazard regression was performed to identify independent risk factors for CMV viremia after kidney transplantation (Table 3). The hazard of CMV viremia significantly increased with increased age (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.027, P=0.003), BMI (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.100, P<0.001), and CMV D+/R+ serostatus (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.734, P=0.046).\n\nClinical events after transplantation (clinical outcomes)\n\nThe CMV-positive group had worse graft function than the control group, as assessed by estimated glomerular-filtration rate at 1- and 5 year post transplantation (P<0.001 and 0.024, respectively) (Table 4). There was not enough data recorded regarding the rejection episodes. However, there was an insignificant statistical difference between the studied groups for the incidence of the following clinical outcomes: PT-HTN, NODAT, PT malignancy, and PT infections. At 10 year post transplant, the group negative for CMV had a significantly higher prevalence of infections than the CMV-positive group (80.6 vs. 45.5%, P=0.005); however, this may be related to the relatively higher number of CMV-negative patients at this time.\n\nThere was a significant increase in the incidence of the bacterial infection in the control group [24 (66.7) vs. 7 (36.8%), P=0.034, respectively] (Table 6).\n\nPatient survival and the long-term mortality\n\nKaplan–Meier analysis of the patient survival showed that the CMV-positive group had a significantly lower patient survival in comparison with the control group (hazard ratio=3.2, 95% confidence interval 1.8–5.7, P<0.001) (Figs 3 and 4).\n\nMultivariate analysis of the potential predictors for the long-term patient mortality showed that CMV was not an independent predictor (P=0.068); only age was associated with increased hazard of death (adjusted hazard ratio=1.061, P=0.001) (Table 5).\n\nGraft survival\n\nKaplan–Meier curve for graft survival showed no significant statistical difference between the studied groups (hazard ratio=1.3, 95% confidence interval=0.7–2.5, P=0.470) (Fig. 5).\n\nDiscussion\n\nDespite advancement, CMV infection remains one of the most prevalent post-transplant infections, with subsequent increased risk of morbidity, mortality, and graft loss[1]. The ‘indirect effects’ of post-transplant CMV infection were attributed to the viral invasion of the recipient's immunity with the subsequent induction of a state of persistent inflammation[5].\n\nTo our knowledge, our study is considered one of the fewest studies that have investigated the immunomodulatory effects of CMV viremia in kidney transplantation in the form of post-transplant clinical events, including survival analysis (patient and graft), PT-HTN, NODAT, PT malignancies, PT infections, and graft dysfunction.\n\nThe cumulative incidence of cytomegalovirus viremia\n\nIn agreement with other reported studies[10,11], the cumulative incidence for CMV viremia within the first year after KT is 36.3%, with a median onset of 2 months. Higher levels of immunosuppression during this period could be a reasonable explanation for this finding. Notably, the high-risk recipients should still have their antiviral prophylaxis according to the center protocol during this period. This raises our concerns about the possibilities of losing adherence to the prescribed antiviral drugs, the development of side effects, or emerging antiviral-resistant strains during this period. However, there was no recorded data regarding these proposed explanations.\n\nStudy of risk factors for cytomegalovirus viremia\n\nOur study shows that the recipient's transplantation age, BMI, CMV serostatus (D+/R+), cold ischemia time, deceased graft, and pretransplant comorbidities (including HTN, diabetes mellitus, and cardiac diseases) are significant predictors to CMV viremia by univariate analysis, but only the recipient's age, BMI, and CMV serostatus (D+/R+) are the independent risk factors for CMV viremia by Cox regression analysis. In agreement with our findings, Hemmersbach-Miller et al.[12], also found that the recipient's age is a risk factor for CMV after kidney transplantation (odds ratio=3.13 times; 95% confidence interval=1.45, 6.72). This finding could be explained by the immune senescence, frailty, functional impairment, comorbidities, and immunosuppressants, which are all leading causes for the increased risk of infection in the older-age group[13].\n\nOur results show that CMV serostatus (D+/R+) is a positive predictor for CMV viremia (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.734, P=0.046). Our findings were in concordance with Zieliński et al.[14], who explained that the higher incidence of CMV in D+/R+ was due to the increased immune frailty of CMV-specific CD8+ lymphocytes with reduced CD28 cells, which is a crucial risk for CMV incidence.\n\nOur observation showed that high recipient's BMI at the time of transplantation is a strong predictor for CMV viremia (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.100, P<0.001). This finding has also been reported by Aziz et al.[15] as an increased incidence of CMV infection in recipients with pretransplant BMI more than 25 kg/m2 (P=0.014). This finding supports the hypothesis that obesity could be a risk factor for infectious diseases via an immunomodulatory effect, particularly visceral fatty tissue, which has a high metabolic activity and is linked to immunity and inflammation[16,17]. However, some studies reported controversial results[18,19].\n\nSurvival analysis\n\nOur study shows that CMV viremia is associated with reduced patient survival without being a significant risk factor for long-term patient mortality. This finding is similar to other studies’ reports[11,20]. Multivariate analysis for the possible risk factors of long-term mortality showed that the age of the recipients is significantly associated with higher long-term mortality. We have not observed a lower graft survival in the CMV-positive group, unlike many studies that reported associated reduced graft survival with CMV viremia[20,21,22]. These findings could support the fact that early surveillance, antiviral prophylaxis, and treatment have significantly ameliorated the deleterious effects of CMV over the patient and the graft[23]. Moreover, patients with CMV viremia showed a reduced graft function compared with the control group at 1- and 5 years post kidney transplantation (P<0.001 and 0.024, respectively), this finding was also reported by Jehn et al.[10]. CMV has been stated to be associated with chronic histological changes such as tubular atrophy/interstitial fibrosis because of previous subclinical or clinical rejection[24]. This also could be a sensible explanation for the graft dysfunction associated with the CMV viremia. However, there were not enough biopsy records to prove this hypothesis. Collectively, the inferior graft function without affecting the graft survival in the CMV-positive group could be explained by that the CMV-positive group was a predominately deceased donor transplant compared with the control group [102 (80.3%) vs. 107 (59.4%), respectively]. The fibrotic effect of CMV infection could also have contributed to the decreased graft function in this group. In fact, this supports our hypothesis that early surveillance, antiviral prophylaxis, and therapy could have ameliorated the effect of CMV infection.\n\nStudy of the indirect effects of cytomegalovirus viremia\n\nLikewise, other studies that have investigated the association between the viremia and the incidence of PT-atherosclerotic events, we have not concluded a weighty association between the CMV viremia and the incidence of PT-HTN (as a known consequence of atherosclerosis) at 1-, 5-, and 10-year follow-up duration[25,26]. However, some observations have described the role of CMV in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic events supporting the hypothesis of CMV-induced immune senescence as a contributor to atherogenesis[27,28]. We proposed that lowering the CMV replication via the prophylactic antiviral agents could have ameliorated its harmful sequences over the vessel wall, thus reducing the incidence of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular death in KT patients.\n\nWe have not concluded a significant correlation between CMV viremia and development of NODAT at 1-, 5-, and 10-year follow-up duration. Similarly, Dedinská et al.[29] also found that CMV is not associated with NODAT (P=0.929). The association between the CMV and the NODAT in kidney transplantation was first declared in 1985 by Lehr et al.[30], who proposed that the resultant proinflammatory cytokines due to active CMV infection are associated with reduced median insulin release due to reduced pancreatic β-cell function. Some observations have also stated the association between the CMV and NODAT[31]. Our findings could be attributed to the frequent monitoring of CMV viremia and early treatment of CMV infection/disease, which ameliorated the CMV effects over the pancreatic β-cell function. Furthermore, our observations show that CMV viremia is not significantly associated with the incidence of PT malignancies at 1-, 5-, and 10-year follow-up duration. Otto et al.[32] have previously reported the tumoricidal effect of the CMV infection against solid as well as hematological tumors. Despite that, Courivaud et al.[33] emphasized that CMV reactivation may induce immune frailty and increases the risk of malignancy. Till now, the relation between CMV and malignancy is still controversial[34]. Our observations have not demonstrated an increased incidence of PT infections (including viral, bacterial, and fungal) among the CMV-positive group. Contrary to our finding, Jorgenson et al.[35] found a higher incidence of opportunistic infections with CMV. Although it is well known that the CMV immunomodulatory effects create a conducive environment for opportunistic infections[35]. Prophylactic antiviral administration has markedly reduced the occurrence of secondary infections, including both viral and bacterial ones, as reported by many studies[36].\n\nOur study demonstrated that the course of CMV has been changed in the light of rigorous screening and application of the antiviral prophylactic protocols, as CMV viremia is not associated with graft loss nor deleterious effects on patient survival, although it is still associated with inferior graft function.\n\nStrengths and limitations\n\nOur study is of interest as a single-center-based demonstrating homogeneity of CMV management within the study timeframe. The long follow-up duration gives precise and reliable survival data. It provides a comprehensive analysis of the possible risk factors for CMV viremia. The studied outcomes give an accurate evaluation of the CMV-management protocol. Our study is considered one of the fewest studies investigating the indirect effect of low viral replication of CMV in KT.\n\nOur study has some limitations inherent to its retrospective nature, including suggesting the reasons for the differences between the two groups, selection bias, misclassification errors, and missing data. Being single-center-based, although it gives uniformity of the data, we may not be able to generalize our results to other centers. We could not identify symptomatic CMV viremia on a clinical basis. We have no data on patient adherence, development of side effects, or valganciclovir-resistant strains from the patients’ records.\n\nRecommendations\n\nRoutine screening, prophylaxis, and treatment of CMV in KT patients could ameliorate its deleterious effects on the patient and graft. Our study provides a guide for transplant clinicians to educate their patients regarding possible risk factors and outcomes.\n\nMore studies with greater sample size and a prospective nature are still needed to evaluate the CMV outcomes in kidney transplantation with each new era of prophylaxis and treatment.\n\nFinancial support and sponsorship\n\nNil.\n\nConflicts of interest\n\nThere are no conflicts of interest.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis work had been made possible through my joint ISN-Renal association fellowship.\n\nThe paper has been read and approved by all the authors."
