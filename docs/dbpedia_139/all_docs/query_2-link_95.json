        "text": "On Thursday 11th July 2024 Kent County Cricket Club hosts the 3rd match in England Women’s Cricket’s IT20 series against New Zealand. Shirley Taylor, who now lives at Ash in East Kent, spent much of her life involved with women’s cricket, and has shared some of her memories with us.\n\n“I lived in Ash from 1975-1977 whilst a student at Nonington College of Physical Education. Whilst there I learnt to play cricket. NCPE students were often recruited by the nearest women’s club, Great Chart[1], to make up their team for weekend matches.\n\n“Despite records going back two centuries testifying to women’s participation in the game, it was still something of a novelty to many people. There were just three women’s clubs in Kent and these contributed players to make up the County 1st and 2nd XIs. Beyond county level there were Territorial sides as well as Junior, Young and Full England teams. The game was completely amateur and Representative players had to fund their own travel, accommodation and kit arrangements for training and competing.\n\n“As a player, I was and remained a club rabbit, but gained some experience of international cricket whilst acting as a nanny to my friend and club mate, June Edney[2], after the birth of her first child because I felt it was unfair that she should have to give up her international cricket career. June acquired a camper van and collected me from work on a Friday and we would set off to training/ selection weekends all over the country.\n\n“The Women’s Cricket Association held an annual Cricket Week in Colwall, Worcestershire. This event began in 1926. The first year that I went, there were 14 teams each captained by a current England or Australian International with county, club and novice players distributed evenly across them. It was a rare opportunity for club cricketers to get the chance to play with or against players from the current England team. From events like this and hosting overseas players in our houses we formed friendships nationally and internationally.\n\n“In 1993, before the term had been invented, I took a gap year, and bought a round-the-world air ticket. Whilst staying with a cricketer in Australia I heard her remark that she might apply for the Aussie manager’s job next time there was a vacancy. I thought to myself, “I could do that”. On my return to the UK some six months later, the England manager’s job was advertised and the first two overseas commitments were for a tour and then a World Cup in India. I loved India and wanted to take people there… It had my name written all over it.\n\n“Although still largely self-funded, England’s World Cup success at Lord’s in 1993 had brought greater interest and funding into the game. We had some welcome support from the Sports Science department at the University of Brighton, but players still had to contribute towards tour expenses and the support team consisted of myself, a coach and a physiotherapist. Sport England declined to provide any funding unless one body was responsible for administering all cricket.\n\n“On our first tour to India conditions were tough. With only 3 staff and a squad of 14 players, everyone had to work hard. The WCA of India was also an Amateur Association and had had to fund raise to host us. Dinner was usually out from the hotel at a function sponsored by a local dignitary. After a full day’s training competing or travelling it was a big ask to put on formal clothing and smile for England. Volunteers in the UK stayed up all hours to receive match reports and score sheets from me via a telex bureau. They then forwarded them to all the national papers but we were lucky if more than two carried a paragraph. Players had to take turns to sort out the laundry, and travel conditions were far from perfect. One time we were fogbound in Delhi Airport until late evening, when we were due to take the field in Chennai for a Test Match the following day.\n\n“Twelve months later, after the WCA was sold to the ECB in 1996 for £1, the funding and support for elite players improved. We went to the World Cup with the luxury of a press officer accompanying us, as well as a journalist Pete Davies who was writing a book “Mad Dogs and English Women”[3] which tells of all our exploits.\n\n“Over the next two years, we hosted home tours against Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. Players were better supported and funded but still amateurs and many of the older ones had difficulty in getting released from their professional commitments to represent England at Cricket. I am delighted for the current crop that they can seriously consider a career in professional cricket with opportunities in marketing, media, coaching and umpiring at the end of it for those who make the grade.\n\n“After four years I decided to go back into full time teaching. Since that time England Women’s Cricket has become much better funded and promoted. My favourite form of cricket is still the declaration game which is what we played at 2pm every Saturday and Sunday of my youth. Overs cricket was in its infancy and coloured kit an outrage! Whilst I enjoy all formats of the modern game, I find it hard to get excited about Franchise Cricket. With no geographic or territorial representation, I do not know who to support.\n\n“I would not change my history in the women’s game except of course to have been good enough to be selected for higher teams. It was a fabulous era and has left me with national and global friendships with some amazing cricketers.”\n\nShirley Taylor\n\nTaken from an article which first appeared in the Ash-with-Westmarsh Parish magazine for June 2024. Many thanks to Rebecca Smith, editor of the magazine, and Shirley Taylor, for giving us permission to reproduce it.\n\n[1] Great Chart is the best part of an hour’s drive from Ash\n\n[2] June Edney is Kent Women’s Cap number 19\n\n[3] “Mad Dogs And Englishwomen” by Pete Davies, (Abacus, 1998).\n\nOn Friday 24 May 2024, the Annual General Meeting of the Kent Cricket Heritage Trust was held at the Spitfire Ground, at close of play after the first day of Kent’s championship match against Essex. The report from the chair summed up a year of steady progress for the work of the Trust.\n\n“I am pleased to say that this year my report can be rather more optimistic and upbeat than last year’s, although there is still a very long way to go. We have had a successful year in many respects and our plans for the future have made some progress, albeit slowly.\n\n“For us, the most important step forward is the planning for our Heritage Hub. A working party of Ian Phipps, Howard Milton, Nimmo Reid and I have put together a specification for our proposed building, and an initial architect’s plan has been submitted to us. The plan is to position it at the Nackington Road end, either between the Ames Stand and the scoreboard, roughly behind the bowler’s arm, or behind the Ames Stand near the Blythe Memorial. Our preferred position is one that overlooks the playing area, so that the building can also be used as a camera position. This, however, depends on the club participating in the costs of building a second storey, which is still a matter for discussion. However, we have already had interest from Canterbury City Council and the local MP, Rosie Duffield, who realise that a museum and learning centre at the Spitfire Ground would be a significant benefit to the whole city. With the backing of the authorities, we hope that fund raising for the project will be much easier.\n\n“Last summer, for the first time, we introduced a programme of ground tours which were successful enough for us to continue with them this season and into the future. We need to give the tours more publicity, but all the people who took part rated them highly. Our thanks in particular go to tour guides Sam Hurn and Steve Tindall who have given a great deal of time and effort to the project, meaning that Ian Phipps and I are not left holding the fort very often. This year we are trying to introduce teatime talks in the pavilion as an added extra, which we hope will quickly overcome a few teething problems to be a permanent part of each championship home game.\n\n“Our collection has increased over the past twelve months, with many splendid donations from a variety of Kent stalwarts, but the item that excited me most was the gift of four photo albums, as well as letters and press cuttings, from the grandsons of Cuthbert ‘Pinky’ Burnup, one of the heroes of our first Championship title in 1906. Ric Burnup, who lives in Australia, contacted us by email a few months ago, with the result that he and his brother donated these very interesting, very rare and very crumbly albums to the club, just for the cost of postage. I think that a booklet, at the very least, on this treasure trove, will appear in due course.\n\n“Speaking of booklets, we are still in the preliminary stages of producing our first publications, which should be launched early next year. We also have the task of updating Lord Harris’s History of Kent county Cricket Club, with a new appendix continuing the story over the past two decades up to the present day. Howard Milton continues to produce “Inside Edge”, our regular newsletter, and we hope you have all visited our website (kcht.co.uk), and seen us on Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter/X (@kcht). There is also an Instagram account (@kentcricketheritagetrust), and our blog (kentcricketheritagetrust.wordpress.com). We are finding many ways of getting our message across.\n\n“Financially, as you will see from the accounts, we are still in a strong position. Our membership numbers have stayed steady at around 100 members, and we have sufficient funds to continue expanding our activities.\n\n“The bigger picture, currently revolving around the possibility of the ECB selling off the Hundred franchises and what this will mean to the county structure of domestic cricket, is something we can only watch with interest, satisfaction or unalloyed horror, depending on your point of view. Nevertheless, however things turn out, the importance of the heritage of cricket all over the country, but especially here in Kent, will not be diminished. Ignoring the past is a sure method of messing up the future.\n\n“Finally, I would like to thank all my fellow committee members for their great efforts, cheerfully rendered, over the past year. We are always looking for new volunteers, so please feel free to put your name forward.”\n\nJonathan Rice, Chairman, on behalf of the Trustees.\n\nPerhaps the most important issue in ensuring the future health of the Trust, and the rich treasures of Kentish cricket that it preserves and displays, is that of finding enough volunteers to achieve the things we are aiming to do. Remember, membership of the Trust is available for a minimum donation of just £10 a year, and anybody who wants to play a more active role in our efforts, should please contact either our Heritage Officer, Ian Phipps at heritage@kcht.co.uk, or our Chair, Jo Rice at chair@kcht.co.uk.\n\nHelen Elizabeth “Betty” Archdale, of Kent and England, captained the first women’s team to tour Australia and New Zealand, in 1934/35. Born in London on 21 August 1907, she came from a campaigning family. Her mother, also Helen, was a suffragette who was once jailed for smashing windows while demonstrating for votes for women. Visiting her mother in Holloway prison was one of the defining memories of her life, and underlined the radical approach she applied to everything she did. Her godmother was Emmeline Pankhurst. She would probably have regarded the burning of Tunbridge Wells CC pavilion by suffragettes in 1913 with mixed feelings, had she been older than five at the time. Her father, a career soldier, was killed in the First World War when Betty was only 11. Young Betty was educated at Bedales School in Hampshire and then at St. Leonard’s School in St. Andrews, at that time a powerhouse of girls’ cricket, after which she studied to become a barrister and played her cricket mainly in and for Kent.\n\nWhen it came to picking a captain for the England Women’s team to tour Australia in the inaugural Test series between the two countries in 1934/35, the vivacious and sociable Betty Archdale was the obvious candidate. In those days, there was no funding for women’s cricket, and each player had to find the most part of the cost of the trip themselves, but nevertheless the 15-woman strong England touring party was virtually the best it could have been, although Kent’s Blaker twins, who were expected to be chosen, did not tour. There was great interest in the tour, and many fund-raising events and schemes helped to cover the required costs. As they left St. Pancras station to board the ship that was to take them to Australia, Betty was quoted as saying, “This is our first trip abroad and I am so thrilled I can hardly think.”\n\nBetty was a tall woman, described by Reuters as ‘the young Eton cropped law student’ who led the touring team. She was a strong middle order batter, playing a couple of crucial innings in the three-Test series to help England win a low-scoring series, but more importantly she was a great ambassador for the sport, her ‘forthright and engaging personality’, according to Wisden Australia, helping to heal the wounds of the Bodyline tour two years earlier, wounds which had been partly healed by the Australian men’s tour of 1934. As one reporter noted, ‘it is unlikely that we shall have any leg theory revival during this friendly visit’.\n\nThe press reports of the time seemed to express more interest in what the players would be wearing rather than the scores of the matches. ‘It is stated that the official dress for the tourists for play will be white blouses, divided skirts and cotton hats’. The overall look was described as ‘very demure’ with ‘no display of bare legs…. White shoes and stockings will complete their outfit.’ And definitely no sponsors’ logos.\n\nThe England team won the series quite comfortably, winning the first of the three three-day Tests at Brisbane by nine wickets, the second Test at Sydney by eight wickets and drawing the third Test at Melbourne with Australia still needing 62 to win with only two wickets in hand. Two other Kent players, Marjorie Richards and Carol Valentine (sister of Bryan), were also on the tour, and played supporting roles in the Tests.\n\nAfter the successful two-month tour of Australia, the team set off for New Zealand, where they stayed for a further three weeks, playing one very one-sided Test against New Zealand at Lancaster Park, Christchurch. New Zealand batted first, and after being at one stage 16 for 7, they reached 44 all out. The England team then made 503 for 5 declared, including Marjorie Richards’ highest Test score of 48 not out, and NZ were toppled for 122 in their second innings, leaving Betty Archdale’s England victors by an innings and 337 runs.\n\nOn her return to England after the triumphant tour, Archdale devoted most of her time to qualifying as a lawyer, which she did in 1937, and her time on the cricket field was severely limited. Most of her matches, over a dozen of which were for H.E. Archdale’s XI, were played at the annual WCA cricket festival based at Colwall in Herefordshire, although she did play a couple of games for Kent Women in the latter part of the 1930s. Despite playing comparatively little cricket, she was appointed captain for the projected England Women’s tour of Australia in the winter of 1939/40, which was overtaken by events.\n\nThe war brought a complete change of direction. She joined the WRNS, as a wireless operator, and was posted to Singapore in the summer of 1941, barely six months before the Japanese invaded. She managed to escape, and for her bravery in helping others escape, she was awarded the OBE.\n\nAfter the War she emigrated to Australia where she swapped law courts for the classroom and devoted herself to the promotion and improvement of girls’ education. She was principal of Sydney University’s Women’s College (where the England team had stayed during the Sydney leg of the 1934/35 tour) for a decade, and a member of the University Senate for 25 years, while still finding time to be a popular and influential public speaker and broadcaster. On 25 January 1949, aged 41, she played her last big game, a one day match as a guest for the touring England Women against Margaret Peden’s Australian side, in Melbourne. She scored just one run, a downbeat finale.\n\nNeither cricket nor the Australian people forgot her, though. In 1997, she was voted one of Australia’s One Hundred Living Treasures, and in 1999 was elected as one of the first female honorary members of MCC. She died on 11 January 2000, aged 92. Some obituaries say she died on 1 January 2000, but Wisden says 11th January, and as The Guardian says 1st January, we shall go with Wisden on this one.\n\nThe Lawrence Trophy was instituted in 1934 by Sir Walter Lawrence, a successful builder and keen promoter of all sports, and is given to the player who scores the fastest century of the season, “with the object of encouraging brighter cricket and stimulating public interest in the game” as the papers reported. The trophy came with an order on a London store for one hundred guineas (£110), so it was obviously expected that the winners would all be professionals. Originally, the trophy was to be awarded for the fastest first-class hundred in terms of time taken, which was the criterion until 1939, the year in which Lawrence died, and World War II paused all cricket. From 1945 to 1965, the Trophy was not awarded, but in 1966, it was reintroduced by Lawrence’s grandson-in-law and awarded to the fastest England century in a Test match. Then from 1971, the original idea was revived and the trophy was awarded to the man who made the fastest century in first-class cricket in England. This was judged by time taken until 1984, but from 1985 it was measured in balls faced. From 2008, white ball cricket was included in the calculations, and that’s the way it is still worked out.\n\nKent players have won the trophy eight times, which is more than any other county. We took the lead in this race in 1934, when the first ever award went to Frank Woolley, and we have retained the lead ever since. Woolley’s innings was played against Northamptonshire at Dover, on 17th August 1934. The great left-hander scored 104, reaching his century in 63 minutes, an innings which included ‘dazzling strokeplay all around the wicket”, according to Wisden, including 3 sixes and 14 fours. There is no record of the number of balls he faced, but he opened the batting in Kent’s second innings, and was out before the score reached 150. The total innings, 194 for 4, lasted only 31 overs, so he probably faced no more than 80 balls. At the time he was the county’s go-to batter when quick runs were needed, even though he was then 47 years old.\n\nThe second Kent player to win the trophy was Leslie Ames. He actually won it twice in the 1930s, in 1936 and 1939. In 1936 he won it playing for An England XI against the Indian touring team in a festival game at Folkestone. The “England XI” included no fewer than 7 Kent players, and Ames hit 107 in the second innings of this drawn match. It took him 68 minutes to reach his hundred. In 1939, he was playing for Kent against Surrey at the Oval, and this time his century came up in 67 minutes. Kent sped to victory by seven wickets, hitting the required 234 runs in 26.2 overs, with Ames finishing on 136 not out. Alf Gover had figures of 1 for 67 in 6 overs, an analysis even a T20 bowler would try to avoid mentioning.\n\nThe next Kent player to win the Lawrence Trophy was Asif Iqbal, 34 years after Ames, in 1973. For Kent against MCC at Canterbury on 25th May that year, he scored 103 not out as Kent won an exciting game by 8 runs. In conditions that the Kent yearbook described as perfect, Asif and John Shepherd added 125 together in short time, Asif completing his hundred in 72 minutes. Perhaps the slightly slower over rates compared with pre-war cricket meant that his time was slower than Woolley or Ames, but anybody who saw Asif in his prime knows it must have been a joy to watch.\n\nThree years later, the winner was Alan Knott. In a close fought drawn game against Sussex at Canterbury from 8 September 1976, Knott hit 144, including 20 fours and 2 sixes, out of Kent’s first innings total of 432 for 6. The Kent yearbook says he “batted superbly” and reached his hundred in 70 minutes, ending with 144 in 99 minutes. Asif Iqbal, who was also playing, showed that he had not lost his fast-scoring skills by hitting 40 in 27 minutes in Kent’s second innings.\n\nWe had to wait until 1998 for another winner, the astonishing Carl Hooper. By this time, the speed of centuries was measured in balls faced rather than time taken, but it was still concerned with first-class cricket only. Hooper, who in his first appearance at Canterbury in 1992 had hit the ball clean over the lime tree for 6, played brilliantly to reach his hundred off 72 balls, with 15 fours and three 6s. This equalled the season’s record set earlier by Ali Brown of Surrey, with whom Hooper thus shared the trophy.. Hooper’s second fifty came off only 28 balls and he finished on 154. He had great support from Matthew Fleming, who made 40 and obviously learned a great deal about quick scoring from watching Hooper at the other end.\n\nFour seasons later, it was Fleming’s turn to win the trophy. In a rain affected game in late April 2002, Jazzer hit 102 off 66 balls, and then was out the very next ball. His innings included 12 fours and 3 sixes. He put on a very rapid 176 with Geraint Jones for the 6th wicket, but the main oddity of the game was that the Sri Lankans conceded no fewer than 40 no balls in a total of 419 for 6.\n\nBy 2013, when a Kent player next won the trophy, the qualifying matches included white-ball games as well as first-class matches. No prizes for guessing who was the winner that year – Darren Stevens. Against Sussex in the Yorkshire Bank 40 over competition on 19 June that year, Stevo hit 118 off 53 balls, his hundred coming up in 44 balls. Kent were chasing a then record high score of 337 to win, which they did with 9 balls to spare. We read that Stevens “produced his own brand of fireworks” in an innings that included 12 fours and “7 huge sixes”. As a footnote to this innings, Stevo’s 44 ball century only equalled the Kent record, set by Mark Ealham in 1995, when white ball innings did not qualify for the Lawrence trophy. Ealham himself also won the Walter Lawrence Trophy, but not for that 1995 innings but for an innings in 2006, when he was playing for Nottinghamshire.\n\nThe final (so far) Kent winner of the Lawrence Trophy is Sam Billings. On 31 July 2014, he hit 135 not out, in a total of 383 for 7 off 50 overs at Taunton against Somerset in the Royal London One Day Cup. He reached his hundred in 46 balls, and his 135 was made in 58 balls with 17 fours and 5 sixes. Despite his brilliance, and a run-a-ball century from Sam Northeast, Kent only won by 2 runs. That helped us reach the knockout stages but we missed out on a final by losing to Warwickshire in the semis.\n\nIt may well be that the Walter Lawrence Trophy is not the most prestigious cricket trophy, but ask any of the winners and they will be more than happy to reminisce about their ultra-quick innings.\n\nWhen the redevelopment of the St Lawrence Ground began over a decade ago, the turnstile gates on the Old Dover Road were among the bits that had to be demolished. They were of no great architectural merit, but when they were first built shortly after the Second World War, they were dedicated to the memory of members of Kent elevens who had died in the war.\n\nWhen the new gates were being planned, it was decided to name them for George Kennedy, past chairman and president of the club, and major benefactor during the financially difficult early years of this century. It is quite likely that without George’s generosity, the club would have gone to the wall, and top class cricket in Kent with it.\n\nHowever, the club also wanted to retain the memorial aspect of the gates, so the plaque which was affixed to the turnstile gates is being remembered at the Kennedy Gates, which were formally opened on Sunday 10 September by club President Chris Cowdrey and George Kennedy himself.\n\nIt honours thirteen men, who had differing levels of success as cricketers, but all of whom gave their lives for their country.\n\nHoward Charles Sheffield Armstrong, who died on 31 January 1944 in a plane crash in Co. Donegal, Ireland, played three games for Kent Seconds in 1939 without doing anything remarkable. He was born in Tunbridge Wells in 1919 and was educated at Repton, where he played in the 1st XI.\n\nDesmond Herbert Biggleston, who was killed on 1 July 1942 at El Alamein while serving as a lieutenant in the Royal Artillery, was born in Canterbury in 1914. He was a wicket-keeper who played 9 games for Kent Seconds between 1936, when he was 17 years old, and 1939.\n\nFrederick Gerald Hudson Chalk, who died on 17 February 1943, when his aircraft crashed near Calais, was Kent’s captain in 1938 and 1939, one of two of our county captains to lose their life during World War Two. His death was widely mourned across the county.\n\nDavid Arthur Sydney Day, who died on 22 February 1944, fighting in Arakan, Burma (now Myanmar), was the son of Arthur Day, a Kent stalwart and Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1910. David played just 3 games for Kent Seconds in 1935. In his final appearance, against Norfolk, he was bowled by Bill Edrich for a duck.\n\nJames William Travis Grimshaw died on 26 February 1944 at Nijmegen, during Operation Market Garden. A slow left arm bowler, he played two games for Kent in 1934, taking 3 for 29 in 23 overs on debut, but his main first-class career was with Cambridge University, with whom he won his Blue in 1934 and 1935.\n\nCol. Lancelot Townley Grove RE was a career soldier who died on 9 February 1943 in Gander, Newfoundland, where aircraft being ferried from America to Britain used to refuel before crossing the Atlantic. He played 3 games for Kent Seconds in 1937 and 1938, and a handful of first-class games for the Army and Combined Services. His top score was 106 against Cambridge University in 1938.\n\nMajor Cyril Penn Hamilton RA died on 10 February 1941 in Eritrea. He was born in Adelaide, and played 2 games for Kent in 1935. He scored 1 run in each game.\n\nBernard Howlett, known as “Swifty”, died on 29 November 1943 in Abruzzo, Italy. A career soldier – a brigadier with a DSO and bar when he died – he was a right-arm fast bowler who played 42 games for Kent between 1922 and 1928, taking a total of 39 wickets. He took Born in 1898 he survived the First World War, fighting in France and Flanders in 1918, but aged 44 was killed in Italy.\n\nWilliam Murphy Leggatt, who was born in the lovely Scottish fishing village of Crail in Fife, died on 13 August 1946 in London. He was another career soldier, who played five games for Kent in 1926 while stationed at Woolwich, hitting two 50s – 51 and 92 against Gloucestershire at Bristol. During the war he won the DSO and retired as a Lieutenant Colonel. He died from a heart attack while lunching in the Cavalry Club in London, rather than in the heat of battle, so it is not known quite why he is included on this particular roll of honour.\n\nGeoffrey Bevington Legge, Kent’s county captain from 1928 to 1930, died on 21 November 1940 in an air crash in Devon, another casualty of a training exercise rather than the real thing. A fine batsman, he played five Tests, four of which were in the winter of 1929-30, when England simultaneously sent teams to West Indies and New Zealand. In the fourth Test at Auckland, he hit 196, the highest score by a Kent batsman for England in Tests, until Rob Key scored 221 in 2004.\n\nEdward Henry Moss, a squadron leader in the RAF, played five first class games for Oxford University in 1933 and 1934, but did not win a Blue. He also played ten games for Kent Second XI, mainly as an opening bat, from 1929, when he was just 18, to 1933. He was shot down and died 31 March 1944, at Rimbach, Germany, and is buried in the Hanover War Cemetery.\n\nPeter Michael William Whitehouse, who was born in Minnis Bay in 1917 but spent much of his childhood in India, died on 19 November 1943 in Archi, Italy, leading a Sikh battalion against heavy German fire. He played eight games for Kent in 1937 and 1938 as a bits and pieces all-rounder, but without any remarkable success. He also played for Oxford University from 1936 to 1938, winning his Blue in his final year.\n\nJohn Roger Bodley Wright, was killed in action on 13 November 1943 in Naples, Italy, just six days before Peter Whitehouse died. Wright’s career is the most obscure of all those on the memorial. He played just one match for Kent Second XI, against Sussex Second XI, in 1939. No scorecard of the game exists. Wright was born in 1919 in Bromley and was educated at Bradfield College, where he was in the 1st XI as a batter. Beyond that, little is known of his cricketing career.\n\nIt is hard to say what any of these brave men might have achieved on the cricket field if they had survived the war, but we can always be reminded, as we walk through the Kennedy Gates, that there might now be no cricket, or indeed no Canterbury, if it has not been for the sacrifices of men like those on the memorial, and thousands like them.\n\nIn 1922, British Pathé News filmed a young woman called Muriel Maxted batting and bowling in Ashford. (You can find this 55 second clip at https://www.britishpathe.com/asset/49379/). They called her “Doctor Grace In Petticoats”. Yet despite her cricketing fame at the time being enough to attract a national film team to capture her skills for all time, Muriel Maxted’s name is almost completely unknown today. Who was she, and what happened to her?\n\nWhat the brief clip shows is an 18 year old woman batting and bowling at the now defunct Beaver Cricket Club in Ashford. Muriel’s batting style seems to emulate the famous photograph of Victor Trumper jumping out to drive, while her bowling, off a four pace run, looks more like a First World War infantryman tossing a hand grenade out of his trench in the hope of upsetting a few Germans. Yet her statistics and newspaper coverage at the time are astonishing.\n\nWhat we know of Muriel Victoria Hannah Maxted is that she was born in Tonbridge on 24th March, 1904. Her father, Edgar Ernest Maxted, was a piano tuner and a keen cricketer, while her mother Hannah (née Pearse), had her hands full with Muriel and her four brothers. Her father took the whole family to Sydney at the end of 1906, where presumably the prospects for a piano tuner were better than at home, but they came back a dozen years later as the war ended, she with a thick Australian accent and a great passion for cricket.\n\nThe 1922 Pathé News clip obviously raised Muriel’s profile considerably, as there are many newspaper clippings of her feats over the next few years. In 1923, the West Australian newspaper reported that “Miss Muriel Maxted, Ashford’s girl cricketer, is to make an effort to get into first-class county cricket as a professional…. She has been practising bowling at a secret training quarters, about four miles from the town under the supervision of a South African cricketer who prefers to remain anonymous…. Her trainer declares that he will back her to take the wicket of any batsman in the country in three overs. She practices for two hours every day.” This is real Roy Of The Rovers stuff. No woman has ever played professional cricket with men, and yet a century ago she thought nothing of setting it as her goal. “She is not yet 18 years of age,” the report continues, “but regularly plays with the Beaver Cricket Club, a men’s team, on the same terms as the other players, and thinks nothing of “‘swiping” her male opponents to the boundary. Last season she took 120 wickets at an average cost of two runs each.”\n\nThe training sessions were apparently taking place in an old army canteen hut which had been fitted with coconut matting. Her bowling seems to have been the stronger part of her game, with stories of her taking 9 for 10, among other feats. “When she is in form”, her proud Dad is quoted as saying, “she can knock down which of the three stumps she likes four times out of six.” Truly a remarkable cricketer if the newspapers can be believed.\n\nIn 1922, as a sign of her fame she was also featured in a newspaper advertisement for Ovaltine, who described her as “Miss Muriel Maxted, the wonderful girl cricketer”. She was quoted as saying that “Quite recently our doctor remarked that it is most surprising that I can stand the stress and strain of a game that makes even strong men tired, and the only explanation of this seems to be the continued use of Ovaltine as my daily beverage.” In 1923 she reportedly took 115 wickets for 179 runs, at the unbelievable average of 1.55, and between 1921 and 1926 she took 561 wickets at 5 runs apiece. Other reports put the figure at 666 wickets.\n\nShe was certainly very well known. In 1924, the Willard Chocolate company in Canada produced a series of cards, on the lines of cigarette cards, for their chocolates, which featured 56 famous sportspeople of the world. Many of the names are still well known today – Babe Ruth, Helen Wills Moody, Gene Sarazen, Bill Tilden, Suzanne Lenglen and Johnny Weissmuller for example, but the only cricketer of either sex included in the set was number 44, Muriel Maxted.In that same year, 20 year old Muriel married Eric William King-Turner, a Folkestone based trainee dentist. One of the conditions of the marriage, according to press reports, was that Muriel should be allowed to continue playing cricket under her maiden name. So we assume she did, for a while at least.\n\nBy the end of the 1920s, we find a photograph of her with the caption “Folkestone’s Famous Woman Cricketer: Mrs. Muriel King-Turner”, showing her padding up for a net. She is wearing men’s cricket flannels, and blazer and cap, and the Daily Mirror in May 1930 prints another photo of her in flannels, “a pioneer woman cricketer… who has four centuries to her name”. The Sunday Dispatch in March 1931 prints a long article about the proper dress for women cricketers, in which it quotes Muriel as saying, “I prefer to play in flannels because they are more comfortable and give more protection than a skirt.” Her opinion obviously counted, because “as Miss Muriel Maxted, she won fame as a right hand slow bowler.”\n\nShe then refers to the newly formed Women’s Cricket Association, adding that the association did not “consider it possible for women to adopt flannels as a regular uniform”. Regardless of the virtues of flannels, skirts or tunics for women cricketers, her mention of the Women’s Cricket Association is interesting. The Association was formed in 1926, after several successful women’s cricket days at Colwall, Herefordshire, which, oddly, never featured Muriel Maxted. Pretty well all of the great women cricketers of the day played every year – players like Betty Snowball and Carol Valentine – but not their spokesperson on cricket gear, “Dr Grace in Petticoats”. She never played there, in flannels, a skirt or petticoats.\n\nYet the very first match in which a WCA team turned out under the association banner took place at Folkestone on 30 May 1929, between the WCA and Mrs. King-Turner’s XI. In other words, Muriel was sufficiently talented and well-known to be the perfect person to raise a side to play against the newly formed national body of women’s cricket. Obviously an important person in her field, but perhaps not willing to become part of the cricketing establishment. Despite Muriel opening the batting for her XI and scoring 50, the highest individual score of the game, the WCA won that first match by 6 wickets. There is no full record of the bowling analyses, so it is not known if she bowled, but she did not take a wicket. A few weeks later, on 17 July, another WCA-approved game took place at Beckenham, between London and District Women v The Rest. This time Muriel batted at number 7 for London and District, making 19 as her side just held on for a draw. She bowled, but did not take a wicket. Kent’s Carol Valentine was the star of the London and District team, taking 6 for 62 including the hat-trick. These two games seem to be the only record we have of Muriel’s actual achievements. She does not appear anywhere else in the WCA records, nor on Cricket Archive, and in all the books we have checked on women’s cricket, there is no mention of Muriel, either as Miss Maxted or as Mrs King-Turner. She gets no mention in any Wisden, and I have scoured The Cricketer magazine through the 1920s and 1930s without finding any mention of her.\n\nYou might think that she slipped into retirement, raised a brood of children and forgot about cricket, but you would be wrong. She and her husband did not have children, and the next we hear of her in the national press is in the Daily Mirror in April 1937. Under the headline, “She Might Give The Aussies More Ashes’, the paper suggested that if the “star Englishwoman cricketer Muriel Maxted “were to accept the Australian women’s cricket team’s invitation to play for them, “odds are ten to one on Australia winning the second Ashes of the season” (after the men had failed to regain them on the 1936/37 tour). The paper suggested that Muriel is eligible to play for the tourists as she spent twelve years of her early life in Australia. The report says that she was widely recognised as the world’s finest woman cricketer, and her inclusion in the Australian side would surely mean victory for the tourists. By this time, Muriel, aged 33, and her husband were living in London, and she was quick to play down the idea. “I don’t think I would like to play against my friends and the old country. Of course, I am half Australian, I suppose, but I’ve played for my county – Kent – so often that I feel I belong here”. In the event, Muriel did not play for either side, and the three match series was drawn 1-1.\n\nSo why is there no trace of her in the official women’s cricket records of the time? The answer is that I have no idea. The war came along when Muriel and her husband were living in St Charles Square, Kensington, where we assume her husband’s dental surgery was now based. In the 1939 census, he is described as a dental surgeon, and she as a dental mechanic. On 14th October, 1941, Muriel is recorded as receiving an emergency commission in the Women’s Auxiliary Territorial Service.\n\nSomething happened to Eric King-Turner during the war (was he killed? Did they divorce?) and in January 1947, Muriel married for a second time, this time at Winchester to a certain Alexander Engledow, about whom we know little more than his name. Presumably by this time, the 43 year old Muriel had given up playing cricket at a high level. She never seems to have been involved in any cricket administration after retiring as a player, and she has faded completely into the background. She died in Crediton in Devon on October 25th, 1980, aged 76.\n\nHer fame and her pioneering cricket in the 1920s and 1930s deserves to be remembered, as does her and Kent’s part in the development of women’s cricket in the inter-war years. We need to know more. If anybody has any further information on the once famous but now extremely elusive Muriel Maxted, please get in touch. Maybe there are nephews and nieces from her four brothers who remember her, or somebody who has the records of Ashford Beaver CC or Folkestone CC from that era. Please let us know.\n\nWith thanks to Ian Phipps and Howard Milton for their help in preparing this article,\n\nThis is the story of a remarkable man, captain of Kent for a season, but a national war hero for all seasons. His name was John Evans, and he was born on 1 May 1889 at Highclere in Hampshire, close to Newbury where one year earlier his father had founded Horris Hill preparatory school. Evans senior was a fine sportsman, having played first class cricket for Oxford University, captaining the side in 1881. In 1882 he began his teaching career at Winchester College, and apart from a handful of games for Hampshire and Somerset, retired from first class cricket and devoted himself to teaching. In 1888 he left Winchester to set up Horris Hill preparatory school, and it was there that his son Alfred John Evans, was born.\n\nJohnny Evans inherited all of his father’s athletic skills and then a bit more. Having done his stint as a prep schoolboy under his father’s rule at Horris Hill, he moved up to Winchester College, where he was in the cricket XI for three years. The next step was Oxford, where he won Blues from 1909 to 1912, and, emulating his father, was captain in 1910. He also represented the university at rackets and golf, and first played county cricket, for Hampshire, in 1908.\n\nOn graduating from Oxford, Evans followed in his Dad’s footsteps once again, and joined the teaching staff at Eton College. He then spent a year in Germany, paid for by Eton, becoming fluent in German. However, he gave up teaching after another year or so, on discovering that he “hated small boys” (a good enough reason in my book), and at last he did something his father had not done. In 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated, the Hapsburg empire began to crumble and the Great War broke out. Johnny Evans, gentleman and fluent German speaker, had already been noticed by the War Office as a suitable candidate to join the newly formed Intelligence Corps, and in August 1914, he was sent to France as part of the corps.\n\nHis role was as an observer for the Royal Flying Corps, a job that involved leaning out of flimsy aircraft flying at about 250 metres above the ground over enemy lines, taking photographs under fire – not a recipe for a long life. On 16 July 1916, his aeroplane was forced to make a landing behind enemy lines, and he was captured, and imprisoned at Clausthal, south of Hanover in Lower Saxony. He soon escaped and almost made it to the Dutch border, around 300 miles away, but was recaptured and sent to Ingolstadt, on the Danube, where the POWs were housed in old forts. He made several escapes, but was recaptured each time, until the day when a number of English prisoners, including Evans, were transferred to another camp. This time, he had more luck. He and another prisoner jumped from the moving train and began walking to the Swiss border, a long way away. The trek took them 18 days, but eventually on 9 June 1917 they reached the safety of Switzerland. The indefatigable Evans quickly got himself back into the war, but because escaped POWs were not allowed to return to the same theatre of war, he was posted to the Middle East, firstly to Egypt at the end of 1917, and then to Palestine early the next year, where he was put in command of a bomber squadron. In March that year, he was captured again when a blocked fuel pipe forced him to land in enemy territory. In no time they were captured by Arabs, and then, as he later described it, “soon afterwards rescued!!! By Turks.”\n\nThe complicated loyalties in that part of the world so late in the war meant that Evans and his fellow prisoners never felt secure, whoever was guarding them, and of course Evans tried to escape many more times. His final effort came when he heard that sick officers were to be taken by train to Smyrna to be exchanged for sick prisoners from the other side, and he bribed a doctor to get him onto the train. Once in Smyrna, he thought about surrendering once again to the Turks, so that he could then work out how to escape ‘legitimately’, to use his word, but as he could see the war was so near to an end, he took the less foolhardy route and boarded the ship. He arrived in Alexandria, and safety, in November 1918.\n\nFor all his escaping efforts, he was awarded a bar to the Military Cross he had won earlier in the war. Once back in England, he wrote about his experiences as a prisoner of war in his book, The Escaping Club, which became a best-seller. As if writing a book was not time consuming enough, he got married in October 1919, and in 1920 he made his last appearance for Hampshire, against Kent, at Canterbury. Hampshire were well beaten, but Evans scored more runs in the match than any of his Hampshire team-mates. Early in 1921, when English cricket was definitely in the doldrums, he had been picked to play for MCC against the visiting Australians, and his 69 not out certainly impressed the England selectors. Having now qualified by residence for Kent, a week later he made his debut for the county, and promptly scored 102 against Northamptonshire. This was enough for the England selectors, who were smarting from defeat in the First Test by ten wickets They picked Evans, along with three other debutants, for the Second Test at Lord’s. Things went slightly better for England, in that they only lost by eight wickets, but Johnny Evans scored only 4 and 14, the rumour being that he was unnerved by the occasion and the speed of Ted McDonald, the great Australian opening bowler. For a man who had shown such bravery and nerve in wartime, that seems an unlikely excuse. More likely, he wasn’t quite good enough. He, along with two of the other three England debutants in that game, Alfred Dipper of Gloucestershire and Jack Durston of Middlesex, never played for their country again.\n\nAfter that summer, Evans put his business life ahead of his cricket, and played only sporadically for Kent. Then in 1927, much to the surprise of many, the 38 year old Evans was offered the county captaincy, and he accepted. For the first half of the season, he played very well, hitting three centuries and several fifties, including 143 (his highest score) against a Lancashire attack which included the fearsome Ted McDonald. His batting fell away during the latter part of the season, no doubt affected by the strains of a full season of cricket after years of sitting behind a desk, and by the end of the summer, in which he hit 832 runs at an average of 25, he announced he was stepping down from the captaincy. Kent had done fairly well under his leadership, finishing 4th, just one place below their 1927 finish, but he was happy to hand on the position to Geoffrey Legge. In 1928, he played eight championship matches for Kent, but finished his first-class career at Eastbourne, playing for Harlequins CC against the touring West Indians, at the end of August that year. Harlequins made 676 for 8 declared, with Evans making 124 out of a 7th wicket partnership of 255 with another Kent man, C.H. ‘John’ Knott who made 261 not out. The Harlequins won by an innings, a good way for John Evans to leave the game.\n\nHe did not leave the escaping game, though. When the Second World War came along, he was 50 years old, but was seconded to MI9 to help plan escape routes from occupied Europe for POWs and others stranded behind enemy lines. He went with the invading armies into Europe in July 1944, shortly after the D-Day landings, and helped to find more POWs and facilitate their release and journey home.\n\nHe died in September 1960, aged 71, having led a rather more interesting life than most who have captained, or even played for, Kent CCC.\n\nWe need your help. Any information leading to a successful outcome will be appreciated.\n\nRecently, while we were sorting through some of the artworks that are stored in the Frank Woolley Stand, we came across a print by a local artist, Terence Macklin, which nobody seemed to know anything about.\n\nIt is clearly an updated version of the famous ‘Kent v Lancashire 1906’ painting, which the club owned until 2006, and a copy of which now hangs in the Chiesman Pavilion. In our records it is listed thus:\n\nKENT v LANCASHIRE, CANTERBURY 1990’s. A modern interpretation of the famous Chevallier Tayler painting of 1906, by Terence Macklin, featuring current Kent CCC players in a similar setting. Signed in pencil by players featured : M.J. McCague, R.M. Ellison, G.R. Cowdrey, M.V. Fleming, A.P. Igglesden, M.A. Ealham, M.R. Benson, S.A. Marsh, C.L. Hooper, N.R. Taylor, T.R. Ward and C. Penn; also signed by the artist. Limited Edition No. 76 of 500. Mounted, framed and glazed. 83cms. x 65cms.\n\nThere is Carl Hooper bowling, Steve Marsh’s backside behind the stumps, and all the others clearly recognisable. So where did this come from? We asked around. David Robertson, our Curator for the best part of a quarter of a century, did not know anything about it. Our two Kent cricket history gurus, Howard Milton and Derek Carlaw, could not help, and I had never come across it before, despite having written the book about the original painting and done what I thought at the time was some very thorough research on every aspect of the original. Clearly I hadn’t done enough.\n\nTerence Macklin is a local artist, who loves his sport and who has painted several scenes at Canterbury, including this excellent one, entitled ‘Canterbury Week 1990’. He had for some years a gallery in Whitstable, and is, we think, still thriving, but we have not yet managed to make contact with him.\n\nOur initial research led us to think the painting was commissioned for a player’s benefit year, and by a process of elimination, and by contacting Carol Buck, the player in question’s sister-in-law, we discovered that it was indeed created for Steve Marsh’s Benefit in 1995. There were 500 prints made of the painting, of which the one in the club’s collection is number 76, so what happened to the other 499? And why is there no mention of the painting or its fund-raising potential, in Steve’s Benefit brochure? Did it actually raise any money for our wicket-keeper captain? And what happened to the original?\n\nMy first thought was to ask some of the players who feature in the painting if they had any memories of the painting – whether they had to sit for Mr. Macklin, or whether they were given a print as a thank-you. Both Richard Ellison and Neil Taylor, with whom I spoke at the recent highly enjoyable Legends’ Dinner, seemed vaguely to remember it, but neither of them have a print, and never did. So that was a bit of a dead end, too. How could 499 prints of a painting go walkabout?\n\nAnd then by pure chance, while googling for more information about the artist, I came across a photo of the painting, with the news that it had been auctioned by Parker Fine Art Auctions of Farnham in Surrey, in March this year. I immediately emailed the auction house, who told me that the original painting was what they sold, not a print, and that it went for £280. If only we had known, the Heritage Trust would certainly have made a bid for it. However, the auction house then put me in touch with the vendor, who confirmed that the painting had been owned by her late father, David Clark, who owned a company called Infocheck, which was a sponsor of Kent CCC in the 1990s, and incidentally took out a half page advertisement in Steve’s Benefit Brochure. His daughter also said that Terence Macklin had been commissioned and paid by her father to paint the picture, so that is why he owned it. What’s more, he made sure that there was banner advertising his company on the front of the Pavilion Annexe (now the Underwood and Knott Stand) in the painting. Incidentally, this David Clark is no relation to the late Kent captain, club President and President of MCC of the same name.\n\nI have not yet found out who produced the 500 prints, nor where the other 499 might be hiding. If anybody knows anything at all about this painting or the elusive prints, please get in touch. We’d love to be able to give the story a happy ending, or an ending of any kind. And I wouldn’t mind having one of the prints for my own collection!"
