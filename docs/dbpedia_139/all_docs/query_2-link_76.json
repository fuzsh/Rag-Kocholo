According to an eminent archaeologist (Schmandt-Besserat, 1999): \"Whereas words consist of immaterial sounds, the tokens were concrete, solid, tangible artifacts, which could be handled, arranged and rearranged at will. For instance, the tokens could be ordered in special columns according to types of merchandise, entries and expenditures; donors or recipients. The token system thus encouraged manipulating data by abstracting all possible variables. (Harth 1983. 19) [...] No doubt patterning, the presentation of data in a particular configuration, was developed to highlight special items (Luria 1976. 20). \" Clay tokens suggest that physical objects were used to externalize information, support visual thinking and enhance cognition way before paper and writing were invented.

This basic system has been improved upon many times across different continents, yieldingÂ more precise measurements and eliminatingÂ the need for manually resetting the mechanism.

Adult male citizens were invited to express their opinion by dropping a pebble in an urn: a white pebble meant \"yes\"Â andÂ a black pebble meantÂ \"no\". Sometimes two urns were used. The left image is a detail of a Greek wine cup from the 5th century BC, and is one of the earliest known depictions of the act of voting. The middle image is a modern reconstruction from a TV documentary. Secret voting was also in use, but it is unclear how (perhaps usingÂ \"a contraption to obscure the urn into which a voter was placing his hand\").Â By the mid-4th century BC, a more elaborate method of secret voting was introduced based on bronze ballots whose difference could only be felt by touch. In the 19th century, freemasons and fraternities started to useÂ ballot boxes to decide who should be included in the groupÂ or who should be expelled (see right image). The boxes had a small openingÂ where each member would covertly insertÂ a white marble to mean \"yes\",Â or a black marble (or black cube) to mean \"no\".

The oldest known seismoscope is Chinese andÂ dates backs from 132. It was a large bronze device that dropped a ball into a bronze container (one of the eight frogs on the image above)Â every time an earthquake was detected, thus producing a loud sound. The direction of the earthquake could then be examined by looking at the container in which the ball was dropped. In AD 132,Â Zhang HengÂ of China'sÂ Han dynastyÂ invented the first seismoscope (by the definition above), which was calledÂ Houfeng Didong YiÂ (translated as, \"instrument for measuring the seasonal winds and the movements of the Earth\"). The description we have, from theÂ History of the Later Han Dynasty, says that it was a large bronze vessel, about 2 meters in diameter; at eight points around the top were dragon's heads holding bronze balls. When there was an earthquake, one of the mouths would open and drop its ball into a bronze toad at the base, making a sound and supposedly showing the direction of the earthquake. On at least one occasion, probably at the time of a large earthquake inÂ GansuÂ in AD 143, the seismoscope indicated an earthquake even though one was not felt. The available text says that inside the vessel was a central column that could move along eight tracks; this is thought to refer to a pendulum, though it is not known exactly how this was linked to a mechanism that would open only one dragon's mouth. The first ever earthquake recorded by this seismograph was supposedlyÂ somewhere in the east.Â Days later, a rider from the east reported this earthquake.

Today aÂ floaterÂ isÂ typically aÂ glass sphereÂ containing a colored liquidÂ and to which is attached a metallic temperature tag. The composition of a floater is irrelevant, its overall density just needs to be calibrated to a certain value and remain stable. Floaters being made of glass and metal, their volume - and therefore density - is largely unaffected by temperature. But when temperature rises, the ethanol around expands significantly.Â When itsÂ density matches the density of aÂ particular floater, that floater will move at the middle of the tube, thereby indicating the current temperature. The remaining floaters will move at the bottom or at the top. Despite its name, the GalileoÂ thermometer was not invented by Italian physicistÂ Galileo (1564â1642), but by the Florentine scientific societyÂ Accademia del CimentoÂ two decades after his deathÂ (left image). The Accademia del Cimento was founded inÂ 1657 by Grand DukeÂ Ferdinando II de' Medici (former student of Galileo) and his brother Prince Leopoldo, in order toÂ attract scientists to Florence for mutual study. It wasÂ the first scientificÂ organizationÂ founded for the sole purpose of making scientific experiments. ItsÂ motto wasÂ Probando e Reprobando, i.e., \"testing and retesting\". They created a number of scientific instruments before being demised in 1667. Galileo thermometers are now built and sold all over the worldÂ for decoration purposesÂ (right image). Galileo did invent a thermoscope (a thermometer without a numeric scale) in the earlyÂ 1600s, but it was very rudimentary, did not employ floaters,Â and was affected by atmospheric pressure. This instrumentÂ was an importantÂ invention butÂ bore no resemblance to what is now called the Galileo thermometer. Nonetheless, it is clear thatÂ Galileo'sÂ inventionsÂ and writings greatly influenced the Academia del Cimento. Sources: Peter Loyson (2012)Â Galilean Thermometer Not So Galilean.

The model is made of bars, clamped together so as to allow free motion. In order to make the combination look like an atom, a thin round disc of blackened brass can be placed under the central nut. At the ends of the arms are holes to connect one carbon atom with another by means of a nut. The structure atÂ the bottom right of his figure is now calledÂ \"Dewar benzene\". I bring before the Society a simple mechanical arrangement adapted to illustrate structure in the non-saturated hydrocarbons. This little device is the mechanical representative of Dr. C. Brown's well-known graphic notation. A series of narrow thin bars of brass of equal length are taken, and every two of the bars clamped in the centre by a nut, so as to admit of free motion the one on the other. Such a combination represents a single carbon atom with its four places of attachment. In orderÂ to make the combination look like an atom, a thin round disc of blackened brass can be placed under the central nut. At the ends of the arms are holes to connect one carbon atom with another by means of a nut. The filling up of the places of attachment may be effected by slipping on the arms round discs of brass having a groove attached, and placing the symbol of the chemical element on the round projection. A carbon atom would then look like the following diagram. By J. Dewar, Esq.Â (fromÂ Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh,Â VI,Â Session 1866-67, pp. 82-86) Dewar sent KekulÃ© his brass strip molecular modeling kit in 1866, and KekulÃ© used it to hypothesize possible molecular structures for compunds. In 1867, KekulÃ© used Dewar's models to come up with a reasonable (by today's standards) structure for mesitylene (1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, C9H12). Note that in the drawing, little dots appear in in the middle of some of the bonds. They appear because the drawings are of a real model, and the various atoms were screwed together at the dots. Also note that the acetone molecules in the model appear not to be symmetrical, with one C-C bond bent and the other one straight. However, the bent bond is only an illusion created by the flatness of the paper; in KekuleÃ©'s 3-D model, all of the C-C bonds are straight. James Deward is famous for his Researches in low temperature phenomena. See [3] to learn more. Sources: J. Michael Mc Bride Models and Structural Diagrams in the 1860s J.

Kupes were typically usedÂ by men to keep track of their accomplishments, such as turtles caught in deep water, fishes speared,Â or adventures withÂ women (as the one above). These physical visualizations were used as social displays, and big kupes were greatly prized. According to Haddon (1912): These tallies are left entirely to a man's honour; a man may have doubts about the correctness of another's tally, but he would never dare single-handed to express an opinion doubting it. Sometimes a crowd may chaff a man whom they suspect of chearing and get him to confess that he was only 'gammoning'\". Kupes have elements of self-logging, as well asÂ using physical visualizations for social purposes (see our entriesÂ on SweatAtoms and Meshu.io). They were first reported by British biologist and anthropologistÂ Alfred Cort Haddon after a 1898Â expedition, but they are likely much older.

A label said \"Model Prepared by Dept. of Statistics, University College London\". I then wrote to Professor Richard Chandler, current chair of the statistics department, to ask if he had more information about this model. He replied soon after: Thank you for your message below. This is interesting â¦ I have never seen this particular model before, but the labelling looks very similar to some exhibits that were prepared for an event at the Royal Statistical Society in (I think) the 1980s. I arrived at UCL in 1994: at that time there were some people in the department who had been involved in that event. Unfortunately they are no longer with us, so I canât provide any further information. I can, however, speculate that the model youâre showing is a cardboard copy of a much older one that was prepared at the end of the 19th century, probably under the supervision of Karl Pearson. We still have this.Â I found this particular model in my desk drawer when I first arrived at UCL: it was broken into a very large number of pieces, but I had it restored. It is quite a nice piece of 19th-century data visualisation, I think! Upon closer examination, the newer model does not show the same dataset as the older model. The following R code replicates the older model exactly, confirming that it shows the original dataset from Pearson and Lee: library(dplyr) d = HistData::PearsonLee %&gt;% filter(par == \"Father\" &amp; chl == \"Son\") %&gt;% reshape2::acast(parent~child, value.var=\"frequency\") plot3D::hist3D(z = d[nrow(d):1,], col=\"white\", border=\"black\", shade=0.2, phi=60, theta=0) Sources: Pearson, K., &amp; Lee, A.

Each major event in their life was represented byÂ a knot, a bead or a shell. This mnemonic device is called anÂ Ititamat, or counting-the-days ball, or simplyÂ time ball.Â The first image shows an ItitamatÂ created before 1920. On the second image, each string is a differentÂ Ititamat. The last image shows a 2003 replica. A young woman would use a time ball to record her courtship, marriage, and other experiences using a system of knots and beads that only she could decipher. As she grew older, a woman might have several time balls with which to share her life story or keep those memories private. When she passed on, they were buried with her.Â The ball of twine grew in size as time passed and as events occurred. The women would sometimes divide the twine into 25-year lengths to make it more manageable. When the women were very old, they could use the knots and beads of their time balls to recall not only what happened in their lives but when the events occurred. They could easily recount when their children were born, when they moved away, and other major experiences.Â Also see our entry onÂ Torres Strait Islanders tallies and on the Polynesian Genealogical Instrument.
