        "text": "First recorded in the Doomsday Book dated 1086, which hold the results of the survey of land and properties ordered after the Norman invasion by King William also known as William the Conqueror.\n\nThe name of Todwick has undergone many spellings and changes, for example:\n\nTatewic, Tatewich, Tatwk, Tathewick, Tadwick, Toddwyke, Totwik, Todewyk\n\nOn this page:\n\nTodwick Shield\n\nOld Buildings in Todwick\n\nTodwick Road Names\n\nTrysting Tree\n\nThe History of the Parishes and Churches...\n\nSchool\n\nTodwick Livery Stables\n\nTodwick Shield Explanation\n\nWhen asked to look into the design of a shield or emblem for the village I looked at what might be a common theme for the village, nothing at first sprang to mind, then I thought of things like the Trysting tree, the church or even the Red Lion Hotel. Then I thought the tree had been missing for some years (the original that is), the church but then everywhere has a church and the Red Lion is not what it used to be. I then thought to myself there is a lot of history within the village, it is mentioned in the Doomsday Book it has had quite a number of historic landowners so I decided to research their heraldry to see if a unique emblem could be made from theirs.\n\nBelow you can see the finished product, the top left hand quadrant depicts the red stripe and Marlet (a type of heraldic Bird) from the De Furnival family who held the manoral rights to the village in the mid 1200s. The top right quadrant has been made using the yellow cross with blue quadrants of the Osborne family and the black ermines of the Osborne and De Mortain family, Sir Edward Wasteneys, sold Todwick to Thomas Osborne, the first Duke of Leeds, in 1677 and the Count of Mortain, half brother of William the Conqueror was given the village in 1086. The lower left quadrant has been made of the De Wasteneys family, the Rampant Lion of the Wasteneys family was predominantly a burnt orange colour but I have coloured it red to include the Red Lion Hotel. By 1303 Sir Edmund Wasteneys was holding Todwick from Thomas Furnival. The Wasteneys family continued to live in the village into the 20th century. The lower right quadrant I placed the shield of St Peter & St Paul to honour the village church. In 1379 the village society was headed by William de Saint Paul who took his name from that of the church.\n\nThe Coat of Arms has been produced by:\n\nRichard Rattenbury\n\nTodwick Historical Society\n\nJuly 2009\n\nOld Buildings in Todwick\n\nA number of old buildings still exist in Todwick.\n\nTodwick Manor Moated Site\n\nThe National Grid Reference is SK 498843\n\nThe site appears to have formed an irregular quadrilateral in plan, the north side c.40m, the East side c.80m, the South side c.80m and the West side c.80m. The East side and the East sections of the North and South sides are complete and retain water. The original entrance may have been across the centre of the south arm (a water-filled section west of the apparent causeway is shown on the 1930 O.S. 25\":1 mile) has now been infilled and exists only as a slight depression. What appears to be a recent infilling has obscured the NW angle of the site, but a slight depression south of this appears to mark the west arm, although the line of this, and in particular the SW angle, are obscured by modern development.\n\nThe present Manor House is an entirely modern building. The old manor house, which stood NE of the present house (i.e. more or less in the centre of the island, as a rectangular block running east-west) is shown as an \"antiquity\" on older O.S. maps. It was demolished in 1951, and a level lawn now occupies the site.\n\nThere seems to be some confusion as to whether this was the site of the original \"Todwick Hall\", mentioned in 1664 or not. The \"Old Hall\" at SK496848 is a 17th century building. The proximity of the Manor House site to the church suggests that this may be the earlier of the two sites. No other documentary references traced.\n\nReferences\n\nLe Patourel, The Moated Sites of Yorkshire. 1973, p 128\n\nO.S. maps\n\nThe above taken from the County and Ancient Monuments and Sites record Primary Number 266.\n\nTodwick Hand Pump\n\nThere used to be a hand-pump located immediately to the north of No.44 Kiveton Lane. O.S. SK48SE. This was mid 19th century manufacture in cast iron. It had a cylindrical shaft with bolted flange at the base and 3 anulets, fluted barrel with decorative spout and craned handle on the left, fluted cap with finial. The name plaque on the barrel inscribed:\n\nAppleby & Co/Renishaw Ironworks, Nr Chesterfield.\n\nIt was a good example of a locally-produced pump apparently in its original location.\n\nSadly this pump disappeared.\n\nTodwick Milepost\n\nThe milepost, late 19th century is a round headed sandstone pillar with a cast-iron rectangular plaque with raised lettering which reads:\n\nSheffield/10/Worksop/-\n\nthe lower part of the plaque is buried beneath the pavement. Other mileposts on this route are now without their plaques.\n\nThe milepost is located approximately 35 metres to the east of the entrance to Todwick Grange. O.S.

As further details are located these will be added to the web site.\n\nDe Houton Close\n\nNamed after the very first known Rector of Todwick Sir John de Houton. Records show that he was installed as Rector 1232.\n\nFurnival Road and Furnival Close\n\nAt one time the manorial rights of Todwick were jointly owned by the Furnivals and the de Lovetots.\n\nHorbiry End\n\nNamed after the de Horbire or de Horbiry family of Totewick as it was once known. In 1282 Ralph de Horbiry had acquired the Todwick property from the previous Lords of the Manor, the Tortmayns. His son Sir John Horbiry also held half of the villages and land of Treeton, Brampton and Ulley and a carucate of land in Wales. (Quoted in IN KIRKBY'S INQUEST, ED. I., 1284-5 (Surtees Society, Vol. 49) see more details in the extract, also on this web site from The History of the Parishes and Churches in the Deanery of Handsworth in the Diocese and Archdeaconry of Sheffield the Rev. Alfred Thomas, B. D., Rector of Todwick, published by Sir W. C. Leng & Co. (Sheffield Telegraph) Ltd 1932)\n\nManor Way and Manor Close\n\nThe old Manor House which was pulled down in 1945 was unusual in that it was moated. As it was scheduled by the then Ministry of Works as an ancient earth-work, it is apparent that the moat is not a 17th century embellishment of a gentleman's house, but the first line of defence for a fortified residence of a much earlier period. It was known to Sir Walter Scott who must have visited it when he stayed at Conisborough and it is the 'Torquilstone Castle' of his novel 'Ivanhoe'. The present house was built for Mr. A. C. Staniforth's father by the Duke of Leeds in about 1885, as by that time the old house has become uninhabitable.\n\nMortains\n\nAs Domesday is the first extant record in which Todwick is mentioned, the first Lord of the Manor is one of the three great Norman landowners in the district, the Count of Mortain, half brother of William the Conqueror. Todwick was one of many manors he owned in the extensive tract of land along the southern boundary of Yorkshire between Hallamshire and Tickhill. In Domesday, the Manor is noted as comprising 'a church and three acres of meadow; woodland pasture, half a league long and four furlongs broad (1.5 miles × 4 furlongs). The whole manor is one league and a half broad (3 miles × 1.5 miles).\n\nOsborne Road and Osborne Drive\n\nNamed after the Osborne family who lived at Kiveton Hall from 1618 to 1817. Sir Thomas Osborne bought the Manor of Todwick from the Wastneys in 1677.\n\nRoche End\n\nThis is named after Roche Abbey which is a few miles from Todwick.\n\nSandwith Road\n\nNamed after the Reverend Henry Sandwith, Rector of Todwick from 1866-1876.\n\nSt. Paul's Close\n\nNicholas de St. Paul was a benefactor of Roche Abbey. Nicholas de St. Paul gave all his meadow lying between his house and the road towards the north in Todwick. He also confirmed the grant of ten acres of land and pasture for sixty sheep given by his father William de St. Paul. (See the history of Todwick in this website for more details).\n\nTortmayns\n\nThe Tortmayns family were earlier Lords of the Manor and the dates of their tenure of office are not exact. The first listed Rector of Todwick, Sir John de Houten, was presented to the Parish in 1232 by William Tortmayns - but they were not here in 1086, as the Domesday Book records the Earl of Mortain as the Lord of the Manor. Nevertheless, William was at least the second Tortmayns, as his father, Ralph, sold Todwick Grange to the Abbot of Roche. The Tortmayns must have got on well with the Monks of Roche for, later, William granted them the right to graze eight score sheep on Todwick pasture.\n\nWasteneys Road\n\nWilliam Wasteneys was Rector from 23 September 1579 until his death in 1591 so Wasteneys name has long been associated with Todwick. For more on the Wasteneys visit: https://web.archive.org/web/20160422154728/http://www.rotherhamweb.co.uk/genealogy/wasteneys.htm\n\nTrysting Tree\n\nThere is a Trysting Tree to the memory of Robin Hood, situated in the small wood just off the left hand side of Kiveton Lane on the south exit of Todwick. The \"venerable oak\" was stated as \"great trysting tree in the Hart-hill Walk\" which was, in earlier times, a private road owned and maintained by the Dukes of Leeds, and now forms that part of Kiveton Lane between the Rectory glebe land and Kiveton. The trysting tree is, therefore, firmly placed at Todwick and at the site marked by the plaque.\n\nA Short History of The Trysting Tree at Kiveton Park by John T Wells establishes that the Trysting Tree is in Kiveton Park which was the estate of the Osbornes (The Duke of Leeds) for generations.\n\nThe original tree was on the edge of a piece of ancient Woodland known locally as \"The Bluebell Wood\". This tree was badly storm damaged at the turn of the century and the remains were cut down and taken to the Duke of Leeds agents house in Lodge Hill and placed in the garden there. It is thought that Sir Walter Scott's novel \"Ivanhoe\" lists places such as Kiveton, Steetley, Bedgrave and other local places as settings for some of the scenes in the book. Kiveton was therefore classed as situated in Sherwood Forest.\n\nTo purchase a copy of this very interesting and informative book contact J T Wells, 228 Wales Road, Kiveton Park, Sheffield S26 5RE.

Alfred Thomas, B. D., Rector of Todwick\n\nPublished by Sir W. C. Leng & Co. (Sheffield Telegraph) Ltd 1932\n\nThe book is available for reference in Sheffield City Libraries, Local History Department, Surrey Street, Sheffield 1, Yorkshire, UK\n\nThe following is taken from the above book.\n\nPREFACE\n\nThis history was undertaken at quest of the Rural Dean and Chapter of the Clergy of Handsworth. It is chiefly a compilation of such matter as seemed most suitable, on which others had bestowed their labour, and much monumental of it had been printed. The monumental works of the Rev. Joseph Hunter, South Yorkshire, 2 vols., and the History of Hallamshire, furnished the outlines of nearly all the parishes.\n\nThe publications of the Yorkshire Archaeological Society were invaluable. They supplied me with translations of the Domesday entries, Yorkshire Lay Subsidies, Yorkshire Inquisitions, Yorkshire Fines, Yorkshire Deeds, Yorkshire Bells, and Church Plate, Royal Composition Papers, Archbishop Herring's Visitation returns, Sir Stephen Glynne's description of Churches and other miscellaneous information.\n\nThe Surtees Society (after the Rev. Scot Surtees, Rector of Spotbrough) helped me with Kirkby's Inquest, Knights Fees, and the Inventory of Church Goods in 1552. The printed copies of the Taxation of Pope Nicholas and the Valor Ecclesiasticus of Henry VIII., both in Mediaeval Latin and often contracted, were worth the effort bestowed upon them. All are to be found the excellent Reference Library of the City of Sheffield, and I gladly acknowledge the ready help of the staff there.\n\nThe chief manuscripts consulted were the Registers of the Archbishops of York, and other documents in the York Diocesan Registry, and Torre's succinct history of the Deanery of Doncaster in the Registry of the Dean and Chapter of York. The Registers and other parochial papers were carefully examined, and extracts were made therefrom. Reference to other words will be found in text. If there are omissions, I hope that my oversight will be pardoned.\n\nChapter X. TODWICK\n\nThe following variations of the name have been found : Tatewic, Tatewich, Tatewick, Tatwyk, Tathewick, Tadwick, Tadwyke, Thodewick, Todwyke, Toddwyke, Tottewyke, Totewyk, Totewikes, Totwickes, Todwycke, Todewyk, Todwyk, Tottewyk.\n\nDERIVATION\n\nWick is found in both Anglo-Saxon and Norse names. The primary meaning was a station, then a settlement. With the Anglo-Saxons it was a settlement on land, with the Northmen a station for ships. The inland wicks are mostly Saxon villages.\n\nTod. If this had been the original form of the first syllable, it might mean a fox, as in todhunter, or it might be akin to toft, a mound or hill -the village on the hill. But the original form is evidently Tate or Tat, found also in Tatecastre (Tadcaster). Bede's Ecclesiastical history Book II. C. IX, contains this illuminating sentence : \"The aforesaid King (Edwin), having taken to wife Ethelberga, otherwise called Tate, daughter to King Ethelbert.\" 'Tatewic may thus be Northumbrian Queen's wick.\n\nIN DOMESDAY.\n\nLand of the Earl of Mortain :\n\n\"In Tatewic, Rainald had 1 manor of 12 carucates for taxation, where there may be 6 ploughs. Richard has now there 1 plough and 11 villeins and 2 sokemen and 5 bordars, with 5 ploughs and a half.\n\nA Church is there and 3 acres of meadow. Woodland pasture half a league long and 4 furlongs broad. The whole Manor is 1 league long and a half broad. In the time of King Edward it was worth 40 shillings, now 15 shillings.\"\n\nRecapitulation : - In Tatewic : the Count of Mortain 12 carucates.\n\nIN KIRKBY'S INQUEST, ED. I., I284-5 (Surtees Society, Vol.49)\n\n\"Tottewyk. John de Horbire holds the same vill of Thomas Furnivall for one (Knight's) fee.\n\nReturn of Assize.

William Tortmayns, son of Ralph, gave all his wood to the monks with the land on which it grew. He also confirmed the grant of Pasture for eight score sheep in the common pasture of Todwick.\n\nRalph de Horbiry disputed the rights of the monks to common pasture and for a time successfully held them himself. Then in 1282 Robert, abbot of Roche, brought a suit against \"John son of Ralph de Horbyry to permit the abbot to have common pasture in Tadwyke, which belongs to his free tenement there, of which Ralph de Horbyry, John's Father, unjustly dis-seized Jordan, formerly Abbot of Roche.\" The Todwick and other possessions of Horbirys were sold to Sir Edmund Wasteneys. By a writ, tested at Clipston, March 5th, 1316, the Abbot of Roche was certified Joint Lord of the Manor of Todwick (see Nomina Villarum above) the advowson of the Church, however, remained in the hands of the Wasteneys for several generations, until 1677, when Todwick and the manorial rights thereof were sold to Sir Thomas Osborne, the first Duke of Leeds.\n\nTwo other families were benefactors of Roche Abbey. Nicholas de St. Paul gave all his meadow lying between his house and the road towards the North in Todwick. He also confirmed the grant of ten acres of land and pasture for sixty sheep given by his father, William de St. Paul, and gave all his land between Botyldwellwong (or Booton's well) and the Grange, the farmstead called the Bourne on the north of the road from Todwick Bar to Anston, and on the other side of the road towards the south he gave one acre and a half with pasture for nine score sheep with common pasture through his land for all the monks' cattle going form Todwick Grange.\n\nGregory de Todwick and Alice his wife, also gave two acres of land in Todwick to the Abbey.\n\nANOTHER CHARTER OF MAUD DE LOVETOT\n\n\"To all sons of the Holy Church present and future. Maud de Lovetot, formerly wife of Gerard de Furnival greeting. Be it known to your community that I, in my widowhood and in full power over my body, have given, and, by this my charter, confirmed to God and the Blessed Mary and the Monks of Roche for the welfare of my soul and of my lord, Gerard de Furnival, and all my ancestors and heirs, all the lands in the territory of Todwick, with their appurtenances, which Ralph Tortmayns and William Tortmayns and William de St. Paul, and Nicholas de St.Paul gave to said monks, to have and to hold, as the Charters which they have from them testify:\n\nRobert, Parson of Misterton, seneschal.

This was conveyed in the names of the Rector and Churchwardens, the Trustees of the School, to the Sheffield Diocesan Trust and Board of Finance. The sum of Â£14.15s.9d., balance of cost of War Memorial window in the church is also held by the same Trust.\n\nTodwick Livery Stables\n\nFrom John Dobson:\n\nThis photo was taken around 1930 and is of my grandfather, John Paxton Dobson, who had a livery stables in Todwick up until 1944.\n\nClick the image to see a larger version\n\nHe and his wife Laura and their two youngest children, my father Anthony, born May 1932, and his sister Patricia, born 1936, then moved to the Isle of Wight.\n\nMy grandmother attended church every week, so I am certain she would have been a churchgoer when she lived in Todwick.\n\nAs other information is located it will be added to this web site."
