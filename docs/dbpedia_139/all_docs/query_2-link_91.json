The problem with this article is it is very clearly just a dictionary definition, and Wikipedia is the wrong wikiproject for that. I also note that your sources include two glossaries of terms (just reinforcing WP:NOTDICT arguments), a for-sale listing of a trap, and a stock photo of a trap. I suppose these were all added to reinforce the fact that such carriages are called traps, but they are not WP:RS (clearly) and they are reinforcing something over which there is no doubt. The article still fails per WP:NOTDICT . SirfurboyüèÑ ( talk ) 19:05, 20 June 2023 (UTC) [ reply ] No. It is more than just a dictionary definition. Consider Coupe or Pickup truck .

Eastmain ( talk ‚Ä¢ contribs ) 05:18, 21 June 2023 (UTC) [ reply ] Keep This seems to be a nomination based purely on a current thin state of a stub article and that is not the point of DICDEF. The word is widely used, at least in \"pony and trap\" as both vehicle and propulsion. Yet what is a \"trap\"? Does it have 2 wheels or 4? How does it differ from other types of cart? What was it used for? We may not be there as yet, but there is certainly scope here for an encyclopedic article more than a DICDEF, just as we've done for other cart and carriage types.

PhotogenicScientist ( talk ) 14:44, 15 December 2023 (UTC) [ reply ] [...] the scope of reporting was global, which WP:EVENTCRIT says helps the case for an article The reporting was exactly during one day , June 30, 2014. No more articles after that. Saying \"it helps the case\" words things in a way as to not consider the other majority of WP:EVENTCRIT which it clearly fails. Namely: 1. Events are probably notable if they have enduring historical significance and meet the general notability guideline, or if they have a significant lasting effect. 2. Events are also very likely to be notable if they have widespread (national or international) impact and were very widely covered in diverse sources, especially if also re-analyzed afterwards (as described below). 3. Events having lesser coverage or more limited scope may or may not be notable; the descriptions below provide guidance to assess the event. 4. Routine kinds of news events (including most crimes, accidents, deaths, celebrity or political news, \"shock\" news, stories lacking lasting value such as \"water cooler stories,\" and viral phenomena) ‚Äì whether or not tragic or widely reported at the time ‚Äì are usually not notable unless something further gives them additional enduring significance.

Beyond those listed in the article, I found sources on this character in USA Today , Deadline , CBS , ET , CBR (also here ), Screenrant , The Wrap , Collider , and Slate .

However, Catherine actually has a lot of WP:SIGCOV per Historyday01's sources. Ideally, the article can be fixed a bit, but AfD requires a WP:BEFORE search. On whether the article reaches WP:GNG , well the plot summary can be trimmed to include character growth and any reliable recaps. Conyo14 ( talk ) 04:47, 22 August 2023 (UTC) [ reply ] Redirect . The reception section in the article is bad. Awards are for the actor, not character, then we have listicles / trivial recognition like \"number 82 on Bravo's 100 Greatest TV Characters\" and some pasing comments about her from some episode reviews. This takes me to the soruces found above (from Historyday01), who did not however provide any analysis nor suggest they did anything but WP:GOOGLEHITS report. USAToday is a WP:INTERVIEW with the actor about the character, which means issues with independence. deadline is a short piece about her coming back to the show. So-so. CBS reads like a press release. Sorry, I don't have time to review more sources, but they are not impressive, and I distincly note they are not scholarly but rather at celebrity media level or worse. It is onus on those voting keep to argue there is reliable SIGCOV, not throw a list of links and imply they may or may not be helpful here. This is bad AFD practice. The character may be notable, but nobody has estabilished this, the article does not do it, sources presented here that I reviewed are bad. For now, my vote is to redirect this to the list of characters. Ping me if someone wants to argue there are good sources here to improve this with and I'll reconsider my vote.

But thank you for keeping me on my toes. Good to stay sharp! Hm, but the fact that you said it might mean that my \"why\" wasn't clear enough for you. I will improve it! Catherine Willows was one of the most popular and long-lasting characters on what was in its day one of the most popular shows in the United States to the point at which the CSI effect changed the way our legal system works, and very large numbers of people will be interested in finding reliable, encyclopedically written, out-of-universe information about her and will come here to find it.

Darkfrog24 ( talk ) 00:29, 29 August 2023 (UTC) [ reply ] @ Darkfrog24 I am very confused about what you said. Even if the series is very popular, if the character is not notable on their own, they do not warrant a page on Wikipedia. See WP:FICTION . Spinixster (chat!) 08:10, 29 August 2023 (UTC) [ reply ] Yes, but Jclemens and Conyo14 already showed that she is notable on her own.

Darkfrog24 ( talk ) 21:38, 29 August 2023 (UTC) [ reply ] They just agreed with what Historyday said, they did not show that she is notable on her own.

Thanks, Seraphimblade Talk to me 01:30, 29 August 2023 (UTC) [ reply ] Keep . The resources linked by Historyday generally point towards constituting significant coverage. Admittedly, to go through the rest of the sources, the amount of independence does go back and forth throughout the list. The source of \"The Wrap\" is mainly an interview with the actor, and the \"ET\" source also includes an interview segment with the character's actress as well, meaning those portions are not completely independent. But even then, the rest of the sources do seem to talk about the character individually, and also create notability for Catherine on her own. The article also supplements this with the actress's thoughts during interviews, which can't be really used as \"independent sources\", but there's enough there in regards to independence throughout the segments focused solely on the character. As for the reception, it does seem appropriate to include accolades the actress won because the actress and character are effectively linked, so I would maintain it. Utopes ( talk / cont ) 03:45, 29 August 2023 (UTC) [ reply ] Keep The sources provided by Historyday01 above pass SIGCOV and she is notable enough to have her own article. The article just needs some fixing. Flutter Dash 344 ( talk ) 03:52, 29 August 2023 (UTC) [ reply ] Comment As the nominator, I'd like to do an evaluation on the sources that Historyday provided myself. USA Today, ET and TheWrap are interviews, and thus do not prove notability. CBS is the actor's biography: notice how the url says \"csi-vegas/cast/216685/\" and CSI is a CBS show. First ScreenRant article talks about the show, CSI: Vegas, rather than the character. Obviously, for a major character, she will be mentioned a lot in articles relating to the show, but that does not prove notability of the individual character ( MOS:TRIVIA , WP:NOTTVTROPES ) Second ScreenRant article talks about how the aforementioned spinoff of CSI has \"wasted\" the character. While it does focus on the character's storylines, I don't see how this proves that the character is notable. (also MOS:TRIVIA , WP:NOTTVTROPES ) CBR is similar to the second ScreenRant article. Deadline and Collider are similar to the second ScreenRant article, but about the character's return to the new series. Slate is an opinion piece about the character, which can be used for the Reception section, but other than that is not enough to prove the character's individual notability. I would like to remind you that just because the show is notable doesn't mean that the major characters are. Just because there are multiple sources about the character's appearances on the show does not mean that the character is inherently notable; this is something I've learned myself. I want future voters to keep this in mind before making a decision. Spinixster (chat!) 10:45, 29 August 2023 (UTC) [ reply ] Excellent summary. I found a few hits on Google Scholar. I added one to the article and listed the others on the talk page. Darkfrog24 ( talk ) 22:54, 29 August 2023 (UTC) [ reply ] Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but the first article I cannot access without paying :(, the third article is a just a mention, the fourth one is also not significant coverage. However, the second article is quite interesting and at least passes a partial if not all the way. It comes from the Texas State Library as a peer-reviewed journal: Journal of Research on Women and Gender . Granted the entire article discusses crimes against women as portrayed by the show vs the crimes against men and then analyzes the issues, but it does use Catherine Willows attack against her as a prime example. Conyo14 ( talk ) 23:23, 29 August 2023 (UTC) [ reply ] Thanks for using what access you have to evaluate the sources that I couldn't reach. I was expecting that they wouldn't all be hits. Darkfrog24 ( talk ) 23:57, 29 August 2023 (UTC) [ reply ] @ Darkfrog24 Since it seems like you would be interested in improving the article, I would recommend checking out MOS:FICTION . In short, it should have more information about the real-life aspects of the character and less WP:CRUFT . The article also lacks references. If you need more examples, check out Wikipedia:WikiProject Fictional characters/Quality content . Spinixster (chat!) 08:54, 30 August 2023 (UTC) [ reply ] It's not clear how you find this article to deviate from MOS:FICTION. Which issue causes you to believe that the article should be deleted? Right now, improvements should focus on keeping its head above water rather than perfecting the swim stroke. Darkfrog24 ( talk ) 15:43, 30 August 2023 (UTC) [ reply ] @ Darkfrog24 Perhaps you should re-read what I said. I was just saying that because you were interested in improving the article, I did not say it was needed, but it would be preferred. I did a WP:BEFORE search and many of the results were much like the sources Historyday has given, so I started an AfD debate to debate on whether or not the article is notable.

Talk! 23:35, 12 July 2023 (UTC) [ reply ] OK, I'm gonna go keep on this one. Appears to meet WP:NBASIC . Policy-based rationale follows. The rules: Per NBASIC People are presumed notable if they have received significant coverage in multiple published secondary sources that are reliable, intellectually independent of each other, and independent of the subject. If the depth of coverage in any given source is not substantial, then multiple independent sources may be combined to demonstrate notability. WP:SIGCOV clarifies that \"significant coverage\" is coverage that addresses the topic directly and in detail, so that no original research is needed to extract the content. As we are ultimately here to decide collectively whether an administrator should use the extraordinary power of deletion to remove this article from the wiki, we must as always be mindful to resolve all doubts against deletion , and to apply the rules flexibly in support of our encyclopedic purpose . The sources: It should be noted at the outset that search results may have been skewed by West African naming practices -- as in the article itself, the subject's name is written \"Abideen Olasupo\" about as often as \"Olasupo Abideen\". I'm seeing three categories of potentially relevant sources: (1) actual profiles, one unusable and one possibly usable; (2) interviews and mentions that are largely irrelevant to NBASIC but tend to show the subject's encyclopedic significance and likely relevance to readers, which may be relevant at the margins; (3) coverage of various political and journalistic initiatives in which Olasupo has played significant roles, containing coverage of the subject that is significant although perhaps not substantial and can be combined under NBASIC. 1. Profiles: the first source is the worst. The \"Foundation for Investigative Journalism\", which might easily be confused with other orgs with similar names, appears to be a project of Fisayo Soyombo with, at best, no clear track record of reliability. That delightfully thorough profile must therefore be cast aside. However, Olasupo has also been the subject of another profile, this one in the The Nation Online . Weighing in at 366 words, it contains substantial biographical information. However, as the \"hook\" for the profile is Olasupo's past work as a reporter for that newspaper, some might prefer to disregard this source as insufficiently independent. (I do not believe that is warranted, but let's move on.) 2. Neither substantial nor significant, but still illuminating: cited by CNN as a public policy analyst , interviewed by the (UK) Guardian on world youth poll , profiled by Tony Elumelu Foundation for COVID19 fact-checking initiative in 2020 , interviewed on his election fact-checking work in 2023 . 3. Significant though not substantial: Numerous independent reliable sources discuss Olasupo in the context of his FactCheck Elections initiative: [1] , [2] , [3] . Earlier, he received frequent attention as a leader of the Not Too Young To Run initiative in Kwara state: [4] , [5] (contains but is not limited to quotes), [6] . There was also some coverage of his attendance at COP26 : [7] , [8] . Various outlets have covered his appearance at the UN ECOSOC Youth Forum in 2023: [9] , [10] . (I have not attempted to compile a complete list.) None of these require OR to extract the content, and all can therefore properly be combined under NBASIC. Conclusion: Olasupo has been the recipient of sufficiently widespread coverage in reliable sources independent of the subject, that it is appropriate and consistent with our encyclopedic purpose to combine the available sources under NBASIC. -- Visviva ( talk ) 03:56, 14 July 2023 (UTC) [ reply ] Thank you Visviva .

BeanieFan11 ( talk ) 16:08, 15 December 2023 (UTC) [ reply ] @ BeanieFan11 : I don't know what to say. I think he is definitely notable for ro.wiki: he was an Olympic handball player, a handball referee and coach of Karres Media»ô (later renamed Record Media»ô), with which he won the Romanian women's handball championship 3 times. As for Arcanum, yes, it is a Hungarian newspaper archive, but it also contains hundreds, if not thousands, of Romanian newspapers. Yes, I have access to that source and a search for 'Bruno Holztr√§ger' returned 28 results. His name is mentioned especially in German-language Romanian newspapers. At that time, there was a significant German minority in Romania (about 400,000 people), and handball was introduced to the country by them. In the beginning, there were handball teams only in Romanian cities with a significant German population. Holztr√§ger's name is mentioned in Neuer Weg (the main German-language newspaper), in Sportul Popular (the main Romanian-language sports newspaper), in Curentul , and other national or local newspapers, from 1948 to 1996. If you wish, you can download from here the newspaper pages from which I cropped the photos uploaded to Commons (the link only works for 6 days). 28 references might not seem like much, but the communist press, especially in the 50s, was very strictly controlled and the only 'stars' that could be written about in abundance were the communist dignitaries. Bruno Holztr√§ger is also mentioned many times in this book about Romanian handball players and coaches of German origin. As you can see, there are enough reliable sources from Romania, but too few international sources. However, I would like the article to be kept if possible. -- Nenea hartia ( talk ) 19:10, 15 December 2023 (UTC) [ reply ] @ Nenea hartia : That book source is a nice find - with 49 mentions of him, it's almost certainly significant coverage on Holztrager; as for the others, looking at the one clipping, it seems to be mainly an interview? Unfortunately I don't think it would help much. Do any of the other matches for his name cover him in-depth? BeanieFan11 ( talk ) 19:22, 15 December 2023 (UTC) [ reply ] @ BeanieFan11 : There are a couple. Please use the same link , I have added two more files. For example an article from March 1996 called Ein Mann namens Bruno Holztr√§ger (A man named Bruno Holztr√§ger) or a short obituary from 1978: Bruno Holztr√§ger gestorben (Bruno Holztr√§ger died). Most of the others are generally mentions of him as a handball player, coach, or referee. There could be other references to him, for example in this big Romanian newspaper archive. Unfortunately, although every scanned pdf has OCR, there is no search engine for the whole database, so a search by Holztr√§ger's name is not possible. -- Nenea hartia ( talk ) 20:17, 15 December 2023 (UTC) [ reply ] The obit is okay, but the other one is really good. That with the book is enough for notability in my opinion. BeanieFan11 ( talk ) 22:15, 15 December 2023 (UTC) [ reply ] Keep , per the great finds by Nenea hartia, especially the book that mentions him on 49 pages and the last two newspaper articles; his obit mentions that he was one of the \"greatest handball players in the world in the 1930s\" and the other one is an in-depth piece on his life almost 20 years after he died.

I can see that the current article is basically an extended list and needs drastic sorting-out, but I don't think the existing information is of zero use to anyone who wants to make improvements, so I cannot recommend a TNT delete.

Concert reviews often contain analysis and critical commentary, which does constitute significant coverage, particularly in the genre of classical music, where concert reviews are one of the primary venues for music criticism. Here's an excerpt from the Guardian review: Aviv String Quartet, founded in 1997, is rapidly emerging as one of today's finest chamber ensembles. Rich, warm and distinctive in sound, their playing combining technical exactitude with instinctive emotional intensity. Their methodology is often striking. With many quartets, the first violinist tends to be the principal figure. Here, however, the second violinist Evgenia Epshtein and viola player Shuli Waterman are predominant, anchoring their performances in rhythmic and harmonic density and gradually prising the music open from within, while the leader, Sergey Ostrovsky and cellist Rachel Mercer weave gracious tendrils of sound around them. Not only is this significant coverage, the fact that this ensemble has concert reviews in major general-audience newspapers such as The Guardian and New York Times is strong evidence that it will have also been covered in specialist publications such as The Strad -- and hey, look: [49] , [50] .

Jeraxmoira ( talk ) 18:16, 9 August 2023 (UTC) [ reply ] If you read what he/she wrote, you will see that he/she did. Some of the sources he/she mentioned are already cited in the article. -- Toddy1 (talk) 18:23, 9 August 2023 (UTC) [ reply ] I did read it and that's why I asked for the source(s). Whatever he/she has written apart from what already exists on the article looks like original research to me. I did look for \"Der Spiegel and Hong Kong‚Äôs South China Morning Post, and The Insider, but only found the insider which is a trivial mention once again. And an IP editor with no other contributions comes and drops 3 paragraphs with 0 refs? Jeraxmoira ( talk ) 20:32, 9 August 2023 (UTC) [ reply ] There is an article from Hong Kong‚Äôs South China Morning Post in the references in the article. Maybe that is the one the IP editor is talking about. Though it is possible that the South China Morning Post has done more than one article about Cyriac Abby Philips. -- Toddy1 (talk) 12:22, 11 August 2023 (UTC) [ reply ] I may be wrong here but the South China Morning Post's article revolves around a controversial tweet by him. He has significant coverage just from controversial tweets as a whole. Also, I just checked Wikipedia:Notability (doctors) and feel he may pass one of the criteria listed on it.

There's a lot of reading to do. But I will just make a point now that this page was only created today. Yes, it was not exactly created in a good state, but couldn't something have been put on the talk page in the first instance? SirfurboyüèÑ ( talk ) 22:37, 25 October 2023 (UTC) [ reply ] Comment . A quick look at newspapers.com finds that Basehor-Linwood High School was the result of a merger of Basehor High School and Linwood High School in approximately 1966. Newspapers.com shows approximately 3700 results for Basehor High School, dating back to at least 1930. It shows about 2500 for Linwood High School (limited to Kansas), also dating back to 1930. If shows approximately 1700 articles for Basehor-Linwood High School. It would be very surprising if these nearly 8,000 newspaper articles didn't provide sufficient coverage to establish notability. Jacona ( talk ) According to this non-reliable source, Basehor High School has roots back to 1885 under the name Prairie Gardens, so we're talking about nearly a century and a half of history to peruse.

After wading through a small portion of the material available on newspapers.com, it is readily apparent that there is significant coverage in WP:RS which WP:NEXISTs to meet WP:GNG . I've added a very small portion of this to the article. There are currently 13 references. Many more are available. The difficulty is that there are so many references to wade through to find the ones that are useful. In 150 years, there are probably a lot more sources offline than there are online. These count, but they are hard to find. Jacona ( talk ) 02:47, 26 October 2023 (UTC) [ reply ] Keep - Per Jacona, and WP:HEY as the article is already in much improved state and passes WP:GNG .

There is a hill more than 130 meters high in the north of the village. Like Xiaotangshan Village, it is named after the hill. It turns out that Datangshan Village is rich in water resources. There are many springs at the foot of the mountain. The spring water flows continuously all year round. The temperature is about 20 degrees Celsius, which is enough for the villagers to live and irrigate nearby farmland. A proverb once said: \"Datang Mountain is a good place, with clear mountains and beautiful scenery. Vegetables are available all year round, and the hills are full of flowers and fruits; the ponds are black and the mud is white, and the rice is fragrant in the hot water at the foot of the mountain.\" Natural resources are not endless. In the 1960s, Water sources dry up. Datangshan Village is affiliated to Xiaotangshan Town and is very close to Xiaotangshan Village. Although some corporate units have moved in, the village's situation is far inferior to that of Xiaotangshan Village.
