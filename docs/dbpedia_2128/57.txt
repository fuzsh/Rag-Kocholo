This was initially released under the name âSpecial AKAâ, before the band changed to âThe Specialsâ when recording their first LP. The 7â single was a double A-side featuring, in lieu of another Special AKA song as the other A-side, but the eponymous single by The Selecter. The release was the dÃ©but of the now famous 2 Tone Records, based out of Coventry. This was soon followed by more classics of the genre - The Prince by Madness, and On My Radio by The Selecter.

The Beat (known in the US, for disambiguation purposes, as The English Beat) and Elvis Costello also had releases on this label.

Gangsters is a re-working of Prince Busterâs classic from the first wave of ska, 1964âs Al Capone.

The opening line mentions Bernie Rhodes, manager of The Clash. According to wikipedia, Gangsters is about an incident that happened while on tour in France with The Clash. The Specials were held responsible for damage in a hotel that another English band had allegedly caused, and the hotel manager held one of their guitars as collateral. The situation escalated when the hotel called the local police, and ended with the Specials paying for the damage.
