In 1979 Jerry Dammers from ska band The Specials launched the cult music label 2 Tone Records, with the support of major label Chrysalis. 2 Tone was most famous for releasing ska and reggae-influenced music with a punk rock and pop music overtone, spawned from the 2 Tone music and cultural movement of the 1970s.

Artwork was central to 2 Tone Records and with the assistance of Horace Panter and graphic designer John "Teflon" Sims, Dammers created the Walt Jabsco logo which portrays a man in a black suit, white shirt, black tie, pork pie hat, white socks and black loafers. The fictional character was based on a photograph of Peter Tosh, a former member of The Wailers and came to be the logo that represented the movement, and the music.

The Best of 2 Tone is a new compilation of the best tracks from the label‰۪s history, including The Specials ‰Û÷A Message to You Rudy‰۪, the debut single from Madness ‰Û÷The Prince‰۪ and The Beat‰۪s classic cover of Smokey Robinson‰۪s ‰Û÷Tears of a Clown‰۪
