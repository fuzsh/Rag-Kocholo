Compilation Album On 180g Vinyl Double LP!

In 1979, Jerry Dammers from The Specials launched the cult music label 2 Tone Records, with the independent label Chrysalis. 2 Tone was most famous for releasing ska and reggae-influenced music with a punk rock and pop music overtone.

To celebrate the music and cultural movement that the label helped inspire, Parlophone has created a new compilation that brings together the best tracks from the label's history. THE BEST OF 2 TONE.

THE BEST OF 2 TONE features 18 tracks, including the first single from Madness ("The Prince"), the Beat's classic cover of Smokey Robinson's "Tears Of A Clown," and Bodysnatchers' "People Do Rocksteady," plus three more songs by The Selecter: "On My Radio," "Three Minute Hero" and "Missing Words."

Half of the album features music recorded by The Special AKA, which was shortened later to The Specials. Along with "Gangsters," the collection also includes both of the band's U.K. #1's - "Too Much Too Young" (1980) and "Ghost Town" (1981) - as well as several Top 10 songs: "A Message To You, Rudy," "Rat Race," "Stereotype," "Do Nothing," and "Free Nelson Mandela."
