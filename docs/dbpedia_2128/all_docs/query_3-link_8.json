        "text": "I've always felt that both George Michael (c.1990 to 1994) and Prince (c.1992 to 1995) didn't really have any legitimate reason for their record-company disputes and accordant (strange) behavior in the early/mid-1990s. Do you agree?\n\nI'm a huge Prince fan, and I have an ear for George Michael's best (less campy and MOR) stuff, but both of these guys just totally lost the plot, career-wise, as I see it, in the early 1990s.\n\nGeorge Michael had been burned once, by Innervision in the UK, back when he was 18 or whatever, but then Sony bought him (and Wham!) out of that contract and set them up for massive global success from 1984. Michael went solo in 1987, probably against Sony's wishes, but (as far as I know) they supported and marketed him hugely in this, with the result that by 1988 he was arguably the biggest solo star in the USA (well, up there with Michael Jackson and Madonna). By 1990, George apparently thought that in order to be taken seriously as an artist, he had to stop all promotion (in the form of videos, appearances, live shows)... but then blamed Sony for not supporting him enough -- even though Listen Without Prejudice was a US#1 and sold millions, without a lead-off single video or tour.\n\nPrince, who loved to construct his own reality (and bad movies) at the best of times, had been in a perpetual state of frustration with Warner Brothers since about 1987, when they talked him down from a triple album (which became Sign O' The Times, a double) and tried to talk him out of another 1987 release, The Funk Bible (which became The Black Album... which Warners agreed to release anyway... which Prince then spontaneously decided to cancel, after hundreds of thousands of copies had been manufactured). In 1991, with his contract expiring, Prince released Diamonds & Pearls, a huge seller (6 million copies) that encouraged Warners to offer him a huge contract, one of the biggest in record industry history to that point. Prince signed it, and then kept delivering records faster than Warners could possibly release or market them. The Gold Album sat on the shelf for a full year before it was released, by which point Prince had long-since lost interest and then he refused to promote it. Not being able to get out of his contract, Prince then decided to needle Warner Brothers by declaring himself dead and changing his name to an unpronounceable symbol. This, he said (joked), got him out of his contract. Most of these shenanigans backfired on Prince, as his fan-base was indeed getting confused by the plethora of releases, was alienated by his changing his name from the one they all loved, and was put-off by his more extreme means of protest such as (rather inappropriately, in my view) painting 'Slave' on his face in public.\n\nIn short, what did either of these guys really have to be upset about?\n\nBoth labels had supported their mutual endeavors in becoming one of the biggest stars on the planet. George Michael didn't want to spend so much time and energy promoting himself after the 80s... and I think Sony had no problem with that -- he could still be the world's 6th-biggest star instead of 1st -- as long as George was willing to accept a slightly reduced stature as the inevitable result of no promotion. And Warner Brothers had done everything under the sun to meet Prince's every request (including funding two turkey movies in a row) for years, and were quite right that his commercial standing was declining as a result of over-saturating the market.\n\nI'm sure there are aspects of this that I don't fully understand, but I just do not think either guy had a leg to stand on. (Not surprisingly, George Michael lost his court-case, and Prince's releasing records on his own label from 1996 did not result in increase sales.)\n\nDoes anyone think either of these superstars had a legit beef?\n\nYes.\n\nIn an industry built on exploiting and marginalizing and discarding — esp. homosexual and African-American males, respectively — I don’t begrudge artists of any stripe for trying to set and reset the market terms of their creative expression, esp. when the duration of that creative expression is so capricious (and esp. when said industry enjoyed a prodigious ROI for years on the artifacts of that creative expression).\n\nWere I an artist, I would feel depressed and anxious if my art was not largely representative of my intrinsic motivations — power, affiliation, achievement, identity, etc. — which means I would likely predictably self-medicate and behave erratically, which in turn would most likely impact my creative expression in a negative feedback loop...as it did for both artists in question.\n\nWhile both artists enjoyed the fruits of their labor to some extent, the structures in place at that time were not built for the artistic explorations — with the attendant variations in quality and quantity — that artists like GM and Prince wanted, and when you deny innovative artists outlets for their artifacts, there will be blowback and aftershocks on all sides.\n\nFurther, there’s an inherent bias in the “what are you complaining about” argument that always favors business over talent, esp. in legal cases where firms are more motivated to keep relationships with companies rather than artists. (For example, in American baseball, arbitration cases usually reward the team rather than the player.) And we will never truly know the full range of desires that drove the artists, so it’s conjecture that reveals less about the artists and more about those doing the speculation.\n\nIf I had the creative fecundity of Prince in the ‘80s, I’d want to explore every avenue as an artist to maximize the fruits of my labor, esp. if I was the only artist in history to have a #1 movie and album and song in the same week. And if I was an introverted homosexual male in a culture that only a decade earlier viewed me as subhuman and inherently criminal, and I was being marketed as a hyperheterosexual global pinup, and I wanted to see if my art could succeed without the distorted images to prop it up...well, I might get adamant about trying to make it happen, and I would be more than crushed if it didn’t. ;-)\n\nIn short, both George Michael and Prince had a lot to be upset about, artistically and systemically, and it can’t help but color one’s perceptions about the artists and the art they produced. Again, through my idealistic lens, I favor the artists. If Kubrick wanted 2001 to be shown in 70mm, that’s how it should be experienced; similarly, if Prince wanted me to hear Crystal Ball, I should have had the chance to have that experience without compromise, or to listen without prejudice. That I didn’t was a sad missed opportunity.\n\nDefinitely agree with this, but it's also probably true of just about every artist to an extent. There's always frustration between what one ideally wants to do and what one feels pressured to do by audiences, record companies, etc. to maintain a viable, healthy career.\n\nRe the thread in general, Frank Zappa wound up absolutely hating Warner Brothers, so much so that he'd regularly enough rant about them to audiences, in interviews, etc. I don't recall all of the details there, but Prince's interaction with them was only about 10 years later, so it wouldn't be surprising if some of the same personalities at WB were a problem for Prince.\n\nNo they did not. And I 100% agree with you. Great post.\n\nWith Prince, I think he did have a legit complaint. He wanted to put an album out every 6-8 months or so. The label wanted one every 2 years with a long tour in between. That's a hard gap to bridge, and I would guess most Prince fans would have been on his side there, favoring more new studio material and fewer/shorter tours.\n\nAs for George Michael, I never really understood what his problems were with Sony. It could well have all been behind the scenes disputes that were shielded from the public eye. From my distant perspective, Sony seemed to do a good job with his first two solo albums, even though he increasingly became uncomfortable with his image. That wasn't really Sony's fault though - George himself basically created the image that he subsequently ran away from. There was the unreleased Listen Without Prejudice Volume Two, but from what I've read, that wasn't a case of Sony rejecting the album. It was a case of George deciding that it didn't reflect the \"serious\" image he wanted to project and so he pulled it, parsing out several of the songs that would have been on it to charity albums and non-album singles, etc. Indeed, I think Sony would have been thrilled to put out that album, given that it mostly consisted of uptempo, danceable tracks as compared to the relatively subdued LWP Vol. 1."
