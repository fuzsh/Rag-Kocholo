        "text": "The British ska revival of the late 70s was an exciting time. The short-lived 2-Tone label (founded by The Specials’ Jerry Dammers) was home to arguably some of the greatest music to come from the UK. Over the course of three years, with a mix of good-time party music and political messages, The Specials, The Selecter and The Beat became hugely popular, and although they moved away from their ska roots quicker than most, Madness became one of the most popular British pop bands of all time.\n\nVarious musical artefacts from the ska revival scene have been reissued many times. The Specials and Madness albums have been released in a variety of configurations, while various compilation discs containing key tracks from the 2-Tone catalogue can be found very easily. The best ever compilation, ‘The 2-Tone Story’ (released by Chrysalis Records in 1989) provided an excellent overview of the label’s singles – A’s & B’s – alongside a few key album tracks. The only available CD reissue was a heavily edited botch-job, rather unfortunately; in order to fit a two record set onto a single 5” silver disc, several tracks were omitted. To make matters worse, the CD reissue omitted the set’s only previously unreleased offering, a live version of The Specials’ ‘Stereotypes’ (which should have been on the deluxe reissue of ‘More Specials from 2015 and wasn’t).\n\nA bigger travesty is that the live document of the time, a ninety minute concert movie named ‘Dance Craze’, has been rarely seen in pristine quality since its early eighties release. A home video was issued in 1988, but went out of print almost as quickly as it arrived; copies of this VHS tape are now as rare as hen’s teeth, copies on ebay surface occasionally but usually fetch prices of near £20.\n\nAn LP of highlights was belatedly reissued on CD in the early 90s – a reissue of the 1981 LP and cassette – but is actually harder to find than those by-now scratchy video cassettes.\n\nWith The Beat and Specials catalogues having been reissued as deluxe sets, the first two Bad Manners albums finally getting an official UK CD release in 2011 and The Selecter going great guns on the live circuit (and with new material behind them) by the middle of 2015, we feel a proper and comprehensive deluxe reissue of ‘Dance Craze’ is more than overdue.\n\nIn addition to releasing the 90 minute concert movie on DVD, such a set should include the complete soundtrack on 2CDs – a vast upgrade from the original CD. With the bonus of the unused tracks, we believe it would be an essential item for both obsessive fans and those with an interest in seeing these bands in their formative years.\n\n2-TONE DANCE CRAZE: THE DEFINITIVE EDITION\n\nDVD\n\nDance Craze – The Concert Movie\n\nTHE SPECIALS Nite KlubMADNESS The PrinceBAD MANNERS Ne Ne Na Na Na Na Nu NuTHE BODYSNATCHERS Shanty Town/007\n\nTHE SELECTER Three Minute HeroTHE BEAT Rankin Full StopTHE BEAT Big ShotTHE SPECIALS Concrete JungleMADNESS Swan LakeMADNESS Razor Blade AlleyTHE SELECTER Missing WordsTHE BODYSNATCHERS Let’s Do Rock SteadyBAD MANNERS Lip Up FattyMADNESS MadnessTHE SPECIALS Too Much Too YoungTHE SELECTER On My RadioTHE BODYSNATCHERS Easy LifeTHE BEAT Rough RiderTHE SPECIALS Man At C&A\n\nBAD MANNERS Inner London ViolenceMADNESS Night Boat To CairoTHE BEAT Twist & CrawlBAD MANNERS Wooly BullyTHE SELECTER Too Much PressureTHE BEAT Mirror In The BathroomMADNESS One Step BeyondTHE SPECIALS Nite Klub (Reprise)\n\nDance Craze – The Outtakes\n\nBAD MANNERS – The Magnificent Seven\n\nTHE SELECTER – Carry Go Bring Come\n\nCD1+2 – The Soundtrack\n\nSee DVD tracklist for full details"
