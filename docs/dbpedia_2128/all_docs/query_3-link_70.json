        "text": "The Wild Heart\n\nEMI Records (1983)\n\nStevie Nicks\n\nStevie Nicks was inspired to write Stand Back on hearing Prince’s Little Red Corvette. On learning this, Prince, who was at the time recording at Sunset Sound Studios, arrived unannounced at Studio 55 in Los Angeles where Nicks was laying down the track on 8 February 1983. Prince took the synthesizer parts that appear in the track’s final version as released on her second solo LP The Wild Heart, under EMI Records on 6 June 1983. Stand Back was released as a single on 19 May 1983 and peaked at 5 in the Billboard Hot 100. Prince’s contribution is uncredited.\n\nA Private Heaven\n\nEMI Records (1984)\n\nSheena Easton\n\nPrince’s run of collaborations with Irish singing sensation Sheena Easton began by chance, both happened to be recording at Sunset Sound Studios in Hollywood in January 1984 and sharing the same audio engineer. Looking to spice up her girl next door image, she asked Prince if he would contribute a song for her next LP. Prince responded to the brief and wrote Sugar Walls on 20 January 1984 and was named one of Tipper Gore’s ‘Filthy Fifteen’ – tracks her lobby group of concerned mothers branded too inappropriate for America’s youth, and led to the introduction of the Parental Advisory label. Easton added her vocal to Prince’s instrumentation on the 22nd and Sugar Walls was included in her fifth studio album A Private Heaven released by EMI Records on 7 September 1984. Sugar Walls was the LPs third single, issued on 22 December 1984, and topped the Billboard Disco chart. Prince is credited for the song under the name Alexander Nevermind.\n\nA.C.\n\nColumbia Records (1985)\n\nAndré Cymone\n\nAndré “Cymone” Anderson was Prince’s first band member. Childhood friends, Cymone played bass for Prince on his 1979 debut tour and the 1981 Dirty Mind Tour, quitting the band immediately after to pursue a solo career, signed to Columbia Records. Prince contributed a track for Cymone’s third LP A.C., the result of Cymone’s mother Bernadette Anderson, who Prince held in high regard, asked him to help out her son. Obliging, Prince offered a song named The Dance Electric he recorded at Flying Cloud Drive warehouse on 17 August 1984. The Dance Electric was included in A.C., with Prince’s instrumentation retained in full, including Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman’s background vocals; the sole amendment was replacing Prince’s lead vocals with Cymone’s. Released on 16 July 1985, the track was the LP’s lead single and peaked at number 8 in the Billboard Disco chart. A.C. followed on 16 August but met only moderate success, charting in the Billboard 200 at 121, it was Cymone’s final album. Prince’s original version of The Dance Electric with his vocals was released on Purple Rain Deluxe in 2017.\n\nMazarati\n\nPaisley Park Records (1986)\n\nMazarati\n\nWhen Brown Mark, bassist for Prince’s backing band in The Revolution decided to go into music production in 1986, Prince offered a helping hand. Mazarati was a seven-piece R&B band Brown had been mentoring to make their debut record. Through Brown, Mazarati got signed to Prince’s Paisley Park Records in 1985. Brown produced their self-titled LP and for it Prince offered them 100 MPH, Jerk Out and famously Kiss. Although when hearing Mazarati’s version of the track, Prince decided Kiss was too good to give away, keeping it for himself, it was a chart topping single for Prince’s eighth LP Parade. The band declined Jerk Out so was later offered to The Time and top ten single for their reunion album Pandemonium in 1990. Prince recorded 100 MPH at his Flying Cloud Drive warehouse studio in June 1984, playing all the instruments. His instrumentation was retained in the Mazarati version, with his vocals overdubbed by the band’s lead singer “Sir” Casey Terry in April 1985. Prince additionally wrote the lyrics to Brown’s Strawberry Lover and I Guess It’s All Over which also appear on the album. Mazarati was released on 4 March 1986 and although peaked at only 133 in the Billboard Pop chart, 100 MPH the LP’s second single, following on 13 June 1986, climbed to 12 in the Disco chart.\n\nTelepathy\n\nRCA Records (1987)\n\nDeborah Allen\n\nCountry singer Deborah Allen was introduced to Prince via their mutual sound engineer while recording at Sunset Sound in Hollywood. Allen had been advised by her label to broaden her appeal to move into pop and so asked her engineer if Prince would be interested to help. Prince obliged and re-recorded Witness 4 The Prosecution for her but decided to instead give her another song he had recorded that same day 6 October 1986; Telepathy. Prince’s instrumentation was retained on the song, along with Eric Leeds’ sax. Telepathy became both the title track and lead single for her third LP, which was released by RCA Records on 19 March 1987. Prince is credited for his involvement under the name Joey Coco, yet the album and single failed to chart. Prince’s 1986 reworking of Witness 4 The Prosecution was released on Sign O’ The Times Super Deluxe in 2020.\n\nNo Sound But A Heart\n\nEMI Records (1987)\n\nSheena Easton\n\nIn 1987, Sheena Easton turned to a career in acting when landing a role in Miami Vice. Since Sugar Walls in 1984, fortunes had been flagging and in search of a hit despite Nile Rogers’ producing her previous album Do You. Easton turned again to Prince who in 1986 gave her the song Eternity, a ballad he created at Sunset Sound in December 1985. Easton added her vocals to the track in 1986, retaining Prince’s original music on the finished song. Eternity was released on her eighth LP No Sound But A Heart on 30 May 1987, just as Prince started his hugely successful European Sign O’ The Times Tour. A victim to bad timing, No Sound But A Heart was cancelled in the US days before its release owing to the amalgamation of EMI America into EMI Manhattan Records, bumping its original scheduled February release to June 1987. The Europe release of the LP was unaffected and went ahead as planned but would be Easton’s final release with EMI. Being too ballad focussed, No Sound But A Heart failed to chart, yet her career received a much needed revival owing to her duet with Prince with U Got The Look released as a single that July, charting 2 in the US. Prince received only instrumental credit for Eternity, as Rocker Happyfella for keyboards and Freddie “The Phantom” for guitar.\n\nTaja Sevelle\n\nPaisley Park Records (1987)\n\nTaja Sevelle\n\nHaving met Prince at First Avenue and subsequently cast as an extra in Purple Rain, Taja Sevelle was an early signing to Prince’s Paisley Park Records in 1985. Despite this, Taja had little involvement from Prince for her self-titled debut LP, produced by Chico Bennett. For it, Prince submitted the track Wouldn’t You Love To Love Me? which originated from 1976 but reworked in 1986 for Michael Jackson’s Bad album who declined it. The second song If I Could Get Your Attention was written specifically for Taja, which Prince recorded at Sunset Sound in May 1986, with her vocals added that July. Although uncredited, his instrumentals were retained on both tracks as released on the LP Taja Sevelle on 19 September 1987. Its big hit Love Is Contagious helped the record chart in the UK at number 48, in March 1988. Wouldn’t You Love To Love Me? became the LP’s second single and peaked in the US at number 61. Prince’s version of the track, with his vocals, was released in 2019 in Originals. Prince re-recorded If I Could Get Your Attention in 2014 and was released as a digital single on TIDAL on 9 November 2015.\n\nRiot In English\n\nPaisley Park Records (1988)\n\nDale Bozzio\n\nPrince being a fan of Frank Zappa’s new wave band Missing Persons, he signed its co-founder, Dale Bozzio, to Paisley Park Records in 1986 in the aftermath of the group’s disbanding. The two even dated for a point, during which their worked on her debut solo LP Riot In English. Prince agreed to contribute two tracks for it – So Strong and The Latest Fashion. Prince recorded both tracks at his Galpin Blvd home studio in April 1987 during rehearsals for the Sign O’ The Times Tour. Bozzio turned down The Latest Fashion and so it was passed to Morris Day in 1989 to overdub his lead vocals for inclusion in the Graffiti Bridge soundtrack. So Strong was included in Riot In English retaining Prince’s original instrumentation. The LP was released on 4 March 1988 but failed to chart; it was her first and only album with Paisley Park Records, although in 1991 Prince remixed a track Take Me To Your Leader released on her LP Make Love Not War on 31 October 2010. Prince is uncredited on the tracks.\n\nThe Lover In Me\n\nMCA Records (1988)\n\nSheena Easton\n\nFollowing their successful collaboration in 1987 with U Got The Look, Sheena Easton asked Prince to produce her ninth studio LP The Lover In Me. Unable to create a whole record due to his own commitments, Prince contributed three songs to the album: 101 a track Prince had recorded at Sunset Sound Studios on 10 January 1987, and Cool Love produced specifically for Easton and recorded at Paisley Park Studios on 1 May 1988. Prince plays all instruments on both songs and is credited for them on the LP under the name Joey Coco. Prince decided to hold the third song, titled Jaguar, giving that instead to Mavis Staples for her LP Time Waits For No One in 1989. The Lover In Me was released on 7 November 1988 by MCA Records and charted at 44 in the US and 30 in the UK. Inspired by the view from her bedroom window, Sheena sent Prince lyrics for the ballad The Arms Of Orion, in January 1989 he put music to it as was released as the third single for Batman.\n\nCK\n\nWarner Bros. Records (1988)\n\nChaka Khan\n\nFollowing on from her Platinum selling cover version of I Feel For You, this time Prince contributed two songs for Chaka Khan’s eighth solo LP, titled CK. The tracks were Eternity, which Prince recorded in on 8 December 1985 at Sunset Sound Studios and earlier gave to Sheena Easton in 1986 to overdub her vocals as included on her LP No Sound But A Heart released in July 1987. Khan covered the track in 1988 for CK, which also featured Prince’s Sticky Wicked, recorded at Paisley Park Studios in June 1988. Prince performs all instruments on both tracks except the horns on Sticky Wicked which are performed by Eric Leeds and Atlanta Bliss. Miles Davis added his part to the track on 29 June 1988 at The Hit Factory, New York. CK was released under Warner on 22 November and peaked at 17 in the Billboard R&B chart. No longer signed to a label, in 1998 Prince produced the entirety of Khan’s tenth LP Come 2 My House and released it on NPG Records to give her career a boost.\n\nLike A Prayer\n\nSire Records (1989)\n\nMadonna\n\nTo help cover its running costs, Paisley Park Studios was available for commercial hire. Recording part of her fourth solo LP Like A Prayer at Paisley Park during March 1988, Prince co-produced as well as duetted with Madonna in Love Song. He also plays the opening riff on the title track, and guitar throughout both Keep It Together and Act Of Contrition, the latter he co-wrote with Madonna. The album’s cover shot is by Herb Ritts, whom Prince commissioned in 1993 for his The Hits / The B-Sides compilations. Like A Prayer was released under Warner imprint Sire Records on 21 March 1989 and topped the charts in both the UK and US. Prince’s contribution is credited on the LP for co-writing Love Song. After staging her concert at the Xcel Energy Center in Minneapolis, in the early hours of 9 October 2015 she, her touring band and dancers coached over to Paisley Park when Prince put on a 65 minute show for them in the NPG Music Club live room.\n\nBe Yourself\n\nMCA Records (1989)\n\nPatti Labelle\n\nThe year 1986 is legendary in Prince’s output, the year he created three albums which would evolve into his iconic double LP Sign O’ The Times. That November, during those historic sessions at Sunset Sound Studios, Prince produced the track Yo Mister, performing all the instruments. Keen to work with Patti Labelle on her next album, Prince gave her the track in 1988 following an introduction arranged by Sheila E. Labelle replaced Prince’s lead vocals with her own in a session at Paisley Park that took place on 21 May 1988. Labelle had a breakout hit in 1986 in a collaboration with Burt Bacharach with On My Own. Yo Mister was the first of two songs Prince contributed to her ninth LP Be Yourself. The second, titled Love 89 was co-written by Prince and Sheena Easton, which he recorded in April 1988 – the track features an early strain of Trust. Love 89 was passed to Labelle who overdubbed her vocals in the same 21 May session, retaining Prince’s instrumentation and backing vocals. Be Yourself was released on 26 June 1989 and peaked at number 14 in the R&B chart. Prince’s involvement on it is credited as Paisley Park. Yo Mister was released on 10 October as the LP’s promotional single and peaked at 8 in the Billboard R&B singles chart.\n\nGood Feeling\n\nMotown Records (1989)\n\nBrownMark\n\nMark Brown, stage named BrownMark, was bassist in Prince’s touring band from 1981, which in 1983 became named The Revolution. When the group disbanded in 1986, Brown embarked on a solo career signed to Motown Records. To help him out, Prince gave Brown the track Shall We Dance, which was recorded at Paisley Park Studios on 2 January 1989. Brown’s lead vocals were dubbed over Prince’s on the original, preserving Prince’s instrumentation. Shall We Dance and a further track – produced by Levi Seacer Jr and featuring Prince’s backing vocals recorded in 1989 – Bang Bang, were released on Brown’s fourth solo LP Good Feeling, on 19 September 1989. It did not enter the charts.\n\nTime The Motion\n\nPaisley Park Records (1989)\n\nKahoru Kohiruimaki\n\nKahoru Kohiruimaki is a famous Japanese artist who debuted in 1985. Her manager, Seijiro Udo, who was also handling the promotion of the Japan leg of the Lovesexy Tour in 1989, asked Prince if he would contribute for Kohiruimaki’s next album. Prince provided two songs, Bliss and Mind Bells, which were created for her that summer when he was back at Paisley Park Studios, the same sessions which created the debut record for Ingrid Chavez. Prince played all the instruments on the tracks as well as the backing vocals, which are retained in the final versions in which Kohiruimak overdubbed her lead vocals (in English). Her sixth solo album was released by Paisley Park Records (distributed by TDK Records) on 11 November 1989, charted at number 2 in Japan. A live album featuring the songs was captured on 11 February 1990 during the supporting tour was released on 25 June 1990, again under Paisley Park Records. Prince is credited by name.\n\nPrivate Waters In The Great Divide\n\nColumbia Records (1990)\n\nKid Creole and the Coconuts\n\nAfter meeting Kid Creole (August Darnell) while on the road in Europe staging his Lovesexy Tour, Prince promised Kid Creole and the Coconuts a track for their upcoming third LP Private Waters In The Great Divide. Prince chose for them The Sex Of It, earlier laid down during his recording sessions for the Madhouse 16 LP at Paisley Park Studios on 29 July 1987. The track thereby features Eric Leeds and Atlanta bliss on horns. Prince had considered it for Morris Day in 1989, before in 1990 offering it to Creole instead. Prince and Sheila E’s backing vocals along with all Prince’s instrumentation were retained on the finished version of the track, with Creole’s lead vocals added in early 1990. The Sex Of It was the album’s lead single and charted at 29 in the UK. Prince is credited by name.\n\nI Am\n\nChrysalis Records (1990)\n\nElisa Fiorillo\n\nIn September 1989, Elisa Fiorillo was at Paisley Park Studios laying down her solo LP under the production of David Rivkin and Levi Seacer Jr. In a stroke of good fortune, as his two studios were booked, Prince happened to drop in. He immediately involved himself in the project and wrote Fiorillo five songs; On The Way Up, helped the trio finish the writing of the album’s title track I Am, and both wrote, and performed the instruments, for Oooh This I Need, Playgirl and Love’s No Fun. Playgirl additionally features Ingrid Chavez and Rosie Gaines on backing vocals. The LP was released by Chrysalis Records on 18 September 1990 but failed to chart. Prince has production credit for Oooh This I Need only – the album’s third single. Love’s No Fun was re-recorded by Mayte in 1993 for her debut LP Child Of The Sun. Fiorillo also appeared as a backing vocalist on Graffiti Bridge. Since married, she accompanied Prince on tour in 2010 for Welcome 2 America as Elisa Dease.\n\nSpellbound\n\nVirgin Records (1991)\n\nPaula Abdul\n\nAlthough originally written in 1979, Prince re-reworked his track titled U during October 1987 at Paisley Park Studios, when written into an early draft of the movie Graffiti Bridge. As that project evolved, U was instead offered to Paula Abdul, who choreographed the movie’s lavish dance routines. In 1990, she overdubbed her lead vocals and kept Prince’s instrumentation. The track was included on Abdul’s second LP Spellbound released on 14 May 1991, it entered the US chart at 5 and climbed to the top spot. Prince is credited for the song’s production under the name Paisley Park.\n\nBurnin'\n\nMCA Records (1991)\n\nPatti Labelle\n\nPrince was busy on a number of projects in 1991, as well as his debut with the New Power Generation, Diamonds And Pearls, he was producing LPs for Carmen Electra and Mavis Staples. That April, Prince co-wrote I Hear Your Voice with NPG’s vocalist Rosie Gaines intended for her solo record Concrete Jungle, however the song was given to Patti Labelle who overdubbed her vocals on the track that summer, retaining Prince’s instrumentation as well as backing vocals. It was Prince’s second collaboration with Labelle, following 1989’s Be Yourself. I Hear Your Voice was issued on Labelle’s eleventh solo LP Burnin’ on 1 October 1991 by MCA Records, the same day as Diamonds And Pearls. Burnin’ peaked at 9 on the Billboard chart and would win Labelle a Grammy in 1992 for Best Female R&B Performance. Prince is credited for the song’s production under the name Paisley Park.\n\nPrecious\n\nLana Lane Records (1992)\n\nLoïs Lane\n\nDutch singing duo Loïs Lane was opening act for Prince’s Nude Tour for the latter stages of its European run in 1990 (Mavis Staples supporting the opening half). The band was headed by sisters Monique and Suzanne Klemann, as Lous Lane originally, but risking copyright claims from DC Comics the band was swiftly renamed Loïs Lane with an accent – taking extra precaution within the US under the name Lois L. Prince wrote two tracks that appear on their third LP Precious. The first, Qualified, was recorded at Paisley Park Studios in 1992 during sessions for Love Symbol Album, with Prince playing the instruments and producing. He also performs on I Oh I and Crying, recorded at the same time, produced by Kirk Johnson. Feeling that the song was better suited with female vocals, the fourth track boasting Prince involvement is Sex, the Klemann’s vocals overdubbing Prince’s but retaining his original music. Released under their Lana Lane label on 9 June 1992, Precious peaked on the Dutch chart at 13.\n\nLet’s Get Started\n\nReprise Records (1993)\n\nLouie Louie\n\nBest known as playing the boyfriend of Madonna in her 1984 video Borderline following an audition, Louis Cordero’s career as a solo artist began in 1990 signed to CBS Records, releasing his debut The State I’m In with Epic Records on 4 April that year. It peaked on Billboard at 136, the single entered the top 20. Cordero switched to Warner’s Reprise label for his second LP Let’s Get Started for which he received the Prince songs Dance Unto The Rhythm and Get Blue, recorded in March 1991 at Larrabee Studios during the sessions for Ingrid Chavez’s album May 19, 1992. Further instrumentation, saxophone and percussion was added to Prince, and his vocals overdubbed with Cordero’s. Rosie Gaines’ backing vocals was retained on the latter track. Prince’s third offering Hey, Louie Louie was rejected for the final album. Let’s Get Started also received contribution from George Michael for the track Brother Louie. Prince’s involvement in the record is credited as Paisley Park. Let’s Get Started was released on 16 February 1993 but did not enter the charts. Prince’s original version of Get Blue with his vocals was released in Diamonds And Pearls Super Deluxe on 27 October 2023.\n\nIn A Word Or 2\n\nWarner Bros. Records (1993)\n\nMonie Love\n\nSimone Johnson (staged named Monie Love) achieved a rare accolade – a British female rapper to receive two Grammy nominations for best rap performance, for her debut album Down To Earth released in 1990. Bringing her to Prince’s attention, he asked Love if she would contribute raps for an album he was working on for Carmen Electra, writing versus for Step To The Mic and All That. In return for the favour, Prince co-wrote and produced the tracks In A Word Or 2 and Born To B.R.E.E.D. which they recorded at Paisley Park Studios in January 1992 during the album sessions for Love Symbol, Prince playing all instruments on both tracks. The tracks were released on Love’s second album In A Word Or 2 on 9 March 1993, which peaked at number 75 in the US R&B chart. Born To B.R.E.E.D. was the album’s second single and topped Billboard’s Dance chart.\n\nHeaven Help Us All\n\nElektra Records (1993)\n\nThe Steeles\n\nThe Steeles are a gospel group comprised of siblings Fred, JD, Jearlyn and Jevetta Steele. JD had known Prince since 1977, the year after the family had moved to Minneapolis from Gary, Indiana. But it was Jevetta who brought the group to Prince’s attention in 1989 on hearing her perform Calling You for the soundtrack of the movie Baghdad Cafe. Prince invited The Steeles over to Paisley Park Studios to add backing vocals to Melody Cool for Mavis Staples, and again in December 1990 for Willing And Able. The quartet also appeared on Mavis Staples’ The Voice. In return, Prince gave them the song Well Done which he recorded at Paisley Park in February 1990 with Levi Seacer and David Rivkin; he reworked it again in 1991 in the intention to give to Ingrid Chavez. For this reason Prince receives sole writing credit for the track. Well Done instead passed to The Steeles in 1993, who overdubbed Prince’s vocals for their debut LP Heaven Help Us All, released by Elektra Records on 8 June 1993 – the day after Prince’s birthday when he changed his name to Prince love symbol. The album did not chart. Tommy Barbarella was keyboardist for The Steeles and through his association with them, joined Prince’s band the NPG in late 1990. The Steeles went on to back Prince for his final shows of Act II Tour in September 1993, and in 1994 sung lead vocals for his song Super Hero for the movie Blankman. The Steeles worked with Prince until 1994 and also appear on Carmen Electra, Child Of The Sun, and Prince’s The Sacrifice Of Victor.\n\nHere It Is\n\nColumbia Records (1993)\n\nJevetta Steele\n\nFormer criminal lawyer Jevetta Steele began her professional singing career in 1983, and from 1988 was full-time with siblings JD, Fred, Jearlyn and Billy as The Steeles. Jevetta quickly became an in-demand session vocalist and in 1988 came to recognition with Calling You for the movie Bagdad Café, later covered by Celine Dion. This bought her to the attention of Prince. In 1991, Prince offered Javetta the track Hold Me he had recorded in London during Nude Tour in June 1990, to go on her solo album. Jevetta overdubbed Prince’s vocals that December, and keeping his original instrumentation. A second track Open Book, previously considered for Martika’s Kitchen and recorded at Paisley Park in December 1990 also passed to Jevetta and overdubbed with her vocals. The tracks were released on her debut album Here It Is which was twice issued: firstly only in France in May 1991 (that version containing the third Prince-worked track, Skip 2 My U My Darling, recorded in the same sessions – in the finished record, all Prince’s instrumentation and vocals were replaced). Here It Is was released globally on 10 August 1993 under Columbia Records, this version omitting Skip 2 My U My Darling. The album did not chart. All three of Prince’s contributions, featuring his original lead vocals were released in Diamonds And Pearls Super Deluxe in 2023.\n\nMillennium\n\nReprise Records (1993)\n\nEarth, Wind & Fire\n\nMaurice White of Earth, Wind & Fire was offered as a producer for newly signed Prince’s debut LP For You in 1977 – Prince famously refused. Prince recorded Super Hero in September 1992 for Earth, Wind & Fire, specifically for their sixteenth studio album Millennium. Prince’s backing vocals, keyboards and drum programming were retained on the final version of the track as released on the LP on 14 September 1993. Millennium peaked at number 8 in the Billboard R&B chart. Prince is credited by his own name for his work on the album. In 1994, Prince (as Prince love symbol) re-recorded Super Hero with the New Power Generation, with vocals performed by The Steeles. That version was released in the movie soundtrack Blankman.\n\nThe Red Shoes\n\nColumbia Records (1993)\n\nKate Bush\n\nDespite being a fan of Kate Bush since her Hounds Of Love LP in 1985, it was not until 1990 did Prince and Bush have the chance to meet, when he was in London staging the Nude Tour. Bush recorded Why Should I Love You? in 1991 at Abbey Road Studios in London then sent the track to Prince. That spring, at Larrabee Sound Studios in Los Angeles, Prince added his guitar, bass and keyboards to the track as well as backing vocals. Bush subsequently reworked Prince’s version, adding also comedian Lenny Henry’s vocals to it and was eventually released on her seventh LP The Red Shoes on 5 October 1993. The LP peaked at number 2 in the UK chart and 28 in the US.\n\nHey Man... Smell My Finger\n\nPaisley Park Records (1993)\n\nGeorge Clinton\n\nClinton’s live performance of Knee Deep inspired Prince to write Erotic City in 1983. When Clinton’s career was on the wane, Prince signed him to Paisley Park Records in 1989 to issue Clinton’s The Cinderella Theory. In 1989, Prince co-wrote The Big Pump with Clinton, on which Prince performs all the instruments. Then in 1990, put his backing vocals to the track Get Satisfied. The tracks were released on Clinton’s next LP Hey Man… Smell My Finger on 12 October 1993, which would became the final album issued by Prince’s Paisley Park Records prior to the label’s closure by Warner Bros in February 1994, Prince reissuing the album on his newly created NPG Records that year. Hey Man… Smell My Finger peaked at 31 in the US R&B chart. Prince is uncredited for his contribution.\n\nCloser Than Close\n\nMotown Records (1995)\n\nRosie Gaines\n\nWhen Rosie Gaines joined Prince’s touring band as a keyboardist and vocalist in December 1989 in replacement of Boni Boyer, part of the arrangement she struck was that she could pursue a solo career. Gaines attained a central role in the band during the Nude Tour and afterwards joined the New Power Generation, famously duetting with Prince on the title track of the NPG’s debut LP Diamonds And Pearls. Gaines left the band following its supporting tour but remained signed to a retainer with Prince and so features on his albums right up until 1996. Gaines was signed to Paisley Park Records and with Prince’s help put together her solo album named Concrete Jungle. Prince co-wrote with Gaines two of its tracks; I Want U recorded at Paisley Park Studios soon after joining Prince’s band, and My Tender Heart tracked with Prince during the London stint for Nude Tour. Prince also sang backing vocals on the latter. Owing to the closure of the label in 1994, Concrete Jungle was abandoned and Gains took the record to Motown which released it as Closer Than Close on 13 June 1995. The title track was remixed by electro DJs Hipolito Torrales and Mark Mendoza and released on 19 May 1997 and charted at 4 in the UK. Prince’s original version of My Tender Heart was issued in Diamonds And Pearls Super Deluxe in 2023.\n\nTo The Teeth\n\nRighteous Babe Records (1999)\n\nAni DiFranco\n\nOn watching Ani DiFranco perform at a concert she staged at the Midway Stadium in Minneapolis on 3 July 1999, Prince invited her to Paisley Park Studios to lay down acoustic guitar to his track Eye Love U, But Eye Don’t Trust U Anymore. Prince, as Prince love symbol, released the track on his LP Rave Un2 The Joy Fantastic on 9 November 1999. In return, Prince added his backing vocals to DiFranco’s track Providence which was configured into her tenth solo record To The Teeth. Released one week after Rave Un2 The Joy Fantastic under her own label Righteous Babe Records, To The Teeth peaked in the Billboard album chart at number 76.\n\nRock Steady\n\nInterscope Records (2001)\n\nNo Doubt\n\nPrince invited Gwen Stefani to add co-lead vocals to his track So Far, So Pleased, for his first ‘collaboration LP’ Rave Un2 The Joy Fantastic in 1999. In return, Prince (as Prince love symbol) reworked Waiting Room, a track No Doubt previously recorded intended for the band’s fourth LP Return To Saturn. Prince added his keyboards and vocals to the track on 10 July 1999 which so changed the song it was slipped to No Doubt’s fifth album Rock Steady released on 11 December 2001. Rock Steady climbed to number 9 in the Billboard album chart. Prince is thereby credited for co-writing Waiting Room under his own name.\n\nCan'tneverdidnothin'\n\nVirgin Records (2005)\n\nNikka Costa\n\nHaving not met Prince before, in 2001 Nikka Costa was surprised to receive an invite to perform at Paisley Park for Prince: A Celebration. She guested for him in 2002 in the closing show of his One Nite Alone… Tour and in 2004 sent him lyrics to a newly composed song titled Silver Tongue, which he recorded and supplied the music. The track was released on the NPG Music Club as a virtual B-side for Call My Name on 13 July 2004. In that session which took place at Paisley Park Studios during early 2004, Prince also laid down guitar for Around The World, a track Costa co-wrote with her husband Justin Stanley. The song, released on her sixth album Can’tneverdidnothin’ on 24 May 2005, also features John Blackwell on drums. Silver Tongue was considered for the album although not deemed a suitable fit. Costa later recorded her own version of the song, which she released it in 2017. Prince’s involvement on Can’tneverdidnothin’, which peaked at 157 on Billboard, is uncredited.\n\nHow Late Do U Have 2BB4UR Absent?\n\nThe C Kunspyruhzy (2005)\n\nGeorge Clinton\n\nPrince and George Clinton worked on the track Paradigm in 2000, their first collaboration since 1994’s 1-800 NEW FUNK compilation LP showcasing the launch of Prince independent label NPG Records. Clinton created the basis of the track before sending to Prince to add his instrumentation and backing vocals at Paisley Park Studios. The track remained unattached to an album for some time, when it was configured into Clinton’s How Late Do U Have 2BB4UR Absent? as issued on 6 September 2005 – Clinton’s first album with the P-Funk All-Stars in nine years. Prince is credited for his contribution on the song under the name Prince love symbol.\n\nA Time To Love\n\nMotown Records (2005)\n\nStevie Wonder\n\nStevie Wonder had long been a creative inspiration for Prince, in 2004 they collaborated on So What The Fuss, Wonder’s first single in a decade. Prince plays guitar on the track. So What The Fuss is doubly noteworthy for reuniting the four original members of En Vogue who added backing vocals to the track. The song was released on 16 May 2005 as the lead single for Wonder’s twenty-fifth studio LP A Time To Love which was issued on 18 October 2005. The album charted at number 5 in the Billboard 200. So What The Fuss peaked at number 19 in the UK singles chart, on which Prince is credited by name."
