        "text": "In 1992, Atlanta hip-hop outfit Arrested Development released its breakout single âTennessee,â a song that prominently loops Prince whispering the stateâs name on his Lovesexy track, âAlphabet St.â Itâs a sample that Speech, the groupâs frontman, credits for the songâs international success. In hindsight, though, the rapper also believes the Minneapolis legend, who never approved the sampleâs original use, cared enough about other artists to not kill Speechâs burgeoning career before it truly began. (Princeâs lawyers asked for a modest $100,000â but no songwriting creditâinstead of filing a lawsuit.)\n\nSo when Speech heard about Princeâs death, he was in utter disbelief, repeatedly refreshing his Twitter feed while driving home in hopes there had been some mistake. A few hours later, Speech spoke with us about his idolâs influence on him, his memorable encounters with the rock star, and how the Purple Oneâs music shaped Arrested Developmentâs catalog.\n\nHow did you first hear about Princeâs death?\n\nMy wife was telling me about it. Then I was checking Twitter to see if I could find any information. All of the sudden, my phone refreshed and it was the number one trending topic. I was driving and I just grabbed my chest, literally, feeling like I had lost an immediate family member. Itâs hard to put into words how much it affected me. My wife, many times, offered for me to pull over. I just wanted to get home. I was flipping through the channels on the radio to see if this was true. I was in denial, hoping and praying it wasnât real. Most people werenât talking about it.\n\nYou have to understand for me, personally, Prince is literally my favorite artist of all time. Hands down. Iâm just thoroughly moved by the millions of statements heâs made, not just lyrically, but visually, in the subject matter heâs tackled, the world he created and continued to recreate. It moved me time and time again. Itâs been intense. I havenât listened to any of his music other than what happened to catch on the radio or TV. Iâve been glued to the news. Iâm still in disbelief.\n\nWere you able to see him last week in Atlanta for what would be his final show?\n\nNo, I wasnât. But Iâve seen him numerous times live and Iâve had the pleasure of meeting him and performing at Paisley Park.\n\nWhen did you first meet him?\n\nPrince was a person I was supposed to meet a number of times. He summoned me to meet him at Paisley Park back in 1993. I simply couldnât make it. At the very moment he summoned me, I was mastering an album that I couldnât get out of.\n\nThe next time, my bass player for Arrested Development, [Joseph McCreary, Jr., who goes by Foley,] had played for Miles Davis, and knew Prince personally. We were in Minneapolis on tour. He called Prince to see if we could come by. He said yes. On that particular day, Prince did not come out of hiding. I say hiding because, from what I heard from his band members, he was watching us from behind a one-way mirror! But he never came out. So that was interesting andâ¦ different.\n\nWhen I finally met him, I was with one of my friends Victor Wooten, one of the best bass players on the planet. I was touring in his band, probably, around 2004 or 2005. He was invited to play at Paisley Park. I was part of that entourage and that reality. We performed there and got a chance to meet him right after that performance.\n\nWhat was it like to finally meeting a decade or so later?\n\nItâs surreal. Heâs influenced me in ways that I canât put into words as a writer, as a human beingâmy worldview. He has a lot to do with who I am as an individual. So, to meet that person, youâre not going to be able to put into words what that person means to you. Meeting him was fantastic. I told him how much I appreciate who he is and that heâs my favorite artist of all time. He said that never gets old to him. He appreciates that. Then he said: How is your career going?\n\nThatâs interesting given that you sampled Princeâs âAlphabet St.â without his permission on âTennessee.â\n\nI didnât know how sampling laws worked at that time when we were releasing [3 Years, 5 Months & 2 Days in the Life Ofâ¦]. I donât even think the industry knew how it all worked because it was such a new phenomenon. I sampled from âAlphabet St.â his word âTennessee,â which obviously was the title of the first single. Anyway, we didnât get the sample cleared. I didnât know to clear it. We released the record.\n\nI didnât hear anything from anybody. He waited until the record peaked on the pop charts. As soon as it [dropped down], we got a call from his representatives. They wanted $100,000 for the sample. To be honest, now that Iâve been in the industry long enough, I realized that he really gave me a break. There were a few other things that he couldâve done. He couldâve demanded that the record be taken off the shelf, requested the sample be taken out of the record, demanded publishing and writing credits on the record. He didnât do that. Instead, he wanted a flat fee. No writing creditsâjust $100,000.\n\nIn those days, when you had a [hit] throughout the nation, we made way more than that, so we paid it. But he waited for the very moment it went down the charts, and only once it went down, did we get the call. I think that was a testimony to his savvy and how he thought. Nonetheless, when we did meet up, he was a fan, and had respected what we had done.\n\nMany artists attribute Prince as a musical influence. But in this case, your career was launched with the help of his work through the sample, as well as his willingness to not clamp down on Arrested Developmentâs rising career. Things couldâve happened so differently.\n\nWithout a question, I believe that. Could I have said the word Tennessee? I could have. Or I couldâve had someone else say it. But Iâm a big believer that with every sample I used, youâre capturing more than the word or the melody or the beat, youâre capturing the spirit thatâs on the tape. Itâs like taking a photograph of someone where you capture a moment of happiness or sadness. There are things within that sample that are hard to describe. It inspired me. It influenced me. That song will forever mean so much to me. In light of his passing, it takes on a new level.\n\nGoing back to before âTennessee,â do you recall when you first heard him? What about his work captivated you?\n\nIt was one of his first singles, âI Wanna Be Your Lover.â I thought it was a woman. At that time, his picture wasnât everywhere, so I didnât think it was a man. Then I investigated more about his music. I was 100 percent perplexed by Prince and a little conflicted about the words: I wanna be your mother AND your sister too. I didnât understand who he was: Is he gay? Is he straight? As he continued to develop, and as I continued to see the visuals, he just always pushed the boundaries of what was normal, of what was acceptable. He constantly pushed my boundaries and challenged my thoughts. The music was so compelling that it kept me off-balance. It was like a rollercoaster ride.\n\nWhen you listen back through Arrested Developmentâs catalog, where do you hear Prince the most?\n\nIâll put it this way: Ninety-nine percent of the songs weâve ever created have been influenced by Prince and his sensibility. His mixture of funk and blues and jazz and pop, his melodic sensibility, it all plays a huge role, in particular on âMr. Wendalâ and even our new single, âI Donât See You At The Club.â Iâm a hip-hop artist. But the musicality of Prince and the poetry of his music is what made me write this new single. Itâs the subconscious template that I write from every time. This song is no exception.\n\nWith songs like âChildren Play With Earth,â I would pitch my voice; Iâd pitch the audiotape down, so that when we put it back to regular speed, it had a lifted voice, sort of a chipmunk voice. That was a trick of Prince from many of his records where heâd take on the alter ego. What I think is beautiful, what I think is funky, and what I think is nasty, and sick, and awesome comes from a Prince worldview in a lot of ways.\n\nAny fan of Arrested Development whoâs read our interviews knows that Prince is my favorite artist. Fans of Prince come to our shows and bring to me gifts of Prince concerts, rare footage they capture at a club, or at Paisley Park. Thereâs a community in the sense of people who have been moved by Prince. Heâs the greatest artist of our time.\n\nWhich record will you listen to first in his memory?\n\nThereâs so many songs Iâll end up playing. âThe Ballad of Dorothy Parkerâ has always been one of my favorites off Sign âOâ The Times. âThe Crossâ is another wonderful song. In light of his death, I think of certain songs like âUnder the Cherry Moon,â where he talks about how young heroes die, or âSometimes It Snows in April,â where heâs talking about the fragile nature of life and the passion heâd want to live with while heâs alive. Those resonate, for some reason, for me on this day.\n\nPrince put out so much in such a short amount of time. I feel like the energy force that was in this man is just inspiring as an artist. Heâs a great example of knowing how much you can do, how much quality you can produce, within a [finite] time period, knowing that life is temporary."
