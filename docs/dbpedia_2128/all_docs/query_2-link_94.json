        "text": "A 'definitive' guide to the legendary 2 Tone Records, the label behind releases by Coventry's own The Specials, is being published next month. Written by Daniel Rachel, Too Much Too Young The 2 Tone Records Story: Rude Boys, Racism and the Soundtrack of a Generation, maps out the journey of one of the UK’s most influential record labels that became a movement that shook up the nation with its rebellious spirit.\n\nIn 1979, 2 Tone exploded into the national consciousness as records by The Specials, The Selecter, Madness, The Beat and The Bodysnatchers burst onto the charts and a youth movement was born. 2 Tone was black and white: a multi-racial force of British and Caribbean island musicians singing about social issues, racism, class and gender struggles.\n\nThe music of 2 Tone was exuberant: white youth learning to dance to the infectious rhythm of ska and reggae, crossed with a punk attitude to create an original hybrid. The idea of 2 Tone was born in Coventry, masterminded by a middle-class art student raised in the church.\n\nRead more: 14 Celebrities you never knew had connections to Coventry\n\nRead more: The Coventry landmarks you need to see in your lifetime\n\nDaniel Rachel said: \"As a child, 2 Tone defined the way I saw the world. I was seduced by the off-beat rhythms, the cool looking clothes and most importantly the social and political lyrics. 2 Tone taught me about black and white unity, it gave a voice to the pointlessness of street violence, and it provided an understanding and awareness of the horror of rape and apartheid.\"\n\n2 Tone's founder Jerry Dammers had a vision of an English Motown. Borrowing £700, the label's first record featured 'Gangsters' by Dammers' band The Specials, backed by an instrumental track by the as yet unformed Selecter. Within two months the single was at number six in the national charts.\n\nDammers signed Madness, The Beat and The Bodysnatchers as a glut of successive hits propelled 2 Tone onto Top of the Pops and into the hearts and minds of a generation. However, soon infighting amongst the bands and the pressures of running a label caused 2 Tone to bow to an inevitable weight of expectation and recrimination.\n\n2 Tone then entered a new phase. Perhaps not as commercially successful as its 1979-1981 incarnation, the label nevertheless continued to thrive for a further four years, making a string of fresh signings and releasing a stunning end-piece finale in '(Free) Nelson Mandela'. Told in three parts, Too Much Too Young is being billed as the definitive story of a label that for a brief, bright burning moment, shaped British culture.\n\nRachel said: \"That you could dance, look good and be educated by a record was incredible. This music and these bands have printed an indelible mark on my life. To write the story of 2 Tone is one of profound personal pride.\n\n\"But more so, to honour one of the greatest periods in modern popular culture. 2 Tone at its heart was a movement of great songwriters, musicians and songs - We danced and sang, and the music played in a de boomtown.\""
