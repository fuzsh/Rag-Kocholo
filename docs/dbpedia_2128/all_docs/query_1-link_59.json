        "text": "One possible interpretation of this song is Prince tells us that we should break away from our mundane reality and look for the esoteric purple bananas. But our behaviour deviates from the norm, and other people think we are crazy. Perhaps Prince wants us to ignore what other people think and to keep breaking norms until they haul us to the loony bin.\n\nContemporary society separates madness from the everyday world. [Michel Foucault][2] describes the history of madness and the development of the first asylums. In the Renaissance, the mad were portrayed as possessing a kind of wisdom—a knowledge of the limits of our world, experiencing the horizon of reason. As the &#8216;age of reason' developed, anyone that didn't meet the strict requirements of rational thought and behaviour was labelled as mad and locked up in an institution.\n\nLet's Go Crazy is ultimately a song about our responsibility to create a meaningful life in an otherwise absurd and unfair world. This message aligns with the work of Existentialist philosophers. Prince voices this thought clearly in his song:\n\nWhat's it all for (What's it all for). You better live now. Before the grim reaper come knocking on your door.\n\nPrince creates meaning by not following what society deems to be reasonable and rational. He advises us to go crazy and go nuts. Being different is not a disease, being deviant is not a reason to be locked up. Living on the Horizon of Reason is necessary to be able to live life in fullness. Prince's imperative does not necessarily mean that we must continuously party like it is 1999, but that we dare to be different in our thoughts or to use a well-trodden cliché, think outside the box."
