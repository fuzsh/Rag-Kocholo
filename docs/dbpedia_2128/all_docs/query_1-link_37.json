        "text": "Kylie Minogue says she nearly recorded a song with Prince in the early 90s after she met him at a show in Earl’s Court.\n\nSpeaking to Zane Lowe on Apple Music Radio ahead of her 15th studio album DISCO (November 6), Minogue described telling Prince that she was working on an album during their meeting – prompting the singer to suggest a collaboration.\n\n“Well, I had an almost dream come true, which was with Prince,” Minogue said. “I met him. As a 14-year-old, a hormonally charged music maniac, Prince is just… it. Then I went to see his show, God, early 90s at Earl’s Court – RIP Earl’s Court – and got to meet him afterwards.”\n\n“I don’t know where I plucked up the courage from, but I said: ‘Ah, I’m making an album,’” she added. “I don’t know what I said. I have no idea. This is before phones and stuff. I’m more gutsy than I kind of make out sometimes even to myself.”\n\n“We hung out and he kind of put me on the spot a bit. He was like, ‘So where are your lyrics?’ I’m like, ‘I don’t…’” Kylie continued. After she wrote lyrics for Prince and the session ended, a driver then dropped a cassette to Kylie which had a demo version for a track called Baby Doll.\n\nMinogue then explained that her label at the time disliked that Prince would want to record all the song’s instrumental himself, so the song never came into fruition. She added that she didn’t know where the cassette would currently be.\n\nWatch the full 47-minute interview below."
