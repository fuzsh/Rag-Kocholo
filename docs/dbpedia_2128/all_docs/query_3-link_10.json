But one could argue that no list is complete without the musical variety of Prince.\n\nPrince Rogers Nelson, commonly known as Prince, displayed musical talents at an early age that defined his long career of creativity.\n\nThroughout his tenure, he recorded classic hits such as “When Doves Cry,” “1999,” and his biggest chart-topping single and album — “Purple Rain.”\n\nIt is well documented that the artist was adamant about owning the music he produced. And when he was entrenched in a legal battle relating to ownership, he went to what some might consider extreme measures to get his point across and fight for the creative freedom he desired.\n\n“Imagine yourself sitting in a room with the biggest of the big in the recording industry, and you have ‘slave’ written on your face. That changes the entire conversation,” Prince had explained, according to Touré. “You know what they think of us? They say, ‘It makes it real hard to talk to you with that on your face.’ Why? And it got real quiet. They don’t want to get into all that. Adding that language into the conversation worked perfectly. It changed the dynamic of the conversation.”\n\n“Referring to himself as a ‘slave’ was partly about saying…‘Does the label own my music or my body? Do I have the right to leave it if I want? Or am I stuck here?’” Touré continued. “He was light-years away from being a slave… but he was reaching for a shocking public gesture that would embarrass the label into a corner and force them to give him the freedom he wanted. I asked, is there a difference between Prince and the Artist? He said, ‘Only that Prince owns nothing.’”\n\nBillboard further reports that Prince and Warner Bros. eventually parted ways in 1996. He released albums on several other labels after the Warner Bros. era, owning his masters from all recordings with the other labels.\n\nIn 2014, Warner Bros. gave Prince his masters for the work he recorded with them in a deal requiring two new albums.\n\nUntil his untimely passing, Prince worked relentlessly, fighting for artist ownership across the music industry. Even in 2015, he pulled his music from all streaming platforms — except Tidal — for more revenue share, considering the company released his final two albums.\n\nIn a previous report from AfroTech, Ciara noted Prince as one of the influences on her obtaining her masters. Therefore, it seems that his radical movement was not in vain.\n\nJosh Rodgers\n\nLover of Culture. Curator of Motivation. Advocate for Equity.
