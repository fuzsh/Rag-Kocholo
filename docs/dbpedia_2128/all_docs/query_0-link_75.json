        "text": "2 Tone Records was the brainchild of Jerry Dammers, a reggae and ska fan from Coventry. More a culture mash than a culture clash, the label took the ideology and DIY aesthetics of punk, welded it to the Jamaican dance music that was prevalent in the multi-cultural Midlands and created the most exciting musical sound this writer had ever heard in his 10 short years on the planet.\n\nIt was almost too much for someone so young. That it happened to be the edgiest, most fashionable music of the era, with the razor-sharp creases on their Sta-Prest as razor-sharp as the attitudes of the folk wearing them, was neither here nor there. For me, 2 Tone was plain and simply exciting pop music, no different to Dog Eat Dog or Kids In America or Status Quo’s ‘Down Down‘.\n\n2 Tone was initially conceived as a vehicle for Dammers to release his own Special AKA singles, but quickly became a collective that put out some of the most vital, insistent and exciting records of the era.\n\nTo keep the costs down, 2 Tone’s first release was a split release – ‘Gangsters‘ by The Special AKA on the one side (catalogue number TT1), with The Selecter’s eponymously-titled instrumental (catalogue number TT2) on the other.\n\nThe Special AKA. – Gangsters\n\nhttps://plainorpan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/11-gangsters.mp3\n\nThe Selecter – The Selecter\n\nhttps://plainorpan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/16-the-selecter.mp3\n\nThe Special AKA’s track was the one favoured by DJs and went Top 10. The ‘flip’, not many realised, was actually a track without a band. John Bradbury, The Specials’ drummer played backing to a couple of local musicians who’d written the lilting instrumental based on the original ska records they heard around the city. When ‘Gangsters‘ became a hit, Dammers realised the need for an actual Selecter and, just as the pop impresarios of the previous decade had done, a Selecter was quickly formed.\n\nWith a strong emphasis on black and white, both in clothing and personnel, the bands on 2 Tone were coiled springs of energy, bobbing left, right and centre on their numerous Top of their Pops appearances. Suedeheads, pork pie hats and loafers became desirable items of want.\n\nThe suedehead was easy enough (though too severe for my mum’s liking (and mine, if truth be told) – I had a pre-Stone Roses bowl cut instead), Burtons sold tassled loafers and skinny black ties – next to the white shirts and sober suits in the ‘funeral’ section, believe it or not, but where in Irvine could you buy a pork pie hat?\n\nEasier to get a hold of were the most important things – the records. Every Sauturday I’d run down to Walker’s at the Cross with my £1 pocket money and part with 99p of it in exchange for the latest 2 Tone 7″.\n\nThe Prince. Tears Of A Clown. Do Nothing. Stereotype. On My Radio. I had them all.\n\nThen I gave them all away to a jumble sale that was raising money for Band Aid.\n\nRegretted it ever since. I spent the early 90s sifting through boxes of singles at record fairs (remember them?) in the hope I’d turn up an old friend. Some I now own once again, but many still elude me, going for daft prices online. You live and learn, eh?\n\nHey you! Don’t read that, read this! This is the heavy heavy monster read! The nuttiest read around!\n\nOne! Step! Beyoooooond!\n\nOne Step Beyond is a skankin’ slice of primo Jamaican ska written by Prince Buster. It first appeared on the b-side of his single Al Capone, itself the blueprint for The Specials Gangsters.\n\nOne Step Beyond – Prince Buster\n\nhttps://plainorpan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/one-step-beyond.mp3\n\nIt’s largely instrumental, a rasping saxophone-led knees-up, occasionally punctuated by some frantic chickaboom-chickaboom-chickaboom-chickaboom-chick ska-tting and Prince Buster’s titular cry.\n\nBut you knew all that already. Thanks to Madness, you’ll be more than familiar with the tune. If you’re of a similar age to myself, you’ll be well aware of how important the tune was to your formative years. It was one of the first tracks I heard that made me appreciate the power of music. It was loud, catchy and novel enough to grab the ears of young listeners everywhere. We didn’t know it wasn’t an original, we just loved doing the primary 7 approximation of the nutty dance to One Step Beyond by Madness.\n\nMadness owe a lot to Prince Buster. After a brief flirtation as The North London Invaders, they named themselves after one of his tracks, which they themselves covered on the b-side of their first single, a single they called ‘The Prince‘.\n\nPrince Buster – Madness\n\nhttps://plainorpan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/madness.mp3\n\nTo further cement the Prince Buster connection, Chas Smash’s opening vocal earthquake on One Step Beyond is hotwired and paraphrased directly from another Prince Buster track, The Scorcher.\n\nPrince Buster – The Scorcher\n\nhttps://plainorpan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/03-scorcher.mp3\n\nThe Madness take on One Step Beyond is practically a photocopy of Prince Buster’s version (why would you try and improve perfection?) but if you listen closely, really closely, you’ll maybe catch the incessant thuggish background chant of “Here We Go! Here We Go!” that plays throughout most of the track.\n\nThe released Madness version was actually a demo that originally lasted all of 70 seconds. Madness knob twiddlers of choice Langer and Winstanley looped the original track to double the length, but before they were able to mix it properly, the track had been sent off to the pressing plant and was skanking its way up the charts by the time anyone else had noticed.\n\nRealising they had a multi-national hit on their hands, the people in charge of such things thought it’d be a good idea to have Madness release language-specific versions for various territories.\n\nHence the Spanish version, Un Paso Adelante\n\nhttps://plainorpan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/08-un-paso-adelante.mp3\n\n..and the Italian version, Un Passo Avanti\n\nhttps://plainorpan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/18-un-passo-avanti.mp3\n\nWhat a great idea! I love these versions!\n\n*Bonus tracks!\n\nPrince Buster – Al Capone\n\nhttps://plainorpan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/1-14-al-capone.mp3\n\nThe Specials – Gangsters\n\nhttps://plainorpan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/11-gangsters.mp3"
