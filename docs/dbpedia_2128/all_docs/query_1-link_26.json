        "text": "Tragedy struck the music world on April 21st, 2016, when beloved R&B sensation Prince passed away at his Paisley Park home and studio. It’s no secret that Prince was constantly working on new music, and no stretch of the imagination to believe that the Purple One was working on new music in his final days. Prince had released two albums in 2015 alone.\n\nInterestingly, The Today Show may have uncovered one of Prince’s final works this morning. The program aired a tour through Paisley Park, as Prince’s home is set to open up as a museum tomorrow. Observant fans of Prince caught a shot of a music stand in Prince’s famed Studio A, which featured two sheets of lyrics. There were typed lyrics of “Look At Me Look At U,” as well as hand-written lyrics to a song called “Stay Cool.”\n\nIt is unknown what Prince’s intentions were for “Stay Cool,” as the song has never been released and no recordings surface. You can see the screenshot of the Today Show in the image above, which captures the “Stay Cool” lyrics. An attempt to transcribe the lyrics was also made on a Prince.org forum, and can be read below.\n\nStay Cool\n\nAin’t no reason 2 get uptight\n\nWhen everybody else is feelin a groove\n\nAlright, alright?!\n\nStay cool, Baby\n\nDon’t b no tool?\n\nDon’t worry what’s happenin wit the candy girl\n\nU’re the only one that matters in my world\n\nAlright?….Alright?\n\nAlright\n\nStay Cool Stay Cool Baby Baby\n\n” ”\n\nStay Cool, Ur so beautifool\n\nU must b cuz (eye sign) let u break all of my rules\n\n(Eye sign) let u take ur top off in my swimming pool\n\nAlright? Alright\n\nDon’t fight let’s don’t fight\n\n(possibly a scratch-out)Don’t u wanna make sweet love all\n\n_____ night & wake up with a smile\n\na million miles Sun Shines so bright\n\nAlright\n\nStay Cool….Stay Baby Baby\n\nP (signature)\n\nYou can also watch the full Today show segment touring Paisley Park in the video below:\n\nIf this is indeed Prince’s last song, it serves a poignant reminder for fans everywhere to “Stay Cool” in the face of the controversies surrounding Prince’s death. The Purple One lived an incredible and charitable life, and he left behind an incredible legacy of music. Rest in peace, Prince."
