        "text": "As an engineer, mixer and record producer, Sylvia Massy has left her mark on three decades of music. After moving to Los Angeles in the late 1980s, she bagged a job at Larrabee Sound, initially working on albums by Green JellÃ¿, metal icons Tool and all-around musical genius Prince.\n\nIt was there that she also met Rick Rubin, who later recruited her to work on a string of projects at Sound Cityâs Studio B. It was at Sound City that Massy became known for creating a signature sound, with special equipment, unusual recording methods and a vintage Neve 8038 mixing console.\n\nAt the turn of the century, Massy built her own studio, RadioStar, in the northern Californian town of Weed, before moving further up the coast to Ashland, Oregon, where she continues to apply the atypical techniques that have earned her global recognition. In 2016, she released an acclaimed book on inventive recording techniques, Recording Unhinged.\n\nIn this edited extract from her Fireside Chat with Red Bull Radio interviewer Hanna BÃ¤cher, Massy reflects on her career, telling tales of working with Prince, Johnny Cash and Rick Rubin while revealing some of her most unusual recording techniques.\n\nWhen you were a teenager, did you do anything in your spare time that retrospectively may have set you on a path towards music production and mixing?\n\nIâll have to say that my teenage self would be really excited to know what I do today. When I was a kid, I used to have a cassette recorder. I used to get the neighborhood kids together and we would do radio plays. I would direct it and give everyone an acting role. Then I would stop the tape, put on a song on the turntable and then start the tape up again.\n\nSo, I was doing a radio show and including music and everything. Sometimes Iâd have to do it five or six times to get everything just right. Itâs amazing to know that those things that you do when youâre young actually shape the direction that you go when youâre older, and you can do things that you canât even imagine doing if you just put your mind to it and stick with it.\n\nI understand that you began playing in bands in San Francisco as a teenager. Did you grow up there?\n\nIn my late teens, I was shipped out to San Francisco because I was a delinquent in Denver, Colorado, where I grew up. My mother said, âHey, go live with your dad for a while.â So, I spent my later teen years in Concord, Oakland and Berkeley, California, and then, finally, across the bridge in San Francisco.\n\nThe San Francisco days were really great music days. The type of music that was real hot in San Francisco was the first generation of punk rock. It was all about a raw, garage-made kind of vibe. We were dancing like crazy nuts and had our hair all sticking out everywhere.\n\nThatâs where I connected with several musicians and I started playing in a band. First I was a singer and then I learned how to play guitar. More recently, Iâve learned how to play drums, too. Iâve tried to keep my connections to the punk roots that I had in San Francisco, even to the point where this year, I mixed an album by Fang, which is an old San Francisco band from that era. Itâs called Rise Up! and features one of my favorite songs by the band, âThis Machine Kills Rats.â\n\nThere are some recordings floating around of my first bands. One of my first bands was called the Hats. We were new wave at the beginning, right around 1980. We did ska music. I love reggae and ska and, in fact, I think it was my connection to reggae and my love of the genre that got me into recording.\n\nWhen my band went into the studio, I discovered how important the engineer is. When theyâre working on a reggae record, sometimes theyâll do a dub remix. For that the engineer will set up a delay and a reverb on a channel. You can add that to any of the tracks that were recorded, so itâs like the engineer is actually part of the band. The best part about dub reggae is what the engineer does, so I wanted to do that.\n\nHow did you make the step from band member to producer and mixer?\n\nI found that as I learned how to use the equipment for recording my own music, I could also help other bands to record their music. Thatâs what got me into production, because I realized that other peopleâs music was better than my own. People would say, âHey, you do a good job with your own music, can you help me with mine?â So I started spending more time working on other peopleâs music than my own.\n\nThat Tool album was recorded at Larrabee Sound Studios in Los Angeles. Did you move from San Francisco to take that job?\n\nActually, when I first moved to Los Angeles, I couldnât get a studio job anywhere. I was really surprised at this, too, because I had plenty of experience working in San Francisco â even with some well-known artists, like Kirk Hammett â and I co-produced a project with the Sea Hags.\n\nWhen I went to LA, I couldnât get a job anywhere, so I wound up working at Tower Records on Sunset [Boulevard]. That was the best thing I couldâve done, because everyone in Los Angeles, at least at that time, was trying to get into the music industry or trying to be an actor. The people working at Tower Records were really networking and going to auditions and doing as much as they could to break into the business.\n\nSo, thatâs where I met the Green JellÃ¿ people and the Tool people and got connected with my first label jobs through that. But my big break came when I got a gig at a studio called Lion Share on Beverly Boulevard. I went from working at the customer service desk at Tower Records one day to being in the studio with Phil Ramone and Barbra Streisand the next day. It was that much of a shocker. From that point on, I was a studio rat in Los Angeles.\n\nHow did your career in studios progress from there?\n\nImmediately after I worked with Phil Ramone and Barbara Streisand, I got a gig at Larrabee Sound and thatâs where I was an assistant on the Prince projects. At that time, Prince was working several rooms at the same time. He would write, play, sing and perform everything on a song. Heâd work on two songs per room, and have three or four rooms going at the same time.\n\nHis productivity was just off the charts. He was writing so much music. I think that thereâs so much music in his archive that we could hear new Prince songs every week for the rest of our lives. Hopefully, weâll be able to hear some of the things that were never released, because thereâs some fantastic music. I worked with Prince through Larrabee for about three years. And thatâs also where I met Rick Rubin.\n\nWhat was it like working with Prince?\n\nIâve got so many Prince stories. When Prince was coming to Larrabee [for the first time], we were all very nervous about him coming. Heâd never worked at Larrabee before, and my boss said, âYouâve got to make him happy. No matter what you do, make him happy.â When he first showed up and looked around the room, he said, âDo you have a big, overstuffed chair, like a grandmaâs chair, that I could sit in?â\n\nIn the back of my mind, I knew that the studio had nothing like that. But instead, I said, âYeah, of course we do. Let me go and get it.â I ran out the door and immediately went to the office. I said, âSomeone give me a key to their truck.â I got in someoneâs truck, drove to the first antique store I could find, bought a chair, threw it in the back and made it back there about twenty minutes later, while the session was being set up. I just walked in with this big chair. Prince looked at it, sat down in it and he nodded his head. It was a four-day session that turned into four months and then, almost four years. He was happy and he stayed a long time there at Larrabee.\n\nWhat was your role while working for Prince at Larrabee?\n\nI played different roles. I was an assistant engineer for Keith Cohen and any other engineer that would come in that Prince was working with. Prince would also give me jobs, too. I was able to mix some artists he was working with, such as Ingrid Chavez.\n\nI would often carry a journal into the sessions with me. So I was sat at the back of the room, and I was writing in my journal. âThereâs Prince. Heâs sitting on his purple throne, taking a perfectly good record and ruining it with this song.â I was just speaking my mind to the page because I couldnât say it out loud.\n\nSo then Keith says, âSylvia, can you come over here and make a patch for me in the patch bay?â So, I set down my journal and I went over to the patch bay on the other side of the room. Then, I heard Prince saying out loud, âThereâs Prince sitting on his purple throne.â I was like, âOh my God!â He was reading from my journal, what I had just written, and I couldnât believe it.\n\nI dived across the room and grabbed it out of his hand. I was shaking and trembling. He was laughing. He actually really liked that. After that, he gave me more opportunities and, in fact, offered me a job to move to Paisley Park, which is his studio in Minneapolis. So I did spend a lot of time with Prince for a while, but that was a scary moment. Maybe because there are so many yes people around him, he liked it when someone had an opinion. I was also wrong about âGett Off,â because it made it onto the record and was a big hit.\n\nDid you end up working at Paisley Park?\n\nI never actually moved to Paisley Park, because I just got the offer to do the Undertow record with Tool. I really wanted to be a producer more than I wanted to engineer for Prince. He was a tough one to work for. He would work all day and all night [with] no sleep. It was also hard to know when he was actually in the country. We would be waiting for him at the studio and then his management would call us and say, âOh yeah, heâs in Paris now, so you can go home.â\n\nThere were a few times when Prince had me mix a song for him. One time it was a kind of a slow and sultry song, and I canât remember the name of it. Very slow and sexy: âGirl, Iâm gonna do this to youâ kind of thing. I spent all day mixing it, because I wanted him to be so impressed with my mixing abilities. I really worked on it. I knew there was a point in a mix when youâre not supposed to go any further, because itâll only get worse. So at that point I said, âWell, Iâll just wait for Prince. Iâm going to sit down in this chair and leave the mix just the way it is.â\n\nA couple hours later, Prince comes busting through the front door of the studio and he goes straight into the room where I had this mix set up. He had a girl with him. I followed him in there, and I said, âAre you ready for me to play you the mix?â And he says, âI wonât need you. You can just sit outside.â So he and the girl listened to the song. I listened through the door. It was about seven minutes long. After the song ended it was quiet for a while, and I was like, âWhatâs going on?â Prince then comes busting out the door, straight out the front door â no explanation, no nothing. You could tell they were a little messed up. So, I think I just spent all day working on a mix just so he could get it on with a girl!\n\nI concentrate initially on having an artist present for me as many songs as they have written, and I might push them to write more. So when we start a project, sometimes Iâll have a hundred songs to choose from. You can imagine that if you have a hundred songs to choose from, at least twelve of those songs are going to be pretty good. Our chances are better.\n\nYou branched out on your own by setting up the RadioStar Studio in northern California. That was a big step, especially moving away from LA. Did you initially find it difficult to maintain relationships with artists and labels in Los Angeles?\n\nYeah. When I started RadioStar Studios, it was around 2000, and I used email to keep up with my Los Angeles connections. As time went on, I found it was easier for me to connect directly with the artist. As technology got better, we were able to share files over the Internet much faster than ever, which meant that I could work long distance with artists.\n\nI wound up getting a clientele that would come to me from all over the world. I had accommodation at the facility in Northern California so that the musicians would stay over for up to a year. In fact, there was an Australian band, Cog, who stayed for a year while we produced their debut album, The New Normal. It has several great songs on it and thereâs a really unique sound to the whole thing. It really showcases the drummerâs fantastic style.\n\nYour current studio in Oregon is based in an old church, which Iâm assuming offers a lot of natural reverb due to the size of the live room. Do you prefer getting that natural sound, or getting more of a dry recording that you can add your own effects to?\n\nDepending on what the song needs, Iâll sometimes use the big drum room [in the studio] and add a lot of compression to give it this pumping sound. Itâs very exciting. However, sometimes itâs more important to just dry up the drums and add fake reverb on it, or just have no live drums at all on a song. Depending on what the song needs is the direction Iâll go.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I worked with a Norwegian band called Turbonegro in Oslo and we mixed a song called âPowder Ballad.â This is a kind of a tongue-in-cheek acknowledgment of the sound of the â80s. So we added a really artificial-sounding gated reverb on the snare, and it is hilarious. I canât even believe that the music sounded like that in the â80s. Itâs so funny.\n\nYouâre known for trying crazy things in the studio from time to time. Whatâs the oddest thing youâve done to an instrument or using the studio in order to get exactly the sound you want to hear?\n\nI think that when I visit a new studio, the owners hide all the good instruments, because they know that I have a tendency to break things on purpose. I value other peopleâs instruments, so I wonât be breaking instruments that I donât own. But I do like to push boundaries when I record.\n\nThat means sometimes Iâll shoot a piano or Iâll hang a singer upside down, like I did with Serj [Tankian] from System Of A Down. I think itâs all part of getting the creative juices going on a session. Maybe we will try something, and maybe itâll work or not. Once I threw a guitar off a cliff and recorded it as it fell down the side of the cliff into the ocean. In fact, that recording didnât make it onto the final mix, because it wasnât really as good as we were hoping it would be. However, there are times when some of these ideas really turn into something or they spur new ideas that bring us the magic that weâre looking for.\n\nIâm not alone in this â plenty of musicians and producers try weird and wonderful things to get interesting and different sounds. Youâd be surprised at some of the techniques that have been used in the recording of popular music. For instance, like how Bruce Springsteenâs vocals were recorded and then mixed through a reverb in a bathroom, or how Peter Gabriel was taped on a wall while he was doing vocals for one of his solo records.\n\nThese are things that Iâd heard stories about, plus I have my own way of recording, which is sometimes unusual. So I collected all these stories and put them in a book, because there was no book about unusual recording techniques. I wrote this book called Recording Unhinged and illustrated it myself. There are some special diagrams in there about how to mic up a chicken correctly and how to shoot a piano. You can really learn techniques from the people who know plus have some fun with it. Hopefully, youâll be inspired to do a little adventurous recording for yourself."
