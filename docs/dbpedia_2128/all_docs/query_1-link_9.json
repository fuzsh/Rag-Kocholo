        "text": "It was meant to be a country duet with Stevie Nicks\n\nYou read that right.\n\n'Purple Rain' was originally written as a country song, and was intended to be a collaboration with Fleetwood Mac singer Stevie Nicks.\n\nAccording to Nicks, she received a 10-minute instrumental version of the song from Prince, with a request to write the lyrics, but she felt overwhelmed by the task.\n\nShe later said: \"I listened to it and I just got scared. I called him back and said, 'I can't do it. I wish I could. It's too much for me.'\"\n\nPrince's 15 greatest songs, ranked\n\nPrince then asked his backing band to try the song: \"I want to try something before we go home. It's mellow.\"\n\nAccording to Lisa Coleman, Prince changed the song dramatically after Wendy Melvoin started playing the guitar to accompany the song: \"He was excited to hear it voiced differently. It took it out of that country feeling.\n\n\"Then we all started playing it a bit harder and taking it more seriously. We played it for six hours straight and by the end of that day we had it mostly written and arranged.\"\n\nPrince was worried about copying Journey\n\nJourney - Faithfully (Official Video)\n\nAfter recording the song, Prince phoned Journey member Jonathan Cain, to ask him to listen to it.\n\nPrince was concerned that it might be too similar to Journey's 'Faithfully', a song composed by Cain which had recently been in the US charts.\n\nHowever, Cain reassured Prince by saying that the songs only shared the same four chords.\n\n\"I thought it was an amazing tune,\" Cain said. \"I told him, 'Man, I'm just super-flattered that you even called. It shows you're that classy of a guy. Good luck with the song. I know it's gonna be a hit.'\"\n\nThe song formed the basis of the Purple Rain movie\n\nThe album Purple Rain was actually the soundtrack to the first movie Prince made. The film won Prince an Oscar for Best Original Song Score.\n\nThe song itself was the centrepiece of the film and a main plot point. In the movie, the female members of Prince's band, Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman, write a song that Prince ignores.\n\nThis sparks a rant from Wendy (\"Every time we give you a song you say you're going to use it but you never do. You're being paranoid as usual...\"). At the end of the film, Prince's crew has a showdown with another band (The Time). When Prince takes the stage, he introduces 'Purple Rain' as being written by Wendy and Lisa, then plays an incredible show.\n\nWendy and Lisa were actually real members of Prince's band The Revolution until 1987, when they left to form a duo."
