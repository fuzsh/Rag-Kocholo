The fictional character was based on a photograph of Peter Tosh, a former member of The Wailers and came to be the logo that represented the movement, and the music.\n\nThe Best of 2 Tone is a new compilation of the best tracks from the label‰۪s history, including The Specials ‰Û÷A Message to You Rudy‰۪, the debut single from Madness ‰Û÷The Prince‰۪ and The Beat‰۪s classic cover of Smokey Robinson‰۪s ‰Û÷Tears of a Clown‰۪\n\nTRACKLIST:"
