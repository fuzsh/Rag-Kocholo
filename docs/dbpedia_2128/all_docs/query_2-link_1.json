        "text": "Hand stamped by the band themselves on flimsy paper sleeves very few of these have survived in presentable form over the years. Horace Panter, in his excellent account of his time as a Special, states that the first batch were stamped on much more robust cardboard sleeves, which the late John Bradbury obtained from the Virgin record shop where he waws still working at the time. The existence of a cardboard version of the stamped sleeve certainly ups the ante for completists. Given the simplistic nature of its design and the inflated prices this item can achieve on auction sites, it was perhaps inevitable that fake copies would emerge. These fakes are getting progressively better so potential buyers should be aware of, er… gangsters.\n\nWhile there are slightly differing versions about just how exactly this single came to be withdrawn just prior to its release, there can be no doubt about its place on the list of 2 Tone collectables. Of the two versions pressed, one simply has CHSTT7 on the run out groove and the other has both the F-Beat number XX 1, along with two separate 2 Tone catalogue numbers, CHSTT7 (which is crossed out) and CHSTT8. The latter version refers to the copies Costello’s manager, Jake Riviera, had pressed after the planned release was shelved so that they could be given away free at gigs. Given that the track was to be the first single on the Riviera’s newly formed F Beat records it does seems strange that he would press up more copies (said to be 12000) on the 2 Tone label after having been forced to cancel the release. The F-Beat release ended up being a UK Top Ten hit for Costello.\n\nAlthough this single often fetches a high price, it certainly doesn’t reflect its rarity. Since the beginning of online vinyl sales, the version with the F-Beat and 2 Tone catalogue numbers has consistently been available. Did those who attended the gigs, where copies were given away for free, really manage to hold on to enough mint copies to consistently flood the market with them..? Hardly.\n\nThis curious choice of single to promote More Specials in Japan was housed in a unique sleeve and backed by the album version of International Jet Set. The sleeve which is really just a slip of paper printed on both sides features the tracks lyrics on the back in Japanse and English. Often Japanese single releases would come in a green EMI die-cut sleeve with a single sheet slip with the original artwork. The labels show dual catalogue numbers, one of which is basically the More Specials album cat. no. The unique sleeve and A side make this a favourite of collectors to pick up."
