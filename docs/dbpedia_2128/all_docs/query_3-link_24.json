        "text": "Influences\n\nSome of the artists that inspired Prince's music\n\nEarth Wind & Fire\n\nThe origins of some of the complex melodies of Princeâs songs can be heard in the work of the seminal 1970s R&B band.\n\nJoni Mitchell\n\nPrince described the singer-songwriter as a genius and covered her songs in concert.\n\nSly and the Family Stone\n\nSly Stoneâs influence was clear on Princeâs music and presentation. Like the Family Stone, Princeâs first professional band, the Revolution, was multiracial and included women. Prince also covered the bandâs songs in concert.\n\nJames Brown\n\nThe Godfather of Soul was an obvious influence on some of Princeâs funkiest, most percussive tracks.\n\nParliament Funkadelic\n\nPrince was such a fan of the funk band that he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997.\n\nStevie Wonder\n\nPrince performed with Wonder at the White House.\n\nJimi Hendrix\n\nPrince sometimes bristled at comparisons between himself and the rock legend â especially comparisons between Princeâs âPurple Rainâ and Hendrixâs âPurple Hazeâ â but Prince sampled Hendrix and reportedly had been considering performing a set of Hendrix tunes.\n\nLarry Graham\n\nGraham was a member of the Family Stone. He later collaborated with Prince on music and reportedly encouraged Princeâs interest in the Jehovahâs Witnesses.\n\nClose ties\n\nArtists considered to have close ties with Prince and his Paisley Park Studios and label.\n\nJill Jones\n\nJones was a backup singer for Prince and Vanity 6 in the 1980s. He wrote and produced her 1987 album.\n\nVanity 6\n\nVanity 6 was the earliest version of a girl group Prince masterminded. He renamed singer and model Denise Matthews âVanityâ and installed her as the lead singer of the group. The bandâs best known song is âNasty Girl.â Matthews passed away in February 2016.\n\nApollonia 6\n\nAfter Vanity left Vanity 6, Prince placed actress and singer Apollonia Kotero in the group, which had a hit with 1984âs âSex Shooterâ and could be seen in the movie âPurple Rain.â\n\nMorris Day and the Time\n\nPrince produced the band and wrote songs for it. Its best known songs are â777-9311,â âThe Birdâ and âJungle Love.â\n\nThe Family\n\nPrince produced and wrote songs â including âNothing Compares 2 Uâ -- for the short-lived band.\n\nJimmy Jam and Terry Lewis\n\nThe production duo, best known for their work with Janet Jackson, were originally part of The Time.\n\nWendy and Lisa\n\nThe duo, talented writers and musicians in their own right, were part of Princeâs band The Revolution and can famously be seen in the movie âPurple Rain.â\n\nAndy Allo\n\nPrince produced the album âSuperconductorâ for the Cameroonian singer-songwriter.\n\nBria Valente\n\nPrince co-wrote and played on the singerâs 2009 album.\n\nAndre Cymone\n\nThe musician and Prince were childhood friends, and Cymoneâs family even took in Prince for a time.\n\nSheila E.\n\nThe singer and drummer sang backup and played drums for Prince on some of his most iconic late-1980s work.\n\nBrown Mark\n\nThe bassist and producer, born Mark Brown, played in Princeâs band The Revolution.\n\nMadhouse\n\nPrince wrote with and played with the late-1980s-era jazz fusion band.\n\nMazarati\n\nPrince wrote the song â100 MPHâ for the Brown Mark-led band.\n\nIngrid Chavez\n\nThe singer/actress appeared in Princeâs movie âGraffiti Bridge.â Her voice can be heard on his âLovesexyâ album.\n\nCarmen Electra\n\nPrince gave the singer/actress, born Tara Patrick, her stage name, and wrote songs for her 1993 album.\n\nRosie Gaines\n\nGaines was an important voice on Princeâs âDiamonds and Pearlsâ album. The two also dueted on a dazzling live version of âNothing Compares 2 U.â\n\nA far reach\n\nPeople who recorded songs written or co-written by Prince\n\nMartika\n\nPrince wrote several songs for the singer, including âLove â¦ Thy Will Be Done.â\n\nMadonna\n\nThe two co-wrote and performed âLove Songâ on Madonnaâs âLike A Prayerâ album. Prince also plays the opening guitar lick on the albumâs title track.\n\nChaka Khan\n\nPrince wrote âI Feel 4 Uâ for the R&B singer.\n\nCeline Dion\n\nPrince wrote the song âWith This Tearâ for the Canadian singer.\n\nStevie Nicks\n\nPrince co-wrote Nicksâ âStand Backâ with the rocker.\n\nThe Bangles\n\nPrince originally intended the song âManic Mondayâ for the group Apollonia 6, but The Bangles recorded it and had a hit with it instead.\n\nAlicia Keys\n\nKeys covered Princeâs âHow Come U Donât Call Me Anymore.â\n\nSheila E.\n\nShe sang the Prince-penned drum-and-airy-vocals showcase âGlamorous Life.â\n\nSheena Easton\n\nPrince wrote âSugar Wallsâ for the Scottish singer. She also dueted with him on âU Got the Lookâ on his album âSign O The Timesâ and âThe Arms of Orionâ for the âBatmanâ soundtrack.\n\nKenny Rogers\n\nJoey Coco, one of Princeâs many pseudonyms, is listed as the writer for the Kenny Rogers song âYouâre My Love.â\n\nMavis Staples\n\nThe iconic soul singer collaborated with Prince several times in the early 1990s, including on the song âMelody Cool,â which appeared on the soundtrack to his movie âGraffiti Bridge.â\n\nNona Hendryx\n\nHendryx recorded the Prince-penned âBaby Go-Go.â\n\nTevin Campbell\n\nThe soulman was just a teen when Prince gave him the songs âRound and Roundâ and âShhhâ to sing.\n\nWarren Zevon\n\nHindu Love Gods, which included Zevon and members of R.E.M. recorded âRaspberry Beretâ in 1990. Zevon sang it frequently in his solo act.\n\nSinead OâConnor\n\nOâConnor had a massive hit with her cover of The Familyâs song âNothing Compares 2 U.â"
