        "text": "Prince was an icon of music, up there with Michael Jackson and Elvis. He died on Thursday, aged 57.\n\nA bit like those fellow legends, he was also fantastically weird and famed for his mysterious lifestyle.\n\nHe changed his name for a while and even installed a team of tailors in his home to make his clothes.\n\nAnd his devotion to recording new music meant he wrote a new song every day, probably right up until his death.\n\nHe also penned Kiss, made famous by Tom Jones, The Bangles' 80s pop classic Manic Monday and How Come You Don't Call? me Anymore by Alicia Keys.\n\nPrince was also a songwriter for Madonna (and he played guitar on Like a Prayer) and for Cyndi Lauper and Chaka Khan. He sang a duet with Kate Bush. Spot the theme? He wrote badass classics for lots of badass females.\n\nWatch the video: Chaka Khan - I Feel For You, external\n\nWarning: Third party content might contain ads\n\nLegend has it that Prince challenged himself to write a song a day. \"I write so many songs,\" he told the Guardian, external in 2015, adding that he didn't get attached to older music \"because if I did, I couldn't move on and there'd be no space for a new song\".\n\nHe's most famous for his late 1980s records like Lovesexy, 1999 and Sign O' The Times but in total he put out an amazing 39 studio albums, four live albums and multiple compilations.\n\nIt contained sped up tracks which made his vocal sound female.\n\nThe plan was to release it with no reference to Prince and no picture on the cover.\n\nThe album was cancelled but some of the tracks found their way onto later records.\n\nInside there is a lot of purple, external, Prince's signature colour, on the ceilings, painted on speakers and illuminating rooms in neon.\n\nThere is something called the \"galaxy room\" lit up by ultraviolet light and set up for meditation. And there are lots of large portraits of The Purple One.\n\nThere are also two full-sized music venues and the site's music studios were manned 24 hours a day on the off chance that he might want to record.\n\nHis sense of style was a big part of Brand Prince, external and he loved to play around with gender - straddling a bike in leather one minute (in the legendary Purple Rain film), popping on pink, feathered shoulder pads the next.\n\nAnd it's reported he shopped for sportswear in boys' sizes because of his small size. He was five feet two inches, shorter than Madonna.\n\nHe changed his name to a symbol which combined the traditional icons for male and female.\n\nNo keyboard in the world could handle it although some newspapers found a way of adding it to their print settings thanks to a floppy disc (a memory stick, 1990s style) which was reluctantly mailed out by his label.\n\nFor everyone else he became known as \"Symbol\", \"Squiggle\" or \"the Artist Formerly Known as Prince\".\n\nSo why? At the time people saw the switch as evidence that Prince's ego was getting bigger than his music sales.\n\nBut the name change was actually a smart way of annoying Warner. He went back to his old name in 2000, after he'd been released from his contract.\n\nIn the album's notes it says \"recorded at Paisley Park and 3121\".\n\nAnd when he toured it the next year he insisted the ticket prices at huge venues like London's O2 should be Â£31.21.\n\nThe ticket firms were not hugely enthusiastic but even after booking fees were added, it still meant fans got a bargain.\n\nJust listen to the lyrics. Many are much too filthy to type out here.\n\n\"I'm gonna try to tame your little red love machine.\" - Little Red Corvette, 1982\n\n\"Oh pretty little whip/U got me drippin'/Drippin' all over the floor, the floor.\" - Lovesexy, 1988\n\n\"Gett off, 23 positions in a one night stand/Gett off, I'll only call you after if you say I can.\" - Gett Off, 1991"
