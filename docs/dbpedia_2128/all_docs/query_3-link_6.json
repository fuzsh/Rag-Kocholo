        "text": "The song is a religious allegory, based mostly on the apocalyptic Book of Revelation from the Bible with the line \"there will be a new city, streets paved with gold\" being a clear reference to Revelation 21.\n\nAlong those lines, the 7 are generally understood to be the Seven Deadly Sins (Greed, Lust, Envy, Wrath, Gluttony, Sloth, Pride) which are non-Biblical, but closely associated with Christian teachings. They are not individually addressed in the lyrics, but collectively represent the sinful, joy-killing forces of the world, as opposed to the funky righteousness of Prince and his lover. As mentioned by Aaron, in the comments, this is supported by the line \"And before us, Animosity will stand and decree / That we speak not of love, only blasphemy / And in the distance, six others will curse me.\" Animosity is potentially a stand-in for Wrath (and a better fit for the rhythm).\n\nThey could potentially also be the seven plagues loosed on the earth in Revelation. As discussed in other answers, they are unlikely to be the seven angels of Revelation because the angels are holy, and both they and Prince are on the side of righteousness."
