        "text": "Introduction\n\nAround 1987/1988 Prince was looking for expansion of his stable of artists for his Paisley Park Records label. After signing George Clinton and helping him get his financial troubles in order, he went in search for another one of his heroes: Mavis Staples.\n\nMavis Staples\n\nOn July 10, 1939, Mavis Staples was born in Chicago. Her career started 11 years later when she was enlisted in the family group The Staple Singers. After many shows in many churches, a local minor hit and Mavis’ graduation, the group went out on a national tour in 1957. The group was led by (father) Roebuck “Pops” Staples, complemented with his daughters Mavis, Cleotha, Yvonne and (initially) his son Pervis. Because the group actively positioned itself as a religious act, they were quickly dubbed “God’s Greatest Hitmakers”.\n\nThe Staple Singers evolved into one of the leading spiritual groups in the US. Due to their friendship with Martin Luther King Jr. the group became one of the leading (musical) faces of the civil rights movement. In 1968 the group signed a deal with the legendary Stax label, ultimately leading to two number 1 hit singles in the early 1970s: I’ll Take You There and Let’s Do It Again.\n\nIn the meantime Mavis Staples had released her first solo album in 1969. Until 1984 a small amount of solo albums would follow. From the disco era on forwards, The Staple Singers and Mavis Staples slowly disappeared from the public view. Their music wasn’t popular anymore and records didn’t sell as much copies as before. Mavis Staples survived by performing live, both solo and with her family. However, in 1987 Mavis was in serious trouble. She had already sold her car, was about to sell her apartment and the IRS was after her. Her troubles were about to disappear…\n\nPrince calls\n\nIn 1987 Prince’s own label Paisley Park Records had been underway for two years. Next to his own albums, satellite acts like Sheila E., The Family, Madhouse and Jill Jones were also released on his label. Many of those acts were given songs by Prince, enabling them to do their thing on them. Prince had signed many new acts and/or talent, but wanted to broaden his options.\n\nHaving his own label also provided Prince with the opportunity to help older/former heroes. George Clinton was signed, his debts were paid by Prince and he received carte blanche for new music. Around that time Prince heard that Mavis Staples was in search of a record deal. He loved The Staple Singers, and Mavis Staples in particular, and ordered his management to broker a deal for Mavis Staples and Paisley Park Records. They reached out to the pater familias Pops Staples.\n\nMy father called me, and said “Mavis, this man Prince is looking for you.” And I said “Pops, what prince, I don’t know no prince?” He said “The one they call purple.” I said “No, not Prince! What does he want with me?” He said “take the man’s number and call him.”\n\nMavis Staples, 05/20/2020, wxpn interview\n\nPrince didn’t necessarily create music that fit her, but Mavis Staples was convinced of Prince’s genius. She understood this was her chance to work her way back into the public eye and reconnect to the record buying audience. She was eager to work together.\n\nI called the next morning, and I get Prince’s manager, and I asked, “Why would Prince want to produce me? I can’t sing no songs like Appolonia and Vanity, like ‘you nasty boy.’ I’m a grown woman! I need a song of substance.” And he said, “Ms. Staples, Prince is very much aware of the nature of your talent. And he will be writing adult songs for you.” And I said, “Okay, that sounds better.”\n\nMavis Staples, 05/20/2020, wxpn interview\n\nPrince and Mavis met for the first time in August 1987. The Staple Singers were performing in Los Angeles. Prince was present and after the show they would meet. Mavis was about to play it ‘cool’…\n\nThe first time Prince and I met, he came to the Shrine Auditorium, my family was having a concert there, so he came to me. My sisters and I were standing on the side and I told my sisters, I said, “Now this little guy, everybody say he’s so cool. They say he’s so cute! He’s so good-looking!” I told them, “Look, I’m gonna play it cool. When I see him I’m gonna be really cool.” But here comes Prince, coming toward me, white suit, Lucite cain and white boots. He got up on me, and I just screamed ‘Aaargghh’. Yeah, cool went out the window y’all!.\n\nMavis Staples, 04/22/2016, Coachella concert\n\nThe first meeting lasted for about 45 minutes. Mavis was enthused and talked non-stop. Prince was shy, smiled a bit and replied with one or two word answers. Mavis wanted Prince to write for her, but soon realized that communicating with him would be tricky. She decided to write him letters, and she did, often 13/14 pages long. She told her life story. And it would help, particularly for the material on the second album.\n\nLovesexy/God Is Alive\n\nIn February 1988 work on the Mavis Staples album commenced, which lasted until June 1988, for Prince that is (the tapes were sent to Mavis, so she could add her vocals at a later time). Just in time for the European leg of the Lovesexy tour, Prince would embark on in July. Mavis went with him and she performed at the tour’s first aftershow. The day after she performed at the regular show.\n\nI went on stage and we did I’ll Take You There in that big place and it was unbelievable. Prince said to the crowd, “Can you say Mavis Staples?” and all those kids screamed my name.\n\nMavis Staples, Uptown magazine #12\n\nDuring the tour something changed in their relationship, Prince started to talk, sometimes for hours on end. When the tour hit England, Prince and Mavis went into the Olympic Studios in London to record her vocals on God Is Alive, which unfortunately hasn’t seen the light of day, yet. Also see the subarticle Prince and Mavis Staples – God Is Alive.\n\nAlbum: Time Waits For No One\n\nOn their first album together, Prince and Mavis Staples worked separately. Prince primarily recorded in his newly opened Paisley Park Studios and Mavis in Memphis. The album was largely filled with songs that were already written and recorded prior to Mavis entering the picture. The song Interesting was written with Mavis in mind and the stunning Time Waits For No One was co-written by Prince and Mavis.\n\nOn May 24, 1989, the first Paisley Park Records album by Mavis Staples was released, titled Time Waits For No One. The album contained 6 Prince compositions that were characterized by the typical Prince sound.\n\nSongs\n\nAll songs written by Prince, unless stated otherwise.\n\nInteresting\n\n20th Century Express (Homer Banks, Lester Snell)\n\nCome Home\n\nJaguar\n\nTrain\n\nThe Old Songs (Homer Banks, Lester Snell)\n\nI Guess I’m Crazy\n\nTime Waits for No One (Prince, Mavis Staples)\n\nMusicians\n\nMavis Staples – vocals, background vocals\n\nPrince – all instruments, unless stated otherwise, background vocals on Interesting, Come Home, Jaguar, Train, Time Waits For No One\n\nReview\n\nAt the time I adored the album. To me, it was the nth example that Prince was a fine composer, not just for himself but for others as well. Even though not every song was a perfect fit for Mavis Staples, the title song alone warranted the album’s purchase. It’s really that good, the pounding, yet swinging drums, paired with exquisite keyboard riffs, beautiful intense vocals by Mavis and a beautiful Prince solo: another milestone in Prince’s already impressive body of work.\n\nBut songs like Interesting, Jaguar and Train also worked fine in combination with Mavis’ beautiful weathered voice. In short: an enrichment for the Paisley Park Records label.\n\nAfter Time Waits For No One\n\nUnfortunately, the record buying public thought differently, if they even heard about the album. Mavis Staples was categorized as gospel, but this album wasn’t that. What was it then? In the US the album didn’t fit any radio format, so it didn’t receive any airplay. The press almost unanimously praised the album, some even stated it was the best Paisley Park Records had ever released. The album did help Mavis Staples’ career get back on track, so it had its benefits for Mavis, despite the disappointment of the less than stellar sales. The three singles (20th Century Express, Jaguar and Time Waits For No One) did nothing to change the outcome.\n\nMelody Cool\n\nFollowing the release of her first Paisley Park Records album, attention was geared towards the new Prince projects Batman and Graffiti Bridge. The latter would turn into the third Prince movie, which also included a soundtrack. The veterans George Clinton and Mavis Staples both got a part in the movie, where they performed their own song.\n\nClinton got the fantastic We Can Funk and Mavis received the relatively new song Melody Cool, named after her character in the movie. At first, Mavis was unsure of her movie adventure, but in the end she stated she wouldn’t mind another venture into the world of film.\n\nMelody Cool is a very catchy song that was released as a single in 1990. It made the US charts. Rightfully so, it fit Mavis perfectly, is positive and belongs to the highlights on the Graffiti Bridge album.\n\nNude\n\nIn the summer of 1990 Prince was on tour in Europe and Japan. The so-called Nude tour visited the British isles from June 19 to July 13. Prince played no less than 16 shows in Egland and 1 in Ireland. Mavis Staples was the support act for these shows. Prince was unhappy with the band that accompanied Mavis and decided to play along from backstage, enabling him to direct the band during the 30 minute set. Mavis played songs from The Staple Singers canon and from the Time Waits For No One album.\n\nAlbum: The Voice\n\nIn August 1991 work started on the successor to Time Waits For No One. One year later the recording sessions were done. Initially Prince and Mavis worked the same way, but soon they worked together intensively at Paisley Park Studios. The newly written songs House In Order, You Will Be Moved, Blood Is Thicker Than Time and The Undertaker were based on the letters Mavis had written. Prince had turned the personal accounts into lyrics. At times, Mavis was so moved while singing, she actually teared up. Mavis stated in 1997:\n\nEach one of those songs is me. That album is about the life of Mavis.\n\nBoth Melody Cool and Positivity were updated versions of the originals (respectively stemming from the Graffiti Bridge and Lovesexy albums).\n\nThe second Paisley Park Records album by Mavis Staples, The Voice, was released on August 24, 1993. Prince (co-)wrote 8 songs on the album and played on them as well, but was less prominent in his presence, in compaison to Time Waits For No One.\n\nSongs\n\nAll songs written by Prince, unless stated otherwise.\n\nThe Voice (Rosie Gaines, Prince)\n\nHouse in Order\n\nBlood Is Thicker Than Time\n\nYou Will Be Moved\n\nAll Because Of You (Billy Beck, Rick Brown)\n\nThe Undertaker (Prince, Tommy Barbarella, Michael B., Levi Seacer Jr., Sonny T.)\n\nMelody Cool\n\nKain’t Turn Back (Bernard Belle, Raymond Watkins)\n\nI’ll Be Right There (Emmanuel Rahiem LeBlanc, Gordon Williams)\n\nA Man Called Jesus\n\nWhy (Mike Ferguson, Ivan Hampden, Danny Madden, Paulette McWilliams)\n\nPositivity\n\nMusicians\n\nMavis Staples – vocals, background vocals\n\nPrince – all instruments, unless stated otherwise\n\nReview\n\nUpon buying and listening to the album in 1993, I was slightly disappointed, but time has passed my initial response by. The Voice is a fine album, one that does some real justice to Mavis Staples’ beautiful voice and generally fits Mavis better than Time Waits For No One, both musically and lyrically. The album sounds ‘more mature’, possibly resulting in my initial assessment. But, to be fair, songs like The Voice, House In Order, the gloriously bluesy The Undertaker and the house-like A Man Called Jesus are really good.\n\nThe overall message and ‘feel’ of the album is more spiritual, Mavis sings with passion and force. Highly recommended!\n\nAfter The Voice\n\nThe album produced two singles: The Voice and Blood Is Thicker Than Time. Unfortunately, the same scenario as before happened all over again. The album didn’t fit any radio format and was granted no to very little airplay. But the album also fell victim to the argument between Warner Bros. and Prince that was already peaking at the time. The Paisley Park Records label was officially closed in 1994. Following the disastrous release of Carmen Electra ‘s debut album, The Voice didn’t receive any promotion at all.\n\nThe Sacrifice Of Victor\n\nOn September 8, 1993, Prince performed at a tiny nightclub, Bagley’s Warehouse, in London. Amongst many other guests, Mavis Staples was also there. She sang The Undertaker and I’ll Take You There. The Undertaker would be released on the live video The Sacrifice Of Victor in 1995.\n\n1-800 New Funk\n\nPrince quickly founded his very own NPG Records label. In 1994 the compilation 1-800 New Funk was released, which contained the song You Will Be Moved off Mavis’ album The Voice.\n\nIn 1995 The Voice was re-released on the NPG Records label, with a different track order and complemented with Come Home (coming off Time Waits For No One).\n\nNa Prince\n\nFollowing the dissolvement of Paisley Park Records Prince and Mavis went their separate ways, but they stayed in touch, right up to his untimely death in 2016.\n\nMavis went back to work. In 1996 she released Spirituals & Gospels: A Tribute To Mahalia Jackson, which was followed by the successful Have A Little Faith in 2004 and het contribution to the That’s What I Say compilation, a tribute to Ray Charles. In 2007 she released We’ll Never Turn Back. In 2016 the live album Livin’ On A High Note was released, consisting of covers from the likes of Nick Cave and Neko Case, amongst others. Late 2017 Mavis released the album If All I Was Was Black.\n\nIn 2019 Mavis Staples turned 80 years old, an event she celebrated with a special show at The Apollo, the famous venue in Harlem, New York. She also played the English Glastonbury Festival. In 2022 Mavis’s latest album was released, Carry Me Home. To this day, Mavis still frequently goes out on tour.\n\nPrince connection\n\nOn October 23, 1999, Prince performed at his Paisley Park Studios. Mavis Staples was a guest and she sang The Undertaker (off The Voice) and two songs The Staple Singers sang back in the day: I’ll Take You There and When Will We B Paid?. Prince decided to record When Will We B Paid? and sent it to Mavis. She played the tape to her father, Pops, who was excited and pleased to hear the end result.\n\nThe very last show Prince ever played, on April 14, 2016, just one week before his untimely death, When Will We B Paid? was the opening song of the night’s setlist.\n\nIn closing\n\nPrince adored Mavis Staples until his dying day. And it was mutual. In an interview for wxpn in 2020 Mavis chose Time Waits For No One as the “Song You’re Most Proud of Working On”. That says it all.\n\nUnfortunately, both Mavis Staples Paisley Park Records albums are not available at this time, both physically as well as on streaming services. It is said that The Voice is available on Tidal, but I haven’t been able to confirm or deny that claim. Anyway, it truly is a travesty. Both albums should be readily accessible, in order for all to enjoy the splendor on Time Waits For No One and The Voice.\n\nWhat’s your take on Mavis Staples’ Prince output on Paisley Park Records?
