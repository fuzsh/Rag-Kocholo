But sometimes we hear an artist talk about a song that meant something special to them. What song do you think Prince probably played the most live? I’m sure he did Purple Rain for the fans, but was there something he consistently did simply out of enjoyment? Was there any song over the years that he said was special to him?\n\nAnother thought I had was since a lot of the unreleased material he either didn’t intend to release or he wasn’t interested in releasing in the near future, these songs weren’t played live for the purpose of promoting them. So for a few of them like Empty Room that I heard he did often (I think I remember hearing that), could it have been because he particularly liked that song?\n\nI suppose the question is 2 fold. One being about whether a song was sentimentality important to him & or was there eventually any songs that he actually got into. I’m sure any artist who’s created enough material would eventually end up foot tapping to one of their own creations simply out of enjoyment. I mean Prince made great material. Surely something got his head bobbin when no one was lookin.\n\n[Edited 12/1/22 5:04am]\n\n[Edited 12/1/22 5:05am]\n\nChuck Norris can kill two stones with one bird.\n\nJorisE73\n\nMonarch said:\n\nSo I know how this works.

The song is put at the highest echelon one could reach, as far as I'm concerned. You don't just happen to put that song title as the title to your memoir because your book was a tribute to your ex girlfriends.\n\nMaybe he called it Teh Beautiful Ones because calling it The Divine would seem a bit arrogant?\n\nExactly. ))\n\n\"The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves.
