        "text": "One of my favourite anecdotes about Prince comes from Slate’s Culture Gabfest podcast, when cohost Dana Stevens went to one of his legendary concerts. He was up on stage performing his stellar ballad “How Come U Don’t Call Me Anymore”, when, halfway through the song, he purred to his audience an ad lib on the song’s title question: “I keep asking, but you won’t tell me why.” At which point someone in the audience, seemingly overcome by the sensuality of the whole thing, yelped, “You know why!”\n\nActually, no, that’s not my favourite anecdote about Prince. My favourite one might not even be an anecdote about him at all. Years ago I went for a hook-up with a man who wouldn’t even show me his face on Grindr and who later become my first boyfriend in New York. He opened the door – 6ft 5in in heels, 7ft with his mohawk – and let me into his grimy building, manually operated his lift, and, just as I was convinced I was about to die, he showed me his penthouse apartment just north of Houston St. We sat and talked for hours, about his long career in music before moving into A&R and about how his family had always been in music. Eventually he reluctantly told me that he had a secret: a famous father whom he had never met but whom he had discovered, on a radio show, had got his mother pregnant. He told me that man was Prince – a rumour I could never confirm but did see elsewhere – and the only thing I could muster to say was “I tried to lose my virginity to his music”. Which is true: I had the playlist queued up, only for my external hard drive to stop working and so it had to be the Amélie soundtrack instead. I never got a definite answer as to whether it was true, even when I met his mother, but, let’s be honest, the fact it could be true at all is exciting enough.\n\nWhich is all to say Prince was many things. An activist, an enigmatic musical genius, a troubled figure whose mystique could sometimes seem less like artistry and more like something being deeply wrong beneath the surface. But it was his innate sensuality, his unapologetic love of himself and of pleasure for others that meant I became obsessed with him as a closeted queer kid growing up in a village in the New Forest. I didn’t listen to a broad selection of his music, but what I did listen to I consumed religiously, with a fervour few artists have ever inspired in me. When he died in 2016 I was genuinely forlorn: I felt like a flower learning they no longer had a sun to bloom towards.\n\nWhenever Prince comes into my life, it is incredibly messy and deeply erotic, and that feels like just the way he should arrive, like a sort of horny theophany. To describe him as someone who just blessed us all with a heightened sexual agency feels in some ways reductive, but we’ve also taken his birthday this year as a chance to mark his politics and his musical nous and now – the way we’ve written about how Blondie changed New Wave, Joan Baez changed folk and The Kinks changed rock – it’s time to take a look at some of the times Prince changed human sexuality for good.\n\n1. Soft And Wet (from For You)\n\nGoing back to For You, it is amazing to think this is Prince’s first album: the confidence of vision, even here, is mind-blowing. The standout has to be “Soft And Wet”, a track that can only be described as slinky. It feels too contemporary to have come out in 1978, but that’s the way it is. “Soft And Wet” could be a 2000s song by The Neptunes and you wouldn’t be able to tell. Hell, Blood Orange could have done it last week and you couldn’t tell. It is lyrically so simple, musically so plush and ultimately just one of his erotic masterpieces. “You’re just as soft as a lion tamed / You’re just as wet as the evening rain.” What else is there to say?\n\n7. Case Of U (from A Tribute To Joni Mitchell)\n\nJoni Mitchell was one of the biggest influences on Prince – and once you realise that you can hear her everywhere. Not just in the in-text references, like on “Ballad Of Dorothy Parker” or the thank you he gives her in the liner notes to Dirty Mind, but also in subtler ways: the way he uses her warbling weird chords at the start of “Purple Rain” or the Mitchell-esque melancholy of All For You’s “So Blue”. “I love all Joni’s music,” he said. “I do her songs just to keep her name out there. Joni’s music should be taught in school.” He even wrote a song for her, “Emotional Pump”, which is very good… but it’s very easy to see why she turned it down.\n\nJoni was a fan of his too. She even told New York Magazine how “Prince used to write me fan mail with all of the U’s and hearts that way that he writes. And the office took it as mail from the lunatic fringe and just tossed it”. But she was ultimately maybe not as enamoured with him as he was with her: “I don’t think Prince is an innovator,” she told New York Magazine in the same interview. “He’s a great hybrid.”\n\nLong before “Case Of U” was released on One Nite Alone in 2002, and then again under its original name on 2007’s A Tribute To Joni Mitchell, Prince was playing it during tours and concerts: his first recorded performance of it was back in 1983. But his version of “A Case Of You” truly is not just a fitting tribute to the song, a reimagining that does something different while fundamentally honouring its source material, but it truly might be one of the best covers of all time. It takes Joni’s plaintive and very earthbound experience of a relationship dissolving, cuts its biographical opening and opens on its abstract second verse: “I am a lonely painter / I live in a box of paints / I used to be frightened by the devil / And I’m drawn to those ones that ain’t.” It is less a wretched sob and more a moment of holy and erotic communion.\n\n8. When Doves Cry (from Purple Rain)\n\n“When Doves Cry” is not Prince’s most overtly sexual song, not even on Purple Rain (“Darling Nikki” should probably take that honour considering somebody masturbates in public in the first verse), but it is the album’s sexiest song. A leather-clad striptease – picture Charlotte Rampling in The Night Porter – yet lyrically it might as well be Prince sat with his therapist. It is so staggeringly raw, in a song that feels so synthetic and glam, it makes you want to mollycoddle and make love to Prince in equal measure, a powerful combination that we should probably talk to our own therapists about.\n\n13. Sexy MF (from Love Symbol)\n\nSounding almost like Parliament meets Jungle Brothers, “Sexy MF” comes after the breathless opening track of the first album to use Prince’s ineffable and infamous symbol, now usually referred to as the “Love Symbol”. Just when you think you’ve been choked for air by Prince, he goes into this: an acid trip that goes down on you like a champ. It is the culmination of Prince’s love of George Clinton’s music in all the best ways, so cool it’s camp and so camp it’s cool.\n\n14. How Come U Don’t Call Me Anymore? (from The Hits/The B-Sides)\n\nOriginally released as the B-side to “1999”, “How Come U Don’t Call Me Anymore?” might be Prince’s best ballad. There’s something about his free, off-beat blues piano in this song that sounds like he has only just managed to regain a grip on the keys seconds before climax. It is amazing to hear the master of a full, psychedelic, uptempo sex dream do something so small and yet play with its ending by using a dreamlike chorus of his own, looped vocals over the top.\n\nThe song was also performed by Alicia Keys on her stellar debut album, Songs In A Minor, and she performed it with him in some of his shows; she has always said he loved her version. Keys and Prince had such a powerful bond as artists that it was Keys who inducted Prince into the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame in 2004, where she said one of the truest things ever said about him: “There are many kings – King Henry VIII, King Solomon, King Tut, King James, King Kong, The Three Kings – but there is only one Prince.”\n\n17. Sex Shooter (from Originals)\n\nOne of the strangest phenomena in the story of Prince is the creation of his own girl band. There’s something about the whole story that, if it had a visual representation, is that gif of Chrissy Teigen gritting her teeth at the Oscars: inspired by the Streisand A Star Is Born, he decided to bring two female friends and model Denise “Vanity” Matthews into a girl group that he originally wanted to call The Hookers to sing about being a sexual fantasy. While the name changed, their music… What I want to say about Vanity 6 – and the later incarnation, Apollonia 6 – is that their music has a kind of camp stupidity and oddly thin production that means their songs are perfect for remixing and reshaping for the dance floor – and they are! But fundamentally, there’s something about their music that’s also highly uncomfortable, which might also be the reasons Vanity left the band and was replaced with Patricia “Apollonia” Kotero. In an odd twist, Matthews ended up passing just a few months before her former mentor.\n\nThis is all to say the era of Vanity and Apollonia 6 is a very odd one in the larger artistic career of Prince, though entirely in keeping with the kind of artist he was. Of the band’s two best singles – “Nasty Girl” and “Sex Shooter” – there should be some love given to Prince’s demo of the latter, released posthumously on Originals. When he sings this song of subordination and domination, it feels much more interesting than when he asks women to do it: it feels nubile and strong, raunchy and tender. Prince’s genius was his ability to write for other artists and yet, undeniably, still clearly be the writer of that material. Perhaps, in a case like this, it was better he just remain the performer too.\n\n18. Nothing Compares 2 U (from Originals)\n\nPrince first wrote this song for The Family in 1985, released on their single, eponymous album to absolutely no fanfare. It was made a huge success, of course, by Sinead O’Connor, who was… well, she wasn’t Prince’s biggest fan. “He summoned me to his house – and it’s foolish to do this to an Irish woman. He said he didn’t like me saying bad words in interviews,” she told the Irish Independent. “So I told him to fuck off. He got quite violent. I had to escape out of his house at five in the morning. He packed a bigger punch than mine.”\n\nPrince originally released his version of the song on his The Hits/The B-Sides compilation, but the original demo version, released as a single in 2018 and later on this album, has to absolutely be the definitive version of him doing it. Where Sinead O’Connor’s version is amazing for its raw sadness, this version is so deeply apocalyptic that it truly hits different: like a man whose broken heart has conspired to end the whole universe in fire and fury, the combination of economic, blues-like lyrics and dystopian production is Prince to a tee.\n\nNow read\n\n16 Donna Summer songs that changed the way we dance\n\n16 Diana Ross songs to cushion the blow of missing her Glastonbury set\n\n15 Ray Charles songs that prove he was one of the greats"
