Especially since, by the end, he's almost screaming the chorus: Strangely beautiful Beautiful strange That's what we said instead of the name If U count the times He took all the blame U would find the reason behind the game In the darkness we must look 4 the way Words so strange that only the mind can say If it makes no mind what color or holy day why is this game the only one that we play Dive inside your sould if U wanna know the light inside the darkness 4ever glows The son is like the diamond inside the coal and like an embryo it grows and grows\n\nWhat hte hell is he talkin about?\n\n\"Beautiful Strange\" seems to be a reference to Jesus. The lyrics are kinda self-ecplanatory.\n\n\"That's what we say instead of the name...\"\n\n\"If it makes no difference the color or Holy Day...\"\n\n\"The son is like the diamond inside the coal...\""
