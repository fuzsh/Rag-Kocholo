        "text": "Great jazz requires great improvisation, and Arturo Sandoval is one of the best off-the-cuff artists in the genre.\n\nOriginally from Artemisa, Cuba, the Afro-Cuban jazz trumpeter calls America home after defecting in 1989 while on a European tour with his mentor, the late jazz trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie.*\n\nSandoval was born into poverty in Cuba, but he thrived musically as a child and was playing with street musicians at the age of 12. He discovered jazz on the radio network \"Voice of America,\" a U.S. government-funded agency that plays TV and radio content in 40 languages around the world. While he was serving in the Cuban military, a sergeant caught him listening to the broadcast and he was jailed for three months.\n\nJazz festival: Oscars producer behind jazz festival celebrating music 'integral' to Palm Springs history\n\nJazz fest history: Sixty years after it was first proposed, Palm Springs International Jazz Festival finally a go\n\nOneRepublic at Pappy's: 'This is a small crowd, but it works'\n\nIn 1977, he met Gillespie during a stop-over in Havana when the older musician came ashore during a jazz cruise of the Caribbean. Sandoval was asked to drive Gillespie around, but it wasn't until they arrived at a jam session that Gillespie realized Sandoval was also a trumpet player.\n\n\"I was backstage there, warming up a little bit when Dizzy arrived,\" Sandoval said in an interview with Public Radio International. \"He said, 'What the hell is my driver doing with the trumpet!'\"\n\nShortly after arriving in the United States, Sandoval recorded his first American album titled \"Flight to Freedom.\" He began collaborating with artists like Frank Sinatra and Johnny Mathis, and he played on two of Gloria Estefan's albums.\n\nHe's won 10 Grammy Awards and earned 19 nominations. He also won an Emmy as the composer of the soundtrack for his autobiographical film, \"For Love Of Country: The Arturo Sandoval Story.\"\n\nin 2018, he released \"Ultimate Duets,\" featuring performances with Stevie Wonder, Josh Groban and Al Jarreau, as well as a track titled \"Arturo Sandoval\" with Pharrell Williams and Ariana Grande.\n\nSandoval will play the Palm Springs International Jazz Festival on Saturday, Nov. 23. He discussed collaborating with Sinatra, receiving an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Notre Dame and his life in America with The Desert Sun. The following interview was edited for length and clarity.\n\nTHE DESERT SUN: What was the most important advice Dizzy Gillespie gave you as a musician?\n\nARTURO SANDOVAL: He showed me his love and passion for music. That was the most important thing I learned from him. We owe everything to the music, and I keep that on my mind.\n\nWhat was your experience like working with Frank Sinatra?\n\nUnfortunately, I never met him in person. I just played on his track \"Luck Be A Lady.\" It was such a big honor for me. I'm so grateful that the late (producer) Phil Ramone asked me to play a solo on that track. When I did it, everything was done already. I would have loved to play with him, of course.\n\nHow did the song \"Arturo Sandoval\" with Pharrell Williams and Ariana Grande happen?\n\nI'm honored they decided to collaborate on my album. Pharrell is a friend and we've collaborated on many things before and he's been part of my song company for years. He's an incredible person and very smart. We wrote the music together and he wrote the lyrics. When we were in the studio working on the vocals, he said, \"Arturo, in the other room, I'm producing Ariana Grande. She's here tonight. What do you think about if I invite her to be on the track?\" I said, \"Wow, of course! That would be amazing.\" It's a nice track. It's a good opportunity for me to get close to the younger generation that listen to that music. I'm 70 years old and I'm not a baby anymore.\n\nThat ups your cool factor a lot.\n\nYeah, but we also had Placido Domingo, Alejandro Sanz, Celia Cruz and it was the last recording of Al Jarreau, who passed away a week after we tracked that song \"After All.\" That was very sad.\n\nYou received an honorary doctorate from the University of Notre Dame and you worked with their music department on your new Christmas album. What makes the university special to you?\n\nIt's the only university that awarded me with a Doctorate in Fine Art. It's such a privilege because it's an incredible school. I mentioned to the dean of the school that it would be nice to do a project together for a Christmas album. We did it right away. I spent a few days there recording with different performers, orchestras and choirs. It was a beautiful experience.\n\nWhy did you finally decide to do a Christmas album at this point in your career?\n\nI'm Catholic, and I've always wanted to do it. Unfortunately, I couldn't do it before, but it was always in the back of my mind.\n\nA lot of people don't seem to appreciate jazz anymore. What does it mean to you and why is it important?\n\nJazz, for me, is the ultimate expression of freedom. The most important part of jazz is improvisation. It's the freedom that a musician has to express themselves. For me, the word 'freedom' is the most important word in the dictionary. When I started in music, I started playing a little bit of Cuban music when I was a teenager. I went to school for three years just to get classical training and then jazz came later. When I had an opportunity to hear jazz music, I listened to Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker. I was blown away and couldn't believe how much I loved it.\n\nImprovisation in jazz can't be an easy thing to learn. How does one learn how to do that?\n\nThe first thing you have to do is listen to jazz music for hours and hours before you finally figure it out. This is like a language. It's something you have to feel. It's not because you read a book or got some lessons that you'll figure it out. It's deeper than that and something that comes from your soul.\n\nYou play the piano as well as the trumpet. Not many jazz musicians are known for two instruments. What does piano do for you musically?\n\nThe piano came later on after the trumpet. I don't even know how to read music for the piano. Trumpet is my main instrument and I can play different styles. But with the piano, I read a book many years ago of jazz history and one of the chapters when Miles Davis went to Dizzy Gillespie and asked him for advice on improvisation. Dizzy said, \"Ok, let's go to the piano and work on it.\" Miles asked, \"The piano?\" and Dizzy, \"Of course! That's the thing we must know, because the piano could be the best music teacher could have. Everything I ever wrote came from the piano.\" When I want to make an arrangement or composition, the piano is always the tool I use. When I write scores for movies, I use the piano all the time.\n\nAs a Cuban living in America, what cultural differences have you had to adapt to?\n\nMusic is the only international language. I was born and raised and Cuba and came here when I was 40 years old. I spent more than half my life in Cuba and the Cuban music is inside of me.\n\nIs there anything you miss from Cuba?\n\nI'm so happy in this country. I really believe I was born again when I was 40 years old. This country made me a happy person. I don't miss Cuban food because my wife is a very good cook. When I was living in Miami, that's the kind of food I had every day. I'm very sad about the whole situation in Cuba. I don't want to talk about politics, but it's very sad what's going on there. The people are desperate and frustrated. I don't suffer any kind of nostalgia. Everything that happened to me over the past 30 years, it was beyond my dreams and imagination. I'm so grateful, and I have no words to express my gratitude.\n\nAnd Barack Obama awarded you with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, one of the highest awards one could receive.\n\nI keep that very close to my heart because it's the highest distinction for a civilian in the United States. The only other jazz musicians to receive it are Ella Fitzgerald, Duke Ellington and Count Basie. To be in such company, it's a great honor.\n\nHow are you feeling about playing the first Palm Springs International Jazz Festival?\n\nWe have a second house in La Quinta and we love the desert. To play there is such a joy. I'm looking forward to it and hope people will come. I'm going to bring my own band, which I love so much. We played a sold-out show last night in Washington D.C. and we can't wait to play for the people there.\n\nDesert Sun reporter Brian Blueskye covers arts and entertainment.
