        "text": "Alwin \"Al\" Lopez Jarreau (born March 12, 1940, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States) is an American singer. A seven-time Grammy Award winner, and is the second artist in history (Michael Jackson being the first) to win in the three separate categories: Jazz, Pop, and R&B. He also won the Grammys within a span of four consecutive decades â€” the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and 2000s.\n\nJarreau was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the fifth of six children. His web site refers to Reservoir, Inc., the name of the street where he lived. His father was a Seventh-Day Adventist Church minister and singer, and his mother was a church pianist. He and his family sang together in church concerts and in benefits, and he and his mother performed at PTA meetings.\n\nHe was Student Council President and Badger Boys State delegate in high school, going on to Ripon College, where he also sang with a group called the Indigos. Al graduated in 1962 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology. He went on to earn a master's degree in Vocational Rehabilitation from the University of Iowa and worked as a Rehabilitation Counselor in San Francisco and moonlighted with a jazz trio headed by George Duke."
