He was 76.\n\nJarreau was hospitalized last week and was said to have been improving slowly. The cause of his death was not revealed, but he had experienced a number of respiratory and cardiac issues in recent years.\n\nThe Milwaukee native won seven Grammys over the course of his half-century in music. His biggest single was 1981’s “We’re in This Love Together” from the album “Breakin’ Away.”\n\nHe was also a vocalist on the all-star 1985 track, “We Are the World,” and sang the theme to TV’s “Moonlighting.”\n\nJarreau performed multiple times at the Berks Jazz Fest, including as a headliner in 2001.\n\nIn an interview with the Reading Eagle published two days before his show that year, the singer talked about the rewards of the creative process.\n\n“If you write a poem and it wasn’t there before, it’s refreshing to you,” he said. “If you see a lump of clay and two days later it’s a sculpture, it’s rejuvenating.\n\n“All that stuff puts such a fire in the belly. It’s the thing you create itself that inspires you. It makes you want to go to the spring and drink that water again.”\n\nConcord Records President John Burk issued a statement that called Jarreau one of the “most distinctive and extraordinary vocalists” in the music industry.\n\n“He was truly a force of nature and a beautiful human being that will be fondly remembered and deeply missed by us all,” Burk said.\n\nJarreau is one of the few artists to have won Grammys in three separate categories – jazz, pop and R&B.\n\nNews of Jarreau’s death came as the Grammy Awards were kicking off in Los Angeles.\n\n“He was really one of the most creative vocalists who ever lived,” jazz singer Tierney Sutton told The Associated Press on the red carpet. “His voice was like an instrument.”\n\nSutton collaborated with Jarreau on the Joni Mitchell tribute album “After Blue” from 2013.\n\nTributes poured in on social media in remembrance of Jarreau as well. Director Ava DuVernay tweeted that her mom used to play Jarreau’s vinyl and that his voice made her happy.\n\nActress Octavia Spencer wrote that Jarreau “had a mellifluous voice. Soothing. Beautiful.”\n\nMusician and producer Robert Glasper said that Jarreau was one of his first major jazz influences. “He did it his way,” Glasper said.\n\nIn a 2014 interview with The Arizona Republic, Jarreau relished in his crossover tendencies.\n\n“I grew up in Milwaukee, and I took it all in,” he said. “I want it all. Don’t cut me off at the pass and say I can’t listen to Muddy Waters because I’m a jazzer. Or I can’t listen to Garth Brooks because I’m a jazzer. Get out of here,” he said.\n\nMusic wasn’t always Jarreau’s focus, however – he didn’t even record his first album until he was 35.\n\nBorn to a minister father and a mother who played the piano in church, Jarreau sang from an early age, but he was also an athlete who earned a master’s in vocal rehabilitation and started his career as a counselor in San Francisco, playing jazz on the side.\n\nBut he couldn’t ignore his passion for performance and eventually gave up his first career to do music full time.\n\n“His second priority in life was music. There was no third,” read the statement on Jarreau’s website. “His first priority, far ahead of the other, was healing or comforting anyone in need.”\n\nHis final album, “My Old Friend: Celebrating George Duke,” was released in 2014.\n\nIn 2011, Jarreau appeared with the George Duke Trio at the Berks Jazz Fest.\n\nJarreau is survived by his wife, Susan, and a son, Ryan.\n\n(The Reading Eagle contributed to this story.)\n\nOriginally Published: February 12, 2017 at 3:00 p.m."
