        "text": "At its meeting on Monday, Milwaukee’s Common Council unanimously adopted a resolution to rename the Cawker Play Area at 2929 N. 30th St. in the Amani neighborhood Alwin Lopez (Al) Jarreau Park.\n\nThe move was co-sponsored by all the members of the council and now just needs a signature from Mayor Cavalier Johnson.\n\nSinger Al Jarreau was born in Milwaukee in 1940 and graduated from Lincoln High School before going on to a career during which he earned six Grammy Awards and 19 nominations.\n\nJarreau died in Los Angeles in 2017 at the age of 76.\n\n“Al Jarreau was a brilliant and extremely influential artist in the genres of jazz and R&B, but so many Milwaukee residents are unaware of how important this city was to him, or that he even came from Milwaukee,” said Ald. Khalif Rainey, in whose 7th Aldermanic district the park is located.\n\n“That’s why I’m glad that this renaming file was adopted and we can honor a man who made great strides with his music and always cherished his home city. I hope that this will promote his legacy and provide an example for our children to aspire to.”\n\nThe park had previously been named for nearby Cawker Place, which was, in turn, named for Emanuel Cawker, who owned and subdivided the land in the area, which is known as Cawker’s Subdivision.\n\nThe park, which has a playset, swings and basketball courts, is adjacent to the Milwaukee Fire Department’s Engine 13 quarters.\n\nArtist Tia Richardson designed new fence and basketball court murals for the park, based on ideas collected from neighborhood residents, who were also recruited to help paint the first mural last month.\n\n“The input provided by area residents for these murals was greatly appreciated,” said Rainey at the time. “The more people we can have involved the better as we aim to complete this true community-driven\n\nProject.”"
