        "text": "His death was announced by his manager, Joe Gordon, who said Jarreau had been hospitalized for exhaustion two weeks ago.\n\nA preacher’s son, Jarreau started singing in public as a boy but did not begin a full-time musical career until the late 1960s, when he was nearly 30. Before that, he had worked as a psychologist and rehabilitation counselor.\n\nBy the 1970s he had became a widely popular jazz singer, touring extensively and appearing often on television. Critics praised his supple voice, his improvisational skill and, in particular, his virtuosic ability to produce an array of vocalizations, ranging from delicious nonsense to clicks and growls to quasi-instrumental sounds.\n\nOver time, Jarreau’s work — both his singing and his original compositions — came to incorporate elements of pop, folk, soul, gospel, rhythm and blues and Latin music. The result was a highly accessible, intensely personal and commercially successful style that defied easy genre classification, though some jazz purists derided it as fusion or, worse still, smooth jazz.\n\nWriting in The New York Times in 1981, Stephen Holden reviewed a concert by Jarreau at the Savoy in New York. The review encapsulated both the pros and the cons of his singular style:\n\n“Al Jarreau may be the most technically gifted singer working in jazz-fusion today,” Holden wrote. Of the evening’s performance, however, he continued: “Mr. Jarreau’s concert lacked the emotional range of great jazz. He is such a prodigious talent that the absence of even the slightest blues inflections kept his music from cutting deeply.”\n\nJarreau released more than 20 albums. He won seven Grammy Awards, and it was a mark of his eclecticism that they spanned three different categories: jazz, pop and R&B.\n\nAlwin Lopez Jarreau was born in Milwaukee on March 12, 1940. His father, a minister, was a fine singer; his mother played the piano in church.\n\nJarreau’s first marriage, to Phyllis Hall, ended in divorce.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, the former Susan Player; a son, Ryan; two brothers, Marshall and Appie; and a sister, Rose Marie Freeman."
