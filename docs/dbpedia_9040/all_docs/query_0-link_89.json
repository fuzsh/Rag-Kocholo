        "text": "Al Jarreau: Love Songs\n\nBorn Alwin Lopez Jarreau on March 12, 1940, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, legendary singer, song-writer, and musician, Al Jarreau, had a voice like no other. Several years ago, I saw him as the main attraction at the Indianapolis Jazz Festival. Although, I was seated far from the stage and could barely see him, there was no mistaking his unique voice. Nicknamed the “Acrobat of Scat,” he had an innovative vocal styling. This vocalist was one of the few performers of his day, who bridged pop, jazz, and rhythm and blues; he won numerous Grammy Awards in these three categories. No one could take a song and blend jazz and soul with soft pop and hints of gospel the way he could.

This is a way to give oneself a pick me up. “Black and Blues” (1983) is more of a story. It is an expression for the bruises that he had. First, he is alone and bruised. Then, he finds a neighbor, and they both find a solace and healing in having each other as friends. Jarreau’s songs were written when I was a young adult, coming of age. I was finding my voice, place in the world, and his music helped me do these. His music included themes such as: faith, love, hope, healing, and promise. Thus, his music became standard for listeners, showing his love of humanity, and he found a way to help them in his own"
