        "text": "Though this Milwaukee alternative/hip hop outfit didn't enjoy a very long shelf life, its 1999 top-25 hit \"Better Days (And the Bottom Drops Out)\" is still celebrated as one of the better one-hit wonder moments of the 1990s. Of course, those from the city of Milwaukee continue to praise Citizen King as one of the most innovative local acts of all time. And, truly at its best when experiencing a Citizen King live show. The band put out two studio albums and two EPs, but was never able to sustain that late 1990s success.\n\nThose from the area known that the local Milwaukee rock scene is rather underrated. Over the decades, a hefty amount of quality, hard rock, punk, metal and alternative acts have enjoyed various levels of success. Die Kreuzen was actually formed over the border in Rockford, Ill., during the early 1980s, but relocated to Milwaukee were it earned fame as one of the great heavy rock bands to call the city home. More popular groups and artists such as Napalm Death, Voivod, and Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore have cited Die Kreuzen among their influences.\n\nSeattle might the recognized home of the grunge movement, but Madison's Killdozer, a label mate of Die Kreuzen, has often been credit with helping usher that sound into prominence. Notably because it had a fan in Kurt Cobain and worked with legendary late producer Steve Albini. With its blend of an alternative and post-hardcore sound, guided by the growling voice of frontman/guitarist Michael Gerald, Killdozer put out six studio albums from 1984-1995. However, the group might be best known for its cover of Don McLean's \"American Pie\".\n\nBrothers Jimmy and Dennis Flemion formed what eventually became The Frogs in Milwaukee in 1980. This might be the epitome of the cult classic band — if there's such a thing. What started as a pop rock band grew into an alternative act known for its catchy hooks and controversial lyrics on such topics as race and sex. However, for The Frogs, their legacy has been built around who they has influenced. Billy Corgan, Kurt Cobain, Eddie Vedder and Beck, just to name a few, considered The Frogs instrumental in the sound of their own bands. In fact, the Flemions worked with Smashing Pumpkins and Dennis Flemion inspired the Pearl Jam song \"Smile.\"\n\nBorn in Milwaukee, the famed frontman from Arrested Development spent time growing up between the city and the state of Tennessee. He attended Milwaukee's King High school as well as the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. While he's best known for his work with that popular progressive hip hop outfit, \"Speech\" has long been active as a solo artist, putting out eight such albums — most recently in 2020. He's also an accomplished DJ.\n\nFrom Milwaukee, The Promise Ring has long been considered one of the most influential bands within the emo genre of rock. Notably the second wave of emo, which essentially re-introduced the musical movement to a somewhat new generation of pop-punk/alternative fans during the 1990s. Nothing Feels Good was the band's second studio album, and is far more catchy and accessible, complete with a bevy of infectious hooks, than its lauded debut 30° Everywhere (1996).\n\nGrey (or by her given name Holly Brook Hafermann) signed her first publishing deal at just 17 years old. From there, the Madison-area native has more than proved her worth as a pop/hip hop singer, songwriter and producer. She co-wrote Eminem's 2010 single \"Love the Way You Lie.\" She's also worked with fellow music heavyweights like Dr. Dre and Nicki Minaj, and written songs for Alicia Keys, Ciara, Christina Aguilera and Céline Dion, among others. Grey's own 2021 single \"Last One Standing\" enjoyed some modest success on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nThe pride of Sheboygan, this popular female pop vocal quartet was formed in 1946 and remained active until the early 1960s. Known for timeless 1950s classics \"Mr. Sandman\" and \"Lollipop,\" The Chordettes featured as many as nine different members during the group's run, but Janet Ertel Bleyer, Alice MaeBuschmann, Dottie Schwartz and Jinny Osborn made up the original lineup. The group also appeared on the first ABC national broadcast of American Bandstand on August 5, 1957.\n\nTo casual music fans, Hatfield might be best known as the \"other guy\" in the Righteous Brothers. Yes, Hatfield might have played second fiddle most of the time to deep-voiced crooner Bill Medley in the duo, but his tenor work is simply legendary. Hatfield was also the principal vocalist on its 1965 version of \"Unchained Melody.\" Hatfield grew up in Southern California, but was born in Beaver Dam, Wis., located roughly 66 miles northwest of Milwaukee.\n\nA four-time Grammy Award nominee, Benét was born in Mobile, Alabama, but grew up in Milwaukee (yes, we're taking some liberties with this one), where his love of music was established. A versatile entertainer, Benét, who has also made a name for himself as a prominent pop and R&B songwriter, made a name for himself in the early 2000s with the single \"Spend My Life With You\" (featuring Tamia), which reached No. 1 on the Billboard R&B charts in United States. Formerly married to Halle Berry, Benét also enjoyed success with hits \"You're the Only One\" and \"Sometimes I Cry.\"\n\nJustin Turner's indie folk sound with Bon Iver might be heavily influenced by New Jersey legend Bruce Springsteen, but the idea of the band came about while he isolated himself in a western Wisconsin cabin in the mid-2000s. The Eau Claire native intended Bon Iver to be solo project, but it blossomed into a band. Bon Iver's self-titled second album from 2011 won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative album. As of 2024, the group has been nominated for 10 Grammys. Like The Boss, Vernon is a storyteller at heart and gets into his character and lyrics as much as the music.\n\nHailing from the town of Mount Calvary, in Fond du Lac County, Smith has long been considered one of the great female drummers of all time. Her career behind the kit spanned from the 1920s into the 1970s. Though perhaps most heralded for her work in swing and orchestral music settings, Smith also showed off her talent in films and on Broadway in the production of Cabaret. She appeared multiple times on The Ed Sullivan Show.\n\nConsider this a two-fer of sorts. Madison, Wis., has long been an underrated haven for alternative music production. Thanks in part to Vig, who was born in western Wisconsin, but became synonymous with the Madison music scene both as a musician (drummer) and prominent producer. He produced Nirvana's groundbreaking Nevermind (1991) album and the Smashing Pumpkins' Siamese Dream (1993). As a musician, Vig is best known for drumming with Madison-based alternative rock/electronica favorites Garbage, which featured Scotland's Shirley Manson and was nominated for six Grammy Awards from 1997-2000.\n\nHailing from Waukesha, a mere minutes from Milwaukee, the BoDeans are another band that quickly comes to mind when talking about the Wisconsin music scene. The alternative rock band with a mainstream folksy vibe enjoyed major success via 1991's Black and White. The BoDeans' fourth studio album was on heavy rotation in college dorms and frat houses throughout the Midwest right into the middle part of the 1990s. Thanks to the single \"Good Things,\" which, perhaps, is the most well-known song from the group that has enjoyed a devoted following for decades. Though the top-20 hit \"Closer to Free,\" which served as the opening song to the Fox hit Party of Five, is quite popular as well.\n\nAnother Milwaukee native, Herman was one of the most versatile musicians of the 1930s. He enjoyed a legendary career playing jazz on the clarinet, saxophone and singing. He was also a prominent big-band leader (notably guiding The Herds), and remained active into the mid-to-late 1980s. Herman was a three-time Grammy Award winner and remains heralded and praised by the city where it all began. When it comes to overall musicianship, there aren't many better than Mr. Herman.\n\nMiller might have cut his teeth as a guitarist in Dallas and Chicago, or formed his famous band in the San Francisco Bay Area. However, it all began in Milwaukee. That's where Miller was introduced to music, particularly jazz, by his parents, who happened to be good friends with one of the most iconic names in the history of music — the guitar, more specifically (more on that in a bit). A member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Miller is a legend in his own right, both as the leader of the Steve Miller Band and one of the great rock and blues guitarists.\n\nBorn Władziu Valentino Liberace in West Milwaukee in 1919, the man simply known as Liberace would go on to become one of the most famous entertainers in the world. Over-the-top, flamboyant, flashy, Liberace was larger than life, whether playing piano or acting or simply living his life of fame and indulgence. From the 1950s to '70s, Liberace was on top of the entertainment world. He produced six gold albums, was a fixture in Las Vegas and even won a pair of Emmy Awards. Liberace also happened to be quite the controversial figure for his lifestyle off the stage.\n\nIt would be not be a stretch to label the Femmes as beloved in the state of Wisconsin. The pride of Milwaukee, the Femmes are responsible for such sing-a-long folk punk-alternative rock favorites like \"Blister in the Sun,\" \"Add it Up,\" American Music,\" \"Kiss Off,\" and \"Gone Daddy Gone.\" The band's self-titled 1982 album is arguably one of the great rock debuts. However, the band's loyal following always seemed somewhat limited to the Midwest. Perhaps that's what makes the group so appealing. Genuinely alternative.\n\nA product of Milwaukee's Lincoln High School, and eventually tiny Ripon College, Jarreau was a masterful in the pop/R&B landscape of the late 1970s and into the 1980s. His 1981 highly acclaimed Breakin' Away album spent two years on the charts and peaked at No. 9 on the Billboard 200 in the United States. By that time, Jarreau was already a three-time Grammy Award winner. In total, Jarreau won 11 Grammys and was also featured on the iconic USA for Africa \"We Are the World\" project. Fun fact: Jarreau also performed the theme song for the popular 1980s series Moonlighting.\n\nWe touched on that close friend of Steve Miller's family. That would be Les Paul, the Waukesha native who happens to be Miller's godfather. And, essentially the guy who influenced Miller to pick up a guitar. A self-taught guitarist, Paul played everything from country to blues to jazz. He opened the door for the creation of a solid-body electric guitar, which as time went on, bore his name through the Gibson company. When it comes to music legends, innovators and trendsetters, Paul is up there with Elvis or Chuck Berry. A legend and icon in every sense of the words."
