        "text": "LOS ANGELES - Grammy-winning jazz singer Al Jarreau, who transcended genres over a 50-year career, died at a Los Angeles hospital Sunday, just days after announcing his retirement from touring because of exhaustion, his manager Joe Gordon confirmed.\n\nHis official Twitter account says he died surrounded by his wife, son and a few other family members and friends. He was 76.\n\nJarreau was hospitalized earlier in the week and was said to have been improving slowly. The cause of his death was not revealed, but he had experienced a number of respiratory and cardiac issues in recent years.\n\nThe Milwaukee native won seven Grammys over his half-century in music. His biggest single was 1981’s “We’re in This Love Together.” Jarreau also a vocalist on the all-star 1985 track, “We Are the World,” and sang the theme to TV’s “Moonlighting.”\n\n“We feel very fortunate to have worked with Al, one of the most distinctive and extraordinary vocalists in the music,” said Concord Records President John Burk in a statement.\n\n“He was truly a force of nature and a beautiful human being that will be fondly remembered and deeply missed by us all.”\n\nJarreau is one of the few artists to have won Grammys in three separate categories - jazz, pop and R&B. Time Magazine once called him the “greatest jazz singer alive.”\n\nNews of Jarreau’s death came as the Grammy Awards were kicking off in Los Angeles.\n\n“He was really one of the most creative vocalists who ever lived,” jazz singer Tierney Sutton told the Associated Press on the red carpet.\n\n“His voice was like an instrument.”\n\nSutton collaborated with Jarreau on the Joni Mitchell tribute album “After Blue” from 2013.\n\nActress Octavia Spencer wrote that Jarreau “had a mellifluous voice. Soothing. Beautiful.”\n\nSinger Chaka Khan tweeted that he was an “unrivaled improvisational genius.”\n\nHis final album, “My Old Friend: Celebrating George Duke,” was released in 2014.Jarreau is survived by his wife, Susan, and a son, Ryan."
