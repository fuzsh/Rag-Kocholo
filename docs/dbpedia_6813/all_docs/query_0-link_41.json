        "text": "The new film by Sam Mendes, Golden Globes ‘Best Director’ winner, is an homage to his grandfather. Jake Kerridge reports\n\nWhen Sam Mendes collected the Golden Globe for Best Director for 1917, he dedicated the award to his Trinidadian grandfather, Alfred. “He signed up for the First World War, he was aged 17. And I hope he’s looking down on us. And I fervently hope it never, ever happens again.”\n\nThe film is an act of homage to Alfred. In The Autobiography of Alfred H Mendes 1897–1991 (written in the Seventies but published posthumously), Alfred described how his war stories kept “my grand- and great-grandchildren enthralled for nights on end” – one of whom was the young Sam.\n\n1917 is not a direct account of Alfred’s experiences, but this audacious epic about two young Tommies trying to prevent a German ambush is inspired by him. “I had a story that was a fragment told to me by my grandfather… It’s the story of a messenger who has a message to carry,” Sam Mendes said recently. “It lodged with me as a child, this story, or this fragment, and obviously I’ve enlarged it and changed it significantly. But it has that at its core.”\n\nAs the film brings Alfred Mendes to public notice, it is to be hoped that a revival of interest in his work as a writer will result. When he died in 1991, aged 93, he was best remembered as an efficient administrator in Trinidad’s Port Services Department, but long before he joined the civil service he had been a literary pioneer: the first West Indian novelist to be published in Britain.\n\nBorn into a Portuguese Creole family in 1897, he was fascinated by English literature from an early age. In 1912, he persuaded his father to send him to Hitchin Grammar School in Hertfordshire, where he fell in love with cricket – reluctantly, as he believed the export of the game to have been a key component in the success of the British Imperial project – and writing.\n\nIn 1915 he enlisted, to the astonishment and anger of his father, and served for two years in Flanders with the 1st Rifle Brigade. Trying to account for why he wanted to fight in a war that was none of his business, he said years later that it was because of “my insatiable curiosity. History had proved war to be a fact of life, therefore I must savour it. And always at the back of my mind lurked the suspicion that in order to write novels one must live.”\n\nIt was as a runner during the British assault on Poelcappelle in October 1917 that Mendes earned the Military Medal, carrying vital messages between the companies of his battalion and the Advanced Report Centre. Having volunteered for this assignment in spite of his commanding officer’s bald admission that “there may be no return”, Mendes scurried around in search of the shell holes where the other companies might be holed up. In the words of his Military Medal citation: “For the whole of these two days he was continually on the move.”\n\nSomehow, the snipers didn’t get him: “I came to the comforting conclusion that they were so nonplussed at seeing a lone man wandering in circles about no-man’s-land… that they decided, out of perhaps a secret admiration for my nonchalance, to dispatch their bullets safely out of my way; or they may have thought me plain crazy.”\n\n1917 conveys the same sense of the unspeakable horror in the trenches that is present in Alfred’s autobiography. He vividly recalls the gas attack that resulted in his being invalided back to England: “I heard the screams of men who, wounded, were ripping the masks off their faces in the fancied hope of relief. Instead, they inhaled the gas and quietly fell to the floor of the trench in their last agony.”\n\nAfter recuperating he returned to Trinidad, where he worked in his father’s general store, and began to write fiction about the people and places he encountered. When Aldous Huxley – “tall as a beanstalk and as lean” – visited Trinidad, he befriended Mendes and arranged the publication in Britain of his novel Pitch Lake, the story of a shopkeeper’s son and his awkward attempts to fit in with the higher echelons of Portuguese society in Port of Spain.\n\nWhereas, Huxley noted in his introduction to the book, previous novels about the West Indies had been written by “colonial administrators with a gift of the gab, above all by European and American novelists on their winter holiday”, here was something authentic.\n\nMendes later moved to New York, where he continued to write. He accepted an offer to spend several months working in the Empire State Building, preparing the brochure for the 1939 World’s Fair, later recalling “I would have one secretary and five typists (how I hoped they would be unattractive, and nearly said so).”\n\nThe typists had to be unattractive because, as Mendes put it, “Like all men of romantic temperament, I was highly susceptible to women, especially the promise of those unknown.” (“He was still the same at 80,” Sam Mendes once told an interviewer.) He was thrice married, with many girlfriends.\n\nOn one occasion the disgruntled father of an 18-year-old white girl who the married 33-year-old Mendes had been romancing “wandered all over Port of Spain searching for me with a pistol in his pocket… I avoided him like the plague: after so many narrow escapes from bullets on the battlefields of Flanders and France, the prospect of dying from a bullet wound in peaceful Trinidad was unacceptable.”\n\nHe worked this relationship into a novel but did not publish it; in fact his published output comprised only two novels, as well as short stories and journalism. The trouble was that his work relied heavily on real people and events. In 1932 he had written a short story drawing heavily on the “undisciplined” life of one of his father’s employees, and the man successfully sued him (“his affianced girlfriend, reading it, had broken off the engagement, and he had been held up to ridicule by all his friends”).\n\nIn New York in 1940, plagued by money worries and with a new young son (Sam’s father, Jameson Peter Mendes), Alfred burned the manuscripts of seven unpublished novels and returned to work for his father in Trinidad. He later enjoyed success in the civil service and in business, but abandoned the writing of fiction.\n\nBut although the body of work he leaves behind is small, it is truly impressive in its sparkling evocation of ordinary life in the West Indies, the way in which it is simultaneously laid-back and dynamic.\n\nAnd as a bonus there is his autobiography, which, with its understated approach to the battles he fought both in the war and in his love life, is both deeply affecting and joyously entertaining. It was a unique life, and when he died, his son Stephen paid tribute to him at his funeral as somebody who “made his mark on life, more so than life leaving its mark on him”."
