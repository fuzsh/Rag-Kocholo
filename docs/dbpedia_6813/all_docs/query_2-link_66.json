        "text": "Screen-Shot-2019-04-02-at-12.53.44-PM\n\nWhat’s the best year in cinema? It’s a question that is bound to launch heated debates among cinephiles, and yet it’s hard to deny 1999 is a standout 12 months in the history of the movies. Two decades later, many of the films released in 1999 remain game-changers for cinema (see “The Matrix”) or represent the best work from iconic directors. Click through the gallery for the 23 films that made up a landmark year at the movies.\n\n“Fight Club”\n\nDavid Fincher’s in-your-face adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk’s novel of the same name was a box office bomb in 1999, grossing $37 million in the U.S. opposite a $63 million budget. Starring Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, the film gained cult status over the next decade and has since become one of Fincher’s most defining works.\n\n“Magnolia”\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson followed the breakthrough success of “Boogie Nights” with a far more ambitious and challenging directorial effort: “Magnolia.” The sprawling mosaic featured 1999’s most star-studded ensemble cast (Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman, John C. Reilly, Tom Cruise, etc.) and won the Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival.\n\n“The Matrix”\n\nLilly and Lana Wachowski ushered in a new era of visual effects filmmaking with the release of “The Matrix,” which launched a lucrative new franchise for Warner Bros. and introduced “bullet time” to millions of moviegoers across the world.\n\n“Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace”\n\nThe return of “Star Wars” was easily the biggest cinematic event of 1999.” George Lucas kicked off his Anakin Skywalker trilogy to the tune of $1 billion dollars worldwide, making it the third highest grossing movie ever released at the time.\n\n“10 Things I Hate About You”\n\n1999 marked a banner year for high school movies and none were as widely accessible as “10 Things I Hate About You.” The modern take on Shakespeare’s “The Taming of the Shrew” made instant stars out of Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger and continues to be one of the most beloved and quoted teen rom-coms ever released.\n\n“Eyes Wide Shut”\n\n“Eyes Wide Shut” captured the pop culture zeitgeist in 1999 as it marked Stanley Kubrick’s last movie (he died just days after submitting the final cut to Warner Bros.) and paired Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman on screen in the midst of their star-powered marriage. Like most Kubrick films, “Eyes Wide Shut” confounded audiences upon its release but has since become regarded as one of his defining masterworks.\n\n“Office Space”\n\nMike Judge’s “Office Space” was a box office bomb when it opened in February 1999, but its lovable cast (Ron Livingston, Jennifer Aniston, Stephen Root, Gary Role) and quotable dialogue (“I believe you have my stapler”) turned it into a cult classic that continues to speak to the hearts of disgruntled employees everywhere.\n\n“South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut”\n\nThe same year Pixar was perfecting its brand with the release of “Toy Story 2,” Paramount stuck a giant middle finger to the animation genre with the release of Trey Parker and Matt Stone’s “South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut.” While it courted controversy from political and religious groups, the movie earned $80 million worldwide and scored an Oscar nomination for Best Original Song.\n\n“Boys Don’t Cry”\n\nHilary Swank delivered one of 1999’s most defining performances in “Boys Don’t Cry,” which won the actress her first Oscar the following year. Co-written and directed by Kimberly Peirce, the film was a huge financial win for Fox Searchlight, grossing $20 million worldwide opposite a $2 million production budget.\n\n“Election”\n\nAlexander Payne earned an Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay thanks to his razor sharp black comedy “Election,” which was one of the biggest critical favorites of 1999. With Reese Witherspoon’s determined and sweetly ruthless Tracy Flick, Payne also delivered one of the year’s most defining movie characters.\n\n“The Blair Witch Project”\n\n“The Blair Witch Project” was perhaps the buzziest sensation of 1999, grossing just over $248 million worldwide on a $60,000 budget to become one of the most profitable theatrical releases in movie history. The horror film dominated film buzz for nearly the entire year thanks to a January premiere at Sundance and a July theatrical release, plus the internet turning it into a is-it-real-or-is-it-fake viral legend.\n\n“The Sixth Sense”\n\nHorror’s banner year continued with “The Sixth Sense,” the Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment supernatural chiller which made a household name out of M. Night Shyamalan and gave cinema one of its most classic twist endings. The movie became the rare genre film to break through at the Oscars, earning nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, and four other categories.\n\n“The Virgin Suicides”\n\nParamount Classics may have waited until 2000 to release Sofia Coppola’s directorial debut “The Virgin Suicides” in theaters, but 1999 was the year it world premiered at Cannes in the Directors’ Fortnight competition. Starring Kirsten Dunst and Josh Hartnett, “Virgin Suicides” turned Coppola into one of the most exciting new directors on the international film stage.\n\n“The Best Man”\n\nMalcolm D. Lee broke onto the filmmaking scene with his beloved 1999 comedy “The Best Man,” starring Sanaa Lathan, Taye Diggs, Terence Howard, Regina Hall, and more. The movie made nearly four times its $9 million budget, reminding Hollywood just before the turn of the century how much audiences crave inclusive storytelling.\n\n“The Iron Giant”\n\nBrad Bird delivered an animated movie classic in 1999 with “The Iron Giant,” although most families missed it in theaters as it bombed at the box office with just $31 million worldwide against a budget in the $70 million range. Regardless, critics fell hard for the story of a loner and his robot friend and the film put Bird on the map as one of the best new storytellers in Hollywood. The director would go on to make some of Pixar’s biggest hits, including “The Incredibles.”\n\n“American Pie”\n\nWith $235 million worldwide, “American Pie” became one of the defining R-rated comedies of the 1990s when it opened in theaters July 1999. “Pie,” bolstered by its breakout cast and crude humor, also launched a successful new franchise for Universal Pictures.\n\n“All About My Mother”\n\nOne of 1999’s defining foreign titles was Pedro Almodóvar’s “All About My Mother,” which debuted at the Cannes Film Festival and would go on to win the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film the next year.\n\n“Galaxy Quest”\n\nYet another cult classic was born in 1999 with the release of “Galaxy Quest,” Dean Parisot’s meta science-fiction comedy about a “Star Trek”-inspired group of actors who find themselves on a real alien adventure. Casting Sigourney Weaver to riff on her “Alien” legacy was instrumental to the film’s success, as was a comedic masterclass by the late Alan Rickman playing an actor playing an alien in the midst of a space odyssey.\n\n“Being John Malkovich”\n\nOne of the best debut features of 1999, “Being John Malkovich” announced Spike Jonze as one of the most promising and wholly original new American directors. The meta comedy doubled its $13 million budget at the box office and picked up three Oscar nominations: Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actress for Catherine Keener.\n\n“American Beauty”\n\nSam Mendes’ “American Beauty” was the critical darling of 1999, winning the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor (Kevin Spacey) the following year and becoming the rare adult drama to earn huge box office numbers ($356 million worldwide on a $15 million budget is mighty impressive)."
