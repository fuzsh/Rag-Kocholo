        "text": "We've all complained about it at one time or another: another Hollywood remake, another sequel, another predictable and formulaic story, or worse, plotholes you can drive a semi through! \"No one in that position would ever...\" What? Run in heels? Split up in a scary situation? Ask \"what do we do now?\" or make an asinine decision based solely on being \"pure of heart.\" We've all been there too many times to count. So, what's the solution? Start making your OWN movies! Tell YOUR stories! It's easier than you think: https://lnkd.in/gEWEB5pq\n\nüé• Record-Breaking Trailer üé• The Deadpool & Wolverine trailer alone has achieved something no other MCU film has managed. It has more F-bombs (and swear words in general) than all previous MCU movies combined! ü§Ø In this 2-minute and 39-second teaser, there are no less than six uncensored F-bombs dropped. And that‚Äôs not even counting other colorful language! ü§¨ Notably, the first F-bomb wasn‚Äôt even heard in an MCU movie until 2023‚Äôs Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. Star Chris Pratt and director James Gunn revealed that the line was improvised and wasn‚Äôt guaranteed to make the final cut. But it opened the door for Deadpool & Wolverine to go all out with its vulgarity. ü§≠ The trailer is just a small taste of the R-rated content awaiting fans in the full film. Brace yourselves for more profanity, humor, and action when Deadpool and Wolverine team up against a multiversal threat! üöÄ Fun Fact: The first real look at Hugh Jackman back in action as Wolverine is already breaking records. It‚Äôs a wild ride, and fans can‚Äôt wait for the movie‚Äôs release on July 26, 2024! üé¨ #Deadpool #Marvel #Wolverine #RyanReynolds #HughJackman #Superhero #MCU #MovieMagic #ActionComedy #TeamUp Join the hype train, fellow mutants! ü§òüî•\n\nGreetings! DEADPOOL & WOLVERINE continued to sizzle in theatres, bringing in an additional $97M in its second weekend. The Marvel superhero sequel has grossed $395M in its first 10 days, making it the second highest earning movie of 2024 behind Pixar‚Äôs INSIDE OUT 2 which has earned $627M since its June 14th opening. In fact, the R-rated DEADPOOL & WOLVERINE has earned more than the PG-rated INSIDE OUT 2 had at the same point in its release. The two films have anchored the summer box office, beginning on 6/11 with INSIDE OUT 2 and continuing through 7/26 with DEADPOOL & WOLVERINE. Sprinkle in a little DESPICABLE ME 4 on 7/3 and TWISTERS on 7/19 and the summer of 2024 has turned into quite a tasty dish for exhibitors. Get all the details with Dick Walsh‚Äôs Weekend Review. You will also enjoy reading our critic‚Äôs review of TRAP, the new psychological thriller by director M. Night Shyamalan and the biggest new opener of the weekend. Our Don‚Äôt Kill the Messenger podcast this week features a discussion with Ben Mankiewicz, the host of Turner Classic Movies, who joins host Kevin Goetz to discuss his favorite movie classics and the experience of growing up in a legendary Hollywood family. #deadpoolandwolverine #deadpool&wolverine #marvelstudios #disney #trapmovie #mnightshyamalan #insideout2 #twistersmovie #despicableme4 #benmankiewicz #turnermovieclassics #dontkillthemessenger #kevingoetz #boxoffice #boxofficeresults #screendollars\n\nGreetings!

In fact, its opening marked the worst Memorial Day weekend box office in 30 years. Read any of the press coverage, and you'll be led to believe that this is a movie industry problem. It's not. I wanted to go see the new Mad Max film on Memorial Day weekend. I loved the last Mad Max film, I think the world of Anya Taylor-Joy, and this film is getting respectable reviews. So why didn't I go see it? Because I was at home watching homemade Minecraft videos on YouTube with a 6-year old. Which illustrates three points: 1) Movies are competing for attention with other mediums that aren't movies. 2) Movies aren't just competing for attention against big budget production houses; they're also competing against everyday people who create low-budget content. 3) Movies aren't just competing against new content for attention. They're also competing against the archives. (Minecraft is 15 years old!) The media thinks in media verticals, so it labels Furiosa's failure as a \"movie industry\" problem. But it's not a movie industry problem, just like it's not a radio industry problem, a TV industry problem, a podcasting problem, a newspaper problem, or a journalism problem. It's a media industry problem. There's too much content out there. We're going to need to find something else to monetize. #mediaindustry #communitybuilding\n\nWith the Rocky statue in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where the movie was shot! I asked him the secret of success and endurance! And he told me! Soon in video!! And the story of Rocky as a fictional figure and of Stallone in real life is an example and inspiration to adopt perseverance and endurance under any circumstances and to never give up and fight \"one more round\"! There is also a very good documentary on Netflix about Stallone's life called \"Sly\"! Keep fighting!!! #onemoreround#neverquit#sly#AdaptAndFly#\n\nTHEY‚ÄôRE HERE... üè† Legendary California home hits the market for the first time in 45 years! üé¨ It‚Äôs night. A quiet street in California. Inside a seemingly ordinary house, a little girl quietly crawls towards a flickering TV screen and whispers words that still send chills down our spines: ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre here...‚Äù Yes, this is the house from the cult classic \"Poltergeist\" (1982). This home, located at 4267 Roxbury St. in Simi Valley, was personally chosen by Steven Spielberg during filming. He wanted the horrors to unfold in a familiar, everyday setting, and this house was the perfect fit. üè° During filming, the entire neighborhood was engulfed in true mystique: artificial corpses scattered around, movie hearses lining the streets ‚Äî the neighbors never knew what to expect next. And inside this house, scenes were shot that would go down in cinema history. Now, 45 years later, this house is back on the market. But it‚Äôs not just a piece of real estate; it‚Äôs a piece of Hollywood history. Even decades later, fans of \"Poltergeist\" continue to visit to see where their favorite scenes were filmed. But the real question is: are you ready to peek behind the facade and discover what‚Äôs there now? Here‚Äôs the intrigue: how would you feel stepping into the shoes of those who lived here all those years ago? üé• #hollywoodhistory #poltergeist #legendarylocation #northcalifornia #filmlocation #realestate #gayaffa"
