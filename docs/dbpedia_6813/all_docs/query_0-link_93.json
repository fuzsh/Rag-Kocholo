        "text": "Another year of cinema has drawn to a close, and to say it was an eventful year in the world of film would be something of an understatement. There have been great films aplenty, but the year will probably be most remembered for the Writers’ Guild of America Strike which began in May and was later followed by the SAG-AFTRA strike by the actors’ union in July. Both strikes combined brought Hollywood to a complete standstill for many months and thankfully the unions reached deals to bring their respective strikes to an end, and kudos to both unions for staying strong throughout those tough months and getting the deal they deserve. Simply put, without them we would have no films to celebrate. Now let’s get down to business and have a look at the best films of 2023, which was an excellent year for cinema.\n\nMy key criteria for determining films to consider for the list is if the film is listed as a 2023 release on IMDB. Though, as always seems to be, there are some films released last year elsewhere but didn’t come to UK shores until 2023, so there can be some exceptions. In addition, there are films which are 2023 releases, but don’t get UK-wide releases till next year. As I saw these at London Film Festival, they are eligible for inclusion on this year’s list. Also, though I wish I could, I have not seen every film released this year, so if your favourite film isn’t on here, it is possible I have not seen it, so please let me know if there’s a film you think I missed.\n\nLastly, as usual, while I have not reviewed every film here, grades do not matter in determining the rankings. This is my list to highlight and celebrate the films which resonated with me the most and defined the past 12 months of cinema, As usual, there are some honourable mentions, films which are excellent and worth your time but just didn’t quite make my list this year:\n\nThe Creator [review]. Discussions about artificial intelligence and its use have been plentiful since they were integral parts of both strikes which brought Hollywood to a standstill. In his first film in seven years, Gareth Edwards directs a visually striking film, which bears similarities to films which have tackled AI before, but most assuredly brings its own stamp on it, with a standout breakthrough performance from Madeleine Yuna Voyles.\n\nThe Marvels [review]. It’s no secret that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has had some stinkers in recent years, (see Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania), but after a certain group of galaxy-saving a-holes reunited for one last glorious adventure (more on that later), the latest MCU team-up proved the MCU is not at the crisis point many have seemingly gleefully said it was. Nia DaCosta’s energetic direction ensures this cosmic adventure is a delightful blast of fun thanks to the chemistry between its three leading ladies, especially Iman Vellani as Ms Marvel.\n\nPuss In Boots: The Last Wish [review]. A sequel to 2011’s Puss In Boots was probably not high on anyone’s wish list when it came to sequels anyone was asking for, but when this film opened wide in the UK early this year, it was easy to see why it was so highly well thought of after very positive reviews across the pond. Another film (along with this year’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem) to be inspired by the revolutionary style of animation from Into The Spider-Verse, its mesh-up of Western flick meets fairytale worked a treat, for cats and humans alike.\n\nAll of Us Strangers. Death is inescapable to all of us, whether it’s the fact we’re faced with our own mortality or the agonising prospect of seeing someone we love pass away. However, this is just merely scratching the surface of Andrew Haigh’s beautiful and devastating film about the life of one writer who makes a fateful journey to visit his childhood home. To say this film is emotional would be an understatement and features awards-worthy performances from Andrew Scott and Paul Mescal.\n\nThe Zone of Interest. The Holocaust, one of the darkest and most evil periods in human history, is made all the more horrifying in this film from Jonathan Glazer depicting the everyday life of a family who live in a house right next to Auschwitz. A disturbing and urgent analysis of human complicity in the face of unspeakable evil, it’s certainly not the easiest watch, but its method of storytelling is devastatingly effective, will get under your skin and will not leave your mind for a very long time.\n\nThe Bikeriders. My final honourable mention is a film that was meant to come out this year but frustratingly has been delayed till next year after it was dropped by its distributor due to the actors’ strike, and reacquired by a new one. I was lucky enough to catch this at LFF, and is a powerful story about a biker gang through the decades, featuring top performances from Jodie Comer, Austin Butler and Tom Hardy. What more could anyone want?\n\nHonourable mentions honoured. Now, here comes the best of the best…\n\n15. Rye Lane\n\n2023 saw a handful of new British voices make their mark with their directorial debuts, one such example being Raine Allen-Miller with her delightful rom-com, which in a refreshing change of scenery, was filmed entirely in South London. Charting the budding romance between David and Yas two souls who are recovering after break-ups, it doesn’t reinvent the rom-com wheel but it doesn’t need to when it is charming, funny, well acted and serves as a refreshing take on the British rom-com and as a loving tribute to the city of London.\n\n14. The Holdovers\n\nreview\n\nIf you were to ask people to name the worst or least preferable place you would want to spend Christmas, chances are a school might be high up on that list. It is one particular example of that type of institution where three unfortunate souls must spend the holidays together in this heartwarming hug of a film from Alexander Payne as one student, a cranky professor and the school’s cook are forced to remain on campus throughout the holidays. From the moment the opening titles transport you to that special time of year, it expertly balances some very funny humour with a more poignant story of three unlikely souls forced to spend time together, while bonding and understanding one another’s perspectives on life. It is the perfect Christmas film, and for that, I cannot remotely fathom why is it getting a UK release in mid-January when it would have made much more sense to release it in the run-up to Christmas?\n\n13. Godzilla Minus One\n\nFor nearly seventy years now, Godzilla, or to give him his proper title, the King of the Monsters has been a staple of Japanese cinema, and latterly in American cinema, appearing in 38 films in total. It is somewhat fitting that as the legendary monster will celebrate his 70th birthday next year, a film has come along that is one of the best Godzilla films that has ever been made and blows the US-produced films to feature Gojira out of the water. The film brings a new level of menace to the kaiju as he torments a post-WWII Japan, all while showing its US counterparts, how to provide rich depth to its human characters to make the audience want to root for them.\n\n12. John Wick: Chapter 4\n\nIt is incredible to think a film which is not based off any existing IP back in 2014 has consistently produced incredible action scenes with each and every instalment and ripping up, or rather, (shooting up) the rule book on how to make action films. It is a testament to director Chad Stahelski and star Keanu Reeves, for the impact these films have made on the action film genre. While being a man of few words, Baba Yaga is certainly a man of action and across four films, exhibiting endlessly creative ways to eliminate those gunning for him, has added yet another role to the many he has played across his incredible career and while a fifth film is said to be in development, Reeves certainly went out on the best possible note he could have.\n\n11. Poor Things\n\nThere is no one currently working in Hollywood, who does eccentric filmmaking quite like Yorgos Lanthimos, and his latest idiosyncratic odyssey is easily the most bizarre film of his career and is also his best. Exploring the life of a woman brought back to life by an orthodox scientist and given the brain of an unborn infant, it revels in its eccentricities with some of the hilarious dialogue all year, and a bold celebration of feminity and sex-positivity and an award-worthy performance from Emma Stone.\n\nNow for the top 10…\n\n10. Polite Society\n\nreview\n\nAlong with Raine-Allen Miller, Nida Manzoor is another director who announced herself as an exciting new voice in British Cinema with this action-packed and hilarious story of a budding young stuntwoman who must hatch a plan to save her sister after she gets engaged to a man she sees as deeply suspicious. A joyful celebration of an unbreakable bond between sisters, Priya Kansara’s brilliant breakthrough performance deserves to put her on the path to stardom. This film massively flew under the radar this year. So if you haven’t seen it, (UK readers, it is available on Sky/NOW), I would highly recommend seeking it out, as it even received former US President Barack Obama’s seal of approval! I mean, there is no higher endorsement than that!!\n\n9. Joy Ride\n\nreview\n\nAlong with another film that will appear later on this list, there has been an increasing amount of Asian representation in cinema, which is wonderful to see and long overdue. Similarly on the rise has been an abundance of raunchy comedies that are unafraid to go all out to get audiences laughing, and no film went as harder or was as hilariously brilliant as Adele Lim’s directorial debut. Focusing on a group of Asian-American women who travel to China for a business trip, before one of them is persuaded to venture across China to find her birth mother. Such comedies live or die on the chemistry of their cast, and the chemistry between the leads is electric and is filled with side-splitting gags to make you laugh every single time, while also providing some touching moments along the ride. You will never look at a basketball and massage gun the same way again.\n\n8. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3\n\nreview\n\nFor a long time, it really felt like the third and concluding chapter of the trilogy featuring the lovable rogues gallery of a-holes in the MCU was never going to see the light of day after James Gunn was fired by Disney. Thankfully though, the director who catapulted these characters from obscure comic book fringes to arguably the MCU’s most beloved team got to make his concluding chapter and a swansong for this team as we know them, and it was certainly worth the wait.\n\nFrom the outset, Gunn made it clear that there was one key reason for him to come back to conclude this franchise, as it explores the tragic past of the smallest and the-wise cracking member of the team, Rocket. Some scenes are undoubtedly hard to watch and the film ventures into considerably darker territory than its two predecessors, but through that, Gunn brings the usual brand of humour and energy one would expect of a Guardians film. Plus, it takes some doing to outdo the Mad Titan Thanos in terms of being an evil villain, but in Chukwudi Iwuji’s High Evolutionary, you have one of the MCU’s most evilest of bastards, and of course another banging soundtrack. Gunn is now heading up things for DC in their rebooted cinematic universe, but we can be thankful that he got the chance to give these heroes the send-off they thoroughly deserved.\n\n7. The Killer\n\nreview\n\nIf you’ve ever found yourself wondering what on earth the mindset of a deadly assassin possibly looks like, then look no further than the latest film from the master of the thriller David Fincher. Rigorous preparation, the removal of all emotions and endless patience (plus chowing on some McDonalds and listening to the Smiths) all while waiting for the opportune moment to strike. It is befitting of a character who utilises precise methods in his line of work, to come from a director who takes a similarly meticulous approach to the way he directs. The movie never ceases to thrill and provide moments of tension as it follows this assassin on his personal quest, all while getting a brilliantly chilling lead performance from Michael Fassbender after a three-year hiatus from the big screen.\n\n6. Creed III\n\nreview\n\nWhen it was revealed the ninth instalment in the Rocky franchise would not feature the involvement of the Italian Stallion, fans would have been well within their rights to have had a little trepidation going into this sequel. Yet they needn’t have worried, because with Michael B. Jordan’s Adonis Creed once again dusting off his boxing gloves stepping both into the ring as well as behind the camera for his directorial debut, to build on the legacy of both the previous Creed films, and the Rocky franchise as a whole.\n\nThe stakes are significantly heightened when Adonis is reunited with Dame, a childhood friend who after serving nearly two decades in prison is keen for a shot at professional boxer glory, to make up for lost time. This desire puts the former friends on a direct collision course. Jordan once again shines as the titular character as he grapples with the legacy of his father, as well as his own now he has a daughter with his wife Bianca. Furthermore, as a director, the passion he has for anime comes to the fore when directing the fight sequences. There may have been no Italian Stallion this time, but the franchise has got plenty of fight left in it.\n\nSuch was 2023 a fantastic year for cinema, deciding where to put these next five movies was REALLY hard because they are all excellent and I could have very easily put any of them at number #1. But, as this is a ranked list, sadly they can’t all share the crown of my favourite film of the year, and so on we go…\n\n5. Barbie\n\nreview\n\nThe first of two films which generated the Barbenheimer cultural phenomenon. From the minute Greta Gerwig’s take on the influential Mattel doll, which changed the toy industry forever, began with a parody of 2001: A Space Odyssey, it was clear this was going to be a Barbie movie unlike any other. Filled with those bright fuschia sets which caused a worldwide shortage of that particular paint colour, came a hilarious and moving story about feminism, consumerism, gender roles, and the patriarchy and its treatment of women. A stacked and flawless cast, led by another excellent performance by Margot Robbie, but it is Ryan Gosling who steals the movie with all his Kenergy. On top of all that, you had an irresistibly catchy soundtrack with Billie Eilish’s beautiful song “What Was I Made For?” tugging on those heartstrings. It is little wonder the film is the undisputed Queen of the box office of the year and the highest-grossing film ever from a solo female director. As Ryan Gosling’s Ken would say, “SUBLIME!”\n\n4. Past Lives\n\nreview\n\nAt some point in your life, you might have remarked about what you might have been in a past life and what would have happened had you made different choices. It is this concept about a life never lived, through a uniquely Korean concept known as “in-yeon” that is the basis for Celine Song’s beautiful and emotional directorial debut. Having moved from her native Korea as a child and now settled in New York, Nora (a brilliant performance by Greta Lee) reconnects with her childhood sweetheart years later over the internet and then again later in person having seen over two decades pass. At its heart, it is a movie about a love triangle, but there are so many nuances and layers to this beautiful story, in particular about the immigrant experience, love, and regrets, as its three main characters ruminate on their journeys through life, and what might have been. Easily this year’s best directorial debut.\n\n3. Killers of the Flower Moon\n\nreview\n\nThe Reign of Terror, a period of dark and violent history in the United States, in which members of the Osage tribe were systematically murdered by White people to obtain the enormous wealth the Osage had gained following the discovery of oil on their land. It’s a period that history, even in the region where these events took place has tried to bury and silence the Osage. However it should be taught in schools as an example of the poisonous and terrible impact of corruption, white supremacy and greed can have on society, which is still depressingly relevant even after a century has passed. After making films across six decades, Martin Scorsese continues to prove what a formidable filmmaker he is as across 206 enthralling minutes, which fly by thanks to Thelma Schoonmaker’s masterful editing, he brings together his two muses Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert DeNiro for the first time on the big screen. Still, both of them are outshone by Lily Gladstone’s Mollie Burkhart, who steals the entire film with a powerful and emotionally devastating performance.\n\n2. Oppenheimer\n\nreview\n\n“Prometheus stole fire from the gods and gave it to man. For this, he was chained to a rock and tortured for eternity.” From the moment these words appeared on screen in the latest film from Christopher Nolan, against a backdrop of a big ball of flame and a thunderous ominous score, it set the scene for a thrilling and haunting thriller exploring the life and legacy of a man the director has called “the most important person who ever lived”, the American Prometheus, and the father of the atomic bomb, J. Robert Oppenheimer.\n\nAcross three riveting hours, jumping effortlessly between the perspective of his titular character and from a more objective perspective, this record-breaking biographical film explores Oppenheimer’s efforts to bring Nuclear physics to the US, his work on the Manhatten project to develop a weapon which would as one character memorably says “gave them the power to destroy themselves, and the world is not prepared”, which all leads to the incredible and nerve-shredding Trinity Test sequence, one of the most mind-blowing accomplishments of Nolan’s incredible career. Impeccably acted by all of its all-star cast, especially Cillian Murphy and arguably the best performance of Robert Downey Jr’s career, and a stunning score from Ludwig Goransson, and you have a film which Downey Jr succinctly summmarised was the “culmination” of Nolan’s career “and a freaking masterpiece”. I couldn’t agree more with his sentiments.\n\nWhat a marvellous double bill Barbenheimer made for countless cinema-goers.\n\nAnd so my favourite film of 2023 is..\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n1. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\n\nreview\n\nWhat do you do when you’ve created one of the most ground-breaking superhero films of all time which redefined what was possible in animation and superhero movies as a whole? This would have been the challenge facing the visionaries behind Miles Morales’s first animated multiversal adventure when it was released in late 2018? A film which raised the bar for studios when it comes to crafting spectacular animation, as well as being ahead of the curve when it comes to films exploring the multiverse. The answer, is, that you somehow manage to outdo yourselves by creating a follow-up that manages to surpass its predecessor with even more incredible animation in so many incredible styles. Honestly, you could hang some of the shots from this film in a museum and they would not look out of place.\n\nOn top of the incredible animation, this sequel brings to the table another moving and emotional story which challenges what it means to be the hero who puts on the mask and whether is it within Spider-Man’s power to stop the inevitable or “canon events”? It also brings more jaw-dropping action sequences and allows Miles to grow in his role as Brooklyn’s one and only Spider-Man while exploring his relationships with his parents, particularly his mother, and those closest to him, namely Gwen Stacy, Peter B. Parker and more. A spectacular accomplishment and with the concluding chapter on the way, if it does stick that superhero landing it will thwip its way to become one of the finest trilogies of all time without any question of a doubt.\n\nBetween this and Insomniac’s Spider-Man games, it is an amazing time to be a Miles Morales fan and his live-action debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe cannot come soon enough.\n\n————————————————————————————————\n\nAnd that brings the curtain down on my list of the best the big screen had to offer in 2022. Thank you for reading, especially if you read all the way through! What were your favourite films of 2023? Let me know in the comments below or you can find me on the following platforms: X/Twitter, Facebook or Letterbox’d.\n\nAnother awards season is poised to come to a close, and so it is time to celebrate the best of the best that cinema had to offer with the 95th Academy Awards. All in all, 2022 was a solid year for cinema, especially given the struggles it has had to endure for these previous two years. After the mess of last year’s ceremony where some of the awards were inexcusably presented off the air, the Academy has thankfully not carried this nonsensical idea over to this year’s ceremony.\n\nSo, without further ado, with 23 of those prestigious trophies up for grabs, here are my predictions for who will be clutching one of those iconic golden statues at the end of the evening.\n\nBest Supporting Actress\n\nAngela Bassett – Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\n\nHong Chau – The Whale\n\nKerry Condon – The Banshees of Inisherin\n\nJamie Lee Curtis – Everything Everywhere All At Once\n\nStephanie Hsu – Everything Everywhere All At Once\n\nWe kick off with easily the most stacked acting category this year where there is a plethora of performances which could have been in the final five. But for now, let’s focus on those who were nominated. The nominations of both Hong Chau and Stephanie Hsu mark the first time two Asian actresses have scored nominations in this category in the same year, and apart from Bassett, everyone else is picking up their first nomination. It looked for a while as though Hsu might miss out but it’s a relief she made it as her performance is a crucial part of her film’s narrative. Meanwhile, Jamie Lee Curtis’s performance in the same film feels like a culmination of everything she has brought to the industry across a five-decade-long career, which could explain her win at the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Awards. She probably wouldn’t have made the top five given the fierce competition, but it is nonetheless fantastic to see a legend like her be given her first nomination.\n\nThe two front runners are by far and away Kerry Condon and Angela Bassett, the latter of whom’s nomination marks the first time an acting performance in a Marvel Cinematic Universe film has received an Oscar nomination. Like Curtis, Bassett is a legend of the industry and yet somehow this is only her second nomination following 1993’s What’s Love Got to do With It. Despite Condon’s win at BAFTA, this trophy should have Bassett’s name on it, which when you watch her performance, especially the throne room speech in Wakanda Forever, where her grief and pain over the loss of Chadwick Boseman is painfully felt, there should be only one clear winner.\n\nIt says a lot about the insane competition this year when the likes of Janelle Monae (Glass Onion), Samantha Morton (She Said), Dolly De Leon (Triangle of Sadness), Lashana Lynch and Thuso Mbedu (The Woman King) and Claire Foy and Jessie Buckley (Women Talking), all of whom would have been worthy of a nomination, can’t even get a look in.\n\nWill Win: Angela Bassett\n\nShould Win: Angela Bassett\n\nCould have been nominated: See all of the above\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nBrendan Gleeson – The Banshees of Inisherin\n\nBrian Tyree Henry – Causeway\n\nJudd Hirsch – The Fabelmans\n\nBarry Keoghan – The Banshees of Inisherin\n\nKe Huy Quan – Everything Everywhere All At Once\n\nFor the fourth year in a row, this category has two actors from the same film competing for the Best Supporting Actor trophy, with everyone apart from Judd Hirsch picking up their first nominations, which is wonderful to see. It might have been a full set of first-timers had Paul Dano been nominated for The Fabelmans, as many had predicted. Sadly, for Dano, his wait for his first nomination goes on.\n\nHe might not have been on screen for very long, but Hirsch’s Uncle Boris certainly left an impression in The Fabelmans. Brian Tyree Henry’s nomination came thoroughly out of the left field as he has been largely ignored throughout all of this awards season, but it is extremely satisfying to see him included as his performance in Causeway deserved recognition. The work of both Brendan Gleeson and Barry Keoghan in The Banshees of Inisherin is some of the best work of their respective careers, both working effortlessly alongside Colin Farrell to great effect, However, out of all the acting categories, this one feels the closest to a lock as, despite Keoghan’s triumph at the BAFTAs, there is no scenario, in this universe or in any multiverses, where Ke Huy Quan does not walk away with the Oscar for his brilliant work as Waymond, the goofy, multiverse-travelling husband to Michelle Yeoh’s Evelyn.\n\nWill Win: Ke Huy Quan\n\nShould Win: Ke Huy Quan\n\nCould have been nominated: Paul Dano for The Fabelmans\n\nBest Original Screenplay\n\nThe Banshees of Inisherin – Written by Martin McDonagh\n\nEverything Everywhere All At Once – Written by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert\n\nThe Fabelmans – Written by Steven Spielberg and Tony Kushner\n\nTár – Written by Todd Field\n\nTriangle of Sadness – Written by Ruben Ostlund\n\nA battle of the Best Picture contenders, which makes picking an immediate frontrunner at first glance seems difficult. Yet, with both The Banshees of Inisherin and Everything Everywhere All At Once having garnered the most nominations, it is likely this award will go to one of those two films. EEAAO is likely to dominate in some of the other big categories, including Best Director for The Daniels, so this could be the Academy’s chance to share the love, which is something they don’t always do. Three out of four of McDonagh’s films have been nominated for this award, so perhaps, given the Daniels seem to be odds on to win the Oscar for Best Director, this could be the moment to give McDonagh his dues.\n\nWill Win: The Banshees of Inisherin\n\nShould Win: Everything Everywhere All At Once\n\nShould have been nominated: Dana Stevens for The Woman King\n\nBest Adapted Screenplay\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front – Screenplay by Edward Berger Lesley Paterson and Ian Stokell\n\nGlass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery – Screenplay by Rian Johnson\n\nLiving – Screenplay by Kazuo Ishiguro\n\nTop Gun: Maverick – Screenplay by Ehren Kruger, Eric Warren Singer and Christopher McQuarrie\n\nWomen Talking – Screenplay by Sarah Polley\n\nAll awards season long, this award really felt as though it only had Sarah Polley’s name on it for her excellent adaption of Miraim Tews’ novel. Although given the film was bafflingly snubbed by BAFTA, it could have completely lost its momentum, particularly as All Quiet on The Western Front conquered all before it at BAFTA. But, its presence in the Best Picture race shows there is a lot of support for the film, and a victory for Women Talking would see a woman win this category for three consecutive years, which would be wonderful to see.\n\nWill Win: Women Talking\n\nShould Win: Women Talking\n\nShould have been nominated: Rebecca Lenkiewicz for She Said\n\nBest Animated Feature Film\n\nGuillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio – Guillermo del Toro Mark Gustafson, Gary Ungar and Alex\n\nMarcel the Shell with Shoes On – Dean Fleischer Camp, Elisabeth Holm, Andrew Goldman, Caroline Kaplan, and Paul Mezey\n\nPuss in Boots: The Last Wish – Joel Crawford and Mark Swift\n\nThe Sea Beast – Chris Williams and Jed Schlanger\n\nTurning Red – Domee Shi and Lindsey Collins\n\nGiven it was released in March and inexcusably did not receive a cinema release, it is a relief to see Turning Red land a nomination, given it was easily the best-animated film Disney or Pixar released last year. However, with this being the only representative from the House of Mouse in this year’s crop of nominees, could Disney’s iron grip on this category be loosening?\n\nSix of the 21 winners in this category have come from films produced either by Disney or its sister studio Pixar, but this year will make it the seventh non-Disney/Pixar winner. It will ultimately come down to the two films, with wishes at the heart of them. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is Dreamworks’ best film in years, and the cat has got my tongue and my vote. However, given the sheer labour of love in which Guillermo del Toro and his incredible team of artists brought one of the best interpretations of this classic tale to life, this is Pinocchio’s to lose.\n\nWill Win: Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio\n\nShould Win: Puss In Boots: The Last Wish\n\nBest International Feature Film\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front (Germany) – directed by Edward Berger\n\nArgentina, 1985 (Argentina) – directed by Santiago Mitre\n\nClose (Belgium) – directed by Lukas Dhont\n\nEO (Poland) – directed by Jerzy Skolimowski\n\nThe Quiet Girl (Ireland) – directed by Colm Bairéad\n\nThere’s only one film here which is a Best Picture nominee, so it will be all quiet on the upset front.\n\nWill Win: All Quiet on the Western Front\n\nShould Win: All Quiet on the Western Front\n\nShould have been nominated: Decision to Leave (South Korea)\n\nBest Original Score\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front – Nicholas Volker Bertelmann\n\nBabylon – Justin Hurwitz\n\nThe Banshees of Inisherin – Carter Burwell\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once – Son Lux\n\nThe Fabelmans – John Williams\n\nMy head wants to say this award will be going to Justin Hurwitz for his insanely catchy score to Babylon. The film divided audiences, but no one can deny the irresistibly catchy nature of Hurwitz’s work, as whenever he collaborates with Damien Chazelle, the results are always spectacular. But, could Babylon’s divisive nature scupper a prospective win? With his staggering 53rd nomination at the age of 90, this makes the legendary John Williams the oldest nominee in Oscars history, and the second most nominated individual ever after a certain Walt Disney. The Fabelmans is probably unlikely to pick up any awards anywhere else, so this could be the time to bestow Williams with his sixth Oscar, but I’m going to say Babylon will prevail.\n\nWill Win: Justin Hurwitz\n\nShould Win: Justin Hurwitz\n\nShould have been nominated: Michael Giacchino for The Batman\n\nBest Original Song\n\n“Applause” from Tell it Like a Woman – Music and lyrics by Dianne Warren\n\n“Hold My Hand” from Top Gun: Maverick – Music and lyrics by Lady Gaga and BloodPop\n\n“Lift Me Up” from Black Panther: Wakanda Forever – Music by Tems, Rihanna, Ryan Coogler and Ludwig Goransson; Lyrics by Tems and Ryan Coogler\n\n“Naatu Naatu” from RRR – Music by M. M. Keeravani; Lyrics by Chandrabose\n\n“This is a Life” from Everything Everywhere All At Once – Music by Ryan Lott, David Byrne, and Mitski; Lyrics by Ryan Lott and David Byrne\n\nWith every awards season that comes around, it is practically a given Dianne Warren will find herself nominated for Best Original Song, even if it is for a film few people have heard of. One of these days a nomination is going to turn into a win for her, but it will not be this year.\n\nAfter her success in winning this award for A Star is Born, Lady Gaga could definitely claim her second trophy for her moving song from Top Gun: Maverick, while Rihanna’s long-awaited return to music brought us the deeply moving and powerful Lift Me Up, which feels borne out of the loss everyone felt when Chadwick Boseman passed away. However, RRR took the world by storm last year and given this is its sole nomination, it feels nailed on the Academy will recognise this accomplishment with an Oscar.\n\nWill Win: RRR\n\nShould Win: Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\n\nBest Sound\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front – Viktor Prášil, Frank Kruse, Markus Stemler, Lars Ginzel, and Stefan Korte\n\nAvatar: The Way of Water – Julian Howarth, Gwendolyn Yates Whittle, Dick Bernstein, Christopher Boyes, Gary Summers, and Michael Hedges\n\nThe Batman – Stuart Wilson, William Files, Douglas Murray, and Andy Nelson\n\nElvis – David Lee, Wayne Pashley, Andy Nelson, and Michael Keller\n\nTop Gun: Maverick – Mark Weingarten, James H. Mather, Al Nelson, Chris Burdon, and Mark Taylor\n\nSo often, this category and editing go hand-in-hand, yet given the likely winner of Best Editing is nowhere to be found here, this award is a choice between the brutal sounds of trench warfare, the musical sounds of the King of Rock and Roll or the thunderous sounds of military aircraft, with the aircraft taking the trophy.\n\nWill Win: Top Gun: Maverick\n\nShould Win: Top Gun: Maverick\n\nBest Production Design\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front – Production Design: Christian M. Goldbeck; Set Decoration: Ernestine Hipper\n\nAvatar: The Way of Water – Production Design: Dylan Cole and Ben Procter; Set Decoration: Vanessa Cole\n\nBabylon – Production Design: Florencia Martin; Set Decoration: Anthony Carlino\n\nElvis – Production Design: Catherine Martin and Karen Murphy; Set Decoration: Bev Dunn\n\nThe Fabelmans – Production Design: Rick Carter; Set Decoration: Karen O’Hara\n\nThe Academy usually loves films about Hollywood. While Babylon‘s divisiveness could scupper its chances of winning Original Score, it is unlikely to prevent it from taking this award given it has swept all before it this awards season.\n\nWill Win: Babylon\n\nShould Win: Babylon\n\nShould have been nominated: Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio\n\nBest Cinematography\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front – James Friend\n\nBardo, False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths – Darius Khondji\n\nElvis – Mandy Walker\n\nEmpire of Light – Roger Deakins\n\nTár – Florian Hoffmeister\n\nWhen you consider some of the breathtaking cinematography we saw in 2022, this year’s selection of nominees is decidedly uninspiring and there are some major major snubs which boggle the mind as to why they weren’t included. Roger Deakins’s status as a legend is assured, and it is a given he will be nominated almost every time he shoots a film, there were more deserving nominations this year. Elvis’ Mandy Walker becomes the third woman to be nominated for this award and while it would be historic to see her win, yet my money is on another win for All Quiet on the Western Front.\n\nThough the snub for Claudio Miranda for Top Gun: Maverick feels particularly baffling when you consider when filming the aerial combat sequences, they were reliant on natural lighting to shoot them, not to mention the extraordinary camerawork. Plus, last year’s winner of this award Greig Fraser’s work in The Batman to capture the murky underworld of Gotham City was equally deserving of a nomination.\n\nWill Win: All Quiet on the Western Front\n\nShould Win: All Quiet on the Western Front\n\nShould have been nominated: Claudio Miranda for Top Gun: Maverick, Linus Sandgren for Babylon or Greig Fraser for The Batman\n\nBest Makeup and Hairstyling\n\nSuccess in this category can often correlate with a win in one of the acting categories. This year, it could come down to whichever actor the Academy chooses to honour in Best Actor, which puts this as a coin flip between Elvis or The Whale. Given who I think will win Best Actor, my bet is going to give this one to The Whale.\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front – Heike Merker and Linda Eisenhamerová\n\nThe Batman – Naomi Donne, Mike Marino and Mike Fontaine\n\nBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever – Camille Friend and Joel Harlow\n\nElvis – Mark Coulier, Jason Baird, and Aldo Signoretti\n\nThe Whale – Adrien Morot, Judy Chin, and Anne Marie Bradley\n\nWill Win: The Whale\n\nShould Win: The Whale\n\nBest Costume Design\n\nBabylon – Mary Zophres\n\nBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever – Ruth Carter\n\nElvis – Catherine Martin\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once – Shirley Kurata\n\nMrs Harris Goes to Paris – Jenny Bevan\n\nRuth Carter’s win for the first Black Panther film at the 91st Academy Awards was a historic win, and if she were to repeat her triumph, she would become the first black woman to win two Oscars in any category, which is just utterly mind-boggling. However, Catherine Martin’s work in Elvis to recreate so many of the King’s iconic costumes is some incredible work which would be worthy of a victory to add to her victories in this category for Baz Luhrmann’s previous films The Great Gatsby and Moulin Rouge!\n\nWill Win: Elvis\n\nShould Win: Everything Everywhere All At Once\n\nShould have been nominated: Gersha Phillips for The Woman King and Jenny Eagan for Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery\n\nBest Film Editing\n\nThe Banshees of Inisherin – Mikkel E. G. Nielsen\n\nElvis – Matt Villa and Jonathan Redmond\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once – Paul Rogers\n\nTár – Monika Willi\n\nTop Gun: Maverick – Eddie Hamilton\n\nIt is usually the case that editing and sound categories correlate. Yet, could this be the year which breaks that trend? Top Gun: Maverick had the unenviable task of editing through several hundred hours of footage they shot for the aerial combat sequences, which would have put it in a good position to fly home with the win. But, the editing in Everything Everywhere All At Once is equally impressive. While one assumes they did not have to edit through several hundred hours of footage, due to the nature of its plot and its ambition, the film could have very easily become a jumbled mess had the editing not been as on point as it was. Either would be a worthy winner, but the power of the multiverse should help EEAAO prevail.\n\nWill Win: Everything Everywhere All At Once\n\nShould Win: Top Gun: Maverick\n\nBest Visual Effects\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front – Frank Petzold, Viktor Müller, Markus Frank, and Kamil Jafar\n\nAvatar: The Way of Water – Joe Letteri, Richard Baneham, Eric Saindon, and Daniel Barrett\n\nThe Batman – Dan Lemmon, Russell Earl, Anders Langlands, and Dominic Tuohy\n\nBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever – Geoffrey Baumann, Craig Hammack, R. Christopher White, and Dan Sudick\n\nTop Gun: Maverick – Ryan Tudhope, Seth Hill, Bryan Litson, and Scott R. Fisher\n\nThe combination of the sheer visual majesty of Pandora and the pioneering technology developed for those breathtaking underwater scenes means there should only be one winner here.\n\nWill Win: Avatar: The Way of Water\n\nShould Win: Avatar: The Way of Water\n\nBest Director\n\nMartin McDonagh – The Banshees of Inisherin\n\nDaniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert – Everything Everywhere All At Once\n\nSteven Spielberg – The Fabelmans\n\nTodd Field – Tár\n\nRuben Östlund – Triangle of Sadness\n\nFor the last two years, we’ve seen women triumph in this category, which makes it all the more frustrating that women again find themselves shut out of this category, especially when you look at the quality of the films which were directed by women last year, there were certainly more than a few candidates who could have got in, such as Gina Prince-Bythewood, Sarah Polley, Maria Schrader or Chinoye Chukwu.\n\nThe Academy does have a tendency to nominate at least one international director, but had they nominated Edward Berger for All Quiet on The Western Front instead of Östlund, this might have been a very different race given the former’s success at BAFTA. Given his semi-autobiographical film may not triumph anywhere else, this could be the best chance to honour Steven Spielberg with his first Oscar since he won this very same award for Saving Private Ryan in 1999. However, with their triumph at the Directors Guild Awards, and the fact their film threw everything at the wall and somehow made it all work to wonderful effect, this is the Daniels’ to lose.\n\nWill Win: The Daniels\n\nShould Win: The Daniels\n\nCould have been nominated: Gina Prince-Bythewood for The Woman King, Sarah Polley for Women Talking or Maria Schrader for She Said\n\nBest Actor in a Leading Role\n\nAustin Butler – Elvis\n\nColin Farrell – The Banshees of Inisherin\n\nBrendan Fraser – The Whale\n\nPaul Mescal – Aftersun\n\nBill Nighy – Living\n\nFor the first time since the 7th Academy Awards in 1935, all the nominees in this category are receiving their first nominations. This is heartwarming to see particularly for an actor like Bill Nighy whose nomination is deserving but also feels like a culmination of his decades-long career. However, both Nighy’s and Paul Mescal’s chances of a win seem unlikely as throughout this awards season, this race has been dominated by the remaining three gentlemen in this category.\n\nAustin Butler’s performance as The King of Rock and Roll was so transformative, he disappeared into the role and the Academy has had a tendency for rewarding transformative performances of that nature. Farrell had a superb 2022 with his work in After Yang, Thirteen Lives, his villainous turn in The Batman, and to top it all off his excellent work in Banshees. However, his unexpected loss at the BAFTAs to Butler means his hopes of Oscar glory now look to be remote at best, which puts this award in a straight fight between Butler and Fraser. Like Ke Huy Quan, Fraser has a comeback narrative on his side, and while The Whale has divided audiences, no one can deny Fraser’s performance was truly impactful and the six-minute standing ovation at the Venice Film Festival is a testament to this. Plus with his win at the SAG awards and the over-arching sentiment that everyone seems to have towards him, it could tip this award in Fraser’s favour but this feels too close to call.\n\nWill Win: Brendan Fraser\n\nShould Win: Brendan Fraser\n\nBest Actress in a Leading Role\n\nCate Blanchett – Tar\n\nAna de Armas – Blonde\n\nAndrea Riseborough – To Leslie\n\nMichelle Williams – The Fabelmans\n\nMichelle Yeoh – Everything Everywhere All At Once\n\nFor the second year in a row, this is the acting category which is, by far and away, the most chaotic. Last year, all of the nominees starred in films which were not nominated for Best Picture, but this year the Academy chose chaos for a different reason.\n\nLet’s start with the positives. It is fantastic to see Michelle Yeoh (somehow) bagging her first nomination for her truly incredible work in Everything Everywhere All At Once, a performance which encapsulates her extraordinary career. Her namesake Michelle Williams’s turn as a supportive mother to the on-screen representation of Steven Spielberg in The Fabelmans perfectly captured how the compassion and warmth of his mother encouraged him to want to pursue his passion for filmmaking. However, while she is great in the film, it does feel a bit of a mistake to have campaigned for her in lead, given the fierce competition from her namesake as well as Cate Blanchett’s excellent leading performance in Tar.\n\nBut, now onto the negatives, Ana De Armas is a phenomenal actress who I have admired ever since her performance in Blade Runner 2049. But, while her turn as Norma Jean/Marilyn Monroe is by far and away the best thing about Blonde, the film’s fictionalised treatment of Monroe left a very bad taste in my mouth. It was nearly three hours of relentless trauma and misery which had nothing meaningful to say and for that it should not have been bestowed with a nomination.\n\nAnd lastly, Andrea Riseborough’s nomination for her work in To Leslie came as a massive surprise given she picked up none of the precursor nominations. Her campaign was by and large driven as a result of some of her peers campaigning on her behalf. This is so frustrating because it proves even when women of colour put in exemplary performances, such as Viola Davis in The Woman King or Danielle Deadwyler’s heart-breaking performance in Till, the odds are stacked against them. Just SIX black women have been nominated for this award since Halle Berry won in 2002, it is really not good enough. If people in the industry can mobilise to push for someone like Riseborough to get a nomination, it begs the question, where is this kind of energy for women of colour? Both Davis and Deadwyler should have been nominated, with Deadwyler’s snub will go down as one of the most egregious and downright disgraceful snubs in recent memory.\n\nBut in terms of who is going to emerge victorious, it really is a coin flip between two industry veterans. Blanchett triumphed at BAFTA and Critic’s Choice, but with Yeoh’s victory at SAG, and EEAAO riding a wave of popularity which has put it in pole position to land the biggest prize of the night, it is fitting to honour the woman whose breathtaking performance is what made the film the wondrous experience it was. Yeoh deserves her dues and should become the first Asian woman, and only the second woman of colour to win this award. It is time.\n\nWill Win: Michelle Yeoh\n\nShould Win: Michelle Yeoh\n\nShould have been nominated: Danielle Deadwyler for Till and Viola Davis for The Woman King or Carey Mulligan for She Said\n\nAnd, last and certainly by no means least…\n\nBest Picture\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front – Malte Grunert\n\nAvatar: The Way of Water – James Cameron and Jon Landau\n\nThe Banshees of Inisherin – Graham Broadbent, Peter Czernin, and Martin McDonagh\n\nElvis – Baz Luhrmann, Catherine Martin, Gail Berman, Patrick McCormick, and Schuyler Weiss\n\nEverything Everywhere All At Once – Daniel Kwan, Daniel Scheinert, and Jonathan Wang\n\nThe Fabelmans – Kristie Macosko Krieger, Steven Spielberg, and Tony Kushner\n\nTár – Todd Field, Alexandra Milchan, and Scott Lambert\n\nTop Gun: Maverick – Tom Cruise, Christopher McQuarrie, David Ellison, and Jerry Bruckheimer\n\nTriangle of Sadness – Erik Hemmendorff and Philippe Bober\n\nWomen Talking – Dede Gardner, Jeremy Kleiner and Frances McDormand\n\nClick here to see my ranking of the Best Picture contenders.\n\nIt is very satisfying to see in a year where he had 12 uninterrupted months of films on the big screen, this year’s crop of Best Picture nominees is pretty strong, with no film really sticking out like a sore thumb being included in this year’s list. Though it definitely could have been better, with Women Talking representing the only female-directed film on the list, despite the fact there were more than enough quality films directed by women which could have very easily made the list, such as She Said and The Woman King.\n\nBut alas, even if they had been nominated, their chances of a win probably wouldn’t have been high. Throughout this awards season, there has been one clear favourite which has by and large dominated and swept all before it and that film is the masterpiece from the Daniels. It says a lot about the sheer momentum and the positivity for Everything Everywhere that has carried it all the way to the awards season given it was released early last year and not in the usual Autumn/Winter awards season window and should it add the main prize to its likely slew of trophies, it would be the best Best Picture win since Parasite‘s triumph at the 92nd Oscars.\n\nWill Win: Everything Everywhere All At Once\n\nShould Win: Everything Everywhere All At Once\n\nShould have been nominated: The Woman King and She Said\n\n————————————————–\n\nFinal counts\n\nWill win:\n\nEverything Everywhere All At Once – 5 (Picture, Actress, Director, Supporting Actor and Film Editing)\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front – 2 (International Feature and Cinematography)\n\nBabylon – 2 (Production Design and Score)\n\nThe Whale – 2 (Actor and Makeup and Hairstyling)\n\nAvatar: The Way of Water – 1 (Visual Effects)\n\nBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever -1 (Supporting Actress)\n\nThe Banshees of Inisherin – 1 (Original Screenplay)\n\nElvis -1 (Costume Design)\n\nGuillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio – 1 (Animated Feature Film)\n\nRRR – 1 (Original Song)\n\nTop Gun: Maverick – 1 (Sound)\n\nWomen Talking – 1 (Adapted Screenplay)\n\nShould win:\n\nEverything Everywhere All At Once – 6 (Picture, Actress, Original Screenplay, Director, Supporting Actor, and Costume Design)\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front – 2 (International Feature and Cinematography)\n\nBabylon – 2 (Production Design and Score)\n\nBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever – 2 (Supporting Actress and Original Song)\n\nTop Gun: Maverick – 2 (Sound and Film Editing)\n\nThe Whale – 2 (Actor and Makeup and Hairstyling)\n\nAvatar: The Way of Water – 1 (Visual Effects)\n\nPuss In Boots: The Last Wish – 1 (Animated Feature Film)\n\nWomen Talking – 1 (Adapted Screenplay)\n\nAfter the last two years saw cinema closures due to the pandemic for significant parts of the year, it has been immensely satisfying to have had a full interrupted 12 months of uninterrupted movies on the big screen. And what a year for film it has been, whodunnits aplenty, a long-awaited return to Pandora, more multiversal shenanigans, a very meta-comedy, some utterly enthralling action epics and a couple of extremely important movies that shone a spotlight on some very important and brave people. So without further ado, let us have a look at the best films of 2022.\n\nWith regards to films eligible for inclusion on this list, I always aim to include films which are listed as 2022 releases on IMDB. Yet, as seems to be the case every year, there are those films listed as 2021 releases which did not get released until well into the year, which makes them eligible for my 2022 list. On the flip side, there are some films featured here that are yet to be released in UK cinemas, but as I was able to catch these at London Film Festival, they are eligible for inclusion on this list. And as much as I would want to, I haven’t seen every film released in 2022, so if your favourite film is not on here, I might not have seen it. (On that note, I haven’t yet seen Babylon or The Fabelmans as they have not been released in the UK yet. I will factor these films into this list once I have seen them.)\n\nLastly, as always, the grades I awarded a film do not determine the final position on this list, a film which gets a perfect grade will not necessarily make it my favourite film of the year. This is my unashamedly biased list to highlight and celebrate the films which defined cinema in 2022 for me. As usual, there are some honourable mentions, films which are really great and worth your time but just didn’t quite make my list this year:\n\nThe Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent [review]. Nicolas Cage stars as Nick Cage in a very meta, but utterly hilarious, comedy that celebrates the career of Nicholas Cage, whilst also recognising the greatness that is Paddington 2. What more could you want?\n\nCauseway. Jennifer Lawrence and Brian Tyree Henry both give exceptional performances in this slow-burning but heavily impactful drama exploring the dynamic between two people trying to readjust and find their place in the world following tragic circumstances.\n\nThe Menu. A delightfully delicious satire of the wealthy elite of our society with a fascinatingly chilling performance from Ralph Fiennes as the head chef of this unique restaurant which will make you crave a particular food item by the end credits.\n\nThe Banshees of Inisherin [review]. Martin McDonagh reunites with his In Bruges stars Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson for a simple tale of two friends who have fallen out elevated by McDonagh’s razor-sharp screenplay, which is a fascinating blend of black comedy meets tragedy.\n\nBros. Billy Eichner co-writes and stars in by far and away the funniest film of the year in a hilarious, heartfelt and groundbreaking rom-com which stars a predominantly LGBTQ+ cast, and openly and proudly celebrates the LGBT+ community in a massive step forward for diversity on screen.\n\nHonourable mentions honoured. Now, here comes the top 10…\n\n15. The Whale\n\nFor years, Brendan Fraser was absent from Hollywood for a multitude of reasons. In this powerful drama from Darren Aronofsky, he makes his triumphant return in this moving film as an obese man who tries to reconnect with his estranged teenage daughter after he drove her away by eating to excess. It’s a simple story but one made extremely powerful, with stunning supporting performances from Hong Chau and Sadie Sink, as well as a devastating lead performance from Fraser.\n\n14. Avatar: The Way of Water\n\nreview\n\n13 years after the release of his ground-breaking film Avatar, James Cameron triumphantly returns to Pandora for the long-awaited sequel which has proved the appetite for audiences to make the return to this incredible world was there all along. This enthralling sequel offers some of the most dazzling visual effects you will ever see, especially for all those underwater scenes. While a bit of a retread of the first film in terms of its plot, it offered plenty of emotional stakes and compelling action to make this a worthwhile return to Pandora.\n\n13. Till\n\nIn 1955, 14-year-old Emmett Till was brutally lynched and murdered by white supremacists. Following this heinous crime, his mother Mamie Till became an activist and a powerful voice in the Civil Rights Movement in the USA, campaigning for justice for her murdered son. It is certainly not an easy watch, but an extremely powerful and necessary one thanks to Danielle Deadwyler’s extraordinary, devastating and awards-worthy performance.\n\n12. See How They Run\n\nreview\n\nAgatha Christie is arguably the greatest novelist of all time when it comes to penning murder mystery novels and plays, so where better to set a murder mystery at the centre of a production of The Mousetrap? Harbouring the whimsical spirit of a Wes Anderson film, this film provides some delightful and witty meta-commentary on the murder mystery genre, whilst getting stellar performances out of its cast, especially Sam Rockwell as a grumpy detective and the scene-stealing Saoirse Ronan.\n\n11. Nope\n\nJordan Peele’s first two films, both superbly blending horror and comedy, cemented the former star of the Key & Peele comedy double act as one of those directors whose name alone has the power to sell a film. Much intrigue surrounded his third film in the build-up to its release as to what the master and horror comedy could produce and whether he could complete his hat-trick? Short answer, yep, he can.\n\nOnce again providing an expert blend of horror and comedy, Peele upped the ambition for this one by going down the sci-fi route as a strange phenomenon haunts the sibling owners of a ranch, namely OJ (Daniel Kaluuya) and Emerald (Keke Palmer). Like his previous two films, the film has a lot to say with thought-provoking subtext and social commentary about humanity’s love/fascination with spectacle. Reuniting with Peele after Get Out, Kaluuya adds another stellar performance to an impressive filmography, but this film belongs to Keke Palmer who steals the show with a fantastic performance.\n\nNow for the top 10…\n\n10. Bullet Train\n\nreview\n\nA high-speed bullet train is probably the last place you’d want to find yourself on your commute, especially if you knew there was a group of deadly assassins on board whose missions are interconnected. Fortunately for us, under the vision of stuntman-turned-director David Leitch, this particular service is a delightfully entertaining and one of the most stylish action films all year as these missions criss-cross with violent and hilarious results and one of the best comedy double acts of the year in Brian Tyree Henry and Aaron Taylor-Johnson’s assassin comedy duo.\n\n9. Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\n\nreview\n\nThe foundations of the Marvel Cinematic Universe were forever changed when it was announced that Chadwick Boseman passed away in August 2020. It put director Ryan Coogler in the toughest of positions when it came to the sequel to 2018’s Black Panther as to how on earth they could overcome such a tragic horrific loss of someone who brought so much to the screen with every single role? In the most difficult of circumstances, Coogler and his cast came through to deliver a heart-breaking but beautiful film which in the most difficult circumstances explores how we process the grief when someone close to us has passed away, while also serving as an emotional tribute to Boseman’s extraordinary legacy.\n\n8. Turning Red\n\nreview\n\nPixar films have never been afraid to tackle meaningful subject matter while also turning audiences into blubbering messes with the brilliantly emotional stories they have created over the years. In their first film directed by a woman, Domee Shi continues this trajectory with her brilliant, hilarious and emotional film about a girl who discovers whenever she gets nervous or excited, she turns into a giant red panda. Simultaneously a moving story about culture, family, and the perils of growing up, plus lots and lots of 2000s nostalgia. Furthermore, to its immense credit, the film is not afraid to shy away from the subject of puberty from a female perspective.\n\n7. Belle\n\nreview\n\nOffering some of the most jaw-dropping and stunning animation we have seen so far this decade, Mamoru Hosada’s film is a beautiful tale of one girl who, after a personal tragedy, is able to rediscover her passion for singing when she joins a vast digital world and becomes a global sensation. Encompassing themes of the impact of bereavement on a young person, the increasingly digital nature of society and the desire particularly among young people to have an online presence, the highs and lows encompassing fame/viral sensation online, while providing a modern 21st-century update for a tale as old as time. It is utterly scandalous this film was not nominated for the Best Animated Feature Oscar.\n\n6. The Woman King\n\nreview\n\nWhat comes to mind when you hear the words: historical epic? Chances are you’ll think of a film like Gladiator or Braveheart where men are taking revenge against those who have wronged them or are charging into battle. Given these sorts of films are almost always from the perspective of a man, it makes Gina Prince-Bythewood’s film telling the true story of the Agoije, an all-female group of warriors in a West African kingdom so awe-inspiring and badass. Viola Davis’s General Nanisca is exactly the sort of commander who you would follow onto the battlefield. She leads an impeccably acted cast including career-best work from Lashana Lynch, an impressive breakthrough performance from Thuso Mbedu and a wonderfully regal performance from John Boyega.\n\n5. Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery\n\nreview\n\nWhen Daniel Craig’s Benoit Blanc made his introduction in Rian Johnson’s 2019 murder mystery/whodunnit Knives Out, right then and there, with his iconic Southern drawl, a modern icon of the genre was born. With the film representing a revitalisation of the genre, it came as little surprise when Netflix sanctioned a massive money deal for the rights to two further sequels. It brought much anticipation as to what everyone’s favourite Southern sleuth would get up to on his next case.\n\nWith another superbly stacked cast bringing to life another array of eccentric, colourful and rather douchey characters at its core, Johnson proves once again there was no foul play with Knives Out as he demonstrates his love for the genre with another wonderfully witty and hilarious screenplay, which is almost prophetic with the satire and social commentary at the centre. Every single member of this ensemble cast play their roles to perfection, and it is wonderful to see Craig have so much fun following his stint as 007. But the standout is, by far, Janelle Monae. So long as Craig and Johnson are happy to keep making these movies, there will be no complaints from me if we have many more adventures with Monsieur Blanc for many years to come.\n\n4. Top Gun Maverick\n\nreview\n\nOne of many films to have seen its release date moved around a few times due to the pandemic, fans may have wondered if this long-awaited sequel to 1986’s Top Gun was ever going to take flight. Perhaps it was due to the multiple delays, but it certainly seemed like the hype around this film was fairly muted prior to its release. Though this all changed when it finally blasted its way into cinemas, becoming Tom Cruise’s highest-grossing film of all time.\n\nThe original Top Gun arguably made a star out of Cruise, but his star power has continued to grow in the 36 years between the two films’ releases. His commitment to entertaining the audience through crazy, death-defying stunts remains unrivalled in big blockbuster filmmaking, and we are lucky to have him. Through a winning combination of utterly exhilarating flight sequences putting the audience at the heart of the action, alongside an extremely emotional story of Maverick confronting his past and his guilt over the death of his close friend Goose, as well as an extremely emotional scene with Val Kilmer’s Iceman, and you have a sequel which surpasses its predecessor in every single way, and will take your breath away again, again and again.\n\n3. She Said\n\nreview\n\nThroughout history, we have seen examples of the extraordinary work journalists can do to bring stories to light in a way that changes the world forever. One such example is the extraordinary work of Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, whose tireless investigative reporting uncovered the rampant sexual abuse of men in positions of power, such as Harvey Weinstein, which gave rise to the Time’s Up and Me Too Movements.\n\nGiven how these movements represent very recent history, it was important for the filmmakers to approach this subject matter with care, and this is exactly how Maria Schrader and screenwriter Rebecca Lenkiewicz handled it. The film simultaneously shines a light on the incredible bravery of the women who came forward to speak out against such systemic behaviour and the tireless determination of the women who, in spite of threats to have the story buried, persisted in their efforts to bring the truth to light. Flawless acting by the entire cast, especially Carey Mulligan and Zoe Kazan as Twohey and Kantor respectively, this important film shines a light on the important work journalists carry out, and the necessity for women’s voices to come to the fore when telling these stories.\n\n2. The Batman\n\nreview\n\nThe Caped Crusader is an iconic figure in both comic book and cinematic history throughout the decades. Every actor who has donned the cape and cowl has managed to bring something unique to the role. The pressure was certainly on Matt Reeves for his take on this character to do something we haven’t seen before, and he absolutely delivered.\n\nIn a Gotham City quite unlike anything we have seen before, under an eternal cloud of perpetual rainfall, we have a Batman early in his crimefighting career (portrayed magnificently by Robert Pattinson) who must utilise all his skills as he comes up against Paul Dano’s terrifying Riddler. Portraying Batman’s skills as a detective in a manner previous Batman films have rarely utilised was an inspired choice and the combination of the exploration of Gotham’s murky criminal underworld, exemplified by a terrific performance from Colin Farrell as The Penguin, alongside some brilliant action sequences. When you have all of the above, along with an outstanding turn from Zoe Kravitz as Catwoman and you have one of the greatest incarnations of the Dark Knight ever put to screen.\n\nAnd so my favourite film of 2022 is\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n1. Everything Everywhere All At Once\n\nreview\n\nWhen 2022 began, it was poised to throw a number of films at audiences which explored the concept of the multiverse. Such a concept has exploded in popularity in recent years, particularly in the genre of comic book films, little did we know that the best film to explore this concept was not something that had a Marvel logo attached to it, but was an entirely original indy flick, from the minds of the directors of Swiss Army Man.\n\nThe film lives up to its name by throwing a plethora of genres all into one big melting pot and the results were bonkers, hilariously entertaining and emotionally devastating all at once. You will never look at googly eyes, rocks, raccoons, hot dogs and bagels in the same way after watching this masterpiece. At the heart of it is an awards-worthy performance from the legendary Michelle Yeoh who pours her heart and soul into every single action scene, likewise for Ke Huay Quan who after several years away from acting makes a triumphant return. No other film released this year has illustrated to me perfectly just how special cinema can be as an art form, and for this, it more than earns the title of my favourite film of 2022.\n\n————————————————————————————————\n\nAnd that brings the curtain down on my list of the best the big screen had to offer in 2022. Thank you for reading, especially if you read all the way through! What were your favourite films of 2022? Let me know in the comments below or you can find me on the following platforms: Twitter, Facebook or Letterbox’d.\n\nFor my picks for my most anticipated films of 2023, please click here.\n\nHappy new year cinephiles!\n\n2022 was certainly a much better year for the big-screen experience as there were no enforced cinema closures to contend with. A full 12 months of uninterrupted cinema, and long may it continue! Looking to the year ahead, there is, as usual, lots to look forward to, so let us dive straight in with my most anticipated films for 2023. These are the releases that I am most looking forward to, but time will tell if they will be the best because as is the case every year there are bound to be some films that come out of nowhere with very little fanfare to blow audiences away and the films that are likely to be big awards season players tend to start popping up in the latter half of the year.\n\nBefore we start, there are a few 2022 releases that are finally getting their wide release on these shores this year, such as Babylon, TAR and The Fabelmans, but as these are technically 2022 releases, they will not be included here.\n\nBefore we have a look at the top 10, here are a few honourable mentions (All current UK release dates unless specified):\n\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie (release date: 31 March): For anyone who grew up with the early generation video game consoles, Mario is one of, if not the most iconic and recognisable video game characters of all time. Fans might have a feeling of trepidation, particularly with Chris Pratt as the voice of Mario, particularly as the other time they adapted Mario for the big screen, it did not go well. However, in the hands of Illumination, and with a strong voice cast behind it, let’s hope this one gets the gold star!\n\nThe Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes (release date: 17 November) Director Francis Lawrence is once again stepping back into the world of Panem for the prequel set 64 years before Katniss Everdeen became the Mockingjay to ignite the rebellion to overthrow the Capitol.\n\nJohn Wick: Chapter 4 (release date: 24 March) Keanu Reeves is once again suiting up as John Wick AKA Baba Yaga for the fourth instalment of this action-packed franchise. Given how the last film ended, he’s out for bloody revenge and I fear for anyone who would dare get in his way…\n\nShazam: Fury of the Gods (release date: 17 March) Asher Angel/Zachary Levi return as Billy Batson who with a single word turns into the hero Shazam. There are significantly higher stakes this time around as Billy and his adopted family of superheroes must face off against the Daughters of Atlas.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (release date: 30 June). 15 years after he last donned the iconic hat and whip of the legendary Dr Henry “Indiana” Jones Jr, Harrison Ford reprises his role for the fifth and probably final time. James Mangold takes over the directing duties from Steven Spielberg, and with Mads Mikkelsen and Phoebe Waller-Bridge joining the cast, fingers crossed it can right the wrongs of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.\n\nNow, let’s see what cracked my top 10:\n\n10. The Little Mermaid\n\nRelease date: 26 May\n\nDisney’s live-action offerings, particularly some of the recent ones, have mostly left an awful lot to be desired, begging the question as to why these films exist outside of an excuse for the Mouse House to print money. However, the live-action retelling of the story of Ariel could be the one to arrest the slump. Halle Bailey as Ariel is an excellent piece of casting, and she’s joined by Melissa McCarthy, and Javier Bardem, as well as the voice talents of Daveed Diggs, Jacob Tremblay and Awkwafina.\n\n9. The Marvels\n\nRelease date: 28 July\n\nIt’s been a while since we have seen Brie Larson’s Captain Marvel in the MCU, but she is poised to make her return in this sequel to her 2019 film. The plot remains under wraps but this film will see Carol team up with Monica Rambeau and Ms Marvel, with Teyonnah Parris and Iman Vellaini reprising their roles from WandaVision and Ms Marvel respectively. Seeing these three team up, with Candyman reboot director Nia Da Costa (the first black woman to helm an MCU movie) calling the shots. Give it to me.\n\n8. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania\n\nRelease date: 17 February\n\nThe third instalment of the adventures of the MCU’s tiniest heroes promises to be one of the biggest films, certainly for Ant-Man and in all likelihood for the MCU as a whole as this film will see Paul Rudd’s Scott Lang and Evangeline Lilly, as well as Cassie Lang (now played by Kathryn Newton), travel down to the Quantum Realm where they will have to face off against Jonathan Majors’ Kang the Conqueror, who promises to be a major (pun intended) villain of the future MCU phases going forward.\n\n7. Creed III\n\nRelease date: 3 March\n\nSpeaking of Jonathan Majors, he pops up again here in this third instalment of the Rocky spin-off franchise as an old friend of Michael B Jordan’s Adonis who seemingly has a very personal score to settle after being released from prison. The stakes feel considerably higher for this third film, but alas Sylvester Stallone’s Rocky will not be involved this time around, with Jordan stepping behind the camera for his directorial debut.\n\n6. Barbie\n\nRelease date: 21 July\n\nI honestly never thought I would see the day when a film about Barbie would feature on one of my lists of the most anticipated films of the year. But here we are, the POWER of Greta Gerwig. Not much is known about the plot of the film, but with a cast which includes Margot Robbie in the lead role, Ryan Gosling as Ken, as well as Simu Liu, Ncuti Gatwa, Emma Mackey, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Issa Rae and Michael Cera, and you have my interest, especially since THAT trailer hit the internet. Come on Barbie, let’s go party!\n\n5. Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3\n\nRelease date: 5 May\n\nThe fate of this film lay uncertain for a long period of time following the departure of director James Gunn. However, common sense prevailed and after being poached by DC to make the terrific The Suicide Squad and Peacemaker, Gunn returns for what is likely to be his last project for Marvel, and a potential end of the road for Marvel’s collection of loveable villains-turned-heroes as the recently released teaser indicates it could be an emotional farewell for The Guardians. Let’s hope Gunn has another Awesome Mix of banging tunes to drown out any potential audience waterworks.\n\n4. Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning – Part One\n\nRelease date: 14 July\n\nThe storming box office success of Top Gun: Maverick is proof positive Tom Cruise still commands insane box office power. Since Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, the MI franchise has somehow managed to find ways to keep going and just get better and better with every new instalment. This is no small part due to Cruise’s willingness to keep doing absolutely jaw-dropping and insane stunts which manage to outdo the last crazy stunt he did for the previous film.\n\nWhile plot details remain unknown, Cruise is showing no signs of slowing down with the craziness of the stuns he seems willing to pull off, and all of the familiar faces seem to be back in action alongside Cruise. Christopher McQuarrie is once again calling the shots as the director. What’s more, the franchise has added some very exciting talents including Hayley Atwell, Pom Klementioff, Esai Morales and Shea Whigham. Given this is likely to be the penultimate film with Cruise in the role of Ethan Hunt, expect even more fireworks than before, if that is somehow possible.\n\n3. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\n\nRelease date: June 2\n\n2018’s Spider-Man Into The Spider-Verse was one of the most stylish and unique animated films to have come out in a long time, and it’s one of the best superhero films ever made. Introducing fan favourite Miles Morales as Spider-Man, its unique animation style made it feel like it was as if the animators were directly taking pages of a comic book and translating them onto the screen. Plus given the recent trend among superhero films to explore the multiverse, it was a film ahead of the curve.\n\nWith this sequel, we can definitely expect more multiverse shenanigans, and the fact that this film will be part one is an extremely intriguing prospect. Shameik Moore, Hailee Steinfeld and Jake Johnson will all be reprising their voice roles. Joining the case will be Oscar Isaac as Spider-Man 2099, Issa Rae as Spider-Woman, Daniel Kaluuya as Spider-Punk, and quite possibly many more if the trailer is anything to go by. My spider senses are tingling with excitement already!\n\n2. Oppenheimer\n\nRelease date: 21 July\n\nChristopher Nolan’s films are always cinematic events, and his next film promises to be an enthralling, explosive spectacle exploring the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer and more specifically his role in the creation of the atomic bomb in the Manhattan Project during World War II. Frequent Nolan collaborator Cillian Murphy leads what is an extraordinarily stacked cast which includes: Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, Rami Malek, Florence Pugh, Benny Safdie, Michael Angarano, Josh Hartnett, Kenneth Branagh to name but a few.\n\nAnd, my #1 most anticipated film of 2023 is…\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n1. Dune: Part Two\n\nRelease date: 3 November\n\n“This is only the beginning”, says one character in the closing scene of Denis Villeneuve’s Dune, a cliffhanger which left fans wanting an immediate return to Arrakis. The sequel was not assured given the film was released to cinemas as well as a day and date release on HBO Max, but with strong box office support, substantial viewership on HBO Max, and six Academy Awards at the 94th Oscars, the spice will flow once more as Villeneuve got the go-ahead to adapt the second half of Herbert’s novel, with Paul (Timothee Chalamet) out for revenge against the ruthless Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard).\n\nAs well as Chalamet and Skarsgard, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, and Javier Bardem reprise their roles from the first film. Joining them for this sequel will be Florence Pugh, Austin Butler, Lea Seydoux and the legendary Christopher Walken.\n\nThis concludes my picks for the most anticipated films of 2023, What are your most anticipated films for this year? Let me know on any of the following platforms: Twitter, Facebook or Letterbox’d.\n\nThanks for reading. Here’s to a great 12 months of cinema!\n\n2021, a year that initially began as 2020 ended, with the cinemas still closed amid a continuing lockdown that kept us at home. New releases were being brought to us through the streaming services, but it was wonderful to see the cinemas finally reopen in May. That feeling of being back in the cinema, watching films where they are meant to be seen, there’s honestly nothing like it. Given that the year saw the release of many films that were pushed back, there were lots of films for cinephiles to enjoy, and so let’s have a look and see what was the best films that 2021 had to offer.\n\nWhenever I compile these end-of-year lists, the aim is always to include films that are listed as 2021 releases on IMDB. Yet, as will probably be the case till the end of time, some films had very staggered release dates. Consequently, there are some films appearing on this list that came out in 2020, but they weren’t available to UK audiences until 2021. Hence, this makes them available for this year’s list. Also, as much as I would want to, I’ve not seen every film that was released this year, so apologies if your favourite is not on here, as I may not have seen it. On the flip side to that, some films featured here that are listed as 2021 releases on IMDB, haven’t yet made their way to UK cinemas. However, as I was able to see some of these at London Film Festival this year, this means they are eligible for inclusion here.\n\nAdditionally, as I say every year, the grades I give the films do not determine the rankings of these films. A film that gets a perfect grade is not guaranteed to be my favourite film of the year. Lists like these are always a chance for the person compiling them to be as biased as they want to be. These are the films that, for me personally, defined 2021 as a strong year for film.\n\nBefore I get into the main list, I must give a shout out to some honourable mentions. These films are excellent that you should definitely check out, but they just didn’t quite make the list:\n\nThe Power of the Dog [review]. 12 years after her last film, Jane Campion returns to the director’s chair for an enthralling Western that focuses less on the cowboys and the shootouts, and more on the tense relationship between two brothers on a 1925 Montana ranch.\n\nEncanto [review] The first, and not the last, film on this list that has the involvement of Lin-Manuel Miranda. Disney celebrated their landmark 60th animated feature film in some style, with a beautifully animated film that depicted a heartfelt story to prove the House of Mouse still has the magic touch.\n\nSpencer [review]. Princess Diana’s story is one that is all too well known. A tragic figure in British history, Pablo Larrain’s unconventional biopic zeroes in on a time when Diana’s marriage to Prince Charles had grown cold. There’s a lot of creative liberties in terms of the story, but it all comes together thanks to an astonishing, transformative Kristen Stewart performance as Diana.\n\nA Quiet Place Part II [review]. The first film that I saw in cinemas when they reopened. John Krasinski returned to the director’s chair to bring us a sequel to one of the most unique horror films of recent years. Recapturing that tension that of the first film was always going to be a tough ask, but Krasinski pulled it off, delivering a sequel that proved to be a worthy follow up to the original, with an incredible performance from Millicent Simmonds.\n\nSpider-Man: No Way Home [review]. Since the pandemic began, there’s arguably not been a film that had quite the level of hype going into it as the concluding chapter to Tom Holland’s Spider-Man trilogy. Where previous Spider-Man sequels failed, this threequel webbed all of its plot threads tremendously well and delivered an extremely satisfying film that should change the MCU as we know it.\n\nHonourable mentions honoured. Now, since we had so many films this year, let’s dive into the top 15…\n\n15. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\n\nreview\n\nIt had been a long time coming, but at long last this year, the MCU made a film that was led by an Asian superhero, alongside a predominantly Asian led cast. A landmark moment, and thanks to the outstanding stunt work, the film brought a unique visual style to the action scenes that are unlike anything that previous MCU films had brought to the table. Thanks to the brilliant performance of Simu Liu in the titular role, a new hero was born. Plus, in Tony Leung’s Wenwu, you have one of the best MCU villains in years.\n\n14. tick, tick… BOOM!\n\nAs time goes by and we hit the later years in life, we begin to feel the pressure of wanting to leave our mark on the world. Taking the truly tragic story of Jonathan Larson and his struggles to craft the missing pieces of the puzzle for a play he’s writing doesn’t sound like the most invigorating combo in concept. But when you have a career-best performance from Andrew Garfield, and the usual catchiness of the songs that Lin-Manuel Miranda pens, and you have an extremely emotionally impactful combination that is beautifully directed by Miranda.\n\n13. In the Heights\n\nreview\n\nContinuing on the subject of Lin-Manuel Miranda, after being delayed by a year due to the pandemic, this Jon. M Chu-directed adaptation of Miranda’s 2005 musical was the much-needed blast of sun-soaked joy that we needed after many months of cinemas being shut. Filled to the brim with a plethora of memorable songs, all of which had a unique visual style to them. The film’s screenplay packed some important changes that made it extremely topical for the political landscape of 2021. In a year that saw a number of musicals, this is the best of them all and further proof that 2021 was the year of Lin-Manuel Miranda supremacy.\n\n12. Belfast\n\nreview coming soon\n\nIn this beautiful semi-autobiographical film, director Kenneth Branagh tells the story about centres on a young boy growing up in the centre of Belfast just as the Troubles were beginning in Northern Ireland. Given that background, it seems unlikely that there’d be much room for humour, but Branagh works it so wonderfully well into his script, and gets awards-worthy performances out of every member of the main cast, especially Jamie Dornan and Catriona Balfe.\n\n11. Raya and the Last Dragon\n\nreview\n\nIn all of the 58 Disney films that preceded this one, they’d never given audiences a heroine of South-Eastern Asian origin. As was the case with Shang-Chi, the film was a ground-breaking moment for representation that had been a long time coming. A lot of lore is packed into the story, but it married that up with an extremely exciting adventure. Plus, in Raya, you have yet another fearless and badass warrior princess that gives young girls a positive role model, and Awkwfinha as the voice of a dragon. One of Disney’s best films in years.\n\nNow for the top 10…\n\n10. No Time to Die\n\nreview\n\nBeing one of the first films to be affected by the pandemic, and being hit with a number of subsequent delays on top of that, it was starting to feel like we’d never get to see Daniel Craig’s final turn as James Bond. But thankfully this Autumn, it was finally released to the world, and it was worth the wait. The film had the extremely difficult task of tying all the loose ends from all of Craig’s previous Bond films, and managing the enormous expectations of the fans beforehand. Thankfully, while it wasn’t all plain sailing, it was mission accomplished with a compelling story that gave one of the best actors to play Bond a memorable final bow, and the send-off he deserved.\n\n9. The Last Duel\n\nreview\n\nCredit where credit is due for Ridley Scott. The veteran director is, at the age of 84, is still producing incredible pieces of cinema. He’s got a history with swords and sandals epic. However, what sets this apart from his previous films in this genre is that this is a medieval epic, with a modern, and very important message. Presenting its story in three distinct acts from a different person’s point of view, the first two acts are compelling and well written. However, it’s not until the third act, that the film truly soars, thanks to the award-worthy performance of Jodie Comer. This is, along with another film in this list, one of the most important films of the Post #MeToo Era of Hollywood, that absolutely did not deserve to be a box office bomb.\n\n8. Sound of Metal\n\nreview\n\nLosing one of your senses would undoubtedly be an extremely traumatic time in your life, especially if one of those senses was integral to your job as a drummer in a band. This is the devastating position that Ruben finds himself in, and must adapt to the changing circumstances of his life. With stunning sound work, the film puts you in Ruben’s (an extraordinary Riz Ahmed) position, and examines how his life will forever be changed by this painful diagnosis. An extraordinary directorial debut from Darius Marder that shines a deserved spotlight on deaf communities across the world.\n\n7. King Richard\n\nreview\n\nSerena and Venus Williams. Two names who need no introduction, as they have established themselves as two of the greatest athletes to have ever lived. What you probably don’t know, is the story of their father, Richard Williams, and the impact he had in shaping their early careers. The parents of any budding young superstar athletes undoubtedly have to work tirelessly to help their children achieve their dreams, and this uplifting family drama takes us on that journey. The film is packed with incredible performances, including an arguably career-best performance from Will Smith as Richard. He’s very ably supported by star-making turns from Saniyya Sidney and Demi Singleton as the young Venus and Serena respectively, likewise for Aunjanue Ellis as their mother Brandi.\n\n6. The Harder They Fall\n\nreview\n\nThe Western genre is one that has so often been dominated by white lead characters. Meanwhile, for any black characters in these films, they are too often reduced to bit-part roles that don’t give them a chance to shine. However, as the words “These. People. Existed.” flash up on the screen at the start of this slick and stylish Western, it is a timely reminder that these people have stories of their own that deserve to be told. Enter Jeymes Samuel, with his feature film directorial debut that puts these characters front and centre.\n\nLooking at what Samuel brings to the table in terms of his cast and the action scenes, it almost defies belief that this is his feature film debut. His passion for the genre comes through with every frame, and with the super talented cast he has at his disposal, it all meshes together tremendously well. An enthralling and much-needed revitalisation of the Western genre.\n\n5. The Mitchells vs. the Machines\n\nreview\n\nTechnology has very much become a crucial aspect of modern life. From computers to mobile phones, it seems every so often we’re bathing our eyes in the blue light of some fanciful gadget. Films have often tackled the seemingly probable eventuality of a robot apocalypse, but what if when said robot uprising begins, humanity’s last hope is in the form of a hilarious, but extremely dysfunctional family? The answer is the latest hilarious film from those animated wizards at Sony Pictures Animation.\n\nFilled to the brim with funny commentary about how dependent we are on our gadgets, the film’s animation brilliantly combines 2D and 3D styles of animation. The voice performances are all first-class, and the film has, hands down, THE best scene involving Furbies that will ever be seen in any film, ever.\n\n4. The Suicide Squad\n\nreview\n\nIt’s fair to say that DC’s first attempt to bring their collection of super villains and mould them into a team of heroes didn’t get the reception and adulation that DC would have wanted. So what do you do to make a second attempt at this crop of characters work? Well, you bring in the guy who turned an obscure collection of Marvel anti-heroes into box office gold, and apply that to DC’s equivalent collection of characters.\n\nWhile the film retains some characters from the 2016 film, it’s very much a soft reboot than a direct sequel. James Gunn brings his unique sense of humour to the story, and this new iteration expertly combines previous fan favourites, such as Harley Quinn, with exciting new recruits like a walking, talking humanoid shark, and a character who’s fond of rats. On paper, it sounds ridiculous but under Gunn’s direction, the end result is glorious and gory comic book movie mayhem.\n\nNow, when it came to the top 3, putting these three films in some kind of order was extremely tough. At one point this year, I had all three of these at #1, and they all would be thoroughly deserving of that spot. If I could have them as a three-way tie for #1, I would. But as they must be ranked, we go on with…\n\n3. Judas and the Black Messiah\n\nreview\n\nThe Civil Rights Movement in the US has seen a number of highly charismatic and influential leaders take a stand and leave their mark on history. The likes of Martin Luther King Jr, Malcolm X, Muhammed Ali are all important figures whose story has been told throughout history. Yet there’s one important figure whose name has seldom been told, but who really should be held in the same breath as these aforementioned historical figures: Fred Hampton Jr.\n\nThe story and film’s message have only become more important and relevant in recent years since events in 2020 forced the world to have an urgent conversation about race relations in the US. LaKeith Stanfield’s leading performance as the FBI informant is incredible. However, it is Daniel Kaluuya’s transformative, Oscar-winning, supporting turn as Hampton himself that cements this biographical historical drama as one of the most important films of the year.\n\n2. Promising Young Woman\n\nreview\n\nEvery so often there is a film that holds up a mirror to our society, that demands us to have a conversation about a particular topic. It’s the power of a truly great film. Not only do they generate a discussion, but they stay with you even after the credits have rolled. This was most definitely applicable for this enthralling directorial debut from Emerald Fennell.\n\nForced to drop out of med school, following a tragic incident involving her best friend, Cassie goes out at night pretending to be drunk, to catch in the act, would be sexual predators who would take advantage of a drunken woman. The film grips with you with the opening act, and only escalates when circumstances present Cassie with an opportunity to take revenge against the person who inflicted all that pain on her years ago. Fennell expertly juxtaposes bright and colourful romantic comedy moments, with the more dark and brutal revenge mission, all while getting a career-best performance from Carey Mulligan.\n\nAnd so my favourite film of 2021 is\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n1. Dune\n\nreview\n\nFor two years running, this was my most anticipated film of the year, and it absolutely delivered on those lofty expectations. Denis Villeneuve has cemented himself as one of, if not, my favourite directors working today. He has consistently delivered incredible films every time, and it was clear from interviews in the build-up to the film’s release just how much of an impact Frank Herbert’s iconic novel had on him growing up. It was said to be an unfilmable book, but Villeneuve absolutely proved everybody wrong.\n\nRight from the off, the film immediately pulls the audience into the world of Arrakis and Dune. Villeneuve brings the visual majesty that he brought to his previous sci-fi works, and with a packed ensemble cast tells an utterly enthralling story, or at least the first part of it. The scope of the novel meant that Villeneuve was able to take his time, and it pays off. Dune very much stands on its own as an enthralling piece of sci-fi storytelling, and it was made for the big screen. Experiencing films like this was an experience that was sorely missed in 2020, and so to get the opportunity to experience this on the biggest screen possible was absolutely special. Plus, the great news is that we’ve Part Two still to come.\n\n————————————————————————————————\n\nAnd that brings the curtain down on my list of the best that film had to offer in 2021. Thank you for reading, especially if you read all the way through! Let’s hope that it won’t be long before the cinemas reopen and we can witness more films on the big screen. What were your favourite films of 2021? Let me know in the comments below or you can find me on the following platforms: Twitter, Facebook or Letterbox’d.\n\nFor my picks for my most anticipated films of 2022, please click here.\n\nAnother awards season is now coming to a close, and every year it comes by, there always seems to be some kind of controversy attached to it. This year is no different, having given us one of the most divisive movies in a long time in Joker. Yet said film has lead the way with the most nominations (11). Furthermore, there has been a notable lack of diversity in the acting nominations, just barely avoiding another #OscarsSoWhite situation, and much like the Golden Globes and the BAFTAs, a distinct lack of women in the director category, in spite of some truly excellent films made by women.\n\nWhile it’s crystal clear that some work needs to be done on those matters, it has been a very strong year to round out the 2010s on the big screen and once again, there are 24 golden statues to give out. So who will be clutching one of those 24 golden statues that are on offer? Time to have a gaze at my metaphorical crystal ball and give my predictions, as well as give my own two cents on each category, minus the documentaries and the short films.\n\nBest Actress in a Leading Role\n\nCynthia Erivo – Harriet\n\nScarlett Johansson – Marriage Story\n\nSaoirse Ronan – Little Women\n\nCharlize Theron – Bombshell\n\nRenée Zellweger – Judy\n\nLast year, Olivia Colman unexpectedly (but very happily) took the statue ahead of strong favourite Glenn Close. This year, Renee Zellweger’s performance as Judy Garland has been sweeping all before her, so a triumph for her seems certain. However, her likely win is frustrating given that her performance was easily the best thing about an otherwise bland/forgettable biopic.\n\nJohansson has become the first actor to be nominated in lead and supporting since 2007, and her work in Marriage Story was arguably a career best. Charlize Theron was on reliably excellent form in Bombshell, Saorise Ronan’s excellent performance in Little Women has ensured she has very impressively chalked up a fourth nomination at the age of 25. While it is embarrassing that Cynthia Erivo is the only person of colour to get nominated, her performance as the inspirational civil rights icon Harriet Tubman was more than deserving of recognition, as was Awkwafina whose heart-wrenching performance in The Farewell was snubbed.\n\nWhat’s more, the Academy’s refusal to give horror films a look in is baffling when two of the best performances by women in leading roles came from Florence Pugh (Midsommar) and especially Lupita Nyong’o (Us), the latter of whom’s extraordinary dual performance really wipes the floor with the likely winner, and the fact it’s not in the conversation at all, is just mind-boggling.\n\nWill Win: Renée Zellweger\n\nShould Win: Scarlett Johansson\n\nShould have been nominated: Lupita Nyong’o for Us/ Florence Pugh for Midsommar/ Awkwafina for The Farewell\n\nBest Actor in a Leading Role\n\nAntonio Banderas – Pain and Glory\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio – Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\n\nAdam Driver – Marriage Story\n\nJoaquin Phoenix – Joker\n\nJonathan Pryce – The Two Popes\n\nIt seems a sure bet The Academy will ensure that Joaquin Phoenix becomes the second actor to win an Oscar for playing the Joker, eleven years after Heath Ledger’s posthumous win in 2009. Despite the backlash in some quarters to the film, his performance has been widely recognised as its main strength. Though he’s got some considerable competition, most notably from Adam Driver’s heart-breaking work in Marriage Story, likewise for Antonio Banderas’s very personal performance in Pain & Glory. Jonathan Pryce’s nomination came as a mighty surprise, especially given the bemusing absence of Robert De Niro, who gave his best performance in years that was more than worthy of recognition.\n\nIn an ideal world, this would be Driver’s trophy but Phoenix will have the last laugh here.\n\nWill Win: Joaquin Phoenix\n\nShould Win: Adam Driver\n\nShould have been nominated: Robert De Niro for The Irishman\n\nBest Supporting Actress\n\nKathy Bates – Richard Jewell\n\nLaura Dern – Marriage Story\n\nScarlett Johansson – Jojo Rabbit\n\nFlorence Pugh – Little Women\n\nMargot Robbie – Bombshell\n\nBy far and away, one of the biggest snubs when the nominations were announced was the absence of Jennifer Lopez in this category for her stunning work in Hustlers. Given that she was nominated for pretty much every other awards show going, it was a massive surprise to see her not nominated. 2019 was the year that Florence Pugh truly made a name for herself. It’s worth reiterating that her outstanding work in Midsommar was worthy of a nomination. However, it is pleasing to see that in the year she made a name for herself, she’s duly rewarded with a well deserved Oscar nomination. Johansson had a small, but extremely effective part in Jojo Rabbit, which served as the emotional core of Taika Waititi’s film.\n\nBut like the other two acting awards, this has got Laura Dern’s name on it. To make a divorce lawyer a likeable character is quite the skill and it will ensure that she ends her long wait for Oscar gold.\n\nWill Win: Laura Dern\n\nShould Win: Laura Dern\n\nCould have been nominated: Jennifer Lopez for Hustlers or Zhao Shuzhen for The Farewell\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nTom Hanks – A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood\n\nAnthony Hopkins – The Two Popes\n\nAl Pacino – The Irishman\n\nJoe Pesci – The Irishman\n\nBrad Pitt – Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\n\nThe fourth and final acting award of the night, and again it is looking another lock, this time for Brad Pitt’s incredible work in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. There’s definitely some dark history attached to this character, but Pitt’s charm and charisma is so effortless that along with Leo DiCaprio, he’s so much fun to watch. To see Joe Pesci come out of retirement for Martin Scorsese’s gangster masterpiece was just wonderful to behold, and alongside Al Pacino, they made an effective compelling trio of powerful performances in Scorsese’s gangster epic. Tom Hanks’s first Oscar nomination in 19 years was long overdue, and while he made for a perfect Fred Rogers, this is Pitt’s trophy to lose.\n\nWill Win: Brad Pitt\n\nShould Win: Al Pacino/Joe Pesci (can’t split them)\n\nShould have been nominated: Jamie Foxx for Just Mercy or Song-Kang-ho for Parasite\n\nBest Director\n\nMartin Scorsese – The Irishman\n\nTodd Phillips – Joker\n\nSam Mendes – 1917\n\nQuentin Tarantino – Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\n\nBong Joon-ho – Parasite\n\nLike with BAFTA and the Golden Globes, the best director category is, rather disappointingly, another all male affair. When you consider some of the films that were made by women, is extremely disappointing. The films made by these men are (mostly) great (looking at you Todd Phillips) but when you have the likes of Greta Gerwig, Marielle Heller or Lulu Wang or heck even Olivia Wilde, get shut out, it is deeply frustrating. It makes you wonder what these directors have to do to break down that barrier.\n\nHowever, of the five to get nominated, by far the one that stands out the most is the work of Sam Mendes and the stunning work that is done to make 1917 such an immersive experience that puts you on the ground with these men. Bong Joon-ho is definitely a threat to Mendes due to his breath-taking work with Parasite, but a second Oscar for Mendes would be a fitting way to celebrate what is one of his finest films.\n\nWill Win: Sam Mendes\n\nShould Win: Sam Mendes\n\nShould have been nominated: Greta Gerwig for Little Women or Lulu Wang for The Farewell\n\nBest Original Screenplay\n\nKnives Out – Rian Johnson\n\nMarriage Story – Noah Baumbach\n\n1917 – Sam Mendes and Krysty Wilson-Cairns\n\nOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood – Quentin Tarantino\n\nParasite – Bong Joon-ho and Han Jin-won\n\nFive extremely strong screenplays competing here, but given that four of the five are Best Picture nominees, Knives Out‘s chances of an upset are sadly slim to none. Given the criticisms in some quarters of 1917’s screenplay, it seems unlikely to add to its probable slew of Oscar wins in the technical categories. Noah Baumbach could yet pull off an upset to add to Marriage Story’s Supporting Actress win, but this seems to be a race between OUATIH and Parasite. Tarantino has twice won this Oscar twice before, and a hat-trick is definitely possible, but it likely won’t be the case. While Parasite is a surefire bet to win Best International Feature, this should be Bong Joon ho’s richly deserved moment in the spotlight.\n\nWill Win: Bong Joon-ho "
