        "text": "On a small island off the coast of China, Nick Nack, a little person, delivers champagne to Scaramanga, a man with three nipples, and his girlfriend, Andrea. Rodney, an assassin, arrives on a small boat, and Nick Nack leads him inside Scaramanga’s lavish beach house, handing him an envelope filled with cash. Scaramanga spots Rodney, wielding a gun. The lights turn off, and Scaramanga runs as Rodney opens fire. Nick Nack speaks to Rodney via a microphone in a control room, where he operates light and sound effects that distract the killer. Nick Nack watches Rodney on a television monitor as he moves through the house, encountering armed wax figures, and teases Scaramanga, asking where he thinks his gun might be. Scaramanga sees his golden gun on a pedestal then presses a button and a set of stairs turns into a ramp. As Rodney shoots, Scaramanga slides down the ramp, retrieves his gun, and shoots his foe dead. The lights turn back on, revealing a wax figure modeled after British espionage agent James Bond, otherwise known as “007.” Nick Nack congratulates his boss and retrieves the money. In London, England, Bond reports to his superior, “M,” and agents Colthorpe and “Q.” M asks 007 about Scaramanga, and Bond replies that he is an assassin who uses a golden gun and golden bullets, and can be identified by his third nipple. M presents a golden bullet, recently sent to the agency, engraved with “007” and marked by Scaramanga’s fingerprint, suggesting that Scaramanga has been hired to kill Bond. Believing Scaramanga’s mission to kill Bond will compromise 007’s search for Gibson, a man who possesses information on “solar cells,” M suggests he take a sabbatical, but Bond intends to find Scaramanga instead. Outside M’s office, Bond asks the secretary, Moneypenny, where Scaramanga killed Bill Fairbanks, aka “Agent 002.” Moneypenny says he was in Beirut, Lebanon, at a cabaret with a woman named Saida, but Scaramanga could never be confirmed as 002’s killer because the bullet was not found. In Beirut, Bond watches Saida belly dance and visits her dressing room after the performance. Saida admits she took the bullet that killed 002 and never dances without it. They kiss and Bond moves down her body, finding the bullet in her belly button. Three thugs enter the room and attack Bond, who accidentally swallows the bullet. He fights the men off and takes a taxi to the nearest pharmacy. Later, at a lab, Colthorpe and M examine the bullet Bond swallowed and agree it was most likely made by a Portugese man named Lazar. In Macau, China, Bond follows Lazar to the basement of his shop, holds him at gunpoint, and demands information about Scaramanga. Lazar confesses that he has orders to drop Scaramanga’s latest batch of golden bullets at a nearby casino. There, Bond observes as Scaramanga’s girlfriend, Andrea, takes the bullets. He follows her onto a ferryboat to Hong Kong, China. When they arrive, Andrea steals into a car and Bond’s associate, Goodnight, picks him up. They follow Andrea to the Peninsula Hotel, where Bond bribes a bellhop for Andrea’s room number, and Goodnight suspects he plans to sleep with the woman. Before she drives away, Bond promises Goodnight he will meet her for dinner. Inside, the agent coerces another bellhop to open the door to Andrea’s room and sneaks in while she takes a shower. Bond greets Andrea as she steps out of the shower holding a gun. Demanding her robe, Andrea forces Bond into the bedroom but he knocks the gun from her hand. Andrea tells Bond that Scaramanga will be at the Bottoms Up strip club that evening and provides a physical description of the assassin. Later, as Bond loiters outside the Bottoms Up, Scaramanga observes him from a second-story window but shoots another man instead. A policeman on the scene searches Bond, finds his gun, and arrests him, leading him to a boat. Speeding through the ocean, Bond escapes the police boat and jumps onto a wrecked ship. There, a British officer appears and explains the shipwreck has been outfitted as a command center for British intelligence. Q and M, seated alongside a man named Professor Frazier, greet Bond. Lieutenant Hip, the man who arrested Bond, arrives soon after and explains that he was saving the agent from arrest by actual Hong Kong police. Bond informs the men that Scaramanga shot Gibson, the solar energy expert, outside the club. Hip, who met with Gibson earlier, says the scientist wanted immunity and suggested a second meeting in Bangkok, Thailand, where he was working with Hai Fat, a powerful businessman. He says Gibson revealed the Solex Agitator, a mechanism used to convert solar energy into electricity, but laments that it went missing after the man was shot. Bond wonders if Hai Fat hired Scaramanga to kill Gibson and develops a scheme to infiltrate Hai Fat’s heavily guarded headquarters, believing the businessman has never seen Scaramanga. In Bangkok, Bond sneaks onto Hai Fat’s property and introduces himself as Scaramanga, revealing a prosthetic third nipple. The men discuss the threat of “James Bond,” and Hai Fat extends a dinner invitation for that evening. Nearby, Scaramanga watches through binoculars as Hip drives Bond away. That night, Bond returns and two sumo wrestlers attack him outside Hai Fat’s house. Nick Nack ambushes Bond, wielding a pitchfork, but Hai Fat stops him from spearing the agent. Bond regains consciousness at a martial arts training center, where a student challenges him to a fight before an audience. Bond kicks the fighter down within seconds, and another student, Chula, takes his place. Bond runs away when Chula is momentarily down and reunites with Hip, along with Hip’s two nieces, outside the training center. Students emerge from the school and Bond watches as Hip and his nieces fight them off. Driving away, Hip accidentally leaves Bond behind, and the agent hijacks a speedboat on a nearby river. When the boat’s engine fails, a young peddler jumps in and fixes it, allowing Bond to speed away moments before the martial arts students overtake him. At his estate, Hai Fat gives the Solex Agitator to Scaramanga, instructing him to return it to a plant and remain there until further orders. Scaramanga discreetly assembles his golden gun at Hai Fat’s desk and shoots him dead. That evening, Bond finds Goodnight in his hotel room and they begin to make love but are interrupted when Andrea breaks in. Bond hides Goodnight in the closet and seduces Andrea, who admits she sent the golden bullet with “007” to London in order to get his attention. Andrea asks Bond to kill Scaramanga, and Bond promises he will in exchange for the Solex Agitator. Soon after, at a Thai boxing match, Bond finds Andrea in the stands but realizes she is dead, having been shot in the chest. Scaramanga sits beside Bond, introduces himself, and confesses to killing Andrea. As Nick Nack appears, pointing a gun at him, Bond sees the Solex Agitator on the ground. When Hip arrives, posing as a peanut seller, Bond pretends to drop something, retrieves the Solex Agitator, and drops it in Hip’s box as he pays for a bag of nuts. Outside the arena, Hip hands the mechanism to Goodnight, informing her that a midget is holding Bond at gunpoint and instructing her to call the police. Meanwhile, Scaramanga leaves the stands, warning Bond not to follow him. Outside, Goodnight spots Nick Nack and follows him. As he gets into a car, Goodnight pries the trunk open and places a tracking device inside. However, Scaramanga arrives and shoves her inside. Bond contacts Goodnight via walkie-talkie and learns she is locked inside Scaramanga’s trunk. While Hip tries to hail a taxi, Bond steals a car from a nearby auto seller, only to find an American tourist, J. W. Pepper, inside. After Bond crashes the car through a storefront in pursuit of Scaramanga, Pepper recognizes him as a famous secret agent. Thai police follow as Bond speeds through the streets. Having missed a turn, Bond uses a broken bridge as a ramp and jumps the car over a river. Outside a hangar, Bond tries a locked door, and Thai police arrive. Pepper proudly announces himself as a Louisiana police sheriff and produces his badge, but the police arrest him as the engine of a plane sounds from inside the hangar. A large door opens and Scaramanga’s car emerges with a modified plane attached to the top. Later, Bond informs M and Q that he and Hip found the car-plane 200 miles away, abandoned, and Scaramanga still has Goodnight and the Solex Agitator. A British officer produces a map, informing the agents that Goodnight’s location has been tracked to a group of small islands off the Chinese coast. As Bond flies a seaplane to Scaramanga’s island complex, the assassin receives word that he is approaching. On the shore, Scaramanga greets him and leads him inside, revealing a room of generators that convert solar energy. He reveals plans to sell Solex technology to the highest bidder and shows Bond the central mechanism from which the Solex agitator operates. A large door opens, revealing solar panels placed atop a large boulder outside. Scaramanga demonstrates his ability to redirect the solar power, using a laser to blow up Bond’s seaplane. Nick Nack announces lunch and Scaramanga leads Bond upstairs where Goodnight joins them. Soon after, Scaramanga challenges Bond to a duel. On the beach, Nick Nack counts as Bond and Scaramanga take steps away from each other. At twenty, Bond turns and shoots, but Scaramanga has disappeared. Nick Nack points Bond to the house then rushes to the control room to lower the lights and activate special effects. Inside, Bond navigates through obstacles, eventually finding Scaramanga in the room filled with mirrors. There, Bond shoots Scaramanga dead after posing as his own wax figure. In the solar power room, Goodnight knocks a maintenance man into a vat of liquid helium and escapes. After they reunite, Goodnight tells Bond about the maintenance man and he realizes the body will soon cause the liquid helium to overheat and explode. Bond rushes to remove the Solex Agitator, but Goodnight accidentally presses a button, causing the laser to activate. When the sun passes behind a cloud, the solar panel deactivates long enough for Bond to remove the mechanism, and they escape moments before explosions destroy the complex. Outside, Goodnight leads Bond to Scaramanga’s ship. As they sail away, Bond makes love to Goodnight in a bedroom below deck. However, Goodnight opens her eyes and sees Nick Nack descending upon the bed, wielding a knife. Bond fights off Nick Nack, takes him up to the deck, and hangs him in a net attached to the mast. M calls Bond on the ship to congratulate him."
