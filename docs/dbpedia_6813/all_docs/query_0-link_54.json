        "text": "WHILE filming his new movie 1917, British director Sam Mendes wanted his cast to read up on the hell endured by World War One soldiers.\n\nSo actor Dean-Charles Chapman began poring over diaries from the Western Front, and became fascinated by the account of machine gunner David Peers, who had been shot through the hip and survived in agony for days behind enemy lines.\n\nMost of his battalion had been killed or wounded or were missing, with 20-year-old Private Peers paralysed in both legs.\n\nHe survived by dragging himself through the mud and drinking from the water bottles of his fallen comrades.\n\nAfter four days of bone-crunching pain, he thought salvation had come when a German soldier found him. But as he begged for help, the German simply spat — then left him for dead.\n\nRemarkably, as Dean-Charles read the memoir it gradually dawned on him that the account was about his own great, great grandfather. And today The Sun brings his full story for the first time.\n\nThe actor plays L/Cpl Tom Blake in the movie, which this week won two of the biggest awards at the Golden Globes — for best picture and best director for Sir Sam.\n\nAlso starring Andrew Scott, Benedict Cumberbatch, Richard Madden and Colin Firth, the film is also nominated for NINE Baftas including best picture and best director.\n\nCritics are now tipping it as a surefire contender for Oscar nominations when these are revealed on Monday.\n\nDean-Charles, 22, recalled his family discovery: “I read that book pretty much every day before I walked out on set.\n\n“It was only after I spoke to my mum and dad, who then spoke to their parents, that it became clear that my great, great grandad had an entry in it.”\n\nBecause of filming commitments, Dean-Charles, who shot to fame in 2014 as young king Tommen Baratheon in Game Of Thrones, has not had time to investigate properly his ancestor’s remarkable wartime ordeal in the Battle of Loos.\n\nSo, with the help of World War One historian Jon Cooksey, whose expertise has been used by TV’s Who Do You Think You Are?, The Sun has exclusively pieced together the incredible story of the hero whose great, great grandson became one of the stars of the best war movie since Saving Private Ryan.\n\nIn the film — out this Friday — Dean-Charles and George MacKay play two lance corporals who must race across rat-infested, corpse-strewn no man’s land, braving bombs and water-filled craters to deliver a message that will save the lives of 1,600 British soldiers.\n\nDuring filming on Salisbury Plain, Wilts, Dean-Charles read The Western Front Diaries, by Australian author Jonathan King.\n\nIt includes the story of Pte Peers. The apprentice fitter joined his home regiment, the Territorials, in Grimsby in early summer 1914, two months before the war broke out.\n\nWith the 5th Battalion the Lincolnshire Regiment, he landed in France in March 1915 and saw action at Ypres before being sent south to the French coalfields near Bethune, where the British had suffered thousands of casualties.\n\nThe North Midlands “Terriers” of the 46th Division — including the 5th Lincs — were chosen to go over the top and retake a German stronghold known as the Hohenzollern Redoubt.\n\nAt 2pm on October 13, as a two-hour bombardment ended, Pte Peers and more than 600 of his comrades showed the greatest bravery as they rushed to attack the Germans in hand-to-hand combat.\n\nJon Cooksey says: “The 5th Lincs were caught in a deadly crossfire from machine guns to their north and to their south from German positions.\n\n“Their casualties were extremely heavy. All but two of the officers who went over the top were killed or went missing, leaving the battalion effectively leaderless.\n\n“Out of 659 men from the 5th Lincs who went into action, 483 were killed, wounded or missing. That’s a 73 per cent casualty rate.\n\n“Among the 217 men counted as missing was Pte Peers, although thankfully he was still alive.\n\n“He had gone over the top as one of about 18 men in the battalion’s machine gun section but was severely wounded during the attack by a bullet that went into his right side and exited on the left.\n\n“As it travelled through his body it caught his spinal cord, which left him paralysed from the waist down.”\n\nA report of the battle in his local Grimsby paper at the time reveals how Pte Peers survived by drinking from water bottles on the bodies of his fallen pals.\n\nLater he told the Red Cross how he had been found alive by an enemy soldier, days after the fighting had ended.\n\nPte Peers said: “I was lying out for four days until I was found by a young German officer who said to me, ‘Englander?’ And when I said, ‘Yes’, he spat on the ground and said, ‘Swine’. Then his superior officer came up and treated me well.”\n\nThe local paper’s report reveals how Pte Peers had begged the German soldier who found him to, ‘get someone to finish him off’.\n\nInstead, the officer sent him to a field hospital about a mile behind enemy lines.\n\nPte Peers’s entry in the Western Front Diaries reveals how there were no nurses at the hospital in Phalempin, near Lille.\n\nMilitary orderlies took his clothes away and refused to attend to his paralysis.\n\nPte Peers was surrounded by dying comrades but he survived, though still in agony and desperate for food.\n\nOn November 5 he was laid on the bare floor of a third-class railway carriage and taken on a bumpy overnight train journey to hospital in Aachen, Germany.\n\nAgainst all the odds, he survived this new ordeal and was transferred to a prisoner of war camp hospital in Cologne.\n\nThere, a sergeant who spoke a little English asked if Pte Peers wanted to stay in Germany after the war and to sign papers to make him a naturalised German.\n\nThe outraged Tommy said: “I refused and the sergeant told me I was a fool as I would have got my liberty if I had signed.”\n\nBut six months after the attack, and still paralysed, he was put on a prisoner-exchange train to Brussels and finally arrived at the Queen Alexandra Military Hospital in Millbank, central London, in May 1916.\n\nPte Peers was transferred to Ralston Hospital in Glasgow, where he was discharged, given a weekly disability pension of 40 shillings (£2) and a silver war badge which wounded servicemen wore to show they had done their bit at the Front.\n\nNow out of the Army, David, permanently paralysed from the waist down and classed as “100 per cent disabled”, got married to Kathleen in 1917.\n\nTen years after the battle that nearly killed him, he landed a job making Remembrance wreaths at the poppy factory in Richmond, South West London.\n\nHe and wife had six children and the ex-Tommy died in 1935, aged just 40. Four years later their 18-year-old daughter, Evelyn Ruby, married Sidney Chapman, 22.\n\nThree generations later, Sir Sam Mendes gave their great grandson the role of a lifetime in his epic war movie.\n\nDean-Charles said: “Just reading snippets of the story of my great, great grandfather and knowing I had an ancestor who was there made me feel so much more connected to Blake.”\n\nAnd thanks to The Sun’s research, Dean-Charles now knows the full account of his ancestor’s extraordinary story of survival and heroism.\n\n1917 is in cinemas from Friday."
