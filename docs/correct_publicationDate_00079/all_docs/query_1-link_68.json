        "text": "I am reposting my journal from my trip to Sierra Leone over last winter’s break. If you’ve read it already, you might be interested in the epilogue that I’m adding to the end.\n\nDecember 26, 2018 – January 6, 2019\n\nWhen I applied for TransAtlantic Histories, the Gilder Lehrman Center for the Study of Slavery, Resistance, and Abolition program connecting American teachers with African teachers, I initially thought about applying for its South Africa cohort. After all, I studied Apartheid extensively in college, writing a 50-page paper on the subject of the generation of leadership that rose in the 1950s. I’ve always wanted to visit South Africa but the odds of me getting to go on a teacher’s salary are extremely long. But when I thought about how difficult it would be to connect the subject matter with my US I course — and thought about the long flight and timing of the trip in the summer — Sierra Leone became more attractive. Having served as the hub of the slave trade in the 18th century, the connections were obvious. And the timing of the trip over winter break was more convenient. Yale University hosts the Center, and everyone other than me was from the greater New Haven area. Several meetings were held on Tuesday nights throughout the year. In order for me to participate, I realized that driving after school would be a non-starter as I’d hit rush hour traffic in and around New York City. Instead I arranged to take half days, depart the school around noon and get to New Haven by 3 pm. With time to kill I’d visit one of the highly recommended apizza restaurants before heading to the campus where I’d grade papers or lesson plan until the time of the meeting. The lectures were quite good, but the drives back were exhausting. Still I knew it’d be worth the opportunity to visit Sierra Leone.\n\nChristmas evening I got a call from Tom Thurston, the leader and organizer of the trip, alerting me to the news that somehow we had been moved from our evening flight to an afternoon flight. It was no problem, but it meant an extra four or so hours at Charles de Gaulle Airport while we waited for our connecting flight. Or so we thought. The one nice thing about being at the French airport was the chance to buy some delicious French bread and pastries. As it turned out, our flight was delayed three or four times. We even had to switch terminals and go back through security. I think we were in CDG for something like 12 hours in total. As we watched people board we noticed many of them had 2, 3 or 4 bags when the limitations are one carry-on and a personal item. The first batch of people seemed to get past the boarding area without having their larger items flagged, but eventually the airline personnel started making people check the larger bags. Yet they still seemed to be allowing on too much carry-on luggage. By the time we got on board, it was extraordinarily difficult finding places to stow our luggage. Some people had to have their bags checked at this point — but only after making their way to the back of the plane. It took about an hour for them to get all the luggage into the luggage bay. At one point they explained this was the cause of the delay, that they were having trouble fitting everything in. (We shall return to this issue.) Then we waited another 45 minutes to take off as next up the wings had to be de-iced. Some of the passengers were quite vocal about their anger, which only seemed to be stoked each time the pilot got on the PA to apologize for the delay.\n\nOur actual flight to Sierra Leone was fairly uneventful once we were in the air, that is until we landed. We got out of the plane and could see the terminal a few hundred yards away. Only we weren’t allowed to walk to the terminal, we had to board a bus, wait until it filled up, and then it brought us to the terminal. It look a little while to get through customs, of course. Keep in mind, that I don’t really sleep on planes, and only managed an hour or so dozing on a bench at the airport. It was coming up on two full days with almost no sleep. Once we go through security, we headed to the two luggage carousels which by this point were mobbed by Sierra Leonians with luggage carts. There’s maybe ten feet on either side of the carousels, and almost everyone crammed into the space had a luggage cart along with all of their carry-on items. After 20 minutes of waiting, someone came out and told us that they were having trouble opening the luggage bay. Apparently it was stuck, perhaps because too much luggage had been crammed into it? We ended up waiting two hours before getting our bags.\n\nWe then made our way out of the airport which led us into a crowd that seemed a bit like a free-for-all. People jockeyed for the chance to taxi or bus us somewhere, but we had to arrange for our luggage to be brought to a boat first. This seemed to take another 30 minutes before we were able to board a bus which took us to a pier. Another half hour went by before the boat arrived (now around 5 am local time). The crowd massed onto the dock with lots of shouting about people with the lowest numbers thinking they had the right to get to the front of the line, but none of the workers seeming to be paying attention to that claim. They let 20 or so people past the check-in point at a time and all the way down the pier to board the boat. Once aboard the boat I dozed in and out due to pure exhaustion while Britain’s Got Talent aired on a TV/VCR combo to keep us in a state of distraction. I guess the trip across the bay was another 40 minutes, but it was hard to tell.\n\nNext we came to the Freetown dock, got out and located our larger luggage. We loaded up three huge carts and waited while the mass of people with less luggage squeezed past us. Once we got outside, we were faced with a steep hill and told the bus was up the road a bit. The road itself was riddled with potholes, making it extra difficult to drag luggage up to the bus. Eventually Joe Opala, who had joined us in France, and had lived in Sierra Leone for most of the last four decades, went back down to the station to pay some young men to bring up the rest of the luggage and load the extra boxes and bags into a station wagon (once the back of the bus was full).\n\nDuring the drive to the hotel I got my first glimpse of the city. The main streets were paved, but many of the side streets were dirt. Along the side of the roads were small, ruggedly constructed kiosks where goods were sold. These often had tin roofs and sometimes were hard to distinguish from housing which usually was set back a little bit further from the road. Pedestrians would often be seen carrying large objects on their head. Most commonly, they carried buckets filled with products that they were selling or just transporting. Often they didn’t use their hands to balance these objects. I noted that many of them had kind of a pad that they used atop their head to help with the balance. Some of the efforts they made seemed Herculean. Considering that there were rarely sidewalks and the pavement itself was often broken up, the ability to balance anything on one’s head seemed beyond anything I could imagine. In addition, stray dogs were just about everywhere. In my travels, the dogs were understandably wary of people. I only got to pet one, an adorable little puppy living with a family in what felt like the middle of nowhere.\n\nMaybe twenty minutes later we arrived at the Hotel Barmoi, located down a cratered street and behind barbed wire-topped fences. The security patrol opened the gate to let the bus squeeze its way in. We made our way into the lobby after unloading the bus, desperate to get into our rooms to get a few hours sleep. Because of all of the delays half of the first day’s activities were canceled and we’d have a chance to get 4 or 5 hours sleep. They couldn’t find a sheet of paper with my rooming information on it, but I noticed a list that said I was in room 11. I pointed it out, but they couldn’t find the room key. After a couple of minutes, perhaps taking pity on me, one of the clerks gave me the key to room 7. With delight, I discovered room 7 had views of the ocean… and appeared to be a single instead of the double I was expecting. The air conditioning worked (did I mention it was about 90 degrees and humid?), and the shower had a decent flow. I very quickly unpacked, something I always do to help me relax in my new “home,” jumped in the shower, and then climbed into bed, falling into a deep slumber.\n\nUNTIL THE PHONE RANG. Actually I don’t remember the phone ringing, I just came to consciousness with a phone in my hand and someone talking in my ear. I heard, “I will send someone up to get your bags.” What? “Someone is going to get your bags and bring them to your room.” Huh? “You are supposed to be in room 11.” I quickly repacked my bags and brought them down myself, ready to kill someone. They gave me the key to room 11, which no longer was on the side of the hotel that could see the ocean. I then met my roommate Emmanuel Thomas. I shook his hand awkwardly, not realizing that the typical Sierra Leone handshake has at least three permutations before letting go, but I’d probably managed to give him an unfriendly impression by disengaging after the initial conventional handshake. I told him, “I’m sorry, but I desperately need to get some sleep,” also probably giving him a poor early impression. I climbed into bed and managed to get about two hours sleep before it was time for us to go out to a restaurant in Freetown where we got to have a grilled fish with spicy jollof rice and an onion and beef side sauce. It was absolutely delicious, but beyond my normal ability to take heat. A good meal helped lift my mood, though, and we re-boarded the bus.\n\nNext we visited the Fourah Bay College in Freetown. We drove through the bustling streets of Freetown where ramshackle structures lined the streets, selling various foods, drinks, and sundries. Ads for two mobile telephone companies were pretty much everywhere in Freetown. Also visible, unfortunately, were large piles of garbage, often dominated by empty plastic bottles. Urban poverty was plainly visible everywhere, but so was the significant industry of the people. As we became acquainted with our teacher counterparts, their pride in their people and country, as well as their determination to achieve a better future became increasingly evident.\n\nRunning water existed in the hotel, but there were numerous times where the toilet wouldn’t flush a second time, and the shower in my new room was barely more than a trickle. I would eventually find out that the truck in the parking lot was a water truck, which would fill up a tank on the roof of the hotel several times a day.\n\nOn the first day, I exchanged a $100 bill for Sierra Leonean money. The exchange rate was 8,300 Leones. The only bills that were in regular circulation were 5,000 and 10,000 Leone notes, so the pile of bills we got for a $100 were enormous. Evidently there are no bills larger than 10,000 and it was only late in the trip that I saw a 1,000 Leone note. Credit cards were accepted in a few locations, but we were advised that those places might have difficulty connecting to the credit card company. When Tom had to pay for dinner for the whole group, he’d take out stacks and stacks of bills from his Hermione’s backpack.\n\nSpicy food makes me drink a lot — and both tend to make me have to pee frequently. I found a bathroom in the building at the college and discovered the first of many toilets that were not connected to running water. Instead one had to flush the toilet by pouring water from a nearby bucket into the toilet. I’ve always been kind of grossed out by public toilets even in good conditions, so this was pretty rough for me. The hotel bathroom did have running water (although from a tank atop the hotel that needed daily refilling), though often times the water would run out, sometimes at inopportune moments. That’s all I’ll say about that…\n\nThe first lecture took place at the college from Joe Opala. I struggled mightily to stay awake (because of the exhaustion, not the lecture) and decided I’d take scrupulous notes to keep myself awake. I was in an unusual position compared to some of my American peers in that the material that connects to what I teach in my classes was frontloaded to the first couple of days — specifically the slave trade. It was perhaps the most relevant lecture of the entire program for me, but at one point I fell asleep in the middle of writing a word and my pen ran across the page in comedic fashion. When I saw some of the other Americans struggling, including our group organizer, I gave in, pushed back from the table and dozed for the last portion of the lecture. A few key tidbits, the Sierra Leone River is a natural harbor, the third largest in the world. Bunce Island, which we’ll get to shortly is 17 miles inland to shelter it from foreign attack. Despite this location it was actually destroyed four times by the French, but the British kept rebuilding it between 1670 and 1807. In Joe’s words, the slave trade for a time was about four things: sugar, sugar, sugar, and other crops.\n\nMy memories of the next four days are somewhat jumbled outside of the visit to Bunce Island, which I’ll share in detail in a moment. We had dinner at the hotel the first night (I had a shrimp dish which was good, although a little odd how it was served). Not that we were in any rush, but it basically took two hours for our food to be prepared, and even when the food came out there were always people waiting for their meals for quite some time. I gathered the kitchen wasn’t large, but we repeatedly told them, “Don’t worry about bringing the food out all together, just bring it out as it gets cooked,” but nothing changed whether we were eating as a full group or individually at lunch or dinner. Breakfasts were buffet style with eggs to order, which was nice. The coffee was basically Nescafe, which was strange, but I got used to it. They did heat up the milk which was a nice touch. On the final morning, we left super early. The kitchen was nice enough to make us egg sandwiches to go and had coffee ready for us, but they didn’t have milk ready, so I drank it without milk and was shocked that it was drinkable (for me). Probably due to the strange flavor of the coffee. But ultimately we weren’t there for the quality hotel service, this trip as about learning about Sierra Leone, interacting with our peers, and hopefully building something for the future.\n\nOur trip to Bunce Island was a very powerful experience. We were led by Joe Opala, who had spent a big chunk of his life exploring the island as a historian and anthropologist, and making connections between the slave castle there and the Gullah community in South Carolina. He had covered a lot of the background in his first lecture, but perhaps realizing how tired we were then repeated a few key things as we walked around the remains of the slave castle. He explained how a series of four British companies had controlled the island, some had been chartered by the crown, others as private investors. The specifics didn’t really strike me as critically important as my focus in class would not be on the intricacies of the succession of control here. A large percentage of the enslaved people who were at Bunce Island ended up in Charleston, South Carolina because of their expertise in growing rice. When slave merchants came to the island, the chief agent would entertain them in a study with a faux fireplace (gotta look like home, I guess), with a window overlooking the area where slaves would be kept — naked, chained in groups of ten. There were separate areas for the men and women/children. The walls were not very high, but it would be impossible for them to scale the wall while chained to one another — and there was nowhere for them to go as they were on an island with crocodiles nearby.\n\nThe experience on Bunce Island was haunting. To trod where so many unfortunate souls had been was a rather sobering experience. And to do it along with teachers from Sierra Leone and several African-American teachers added somewhat to the experience. I was curious about their reactions and probably not surprisingly saw a wide variety of responses. One of the Sierra Leonean teachers had avoided going to the island up to this point because he was ill-at-ease on the water, but he felt it was important to be with the group. Some of my peers grew particularly quiet, while others did not outwardly show any profound impact. We all react differently in this sort of situation, and perhaps process things on our own timelines.\n\nIn his lecture from the first day, Joe talked about gromettos, free Africans who worked for the slave trade companies, living on Bunce Island, among other places. One slave ship arrived in Florida staffed by only two white men and a much larger number of gromettos. The comparison to sepoys and kapos occurred to me immediately, as well as the question students often ask about why “they” enslaved “each other.” It is always one of the most challenging tasks to make American students recognize that while we may simplistically lump all Africans (or Native Americans) together, that they had as many differences as Europeans did, if not more. As Joe put it, “African” wasn’t a concept at the time.\n\nSierra Leone had been called “the white man’s grave” for some time due to malaria and other illnesses, but the discovery of quinine changed all that led to Europeans going further into the interior of Africa, helped as much by dependable rapid-fire weapons and bullets instead of powder.\n\nI’ve largely lost the timeline as I didn’t keep this journal anywhere but in my head. On one of the early days, Joe took us on a tour of Freetown. Actually, I remember that it was on Sunday because the marketplaces were mostly closed. Joe shared with us some of the history of specific locations, showed us key monuments, and walked us through various parts of the city. We ended up at a location where an array of murals had been painted celebrating heroes of Sierra Leone’s past, an effort he spearheaded. The park that housed these murals was also the site of a wedding party. They were taking photos when we arrived and expressed some alarm at our presence. Joe said that there was sometimes an assumption that white people would only be taking photos to laugh at them. We worked our way around the murals, scrupulously avoiding the wedding party. This location was near a tree at the center of Freetown known as the Cotton Tree, which is seen as the historic symbol of the city. A huge amount of bats were flying and around the tree, a real cool spectacle.\n\nFor New Year’s Eve, the Sierra Leonean teachers suggested we attend the Tangains festival to be held at the football stadium. It kind of sounded like a nightmare to me: I haven’t been out on New Year’s Eve in probably fifteen years. I don’t like crowds, and I don’t like loud music (unless it’s music I like a lot). But how many times am I going to be in Sierra Leone? On New Year’s Eve? It took us quite awhile to find parking, but we eventually did and began to walk around the perimeter of the stadium where booth after booth of merchandise, bars, and eateries were set up. Various vendors had music blasting from their establishments, sometimes right on top of each other. So, so loud. It was almost as if they were trying to drive people away. We walked around and around a number of times trying to find the right place to eat (I guess? I was just following the crowd). Somewhere on a side street we found a restaurant selling grilled fish, and holy cow, it was amazing. The fish was HUGE and delicious. The music was still loud (and periodically a recorded voice would advise us that “the house is warm”), but the food more than made up for it. I also ordered a cider and altogether the food cost a whopping $6.75. For the next hour or two we just kept drifting around looking for souvenirs. The Sierra Leoneans helped the Americans negotiate down to more reasonable prices (though everything was super inexpensive when you converted to American dollars).\n\nOn the day that we were supposed to do a scavenger hunt of sorts in small mixed groups of American and Sierra Leonean teachers, my stomach decided it wasn’t going more than 20 feet from a bathroom. Several Americans in the group had had the same experience earlier in the trip, so I was not overly alarmed. I was on both anti-typhus and anti-malaria meds, so it was mostly a measure of riding the storm out. My peers provided me with Pepto Bismol and Imodium, and after about 24 hours I started feeling better. But I missed a wonderful opportunity to explore Freetown. Some of the groups visited local schools and got tours of the facilities, others spent time in the markets, buying souvenirs for home. I’d have to wait until nearly the last minute to get the balance of my gifts. I also missed a morning of lecture, but as it was on a subject that was of little use to me as a teacher, that was not of great concern. That’s not to say I wasn’t interested in the subject matter, it just wasn’t anything I needed to hear.\n\nI was well enough to take in the last day of lecture focusing on the so-called “civil war” and its aftermath. I gathered pretty quickly that the conflict between the Revolutionary United Front and the rest of Sierra Leone was more of a reign of terror designed to create such instability to turn Sierra Leone into a failed state. I knew about some of the atrocities from reading Ishmael Beah’s book A Long Way Gone and doing work with Amnesty International on conflict diamonds, but in context, and among people who lived through it, the subject matter was no longer a distant set of atrocities, but events that directly affected these people’s lives. That members of the government and military also resorted to their own atrocities and corruption in the wake of this terror is not completely surprising, but nonetheless makes the picture a bit more cloudy, where the clear “good guys” don’t necessarily exist outside the innocents who are being victimized in the worst way. The widespread use of rape, amputation, torture, and murder between 1991 and 2002 is hard to fathom, but it happened — and the notion that a country could rebuild in a generation is even more difficult to imagine.\n\nDespite the obstacles and the daunting nature of this reconstruction, that is just what seems to be happening. I was struck very early on by the relentingly positive nature of virtually every Sierra Leonean that I met. The pride in their country and its resilience impressed me to no end. Filled with determination to move past their troubled history, I still didn’t quite grasp how deeply this ran until the last leg of our journey, to the city of Kabala and town of Yagala in the northeast of the country. But first, we had an excursion to a chimpanzee sanctuary in Freetown. The sanctuary was located atop a mountain that was accessible via a narrow, overgrown, winding road. At times I could see the wheels of the bus mere inches away from the edge of a huge ravine. The final trek was up a hill that was only accessible via a 4×4 vehicle, so we walked up. The tour itself was cool, if not a little underwhelming as for the most part we couldn’t get too close to the chimps, and basically just saw them eating or doing a little gymnastics. Nonetheless, the work of folks at the sanctuary was very interesting to hear about. Unfortunately, some people eat chimpanzee meat, and that was the focus of quite a bit of the signage around the facility. They even had to deal with poachers periodically trying to get into the facility. One fun thing was seeing a plaque recognizing the donation of a Mr. John Lydon.\n\nBecause I’m the consummate father who thinks he knows how to maximize packing space, I appointed myself in charge of loading up the bus. And although I was skeptical of our ability to make it happen, somehow we got all the luggage into the bus and one car. I was surrounded by the bags at the back of the bus and occasionally worried that something stacked high above me would fly off and knock someone out, there were no such incidents despite some rather bumpy roads. Along the way we stopped a couple of times, giving me the chance to mention that men in Sierra Leone basically urinate whenever, wherever they need to. There’s a small amount of effort made to be out of sight, but we’re talking about handful of steps from the road. I felt bad for the women on the bus who couldn’t just go to the bathroom whenever they needed to. On one stop we all visited the bathroom of a small restaurant where we had to employee the use of bucket water before the next person used the toilet. At least there they got to go in privacy.\n\nWe arrived in Kabala after a long day’s drive and met with the Limba paramount chief and a bunch of the Limba elders. Tom knew that the tradition was to present the chief with a kola nut pod. The tradition was explained to us, and after we all took a bite of the bitter kola nut, the paramount chief joked that we were all married. We then loaded back up into the vehicles to drive to Yagala. The road we turned onto was a dusty, dirt road. From the back of the bus all I could see was a giant dust cloud for miles until we finally arrived at the village where it seemed we were expected. The entire village had turned out for us, smiling and waving with a level of enthusiasm I’ve never seen before. Many of the women were wearing colorful, matching dresses of a few different designs. We drove slowly through the village and everywhere we looked the people lined the road waving enthusiastically, beaming from ear to ear. Many of them followed the bus to its final stop near a covered outdoor seating area. Before we were beckoned to sit at the front of the seating area (essentially on stage), the people danced to the drums that were being played, beckoning some of us to join them. I just watched, but appreciated the joy they had when some of our group participated.\n\nWhen we were all seated, one of the elders talked a little bit about why we were there and invited Tom to speak. He said a few eloquent words off the cuff before they said prayers. First they said a Muslim prayer in Arabic before saying an Our Father. I was amazed to see that the vast majority of people who said the Muslim prayer also said the Christian prayer. I had been told that there were no tensions between the ¾ of the Muslim population and the ¼ Christian population of this country, but seeing it in action was something else. At this point we were invited to go on a hike, or “climb the mountain” as they said. Although it was hot in Yagala, it wasn’t nearly as humid as it had been in Freetown. I was a little annoyed that we hadn’t been told about the order of events and was not dressed as I’d like to have been for a hike, but it was hard to harbor any resentments in the midst of this welcoming bunch.\n\nI walked with one of the elders at the front of the procession which seemed to be about 90 percent of the village. Along the way I got a look at the modest housing they had, saw a handful of wells they had for water, and noted the complete absence of electricity and generators. Some people with young children stayed behind, but there were dozens upon dozens of children as young as five years old walking with us. In fact, the children were particularly keen to grab our hands and walk with us. For most of the walk I had both of my hands being held. The one boy who was with me most of the time introduced himself as Ali. I would guess he was around 8 or 9 years old. Batches of kids would run past us on the hike, all the while smiling and laughing. The older kids and adults would thank us for joining them. We were asked how we liked the trail. At one point Leslie, one of the teachers on the trip asked how much further it would be. I heard someone say something that vaguely sounded like “two miles,” so I laughingly repeated it. I looked down at Ali and he said, “Yes, two miles.”\n\nThe trail was a great hiking trail, with a fairly steady uphill trajectory. At times big steps were needed to climb from rock to rock. Gradually it got steeper, and towards the end became extremely steep to where it genuinely felt like we were climbing a mountain. And again, many of us were not really dressed for it. Some of the teenagers and young adults who were ahead of us came back to help us up the steeper inclines, or to stand behind us to make sure we were okay. It would have been one thing if this were the attitude of 5% of the Yagala folks, but it really was ALL of them. The last bit of the climb was a bit scary and exhausting, but also exhilarating. Atop the mountain, we stood on solid rock, with spectacular views. At this point I was utterly filthy from the dust and sweat, but the celebratory atmosphere of the young and old and all those in between who had made the trek was infectious. I looked in shock at the big supply of drinks and food people had someone managed to bring up the mountain, and bought a disgustingly sweet energy drink as I had run through all of my water.\n\nThen we were asked to do a bit more of a hike because they wanted us to see their ancestral homes. We trekked a bit more, with a few climbs up and down along the way. There were ruins in a number of places, which at first meant little to me. I mean, okay, cool, your ancestors lived here. And then I found out why they lived there. When poachers had come to gather up people to sell into slavery, the Limba climbed this mountain to a largely inaccessible location. Here they could see the enemy coming, if they even bothered to struggle up the climb. We asked one of the adults how often they made this climb and his vague answer was “On any blessed day.” To think that our visit made it a blessed day in their minds was pretty humbling.\n\nTom and I decided we’d had enough atop the mountain (while many folks stayed up their and had picnics). As we were descending from the mountain — and yikes that one particularly steep section was utterly terrifying on the way down — we saw some of the latecomers on their way up. Once again they repeatedly thanked us for coming and for making the climb. At one point, a couple of men recognized Tom and told him that one of the women had taken ill. As we had four women in the group and two of them had passed us on the way (headed up), we knew it was one of two people. One of the women was black and the other white. Tom asked, “Was she… white?” They paused, seemed puzzled, and said “Yes.” When we got down to the bottom we discovered it was actually the other woman. Tom explained to me that some of the Africans he’s encountered see Americans as white, regardless of their skin tone.\n\nAfter checking in with our ill compatriot at the infirmary, I returned back to the village in preparation for dinner, a good half mile walk. In both directions little kids kept coming up to me to hold my hand. When they couldn’t get my hand, some of them held the hand of the kid holding my hand. At one point I had a chain of about six or seven kids. I got back to the bus finally. Covered in dust and sweat, I fished out some wet wipes from my back and cleaned off as best I could. I had thankfully packed clothes for the next day in my backpack as my suitcase was literally at the bottom of the entire pile. I changed on the bus and emerged holding my filthy t-shirt. I had noticed a lot of the folks in Yagala wearing American clothing (one person had a North Carolina field hockey t-shirt on), and I thought, “I wonder if Ali would want this shirt that’s 800 sizes too big for him.” I didn’t know if I’d see him again, but just then he showed up, smiling. I offered him the shirt and he took it, acting as if I had given him an Xbox… and electricity.\n\nWe then had our dinner, which was chicken, rice, mac and cheese, and quinoa. I asked for a plate without the chicken and got extra of the other three items. The mac and cheese had a really weird texture which sort of grossed me out, but at the same time it was also really tasty. The rice and quinoa were super flavorful and delicious. After all that exercise, the meal was really wonderful. At one point during the meal a few evidently very angry, very loud men burst into the room yelling about something. Things got really tense as they were shoved out of the building by our hosts. It wasn’t entirely clear what was going on, but the indication seemed to be they were not part of the village, but had made the journey from Kabala and were either really hungry or resented our presence. Or both.\n\nNonetheless, nothing was going to change the amazing vibe we had all gotten from being in the presence of the folks in Yagala. The thought popped into my head: these people have nothing, and yet they have everything. Although I had had my share of annoyances and frustrations on the trip (I wouldn’t be me if I didn’t), all of those minor grievances had dissipated. And I’ll admit to having a significant degree of shame about any number of first-world privilege issues that have caused me stress. I’m not naive enough to think that I won’t slip back into that mode from time to time now that I’m back in New Jersey, but I will always be able to recall this feeling of appreciating the indomitable spirit of the people I encountered.\n\nI could detail the last night and some of the issues we had getting our rooms, but I don’t want to say anything to detract from that finish. The glow of our afternoon in Yagala still hasn’t faded. I don’t know if there will be any way to help those folks, but I left determined to do something for the people of Sierra Leone. Emmanuel told me about the problems he has in his classroom, how basically he has to spend all of his time giving students notes because he is unable to provide them with copies. Instead of doing student-centered activities where his students get to dig into the material and enjoy a back-and-forth, he just has to burrow in and dictate the notes. I got him to calculate how much it would cost to make all of his students copies, and it was around $500. I told him that that was the first order of business when I got home. And that there was a very good chance we would be able to do more. [Update: it ended up being close to $700, but the money has already been raised and wired via Moneygram!] The alumni concert I’d hoped to do would now become a charity event for Emmanuel’s school in Bo [now called Boro4Bo]. Although a relatively small undertaking, I expect it to have a significant impact on the lives of his students who have a major exam to take in March. Hopefully when they are done with that, we can get back to the original plan of having our students collaborate. I hope that their optimism and spirit will be something my students will find infectious.\n\nADDENDUM\n\nFundraising – Emmanuel dutifully took the money that was donated and provided hundreds of students with copies of the book. The concert was a big success. Of course it was done for a great cause, but the evening was also a magical reunion of students from the entirety of my 26-year career. The highlight for me was our finale of The Band’s “The Weight” featuring so many of my favorite musicians and singers. Money raised from the concert was donated to pay the costs of after-school tutoring in all of the subjects being tested — compensating the teachers for staying hours after the end of a full work day and providing meals for the students. According to Emmanuel, they did phenomenally well on their tests, and he credited a lot of that success to these efforts.\n\nCollaboration – Emmanuel sent me a recording of a lecture he’d prepared on the Transatlantic Slave Trade and the Mende Mission. I wasn’t sure my students would be all that keen on merely listening to a lecture, so I added images to accompany his narration as well as subtitles as the vast majority of my students are not accustomed to hearing a Sierra Leone accent. I turned the whole project into a video and posted it to YouTube for other teachers to use.\n\nThe Return Visit – On June 14, most of the teachers we had worked with in Sierra Leone were able to visit the United States. As the program was based out of Yale University, they spent most of their time in New Haven. I was unable to join the group for the first few days, but my school administration valued this experience enough to let me out of my final exams for the following week. I met the group in New York City on June 16, and together we visited the Abyssinian Baptist Church and the African Burial Ground — as well as New York City pizza and some classic tourist locales. We went back to New Haven for a series of informative lectures (from Keisha Blain, our primary professor, as well as Jeffrey Ogburn and David Blight) and an amazing trip on a replica of the Amistad. We also visited with Exploring Social Justice, a group of incredible and incredibly motivated high schools students from in and around New Haven. Teachers James Clifford and Al Meadows work with these students from diverse backgrounds to foster understanding and implement concrete ideas to make the world a better place. Inspiring program, that if I had a clone, I would try to emulate.\n\nOn that Friday we headed to Washington DC to visit the stunning African American History Museum. I had to leave a day early because of some other commitments, but it was great to spend time with my Sierra Leonean peers and let them see some of the United States. I hope our paths will cross in person again, but in the meantime we are keeping in touch using What’sApp and Facebook.\n\nGwen Prowse grew up in Hillsborough and graduated Hillsborough High School in 2007. She took my AP U.S. Government and Politics course in her senior year. Gwen was always outwardly one of the most positive students I’ve encountered in my career. She was part of a strong class of students, but would regularly distinguish herself, never more than in a debate we had in class on affirmative action (see below). That moment is probably the favorite of my entire career, and nothing in my career has made me prouder than the path she has taken.\n\nTell me about your experience as a high school student.\n\nFrom the outside, I had an incredible high school experience. I was very involved. I was the president of my class sophomore through senior years. I played field hockey and lacrosse. I had a lot of friends from many different social groups, and remain close with many to this day. I was even the prom queen. Admittedly, however, high school was a tough time for me. I put a lot of pressure on myself, never slept enough, and was always so worried about being liked.\n\nMy home life wasn’t always easy. When I was in fourth grade, my father died suddenly of a heroin overdose.\n\nWhat did your father do for a living?\n\nHe worked for AT&T. He was an incredibly charismatic, sharp guy. And a great father. He was a creative (he was my mom’s guitar teacher) and I unfortunately think that suburban life just never really squared well with his sense of self. Anyway, he was sober for about 15 years but relapsed after a rough year or two—his father died and he was diagnosed with Hepatitis C. He overdosed when my brother and I were home alone with him and survived. I think the moment caused him such an incredible level of shame that he could hardly move forward. He died of an overdose about two weeks later. I miss him to this day.\n\nThat must have been incredibly difficult to go through. What did your mother do?\n\nMy mom never went to college so employment options were limited for her. She was laid off two or three times while I was a teen because her employer didn’t want to pay for health insurance for two kids. She’s a hero who did her best to hide these struggles from her kids, but at times, they were palpable.\n\nI found a lot of intellectual and emotional solace in my English and social studies classes, and from the teachers who instructed them. When I read Catcher in the Rye in Mr. Puma’s class, I felt like I understood grief better. When I read Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman in Mr. Layton’s class, I felt like I understood my father better—how deeply he struggled to comport with the myth of an American dream. Mr. Layton was an important source of strength for me my sophomore year. I remember one day (or maybe a series of consecutive days?) I had come into his class after I’d obviously been crying—my mom had just been laid off again and it just opened my emotional floodgates—and when Mr. Layton realized his jokes wouldn’t snap me out of my sadness, he returned the next day with a handwritten card wishing me strength. I don’t think I’ve ever told him what that gesture meant to me (I should!).\n\nSocial studies did something else for me. It helped me think about change over time, it gave me perspective beyond my small sphere, and it was a venue for me to think critically. My social studies teachers were often evangelists for these orientations. They inspired me. And frankly, through the content and skills we engaged, they helped to heal me. I always innately felt that in order to understand myself, I needed to understand other people, places and things. Despite how much I fit in, I often felt alienated from the suburbs of Hillsborough; cul de sacs and McMansions never felt like ‘real life’ to me. We never had enough money to travel, so my coursework was a crucial substitute.\n\nHas your perspective changed as you’ve gotten more worldly experience and gotten some distance?\n\nI wish that my high school expected more of its students, including me. As much as I loved my humanities classes (with a few exceptions), I always felt terrible in my science and math classes. For example, I felt like I never had a teacher who cared how much I was struggling, and in turn, how much I was growing to resent math and internalize a belief that I wasn’t “a math person.” In reality, I had no one to help me with it at home and had no one to teach me to practice. I had no one to inspire me to to think about math or science as an opportunity to do many of the things that I was already doing in humanities classes: think critically, logically, and even creatively. As a social science researcher, I frequently use statistics and computational software. It has taken me years to unlearn the false belief that “I’m not a math person.” Now that I work with and am friends with many colleagues who were raised in different countries, I realize that there are other pedagogies that work to prevent young people from internalizing false beliefs.\n\nWhat did you not like about social studies classes?\n\nFor a while I worried that I was never “good enough” at social studies because I assumed it was all about internalizing rote facts—dates, names, etc. Memory has never been my strong suit. I’ve always thought more in terms of themes and processes. I was fortunate that most of my social studies teachers prioritized discussion, simulation, and DBQs rather than just writing on the board. Dr. Garber, Mr. Gelpke, and Mr. Fenster, all opted for these strategies and I loved their classes. I particularly came to life in your AP Gov class. It was where I was able to practice so many intellectual and civic skills. Whether debating, simulating different institutions, participating in community service, or volunteering for a campaign, these opportunities provided lessons that carried into my whole life, my very being.\n\nWhat do you recall of the affirmative action debate in your senior year in AP Gov?\n\nI’m excited to hear what you recall! But if I remember correctly, I was possibly the only student in the whole class who began the debate in support of the policy. The argument felt so clear to me: when your identity group experienced generations of discrimination from education, employment, and access to capital, there should undoubtedly be a mechanism for members of your group to gain comparable traction in those areas. At the time, I was heartbroken that so many of my peers, including many of my friends, couldn’t see that. It was when I began to understand how deeply racism runs and how dangerously its disguised through the rhetoric of “fairness.” I became determined to expose these forms of structural racism and dismantle it.\n\nIt was just you against a bunch of white and Asian students who were convinced that black students were going to take “their” spot at the college of their choice. Typically in that situation I’d help balance the scales by weighing in on the pro side, but you were so articulate and impassioned that it was unnecessary. I just watched. And marveled. And then recruited you to join Debate.\n\nWhat did you major in at Rutgers?\n\nI majored in urban planning and public policy, with minors in political science and history.\n\nHow did your focus and career goals evolve as an undergraduate?\n\nI think I knew for a long time *who* I wanted to be, specifically, that I would devote my life to actualizing racial and economic justice in the United States. But finding the right route to do so was a bit less clear. Like I said, my mom never went to college so I never really knew what a career actually was. For a while I thought I wanted to go to law school. Then I thought I wanted to be an urban planner to help design more just and equal communities. I also did a lot of work as a grassroots community organizer, which made me want to address spatial inequality as a political problem. My political science professor and mentor to this day, Lisa Miller, helped me to do that while I was in college. From here, I decided I wanted to work in public policy or pursue my PhD in political science (which I eventually went off to do!).\n\nHow did working with the Institute for Domestic and International Affairs play a role in your life’s trajectory?\n\nSupporting high school Model UN and Model Congress conferences with the Institute of Domestic and International Affairs helped me become a leader, an educator, and a global citizen. In what other venue do you get to become better a leading your peers, teaching high school students key debate and policy skills, and learn a ton about urgent issues facing the nation and global community?\n\nBeing in IDIA also allowed me to make my first trip outside of North America to the Republic of the Gambia, where we teamed up with Gambians our own age to facilitate civics classes to middle school and high school students. This trip was transformative. It taught me how much I have to learn from other countries and cultures. It made me more excited to travel.\n\nOn a cheekier note, it also made me realize how cool it is to be a “nerd”. I was so insecure as a high school student that it took until my senior year to attend a Model Congress conference. I hadn’t even considered it until you encouraged me to join.\n\nI now proudly serve on the board of IDIA. Oh, and I also met my now husband in IDIA!\n\nDid you have to do a thesis or rough equivalent? If so, what was it on?\n\nI did. My thesis was on the racial politics of housing policy in the US. I actually found the abstract!\n\nAt the tail end of the Southern civil rights movement, the racial and economic disparities brought on by exclusionary zoning practices sparked the attention of activists, lawyers and legislatures. By the 1970s, however, lawyers and activists realized that the national venue was less responsive to race-based civil rights and therefore retreated to their states and local communities in an attempt to achieve place-based justice through the state constitution and lawmaking bodies. This paper examines this phenomenon by considering New Jersey’s history of affordable housing equity in New Jersey, focusing on Black New Jerseyans in particular. The New Jersey Supreme Court case, Southern Burlington County N.A.A.C.P. v. Township of Mount Laurel (1975) and the corresponding creation of the Council on Affordable Housing (COAH) provides a framework for my analysis. Drawing on legal documents, newspaper articles, demographic data, and public law scholarship, I begin with a critique of the role and relationship of courts, legislatures, and private interests in both driving and diminishing racial and economic diversity across the state’s communities. I conclude by offering a set of recommendations, including more racially conscious policy and new relationships between municipalities and legislatures, which may serve to reconcile the dissonance between the intended and actual outcomes of the Mount Laurel decisions.\n\nI do still try to keep tabs on the Mount Laurel case and generally remain involved in housing issues. I serve on the board of an affordable housing nonprofit in New Haven, Connecticut and did a research paper on the rise and decline of New Haven’s affordable housing cooperatives in the second half of the 20th century.\n\nBut as far as Mount Laurel goes, it does seem like builders are trying to take advantage of the fact that Governor Murphy is more friendly to the policy. I just read the other day that Royce Brook Golf Club sold off some of its property to developers who hope to build affordable housing. I can only imagine the uproar that will ensue.\n\nNIMBYism is a serious problem and one I do believe we need to be better at combating in suburbs and in cities, especially as rental housing becomes more and more unaffordable for low and middle income families. It is refreshing to see that the topic of affordable housing has become a national issue. And it is helpful that researchers like Doug Massey at Princeton have been able to show empirical evidence that the Mount Laurel policy works for low-income families at no cost to the municipalities that develop affordable housing.\n\nWhy did you choose to do Teach For America?\n\nIf I’m being honest, I really wanted to do Teach For America so I could move to the Mississippi Delta. Of course, I was passionate about education and working with young people, but I first and foremost wanted to move to the Delta and I knew TFA sent teachers there. I became interested in the Delta when studying cities, particularly while studying the Great Migration of 6 million African Americans from the rural South to mostly Northern and Western cities. I wanted to know what was left behind and I wanted to learn from the place, its people, and its history.\n\nI was ultimately placed in a town in Southeastern Arkansas. I taught high school civics and economics.\n\nWhat was your experience like?\n\nHard! Teaching is hard! Especially when you didn’t go through multiple years of training like many teachers do (and do for very good reasons). I wasn’t prepared to be the teacher my students deserved. They were ninth graders getting used to a high school setting and I was their teacher getting used to a school setting. It was my first real job AND my first time living out of the state of New Jersey. But I loved my students and I worked so hard to let them know it. And I was fortunate to have had outstanding social studies teachers as a pedagogical template.\n\nI was a much better teacher my second year. I’d venture to say I was even good. I raised my expectations for my students and for myself, and I saw results. In addition to learning a ton about teaching, I also learned so much about my context. E.g. what it feels like to live in a rural area (the closest Starbucks was an hour away), the important role religion and specifically Christianity plays in public life in this region, and importantly, how people from this part of the US view where I am from as well as what they believe we believe about them (convoluted sentence — hope you follow!). I still keep in touch with many of my students. I try to go back and visit every other year.\n\nDid you think much about the role of race in being a white person teaching in a more racially mixed school than the one you grew up in?\n\nI taught in a school that was about 60% white and 40% black. In my town in Southeastern Arkansas, nearly all of the teachers were white and the majority of the students in the honors classes were white. The racial divisions of the school were palpable. I thought a lot about race, and tried to teach a lot about race. And I didn’t always get it right. The challenge was scaffolding the issues in ways that students would understand, could constructively contribute, and understand the historic throughlines to today. It was about making it a safe place to discuss and ask questions. I also worked particularly hard to affirm the students who were Black in my class, as well as white students who were from particularly impoverished backgrounds. I worked to develop relationships with their parents. Perhaps this was my lived form of affirmative action: I wanted to make sure that Black and/or low-income students, who seemed to receive less support and mentorship within the school, felt brilliant and unstoppable. The class of students I taught in my second year actually went on to have the most Black students graduate with honors in the school’s history. I take no credit for that, but it was such a tremendous milestone for the community and I felt so proud to have known and worked with each one of them.\n\nAlso, I read Beverly Tatum’s Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? when I was in college, then read it again when I was in TFA. I found this book to be foundational for my understanding of the role that race plays in the socialization of young people, black, white, and brown.\n\nHow do you feel about the criticism levied at TFA that they are being used to undermine unions?\n\nI’m very concerned about the labor implications of TFA. I do think the organization’s work has undermined unions and eroded a lot of what unions have fought for over generations—specifically sane work hours. I snicker inside every time I see charter schools begin to unionize since in many ways charters are the birth-children of TFA. I also think the act of accepting donations from corporate foundations whose businesses undermine workers of all professions through low wages and union-busting—even when we ALL KNOW that higher parent incomes produce better educational outcomes for young people—is an unsettling element of hypocrisy I’m proud that so many alumni are changing their tune on this issue by beginning to come out to support unions or at least to critique practice within charter schools.\n\nWhy did you decide to leave teaching?\n\nThere are so many reasons I tell myself. One is that I get so emotionally invested in people that I lose myself in the work. Another is that when I decided to leave Arkansas to return to the East Coast, I couldn’t really find any teaching work (I actually ended up working for Teach For America in Delaware for a few years). Maybe it was a bit of internalized deprecation toward the teaching profession—that I should do “more.” But I really don’t think so. The most accurate, albeit incomplete, answer is that I just had too many questions about the system that my students were living in and I was hell bent on answering them. My mentor Lisa Miller told me in undergrad that I should only go back to pursue my PhD if I had more questions than answers. I had sooo many questions.\n\nWhat are you studying at Yale?\n\nI’m getting my PhD in political science and African American studies. I mostly study two things. First, I examine the ways in which interactions with the government shape one’s perception of citizenship. Second, I am interested in the political battles between cities and their states and the racialized history (and consequences) of these conflicts.\n\nSimilar question about race that I asked about teaching: how do you navigate working in a field that some black and other antiracist activists might suggest be reserved for people of color?\n\nI think if we are really going to show up for racial justice, we need to decide how we will live anti-racist lives and have anti-racist careers. And most importantly, we need to be open to feedback. I think part of anti-racism is acquiring knowledge . But sometimes knowing is performing the work and not doing the work. I’m very aware of that. There are some questions I always try to ask myself in my field, and also in my day to day life to navigate the important question you’ve asked:\n\nWhat is my stake in this work? Is it prestige or recognition or is my involvement in this work going to liberate me from the gravitational pull of white supremacy—and in turn support the liberation of oppressed people? If it is the former, I have no place doing the work. Academia is incredibly competitive, so I regularly check in with myself on this question.\n\nIs this my story to tell? It is not uncommon for white scholars to get famous off of a study or a concept that has already been identified by a person of color years (if not generations) before. A contemporary example is Alice Goffman’s On the Run. One of the most common critiques from Black and Latinx scholars is that this was not her story to tell—she should not have been the one to immerse herself with young Black men in Philadelphia and tell their story. Further, because of my whiteness (and female-bodiedness, etc.), I sometimes have access to people and places that members of more marginalized groups don’t. How can I use that bodily privilege to tell important stories about power?\n\nAm I actively anti-racist in my engagement with my institution and my colleagues or do I fall silent when there’s controversy? Like I said earlier, knowing facts and history and theory does not mean you’re doing the work. When there is racial discord on campus or in our department, I always try to be the buffer between the institution and my more marginalized friends and colleagues. I’ll start the petition so they don’t have to, initiate the meetings with faculty, and push my white colleagues to show up differently. I attend protests and get involved in my community as best I can. People of color from marginalized minority groups do so much emotional and time-intensive labor; I try to alleviate the burden where I can.\n\nWhat are your plans after you graduate?\n\nAhh I don’t know! Hoping to pursue a tenure-track position at a university, but the academic job market is rough! I also kind of have this mentality that I just want to be a good person doing something meaningful somewhere. Ambition and planning have always been a little non-linear for me. Besides, this country is also in a dire state. I want to be prepared to serve where I’m needed, even if it seems to deviate from my apparent trajectory."
