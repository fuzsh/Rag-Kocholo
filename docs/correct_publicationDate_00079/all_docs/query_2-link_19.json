        "text": "artist bio:\n\nI’m an American singer, songwriter, producer, dancer and entertainer. I was born in New Orleans, LA and raised in Madisonville, a small town north of New Orleans. There I was heavily influenced by the jazz/R&B culture. My parents were both jazz musicians who introduced me to music at an early age.\n\nAs a teenager, I developed my natural ability to sing and dance by singing in church, break dancing on the streets, and by listening to famous singers like Michael Jackson, Lionel Richie, and Christopher Cross. Soon after graduating from high school, my drive pushed me to make a spontaneous decision to relocate to the big city of Los Angeles in pursuit of a career in the entertainment industry.\n\nAfter landing in Los Angeles on one way ticket, a suitcase and a dream, the next few years were all about surviving. Driving around in an auctioned mail truck was just one of many adventuress moments in my life. That truck got me to point A, B, and sometimes C!\n\nI later booked a tour in Germany choreographing for a German artist named Blumchen. While on tour, I accidentally broke my leg. Though to most it may have seemed like it was a huge hiccup, I saw it as a sign to start focusing on my singing career. Upon returning to America, there was a buzz within the music industry, leading me to be sought after by various A & R Executives and super star legends such as, Babyface and Michael Jackson. After personally meeting up with both Babyface and Michael, I later signed a record deal with La Face Records and recorded a solo album, which was never released. The following year, I stepped away from La Face and began devoting my career to producing music, writing songs for TV and Film and traveling around the globe with my band performing live for some of world’s largest corporations such as, Google, IBM, Walt Disney, Bank of America, and McDonalds to name a few.\n\nThough I love songwriting and producing music, I must say that my first love is performing on stage in front of a live audience. I have a huge sweet tooth for making people smile and laugh! I’ve been told it’s what I do best. As a gifted performer, with years of experience on stage, I feel that I have an extraordinary ability to give crowds what they want, when they want it. Whether it’s a public concert, a large corporate event or a private soiree, I always try and keep the audience captivated, on their feet and begging for more. In one word: Irresistible!"
