A majority of all voters would welcome Government Ownership of Railroads and other public utilities. The recent great victory in Chicago for Municipal Ownership demonstrates this fact. What Chicago has done locally can be accomplished in the nationâand WILL be done as soon as the people overcome\n\nPolitical Inertia\n\nWith many the voting habit becomes fixed after one or two elections. The ordinary man keeps on âvoting âer straightâ long after he has discovered that his partyâs actions are out of joint with his own views. Party âregularityâ commands the average manâs support long after he KNOWS his party is headed wrong. Some really great men, even, have placed party âregularityâ before principle.\n\nA Great Light\n\non the correct principle of organization is to be found in that admirable work by George Gordon Hastings,\n\nThe First American King\n\nA dashing romance, in which a scientist and a detective of today wake up seventy-five years later to find His Majesty, Imperial and Royal, William I, Emperor of the United States and King of the Empire State of New York, ruling the land, with the real power in the hands of half a dozen huge trusts. Automobiles have been replaced by phaÃ«rmobiles; air-ships sail above the surface of the earth; there has been a successful war against Russia; a social revolution is brewing. The book is both an enthralling romance and a serious sociological study, which scourges unmercifully the society and politics of the present time, many of whose brightest stars reappear in the future under thinly disguised names. There are wit and humor and sarcasm galoreâa stirring tale of adventure and a charming love story.\n\nHon. Thomas E. Watson says:\n\nâI read âThe First American King,â and found it one of the most interesting books I ever opened. Mr. Hastings has not only presented a profound study of our social and economic conditions, but he has made the story one of fascination. It reminds me at times of Bellamyâs âLooking Backward,â but the story is told with so much more human interest, the situations themselves are so much more dramatic, that it impresses me very much more favorably than any book of that kind I have ever known.â\n\nInteresting as the story is as a romance and as a critical sociological study, one of its vitally important points is\n\nHow to Organize\n\nMr. Hastings says:\n\nâIt has been suggested,â continued General Mainwarren, âthat a wise course for patriotic leaders of your day would have been to have abandoned the hope of converting and securing the grown voters as a body. It would have been best for them, at a given time, to have said: âBeginning from today, we will pay no attention to any male who is more than fifteen years of age and who is now, or within the next six years will be, entitled to a vote. But we will direct all efforts to an entirely new body of suffragists.â They should then have turned their attention to the women of the land, to the mothers of future generations of voters. It has been said that âEvery woman is at heart a royalist.â It could with equal truth be said: âEvery woman is by nature a politician.â ... Look at the influence exerted politically by various women of whom history speaks.â\n\nThis Is the Key-Note of Success\n\nFor fifteen years the Peopleâs Party, in season and out of season, has preached âEqual Rights to All, Special Privileges to None.â It has persistently demanded that government shall attend to public matters, and that private business shall be conducted by individuals with the least possible interferenceâand absolutely no favoritismâby government. It has continually demanded public ownership and government operation of railroads and other public utilities. It has urged the initiative, referendum and the recall; a scientific money system; the abolition of monopoly in every form. Millions of votersâas the Chicago election clearly indicatesâare in accord with the Peopleâs Party; but heretofore the voting habit, the âvote âer straightâ political insanity, has kept them in political slavery.\n\nEducate the Boys\n\nLet us train up a new generation of votersâwithout diminishing our efforts to break up old party habitsâwho will have the courage of conviction and correct ideas regarding politics and economics. Let us interest the mothers, so we can have the boys taught to cast their first votes on the side of Justice. Habit will then keep them voting right.\n\nLet Us Begin Now\n\nMr. Hastingsâs book is a thought-provoker. It combines romance with sociology and teaches while entertaining. With âThe First American Kingâ and TOM WATSONâS MAGAZINE in another 100,000 homes, our first great step will be taken toward overcoming plutocracy. With this end in view, we have made arrangements whereby we can offer a dollar book, 350 pages, and a dollar magazine one year, 128 pages monthly, both for only $1.50.\n\nTom Watsonâs Magazine and The First American King $1.50\n\nIn order to treat all alike, the book will be sent postpaid to any present subscriber of TOM WATSONâS MAGAZINE on receipt of 60 cents.

WATSON\n\nOur Creed\n\nTHE Peopleâs Party does not attempt the impossible, or seek the unattainable.\n\nOur young men do not dream dreams; our old men do not see visions. We are wedded to practical reforms which have been tried in civilized communities, and which have vindicated themselves by results.\n\nWe do not propose to re-create society, subvert law and order, confiscate property, or substitute a new system of government for the old.\n\nWe do not want to tear down the house in order to repair it.\n\nWe do not hope to build a perfect state with imperfect human hands, but we do intend to make the government as nearly perfect as possible, to the end that it shall represent that conception of justice which deals with all men alike, and allows to every child of Adam a fair chance in the world which God created as a home for the human race.\n\nWe believe that the government should be clothed with all the attributes of sovereignty; that the government should govern, and should not delegate to private citizens or corporations any part of its sovereign power.\n\nThe creation of a national currency has always been an attribute of sovereigntyâof royalty.\n\nIn a system where the people rule the people succeed to the power of the king; and that attribute of sovereignty which the king exercised and did not delegate should be exercised by the people and should not be delegated.\n\nTherefore, the Populists, successors to the old Greenbackers, have always clung to it as an article of faith that the Federal Government should exercise its constitutional right to create a currency, and should not delegate that power to national banks or to private citizens or corporations.\n\nThe government should supply the country with a sufficient amount of national money, every dollar of which should be equal to any other; every dollar of which should be a full legal tender for all claims, public and private, and no dollar of which should be made redeemable in any other dollar.\n\nWe believe that those things which are essentially public in their nature and their use should belong to the public, and should be equally enjoyed by all.\n\nJust as the navigable rivers are public to the beggar and the millionaire alike, just as the Bay and the Gulf and the Harbor and the navigable Lakes are the common property of the rich and the poor, the high and low, the black and white, so we believe that the roads should be common ground upon which every citizen should be free to pass upon terms of equality, and that the iron highways of today, which were taken from the people by the exercise of the right of Eminent Domain, should be restored to the public by the same law of Eminent Domain, a fair compensation having been paid, and the property operated hereafter for the benefit of all the people.\n\n[Pg 386]\n\nSo with the Telegraph and the Telephone and Express Companies.\n\nIn every city and town we believe that the municipality, which is a part of the stateâs sovereignty, should take over to itself those public utilities which in their very nature are monopolies, and, just compensation having been paid, that these utilities should be used for the benefit of the people, to whom they belong.\n\nWe believe that the government should be supported by a system of taxation in which each citizen will pay taxes in proportion to his ability to pay.\n\nWe believe in a Tax on the Franchises enjoyed by private corporations.\n\nWe believe that the Income Tax would be the fairest of all taxes, because it would take for the support of the government, not the property of the citizen, but a portion of the income which the citizen derives from that property, or from his individual exertions, and the tax would be proportioned to the income.\n\nThat property or that salary could not be enjoyed without the protection and the advantages which flow from government, and it is eminently fair, where the government has protected me, or where it affords me such opportunities, that I can receive a large income from any source whatever, I should pay to the government, in return for its protection and its advantages, a fair share of that which I could not have made without that protection and those advantages.\n\nUnder our present system a man like John D. Rockefeller pays no more Tariff tax when he buys a hat than a doctor or lawyer or preacher pays when he buys a hat. So with the shoes, the clothes, the crockery on the table, the furniture in the house. Many a citizen whose income does not amount to ten thousand dollars per year pays fully as much Tariff tax in the purchasing of necessary articles of clothing, furniture and food as John D. Rockefeller pays, whose income is counted monthly by the millions of dollars.\n\nThe same thing is true of Carnegie, Morgan, Hill, Harriman, Gould, Cassatt, Vanderbilt. Many a farmer whose income from his farm may not do more than give his family an actual support, after the operating expenses are paid, contributes annually a greater sum in Tariff tax to the Federal Government than is paid by the fabulously wealthy beneficiaries of class legislation.\n\nIt has been said that the Peopleâs Party dodges the Tariff issue. This is not true.\n\nOne of our earliest platforms, which has been repeatedly reindorsed, declares:\n\nâWe demand the removal of the Tariff tax from the necessaries of life which the poor must have to live.â\n\nThis is precisely the principle announced by Thomas Jefferson, who declared that the taxes should be so laid that the luxuries of life would bear the burden of government, and that his ideal was a system in which the poor would be entirely relieved from the crushing weight of taxation.\n\nFurthermore, we have said that legislation should not be so framed as to build up one business at the expense of another.\n\nIf the Peopleâs Party platform were enacted into law, there could be no such thing as a Trust in the United States.\n\nIn order that the people should become the victims of such tyranny as that exercised by the Trusts two things are necessary: Foreign relief must be made impossible, and domestic relief made impracticable.\n\nThe Tariff wall keeps the foreigner from interfering; the railroads and the national banks supporting the Trusts make it impossible for domestic dissatisfaction to assert itself effectively.\n\nIf the people should put upon the free list those articles which are made the subject of the Trusts, the foreigner could at once invade the market, and destroy the monopoly upon which the Trust is based.\n\nIf the Populist principles of finance [Pg 387] and of transportation should be carried into effect, the Government abolishing national banks and private ownership of transportation lines, the rebate would be impossible, discriminations would cease, equality would prevail, and there would be no collusion between the national banks and the railroads by which Trusts are made invincible as they are now invincible.\n\nWe believe in direct Legislationâputting the power of making laws and choosing rulers back into the hands of those to whom it belongsâand the election of all officers by the people.\n\nThe people should not be made to await the pleasure of the Legislature or of Congress. They should not be kept in ignorance of what the law is until legislative acts become known through the newspapers. There should be in every case the right to initiate those laws which they want, and to veto, through the Referendum, any law which they do not like.\n\nWhen an officer whom they have elected shows by any vote or act that he is not the man they took him to be, they should not have to wait till the expiration of his term to get a better man. They should have the right to recall the officer the moment he betrays his trust.\n\nWe believe in the eight-hour day for labor in Government works, in factories, workshops and mines.\n\nWe believe in the regulation of child labor in factories, workshops and mines, to the end that children of tender age shall not be made to slave out their lives in order that corporations shall have cheap labor and large dividends.\n\nSaturn, the old fable tells us, devoured his own children: Christian civilization does the same thing.\n\nAs long as we permit children of ten and twelve years to labor from eight to fourteen hours per day in our mills and workshops modern civilization is another Saturn. We are devouring our own children.\n\nWe believe that the land, the common heritage of all the people, should not be monopolized for speculative purposes, or by alien ownership, but that legislation should be so shaped as to encourage to its full extent the right of every man born into this world to till the soil and make a living out of it.\n\nAnd one of the principal reasons why we favor a graduated income tax, which increases by geometrical progression as the income increases, is that it automatically keeps the wealth of the country in a constant sort of redistribution, and acts as a check upon that excessive accumulation which is recognized by all intelligent thinkers as one of the most serious perils and intolerable evils of our present era of class legislation.\n\nThese are the most important articles of our faith. It is for these principles that we have struggled ever since 1891âwith never a doubt that they were sound, that they would constantly gain converts, that they would ultimately win.\n\nWhen I founded the Peopleâs Party Paper in Atlanta, Ga., in 1891 (which paper lived and toiled for these principles until the fusion movement of 1896 killed it, as it killed twelve hundred other Populist papers), I announced the same purpose which I announced in the prospectus of this magazine.\n\nMy faith was as firm in 1891 as it is today, and I had as little doubt then as I have now that Populism is just as sure to triumph as the sun is to continue to warm the world.\n\nThe reforms will be effected because the country needs them. It cannot stand much more of the present system. It will not accept Socialism. Occupying the middle ground of radical, but practical reform, Populism is inevitable.\n\nNational Politics and Policies\n\nThere is a saying that the difference between a wise man and a fool is that the wise man never makes the same [Pg 388] mistake twice, while the fool continues to make it without limit.\n\nIt is of supreme importance that those who will act as political leaders during the next four years should think clearly in order that they may act wisely.\n\nWe have not, as yet, discovered any brighter lamp with which to guide our footsteps than that which Patrick Henry named the Lamp of Experience.\n\nIf I felt that our national leaders were about to repeat a disastrous mistake and adopt a policy which seems the continuance of the reign of class legislation and special privilege, I should be false to my own sense of duty if I did not at this early day point out that error and warn the Jeffersonians against it.\n\nI say Jeffersonians because, after all is said and done, there are but two great differences of political thought in the United Statesânever have been but two; never will be but two.\n\nOn the one hand are those who believe that legislation should be dictated by the interest of the few; that the powers and the benefits of good government should be monopolized by the few; that the blessings and the opportunities of life should be the heritage of the few; that wealth and privilege and national initiative should perpetually be the legacy of the few.\n\nOn the other hand is the Jeffersonian idea that the human family are all alike the children of God; that the earth and all it contains was created for the benefit of this human family, and that any system of law and government which gathers into the hands of the few an unjust proportion of the common estate, to the exclusion of the vast majority, is an infamous invasion of the natural rights of man.\n\nNow, what is it that endangers the cause of the Jeffersonians?\n\nWhat is it that seems to me to be so certain to insure the continuance of the rule of the few over the many?\n\nIt is the continued existence of the political alignment of the great mass of the people in two political parties, each of which, in its heart of hearts, is wedded to the rule of the few.\n\nNeither one of these parties wants any material change in our present system of legislation or of administration.\n\nBoth of them are absolutely dominated by the same interests.\n\nIn the ranks of each of these parties are found the powerful railroad kings, the irresistible trusts, the indispensable national banks, the vastly influential insurance companies.\n\nAs a matter of fact, nearly every board of management of every predatory corporation against which the people are rising in revolt is made up half and half of Democrats and Republicans, in order that, no matter which party wins at the polls, the corporation will have influence at court.\n\nIt is so clear to me that the only possible hope for the people is to drive these two parties together while the people unite under another standard.\n\nIn vain does Judge Parker talk about the difference between his Democracy and the Republicanism of Mr. Roosevelt. During the campaign he was unable to state any difference, and there is, in fact, no difference.\n\nBetween Belmontâs ideas of government and those of Mark Hanna there is not the slightest difference.\n\nBetween the Democratic corporation and the Republican corporation it is absurd to claim that there is any difference.\n\nBetween Democratic manufacturers and Republican manufacturers no human being of intelligence will expect any difference or find any.\n\nIn other words, the millionaire beneficiaries of class legislation control both of the old parties, and the battle which they wage year after year, decade after decade, is a mere sham battle. The strategy of the corporations consists in keeping the people divided in order that the corporations may rule.\n\nBelieving this to be true, I am painfully impressed with the fact that Mr. Bryan is making a huge mistake.\n\nThe pity of it is, he has already made that mistake twice, and is now making it for the third time.\n\n[Pg 389]\n\nWhat is the mistake?\n\nIt consists of the effort to get radical reform out of a party which has always been dominated and always will be dominated by conservatives. When the currency was contracted just after the Civil War and ruin brought upon so many thousands of people in this country, it took the joint action of both the old parties to do it.\n\nWhen the revenue taxes were taken off railroads, manufactures, insurance companies, bank checks and express companies, soon after the close of the Civil War, it took the joint action of both the old parties to do it.\n\nWhen the Income Tax was lifted from the burdened shoulders of the rich, it took the joint action of both the old parties to do it.\n\nWhen Silver was struck down and the Gold Standard forced upon us, it took the joint action of both the old parties to do it.\n\nWhen our National Bank System was enthroned, and that terribly unjust system was chartered to prey upon the people, it required the joint action of both the old parties to do it.\n\nWhen Congress, over the protest of Thaddeus Stevens and others, obeyed the command of the Rothschilds (delivered at Washington personally by August Belmont, the father of the present Boss of the Democratic Party), and declared by legislative enactment that the banks should be paid in gold while the soldier at the front should be paid in greenbacks, it required the joint action of both the old parties to do it.\n\nThere has never been a necessary act of Congressânecessary to the rule of the few, necessary to carry out the Hamiltonian idealâthat did not rest for support one foot on the Republican Party and the other on the Democratic Party.\n\nThe man who does not know this to be true is unfamiliar with official records.\n\nThe time has been when Mr. Bryan held the same opinions which I am expressing now. The time has been when he declared, in speech and writing, that there was no hope for reform in the Democratic Party.\n\nIn 1896 Mr. Bryan, in the Omaha World-Herald, editorially asked:\n\nâCan a National Convention harmonize the discordant elements of the Democratic Party? Impossible.\n\nâSuppose the advocates of bimetallism control the National Convention and nominate a Free Silver Democrat upon a free coinage platform, will Cleveland, Carlisle, Olney, Morton, et al. support the ticket? Of course not. They say that the free coinage of silver means individual dishonesty, commercial disaster and national dishonor, and if they believe what they say they ought not to support the ticket, because their duty to their country is higher than their duty to their party organization. If, on the other hand, the convention nominates a Gold Standard Democrat on a platform indorsing the gold standard, gold bonds and national bank currency, should the nominee be supported by those who believe the gold standard to be a conspiracy of the capitalistic classes against the producers of wealthâa crime against mankind? Who says they should?\n\nâIf to continue Mr. Clevelandâs financial policy is to declare war against the common people, what friend of the common people would be willing to enlist in such a warfare, even at the command of his party?\n\nâThe Democratic Party cannot serve God and Mammon; it cannot serve plutocracy and at the same time defend the rights of the masses.\n\nâIf it yields to the plutocracy it ought to lose, and it will lose, the support of the masses; if it espouses the cause of the people, it cannot expect either votes or contributions from the capitalistic classes and from the great corporations.â\n\nIn pursuance of this very correct line of reasoning, Mr. Bryan resolutely declared that if the Democratic Party adopted the gold standard, âI promise you that I will go out and serve my country and my God under some other name, even if I must go alone.â\n\n[Pg 390]\n\nAgain Mr. Bryan said, in his book called âThe First Battle,â Chapter III, page 124, âIn that speech I took the position which I have announced since on several occasions, namely, that I would not support for the Presidency an advocate of the gold standard.â\n\nAgain Mr. Bryan said: âDoes the individual member of a party at all times reserve the right to vote against the nominee of a party, and to abandon his party entirely whenever in his judgment his duty to his country requires it? He may abandon the party temporarily, as, for instance, when an unfit candidate is nominated, or the voter may abandon his party permanently, either when he himself changes his opinion upon a paramount public question or when his party changes its position.â\n\nNow let the reader compare the present attitude of Mr. Bryan with the political ethics expounded by him in his book.\n\nHe was then the idol of the radicals; he was then the Tribune of the People.\n\nHe was the strong and stalwart foe of every plutocrat, every Wall Street interest, every beneficiary of class legislation.\n\nThe people hailed him with an enthusiasm which had not been known since the days of Henry Clay. So great was their faith in him that he swept into his movement in 1896 the Free Silver organization and the great bulk of the Populist Party.\n\nWho is it that cannot see how loftily he held his flag in those days? Who is it that does not realize how sadly it droops today?\n\nFrom the noble stand of 1893 and 1896, what a falling off is there! Boldly he declared that he would never support for the Presidency an advocate of the gold standard. Yet, when Judge Parker slapped his face in public with the Gold Telegram of 1904, the dauntless Bryan turned the other cheek, like a very meek Christian indeed.\n\nHe had said that a Democrat might bolt his party temporarily upon the nomination of an unfit candidate; he had said that Judge Parker was an unfit candidate, but he did not bolt the nomination, even temporarily.\n\nHe had said that the voter might abandon his party permanently when that party changed its position upon a paramount public question; yet when the Democratic Party, with extraordinary suddenness, changed its position upon more than one paramount question in 1904, Mr. Bryan did not bolt his party permanently.\n\nHe had said that if the Democrats took up the Republican financial policy, which meant the slavery of the debtors of this country and the impoverishment of the people, he would go out and serve his country and his God under some other name, even if he had to go alone. Yet when his party did come over to the Republican financial policy, and came by telegraph at that, Mr. Bryan did not go out to serve either his country or his God under some other name.\n\nHe had said to his brother Democrats: âIf you are ready to go down on your knees and apologize for what you have saidâ (abuse of the Republicans and the gold standard), âyou will go without me.â\n\nYet when the Democratic Party, at the St. Louis Convention in 1904, went down on its knees, in effect, to apologize for the abuse which they had heaped upon the Republicans for eight years, they did not go without Mr. Bryan. The knees of Mr. Bryan hit the floor in timely cadence with the knees of all the others, and when he filed out of the convention hall the dust was there to show it just as it was there to show it on the knees of all the others.\n\nBryan himself asked the question in 1896: âCan a National Convention harmonize the discordant elements of the Democratic Party?â He answered his own question in the comprehensive word, âImpossible.â\n\nThe event of the campaign of 1896 showed that he was right, for the Cleveland-Carlisle-Belmont element knifed him.\n\nIn the campaign of 1900 they knifed [Pg 391] him again. In the campaign of 1904, when the convention nominated a gold standard Democrat on a platform indorsing the gold standard, gold bonds and the gold bank currency, the people refused to support the sell-out of the National Democratic Party to Wall Street, just as Mr. Bryan, in 1896, prophesied that they would, in spite of the fact that the prophet of 1896 had become the gold standard nomineeâs most earnest advocate in the campaign of 1904.\n\nIn other words, the people had become so inoculated with the true gospel of Bryan, the Tribune of 1893 and 1896, that they refused to follow the change of heart and the change of conduct which came over Bryan, the Parkerite of 1904.\n\nWill not Mr. Bryan reflect upon this and draw a lesson from it? He himself has declared that he is attempting the impossible in trying to harmonize the discordant elements of the Democratic Party.\n\nWhat is the real statesmanship demanded at this time?\n\nThat those who believe in Jeffersonian ideals, whether they are now in the Republican, Democratic, Populist or Socialist parties, should come together without prejudice for party names, and should unite in the common cause of driving from power the beneficiaries of class legislation, no matter whether those beneficiaries are called Democrats or Republicans.\n\nLet the Belmonts and Morgans get together in the same party so that we can fight them both at the same time.\n\nAs long as we cling to party differences and party names our efforts will come to naught, as they did in 1896, 1900 and 1904.\n\nMr. Bryan wants the reform movement to stop and wait for him, while for four years he struggles to get the better of the plutocratic element of his own party. If they were able to wrest control from him when he had so much more advantage than he has now, how can we expect him to take that control from their strong hands?\n\nBut, suppose he does succeed in defeating the Belmont-Cleveland element in the convention of 1908, does he not know that they will fulfil his prediction again and knife him as they have done twice already?\n\nOn the other hand, suppose they conquer him in 1908 as they did in 1904, will he not submit tamely to kiss the hand that smote him as he did in the last convention? Most assuredly he will.\n\nHe lost his opportunity to fly the flag of revolt when he failed to resent the Gold Telegram of 1904. That opportunity passed, never to return.\n\nAbsolutely the only hope of radical reform lies in a straight-out, aggressive and fearless fight upon both the old parties, which in turn have had control of the Government, and which have played into each otherâs hands in forging the chains of class legislation which now bind and burden the Common People.\n\nIs It Paul Jonesâs Body?\n\nHave they found the body of John Paul Jones?\n\nThe experts say that they have.\n\nTo the legal mind, the fact that experts had to be called in to pass upon the question of identity is sufficient to arouse suspicion and provoke investigation.\n\nAs stated in a former number, I was certain they would find Paul Jonesâin their mindsâfor that was what they were looking for.\n\nWhenever, for instance, the medical expert starts out to find arsenic in the human stomach, arsenic generally shows up all right enough.\n\nIn like manner French experts were called in to identify a certain corpse as that of Paul Jones, and, after the most elaborate and beautifully regular formalities, they solemnly pronounced the verdict which they knew was expected and which they were predisposed to find.\n\nâThis is Paul Jones, isnât it?â asks General Porter, most suavely, not to say persuasively.\n\n[Pg 392]\n\nHow could the politest experts of the politest people on earth say nay?\n\nThe case was pitiful.\n\nThe search for Paul Jonesâs body had reached a crisis. Only four leaden coffins had been found in the old graveyard, and one of these had to be Paul Jones, because he had been buried in such a coffin, and the other three bore name-plates which showed they could not be his.\n\nThe fourth bore no name-plate; therefore it must be Jonesâs coffin.\n\nThe necessity of the situation required it.\n\nConsequently, polite French experts measure, compare, incubate, decide and bring in the verdict desired.\n\nLooking at the matter as a lawyer, I should say that there is not sufficient legal evidence offered, as yet, to establish the identity of the dead body.\n\nThe cemetery in which Commodore Paul Jones was buried was closed by law in 1793.\n\nA canal was afterward cut through it.\n\nThe great sea-fighter was buried, as Napoleon was, in uniform.\n\nIn the Life of himââGreat Commandersâ Seriesââby Cyrus Townsend Brady, the statement is made that Paul Jones was buried in the American uniform, and that a sword and other articles were placed in the coffin.\n\nThe body which General Porter has found was not clad in uniform.\n\nThere was no sword, or other article, found in the coffin.\n\nCommodore Jones died of dropsy, which had swollen his body to such an extent that he could not button his waistcoat.\n\nYet the French experts declare that all the measurements tally exactly with those of the living Jones.\n\nShould They Do So?\n\nAwful changes take place after death, and they are greater with some than with others.\n\nShould the measurements of a corpse which had been entombed more than a hundred years correspond exactly with those of the same body when alive?\n\nMost biographers put the height of Admiral Jones at âabout five feet and eight inches.â\n\nWonât you find a greater number of menâin France especiallyâwhose height is âabout five feet eight inchesâ than youâll find at any other figure?\n\nAnd will you not find more corpses of about that length?\n\nYet in these measurements consists the whole of the testimony which has been offered to the American people to convince them that the body of Paul Jones is at last to come home.\n\nUnless the matter of the uniform and the sword be cleared up, it is impossible to accept the conclusion arrived at by the experts.\n\nThis corpse may be, as already stated, a good enough Jones for that $35,000, but it has not yet been shown to be John Paul Jones, the naval hero of our War of Independence.\n\nIs the Black Man Superior to the White?\n\nWith statistics one can prove many thingsâthe conclusion arrived at depending, in all cases, considerably upon the man behind the figures.\n\nThis time the man behind the figures is Doctor Booker Washingtonâmay his shadow never grow less!\n\nIn the course of a recent lecture, the learned Doctor laid down the proposition that the black man is superior to the white, and he proved itâproved it by statistics.\n\nHe said that there is 85 per cent. of illiteracy among the Spaniards, while there is only 54 per cent. of illiteracy among the negroes; therefore the negroes are clearly more advanced in civilization than the Spaniards.\n\nPoor old Spain!\n\nThe learned Doctor further demonstrated that there is 65 per cent. of illiteracy among the Italians; therefore the negroes are far ahead of Italy. Russian illiteracy being 70 per cent. the black man takes precedence of the land of Peter the Great, Skobelef, Gorky, Turgenef and Tolstoy. South [Pg 393] America, having an illiteracy of 80 per cent., falls far to the rear of the negroâand Castro must add this additional kick to the many he has already received from North America.\n\nProud of his statistics, Doctor Booker Washington exclaims: âThe negro race has developed more rapidly in the thirty years of its freedom than the Latin race has in one thousand years of freedom.â\n\nThatâs a bold statement, Doctor.\n\nTo say nothing of its accuracy, may it not have been an unwise thing for you to claim that the black man has risen during thirty years more rapidly in the scale of civilization than the whites have risen in a thousand?\n\nTrue, you confine yourself to the Italians, the Spaniards, the Russians and the South Americans, but when you say the darkest of all the colored races is superior to that great section of the white race named by you, does it not occur to you that you may create a feeling of resentment among all the whites?\n\nYou have thousands of true friends throughout the entire countryâwhite men who have most generously helped you in your work, helped you with money, with moral support and with a certain amount of social recognition. Your admirers refer to you as a great man. They allude to your work as a great work. The South helps you with appropriations, just as the North helps you with donations. We want to see you succeed in building up your race.\n\nBut have you a single white friend who will indorse your statement that the black race is so superior to the whites that it can do in one generation what it required the whites a thousand years to do?\n\nDo you imagine that your friends, President Roosevelt, Mr. Carnegie, Dr. Hart, Bishop Potter, and others, will like you better when they hear you putting forth a claim to race superiority? Doctor, you have overshot the mark.\n\nWhenever the North wakes up to the fact that you are teaching the blacks that they are superior to the whites, you are going to feel the east wind.\n\nWhat do you mean by racial development, Doctor?\n\nApparently your standard of measurement is illiteracy. That is to say, if a greater number of negroes than of Spaniards can read, then the negro has achieved a higher plane in civilization.\n\nIs that your idea? Does the ability to read constitute race development?\n\nAccording to that, a million negro children attend school twelve months and become âcivilizedâ because they have learned to spell âBakerâ and to read âMary had a little lamb.â\n\nDoes it not strike you, Doctor, that such a measure might be delusive?\n\nIn making up your tables of illiteracy, why didnât you include all the negroes, as you included all the Italians, all the Spaniards, all the Russians?\n\nWhy leave out your home folks in Africa, Doctor?\n\nWhy omit Santo Domingo and Haiti?\n\nIf you will number all the negroes, Doctor, your percentage of illiteracy among the blacks may run up among the nineties, and knock your calculation into a cocked hat.\n\nIn the West Indies God poured His blessings with lavish hand upon the island of Haiti. The French went there and built up a civilization. The Revolution of 1789 freed the negroes who were held in slavery by the whites, and civil war soon followed.\n\nThe blacks outnumbered the whites and the climate was their ally. Yellow fever did for them what frost did for the Russians when Napoleon struck at their liberties. They achieved freedom, and they have had it, not for thirty years, but for a hundred years.\n\nWhat have your people done with their freedom in Santo Domingo, Doctor? Back, back into barbarism, voodooism, human sacrifice, social and political anarchy they have plunged; and their history is one long blood-stained record of backsliding from the standard which the French had already established. [Pg 394] Even now your black brethren in Santo Domingo are beseeching the white man of the United States to do that which they are unable to doâadminister national affairs. In self-defense this Government may have to treat Santo Domingo as Great Britain treats Jamaica, both governments acting upon the demonstrated fact that the blacks, left to themselves, are incapable of self-government and race development.\n\nBut before entering into a comparison of racial progress, Doctor, it is in order to note the fact that you accredit the negro with only thirty years of freedom. Why, Doctor, the negro race, as a race, has enjoyed just as long a period of freedom as the Celts, the Latins, the Anglo-Saxons and the Slavs.\n\nThe black race in Africa was as free as the Indian race in North America.\n\nDuring the thousand years in which the whites were painfully creating the civilization which you now enjoy, your race, in its native home, was doing pretty much the same things which the red race was doing in North America. Your people were running about in the woods, naked, eating raw meat, eternally at warâtribe with tribeâsteeped in ignorance, vice and superstition, with an occasional lapse into human sacrifice and cannibalism.\n\nYour race, as a race, is free now in Africa, as it has been since the dawn of history:âwhere is the civilization which it worked out for itself? It does not exist; it never did exist.\n\nThe negro has been absolutely unable to develop as a race when left to himself. Nowhere, at any time, has he developed a system of agriculture, or commerce, or manufactures, made headway in mining or engineering, or conceived a system of finance. Never has he produced a system of laws, institutions of state, religious organization, or worked out a political ideal. Never has he created a literature, or developed original capacity for the fine arts. His foot has never even crossed the threshold of the world of creative painting, sculpture, music, architecture Into the realms of science, in the domain of original thought, in the higher reaches of mental power where the human mind grapples with vast problems, material and spiritual, the problems of time and eternity, the negro has never entered. No word has ever fallen from his lips that was not the echo of what some white man had already said. He has sometimes put his foot in the white manâs track, but that is the best he has ever done.\n\nCompare this imitative race with the great Latin stockâa stock from which sprang Rienzi and Garibaldi, Cavour and Napoleon, Da Vinci and Galileo, Savonarola and Leo the Tenth, Titian and Bellini, Raphael and Michelangelo.\n\nThe Latin race, whether in Spain, Italy or South America, has developed systems of agriculture, finance, commerce, manufactures, education, religion, governmentâhas created literature, laws and institutions of state, has evidenced capacity in science and art.\n\nThe negroes superior to the Latins?\n\nHeavens above!\n\nDuring the thousand years which Doctor Washington says that the Latins have done less than the negroes have done in thirty, Spain rose into world-power, dominated the European Continent, shook Englandâs throne to its base, broke the Turkish scimiter in the great sea-fight of Lepanto, evolved a splendid literature, reached the highest development in the Fine Arts, launched Columbus upon his voyage into unknown seas to test the suggestion of another LatinâToscanelliâand thus took the first daring step in that marvelous chapter of Discovery whose sober facts are grander and stranger than Romance.\n\nHas the learned Doctor ever studied the history of Mexicoâthe Latin country south of us?\n\nSince a foreign yoke was thrown off and Mexico âfound herself,â what country has made nobler progress?\n\nThe negro in Santo Domingo has had a hundred years of freedom; Mexico [Pg 395] scarce half so many; yet compare the Mexico of today with the Santo Domingo of today. Left to themselves, the Latins of Mexico have built up a magnificent civilization.\n\nLeft to themselves, the negroes of Santo Domingo have destroyed what the French had already built.\n\nIn Mexico conditions get better, year after year.\n\nIn Santo Domingo conditions grow worse, year after year.\n\nIf the learned Doctor wants to make a study in contrasts, let him first read âWhere Black Rules White,â by Hesketh Prichard, and then read âThe Awakening of a Nation,â by Charles F. Lummis, and I venture to say that some of his cocky self-complacency as to the superiority of the negroes over the whites will ooze out of him.\n\nAs to Italyâcan it be that Italy has done less in a thousand years than the negroes have done in thirty?\n\nThe greatest man that ever lived was of Italian extraction. Taine says that Napoleon was a true Italian in character and intellect. If that be true, then the two greatest men the world ever saw were Latins. Wherever the civilized man lives today his environment, his thoughts, his ideals, his achievements are more or less influenced by the life and work of CÃ¦sar and Napoleon.\n\nIf any two men may be said to have created the material modern world those two Latins did it.\n\nIf modern Europe is any one man, it is Napoleon. His laws, schoolsâsocial, political, financial, educational institutionsâhave wrung from rulers ever since the homage of imitation.\n\nIn literature how illustrious is Italy?\n\nIt was Petrarch who was âthe Columbus of a new spiritual atmosphere, the discoverer of modern culture.â\n\nIt was he who broke away from monkish medievalism, created the humanistic impulse, treated âman as a rational being apart from theological determination,â modernizing literature.\n\nThe âshort storyâ writers of fictionâEdgar Poe, Guy de Maupassant and Kiplingâhad their teacher in Boccaccio and his novella.\n\nModern history traces its methods, its spirit and its form to Villani, Guicciardini, and that wonderful type of Latin genius, Machiavelli.\n\nThe whole world goes to school to the Latins!\n\nNo painter hopes to excel Correggio, Paul Veronese, Antonio Allegro, Tintoretto, Velasquez, Murillo. No sculptor expects to eclipse Niccola Pisano, Orvieto, Orcagna or Luca della Robbia.\n\nNo worker in gold, silver and bronze believes he can surpass Ghiberti, Cellini and Donatello.\n\nArchitects the world over despair of rivaling Alberti, Bramante, Giulo Romano, Palladio.\n\nThese masters were masters to their own generation, four and five hundred years ago; they have been masters ever since; they are masters still.\n\nWherever civilization extends its frontiers these deathless Latins are in the vanâteaching what Truth and Beauty are, refining the thoughts, elevating the ideals, improving the methods, inspiring the efforts of man.\n\nThe negroes have done more than this, and in thirty years?\n\nYou had forgotten the Renaissance, hadnât you, Doctor?\n\nAsia was decaying, Africa was in its normal state of savagery, Europe lay torpid under the weight of ignorance and superstition. Where learning existed at all its spirit was dull, its form heavy, its progress fettered by ancient canons and cumbrous vestments.\n\nSuddenly the Angel of Lightâher face a radiance, her presence an inspirationâputs a silver trumpet to her lips and blows, blows, till all the world of white men hears the thrilling notes.\n\nAnd lo! there is a resurrection! What was best in the learning of the past becomes young again, and ministers to the minds of men.\n\nLiterature springs to life, throws off antiquated dress, and takes its graceful modern form. The fine arts flourish as never before; the canvas, the marble, the precious metal, feel the subtle [Pg 396] touch of the eager artist, and give birth to beauty which is immortal. The heavy prison-castle of the Frank, the Goth, the Norman, the Anglo-Saxon, retires abashed before the elegant, airy, poetic palace of the Renaissance.\n\nNor does the revival of learning limit itself to literature, architecture, painting, sculpture. It extends to law, to commerce, to agriculture, to religion, to education.\n\nWhence came the Renaissance, Doctor Washington? Whence came that mighty revival of intellectual splendor which still influences the world? From the Latin race, which you affect to despise. From these Italians whom you say are so inferior in development to the negro.\n\nItaly led the modern world in almost everything which we call civilizationâshe is today one of the worldâs most inspiring teachers, nor will her power for good be gone till the Christian religion is repudiated, the voice of music hushed, the wand of literature broken, the force of law defied, the witchery of art lost to the minds, the hearts and the souls of men.\n\nAnd yet Doctor Washington asserts, to one audience after another, that those glorious achievements of the Latins, the Italians, these imperishable and ever potent achievements of a thousand years, are exceeded by what the negroes have done in thirty years!\n\nFrom the Latin England took her religious organization, as Germany and Austria and France had done. Through the Latin the classic literature of Greece and earlier Rome came into the modern worldâan eternal debt which we owe mainly to Petrarch.\n\nThe Bourbon kings imported from Italy the architects, painters, sculptors, landscape gardeners, who laid upon uncouth feudal France the rich mantle of Italian beauty.\n\nIt was the Latin who taught modern Europe how to farm, how to irrigate, how to engrave, how to make paper from rags, how to bridge the rivers, how to pave the streets, how to make canals.\n\nSome of Shakespeareâs plays are elaborations and dramatizations of Italian novellas. Chaucer, the father of English poetry, frankly copied from the Italian model.\n\nMilton had Dante for pioneer, Spenser had Ariosto, and Byronâs best work is in the Italian form.\n\nI presume, Doctor, that at this season of the year you are copying the style of the white man, and that you are wearing a straw hat.\n\nWell, the Latins taught us how to make straw hats.\n\nI presume that you recognize the value of glassâone of whose hundreds of uses is to show you how you look.\n\nWell, the Latin taught us how to make glass.\n\nI presume you realize how much the modern world, during the last thousand years, has been indebted to the modern ship.\n\nWell, the Latin taught the Anglo-Saxon how to build modern ships.\n\nI presume you appreciate good rice, Doctor.\n\nWell, the seed of the heavy upland rice which we have in this country was brought out of Italy in the pockets of Thomas Jeffersonâgentleman-smuggler in that instance.\n\nI presume you will wear pink silk undergarments this season as usual, wonât you, Doctor?\n\nWell, the Latin taught modern Europe how to make and use silk.\n\nAnd remember that the Latin took the clumsy musical instruments of the ancient world and fashioned them into the perfect forms of the present time; and that the Italians, whom you despise, had created the violin while your race was ârattling the bonesâ and gradually climbing toward the âcakewalk.â\n\nWhat has the negro in these United States been doing for the last thirty years, Doctor?\n\nCopying the white man. Thatâs all.\n\nHe has simply been imitating, as best he could, the dress, the talk, the manners, the methods, the work of the whites.\n\n[Pg 397]\n\nThe Latin whites originated a civilization; the negroes are copying one. Is there no difference between the higher genius which conceives and the lower talent which copies?\n\nIt required the genius of Raphael to conceive and paint âThe Transfiguration.â Any ordinary artist can make a fair copy of it. But does anyone compare the copyist with the original artist? It required the genius of Sangallo and Michelangelo to rear St. Peterâs at Rome: any well-educated architect of today might rear its duplicate. But would that make the modern architect equal to the two Italian masters?\n\nTen thousand negro men and women may be able to sit down at the piano and render Verdiâs âIl Trovatore,â but does that entitle the negroes to class themselves with the Italian composer?\n\nMy thought is thisâthe negro, assisted in every possible way by the whites, is copying the ways and learning the arts of the white man; but the fact that he can learn to read the white manâs book does not make him the equal of the white race which produced the book. The fact that he may learn from us how to practice law or medicine does not make him equal to the white race which created the code of laws and the science of medicine. It may have required a thousand years for us to learn that which we can teach him in one year, but the point is that the negro, in his native home, had just as much time and opportunity to evolve a civilization as we had, and he did not do it.\n\nLet me repeat to you, Doctor, the unvarnished truthâfor it may do you good:\n\nThe advance made by your race in America is the reflection of the white manâs civilization. Just that and nothing more. The negro lives in the light of the white manâs civilization and reflects a part of that light.\n\nHe imitates an example kept before his eyes; copies models never out of his sight; echoes the words the white man utters; patterns after the manners and the methods of the whites around him, and thus reflects our civilization.\n\nHe has originated nothing, and if the copy, the pattern, the example were taken away he would fall back as he did in Haiti.\n\nHe has never either evolved nor sustained a civilization of his own.\n\nFortunately for the Afro-American, he finds himself better situated than his brethren elsewhere. In Africa and Haiti they have to scuffle for themselves. Resultâbarbarism.\n\nIn America he swells the ranks of civilizationâs advancing army, and he has to go forward. We not only support him with aid of all sorts, we not only give him daily precept and example, but we compel him to live a better life than he would live in Africa and Haiti. This compulsion is of two kinds, the fear of punishment and the hope of rewardâthus enlisting two of the most powerful passions of the human being.\n\nIt should be significant to Doctor Washington that the only portion of his race which has ever made any development is that which has the vast advantage of being sustained, encouraged, taught, led and coerced by the whites among whom they live.\n\nNot long ago a negro preacher whose self-appreciation was as great as that of Doctor Washington went out to Liberia to subdue the heathen, in the home of the negro race.\n\nThe heathen were not subdued, but the preacher was. He threw off his store clothes, gave a whoop, gathered up an armful of wives and broke for the woods; the âCall of the Wildâ was too much for his newly soldered civilization.\n\nNow, I donât mean to say that Doctor Washington would relapse, under similar circumstances; but when I hear him call his new race Afro-Americans and listen while he soberly tells them that they are superior to the whites, I beg that he will remember his kin across the sea, his brethren in Santo Domingo, the decadents of Liberia, and the tens of thousands of his race here in this country who devoutly believe in witch doctors, in ghosts, in the conjure bag, [Pg 398] and in the power of one negro to undo another by the mysterious but invincible âTrick.â\n\nRemember this, Doctor, education is a good thing, but it never did, and never will, alter the essential character of a man or a race.\n\nOf course, Doctor, if you think your race the equal of ours, you have the right to say it. Itâs a free country, you know.\n\nBut, really, you ought not to âcrowd the monkeyâ by putting in a claim for superiority.\n\nSuch a claim does your race no good.\n\nIt may do them harm. It may cultivate a spirit of truculent self-assertion which even your warmest admirers, North and South, might find it hard to tolerate.\n\nIn the âHistory of Civilization,â Buckle says:\n\nâAbove all this, there is a far higher movement; and as the tide rolls on, now advancing, now receding, there is, amid its endless fluctuations, one thing, and one alone, which endures forever. The actions of bad men produce only temporary evil, the actions of good men only temporary good; and eventually the good and the evil altogether subside, are neutralized by subsequent generations, absorbed by the incessant movement of future ages. But the discoveries of great men never leave us; they are immortal, they contain those eternal truths which survive the shock of empires, outlive the struggle of rival creeds and witness the decay of successive religions. All these have their different measures and their different standards; one set of opinions for one age, another set for another. They pass away like a dream; they are as a fabric of a vision, which leaves not a rack behind. The discoveries of genius alone remain: it is to them we owe all that we now have, they are for all ages and for all times; never young, and never old, they bear the seeds of their own life, they flow on in a perennial and undying stream; they are essentially cumulative, and giving birth to the additions which they subsequently receive, they thus influence the most distant posterity, and after the lapse of centuries produce more effect than they were able to do even at the moment of their promulgation.â\n\nNoble lines!\n\nAnd amid these âdiscoveries of geniusâ to which âwe owe all that we now have,â bearing the seeds of intellectual life and improvement to âthe most distant posterityâ what treasures are richer than those which the Latin brings?\n\nArchitecture, Agriculture, Manufactures, Commerce, Civil Engineering, Finance, Legislation, Religious Organization, Sculpture, Painting, Music, Literature, Science, the wedding of the Fine Arts to Religionâin each and every one of these fields his genius has been creative and masterful.\n\nUpon our civilization the Latin has imposed, as an everlasting blessing, an imperishable Public Debt.\n\nWhat does civilization owe to the negro?\n\nNothing!\n\nNothing!!\n\nNothing!!!\n\nAmending the Constitution\n\nI am not one of those who believe that the Constitution of the United States is a flawless piece of workmanship.\n\nIt was not so considered by those who made it nor by those who adopted it. It never would have been ratified had it not been that amendments were promised and misrepresentation made as to the character of the instrument.\n\nThere has been a great deal of discussion recently about making a new Constitution or amending the old.\n\nWhen the Constitution was adopted a government was created of which the Constitution is the supreme law, and this cannot be changed except in the manner prescribed in the instrument itself.\n\nIf two-thirds of the states composing the Union, acting through their legislatures, shall apply to Congress for âa Constitutional convention for proposing [Pg 399] amendments,â and these amendments should be ratified by three-fourths of the states, then a practically new Constitution might be framed; but in no other legal way could the people alter the fundamental law.\n\nCongress can take the initiative by a vote of two-thirds of both Houses, and can propose amendments which, if adopted by three-fourths of the states, would become a part of the Constitution; but it must occur to all that this method of effecting reform is slow and cumbrous to the last degree.\n\nThe framers of the Constitution meant that it should be so.\n\nIn a very able article in the last number of this magazine Mr. Frederick Upham Adams discusses the necessity for amendments to the Constitution.\n\nHe cites four changes that should be made.\n\nFirst.âThe election of President and Vice-President should not be decided by a majority of the states, but by a majority of the people.\n\nSecond.âUnited States Senators should not be elected by legislatures, but by direct vote of the people of the states.\n\nThird.âThe states should be represented in the Senate according to population.\n\nFourth.âThe powers and functions of the Federal Judiciary should be enumerated and limited.\n\nI heartily concur with Mr. Adams in his view of the Federal Judiciary. It has usurped functions and powers unprecedented in the history of judicial tribunals.\n\nIn order to change the character of the government at Athens from an aristocracy to a democracy Solon gave the people control of the courts, which exercised the supreme power over laws and men. Aristotle says that by this method the people established a democracy where there had previously been an aristocracy. The aristocrat controlled the lawmaking power, but as the people controlled the judiciary a pure democracy resulted.\n\nAlexander Hamilton used the same device for the opposite purpose. He took away from the people and put into the hands of the aristocracy the supreme control over our laws and rulers, and our judiciary, thus controlled, has changed the United States, which under the old Confederation was a democracy, into an aristocracy.\n\nIt will require a Constitutional amendment to drive the usurpers from the high place in which they are entrenched, but such an amendment cannot possibly be passed through the Upper House of Congress and through the Upper Houses of three-fourths of the states until a tremendous revolution shall have taken place in public sentiment.\n\nIf we should attempt to curtail the powers of the Federal Judges by Constitutional amendment we should surely find âJordan a hard road to travel.â Most of us would be dead and forgotten before the purpose could be reached by that route.\n\nWhat, then, can be done?\n\nThe swiftest remedy for the evil lies in the election of a President who will assert his Executive Authority.\n\nThe very essence of our system of government is the Balance of Power. The Legislative function should not encroach upon the Judicial; the Executive should not invade the Legislative, and the Judicial should not usurp prerogatives belonging to the other two.\n\nInherent in each of these three departments of government lies the power of self-defense.\n\nJust as the Government, as a whole, has the inherent, inalienable right of self-preservation against external or internal attack, so each of the three separate departments of the Government has the inherent right of self-preservation as against an attack from either one or both of the other two.\n\nWhen John Marshall made the attempt to encroach upon the Executive, during the administration of Mr. Jefferson, the President treated the Court with contempt, and the Court was powerless to go forward. When [Pg 400] the same partisan Judge made a decision against the state of Georgia, which President Andrew Jackson considered unjust, the Executive refused to support the Judiciary, and the decision came to naught.\n\nWhen Chief-Justice Taney, during President Lincolnâs administration, encroached, as the President thought, upon the Executive, the Judiciary again came to grief.\n\nHad Mr. Cleveland been at heart in favor of the Income tax of 1893, the Supreme Court would never have dared to pronounce against it.\n\nThat law was based upon a principle which the Supreme Court had indorsed for a hundred years, and the first deliverance of the Judges upon the act of 1893 was favorable to it.\n\nThat act was the outcome of the work of the Legislative department acting within the scope of its authority. The Executive department had sanctioned the act, and it had become LAW.\n\nHad Cleveland boldly announced his purpose to execute that law, by virtue of his inherent power as Chief Executive, the Supreme Court would never have made the second decision, which was a national scandal.\n\nBy that decision the accumulated wealth of the millionaires is exempted from taxationârelieved of the duty of contributing to the support of the Government by whose unjust laws those millions were accumulated.\n\nBut let the people really get in power; let them really elect a President; let them place in authority another Andrew Jackson, who isnât afraid to show his friendship for the common man and his animosity to the greedy corporationâthen you will see the Supreme Court draw in its horns.\n\nFederal Judges are human like the rest of us, and they know with considerable accuracy which side their bread is buttered on.\n\nGet the right sort of man in the Executive Chair, get the right sort of men in Congress, create the right sort of public opinion, and I venture the prediction that the Federal Judiciary will not attempt the role of Dame Partington without meeting with the same luck.\n\nI agree with Mr. Adams also that Senators should be elected by the direct vote of the people in each state, but he is perhaps in error when he says that the system of electing Senators by state legislatures is âthe fountain head of the corruption of American politics.â\n\nOn the contrary, there never could have been a corrupt Senate until there was a corrupt Legislature. When New Jersey sent to the Senate a man like Jim Smith the Legislature of New Jersey had already become corrupt. When Pennsylvania sent to the Senate a man like Quay the Legislature of Pennsylvania had already become corrupt. Standard Oil had to buy the Ohio Legislature before Henry B. Payne became United States Senator.\n\nIn other words, the corrupt Senator is simply the fruit of the tree of legislative corruption, and the corrupt Legislature has been too often the result of corrupt elections.\n\nWe might as well tell the truth, and the whole truth, while we are discussing the question. Every one of us knows that elections of almost every sort, from the highest to the lowestâtown, county, state and nationalâhave been influenced by money and whisky, fraudulent practices of all sorts, the stuffed ballot-box, the doctored returns, and the Godâs truth about the matter is that the people themselves are, to a large extent, responsible for the kind of men who get into the Legislature, into the House of Representatives and into the Senate.\n\nToo many of our honest men have shirked election duty, as they have shirked jury duty; and just as ignorant or corrupt juries too often decide questions in the court house, so the ignorant or corrupt votersâpliant tools in the hands of unscrupulous politiciansâdecide questions of legislation which require the best thought and the best energies of our most intelligent and upright citizens.\n\nIf direct legislation and the Recall should be put in practice, there could [Pg 401] not be such things as corrupt legislatures, and therefore there would be no such thing as corrupt senatorial elections.\n\nThe fountain having been purified, the stream would be pure. At present the fountain itself is too often impure, and therefore the stream which flows from it cannot be pure.\n\nOn the other two points made by Mr. Adams there will be greater difference of opinion. His objections proceed upon the assumption that the United States is a nation with a government national in all particulars. Here he is at fault.\n\nOur Government is only partially national. It is Federal, also, in part. It is not altogether the one nor altogether the other.\n\nOurs is a peculiar system. To the foreign world we present the aspect of a sovereign nation. Among ourselves we are a collection of sovereign states which, for purposes stated in the preamble of the Constitution, have delegated to the central Government a portion of those powers which once belonged entirely to those sovereign states.\n\nThe state government existed before the Federal Government came into being. If the Federal Government were abolished tomorrow, each one of the states would still remain a sovereign state capable of conducting government.\n\nThe state of Connecticut, for instance, was an independent republic when there was no such thing as the United States.\n\nWould Connecticut ever have gone into an âindissoluble unionâ if she had not been assured that this union was to be composed of âindestructible statesâ? The two propositions are linked together in Constitutional law.\n\nAmong sovereigns all are, in law, equal, and each one of these states was sovereign at the time the union of states was formed.\n\nWould either of those independent sovereign states have accepted a place of inferiority in the Government? Assuredly not.\n\nThen how is the indestructibility of the states guaranteed in the Constitution? By giving the state, as a state, its full power in the United States Senate, and, in a smaller degree, in the election of Chief Magistrate.\n\nThe Constitution itself was modeled by delegates chosen, not by citizens of the United States, acting as individuals composing the entire nation, but by voters acting as citizens composing distinct and independent states to which they respectively belonged. When the completed Constitution was referred back to the people for adoption, it was not acted upon by them as citizens of the entire nation, but it was ratified by each state, acting as a state, separate and distinct from every other state. Therefore the Constitution itself is the result, not of a national, but of a Federal act.\n\nMr. Madison himself took this ground in The Federalist. The facts all prove it.\n\nIn the exercise of its legislative powers the Federal Government is both national and Federal. The House of Representatives is a national body, because it is composed of members chosen according to population. The Senate is a Federal body, because it is chosen by the states, acting as states.\n\nThe executive department of our Government also combines in itself both the national and the Federal features.\n\nThe Electoral College is composed of two messengers from each state, and also of messengers equal in number to the members which the state has in the House of Representatives.\n\nThe two messengers first mentioned correspond with the two Senators, and therefore represent the state in its Federal capacity. The other messengers correspond with the Representatives of the state in the Lower House, and as the Lower House is national, so those messengers are national.\n\nIf the people fail to elect a President, and the election is thrown into the House of Representatives, this House, which in its organization as a legislative body is national, at once becomes Federal, [Pg 402] because each state has one vote, and the voice of Ohio or Pennsylvania is not more potent than that of Rhode Island or Delaware.\n\nIt is only when our Government comes to put its laws into operation that it is purely national.\n\nIt is not strictly correct, politically or legally, to say that the United States is a nation, for a nation does not properly exist when the Government is one of limited power. That our Government is one of limited power, absolute only within the sphere of action granted to it by the states, cannot be denied. While secession has been forever decided as not being among the reserved rights of the states, there are very many other reserved rights which still belong to the states, and which always should be retained.\n\nAs the Washington Post remarked some time since: âThe United States has not a single voter, and does not hold elections for any office. All elections are state elections.â\n\nAlready there has been too much concentration of power in the central Government. To take away from the states their power of selecting Senators would be nothing short of revolution, and would lead to such a consolidation of power as would entirely change the form and spirit of our Government.\n\nIf the principles of Populism grow strong enough to carry the large states they will probably be found strong enough to carry the small states. If they be found strong enough to control the state elections, they will control national offices, because, as the Washington Post very aptly points out, the Federal Government holds no elections and has no voters: it is the state that holds the election and furnishes the voters; it is the state that prescribes the limits of the franchise, and says how, when, where and by whom these elections shall be held; and even the Federal Judiciary has not yet ventured to infringe in the slightest degree upon that reserved right of the separate states.\n\nSpeaking of the equal representation of the states in the Senate, Mr. Adams says, âThis vicious compromise was made in the Constitutional Convention as the price for the perpetuation of slavery.â\n\nThis compromise he characterizes further as âcowardly and unfair.â And he adds: âNow that the logic of events has made this a nation, despite the restrictive clauses of the Constitution, the dual participation of the unrepresentative Senate is so grotesque that its continuance is fraught with a danger which at any time is likely to precipitate civil war.â\n\nIs Mr. Adams quite sure that âthis vicious compromise was the price of the perpetuation of slaveryâ?\n\nOf course, I knew in a general way that slavery had been responsible for pretty nearly every mean old thing that has ever happened to this country; and it has always grieved me, with more or less poignancy, that New England could not have foreseen that she couldnât make slavery pay. We lost much precious time while she was discovering that she couldnât. When at length she did discover that there was no money in it for her, she thoughtfully sold most of her slaves, and went in for Emancipation.\n\nThen, to be sure, the sacred âCause of Freedomâ advanced at a gallop; but, as I said, we had lost a good deal of time waiting for New England to make her experiment, and a good deal of unhappiness resulted.\n\nBut while I knew all this, in a general way, I really was not aware that the slave-owning states in the Constitutional Convention forced Washington, Madison, Franklin and Randolph to act in the cowardly and vicious manner described by Mr. Adams.\n\nThe state of Virginia bitterly opposed the equal representation of the states in the Senate. This was strange conduct in Virginia, if the purpose of that compromise was the âperpetuation of slavery.â\n\nThe state of New Jersey was the leader of those states in the convention which demanded equal representation [Pg 403] in the Senate. If that senatorial equality was intended to perpetuate slavery, New Jerseyâs attitude was most peculiar.\n\nThis compromise which Mr. Adams calls âvicious, cowardly and unfairâ is known to constitutional history as the Connecticut Compromise. The men who championed it most ably were Roger Sherman and Oliver Ellsworth. Were these men actuated by a desire to perpetuate slavery?\n\nAll the books which I have read upon the subject state that equal representation in the Senate was a compromise which the smaller states wrung from the larger states, as the price of the union, not the price of the âperpetuation of slavery.â\n\nNew Jersey, Connecticut and Delaware were afraid to give up their independent, sovereign existence as states and to go into a union where the large states, like Pennsylvania and Virginia, would have so much greater power than themselves, if that power should be based on population.\n\nWhen New Jersey refused to consider any plan of union which did not safeguard the interests of the small states, she was not thinking of perpetuating slavery. When Roger Sherman and Oliver Ellsworth made such a determined fight to preserve, in part, the equality which then prevailed among the states, they were not thinking of perpetuating slavery. Their motive was to protect Connecticut, the small state, against Virginia and other large states.\n\nWhen Benjamin Franklin finally proposed that the Convention adopt the Connecticut idea, that aged philosopher and friend of human liberty was not acting in the interest of the slave-owners.\n\nWhen Washington gave his consent, he was not guilty of cowardice and unfairness for the purpose of protecting slavery.\n\nThese men knew perfectly well that they were exceeding their authority in making a new Constitution. They were sent there to amend the Articles of Confederation; and when New Jersey, Connecticut and Delaware took the resolute position which was voiced by Patterson, Roger Sherman and Oliver Ellsworth, Washington and Franklin both had sense enough to know that it would be utter folly to go before the people, seeking a ratification of a new Constitution, unless the difference between big states and little states had been first adjusted in the Constitutional Convention. Indeed, Rhode Island, another small state, was so jealous of her rights that she refused to send delegates to the Convention.\n\nMy authorities are Bancroftâs âHistory of the United States,â âThe Constitutional Historyâ of Landon, McMasterâs âWith the Fathers,â Hildrethâs âHistory of the United States,â Schoulerâs âHistory of the United States.â\n\nThe latter historian says expressly that the compromise under discussion âwas secured through the determination of the smaller states not to yield entirely the rule of representation which the larger states were bent on invading,â and, he adds, âthis compromise admirably preserves the composite character of our system.â\n\nThe historian declares that the smaller states expressly committed to the New Jersey plan which sought to retain the sovereignty of the states were New Jersey, Connecticut and Delaware.\n\nHildreth, in his âHistory of the United States,â takes the same position, and says: âThe party of the smaller states, known also as the State Rights Party, included the delegates from Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware and a majority of those from Maryland and New York.\n\nâThe party of the larger states, or National Party, included not only the delegates from Virginia, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, but also those from the two Carolinas and Georgia, states which anticipated a very rapid increase of population.â\n\n(I could quote Woodrow Wilson to the same effect, only Woodrow isnât worth while.)\n\n[Pg 404]\n\nNow it must occur to Mr. Adams that these facts are at war with his theory.\n\nVirginia, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, the two Carolinas and Georgia would never have been found opposing the equality of representation of the states in the Senate if the purpose of that senatorial equality was the perpetuation of the institution of slavery.\n\nThere was a compromise which the slave-owners wrung as a concession from the free states, but this compromise benefited them in the lower House, not in the Senate.\n\nWhen the Constitution gave the slave states representation based upon three-fifths of the slaves, the institution of slavery derived strength from the national idea of Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Virginiaânot from the State Rights idea of New Jersey, Delaware and Connecticut.\n\nâTake the Childrenâ\n\nIn France the Privileged Classes had created a situation which pleased them perfectly.\n\nA fifth of the soil belonged to 30,000 noble families; another fifth belonged to the clergy; another fifth belonged to the king and city governments; the remaining two-fifths belonged to all the other people, middle class and peasants.\n\nTo the support of the Government the clergy contributed nothing except as a free gift; the nobility contributed pretty much what they pleased, and they did not please to contribute a great deal.\n\nThe kingâs family spent $55,000,000 per year. Two brothers of the king spent $2,000,000; and, to pay the debts of one princely bankrupt, King Louis XVI took $3,000,000 out of the public funds.\n\nTwo hundred and ninety-five cooks served in the kingâs kitchen. Nearly two thousand horses stood in his stables. A squad of soldiers escorted his dinner to the table. A magnificent band furnished music while he ate, and a dozen gallant lords, paid for the service, helped him to undress and get to bed when the arduous do-nothing of the day had been finished.\n\nSome 30,000,000 Frenchmen did not enter into this world of privilege. The merchant, the lawyer, the doctor, the manufacturer, the farmer, the laborerâall these stood outside the pearly gates, catching only a glimpse of the radiance within, hearing only, as from a distance, the music of this Eden, created by class legislation.\n\nThe peasant neither owned his land absolutely nor himself absolutely. Over him and his was suspended the heavy sword of class privilege.\n\nThe noble hunter of game, who enjoyed the exclusive privilege of killing game, might trample down his grain with the utmost unconcern, at whatever time the pleasure of the noble huntsman dictated. Mr. Peasant was not allowed to protect his fields and crops by putting up any kind of inclosure.\n\nMr. Peasant must not kill the wild boar or the antlered stag, even though those noble beasts, reserved for noble huntsmen, were destroying the crop upon which he and his family were dependent for a living.\n\nHe could not, under any conditions whatsoever, destroy the pigeons which came sweeping down upon his grain, nor must he, during certain seasons, manure his crop or hoe out the grass, lest he injure the flavor of the young partridges, and deprive them of the shelter necessary for their comfort and growth.\n\nHe could not press his grapes save at the noblemanâs wine-press, nor grind his wheat save at the noblemanâs mill, nor bake his bread elsewhere than in the noblemanâs oven.\n\nThese monopolies were peculiar to the lord, and the peasant must pay toll lest the lordâs revenues decrease.\n\nThe peasant could not vote, had really no civic existence, was not considered in the government of the country; could be made to work whether he wished to do so or not for the noble and the king. His horses could be [Pg 405] taken from the cart, or from the plow, if his superiors demanded it. Neither for his labor nor his horse was he paid. He could not put salt into his victuals without paying a high price for it, and he was not allowed to eat his victuals unsalted. The law compelled him to buy a certain portion of salt every year at an exorbitant price.\n\nThe church took from him one-tenth of all he made, besides which he must pay fees for christenings, marriages, burials and pardons for sinsâto say nothing of prayers in behalf of the living, the dying and the dead. The feudal lord took from him annually a certain part of all he made.\n\nThe French historian Taine says that in some portions of France the peasant paid in feudal dues, church tithes and royal taxes more than three-fourths of all that he made. In other portions of France the entire net produce of the soil went to the church and state, and so great was the intolerable burden that the peasants quit in despair, left the land to become a desert waste, and flocked to the cities to swell the army of The Wretched.\n\nTo throw off the shackles of this frightful system of misgovernment the French Revolutionist roused the people.\n\nAt first Great Britain rejoiced in the movement which Lafayette, Mirabeau, Necker, SieyÃ¨s and Camille Desmoulins inaugurated. These early revolutionists declared their purpose to set up a constitutional government in France such as Great Britain enjoyed, but when these moderate and constitutional reformers were thrown aside by the radical democrats who were determined to establish a republicâwhen this democracy had confiscated the lands held by the church, had issued paper money and had taken for national uses the abandoned estates of the immigrant nobles, the ruling powers of church and state in Great Britain became greatly alarmed, and it was resolved that war to the death should be waged against the principles of the French Revolution.\n\nUnless this were done, democracy might assert itself in Great Britain, and those things which had been taken from the people under forms of law might be restored in the same way to the original owners. Therefore William Pitt, Prime Minister and actual ruler of Great Britain, declared war upon France, blockaded her coasts, organized European kings into confederacies against her, and for more than a dozen dreadful years poured armed legions upon her.\n\nDuring this era of âblood and ironâ men were torn from peaceful pursuits throughout Great Britain to supply the navy and the army with food for powder.\n\nAs a necessary consequence, the demand for labor was greater than the supply; and as England depends especially upon her manufactures, it was there that the scarcity of labor was most injuriously felt.\n\nIt is said that a deputation representing the manufacturers waited upon the Prime Minister and laid their grievances before him, asking the question, âWhat must we do?â\n\nMr. Pitt is reported to have answered, âTake the Children.â\n\nThis story may not be true, but it is a fact that it represented precisely the emergency, and the manner in which that emergency was met. It also represents correctly the attitude of Mr. Pitt as defined in his speeches in Parliament.\n\nA cruel, unjustifiable war had devoured the laborer who should have been at his task. The laws had dragged him into the army and into the navy whether he wished to go or not. Press-gangs had prowled about the lanes and alleys clutching at every poor man who happened to be sound of limb, and had carried him off by force into a battleship, where he might be kept until the bride whom he had left at the church door had counted him as dead, or until the family which he had left contented and happy had been lost to the knowledge of men.\n\nHaving taken the father, the same remorseless class-greed demanded the child, and took it.\n\nUpon the altar of English lust for [Pg 406] money has been sacrificed more helpless men, women and children than ever fell before the ruthless hordes of Tamerlane or Attila.\n\nâWithin carefully guarded limits, child-labor is no more to be objected to in manufactures than in agriculture, but in the early days of the factory system these limits were utterly discarded.\n\nâIn the infancy of the system it became the custom of the master manufacturers to contract with the managers of workhouses throughout England and of the charities of Scotland, to send their young children to the factories of the great towns. Many thousands of children between the ages of six and ten were thus sent, absolutely uncared for and unprotected, and left to the complete disposal of masters who often had not a single thought except speedily to amass a fortune, and who knew that if the first supply of infant labor were used up there was still much more to be obtained.\n\nâThousands of children at this early age might be found working in the factories of England and Scotland, usually from twelve to fourteen, sometimes even fifteen and sixteen hours a day, not unfrequently during the greater part of the night. Destitute or drunken or unnatural parents made it a regular system to raise money by hiring out their children from six, sometimes from five, years old, by written contracts and for long periods. In one case brought before Parliament a gang of these children was put up for sale among a bankruptâs effects, and publicly advertised as part of the property. In another an agreement was disclosed between a London parish and a Lancashire manufacturer in which it was stipulated that with every twenty sound children one idiot should be taken.â\n\nâEven as late as 1840, when the most important manufactures had been regulated by law, Lord Ashley was able to show that boys employed in the carpet manufacture at Kidderminster were called up at three and four in the morning, and kept working sixteen or eighteen hours: that children five years old were engaged in the unhealthy trade of pin-making, and were kept at work from six in the morning to eight at night.â (Lecky, âEngland in Eighteenth Century.â)\n\nIn the coal mines and in the salt mines men, women and children were literally beasts of burdenâwere chattels, and when the mines were sold the human machines passed from one owner to another just as the mechanical apparatus passed.\n\nThere were women who in these coal mines, where the tunnels were too narrow to allow them to stand upright, had to crawl back and forward on their hands and knees for fourteen to sixteen hours a day, drawing after them the trucks loaded with coal.\n\nThese trucks were securely fastened to the woman by means of a chain which passed between her legs and was attached to a belt strapped round her waist. The woman seldom wore any clothes except an old pair of trousers made of sacking.\n\nâLittle children were forced to work underground from year to year. Deep in the gloom of a night which had neither moonlight nor stars; rarely ever seeing the face of nature and of dayâlost to Godâs glory of sunlight, shady woods, silvery watersâlost to intelligence, happiness, enjoyment, reduced to the helpless condition of beasts of burden.â\n\nWhat was true of the mines was also true of the factories.\n\nMen, women and children were forced to work for a number of hours absolutely inconsistent with physical and moral development.\n\nIn the year 1833 Lord Ashley led in the noble effort to redeem the children from the clutches of unscrupulous commercialism, and to lighten the burden of men and women by regulating the hours of labor and the conditions of service.\n\nAfter a most stubborn resistance, in which the corporations urged against [Pg 407] the reform every reason which we hear urged in our day, England did herself the immense credit of checking the tyranny of those who were grinding the lives out of the poor in order that the rich should become richer.\n\nIn this country the cry of commercialism is the same as that which in Great Britain said, âTake the children.â\n\nCorporations want cheap labor. If they canât get the adult, they take the child.\n\nIn the Southern states the tendency to employ children has had alarming development. In 1880 the total number of cotton factory employees was 16,740. Of these, 4,090 were children under sixteen years of age. In the year 1900 the total number of employees had increased to 97,559. Of these, 24,459 were children under sixteen years of age.\n\nIn the states outside of the South there were, in 1880, 155,803 employees in cotton factories. Of this number, 24,243 were children under sixteen years of age. In the year 1900 the total number of cotton factory employees in states outside of the South was 205,302. Of these, only 15,796 were children under sixteen years of age.\n\nIn other words, within the Southern states the children under sixteen years of age constitute now, as they did twenty years ago, 25 per cent. of all the operatives employed: whereas, in the states outside the South the children under sixteen number less than 8 per cent. of all those employed. Therefore the situation which was justly considered so bad in Great Britain that it was reformed seventy years ago, and which has been reformed in most of the states outside of the South, is three times worse in the South than it is in any other portion of the Union, and is just as bad now as it was twenty years ago.\n\nIn The Tradesman, of Chattanooga, Tenn., August 15, 1902, the statement is made that the number of children under sixteen years of age now at work in the Southern mills approximated 50,000.\n\nThe 50,000 little ones who troop to the mill every morning, breathe the steam-heated, dust-laden, germ-infected atmosphere of the close rooms throughout the entire day, who light, with lanterns, their way home across the fields when darkness has fallen, are white children. During the same hours that these white boys and girls are finding their way to the factory where their energy and strength is offered up as a sacrifice to mammon, 50,000 black children are singing merrily on their way to school, where they are gaining what the white children are losing.\n\nGlance forward twenty years and ask yourselves what will be the relative positions of the 50,000 white children and the 50,000 black children. It will be a miracle if most of those white children are not either in their graves, or in the hospitals, or in the slums, or in the prisons, while the 50,000 black children will be holding clerkships in some department of the Federal Government.\n\nThe kind of civilization which we are going to have in the future is being determined now. Race development and progress cannot be extemporized or bought ready-made. It is a matter of preparing the soil, planting the seed, cultivating the crop.\n\nWe shall reap as we shall have sown.\n\nThe most profoundly disgusting feature of the Southern political situation today is that the Democratic bosses who control our state legislatures will not allow us to give our white children as good treatment as the negro children are getting.\n\nAlmost universally the Southern mills are controlled by Northern capitalists; but it is the Southern politician, officeholder, editor or stockholder who rushes to the legislature saying that child slavery must continue because it is good for the child.\n\nThese Northern capitalists who own Southern mills are, to a large extent, Republicans in politics. The unprincipled Southern men who put up a plea in behalf of child slavery are almost exclusively Democratic.\n\n[Pg 408]\n\nJust as J. P. Morgan, the Republican railroad king, uses the Southern Democratic machine to rob the people through his railroads, so the Northern Republican millowner uses the Southern Democratic politician to rivet upon the Southern white child the chains of commercial serfdom, ruinous to the child and ominous to the future of the white race in the South.\n\nIt was class-greed which first raised the cry, âTake the children.â It is class-greed which now says, âTake the Children.â\n\nPaternalism\n\nOne of the dreadfulest words that ever scared a mossback is âPaternalism.â\n\nHe does not know what it means, and he does not want to know. He flees from it as from something too blood-curdling to look upon. His leaders, his orators, his editors, have all told him that no language could fully describe the horrors of âPaternalismâ; and therefore he feels that while poverty, slavery, hunger and starvation are sometimes annoying incidents in life, they bear no comparison to the pitiless rigors of âPaternalism.â\n\nHe has got used to unmerciful taxes, to ill-paid labor, to squalid surroundings, to empty pockets, and to the cry of children hungering for bread. All these discomforts he can stand, because they have come to him in the natural course of events under the rule of Democracy and Republicanism. But the very idea of a new party springing up and practicing âPaternalismâ unnerves him. He fears he couldnât stand it.\n\nWe had this terror-stricken victim of Democratic bugabooism in mind today when we read the decision of Clevelandâs Attorney-General, to the effect that whisky in a bonded warehouse could not be reached by process from a State Court.\n\nUnder a law which has stealthily slipped upon the statute-book while the people were not noticing, the producers of distilled liquors get the privilege of storing their âfirewaterâ in a government warehouse and getting a certificate of deposit.\n\nThe Government takes care of the whisky until the owner feels like paying a tax upon it.\n\nFormerly, under an act passed by Republicans and Democrats, this exemption from tax lasted three years. At the last session of Congress the Democrats, out of tender consideration for the poor, downtrodden Whisky Trust, extended this exemption to eight years.\n\nThe great and good Government of the United States, therefore, steps forward through its officers, and kindly says to the distiller: âHand me your whisky bottle: Iâll take care of it for you until you get ready to pay your taxes.â\n\nNot only does our great and good Government say substantially these very words to the distiller, but it guards his whisky bottle so jealously that no writ or execution or other process from a State Court is allowed to touch the liquor which is thus being held by the Government for the benefit of the owner.\n\nGovernor Tillman, of South Carolina, tried to bring his power as Chief Magistrate of a sovereign state to bear on some of the whisky which Uncle Sam was taking care of for the Whisky Trust, but the voice of our great and good Government was promptly heard saying, âKeep off the Grass.â\n\nBrave Benjamin had to let the whisky alone.\n\nThe certificate of deposit issued on the liquor by the Government to the distiller becomes at once valuable commercial paper upon which he can get any amount of money he wants.\n\nHe can go to New York, borrow money on his certificate at 2 per cent., and use it for eight years without difficulty, because the money-lenders have the certificate which shows to them that the Government is taking good care of the whisky all the time.\n\nIs this âPaternalismâ?\n\nIf so, please donât mention it to the [Pg 409] mossback whom we have described. It might make him run away and tear the buggy up.\n\nPlanting Corn\n\nThe bluebird was out today; out in his glossiest plumage, his throat gurgling with song.\n\nFor the sunlight was warm and radiant in all the South, and the coming spring had laid its benediction on every field and hedge and forest.\n\nThe smell of newly plowed ground mingled with the subtle incense of the yellow jasmine; and from every orchard a shower of the blossoms of peach and apple and pear was wafted into"
