        "text": "Louise Millicent Thurston\n\nAnother biographical cipher who enjoyed brief success as a series author is Louise M. Thurston.\n\nLouisa Millicent Thurston was born in Lancaster, Massachusetts, September 19, 1842, to Wilder Stoddard Thurston (1806-1883) and Rosanna Melicent Pierce (1817-1846). [1] She grew up with two sisters: Clara Wilder (b. June 19, 1838) and Ellen Elizabeth (b. March 31, 1845). Her mother died of consumption when Louisa was four. Shortly after her sixth birthday, her father remarried, but that stepmother, Caroline M. Laughton Thurston, died of consumption only thirteen months later. [2] On September 29, 1852 (the day after his previous wedding anniversary), Louise's father again remarried, this time to Susan Dodge, who had been part of the household since at least June 1850. [3] Years later, Thurston's series fiction would show the importance of siblings and friends along with the instability of the nuclear family, and it is tempting to speculate that her own childhood was one influence for such plots.\n\nAlthough the family may have experienced emotional hardships, census records indicate Louisa's father was flourishing financially. In 1850, he was listed as a \"merchant,\" with real estate valued at $6,000. The family may have taken in boarders, for in addition to the three girls and Susan Dodge, the household included five other occupants -- 54-year-old Benjamin Morse, a manufacturer; 60-year-old Benjamin F. Tidd, a farmer, and his wife Nancy; Timothy Hager, age 19, a laborer; and 75-year-old Isabella Ingelsbee. The Thurstons moved to Lynn, Massachusetts, in 1857, and by 1860, Wilder S. Thurston, now \"a trader,\" had real estate valued at $18,000 and personal property worth an additional $8,000. Louisa's older sister Clara was employed as a teacher at a \"com [?] school,\" and the family still had boarders -- three salesmen, ages 17 to 26 -- as well as a domestic servant. By 1870, the household had shrunk to three, with only Louisa left at home. Wilder, listed as a \"grocer,\" owned real estate valued at $45,000 and personal property at $6,000. Louisa, following in her sister's footsteps, was now a teacher.\n\nBetween the 1860 and 1870 census, a number of changes had taken place in the family. Louisa's older sister Clara married Thomas E. Fry in October, 1862, and the couple moved to New York, then to Chicago by 1870. Her younger sister Ellen married Myron Leonard circa 1868; by 1870, she, too, was living in Chicago with her husband and his relatives. [4]\n\nIn May 1867, in an attempt to acquire more material for Sunday-School libraries, the Sunday-school Society held a competition offering three cash prizes (or premiums) \"for the best three manuscripts of books calculated for Unitarian Sunday-school libraries and adapted to children under ten years of age.\" Twenty-nine manuscripts were submitted, and \"Miss Louise M. Thurston [of] Lynn, Mass.\" received the third premium -- $25 -- for Forrest Mills: A Peep at Child-Life from Within. The book was published by the Sunday-School Society in 1868. Why she -- or the publishers -- chose to alter her name from Louisa to Louise is not known, nor is it known whether the committee awarding the prizes was aware that the second-place manuscript -- Little Spendid's Vacation \"By Mrs. C. W. T. Fry, Chicago, Ill.\" -- was the work of her older sister. [5]\n\nLouisa's only other book publications were the four volumes in the Charley Roberts series. How Charley Roberts Became a Man was issued in 1870. No author was named: the book was published as \"By the author of 'Forrest Mills'--a prize story\"; the second volume, How Eva Roberts Gained Her Education, carried the same attribution. Lee & Shepard's publicity for the series, however, did include the author's name, advertising it as \"Miss Louise M. Thurston's Charley Roberts Series\" and the fourth volume listed her as author. The series was generally well-received: Godey's Lady's Book praised the first two volumes as \"entertaining and instructive stories,\" and the reviewer in Catholic World called the third volume \"an excellent story,\" adding that \"The characters are full of life.\" [6] Thurston's sisters' influence was evident in at least one aspect of the series. Not only was book three, Charley and Eva's Home in the West, set in Chicago, but it was dedicated to \"Sister Nellie, whose dear companionship made 'home' for my childhood, and whose holier wifehood sweetens and brightens one 'home in the west'.\"\n\nAlthough Louisa's older sister Clara seems to have stopped publishing after her first book (restricting her writing to poems for social events), her younger sister Ellen supposedly was \"an occasional contributor to the Christian Register, etc.\" [7] Like Ellen, Louisa also apparently wrote for periodicals, including \"Chicago Magazines, Ladies' Repository, [and] The Commonwealth\" [8] No record of any articles signed by Thurston has been found in the online archives of Ladies' Repository, but she did contribute at least one story to The Chicago Fashion Magazine -- \"Lame Betsy's Story,\" in the August 1871 issue.
