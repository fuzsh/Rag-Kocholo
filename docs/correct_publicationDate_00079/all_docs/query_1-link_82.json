        "text": "‚ÄúI can‚Äôt go (insert the hobby that makes you feel alive here) because I‚Äôm so exhausted from work, all I can do is be a vegetable on the couch with my phone.‚Äù This phrase crept into my internal narrative about 18 months ago when work hit a new level of intensity. I stopped going on my fly fishing trips, putting it off until ‚Äúnext month when things lighten up‚Äù Spoiler: they never lightened up. As a full year went by without my beloved hobby, I thought back to the 150 older white men at the fly fishing club on that fateful night in 2017 and no one else. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre the only ones that have the time and money!‚Äù I told myself. ‚ÄúI have bills to pay. If the work is here, I need to do it. No time to fish.‚Äù And then last month, my treasure of a nephew told me the only thing he wanted for his 18th birthday was to take him fly fishing in the Grand Canyon. Like I could say no! Lee‚Äôs Ferry is legit one of my favorite places in the world, which is reason #327 I love fly fishing. It takes me to places I would have otherwise never taken the time to see. Our boat captain took us upriver and our first hole was literally Horseshoe Bend. You know that infamous photo that everyone posts to social media when they‚Äôre driving by? Next time you‚Äôre there, look down to the river and wave to the fly fishers! I slid out of the boat and into the most beautiful water in the continental US. I thanked Mother Nature for the water and myself for actually making the time to do this. And Truth hit me like a ton of bricks. Life didn‚Äôt get hard because it got busy. Life got hard because I stopped feeding my soul. Life is always busy and it always will be, for me. And therefore if I don‚Äôt make time to restore with experiences that I know fill me back up (which is NOT couch lounging for me), then life will feel hard. I didn‚Äôt find the thing that works every single time, the thing that lights me up, that shuts down all the mental tabs and makes me feel restored - I didn‚Äôt find it till I was 37! It's such a gift and I‚Äôm determined to not take it for granted. So please, the next time you and I find ourselves in the same meeting, please ask me. ‚ÄúGone fishing lately?‚Äù\n\nI'm in a movie that launches on AppleTV in a couple of weeks. Wild, I know. Also, it's an award-winning movie. As in, it's won multiple grand jury prizes, like at the LA film festival. I'll put the link to the trailer in the comments. It's hard for me to wrap my head around it, because we originally filmed over four years ago. We did the film festival circuit in 2022 and 2023. This year the producers secured a deal with a distributor and here we are. Presales on AppleTV have already begun and are measured to determine how much promotional backing the film will get after launch. To get those pre-sales I've been doing a whole ton of media interviews. Where I answer questions about why I enrolled myself in conversion therapy, what happened to me, how it affected my family, etc. I think back to who I was then, and how she was just trying her best. My life 1.0 version of me, she was always trying so hard: to be the best wife, the best mom, the best daughter of God, she could possibly be. So here's my list of things I wish I could tell the old version of me, the one that will be up on TV screens across the world starting next month: ‚è≥ It's 2024. And it's definitely not a phase, babe. LOL üíú You are NOT a bad mom. Conversion therapy tried real hard to convince you otherwise and I know you're still wrestling with the idea so just know, that thought is false, and you and the kids are closer than you've ever been. üåà Speaking of the kids, you know the stats and Gen Z. Start getting ready for one (or more) of them to come out to YOU. You are paving the way for them, keep going! üö´ After you film this movie, you'll go on to testify at several state legislatures and closed-door meetings with politicians. Your own governor will sign the executive order to ban conversion therapy for minors in your home state. And Canada will ban it all together, with no religious exemptions! You are making a difference. I am making a difference. It's such a simple, almost pithy statement but man, I need to feel it today. It hasn't been the easiest Pride Month and honestly, I think I wrote this whole post just so I could feel the relief that comes with those words. I am making a difference. Old Me. Current Me. Future Me. Future Us. We're all just trying to make a difference. Keep going.\n\nCould you describe your life‚Äôs work in 5 minutes in front of an audience that has the power to pay you for said life‚Äôs work? If your answer is ‚ÄúHold my beer‚Äù you‚Äôre my people. Because that‚Äôs pretty much what I said when my friend Themba Dayton told me about DisruptHR Seattle. I hadn‚Äôt had a challenge like that since giving my TEDx talk in 2019. I learned so much and it has truly allowed me to clarify my message. Okay but also, Lez Be Real. I was the only speaker on the stage that included several (almost all) personal photos (in the auto-advancing slides). When the master slide deck came back to us for approval, of course I checked out everyone else‚Äôs slides. And had a serious gut check. ‚ÄúMaybe we aren‚Äôt doing *that*, *here*.‚Äù And then I utilized my queer superpower to not give a rip, because I‚Äôve already had the hardest conversations and experiences I‚Äôm ever going to have. I survived conversion therapy. I survived losing my best friend of 20+ years. I survived a two-year divorce that ended an 18-year marriage and coming out to my four kids. This? This is easy. (Preparing for it was not actually easy. My secret weapon is my amazing speaking mentor Jill Davis who was my OG TEDx coach and has stayed with me ever since. In all honesty, my talk is badass and she is a big reason why.) I teach leaders and teams how to create Radical Self-Inclusion as the antidote for allyship shame, which allows us to become the leaders and humans we actually want to be. I teach Radical Self-Inclusion because it saved my life. Period. I know how much your team members (and your loved ones) need you to develop these skills. Because they need YOU, not your internalized ‚Äòisms and externally imposed values. They need YOU. And they need you to just.stay.\n\nWith some exciting new developments on the horizon, I thought it was a great time to reintroduce myself. Whether it‚Äôs your first visit or you‚Äôve been part of this community for a while, welcome and thank you for joining. I‚Äôm Elena Joy, she/her. After navigating significant personal transformations, including coming out and advocating against conversion therapy‚Äîas featured in the award-winning documentary, CONVERSION‚ÄîI've channeled my journey into advocating for safer, more inclusive work environments. As CEO of Latitude, I work with companies like Peloton and Planned Parenthood, focusing on creating psychological safety on corporate teams. I'm also an experienced public speaker, having shared my insights on stages like TEDx and DisruptHR events, covering topics including Radical Self-Inclusion, allyship, and my own queer experience. I live in Arizona with my fantastic four children, and on my off days you can likely find me spending time with them or planning my next fly-fishing trip. I can‚Äôt wait to share more about the exciting things I‚Äôve been up to soon and continue to connect with you on queerness, inclusion, speaking, and of course, some fly fishing here and there. Thank you for being here. üé£‚ô• #deiconsultant #queerbusinessowners #womanrunbusiness #queercommunity #diversityandinclusion #queerpublicspeakers\n\nI implemented my first Disability Day Protocol last month and it saved my butt. My flavor of disability comes with intense pain flare-ups that tank my productivity for 1-3 days with no warning, a few times a month for the last 11 years. The mental mess this creates is half the impact on my business. When it happened two weeks ago, I stood on the precipice of the usual mental swirl of self-blame and frustration, and was able to make a different choice that day. I called Coach. My clients who have taken my team's vocal empowerment workshop or my executive coaching, understand that \"Coach\" is the inner voice we give the mic to when life stuff is about to hit the fan. Coach is curious and objective. Coach asks questions to open doors that I can't see. And Coach said, \"If one of your team members was in this situation, what would you do?\" That put my brain into accessibility and inclusion mode, where the answer was clear. \"Identify the accommodations you need. Your team is ready to support you and remove barriers.\" So I created a Disability Day Protocol for myself and proceeded to lose only minimum productivity while allowing me to connect with my clients and team. This included: replacing texting and emailing with voice notes for the day, setting up for the day in a different location with different light, and a few other weirder things (#emotionalsupporthoodie FTW). A couple weeks later I had the pleasure of hosting a fireside chat with Lorie Sandaine for the Tucson LGBT Chamber of Commerce. She is an expert in employment support for the disabled community. She taught me to think of accommodations as flexibility, as that's all that most accommodations are and it feels way more accessible. We all need flexibility. She also helped me see that my \"invisible\" disability often makes me feel invisible at a time when I need to be seen. I'm trying out the phrase \"non-apparent disability\" instead which feels way more aligned. I am still on my journey to understanding how my internalized ableism affects my business and therefore income. One thing I know, every time I create more inclusion within myself, I create the ability to be authentically more inclusive of those I work with. #radicalselfinclusion\n\nHR help, please. I am co-authoring a white paper for my Human Resources peeps, focused on Trauma Sensitivity Skills and how they can support HR practitioners at work. If you are in HR/People & Culture/Operations, will you please help by filling out our 15-question survey? It takes 5-7 minutes. In addition to the survey, we are interviewing subject matter experts like Rebecca A. Eldredge, PhD, June C. Parks, Ph.D., Dr. Lynyetta Willis, and co-author Shae Noble, SHRM-SCP with Trauma-Informed HR, who is speaking on the topic at the upcoming conference for SW SHRM: Southwest Washington Society of Human Resource Management. The report will be published this summer and there is a link to sign up for a free copy in the survey. Pretty much every HR leader knows we need trauma sensitivity training, but it's really hard to get the budget for it without some data to back us up. I'm hoping this report will provide that for you. And if you share this link with your network, you will get a huge thank you note from me in your DMs. I write amazing thank you notes. Not even kidding, it will make your day. (I'm going to put the link in the comments because my intern told me the LinkedIn Gods prefer it that way.)"
