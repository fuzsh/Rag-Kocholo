        "text": "Category Archives: Books\n\nBooks of 2019\n\nAs I do every year, I’ve kept a list of the books I read, their dates of publication, and my ratings of them. Below are two lists of favorites (best nonfiction and best fiction), plus the entire list of books I read in 2019. I read a total of 219 books this year, which seems fitting for 2019. I did include individual issues of comics and some children’s books here, which might seem like a cheat, but I also didn’t count many, many, many of the kids books I read this year with my kids. I only included a small handful of the most memorable ones.\n\nFirst, favorites! I’m listing them in alphabetical order in each category. I couldn’t possibly rank the lists; narrowing it this far was hard enough!\n\nBest Nonfiction:\n\nIsaac Butler and Dan Kois, The World Only Spins Forward: The Ascent of Angels in America (2018)\n\nThis might be only for the reader who loves Angels in America, but that’s me, so I loved it!\n\nCasey Cep, Furious Hours: Murder, Fraud, and the Last Trial of Harper Lee (2019)\n\nFascinating true crime, literary history, and regional history all at once.\n\nJeffrey Jerome Cohen, Stone: An Ecology of the Inhuman (2015)\n\nA rare academic book that is not only intellectually fascinating and relevant to my research but also moving.\n\nAriel Gore, Hexing the Patriarchy: 26 Potions, Spells, and Magical Elixirs to Embolden the Resistance (2019)\n\nFun, feminist witchery!\n\nTaisia Kitaiskaia, Ask Baba Yaga: Otherworldly Advice for Everyday Troubles (2017)\n\nAdvice in the form of prose poems, from the perspective of a powerful, self-possessed witch.\n\nIbram X. Kendi, How to Be an Antiracist (2019)\n\nThe title says it all. I’m teaching it this semester!\n\nRax King, The People’s Elbow (2018)\n\nA short memoir that somehow effectively combines a narrative about rape and trauma with an obsession with Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. The best accidental find of the year!\n\nCarmen Maria Machado, In the Dream House (2019)\n\nA brilliant memoir of an abusive relationship. Machado is a beautiful writer, and this was really hard to read but worth it.\n\nMallory O’Meara, The Lady from the Black Lagoon: Hollywood Monsters and the Lost Legacy of Milicent Patrick (2019)\n\nIf I were ranking my Top Ten, this might be #1. O’Meara’s book is hilarious and filled with fascinating film history. Plus, I had several feminist “fuck yeah!” reactions, even in just the first few pages. Everyone should read this book.\n\nNicole Seymour, Bad Environmentalism: Irony and Irreverence in the Ecological Age (2018)\n\nAnother academic book that I truly enjoyed reading!\n\nBest Fiction:\n\nCharlie Jane Anders, The City in the Middle of the Night (2019)\n\nCool worldbuilding and aliens! Queer characters! Beautiful writing! I read this with a student reading group in the spring, and they all loved it, too.\n\nPat Barker, The Silence of the Girls (2018)\n\nA retelling of The Iliad from the perspective of the women in the background of those tales of war and conquest.\n\nRobert Jackson Bennett, Foundryside (2018)\n\nBennett remains one of my favorite fantasy writers. This is a fun adventure story that ultimately has something powerful to say about self-determination.\n\nChelsea Cain (ill. Kate Niemczyk and Lia Miternique), Man-Eaters, Vol. 1 (2019)\n\nIt’s a comic book about periods, cats, toxoplasmosis, and violence! It’s fun!\n\nCherie Dimaline, The Marrow Thieves (2017)\n\nYA science fiction about North American indigenous people, loss of culture, and resilience.\n\nMeg Elison, The Book of the Unnamed Midwife (2014)\n\nAnother dystopia, this one focused on dangers to women. Deadly childbirth and masculinist enclaves. Terrifying. Also, I met Meg at an event earlier this year, and she is super cool.\n\nAmal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone, This Is How You Lose the Time War (2019)\n\nI’m sometimes iffy about time travel narratives, but I loved this one. It’s a love story that gives it a real emotional core beyond the thinky bits. I loved this book so much that on my one full day in Chicago on my own, I opted to sit in a coffee shop and read this until I devoured the whole thing instead of going to more places.\n\nAriel Gore, We Were Witches (2017)\n\nIt’s not as much about witchcraft as the title might indicate, but I loved it anyway.\n\nPeter Heller, The River (2019)\n\nMen bonding out in nature. This book reminds me of both Deliverance and Brokeback Mountain in various ways. The end made me cry in public. No regrets.\n\nN. K. Jemisin, Broken Earth series: The Fifth Season (2015), The Obelisk Gate (2016), The Stone Sky (2017)\n\nYes, I’m cheating here. I don’t care. I loved this series so much. I read this whole series with another student reading group in the spring, and they loved it, too! I just can’t believe I waited so long before reading it. This series more than deserves all the hype it has gotten and all the awards it has won.\n\nGuy Gavriel Kay, A Brightness Long Ago (2019)\n\nKay is a beautiful fantasy writer (I’ve long loved his Fionavar Tapestry series), and this is a really lovely, reflective story that’s actually mostly about aging and memory.\n\nStephen King, Pet Sematary\n\nThis is another one that made me cry while reading it in public. I honestly can’t decide if I love or hate this book because I found it so intensely upsetting.\n\nAnn Leckie, The Raven Tower (2019)\n\nI know Leckie primarily as a science fiction writer (space opera, cool AI, etc.), so I was both excited and hesitant with her shift to fantasy, but this book is so great. Honestly, I read it a while ago, so I don’t remember many details, but I remember I loved it.\n\nArkady Martine, A Memory Called Empire (2019)\n\nScience fiction with a complex world, an interesting protagonist, and very neat technology! Its best feature is its attention to power and politics, though.\n\nTamsyn Muir, Gideon the Ninth (2019)\n\nLesbian necromancers! A snarky heroine! Adventures! This was a wonderfully fun book.\n\nAnnalee Newitz, The Future of Another Timeline (2019)\n\nThis book gives me hope. It’s another time travel book, featuring alternate histories, with an eye to the possibility of creating a better future. Central settings include an alternate SoCal feminist punk scene and the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago, which means I am inherently into this! It also addresses reproductive rights and feminist history in both direct and complicated ways. It’s almost like she wrote it just for me!\n\nHelen Phillips, The Need (2019)\n\nA dark story about motherhood, one that I found quite upsetting at times. It reminds me in some ways of Samanta Schweblin’s Fever Dream – just as with that book, I didn’t always like reading it, but I also couldn’t stop.\n\nRichard Powers, The Overstory (2018)\n\nI bought this book ages ago, simply because I’ve always loved Powers’ writing, and I finally (just within the last week) found enough time and mental bandwidth to read it. It was so worth waiting for! It’s a book about trees that has me excited about learning more botany. It’s a book about activism that inspires. It’s long, but I plan to teach it in my environmental lit & culture class next fall (and I really hope the students like it!).\n\nLina Rather, Sisters of the Vast Black (2019)\n\nNuns in space! That makes it sound silly, but it’s a thoughtful novella about politics and religion in a society expanding across space.\n\nKaren Thompson Walker, The Dreamers (2019)\n\nA pandemic causes the people of a small town to fall asleep. It’s quietly frightening.\n\nAnd here is the entire list of books I read this year, complete with ratings. Five-star books are in bold; there are more five-star books than made my lists above.\n\nJanuary\n\nDavid Graeber, Bullshit Jobs: A Theory (2018) – 4 stars\n\nAlexis Turner, Taxidermy (2013) – 4 stars\n\nJoyce Carol Oates, Hazards of Time Travel (2018) – 3 stars\n\nJames Tynion IV (ill.

I wound up with a nice, even 20 for my list of favorites and rather than ranking them or listing them somewhat randomly, I’ll separate them into categories.\n\nFiction\n\nSamanta Schweblin, Fever Dream (2017): This might be my favorite book of the last year. I intensely disliked it at first, but it grew on me and profoundly disturbed me. I’m teaching it this semester in my environmental lit, film, and culture class, so I’ll see how I feel upon re-reading it and discussing it. I’m also trying to work out something more critical to say in article form.\n\nJohn Langan, The Fisherman (2016): A great horror novel with a strong emotional core.\n\nJohn Green, Turtles All the Way Down (2017): C’mon, it’s John Green. As always, he made me cry. I’m seriously considering teaching this one in my Fall 2018 Intro to Humanities course (which will likely focus on disability and illness).\n\nRobert Jackson Bennett, City of Miracles (2017): This book is the conclusion of one of my favorite fantasy series. I cannot recommend these books highly enough. They have all the trappings of fantasy that you might expect, but/and (choose your conjunction depending on your previous experience with fantasy) they do a fantastic job digging into the consequences and resonances of both political and personal action.\n\nLouise Erdrich, Future Home of the Living God (2017): A bit of a departure for Erdrich in some ways, but just as heartbreaking and smart as usual. This one made me sob.\n\nBiography / Memoir\n\nTrevor Noah, Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood (2016): Noah shines here in narrative form. Based on this book and his standup, I think his talents and skills are wasted on The Daily Show.\n\nSherman Alexie, You Don’t Have to Say You Love Me (2017): It’s Sherman Alexie. It’s great.\n\nRoxane Gay, Hunger: A Memoir of (My) Body (2017): It’s Roxane Gay. It’s great.\n\nAnne Finger, Elegy for a Disease: A Personal and Cultural History of Polio (2006): This was the last book I read this year and so it’s fresh. It may not stick as strongly as some others, but it is an excellent memoir about living with the effects of polio. What I really loved about it is that – as the title indicates – it doesn’t simply focus on the individual experience but is constantly placing that individual experience in the context of the cultural (while also providing a vivid look into Finger’s life).\n\nGerry Canavan, Octavia E. Butler (2016): This could go in the following section as well, really, but the main draw for me here was the glimpse into Butler’s personal life and writing process. She’s one of my favorite sf writers, and Canavan’s presentation of his research is both scholarly and readable.\n\nCriticism / Theory\n\nStacy Alaimo, Exposed: Environmental Politics and Pleasures in Posthuman Times (2016): I will be returning to this book repeatedly in my own work, as I always do with her work.\n\nStephanie Lemenager, Living Oil: Petroleum Culture in the American Century (2013): Brilliant and fascinating. I particularly loved the chapter in which she explores museum presentations of petroleum.\n\nSara Ahmed, Living a Feminist Life (2017): Not only did I love what Ahmed had to say here about feminism in the academy (and in life) but I loved how she said it. I found myself marking almost every page.\n\nEli Clare, Brilliant Imperfection: Grappling with Cure (2017): Yet another beautifully written and fascinating book. Clare’s exploration of disability, sexuality, and environment here is complex in all the best ways.\n\nArt / Graphic Novel\n\nLuigi Serafini, Codex Seraphinianus (1981): Nonsense, but such interesting nonsense.\n\nJoanna Ebenstein, The Anatomical Venus: Wax, God, Death & the Ecstatic (2016): I had never read much about this bit of history before, so I learned a lot from this book (and have used it in my teaching since) and it is a beautifully constructed book with tons of pictures.\n\nRichard Misrach and Kate Orff, Petrochemical America (2012): A combination of photography and infographics about Cancer Alley in Louisiana. I will be teaching this in my environmental lit, film, and culture course as well, and I am so curious to see what my students make of it.\n\nGrady Hendrix, Paperbacks from Hell: The Twisted History of ‘70s and ‘80s Horror Fiction (2017): This book is a bit flawed, but even with its flaws it’s a favorite of 2017. It’s funny and has so many great book covers to enjoy and wonder over. I definitely added quite a few authors and titles to my to-read lists based on Hendrix’s coverage.\n\nEmil Ferris, My Favorite Thing Is Monsters (2017): Aaah, this is so good! I can’t wait for the sequel!\n\nPoetry\n\nDanez Smith, Don’t Call Us Dead: Poems (2017): I apparently didn’t read much poetry this year, at least not whole books of it. Even given that, this is a fantastic collection. I’d read one of Smith’s poems before (Dinosaurs in the Hood) and loved it. The collection extends the concerns of that poem (race, violence, representation) and adds others (e.g., sexuality)."
