        "text": "Division Chair(s): Inder Marwah, McMaster University and Alex Livingston, Cornell University\n\nThe Political Thought and Philosophy: History of Political Thought section welcomes proposals from scholars working in all areas of our field. We are especially interested in proposals that draw on the history of political thought, understood broadly, to reflect on questions of rupture, catastrophe, transformation, dislocation, and change provoked by the COVID-19 pandemic. How might the history of political thought help us understand experiences of global crisis, past and present? What do catastrophic events reveal about the fragility and resilience of political institutions, norms, and practices? What openings might they provide for re-envisioning and reconfiguring political order? How should we think about ordinary politics – voting, campaigning, protesting, etc. – in extraordinary times? What insights do historical encounters with plague, contagion, war, and natural disaster, real or metaphorical, offer for approaching a post-pandemic politics? We welcome papers that extend the category of global crisis to engage topics such as climate change, democratic backsliding, migration, AI and data politics, and so on, as well as those addressing pedagogical and methodological questions raised by teaching and researching during the pandemic. We particularly encourage papers and panels that that shed light on issues of race, class, gender, sexuality and disability. We are committed to promoting intellectual exchange across theoretical and methodological approaches, time periods, texts, traditions, and geographical spaces and invite panel proposals organized around this sort of dialogue. We welcome proposals from scholars at all stages of the profession and also appreciate panel proposals that include scholars from across the ranks.\n\nDivision Chair(s): Geneviève Rousselière, Duke University and Melvin Rodgers, Brown University\n\n“The Foundations of Political Theory Section invites papers, panels, and roundtable proposals from all areas of political theory. Building on this year’s theme “Rethink, Restructure, and Reconnect: Towards a Post-Pandemic Political Science”, we especially encourage submissions that ask if and how the world crisis we face is transforming, or should transform, the work of political theorists.\n\nThe pandemic has exacerbated racial, gender, and economic inequality, showed the weaknesses of social and political institutions in addressing these inequalities, and precipitated already rising political polarization. How should we address these persistent issues in the context of political division? Does “rethinking” political theory imply creating new theories or altering the role of theory in policy making or the formation of public opinion? Do theorists need to consolidate foundations or build theories anew? What role should history play when faced with unprecedented challenges?\n\nThe pandemic further exposed our global interconnectedness and interdependence, our vulnerability to common threats as well as the difficulty of coordinated responses to world crisis. Confinement and social distancing increased isolation, yet also accelerated the development of new technologies that transformed daily life. How can post-pandemic political theories think about the social link that unites individuals within and beyond national borders? What is or ought to be the role of law, institutions, citizens’ action, or technology in reconnecting individuals after the isolation of lockdown? What can or should be the role of political theorists in this work of analysis and reconstruction?\n\nThe Foundations of Political Theory Section is by no means restricted to these questions and we welcome papers and panels on a variety of political issues in political theory and political philosophy broadly understood.\n\nWe are committed to creating a diverse program that reflects multiple theoretical and methodological approaches, textual traditions, elocutionary positions, periods and geopolitical spaces. We look forward to panel proposals including scholars at different stages of their career, and we are especially interested in work by those historically underrepresented in our field. “\n\nDivision Chair(s): Julie Wronski, University of Mississippi\n\nThe Political Psychology Division invites papers, panels, and round table proposals from all areas of political psychology. We are especially – but not exclusively – interested in receiving proposals that build upon the annual conference’s theme: “Rethink, Restructure, and Reconnect: Towards A Post-Pandemic Political Science.” We look forward to receiving proposals that explore how individuals, groups, institutions, and states will rethink, restructure, and reconnect in a post-pandemic politics—questions that political psychologists seem uniquely qualified to address.\n\nOur division embraces diversity in terms of our backgrounds, our areas of expertise, our experiences, and our abilities. Therefore, we welcome proposals that utilize our subfield’s various theoretical perspectives (e.g. information processing, social and political identities, personality traits, etc.) to grapple with questions related to the global pandemic, deepening political polarization, and mass protests for social justice. We also welcome proposals that are diverse in methodological approach (i.e. quantitative, qualitative, or mixed-method approaches). Finally, we strongly encourage the submission of well-organized panel proposals. In particular, we are interested in panels that consider research designs rather than completed work and/or include scholars from different subfields of political science and who are at different career levels. Scholars are also free to submit other proposal formats such as round tables, semi-structured debates, and short courses. Given the interdisciplinary nature of political psychology, we actively seek opportunities to co-sponsor with other divisions as well.\n\nDivision Chair(s): Bobbi Gentry, Bridgewater College and Laura Roost, Newberry College\n\nCOVID impacted, and at times, disrupted political science learning communities in a variety of ways. As faculty re-engage in these new learning conditions, new questions about teaching and learning emerge, such as access, inclusiveness, building communities in classrooms and online, exploring new ways to connect with other teacher scholars. We are particularly interested in papers that are going to help explore the real challenges that students face in this time, and the real challenges as well as the exciting possibilities that faculty, staff, students, and off-campus community members have in re-engaging as a political science learning community in 2022. Political science education helps students learn to analyze politics, and critically engage with politics. As political science educators we are involved in a process that helps students become engaged citizens and community members who are knowledgeable about the political process, who can interact as active members in political community, and may become community leaders themselves. How we model re-engagement for our students at this time, and how we re-engage with our own professional colleagues and community members helps us turn this potential challenge into a possibility. Reflecting the focus of the APSA 2022 meeting theme, the Political Science Education Section makes a special call for papers that think about post-pandemic experiences in political science education. Papers on other topics within political science education are also accepted.\n\nDivision Chair(s): Elizabeth Plantan, Stetson University and Aleksandra Sznajder Lee, University of Richmond\n\nDivision 13 invites submissions that contribute to Communist or post-Communist studies. This year, we are particularly interested in proposals that speak to the conference theme of “Rethink, Restructure, and Reconnect: Towards a Post-Pandemic Political Science” and examine the multifaceted impact of the global pandemic on the politics of Communist and former Communist countries. How has the pandemic affected the relationship between states and societies? How did it influence the stability of various political regimes in these regions? How have civil societies in post-Communist or Communist countries reacted to the shifting political atmosphere during this uncertain and tumultuous period? How have marginalized populations been affected? How has the pandemic impacted the political economies of these countries and their responses to challenges such as climate and demographic change, inequality, and global competition? We also encourage proposals that reflect on the evolving nature of research within our field of study in a post-pandemic world. How might the study of Communist or former Communist countries change in response to shifting access to on-the-ground fieldwork and can remote technologies improve our research, teaching, or outreach related to this region? How can we, as a division, respond to discipline-wide calls to restructure and rebuild in order to create a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive field of study? To enhance diversity and inclusion within our field, we are especially interested in submissions that examine intersectionality, race, ethnicity, gender, accessibility, or LGBTQ politics. In addition, we strongly encourage well-organized panel proposals and other formats such as roundtables and author-meets-critics sessions that bring together scholars diverse in theoretical and methodological approaches, gender, rank, and nationality, including scholars in these regions.\n\nDivision Chair(s): Sumit Ganguly, University of Indiana and Charles Boehmer, University of Texas, El Paso\n\nThe world has witnessed the human and material ravages of a global pandemic, the growth of populist nationalism and increasing demands for social and racial justice in the past year. Of these, the pandemic has truly scarred both the industrialized as well as the developing world. It has laid bare extant social inequities, highlighted the shortcomings of public health care systems and has spawned an interest in some quarters in pseudo-scientific strategies to combat this threat. Some security studies scholars, who have since the 1990s, argued for a more expansive conception of security, whether national or international, have argued that questions of health and human well-being constitute a legitimate focus of inquiry within the sub-field. Those inclined to take this more broad view of the subject, without a doubt, would argue that the horrific consequences of the pandemic yet again have underscored the need for a more eclectic approach to the study of international security. This, indeed, may well be the case. That said it is also equally evident that more conventional issues of international security have hardly receded. From the possibilities of renewed civil war in Afghanistan in the aftermath of the American withdrawal, great power competition in the Indo-Pacific and elsewhere between the United States and an increasingly assertive People’s Republic of China (PRC), the recent flare-up of the Sino-Indian rivalry, Russia’s growing assertiveness in Europe, persistent tensions in the Korean peninsula and the uncertainty surrounding a revived and revised nuclear arms control agreement with Iran, and renewed arms control attention more broadly, all underscore the continuing significance of more traditional international security issues. Given this backdrop the International Security and Arms Control section welcomes submissions of individual paper and poster proposals, as well as roundtables and panel proposals, on a range of international security issues based upon diverse interdisciplinary, epistemological, and methodological approaches.\n\nDivision Chair(s): Jiaqi Liang, University of Illinois, Chicago\n\nOver the past two years, the global pandemic, political polarization, and social justice movements have profoundly shaped our world and society. In many ways, these events and phenomena have elevated the challenges constantly facing public organizations and administrators. The Covid-19 pandemic reveals uneven impacts of a public health crisis on different social groups, particularly in terms of access to public services and distribution of policy benefits. Political polarization intensifies the long-standing debates revolving around administrative accountability and the relationship between bureaucracy and democracy. Social justice movements underscore the ongoing tensions beneath many citizen-state interactions in policy implementation. In this context, for the 2022 annual meeting, the public administration section invites paper and panel proposals focused on (1) rethinking the role of bureaucracy in promoting democratic values and social wellbeing, (2) restructuring political and administrative institutions and approaches to advance governmental performance in a way that better aligns with diverse expectations for bureaucratic accountability, and (3) reconnecting different groups of citizens and stakeholders, in particular those who have been long marginalized, in government’s decision making process. We seek theoretically grounded and methodologically robust proposals that examine a broad range of questions, including but not limited to: How can public bureaucracy strengthen its legitimacy and reputation in a hostile political environment? How do the increasingly contentious intergovernmental relations affect policy implementation outcomes? To what extent does public bureaucracy mitigate or reinforce the effect of policy design across different client groups? How does administrative burden relate to bureaucrats’ preferences and discretion, clients’ policy attitudes and political efficacy, and social equity? How do bureaucratic diversity and representation fully achieve their potential in promoting social equity? How can the public’s trust in government be restored amid crises? We also welcome proposals that engage research from other subfields.\n\nDivision Chair(s): Chris Koski, Reed College\n\nThe Public Policy section serves a large, diverse community of researchers studying policy to address central questions of political science: who governs, and to what ends? The section welcomes proposals on all aspects of the policy process and the causes and consequences of government decisions (and non-decisions). These submissions could involve policy development and change, policy feedback, policy diffusion, agenda setting, historical and comparative perspectives on policy, and more.\n\nProposals addressing this year’s conference theme – “Rethink, Restructure, and Reconnect: Towards A Post-Pandemic Political Science” – are particularly welcome. The American Political Science Association asks conference participants to think about the influences that the pandemic has had on political science as a discipline as well as a more critical look at the role that political science can play in society. The Public Policy section of APSA can offer particular insights regarding linkages between government decisions and the politics they generate. While it is certainly true that leadership selection continues to be consequential to the outcomes of governments, the current and future political landscape has been altered by significant direct and indirect policy responses to the pandemic.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created incredible challenges for governments not just in responding to the substantive policy challenges associated with a pandemic, but also in the heightened politicization of expert-driven policymaking. Public policy scholars are well positioned to draw lessons from massive policy and institutional changes that have resulted from this pandemic. Theories of the policy process may help us understand to what extent policy changes will manifest in permanent institutional change, the impacts of which have far reaching consequences beyond the pandemic.\n\nIn addition to the conference theme, the section welcomes a broad range of proposals addressing substantively, theoretically, and methodologically important questions. How can policy theory help the discipline of political science understand the impact of unprecedented government interventions in the economy, society, and democratic institutions themselves? How has the pandemic and resulting policy changes contributed to changes in policy beliefs among stakeholder groups?\n\nReponses to the pandemic overarch policy decisions worldwide, but the work of government continues in other important areas. How have shifts in the relative power of groups targeted by public policy affected the design of solutions to other issues such as climate change, racial (in)equality, policing, and education during this time? Have broader narratives used to describe these problems and solutions shifted to produce new politics?\n\nInstitutional design is critical to understanding government decision-making and government institutions are changing at a rapid pace as a result of social movements and anti-democratic forces. How will institutional changes affect the efficacy and legitimacy of public policy?\n\nThe Public Policy section is open to all methodological and theoretical perspectives. While paper proposals are welcome, we strongly encourage well-organized panel proposals.\n\nDivision Chair(s): Veronica Herrera, University of California, Los Angeles and Justin De Benedictis-Kessner, Harvard University\n\n“The Urban and Local Politics section welcomes proposals on the politics, policies, and governance of local governments. This year’s conference theme, “Rethink, Restructure, and Reconnect,” prompts scholars to reconsider the ways in which our research can promote equity and social justice as we re-emerge from a year of challenges. Such a call is especially apt for the study of urban and local politics in the US and globally. Emerging from a year that highlighted crises both local and global – COVID-19, racial injustice and police violence, migrant and refugee crises, climate change catastrophes, housing shortages, economic shutdowns, widening polarization – cities and localities are faced with mounting challenges around the world. Local governments are well poised to impact policy change both locally and globally, yet they may lack the resources or support to effectively do so alone. Cities and their residents offer opportunities to inform best practices and test innovations in addressing governing challenges, for example when collaborating with other actors such as NGOs, state or regional governments, or through global partnerships. In addition, citizens most frequently interact with arms of local government—as opposed to national—whether through issues related to policing, ordinances, zoning, housing, public services, or business permitting. Thus, local institutions are a critical site for the study of civic engagement, citizen participation, the impact of social movements on policy change, and the struggle for inclusive citizenship. We welcome proposals that draw on a vast array of institutions and citizen action to influence social and political change within cities.\n\nA year after George Floyd’s murder, cities continue to be important sites for contestation over racial injustice within policing, our justice system, and the myriad institutions with which citizens interact. We invite research on all aspects of the local and urban political experience, including research examining equity issues along intersecting dimensions of race, gender, ethnicity, and class. We especially welcome perspectives and voices that have historically received insufficient attention in political science, as we “rethink” knowledge creation within our discipline. Papers that use qualitative, ethnographic, quantitative, and multi-method approaches are all welcome, as is research that is policy relevant and interdisciplinary.\n\nThe Section will accept proposals for cohesive panels, roundtables, author-meets-critics, or short courses. For those submitting complete panels, roundtables or author-meets-critics proposals, please be sure to submit a chair and at least one discussant for all panel proposals and where possible highlight how the proposed session connects with the theme of rethinking, restructuring, and reconnecting.”\n\nDivision Chair(s): Priscilla Yamin, University of Oregon and Keisha Lindsay, University of Wisconsin-Madison\n\nThe Women, Gender and Politics Research Section invites panel and paper submissions that engage themes of women, sex, gender, sexuality and intersectionality across the fields of comparative politics, international relations, American politics, political theory and research methods. We especially encourage submissions that build on the conference theme of “Rethink, Restructure, and Reconnect: Towards a Post-Pandemic Political Science.” We invite paper or panel proposals that use a feminist perspective to explore, elucidate and re-vision political questions in the shifting landscape of the current and post-pandemic era. Submissions that show how using a feminist analysis leads to reinterpreting political questions, conventional theories and methods in political science are welcome. Themes and topics of proposals could include, but not limited to, social movements, public policies, elections, reproduction, economic inequality, and representation that critically examine the category of gender and how it intersects with race, masculinity, sexuality, ethnicity, national identity, physical and intellectual ability, family status, and carework. We are open to papers and panels that use explore themes across subfields using a gender and race lens and that are interdisciplinary and methodologically innovative, as well as those proposals that foreground transnational feminism, indigenous feminism, black feminism, post-colonial feminism, eco feminism, disability studies, and transgender studies. In keeping with APSA’s goals of increasing diversity, inclusion, and access throughout the profession, we welcome diversity of approach and interdisciplinarity from a wide-ranging collection of researchers. APSA offers many different presentation formats and we welcome a variety proposals that take advantage of those options.\n\nDivision Chair(s): Kassra Oskooii, University of Delaware and Jessica Carew, Elon University\n\nThe APSA Section on Race, Ethnicity, and Politics (REP) invites proposals for the 2022 APSA Annual Meeting. The theme for the upcoming annual meeting is “Rethink, Restructure, and Reconnect: Towards A Post-Pandemic Political Science.” As REP scholars, we frequently center our examinations around understanding the ways in which systems, structures, and institutions influence political behavior, as well as how behavior and opinion can influence political systems. Further, we also frequently push our discipline of political science to consider innovative ways to approaching the study of the sociopolitical world. As scholars, we currently find ourselves in a critical moment in which we have the opportunity to combine these aforementioned realities in order to continue asking and working toward answering important questions: What has the pandemic illuminated about the importance of our work? Are we still asking the right questions, and to what degree do our methods for answering them remain relevant? How might we re-envision our academic approaches to ensure an intersectional and multifaceted understanding of power and hierarchy, both within political systems and within our discipline as a whole?\n\nWe seek proposals that will deepen our understanding of the ways in which race and ethnicity influence political realities throughout the world, as well as in the United States. We encourage proposals in which the research centers upon empowering marginalized and underrepresented peoples and communities. In addition to the traditional quantitative approaches that have characterized some REP work in recent years, we are also interested in qualitative, mixed methods, and theoretical approaches that can inform a post-pandemic dialogue around race, ethnicity and the future of democratic norms and political science. We also invite political theorists, comparativists, and women and politics scholars to submit proposals to the REP section, to encourage dialogue and disciplinary growth in the context of the conference’s theme of “Rethink, Restructure, and Reconnect: Towards A Post-Pandemic Political Science.”\n\nWe encourage both paper submissions and organized panel submissions. Panel submissions must include at least four papers, a discussant and a panel chair. Where appropriate, the program co-chairs may add papers to these panels. Scholars are also welcome to submit roundtable, workshop, and “Author meets Critics” proposals. Given the multidisciplinary nature of race, ethnicity, and politics, we actively seek opportunities to co-sponsor with other divisions as well.\n\nDivision Chair(s): Nathalie Giger, University of Geneva\n\nThe section welcomes proposals on a wide range of topics related to elections and voting behavior, including political participation and electoral choice, electoral polling and forecasting as well as party influence and competition and campaigns, studied from any national or comparative perspective (Note that proposals focused on public opinion and attitude formation should be directed to Division 37). In keeping with APSA’s goals of increasing diversity, inclusion, and access throughout the profession, the section welcomes diversity of approach and interdisciplinarity from a wide-ranging collection of researchers.\n\nProposals addressing the conference’s core theme of “Rethink, Restructure, and Reconnect: Towards A Post-Pandemic Political Science” are encouraged, but we welcome all proposals that are empirically and/or theoretically innovative, and that analyze original data in a rigorous and creative way. For example are we interested in research exploring the viability of elections in a changing context, studying the limitations of democracy’s efficacy and the related challenges of diversity and inequality, or that employ innovative methodological approaches.\n\nScholars are encouraged to provide thorough, concise abstracts to improve the quality and cohesiveness of the panels. In addition to independent paper proposals, the submission of substantively cohesive panel and roundtable proposals that bring together scholars with a variety of backgrounds and perspectives is especially welcome.\n\nDivision Chair(s): Israel Waismel-Manor, University of Haifa\n\n“The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged every aspect of our lives. It affected our health and the health of loved ones, it forced us to keep a distance from colleagues and students, and through it all we had to do our best to continue our research and teaching while tending to the needs of our partners, parents, children and our own wellbeing. Now, as we begin the transition towards a post-pandemic world, we must learn as political communication scholars to rethink, restructure, and reconnect. It is an opportunity to rethink what are the most pressing problems facing the world and the ways through which we can harness our knowledge and expertise to help. For example, how should governments, national health agencies and the media best communicate with the public in a way that foresters trust and compliance with safety regulations? How can we restructure and apply all we learned about electoral disinformation to explore and reduce the spread of fake news and conspiracies about vaccines? Finally, if we are to tackle a global pandemic that is indifferent to national borders, it is only logical that many of the remedies will have to come from cross-national team efforts. We must reconnect with old colleagues and connect with new ones to tackle these challenges together.\n\nWith APSA’s goals of increasing diversity, inclusion and access through profession, the Political Communication section especially welcomes diversity of theoretical and methodological approaches and interdisciplinary work from scholars with a wide range of disciplinary backgrounds. We invite papers, panels, and roundtable submissions that are theoretically developed and empirically detailed and rigorous. Proposals should not exceed one page in length and should clearly state research questions, theoretical structure, methodological approach, and overall implications for the field of political communication.”\n\nDivision Chair(s): Filippo Trevisan, American University\n\nProgram Chair: Filippo Trevisan, American University What will be the pandemic’s legacy on digital politics? The Information Technology & Politics (ITP) section invites paper, panel, and roundtable proposals relating to research on any forms of political activity revolving around, or shaped by, digital media and information technologies, broadly construed. We particularly encourage proposals connecting to the APSA 2022 theme, “Rethink, Restructure, and Reconnect: Towards a Post-Pandemic Political Science.” The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare fundamental issues of (in)equality across different political systems. As we emerge from this crisis, information technologies and their uses will have profound implications for the politics of the future. Here, the stakes are especially high for marginalized and under-represented people. Thus, proposals that examine the role and experiences of groups that are traditionally discriminated against because of their race and ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, economic status, nationality, and their intersections are particularly important. The ITP section welcomes proposals that tackle questions centered around, but by no means limited to, these issues: • What opportunities and/or challenges to “democratize” digital politics have emerged during the pandemic? • How do specific affordances of digital and social media facilitate or counter the circulation of ideas about race, sexuality, gender, disability, nationality, class, culture, and their intersections? • What have political organizations such as campaigns, activist networks, and local and national governments learned from pivoting online and how might that affect their work long term? • What is the role of information technology in spreading or countering misinformation and false information about health and related policy measures, politics, and elections across different political and cultural systems? • How are calls for more regulation and changes in internet governance reshaping digital politics, both nationally and internationally? • How are attitudes toward technology and its uses that emerged during the pandemic – including in relation to digital tracking and surveillance practices – going to affect future politics, both in democratic and authoritarian contexts? • How can we innovate information technology and politics scholarship to make it more inclusive and representative of voices traditionally excluded from research? The ITP section embraces a wide variety of methods and welcomes proposals informed by quantitative, qualitative, and mixed research designs, as well as innovative and interdisciplinary approaches. Ambitious proposals that blend theoretical significance with empirical and methodological detail are particularly encouraged.\n\nDivision Chair(s): Nikol G. Alexander-Floyd, Rutgers University and Lucrecia Garcia-Iommi, Fairfield University\n\nEnglish:\n\nWe are delighted to announce the call for papers for the 118th Annual Meeting of the American Political Science Association to be held in Montreal, Quebec, Canada from September 14-18, 2022. New Political Science invites you to submit composed panels and individual papers exploring how the conference theme, “Rethink, Restructure, and Reconnect: Towards A Post-Pandemic Political Science,” intersects with our mission to make the study of politics relevant to the struggle for a better world. As we contemplate the lessons we have learned from this historic moment and our path forward, we welcome work that speaks to the multiple socio-economic, domestic, and geopolitical challenges that have been highlighted during current the public health and political crises. In the tradition of New Political Science, we are particularly interested in work that embodies theoretical, epistemological, and methodological diversity across subfields from underrepresented perspectives. We understand that a multiplicity of perspectives and approaches will be necessary to grapple with the varied, complex challenges presented in the post-pandemic world. We strive to see this moment represent a post-pandemic “turn,” that is, an aggressive, concerted commitment to political and scholarly organizing rooted in social justice. We remain especially concerned about materialist politics, as well as environmental, gender, and racial justice, among other imperatives. We encourage submissions from individuals of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds, nationalities, gender, sexual orientation, and gender expression, as well as diverse career trajectories. In line with the general call, we strongly suggest that panel and paper submissions reflect how we can “Rethink, Restructure, and Reconnect” moving towards a “Post-Pandemic Political Science.” This process of rethinking, restructuring, and reconnecting will, of course, extend to the operation of political science, how we produce and disseminate knowledge, specifically with an eye toward impacting the future for positive change and equity. While New Political Science welcomes proposals that engage the themes and issues described above, any submission that engages with understanding how the study of politics is relevant to the struggle for a better world will be considered. New Political Science is interested in supporting student work and featuring junior scholars’ research. To apply please review the full submission guidelines as outlined by APSA and make sure to select Section 42.\n\nSpanish:\n\nNos complace anunciar la convocatoria de ponencias para la 118ª Conferencia Anual de la Asociación Estadounidense de Ciencias Políticas (American Political Science Association) que se celebrará en Montreal, Quebec, Canadá, del 14 al 18 de septiembre de 2022. La sección Nueva Ciencia Política (New Political Science) invita a nominar paneles y artículos individuales que exploren la intersección entre el tema de la conferencia, “Repensar, reestructurar y reconectar: ​​hacia una ciencia política pospandémica” y nuestra misión de hacer que el estudio de la política sea relevante en la construcción de un mundo mejor. Considerando las lecciones que hemos aprendido de este momento histórico y reflexionando en nuestro camino a seguir, la sección invita especialmente el envío de propuestas enfocadas en los múltiples desafíos socioeconómicos, domésticos y geopolíticos prevalecientes en la actual crisis política y de salud pública. En la tradición de Nueva Ciencia Política, estamos particularmente interesados ​​en trabajos que encarnan la diversidad teórica, epistemológica y metodológica en las distintas áreas de la disciplina, particularmente aquellos que ofrecen perspectivas subrepresentadas, entendiendo que para afrontar los variados y complejos desafíos que se presentan en el mundo pospandémico será necesaria una multiplicidad de perspectivas y enfoques. Nos esforzamos para que este momento represente un “giro”, específicamente un compromiso concertado y agresivo con iniciativas políticas y académicas basadas en el principio de justicia social. Nueva Ciencia Política continua especialmente interesada en el materialismo político, así como en la justicia ambiental, de género y racial, entre otros imperativos. Alentamos las propuestas de personas de diversos orígenes raciales y étnicos, nacionalidades, género, orientación sexual y expresión de género, así como de diversas trayectorias profesionales. En línea con la convocatoria general, sugerimos que las propuestas de paneles y artículos reflexionen sobre cómo podemos “repensar, reestructurar y reconectar” para avanzar hacia una “ciencia política pospandémica”. Este proceso de repensar, reestructurar y reconectar se extiende al funcionamiento de la ciencia política, al cómo producimos y difundimos conocimiento, específicamente en relación al objetivo de crear un futuro mejor y mas equitativo. Si bien Nueva Ciencia Política promueve el envío de propuestas que involucren los temas y problemas descritos anteriormente, cualquier propuesta comprometida con la comprensión de cómo el estudio de la política es relevante para la creación de un mundo mejor será seriamente considerada. Nueva Ciencia Política también está interesada en apoyar el trabajo de los estudiantes y presentar la investigación de los jóvenes académicos. Para postularse, revise las pautas de presentación completas según lo describe APSA y asegúrese de seleccionar la Sección 42.\n\nDivision Chair(s): Paul Schuler, University of Arizona\n\n“The Democracy & Autocracy section seeks papers, panels, and other session formats focusing on democratization, de-democratization, democracy and autocracy in the modern world. In keeping with the theme of the 2022 APSA Meeting to “Rethink, Restructure, and Reconnect,” we encourage submissions focusing on evergreen issues of importance as well as work exploring important new issues. Some areas of continued interest include but are not limited to the determinants of democratization, democratic backsliding, and authoritarian durability; military-civilian relations; bureaucratic appointments; elections and quasi-democratic institutions; social movements and protests; repression and censorship; ideology; comparative economic and social policy performance in democracies and autocracies; and international democracy and autocracy promotion. Some potentially timely areas of interest include authoritarian and democratic responses to economic or health crises as well as the impact of crises on democratization and de-democratization.\n\nWe encourage proposals at different levels of analysis, including cross-national, regional, subnational, and the individual-level. We also welcome primarily theoretical work, including proposals using formal theory. Finally, we seek to attract a diversity of methodological and theoretical approaches covering any region or country (including the US). We also encourage submissions from scholars from a range of diverse backgrounds, ranks, and academic institutions.\n\nThe section welcomes work defined by either its theoretical insights (e.g., new definitions of key ideas, formal-theoretical work, theories of regime change) or methodological innovations (e.g., in measurement, estimation) and research on any region or country, including the US. The section especially encourages submissions of organized panels and other session formats that include scholars of diverse backgrounds, ranks, academic institutions, and whose work focuses on different world regions.”\n\nDivision Chair(s): Tim Callaghan, Texas A&M School of Public Health and Ashley Fox, University at Albany, SUNY\n\nThe organized section on Health Politics and Policy invites submissions for the APSA 2022 conference. Proposals may be submitted in the form of individual papers, complete panels of up to four papers, roundtables, and author-meets-critics sessions. In line with the theme of the 2022 Annual Meeting— “Rethink, Restructure, and Reconnect: Towards a Post-Pandemic Political Science”—the section welcomes research that uses quantitative or qualitative methods; that focuses on the United States or on other countries; that involves case studies or comparative approaches; that studies a range of populations, time periods, and policy venues; and that comes from both established and emerging scholars. In keeping with the theme statement – which emphasizes understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ‘new normal’ it has created for the field and the world at large, we seek insights from disparate perspectives focused on lessons learned about the intersection of health and politics during the pandemic and how those lessons can be applied to future health politics and policy research. We are particularly interested in connecting with our APSA colleagues, and are eager to receive proposals that lend themselves to be “theme” panels. This call’s focus on working towards a ‘post-pandemic’ political science is a unique opportunity to investigate challenging questions at the intersection of health, politics, policy, and countless other subfields in political science. The Health Politics and Policy section is particularly well poised to contribute to these discussions. Panels addressing the conference theme are welcome, and could include (but are not restricted to) research on the following kinds of questions: 1. What factors help explain the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on low-income communities and communities of color both in the United States and globally? 2. How is attention to long-standing health inequities likely to change due to COVID-19, if at all? Is attention to health inequities in the case of COVID-19 similar to or different from attention to inequities connected to other public health threats, such as climate change? 3. What can we learn about how political systems can effectively respond to future public health crises by studying national or sub-national responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, the opioid crisis, or other previous public health challenges in the United States or globally? 4. When policymakers make plans to address future crises, what factors determine which lessons are “learned” (or not learned), and why? 5. How do approaches to race comparatively (such as French “color-blind” policymaking) or past US debates around the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid or Medicare ease or intensify health and healthcare disparities? 6. How do budgetary pressures in times of crises (nationally or cross-nationally) impact national health systems, elites, and those most in need of help? 7. What are the politics around the development and administration of vaccines and treatments for COVID-19? What factors—such as perceptions of safety, past vaccination debates, and political divisions—have shaped or will shape vaccine uptake, vaccine mandates, and future vaccination efforts? 8. How has the politicization of the COVID-19 pandemic shaped individual health and political behavior, both in the United States and globally? 9. How did public health, health care, or the COVID-19 pandemic influence the 2020 elections in the US and elections globally either in terms of voter participation, electoral outcomes, public opinion, and/or partisanship? What changes, if any, are likely to persist in the future? 10. What are the distributive politics around COVID-19 responses? How have the benefits and burdens of policy responses to COVID-19 been distributed across different “target groups”? (How) has the pandemic reshaped our understanding of care work and “work” in general? The above questions are examples only. The section welcomes proposals that broach a broad range of topics in health politics and health policy, including proposals that do not examine COVID-19.\n\nDivision Chair(s): Marwa Shalaby, University of Wisconsin, Madison and Nadav Shelef, University of Wisconsin, Madison\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic interacted with existing politics in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) in myriad and varied ways, both reinforcing existing disparities and disrupting well-worn processes in the region. It has also created new barriers and exacerbated existing challenges for political scientists studying the region. In the new COVID reality, challenges to field research have affected the knowledge produced as well as scholars’ careers and research agendas. Researchers based in MENA are in a further precarious position, as budget cuts to the already scarce research funds and increased regime scrutiny will have substantial effects on their research output. While the ongoing health crisis will have enduring effects both on politics and society in MENA and on scholarship on the region, it simultaneously provides an opportunity to reimagine how we study the region, the kinds of issues that we address, and the lenses that we apply to them. With this in mind that the Middle East and North Africa Politics section welcomes submissions that engage with the 2022’s main theme of “Towards A Post-Pandemic Political Science.” We seek individual papers and full panel proposals that engage with post-pandemic politics and political science from diverse methodological and theoretical standpoints. We particularly welcome proposals that engage with the myriad ways in which our field has to rethink, reconstruct, and reconnect in the post-pandemic era and address the following questions within the context of the MENA region: What are the most pressing issues facing the MENA region in the post-pandemic era? In what ways have the recent changes to scholars’ research designs impacted their questions and findings? What opportunities does the pandemic and the response to it provide to ask new questions or question old assumptions? What have we learned about the region from the pandemic and the response to it? What are the effects of the pandemic on mass mobilization, social welfare, conflict, and political contestation in the region? How has the pandemic and its aftermath interacted with pre-existing social, political, and economic disparities? In an effort to increase the diversity of our presenters and attendees, we strongly encourage proposals from traditionally underrepresented institutions, MENA-based scholars, and racial minorities. We also welcome proposals that are interdisciplinary, reflect diverse methodological and analytical approaches, or explore comparisons between the MENA and other regions.\n\nDivision Chair(s): Leah Murray, Weber State University and Diana Owen, Georgetown University\n\nThe APSA section on Civic Engagement invites proposals for papers and panels that address the conference theme of embracing pluralism and diversity in the discipline in terms of methods, behavior, institutions, and perspectives. We encourage submissions that: 1) explore methodological pluralism in research on civic education and civic engagement; 2) enhance our understanding of how civic education and engagement is experienced across diverse populations; and 3) fosters conversations about civic education and engagement that bridge disciplinary boundaries. Research in the field has been anchored by established methodologies that are employed routinely, including survey research, interview techniques, ethnographic research, and classroom assessments. The field is ripe for innovative methodological approaches that will lead to fresh findings and insights. In keeping with the conference theme, the section will explore the broad question: How can established and novel research methodologies be considered in concert to deepen our understanding of civic education and engagement? Submissions might examine the benefits and limitations of well-established research methodologies in the field, how these approaches have contributed to our understanding of civic engagement, and how these methods might be employed productively going forward. Studies advancing innovative methodological approaches that have the potential to take the research agenda on civic engagement in new directions are especially welcome. In addition, the section encourages submissions of research on the civic education and engagement of diverse communities, including those based on racial and ethnic background, nationality, gender, sexuality, gender expression, and social class. The section welcomes proposals taking a cross-disciplinary approach, including those that consider the field in cultural, historical, and comparative perspective. Panels will provide the opportunity to share exemplary research and provoke discussion that encourages thinking beyond existing methodological and sub-disciplinary boundaries."
