AJZENBERG-SELOVE, FAY A Matter of Choices: Memoirs of a Female Physicist. Fay AjzenbergÂ—Selove. New Brunswick: Rutgers UP, 1994. 234 pp. $40.00 cloth, $18.00 paper. Reviewed by Edith Dudley Sylla.American Scientist 84.1 (Jan.-Feb. 1995): 77-78. \"Theoretical feminists . . . have argued that modern science is inextricably linked to masculinist ideals, so that being a women scientist may seem almost to be a contradiction in terms. On the other hand, [series editor Ann Hibner Koblitz] says, the lives of actual women scientistsÂ—such as Fay AjzenbergSelove Â—may call into question the basic tenets of some gender and science dieory . This book is therefore of potential interest to everyone concerned about the past, present and future role of women in science. . . . The author shows that quite ordinary people can enjoy lives as scientistsÂ—it is not necessary to be a genius.\" AUDEN3WH. Auden. Richard Davenport-Hines. New York: Pantheon, 1995. 406 pp. $30.00. REVIEWED ELSEWHERE 441 Reviewed by Alfred Corn. NYTBR, Mar. 31, 1996: 9-10. \"Given that none of the other Auden biographies are in print, it's a good thing those interested in him will be able to find this one on bookstore shelves for a while. It's shorter than Mr. Carpenter's and less scholarly, an advantage and disadvantage , depending on what die reader is looking for. Mr. Davenport-Hines's acknowledgments admit relying heavily on the earlier biography, and he duplicates a surprising number of citations from it at parallel points in the story. On the other hand, he has found new material, for example, facts concerning Auden's father and the poet's activities in the late 1920's; and he weaves in citations from previously unavailable correspondence with his friends James and Tania Stern, only just now edited by Nicholas Jenkins and published in the most recent 'Auden Studies.' Finally, what Mr. Davenport-Hines has produced is less a chronological biography tiian a synchronic meditation on the central themes of Auden's life.\" BEAUVOIR, SIMONE DE A Disgraceful Affair: Simone de Beauvoir, Jean-Paul Sartre, & Bianca Lamblin. Bianca Lamblin. Boston: Northeastern UP, 1996. 184 pp. $24.95. Reviewed by Alan Riding. NYTBR, Apr. 14, 1996: 14. \" Î† Disgraceful Affair' is Mrs. Lamblin's painful attempt to purge herself of a specter that continues to haunt her. Smoothly translated by Julie Plovnick, the book has just three chapters: the first about 'the threesome,' the second about the war years and the third about Mrs. Lamblin's postwar contacts with Beauvoir . Mrs. Lamblin insists that she is not out to seek revenge. Still, Sartre and Beauvoir end up looking pretty shoddy.\" BECKETT, SAMUEL The World of Samuel Beckett, 1906-1946. Lois Gordon. New Haven: Yale UP, 1996. 250 pp. $28.50. Reviewed by David Gates. NYTBR, May 26, 1996: 4. \"Lois Gordon's biographical study, 'The World of Samuel Beckett, 1906-1946,' is a portrait of the artist as a young man. Ms. Gordon, a professor of English and comparative literature at Fairleigh Dickenson University, argues that Beckett wasn't the neurotic, cold-hearted, world-renouncing wreck we met in Deidre Bair's influential 1978 biography, a man who barely managed to wrest his work from the grip of his own dysfunction. He may have been 'shy,' Ms. Gordon says, but he was an alert, caring observer of his times. This portrait, however, turns out to be mostly backdrop. Too often her argument amounts to boilerplate summary of political and intellectual history, together with speculation about how Beckett 'must..."
