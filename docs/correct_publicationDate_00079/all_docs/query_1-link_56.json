STATE DEPARTMENT INFORMATION PROGRAM--INFORMATION CENTERS [Editor's note.--The United States Information Service initially established a ``balanced presentation'' policy under which books by controversial authors, including Communists, would be stocked by its overseas libraries to reflect the diversity of opinion in the United States and to preserve the intellectual credibility of the collections. In 1952, the Truman administration judged several books by the novelist Howard Fast to be Communist propaganda and removed them from the shelves although his other works remained. In January 1953, the Eisenhower administration upheld the policy of balanced collections but set criteria for defining books that might be excluded. Between March and July 1953, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations held extensive hearings, in both executive and public session, that focused on the U.S. Information Libraries worldwide. It examined the books that the libraries stocked, and called some of the authors--including Howard Fast--to testify. During the course of the investigation, chief counsel Roy Cohn, and chief consultant David Schine, embarked on a highly-publicized tour of the overseas libraries in major European capitals, from April 4 to 21. Simultaneously, the State Department ordered the removal of any books by Communist authors or Communist sympathizers from the Information Libraries' shelves. Hundreds of works of fiction and non- fiction were discarded, and some were burned. In his commencement address at Dartmouth College on June 13, President Eisenhower told the students: ``Don't join the book burners. Don't think you are going to conceal faults by concealing evidence that they ever existed. Don't be afraid to go in your library and read every book as long as any document does not offend our own ideas of decency. That should be the only censorship.'' Mary M. Kaufman did not testify in public. Sol Auerbach (who wrote as James S. Allen) and William Marx Mandel appeared before the subcommittee in a televised public hearing on the following day. During the open session, the chairman ordered Mandel to identify publicly his current employer, information that the witness had provided in executive session with the request that it be kept confidential. Mandel complained that the subcommittee had ``arrogated itself the right to exact punishment, although it is not a court of law and deprives one of due process of law. That punishment has ranged from fines ranging from several thousand dollars in the case of people dismissed up to the fact that you, Senator McCarthy, murdered Raymond Kaplan by forcing him, driving him to the point where he jumped under a truck. . . .''] ---------- MONDAY, MARCH 23, 1953 U.S. Senate, Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations Committee on Government Operations, Washington, DC. The subcommittee met, pursuant to Senate Resolution 40, agreed to January 30, 1953, at 3:00 p.m. in room 357 of the Senate Office Building, Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, chairman, presiding. Present: Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, Republican, Wisconsin; Senator Henry M. Jackson, Democrat, Washington; Senator Stuart Symington, Democrat, Missouri. Present also: Claude I. Bakewell, former representative from Missouri; Roy Cohn, chief counsel; Ruth Young Watt, chief clerk. Mr. Cohn. Senator, this is William Z. Foster's attorney Mrs. Kaufman. Do you have any objection to being sworn, Mrs. Kaufman? STATEMENT OF MARY M. KAUFMAN, ATTORNEY FOR WILLIAM Z. FOSTER Mrs. Kaufman. I don't see the necessity to be sworn simply to explain why he isn't here. The facts I state are matters of public record. Senator McClellan. I suggest this, Mr. Chairman. If this is to be testimony, I think she should be sworn. If you are willing to accept just a report from her as to why he is not here, I should think that would be acceptable without her being sworn. The Chairman. What are you prepared to present to us? Mrs. Kaufman. I simply wanted to advise the committee that Mr. Foster is presently confined to the southern district of New York under the terms of his bail, and because of that is unable to appear. Now, that is a matter of public record. When I reminded Mr. Cohn of the fact, he remembered that that was so. In addition, I wanted to advise the committee that Mr. Foster's health is such as not to permit him to appear before this committee, and I have a statement from his physician to that effect. The conclusion of the statement states that ``any sudden strain or emotional excitation may provoke easily a fatal cerebral or cardiac incident.'' And under these circumstances, I would request that he be excused. The Chairman. May I ask counsel, number one: I assume the first reason stated could be easily waived by the court. Mr. Cohn. No doubt about it. The Chairman. How about number two, the question of illness? Mr. Cohn. That has been raised by Mr. Foster for some time, I believe, since his original indictment in the summer of 1948. He was granted a severance. There was a reexamination at my request when I was in the Department of Justice a few months ago. I am not aware that that motion was ever decided. Was it? Mrs. Kaufman. I don't believe the government took any action. Mr. Cohn. Well, we did. We made a motion for another physical examination, and I don't know whether there was ever a ruling on whether he was well enough to stand trial. Senator McClellan. The first issue raised determines. You do not have to pass upon the other. Mr. Cohn. Well, we can get that waived. Senator McClellan. I understand, but for the moment that would settle it. The Chairman. He is definitely not in contempt for not appearing today. Well, my thought is that he is not sufficiently important a witness for the hearing that we should go to the trouble of finding out whether he is in proper shape to appear or not. I think the court is going to determine that in connection with his criminal trial. Mr. Cohn. I was going to suggest this: Could we get from Mr. Foster an affidavit answering the questions we want to put to him? The Chairman. I think that might be a good idea. There is no reason why he could not answer questions under oath. Mrs. Kaufman. I don't know. I would have to consult with him in order to find out what he can or can not do. The Chairman. You are a notary public yourself, are you? Mrs. Kaufman. No, I am not. The Chairman. Let us leave it this way, then. Counsel can prepare the interrogatories and submit them to the attorney, with the orders that Mr. Foster answer them, unless counsel can produce anything to indicate that that would adversely affect his health. If no, we will go into that. Senator McClellan. I suggest, Mr. Chairman, that the statement she brought from Mr. Foster and also from his physician be filed. Mrs. Kaufman. Yes, I would like to place that in the record, if I may. Senator McClellan. That does not have to go in the record. The Chairman. Those are merely accepted as exhibits. [A memorandum dated March 21, 1953, signed by Louis V. Finger, M.D., 1056 Fifth Avenue, New York 28, New York, was marked Kaufman Exhibit 1 and filed for the information of the committee.] The Chairman. I want to thank you very much. And counsel will prepare interrogatories to be submitted to Mr. Foster, to be sent to you, and we will want you to have him answer those and have him swear to them before a notary, unless you can produce a doctor's certificate offering something that will prove that that will adversely affect his health. We do not want to kill off any of the witnesses. Mrs. Kaufman. I am sure of that, Senator. The Chairman. I want to thank you very much. Mrs. Kaufman. I am not in any position to state Mr. Foster's agreement as to the interrogatories, but nevertheless we can wait until we receive them to determine what action we will take. The Chairman. It will be the order, as I say, that unless you can produce some medical proof, either a doctor's affidavit or whatever occurs to you to convince the committee that that will adversely affect his health, the answers to the interrogatories will be provided. Senator Symington. I would suggest that you suggest to Mr. Foster that he try and answer the interrogatories to the best of his ability. Mrs. Kaufman. Will you note my address? I don't think you took it. It is 43 West 94th Street. The Chairman. Mr. Allen, will you stand and raise your right hand? Will you stand, sir? In this matter now in hearing, do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Mr. Auerbach. I do. The Chairman. Will you identify your counsel? TESTIMONY OF SOL AUERBACH (JAMES S. ALLEN) (ACCOMPANIED BY HIS COUNSEL, JOSEPH FORER) Mr. Auerbach. My counsel is Mr. Joe Forer of Washington. Mr. Cohn. Is that F-o-r-e-r? Mr. Auerbach. F-o-r-e-r. The Chairman. Mr. Allen, under the rules of the subcommittee, you are entitled to have a conference with your lawyer at any time you care to. If something comes up which you think is of such a nature that you want to have a place to discuss the matter with him confidentially, we will arrange either another room or some place where you can get some privacy. We do not allow the attorney to take part in the proceedings, other than to advise you. If the attorney thinks that a question is objectionable, he is free to tell you that, and fully advise you at any time during the proceedings. Mr. Cohn. Give us your full name, please, Mr. Allen. Mr. Auerbach. My name is Sol Auerbach, A-u-e-r-b-a-c-h. Mr. Cohn. And you write under the name of James S. Allen; is that right? Mr. Auerbach. That is right. Mr. Cohn. What is your address? Mr. Auerbach. 134 East Hudson Street, Long Beach, New York. Mr. Cohn. What do you want to be called, Mr. Auerbach or Mr. Allen? Mr. Auerbach. Either way. Mr. Cohn. Where are you employed? Mr. Auerbach. I refuse to answer that, on the basis of my constitutional privilege. Senator Symington. You refuse to answer where you are employed on that basis? Mr. Auerbach. Yes, sir. Mr. Cohn. You are employed, are you not, Mr. Allen, at International Publishers, the official publishing house of the Communist party? Mr. Auerbach. I refuse to answer that question on the same ground. The Chairman. You refuse to answer on the grounds that your answer might incriminate you? Mr. Auerbach. That is the reason, as it may be put. I prefer to say---- Senator McClellan. How do you put it? Mr. Auerbach. I would say that I have a constitutional privilege under the Fifth Amendment not to bear witness against myself and not to be a witness against myself. The Chairman. You have that privilege, as long as you honestly believe that if you truthfully answered a question it might tend to incriminate you. You do not have that privilege if you would incriminate yourself by perjury, you understand. It is only if you tell the committee that you honestly feel that a truthful answer might tend to incriminate you. Then you have the right to refuse to answer. You understand that? Mr. Auerbach. I think I understand that. Mr. Cohn. Now, Mr. Allen, let me ask you this: Where was the subpoena served on you? Just the street address? Mr. Auerbach. At Fourth Avenue. Mr. Cohn. 381 Fourth Avenue? Mr. Auerbach. That is right. Mr. Cohn. Is that the headquarters of the Communist party of the United States? Mr. Auerbach. It is not the headquarters of the Communist party of the United States. Mr. Cohn. I didn't get that. Mr. Auerbach. It is not the headquarters of the Communist party of the United States. Mr. Cohn. I see. Is that the building in which are located offices or organizations officially connected with the Communist party of the United States? Mr. Auerbach. I think I will refuse to answer that question on the same grounds previously stated. Mr. Cohn. Where are the headquarters of the Communist party located? Mr. Auerbach. I really don't know. Mr. Cohn. They moved recently, did they not? You might have read that in the public press if you do not know it some other way. Mr. Auerbach. That is more or less public knowledge, I think. Mr. Cohn. Mr. Allen, let me ask you this: Has the Communist party gone underground recently? Is the location of the present headquarters of the Communist party secret, as far as you know? Mr. Auerbach. As far as I know, it is no secret. Mr. Cohn. And you say you can't tell us where it is? Mr. Auerbach. I just don't happen to know where it is. Mr. Cohn. Have you visited the Communist party headquarters recently? Mr. Auerbach. I have not. Mr. Cohn. Did you ever visit Communist party headquarters? Mr. Auerbach. I will refrain from answering that, on the same ground as previously stated. Mr. Cohn. Are you the author of a book called World Monopoly and Peace? \\1\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ James S. Allen, World Monopoly and Peace (New York: International Publishers, 1946). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mr. Auerbach. I am. Mr. Cohn. And you are the James S. Allen who wrote that book? Mr. Auerbach. Yes, that is a copy of the book. Mr. Cohn. You say it is a copy. Mr. Auerbach. It is. Mr. Cohn. Now, I notice that that book is published by International Publishers. Is that the official publishing house of the Communist party? Mr. Auerbach. I refuse to answer that question on the same grounds. Mr. Cohn. When you wrote that book, Mr. Allen, were you a member of the Communist party? Mr. Auerbach. I refuse to answer that question, on the same grounds as previously stated. Mr. Cohn. When did you write that book? Mr. Auerbach. I wrote that book in '45, I believe, 1945. Mr. Cohn. At the time you wrote that book, did you favor the Soviet Union against the United States of America? Mr. Auerbach. I have always favored the United States of America. Mr. Cohn. If the United States of America were at war with the Soviet Union, would you fight for the United States against the Soviet Union? Mr. Auerbach. If we were the victim of aggression, I would. Mr. Cohn. I didn't ask you the circumstances. I said: If the United States declared a state of war against the Soviet Union, would you, as an American citizen, fight against the Soviet Union? Mr. Auerbach. I would say that would depend on the circumstances of the war. Mr. Cohn. I am not asking about the circumstances of the war. I asked for a categorical answer. If the Congress of the United States declared war against the Soviet Union---- Senator Jackson [continuing]. As provided for by the Constitution. Mr. Cohn [continuing]. Would you fight for the United States? Mr. Auerbach. I have been in the American army and fought in a war. Mr. Cohn. You didn't understand my question. If the Congress of the United States declared war against the Soviet Union, would you fight for the United States? ``Yes'' or ``no''? Mr. Auerbach. I cannot conceive of such a war. Senator Symington. Mr. Chairman, I think the witness is getting very close to contempt of the committee. Mr. Auerbach. May I consult with my attorney? [Mr. Auerbach confers with Mr. Forer.] Mr. Auerbach. Well, I think I have answered the question. The Chairman. I do not think you have answered. Mr. Auerbach. May I repeat my answer? Mr. Cohn. Why don't I repeat the question? It will make it simpler. The question is this: If the Congress of the United States, for any reason, as provided by the Constitution, were to declare war against the Soviet Union, would you fight against the Soviet Union? Mr. Auerbach. Well, I answered that. Mr. Cohn. Can we have a ``yes'' or ``no'' answer? That is a very simple question. Mr. Auerbach. I can't answer yes or no, because it would depend on the circumstances of the war. There is not every war that one would support. Mr. Cohn. You mean as an American citizen you can conceive of a war declared by the official representatives of the Congress of the United States pursuant to the Constitution which you would not support? Mr. Auerbach. Which I may think to be an unjust war, not worthy of the support of a patriotic American. And I think I would have the privilege to be opposed to that war. The Chairman. Are there some circumstances under which you would join the military forces and fight against the Soviet Union if war were declared? Mr. Auerbach. I think if we were the victim of aggression by the Soviet Union or any other power, I would fight for the defense of the United States. Senator Symington. If the war, in your opinion, were unjustified on the part of the United States, would you accept money to be a spy for a foreign country that was fighting against the United States? Mr. Auerbach. I would not. Senator Symington. Would you be a spy, without money? Mr. Auerbach. I would not. Mr. Cohn. Have you ever engaged in espionage against the United States? Mr. Auerbach. I certainly have not. Mr. Cohn. Have you ever been a representative of the Communist International? Mr. Auerbach. I must refuse to answer that question on the same grounds as previously stated. Mr. Cohn. Did you go to the Philippines for the Communist International in 1939? Mr. Auerbach. I must refuse to answer the question, on the same grounds. Mr. Cohn. Did you take a trip to the Philippines in 1939? Mr. Auerbach. I refuse to answer, on the same grounds. Mr. Cohn. Did you take a trip financed by the Communist party? Mr. Auerbach. I must refuse to answer, on the same grounds. Mr. Cohn. Did you take a trip to Mexico in the interest of the Communist International? Mr. Auerbach. My answer is the same. Mr. Cohn. Was that trip financed by the Communist party? Mr. Auerbach. My answer remains the same. Mr. Cohn. Were you foreign editor of the Daily Worker? Mr. Auerbach. I can't answer that question, on the same grounds. Mr. Cohn. Are you at this time a member of the Communist party? Mr. Auerbach. I do not answer that question, on the same ground as previously stated. Senator Symington. If you are a member of the Communist party, why are you ashamed or afraid to say so? Mr. Auerbach. Because the purpose of the question is quite different. I am not saying that I am or am not a member. I am not saying I am or am not a member of the Communist party. Senator Jackson. Are you saying you never were a member of the Communist party? Mr. Auerbach. I am refusing to answer that question, on the ground---- Senator Symington. My point is that all we are trying to do is clarify who is for or against the United States. It would have been possible for you to be a member of the Communist party and then to have felt that was wrong and to have resigned. What the counsel asked was: Are you a member now? And you have refused to answer, which, of course makes us believe that you are a member of the Communist party. Mr. Auerbach. You have no ground for believing that, on the basis of my answer. Senator Symington. Then why are you afraid or ashamed to answer the question? Mr. Auerbach. I am not afraid or ashamed. Senator Symington. Then why do you not answer it? Mr. Auerbach. I think it violates my constitutional right under the Fifth Amendment. Senator Symington. Why do you want to take refuge behind your constitutional rights unless you are ashamed or afraid of admitting membership? Mr. Auerbach. Because the purpose of these questions is something quite different. Senator Jackson. What purpose could this committee have but to properly obtain information with reference to your activities? You are not incriminating yourself if you say you are a member of the Communist party. There is nothing that I know of on the statute books that says that a member of the Communist party, per se, is in violation of the law. It is only if you conspire, together with others, to overthrow the government by force and violence. You could be a member of the Communist party, if I understand the laws of this country correctly, and testify here under oath and say you are a member, but that you do not agree to overthrow of the government by force and violence, and you would not incriminate yourself. The Chairman. I may say, Senator Jackson, that as I understand the law, merely being a member of the Communist party does not make you guilty of a crime unless it can be shown that you are aware of the objectives of the Communist party. Senator Jackson. And that you acquiesce in those objectives. Mr. Cohn. I don't think it is acquiescence; it is knowledge. Senator Jackson. Well, you would have to know about them. The Chairman. And remaining a member after you know the objectives. So that he does have the right, I think, without any doubt. Senator Jackson. I agree that he has the right. Senator Symington. I agree that he has the right, but I do not see why, if he is a member of the Communist party, he is ashamed or afraid of admitting it. Senator Jackson. Shall we get an answer to the original question, about bearing arms? Mr. Cohn. We never have had a categorical answer to that. The Chairman. I think maybe he has answered that. He says he would himself decide what terms and conditions under which he would serve in the military forces, and while we may disagree with the answer, I think he has perhaps answered it. He says he can't answer it ``yes'' or ``no.'' Senator McClellan. May I ask a question? Do you believe in the overthrow of the United States government by force and violence? Mr. Auerbach. I do not. Senator McClellan. Do you belong to any organization, political or otherwise, that advocates the overthrow of the government of the United States by force and violence? Mr. Auerbach. I do not. In my opinion, I do not belong to any such organization. Senator McClellan. In your opinion, you do not. Is that what you said? Mr. Auerbach. Yes. Senator McClellan. I am trying to understand it. Do you know that the Communist party does favor the overthrow of the United States government by violence? Mr. Auerbach. There seems to be quite a lot of difference on that question, sir. Senator McClellan. Do you know that it does? Mr. Auerbach. No. In my opinion they do not. Senator Jackson. You are familiar with the Supreme Court decision? Mr. Auerbach. I am. Senator Jackson. The last one, the Dennis case, in which the court so found? Mr. Auerbach. Nevertheless, there is a great deal of public opinion that does not agree with that, sir. Senator McClellan. Is it your opinion that the Communist party does not advocate the overthrow of the government of the United States by force and violence? Mr. Auerbach. That is my opinion, sir. Senator McClellan. You state that under oath? Mr. Auerbach. I state that under oath. Senator McClellan. On the contrary, do you not know, when I ask you to state that under oath, that it does advocate the overthrow of the United States government by force and violence? Do you not know it? Mr. Auerbach. I think I answered your question, Senator. Senator McClellan. I do not think you did. Mr. Auerbach. I gave you my opinion. Senator McClellan. You gave me your opinion. I ask you now if you do not know it. Not an opinion, but do you not know it? Mr. Auerbach. I believe that they do not stand for violent overthrow of the government by force and violence. Senator McClellan. Then you mean to state by that answer that you do not know it? Mr. Auerbach. That is not what I said, sir. Senator McClellan. Well, do you say you do know it, or do not know it? Mr. Auerbach. According to my knowledge, they do not stand for the violent overthrow of the government. Senator McClellan. Then, according to your knowledge, they do not. Then you mean you do not know it. Is that what you are saying? I know it has got you a little worried, but I am asking you: Do you know it? Mr. Auerbach. I am not worried, Senator. I am trying to understand your question. Senator McClellan. You do understand it. I asked you: Do you not know it? And you said you ``believe.'' I am asking you, contrary to what you say you believe, if you do not know it as a matter of fact that you have personal knowledge of. [Mr. Auerbach confers with Mr. Forer.] Mr. Auerbach. I do not know it. Senator McClellan. All right. You say you do not know it. Mr. Auerbach. I do not. Senator Jackson. And do you know whether in the past the Communist party has advocated the overthrow of the government by force and violence? Mr. Auerbach. I do not believe it has. Senator Jackson. That is your opinion? Mr. Auerbach. That is my opinion. Senator Jackson. And that is what you believe? Mr. Auerbach. That is what I believe. Senator Symington. Mr. Allen, I am interested in this. Do you believe that the Communist party is run from Moscow? Mr. Auerbach. My belief is that it is not run from Moscow. Senator Symington. Do you believe the Communist party in this country runs itself? Or is it run from Moscow? Mr. Auerbach. I believe it runs itself. Senator Symington. It runs itself, without any control from Moscow? Mr. Auerbach. I believe there is no control from Moscow. Senator Symington. Do you believe in the anti-Semitic purges that have recently developed in the countries behind the Iron Curtain? Do you approve of that? Mr. Auerbach. I don't believe there are anti-Semitic purges. Senator Symington. You do not believe there are anti- Semitic purges? Mr. Auerbach. No. Senator Symington. You think that is just propaganda on the part of the capitalistic press? Mr. Auerbach. I think that it is misinformation about the situation, combined with propaganda, which is quite appropriate to the cold war from the viewpoint of those who would like to wage that war. Senator Symington. So if I follow you, you believe that these reports about anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union and its satellites are incorrect. Is that right? Mr. Auerbach. I believe they are absolutely incorrect. Senator McCllelan. You said, now, that you do not believe that the Communist party in the United States is run by Moscow or controlled from Russia. Now I want to ask you the question. Do you not know that it is? Mr. Auerbach. I do not know. Senator Jackson. In your opinion, is the Communist party in the United States under any orders from outside the United States? Mr. Auerbach. In my opinion, it is under no orders. Senator Jackson. Has it been in the past? Mr. Auerbach. I do not believe it has. Senator Jackson. Has Jacques Duclos ever had any influence on operations of the Communist party of the United States. Mr. Auerbach. As far as I know, he has had no direct influence over it. I would like to make it clear that I am no authority on the question. Senator Jackson. Was Browder removed by totally an American action, or was he removed by reason of action taken by the Cominform in 1945? Can you answer the question? Mr. Auerbach. I think that action was taken here. Senator Jackson. Did the Cominform or other similar apparatus of the International Communist Organization have anything to do with action taken here? Mr. Auerbach. Mr. Chairman, may I make a comment at this point? The Chairman. Certainly. Mr. Auerbach. I am not clear what this committee is after. I know that this is a subcommittee for the investigation of government operations, and I assumed that when I received the subpoena it was in connection with such investigations. The Chairman. You are entitled to inquire the purpose of the question. I will inform you of the purpose. We are presently investigating the background of some of the individuals who have been doing work for the Voice of America information program. We find that your works have been used. We appropriate, oh, a huge amount of money. I think the budget this year calls for $100-million some-odd to fight communism throughout the world. So we are curious to know what Communist authors or members of the Communist party are being utilized in this fight, and the purpose of their being used. We must inquire into your background therefor. Senator Jackson. We want to inquire into the operation of the Communist party, your knowledge of it, here and abroad as it affects the program. The Chairman. That is correct. Senator Jackson. Now, did you answer the question I put to you a moment ago? Mr. Auerbach. Well, I would like to make it clear that my answer to any of these questions is merely the opinion of an individual, and that for expert knowledge on the matter you would have to seek somewhere else. Senator Jackson. I understand you to say under oath that you have no knowledge of the workings of the Communist party? Mr. Auerbach. I did not say that. Senator Jackson. Well, can you answer that question? Mr. Auerbach. I claim my privilege under the Fifth Amendment. Senator Symington. Will you yield a minute there? Senator Jackson. Yes. Senator Symington. You appear questioning, or irritated or resentful, at the questions that are asked you, and you want to make a statement. I feel irritated, questioning, and resentful to any American citizen who is asked up here questions with respect to the Communist party and either is ashamed or so afraid or so arrogant with respect to the right of the Congress that he does not answer those questions, does not want to answer them, on the grounds that it might violate his rights under the Fifth Amendment. I want to make very clear to you my position with respect to your testimony. And I do not think anybody is more anxious to have civil rights and civil liberties perpetuated under our system. Mr. Auerbach. Senator, may I comment on what you say? Senator Symington. You certainly can. Mr. Auerbach. I am not disrespectful of the Congress of the United States. I have no feeling of arrogance, in my attitude. In my opinion it seems quite clear that anticommunism has served as a cover for a struggle against and a suppression of civil liberties. That is my position. And therefore I don't want in any way to further such aims. Anticommunism has historically served that purpose abroad. It served it in Germany. It served it in Italy. It served it in Japan. And it is serving it here. Senator Jackson. And communism in Russia serves to promote civil liberties? Mr. Auerbach. I think they have aims of their own that are quite apart from the aims of---- The Chairman. The question was: Do you think that the Communists are promoting the cause of civil liberties? Mr. Auerbach. I think they are. I think there are liberties in the Soviet Union which we don't enjoy here. Senator Jackson. Can you say what right--I am not talking now about what may be in some document--what right a citizen has in the Soviet Union to a trial by jury? Mr. Auerbach. He has quite a number of rights of trial that would be surprising to many Americans. There are courts, from the lowest branches of the judiciary to the very highest where a citizen has an opportunity to be heard by a jury of his peers and by judges chosen by himself. The Chairman. Do you think the judicial system in Communist Russia is superior to the judicial system in this country? Mr. Auerbach. I don't think it is a question of superior or not. A judicial system meets certain needs. The Chairman. The question originally asked of you, Mr. Allen, was whether you felt that communism was serving the cause of promoting civil liberties, and then you went into the judicial system. My question now is: Do you think the judicial system in Russia is superior to that of this country in so far as the preservation of civil liberties is concerned? Mr. Auerbach. I think that they are very much concerned with the preservation of civil liberties in their judicial system as well as under the Constitution. Senator Jackson. Hitler made some announcements, too, that they were concerned about them, but they did not have them. The Chairman. Would you fight, if you were called upon to fight, today, in the Korean War, on our side, if a draft board called you up? Mr. Auerbach. I am opposed to that war. I think it is an unjust war. Senator McClellan. On whose part is it unjust? On America's part? Or on that of Red China? Mr. Auerbach. Well, I believe that we had no business over there. Senator McClellan. Do you think that Red China has any business in there? Mr. Auerbach. I believe we were there before Red China was there. Senator McClellan. That is right. What is your position as to Red China? Do you think she is fighting an unjust war? Mr. Auerbach. I think Red China is probably concerned with her security. If we had a foreign power down in Mexico or in Cuba, we would be very much concerned about it. Senator McClellan. Is there any position you can take that would at all criticize or condemn communism in the Soviet Union? Is there one single criticism you have of it? Can you think of one? Mr. Auerbach. There might be various criticisms of something. Senator McClellan. There might be, and if you can think of them, I would like to have you put it on the record right now. Mr. Auerbach. You would very much like to see that, Senator. Senator McClellan. Yes, I would like to see it, if you have any criticism at all; if you are a good American, as you say, and have any criticism of it, I would like you to place it on the record. Mr. Auerbach. But my concern is this country, not the Soviet Union. I am an American citizen, born in the United States and interested in this country. Senator McClellan. That is your words. But I might say to you your actions do not conform to your words. Mr. Auerbach. You are entitled to your opinion, and I am entitled to mine. The Chairman. I am going to order the witness to answer the question. Mr. Allen, you were asked whether you could think of any criticism of communism. Your works were being used, you see, by the information program to fight communism. So if you have any criticism of communism, Mr. McClellan wants to know what that criticism is. You are ordered to answer that question. If you have no criticism, you can tell us. Mr. Auerbach. You say to be used by the information program? The Chairman. You understand our government is paying for your works. Mr. Auerbach. I didn't know that. The Chairman. Well, let me tell you they are. They are distributing your books for the purpose of fighting communism. Now, in view of the fact that your works are being used to fight communism, I think Senator McClellan's question is very pertinent. His question is: Can you think of any criticism which you have of communism? If so, tell us what it is. Mr. Auerbach. Well, I believe any criticism that I might have of communism as a system of society would pertain to the speed of its development and how effectively it meets the requirements of a socialist and a Communist society. That is, in other words, that it wouldn't fall within the framework of the questioning, the line of questioning, that is being developed here. The Chairman. In other words, you have no criticism of the objectives of communism. You merely might criticize the speed with which they are arriving at the objectives? Mr. Auerbach. I am all for the objectives of socialism and communism, and I believe that is the form of society that we will come to, too. Senator McClellan. So you are an advocate of communism and you say this country is ultimately coming to communism. Is that correct? Is that not what you just said? Mr. Auerbach. That is my opinion as a student of history, that we will develop along that line. Senator McClellan. That is what I want. That is your opinion. You favor the Communist objectives, and you believe they are coming to America. Is that your statement? Mr. Auerbach. I believe that when the majority of the American people want it, they will get it, and nothing will stop them. Senator McClellan. That is not the question. The question was this: As I understood you, your answer was that you believe in the objectives of communism. Did you say that, or not? Mr. Auerbach. I believe that the objectives of Communist society are just and proper for the world as a whole, and we will eventually obtain them. The Chairman. Then you would feel that one of your functions, as a loyal American, would be to promote the cause of communism? Mr. Auerbach. I don't believe that that is a problem we face at the moment, and I don't believe that it is a realistic objective to hold forth at the moment. If a time should arise that socialism, as a first stage of communism, should become the order of the day, then it will be up to the American people to decide that. The Chairman. You apparently do not understand my question, or maybe you prefer not to answer it. You have told us that you favor the objectives of the Communist movement, and you think it is essentially just, et cetera. My question is then, this: Do you then feel, as a loyal American, that one of your tasks is to further the cause of communism, so that we may ultimately have a Communist society in the United States? Mr. Auerbach. I think it is my duty as a loyal American to support what I believe is best for the people. And at the present moment, what is best for the people is that we have peace, that we protect our democratic rights. Those are the immediate objectives that stare us in the face right now. The Chairman. You understand, Mr. Allen, I am not trying to tell you what you should advocate. I am not trying to tell you that communism as you view it is right or wrong, that is, for the purposes of this examination I am not. You are entitled to think whatever you care to think. You are entitled to work for a socialistic state in this country, if you work for it without an attempt to overthrow this government by force and violence. I am merely trying to find out what you do advocate, you see. Now, do I understand that your feeling is that the Communist state is superior to our capitalistic form of government? Mr. Auerbach. If I may, I would like to answer you as a student of history and not as a political worker or as one who is directing his answer to what is politically feasible at this particular moment. As a student of history, it seems to me that all of society will develop in that direction. Whatever form it might take in this country, I don't know. I don't think anybody could tell you what form it would take. The Chairman. I am going to insist that you answer that question. Mr. Auerbach. That is my answer, sir. The Chairman. Will you read the question, Mr. Reporter? [The reporter read the pending question.] Mr. Auerbach. Yes. As I have explained, I think that a Communist state would be superior to a capitalist state. The Chairman. Let me ask you this. Do you feel that communism as practiced in Russia today is superior to our form of government? Mr. Auerbach. I would say that communism as practiced in Russia today is superior to any previous form of government. Now, it may be that communism as it will be practiced here some time in the future may be superior to that. Senator Jackson. He has not answered the question. The Chairman. I will insist that you answer the question. Mr. Auerbach. As a form of society, I think it is superior--I am answering your question directly, Senator--I think it is superior, because of the fact that exploitation is no longer there, that the society is not run for profit, and that it does open the way to a form of society where everyone can give according to his ability and receive according to his need. Senator McClellan. Do you associate with that view an expression on slave labor camps in Russia? Mr. Auerbach. I believe that is the part of the cold war propaganda Senator Jackson. You do not believe it exists? Mr. Auerbach. I believe that they have penal camps, and that they have a form of prison reform which might include labor camps. Senator Jackson. Do you think the slave labor camps in the Soviet Union are examples relating to penal reform? Mr. Auerbach. From what I know, it seems to me that they are work camps where they attempt to rehabilitate prisoners, and so on. Senator Jackson. It is to rehabilitate them, to build them up, that these slave labor camps are maintained? Mr. Auerbach. According to my information on the subject. The Chairman. Were you acquainted with Reed Harris? Mr. Auerbach. I don't know the name at all. The Chairman. Pardon? Mr. Auerbach. Reed Harris? No. I don't know the name, sir. The Chairman. Have you read the newspapers lately about Mr. Reed Harris, who was connected with the information program? Mr. Auerbach. No. The Chairman. That name does not strike a bell? Mr. Auerbach. It doesn't strike any chord, no. The Chairman. Do you recall that you ever addressed a meeting at which Reed Harris was one of the speakers, and Mr. Donald Henderson was the other speaker? Mr. Auerbach. I don't recall any such meeting. Mr. Cohn. November 25,1932, involving a Professor Leo Gallagher, who had been expelled from the faculty of the University of California. Mr. Auerbach. I don't recall any such meeting. The Chairman. Does that name ``Gallagher'' refresh your recollection? Mr. Auerbach. It does not. Mr. Cohn. Do you know Donald Henderson? Mr. Auerbach. I will refuse to answer that, on the ground of---- Mr. Cohn. Do you know a man named Oakley Johnson? Mr. Auerbach. The same answer there. Mr. Cohn. Do you deny that you, Henderson, Johnson, and Reed Harris addressed this meeting? Mr. Auerbach. I don't deny it. I just don't recall such a meeting. Senator Symington. Recently a man died, Stalin. Do you think he was a great man? Mr. Auerbach. I certainly do. I think he was a great man. Senator Symington. Once he was supposed to have been asked how many people he had to kill in order to effect the Kulak revolution in Russia. And he answered, presumably: ``Ten million in four years. It was awful.'' Do you think there was anything in that question and answer? Mr. Auerbach. I don't know what authority you are quoting, Senator. It sounds to me like the kind of question and answer that someone would use who had some other purpose in mind. Senator Symington. Well, it was in Time magazine, and I read it, and I just wondered what you thought of it. You do think, in order to have a society like there is in Russia today, it is proper to starve or kill people to any great extent to get it? Do you think it is worth that much? Would you be in favor of the purges that have gone on in Russia in order to get what is in Russia? Mr. Auerbach. Well, you are asking me something that is very difficult to answer. Senator Symington. I see that. Mr. Auerbach. It is very difficult. Senator Symington. But my impression was that you felt that in Russia today they had a better system than we have here. Do you think that the means that they went to to get that system, which involved the destruction of a great deal of property and a great many lives, was proper, under the man that you say you think was a very great man? Mr. Auerbach. I think that a great deal of that has been exaggerated. But undoubtedly there was a great deal of violence connected with the revolution in Russia, as there is in any revolution. Senator Symington. And since the revolution? Would you say since the revolution? Mr. Auerbach. And undoubtedly there was some since the revolution, although I think that a great deal of that is exaggerated and used for propaganda purposes. Senator Jackson. In other words, if there is anything that is really adverse that comes out in the paper about the Soviet Union, you think for the most part that is pretty much propaganda? Mr. Auerbach. Well, I wouldn't put it that way at all. I think that a great deal of it is propaganda, and a great deal of it is a part of the so called psychological war of nerves. Senator Symington. Would you be willing to undertake a reasonable amount of purging in this country in order to get our system up to the standard of the Soviet Union? Mr. Auerbach. I would not be willing to undertake anything of the kind. Senator Symington. So that you think it could be right over there and wrong over here; is that it? Mr. Auerbach. Well, I believe this country has a different future ahead of it, and that its development will take place on a basis of what is here, not what took place in the Soviet Union or anywhere else. Senator Jackson. You have stated, Mr. Allen, that when a majority of the people of the United States desire the Communist form of government, they will have it. Are you suggesting to the committee that that is the way communism comes into being in a given country? Mr. Auerbach. What I am suggesting is that I believe that communism--By the way, in order to have our terms straight, when I speak of communism, strictly speaking, that is not the form of society they have in the Soviet Union. Senator Jackson. I know. I will come to that in a minute. Mr. Auerbach. What they have there is a form of socialism. And when that was established, in 1917, as you know, it was the result of a revolution, and a rather violent revolution. Not that it was the will of the Russian Communists that it should take place that way. As you know, there were others that were interested in preventing that revolution. Senator Jackson. Can you name a country where a majority of the people have voted for communism, have voted it in? Mr. Auerbach. I believe that the majority of the people in old Russia wanted it, or they wouldn't have had it. It would have been impossible for them to obtain power. Senator Jackson. Can you name a country where the majority of the people voted in communism? You testified here earlier that when a majority of the American people wanted communism they would have it, and you have also testified that you are opposed to using force and violence to achieve that objective. Mr. Auerbach. That all depends on what you mean by ``voted in.'' Well, the actual process may not have been through the ballot; that is, a voting in. Senator Jackson. Well, how is it going to come into being? Mr. Auerbach. That depends on what the circumstances in the country are. I certainly am no soothsayer and don't know how things are going to happen here. Senator Jackson. Let us see if I can get your position straight, because I think this is important. Do you believe that the Communist society, as distinguished from the Soviet Union--You are talking about the communist society as an ideal objective. I assume that is it. Mr. Auerbach. The next stage of social development, yes. Senator Jackson. Do you say that that should come into existence in a given country through the normal democratic process? Or should it come into being through the use of force and violence? Mr. Auerbach. Well, I would say that it can come into being through the normal democratic process. I don't see any reason why it can't. Senator Jackson. Has it ever so come into being in any country? Mr. Auerbach. Unless there is such opposition to it---- Senator Jackson. Has it ever come into being in a country without force or violence? Mr. Auerbach. That all depends. Now, China, of course, is not a socialist country. Senator Jackson. What is it? Mr. Auerbach. It is what is known as a people's democracy, and it is on the way to socialism. Senator Jackson. It is a people's democracy. Well, I would like for you, if you can, for the benefit of this committee, to give us one country where communism has come in by the means that you apparently advocate, namely, peaceful means. Mr. Auerbach. Well, the Soviets took power largely by peaceful means. Senator Jackson. You are a student of history. That is why I ask you the question. Mr. Auerbach. It took part largely by peaceful means. The violence took place after the taking of power, largely. Senator Jackson. I take it that your testimony is that the present regime in Russia, and the previous regime, came into existence by reason of the utilization of peaceful means. I believe that is your testimony. Is that your testimony? Mr. Auerbach. In Russia, in general, yes. That is what took place. Senator Jackson. And you are a student of history. Mr. Auerbach. Well, I consider myself something of a student of history. Senator Jackson. And how did it come into being in Czechoslovakia? Mr. Auerbach. Well, it came after a war, did it not? Senator Jackson. I say, did it come by democratic process? Mr. Auerbach. It came after a war, and the Czechoslovakian government was established by a democratic process. Senator Jackson. Which government are you talking about? The Communist government? Mr. Auerbach. The one that is in power now. Senator Jackson. And they have a democratic government in Czechoslovakia? Mr. Auerbach. They have a people's form of democracy. Senator Jackson. And communism came into being in Czechoslovakia, or what you call a people's form of democracy, through peaceful, democratic means? Mr. Auerbach. That is what took place throughout eastern Europe. Senator Jackson. Will you answer the question? Mr. Auerbach. Yes. Senator Jackson. It came by peaceful means? Mr. Auerbach. Yes. Senator Jackson. And it took place in the Soviet Union the same way? Mr. Auerbach. Not in exactly the same form. Senator Jackson. By peaceful means, though? Mr. Auerbach. It came into power peacefully. Senator Jackson. You are a marvelous student of history. Senator McClellan. You said it came into power in Russia by peaceful means, and that the violence took place afterwards, I believe? Mr. Auerbach. The violence took place, and a counter- revolution arose. Senator McClellan. The violence you refer to: Do you associate the purges with that? Mr. Auerbach. Well, I don't know what you mean by ``purges,'' Senator. Senator Jackson. The Czar gave up peacefully? Mr. Auerbach. Well, the Czar was out. You know, the Czar wasn't there when the Soviets took power. Senator Jackson. I am talking about the Czarist regime. Mr. Auerbach. He had already been executed. Senator Jackson. But that was a peaceful execution? Mr. Auerbach. Well, he had been executed while the Kerensky government was in power. Senator Jackson. And how did they get rid of the Kerensky government? Mr. Auerbach. They were voted out by the congress of Soviets. Senator McClellan. They were voted out by bullets, were they not? Mr. Auerbach. Well, they are the ones that brought bullets in, weren't they? They were the ones that organized the counter-revolutionary elements. Senator Jackson. You are familiar with the statement in Pravda recently, in which they announced that there is a Zionist plot in the Soviet Union. Do you go along with that statement? Mr. Auerbach. I don't know all the circumstances involved there, and I haven't followed that too closely. But I do know this, that over a long period of years the Communists in the Soviet Union have fought Zionism. And this is nothing new in their policy. Senator Jackson. And are you in favor of that? Mr. Auerbach. Zionism as a reactionary form of nationalism--it does have its dangerous aspects. Senator Jackson. You are opposed to Zionism as such? Mr. Auerbach. I am opposed to Zionism as a philosophy and a program, yes. Mr. Cohn. Did you ever disagree with anything in Pravda that you read? Mr. Auerbach. I don't read Pravda. The Chairman. You say you do not read Pravda? Mr. Auerbach. I don't read Pravda. Mr. Cohn. You read translations of articles from Pravda don't you? Mr. Auerbach. Very occasionally. Those that are reported in the newspaper. The Chairman. When you were foreign editor of the Daily Worker, did you ever read translations of articles from Pravda? Mr. Auerbach. May I consult with my lawyer? [Mr. Auerbach confers with Mr. Forer.] Mr. Auerbach. I will refuse to answer that question, Senator, on the grounds previously indicated. Senator McClellan. I have one more question, Mr. Chairman. I believe in the beginning of your testimony you refused to answer whether you were a Communist or not, on the ground that it might incriminate you. Mr. Auerbach. Substantially, yes. Senator McClellan. In view of the admissions you have made here with respect to your views, do you now insist that it might incriminate you if you answer that question? Mr. Auerbach. You mean if you were to ask me the question now? Senator McClellan. I will ask it again, and ask you whether you think it would incriminate you now, in view of the testimony you have already given. Are you a member of the Communist party? Mr. Auerbach. My answer would remain the same as previously. Senator McClellan. You refuse to answer on the ground that it might incriminate you? Mr. Auerbach. On the ground of my constitutional privilege under the Fifth Amendment. Senator McClellan. Well, are you sincere in believing it might incriminate you if you answered truthfully? Mr. Auerbach. If I answered truthfully and sincerely. Senator McClellan. I ask you now: Are you of the opinion that it might incriminate you if you answered the question truthfully? Mr. Auerbach. May I consult? [Mr. Auerbach confers with Mr. Forer.] Mr. Auerbach. It might tend to. The Chairman. That was not the question. Senator McClellan. No, I am asking you if you are sincere-- -- Mr. Auerbach. I am sincere. Senator McClellan [continuing]. In making the statement that you are afraid it might incriminate you. Mr. Auerbach. That it might tend to incriminate me, yes. Senator McClellan. Do you think it would add any particular force to the testimony you have already given as to whether you are a Communist or not? Mr. Auerbach. I don't quite understand your question. Senator McClellan. In other words, do you not think you have already admitted in the record that you subscribe to all of the philosophy and the objectives of communism? Have you not already admitted it? Mr. Auerbach. What I have done, of course, is discuss my opinions and my beliefs. Senator McClellan. You have pointed out that there is a difference in your opinion---- Mr. Auerbach. I believe it was Senator McCarthy who said I had a right to any opinion or belief. Senator McClellan. You have. I am not questioning that. What I am saying is: Is there any difference between the beliefs you have expressed, and communism? You say you do not want to answer whether you are a Communist or not. Can you point out any difference in the opinions you have expressed here as your beliefs, and what the Communist party stands for? Can you point out any? [Mr. Auerbach confers with Mr. Forer.] Senator McClellan. I would like for the record to show a long consultation with counsel. Mr. Auerbach. Well, I have discussed my beliefs, stated my beliefs. Senator McClellan. I agree with you. Mr. Auerbach. But when a question of being a member or not being a member of the Communist party is raised, that is on another order. That is an organizational question. Senator McClellan. I am asking you now, in view of the beliefs that you have expressed here for the record, and on the record: Can you point out any difference between those beliefs and the beliefs of communism and what the Communist party stands for? Can you point out any difference? In all fairness to you, if there is some reason why you do not want to admit you are a Communist, can you point out any difference between what you have expressed here on the record and what communism stands for, and its objectives? Mr. Auerbach. May I consult? [Mr. Auerbach confers with Mr. Forer.] Mr. Auerbach. Well, we are getting to very fine points here. My answer would be, ``No.'' Senator McClellan. I thank you very much. Mr. Auerbach. We are merely within the realm of belief, talking about opinions and beliefs. Senator Jackson. In other words, you believe in the objectives and the things that the Communist party stands for? Mr. Auerbach. Its general objectives, yes. Senator Jackson. Of the Communist party, as we know it? Mr. Auerbach. Yes. The Chairman. Let me ask this: If the Communist party objectives could not be achieved in this country by peaceful means, would you favor achieving them by force and violence? Mr. Auerbach. That is one of those ``iffy'' questions about the future that one never knows how it is going to turn out. I am not in favor of achieving it by force and violence, and I would like to see it achieved as peacefully as possible. I would certainly work for that. The Chairman. I think you can answer that question. As I say, we are interested in this, because you are one of the men whose books are being used to fight communism throughout the world, believe it or not. Mr. Auerbach. That is news to me. I would like to know how that happened. Senator Jackson. The chairman might have placed the witness in serious trouble, if the Communist party finds out he has been used to fight them. He will be up for disloyalty. The Chairman. In view of the fact that you are being used, and we are paying money to buy your books, to fight communism, I think we are entitled to an answer to that question. That is this: If you can not achieve a Communist society in this country by peaceful means, if it is found to be impossible, then would you favor using force to accomplish that objective? Mr. Auerbach. I would answer that question by saying I am not in favor of using force and violence to obtain that objective. As to the alternative you place, I am in no position, nor is anyone else in position to know. The Chairman. I am going to insist that you answer that. I say: If you could not achieve a Communist society in this country by peaceful means, if you find that is impossible, then would you favor achieving it by force and violence? The only grounds upon which I would let you avoid answering that is if you say that the answer will tend to incriminate you. [Mr. Auerbach confers with Mr. Forer.] Mr. Auerbach. I can't answer the question, because I have no opinion on it. I haven't thought about it, and I haven't tried to determine an answer to that question. I just don't have any opinion. The Chairman. In other words, at this time you say you do not know whether you would favor using force and violence to establish a Communist society in this country, if it could not be done by peaceful means? You say you cannot answer that. You do not know. Mr. Auerbach. I can't answer it, because one does not know just what kind of circumstances would arise, how a question like that would arise. I have given it no thought and have no opinion on it. Senator McClellan. You are not willing to say under oath at this time that you would not? Mr. Auerbach. I am not willing to say under oath anything on the question, because I do not know. The Chairman. At Communist meetings, did you ever discuss the necessity of establishing a Communist society in America by using force and violence? Mr. Auerbach. I will have to claim my privilege on that, sir, The Chairman. Did you know anyone on the Daily Worker, ever, at any time, who was not a member of the Communist party? Mr. Auerbach. I will have to claim my privilege on that one, too, sir. The Chairman. Your testimony under oath is that you do not know Reed Harris? Mr. Auerbach. I do not recall him in any way. Senator McClellan. I suggest, Mr. Chairman, you further identify Reed Harris, the position he now holds, where he went to school, and the meetings attended. Let us see if we cannot refresh his memory. The Chairman. Reed Harris, according to the testimony heretofore taken before this committee, attended Columbia University and was expelled or suspended. He had been editor of the Spectator. He appeared at a meeting at Columbia to defend Don Henderson, who was about to lose his contract as a teacher. Henderson, at that time, was identified as a Communist. He is the man who has been identified as having appeared on a platform with you, Oakley Johnson, Donald Henderson, to defend Mr. Gallagher, Mr. Leo Gallagher, a professor being expelled from the University of California because of Communist activities. He has been active in the WPA, the Writers Project, has worked under Alsberg, is now the deputy administrator of the International Information Administration. With that information, is it your testimony that you have no recollection now of ever having met him? Mr. Auerbach. That is my testimony. I have no recollection of ever having met him, nor do I have a recollection of the meeting that you referred to. The Chairman. Did you know Owen Lattimore? Mr. Auerbach. Yes, I think I met him at one meeting. That is, I am not quite sure, but at a previous hearing that question was asked me, and I was shown a memorandum saying that such a meeting was held, at which he was present and I was present, and I assume that if there was such a memorandum--it was many years ago--it was so. I just didn't recollect having met him. The Chairman. What meeting was that? Where was it held? Mr. Auerbach. That was a meeting of the IPR. Mr. Chairman. And that was the only meeting you ever attended with Owen Lattimore? Mr. Auerbach. Yes, if he was there, and I assume he was. The Chairman. Is it your testimony that you never received instructions, either directly or indirectly, to your knowledge, from Moscow, so far as Communist activities were concerned? Mr. Auerbach. I will claim my privilege on that. The Chairman. I think I have no further questions of this witness at this time. You will be requested, or perhaps I should say ordered, to appear tomorrow morning at 10:15 in this room. And that will be a public hearing. You will have the same rights as far as counsel is concerned as you have today. Mr. Cohn. I think you have another witness, Mr. Forer. Mr. Forer. Shall I bring him in? Mr. Cohn. Yes. The Chairman. Will, you raise your right hand, sir? In this matter now in hearing before the committee, do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Mr. Mandel. I do. Mr. Cohn. Give us your full name, please. TESTIMONY OF WILLIAM MARX MANDEL (ACCOMPANIED BY HIS COUNSEL, JOSEPH FORER) Mr. Mandel. William Marx Mandel. Mr. Cohn. Is that M-a-r-x? Mr. Mandel. Yes. Mr. Cohn. And where do you reside? Mr. Mandel. 545 West 164th Street, New York City. The Chairman. Is that the name you have always gone under? Mr. Mandel. I refuse to answer that question, under my privilege within the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, not to testify against myself. The Chairman. May I ask this question? Is that the name that you bore when you were, we will say, one year old? If you think it will incriminate you, you may refuse to answer. Mr. Mandel. I will stick to the Fifth Amendment. The Chairman. In other words, you say if you tell us what your name was when you were a year old, it might tend to incriminate you? Mr. Mandel. Well, it is quite obvious that carried up to the present day, it may lead to something which might tend to incriminate me. The Chairman. Well, it is a broad privilege. Senator Jackson. Is this your true name, that you gave the committee? Mr. Mandel. That is my true name. Senator Jackson. Your true name. And what was your full name, again? Mr. Mandel. William Marx Mandel, M-a-n-d-e-l. The Chairman. Let me ask you this: Have you written under pseudonyms? Mr. Mandel. I will have to give the same reply. The Chairman. You refuse to answer on the ground that it might incriminate you? Mr. Mandel. Yes. Mr. Cohn. Are you the author of Soviet Far East and Central Asia, Mr. Mandel \\2\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\2\\ William Mandel, The Soviet Far East and Central Asia (New York, International Secretariat, Institute of Pacific Relations, 1944). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mr. Mandel. I am. Mr. Cohn. When did you write that book? Mr. Mandel. Well, I think I wrote most of it in 1942, and I think some of the additional material came in 1943, '42-'43. Mr. Cohn. Were you a member of the Communist party in 1942- 43? Mr. Mandel. I must refuse to answer that question, under my privilege within the Fifth Amendment not to be a witness against myself. Mr. Cohn. Have you ever engaged in espionage? Mr. Mandel. No. Mr. Cohn. Do you know of any Communists who ever did engage in espionage or any related activity? Mr. Mandel. I don't understand ``related activity.'' Mr. Cohn. I will withdraw that. Did you know of any Communists who have engaged in espionage? Mr. Mandel. No. Mr. Cohn. Are you a member of the Communist party today? The Chairman. The question is: Are you a member of the Communist party as of today? Mr. Mandel. I refuse to answer under the Fifth Amendment. Mr. Cohn. Have you ever engaged in sabotage or any other illegal act against the United States? Mr. Mandel. I refuse to answer under the Fifth Amendment. The Chairman. Will you separate the question? Mr. Cohn. Have you ever engaged in sabotage against the United States? Mr. Mandel. I refuse to answer under the Fifth Amendment. Mr. Cohn. Have you ever violated any law of the United States? The Chairman. I don't think that is a proper question. Senator Jackson. Beyond the scope of the committee. The Chairman. Mr. Mandel, have you ever been convicted of any crime? [Mr. Mandel confers with Mr. Forer.] Mr. Mandel. Will you repeat the question, please? The Chairman. The question was: Were you ever convicted of a crime? Mr. Mandel. If disorderly conduct be regarded as such--I think it is a misdemeanor--the answer is ``yes.'' Mr. Cohn. In connection with what? That is a matter of public record, I suppose. In connection with a demonstration or riot or something? Mr. Mandel. No, the answer is that I was selling a pamphlet, about twenty-odd years ago, or perhaps not that long ago. Mr. Cohn. What was the pamphlet? Mr. Mandel. The pamphlet was called ``The Truth about Father Coughlin.'' The Chairman. And you were arrested at that time and convicted of disorderly conduct? Mr. Mandel. That is my recollection. The Chairman. And that is the only time that you were either arrested and convicted of any crime? Mr. Mandel. Other than traffic violations, or things of that kind. That is the best of my recollection. Mr. Cohn. Do you know Louis F. Budenz. Mr. Mandel. Fifth Amendment. Mr. Cohn. Would you fight for the United States against the Soviet Union in the event the United States Congress declared war against the Soviet Union? Mr. Mandel. Yes. Mr. Cohn. Under any circumstances? Mr. Mandel. If the United States Congress declared war, yes. Mr. Cohn. You would. Do you believe that our cause in Korea is a just cause? Mr. Mandel. No. Mr. Cohn. You do not? Mr. Mandel. No. Mr. Cohn. Would you fight on the side of the United States and the United Nations in Korea? Mr. Mandel. Under the laws of the country, if required to, yes. The Chairman. Do you think the cause of the North Koreans and the Chinese Communists is a just cause in Korea? [Mr. Mandel confers with Mr. Forer.] Mr. Mandel. The answer is ``yes.'' The Chairman. It is a just cause? Mr. Mandel. That is correct. Mr. Cohn. That is very interesting. What did you say your occupation was at the present time? Mr. Mandel. Let me preface my reply, and I will answer the question if you insist. My occupation at the present time has, as will be evident if you press me, no conceivable relation to any business before this committee. Therefore, to request this--and I will answer it if you press me--can only have the effect, if this is later made public, of causing me to lose my livelihood, something which I will make the most of, I state quite candidly. Mr. Cohn. Is that a threat? Mr. Mandel. That is not a threat. That is simply a statement. Mr. Cohn. Where are you going to make the most of it? The Chairman. On the reason for calling you, or not, you said the question of your occupation would have nothing to do with what is before the committee. We are checking into the information program, which has been costing us, oh, $125 mill or $135 million a year. And we have been checking into the background, the activities, on some of the individuals who are being used in this fight against communism. That is the announced objective of the information program. And I think under the circumstances it is a pertinent question to ask you about your background, what you are doing today. I do not know what you are doing today, you see, until you answer the question. Mr. Mandel. I am a writer of medical advertising copy to the profession. Mr. Cohn. How long have you been doing that kind of work? Mr. Mandel. Oh, since shortly after the last time I was before a committee hearing here in Washington. Mr. Cohn. What were you doing before that? Mr. Mandel. Before that I was in the furniture business for a year. Mr. Cohn. And what were you doing between then and the time you were before some other committee? Mr. Mandel. I have been before one previous committee. Let me see, now. I have been in this work for a year. I was in the furniture business for just about a year, I would imagine. And last prior to that, I was employed as a translator for the Stefansson Library at 14 St. Luke's Place, New York City. The Chairman. Is that Vilhjalmur Stefannson? Mr. Mandel. Vilhjalmur, yes. The Chairman. I would like to get your thought on this. You seem to think that we should not inquire as to your occupation as of today. If you have any valid grounds on which you want to urge that, we would be glad to hear them. Mr. Mandel. Yes. The advertising business is a very public relations-conscious business, and the firm by which I am employed has important concerns as its clients, and they are probably more public relations-conscious than is necessary. That is the situation in the industry. So that if it became public knowledge that someone employed by that firm had been before this committee, that, in itself, would probably--it is a guess; I think a sound guess--would probably be cause for my losing my employment. The Chairman. Well, now, I do not want to argue this point with you, but I would like to get the thought of the other senators on this. My thought is, Senator Jackson, that here you have a man who says, ``If I tell you the truth about whether I am a Communist today, that might incriminate me.'' It creates a strong inference, certainly, that he is a member of the Communist party. Otherwise, it could not very well incriminate him. His works are being used to fight communism. He is now writing advertising copy, material being read by the general public. I can't think of any reason why his occupation should not be known. Do you? Senator Jackson. Well, I think that the committee has a right, on the basis of asking the routine questions incident to an over-all investigation, to ask what a man is doing and where he lives. On that basis also, I think we have the right to ask. Might I say to the witness: I am sure you are realistic enough to know that when you come before a committee in open session it will be known in time whether you have answered, and maybe in a way that might confuse the public; it will be known that you have appeared, and it will be brought out through the press that you worked for such and such a company. And it would occur to me that in order to keep the record straight, you should simply state it. You are in that situation, and apparently that is the price you have to pay as a member of the Communist party. The Chairman. And as a country, we are apparently dedicated to the idea that communism is wrong, that it is set to destroy us, that it is a conspiracy, that it is a crime to be a member if you are aware of the conspiracy. Therefore, when a man comes before the committee and says, ``I will not tell whether I am a Communist or not,'' he, I believe, forfeits any right or any privilege or special protection by the committee. I think he should answer all the questions. Under the circumstances, the answer will stay in the record. Mr. Cohn. Will you give us the name and address of your business, and telephone number, at the present time? Mr. Mandel. Yes. The only point I want to make before answering it is that I claim no privilege on this matter, and I simply want to point out that if the committee wishes to face the onus of causing loss of a job, not in any abstract sense--I don't think that concerns the committee at all--but in the practical sense of the impression that might be created upon the public, if that is the case, I will, since I am aware of no privilege on this matter, be happy to give you the information. The Chairman. May I say that I get the impression from what you said that you were threatening the committee. When you are outside the committee room, you can say anything you like about this committee, and if you are a member of the Communist party, as you indicate by your answer, you are dedicated, of course, to attacking this committee, regardless of whether you lose your job. I have been a subject of attacks by every Communist writer, every Communist in the country. None of them, as far as I know, have been supporting me or this committee. So that you are not impressing us at all by any threat to attack it. You will be just one of a long line, if you do answer the question. Mr. Mandel. The firm I am employed by is L. W. Frohlich, F- r-o-h-l-i-c-h, and Company, and I don't know at the moment-- they are in three buildings. I suppose the legal address is 76 East 52nd Street, New York City. Mr. Cohn. What kind of a firm did you say this was? Mr. Mandel. They advertise medical products to the profession solely. That is their business. Mr. Cohn. Do they have any connection with the government in any way, any government work? Mr. Mandel. None whatever, to the best of my knowledge. Mr. Cohn. I have no further questions of this witness, Mr. Chairman. You have told us you are the author of Soviet Far East and Central Asia? Mr. Mandel. That is right. Mr. Cohn. You decline to tell us whether or not you were a member of the Communist party at the time you wrote that book? Mr. Mandel. That is correct, for the reason stated. Mr. Cohn. Is there anything in that book unfavorable to the Soviet Union? Mr. Mandel. I haven't read the book in quite a while. Mr. Cohn. Can you give us your best recollection on it? Mr. Mandel. As far as that book is concerned, I cannot say offhand. I can state that, as I stated to a committee last year, I am aware of injustices, errors, and more of them than I have described in things that I have written, and have no hesitation discussing them, and I simply don't know, frankly, whether in that work at that time I discussed that or not. Senator Jackson. Have you written anything unfavorable to the Soviet Union at any time? Mr. Mandel. In the first place, you would have to define the term. In short, if one describes the term ``favorable'' as meaning that everything that happens there is good and nothing that happens there is bad, then I would say that I certainly have written unfavorable things. I just don't recall. The book was written ten years ago, is on a specialized subject, and I just don't recall. Senator Jackson. What is your opinion of the anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union? Mr. Mandel. Being a Jew, I have certain standards on the basis of which to judge that. I have never encountered an anti- Semitic government in history that had a Jewish member of its cabinet. Mr. Cohn. Who is the member of the Jewish Cabinet? Mr. Mandel. Kaganovich, K-a-g-a-n-o-v-i-c-h. The Chairman. What is his position? Mr. Mandel. He is one of the vice premiers, one of the members of the five inner cabinet under the present administration. Mr. Cohn. I think Senator Jackson's question was addressed to these purges. Do you approve of the anti-Semitic purges? Mr. Mandel. I think that is utter nonsense. Mr. Cohn. That is just counter-revolutionary propaganda? Mr. Mandel. It is not counter-revolutionary propaganda. It is nonsense. I went down and bought a copy of True, Soviet Labor party. I bought copies of Pravda at the library next to the main public library on 42nd Street. Four days after this thing happened, that comes over by air mail, when our post office doesn't stop it. And on the same front page of the same paper which presented the indictment of these physicians, there was an announcement of the meeting the previous evening of the committee of Judges for Stalin prize awards in the literature and science for this coming year. Among the eleven judges are two men who are well-known to be Jewish. Mr. Cohn. And that is that? Mr. Mandel. And many similar things. If you want a lecture for an hour and a half, I would be glad to give it to you. Mr. Cohn. Do you know a man named Aaron Berg, who is a very high functionary in the Soviet Union at the present time? Mr. Mandel. He is a very prominent writer. I don't know that he has a function of any kind. The Chairman. Just one question. As I read the account of the trials in the Slansky and other cases, the news stories were to the effect that some of the individuals confessed to being Zionists. They were hung. That apparently was a major part of their alleged crime. Would you agree that it would be a crime to be a Zionist? Mr. Mandel. Their crimes under the indictment were military treason, economic treason, murder, and a fourth which I don't recall at the moment. You may have whatever opinion you care to about the confessions and the evidence. The fact is that they describe at great length the crimes which they committed. And it is a rather interesting fact to me that the New York Herald Tribune correspondent reported from Washington a couple of days later that informed anti-Communists in Washington apparently feel that these men were a little inept and stupid, and more able men will have to be gotten into that job next time. Senator Jackson. Well, let me ask you this: You do not think it is unusual that simultaneously, at least, leaders of the Communist party in the Soviet Union and the satellite areas of Jewish origin were all brought to trial at once? Mr. Mandel. The United States government is openly and publicly engaged in a program of espionage against the Soviet Union. In order to do this kind of thing, you have got to have people who are going to be able to get inside of those countries. Now, the State Department, which you gentlemen seem to have differences with, has pursued a policy of cutting off trade with those countries. Therefore you cannot possibly use a businessman as cover for that kind of operation. The other side has cut down the number of journalists which they admit in to a very small number. Therefore, it is very difficult to find more people like Oatis to do that kind of job. And so what you are left with is the possibility of using whoever can get in. Now, the allegedly anti-Semitic governments of the east European countries permitted only Jewish organizations, and particularly this Joint Distribution Committee, to function within their territories after World War II, despite the fact that there are similar Ukranian organizations. Pardon me just one moment. And apparently they did so on the grounds that the Jews had suffered special persecution. So that it would seem entirely logical to me that a government which is by open proclamation engaged in espionage in their countries as our government is would utilize whatever organization comes to hand that has access to those countries. Therefore, it is not at all surprising that certain people with that kind of connection were brought to trial. Senator Jackson. You said the Ukrainian organizations were not allowed to function. Mr. Mandel. To the best of my knowledge. Remember, I am speaking of foreign non-Soviet and east European organizations. Senator Jackson. What did you say about a Ukrainian organization? Mr. Mandel. I said Ukrainian organizations existing in the United States and Canada were not permitted to function on a parallel relief basis as the Joint Distribution Committee was. Senator Jackson. Well, the Ukrainians have never been very reliable so far as the Soviets are concerned. Mr. Mandel. That is a matter of opinion. I would say the record of World War II is that the overwhelming majority of the Ukrainians were entirely loyal. Hitler put up a puppet government which fell to pieces in a few weeks. Senator Jackson. When they are fighting for their home that is something else; but I am talking about reliable from an ideological standpoint. Mr. Mandel. My opinion, since it is a matter of opinion, is that the overwhelming majority of the Ukrainians have been loyal to the Soviet Union during the vast bulk of this thirty- five-year period. Senator Jackson. So you do not think it is unusual that Anna Pauker has been removed? Mr. Mandel. Anna Pauker's successor is a man named Simon Bugitch, who is also a Jew. Senator Jackson. You do not think that the Jewish leaders in the Czechoslovakian government, that were all purged at the same time, and the doctors in the Kremlin, provide any significant pattern? You think that is totally unrelated to any anti-Semitism within the Soviet Union? Mr. Mandel. The foreign minister of Czechoslovakia, who is here at the present time, is Jewish, and so forth, on down the line. Senator Jackson. I am glad you said that. Would you like to assure the committee that their tenure is going to be pretty certain for the future, so we can check on this? The Chairman. I am afraid he could not do that. Let me ask you this question: Do you think the Communist society is superior to our society in this country? Mr. Mandel. That would be an interesting question to debate. But there again, circumstances being what they are, and legislation being what it is, I am afraid that I would have to rely upon the Fifth Amendment and refuse to reply to that question. The Chairman. Let us rephrase the question. Do you think the present type of Communist government as it exists in Russia is superior to the present form of government as it exists in the United States of America? Mr. Mandel. That I am afraid is governed by exactly the same privilege, in view of legislation and prosecutions that have taken place, with which Mr. Cohn is quite familiar. Mr. Cohn. Thank you. Mr. Mandel. So that I am afraid I am unable to answer that question. The Chairman. In other words, is it your answer that if you told us the truth in answer to that question, you think that that answer might tend to incriminate you? Mr. Mandel. No, sir. I think that the Fifth Amendment has as its purpose to protect the innocent, and I think that the origin of the Fifth Amendment lies in the protection of political dissent. The Chairman. You will then be ordered to answer the question. [Mr. Mandel confers with Mr. Forer.] The Chairman. May I say to counsel that I do not want to interrupt the consultation, but---- Mr. Forer. I think he misunderstood the preceding question, and his answer to that led to your direction. That is what I think is the situation. But I understand the chair's position. Mr. Mandel. What was the question prior to the last question? The Chairman. Maybe I should rephrase the question. The question originally asked was: Do you consider the present Communist government in Russia more desirable than the present government which we have in the United States? Mr. Mandel. And to that question I will reply that I refuse to answer under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. The Chairman. Now my question to you is, do you feel that if you told the truth in answer to that question, your answer might tend to incriminate you? Mr. Mandel. Yes. Let me make this clear---- The Chairman. First, just so you will understand us fully: You see, you are not entitled to claim privilege if you incriminate yourself by committing perjury. It is only when a truthful answer will incriminate you that you are entitled to claim privilege. Before we can determine whether you are entitled to claim privilege, we must know whether or not you honestly feel that a truthful answer might tend to incriminate you. That is the purpose of that question. Mr. Mandel. I would say that a truthful answer might tend to incriminate me. The Chairman. Okay. Then you are entitled to the privilege. Mr. Mandel. Fine. The Chairman. We will excuse you until 10:15 tomorrow morning. [Whereupon, at 4:45 p.m., a recess was taken until 10:30 a.m., Tuesday, March 24, 1953.] STATE DEPARTMENT INFORMATION PROGRAM--INFORMATION CENTERS [Editor's note.--The literary witnesses on March 24, 1953 included the former Pinkerton detective turned novelist, Dashiell Hammett (1894-1961), author of Red Harvest (1929), The Dain Curse (1929), The Maltese Falcon (1930), The Glass Key (1931), and The Thin Man (1934), which later appeared as motion pictures. Hammett had joined the Communist party in 1937, taught at the Jefferson School for Social Science, and was a trustee of the bail fund for the Civil Rights Congress. He was convicted of contempt of court for refusing to identify the contributors to the bail fund and served a prison term from July to December 1951. Under the pseudonym Helen Kay, Helen Colodny Goldfrank wrote such children's books as Insects (1939), Apple Pie for Lewis (1951), Snow Birthday (1955), Secrets of the Dolphin (1964), Apes (1970), and The First Teddy Bear (1985). Jerre Mangione (1909-1998) worked for Time magazine before becoming an editor for the Federal Writers' Project--the subject of his later book, The Dream and the Deal: The Federal Writers' Project, 1935-43 (1972). In 1943 he published Mount Allegro, an autobiographical account of his life as the son of Sicilian immigrants, which his publisher believed would sell better if issued as a work of fiction. Mount Allegro became a best seller and was reissued five times by different publishers. In later years, Mangione taught English at the University of Pennsylvania. A major writer in the Harlem Renaissance, Langston Hughes (1902-1967) published his first book of poetry, The Weary Blues, in 1926. During the 1930s he wrote for the New Masses and traveled to Russia to make a film about race relations in the United States, which was never produced. The author of plays, novels, short stories, film scripts, musicals, war correspondence and a regular newspaper column for the Chicago Defender, Hughes was best known for his poetry, and edited the anthologies The Poetry of the Negro, 1746-1949 (1949) and New Negro Poets, USA (1964). Dashiell Hammett, Helen Goldfrank and Langston Hughes testified at a public hearing on March 26, 1953. Jerre Mangione did not testify publicly.] ---------- TUESDAY, MARCH 24, 1953 U.S. Senate, Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Government Operations, Washington, DC. The subcommittee met, pursuant to Senate Resolution 40, agreed to January 30, 1953, at 2:00 p.m. in room 357 of the Senate Office Building, Senator Karl E. Mundt, presiding. Present: Senator Karl E. Mundt, Republican, South Dakota; Senator Everett M. Dirksen, Republican, Illinois; Senator John L. McClellan, Democrat, Arkansas; and Senator Stuart Symington, Democrat, Missouri. Present also: Roy Cohn, chief counsel; David Schine, chief consultant; Daniel Buckley, assistant counsel; Henry Hawkins, investigator; and Ruth Young Watt, chief clerk. Senator Mundt. The committee will come to order. Mr. Cohn. The first witness is Mr. Hammett, Mr. Chairman. Senator Mundt. Mr. Hammett, do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give us is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Mr. Hammett. I do. Senator Mundt. Be seated. Proceed, Mr. Cohn. TESTIMONY OF DASHIELL HAMMETT Mr. Cohn. Mr. Hammett, will you give your full name, please? Mr. Hammett. Samuel Dashiell Hammett. Mr. Cohn. And what is your occupation? Mr. Hammett. Writer. Mr. Cohn. You are an author? Mr. Hammett. That is right. Mr. Cohn. For how long have you followed that calling? Mr. Hammett. Since about 1922, roughly thirty years. Mr. Cohn. You know that a considerable number of your works are used in the State Department Information Program? Mr. Hammett. I did not know that until you told me on the phone. Mr. Cohn. Do you think we have given you a good civil suit for royalties? Mr. Hammett. I doubt that, because thinking about it, the chances are the radio end that was sold is owned by the movie people. Mr. Cohn. Are you a member of the Communist party today? Mr. Hammett. I decline to answer on the ground that the answer would tend to incriminate me, pleading my rights under the Fifth Amendment. Mr. Cohn. Were you a member of the Communist party in 1922? Mr. Hammett. I decline to answer on the ground that the answer might tend to incriminate me. Mr. Cohn. You have written a number of books between 1922 and the present time, have you not? Mr. Hammett. Yes. Mr. Cohn. About how many? Mr. Hammett. Five, I think. Mr. Cohn. Just five books? Mr. Hammett. Yes, and many short stories and stuff that has been reprinted in reprint books. Mr. Cohn. If I were to ask you as to each one of these books if you were a Communist party member at the time you wrote the book what would your answer be? Mr. Hammett. The same. Mr. Cohn. You would refuse on the ground you stated? Mr. Hammett. Yes. Mr. Cohn. Did you write a story which could be classed as other than a detective story? Mr. Hammett. Yes. Mr. Cohn. What? Mr. Hammett. I have written quite a number of short stories that were not detective stories. Mr. Cohn. Any that deal with social problems? Mr. Hammett. I don't think so. Yes, I remember one, if you take it as a social problem. Some short stories have been in paper bound books that have been published in book form. Mr. Cohn. Did any of those deal with social problems? Mr. Hammett. Yes. As a matter of fact, roughly one that I remember, a short story called ``Night Shade.'' Mr. Cohn. ``Night Shade''?
