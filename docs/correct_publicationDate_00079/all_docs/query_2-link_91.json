        "text": "YA Lit. Summaries (from #18-Permanent Connections)\n\n18. Permanent Connections--Sue Ellen Bridgers, copyright l987\n\nRob Dickson is a troubled teen, does drugs/alcohol, feels constantly inadequate; his parents--upper middle class New Jersey-ites--are worried about him. His dad's (Davis Dickson) roots are in North Carolina--Tyler Mills. Carrie, Rob's mom, is a college teacher; Allison, Rob's sister, is younger and \"the perfect\" daughter.\n\nFairlee Dickson, Davis' older brother, has broken a hip. He's the essential caretaker of Grandpa Dickson (the father of Davis, Fairlee, Coralee, and Rosalie) and Cora (a spinster who has cared for her parents; has become \"agoraphobic\"--unable to handle leaving her home).\n\nRosalie is married to Avery; Leanna is their daughter who dates Travis. Rosalie is a constant \"nag\" about everything and everyone.\n\nRob thinks he's going to be around just a week; ends up being told by his dad that he (Rob) is going to need to stay until maybe Thanksgiving when his uncle is well enough to manuever. Rob's family is Episcopalian--in contrast to the \"heavily\" Baptist Dickson clan of the south. Ending line of Ch. 11 after Rob finds out he has to stay for 3 months--he says this to Coralee, \"Nothing hurts me.\" (49)\n\nEllery Collier and her mom, Ginny live up the ridge from the Dicksons. Ellery likes Fairlee and meets Rob through Fairlee. Ellery is also feeling a \"misfit\" in Tyler Mills; her parents have recently divorced. Ellery wanted to be able to stay with her father -- that wasn't possible. Ellery and Rob are both runners--both run to help them handle the struggles. Ellery's words to herself at the end of Ch. 15, p. 67, \"Go away, Rob Dickson...I've got all the hurt I can handle.\" But she continues to care.\n\nGinny, who does all kinds of weaving and who feels her own inadequacies and loneliness, helps Cora move out of the fear of going outside/becomes crucial when Cora goes to the hospital when her dad is found near death after going out to search for Rob. (near the end of the novel)\n\nRob is sick to his stomach the whole first week of school--he doesn't fit in with the \"redneck\" type students, even though Travis tries to make him a member of the group. Eventually from Travis, whose brothers grow marijuana, Rob will get some joints and is picked up for driving under the influence of marijuana. This all comes after the struggles to be in relationship with Ellery. She's afraid that Rob \"wants\" too much of her. Ellery plays flute, loves opera--eventually Rob listens to opera on his own.\n\nHoly Family in the Valley--little church Rob goes to--first with Ellery and later when he feels so defeated after being picked up after leaving Fairlee's truck where Rob had gotten stuck. Rob does one bout with alcohol; later buys the two joints from Travis. Rob calls Ginny (Ellery's mom) to post bail for him; he feels terrible having to face the family. Ginny suggests Jason Burnette for a lawyer. Deputy Gatewood \"dogs\" Rob till he thinks Rob will give the source of the marijuana; Rob doesn't. Travis's family area gets raided; the police don't find marijuana though.\n\nRob leaves the house in anger; goes to the church, cries, prays, and falls asleep. Later when he gets home, he is told his grandpa went searching for him. Rob searches all night and eventually finds his grandfather who needs to be hospitalized. Rob's dad has to come; sticks by his son through the trial. Rob goes to the church, meets the pastor, Tom Fowler, and tells the pastor all his sins/his failures. Fowler deals compassionately.\n\nRob goes on trial and is cleared of charges. He learns through the whole experience \"where he was going.\" Learns for the first time...(264).\n\n19. The Blue Door (3rd novel in The Quilt Trilogy) by Ann Rinaldi. Less Appalachian, but Southern. Deals with the South Carolina Islands--St. Helena Island and Yemassee. Lots of Southern/Northern issues as well as slavery and opposed laborers in the North in mills--specifically in Lowell, MA.\n\n20. This Business about Elijah (Jewish/young adult) Sheldon Oberman\n\n21. Dragons in the Water(combination mystery/morals young adult) Madeleine L'Engle\n\n22. Anastasia Krupnik Lois Lowry--great children's book about a 10 yr. old, precocious one. Some great examples of what not to do as teacher (the poetry example!!) and what to do (A.'s father and Mrs. W. when she calls about A.'s grandmother's death.\n\n23. Anastasia,Again Lois Lowry. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., l981\n\nIn this book Anastasia and family move to the suburbs; A. has all kind of misconceptions about the suburbs. She even convinces Sam to cry wildly when they get to the house the real estate agent shows them because if Sam cries, A. thinks maybe her parents won’t take it. Instead the house has a “tower” for A.’s room, a room which can be a study/library for her dad, and a solarium which can be her mom’s studio. It’s an old Victorian one. Next door is Mrs. Stein, who becomes a good friend to Sam (he calls her Gertrustein) and eventually to A. A. helps Mrs. Stein become more active again--encouraging her to get a new hairstyle and also creating a party with a group of senior citizens to come over to the K. house and eventually get introduced to A. In this book also, A. meets Steve Harvey, the boy she will eventually date.\n\n24. Anastasia Absolutely Lois Lowry. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., l995 (This book isn’t necessarily the next in the series--I read it out of order)\n\nAnastasia gets a dog--but she is the one who must care for it, meaning taking the dog for early a.m. walks. On the first day, as she goes out, she takes the NY TIMES out of its bag and takes the bag for a “poop scooper bag.” She is also supposed to mail a package for her mom, a set of illustrations. A. is considering what to name her dog and is distracted as she is out on this early a.m. walk. Fairly close to the mailbox, A. has to collect the “dog business” and she is really embarrassed. She is going over to the mailbox and by mistake puts the bag with the “poop” in the mailbox--as she does so, thinking she is mailing her mom’s package, she spots a man who looks at her fiercely. Only when A. gets home does she realize that she has put the wrong thing and worries that she has tampered with the mail (though she doesn’t know the real meaning of tampering. She had gotten the idea to name her dog, Sleuth--it is fitting since the dog is eventually the key to solving (plus preventing) a crime.\n\nA.’s 8th grade class is studying an ethics unit--her teacher gives them situations, and they must decide how to respond/write out their response. As A. does each of the questions, she keeps pondering her situation--should she call the PO and confess? She also finds out that the mailbox where she mistakenly put the “poop” has been taken away--her friends also tell her about seeing police at that corner that day; all this adds to A.’s worry. She spends times avoiding that path. Her teacher eventually notices how sad A. looks and asks her what’s up? A. can’t tell him, but does decide she should “confess.” When she calls the PO someone eventually comes to her house; it turns out a “mad bomber” --who many believe is a former postal employee--had put a bomb in the same mailbox that a.m. and the dog poop disabled the bomb. Eventually A. has to go to the police station and see if she can recognize/identify anyone who would have been in the area. Finally she remembers the man who has looked at her fiercely--he’d been wearing a Harvard sweatshirt--A.’s dad teaches at Harvard. A. is a hero.\n\n25. Anastasia At Your Service : Lois Lowry. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., l982.\n\nWorried by her minimal allowance, A. wants to find a job. She decides it would be great to be a companion to a wealthy older woman. A. creates an ad describing the position she wants; she also puts together a resume. (These are both great examples of writing). Mrs. Bellingham is the woman who calls for A.’s service. A. goes the first day thinking she is going to be a companion, but actually she’s put to work as a maid. In polishing the silverware (preparing for one of Mrs. B’s galas) A. drops one and it gets into the disposal and is ruined. Mrs. B. tells A. that she has to pay for this “bolster”--A. is interpreting the word incorrectly, so her mom can’t understand what A. must pay for. A. must continue working for Mrs. B. even though A. would like to quit, because she has to earn the money to pay for the spoon.\n\nMrs. B. is the grandmother of Daphne, one of A.’s new classmates, so A. is really embarrassed to think she must serve as a maid at D.’s birthday party, hosted by Mrs. B. A. decides she must look older--40 or so--so she creates “falsies” from panty hose of her mom’s, puts on make-up, and generally looks weird. As she is serving appetizers, her falsies get into the food. Daphne excuses herself and asks for A. to help her. In the bathroom, D. explains that she knows A. is not 40 and the girls become friends, allied against Mrs. B. who has given D. a doll for her b’day--D. considers this an affront--and has “deceived” A. by making her a maid, instead of a companion. The girls eventually decide to send invitations to Mrs. B. major fund-raiser out to various street people types.\n\nMeanwhile one night while A. and D. are together, Sam (who is very precocious and has learned the word “airplane,” falls out the window and is taken to the hospital. His curls need to be cut off, so the doctor can do work on his head. He looks like Kojak. A. is so worried that her brother will die; she promises to do whatever she can for him. Sam has supposedly met a person he calls Mrs. Flypaper--no one knows who that is. The family thinks Sam has created an imaginary friend to help him through all the trauma of the hospital etc.\n\nEventually A. finds out that Mrs. B. is the Mrs. Flypaper and Mrs. B. is a hospital benefactor. At this point, she doesn’t want to cause Mrs. B. pain, but the invitations have already gone out to the “street people.” In the end, the party works out for best and both A. and D. confess why they did what they did.\n\n26. Anastasia Ask Your Analyst Lois Lowry. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., l984\n\nA. is 13 and going through a time when she thinks her parents are awful and don’t understand her; A. thinks she should go to an analyst. Her parents tell her it’s all normal for teens to feel this way, but A. doesn’t believe this. A. gets 2 gerbils which she plans to use for a science project, studying their reproduction process. A.’s mom is terribly afraid of rodents and refuses to go into A.’s room to clean or anything since A. has the gerbils there. A. is supposed to keep a record of her project--there are samples of A.’s write-ups.\n\nThe gerbils give birth early--soon there are 11 gerbils and A. doesn’t know what she’ll do about all these.\n\nOne day when A. is with her friends at a yard sale she gets a bust of Freud--now A. has an analyst. She keeps this in her room and often “asks” Freud for help in her quandries. (A. has usually asked her goldfish Frank--he doesn’t answer much!!). A.’s parents ask her about problems--like Mom wonders how to deal with a nursery school mate of S.’s who is biting and cruel to Sam. The Nicky who “attacks” S. turns out to be a girl and N. has an obnoxious mom who doesn’t see the destruction that N. causes (there is a horrible experience when Mrs. K. invites N. and her mom over.)\n\nThe gerbils escape one day and are all over the house; A. is super stressed and eventually has to tell both her dad and S. about the gerbils. Finally the gerbils gets captured and Mrs. K. finds out. This book ends with Nicky, the obnoxious child needing to be in the hospital and the school sending a letter out about her classmates doing something for N. The Krupniks think a fitting gift will be the gerbils. A. has decided these will not do for a science project.\n\n27. Anastasia On Her Own : Lois Lowry. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, l985.\n\nAnastasia and her dad try to help Mrs. K. be more organized with the household work since Mrs. K. thinks she is a failure at this. It actually is the many unexpected things that come into each day that cause Mrs. K. to have problems. (Mrs. K. is an illustrator for books and does much painting) When A. and her dad (Myron) get a schedule organized, Mrs. K. can’t necessarily stay on it--lots of unexpected things come up. She eventually has to be gone to Los Angeles, since one of the works she illustrated is going to made into a film and she is asked to serve as consultant. She is supposed to be gone 9 days. Right after she leaves, A. is asked for a date--her first--by Steve Harvey. The date is to be that Friday p.m. Meanwhile, Annie, a former friend of Mr. K. (he had been in love with her before he met Katherine, Mrs. K.) comes back to town, and she invites herself to see Myron. Myron is panicky since Annie is coming for dinner on Fri. A. decides she’ll invite Steve for dinner so Mr. K. won’t have to face Annie alone.\n\nSam comes down with chicken pox; A. has to be out of school to care for S. A. now tries to manage the household schedule she and her dad had designed for Mrs. K. A. quickly realizes how problematic the schedule is, how hard it is to keep. When Mrs. K. calls the rest of the family refuses to tell her about S.’s chicken pox, Annie’s coming, and A.’s date. A. looks up info (in COSMOPOLITAN) about how to create a romantic dinner. She decides to have the purple, a passionate color scheme, for the dinner party. That involves dyeing a table cloth (eventually all A.’s dad’s shirts, by accident get dyed purple), A. wants to have purple make-up and all kinds of things to match. She does tell her father eventually about the romantic dinner; he promises to bring flowers for the table.\n\nIn trying to help Sam with the itch, A. mistakenly gives him a bath in baking powder instead of baking soda. Eventually she uses the baking soda, Sam no longer itchs. Sam has outlined each chicken pox in purple, making a dot-to-dot pattern.\n\nA.’s menu involves a veal dish. While cooking it, she keeps getting calls about free dance lessons (though there are of course a number of hidden expenses that are the “catch.”)--she ends up asking the man about cheesecloth and how to use a corkscrew. When the dinner comes, Steve isn’t prepared for A.’s romantic side; Annie is completing obnoxious--she’s also put on lots of weight and makes comments which continually have the word, “bleeping” this or that. The dinner is somewhat of a disaster and afterwards the kitchen is a mess, the laundry has piled up, no cleaning has been done, Mr. K. comes down with chicken pox. A. calls her mom, who comes home early and is able to get everything back to normal.\n\n28. Anastasia at the Address. Lois Lowry\n\nA. writes to a singles’ ad in the paper--she writes to a single white male. She is eventually answered--the man has gotten over 461 (416?) letters. He says he’d like a woman with a sloop--A. doesn’t know what that is. She asks her mom and Mrs. K. tells her it is a kind of boat; it turns out that Sam has a toy one. A. buys it from Sam eventually--Sam didn’t really want to sell it. Then A. could write that she had a sloop. A. uses the “secret name” Swifty, and has a series of words that the s-w-i-f-t-y stand for. (Copies of the letters are included in the book) One of A.’s friend’s older sister is getting married. Because of problems with the originally selected bridesmaid, the couple decide to have junior bridesmaids--her own sister and 3 of her classmates--A. is one. During this time each of the girls: Daphne, A., Meredith and Sonya (I think these last two names are correct) have been discussing whether they should spend time with boys--invest all they do to be noticed. The climax of the book comes when the single white male identifies himself at Septimus Smith and says he is coming to A.’s area and could come to meet her. But he turns out to be one of the groomsmen and A.’s partner (says his name is Tim, but his full name is Septimus--tells A. this at the wedding rehearsal dinner. A. has never revealed her name; she also make sure that she is not home on the day when Septimus (Tim) shows up.\n\n29. Anastasia’s Chosen Career: Lois Lowry. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., l987.\n\nA.’s class is supposed to do a paper on their chosen career. It’s a break time and most of her classmates get to go someplace to go skiing. A.’s parents won’t allow that so she asks if she can’t take the modeling class she’s found an article about. They eventually allow her do that--though it means going into Cambridge, where Mrs. K. thinks it isn’t really safe for A. to go--because A. talks about interviewing a book seller who knows A.’s dad--had a book-signing party for Mr. K. for one of his books of poetry that helps her convince her parents. Also A. will pay for the sessions--$116.00 or so.\n\nThe actual place A. goes does not look like the modeling studio which A. envisions or has imagined. Mrs. Szcempelowski and her husband, who are non-typical shapes/types for running a modeling school. Mrs. S. asks to be called Aunt Vera and her husband, Uncle Henry. The first student A. meets is an African Am. girl called Henrietta Peaboby, though anyone who calls her Henrietta is doomed to be crushed. She wants to be called Henry. The other students are Helen Marie Howell--a 12 yr. old who seems very shy and withdrawn; Bambie Browne, a 14 yr. old who thinks she’s God’s gift to fashion and modeling; and of all people, Robert Giannini--someone from A.’s previous school and neighborhood, who carries a briefcase and is the “nerdy” type.\n\nOn day one they tape the students doing some kind of talk/intro. so they can have a “before and after” comparison of their development of poise--poise and self-confidence are what A. keeps noting in her career paper writing--that even for the job of bookstore owner she needs these. Bambie does some Shakespeare cutting from ROMEO and JULIET--for effect.\n\nDuring lunch of day one, A. meets Barbara Page, the bookstore owner and has a delightful time with Barbara, whose shop is the downstairs of her home and who is a really charming woman who fondly remembers Myron Krupnik. A. is so taken with Barbara, that time runs out before A. can ask any questions.\n\nDay two is hairstyling--A. gets a neat style, but Henry becomes stunning with a cut sort of like an African goddess type. The 3 beauticians are also very untypical--really old women (in A.’s perspective) Helen Marie is also transformed by the hairstyle; she stills remain hesitant. Henry, Helen and A. get to do make-up, or be made up; Robert and Bambie have to have diet counseling. There’s also a time when each person has to walk like an animal they’d like to model. A. selects a giraffe.\n\nA. and Henry go to Pages bookstore together. Once more they have a delightful time with Barbara. B. gives Henry a book with the African women in whom H. looks like. A. discusses being an assistant for Barbara; A. feels B. gives too much away, does too much (readings for children and senior citizens etc. ). A. handles a phone call for B. and in the process sells a copy of her dad’s poetry book. A. wanted to buy a book while at B’s store, but B. ends up giving A. some books.\n\nThat evening A. goes to Henry’s house, meets a family who makes her feel at home--H.’s dad is a policeman. A. gets a ride home with the policeman.\n\nNext day of the class is a fashion consultation one--each person is outfitted according to the suggestions given by Aunt Vera. A. is darling, Robert and Bambie look good; once again Henry is stunning. When Helen goes in to the dressing room, and she has resisted getting dressed, she struggles and eventually runs away. Robert decides he will search her out. The next day he and Helen do return. It’s a day for recording again and specifically saying what each got out of the workshop. Robert and Helen come together. Robert tells part of the story he’s learned from Helen; Helen tells the rest. Her family home burned--her mom, dad, and brother died in the fire. Helen has scars and that’s why she resisted anyone seeing her. She’d run to the psychiatrist--but was able to work out the pain she was feeling. Everyone is stunned by these revelations.\n\nA. ends up knowing she’ll never be a model, but knowing she gained a great deal.\n\n30. Anastasia Has the Answers Lois Lowry. Boston: Houghlin Mifflin Co., l986.\n\nBook opens with Anastasia trying to decide if she wants to fly to Los Angeles for her aunt's funeral. (Aunt Rose is Uncle George's --Myron K.'s brother--wife.) She has died from salmonella poisoning. A. loves to envision it as Sal Monella--since in this book she's thinking of becoming a journalist. Each chapter ends with a brief sample of a newspaper lead.\n\nWe find out about Mr. Rafferty, A.'s English teacher--who eventually wants her to memorize \"O World I Cannot Hold Thee Close Enough\" by Edna St. Vincent Millay to present when a group of international educators come. Mr. R. wants A. to do lots of gestures--fling out her arms for example. Anastasia also writes/thinks lots about Ms. Willoughby, her physical ed teacher. Actually A. has a \"crush\" on Ms. W. and is worried about that until Mrs. K. tells A. that she too, once had a crush on a teacher. There's nothing strange about that.\n\nA.'s big challenge is that she can't do the rope climb in PE and is continually embarrassed. She even tries, while her parents are away to get the rope hung in the garage so she can practice at home. She can't manage that alone, but when her parents return, and Uncle George comes with them to stay for a while, they do get the rope hung. When it comes down to the point that A. will have to simply stand and blow the whistle in the class when the international educators are present, A.'s mom helps her practice, and on the night right before the inter. eds. arrive, A. is able to do it. She decides she may surprise everyone in class. In some ways she doesn't want to pull a surprise on Ms. W., but when A. doesn't get a chance to do her poem in class, she does decide to do the climb. She gives a brief speech about how she's worked at being able to climb, then does get to the top. When she's so elated about being at the top, she starts into the Edna St. Vincent Millay poem and does feel like flinging her arms. Thus she falls to the floor and gets a major concussion. But as she eventually wakes up in the hospital---everyone from her class, to her family to Ms. W. is there at the hospital.\n\nOne other aspect of the book is that A. wishes they could read Gone with the Wind for English; when U. George arrives, he looks just like Rhett Butler.\n\n31. All About Sam : Lois Lowry. Illus. by Diane deGroat. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, l988.\n\nWritten from the viewpoint of baby Sam--from birth and coming home; to the \"Terrible Twos.\" Sam keeps thinking this is a group of people. Or when he is asked by his mom about being \"trained\" -- he thinks of trains and engines and likes that--he doesn't like the notion of training pants. He flushes A.'s fish Frank down the toilet after Mom has explained that what's flushed down the toilet goes out into the water and evaporates and comes back in the form of rain. Sam does realize that he has to put things in the toilet (after he's been told so by his mom) that like to be wet--that's why he thinks the goldfish will work. There is also an incident related to moving--Sam doesn't get the concept of moving, as in moving away from one house to another house. He is not happy with his new room as they first move--it's too large and empty. But when they unpack the box with his trucks, and he, Mom, A. and Dad, plus the movers eventually, all start playing with the trucks and \"driving\" them to his new room, he is really happy.\n\nSam really wants a pet--he can't have a dog or cat because Mr. K. is allergic. Sam finds a worm and thinks this might work for a pet. At the library, he realizes that there's going to be a pet show and he wants to bring his. S's named the worm, \"King Worm.\" Sam displays his \"pet\" but after the judges give him the award for \"the most invisible pet,\" Sam realizes his worm is gone. Sam is worried that the pet has been taken for bait. In fact, the worm is found back at the K. home--Sam says the worm should have been awarded the \"fastest slitherer\" award.\n\nSam has a series of experiences at Nursery School--Nicky is a girl who bites, Adam is a boy who always does imaginary dropping of bombs and firing of guns, and Sam can never think of things to bring for Show-and-Tell. One time Sam took his dad's pipe and a lighter. He tried to say it was his pipe, not his dad's. His teacher turns this into a lesson about safety and health--not good to smoke and be careful playing with matches.\n\nSam wants his curls to be gone; wants a punk haircut like Adam. He goes into the bathroom and begins to play with his dad's shaving cream; then he uses his mom's perfume; and finally he finds a scissors and tries cutting his own hair--creating a disaster. He has to go to the barber and see if he can get his cut fixed.\n\nAnother funny experience is Sam's wanting to be a he-man. He's told by A. to pump iron, so he finds his mom's iron and then the pumps she has in a shoe box and attempts to figure out how to \"pump iron.\" He also eats spinach, thinking that he can be strong like Popeye--but his dad helps him with that reality.\n\nIn the final chapter he learns from A. about making a secret code; and from his dear neighbor, Gertrude Stein (Sam says, Gertrudestein--all one word) about Morse Code. He and she use flashlights to send each other messages at night. This is the first time Sam says he doesn't need his night light.\n\n32. Atta boy Sam : Lois Lowry. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., l992 (This is at least the 2nd in the Sam series)\n\nFocuses on 3 yr. old or close to 4, Sam. They are preparing for Katherine K.’s 38th b’day. She mentions that things homemade mean the most to her. So each family member attempts to make something. A. writes a poem, Myron tries to do a painting. Sam finds out that his mom can no longer get her favorite perfume. He thinks of making perfume and each time his mom mentions something that is her favorite smell, he attempts to get some of that object, putting whatever in a ziplock bag and collects all these in a big jar--from the scent of babies, S. takes tissues from diaper changes and spit-ups; from Dad’s pipe smell, S. takes one of the pipes and puts it in the jar; of Sam’s hair--he clips a lock while at nursery school (gets reported for cutting hair and is put in the “time out” place); for fresh bread which Gertrude Stein next door is making, S. takes some yeast--when that is put with everything else, the jar begins to “burp” and gurgle and of course, smell. S. also puts in water from a field trip to the aquarium (for the ocean scent) and vanilla flavoring. Meanwhile he worries more and more as the “brew” ferments. To make himself feel better he gets a kitten, even though he knows his dad is allergic to kittens. (A neighbor has been giving the kittens away free.\n\nSam has not allowed anyone in his room, but as Mrs. K’s b’day approaches, M. and A. do come into the room so all can discuss how their presents aren’t right. The perfume mixture blows up while Dad, A. and S. are in the room. but in the end they all laugh and Mrs. K. is pleased with their efforts.\n\n33. Autumn Street : Lois Lowry. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., l980.\n\nThe main character (story is told from her viewpoint) is Elizabeth Jane Lorensi, who is 4 when WWII begins. Everything she hears has some connection to “the War.” (e.g. whenever she can’t do something it’s related to “the War.”) She and her family live in NY but have to move to their grandfather’s (maternal one) in PA when her father goes to war. While still in NY, there is a description of Elizabeth painting at nursery school--she has far more sense of perspective about trees and the horizon--it’s noticed by someone from a university school of education.\n\nJessica Kathryn is 3 yrs. older than Elizabeth; neither feels very “at home” with their grandmother. It turns out that this woman married Grandfather after his first wife died in childbirth with E. and J.’s mom. Grandmother here seems very stern, only calls the girls by their complete first and second names. Grandfather is a banker, and a dignified man in the community. They attend the Episcopalian Church. The others in the household include Tatie (African Am. who is a cook and has been with the family since the girls’ mom was a child) and her grandson, Charles, who Elizabeth befriends and has so much fun with; Lillian Chestnut does the laundry. There are also 3 great aunts, sisters to the girls’ mom’s mother. These aunts are Caroline, Florence and Philippa.\n\nGordon, a new baby, arrives while Father is away at War. He is a frettish baby at first. Noah and Nathaniel Hoffman, twins, are neighbors of E.’s grandparents. Noah is a very cruel young boy--strangles a cat and E. and Charles see this. Once E. wishes something would happen to Noah. He gets ill, develops pneumonia and dies. Mr. Hoffman, of German descent, disappeared when the war began. One day E. and Charles sneak into the Hoffman house, looking for any clues that Hugo (Mr. H.) was a spy for the Germans. Nathaniel is a very kind and good boy. Another character is a man named Ferdie Gossett, who is possibly retarded; occasionally he’s around the school which E. and J. attend. E. is six at this point; she can’t understand though why Charles (who is Afro-Am) can’t attend the same school she can.\n\nOne day Grandfather has a stroke; again E. doesn’t quite comprehend what a stroke is--she associates this with the stroke of the clock. She also has a cousin David who she always enjoyed. She knows he is in a hospital in CA; eventually she’s told David was “shell-shocked” and she can’t quite comprehend what that means. A great quote from the novel sums up these experiences: “Everyone I loved was threatened by things I didn’t understand” (105).\n\nAt her school, Miss MacDonald is her teacher; and a girl named Louise Donohue friend. Her family is “real”--there’s no one like Grandmother who is so stern and proper. The Donohues aren’t concerned about getting messy or about “protecting” things so nothing gets broken. At the Donohues, E. first learns her grandfather’s real name (all she had ever called him is Grandfather)--Benjamin Lloyd Creighton. She also learns that Louise’s mom knows E.’s mom, Celia. (p. 139 has a description of the ideas about the family being neat, placed carefully in a separate file, not interacting which anyone else.)\n\nOne day while E. and her mom are over at the great aunts, E. finds out from her mom that Aunt Philippa had wanted to marry Grandfather. Instead Grandfather married “that stiff unbending woman.”\n\nA major tragic event of the book happens when E. and Charles go out to try E.’s new sled on a hill where others of this “non-black neighborhood” are out sledding. Several older (6th gr.) boys taunt and hurt Charles, telling he isn’t allowed there. Charles and E. (even though it’s very cold) go off to the woods (Charles has never been allowed in these woods before. E. hasn’t been feeling that well and she tells C. they must go home. She feels more and more sick as she goes back; he stays in the woods. Next day after Tatie and others have been searching for Charles, he is found dead. E. goes through a time of intense fever, lack of consciousness--she fights for life and Tatie is worried about “losing this one too.”\n\nIn a very powerful ending, E. is told about how Grandmother risked going to the all black church which Tatie attends for the funeral of Charles and to support Tatie. Only in March is E. well; her father returns from war; he’s lost his leg.\n\nThis book is really powerful, uses wonderful language and description.\n\n34.Number the Stars : Lois Lowry Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., l989\n\nAnnemarie Johansen is 10 yrs. old and the story is told from her viewpoint. She and her family live in Copenhaugen; Kristi is her younger sister. Lise, their l8 yr. old sister was killed in an accident 2 weeks before the marriage. Peter Nielsen, her fiance, is active in the resistance movement. (Only at the end of the novel do we learn that Lise was killed in the resistance) During the 3 yr. occupation, electricity has been rationed as well as sugar and other foods, no one has enough to eat and there is a nightly curfew after 8:00 p.m. No leather is available so shoes are made of fish skin (fish scales). Eventually the Nazis close all businesses that are owned/run by Jews. Using the reference made early on about the King of Denmark and who his bodyguards are, “All of Denmark is his bodyguard” Annemarie says all of Denmark must be bodyguards for the Jews.\n\nAnnemarie’s friend Ellen Rosen is from a Jewish family; one day the Rosen family comes and leaves Ellen; the Rosens are led into hiding by Peter. The Nazis come to the Johansen home; they question why A. is blond and this “other daughter” --that’s what they’ve been told about Ellen Rosen, is dark. Fortunately the J’s have pictures of Lise when she was little--Lise was dark so they claim Ellen is Lise, and the Nazis go away. Next day Ellen is sent to Inge’s (Mrs. J’s) brother Henrik’s. He’s a fisherman and out in the country. Ellen’s parents also arrive at U. Henrik’s and they, plus Ellen, are eventually helped to escape to a boat that Henrik is running which will take them to safety in Sweden. On this night a coffin arrives at U. Henrik’s--to explain why people (others Peter has assisted) have gathered at the house, the coffin is used to be the site of a wake. Again the Nazis arrive and question, but fortunately they don’t open the coffin when told the person died of typhus.\n\nTitle of the book comes from a line of Ps. 147 (?) “he who numbers the stars one by one.”\n\nThe night everyone is trying to get to the boat, Peter has sent a packet to Henrik; it’s in Mr. R.’s pocket, but falls out. That is only discovered when A.’s mom falls as she is returning from having gone with them to the boat. Mrs. J. sprains her ankle so Annemarie must get the packet to Henrik. A. takes a basket (like Little Red Riding Hood)--her mother warns her, if you are stopped by anyone, pretend you do not understand. A. is stopped by soldiers and amazingly though they search the basket, they do not get the packet. In the handkerchief in the packet is a special chemical to confuse the dogs’ scent (the search dogs which Nazis are taking about ships. The Rosens and others were hiding below deck when their boat was searched.\n\nThe war ends when A. is 12; Peter has been caught and executed. The Danish resistance has been highly successful in assisting most of Danish Jews to escape.\n\n35. A Summer to Die Lois Lowry; illus. by Jenni Oliver; Boston: Houghton Mifflin, l977\n\nTold from the viewpoint of Meg, the younger sister and less beautiful (especially from Meg's perspective) daughter of the Chalmers. Molly, the older, is the popular one, prettier one, has just become a cheerleader. Mr. Chalmers has been given a yr. from the university, to finish a book--he's an English prof. The family rents a small house in the country so Mr. C. can have the quiet to write. They move right before Thanksgiving.\n\nThe owner of the house is Will Banks, 70, a kind and creative man who befriends the Chalmers, especially Meg. Will quotes poetry--one great one, Hopkins \"Spring and Fall\" telling Meg, \"It's Margaret you mourn for.\" and at the time Meg doesn't understand the line. Meg can do photography and she eventually gets a darkroom--her father builds it when he is \"stuck\" on the writing--and is able to teach (as well as learn with) Will Banks.\n\nIn the midst of all this, Molly gets ill (starts with nose bleeds; but one night as Meg awakes knowing \"something is wrong,\" Molly is in a pool of blood. What she develops is a kind of leukemia, but for a long time, Meg doesn't realize how ill Molly is. Her parents don't tell her since there is some hope that medication will work.\n\nMeanwhile a family, Ben Brady and Maria Abbott, move into Will's other house. Will, by the way, has just one living relative, a nephew who is trying to prove Will looney and get the property from his uncle. Ben and Maria become good friends of Meg's and also Molly's. Molly does lots of sewing for the baby and keeps insisting everything is to be \"right\" for the baby.\n\nBen and Maria ask Meg to photograph the birth. Meg learns lots about birthing; eventually Meg also learns that Molly is dying. Meg cannot bring herself to go to the hospital (her parents say the hospital won't let her in, but really Meg is scared) until the birth of Ben and Maria's son, and then she wants to be the one to tell Molly. By this point Molly is close to death and does die two weeks later.\n\nHuntington, the nephew, turns up soon after Molly's death. He wants to force his uncle to get rid of the \"hippie\" family--Ben and Maria. It turns out that Huntington is actually the junior partner in Ben's dad's law firm.\n\nThe book handles a family's dealing with death; offers some great images of friendships.\n\n36. Wolf by the Ears Ann Rinaldi. New York: Scholastic, l99l.\n\nTitle is based on this quote by Jefferson\n\n\"...Gradually, with due sacrifices, a general emancipation\n\nand expatriation could be effected. But, as it is, we have\n\nthe wolf by the ears, and we can neither hold him, nor\n\nsafely let him go. Justice is in one scale, and self-preservation\n\nthe other.\"\n\nTold from the perspective of Harriet Hemings, probable daughter of Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings, African Am. woman. Harriet, Beverly (a male), Madison and Eston are the Heming children still living at Monticello; Thomas has already left--\"passing as white\" into a different world. T. left when H. was 10; he apparently bore such resemblance to Jefferson that when anyone came to the plantation, he was sent elsewhere. Harriet's mother has been the keeper of Jefferson's wardrobe and the only one allowed, most times, into the inner sanctum of the Master's rooms. Harriet always feels she must call Jefferson, \"the Master\"--yet that sets a slave relationship and all of the Blacks at Monticello (definitely the Hemings) are given papers saying they are free; these papers are accessible when the Hemings reach age 21.\n\nHarriet is allowed to get some tutoring from Mr. Oglesby who also tutors H.'s brothers. Burwell is like a butler; Mammy Ursula is a cook, confidante for H.\n\nAs the novel opens H. is recalling the day she received a journal from Jefferson and was told to write in it often. She was the one who frequently made comments about aspects of the farm that Jefferson records in his farm book. (these items are brought in throughout the novel).\n\nTwo of Sally's children, a \"first Harriet\" and Edy have died in infancy or as with Harriet 1, at age 2 of pleurisy. Harriet (the second one and the narrator in the book who is red-headed, almost white, has freckles) is l8 as she begins writing in the journal in April l820--she'll be l9. H. speaks of the pain she sees in Jefferson; \"I'm watching him. Me. Harriet. I watch the great Thomas Jefferson al the time when he doesn't know it. And I see things others don't see. I can do that with people. Especially with white folk. They don't know how to keep what's in their hearts from showing in their eyes like we do\" (12).\n\nH. records how others want her to leave when she is 21; she doesn't want to leave; she believe Jefferson doesn't want her to leave either. Her mother particularly is encouraging her to go. Thomas Mann Randolph, son-in-law of J. wants H. to \"go for freedom.\" Though he is considered \"crazy\" by many, he has the wisest words/plans for H.; Randolph comprehends the reality of being an illegitimate child of someone like T. Jefferson. Randolph also calls to mind the children H. may have some day. H. has not thought of children; she simply believes in her protected state. Yet, as Randolph reminds her, J. will be dead by the time H. has children. Randolph is currently the governor of Virginia and wants to free all the slaves in VA. He sadly realizes though, that too many in VA, including his father-in-law, J., are not strong enough on the desire to free slaves.\n\nThurston, 25, is a black man, gardener. He'd like to marry H. She realizes she is not ready to marry; Thurston tries to help her see that she will be married off whether J. would want that or not. Isabel's Davie is a black man who \"wants\" H.--H. would not like that.\n\nIncident with Beverly flying a hot air balloon to prove to J. how smart B. is--B. wants to be allowed to go to the U. of VA, which J. is founding. In this scene, which H. overhears, J. tries, though painfully, to show Beverly why B. would not be allowed at the U. and how problematic is could be for J. Beverly is horribly angry; ever after basically rejects J.\n\nMammy U. reveals to H. that H's mom has been making a wardrobe of clothing for H. to wear when she leaves the plantation. H. is upset--she finds a way to sneak up to her M.s room ( of course this means she must go through J.'s room and she is discovered there by him). J. and H. have a wonderful conversation--though he tells her she must never reveal she wasn't punished by him for being in the room--it would diminish his authority.\n\nCharles Bankhead, alcoholic is the husband of Anne, grand daughter of J., daughter of Thomas Randolph. He has been known to beat Anne; also he tried to stab his brother-in-law. One day he is allowed back in the J. household. This same day Thurston tells H. that Mr. Bacon, overseer of the slaves, will marry off H. someday soon. H. is distracted and ends up in the dining room where drunk Bankhead is; Bankhead is attempting to rape H. when first Thurston, then Burwell and Randolph intervene. H. is sick for a number of days; now realizes she must go. She sees R. again, who tells her if she'd like to go, he'll arrange for his wife to tutor H. so she learns how to live in white society. He also confronts H. with the idea of \"passing\"--a good portion of the rest of the book deals with how H. struggles with the notion of passing/possibly leaving her culture; how her brothers, particularly Beverly react. Randolph also tells H. about a man who would marry her or at least become betrothed (this process would help H. leave). H. does meet the man, falls in love with him, is eager to marry despite all that implies. The man, Thad Sandridge, tells H. that she must go under another name in white society--Elizabeth Lackland. He also tells her she can be a teacher in his sister's orphanage. Thad lives in Washington D.C.\n\nAs H. is preparing to leave, and she has now shared this with J. who seems saddened, yet tolerant, H. finds out that Beverly is leaving--he won't tell J. before he goes. Also only after their farewell mtg. does H. learn from her mother that B. was also \"passing.\" End chapter is very powerful--final scene with J.\n\nKey to this work, the alienation of non-recognition. This novel could be a great one to \"pair with a classic\"--specifically Absalom, Absalom\n\n37. The Last Silk Dress: Ann Rinaldi. New York: Holiday House, l988.\n\nThe novel is set from l861-l862, in Richmond primarily. It is based on research about silk balloons used by the Union for reconnaissance during the Civil War. The Confederates eventually wanted one; the novel focuses on Susan Dobson Chilmark, who works to gather the silk dresses (even having to work her brother Lucien's brothel for dresses--with his help, of course) and the other Confederate women who help sew it together.\n\nSusan's father, Hugh, is continually involved in the war effect--a machinist, doing munitions work. Lucien, has run from home--he's Susan's older brother and she and he are the only living children. Their mother, Charlotte, is bitter; physically and verbally abusive of Susan. Only far into the novel do you realize Susan's mother had an affair with \"a Yankee\" to avenge her husband Hugh's indiscretions with the black daughter of Rhody, the housekeeper. Lucien had also loved the young black woman. He'd left home when his father wouldn't protect the young woman. Lucien is an abolitionist.\n\nLucien is also wealthy from being a food smuggler, running a gambling casino, and the brothels. The Confederate women of Richmond and surely his mother, refuse to speak of him. His mother is constantly worried about her reputation because of Lucien's actions.\n\n38. Broken Days by Ann Rinaldi\n\nThe novel is set in l811-1812; it's another of the Quilt Trilogy books and highlights the growing of the mills in Lowell, MA. Its primary focus is on the Chelmsford family again; particularly it centers on those who have been part of the Shawnee. Tecumseh is a caretaker of the young woman who eventually is sent to mother's family in Massachusetts. The protagonist is a young woman constantly struggling for the love and recognition of her grandfather. Aunt Hannah, single throughout most of the book, is the young protagonist's primary caretaker. Georgie is a woman considered an outcast because of her Native American connections. Worthwhile for Native Am. studies.\n\n39. A Break with Charity by Ann Rinaldi\n\nSusanna English is the protagonist; she is one of the few who know the real beginnings of the group who began the witchcraft hysteria in Salem in the late 1600's. Her parents are eventually implicated mainly because they are not entirely locked into Puritanism--Philip English is Episcopalian. Susanna's brother has been away at sea and that leads her to Tituba, the slave employed by Rev. Parris. When Susanna goes to Tituba, she learns of the initial movement, but can't reveal this as she believes she must protect her family. She falls in love with the son of the infamous Judge Hathorne (ancester of Nathaniel)--this son eventually defies his father, the judge, because the son can't condone the tragedies of the witchcraft hysteria. This would be a great companion text to The Scarlet Letter and The Crucible.\n\n40. The Friendship : by Mildred Taylor, Pictures by Max Ginsberg\n\nLogan children: Stacey (he's 12 in this book), Cassie (is 9, story told from her perspective, her voice), Christopher-John (age 7), Little Man (age 6 ) are outside Wallace Store, where their parents have urged them not to go. John Wallace is the storeowner, Dewberry, Thurston, and Kaleb are the sons. The children are on an errand for Aunt Callie Jackson--they are to get her some headache powders. It's their first time in the store. Christopher-John is eyeing the candy; Little Man is looking at belt buckles, cuff links, etc.\n\nDewberry W., when he finally decides to wait on the children, yells out at Little Man to \"get them filthy hands off-a-there.\" Little Man, who is always worried about being clean/tidy is so frightened; he worries about taking these words of the white man literally. L.M. is further offended when he tries to explain his hands are clean; the Wallace sons are meaning the black skin...\n\nThe children are just glad to get out of the store, when Mr. Tom Bee, an old black man comes along--he used to be a sharecropper, is now basically out fishing. He wants to get some sardines from the store. He does not call John Wallace, the store owner, Mr. J. W., because long ago Tom had saved John's life several times and had been told by John, that no matter what, John was simply \"John\" to Tom. Now the sons are infuriated that a black man addresses their dad without saying sir or mister, and uses their dad's first name only.\n\nJeremy Simms, a white boy, who consistently befriends the black children, is at the store--his entire family, but particularly his dad and older brothers, is extremely prejudiced. Jeremy wants to go fishing with the Logan children. They are suspect, worried about being with a white child.\n\nThe tensions rise as Tom Bee keeps asking for John; Dewberry is horribly cruel to Tom. The children learn the story of the friendship only after Tom Bee is basically thrown out. John does try to warn Tom about calling him John, without the Mr. Tom does get the candy for the children.\n\nOn the return from A. Callie Jackson's place, Tom says he wants to get tobacco. More whites have come into the store, and this time when Tom uses John, John throws him out; as Tom is walking out of the store asserting he will use John, John shoots him in the leg. Tom crawls away calling out John's name. The children witness the shooting--this is how the book ends.\n\n41. The Gold Cadillac by Mildred Taylor. Illustrated by Michael Hays\n\nIn this novel there are two girls, Eloise is one--the narrator, and Wilma. Their dad buys a gold Cadillac and delights all the neighbors, relatives, etc. in their neighborhood in Toledo. Their mother isn't happy that her husband has spent the money on this car; she wants to be buying a house. Wilbert, father's name; Dee, mother's name. The next thing Wilbert says he will do is drive the car to Mississippi to see his relatives; everyone cautions against this--worried about Southern whites and their hatred of \"seemingly uppidity” North blacks.\n\nIt turns out that Mother and the girls go with their dad; several other families do too. Elois sees in their travels south, all the \"white only\" \"colored only\" signs. She doesn't understand. In Mississippi at the state line, her dad is stopped by a policeman.

Wilbert tells 'Lois that they are more together as a family now.\n\n42. Mississippi Bridge by Mildred Taylor; pictures by Max Ginsburg; New York: Dial Books, l990\n\nTold from the viewpoint of Jeremy Simms, age 10, a white boy who befriends (at least tries to) the Logan family, especially Stacey. There had been lots of rain so creeks were swollen; men can't do much farm work, the Charley Simms (father), RW, Melvin--Jeremy's older brothers--hang around in Wallace's store, also the bus stop. Rudine Johnson, black and nearly the same age as R.W. and Melvin, and her mother come into the store; Rudine is admiring a summer-sky-blue hat, wishing she could try it on. Mr. Wallace will not let a Negro try on a hat that she may or may not buy.\n\nThen Mrs. Hattie McElroy and her granddaughter, Grace-Anne (about 4) come in. They are white; they are going to take the bus to visit Grace-Anne's mom. Miz Hattie doesn't want to drive; doesn’t trust her Negro servant, Uncle Moses, since he can't see well anymore.\n\nJosias Williams, young Negro man about mid-twenties comes in. He is also planning on taking the bus to go to \"the Natchez Trace.\" He is hoping to get a lumbering job there. When Mr. Simms confronts Josias about where he is going, J. tells about getting the job. Simms starts \"verbally attacking\" Josias, saying a \"Nigger\" shouldn't be working for cash when so many white men are out of work. (It's the Depression). Josias actually lies about the job possibility so he won't be beaten by the white men; he is humiliated, then after leaving the store, is angry.\n\nNext Stacey (10), Cassie (7), Christopher-John (5) and Little Man (less than 4), arrive with their grandmother, Big Ma (Caroline). Jeremy reveals how the Logans are suspect since they own land; these Negroes actually have more than some white people--again that is a problem. Big Ma is trying to go to help her sister who is ill.\n\nAs the bus arrives, the white woman and her granddaughter are treated graciously. The driver steps back while the Negroes try to find places. Cassie tells her grandmother about a seat; it's in the front section--reserved for whites. Jeremy runs after the Logan children as they head back in the rain. The bridge they need to cross is hard to find/see in the fog. The bridge is old, rickety; it's over the Rosa Lee creek which is rising. The children are looking through the weak planks at the rising water, but eventually they go on with the errand of taking milk to Miz Georgia.\n\nMeanwhile back at the store there are problems. Henry Amos and his wife and several children, who are all whites, have arrived and want to take the bus so now there is not room for several of the Negroes. Big Ma and several others get off; Josias doesn't want to. He is confronted by the bus driver--eventually J. is pushed off the bus into the mud. Jeremy tries to console Josias, and Jeremy is yelled at by his dad. The bus races on, to the bridge; Jeremy is running after, calling Josias. They watch as the bus swerves, hits the rail and careens over the side into the water. Jeremy is sent back to the store to get help. All the whites who were on the bus--drown.\n\n43. The Well by Mildred D. Taylor; New York: Dial Books, l995\n\nThis story is told by David Logan (age 10 at the point of the story), the father of the Logan children of the other Taylor novels. In this story there has been drought; the only place with drinking water is the Logan's who have a well. The Logans share the water with everyone, even white people. The Simms' come for water--they are mean and racist and cruel to the Logans. (Simmes live less than a mile away on tenant-farm land; the Logans have their own land. Charlie Simms and his brother Ed-Rose come for water; they verbally incite Hammer Logan, David's brother; Hammer (13) doesn't like to \"give in\" to the Whites. Ma Rachel, David's grandmother, is starting to become senile; she's also lived through abuse as her mother was a slave. Ma R. doesn't like it that white folks can come and get water. Cousin Halton, Aunt Callie's son, is around working; he tries to keep David and Hammer out of trouble. (Pa, Mitchell and Kevin are away lumbering on the Natchez Trace.)\n\nWhen Hammer and David take the cattle to water, they again are confronted by the Simmes' boys and Dewberry Wallace. Later the same week, Hammer and David discover Charlie Simms, his wagon hung over a ditch, one wheel off. David offers to help; Hammer is angered by Charlie's words about \"niggers\"--David is walking with a crutch from a broken leg. David tries lifting the wagon so C. can get the wheel on. C. wastes time and David has to drop the wagon. C. comes and knocks David down; Hammer attacks C. C falls back and hits a rock; the Logan boys run, worried that C. is dead. Halton comes along --the boys tell what happened; Halton rushes them away from the scene to hide. Joe Callister and Mr. Tom Bee, both Negroes, come along --they assume Ma that Charlie isn't dead.\n\nStill the sheriff (Peterson Rankins) comes; Ma make molasses bread, which she knows the sheriff likes. Sheriff does agree to go to Old Man McCalister Simms to see if he can persuade him to not press charges. But the Simmes come; they expect the sheriff to whip both Logan boys. Eventually Ma does the whipping; the boys have to be humiliated in front of the whites; also Ma Rachel is upset and has to be taken to Aunt Callie's. Plus the boys have to work for the Simmes all summer. Pa eventually comes home; he makes the boys carry through on their work for the Simmes.\n\nThe Simmes boys play a trick on Joe Callister, who rings the bell at the Negro church. Pa, David and Hammer, help Joe handle it. The Simmes are angry; evenutally they get coon, skunk, and several animals; chop up the animals, and throw them in the well; that poisons the water. At first the Simmes lie about the smell/poisoning, but they are found out. Their father makes them go down into the well and pull out the smelly, dead animals. They are humiliated in front of the Negroes present.\n\n44. The Bumblebee Flies Anyway by Robert Cormier\n\nAbout young adults in a medical experiment \"complex.\" The main character doesn't know he is also terminal; he has had some memory experiments.

Both characters are drawn to each other in heavily ironic situations. Both are seeking tenderness... another powerful text.\n\n46. The Midwife's Apprentice by Karen Cushman\n\nAnother great match with Medieval lit. Young, homeless woman who knows no other name than Brat or Beetle, is frequently tormented by young men, slightly better off than she, is taken to be a midwife's apprentice. The young woman eventually renames herself Alyce. She learns much about midwifery, but can't manage to help in a birth that is particularly difficult. Eventually leaves the midwife and goes to work at an inn; she learns to read from a boarder at the inn who is working on an encyclopedia. Eventually she realizes she can and should go back to the midwife.\n\n47. The Chocolate War by Robert Cormier\n\nAbout Trinity HS run by an order of Brothers; Brother Leon is acting headmaster and a despicable man; the \"Vigils\" a student group not totally unlike a college frat, really \"runs\" the place. Archie Costello is the assigner; devises schemes for underclassman to fulfill; there is a black box and if Archie draws a black marble he has to do the assignment--neither never happens.\n\nArchie is asked by Brother Leon to help, put the support of the Vigils behind the annual chocolate sale. Jerry Renault, a freshman who has just lost his mother to cancer in the spring and who lives with a father who can't bear the loss of his wife, first is ordered not to sell; then Jerry refuses on his own. The motto he has on a poster in his locker is \"Do I dare disturb the universe?\"--T.S.Eliot lines from \"The Wasteland.\" Jerry is eventually beaten terrible in a fight arranged by the Vigils and against Emile Janza, a cruel, amoral young man.\n\nRoland Goubert--called the Goober, is Jerry's only friend, yet he's unable to save Jerry; feels like he betrayed Jerry.\n\nObie and Carter are two other officers of the Vigils--though Costello wields the power. David Caroni--caught in the web of Brother Leon's sadism, eventually will try to kill Brother Leon and David commits suicide (in the book Beyond the Chocolate War) Goober's assignment is to take all the screws out of desks and chairs and tables in Rm. 19--Brother Eugene who teaches there has a breakdown the day that the room falls apart. In B. t. C.W. the students learns of the death of Brother Eugene, who leaves the school immediately after the incident. Goober always feels guilty.\n\n48. Beyond the Chocolate War by Robert Cormier\n\nRay Bannister is the new student in this book; he knows how to do magic; has an act which uses of guillotine--this will become a way Obie tries to get Archie. Also Obie learns about sleight of hand tricks (actually learns how Archie avoided the black marble in all his years as \"assigner.\"). Ray Bannister finds it hard to have moved and hard to adjust to being part of Trinity. He doesn't feel like he has any friends until Obie comes along.\n\nObie is in love with Laura Gundarson; he draws closer to her and seemingly away from the Vigils; thus Costello gets a sophomore, Bunting, to be a \"trainee.\" Bunting has two buddies, Harley and Cornacchio who will eventually join with him in attempting physical violence, also a rape, of Laura while Obie is pinned to the ground and helpless.\n\nCarter, president of the Vigils, though Archie is the real power figure, is really upset at A.'s latest idea, of having everyone but one student skip classes on a day the Bishop is scheduled to visit. He writes a note to warn Brother Leon--anonymous, but A. finds out eventually. A. sees Carter as a traitor; Carter tries to get Obie to help him. Carter is particularly disgruntled since boxing has been banned from the school since the terrible incident arranged by A. in which Jerry Renault had been severely beaten.\n\nJerry comes back to the town; he'd been in Canada with an aunt and uncle; Jerry had often gone into a church--is seemingly being led to a vocation. Goober eventually goes to see Jerry; tries to tell Jerry that he feels guilty about not being able to protect or save Jerry. Emile Janza is also still in the picture. Janza finds out Jerry is back and wants to beat him again. In this incident Jerry \"wins\" in effect, by not fighting back. It's another major beating however.\n\nBunting plans the assault on Laura without A.'s direction--A. is a person of psychological attacks, not physical, so A. is particularly upset by Bunting's acts--refuses to provide an alibi.\n\nDavid Caroni is in this novel--stories of his anger, urge at avenge Brother Leon. David eventually commits suicide.\n\nThe Bishop had changed his mind about coming so that Vigils' plan failed, but the next activity is for Fair Day--when there are skits etc. Obie plans here to have Bannister do the guillotine thing; Obie is planning for it to be the death of Archie; the plan fails; A. confronts O. saying that O. and Carter are as bad as A. since these two have never had the guts to stop A.\n\n49.

Mr. Levine is an excellent woodcarver; Henry is fascinated as he watches Mr. L. in his work constructing a miniature of the village of his homeland, destroyed by the Nazis.

Mr. H. wants Henry to go and destroy the village. Henry is horrified; Mr. H. uses the blackmail of saying he'll provide money for the monument for Eddie's grave (a bat and baseball design that is Henry's idea); Mr. H. also says he'll fire Henry and make sure no one else hires Henry; Hairston will also influence the employer of H's mom, to help or hinder;\n\nHenry is caught in the fear of what will happen either way--he also does go to the Center, but when he is in the act of raising the mallet above the village, inches away from destroying it, a rat runs through and breaks up many of the figures. Henry leaves, and does go back to report to Mr. H. Mr. H. is happy about the destruction and wants to \"reward\" H. as Mr. H. had promised.

Gypsy only realizes that her father, Amos, was actually in love with W. mom first, and then feels so sorry for him. Also Amos, who loved Gypsy dearly, died suddenly after being seriously disfigured in a fire (he was a volunteer fireman) –he actually shot himself and Gypsy saw him through the bedroom window. She has blocked that memory; though she keeps having nightmares of some hurt animal. Her mom, Love, has remarried to Porter Dotson—G. refuses to accept Porter; she sees him as “taking her dad’s place.”\n\nThe book deals with “what essential is invisible to the eye” from the ugliness of Belle (or her lesser beauty) which plagued her, to Woodrow’s severe cross-eyed situation, to Gypsy’s dislike of her long hair—which though beautiful, she sees as a bother and something which hides her richer qualities; to Amos’ inability to live after he’s been disfigured, to Blind Benny, who was born with some disfigurement and no eyes.\n\nAppalachian setting/context\n\n65.

The conditions are extraordinarily demanding—walking in rain, not always getting something to eat; not always able to find shelter at night. Dicey is going on an address she has for Aunt Cilla in Bridgeport—Cilla is the children’s mom’s aunt.\n\nThe father of the family deserted when the two oldest could barely remember him; the mom has become desperate after losing her job and having to face questions about Maybeth—teachers think M. is retarded since M. is very quiet and non-communicative in school.

He is also the man, who on a summer night when he is worried about his own daughter who has vanished from college, has a sexual union with Anne (who has always loved Ben, though she has never told him, and he is too involved with him own marriage and family). Anne becomes pregnant; and though she does have to tell Chip that she is pregnant, she does not reveal the father’s name. Much of the novel explores Chip’s feelings of embarrassment that his mom at 35 would “get pregnant,” his anger that she will have the child, his own feelings of abandonment (no longer having the sole attention of his mom), his struggles with intimacy in relationships with girls—especially his girlfriend, Jeannie Perlman. Jeannie has empathy with Chip’s mom; eventually Chip does too.\n\nChip is allowed to name the baby; he names her Dusky Anne. Chip is also eventually able to confront Ben in a phone conversation his mom will never know anything about. Chip is anxious after the birth of Dusky and his newly discovered love for her, not to have Ben invade their lives and try to take charge as Ben has and does.\n\nThe book ends rather abruptly (it would be a good one for students to finish the ending!! Or write their own!) with a phone call between Anne and Ben after Ben knows about the baby; it ends with Anne saying goodbye and not wanting Ben to come into their lives or to complicate his own family/marriage.\n\n68.The Secret of Sarah Revere : by Ann Rinaldi\n\nDeals with Sarah, one of the daughters of Paul Revere.

At the same time, the older brother, Juan, of Manolo’s best friend, is so eager to become a bull fighter; Juan, unlike Manolo, has the “aficinado” – the love of fighting but his father had been injured and “rejected” by Manolo’s father, so Juan does not believe he has any chance to become known. Manolo, eventually on the day he first “tests” his bullfighting skills, realizes he cannot kill the bull, and that he is not “made” for fighting. He wants to be a doctor; he learned that in helping the aging village doctor help an injured “clown” bullfighter.

Dicey’s Song by Cynthia Voigt\n\nThis is a sequel to Homecoming; Dicey is getting established in school which she does well enough in –except in Home Ec which she doesn’t like. She meets a girl named Mina, an African American who is bright and who appreciates Dicey for who she is.

James still keeps to himself a good deal and does well in school. Maybeth is a constant concern till James decides there are other ways to help Maybeth learn. Sammy is in fights; partially because his peers tease about Gram. Gram does well adjusting to having the children; actually formally adopts them.\n\nDicey gets a job working for Millie in the grocery store, even though Dicey is legally too young to have a job. Mr. Lingerle, a music teacher for Maybeth, befriends the family; even providing the money that will be used for the cremation of the children’s mom. Lisa, the mom, has been in an institution in a catatonic state every since she left the children in the parking lot of the shopping mall (as told in Homecoming). Gram shares much wisdom with Dicey; the entire family suffers in the death of their mom. A worthwhile read.\n\n73. A Solitary Blue by Cynthia Voigt\n\nJeff Peters is the main character—he’s 7 1/2 as the novel opens, is coming home from 2nd grade at a university school since his father is a history prof at this MA university, when he discovers a lengthy good by note from his mother. She is leaving them—more leaving her son than her husband. Melody (the mother) is considerably younger than her husband, is an activist in all kinds of issues, and really incompatible—you learn this only as the novel goes on. In the beginning Jeff is very unsure of how to relate to his father (and vice versa). Also, Jeff is a smart young child, but always afraid of doing what will annoy or disturb any adult.\n\nOne summer Jeff goes South, his mother is living near Charleston, with a rich, and typically Southern grandmother, called Gambo. There are also two maiden cousins living in this household. In Jeff’s first summer all seems to go well—Jeff feels particularly loved and valued. He is really “infatuated” with his mom, her beauty and her ability to make him feel loved. He has major slumps in school back in MA after this summer. When he goes back the second summer, Melody is almost never with him—she’s with Max, her boyfriend and a person not pleasant, nor easy to be with. Jeff goes off on his own a lot; especially out to islands and he buys a boat that he sails.\n\nAfter this disastrous summer, he is even more withdrawn. Eventually he comes much closer to his dad, Horace or “the Professor” and his dad’s friend, Brother Thomas. Jeff and his father eventually move out of Baltimore (out of the city area) to a remote place that they renovate – it’s in Crisfield (and at this point in the novel, Jeff starts to connect with the Tillerman family from Homecoming and Dicey’s Song. This interweaving of plots is neat—was a surprise for me.\n\n74. Nightjohn Gary Paulsen\n\nThe book is narrated by Sarny, a slave girl of nine as the book opens. It deals with the horrendous treatment of slaves owned by Waller. (He deserves no first name). John is purchased and comes to the plantation very beaten and scarred. Sarny reveals much about the plight of slaves who try to run away, those women who are used as “breeders,” the cruelty of dogs trained to track runaways slaves, the terrible whippings—the generally terrible conditions for food, shelter, etc.\n\nSarny wants to learn “letters” and she realizes that John will teach her in return for tobacco. John had escaped to the North but returned to slavery to help others read. At one point when she has learned the letters to make a word, Sarny is caught by Waller. He tries to get her to tell who taught her; Mammy takes the blame and is whipped as she is forced to have a harness around her neck and pull the master in a wagon. John admits he is the one who taught Sarny. For that John has two toes cut off. (the “rule” was an appendage was cut off for each time one was caught. A hard read—in seeing the terribly inhumanity of whites to blacks; very powerful.\n\n75. Jackaroo Cynthia Voigt\n\nHistorical fiction of England—about 11th cent. – Gwyn is an innkeeper’s daughter at the Ram’s Head Inn. She does not want to marry, unless she can marry someone she really loves. She is caught since at the Spring Fair her father (Da, as he is called) will have to announce her intention to marry or her intention never to marry. The novel explains much about life of the commoners in this period in England: the Doling Room is a place where women come to get food, doled out by the Steward, a servant of the Lords who are servants of the Earl, servant of the King. There is a good description of life in the inns and of the life of those who were innkeepers and the providers of food, housing, amenities for the travelers, particularly if these guests were nobility (as the two guests: a father and son, who are at this inn in the first part of the book). There are many highwaymen, robbers; there are the poor like Granny, who Gwyn helps; Hap, Granny’s (Nell) husband was a gamekeeper for the Earl, but Hap was injured and now has only the permission to set traps for game to feed him and his wife; 3 robbers have come and stolen the nanny goat that provided milk for Hap and his wife; these robbers also killed the couple’s dog—these are warnings to Gwyn of how bad the times are. It is also a reason why people are reviving their stories of Jackaroo: a hero who saves the innocent from hanging, who gets golden coins away from the greedy bailiff, who generally assists the poor. Jackaroo has a distinctive outfit: a short red cape, silk blue tunic with silver buckles, high boots of fine soft leather, and a silken mask that muffles his voice and conceals his chin.\n\nTad is Gywn’s younger brother and as she feels, he is really spoiled. His parents were so eager for a son though, and two sons died as infants/children before Tad. Every sickness is a worry. Blithe, a sister of Gwyn, is married to Guy. They lost their first child; it’s a period of high infant mortality. Gwyn’s sister Rose hopes to marry soon; though Burl loves her, he will not be able to marry her. Rose likes a man named Wes. Granda also lives with the family; he dies “old” at 58. As is the custom with the lower class then, his body is burned; cremation for the commoners, burial for the nobility. As Granda is dying he calls out for his other son, Win, who was a favorite. (Eventually it turns out that Win is to be hung; he’s been a highwayman/Jackaroo. G. discovers this when she is dressing as Jackaroo and tries to free Win. Burl asks for the body; that way Win can be given a decent burial.)\n\nGwyn’s mother sums up the hard life in her response to the comment of G. that is must be hard to lose a child, especially a first. Her mother says “Life is hard; It is only death that’ll be easy for us.” (57) Burl is a serving man who has been purchased for 7 yrs. labor; he knows all the workings of the inn. Megg is taken to stay with a weaver, a woman who has lost her husband and is bitter in her struggles. Cam is the weaver’s son who is not thought well enough of since his family is poor.\n\nOld Megg has a hut where she keeps goats and has a vineyard; she is a sister to Da. Thieves have also come here and taken several of Megg’s goats. When G. eventually can return to clean Megg’s house, G. takes a goat and gives it to the old couple who have had theirs stolen. She leaves the goat without letting them know who brought it—the action gets attributed to Jackaroo.\n\nThe landscape and country beyond the immediate area aren’t known to Gwyn: to the north the kingdom is protected by mountains; to the south by forests. Gwyn’s family has lived all their lives beneath the mountains. For protection the people need to know how to use their staff: Gwyn is told she must teach Tad. (they are watched as they practice by the young son of the Lord, the ones who are staying at the Inn.) One day G. and Burl are sent out to accompany the Lord and his son. Their journey takes them into dangerous territory as the Lord is out mapmaking. At one place overnight, they stay where the thieves are. Eventually G. and Burl and the lord and his son are caught in a blizzard; G. and the young man get separated from Burl and the Lord. G. and the young man end up in Megg’s hut. They are snowed in and the Lordling is injured; G. cures him. During their time marooned in the hut, the Lordling teaches G. to read enough to understand the maps; the commoners were not supposed to know how to read. In cleaning Megg’s hut, G. discovers the hidden clothing of Jackaroo. They also do lots of talking and G. learns a great deal about how the nobility live. He even reveals his name: Gaderian. When they can get out and return to the Inn, Gaderian hides first and the Lord thinks G. hasn’t been careful of his son; he puts a sword to her throat, but eventually she is saved. She feels betrayed by her family and for a long time is not at peace with them.\n\nIn the rest of the novel, Gwyn frequently disguises herself as Jackaroo and does brave deeds. She eventually is given a place of refuge—a cottage away where she and Burl can live. They are given this place of refuge by the Lord and his son.\n\n76. On Fortune’s Wheel Cynthia Voigt\n\nBirle, is the Innkeeper’s daughter in this book. She is a couple generations later than Gwyn in Jackaroo. Birle is scheduled to marry a huntsman, but she is discontented with her choice. She is out one night (something surely against all custom) and encounters someone trying to steal a boat. It turns out to be a young nobleman, the next Earl of Sutherland, Orien. His father was killed during a hunt—probably a murder not an accident. Gladaegal is Orien’s brother. O.’s departure would allow for him to become Earl. The old Earl (grandfather of Orien is the Earl who eventually saved Gwyn and Burle in Jackaroo.) She doesn’t know this as she confronts him; nor does she know that their lives will become entwined.\n\nThis novel is again rich in the customs of England of this period. Birle and Orien are eventually saved from the wreck of their boat and starvation, but taken by those who “save” them and are sold into slavery. A large man, a giant and slightly deformed and simple, Yul, is also taken. He and Birle are bought by Joachim, a philosopher, who is being driven by his rich brother (Corbel) to attempt to make gold through alchemy. Joachim has actually been working on an herbal—a book of all the natural remedies. He discovers that Birle can read and write (she’d been taught by her grandparents – Burl and Gwyn). Corbel keeps all in fear of him. The city is torn by tensions: Corbel stole a young woman (really not more than a child) and Celinde’s father is always trying to get her back. Corbel keeps the city under control by soldiers.\n\nOrien has a much harder enslavement—he is nearly sold to work the mines, but he becomes infected when his face is branded. He does escape to Joachim’s house on the very day that Joachim is escaping the city. Yul and Birle care for Orien; eventually they all escape to back to where Orien is earl and Birle back to the Inn. Only after Orien has asked to marry Birle (she believes she could never live the life of a Lady and asks to go away). She ends up at the house where Gwyn and Burl stayed under the protection of the old Earl.\n\nBirle has a daughter she names Lyiss, after her mother who has died, and Orien eventually comes and finds them both.\n\n77. Lily’s Crossing Patricia Reilly Giff (l998 Newbery Honor Book)\n\nLily is about 12; she has just finished 5th grade. It’s June of 1944, D-Day. Lily is getting ready to go to Rockaway, a place she and her father go for summers, with Gram. Lily’s mother is dead; Lily has stars on her bedroom ceiling in St. Albans and each summer as she goes to Rockaway she peals one from that wall to take.\n\nLily is kind of a self-centered child as first portrayed. She tells lies—makes up stories (and sometimes that gets her into trouble as when she tells Albert she is going to Europe and he thinks he can go along to find his sister Ruth), sometimes she daydreams, she needs friends (eventually Albert becomes one) and she doesn’t like it that her father is gone and she has to stay with her Gram. She is often upset with her Gram; and really wants her father around. This summer he arranges for her to have the piano taken to Rockaway; Lily’s mom played piano and Lily wanted to—but she wanted to be able to learn “right away.” Now she complains about practicing and all that’s demanded. Her best friend at Rockaway, Margaret Dillon has a brother, Eddie who is in France—is a part of the D-Day invasion. Margaret’s dad has to go to Detroit to work on bombers—the family has to move, but Margaret leaves Lily a key so Lily can get into the house. Poppy (Lily’s dad) has to go to Europe too, since engineers are needed. Lily is so upset that she doesn’t say goodby to her dad and then regrets it that she didn’t.\n\nAlbert is a Hungarian who is taken in by the Orban family for the summer. He’s staying with Mrs. Orban’s brother Emery in Canada. His sister Ruth (8yrs. old) is in France, Paris. Their parents did a newspaper and got in trouble with the Nazis and were killed. Albert wants Lily to teach him to swim; she works at that and he thinks he’ll be able to go with her to Europe. Lily has to eventually tell that she has lied.\n\nThe summer weaves the children in friendship amid the problems of WWII. In l945 Lily’s father does return and he has been able to locate Ruth, Albert’s sister. Eddie Dillon, does not come back from the War (as least as the book has it.).\n\n78. Walk Two Moons: Sharon Creech (l995 Newbery Award winner)\n\nSal (Salamanca Tree Hiddle) is 13; she’s lived most of her 13 yrs. in Bybanks, KY. The book tells two stories simultaneously: one is that of Sal and her father, of her mother who died and of the baby who was born prematurely and died, of Sal’s grandparents, the Hiddles—paternal grandparents (Gramps and Gram) who are taking her on a trip to Idaho, actually tracing the path of Sal’s mom’s last journey. Sal’s family is Native American (both Sal and her mom wanted to be called Indian or American Indian). The second story is of Phoebe Winterbottom, a young girl Sal’s age. Phoebe and Sal become pals when Sal and her dad move to Euclid, OH (have been there a year) when Margaret Cadaver (a very significant woman in the story) finds a job there for Mr. Hiddle.\n\nPhoebe’s mom is frightened when a young man appears in the area of the Winterbottom home; eventually readers learn that Phoebe’s mom had a son out of wedlock. Her husband, Prudence (one of the daughters) and Phoebe are all really shocked—and Phoebe has been further upset because her mom disappeared for several weeks before all this came out. The family had also been getting these mysterious messages on the porch: saying like “do not judge a person until you’ve walked two moons in his moccasins.”\n\nMargaret Cadaver’s mother lives with her; Margaret’s mom is Mrs. Partridge. Mr. Birkway, Phoebe and Sal’s English teacher, is Margaret’s twin brother (all this gets discussed through Sal’s story—she’s telling as she and her grandparents travel to Lewiston, ID). Mary Lou Finney and her cousin Ben are also key characters. We learn eventually that Ben’s mom is gone "
