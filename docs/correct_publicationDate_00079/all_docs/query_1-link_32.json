The space-borne lidar on board CALIPSO is well-posed to identify aerosols in the stratosphere from volcanic eruptions and major wildfire events. This paper describes improvements implemented in the version 4.5 CALIPSO data release to more accurately discriminate between volcanic ash, sulfate, and smoke within the stratosphere.\n\nVolcanic cloud detection using Sentinel-3 satellite data by means of neural networks: the Raikoke 2019 eruption test case\n\nIlaria Petracca, Davide De Santis, Matteo Picchiani, Stefano Corradini, Lorenzo Guerrieri, Fred Prata, Luca Merucci, Dario Stelitano, Fabio Del Frate, Giorgia Salvucci, and Giovanni Schiavon\n\nAtmos.

The algorithm results in an automatic image classification where ashy pixels are distinguished from other surfaces with remarkable accuracy. The model is considerably faster if compared to other approaches which are time consuming, case specific, and not automatic. The algorithm can be significantly helpful for emergency management during eruption events.\n\nThe new MISR research aerosol retrieval algorithm: a multi-angle, multi-spectral, bounded-variable least squares retrieval of aerosol particle properties over both land and water\n\nJames A.

Tech., 15, 6865–6887, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-6865-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-6865-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLaunched in December 1999, NASAâs Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) has given researchers qualitative constraints on aerosol particle properties for the past 22 years. Here, we present a new MISR research aerosol retrieval algorithm (RA) that utilizes over-land surface reflectance data from the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) to address limitations of the MISR operational aerosol retrieval algorithm and improve retrievals of aerosol particle properties.\n\nAlgorithm for vertical distribution of boundary layer aerosol components in remote-sensing data\n\nFuting Wang, Ting Yang, Zifa Wang, Haibo Wang, Xi Chen, Yele Sun, Jianjun Li, Guigang Tang, and Wenxuan Chai\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 6127–6144, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-6127-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-6127-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe develop a new algorithm to get the vertical mass concentration profiles of fine aerosol components based on the synergy of ground-based remote sensing for the first time. The comparisons with in situ observations and chemistry transport models validate the performance of the algorithm. Uncertainties caused by input parameters are also assessed in this paper. We expected that the algorithm can provide a new idea for lidar inversion and promote the development of aerosol component profiles.\n\nAtmospheric visibility inferred from continuous-wave Doppler wind lidar\n\nManuel QueiÃer, Michael Harris, and Steven Knoop\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 5527–5544, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-5527-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-5527-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nVisibility is how well we can see something. Visibility sensors, such as employed in meteorological observatories and airports, measure at a point at the instrument location, which may not be representative of visibilities further away, e.g. near the sea surface during sea spray. Light detecting and ranging (lidar) can measure visibility further away. We find wind lidar to be a viable tool to measure visibility with low accuracy, which could suffice for safety-uncritical applications.\n\nIdentification of smoke and sulfuric acid aerosol in SAGE III/ISS extinction spectra\n\nTravis N. Knepp, Larry Thomason, Mahesh Kovilakam, Jason Tackett, Jayanta Kar, Robert Damadeo, and David Flittner\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 5235–5260, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-5235-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-5235-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe used aerosol profiles from the SAGE III/ISS instrument to develop an aerosol classification method that was tested on four case-study events (two volcanic, two fire) and supported with CALIOP aerosol products. The method worked well in identifying smoke and volcanic aerosol in the stratosphere for these events. Raikoke is presented as a demonstration of the limitations of this method.\n\nCombining MieâRaman and fluorescence observations: a step forward in aerosol classification with lidar technology\n\nIgor Veselovskii, Qiaoyun Hu, Philippe Goloub, Thierry Podvin, Boris Barchunov, and Mikhail Korenskii\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 4881–4900, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-4881-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-4881-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAn approach to reveal variability in aerosol type at a high spatiotemporal resolution, by combining fluorescence and Mie–Raman lidar data, is presented. We applied this new classification scheme to lidar data obtained by LOA, University of Lille, in 2020–2021. It is demonstrated that the separation of the main particle types, such as smoke, dust, pollen, and urban, can be performed with a height resolution of 60 m and temporal resolution better than 10 min for the current lidar configuration.\n\nEffective uncertainty quantification for multi-angle polarimetric aerosol remote sensing over ocean\n\nMeng Gao, Kirk Knobelspiesse, Bryan A. Franz, Peng-Wang Zhai, Andrew M. Sayer, Amir Ibrahim, Brian Cairns, Otto Hasekamp, Yongxiang Hu, Vanderlei Martins, P. Jeremy Werdell, and Xiaoguang Xu\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 4859–4879, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-4859-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-4859-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this work, we assessed the pixel-wise retrieval uncertainties on aerosol and ocean color derived from multi-angle polarimetric measurements. Standard error propagation methods are used to compute the uncertainties. A flexible framework is proposed to evaluate how representative these uncertainties are compared with real retrieval errors. Meanwhile, to assist operational data processing, we optimized the computational speed to evaluate the retrieval uncertainties based on neural networks.\n\nEmploying relaxed smoothness constraints on imaginary part of refractive index in AERONET aerosol retrieval algorithm\n\nAlexander Sinyuk, Brent N. Holben, Thomas F. Eck, David M. Giles, Ilya Slutsker, Oleg Dubovik, Joel S. Schafer, Alexander Smirnov, and Mikhail Sorokin\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 4135–4151, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-4135-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-4135-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper describes modification of smoothness constraints on the imaginary part of the refractive index employed in the AERONET aerosol retrieval algorithm. This modification is termed relaxed due to the weaker strength of this new smoothness constraint. Applying the modified version of the smoothness constraint results in a significant reduction of retrieved light absorption by brown-carbon-containing aerosols.\n\nObservation of bioaerosol transport using wideband integrated bioaerosol sensor and coherent Doppler lidar\n\nDawei Tang, Tianwen Wei, Jinlong Yuan, Haiyun Xia, and Xiankang Dou\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 2819–2838, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-2819-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-2819-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDuring 11–20 March 2020, three aerosol transport events were investigated by a lidar system and an online bioaerosol detection system in Hefei, China. Observation results reveal that the events not only contributed to high particulate matter pollution but also to the transport of external bioaerosols, resulting in changes in the fraction of fluorescent biological aerosol particles. This detection method improved the time resolution and provided more parameters for aerosol detection.\n\nRetrieval of UVB aerosol extinction profiles from the ground-based Langley Mobile Ozone Lidar (LMOL) system\n\nLiqiao Lei, Timothy A. Berkoff, Guillaume Gronoff, Jia Su, Amin R. Nehrir, Yonghua Wu, Fred Moshary, and Shi Kuang\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 2465–2478, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-2465-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-2465-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAerosol extinction in the UVB (280â315 nm) is difficult to retrieve using simple lidar techniques due to the lack of lidar ratios at those wavelengths. The 2018 Long Island Sound Tropospheric Ozone Study (LISTOS) in the New York City region provided the opportunity to characterize the lidar ratio for UVB aerosol retrieval for the Langley Mobile Ozone Lidar (LMOL). A 292 nm aerosol product comparison between the NASA Langley High Altitude Lidar Observatory (HALO) and LMOL was also carried out.\n\nEnhancing MAX-DOAS atmospheric state retrievals by multispectral polarimetry â studies using synthetic data\n\nJan-Lukas Tirpitz, Udo FrieÃ, Robert Spurr, and Ulrich Platt\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 2077–2098, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-2077-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-2077-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMAX-DOAS is a widely used measurement technique for the remote detection of atmospheric aerosol and trace gases. It relies on the analysis of ultra-violet and visible radiation spectra of skylight. To date, information contained in the skylight's polarisation state has not been utilised. On the basis of synthetic data, we carried out sensitivity analyses to assess the potential of polarimetry for MAX-DOAS applications.\n\nAssessing the benefits of Imaging Infrared Radiometer observations for the CALIOP version 4 cloud and aerosol discrimination algorithm\n\nThibault Vaillant de GuÃ©lis, GÃ©rard Ancellet, Anne Garnier, Laurent C.-Labonnote, Jacques Pelon, Mark A. Vaughan, Zhaoyan Liu, and David M. Winker\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 1931–1956, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-1931-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-1931-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA new IIR-based cloud and aerosol discrimination (CAD) algorithm is developed using the IIR brightness temperature differences for cloud and aerosol features confidently identified by the CALIOP version 4 CAD algorithm. IIR classifications agree with the majority of V4 cloud identifications, reduce the ambiguity in a notable fraction of not confident V4 cloud classifications, and correct a few V4 misclassifications of cloud layers identified as dense dust or elevated smoke layers by CALIOP.\n\nA semi-automated procedure for the emitterâreceiver geometry characterization of motor-controlled lidars\n\nMarco Di Paolantonio, Davide Dionisi, and Gian Luigi Liberti\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 1217–1231, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-1217-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-1217-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA procedure for the characterization of the lidar transmitter–receiver geometry was developed. This characterization is currently implemented in the Rome RMR lidar to optimize the telescope/beam alignment, retrieve the overlap function, and estimate the absolute and relative tilt of the laser beam. This procedure can be potentially used to complement the standard EARLINET quality assurance tests.\n\nAerosol optical characteristics in the urban area of Rome, Italy, and their impact on the UV index\n\nMonica Campanelli, Henri DiÃ©moz, Anna Maria Siani, Alcide di Sarra, Anna Maria Iannarelli, Rei Kudo, Gabriele Fasano, Giampietro Casasanta, Luca Tofful, Marco Cacciani, Paolo SanÃ², and Stefano Dietrich\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 1171–1183, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-1171-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-1171-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe aerosol optical depth (AOD) characteristics in an urban area of Rome were retrieved over a period of 11 years (2010–2020) to determine, for the first time, their effect on the incoming ultraviolet (UV) solar radiation. The surface forcing efficiency shows that the AOD is the primary parameter affecting the surface irradiance in Rome, and it is found to be greater for smaller zenith angles and for larger and more absorbing particles in the UV range (such as, e.g., mineral dust).\n\nAerosol models from the AERONET database: application to surface reflectance validation\n\nJean-Claude Roger, Eric Vermote, Sergii Skakun, Emilie Murphy, Oleg Dubovik, Natacha Kalecinski, Bruno Korgo, and Brent Holben\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 1123–1144, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-1123-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-1123-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFrom measurements of the sky performed by AERONET, we determined the microphysical properties of the atmospheric particles (aerosols) for each AERONET site. We used the aerosol optical thickness and its variation over the visible spectrum. This allows us to determine an aerosol model useful for (but not only) the validation of the surface reflectance satellite-derived product. The impact of the aerosol model uncertainties on the surface reflectance validation has been found to be 1 % to 3 %.\n\nContinuous mapping of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air quality in East Asia at daily 6 âÃâ 6 km2 resolution by application of a random forest algorithm to 2011â2019 GOCI geostationary satellite data\n\nDrew C. Pendergrass, Shixian Zhai, Jhoon Kim, Ja-Ho Koo, Seoyoung Lee, Minah Bae, Soontae Kim, Hong Liao, and Daniel J. Jacob\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 1075–1091, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-1075-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-1075-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper uses a machine learning algorithm to infer high-resolution maps of particulate air quality in eastern China, Japan, and the Korean peninsula, using data from a geostationary satellite along with meteorology. We then perform an extensive evaluation of this inferred air quality and use it to diagnose trends in the region. We hope this paper and the associated data will be valuable to other scientists interested in epidemiology, air quality, remote sensing, and machine learning.\n\nDeep-learning-based post-process correction of the aerosol parameters in the high-resolution Sentinel-3 Level-2 Synergy product\n\nAntti Lipponen, Jaakko Reinvall, Arttu VÃ¤isÃ¤nen, Henri Taskinen, Timo LÃ¤hivaara, Larisa Sogacheva, Pekka Kolmonen, Kari Lehtinen, Antti Arola, and Ville Kolehmainen\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 895–914, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-895-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-895-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe have developed a machine-learning-based model that can be used to correct the Sentinel-3 satellite-based aerosol parameter data of the Synergy data product. The strength of the model is that the original satellite data processing does not have to be carried out again but the correction can be carried out with the data already available. We show that the correction significantly improves the accuracy of the satellite aerosol parameters.\n\nRetrieval of UVâvisible aerosol absorption using AERONET and OMIâMODIS synergy: spatial and temporal variability across major aerosol environments\n\nVinay Kayetha, Omar Torres, and Hiren Jethva\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 845–877, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-845-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-845-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nExisting measurements of spectral aerosol absorption are limited, particularly in the UV region. We use the synergy of satellite and ground measurements to derive spectral single scattering albedo of aerosols from the UV–visible spectrum. The resulting spectral SSAs are used to investigate seasonality in absorption for carbonaceous, dust, and urban aerosols. Regional aerosol absorption models that could be used to make reliable assumptions in satellite remote sensing of aerosols are derived.\n\nEstimating cloud condensation nuclei concentrations from CALIPSO lidar measurements\n\nGoutam Choudhury and Matthias Tesche\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 639–654, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-639-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-639-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAerosols are tiny particles suspended in the atmosphere. A fraction of these particles can form clouds and are called cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Measurements of such aerosol particles are necessary to study the aerosol–cloud interactions and reduce the uncertainty in our future climate predictions. We present a novel methodology to estimate global 3D CCN concentrations from the CALIPSO satellite measurements. The final data set will be used to study the aerosol–cloud interactions.\n\nAsh particle refractive index model for simulating the brightness temperature spectrum of volcanic ash clouds from satellite infrared sounder measurements\n\nHiroshi Ishimoto, Masahiro Hayashi, and Yuzo Mano\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 435–458, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-435-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-435-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUsing data from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) measurements of volcanic ash clouds (VACs) and radiative transfer calculations, we attempt to simulate the measured brightness temperature spectra (BTS) of volcanic ash aerosols in the infrared region. In particular, the dependence on the ash refractive index (RI) model is investigated.\n\nRetrieval of aerosol properties using relative radiance measurements from an all-sky camera\n\nRoberto RomÃ¡n, Juan C. AntuÃ±a-SÃ¡nchez, Victoria E. Cachorro, Carlos Toledano, BenjamÃ­n Torres, David Mateos, David Fuertes, CÃ©sar LÃ³pez, Ramiro GonzÃ¡lez, Tatyana Lapionok, Marcos Herreras-Giralda, Oleg Dubovik, and Ãngel M. de Frutos\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 407–433, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-407-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-407-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAn all-sky camera is used to obtain the relative sky radiance, and this radiance is used as input in an inversion code to obtain aerosol properties. This paper is really interesting because it pushes forward the use and capability of sky cameras for more advanced science purposes. Enhanced aerosol properties can be retrieved with accuracy using only an all-sky camera, but synergy with other instruments providing aerosol optical depth could even increase the power of these low-cost instruments.\n\nOptimization of Aeolus' aerosol optical properties by maximum-likelihood estimation\n\nFrithjof Ehlers, Thomas Flament, Alain Dabas, Dimitri Trapon, Adrien Lacour, Holger Baars, and Anne Grete Straume-Lindner\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 185–203, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-185-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-185-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Aeolus satellite observes the Earth and can vertically detect any kind of particles (aerosols or clouds) in the atmosphere below it. These observations are typically very noisy, which needs to be accounted for. This work dampens the noise in Aeolus' aerosol and cloud data, which are provided publicly by the ESA, so that the scientific community can make better use of it. This makes the data potentially more useful for weather prediction and climate research.\n\nA Bayesian parametric approach to the retrieval of the atmospheric number size distribution from lidar data\n\nAlberto Sorrentino, Alessia Sannino, Nicola Spinelli, Michele Piana, Antonella Boselli, Valentino Tontodonato, Pasquale Castellano, and Xuan Wang\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 149–164, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-149-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-149-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a novel approach that can be used to obtain microphysical properties of atmospheric aerosol, up to several kilometers in the atmosphere, from lidar measurements taken from the ground. Our approach provides accurate reconstructions under many different experimental conditions. Our results can contribute to the expansion of the use of remote sensing techniques for air quality monitoring and atmospheric science in general.\n\nBiomass burning aerosol heating rates from the ORACLES (ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS) 2016 and 2017 experiments\n\nSabrina P.

Sebastian Schmidt, Hong Chen, Peter Pilewskie, Scott Kittelman, Jens Redemann, Samuel LeBlanc, Kristina Pistone, Michal Segal Rozenhaimer, MeloÃ« Kacenelenbogen, Yohei Shinozuka, Connor Flynn, Rich Ferrare, Sharon Burton, Chris Hostetler, Marc Mallet, and Paquita Zuidema\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 61–77, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-61-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-61-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis work presents heating rates derived from aircraft observations from the 2016 and 2017 field campaigns of ORACLES (ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS). We separate the total heating rates into aerosol and gas (primarily water vapor) absorption and explore some of the co-variability of heating rate profiles and their primary drivers, leading to the development of a new concept: the heating rate efficiency (HRE; the heating rate per unit aerosol extinction).\n\nAeolus L2A aerosol optical properties product: standard correct algorithm and Mie correct algorithm\n\nThomas Flament, Dimitri Trapon, Adrien Lacour, Alain Dabas, Frithjof Ehlers, and Dorit Huber\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 7851–7871, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-7851-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-7851-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper presents the main algorithms of the Aeolus Level 2 aerosol optical properties product. The processing chain was developed under contract with ESA. We show that the ALADIN instrument, although primarily designed to retrieve atmospheric winds, is also able to provide valuable information about aerosol and cloud optical properties. The algorithms are detailed, and validation on simulated and real examples is shown.\n\nMethodology to obtain highly resolved SO2 vertical profiles for representation of volcanic emissions in climate models\n\nOscar S. Sandvik, Johan Friberg, Moa K. Sporre, and Bengt G. Martinsson\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 7153–7165, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-7153-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-7153-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA method to form SO2 profiles in the stratosphere with high vertical resolution following volcanic eruptions is introduced. The method combines space-based high-resolution vertical aerosol profiles and SO2 measurements the first 2 weeks after an eruption with air mass trajectory analyses. The SO2 is located at higher altitude than in most previous studies. The detailed resolution of the SO2 profile is unprecedented compared to other methods.\n\nInferring the absorption properties of organic aerosol in Siberian biomass burning plumes from remote optical observations\n\nIgor B. Konovalov, Nikolai A. Golovushkin, Matthias Beekmann, Mikhail V. Panchenko, and Meinrat O. Andreae\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 6647–6673, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-6647-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-6647-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe absorption of solar light by organic matter, known as brown carbon (BrC), contributes significantly to the radiative budget of the Earthâs atmosphere, but its representation in atmospheric models is uncertain. This paper advances a methodology to constrain model parameters characterizing BrC absorption of atmospheric aerosol originating from biomass burning with the available remote ground-based observations of atmospheric aerosol.\n\nMass concentration estimates of long-range-transported Canadian biomass burning aerosols from a multi-wavelength Raman polarization lidar and a ceilometer in Finland\n\nXiaoxia Shang, Tero Mielonen, Antti Lipponen, Elina Giannakaki, Ari Leskinen, Virginie Buchard, Anton S. Darmenov, Antti Kukkurainen, Antti Arola, Ewan O'Connor, Anne Hirsikko, and Mika Komppula\n\nAtmos. Meas.

The optical properties and the mass concentration estimations were reported for such aged smoke aerosols over northern Europe.\n\nRetrievals of dust-related particle mass and ice-nucleating particle concentration profiles with ground-based polarization lidar and sun photometer over a megacity in central China\n\nYun He, Yunfei Zhang, Fuchao Liu, Zhenping Yin, Yang Yi, Yifan Zhan, and Fan Yi\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 5939–5954, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-5939-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-5939-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe POLIPHON method can retrieve the height profiles of dust-related particle mass and ice-nucleating particle (INP) concentrations. Applying a dust case data set screening scheme based on the lidar-derived depolarization ratio (rather than Ã ngstrÃ¶m exponent for 440–870 nm and AOD at 532 nm), the mixed-dust-related conversion factors are retrieved from sun photometer observations over Wuhan, China. This method may potentially be extended to regions influenced by mixed dust.\n\nIntroducing the MISR level 2 near real-time aerosol product\n\nMarcin L. Witek, Michael J. Garay, David J. Diner, Michael A. Bull, Felix C. Seidel, Abigail M. Nastan, and Earl G. Hansen\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 5577–5591, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-5577-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-5577-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis article documents the development and testing of a new near real-time (NRT) aerosol product from the MISR instrument on NASAâs Terra platform. The NRT product capitalizes on the unique attributes of the MISR retrieval approach, which leads to a high-quality and reliable aerosol data product. Several modifications are described that allow for rapid product generation within a 3 h window following acquisition. Implications for the product quality and consistency are discussed.\n\nEstimation of PM2.5 concentration in China using linear hybrid machine learning model\n\nZhihao Song, Bin Chen, Yue Huang, Li Dong, and Tingting Yang\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 5333–5347, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-5333-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-5333-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe linear hybrid machine learning model achieves the expected target well. The overall inversion accuracy (R2) of the model is 0.84, and the RMSE is 12.92 µg m−3. R2 was above 0.7 in more than 70 &percnt; of the sites, whereas RMSE and mean absolute error were below 20 and 15 µg m−3, respectively. There was severe pollution in winter with an average PM2.5 concentration of 62.10 µg m−3. However, there was only slight pollution in summer with an average PM2.5 concentration of 47.39 µg m−3.\n\nSpecies correlation measurements in turbulent flare plumes: considerations for field measurements\n\nScott P. Seymour and Matthew R. Johnson\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 5179–5197, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-5179-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-5179-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nField measurements of gas flare emissions often assume that combustion species are spatially and temporally correlated in the plume. By measuring black carbon (BC) and water vapour in turbulent lab-scale flare plumes, this study shows that the well-correlated species assumption is not universally valid and that field measurements may be subject to large added uncertainty. Further analysis suggests that this uncertainty is easily avoided, and initial guidance is provided on sampling protocols.\n\nRetrieval of aerosol microphysical properties from atmospheric lidar sounding: an investigation using synthetic measurements and data from the ACEPOL campaign\n\nWilliam G. K. McLean, Guangliang Fu, Sharon P. Burton, and Otto P. Hasekamp\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 4755–4771, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-4755-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-4755-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we present results from aerosol retrievals using both synthetic and real lidar datasets, including measurements from the ACEPOL (Aerosol Characterization from Polarimeter and Lidar) campaign, a combined initiative between NASA and SRON (the Netherlands Institute for Space Research). Aerosol microphysical retrievals were performed using the High Spectral Resolution Lidar-2 (HSRL-2) setup, alongside several others, with the ACEPOL retrievals also compared to polarimeter retrievals.Â\n\nIntegration of GOCI and AHI Yonsei aerosol optical depth products during the 2016 KORUS-AQ and 2018 EMeRGe campaigns\n\nHyunkwang Lim, Sujung Go, Jhoon Kim, Myungje Choi, Seoyoung Lee, Chang-Keun Song, and Yasuko Kasai\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 4575–4592, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-4575-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-4575-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAerosol property observations by satellites from geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) in particular have advantages of frequent sampling better than 1 h in addition to broader spatial coverage. This study provides data fusion products of aerosol optical properties from four different algorithms for two different GEO satellites: GOCI and AHI. The fused aerosol products adopted ensemble-mean and maximum-likelihood estimation methods. The data fusion provides improved results with better accuracy.\n\nDeriving boundary layer height from aerosol lidar using machine learning: KABL and ADABL algorithms\n\nThomas Rieutord, Sylvain Aubert, and Tiago Machado\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 4335–4353, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-4335-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-4335-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis article describes two methods to estimate the height of the very first layer of the atmosphere. It is measured with aerosol lidars, and the two new methods are based on machine learning. Both are open source and available under free licenses. A sensitivity analysis and a 2-year evaluation against meteorological balloons were carried out. One method has a good agreement with balloons but is limited by training, and the other has less good agreement with balloons but is more flexible.\n\nEfficient multi-angle polarimetric inversion of aerosols and ocean color powered by a deep neural network forward model\n\nMeng Gao, Bryan A. Franz, Kirk Knobelspiesse, Peng-Wang Zhai, Vanderlei Martins, Sharon Burton, Brian Cairns, Richard Ferrare, Joel Gales, Otto Hasekamp, Yongxiang Hu, Amir Ibrahim, Brent McBride, Anin Puthukkudy, P. Jeremy Werdell, and Xiaoguang Xu\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 4083–4110, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-4083-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-4083-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMulti-angle polarimetric measurements can retrieve accurate aerosol properties over complex atmosphere and ocean systems; however, most retrieval algorithms require high computational costs. We propose a deep neural network (NN) forward model to represent the radiative transfer simulation of coupled atmosphere and ocean systems and then conduct simultaneous aerosol and ocean color retrievals on AirHARP measurements. The computational acceleration is 103 times with CPU or 104 times with GPU.\n\nQuantitative comparison of measured and simulated O4 absorptions for one day with extremely low aerosol load over the tropical Atlantic\n\nThomas Wagner, Steffen DÃ¶rner, Steffen Beirle, Sebastian Donner, and Stefan Kinne\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 3871–3893, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-3871-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-3871-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe compare measured and simulated O4 absorptions for conditions of extremely low aerosol optical depth, for which the uncertainties related to imperfect knowledge of aerosol properties do not significantly affect the comparison results. The simulations underestimate the measurements by 15 % to 20 %. Even if no aerosols are considered, the simulated O4 absorptions are systematically lower than the measurements. Our results indicate a fundamental inconsistency between simulations and measurements.\n\nA Dark Target research aerosol algorithm for MODIS observations over eastern China: increasing coverage while maintaining accuracy at high aerosol loading\n\nYingxi R. Shi, Robert C. Levy, Leiku Yang, Lorraine A. Remer, Shana Mattoo, and Oleg Dubovik\n\nAtmos. Meas.

This study improves the accuracy and data coverage of measured aerosol from satellites, which help quantify, characterize, and understand the impact of the haze phenomena over the entire East Asia region.\n\nOptimal use of the Prede POM sky radiometer for aerosol, water vapor, and ozone retrievals\n\nRei Kudo, Henri DiÃ©moz, Victor EstellÃ©s, Monica Campanelli, Masahiro Momoi, Franco Marenco, Claire L. Ryder, Osamu Ijima, Akihiro Uchiyama, Kouichi Nakashima, Akihiro Yamazaki, Ryoji Nagasawa, Nozomu Ohkawara, and Haruma Ishida\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 3395–3426, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-3395-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-3395-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA new method, Skyrad pack MRI version 2, was developed to retrieve aerosol physical and optical properties, water vapor, and ozone column concentrations from the sky radiometer, a filter radiometer deployed in the SKYNET international network. Our method showed good performance in a radiative closure study using surface solar irradiances from the Baseline Surface Radiation Network and a comparison using aircraft in situ measurements of Saharan dust events during the SAVEX-D 2015 campaign.\n\nAnalysis of simultaneous aerosol and ocean glint retrieval using multi-angle observations\n\nKirk Knobelspiesse, Amir Ibrahim, Bryan Franz, Sean Bailey, Robert Levy, Ziauddin Ahmad, Joel Gales, Meng Gao, Michael Garay, Samuel Anderson, and Olga Kalashnikova\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 3233–3252, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-3233-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-3233-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe assessed atmospheric aerosol and ocean surface wind speed remote sensing capability with NASA's Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), using synthetic data and a Bayesian inference technique called generalized nonlinear retrieval analysis (GENRA). We found success using three aerosol parameters plus wind speed. This shows that MISR can perform an atmospheric correction for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the same spacecraft (Terra).\n\nModel-enforced post-process correction of satellite aerosol retrievals\n\nAntti Lipponen, Ville Kolehmainen, Pekka Kolmonen, Antti Kukkurainen, Tero Mielonen, Neus Sabater, Larisa Sogacheva, Timo H. Virtanen, and Antti Arola\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 2981–2992, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-2981-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-2981-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe have developed a new computational method to post-process-correct the satellite aerosol retrievals. The proposed method combines the conventional satellite aerosol retrievals relying on physics-based models and machine learning. The results show significantly improved accuracy in the aerosol data over the operational satellite data products. The correction can be applied to the existing satellite aerosol datasets with no need to fully reprocess the much larger original radiance data.\n\nExplicit and consistent aerosol correction for visible wavelength satellite cloud and nitrogen dioxide retrievals based on optical properties from a global aerosol analysis\n\nAlexander Vasilkov, Nickolay Krotkov, Eun-Su Yang, Lok Lamsal, Joanna Joiner, Patricia Castellanos, Zachary Fasnacht, and Robert Spurr\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 2857–2871, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-2857-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-2857-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo explicitly account for aerosol effects in the OMI cloud and nitrogen dioxide algorithms, we use a model of aerosol optical properties from a global aerosol assimilation system and radiative transfer computations. Accounting for anisotropic reflection of Earth's surface is an important feature of the approach. Comparisons of the cloud and tropospheric nitrogen dioxide retrievals with implicit and explicit aerosol corrections are carried out for a selected area with high pollution.\n\nReducing cloud contamination in aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements\n\nVerena Schenzinger and Axel Kreuter\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 2787–2798, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-2787-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-2787-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWhen measuring the aerosol optical depth of the atmosphere, clouds in front of the sun lead to erroneously high values. Therefore, measurements that are potentially affected by clouds need to be removed from the dataset by an automatic process. As the currently used algorithm cannot reliably identify thin clouds, we developed a new one based on a method borrowed from machine learning. Tests with 10 years of data show improved performance of the new routine and therefore higher data quality.\n\nSynergy processing of diverse ground-based remote sensing and in situ data using the GRASP algorithm: applications to radiometer, lidar and radiosonde observations\n\nAnton Lopatin, Oleg Dubovik, David Fuertes, Georgiy Stenchikov, Tatyana Lapyonok, Igor Veselovskii, Frank G. Wienhold, Illia Shevchenko, Qiaoyun Hu, and Sagar Parajuli\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 2575–2614, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-2575-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-2575-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe article presents novelties in characterizing fine particles suspended in the air by means of combining various measurements that observe light propagation in atmosphere. Several non-coincident observations (some of which require sunlight, while others work only at night) could be united under the assumption that aerosol properties do not change drastically at nighttime. It also proposes how to describe particles' composition in a simplified manner that uses new types of observations.\n\nRetrieval of stratospheric aerosol size distribution parameters using satellite solar occultation measurements at three wavelengths\n\nFelix Wrana, Christian von Savigny, Jacob Zalach, and Larry W. Thomason\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 2345–2357, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-2345-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-2345-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this paper, we describe a new method for calculating the size of naturally occurring droplets (aerosols) made mostly of sulfuric acid and water that can be found roughly at 20 km altitude in the atmosphere. We use data from the instrument SAGE III/ISS that is mounted on the International Space Station. We show that our method works well, and that the size parameters we calculate are reasonable and can be a valuable addition for a better understanding of aerosols and their effect on climate.\n\nRelative sky radiance from multi-exposure all-sky camera images\n\nJuan C. AntuÃ±a-SÃ¡nchez, Roberto RomÃ¡n, Victoria E. Cachorro, Carlos Toledano, CÃ©sar LÃ³pez, Ramiro GonzÃ¡lez, David Mateos, Abel Calle, and Ãngel M. de Frutos\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 2201–2217, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-2201-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-2201-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper presents a new technique to exploit the potential of all-sky cameras. The sky radiance at three effective wavelengths is calculated and compared with alternative measurements and simulated data. The proposed method will be useful for the retrieval of aerosol and cloud properties.\n\nAn uncertainty-based protocol for the setup and measurement of sootâblack carbon emissions from gas flares using sky-LOSA\n\nBradley M. Conrad and Matthew R. Johnson\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 1573–1591, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-1573-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-1573-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA general uncertainty analysis (GUA) is performed for the sky-LOSA technique used to remotely measure soot emissions from gas flares. GUA data are compiled in an open-source software tool to help sky-LOSA users select critical setup and acquisition parameters while giving quantitative visual feedback on anticipated uncertainties for a specific measurement. The software tool enables easy acquisition of optimal measurement data, significantly increasing the accessibility of the sky-LOSA technique.\n\nA new measurement approach for validating satellite-based above-cloud aerosol optical depth\n\nCharles K. Gatebe, Hiren Jethva, Ritesh Gautam, Rajesh Poudyal, and TamÃ¡s VÃ¡rnai\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 1405–1423, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-1405-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-1405-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe retrieval of aerosol parameters from passive satellite instruments in cloudy scenes is very challenging, partly because clouds and cloud-related processes significantly modify the aerosol properties and the 3D radiative effects. This study shows simultaneous retrieval of above-cloud aerosol optical depth and aerosol-corrected cloud optical depth from airborne measurements, thereby demonstrating a novel approach for assessing satellite retrievals of aerosols above clouds.\n\nOMPS LP Version 2.0 multi-wavelength aerosol extinction coefficient retrieval algorithm\n\nGhassan Taha, Robert Loughman, Tong Zhu, Larry Thomason, Jayanta Kar, Landon Rieger, and Adam Bourassa\n\nAtmos.
