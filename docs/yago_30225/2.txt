GWEN HOTCHKISS

Played By: Liza Huber

Occupation:

Works for her father's company, as an executive of some type.

Romances:

Finally, married to Ethan Winthrop.

Siblings:

None that we are aware of, but I'm sure she's got some.

Enemies:

Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald: Is furious that she stole Ethan away from her once before, and will do whatever she can to prevent her from stealing him again now that they are married.

Dirty Deeds:

Sent a tabloid newspaper an email about Ethan's true paternity (that he's not really a Crane). She and her mother sent the email from Theresa's laptop to make it look like Theresa did it.

Best Qualities:

Don't really think she has a best quality, all she has ever shown is her snobby-ness towards the people she meets.

Worst Qualities:

Money hungry. She may have loved/still loves Ethan, but her love of the Crane money and power is stronger. Will stop at nothing from keeping Ethan, even if it means being pregnant with his baby.
