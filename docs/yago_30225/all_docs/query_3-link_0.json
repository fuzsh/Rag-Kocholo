She is the third of five children and the elder daughter born to Martin Fitzgerald (b. Apr. 6, 1947) and Pilar Lopez-Fitzgerald (b. Aug. 13, 1950). She has four siblings: two older brothers Antonio Lopez-Fitzgerald (b. May 5, 1970) and Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald (b. Feb. 29, 1972) and a younger brother Miguel Lopez-Fitzgerald (b. Dec. 14, 1984) and a younger sister Paloma Lopez-Fitzgerald (b. Nov. 30, 1986). While only a toddler, her father Martin had abandoned the family to run away to Mexico with Katherine Barrett, although the reason for his disappearance wasn't revealed until much later on. With her mother Pilar working two jobs, the young Theresa was raised primarily by her eldest brother, Antonio. After some time after their father disappeared, Antonio also disappeared and ran away from home as well. When Theresa was only a young teenager, at which time her older brother Luis then helped Pilar care for Theresa and her younger brother Miguel. During her teenage years, Theresa developed a deep, strong and intense infatuation with Ethan Crane, the oldest son of her mother's employer, Ivy Crane and Julian Crane. Although she had not yet met him, she became convinced that they were destined and fated for each other and would someday marry. Her best friend since childhood and confidant is Whitney Russell.\n\nFirst Relationship with Ethan[]\n\nThe show debuted with Theresa's crush Ethan returning to Harmony, along with his girlfriend Gwen Hotchkiss. Theresa immediately began doing whatever she could to get close to Ethan, usually coming up with harebrained schemes that ended in disasters such as burying Ethan in fish at the cannery, spilling food on him, etc. Ethan came to believe that Theresa was criminally stalking him and hired a private investigator to track her down. As part of her plan to get close to Ethan, Theresa worked under disguise as an assistant for Ethan's mother Ivy. It was through this position that Ethan and Theresa came to know each other and Ethan forgave Theresa for the accidents.\n\nEventually Theresa was successful in sparking a relationship with Ethan in the fall of 2000, and they were engaged to be married Christmas Eve of that year. Theresa promised her mother that she would not sleep with Ethan before the day of their wedding, so the couple waited until just after midnight the morning of the wedding to make love, unbeknownst to either conceiving Little Ethan in the process.\n\nThe wedding was interrupted when Ethan's enraged mother, Ivy, crashed her car into the church before they could take their vows and produced a tabloid claiming that Theresa had sent information on Ethan's true paternity to a tabloid exposing that he was not a Crane, but in fact the son of Sam Bennett even though Gwen and Rebecca had in truth framed Theresa for destroying Ethan's life. Theresa then fled to Bermuda, determined to find Julian and convince him to adopt Ethan and make him the Crane heir anyway.\n\nWhile in Bermuda, Theresa gets drunk and \"makes love\" with Julian and goes through a marriage ceremony with him, which is later shown to have never been valid. Theresa returned home to Harmony and resumed her relationship with Ethan. He was furious to learn she had apparently drunkenly married Julian, but forgave her on the condition that she stop lying to him. She soon learned she was pregnant but lied to Ethan about it when she signed the annulment papers because she thought it was Julian's child. Unfortunately, Ethan learned of her pregnancy, like her marriage, in yet another tabloid reveal, and broke things off with her because he couldn't trust her. She spends the next five to six years trying to win him back.\n\nRivalry with Gwen and Elijah Ray Sanders[]\n\nAlthough Theresa continued to pursue Ethan, she was unsuccessful at winning Ethan back before he wed Gwen in 2003 after she became pregnant with Ethan's baby. After the marriage, Theresa left Harmony for LA. However, in a twist of fate, Ethan and Gwen had traveled there as well to see a specialist regarding their problematic pregnancy. When they met in L.A., Ethan and Theresa kissed (unknowingly in front of a TV camera), and Gwen ended up seeing them on the evening news from her hospital bed. Enraged, Gwen confronted Theresa at an apartment and started a physical confrontation that caused her to miscarry her unborn daughter Sarah. Back in Harmony, Gwen's mother Rebecca formulated a plan to take Little Ethan away from Theresa while Ethan and Gwen decided to have a baby using a surrogate mother. Little Ethan was eventually adopted by Ethan and Gwen. To get her son back, Theresa drugged and kidnapped Ethan and Gwen's surrogate and had herself implanted with Gwen and Ethan's fertilized embryo, planning to trade the baby for Little Ethan. Later, Theresa believed she had miscarried the baby, and tried unsuccessfully to get Fox Crane to impregnate her. Knowing she had only a limited window of time to replace the fetus, she stole a date rape drug (gamma-hydroxybutyric acid) from Eve Russell and slipped it into Ethan's wine, then dressed up like Gwen and sneaked into his bed resulting in Theresa getting pregnant with a second baby. and Third Baby\n\nThereafter, Theresa was pregnant with an unusual set of twins—one presumably belonged to Ethan and Gwen, and the other to Ethan and Theresa. Theresa was eventually unable to carry both children to term, and the boy, who was to be named Nathan, was medically aborted. After the baby girl, originally named Ashley, was born fourteen weeks early, Theresa shocked Gwen (who believed she was the child's biological mother) with the news that the child might be hers, and that she had no intent on giving her up no matter who the biological mother was. DNA tests were performed on the newborn to establish both paternity and maternity, and Ethan and Theresa were confirmed to be the girl's biological parents, and Theresa renamed her Jane. Ethan's plans to sue Theresa for custody of Jane were interrupted after Gwen kidnapped Jane and stabbed Theresa in the back with a scalpel. Ethan then offered to let Theresa have the baby if she would agree to drop the charges against Gwen. Theresa refused to drop the charges, and Gwen was acquitted in court after Eve testified to the court that her break from reality had been brought on by drug interactions and that Gwen could not be held responsible for her actions. The judge then awarded custody to Gwen and Ethan, due to her concern over how Jane was conceived.\n\nMarriage to Alistair Crane[]\n\nTheresa wed Alistair Crane on October 3, 2005 after he promised to help her get back her daughter Jane, and because she wanted access to the Crane mansion itself, where she believed she could uncover information that would clear her name in regards to her wedding day tabloid scandal. Unbeknownst to Theresa, Harmony's arch villain had plans to use her, as well; she signed a pre-nuptial agreement in which she consented to sexual relations with him (her later attempts to renege led to her being repeatedly raped by Alistair with Gwen's help in the fall of 2005) and she also signed her consent to Alistair's adoption of her son, Little Ethan, who would become the new Crane heir, to be molded in Alistair's image. Unable to leave her son despite Ethan's offers to help her escape, Theresa made the best out of her situation, frantically fantasizing about the man she loved while the elderly Alistair used her body (and while, on one notable occasion, her rival Gwen prevented Ethan from stopping Alistair from raping Theresa). She eventually began repeated attempts to murder Alistair, one of which attempts went horribly awry when Ethan consumed the poisoned guacamole intended for Alistair and went into a coma. Both during her husband's coma (which he faked as part of a trick to lure Harmony residents to Rome) and after his apparent July 2006 demise in Italy (where his train was struck by a missile), Theresa assumed control of Crane Industries on behalf of her son. She's used Alistair's money and power to mixed ends - bribing and blackmailing employers to prevent Ethan from getting a job and to trap Gwen in one, but also shoring up Crane fiscally, attempting to make the company both stronger and fairer as her son's inheritance. There remains some question as to the extent to which Theresa would have power at Crane were it publicly known that her child is not Julian Crane's son, but Ethan Winthrop's, a question complicated by Alistair Crane having legally adopted the boy.\n\nRelationship with Jared Casey and Elijah Ray Sanders[]\n\nJared Casey was the new guy in town in July/August 2006 when he set his eyes on Theresa. Jared first met Theresa when she spilled her drink on Jared at the Blue Note night club. Jared became irate and began to argue with Theresa. Later he apologized and asked Theresa to dance; she agreed in order to annoy Gwen by making Ethan jealous. The two had a tense early relationship, with Jared repeatedly making claims and remarks that Theresa perceived as being chauvinistic, materialistic, or otherwise intolerant, a fact which was complicated by Jared's failure to recognize Theresa as the CEO of Crane Industries; but, once the case of mistaken identity was overcome, he gradually proved to her that she had been oversensitive. She gave him a chance to help her move on from Ethan, as well as what had been earmarked as Ethan's job as head legal counsel at Crane Industries, and he gave her romance, attention, and the pet name \"Tess,\" which she initially didn't care for. The arc of their relationship from the time they met in the late summer 2006, until Jared proposed to Theresa at Kay and Fox's wedding around New Year's 2007, was characterized by Theresa's conviction that Jared would be the man who finally allowed her to get over Ethan Winthrop. However, Ethan's jealousy of Jared and conviction that the man was a liar and a criminal who was hiding a significant secret led to Ethan's frequent interference in Theresa's relationship with her new beau; Jared, in that time, broke off his relationship with \"Tess\" multiple times, believing she was still pining for her old flame.\n\nThe Blackmailer[]\n\nVincent Clarkson threatens Theresa in his unusual man/woman blackmailer persona In January 2007, Harmony's \"Nightstalker\" (who is presumed to be the same entity alternately referred to as \"the peeping tom\", \"the rapist\", \"the blackmailer\", and \"the half-man/half-woman\") put Ethan in a potion-induced trance, whereupon Ethan drove across town, crawled into bed with Theresa and began making love to her in the darkness. The pair were caught by Jared and Gwen; Gwen decided to leave Ethan and filed for divorce, while Jared, believing Theresa's claim that, in the darkness, she'd believed she was making love to him and not Ethan, insisted that Theresa file sexual assault charges. When Theresa refused, Jared left her, accurately perceiving that she still had feelings for her ex. Shortly thereafter, Ethan and Jane moved into the Crane mansion with Theresa, and Theresa and Ethan discussed starting anew with one another now that they were both free. With Gwen out of the picture, Theresa prepared to tell Ethan the truth - that her son was also his, and not Julian Crane's. The idyll, however, was short-lived; Theresa realized she needed her son's Crane status to hold onto the money and resources necessary to save her brothers' lives, as the blackmailer, who had framed Theresa's brothers for crimes they were innocent of, used his knowledge of Theresa's secret and the power he had over her brothers' futures to coerce her into leaving Ethan - whom the blackmailer wants for himself - and marrying Jared.\n\nTheresa stalled, making desperate efforts to recover the evidence of her secret, hiring manipulative tabloid reporter Vincent, and even telling Jared that she was being blackmailed and enlisting his help. Jared made contact with mysterious \"old friends\", entering what he cryptically described as a \"deal with the devil\" to try to help her, but ended up getting shot in the abdomen, probably by the blackmailer, for his efforts. Eventually, Theresa was out of options, and in April 2007 was coerced into marrying Jared and attempting to conceive his child, much to Ethan's dismay. Jared remained ignorant about his bride's lack of enthusiasm about their marriage and family, and also did not know that Ethan and Theresa had continued their affair, with Ethan repeatedly insisting that Theresa divorce Jared as soon as he managed to exonerate her brothers and reveal the blackmailer's identity. Because Ethan and Theresa repeatedly ignored the blackmailer's demand that they stay away from one another, they were violently attacked multiple times, including Ethan being tied naked to a chair and molested, Theresa being threatened at knifepoint, Ethan nearly being pressed to death between two walls, and Ethan and Theresa being trapped inside the burning Crane Mausoleum.\n\nTheresa found herself in an unenviable position, wanting both to help her brothers and to protect her secret, in part because she doesn't trust Ethan to forgive her for keeping the secret when he finds out. Despite Theresa's secret and the fact that both she and Ethan remain married to other people, Theresa accepted Ethan's proposal of marriage on June 27, 2007; upon finding out about her continued relationship with Ethan, Jared gracefully bowed out of the picture and wished Theresa every happiness, while Ethan's wife, Gwen, has also signed her divorce papers. Increasingly, Theresa's refusal to tell Ethan her secret seems more motivated by fear of his reaction than fear of the Blackmailer or fear for her brothers. Her situation is complicated by the fact that as many people in Harmony know her secret as don't; while Ethan remains in the dark, people who know that he is Little Ethan's father include Whitney, Pilar, Chad, Kay, Tabitha, Paloma, Julian, Eve, Father Lonigan, Luis, Jared, Vincent, and, perhaps most pressingly for Theresa (who is being encouraged on all fronts to tell Ethan the truth), Gwen and Rebecca, who have committed to using Theresa's secret to destroy her relationship with Ethan. Theresa was almost killed in the electric chair at Harmony's prison by Sheridan working on the Blackmailer's orders but was inadvertently saved from death by Gwen.\n\nNBC Finale[]\n\nOn August 17, 2007, it was revealed that Alistair was in fact alive; it was soon established that Alistair had not only been responsible for twisting grandson Vincent's already fragile psyche but had also been behind Vincent's actions as the Blackmailer. Vincent told Alistair of the secret that he had learned - that Little Ethan had been fathered by Ethan, not Julian - and Alistair was enraged that Theresa had duped him. Theresa finally married Ethan on August 20, 2007. Gwen tried to stop the wedding and honeymoon by telling Ethan the truth, but was stopped by Alistair, who wanted to keep Little Ethan's real paternity a secret to protect his corporate interests. Alistair's attempt to poison Theresa (with Rebecca and Gwen's help) put Ethan in a coma instead. With Alistair known known to be alive, Rebecca noted in the August 23, 2007 episode that \"if Alistair's not dead, then Theresa's marriage to Ethan is not legal. She is a bigamist\". Alistair reminded Theresa that he was her legal husband and, fearful of being made a laughingstock for making an non-Crane his heir, threatened to harm her if she told anyone about Little Ethan's paternity.\n\nOn August 29, 2007, Theresa finally revealed to an unconscious Ethan that he had a son during his hospitalization for the poisoning. The next day a nurse told Theresa that she believed Ethan could indeed hear everything Theresa said. Theresa tested this by asking Ethan to squeeze her hand, which he did. After Ethan woke up from his coma, he revealed he had heard Theresa's revelation that he has a son (although she had failed to mention his son's name or that she was the mother). The two were overjoyed. Theresa finally asked Pilar to go get Little Ethan. As Pilar and Little Ethan walked in to the hospital room, Gwen entered with a surprise. She handed Ethan a baby boy and said, \"This is your son, our son, yours and mine.\" The NBC run of Passions ended with Ethan holding the baby, Gwen smirking at her rival, and Theresa looking horrified.\n\nDirecTV storylines[]\n\nDevastated to learn Gwen allegedly had a son, Jonathan Winthrop, with Ethan, Theresa once again decided to tell the truth of her son's paternity only to be threatened by Gwen and Alistair into backing down. Ever relentless, Theresa planned on telling Ethan until her own mother begged her not to, eventually admitting that Gwen and Rebecca were blackmailing her because of her involvement in the massacre of the Vasquez family in Mexico twenty-five years before. An embittered Juanita Vasquez blamed Pilar, and threatened to exterminate the entire Lopez family, just as Juanita's had been. Theresa could not tell Ethan the truth even when Jonathan in need of a liver donor needed the help of a sibling. When Jane failed to be compatible, Theresa arranged for her son Little Ethan to be used in the procedure. Unfortunately, to protect Little Ethan's paternity, she had to keep telling Ethan lies, alienating and infuriating him. Gwen took advantage of the situation by telling Ethan that Theresa had another lover. Theresa's memorial plaque, from the April 1, 2008 episode Theresa, not wanting to lose Ethan, traveled to Mexico and was captured by Juanita, who had acquired a vast fortune after taking over the drug cartel of her deceased husband Carlos Vasquez. The massacre had left Juanita determined to revenge herself upon the entire Lopez-Fitzgerald family. She threatened Theresa with a loaded gun after hearing her life story, and later used her as bait in order to trick her mother into coming to Mexico as well. After making their escape from Juanita's compound, Theresa and Pilar made it to a wharf where Theresa found a boat the pair planned to use to escape Mexico. Believing they had escaped, Juanita fired a rocket at their boat and it exploded, leaving Pilar injured and Theresa missing. Ethan and Luis, who along with Miguel had followed Theresa and Pilar to Mexico in order to attempt to protect them, both swam to the wreckage where Pilar was recovered and taken back to shore, while Theresa struggled to keep herself alive in the shark infested waters. Ethan and Theresa were briefly reunited only to have Theresa pulled further out to sea as Ethan was pulled under and caught in the wreckage. As everyone awaited news of Theresa's fate, Tabitha and Kay watched as Theresa tried to get the attention of her family only to find it was her ghost struggling to communicate with them. Finally a rescue worker came with news that Theresa's bloody and torn blouse had washed up on shore and her family was grief-stricken by the news. In a rare soliloquy, Ethan credited Theresa with having made him into the man he was, promised to raise her children, and bade her farewell on the wharf. Theresa disguised as Gertrude, from the June 30, 2008 episodeOn March 4, 2008, it was revealed that Theresa is alive and wasn't eaten alive by sharks. She was saved by DEA agents presumably looking to prosecute Juanita and was placed into protective custody; however, Theresa quickly escaped and met up with a Mexican woman with a plan to enter the United States illegally via a freight train, eventually returning to Harmony. She then infiltrated the Crane mansion disguised as a frumpy nanny named Gertrude. Little Ethan and Pilar realized that Gertrude was really Theresa, but were persuaded to keep quiet for the sake of the family's staying below Juanita's radar. While in disguise, Theresa drugged Ethan and made love with him, narrowly escaping being caught by Gwen. In the last days leading up to the finale, Ethan planned to renew his wedding vows to Gwen as a means of providing a mother for Jane, Little Ethan, and Jonathan; meanwhile, \"Gertrude\" plotted ineffectually to disrupt the ceremony and Pilar made arrangements to remove her entire family from Harmony to evade Juanita as soon as the weddings were over. On the day of the triple wedding ceremonies, while a volcanic eruption threatened the city in the aftermath of the first two weddings, Theresa found Juanita, dressed as a nun, planting a bomb in the church basement. Juanita overpowered Theresa and chained her to a pillar as Gwen and Ethan renewed their marriage in the third ceremony in the main sanctuary one floor over Theresa's head.\n\nJust after making his vows, however, Ethan sensed Theresa was in danger and rushed to the basement to find her. Theresa and Ethan were finally reunited in the August 4, 2008 episode of Passions. Theresa was still chained to the building as Luis apprehended Juanita and the timer on the bomb ticked inexorably toward zero. Ethan and Theresa's family refused to abandon her, nor would their spouses abandon any of them, and so nearly all of Harmony was crowded into that basement. Ethan, in possession of heretofore undisclosed wiring expertise, stopped the bomb a scant few seconds before it would have gone off. But Ethan and Theresa's problems continued as Ethan was reminded by Gwen of his vows. Ethan withdrew reluctantly from Theresa as Sheridan and others pleaded with Gwen to be merciful and release Ethan from his marital obligation. Upstairs, Little Ethan worked steadily to fix Sam Bennett's broken camera, which had recorded Gwen and Rebecca making a full confession to the extent of their collusion against Theresa and lies to Ethan over the previous decade. Rebecca attempted to stop him, but he evaded her and rushed down to the basement. The video camera was attached to a television and played for all the wedding guests Gwen and Rebecca's confession of their roles in framing Theresa for the tabloid scandal seven years before. An indignant Ethan rejected Gwen and announced that not only was he leaving her, but that he and Theresa would be raising her son, Jonathan. Sam and Luis then arrested Gwen and Rebecca on charges including fraud, bribery, and accessory status in the murder of Pilar's sister and nephews in Mexico as well as everyone in the basement of the church. With Juanita caught and Gwen's threats neutralized, Theresa also seized the opportunity to tell Ethan the truth about Little Ethan; Ethan reacted with joy, and the family was united at last. Gwen and Rebecca began arguing over a trip to Las Vegas some years before which Gwen didn't remember, and it was revealed that Gwen had drunkenly married an unknown stranger, to whom she was still legally bound. Because this happened before Gwen's marriage to Ethan in 2002, that marriage was nullified. Theresa and Ethan were finally married in a church ceremony as they both had dreamed of, in front of family and friends at St. Margaret Mary's church on August 7, 2008, in the final scene of Passions.\n\nOverall Character Summary[]\n\nThe elder of the Lopez-Fitzgerald daughters, Theresa has been the apple of not only her mother's but her brothers' eyes and Her Cousin Elijah Ray Sanders as well. After her father disappeared when she was three, she was raised primarily by her older brother Antonio, as her mother worked two jobs to support them. Antonio disappeared when she was thirteen, and Luis took over as her surrogate father. When she was a teenager, Theresa began cutting photographs of Ethan Crane out of magazines and putting them on her walls, convinced that one day Ethan would come to Harmony, fall in love with her, and she would live happily ever after in the Crane mansion. Her belief in this was so strong that she refused every date she was asked out, saving herself for Ethan, whom at that time she had never met. Theresa thought her dreams were finally coming true when Ethan came to town the summer before her senior year. The only drawback was that he brought his long-time girlfriend Gwen Hotchkiss with him, a woman Theresa had never met, but had disliked for years because she was with Ethan. Theresa was nervous around Ethan, and a number of rather smelly accidents ensued. Theresa was convinced that if she could just get Ethan alone she could explain everything, but when she snuck into his room, she ended up overhearing him tell Gwen that people like her were just gold-diggers, and hearing Gwen try to defend her. That didn't dissuade her in her plans to have a future with Ethan...when Ivy offered her a job as her social secretary, she soon accepted, thinking it would be the perfect way to get close to Ethan so that he would realize they belonged together.\n\nWhen Ethan realized Theresa was the girl who was dropping smelly sauces on him, he planned to have her arrested and charged with stalking, but Whitney explained that Theresa was just nervous around him, and they denied that Theresa had any romantic interest in Ethan. When Ethan assumed that Theresa had a boyfriend she let him believe it, knowing that Gwen was suspicious of her, and that if Ethan and Gwen knew she didn't have a boyfriend, they wouldn't let her spend time with them, particularly Ethan. Theresa was thrilled when Julian asked her to deliver some papers to Ethan up at the Crane cabin, and she told the driver to leave after he dropped her off so she could spend time alone with Ethan. It didn't last long, though, because Gwen soon showed up for the romantic weekend she and Gwen had planned. Gwen was getting more and more suspicious, and demanded that Theresa produce her boyfriend. Theresa planned to meet them at the Seascape, and spent her life's savings on a dress to impress Ethan. Her plan was to trip a waiter and have him drop soup on Gwen, have her go ballistic, and Ethan would realize she [Theresa] was the woman for him, and there would be no need to produce a boyfriend. Unfortunately, Gwen was extremely gracious. Theresa was saved when Whitney had a friend pose as her boyfriend, Chuck. Gwen apologized for her suspicions, and Ethan apologized for attacking Theresa moments earlier and accusing her of lying to get close to him.\n\nTheresa began to despair of Ethan ever realizing that they were meant for each other, especially once she found out that Ethan planned to ask Gwen to marry him! He took Theresa with him to help him pick a ring for Gwen, and when the ring was stuck on Theresa's finger, she believed it was fate. The ring was stuck for days, and when Gwen caught a glimpse of it and asked about it, Theresa told her that she and Chuck were engaged to be married. The whole group of them ended up at the lake on Valentine's Day, where Theresa toyed with showing Gwen the ring, wanting to speed up her future with Ethan. Whitney had to stop her from flashing the ring, and before she could do it again, she learned that Charity had fallen through the ice. Charity was rescued, but then Miguel fell in. Theresa was a vital part in her brother's rescue, and vowed to God that she would stop coming between Ethan and Gwen unless Ethan made it clear that he wanted her. That night, when Ethan phoned her to ask if the ring had come off yet so he could give it to his new fiancée Gwen, Theresa lied to him. Even though the ring was off, she said it was still stuck. She went to the mansion the next day because she was convinced that by now Ethan and Gwen would be finished and she and Ethan could start their life together, but when she saw how deeply in love with Gwen he was, and how it was hurting him to think of losing her, she took the ring off her finger and gave it to him. Gwen was ecstatic, but Theresa was heartbroken.\n\nTheresa's pain was so intense she couldn't hide it from those around her. It was only a matter of time before Gwen wanted to know what was going on, and Theresa told her that Chuck had dumped her because of her family's financial status. When Ethan and Gwen asked her to plan their wedding, she put up a small protest, but soon took the job. As she told Whitney, being their wedding planner and pretending to be Gwen's friend would be the perfect way to show Ethan that they were meant to be together. While Gwen was out of town, Theresa and Ethan took a trip to Bermuda to check out a resort for Gwen and Ethan's honeymoon. When she got home and Luis saw all the expensive clothes Ethan had bought for her in Bermuda, he was furious, until he decided they were probably just hand-me-downs from the Cranes two daughters. Theresa thought that she had finally shown Ethan that they were meant to be together, but he continued his plans to wed Gwen. She finally confessed that she loved him aboard the prom boat, but Ethan wouldn't listen to her. He told her she was just on the rebound after what Chuck did to her. When Gwen asked her later, Theresa lied to Gwen and told her that she had no interest in Ethan at all. But she couldn't stop thinking about Ethan, and when he told her there was no chance for them, she hopped on Miguel's motorcycle and took off. She was driving in the on-coming traffic lane when she realized the brakes were out, and nearly had a head-on collision with a trucker.\n\nTheresa woke up in the hospital to Ethan telling her he loved her, and the two of them sharing their first real kiss. Theresa begins to believe the two of them will share a future together, until Ethan tells her it's not quite that simple...he still loves Gwen. When Rebecca attacks Theresa, Gwen defends her, convinced that her friend would never hurt her like that. This goes on for months, Rebecca attacking Theresa, Gwen defending Theresa, and Theresa and Ethan taking advantage of every stolen moment, until the eve of Gwen and Ethan's wedding. Rebecca told Theresa that Ethan was just using her, and a heart-broken Theresa went back home, planning to leave town. While pulling a suitcase out of the closet, another suitcase fell, this one containing Ivy's letter to Sam about Ethan's paternity! Theresa was shocked to learn that Ethan was a Bennett, and immediately scanned the documents into the laptop she used for her work as Ivy's secretary. She planned to take the information to Ivy so that Ivy would make Ethan break up with Gwen and marry her. She changed her mind, deciding instead to tell Sam Bennett the truth, but her mother stopped her. After promising Pilar that she wouldn't go anywhere, Theresa took advantage of Rebecca's offer to leave Harmony, and headed to the airport.\n\nWhile on the plane, Theresa talked to a fellow passenger, and decided to hurt Ethan for what he'd put her through. She set up her computer with the letter and planned to send it to the tabloids. Just as she was about to send the information, the stewardess came by, and made Theresa turn off the computer. Theresa continued to wait for takeoff as there was a commotion outside...Ethan had come to tell her that he loved her! After agreeing to Gwen's idea of double-dating, Theresa and Ethan shared a romantic date at the Harmony carnival, before each going home. Earlier that evening, she had planned to tell Ethan the truth about his paternity, convinced Ethan would be hers if he weren't a Crane, but she changed her mind. When she learned Sheridan was dead she rushed to the mansion to comfort him, but was told to leave by Julian. She went home, and the next morning, was trying to send Ivy's letter to Ethan when Pilar stopped her. Theresa's dreams finally came true when Ethan proposed to her at the Church at Christmas Eve. Although Pilar begged her to erase the letter, Theresa refused. She wasn't sure if she still didn't need it. When Pilar told her that Rebecca would never forget Theresa's role in Ethan and Gwen's break-up, Theresa erased the letter from her computer. When her hard drive crashed a few weeks later, she was terrified that Ethan had found the information, but in reality, it was only a love poem she'd written about him.\n\nOn the day of their engagement party, the truth about Ethan's paternity was revealed in the tabloids. Theresa handed over all the money she saved as Gwen and Ethan's wedding planner to him, telling him it was an investment in their future. They continued to plan their wedding, and luckily, Luis and Sheridan finally got together, and they had a double wedding all planned. The day of the wedding, the tabloid published the information on which e-mail address the letter had come from...Theresa's! The wedding was in a state of chaos and Theresa ran off, spending the night at Whitney's. Ethan tried to convince Theresa that he still loved her and wanted to marry her, but she wasn't listening. She decided that the only way she could make things right was to get Julian Crane to adopt Ethan. She went down to Bermuda, where Julian was celebrating his divorce from Ivy, and the two of them ended up drunk...and married! She was horrified to realize she had married Ethan's stepfather, and vowed to keep it a secret forever. Unfortunately, she soon realized she was pregnant...and after Theresa attacked her with a firepoker to keep the marriage hidden, Ivy told Ethan everything. When Julian suggested an annulment she eagerly signed the papers, and she swore to Ethan that she never slept with Julian, promising that she would never lie to him again. She was planning to tell Ethan the baby was his, but she soon realized that she was not far enough along for that to work. So she chose a new route. She decided to have an abortion, to keep Ethan from ever finding out what she had broken her promise.\n\nOn New Year's Eve, the tabloid reporter announced that Theresa was pregnant, and that she had been seen at an abortion clinic. Theresa soon told everyone that she didn't have the abortion. Ethan automatically assumed the baby was his, and it broke Theresa's heart when she had to tell him that the baby belonged to Julian. When he realized she lied to him again, Ethan walked out on her. That same evening, Julian Crane was shot and presumed dead. Despondent, Theresa went down to the docks. As she stood on the pier, she realized that she had lost Ethan, and decided to commit suicide. She jumped into the water, and died...her soul going straight to Hell, where Julian (Zombie Charity in disguise) convinced her to sell her soul to the devil and make a pact with the darkside. After agreeing, Theresa was returned to life. Theresa soon began fulfilling her end of the bargain, although it was never revealed what her end was. She proclaimed herself Mrs. Julian Crane and moved into the mansion, trying to kick out Ivy and Rebecca, who both fought her in court for the title of Mrs. Julian Crane. Theresa won because the judge had been bought off by Alistair. When Theresa saw a video of Ethan killing Julian, she immediately confessed to the crime. She was convinced that they would never send a Crane to jail, and thought that if Ethan knew she was willing to take the blame for his crime, he would break things off with Gwen and come back to her. Her plan backfired when she was sentenced to death. Ethan helped her escape from the hospital, but when she began dreaming of their future together, he was quick to tell her that he had no plans to be with her. She had broken her word to him too many times, and he was back with Gwen.\n\nThey managed to make it to the cabin, but Theresa was in trouble...she had been hiding the fact that she was in labor because she needed time to convince Ethan that they belonged together. She was furious when Gwen showed up. Theresa watched as Gwen and Ethan shared a passionate reunion, and their connection drove her to the brink of madness. She stabbed Gwen in the back with a pair of scissors, and then went after Ethan. Both tried to stop her; they knew that she was suffering from a medical condition that was affecting her perception. They managed to get her on the couch, where she gave birth. Theresa was astonished the first time she held her son; for months she had resented the baby, blaming both the child and Julian for coming between her and Ethan, but the moment she held her son she fell in love with him, and immediately regretted that she even considered getting rid of him. Ethan and Gwen got her to the hospital, but it didn't save her. Only days after the birth of her son (whom she named Ethan Martin), Theresa was executed. And only days after she was executed, she came back from the dead. She needed to pretend to be dead so that Julian would feel safe coming back to Harmony. Although Julian wanted to get to know his son, she refused, and denied him any access because she blamed him for her break-up with Ethan. She immediately moved herself into the bedroom next to Ethan and Gwen, making plans to use the connecting door to re-establish her relationship with Ethan. Unfortunately, Ethan had moved on with Gwen. Despite Theresa's best attempts to convince Ethan that they were meant to be together, Ethan stayed with Gwen. Theresa believed she finally had the love she dreamed of when Ethan intimated that he was going to ask her to marry him, but then he asked Gwen to marry him.\n\nTheresa wasn't ready to give up on love. She made Alistair give her a position as vice-president of Crane Industries, and used that power to make sure that no one would hire Ethan. If Ethan had to work for Crane, he was bound to realize that their love was too strong to be denied. Theresa also knew that Gwen didn't want Ethan working for Crane Industries. She arranged to have the papers validiating his employment delivered to the Church on their wedding day, and watched in anticipation as Gwen slapped Ethan across the face and walked out on him. When Gwen accused her of having something to do with it, she denied any involvement. Her heart breaks as she watches Gwen and Ethan get married. Before Theresa can focus too much on the pain of losing Ethan again, Fox Crane shows up in her bed! The two soon become fast friends. When Ivy tries to say Theresa pushed her down the stairs at the Bennett house, Theresa vows revenge on the Cranes for everything they have done to her, and launches a plan to destroy the Cranes by giving away all their money. Just as she is doing that, Julian drops a bombshell on her...they're not legally married! Theresa swore he was lying; she had eventually remembered all the details of that night, and she knew they were married. But it turns out that it was all a joke perpetrated by Julian's friend Bruce. Theresa was shocked when she realized that he was right; Julian had never actually consented to marry her, and it was only she who had said 'I do'. Julian immediately kicked Theresa out of the mansion, and turned the tables on her when he produced a writ of custody for little Ethan. Theresa was able to take the baby to Sheridan's cottage, since it, like the house, was owned by Alistair, and the writ stated only that Little Ethan could not leave the estate.\n\nTheresa was terrified when Julian made it clear that he was going to fight for custody of his son, but she still refused to bend...Julian was not allowed anywhere near little Ethan. Julian finally caved and allowed Theresa to leave the grounds with her son, and she moved back in with her mother. Theresa was both thrilled and upset to learn that Gwen was having problems with her pregnancy. Theresa felt in her soul that the moment that baby was born Ethan would realize he made a huge mistake by marrying Gwen and leave Gwen and the baby to be with her, and Theresa felt that if the baby did die, Ethan would leave Gwen right away, but at the same time, she knew how horrible it would be to wish a baby dead so you could be with it's father. She left Harmony for Los Angeles, promising her mother that she would do nothing to interfere with Gwen and Ethan's relationship, because Theresa knew that any stress on Gwen could cause the baby to die prematurely, and she did not want to be responsible for the death of Ethan's first child. Unfortunately, when Theresa learned that Ethan and Gwen had left Harmony to see a specialist in Los Angeles (and to get away from Theresa, whom they did not realize had left town), Theresa decided that fate wanted her to be with Ethan, and formed a pact with Fox to scheme and manipulate to break up not only Ethan and Gwen, but also to break up the relationship of the girl Fox loves (Theresa does not realize it is her best friend Whitney she is scheming against).\n\nAlthough Theresa and Ethan shared a few kisses, Ethan made it clear that he was committed to his wife. Theresa refused to listen, convinced that the only reason Ethan was pretending that he was going to stay with Gwen was because of the stress that Gwen was under with her pregnancy. When Gwen showed up at the complex to see Ethan, Theresa was sitting at the pool and the two ran into each other. They had an argument at the apartment complex, and Theresa made it clear to Gwen that she was going to be with Ethan, and that Ethan would be leaving her and the baby. Theresa pushed Gwen away when Gwen launched herself at her, and Gwen fell, striking her head. She was rushed to the hospital, where despite the requests of Ethan and the hospital staff, Theresa refused to leave. Even Pilar, via the phone from Harmony, told Theresa that her obsession with Ethan had caused all this pain and reminded Theresa of her promise, but Theresa refused.\n\nWhen the doctor told Ethan he could only save Gwen or the baby, Theresa encouraged Ethan to let Gwen die, telling him that he had to save the baby, because that's what she would do, that's what the Church says to do. Ethan told her she was a heartless, selfish monster. Theresa then went into the hospital room, and promised Gwen that she would raise her baby with Ethan after Gwen's death. She was hustled out by security. Even after Ethan's daughter died, Theresa insisted on being there, even going into Gwen's room to be with Ethan, despite everyone asking her to leave. When it sunk in that Ethan's daughter was really dead, Theresa began to have new hope...she saw the baby's death as fate's way of bringing her and Ethan back together. Ethan has told her over and over again he wants nothing to do with her, but Theresa maintains hope that he will realize that without a child, there is no reason for him to tie himself to Gwen and he will come back to her.\n\nUpon returning home to Harmony, Theresa was left to face the wrath not only of the Hotchkiss and Crane families, but her own mother. Pilar was disgusted by what happened in L.A., particularly because Theresa had promised her that she would not do anything to endanger Gwen and Ethan's marriage or their child. She received the ultimate shock when Julian and Rebecca announced that they would be exercising Julian's custodial rights and taking Ethan Martin from her. Despite being asked not to by Ethan, Theresa crashed Sarah's funeral, demanding that Ethan help her in her battle against Julian. She was shocked when he refused. This event led to Theresa to claim she hated Ethan, and when Chad observed that he thought Fox loved her, Theresa decided that she would marry Fox, and mused to Whitney that with Fox, she would know her financial future was secure.\n\nDespite being ordered by a judge to stay away from her son after she attempted to kidnap him from the Crane mansion, Theresa couldn't be without her little boy, and continued to violate the court order by seeing him at the mansion. On one of these trips she ran into Rebecca. The two got into an argument, where Theresa told Rebecca that her hold on the Crane fortune was tenuous because of Julian's obvious lack of love for her, but with Fox and her son, she (Theresa) would always be a part of the Crane family. When Rebecca told her that her son would one day be a Crane servant to her own grandchildren, Theresa lashed back by stating that she hoped that Gwen and Ethan would never be able to have any children. When she realized that Gwen and Ethan knew about her heartless words, she was desperate to apologize to Gwen, realising how horrible her words were. Gwen begged Theresa to leave her alone, but Theresa insisted on apologizing. It all went wrong when Theresa told Gwen that God had punished her for marrying Ethan by killing her daughter, and that Gwen had deserved for her baby to die. Tired of asking Theresa to leave her alone, Gwen tried to remove Theresa from the room bodily. When Theresa, not ready to leave, fought with Gwen, she ended up going out the window!\n\nIn a court of law, Theresa was shocked when the judge ruled in her favor in regards to the custody of Little Ethan. Unfortunately, when she attacked Gwen and Rebecca outside the courtroom, the judge saw what she did, and he changed his decision, agreeing with children's services recommendation that her parental rights be severed. Theresa was further devastated when a different judge agreed to Ethan and Gwen's petition to adopt Little Ethan, and change his name to Ethan Winthrop Jr. Theresa finally decided that the only way to get Little Ethan back was to arrange to have herself implanted with Ethan and Gwen's fertilized egg. Even though she had not had any of the hormone treatments, Theresa kidnapped Heather (the planned surrogate) and locked her in a closet while she impersonated her at the hospital and was implanted with the eggs. She lost the embryo only a few days later, and when Fox would not sleep with her (she was planning to pass his child with her off as Ethan and Gwen's baby), she stole an experimental date rape drug from Eve Russell and after slipping it to Ethan, slipped on Gwen's nightie, spritzed her with her perfume, and donned a blonde wig, then proceeded to rape Ethan with her mother's help.\n\nLuckily for Theresa her plan worked, and she became pregnant. While continuing to pretend that the child belonged to Ethan and Gwen, she began her attempts at blackmailing them, threatening them that if they did not give her Little Ethan, she would take their child and never let them see it. As time went on, she began to change her mind, deciding that not only would she force Ethan and Gwen to give her Little Ethan, but she would also keep the child that she had told them all along was their child. However, she continued to tell Gwen and Ethan she would give them the baby. When she learned she was carrying twins, her mother reminded her that one or both of those babies could be biologically Gwen's, yet Theresa stated that she would keep those babies regardless of who the biological mother was stated to be. When the doctors told her that she could not possibly carry both to term, she planned to have DNA tests done on the babies and abort the child that was not biologically hers, but Ethan convinced her to let the doctors make the choice and to let whichever baby was healthier live. She did, but was convinced that the surviving baby belonged to her and Ethan. She continued promising to give the child to Ethan and Gwen, who were eagerly awaiting having that baby in their home.\n\nAfter the baby was born, though, Theresa made it clear she had no intentions on giving that child to Gwen and Ethan. When she announced that the child could be biologically hers, Gwen was horrified to realize that Theresa had drugged and slept with her husband (only Theresa, Pilar and Whitney know that it was rape), and that the baby might really belong to her. They waited for the DNA tests, and Gwen was destroyed when the tests proved that the child was Theresa's. Theresa was thrilled, and saw this as proof that she and Ethan were meant to be together. Unfortunately, Gwen had finally had enough and snapped, stabbing Theresa in the back with a scalpel. Theresa lost feeling in her legs and was determined to press charges against Gwen (unlike Gwen and Ethan, who had refused to press charges when a mentally imbalanced Theresa had attacked them a few years earlier). With Gwen behind bars, Theresa was convinced that she was that much closer to breaking up their marriage and getting Ethan. Not willing to let fate do the work for her, though, Theresa manipulated the situation, going so far as to fake falling down in the shower so that Ethan would have to come in to help her, and see her naked.\n\nWhen Jane needed to be taken to the hospital, Theresa and Ethan were devastated when the baby disappeared, taken by Gwen. While waiting for word on their child, Theresa did everything she could to get Ethan to come to her again. Ethan continued to resist her advances, and when she and Ethena found Gwen with the baby at the Crane compound, Ethan made a deal with her. He would not fight for custody of the baby as he had planned if she would not press charges against Gwen. He reminded her of the many time he and Gwen had not pressed charges against her, and Theresa promised not to press charges. He warned her that if she broke her promise, he would fight for custody of Jane as he had originally planned.\n\nWhen they returned to Harmony, Theresa broke her promise to Ethan and pressed charges against Gwen, convinced that if she could get Gwen sent to prison that Ethan would have no choice but to turn to her. Ethan made good on his word as well -- he followed through with his original plan to fight for custody. Gwen was found not guilty due to a medical interaction, and Theresa lost custody of Jane. Initially temporary, Gwen and Ethan soon had full rights. Theresa would not stop in her quest to get both Ethan and Jane back. When her numerous attempts to seduce Ethan didn't work, she married Alistair Crane in the hopes of getting Jane back, and inevitably Ethan. She made a deal with Alistair that she would do whatever he wanted, including sleep with him, in exchange for being Mrs. Alistair Crane. Alistair legally adopted her son, changing his name to Ethan Lopez-Fitzgerald Crane, and Theresa began a time of terror as his wife, with many of their sexual encounters being forced on Alistair's behalf.\n\nTheresa also continued her plots to destroy Ethan and Gwen's marriage. When Ethan wouldn't bow to her wishes, she made certain that he could not get a job anywhere, and arranged for Gwen to get a job that would keep her away from home, and Ethan. So determined was she to get Ethan that she flew to Rome to locate the tabloid editor who had initially printed the story about Ethan's paternity. She found J.T. Cornell in Rome and convinced him to spill the beans for ten million dollars, but Ethan refused to believe him, considering what Theresa had offered to pay him.\n\nEducation[]\n\nHarmony High School (graduated 2000)\n\nCrimes Committed[]\n\nAccused of stalking Ethan Winthrop (then Crane)\n\nBroke into the Crane mansion on numerous occasions\n\nBroke into the Crane cabin during the ski trip.\n\nAttacked Ivy (in her wheelchair) with a firepoker to keep her from telling Ethan about her marriage to Julian\n\nSlapped Julian Crane [Oct 26, 2001]\n\nConvicted and \"executed\" for the murder of Julian (presumably not guilty, it's still on her record)\n\nStabbed Gwen Hotchkiss in the back twice with scissors (side-effect of preeclampsia) [Jun 19, 2002]\n\nStabbed Ethan in the arm with scissors (side-effect of preeclampsia) [Jun 20, 2002]\n\nShoved Julian [Aug 2, 2002]\n\nSlapped Julian [Aug 29, 2002]\n\nSlapped Rebecca [Nov 27, 2002]\n\nSlapped Ivy [Nov 27, 2002]\n\nSlapped Julian [Nov 27, 2002]\n\nPlanned to kill both Rebecca And Julian\n\nBlackballed Ethan to make sure no one would hire him to force him to work at Crane Industries\n\nBlackmailed Ethan's head hunter to get him to ruin Ethan professionally by threatening to render his family homeless\n\nSlapped Sven [Aug 4, 2003]\n\nSlapped Ethan [Dec 29, 2003]\n\nKidnapped Little Ethan from the Crane mansion (more than once)\n\nContinually trespassing on the Crane grounds despite a court order barring her from the premise\n\nKidnapped Little Ethan and attempted to leave the country\n\nSlapped Ethan [Feb 2, 2004]\n\nImpersonated a doctor to get close to Ethan and Gwen's surrogate [Apr 16, 2004]\n\nChloroformed Heather Downs, locked her in the closet, and impersonated her in order to have herself implanted with Ethan and Gwen's embryo so she could force them to give her Little Ethan in exchange for their baby [Apr 16-21, 2004]\n\nDrugged Ethan with a date rape drug while impersonating Gwen so she could get pregnant and trade the unborn child for Little Ethan [May 10, 2004]\n\nFalsely signed documents agreeing to give the twins to Gwen and Ethan with no intent of doing so\n\nSlapped and then punched Gwen, knocking her unconscious [Apr 13, 2005]\n\nSlapped Ethan [May 11, 2005]\n\nDefied a court order stating she must relinquish custody of Jane Winthrop temporarily to Ethan by locking them in her room [May 26, 2005]\n\nSlapped Ethan [Jun 8, 2005]\n\nSlapped Alistair Crane [Jul 4, 2005]\n\nSlapped Alistair [Aug 29, 2005]\n\nTried to push Gwen into an incinerator [Sep 15, 2005]\n\nSlapped Ethan [Oct 11, 2005]\n\nDrugged Alistair [Oct 21, 2005]\n\nTried to smother Alistair with a pillow [Oct 21-22, 2005]\n\nSlapped Alistair [Oct 28, 2005]\n\nAccidently drugged Ethan when he ate guacamole she meant for Alistair [Arrested; Oct 28, 2005]\n\nKidnapped a comatose Ethan [Dec 5, 2005]\n\nSlapped Sheridan Crane [Apr 25, 2006]\n\nAttacked Rebecca Hotchkiss with an umbrella in self-defense [Nov 10, 2006]\n\nHit Rebecca on the head with a phone [Nov 10, 2006]\n\nPunched Rebecca [Nov 10, 2006]\n\nSlapped Gwen [Oct 16, 2007]\n\nSlapped her mother, Pilar [Nov 7, 2007]\n\nSlapped Her Cousin Elijah Ray Sanders October 5 2007\n\nTried to Smother Her Cousin Elijah Ray Sanders With a Pillow and Bag\n\nTried to Smother Gwen With a Pillow in Front Elijah Ray Sanders His Face\n\nHealth and Vitals[]\n\nStabbed in the back with a scalpel by Gwen leaving her temporarily paralyzed from the waist down [Dec 31, 2004-Jan 3, 2005]\n\nShot by Alistair Crane (the bullet just grazed her) [Jul 27, 2005]\n\nCaught in a tsunami [Aug 1, 2005]\n\nLost a lot of blood after cutting her leg [Aug 3, 2005]\n\nRaped by Alistair Crane [Aug 31, 2005]\n\nSlapped by Alistair [Oct 10, 2005]\n\nRaped by Alistair again [Oct 10, 2005]\n\nTrivia[]"
