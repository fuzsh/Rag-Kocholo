Neely is supported by his parents, Alanna and Johnny, and his FFA advisors Wesley Foster and Emily Kopko.\n\nEntrepreneurship\n\nHayden Holdgrafer\n\nHayden Holdgrafer of the Easton Valley FFA Chapter in Iowa began his supervised agricultural experience (SAE) by renting acres to grow corn, soybeans and hay.

He is supported by his parents, Kayla and Eric, and his FFA advisor, Dan Dylla.\n\nPremier Chapter: Growing Leaders\n\nBartlesville FFA | Oklahoma\n\nBartlesville FFA facilitated a photo challenge scavenger hunt for members during their monthly chapter meeting. The one-hour group activity, managed by officers, required members to collaborate and accomplish a common goal by completing photo challenges. The activity was beneficial in using critical thinking in a competitive and fun environment, which promoted engagement and leadership development.\n\nPremier Chapter: Strengthening Agriculture\n\nTaylorville FFA | Illinois\n\nTaylorville FFA identified the need for adult role models and established a program called My Mentor. The chapter worked with its alumni and supporters to organize and facilitate this support group involving 137 FFA members and 38 community volunteer leaders. As a result, students gained relationship-building, job interviewing and career skills.\n\nPremier Chapter: Building Communities\n\nStillwater FFA | Oklahoma\n\nStillwater FFA wanted to demonstrate that a little can go a long way. Through their Changing the World with a $5 Bill challenge, 75 participating members were each given $5 (provided through donated funds) and three months to invest in serving the community. This resulted in 405 hours of service, impacting 1,541 community members.\n\nJoshua Bledsoe of the North Carolina FFA Alumni Association has helped maintain the organizationâ€™s structure through his many years of service. As one example, Josh worked diligently and deliberately on a business opportunity to expand the historical footprint of the North Carolina FFA Center in White Lake, N.C. As North Carolinaâ€™s state FFA advisor, Josh has led the growth of FFA student membership throughout the state. This growth has made North Carolina a nationally recognized state association. Still, more importantly, it has allowed more students than ever before to experience the gifts of agricultural education and FFA membership.\n\nAs an alumni member of Canby FFA Alumni and Supporters in Oregon, Swede Salo has been instrumental in recruiting new alumni and increasing existing membersâ€™ engagement. Swede has served as the state regional vice president, president of Oregon FFA Alumni and Supporters, alumni representative on the Oregon FFA Foundation and a founding member of the Oregon FFA Joint Board. While serving in these positions, he has helped strengthen the relationship between the association, alumni and foundation. Swede is the first to volunteer for programs at his local school or any FFA chapter, and his wealth of knowledge makes him invaluable to FFA at all levels.\n\nScott Wood, a member of Middletown FFA Alumni and Supporters in Maryland, has made a positive impact as the alumni chapterâ€™s vice president. He has supported FFA chapter officers through various leadership trainings and activities. Scott has also served as a judge at local, state and National FFA events. His involvement with the Agricultural Technological and Machinery Systems Career Development Event at the state level has caused other members to join the FFA Alumni as judges or coaches, assisting at the highest level. His best attribute is that he leads by example, and when he says he will do it, you can count on it being completed.\n\nAwards such as the Distinguished Service Citation recognize that FFA and its partners make a greater impression on students through the cooperation of the entire community. FFA and agricultural education programs have helped millions of students achieve extraordinary success for over 90 years.\n\nThrough its subsidiaries, AGCO has consistently worked with FFA to build the future of agriculture through its support. The company has supported FFA members through scholarships, grants and, most recently, support for the State Officer Leadership Continuum. AGCO knows the value FFA brings to the talent pipeline and is actively working on ways to hire FFA members. The companyâ€™s leadership is passionate about its involvement with the organization.\n\nFord has supported the National FFA through its many contributions. For the past 25 years, the company has encouraged members through its Built Ford Tough scholarship opportunities. Ford was the first partner to participate in creating a virtual field trip that showcases opportunities to FFA members and how agriculture weaves into the automotive industry and emerging technologies. The company also offers travel assistance grants to chapters to attend the national convention and expo. Ford is involved on the National FFA Foundation Sponsorsâ€™ Board.\n\nThroughout their years of support, Corteva Agriscience has provided numerous educational STEM resources and contributions to the robust FFA tool AgExplorer as members learn about applicable careers in agriculture. In 2017, the company began a corporate FFA Alumni and Supporters chapter that continues to grow. Corteva Agriscience engages FFA members in fun and educational ways, such as participating in the National FFA Expo and supporting the National FFA Band and Chorus and many competitive events. The company is involved on the local, state and national levels and participates on the foundation sponsorsâ€™ board.\n\nNew Holland has been a champion for advancing FFA and agricultural education. They have given over $3 million to FFA on the local, state and national levels. The companyâ€™s presence during the national conventions and expos inspires thousands of students with hands-on experience and exposure to agricultural education. In addition to its monetary support, New Holland offers judges for and input into state and local contests."
