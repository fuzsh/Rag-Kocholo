        "text": "Pilar Lopez-Fitzgerald\n\nShe is the mother of Luis, Antonio, Theresa, Miguel and Paloma. Her husband, Martin Lopez-Fitzgerald used to work at Crane industries until one day he went to work and never returned. Pilar has always hated the Cranes as much or more than her friend and employer Ivy. She has been Ivy's trusted maid and confidant for a very long time and has known all of Ivy's secrets. She has also been the sworn enemy not only of Julian and Alistair but also of Rebecca, Julian's new found love and associate.\n\nOnce Pilar caught Rebecca trying to use Theresa's computer and when she smelled something immediately took the laptop down to her daughter. Pilar always urged Theresa to tell Ethan the truth about how she knew he was a Bennett before it hit the tabloid paper.\n\nUnfortunately Pilar's husband Martin wasn't the only one who disappeared, her second son Antonio soon followed. Her daughter Paloma lives with an aunt.\n\nHer eldest son Luis is engaged to Sheridan Crane and her daughter Theresa is engaged to Ethan Winthrop. Both couples are to be wed on the same day but the double wedding is going to be doubly disastrous. Her youngest son Miguel is engaged and to Grace's twin sister's daughter Charity Standish and they will be married as soon as they turn eighteen. However whilst Ethan and Theresa's love is threatened by Gwen Hotchkiss, Charity and Miguel have Charity's cousin Kay to worry about. Not just her though, Harmony's bad witch Tabitha Lenox is on their tale too.\n\nPilar awaits silently until the secret of her husbands disappearance is uncovered and that will happen only once Luis is married to Sheridan, if that will ever happen.\n\nLuis Lopez-Fitzgerald\n\nLuis is the eldest of Pilar's children and is a police officer and works with Sam Bennett. Luis is also a close friend of Hank Bennett who is Sam's brother and who used to be involved with Sheridan.\n\nHis one goal in life is to find out what happened to his father and he plans on finding that out with Sheridan's help by tapping into the Crane family files.\n\nThe Crane family has many times tried to destroy his love for Sheridan and vice versa. But each time have they failed. But now they have come up with a new scheme and once Luis slips Sheridan her wedding ring she will die instantly of the poison that been sealed into it.\n\nTheresa Lopez-Fitzgerald\n\nKnown to her family as Theresita, this girl has been in love with Ethan Crane long before she even met him. She and Ethan have had a bumpy ride along the way to their marriage and it's about to get even bumpier. Gwen Hotchkiss who is Theresa's sworn enemy for the fact that Ethan gave up his engagement to her because of Theresa together with her mother Rebecca plotted against her and sent an e-mail from Theresa's computer to the tabloids revealing Ethan's true paternity. Rebecca however knew that Theresa had read the letter that Ivy Crane wrote to Sam Bennett and holds this fact as proof that it was Theresa who sent the e-mail.\n\nTheresa also made a promise to her mother that she would not sleep with any man until her wedding day and actually kept it until 12:00 midnight on her wedding day. But as soon as that clock hit twelve Theresa waited no longer and although it was before her wedding she still did not feel that bad because it was the day of her wedding anyway.\n\nTheresa has no idea as to what her wedding holds for her for as she walks down to church her mother-in-law to be is reading the news letter that exposes Theresa as the revelator. On looking at the paper Ivy calls her a \"little bitch\" and marches down to church herself to stop the wedding.\n\nTheresa is also the good friend of Whitney Russell.\n\nMiguel Lopez-Fitzgerald\n\nMiguel is the youngest and finds himself madly in love with Charity. Although many times his close friend Kay has attempted to break them up their love has still held on strong. But their relationship is not a problem to Kay alone. As a prophecy unfolds, if Charity makes love with Miguel then she will come to her full powers and Tabitha and her doll Timmy will be destroyed therefore the two of them and another witch-Heccuba is after them as well."
