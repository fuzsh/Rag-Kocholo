The actress recently appeared in an episode of the CBS primetime drama “CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.”\n\nTerrell joined the “DAYS” cast earlier this year, but got her break in the 2008 film “Get Smart” starring “The Office’s” Steve Carell.” She also appeared in an episode of HBO’s “Entourage.”\n\n“Days of our Lives” airs Weekdays on NBC. Weeknights on SOAPnet. Check local listings."
