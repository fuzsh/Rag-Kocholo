        "text": "I. Hate. Her.\n\nTheresa is a possessed serpeant who is constantly spewing her poison. She doesn't even give a damn about her kids. They're just props in her endless dramas.\n\nShe's a parasitical !@#$%^&*].\n\nLindsay seems to be channeling Joan Crawford. Theresa needs to be beaten with a wire hanger.\n\nlol. Thanks for making me laugh Q Steph. I agree with you. I like the character Theresa but she's been with her meddling melodrama since the show started. She must need to see the afterlife to get over Ethan. If she's not dead she'll never get over him. That seriously seems like the only way.\n\noh and btw I love your banner with the avatar in the middle. So creative! Kudos to you!\n\nThank you.\n\nThe talented Gina from Crafty Chicks made my banner.\n\nIt's that I even mind that she's a !@#$%^&*]; she's just too note and obsessed over a guy she's only humped a handful of times. Ethan mst have the magic stick if hse's feigning so hard. I half expect her to market foaming drool as Crane Industries next big thing.\n\nI'm not saying that I like Gwen (or Ethan for that matter) but Theresa's the village idiot, !@#$%^&*], and tramp all in one. I liked her at one point, but it got old quick."
