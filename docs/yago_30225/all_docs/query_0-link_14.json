She and her mother sent the email from Theresa's laptop to make it look like Theresa did it.\n\nBest Qualities:\n\nDon't really think she has a best quality, all she has ever shown is her snobby-ness towards the people she meets.\n\nWorst Qualities:\n\nMoney hungry. She may have loved/still loves Ethan, but her love of the Crane money and power is stronger. Will stop at nothing from keeping Ethan, even if it means being pregnant with his baby."
