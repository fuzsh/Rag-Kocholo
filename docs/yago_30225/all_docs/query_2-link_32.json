        "text": "Lindsay Hartley, née Korman, is a Greek-American actress and singer. She is known for her role as Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald Crane Winthrop on Passions, Cara Castillo on All My Children and for her role as Arianna Hernandez on Days of Our Lives.\n\nShe was born on the 17th of April 1978 in Palm Springs, California. Korman is of Jewish, Greek, and Italian origin. She moved with her family to San Diego, California, later attending the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Korman was a national pre-teen talent winner of the Young Miss America Beauty Pageant. Singing since age eleven, Korman got a role in the Broadway production of Grease at age eighteen. At the age of 14 she landed her first professional role playing Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz, at the Mc Callum Theatre in Palm Desert, California. Then she was lead vocalist in the Las Vegas Sands Hotel afternoon show Viva Las Vegas as well as the lead role of Maria in the Civic Light Opera’s West Side Story in Austin, Texas. Additionally, Korman has won several national vocal competitions, including The Los Angeles Philharmonic’s Award-Vocal/Opera, The National Date Festival, and America’s Showcase Starlet.\n\nIn 1999, she won the role of Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald on the NBC soap opera Passions, for which she was nominated for the Soap Opera Digest Award for Outstanding Female Newcomer in 2000. She also made guest appearances on The Weakest Link and The Other Half in 2002.\n\nOn April 9, 2009, Lindsay made a guest appearance on CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.\n\nIn late July of that year, Soap Opera Digest announced that Hartley would join the cast of Days of Our Lives, another NBC soap opera, in the recast role of Arianna Hernandez. Hartley was let go from Days of Our Lives in 2010.\n\nOn September 18, 2010, it was announced that Hartley signed on to play the new character of Cara Castillo on All My Children; she first aired on December 7. She was also cast as DC Comics character Mad Harriet during Smallville’s tenth and final season.\n\nIn January 2013, it was announced that Lindsay signed on to play the role of Dr. Cara Castillo on the new All My Children being revived by Prospect Park and to begin airing sometime in April 2013.\n\nIn 2003, Hartley began dating her former Passions co-star Justin Hartley (who played Fox Crane). After six months, the two became engaged on November 13, 2003. They married in a small ceremony on May 1, 2004. On July 3, 2004, she gave birth to their daughter Isabella Justice Hartley. They lived in Los Angeles. On May 6, 2012, Lindsay filed for divorce from Justin in the Los Angeles County Superior Court citing “irreconcilable differences”, asking for joint physical and legal custody of their daughter."
