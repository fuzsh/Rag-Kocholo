        "text": "Making a connection between Sheridan and the late Princess Diana was bold. In the first week, Sheridan is speeding through the tunnel being chased and she cries out 'they killed Diana and now, they're going to kill ME!'\n\nI didn't know who this woman was but i wanted to see if she was going to make it out of the tunnel and I prayed Rachel Davis Matthews Clark Frame Cory Cory Cory Hutchins would forgive me.\n\nBut then, the next year Princess Diana's death anniversary comes and goes and Sheridan doesn't even mention her good friend; cheap ploy.\n\nNothing ever climaxed on this show. Reilly laughed all the way to the bank. The show lowballed actors and passed on some names who might have been able to elevate the writing (though probably not).\n\nThey should have kept AW or even Sunset Beach.\n\nR87 I wasn't even talking about \"grey area, maybe she wanted it\" rape. Anyone who watched Passions towards the end knows what I mean. They had characters getting drugged, attacked while they slept, etc etc.\n\nAnother recurring theme on Passions is sexual violence. Many storylines, especially since 2005, have included rape as a plot point.\n\nIn 2005, Paloma Lopez-Fitzgerald was sexually assaulted and nearly raped during a club raid. The show then carried a plotline over whether they should do a rape test while Paloma was in a coma (at the time she was a virgin) and Jessica Bennett was also raped a few weeks later while at a club. Also early in the year, Alistair Crane repeatedly raped his wife, Katherine Crane, while at the Crane Compound. Late in May, heiress Fancy Crane was nearly raped by a man in Las Vegas who demanded \"payment\" for letting her into a party after she lost her invitation. During the tsunami and later in November, Liz Sanbourne attempted to rape Julian Crane at knife point. In August, Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald was raped by Alistair Crane when she refused to pay him (with sex) for helping her with visitation of her infant daughter, Jane; Theresa later married Alistair, and he continued to rape her throughout their marriage. Also in August or September, Kay Bennett was attacked by a gang of men while walking through the park at night, though Fox Crane soon arrived and the two defeated the group. Liz Sanbourne also revealed during the tsunami that Julian Crane had raped her in Boston many years previously (she later revealed that it had been Alistair who had done the deed, thus producing a son, Chad Harris-Crane).\n\nThe most prominent rape storyline began in December 2006, when Crane heiress and police cadet Fancy Crane was raped during a sting operation designed to catch a peeping tom. The brutal attack left Fancy in a brief coma and emotionally traumatized the young woman. Fancy was also the show's first rape victim to visibly experience prolonged effects; her bubbly demeanor disappeared, and she became extremely nervous and could not stand to be touched for several months. Fancy was eventually raped for a second time in January 2007, and her boyfriend, Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald, was framed for the crimes; the rapist was later revealed to be Vincent Clarkson, Fancy's paternal half-brother through their father.\n\nRape also played prominently into the 2007—2008 storyline involving Mexican drug cartel leader Juanita Vasquez. Sometime between the births of Pilar's second and third children, the Lopez-Fitzgerald matriarch returned to her native Mexico to visit with her childhood best friend, Juanita Vasquez. There, she discovered that Juanita's husband, Carlos, was still involved with his family's drug cartel and was planning a hit on a rival family; when Pilar confronted Carlos, he raped her, and she accidentally killed him in self-defense. Pilar then called the police in an attempt to stop the hit, but the police ended up murdering the entire Vasquez family, including Juanita and Carlos' young children, except for Juanita. Juanita refused to believe that her husband had raped Pilar and made it her life's mission to murder Pilar's entire family, eventually murdering Pilar's sister and two nephews.\n\nR97.. team Adrian! BIG TIME!!!!!!! that guy was beyond sexy.... sorry but metcalfe at the time of his first miguel looked boyish too much so..\n\nand of course Adrian had the much better body than Jessie..... loved his scenes at the prison, seduced by the mermaid character and her siren song, and the other scenes of him shirtless, under a spell, etc.. There was also the episode and the very homoerotic scene where his competition dreamt of killing him off, and you see Adrian in a shower with his back turned away from the other guy and while he was of course wearing something, whatever he was wearing was worn VERY LOW to where the viewer could actually see the beginning of his ass in that shower stall... very sexy erotic stuff! not to mention in the other guy's fantasy, he has adrian/miguel turn around, as he opens the shower stall, not seeing adrian/miguel fully nude and throws in a hair dryer to electrocute adrian/miguel... not turned on by that kind of violence (although stupid), but the rest of the scene is pure homoeroticism!\n\nR105 You may be right about his GL. I can’t say for sure because I didn’t see much of it, but what I’ve seen of it on YouTube is excellent.\n\nBut I disagree that he did lasting damage to DAYS because DAYS would not still be on the air if not for him. He took it from the ratings basement to a full 2 ratings points higher, the last time any US soap has gone up in the ratings and not down.\n\nIt’s true that soaps tried to copy him and did it badly, which hurt the genre. But the genre’s failure to modernize was not his fault.\n\nOne thing I remember, but I'm not sure how often it happened, would be that a character's dream sequence would be going on in real time. Okay, so say there's an episode with three storylines. You've got the Tabitha, Timmy, Charity & Miguel and Kay stuff going on. Then you've got the Rebecca or Eve/Julian/Ivy/Sam/Grace and T.C. stuff going on. Then you might have either Sheridan & Luis or Theresa/Ethan/Gwen. (If a fourth storyline is going on, it's probably Whitney and Chad.) A lot of times in the early days, you'd get a scene where Sheridan & Luis or Theresa and Ethan's relationship progresses farther than it did before. Cut back to the other stories, then back to the romance, and at about 20 minutes into the episode, PSYCH! The romance stuff was just a dream (and another third of an episode was filler)."
