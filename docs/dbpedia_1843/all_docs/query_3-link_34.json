        "text": "Magadan geophysical observatory is a standalone structure unit of the Institute of Cosmophysical Researches and Radiowave Propagation, Far Eastern Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IKIR FEB RAS). The observatory personnel includes 9 persons. The observatory is located in the Stekolny settlenemt, 70 km noth from the Magadan city. All the observatory works are done within 3 technical buildings and 4 magnetic pavilions.\n\nMain tasks of the observations are:\n\nMonitoring and measurement of the variations of cosmic rays using the neutron monitor;\n\nMeasurement of absolutw and variational values of the elements of magnetic field;\n\nMeasurements of the ionosphere parameters using the vertical radio sounding technique;\n\nShortwave linear frequency modulation (LFM) radiowave transmission for the goals of studying the ionosphere using the inclined radio sounding technique\n\nIn 1963 the registration of the state of the ionosphere and the Earth's magnetic field parameters began on a complex magnetic-ionospheric station using the automatic ionospheric station (AIS), analogue magnetic variometer with Bobrov-type sensors and the proton magnetometer developed in the Pushkov institute of terrestrial magnetism, ionosphere and radiowave propagation (IZMIRAN). Registering was performed on films and photographic paper. This hardware is still being used to date. The magnetic observatory includes 3 wooden pavilions.\n\nIn August 1992 according to the Protocol of intentions on collaborative work (Solar-Terrestrial Energy international program) with the Nagoya University, Japan, of June 12, 1991, a DCR-04-01 fluxgate magnetometer including a sensor with a measurement device, a DCR-3 registering device (digital recording on a tape) and the device for time referencing (using the signals of the SW radio station of time service). Since April 2001, instead of the DCR-3 registering device, the DCR-3MC has been used, which provided the hard drive recording and GPS time referencing.\n\nIn autumn 2005 the Russian digital magnetic variometer Ð¦ÐÐÐ¡-6 was installed and started in operation. This variometer was based on the Bobrov's magnetic sensors (developed in the IZMIRAN) and the L-154 ADC. Control and registering is realized via PC.\n\nIn 2006 the Japanese FRG-601G digital magnetic variometer was installed at the observatory. It has a resolution of 0.01 nT. The data is transmitted to the International Center for Space Weather Science and Education, Kyushu University, Japan (former Space Environment Research Center).\n\nIn 2007 in terms of collaboration with the Helmholtz-Zentrum Potsdam Deutsches GeoForschungsZentrum (GFZ) a new automatic magnetometric complex was installed. Also in autumn 2007 the DCR-3MC magnetometer was replaced with the MAGDAS. The technical works were done at the observatory in order to install the induction magnetometer and the sky camera for further helio-geophysical monitoring.\n\nIn October 2009 the Magadan observatory got the INTERMAGNET certificate.\n\nIn 2011 a GSM-19 FD magnetometer was installed in a repaired pavilion. The observatory includes 4 pavilions: the variometer pavilion, the absolute pavilion, the technical pavilion and the special pavilion for the GSM-19FD device.\n\nIn September 2013 the disabled M390 sensor was replaced with the FGE variometer sensor.\n\nEquipment and hardware:\n\nneutron monitor, developed by the IZMIRAN institute (installed in 1966);\n\nÐ¦ÐÐÐ¡-6 Bobrov-type digital magnetic variometer, developed by the IZMIRAN institute (installed in 2005);\n\nFRG-601G fluxgate magnetometer, Japan (installed in 2006);\n\nGEOMAG M390 vector magnetometer with a DTU Space FGE fluxgate sensor;\n\nMAGDAS-GOLD magnetometer, Japan (installed in 2007);\n\nInduction magnetometer, Japan (installed in 2008);\n\nMagnetomertic complex, Germany, GFZ Potsdam (installed in 2007);\n\ndIdD GSM-19FD magnetometer, Canada (installed in 2012);\n\nAIS ionospheric sounding device, USSR (installed in 1963);\n\nLFM transmitter, Irkutsk, ISTP SB RAS (installed in 1992);\n\nPhoto-optical panorama Sky Camera, Japan (installed in 1992).\n\nAbsolute pavilion\n\nVariometer pavilion\n\nTechnical pavilion\n\nGSM-19FD pavilion\n\nGSM-19FD registering device\n\nGSM-19FD sensor\n\nInduction magnetometer sensor\n\nMinGeo DIM THEO020B theodolite with a Model G fluxgate magnetometer\n\nFGE vector fluxgate magnetometer\n\nMAGDALOG device\n\nPOSTAL ADDRESS:\n\nGeophysical Observatory \"Magadan\"\n\nStekolny 686134, Khasynsky District, Magadan Region, Russia\n\nCONTACT INFO:\n\nName: Igor Poddelskiy\n\nE-mail: podd-igor‹at›yandex‹dot›ru\n\nTel.: +7 (41342) 9-82-31"
