It\n\nwould not even have seen the light of day had it not been for professor Holger\n\nWeiss, who believed in me enough to finally convince myself that I was equal\n\nto the task at hand. His energy and enthusiasm has propelled myself as well as\n\nother fellow researchers towards the work and craft of the historian. A special\n\nmention should also be afforded to Jan-Erik Till for largely the same reasons.\n\nTilli’s inspirational education and encouragement are the sources for my\n\ninitial interest in history.\n\nI cannot recount how many debts I owe to my second supervisor, PhD.\n\nFredrik Thomasson. Suffice it to say, this thesis would look much different if\n\nit had not been for the different efforts and qualities of Fredrik. Sealed\n\narchives would have remained under lock and key, obstinate institutions\n\nwould have been unyielding, and technical and linguistic barriers would have\n\nbeen insurmountable in the time allotted to complete this text.\n\nThe work with this thesis would not have been materially possible without\n\nthe generous grant of the Academy of Finland, which founded the EGL\n\nproject of which I am part. I have been especially privileged to travel\n\nextensively to foreign archives and sites which has been absolutely essential.\n\nfor the results of the study. Additional grants were supplied in the first year\n\nof my work by Svenska litteratursällskapet, Ragnar, Ester, Rolf och Margareta\n\nBergboms fond, and Waldemar von Frenckells fond. The early travel grant by\n\nÅbo Akademis jubileumsfond 1968 made an initial sojourn in the Swedish\n\nNational Archives possible, during which I started to acquaint myself with\n\nthe Swedish history of St. Barthélemy.\n\nDuring that first visit, I met briefly with Per Tingbrand, whose mammoth\n\nefforts in uncovering, cataloguing, and recording the extant archival sources\n\nhave been invaluable for myself as well as other researchers. I am sorry for not\n\nhaving the opportunity of discussing St. Barthélemy at length with you.\n\nSuffice it to say, a large part of the primary research done before the\n\ncompletion of this thesis would not have been possible without your efforts.\n\nI owe you my most heartfelt gratitude.\n\nDuring my research trips abroad I have benefited from friends and family\n\nwith an open home and place to rest. I would like to especially thank Emil and\n\nSofia Sandholm in Stockholm who took care of me despite that I occupied.\n\nmost of their living-room space for several months at a time. I would also like\n\nto thank Anders Huldin and family for housing me in Stockholm during the\n\nsame period, as well as my sister Lotta Wilson-Bruun and family who saw to\n\nmy accommodation in a stint at the Danish National Archives in\n\nCopenhagen. I would also like to thank the aid and assistance of\n\nacquaintances connected to different archival institutions and libraries. The\n\nhelp and expertise of Jean-Yves Dissais with the old Swedish municipal\n\narchive of St. Barthélemy, housed at the ANOM in Aix-en-Provence, has\n\nbeen invaluable to the digital reproduction of it, and in extension to mine and\n\nfellow researchers’ projects. Jacques Dion deserves thanks for making the\n\nwhole process possible in the first place. Anne Lebel thankfully provided the\n\npossibility of a sojourn at the ADM in Gourbeyre, Guadeloupe, whereas\n\nGerard Lafleur took good care of an itinerant researcher during his first visit\n\nin a Caribbean island. Arlette Magras made sure that I found my way around\n\nSt. Barthélemy and the peculiar traces of its Swedish history. To Han Jordaan\n\nI owe many of my insights into the history of St. Eustatius and its sources. It\n\nwas a valuable and enjoyable experience to collaborate and work with you, as\n\nwell as with Jessica Vance Roitman and Gert Oostindie. I thank the latter two\n\nfor their diligence and patience during a late book project. I take the\n\nopportunity also to thank my colleague Ale Pålsson of Stockholm University,\n\nwho has also worked with a thesis of his own about the history of St.\n\nBarthélemy, and who has accompanied me during long hours of photography\n\nand cataloguing of the archives in Aix-en-Provence, as well as the 2013 ACH\n\nconference in Belize.\n\nWhen I have occasionally shown up in the corridors of the history\n\ndepartment of Åbo Akademi University, I have always found myself\n\nsurrounded with helpful and resourceful colleagues. The historical research\n\nseminar has always been a source of useful dialogue and reflection, assisted by\n\nthe meeting of widely differing topics and research themes. I would like to\n\ndirect special thanks to Professor Nils-Erik Villstrand as one of the leading\n\nvoices of this seminar, as well the particular insights he has offered me as an\n\nexpert on Swedish history. Other teachers and mentors which deserve\n\nmentioning both for their aid during my work with this thesis as well as during\n\nmy years as an undergraduate are Laura Hollsten, Rolf Enander, Ann-Catrin\n\nÖstman, and Joachim Mickwitz.\n\nMy colleagues have made life as a PhD student brighter. I would like to\n\nespecially thank Stefan Norrgård and Anna Sundelin for their genial manner\n\nwhen I first started to settle down at a desk at our department, and also\n\nMiriam Rönnqvist for our frank discussions about work and working life.\n\nDuring our coffee breaks, I have found invaluable advice, support, as well as\n\ngeneral amusement in the office next door, which also doubles as a coffee\n\nroom. Frequenters and (un)fortunate occupants of said room include, but is\n\nnot limited to: Mats Wickström, Robert Lindberg, Patrik Hettula, Oscar\n\nWinberg, Matias Kaihovirta, Hanna Lindberg, Johanna Wassholm, Anders\n\nAhlbäck, Janne Väistö, and Fredrik Petersson.\n\nAt last I would to thank my family which has supported me through the\n\nyears, despite my constant absent-mindedness and preoccupations while\n\nimmersed in this project. I thank my parents Bo-Gustav and Helena Wilson\n\nfor their unflinching support. My sister Anna Sjöblom deserves thanks as a\n\nkey person that finally convinced me to continue working with what I enjoy\n\nmost. At last I would like to thank my own family. My wife Sara has had to\n\nput up with a lot of my idiosyncrasies during the years, but she has never\n\nwavered in her support for me. Our sons Åke and Allan, born in 2013 and 2015,\n\nhave offered a healthy perspective on life during the last years spent putting\n\nthis text together.\n\nBackgränd, Karis\n\nDecember 2015\n\nFigure 1.1 St. Barthélemy ca. 1800\n\nSource: Samuel Fahlberg, Charta öfver Ön St. Barthélemy, 1801, Krigsarkivet.\n\nFigure 1.2 The Lesser Antilles\n\n12\n\n1 Introduction\n\n1.1 Images of a Prosperous Port Town\n\nIn October 1805, the British lawyer James Stephen published the legal\n\npolemic War in Disguise; or, the Frauds of the Neutral Flags. While the\n\nprincipal target of Stephen’s treatise was the burgeoning neutral American\n\ncarrying trade, other minor neutral trading nations did not escape his\n\narguments and invectives. Stephen claimed that “Denmark and Sweden\n\neach possessed islands in the West Indies”, St. Thomas and St.\n\nBarthélemy, “which might be made entrepôts between their European\n\ndominions and the French colonies”.1\n\nThe island of St. Barthélemy had since the initial Swedish acquisition.\n\nbecome the home of an international mercantile community which was\n\ncentered in a new town, christened Gustavia after king Gustav III. Shortly\n\nafter the first Swedish settlement, the town was proclaimed a free port. In\n\n1800 the island had reached its demographic apex of 6,000 inhabitants. In\n\nterms of its population, Gustavia became one the largest cities in the\n\nSwedish kingdom. In 1819, four years after the end of the great European\n\nconflict, Olof Erik Bergius published Om Westindien, a general overview of\n\nthe West Indies, based in large part on his experience as colonial judge in\n\nthe Swedish colony of St. Barthélemy. His depiction of the regional trade\n\nconducted from the island’s free port of Gustavia essentially confirmed\n\nStephen’s assumptions. During the late war, asserted Bergius, the local\n\nmerchants had “supplied the French colonies with French wines, the\n\nEnglish islands with American timber, the United States with English and\n\n1\n\nJames Stephen, War in Disguise; or, the Frauds of the Neutral Flags (London: C. Whittingham,\n\n1805), 38.\n\n13\n\nEast Indian merchandise, France with St. Domingo coffee etc.” While he\n\nhardly defined this trade in more precise political and legal terms, it would\n\nhave no doubt been just the kind of commercial activity that Stephen\n\nwould have termed ‘war in disguise’.2\n\nStephen called for the abolition of the carrying trade of neutral nations,\n\nwith special reference to the commerce between France’s Caribbean\n\nislands and Europe. Having practiced at the bar in the Vice Admiralty\n\nCourt of St. Kitts, he had had the opportunity to witness contraband trade\n\nin the Caribbean under the guise of neutral flags. He was also a member of\n\nparliament, and the ideas he espoused in War in Disguise became the basis\n\nof British commercial warfare against France, embodied in the Orders in\n\nCouncil of 1807. It was passed in order to keep any neutral nations from\n\ntrading between enemy ports. It was answered in France the same year\n\nwith the Milan Decree, which declared that all neutral shipping using\n\nBritish ports, or paying British tariffs, were to be regarded as British and\n\nas such seized and condemned. Despite this state of affairs, the trade of\n\nGustavia ostensibly flourished.\n\nFor Stephen and his peers, neutral transit trade constituted a kind of\n\nclandestine warfare, but reality belied such simple distinctions. The\n\nprofusion of shipping routes and trade flows described by Bergius can\n\nhardly be characterized as a commercial movement that exclusively served\n\nthe interests of a single national interest. Free ports were by definition\n\nopen to ships of all nations, and were exploited by the commercial actors\n\nof all nations. The Dutch free port colonies of Curaçao and St. Eustatius\n\nas well as the Danish colony of St. Thomas had since the 17th century been\n\ninternational emporiums of free trade in the region, and its inhabitants\n\nshared a renowned history of smuggling and interloping throughout the\n\nWestern Hemisphere. Free trade in this context refers to the trade that\n\ntransgressed national and imperial borders throughout the history of\n\ncolonial societies in the Americas, irrespective if it was regarded as legal or\n\n2\n\nOlof Erik Bergius, Om Westindien (Stockholm: Gadelius, 1819). For a brief but insightful\n\nanalysis of the work and its influences, see Harald Elovsson, Amerika i svensk litteratur 1750–\n\n1820: en studie i komparativ litteraturhistoria (Lund: Gleerup, 1930), 123–24, 284–287.\n\n14\n\nillegal. Historians have in recent times tended to speak about “informal\n\neconomies” as a catch-all category, instead of limiting the discussion to\n\ndefinition-defying phenomena such as smuggling or illicit trade. The term\n\ntransit trade owes its use to the character free port trade as a mediator,\n\nconnecting markets otherwise closed from each other.\n\n3\n\nThe once bustling activity of St. Eustatius, nicknamed “the Golden\n\nRock”, as well as Curaçao was however close to extinguished towards the\n\nend of the century when the Dutch Republic was subsumed by France.\n\nDanish St. Thomas was occupied by British forces in 1807 as a result of the\n\nDanish course in the Napoleonic Wars. The effects of these circumstances\n\nhave not been well understood in current historical research. The effects\n\nappeared however to be quite tangible for the Swedish colony. On location\n\nin St. Barthélemy during the height of the Napoleonic Wars, Bergius even\n\nventured to claim that “gold flowed out in streams out of the very rock of\n\nthe island”, an allusion to the hundreds of ships which could be seen\n\nfrequenting the colony to trade and barter their cargoes at a daily basis. It\n\nis also an image that is highly reminiscent of the near mythical past wealth\n\nof St. Eustatius. Indeed, while Bergius’ description of a prosperous St.\n\nBarthélemy is highly colorful, it is a characteristic sentiment which is often\n\nmirrored in other sources. Abraham Runnels, a former inhabitant of St.\n\nEustatius, compared the histories of St. Eustatius and St. Barthélemy in\n\n1814 and claimed that “what one [St. Eustatius] owed of her celebrity to\n\nthe War of American Independence, the other [St. Barthélemy] owes to\n\nthe Wars of the French revolution.” At the time of his statement, Runnels\n\nwas living on St. Barthélemy, and had become a naturalized Swedish\n\nburgher. Runnels was one of many ‘Statians’ that had moved from the\n\nDutch colony to St. Barthélemy during the turmoil of the 1790s. Before\n\nRunnels and family members had become Swedish subjects, he had been\n\n3\n\nAlthough the term ”informal economy” has been primarily applied in the social sciences\n\nsince the 1970s, it has been incorporated in historical scholarship as well, cf. for example\n\nLance Grahn, Political Economy of Smuggling: Regional Informal Economies in Early Bourbon New\n\nGranada (Boulder, CO: Westview, 1997); For an overview, see Mark G. Hanna’s entry:\n\n“Smuggling” in the Atlantic History section of Oxford Bibliographies Online:\n\nhttp://www.oxfordbibliographiesonline.com.\n\n15\n\npart of a community which had been trading from Dutch Caribbean\n\ncolonies for generations, but had since then shifted national affiliations in\n\norder to continue their livelihood.4\n\nA History Fallen into Obscurity?\n\nWhy is it, however, that St. Barthélemy remains understudied in Swedish\n\nand international historiography? Against the backdrop of narratives\n\nabout Dutch commercial primacy through their Caribbean free ports and\n\ninterloping trade, one is at a loss to find any mention of the commercial\n\nimportance of St. Barthélemy. In 1784, St. Barthélemy was acquired by the\n\nSwedish crown from the French. It is one of the smallest islands of the\n\nLesser Antilles, and at the time of acquisition, the island was home to only\n\na few hundred French settlers and their slaves. It was one of the least\n\neconomically and politically important islands in the Caribbean. It was\n\nhowever, the end-result of Swedish colonial ambitions at the close of the\n\neighteenth century. It was decided that the only way to exploit the island\n\nwas to encourage the transit trade within the region in a similar manner as\n\nhad been done by Dutch and Danish colonies in the region, as well as to try\n\nan attempt to participate directly in the West Indian trade. And with\n\nSwedish acquisition also came – eventually – a substantial transformation\n\nof the colony. The Swedish colonial efforts were focused at creating a free\n\nport town around the rim of Le Carénage, a protected cove on the\n\nsouthwest shore.\n\nThe colony’s small imprint on the Swedish economy is however only\n\none aspect of its obscured past. There has been uneven attention paid to\n\ninternational history in Scandinavian and northern European states.\n\nHistorical conditions have likely led to this state of affairs, as northern\n\nEuropean states have not experienced significant phenomena of\n\n4\n\nThe quote from Runnels to Skogman, 9 June 1814, SBS 3 A, SNA; Han Jordaan and Victor\n\nWilson, ”The Eighteenth-century Danish, Dutch and Swedish Free Ports in the\n\nNortheastern Caribbean: Continuity and Change,” in Dutch Atlantic Connections, ed.

In pre-World War II-Sweden, colonialism was still an\n\nunproblematic subject. After the war Swedish scholars and writers\n\nhowever marginalized colonialism from its place in Swedish national\n\nnarratives, and it became more common to stress the insignificance of\n\nSwedish colonial projects, as it did not fit very well into the historical\n\nSwedish self-view as a progressive and liberal welfare state. As a result of\n\nthis development, Swedish colonial history has never been politicized, that\n\nis, up until very recently. In 2014 Sweden was included in the Caribbean\n\nCommunity (CARICOM) list of states held to be responsible for the\n\neffects of colonialism and slavery, and thus possibly liable for reparations.\n\nThe country’s colonial past has also garnered some recent media attention\n\ntowards current research on St. Barthélemy.6\n\nAnother reason for the relative disinterest into the Swedish colonial\n\nperiod of St. Barthélemy is due to the circumstances surrounding the\n\nsources. Swedish historians have mainly utilized the available material in\n\nthe Swedish National Archives (SNA), which primarily consist of the\n\nsurviving colonial records and reports sent to Stockholm as well as the\n\nrelatively extensive archive of the Swedish West India Company (SWIC).\n\n5\n\nFor a discussion of Scandinavian and northern European colonial history, see the\n\nintroduction to a special journal issue on the topic by Pernille Ipsen and Gunlög Fur,\n\nItinerario 33, no. 2 (2009), 7–16; For the Swedish situation, see Stefan Eklöf Amirell, ”Den\n\ninternationella historiens uppgång och fall: Trender inom svensk internationell\n\nhistorieforskning 1950–2005,” Historisk Tidskrift 126, no. 2 (2006), 257–78.\n\n6\n\nThe quote from Gunlög Fur in “Colonialism and Swedish History: Unthinkable\n\nConnections?” in Scandinavian Colonialism and the Rise of Modernity: Small Time Agents in a\n\nGlobal Arena, ed.

The records, the Fonds Suédois de Saint-Barthélemy (FSB) have\n\nsuffered through adverse climate, neglect, as well as fires, and are as a result\n\nin a very bad state of conservation. Large parts were probably destroyed\n\nand lost forever during periods of foreign occupation of the colony.7\n\nOne of the arguably most important explanations, however, is the weak\n\nlink between international and domestic research on Nordic colonialism.\n\nThere are only a few exceptions, were international scholarship has taken\n\nnote of the colony’s economic role. Albert Keller noted in his great\n\nsynthesis on colonization that during the British occupation of the Danish\n\nCaribbean colonies in 1807–1815, “American products were diverted and\n\npassed over St. Bartholomew, which at the time enjoyed an ephemeral\n\nimportance.” Eric Williams also afforded a paragraph to the Swedish island\n\nin his seminal Capitalism and Slavery when he discussed the need of\n\nconvenient transit harbors in the Caribbean for neutral American traders.8\n\nThere are multiple explanations behind the relative omission of the\n\ncolonies of the Nordic countries in international research, not least of\n\nwhich are the linguistic and archival exigencies involved. Another aspect,\n\nfinally is the fact that the historiography of the West Indies and the\n\nWestern hemisphere in the Early Modern period has long focused on\n\nplantations rather than cities as the hearts of colonial economies and\n\n7\n\nRolf Lamborn, ”The Archives of Saint Bartholomew Rediscovered,” The Swedish Pioneer\n\nHistorical Society 15, no. 1 (1964), 33–44; Ingvar Andersson, ”Arkivalier från S:t Barthélemys\n\nsvenska tid,” Arkiv, samhälle, forskning 8 (1965), 7–13; Dan Brändström, ”Det svenska arkivet i\n\nVästindien,” Västerbottens-kuriren, December 12, 1967; Björn Lindh, ”Det svenska SaintBarthélemy-arkivet.” Arkiv, samhälle, forskning 16 (1974), 21–25.; Anne Lebel, ”SaintBarthélemy et ses archives: une connaissance historique éclatée,” Bulletin de la société d’histoire\n\nde la Guadeloupe 159 (2011), 91–102.

Furthermore, little or no attention has been made to\n\nconnections across imperial borders in the colonies themselves, either in\n\nthe form of migration flows, the transfers of ideas and information, or the\n\ncomplex networks created through trade and commerce. The history of St.\n\nBarthélemy, in short, has been largely treated as an isolated Swedish affair,\n\nand it follows that the relationship between St. Barthélemy and the\n\nsurrounding region is not clearly understood.9\n\nThis study, however, takes the free port town as a point of departure.\n\nUnlike the plantation colonies, free port towns such as Gustavia were\n\ncreated in order to circumvent imperial monopolies rather than uphold\n\nthem, for the gain of individuals as well as national treasuries. I argue that\n\nthe historical role of St. Barthélemy in the economy of the Caribbean is\n\nnot properly understood, and that it is more significant than previous\n\nresearch has found it to be. More importantly, I argue that the history of\n\nSt. Barthélemy is important for the understanding of the longer continuity\n\nof free trade in the region, and in extension, the different colonial societies\n\nboth in the Caribbean and in the North and South American continents.\n\nThe study of free ports and similar subterfuges during times of\n\ninternational conflict serves to investigate regional networks and\n\nrelationships integral to the reality of mercantile order in the colonies.\n\nSituating St. Barthélemy in a Regional and Transnational\n\nPerspective\n\nSt. Barthélemy has not been incorporated into larger frameworks of\n\nanalysis or syntheses in modern historiographies. Scholarly studies as well\n\npopular histories have been published around the topic of the Swedish\n\n9\n\nAnne Pérotin-Dumon, “Cabotage, Contraband, and Corsairs: The Port Cities of\n\nGuadeloupe and their Inhabitants,” in Atlantic Port Cities: Economy, Culture, and Society in the\n\nAtlantic World, 1650–1850, ed.

Liss (Knoxville: The\n\nUniversity of Tennessee Press, 1991), 58; Anne Pérotin-Dumon, La ville aux Iles, la ville dans\n\nl’île: Basse-Terre et Pointe-à-Pitre, Guadeloupe, 1650–1820 (Paris: Karthala, 2000), 12–13.\n\n19\n\ncolony, but they all share the same basic framework, that of the colony as\n\na project connected solely to the agency of the metropole or the nation\n\nstate, a common idea in the treatment of European colonialism. To firmly\n\nplace the free port of Gustavia within a larger context, I argue that its\n\nhistory should be linked with the continuity of free trade of the West\n\nIndies in a long historical perspective, from the days of early colonization\n\nto the repeal of mercantilist barriers during the course of the 19th century.\n\n10\n\nIn short, this study aims to place the economic history of St.\n\nBarthélemy within a longer historiographic tradition of comparative\n\norganizations of free trade in the West Indies. At the core of this tradition\n\nis the ambition to explain how it was virtually impossible for colonial\n\npowers to attain the ideal of mercantilist and exclusive colonial systems.\n\nImperial borders and national privileges were in reality constantly\n\nchallenged, and they often yielded to internal economic necessities,\n\nambitions of gain, and pragmatic government policy. I argue that it this is\n\nthe most suitable and conducive context in consideration of the economic\n\nhistory of St. Barthélemy.\n\n1.2 Topical Research, Perspectives and Theory\n\nStrictly speaking, there is no historiographic tradition of transit trade per\n\nse, let alone an integrated field of historical research. But it is however a\n\ndiscernible genre of colonial history with a long continuity. One of the\n\nearliest examples is Richard Pares’ War and Trade in the West Indies (1938),\n\n10 Frederick Cooper and Ann Laura Stoler, ”Between Metropole and Colony. Rethinking a\n\nresearch agenda,” in Tensions of Empire. Colonial Cultures in a Bourgeois World, ed. Frederick\n\nCooper and Ann Laura Stoler. (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1997); For a short but\n\nprecise overview of smuggling in the Americas, see Wim Klooster “Inter-Imperial Smuggling\n\nin the Americas, 1600–1800,” in Soundings in Atlantic History: Latent Structures and Intellectual\n\nCurrents, 1500–1830, ed. Bernard Bailyn and Patricia L. Denault (Cambridge: Harvard\n\nUniversity Press, 2009) 141–80.\n\n20\n\nin which the interdependence of different British and French colonies’\n\ncommercial and political interests is explored, not in the least the\n\nrelationship between the North American colonies and the West Indies,\n\nparticularly the readiness of American merchants to trade with the enemy\n\nduring the wars of the 18th century. He further elaborated on this historical\n\nrelationship in Yankees and Creoles (1956). A recent work on the same theme\n\nis Thomas Truxe’s Defying Empire: Trading with the Enemy in New York\n\n(2008), in which he details the methods and ambitions of New England\n\nmerchants that continued to exchange British goods for French sugar and\n\nSpanish silver during the Seven Years’ War (1756–63). In a broader popular\n\ntreatment, Peter Andreas has focused on the significance of smuggling in\n\nU.S. history from colonial to modern times in Smuggler Nation (2013).\n\n11\n\nThe contraband trade between North American colonies and the\n\nFrench West Indies became a problem within the British Empire during\n\nthe 18th century and was part of the impetus behind the British project to\n\nestablish a network of Caribbean free ports. The first study of this project\n\nwas published in 1953 by Frances Armytage, The Free Port System in the\n\nBritish West Indies. Through the free ports, the British government also\n\nsought ways to circumvent its own Navigation Acts, by enabling coveted\n\ntrade contacts in Spanish colonies with which direct, legal trade was\n\notherwise impossible. The issue of British commercial ambitions in\n\nSpanish colonial America has been detailed in a more recent study by\n\nAdrian Pearce, British Trade with Spanish America, 1763–1808, which builds\n\nfurther upon the work of Armytage. Pearce empirically confirms that the\n\nBritish goal had always been unrestricted trade with Spanish America, that\n\nboth government and merchants alike were complicit in ignoring treaties,\n\n11 Richard Pares, War and Trade in the West Indies, 1739–1763 (Oxford: Oxford University\n\nPress, 1936); Richard Pares, Yankees and Creoles: The Trade between North America and\n\nthe West Indies before the American Revolution (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,\n\n1956); Thomas Truxes, Defying Empire: Trading with the Enemy in Colonial New York\n\n(New Haven: Yale University Press, 2008); Peter Andreas, Smuggler Nation: How Illicit\n\nTrade Made America (New York: Oxford University Press, 2013).\n\n21\n\nNavigation Acts, and condoning every sort of interloping and smuggling\n\nimaginable.12\n\nWithin the same framework one can assign different works on the\n\nDutch West Indies during the recent decades. Before Wim Klooster’s\n\nIllicit Riches: Dutch Trade in the Caribbean, 1648–1795, the transatlantic trade\n\nof the Dutch Republic had never received the same scholarly attention as\n\nthe Dutch Asian trade. Klooster’s study of the Dutch free ports on\n\nCuraçao and St. Eustatius shed new light on the Dutch transit trade with\n\nSpanish and French colonies. The study added empirical weight in many\n\nways to the long-standing narrative of Dutch traders as the perennial\n\nmiddlemen of different colonial trade networks, as well as discovering that\n\nthe Dutch transatlantic trade was larger than what was previously thought.\n\nKlooster has continued to emphasize the role of smuggling and illicit trade\n\nwithin the wider early modern Atlantic world. Of the few other historians\n\nwho have concentrated on greater overviews and theories of illicit trade in\n\nmultiple empires, the most notable is Alan Karras.13\n\nThere is a relative dearth of smuggling studies within the French and\n\nSpanish historiographies. In the French case there are many factors which\n\nhave contributed to the relatively low yield of colonial studies overall. The\n\nfield of Atlantic History has after all been conceived within the AngloSaxon academic world, and the French historical tradition has developed\n\nindependently during the 20th century under the Annales school with its\n\nnew orientations, away from ideologies of colonialism, imperialism, and\n\nnationalism. In the context of French colonial trade, Jean Tarrade’s 1972\n\n12 Frances Armytage, The Free Port System in the British West Indies (London: Longmans, Green\n\n& Co., 1953); Cf. Adrian J. Pearce, “British Trade with the Spanish Colonies,” Bulletin of Latin\n\nAmerican Research 20, no. 2 (2001): 233–60; In a recent interesting analysis, Javier CuencaEsteban builds upon Pearce’s estimates of the British trade into Spanish America and posits\n\nthat they could be revised upwards of 29 percent or more.

Contraband and Corruption in World History (Lanham: Rowman &\n\nLittlefield, 2009).\n\n22\n\nvolumes on the Exclusif mitigé is still the definitive study, spanning the last\n\nquarter-century of the l’ancien regime. It differs from many of the above\n\nworks in that it is communicated through the perspective of the French\n\nmonarchy, and its attempts to negotiate the markets of its colonial empire\n\nwith and without Colbertian principles of metropolitan monopoly. It also\n\ndiffers somewhat in that Tarrade is almost exclusively concerned with the\n\ntrade between France and its own colonies, as opposed to the informal\n\neconomies with other territories which thrived the peripheries of the\n\nFrench empire.14\n\nIt is somewhat more difficult to pinpoint book-length surveys of\n\nSpanish colonial trade, but economic studies of Spanish America have\n\ngenerally given extensive treatment to the issue of contraband and\n\nattempts to curtail contraband within the Spanish Empire. For instance,\n\nthe larger theme in Stein and Stein’s Edge of Crisis (2012) is the decline of\n\nthe Spanish empire and the colonial heritage of Latin America from a\n\ndependency-theory perspective. Similar to Tarrade’s study, it focuses\n\nmeticulously on the peninsular policy making of Spain and the subaltern\n\ncolonial relationship of Spain with the other Spanish colonies in the\n\nCaribbean. In their exposition, the reorganizing of New Spain’s trade in\n\n1789–93, the Comercio Libre, served to create new fissures within an already\n\nunstable empire. John R. Fischer’s The Economic Aspects of Spanish\n\nImperialism in America, 1492–1810 (1997), as well as surveys by Horst\n\nPietschmann are older entries in the research into the economic spheres\n\nof Spanish imperialism, but no less valid. Fischer’s work is on a grander\n\nscale as it addresses how the Spanish government treated the economic\n\n14 Jean Tarrade, Le commerce colonial de la France à la fin de l’Ancien Regime : L’evolution du regime\n\nde « l’Exclusif » de 1763 a 1789, 2 vols.

The historiography on the Swedish colonial period of St.\n\nBarthélemy has focused solely on the relationship between metropole and\n\ncolony, and in extension, the colony’s importance for the Swedish\n\neconomy. The only works which have arguably situated the colony’s\n\nhistory in more sizeable contexts are Sven Ola Swärd’s study on Sweden’s\n\nearly 19th-century diplomacy and trade with Latin America, as well as the\n\nsmaller case studies of St. Barthélemy’s connections with South American\n\nrebels and insurgents by Carlos Vidales.16\n\nEli Heckscher, the dominant figure of economic historical research in\n\nSweden as well as an important name in international circles of the\n\ndiscipline, summed up the history of St. Barthélemy as “unimportant”. The\n\nconclusion was a side-note in a wider sweep of Heckscher’s general critique\n\nof Swedish commercial policy during the 18th century. Later scholarship\n\nhas nuanced and modified his interpretations, whereas his verdict on the\n\neconomic value of St. Barthélemy has hardly been challenged.17\n\n15 Barbara H. Stein and Stanley J.

Hildebrand’s is the most widely\n\ncited secondary work on the colony’s Swedish history. For its limited time\n\nperiod (1784–96), it is a thoroughly researched work, much occupied with\n\nthe intricacies of political and diplomatic history, as well as the first study\n\nto investigate some of the economic networks and connections in which\n\nthe Swedish colony was involved, but the main focus still remains within\n\nthe metropole-colony framework.18\n\nThe shifting interest in Sweden about its former West Indian colony\n\nhas produced a range of shorter and longer specialized treatments of its\n\nhistory. There is the sounding into the legal history of St. Barthélemy by\n\nBirger Wedberg (1936), the short study of slave demography by Hannes\n\nHyrenius (1977), but also exhaustively researched studies like the\n\necclesiastical and religious history of Jan Arvid Hellström (1987).\n\nHellström’s work created one of the first comprehensive bibliographies\n\nand resources of St. Barthélemy history.19\n\nThe irregular attention to colonial history in Sweden and in the other\n\nnorthern European states has, however, in recent years come to change.\n\nArguably because of international trends in colonial history, northern\n\nEuropean scholars have started to attempt the integration of the field of\n\nScandinavian colonial history. Interpretative models and frameworks have\n\nbeen found readily available not in the least from the field of Atlantic and\n\nGlobal history.

A result of a Scandinavian scholarly network, it\n\ncontains a number of contributions that illustrate how a focus on the\n\nconsumption of Atlantic products, such as sugar, coffee, and rum, is a way\n\nof writing Atlantic history for regions that did not have strong colonial\n\nempires. There are also current works that display a willingness to examine\n\nsome of the larger questions concerning the role of colonial trade for\n\nEuropean economic growth, rather than simply the presentation of new\n\nempirical information. An example is Klas Rönnbäck’s dissertation,\n\nCommerce and Colonisation (2009).\n\n21 There has been some interesting new\n\ndevelopments in the research strictly concerning St. Barthélemy as well.\n\nLeos Müller’s Consuls, Corsairs, and Commerce (2004)22 concentrates on the\n\neighteenth century Swedish long-distance trade and shipping and the\n\nestablishment of Swedish consular services around the world, and a survey\n\nof St. Barthélemy’s role in the Swedish transatlantic trade. Holger Weiss\n\nhas surveyed the current state of knowledge about the involvement of\n\nDenmark-Norway, Sweden, Courland, and Brandenburg in the slave trade\n\nand shows how the geopolitical positions of these states conditioned the\n\nway they participated in the slave trade. It also pinpoints lacunae in the\n\nresearch, particularly concerning Swedish slave trade and slavery. He is also\n\namong the first to study race and urban slavery in Gustavia at the end of\n\nthe eighteenth century.23\n\nThere are however several forthcoming studies on St. Barthélemy. The\n\nfirst is the research project of Fredrik Thomasson of Uppsala University,\n\nwhich will result in a book on the legal system of St. Barthélemy, centering\n\non the law and praxis of slavery in the colony.

Both of these works are due to be finished or published\n\nin 2016. Holger Weiss has continued work on the Swedish slave trade\n\nthrough St. Barthélemy, as well as a study on the spatial dimension of race\n\nand urban slavery in Gustavia in the late 18th century.24\n\nPerspectives on International Smuggling and Informal Trade\n\nOne could well place the commercial history of St. Barthélemy within\n\nthe organizing frame of reference that is ‘Atlantic history’. The rise to\n\nprimacy of the European economy and the increase in Atlantic trade\n\nduring the Early Modern period have been highly significant events in the\n\nhistory of the world, and the linking of the two has given rise to the vast\n\nbody of work contained within Atlantic history. There is however a\n\npronounced difficulty in situating the needle’s eye of Gustavia within such\n\na large framework. True enough, it can be argued that the colony inevitably\n\nplayed a minor role of the wider machinery of merchant capitalism that\n\nwas so prevalent within what historians call the Atlantic World. Still, I\n\nargue that the body of evidence unearthed during the course of working\n\nwith this dissertation comes out heavily in favor of a sub-regional rather\n\nthan supra-regional perspective. This could be described as an inverted\n\nvariation of Peter Coclanis’ criticism of Atlantic history.

There are\n\nother objections to the choice of Atlantic History, for instance the\n\noveremphasis on the core-periphery relationship between colony and\n\nmotherland. There is also a tendency within Atlantic history to focus\n\npolitically confined Atlantics, such as the “Dutch Atlantic,” or the “Danish\n\nAtlantic.” Even though Atlanticists often explicitly reject the national\n\nconfines of traditional imperial history, boundaries based on territory and\n\neven language are often the chief considerations which define the\n\nframeworks of individual studies in Atlantic History. For this reason,\n\nAtlantic historians have been criticized for the inherent arbitrary and\n\nahistorical elements which their work can sometimes display, but the\n\nrecent trend in Atlantic History is to increasingly focus on inter-imperial\n\nand transnational aspect, and many have deliberately marginalized the old\n\nmetropole-colony or core-periphery relationships.25\n\nIf the focus is not on national frameworks or empires, the picture can\n\nbe rendered quite differently. A viable alternative is to concentrate on the\n\ngeneral history on regional trade and smuggling. Research centering on the\n\nphenomenon of smuggling and illicit trade has elicited a few recent debates\n\nregarding merchant commerce within and between empires. A related\n\nstudy, Cathy Matson’s Merchants and Empire. Trading in Colonial New York,\n\nexamines attitudes towards mercantile regulations and the subsequent\n\ncrisis in imperial relations between the United Kingdom and their\n\nAmerican colonies. Her study displays very clearly the difficulty in pinning\n\ndown any consistent economic ideology among merchants who\n\ncontinuously traded across imperial borders, and with enemies of their\n\n25 Peter Coclanis, “Drang Nach Osten: Bernard Bailyn, the World-Island, and the Idea of\n\nAtlantic History,” Journal of World History 13, no. 1 (2002): 169–82; Peter Coclanis, “Atlantic\n\nWorld or Atlantic/World?” The William & Mary Quarterly 63, no. 4 (2006): 725–42; Pierre\n\nGervais, “Neither Imperial, Nor Atlantic: A Merchant Perspective on International Trade\n\nin the Eighteenth Century,” History of European Ideas 34 (2008): 465–473; Michael Jarvis, In\n\nthe Eye of All Trade.

Her explicit attempt at problematizing and understanding\n\nmerchant ideology and mentalities is one of the few of its kind, as most\n\nauthors and scholars rarely question or scrutinize smuggling and informal\n\nmodes of economic activity, let alone make it a central focus of their\n\nwork.26\n\nIn general, historians have tended to be highly ambiguous in the overall\n\ntreatment of smuggling. Smuggling as a phenomenon has several\n\nconceptual problems as well as with empirical evidence. Illicit trade could\n\ngo on seamlessly if officials and bureaucrats were in compliance, and\n\nreliable quantitative data is therefore very rare. It is also hard to define a\n\ngiven commercial transaction between nations or between regions as legal\n\nor illegal, as that distinction often hinged on imperfect and diverging law\n\ntexts, and, most importantly, their interpretations. In reality, one nation’s\n\nlegitimate merchant was another nation’s smuggler. Among scholars, the\n\nunproblematic acceptance of smuggling as a matter of fact tends to prevail,\n\nand it is present for instance in the work of Truxes, whose Irish merchants\n\nin New York were loyal subjects to the Crown but merely considered their\n\n“business to be business,” even if it entailed trading with the enemy. In\n\naccordance with this perspective, smuggling and interloping were simply\n\nstaples of colonial life. It was a condition grown naturally out of the\n\nprevailing governance based on the ‘salutary neglect’ of relatively\n\ndecentralized empires such as Great Britain. One extreme view however\n\nsees smuggling as a purely illegal activity, perpetrated by avaricious\n\nmerchants and pursued by conscientious administrators, a story of good\n\nand evil very much present in Pares and others’ expositions. More recent\n\ncontributions such as Pearce have however shown quite convincingly that\n\nthis is in many cases a false dichotomy. According to this perspective,\n\ninter-imperial smuggling furthered national interests through the access to\n\nforeign markets and was indeed very much supported in the strategic\n\nthinking of imperial leadership. This view holds that neutral traders and\n\nsmugglers were simply go-betweens, even “dogsbodies and pawns” of\n\n26 Cathy Matson, Merchants and Empire.

This argument also serves as an explanation why neutral\n\ntrade was exercised and tolerated to such a large extent.27\n\nIndeed, similar arguments are not confined to colonial empires within\n\nthe Western Hemisphere. An example is the Danish East Indian trade\n\nduring the late eighteenth century. Through his doctoral thesis, India\n\nTrade under the Danish Flag (1969), Ole Feldbæk raised very serious doubts\n\nabout just how Danish this trade was. He argued that the Danish India\n\ntrade was an element in European expansion in India and that it cannot be\n\nviewed as an isolated Danish activity but was instead largely based on the\n\ncapital which British subjects, both those in the employ of the East India\n\nCompany and those who were not, brought back to Europe. This so-called\n\nremitted Anglo-Indian capital was brought home by ships flying the\n\nDanish flag, because it had often been acquired in an illegal manner\n\ndirectly or indirectly at the expense of the British East India Company, as\n\nthe latter had a monopoly on direct sea journeys between India and\n\nBritain. During the American War of Independence, the Danish Asiatic\n\nCompany thus financed almost the whole of its India trade with capital it\n\nhad borrowed from the employees of its British competitor company.\n\nFeldbæk’s book therefore supports the view put forward by Holden Furber\n\nthat all the other European nations involved in India contributed willingly\n\nor unwillingly to the establishment of British domination in the subcontinent. It is also a valid question if a similar development could be\n\ntraced in the Americas and West Indies at the beginning of the eighteenth\n\ncentury, where the Caribbean Sea not only became a British territory due\n\nto its maritime superiority, but due to commercial circumstances as well.28\n\n27 Simon Middleton, review of Defying Empire.

European Enterprise and AngloIndian Remittance and Trade (Lund: Studentlitteratur, 1969); In 1971 Ole Lange published an\n\narticle on the Danish China trade during the nineteenth century. It shows how British\n\nmerchants in Canton used the Dannebrog (the Danish national flag) as a flag of convenience.\n\nSee Ole Lange, “Denmark in China 1839–65: A Pawn in a British Game,” The Scandinavian\n\nEconomic History Review 19 (1971): 71–117.\n\n30\n\nFeldbæk’s dissertation was criticized by some Danish historians at the\n\ntime of publication, among whom it has been traditional to interpret the\n\nDanish East India trade as an arena of commercial prowess of domestic\n\nmercantile dynasties rather than as a straw man for foreign smuggling. The\n\nextant research on Danish West Indies displays similar national\n\ninterpretations. For instance, the main town capital of the Danish colony\n\nSt. Thomas, Charlotte Amalie, and its history as an international entrepôt\n\nin the Caribbean, has tended to be treated more as an anomaly rather than\n\nas the integral economic society of the early modern Caribbean that it\n\narguably was.29\n\nThe general reluctance to adopt a more pragmatic view of smuggling\n\nand illicit trade, and to interpret border-traversing merchant activity in the\n\nearly modern period as driven by something else than treacherous greed\n\nand self-interest is largely due to the nation state paradigms, but it might\n\nalso find part of its explanation in a long-standing consensus of sorts\n\namong historians. The “mercantilist consensus” is the tendency,\n\nparticularly among Atlanticists, early Americanists and British scholars of\n\nempire, to stress the centrality of mercantilism in the organization of the\n\npre-revolutionary Atlantic, and the assumption that there was a consensus\n\nof mercantilist thought in European commercial and high society. It might\n\ngo a long way in explaining the discrepancy of narratives of mercantile\n\nbehavior, as its inherent logic quite easily leads to the interpretation that\n\nsmugglers and interlopers were simply persons who subverted the\n\nprevailing mercantile order solely for private gain. Up until recently, there\n\nhas been very little new debate regarding the true nature and operation of\n\nmercantilist consensus, but scholars have begun to question the very\n\n29 The only article which soundly contradicts this statement about St. Thomas scholarship is\n\nSvend-Erik Green-Pedersen, “Colonial Trade under the Danish Flag.

It has also become more common to move away from the\n\nperspective of empire, the nation state, as well as centers and peripheries.\n\nA range of new works emphasize inter-colonial networks and\n\ndevelopments not under imperial purview, but through the selforganization of peoples within the colonial territories.31\n\n1.3 Questions, Prospectus, and Methodology\n\nThe overarching question this study strives to answer is simply what role\n\nthe free port of Gustavia came to play in the Caribbean transit trade during\n\nthe international conflicts between 1793 and 1815? A fundamental element\n\nof the study is the assumption that smuggling – all part and parcel of the\n\nregional transit trade – was a natural and integral element in the Caribbean,\n\nespecially during wartime. Against the background of debates about\n\nsmuggling in the early modern Atlantic world, it will be of particular\n\ninterest to investigate whose interests the existence and operation of the\n\nfree port ultimately favored? Should Gustavia and its commercial\n\n30 Steve Pincus, “Rethinking Mercantilism: Political Economy, the British Empire, and the\n\nAtlantic World in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries,” The William & Mary Quarterly\n\n69, no. 1 (2012): 3–34.\n\n31 For recent developments see for instance Cathy Matson, “The Atlantic Economy in an Era\n\nof Revolutions: An Introduction,” The William & Mary Quarterly 62, no. 3 (2005).\n\n32\n\noperation be viewed as an isolated Swedish project, or as an institution that\n\nwas a convenient subterfuge for commercial actors of one or several\n\nnations, or as part of a larger imperial design, where neutral traders simply\n\nfunctioned as middlemen? Can and should Gustavia be included in a longer\n\nnarrative of free trade in the Western hemisphere?\n\nThe study is limited to the period of the French Revolutionary and\n\nNapoleonic Wars because it represents the only period during which\n\nGustavia enjoyed considerable commercial activity. As will be showed\n\nfurther on, Gustavia descended into a rapid economic decline after the\n\nconclusion of hostilities in 1815. However, it is not possible to completely\n\nadhere to the natural terminus of 1815 in a few instances where it becomes\n\ntoo restrictive. In the context of this thesis, there are two such cases. One\n\nis the transatlantic and intra-Caribbean slave trade covered in chapter 3,\n\nwhich, contradictory to the general development, was a feature of Gustavia\n\ntrade well into the 19th century. The other case is the relationship of\n\nGustavia with the privateering economy of the South American Wars of\n\nIndependence, which lasted until the consolidation of independence of\n\nmost insurgent states towards the end of the 1820s. This relationship is\n\ndeveloped in chapter 5.3.\n\nStructure of the Study\n\nThe chapters of this study are organized according to different research\n\ntopics and questions. Chapter 2 and its subchapters mainly explore the\n\ncontextual questions surrounding the Caribbean region’s political and\n\neconomic history, highlighting the integral importance of smuggling and\n\nillicit trade for colonial societies for centuries since their first settlement\n\nand exploitation by Europeans. It also contains the background of Swedish\n\ncolonization and its preconditions, ambitions and outcomes. The chapter\n\nattempts an analysis of the ultimate significance of the colony for Sweden\n\nand Swedish interests. It further investigates the institutional conditions\n\nand possibilities offered by the neutral free port of Gustavia for\n\ninternational commerce. It also strives to answer contextual questions\n\n33\n\nsurrounding the nature and operation of illicit trade, as well as highly\n\nrelated phenomena such as piracy, privateering and maritime warfare\n\nconducted through Gustavia. These institutional preconditions will be\n\nanalyzed critically in order to assess the viability of the free port in the\n\nwider commercial activity of the Caribbean.\n\nChapter 3 is a systematic account and assessment of the St.\n\nBarthélemy’s involvement in the transatlantic and intra-Caribbean slave\n\ntrade. It includes a general survey of the character and function of St.\n\nBarthélemy in the wider slave trade enterprises of the Atlantic world, as\n\nwell as a general history of Swedish involvement in the slave trade and its\n\ndevelopment towards abolition. Finally, a statistical assessment of the\n\nscope, frequency, and trajectory of the St. Barthélemy slave trade\n\nconcludes the chapter. A central problem for the chapter is the\n\nnomenclature of Swedish slave trade and the categorization of different\n\nslave trade enterprises affiliated in any manner with the Swedish colony.\n\nChapter 4 arrives at the central section of the study. Through a\n\nchronological exposition, the history of the transit trade via Gustavia is\n\ninvestigated, and key events and turning points are analyzed. The chapter\n\nemploys the bulk of empirical findings through a combination of database\n\nand source analysis.\n\nAnalytical frameworks – the Inter-Imperial Microregion\n\nA compelling alternative framework of analysis has been proposed by\n\nJeppe Mulich in the form of the inter-imperial microregion, based on the\n\ngeographic experience of the Danish West Indies. Mulich submits that\n\nthe Danish West Indies could be best understood through an\n\nunderstanding of the inter-imperial microregion it was situated within, the\n\nLeeward Islands (Figure 1.1). As an analytical construct, the inter-imperial\n\nmicroregion focuses on the density of networks and interactions found in\n\ncertain areas with multiple competing polities. The Leewards certainly was\n\nsuch an area. Though its islands are comparatively smaller to the wider\n\nCaribbean, with Saba being the smallest at 13 sq. km and Guadeloupe the\n\n34\n\nlargest at 1,628 sq. km, it nevertheless included territories claimed by no\n\nless than five colonial powers. The British dominated ownership with\n\nsome of its lesser colonies in the wider Caribbean region, administratively\n\nsplit between the British Virgin Islands to the northwest and Anguilla,\n\nAntigua, Barbuda, Montserrat, St. Kitts and Nevis in the core islands.\n\nThey were also separated from Barbados to the far windward, the oldest\n\nBritish colony in the region.\n\nFrance held the largest agricultural colonies in the region, Guadeloupe\n\nand Martinique in the far southeast. While the French occupied the\n\nlargest relative amount of territory in the Leewards, the British presence\n\nwas dominating. Royal Navy patrols were based on the chief Caribbean\n\nstation at Antigua, while subordinate stations were localized on Jamaica\n\nand Barbados. The Vice Admiralty Court of Antigua handled cases of\n\nmaritime predation and seizure, and its subordinate courts in Tortola, St.\n\nKitts, Nevis, Montserrat and Dominica were equally competent in issuing\n\nletters of marque to privateers. In times of war, therefore, British maritime\n\npower was highly tangible in the Leewards. The French colonies of\n\nGuadeloupe and Martinique, while substantial producers of tropical\n\nstaples, were minor possessions compared to the wealthy sugar economy\n\nof Saint-Domingue. But after the latter colony’s trajectory towards\n\nrebellion by its freedman and slave population, which led to sovereignty\n\nfrom France, Guadeloupe and Martinique remained as strongholds of\n\nFrench interests in the region. Guadeloupe became a bastion of\n\nRevolutionary military efforts after 1794, as the local commissaires\n\nreorganized the armed forces and authorized hundreds of privateers to\n\nattack shipping throughout the West Indies. The privateering economy of\n\nGuadeloupe brought great wealth to the French colonies in lieu of\n\nplantation agriculture. Like Saint-Domingue, however, the French\n\ncolonies in the Lesser Antilles were also left deeply affected by the\n\nRevolution, and experienced decades of social upheaval in the wake of\n\ninternal conflicts between royalists and patriots, the latter of which\n\nintroduced and implemented the ideas of the French\n\n35\n\nFigure 1.3 The Leeward Islands and their polities, ca. 1785\n\nRevolution in the colonies. These developments in turn spilled over into\n\nneighboring colonies in the region, who were affected not in the least by\n\nthe resulting migration movements and maritime warfare. Aside from the\n\nregional power structure which created real barriers for free movement\n\nand trade, there were also aspects which furthered the communication\n\nover imperial borders- Institutions of finance and postal services were for\n\ninstance located in the colonies of larger empires, especially Britain.\n\nInhabitants of the lesser colonies depended on these for their own\n\nimmediate and long-term needs. Networks of kinship and commerce\n\ntranscended any and all borders, and the proclivities of supply and demand\n\ncreated the incentive to traverse them. The Leewards were interspersed\n\n36\n\nwith smaller Danish, Dutch, and Swedish colonies. The free ports were\n\nspecial institutions situated in St. Eustatius, St. Thomas, and St.\n\nBarthélemy all created a sort of imperial crossroads where even\n\nrepresentatives of warring nations could meet and barter on neutral\n\nground. The nature and function of various free ports will be further\n\ndiscussed and elaborated in chapter 2.1.\n\nWhatever the relative merits of this construct, one should of course\n\nkeep in mind that it contains its own arbitrary and constraining elements.\n\nEconomic, political, and social connections can be discerned in every\n\ndirection outside the Leewards. St. Thomas and St. Eustatius certainly had\n\nestablished trade contacts with more westward Spanish and French\n\ncolonies like Puerto Rico, Santo Domingo, Cuba and Saint-Domingue,\n\nwhile almost every colony in the wider Caribbean had close contacts with\n\nAmerican merchants. In fact, the Chesapeake as well as other maritime\n\nports in the circum-Caribbean could easily be added to compose a wider\n\ninter-imperial macroregion if one were so inclined. In a reflection on the\n\nAtlantic economy during the late 18th-century period of revolutionary\n\nunrest, Cathy Matson has pointed out what has long been a truism in the\n\ncolonial history of the Americas:\n\n[…] the economic opportunities and failures of every region in the\n\nWestern Hemisphere became interdependent, shaped by Continental\n\nEuropean wars, the vagaries of the weather, internal agricultural\n\nmarkets, consumer demand, personal commercial networks, and\n\ngovernment policies.32\n\nThe crucial point here is not to construct the most rigidly defined\n\nregional perspective, but merely to make visible the contours of regional\n\nnetworks and relationships in focus. The sub-regional perspective in use in\n\nthis study puts its primary attention on the immediate relationships\n\nbetween the Leeward Islands and their particular place within the circumCaribbean, without neglecting the wider relationships with Northern and\n\nSouthern America, Europe, and Africa.\n\n32 Matson, “The Atlantic Economy,” 358–57.\n\n37\n\nWhatever the changing geographic perspective, the object of the\n\nresearch in this study is trade. As stated above, this trade can have a number\n\nof different labels, ranging from smuggling, contraband trade, informal\n\ntrade, transit trade, all used interchangeably. The only common\n\ndenominators for this trade was that it was supranational, i.e. intercolonial, and that it was some form of commercial transaction that could\n\nbe considered illegal at least from the vantage point of at least one of the\n\ncolonial powers involved. Insofar as an effective geographic demarcation\n\nis concerned, this study is solely interested in any trade under the auspices\n\nof the Swedish colony of St. Barthélemy, either Swedish-registered or\n\nsimply passing through Gustavia.\n\nArchives, Sources, and Methodology\n\nThis study makes use of a large corpus of a previously unexploited sources,\n\nthe FSB or the local St. Barthélemy government archive. The material,\n\nconsisting of the Swedish administrative records of St. Barthélemy.\n\nPortions of this collection have been microfilmed in turns beginning from\n\nthe 1950s, and kept in copies both at ANOM and SNA. Unfortunately\n\nthese reproductions are inadequate for extensive reading and\n\ninterpretation, and the majority of the volumes have remained\n\nunreproduced. Only a small number of Swedish and French authors have\n\nmade use of this material. The archive yields unique opportunities to\n\nunderstand and make light of the Swedish colony’s economic role in the\n\nCaribbean transit trade. It is an exceptional source for the maritime and\n\ncommercial life of the Caribbean around the beginning of the 19th century.\n\nHeaded by Fredrik Thomasson of Uppsala University, a small number of\n\nscholars including the author was given access to the previously closed\n\narchives of the FSB in through a project in 2011. Since then, the material\n\nhas gradually been digitally reproduced. The work with quantitatively\n\nuseful material has necessitated the creation of databases in order to\n\ncollect, record, organize, and analyze large quantities of information. In\n\nthis thesis, three separate datasets have been created for various purposes.\n\n38\n\nThese are (1) the Wilson dataset on the transit trade of St. Barthélemy and\n\nSt. Thomas, (2) Wilson dataset on the Swedish slave trade, and (3) the\n\nWilson dataset on St. Barthélemy mariners. Throughout the thesis they\n\nare referred to in the presentation of various charts, tables, and aggregate\n\nfigures on economy, statistics, shipping and demography. The datasets\n\nhave been constructed from a wide range of different sources not\n\nrestricted to the FSB. In total, they contain nearly 10,000 separate entries\n\non ship registrations, voyages, as well as individual actors collected over a\n\nspan of five years. Despite the varying quality of the records and the\n\ninformation they contain, the creation of aggregates and statistics through\n\ndatabase software has made analyses of general trade patterns and\n\nindividual merchant activity possible. Further details and examples of the\n\ndatasets involved are found in Appendix VI.\n\nAssessments and analyses of the sources have however at least three\n\nmajor limitations in this context. The first concerns the state and\n\ncomposition of the archive. It is in many instances impossible to make\n\ngood quantitative datasets as the sources lack in chronological continuity\n\n(long time-series), contain limited or incomplete information, as well as\n\nthe fact that a great of the material is too damaged or illegible for extensive\n\nuse. The other limitation is due to the nature of the subject at hand. Illicit\n\nor informal trade leaves comparatively little in the way of reliable\n\ndocumentation, except in certain cases were traders were apprehended\n\nand prosecuted. While this means that accurate figures and estimations of\n\ncommercial activity are near impossible to surmise, it is however possible\n\nto supplement available evidence with other quantitative indicators such\n\nas public revenue figures and statistics, as well as with qualitative\n\nstatements and testimonies. The third and final limitation is the\n\nelementary problems associated with a critical reading of the sources. Both\n\nquantitative figure as well as correspondence and reminiscences are highly\n\ncomplicated historical sources in terms of what kind of information they\n\ncarry. They are shaped and fashioned according to the tendencies and\n\nwhims of their authors as well as the contemporary circumstances they\n\nwere created in. These problems are of course not confined only to this\n\nmaterial, they are ubiquitous in all the material used by the historian. To\n\n39\n\nthis end sources will be compared, contrasted, and scrutinized accordingly,\n\nin order to arrive at plausible conclusions and interpretations.\n\nThe primary source material is not confined to the administrative\n\narchives of St. Barthélemy. In order to answer the comparative ambitions\n\nof this thesis, a range of different national archives have been consulted.\n\nIn total, the national archives of Sweden, Denmark, France, Great Britain\n\nand the United States all contain pertinent records to provide comparative\n\ninsights into the role of St. Barthélemy in the Caribbean. These range from\n\ndiplomatic and consular correspondence to administrative reports and\n\ncompiled statistics. The United States posted consuls in St. Barthélemy\n\nand neighboring colonies starting from 1797, who answered to the\n\nSecretary of State. Their reporting contains invaluable information about\n\nthe American commerce directed via St. Barthélemy. Reports from\n\ngovernors and magistrates in the British and French colonies likewise\n\ncontain a wealth of information about the Swedish colony and its intercolonial relationships. For comparative purposes the trade and activities\n\nof other free ports is analyzed when appropriate. The material in the\n\nDanish National Archives that is used in this study pertains solely to the\n\nrecords of St. Thomas, as it is an important source on the free port trade\n\nin the region. This method is adopted to contrast and gauge the relative\n\nimportance of Gustavia with other free ports in the regional transit trade.\n\n40\n\n2 The Free Port Institution of Gustavia\n\n2.1 A History of Free Trade in the Circum-Caribbean\n\nThe political and economic geography of the eighteenth century\n\nCaribbean was highly heterogeneous. While empires had laid claim to vast\n\nstretches of territory in Caribbean waters, the nature of these claims were\n\nlimited to the effective control over narrow corridors and strips of land,\n\nsmall enclaves, fortified towns, and the sea-lanes in between them.\n\nTerritorial control has, furthermore, not been the principal aim of most\n\nempires in history. Early modern European maritime empires display this\n\npoint emphatically. It has been observed, for instance, that both Spain and\n\nPortugal understood the Treaty of Tordesillas not as an agreement to split\n\nthe globe into realms of sovereignty, but rather spheres of influence. The\n\ncenturies-long scramble for colonies by European empires made its mark\n\non the Caribbean Sea, as conflict and rivalry ensured that there was no\n\n‘peace beyond the line’. The expression denominated the world west of the\n\nlongitude of the outermost of the Azores and south of the Tropic of\n\nCancer. The concept of ‘the line’ was often a representation of the\n\nlawlessness of the New World compared to the lawful, well-defined realms\n\nof European rulers.1\n\nBut there was also an opposite tendency in the form of colonial and\n\ninter-imperial networks, which seemed to emerge seamlessly despite bitter\n\nand continuous colonial rivalries. Economic necessities, ambitions of\n\n1\n\nLauren Benton, “Legal Spaces of Empire: Piracy and the Origins of Ocean Regionalism,”\n\nComparative Studies in Society and History 47, no. 4 (2005); 706–21; Eliga H. Gould, “Zones of\n\nLaw, Zones of Violence: The Legal Geography of the British Atlantic, circa 1772,” The\n\nWilliam & Mary Quarterly 60, no. 3 (2003): 471–510; Carl Bridenbaugh and Roberta\n\nBridenbaugh, No Peace Beyond the Line. The English in the Caribbean 1624–1690 (New York:\n\nOxford University Press, 1972), 3–5.\n\n41\n\nwealth, and regional trade patterns all conspired to forge informal\n\nnetworks of information and contraband trading that clashed with the\n\nprotectionist goals of legal frameworks. Furthermore, the proximity\n\nbetween empires of different nations mattered immensely for the interimperial bonds that cropped up in the Caribbean. It has been argued that\n\nthere was “a Caribbean reality of a regional community where geographic\n\nproximity was often more important than national boundaries.” Nowhere\n\nin the world did such a dense collection of colonies exist with different\n\nimperial allegiances. These regional conditions as well as their\n\nconsequences will be the subject of this chapter, leading finally towards the\n\nmajor role of free ports in furthering regional contacts.2\n\nMonoculture, monopoly, and colonial dependence\n\nThe cultivation of sugarcane and its refinement into sugar, molasses, and\n\nrum became the cornerstone of most West Indian colonial economies.\n\nDepending on the circumstances, other crops added to the variety of\n\ncultivation. Caribbean staples included tobacco, cotton, coffee, cocoa,\n\nindigo, as well as other dyestuffs, fruits and spices. But among all of the\n\nstaple crops produced in the Caribbean, sugar dominated. During the\n\nseventeenth and especially the eighteenth century, sugar production\n\nexperienced unprecedented growth as the demand swelled in European\n\nmarkets. The production of colonial staples created enormous wealth and\n\nit shaped the social conditions involved in its production in a fundamental\n\nway. It engaged thousands and thousands of settlers, cultivators, planters,\n\nagents, merchants, mariners and craftsmen. Its labor-intensive needs led\n\n2\n\nThe quote is from Julius Scott III, “The Common Wind: Currents of Afro-American\n\nCommunication in the Era of the Haitian Revolution,” (Unpublished Ph.D. dissertation,\n\nDuke University, 1986), 68; Klooster, “Transnationalism ‘Beyond the Line’, 1655–1763,”\n\n(Paper presented at the 19th International Congress of Historical Sciences, Oslo, 6–13 August\n\n2000), 11.\n\n42\n\nto the enslavement of millions of Africans, who toiled and suffered\n\nthrough “one of the harshest systems of servitude in history.”3\n\nThe relative value of sugarcane over any other crop led to the sacrifice\n\nof all the best land in the colonies. Often perceived as the principal object\n\nof colonization in the West Indies, sugar prevailed over bare subsistence\n\ncrops and pasture for livestock. Sugar monoculture in the Caribbean had\n\nmany extreme expressions, but Barbados are among the foremost of them.\n\nEighty percent of the land in Barbados in 1767 was devoted to sugar cane.\n\nSome of the Caribbean island economies were more diversified, especially\n\nthe larger islands with more geographic variation such as Jamaica, SaintDomingue and Cuba. These had greater preconditions for self-sufficiency,\n\nbut were nevertheless in essence agricultural economies dominated by\n\ncolonial staples intended for export. West Indian societies, with their\n\nlarge chattel workforces, in the face of which most white elites lived in\n\nconstant fear, were dependent on the outside world. They depended on\n\nimportations of food. They needed grain, livestock and fish to feed large\n\nslave populations. They depended as well on the necessaries for island\n\ninfrastructures, ship- and housebuilding, and the artisan industries.\n\nDeforestation, hurricanes and the volcanic geology of most islands\n\nnecessitated importation from external sources most of the required\n\nlumber, lime, stone and metal. Vast amount of wood and staves were\n\nsimply needed for the manufacture of crates and barrels essential to export\n\nthe produce of plantation labor. Households and administrative bodies\n\nneeded the smallest refined products such as paper, paint, oils, fats, ink and\n\ncandles. There was hardly any indigenous production of these necessaries\n\nof life in the highly specialized and bureaucratic societies of the colonial\n\nAmericas.4\n\n3\n\nRichard S.

The effort to do\n\nthis within the Spanish empire was articulated by the carrera de las indias, a\n\nsystem of regular transatlantic shipments and convoys. The carrera as well\n\nas other schemes nevertheless quickly turned out to be insufficient.\n\nShipments were seldom large enough to meet colonial demand, and they\n\nwere furthermore often infiltrated by foreign cargoes. Dutch and English\n\nmerchants were among the first entrepreneurs to exploit the convoy\n\nsystems, who sold their merchandise to Spanish merchants or simply used\n\nthem as figureheads for their own commercial voyages. After centuries,\n\nSeville and Cádiz became home to sizeable cohorts of foreign merchants\n\nactively engaged in the trade with South America. When they finally\n\nsettled in colonies of their own instead of simply encroaching on Spanish\n\nterritories, other European powers harbored ambitions of unrestricted\n\ntrade with bullion-rich Spanish America. Silver was, in the eyes of the\n\ngovernments of fiscal-military states, a premium commodity. The asiento\n\nde negros can be said to be an illustration of these conditions. The asiento\n\nwas the license given by the Spanish government to other countries for a\n\nmonopoly on the African slave trade to Spanish territories in the New\n\nWorld. On the one hand, it exemplified the Spanish empire’s inability to\n\nsupply its growing plantations with enough slaves, and the pragmatic\n\nattitude to foreign profits in colonial trade. On the other hand, the asiento\n\ncame to be regarded as the ultimate prize by European governments, who\n\ncompeted to secure it for themselves.5\n\nIn reality, imperial regulatory power was often more circumscribed\n\nthan what many scholars have characterized them to be. Inter-imperial\n\nsmuggling became a time-honored tradition with some strong elements of\n\ncommunal solidarity in colonies in the face of imperial authority.\n\nSmuggling was often condoned or overseen by colonial magistrates, who\n\neither were forced to accept its necessity for the economic life or indeed\n\nsurvival of the societies they were appointed to govern. In other cases, it\n\nwas socially necessary for the colonial administrator to look between his\n\n5\n\nPearce, British Trade, 11–15, 18–25; Klooster, “Inter-Imperial Smuggling,” 154–56, 165.\n\n44\n\nfingers because suppression of illicit commerce would elicit widespread\n\nprotests or even persecution. In the colonial Americas, there were\n\nnumerous accounts of customs collectors and coast guards whose work was\n\nobstructed, even to the point where coast guard vessels were burned and\n\noffensive characters were tarred and feathered by angry mobs. Restrictive\n\nmeasures could lead to full-blown rebellions, as enforcement of unpopular\n\nlaws were seen as an affront to colonial inhabitants’ way of life.6\n\nHowever, the authorities’ limited means to exert power alone do not\n\nexplain the complicity in contraband trade or other irregularities. Officials\n\nof every rank had to foment good relations with colonial elites, and it was\n\nthese elites that quite often had a large stake in illegal imports and exports,\n\nif not also the officials themselves. Officials connived at the contraband\n\ntrade, then, for they were after all members of the communities in which\n\nthey resided and had to maintain their most important personal\n\nrelationships. Connivance had its roots elsewhere than only the\n\ncorruptibility of officials. Local elites exerted a strong pressure on colonial\n\nauthority and the practice of everyday decision-making. Sentiments and\n\nloyalties could go any which way. Connivance for colonial authorities was\n\nsimply a way in which to respond to the mixture of loyalty and opposition\n\nthey encountered among the local elite. Compromises were deemed\n\nnecessary, for strict adherence to the law might prove untenable in a\n\ncolonial situation, or even incompatible with the interests of colonial\n\ncommerce. Enforcing the law was on occasion considered a greater threat\n\nto communal peace than connivance. Peace and quiet often trumped over\n\nstrict considerations of law and prohibition. Occasionally the officials\n\ntook the issue of law enforcement seriously, if only to play to the gallery in\n\nthe metropole. They could always sidestep restrictions by issuing\n\ntemporary trading licenses to foreigners, by invoking public needs in the\n\nface of emergencies such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and fires.\n\n6\n\nKlooster, “Inter-Imperial Smuggling,” 170, 175.\n\n45\n\nOccasionally, however, governors only fabricated or misrepresented the\n\nexistence of an emergency in order to bypass inconvenient restrictions.7\n\nSometimes even national policy came into play when trade restrictions\n\nneeded to be skirted. Great Britain, with its dominating navy, had since\n\nthe period of the Seven Years’ War asserted control over colonial\n\nwaterways and set about disrupting transports of colonial produce from\n\nthe West Indies to France. France countered by lifting its prohibitive\n\ncolonial policies and promptly opened up its trade to neutrals. Neutrals, in\n\nthis context, effectively meant the Dutch. The purpose of this move was\n\nto take advantage of the simple fact that Britain had since long a “free\n\nships-free goods” commitment to the Netherlands dating from a treaty in\n\nThe measure naturally provoked a strong response from the British\n\nGovernment, which saw fit to invent a far-reaching judicial doctrine,\n\nwhich came to be known as the “rule of 1756.” The doctrine held that as a\n\nmatter of general international law, as opposed to the limited scope of any\n\ntreaty interpretation, neutrals were not to be allowed to enter into a new\n\ntrade relationship during wartime which was closed to them in peacetime.\n\nThe positive effect of this doctrine was now that any neutral ship is good\n\nprize if it sails under enemy license or charter. The rule could be\n\nsummarized as holding that neutrals were entitled to trade with the enemy,\n\nbut not for him.8\n\nNeutral traders however quickly devised various stratagems and\n\ntechniques to circumvent it. One of the most obvious and important\n\nmethods was to launder enemy colonial goods by simulating their entry\n\n7\n\nKlooster, “Transnationalism ‘Beyond the Line,’” 6–8; Jacques Mathieu, Le commerce entre\n\nla Nouvelle-France et les Antilles XVIIIe siècle (Montréal: Fides, 1981), 212–13; Sherry\n\nJohnson, Climate and Catastrophe in Cuba and the Atlantic World in the Age of Revolution (Chapel\n\nHill: University of North Carolina Press, 2012), 193–202.\n\n8\n\nStephen Neff, The Rights and Duties of Neutrals: A General History (New York: Manchester\n\nUniversity Press, 2000), 65–66; Stephen Neff, “Britain and the Neutrals in the French\n\nRevolutionary Wars: The Debate over Reprisals and Third Parties,” in Trade and War: The\n\nNeutrality of Commerce in the Inter-State System, ed. Koen Stapelbroek (Helsinki: Helsinki\n\nCollegium for Advanced Studies, 2011), 229–50; Victor Enthoven, “Neutrality: Atlantic\n\nShipping in and after the Anglo-Dutch Wars,” in Mercantilism Reimagined: Political Economy\n\nin Early Modern Britain and Its Empire, ed. Philip J. Stern and Carl Wennerlind (Oxford:\n\nOxford University Press, 2014), 328–47.\n\n46\n\ninto a neutral port. Thus a merchant vessel would land, or at least certify a\n\nlanding in writing, a cargo in a neutral port after arriving from an enemy\n\nmarket, only to carry it further to the enemy motherland, i.e. France. On\n\nthe first leg of this voyage, the cargo would be safe from capture, because\n\nit would consist of neutral goods, that is, goods consigned to a neutral party\n\nin a neutral state, while the goods still came from an enemy colony. On the\n\nsecond leg of this journey, the goods would also be protected from capture,\n\nprovided that they were carried on a neutral party’s own account, and not\n\nconsigned to any identified enemy party in the destination, the enemy\n\nstate. Various instances of this method, particularly performed by\n\nmerchants in the Thirteen Colonies, was already common during the\n\nSeven Years’ War, and the British quickly introduced an additional rule,\n\nor, the continuous-voyage doctrine, holding that such interrupted-voyage\n\nschemes actually constituted one continuous voyages and thus were in\n\nviolation of the rule of 1756.9\n\nWhereas smuggling in itself often found tacit or open acceptance by\n\ncolonial leadership, the role of foreigners in domestic and colonial trade\n\nwas always viewed to be detrimental. Colonial societies were often\n\nethnically mixed and large cohorts of foreigners usually made up a\n\nsignificant portion of populations. The Dutch were often viewed as a\n\nproblem. The crucial role of the Dutch in the carrying trade of several\n\nnations was indeed a large part of the impetus behind exclusivist trade\n\npolicies such as the Navigation Acts of 1651. The role of the Dutch in\n\nFrench domestic commerce was crucial, and was mirrored by similar\n\nactivities in the French colonies. A great number of Dutch traders lived\n\nand worked in the French Caribbean during the course of the 17th century,\n\nand sizeable portions of the French residents in the colonies were debtors\n\nin Dutch banks and commercial firms. The most extreme form of French\n\nmercantilist measures took place in the French part of St. Kitts in 1663,\n\nwhen over sixty Dutch warehouses were set on fire, and was followed by a\n\n9\n\nNeff, Rights and Duties, 65–68.\n\n47\n\nrange of prohibitions and other legal measures by the French to reassert\n\ntheir authority in the colonies.10\n\nIn the long run, however, smuggling and border-crossing trade\n\nintensified, and was already universal at the beginning of the 18th century.\n\nA great source of smuggling endeavors besides the Spanish-bound\n\ncommerce was the shipping of British North America. Respective\n\nproblems with their mother countries brought on a close relationship\n\nbetween the British colonies and the French West Indies. An expanded\n\ndemand in British North America for French colonial sugar and its byproducts spelled out a solution for aggrieved French sugar cultivators, who\n\nhad problems selling their rum and molasses to France. The illicit imports\n\nof sugar, rum, and molasses into the British North American colonies from\n\nforeign colonies was a thorn in the side of the British planters and the\n\nBritish West Indian interests in general. In 1733 Whitehall passed the\n\nMolasses Act in response to the dwindling legal trade of the sugar islands.\n\nThe Molasses Act imposed heavy duties on rum, molasses, and sugar\n\nimported into the American colonies from foreign colonies. The British\n\nWest Indian interest, a powerful lobby in parliamentary circles, hoped\n\nthus to force British American colonists to buy from only their own, more\n\nexpensive sugar products. In the ports of New England, the stipulations of\n\nthe Act were however subject to routine evasion and obstruction. Bribery\n\nat a customary rate which was only a fraction of the statutory tax share of\n\nthe value of foreign goods to customs officials was generally enough to\n\nclear customs at New York and Massachusetts.11\n\nDuring the conflicts of the 18th century, however, smuggling and illicit\n\ntrade could not operate by way of direct exchanges. Neutral shipping and\n\nfree ports became crucial institution by which the continuity of the system\n\nwas guaranteed. Their establishment and history is paramount to the\n\nunderstanding of trade in the region.\n\n10 Klooster, “Inter-Imperial Smuggling,” 158–59.\n\n11 Klooster, “Inter-Imperial Smuggling, 170–71; ”Victor Enthoven, “’That Abominable Nest\n\nof Pirates’: St. Eustatius and the North Americans 1680–1780,” Early American Studies 10, no.\n\n2 (2012): 239–301.\n\n48\n\nFree Ports and Neutral Subterfuges\n\nWith the passage of time, neutral free ports gradually emerged as\n\nconvenient marketplaces that facilitated commerce between traders of\n\nvarious nationalities. These ports were either formally declared free ports,\n\nor had simply evolved into de facto free ports after decades of established\n\npractice. Immediately from its first colonization, the English at Jamaica\n\nexploited the island’s strategic location in the center of the West Indies to\n\nmake it an entrepôt in the Spanish colonial trade. Merchants settled in\n\nJamaican Port Royal conducted their commerce all along the Spanish\n\nMain and in the traditional smugglers’ dens in the islands. By providing\n\nslaves, these merchants were also capable of trading at the principal ports\n\nof Portobello, Cartagena, and Havana. This trade, a precursor of the sugar\n\neconomy of the island, accumulated riches and allowed the prospering\n\nmerchants to invest their windfall into the island’s plantation hinterlands.\n\nThe prosperous period was however cut short when Port Royal was\n\ndestroyed by a devastating earthquake in 1692, causing large portions of\n\nthe town to fall into the sea.12\n\nThere were other locales of informal trading which essentially were not\n\nport towns or proper marketplaces. In 1750, by royal dispensation, the\n\nSpanish crown had granted San Fernando de Monte Cristi of Santo\n\nDomingo the right to trade for ten years with ships of all nations that were\n\nat peace with Spain. Monte Cristi was a sparsely settled village on the\n\nnorthwestern tip of Santo Domingo. At the time Monte Cristi was not\n\neven a proper seaport. The entire Bay of Monte Cristi, was little more than\n\nthe home of a few fishermen and their families. Its proximity to the SaintDomingue border and its free trade status however made it to one of the\n\nlargest commercial subterfuges during the Seven Years’ War. There\n\n12 Nuala Zahedieh, “The Merchants of Port Royal, Jamaica, and the Spanish Contraband\n\nTrade, 1655–1692,” The William & Mary Quarterly 43, no. 4 (1986): 570–93; Nuala Zahedieh,\n\n“Trade, Plunder, and Economic Development in Early English Jamaica, 1655–1689,” The\n\nEconomic History Review 39, no. 2 (1986): 205–22; Allan Christelow, “Contraband Trade\n\nbetween Jamaica and the Spanish Main, and the Free Port Act of 1766,” Hispanic American\n\nHistorical Review 22 (1942), 312.\n\n49\n\nemerged at Monte Cristi became a thinly disguised market for North\n\nAmerican, Irish, British, and neutral European provisions, lumber, and\n\nnaval stores, as well as slaves and the usual, large variety of manufactured\n\nconsumer goods. The return cargoes in exchange for these wares consisted\n\nof the produce of the Saint-Domingue plantation economy. Short\n\nsmuggling runs to Cap François on the French side could be arranged by\n\nhaving the crews of foreign ships replaced with a Spanish ones in the Bay.\n\nThe new crews would then head westwards by sea while the original crew\n\ntook the land route to market in Cap François. As much as 150 vessels\n\ncould be moored in the Bay at a given day, and made it essentially into a\n\nfloating city, where goods changed hands on seaboard rather than on\n\nshore.13\n\nThe Dutch were however the most established operators of Caribbean\n\nfree ports. The Caribbean islands of Curaçao and St. Eustatius were the\n\nessential hubs through which the Dutch interacted with and traded in the\n\nregion. These colonies also became two of the most important subterfuges\n\nin established colonial systems. The shippers and traders of these colonies\n\nemployed the strategies and tactics of the kleine vaart (small navigation),\n\nthat is, expeditions with small, fast-sailing boats in an unfettered interisland commerce. Access and closeness markets were key in this trade,\n\nwhich explains why Curaçao traded mainly on the Caracas coast and St.\n\nEustatius traded principally with the French Antilles. While European\n\ngoods flowing to the Caracas coast became the essential condition for\n\nCuraçao, the burgeoning American trade to the French colonies became\n\nthe hallmark for St. Eus"
