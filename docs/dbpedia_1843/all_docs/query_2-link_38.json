All it does for Japan is add a macron to the final \"o\" of Hokkaido.\n\nCountry overview:\n\nShort nameJAPAN ISO codeJP FIPS codeJA LanguageJapanese (ja) Time zone+9 CapitalTokyo\n\nIn 1900, Japan consisted of its present territory plus two major components. Taiwan, then more often called Formosa, with the Pescadores Islands, had been conquered from China and made a Japanese colony in 1895. The Kuril Islands, known to the Japanese as Chishima, had been annexed from Russia in 1875. Japan acquired additional lands as a result of the Russo-Japanese war of 1905: the southern half of Sakhalin Island (Karafuto in Japanese), the Kwantung peninsula, and other strongholds in Manchuria. Korea became a Japanese protectorate in 1905-12, then a colony on 1910-08-22. In 1920, by the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, Japan picked up the former German islands of Micronesia, making them its territory of Nanyo. In 1931, it invaded Manchuria, and set up the puppet state of Manchukuo there the following year. As World War II drew near and broke out, Japan extended its military occupation to much of the Far East and the Pacific. When the war ended in 1945, all of these conquests were taken from Japan, and restored, as far as possible, to their former status. Some of the islands in the southern chains, notably Okinawa, were placed under U.S. military administration, but later reintegrated into Japan. Nanyo became a trust territory of the United States on 1947-04-02. Japan still asserts its claim to the southern Kuril Islands, including Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan, Shibotsu, and Suisho, which have been administratively part of Russia since the war's end.\n\nSpelling note: Although several different transliteration methods have been used to convert from Japanese characters to the Roman alphabet, there is a surprising degree of unanimity about the Romanized form of Japanese place names, even in the other languages covered here. In some references, macrons are used to indicate long vowels. ISO standard 3166-2 is an exception; it uses a different transliteration method (and uses circumflex accents instead of macrons). Names as shown by ISO will be found under \"Other names of subdivisions\". (ISO also appends the generic -Ken, -Do, -Fu, or -To to the prefecture name, as in Aichi-Ken or Osaka-Fu. This form often appears in postal addresses, too.)\n\nOther names of country:\n\nDanish: Japan\n\nDutch: Japan\n\nFinnish: Japani\n\nFrench: Japon m\n\nGerman: Japan n\n\nIcelandic: Japan\n\nItalian: Giappone m\n\nJapanese: Nihon (formal), Nippon (formal)\n\nNorwegian: Japan\n\nPortuguese: Japão m\n\nRussian: Япония\n\nSpanish: Japón m\n\nSwedish: Japan\n\nTurkish: Japonya (formal)\n\nOrigin of name:\n\nChinese ri: sun, ben: origin (i.e. land of the rising sun)\n\nPrimary subdivisions:\n\nJapan is divided into 43 ken (prefectures), one to (metropolis - Tokyo), one do (territory - Hokkaido), and two fu (urban prefectures - Kyoto and Osaka). The four words are combined in one, todofuken, to denote a division of any type.\n\nPrefectureHASCISOFIPSPopulationArea(km.²)Area(mi.²)RegionCapital AichiJP.AI23JA017,410,7195,1051,971ChubuNagoya AkitaJP.AK05JA021,085,99711,6094,482TohokuAkita AomoriJP.AO02JA031,373,3399,6143,712TohokuAomori ChibaJP.CH12JA046,216,2895,1031,970KantoChiba EhimeJP.EH38JA051,431,4935,6642,187ShikokuMatsuyama FukuiJP.FI18JA06806,3144,1881,617ChubuFukui FukuokaJP.FO40JA075,071,9684,9341,905KyushuFukuoka FukushimaJP.FS07JA082,029,06413,7815,321TohokuFukushima GifuJP.GF21JA092,080,77310,5964,091ChubuGifu GummaJP.GM10JA102,008,0686,3562,454KantoMaebashi HiroshimaJP.HS34JA112,860,7508,4533,264ChugokuHiroshima HokkaidoJP.HK01JA125,506,41978,51530,315HokkaidoSapporo HyogoJP.HG28JA135,588,1338,3623,229KinkiKobe IbarakiJP.IB08JA142,969,7706,0872,350KantoMito IshikawaJP.IS17JA151,169,7884,1961,620ChubuKanazawa IwateJP.IW03JA161,330,14715,2775,898TohokuMorioka KagawaJP.KG37JA17995,8421,877725ShikokuTakamatsu KagoshimaJP.KS46JA181,706,2429,1493,532KyushuKagoshima KanagawaJP.KN14JA199,048,3312,384920KantoYokohama KochiJP.KC39JA20764,4567,1062,744ShikokuKochi KumamotoJP.KM43JA211,817,4267,3832,851KyushuKumamoto KyotoJP.KY26JA222,636,0924,6121,781KinkiKyoto MieJP.ME24JA231,854,7245,7742,229KinkiTsu MiyagiJP.MG04JA242,348,1657,2882,814TohokuSendai MiyazakiJP.MZ45JA251,135,2337,7342,986KyushuMiyazaki NaganoJP.NN20JA262,152,44913,5855,245ChubuNagano NagasakiJP.NS42JA271,426,7794,0981,582KyushuNagasaki NaraJP.NR29JA281,400,7283,6921,425KinkiNara NiigataJP.NI15JA292,374,45012,5774,856ChubuNiigata OitaJP.OT44JA301,196,5296,3312,444KyushuOita OkayamaJP.OY33JA311,945,2767,0792,733ChugokuOkayama OkinawaJP.ON47JA471,392,8182,244866RyukyuNaha OsakaJP.OS27JA328,865,2451,845712KinkiOsaka SagaJP.SG41JA33849,7882,416933KyushuSaga SaitamaJP.ST11JA347,194,5563,7991,467KantoSaitama ShigaJP.SH25JA351,410,7774,0161,551KinkiOtsu ShimaneJP.SM32JA36717,3976,6272,559ChugokuMatsue ShizuokaJP.SZ22JA373,765,0077,7703,000ChubuShizuoka TochigiJP.TC09JA382,007,6836,4142,476KantoUtsunomiya TokushimaJP.TS36JA39785,4914,1441,600ShikokuTokushima TokyoJP.TK13JA4013,159,3882,145828KantoTokyo TottoriJP.TT31JA41588,6673,4921,348ChugokuTottori ToyamaJP.TY16JA421,093,2474,2521,642ChubuToyama WakayamaJP.WK30JA431,002,1984,7221,823KinkiWakayama YamagataJP.YT06JA441,168,9249,3253,600TohokuYamagata YamaguchiJP.YC35JA451,451,3386,0902,351ChugokuYamaguchi YamanashiJP.YN19JA46863,0754,4631,723ChubuKofu 47 divisions128,057,352372,273143,732\n\nISO: Codes from ISO 3166-2. These codes are used in Japanese government\n\npublications, which list prefectures sequentially by code. They basically run from\n\nnorth to south.\n\nFIPS: Codes from FIPS PUB 10-4.\n\nRegion: The prefectures are grouped into the regions listed below.\n\nHASC: Hierarchical administrative subdivision codes.\n\nPopulation: 2010-10-01 census.\n\nRegions have no administrative function. Hokkaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku correspond to three of the main islands of Japan. Ryukyu consists of smaller islands in the south.

Earlier versions of the current system used only the first three or first five digits.\n\nFurther subdivisions:\n\nSee the Counties of Japan page.\n\nThe prefecture-level units are subdivided into gun (counties), shi (cities), shicho (branch administration), and one \"area\", which corresponds to the 23 wards of Tokyo.\n\nAlan Pritchard writes that the divisions of Japan are on six levels. He has received some of this information from a Japanese organization, the Council of Local Authorities for International Relations.\n\nOn the highest level, below Japan itself, come the 43 ken (prefectures), one to (metropolis), one do (territory), two fu (urban prefectures), and twelve serei shitei toshi (specially designated cities; Saitama's website says that it is now the thirteenth). They are all listed in \"Administrative Subdivisions of Countries\" except for the specially designated cities, which are commonly grouped with the prefectures in which they are located. The Japanese word for the type of division is normally suffixed to the name of the division, e.g., \"Aomori-ken\".\n\nOn the second level are gun (counties) and shi (cities). The counties have no administrative function. They are groups of rural municipalities that are used for postal purposes. Each prefecture is completely subdivided into counties and cities.\n\nOn the third level are shi (cities), machi and cho (both translated as towns), mura and son (villages), and ku (wards; in Tokyo only). I have seen it stated that the name Tokyo doesn't represent a city, but only a prefecture (Tokyo-to). Japanese use the phrase \"the twenty-three wards\" to refer to what outsiders think of as the city of Tokyo. Each of these wards has its own local administrations, similar to a city's. \"Municipalities\" is a generic term comprehending cities, towns, and villages.\n\nOn the fourth level are ku (wards) outside of Tokyo. I assume that these are divisions of cities, and not found in towns or villages.\n\nThe fifth level includes machi and cho. In some cases, machi and cho on the fifth level are subdivisions of machi and cho on the third level. If my understanding is correct, the fourth-level wards and the fifth-level machi and cho are mutually exclusive, so it would also make sense to combine them into a single level.\n\nFinally, on the sixth level are chome (districts). Most of them are numbered rather than named: 3-chome, etc.\n\nThis account omits the nine regions, which are groups of prefectures, but don't have any administrative function.\n\nTerritorial extent:\n\nEach prefecture except Okinawa lies mainly on one of the four large islands: Hokkaido, Honshu, Kyushu, and Shikoku. (The island locale of each prefecture can be deduced from the region column above.) Most prefectures also contain some smaller islands. This list shows these additional islands roughly in decreasing order of size.

Data for 1920-1990 are from source [1], except that the 1950 census is from source [3]. Source [1] agrees with source [3] when rounded to the nearest 1,000, but source [3] doesn't include Okinawa; therefore, I took the 1950 Okinawa population from source [1], and combined it into the total, which is therefore an approximation. Data for 2000 are from source [5]. Data for 2010 are from source [8], which matches the more official source [7] except that figures in source [7] are rounded to the nearest thousand.\n\nSources:"
