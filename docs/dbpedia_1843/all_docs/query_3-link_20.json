        "text": "Magadan Oblast is one of the main areas with a high concentration of residents belonging to the indigenous small-numbered peoples of the North and other long-established inhabitants.\n\nIn the course of privatisation, the interests of the indigenous peoples of the North were unfortunately overlooked. As a result, the peoples find themselves in an extremely difficult state, as it is impossible to maintain or expand the following traditional subsistence activities: hunting (sea and land); reindeer and domestic animal husbandry; fishing; obtaining, processing and marketing of marine resources; fur farming; collecting and marketing of wild foodstuffs, etc.\n\nSmall, indigenousrun enterprises based upon these crafts cannot compete with the national and international companies active in the Magadan Oblast. Native enterprises are handicapped by a lack of knowledge regarding management, marketing, taxes, law and other vital information necessary for the successful management of such businesses in an economically competitive environment."
