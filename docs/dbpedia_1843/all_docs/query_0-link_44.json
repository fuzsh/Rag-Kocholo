        "meta_description": "Abstract. In 2018, 70Â years have passed since the beginning of observations at the Kolyma Water-Balance Station (KWBS), a unique scientific research hydrological and permafrost catchment. The volume and duration (50 continuous years) of hydrometeorological standard and experimental data, characterizing the natural conditions and processes occurring in mountainous permafrost conditions, significantly exceed any counterparts elsewhere in the world. The data are representative of mountainous territory of the North-East of Russia. In 1997, the station was terminated, thereby leaving Russia without operating research watersheds in the permafrost zone. This paper describes the dataset containing the series of daily runoff from 10 watersheds with an area from 0.27 to 21.3â¯km2, precipitation, meteorological observations, evaporation from soil and snow, snow surveys, soil thaw and freeze depths, and soil temperature for the period 1948â1997. It also highlights the main historical stages of the station's existence, its work and scientific significance, and outlines the prospects for its future, where the Kolyma Water-Balance Station could be restored to the status of a scientific research watershed and become a valuable international centre for hydrological research in permafrost. The data are available at https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.881731.",

Up-to-date evaluation of dams is unavailable, and basin-wide hydropower potential has yet to be systematically assessed. We present a comprehensive database of 1055 dams, a spatiotemporal analysis of the dams, and a total hydropower potential of 1 334 683 MW. Considering projected dam development and hydropower potential, the vulnerability and the need for better dam management may be highest in Laos.\n\nA global dataset of the shape of drainage systems\n\nChuanqi He, Ci-Jian Yang, Jens M.

Satellite altimetry observations of water heights can be utilized to calibrate and validate large-scale hydrodynamic models. However, because large-scale models are discontinuous, comparing satellite altimetry to predicted water surface elevation is difficult. We developed a satellite altimetry mapping procedure for high-resolution river network data.\n\nMultivariate characterisation of a blackberry-alder agroforestry system in South Africa: Hydrological, pedological, dendrological and meteorological measurements\n\nSibylle Kathrin Hassler, Rafael Bohn Reckziegel, Ben du Toit, Svenja Hoffmeister, Florian Kestel, Anton Kunneke, Rebekka Maier, and Jonathan Paul Sheppard\n\nEarth Syst.

First, station locations do not fit the high-resolution river network. We update the database with stations based on a new high-resolution network. Second, station locations do not work with a coarser grid-based network. We use a new basin shape similarity concept for station locations on a coarser grid, reducing the error of assigning stations to the wrong basin.\n\nA long-term dataset of simulated epilimnion and hypolimnion temperatures in 401 French lakes (1959â2020)\n\nNajwa Sharaf, Jordi Prats, Nathalie Reynaud, Thierry Tormos, Rosalie Bruel, Tiphaine Peroux, and Pierre-Alain Danis\n\nEarth Syst.

The signal observed by a single CRNS sensor is influenced by the SWC in a radius of around 150 m (the footprint). Here, we have put together a cluster of eight CRNS sensors with overlapping footprints at an agricultural research site in north-east Germany. That way, we hope to represent spatial SWC heterogeneity instead of retrieving just one average SWC estimate from a single sensor.\n\nA long-term monthly surface water storage dataset for the Congo basin from 1992 to 2015\n\nBenjamin M.

The data set is unique as the different compartments of the landscape were sampled and the effects of a prolonged drought (2018–2020) captured by a marked negative rainfall anomaly (the most severe regional drought of the 21st century). Thus, the data allow the drought effects on water storage, flux and age dynamics, and persistence of lowland landscapes to be investigated.\n\nRegional data sets of high-resolution (1 and 6 km) irrigation estimates from space\n\nJacopo Dari, Luca Brocca, Sara Modanesi, Christian Massari, Angelica Tarpanelli, Silvia Barbetta, Raphael Quast, Mariette Vreugdenhil, Vahid Freeman, AnaÃ¯s Barella-Ortiz, Pere Quintana-SeguÃ­, David Bretreger, and Espen Volden\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 15, 1555–1575, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-1555-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-1555-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIrrigation is the main source of global freshwater consumption. Despite this, a detailed knowledge of irrigation dynamics (i.e., timing, extent of irrigated areas, and amounts of water used) are generally lacking worldwide. Satellites represent a useful tool to fill this knowledge gap and monitor irrigation water from space. In this study, three regional-scale and high-resolution (1 and 6 km) products of irrigation amounts estimated by inverting the satellite soil moisture signals are presented.\n\nLake surface temperature retrieved from Landsat satellite series (1984 to 2021) for the North Slave Region\n\nGifty Attiah, Homa Kheyrollah Pour, and K. Andrea Scott\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 15, 1329–1355, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-1329-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-1329-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLake surface temperature (LST) is a significant indicator of climate change and influences local weather and climate. This study developed a LST dataset retrieved from Landsat archives for 535 lakes across the North Slave Region, NWT, Canada. The data consist of individual NetCDF files for all observed days for each lake. The North Slave LST dataset will provide communities, scientists, and stakeholders with the changing spatiotemporal trends of LST for the past 38 years (1984–2021).\n\nGlobal hourly, 5 km, all-sky land surface temperature data from 2011 to 2021 based on integrating geostationary and polar-orbiting satellite data\n\nAolin Jia, Shunlin Liang, Dongdong Wang, Lei Ma, Zhihao Wang, and Shuo Xu\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 15, 869–895, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-869-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-869-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSatellites are now producing multiple global land surface temperature (LST) products; however, they suffer from data gaps caused by cloud cover, seriously restricting the applications, and few products provide gap-free global hourly LST. We produced global hourly, 5 km, all-sky LST data from 2011 to 2021 using geostationary and polar-orbiting satellite data. Based on the assessment, it has high accuracy and can be used to estimate evapotranspiration, drought, etc.\n\nCited articles\n\nACIA, Impacts of a Warming Arctic: Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, Cambrige University Press, 2004\n\nArctic Observatory Network (AON): International Study of Carbon, Water, and Energy Balances in the Terrestrial Arctic, available at: http://aon.iab.uaf.edu, last access: 8 January 2018.\n\nArp, C. and Stuefer, S.
