        "text": "Driving across Siberia\n\nI have an exciting but crazy plan to travel around Europe and into the United States via Alaska from Russia with my dogs, a friend and caravan! Is this a completely nutty scheme, and is it even possible?\n\nEmma MacLeod, by email\n\nWonderful idea, but sadly it's impracticable. Four-wheel drive enthusiasts and motorcyclists do occasionally drive through Russia and, except for some impassable stretches of road, it is possible to get from one end of the country to the other.\n\nThat said, they're usually aiming for Vladivostock, in the South East.Travelling to the far North East entails taking two truly remote road odysseys from Tynda, which is on the Baikal Amur Railway, to Yakutsk and then the Kolyma highway, which runs for around 1,200 miles to Magadan, on the Pacific. This has a gruesome history and is known as the 'road of bones' after the prisoners who died building it.\n\nTo do these extremely rough journeys you'll need a well-equipped four-wheel-drive vehicle, plenty of off-road driving experience and mechanical knowledge and the ability to speak very good Russian. There is a snag, however: you'll have to ditch the caravan and the dogs.\n\nOnce in Magadan there is no way of travelling further by land, and there's no sea link with the US from anywhere in the Russian Far East. However, Magadan Airlines (00 1 907 248 2994) flies weekly to Anchorage in Alaska for around £500 for a one-way ticket.\n\nHawaiian honeymoon\n\nWe plan to marry next spring or summer, and want to go to Hawaii for our wedding and honeymoon. We have about £5,000 for between two and four weeks. We want snorkelling, swimming with dolphins, trekking and time on a beach.\n\nWill our marriage be valid in the UK? Do we need visas for the US, and what do you suggest?\n\nJane Hayman, by email\n\nFirst, book quickly. We've had large numbers of similar questions lately. Hawaii is a popular place to marry and honeymoon, and arranging a wedding should be easy. See www.hawaii.gov/doh/records/vr_marri.html\n\nThe island of Oahu is a great place for your first few days. You can explore the mix of cosmopolitan development, beaches and tropical interior, but to get a feel for the variety of Hawaii go on to some of the other islands.\n\nThe Big Island of Hawaii is home to dramatic National Parks, where you can trek over volcanic rock formations and hike to the 13,677ft summit of Mauna Loa. Head to Maui for whale-watching, great windsurfing and beaches. There are dolphins throughout the islands, but swimming with them is illegal, and there are heavy fines for anyone approaching them in the water.\n\nBritish visitors to the US don't need visas for stays of up to 90 days. Contact the American Embassy for more details (09068 200 290).\n\nHawaiian Holidays (020 7001 9130) offer flights, hotels and honeymoons. See www.gohawaii.com for more on the islands.\n\nVolunteering in Asia\n\nI want to combine a trip abroad next year with a two or three-week placement as a volunteer in Africa or Asia. I have seen some American organisations on the internet. Can you suggest any British ones?\n\nMichael Newth, London\n\nTwo organisations run suitable projects for people wanting to do something different on their holidays. One is i-to-i (0870 333 2332). Two weeks on a conservation project in Kenya costs £645, excluding flights and visas, but with food, fees and accommodation.\n\nProjects run by Earthwatch (01865 318838) include conserving bats in Malaysia, working with temple monkeys in Sri Lanka and restoring Vietnam's forests.\n\nSicilian B&Bs\n\nHow easy would it be to find B&Bs in Sicily while touring by car? Could you advise on a source for looking up such accommodation?\n\nNashir Bharmal, Bedford\n\nIf you go between April and June or in September and October you should get into a pensioni (guesthouse) or albergi (hotel) by asking at a local tourist office. They often have English-speaking staff.\n\nAt other times of year Sicily fills up with visitors.\n\nA guidebook is essential, and it's worth looking at the Italian State Tourist Board website.\n\nOver to you... readers' feedback\n\nIn response to Ellen Friel's fears about going to St Petersburg at Christmas (2 November). Let me, as a frequent visitor, reassure her that she need have very few. Of course it will be cold but it's a very dry cold and the snow crunches romantically.\n\nSome hotels charge Western prices, but you can also stay for under £24 a night within 10 minutes' walk of Nevsky Prospekt in a place that's relatively basic, but warm, clean and, in its own way, friendly. Certainly she should not find the Russians hostile.\n\nA tourist information office on Nevsky provides information in English.\n\nMy advice is: don't stay in a hotel of international status and price. Why go to Russia to pretend to be international? Use a cheaper hotel of a good enough Russian standard, and enjoy the experience. One guide to the city's hotels, www.hotels.spb.ru, seems to cover most possibilities. The Rus Hotel has character and adequate facilities.\n\nMichael Quine"
