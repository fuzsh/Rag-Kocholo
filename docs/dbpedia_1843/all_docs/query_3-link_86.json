        "text": "I have 2 postcards travelling to Russia. One was sent 117 days ago (one of the first ones I ever sent) and another one 57 days ago. These are the only postcards I’ve sent there and so far the delivery rate is 0%. Is nayone else facing the same issue? I live in Bulgaria, our postal service is slow but still postcards have reached the USA and Indonesia which are even further away.\n\nCards to Russia can take their time, especially this year with the pandemic parc going on. Also, not all connections between countries are open at the moment (the postcrossing admins watch this, but even they are not perfect)\n\nAlso, cards can get lost at all (no matter which country), maybe by conincidence both your cards to Russia met this fate.\n\nIn the end, as with some other things in postcrossing: be patient.\n\nPostcards to Moscow or St. Petersburg travel really quickly from Germany. Other (more rural) places might take much longer, though. They often expire before being registered. Just very few don’t arrive within 365 days, though. I only have one card to the very Far East in Russia (Magadan) that will be deleted from the system tomorrow. What a pity - the user is active an registers regularly. But those things happen. Maybe that’s one of the few cards that really got lost or was eaten by the sorting machines.\n\nI sent a few cards to Russia in September and October, they arrived in reasonable time. Have two on the way right now but they were just posted last week, so it’s way too early for them to have arrived.\n\nMy experience with Moscow and St. Petersburg is quite the oppposite, though. My cards there travel usually the longest, that was also the case recently. The card to Moscow took way over a month, cards to smaller cities reached the recipients in 2-3 weeks.\n\nIn the ast, my cards from Germany to Russia usually needed between 4 and 10 weeks, so many expired before getting registered. I can’t see a significant difference between rural places and large cities like Moscow or St. Petersburg. The odd thing is that cards from Russia to me travel only 2-3 weeks. No idea why one way is so much faster than the other. I had a card sent from Germany and arriving in Murmansk in just 13 days, it arrived just a week ago. That was by far the fastet card I ever sent to Russia.\n\nMy average travel time to Russia is something like more than 50 days. Make of that what you will…\n\nRight now I have 2 lost cards to Russia, sent in February/March, and one at 58 days. I never worry about Russia because it’s totally hit and miss, and I never expect them to reach in less than a month - when they do I’m very happy!"
