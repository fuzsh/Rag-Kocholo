        "text": "NPI 1568660389 10-position all-numeric identification number assigned by the NPS to uniquely identify a health care provider. Entity Type Individual Code describing the type of health care provider that is being assigned an NPI. Codes are:\n\n1 = (Person): individual human being who furnishes health care;\n\n2 = (Non-person): entity other than an individual human being that furnishes health care (for example, hospital, SNF, hospital subunit, pharmacy, or HMO).\n\nIs Sole Proprietor Y Indicate whether provider is a sole proprietor.\n\nA sole proprietor is the sole (the only) owner of a business that is not incorporated; that unincorporated business is a sole proprietorship.\n\nIn a sole proprietorship, the sole proprietor owns all of the assets of the business and is solely liable for all of the debts of the business.\n\nThere is no difference between a sole proprietorship and a sole proprietor; they are legally a single entity: an individual.\n\nIn terms of NPI assignment, a sole proprietor is an Entity type 1 (Individual) and is eligible for only one NPI (the sole proprietorship business is not eligible for its own NPI).\n\nAs an individual, a sole proprietorship cannot be a subpart and cannot have subparts. (See NPI Final Rule for information about subparts.)\n\nA sole proprietorship may or may not have employees.\n\nOften, the IRS assigns an EIN to a sole proprietorship in order to protect the sole proprietor's SSN from disclosure in claims or on W-2s. NPPES does not capture a sole proprietorship's EIN.\n\nMany types of health care providers could be sole proprietorships (for example, group practices, pharmacies, home health agencies).\n\nProvider Last Name (Legal Name) MAGADAN The last name of the provider (if an individual).
