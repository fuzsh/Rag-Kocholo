        "text": "I'm looking for the real country, not the tourists' country. Those who travel know that it's a calling in search of wisdom, adventure, camaraderie and common purpose,\n\nIt is always a privilege to stay in one place and get to know the locals on a first name basis. Many travellers never stop anywhere long enough to make friends. because we're always on the move. There is no such things as two opposites. It only means that you each have some quality the other lacks or perhaps something the other needs.\n\nI really envy many local people I meet on my travels. They often lead hard lives but at least their lives seem easy-going. Perhaps if we worry less about life, we'd live longer. That's probably why many people in the emerging world are happier than we are.\n\nThe experience of travelling changes people over time. Let travelling change your spirit and you'll find that the old ways of dealing with life's problems simply don't work anymore."
