This includes all grades of gasoline and diesel fuel.\n\nProceeds from Fuel Good Day benefit local schools, community centres, libraries, hospitals, food banks and more.\n\nView the full list of organizations supported by your local Co-op.\n\n*Available at participating Co-op Gas Bars.\n\nFuel Good Day 2018\n\nLast year, Fuel Good Day raised more than $600,000 for over 180 local organizations and causes across Western Canada – all in a single day.\n\nMore than 400 Co-op Gas Bars throughout British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and northwest Ontario participated.\n\nWhile individual donation amounts ranged based on Co-op size and trading area, every penny positively impacted communities across Western Canada.
