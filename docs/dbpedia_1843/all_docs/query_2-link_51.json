        "text": "If you're looking for a better quality of life, look no further than SE1, according to new research, which suggests Bermondsey is the capital's most desirable postcode.\n\nAccording to the research, by Banda Property, Bermondsey is top of the postcode pops because of its \"elusive London village feel\".\n\nRead more: House price growth is driving up prosperity in cities outside London\n\nHouse prices in the area have risen 49 per cent in the past five years, with the average price now standing at £785,000.\n\nIn at number two is Shepherd's Bush, aka W12, with an average house price of £685,000.\n\nAccording to the research, it has plenty of green space (hello, Brook Green), good schools, decent transport connectivity and \"the x-factor provided by great shops and restaurants\".\n\nLondon's top 10 areas for quality of life\n\nLocation Postcode Average house price 1. Bermondsey SE1 £784,679 2. Shepherd's Bush W12 £685,215 3. Clapham SW4 £761,625 4. King's Cross N1C £778,409 5. Paddington W2 £1,313,016 6. Barnsbury N1 £778,409 7. Hampstead NW3 £1,296,346 8. Parsons Green SW6 £1,044,184 9. Earl's Court SW5 £1,292,597 10. Battersea SW11 £855,433\n\nLouisa Brodie, head of search and acquisitions at Banda, pointed out regeneration is the name of the game.\n\n“Half of the locations identified in the research have benefited from vast regeneration programmes, including Paddington, King's Cross, Shepherd’s Bush, Earl’s Court and Battersea,\" she said.\n\n\"This inward investment has grown the housing stock, improved transport links and enhanced public spaces and parks, which in turn attracts the middle classes seeking new and improved areas outside the prime zone that are within their budget.\n\n“Traditionally, 65 per cent of our property searches have taken place in the golden postcodes of Kensington, Chelsea and Knightsbridge, but this is changing fast. As a result of price growth, the higher rates of stamp duty and further uncertainty prior to Brexit negotiations, we expect to see more of the golden postcode buyers looking in areas such as Bermondsey, Paddington and Shepherd’s Bush.\""
