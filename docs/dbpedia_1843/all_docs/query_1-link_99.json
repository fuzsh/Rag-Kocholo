        "text": "I received a request yesterday for a subject to completion per plans and specs on an existing home. Not a problem, I have done many of these. The twist is today, the client sent over a message asking for an \"as is\" value on the property as well as the \"subject to completion value\" on the property. I say this is two separate appraisals. The subject closed in 6/15 for $685,000. The client stated:\n\n\"On renovation loans the appraisal is required to have an “as is” value before Construction and an “as complete” value.\n\nThe date purchased was in June, so the as-is value might be different since 6 months have elapsed.\"\n\nI maintain that there are two separate and distinct values requested and this is two separate appraisals. One appraisal is the current \"as is\" market value of the subject. The other is the current value subject to completion per plans and specs.\n\nI would love to hear what my peers would do in this instance. Thank you\n\nOne assignment.\n\nTwo valuation scenarios; two values.\n\nOne report (as a rule).\n\nConsider the following for the as-is value (I see this a lot in the renovation or new construction appraisals I review where there is a request for an as-is value): The H&BU of the subject, as-is, is likely renovation/demolition and build a new house. You should make that conclusion if that is so (otherwise, the feasibility of the renovation/new construction is questionable). For each opinion of market value you'll need a H&BU analysis.\n\nAlso, I see most reports focused on the \"as-complete\" valuation and they typically do a great job.\n\nMost of the reports do an inadequate job on the as-is value. They'll state the value rather than summarize the analysis used to make that value conclusion. In most of these assignments, the as-is value is based on the sales comparison approach. So, just as one would expect to see \"comparables\" for the as-complete value, one would also expect to see \"comparables\" for the as-is value. An exception may be if the project is far enough along its schedule that a better approach would be to deduct the costs + EI to finish the project based on its sell-price, vs. trying to find comparables that are in a similar condition.\n\nFor the as-is valuation...\n\nTear downs should be compared to tear downs (if they exist).\n\nSignificant fixers should be compared to significant fixers (if they exist).\n\nSites, ready-for-development should be compared to sites, ready-for-development (if they exist).\n\nA project that has started (say, 20% along its production-schedule) may need a combination (i.e., here's the site value, and here's the contributory value of the work that has been done).\n\nA project that is further along its production-schedule will probably be valued based on the cost (including selling costs) + EI needed for the likely buyer (probably a contractor or developer) to assume the project at that stage and finish it.\n\nOne last word: If your subject is a tear down, then it is effectively a site, ready for development project. I've seen reports that have used other tear-downs, but then they make adjustments for differences in the improvements (GLA, bed/bath, etc.). This is illogical since the presumption is that the subject should be torn-down as should the tear-down comparables. In other words, no one is paying anything for the differences in the improvements since that is not what they are purchasing (they are purchasing the site with the intent of tearing down what exists); so if the subject is a tear down and your other comparables are tear downs, I'd advise against adjusting for improvement-differences.\n\nGood luck!"
