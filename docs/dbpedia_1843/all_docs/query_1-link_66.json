        "text": "The Ripple Effect: Nurturing Community Bonds for Our Children In the face of adversity, it's not uncommon for individuals, especially mothers, to retreat and isolate themselves. But what's often overlooked is the ripple effect this has on their children. When a mother feels isolated, her child, too, experiences that sense of solitude. At The Gatehouse, we've observed this pattern and recognize the profound need for community, not just for our adult members but for their children as well. Humans, by nature, can sometimes be self-centered, focusing on individual needs and challenges. However, the essence of community is about reaching out, connecting, and understanding that we're all part of a larger tapestry. Teaching our children the value of community, of forming bonds, and of supporting one another is a lesson that will serve them well throughout their lives. At The Gatehouse, we're committed to fostering an environment where both mothers and their children can thrive, connect, and grow together, understanding that the strength of a community lies in its bonds.

Igniting a youth‚Äôs potential to get to a place of self-sufficiency is our why. Our purpose. And they are at the heart and soul of everything we fight for. There is an infinite amount of stories that can be told from the youth who choose to share them. And we would like to start highlighting them here. Meet Jasmin: Q: Can you start by telling your name and how long you‚Äôve been at The PLACE? A: So I‚Äôm Jasmin, I‚Äôve been here for almost four years. I came here when I was 14 and I‚Äôm now 17. The PLACE and Outreach in general have been such a help. It‚Äôs a good spot to hang out, a spot to eat, get set up on housing. There‚Äôs a lot of good stuff. It‚Äôs just a really good place to be when you don‚Äôt really know how to move forward Q: Can you tell me your favorite memory of The PLACE? A: So one of my favorite memories was when the drop in center was starting off and I started meeting a ton of people. And Eric, one of the therapists who‚Äôs making soups, which he still does. He still brings soups and we got to do a bunch of painting. And I remember the conversation. We were all talking about what we‚Äôre going to do in the future. And so far we are getting that stuff done still. Q: Can you share a memory that you have of group or of what art means to you? A: There‚Äôs a painting here at Drop In with a black canvas. I had actually done that one in group and I was sitting there and I was like upset. And then we got to paint and stuff and I just kind of put my emotion out while painting and then we would talk it over and all that. It‚Äôs kind of a good way to step back. And because you can get really stressed when you have all these things, like oh I need to apply for housing and to apply of a job, I need to get my ID. I can get very overwhelming. And then being able to step aside, paint, draw, sketch, whatever you really need. There‚Äôs also yarn and stuff.‚Äù #YouthEmpowerment #ColoradoSprings #AffordableHousing #COS #YouthVoices\n\n#ParentingTipNumber6 Take the time to use your time and talent to serve others in your neighborhood and community. Setting the example for our children, by using our time, our talent and our abilities to serve others give them a picture of what it means to be part of a neighborhood and a community. When we discuss the service that we‚Äôre giving and why we‚Äôre giving it we give children a clear picture of what it means to be a good neighbor and a good service oriented person. Be sure to take your kids with you from time to time. Talk about what you‚Äôre doing and ask them about things that may be important for them and serving neighbors and other community members.\n\nJohns Hopkins Press - Available fall 2024 Redlining Childhood: The Survivornomics of America's Neglected Neighborhoods Lorece V. Edwards Promotional Headline: A searing portrait of young Black people‚Äôs day-to-day lives growing up in marginalized communities‚Äîand how to help. In neglected neighborhoods across the United States, violence, food insecurity, unstable housing, racist policies like redlining, lead poisoning, and other factors negatively impact young people‚Äôs everyday experiences‚Äîand their futures. What opportunities are available to young Black people living in these neighborhoods? What are their survival expectations? Who can they look to for support? In this searing portrait of today‚Äôs youth, Lorece V. Edwards offers a thought-provoking and timely account of the day-to-day experience of living in America‚Äôs neglected neighborhoods. Edwards examines the reality of growing up Black in marginalized communities and provides a nuanced, systems-level perspective of their daily lives. Many of the practices for which these young people are demonized are simply survival strategies. Structural violence plays a key role in their opportunities to be successful. Using Baltimore as case study, Edwards examines the historical roots of how these neighborhoods developed, from the detrimental impacts of the 1930s historical redlining policies to continued disinvestment in Black communities. The narrative is enriched through the poignant, firsthand accounts of youth who live in these neighborhoods. Incorporating the results of longitudinal research projects focused on sexual health, homelessness, substance use, community violence, ACEs, communicable diseases, complex and historical trauma, and decision-making among minority youth residing in the inner city, Edwards provides recommendations for how to address systemic issues and change the trajectory of these children‚Äôs futures. Lorece V. Edwards (BALTIMORE, MD) is a full professor of public health at Morgan State University's School of Community Health and Policy."
