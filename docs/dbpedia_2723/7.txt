“Deliver Us From Evil,” Amy Berg’s important, hard-to-watch debut feature, is not the first documentary about the sexual abuse scandals in the Roman Catholic Church — Kirby Dick’s “Twist of Faith” was nominated for an Oscar last year — and it will probably not be the last. Pedophilia is not a subject most are eager to think about, but these days it seems impossible to avoid. Neither sensationalistic nor sentimental, Ms. Berg’s film is clear-sighted, tough-minded and devastating, a portrait of individual criminality and institutional indifference, a study in the betrayal of trust and the irresponsibility of authority.

What gives the film some of its unnerving power is that, in addition to giving voice to some of the victims of abuse, it spends a lot of time with a perpetrator. Oliver O’Grady is now a silver-haired, twinkly-eyed resident of Ireland, where Ms. Berg often films him in parks and near playgrounds, with children nearby. In the 1970’s and 80’s, while serving as a parish priest in several towns in Central California, he molested children over and over again, both boys and girls, including, it is reported, a 9-month-old.

Perhaps the creepiest thing about Mr. O’Grady — who was eventually imprisoned, unfrocked and deported to Ireland, where he had grown up — is the contrast between his present demeanor and his past actions. When recalling his crimes, he sometimes chuckles, not spitefully but almost warmly, as if what he had done were silly rather than unspeakably sordid. Although he does not deny anything, he takes refuge in euphemism, explaining that he was often “overly affectionate” with his young parishioners and apologizing for having “offended” them.

His mild, almost merry manner stands in brutal contrast to the pain expressed by Bob and Maria Jyono, whose daughter, Ann, was among Mr. O’Grady’s victims. Mr. Jyono, a Japanese-American Buddhist, converted to Catholicism when he married his wife, whom he met in Ireland. Mr. O’Grady — then Father O’Grady — became a virtual member of their family, spending many nights in their home while he was molesting their daughter. “Molesting? He raped her,” Mr. Jyono, a quiet, thoughtful man, cries out at one point, and his anguish at the violation of his daughter, his trust and his faith is almost unbearable to witness.

But Ms. Berg pushes further, sifting through videotaped depositions of some of Mr. O’Grady’s supervising bishops, including Roger Cardinal Mahony, the current archbishop of Los Angeles, to argue that the culpability is not Mr. O’Grady’s alone. In a pattern by now familiar, Mr. O’Grady’s superiors dealt with the threat he posed by transferring him from one parish to another, where he was free to find new prey. Reports were filed, claims were made, but the eminences have only vague recollections and abstractions to offer. It almost goes without saying that no one from the church agreed to be interviewed in the film.

That silence — affirmed when Ann Jyono and another of Mr. O’Grady’s victims, Nancy Sloan, are turned away by guards at the Vatican as they try to deliver a letter to the newly installed Pope Benedict XVI — cedes the floor to the church’s critics. These include Father Tom Doyle, a canon lawyer and historian who has become a leading advocate for survivors of clerical sexual abuse; Mary Gail Frawley O’Dea, a psychologist; and several of the lawyers representing victims in civil suits. They all point to the hierarchical, secretive, authoritarian nature of the Roman Catholic Church as a central reason for its failure to deal effectively with the likes of Mr. O’Grady.

It would be interesting to hear a response, apart from the canard that the sexual abuse crisis in the church is actually anti-Catholic bigotry or disobedience by a corrupted laity. The Los Angeles district attorney is apparently seeking further answers, spurred in part by some of Mr. O’Grady’s testimony in this film. But for now, “Deliver Us From Evil” makes the case that justice remains undone.
