        "text": "Abbas eschews Moscow meeting\n\nThe decision came after a recent summit was held in Moscow, in which 14 Palestinian factions agreed to the need for unity under the PLO banner. However, the Ramallah-based leadership did not throw its support behind the summit's outcomes, rejecting any power-sharing with Hamas. Sources in Ramallah, Doha and Amman told Al-Monitor that Abbas told Qatar and Turkey, hosts of Hamas leadership, that his repudiation comes amid concerns that taxes collected by Israel on behalf of the Palestinian Authority, which account for roughly 60% of its budget, would all be in jeopardy if the PLO absorbs Hamas. Funds from the United States and European Union could also be compromised, Abbas has conveyed.\n\nAccording to the official Palestinian news agency WAFA, Abbas has continued to make local appointments to governorships in response to recommendations from local committees — a move intended to show that he's serious about calls for reform and greater representation.\n\nHowever, the expected appointment of Mustafa has done little to lessen the activity of the caretaker government led by Mohammad Shtayyeh, who resigned as prime minister in recent weeks and collapsed his government at Abbas' behest. Shtayyeh met with European Union and Japanese officials in Ramallah last week and chaired the regular weekly morning cabinet meeting Monday for the second week in a row since resigning.\n\nPalestinian sources in Ramallah told Al-Monitor that while the Netanyahu government has been publicly hostile toward the Palestinian leadership in Ramallah, largely because Abbas has refused to denounce Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel, the head of the Palestinian intelligence, Majed Farraj, was contacted by the Israelis to help them distribute food and other humanitarian aid in Gaza. The Netanyahu government had previously said it wouldn't work with the PA but likely acquiesced at the urging of its security establishment."
