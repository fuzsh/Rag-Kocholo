        "text": "Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh said on Monday he was resigning to allow for the formation of a broad consensus among Palestinians about political arrangements following Israel's war against the Islamist group Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe move comes amid growing U.S. pressure on President Mahmoud Abbas to shake up the Palestinian Authority as international efforts have intensified to stop the fighting in Gaza and begin work on a political structure to govern the enclave after the war.\n\nHis resignation must still be accepted by Abbas, who may ask him to stay on as caretaker until a permanent replacement is appointed."
