        "text": "U.S. President Donald J. Trump has assigned a team to identify and follow up on the differing positions of Israel and the Palestinians, according to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. \"President Trump said he has a sincere intention to reach a historic peace deal,\" the Palestinian leader told the Mainichi Shimbun in an interview held in Ramallah, by Mainichi's Jerusalem Bureau Chief, Tomoko Ohji.\n\nHe added that Jared Kushner and the president's special envoy Jason Greenblatt will be included in the team. The team's role would be to look into the positions of each of the parties, in order to accurately identify their different positions on each of the core issues and, at a later stage, the president could positively intervene and promote a peace deal.\n\nA Ramallah official who spoke to the Mainichi Shimbun, on condition of anonymity, said that following the meeting with Trump in Bethlehem, President Trump asked his people to invite the Palestinians and Israelis to Washington separately, to meet with Kushner and Greenblatt. It's yet unclear what should follow after these meetings, but according to the official, only when the gaps between the parties would be narrow enough, Trump might intervene. \"We're waiting for our team to be called to Washington, for meetings with a team headed by Kushner, and we hope the invitation will come sometime in June or early July,\" the official said and expressed hope that \"within two-three months we will hear results.\"\n\nPresident Abbas made it clear that the Palestinians expect any peace deal to be based on previous agreements, international resolutions and international law. \"The U.S. president knows very well the Palestinian stance, which is a demand for the implementation of international resolutions, leading to the implementation of the two-state solution, based on 1967 borders,\" President Abbas said. \"This is also what all the countries of the world have agreed to, and this includes the positions of all past U.S. administrations,\" he emphasized.\n\nPrevious attempts by the Obama administration to see progress were unsuccessful, leaving peace talks moribund since 2014, when former Secretary of State John F. Kerry's efforts to get the parties to sit around the same table encountered Palestinian refusal due to Israel's rejection of the preconditions laid by President Abbas. These included a demand that Israel freeze settlement construction and release prisoners in a move that had been previously agreed upon. Indeed, during the interview, President Abbas has emphasized several times the Palestinian dismay with Israel's settlement activities. \"All settlement activities since 1967 are illegal and violate international law,\" he said, adding that \"UN Security Council Resolution 2334 has reaffirmed that all settlement activities must be stopped.\" As for the Palestinian prisoners, a highly sensitive issue in the Palestinian public and political discourse, President Abbas told us that there is an effort to release all Palestinians imprisoned in Israeli jails. And yet, Abbas made it clear that the current efforts to renew talks are held in a \"different context.\"\n\nIn the interview, the Palestinian president utterly rejected Israeli accusations regarding incitement to violence the Palestinian Authority is allegedly responsible for. \"We have expressed our position clearly, that we renounce violence and incitement, and we are working to spread the culture of peace among our people,\" Abbas reiterated, and made it clear that the solution to violence lies with an end to the occupation and the settlements. \"This will help promote peace throughout our region,\" he said in what seems as a reference to the regional deal President Trump is trying to promote.\n\nHowever, the Palestinian president did express willingness to tackle the problem of incitement, which is an issue both parties will need to address. \"We have repeatedly called for the revival of the Palestinian-American-Israeli trilateral committee on halting incitement, in order to address all relevant issues in this context,\" Abbas told the Mainichi Shimbun, referring to the committee which was active from 1998 to 2000.\n\nDespite some expectations in the days and weeks preceding President Trump's visit to the region, hopes for a regional peace conference may have been premature. \"No regional conference has been discussed with us,\" he told the Mainichi Shimbun.\n\nAs for what was discussed in the meeting in Bethlehem, Abbas told the Mainichi Shimbun that he has assured Trump of the Palestinian commitment to peace. The U.S. president seems to have been persuaded, and in his Israel Museum speech later that day he has assured Israelis that the Palestinian president truly wants peace. \"I can tell you that he is ready to reach a peace deal,\" Trump said about Abbas in his keynote speech in Jerusalem. \"We have assured (President Trump) that the choice we have made is for a two-state solution, based on the 1967 borders,\" Abbas told the Mainichi, reiterating the Palestinian vision for peace. He added that such a peace would entail a reality in which the \"state of Palestine would exist alongside Israel, living in security, stability and good neighborliness.\" However, he emphasized, this would require an end to the Israeli occupation, in order to grant freedom and independence for the Palestinian people.\n\nIn yet another reference to the regional peace deal the Americans are seeking, Abbas stressed that a peace based on these fundamentals would enable the advancement of Israeli-Arab normalization as envisioned by the Arab peace initiative, which was reaffirmed in the recent Arab League summit, held in March in Jordan. \"It would provide the opportunity for peace to be enjoyed by all countries in the region, including Israel,\" he said.\n\n\"We have assured President Trump of our immediate readiness to work with his team in order to make his peacemaking efforts a success,\" Abbas said. Israeli officials are taking a similar tone, but while the Palestinian president reveals some flexibility and seems to have withdrawn his previous precondition for the renewal of talks, it's still not clear what Israel is willing to put on the table. The Israeli Cabinet has indeed approved some limited steps meant to relieve the Palestinian economy, but, according to reports in the Israeli media, Washington expects a far more significant gesture, such as granting the Palestinian Authority civil control over territories within area C, which are currently fully administered by Israel.\n\nAll parties involved -- the Israelis, the Palestinian leadership in Ramallah, Jordan, Egypt and the Gulf countries -- seem ready and willing to work with the new U.S. administration to promote the peace process. However, it remains to be seen if Washington will be able to harness the forces of peace in the region to the effort of promoting a process which would require painful compromises and an enduring commitment to the idea of the two states solution -- an idea which is under constant threat by extremist on both sides of the Green Line.\n\nWhen we asked President Abbas about his recent decisions to impose financial sanctions on the Hamas administration in Gaza, he made it clear that his main motivation remains the unification of the two separate parts of the Palestinian homeland. \"We seek to unify our land and our people, and any measures we take are in fact aimed at ending this division, which has harmed our national cause,\" he lamented. The Palestinian Authority aims to achieve this unification by extending the control of the national reconciliation government over to Gaza. This government, he said, \"was formed by consensus reached among all the Palestinian political factions.\" New general elections, he said, would then follow.\n\nPresident Abbas has expressed his satisfaction with the Japanese-Palestinian partnership and specifically the Jericho Agro Industrial Park project (JAIP), which is part of the Japanese government's \"Corridor for Peace and Prosperity\" initiative. The project is regarded by the Palestinian Authority as a highly important effort to revive Palestinian economy in the area, by encouraging economic cooperation between Israel, Jordan and the Palestinians.\n\n\"The Japanese are our partners,\" Abbas said, adding that \"Japan is helping Palestine.\" \"JAIP is a great project,\" he emphasized, noting that the Palestinians held great appreciation for all the assistance from Japan in all fields, but especially for JAIP. \"JAIP,\" he said, \"paves the way for more investments in Palestine, for more jobs to be created, for prosperity and peace -- because it involves all parties,\" referring to the multilateral nature of the Jordan Valley project. Japan, Abbas added, has the ability to help boost the economy and prosperity in the entire region.\n\nThe interview with President Abbas is being held on the 50th anniversary of the 1967 War, when the Palestinian territories came under Israeli occupation. On this occasion, we asked the Palestinian leader -- who himself suffered the horrors of the Israeli-Arab conflict, when he and his family were forced to flee their homeland in the 1948 War -- about this conflict which seems almost eternal. \"After 50 years, we are the only remaining people in the world, who still live under occupation,\" he replied, and stressed that it has been over 100 years that Palestinians are being actively denied of their right of self-determination. Throughout this time, the Palestinians have endured \"exile, forced displacement, occupation, subjugation, harassment and incarceration,\" he said, and lamented that \"there is no doubt that the balance of power is still weighted firmly against us.\" And yet, the ageing Palestinian leader has not lost hope. \"I believe in our people, and I believe that even under these circumstances, we can and we will prevail.\" \"We have truth on our side, and strength in our hearts,\" he said, and made it clear that the Palestinians' vision for peace remains clear and consistent: \"two sovereign and independent states, based on the 1967 borders; a state of Palestinian with East Jerusalem as its capital, living side by side in peace (and) prosperity with Israel.\" (By Guy J.
