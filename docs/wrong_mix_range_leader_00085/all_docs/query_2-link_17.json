The funds will be used to purchase equipment such as cameras and monitors to promote distance education via TV and the internet. Expanding the support to Gaza is also being considered.\n\nTsuji expressed his high hopes at the signing ceremony, saying, “I hope new technologies will lead to quality education.”\n\nPalestinian Finance Minister Shoukry Bishara expressed his gratitude, saying that the support will enhance the skills of the younger generation. Tsuji also met with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.\n\nJapan’s support for Palestine has amounted to $2.4 billion, or about ¥360.9 billion, since 1993, according to the Foreign Ministry."
