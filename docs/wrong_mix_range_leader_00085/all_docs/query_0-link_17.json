        "text": "Statement by Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ms. Yoriko Kawaguchi\n\nPeace in the Middle East , Towards the peaceful coexistence of the two states\n\nThe real chance for peace in the Middle East, which is the key for the peace and stability of the region, is emerging, when the \"Roadmap\" which shows an itinerary towards the peaceful coexistence of the two states of Israel and Palestine is expected to be announced following the inauguration of the new prime minister, Mr. Mahmoud Abbas, for Palestinian self-government Authority (PA). At this juncture, the international community needs to further assistance and cooperation. Taking the opportunity of my second visit to Israel and Palestinian territories, I call upon both Israelis and Palestinians to end violence, confirm once again a firm commitment for achieving peace in the Middle East, and announce that I am ready to take the following measures (the total amount of 22.25 million dollars) to support new prime minister, Mr. Mahmoud Abbas, thereby, promote efforts for peace in the Middle East.\n\n1. Announcement of a new assistance package for humanitarian assistance and state-building efforts by the Palestinians\n\nBased on the \"Japanese roadmap of assistance to the Palestinians\" announced at my previous visit to the region last June, Japan will provide emergency humanitarian assistance materials, humanitarian assistance including vaccines, basic services and food. For the reform efforts by the Palestinian Authority, Japan will also assist in building a new Prime Minister's office for improving the administrative capability of the Palestinian Authority, facilitating reform in the field of judiciary including training for Palestinian trainees in Jordan, and supporting job creation through restoring the infrastructure of local governments, and encouraging human resource development. Furthermore, taking security situation on the ground into account, Japan will study the possibility of dispatching JICA officers in order to strengthen the capacity to implement our assistance on the ground as well as to consolidate our local competency in executing tasks related to the \"Palestinian Reform Task Force\" in which the Government of Japan has been actively participating as a chair of the Reform Support Group on Local Government.\n\n2.

Environmental issues are borderless, and require joint cooperation by both Israelis and Palestinian sides. The Government of Japan, as a chair of the Middle East Peace Process Multilateral Negotiations Working Group on the Environment, has a great interest in improving the environmental conditions in the region and aims for joint cooperation projects between the Israeli Government and Palestinian Authorities for the protection and improvement of the environment and will assist such projects. Consequently, it will work to strengthen confidence between the two sides.\n\n(3) Hosting a Conference for confidence-building between Israelis and Palestinians\n\nOn May 19th and 20th, the Government of Japan will host a conference \"Toward Stable Coexistence of Mutually Interdependent States of Israel and Palestine\".

Especially, at the waste disposal facility in Ramallah in the West Bank, where local residents are restricted by Israeli government from accessing the waste disposal facilities in the adjacent Al Bireh city, concern over hygiene and water pollution is mounting. This assistance is for planning, implementation and monitoring of the projects for expanding the current waste disposal facility and building an alternative waste disposal, by establishing joint Steering Committee including Japan, the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority.\n\nAmount: 1.5 million dollars\n\nImplementing Organizations: Ministry of Local government, Ministry of Environment\n\n(2) Assistance for confidence building between Israelis and Palestinians\n\nThe conflict between Israelis and Palestinians has continued for the past two and a half years, causing serious casualties in terms of human life and damaged property on both the Israelis and the Palestinian sides. This also aggravates deep-rooted distrust and hatred. In order to achieve \"two-state vision,\" which aims at realizing the peaceful coexistence of the two states of Israeli and Palestine, it is necessary to promote confidence building through various levels of dialogues and cooperation. This project aims at supporting through the scheme of \"Grant assistance for grass-roots human security projects\" NGOs and local governments that carry out activities such as raising public awareness, cooperation and peace activities between Israelis and Palestinians."
