        "text": "'A lot of people criticize us,' Israeli special police officer says\n\nASHDOD, Israel - \"I've got a feeling we are all alone,\" an Israeli officer who identifies himself as a \"fighter in a special police unit,\" said late Friday night. \"A lot of people criticize us.\"\n\nNoting criticism of Israel's order for the entire population of northern Gaza to evacuate south, as well as scrutiny of some of the country's response to Hamas' unprecedented attack one week ago, the officer, who spoke under the condition of anonymity, said: \"Seeing the people hating us, they're just ... using their strength for nothing.\"\n\nThe officer said he did not want to see \"Palestinian people killed,\" but he said he felt Israel had to \"strike back\" at Hamas — even if it results in the death of civilians.\n\n\"We will never erase Gaza from the map. We will never kill 2.8 million people because that’s not us. We won’t do that,\" he said.\n\nThe left faces a reckoning as Israel divides Democrats\n\nJoel Simonds, a Los Angeles-based rabbi involved in progressive causes, has always known that many of his ideological allies did not agree with him on Israel.\n\nBut after this weekend’s terror attack, the worst killing of Jews since the Holocaust, Simonds said many liberal Jews feel abandoned by people they thought were friends, some of whom have expressed little sympathy for the Israelis killed while focusing instead on the plight of Palestinians.\n\nAmerican Jews, who are overwhelmingly liberal, have often supported social justice movements. Simonds said while most progressive leaders have offered support, he feels betrayed by others on the left who have not.\n\nIsrael has been so fraught in some progressive circles that many preferred not to talk about it, enforcing a sort of strategic silence to avoid dividing the movement and distracting it from common ground issues.\n\nThat long-stifled debate is now spilling into public view in heated and sometimes ugly ways, dividing Democrats and exposing what some say is antisemitism that has been allowed to fester on the left for years.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\n'Vengeance is not a strategy,' son of missing Israeli peace activist says\n\nThe son of Israeli peace and reconciliation activist Vivian Silver just wants what she would want: for the fighting to stop.\n\n“We need to stop the violence now,” Jonatan Zeigen said today. “Vengeance is not a strategy. We need to negotiate, and we need to get the captives out.”\n\nHis mother, 74, has been missing from her home on a kibbutz near Gaza since the Oct. 7 attack.\n\nIDF spokesman defends order to evacuate north Gaza, which was criticized by U.N.\n\nOne week after Hamas terror attacks killed over 1,300 people in Israel and sparked retaliatory strikes in Gaza that have killed more than 1,900, a spokesman for Israel’s military sought to defend orders telling Palestinians to leave Gaza City.\n\nGaza City and northern Gaza are “an area where we plan to enhance our military operations,” Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus of the Israel Defense Forces said in a video livestream Saturday morning local time.\n\nThe United Nations and World Health Organization have said that moving over 1 million people in densely populated Gaza is impossible and puts lives at risk. The health care system is already at a breaking point and unable to deal with a transfer of patients, they said.\n\nIsrael has also enacted a “siege” on Gaza, with no water, fuel or food, and demanded the release of hostages held by Hamas.\n\nConricus on Saturday morning did not announce a ground assault by Israel into Gaza, but he said that ground forces were deployed around Gaza.\n\nHe said the military has been targeting Hamas, which has many commanders and officers and other materials in Gaza City.\n\n“We want civilians not to be affected by the war. We didn’t put those civilians there. They are not our enemy. We are not trying to kill or injure any civilians. We are fighting against Hamas,” Conricus said.\n\nThe military arm of Hamas said that Israeli airstrikes had hit a column of evacuees from Gaza City on Friday. The Palestinian Health Ministry corroborated that claim, and NBC News crews met people in hospitals who lost family members from airstrikes while fleeing from the north.\n\n220 South Korean and other Asian nationals evacuate from Israel\n\nA South Korean military plane evacuating 220 South Korean and other Asian nationals from Israel has departed Tel Aviv and was expected to land in South Korea later Saturday, Seoul’s Foreign Ministry said.\n\nThe people transported on the KC-330 military transport plane included 163 South Koreans, 51 Japanese nationals and six Singaporean nationals, the ministry said.\n\nSouth Korea had also sent a civilian plane earlier this week to evacuate 192 South Korean nationals. About 470 South Koreans remain in Israel, most of them long-term residents who have chosen to stay.\n\nNo South Korean casualties have so far been reported from the violence in Israel and Gaza.\n\nOri Arad, music festival bartender, saved lives, brother said\n\nOri Arad, a bartender at the Supernova music festival in southern Israel, called his father at 7:10 a.m. and said, “Listen, there is an ambush of dozens of terrorists, they’re blocking the roads. They’re shooting on is with machine guns.”\n\n“I must do something ... I’ve decided to confront them,” his brother, Shay Arad told NBC News Now. The family found out three hours later that he was killed.\n\nBut on Israeli media, two girls were interviewed who said “an angel with curly hair” in a gray jeep found them on the road and saved them.\n\nThat was Ori, Arad said, and he drove his vehicle at attackers and to avoid ambushes, but was shot and the vehicle rolled over. Ori Arad lost consciousness and the two girls played head, Shay Arad said. Ori later regained consciousness and was found and shot dead, he said.\n\nThe name Ori means “my light” in Hebrew, and “Ori was a person that was full of light,” Shay Arad said.\n\n“The way he acted during this terrorism is exactly what we knew he will do,” he said. “I believe he lost his life following his ideals.”\n\nRead more about Hamas’ terror attack on an Israeli music festival.\n\nRepublicans splinter over Israel politics\n\nWASHINGTON — Republicans are divided over the U.S. response to terrorist attacks in Israel, both within the ranks of their own presidential primary and when it comes to President Joe Biden’s reaction.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis continues to hit former President Donald Trump, a rival for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, over derogatory comments Trump made Wednesday night about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and praise for Hezbollah, a Lebanon-based group designated by the U.S. as a terrorist organization, as “very smart.”\n\nDeSantis and several other Republican candidates have harshly criticized Trump, the front-runner for the GOP nomination and a longtime favorite of Israel hawks, since he made the remarks.\n\nThe Republican infighting, coupled with pockets of GOP approval for Biden’s handling of the aftermath of the terrorist attacks, suggest that the domestic political turf has shifted as a result of the unfolding situation in the Middle East. What remains to be seen is how big the change is and if it will last.\n\nIt’s also not clear yet whether Trump’s comments will hurt him at all in a Republican primary that he has dominated, particularly given the bonds he built with conservatives by moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, negotiating the Abraham Accords peace agreements and giving full-throated support to Israel during his term as president. But Trump and his campaign have been engaged in a public cleanup operation since Wednesday night.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nAn inside look at the impossible position Gaza's hospitals are in\n\nAn NBC News camera crew gained access to the hospital on the brink of collapse, finding young children with bloody limbs and corridors lined with anxious family members awaiting updates about their loved ones. One woman sat on the floor, crying with her face in her hands — her legs covered by bloodied bedsheets and her feet coated in debris.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\n‘We assume the plan is to bomb this, the city to dust,’ says U.S. translator in Gaza\n\n+2\n\n, and\n\nArabic-English translator Jason Shawa, his wife and two daughters fled their Gaza City home and are staying in a shelter after Israel’s military warned civilians to leave.\n\n“When you say safe, it’s very relative,” Shawa, 55, who was born in Seattle but has spent most of his life in Gaza, told NBC News in audio messages over WhatsApp.\n\nThey are in a shelter in the center of the Gaza Strip, where around 45 to 50 other people are also staying. They left after the Israeli military said people should go south for their own safety. They are using a small battery-powered system to charge phones and there are a few light bulbs lit, he said.\n\n“We assume the plan is to bomb this, the city to dust,” he said.\n\nThere are around 19 children in the shelter and not enough blankets or mattresses, Shawa said.\n\n“We gave priority to the children, we have them inside the structure,” he said. An elderly couple is also inside, and the rest of them are sleeping outside on the tiles, he said.\n\nPeople at the shelter don’t know what will happen next, Shawa said. Some think they’ll be told to move again and be pushed to the Sinai Desert in Egypt.\n\n“We have no idea, we just have no idea. Most of us believe that there will be nothing to get back to in a few days if we do actually live through it,” Shawa said.\n\nWHO pleads with Israel to reverse evacuation decision\n\nThe World Health Organization today said it was “appealing to Israel to immediately rescind orders” telling people in north Gaza to head to the south, which it said involved over 1 million people.\n\n“A mass evacuation would be disastrous — for patients, health workers and other civilians left behind or caught in the mass movement,” the WHO said in a statement posted to X. \"With ongoing airstrikes and closed borders, civilians have no safe place to go.\"\n\nAn Israeli military spokesman early Friday ET said it has warned people in Gaza City and in northern Gaza to leave to the south within 24 hours, for what it says is the safety of civilians as it strikes Hamas.\n\n“The Palestinian Ministry of Health has informed WHO that it is impossible to evacuate vulnerable hospital patients without endangering their lives,” the WHO said in a statement.\n\nWhat is Israel's plan for the tunnels that Hamas uses to move fighters and weapons?\n\nand\n\nIsrael’s air force is getting more U.S.-made bombs to help it destroy the labyrinth of tunnels used by Hamas militants in Gaza to conceal weapons, fighters and hostages. In the aftermath of Hamas’ surprise attack across Israel’s southern border, Israel has carried out a relentless bombardment of Gaza to try to take out Hamas’ weapons stockpiles and its vast tunnel system. But Israeli ground forces likely will be needed to clear out the tunnel network known as “Gaza’s Metro,” according to former U.S. officials and military officers.\n\n“Clearly, they want to put as many of these out of commission as possible,” said Matthew Levitt, a counterterrorism expert and former U.S. senior national security official.\n\nThe tunnels are a “critical” military objective for Israel as it seeks to degrade Hamas’ armed forces and dismantle the militants’ infrastructure, said Levitt, now with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a think tank.\n\nThe Biden administration said it is providing Israel with kits to convert unguided or “dumb bombs” into precision-guided munitions as well as small diameter bombs (SDBs) that experts say are effective weapons against underground targets. The weapons are supposed to enable Israel to target Hamas militants while minimizing harm to civilians, experts said, though humanitarian organizations have expressed concern over the plight of Gaza’s civilian population given the intensity of the Israeli air raids.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nCanadians in Gaza may be able to leave into Egypt this weekend, official says\n\nThere may be a chance for Canadians in Gaza and their families to head into Egypt tomorrow, a Canadian Global Affairs assistant deputy minister Julie Sunday said.\n\n“We learned this morning that there may be an opportunity for individuals to leave through the Rafah gate into Egypt tomorrow between 12 p.m. and 5 p.m.,” the official said at a news conference today (ET).\n\n“We are actively engaging with Egyptian and Israeli authorities to ensure that Canadians, permanent residents and their family members, will be able to leave,” she said.\n\nThere are 485 Canadians in the West Bank and Gaza registered with Global Affairs, which among other things provides consular assistance, she said.\n\nCanadian Armed Forces flights have also been getting Canadians out of Israel. Yesterday and today, CAF flights have transported 496 people from the airport in Tel Aviv, Sunday said. Two flights happened today and had either landed or were en route to Athens.\n\nThe government is aware of three Canadians who have been killed and four who are missing, she said. The situation in Gaza is \"very difficult\" and a lack of electricity is making communication difficult, she said.\n\nFamilies across Israel mourn loved ones, pray for missing\n\nJERUSALEM — On the Jewish holy day of Shabbat, families across Israel were mourning loved ones and praying for those who remain missing.\n\nAt one of Jerusalem’s holiest sites, the Western Wall, a mother of seven said that the “heart can’t contain this incredible sorrow.”\n\n“Every time I look at my own baby I cry,” she said.\n\nAt a dinner table in a Jerusalem home, the mother of a missing 19-year-old woman described the “living hell” her family was enduring.\n\n“I can’t help her,” said the mother, who believes her daughter was kidnapped Saturday morning from her safe room.\n\n“We can’t sleep, we can’t eat,” she said. “I have no air. I can’t breathe.”\n\nTrump falsely characterized Israel’s role in his administration’s assassination of Iran’s top general\n\nand\n\nWASHINGTON — Former President Donald Trump falsely characterized Israel’s role in his administration’s assassination of Iran’s top general during remarks this week, according to three U.S. officials familiar with the planning of the operation.\n\nTrump said Wednesday that Israel planned to be part of the January 2020 operation that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani but abruptly backed out the night before it was to take place. In his remarks, delivered before an audience at his Mar-a-Lago club in South Florida, Trump sharply criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for that decision after months of working with the U.S. on the operation.\n\nBut the U.S. officials familiar with the planning said Trump’s comments are entirely false. “They were never on board with it,” said a former senior White House official, referring to the Israelis. “They always thought it was a dangerous and destabilizing idea.”\n\nOne former Trump administration official familiar with the planning said that in Washington, when Trump made the decision to go ahead with the Soleimani strike, the generals who were present seemed to collectively take a deep breath.\n\nThe CIA declined to comment. The Trump campaign, the U.S. military’s Central Command and the Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.C., did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nU.S. has not asked Israel to delay ground operation\n\nThe U.S. has not urged Israel to delay its ground operation in Gaza until safe passage for Palestinians can be secured, a senior U.S. official told NBC News, denying a Fox News report.\n\nThe U.S. believes Israel is trying to minimize harm to civilians but, given that rocket attacks from Gaza have continued for a week, Israel has a need, a right and an obligation to respond with the operations they deem necessary, a senior state department official said tonight.\n\nSecretary Blinken said today that the U.S. was focused on creating safe zones in Gaza in coordination with international organizations and other countries, but acknowledged they were still working on the details.\n\n“We’re very actively engaged with U.N. relief agencies, with the ICRC, with others to address the acute humanitarian needs of people in Gaza — to protect them from harm and make sure that they have the ability to get what they need,” he said.\n\nThere are 500 to 600 Americans living in Gaza, and the U.S. is continuing discussions with Israel and Egypt to ensure safe passage for those who want to leave. That safe passage hinges on Egypt agreeing to keep the Rafah crossing open, the only path into Sinai from Gaza. U.S. discussions with Egypt have focused on American citizens and other foreign nationals, a senior state department official said today, but have not involved the same push for safety for Palestinians.\n\n\"Any American citizen that’s in Gaza or in Israel, we certainly want to hear from them and we will do everything we can to help them leave if they want to leave,” National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby said today. “Now, obviously, it’s different geography, different challenges, but that doesn’t mean that we aren’t still committed to that and to make it work. And that includes the West Bank.”\n\nAmong those civilians in Gaza are believed to be American hostages.\n\n“We are trying to secure the release of the hostages. Period. We recognize the brutality of the organization that has taken these hostages and are very clear-eyed about that, but we’re doing everything we can to secure their release, including asking other countries that have any leverage at all to bring that leverage to bear,” a senior state department official said today. “At the same time, we recognize that Israel has just very legitimate needs here.”\n\nFrom downtown Miami, a show of support for Gaza\n\nand\n\nMIAMI — Around 150 people assembled in downtown Miami today to protest Israel Defense Forces’ offensive in Gaza, chanting \"Free Palestine\" and waving Palestinian flags.\n\n\"We think Jewish lives are precious. We think Palestinian lives are precious,\" said Martha Schoolman, 53, from Coral Gables. “I’m horrified by the rush for revenge.”\n\nSchoolman held a flag identifying herself as a member of “Jewish Voice For Peace,” which calls itself the “largest progressive Jewish anti-Zionist organization in the world.”\n\nAcross the street, a small group of demonstrators protested Hamas. Some held signs comparing Hamas to the Nazi regime.\n\nMiami Police arrested one man when he stepped out of the Palestinian protest area and appeared to try and enter the pro-Israeli demonstration section.\n\n‘Even wars have rules,’ U.N. secretary-general says, calls for humanitarian access\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said that the conflict between Hamas and Israel “has reached a dangerous new low” and called for immediate humanitarian access into blockaded Gaza.\n\n\"Even wars have rules,” Guterres told reporters today. “International humanitarian law and human rights must be respected and upheld.”\n\nThe secretary-general said that “civilians must be protected, and also, never used as shields.” He also called for all hostages being held in Gaza to be released.\n\nGuterres today repeated U.N.’s position that Israel’s warning for 1.1 million people in northern Gaza to leave for the south is impossible.\n\n“Moving more than 1 million people across a densely populated war zone to a place with no food, water or accommodation, when the entire territory is under siege, is extremely dangerous and in some cases simply not possible,” he said.\n\nEerie calm as evacuation deadline for northern Gaza passes\n\nand\n\nASHDOD, Israel — There was an eerie calm as Israel’s deadline for 1 million Palestinians to evacuate a large and densely populated section of northern Gaza passed today.\n\nFrom just north of Gaza, it wasn’t clear if the calm signaled that Israeli forces had sufficiently softened Hamas targets within Gaza ahead of an anticipated ground offensive.\n\nDuring an unscheduled speech on television, Benjamin Netanyahu did not mention the offensive but sought to rally the country behind his efforts to “smash” Hamas.\n\nEarlier today, the Israeli military told reporters a covert special forces unit was in Gaza trying to find dozens of hostages who were taken by Hamas militants a week ago.\n\nThe military did not provide additional details about the mission but said the unit was involved in firefights with militants.\n\nIsrael’s military told the United Nations on yesterday afternoon Eastern Time that the entire population north of Wadi Gaza had to evacuate within 24 hours, a U.N. official said.\n\nState Dept. officials urged to stay away from 'de-escalation,' 'cease-fire' language\n\nA small group of State Department officials involved in public messaging around the Israel-Hamas were advised today against using the phrases “de-escalation/cease-fire,” “end to violence/bloodshed” and “restoring calm.” The brief email was written to ensure State Department messaging is consistent and in line with that of both Secretary Blinken and President Biden, a U.S. official directly familiar with the email told NBC News.\n\nThe official said the guidance was forwarded and circulated beyond its intended recipients to a much larger group within the State Department. The email was first reported on by the Huffington Post.\n\nA tweet from Blinken’s account was deleted the day after the Hamas attacks, and changed from saying he encouraged Turkey’s “advocacy for a cease-fire,” in a call with Foreign Minister Fidan to saying, “Israel has a right to defend itself, rescue any hostages, and protect its citizens.”\n\nState Department spokesperson Matt Miller defended the decision to alter the tweet in a briefing Monday.\n\n\"After his call with Foreign Minister Fidan, we released a public readout that made clear that the Secretary, in his conversation, had reiterated what we have said publicly a number of times, which is: Hamas should cease its violent activities against Israel,” Miller said. “The tweet was unfortunately worded, did not capture that appropriately, so we pulled it down.”\n\nVideo shows Hamas rocket launches and Israeli airstrikes in Gaza\n\n'Free Palestine' and pro-Israel protesters flood Times Square\n\nand\n\nHundreds of protesters assembled in New York City’s Times Square this afternoon. One side chanted \"Free Palestine\" and held signs calling for negotiations to prevent more civilian casualties in Gaza. Across the street, a smaller pro-Israel rally waved Israeli flags.\n\nHundreds of police officers and traffic separated the crowds as they marched down West 42nd Street. Buses and cars honked in support of both.\n\n“The U.S. government has done nothing but destruction to the Middle East,” one speaker at the pro-Palestinian rally said before the crowd loudly booed Biden.\n\nRana Atari, a 39-year-old New Jersey resident who has family in the Palestinian territory, called on the world to open its eyes and “end all this cruelty.”\n\nStanding amid a sea of signs telling the U.S. to end aid to Israel, Awad Ahmad, 30, of Queens, called for an end to the war and the killing of innocent civilians.\n\n“There are millions of Palestinians in Gaza who don’t have food, water or electricity, he said. “You can’t ignore that.”\n\n“Our people are suffering and their lives is very hard,” said Mohamed Zano, 45, of Staten Island, draped in a Palestinian flag. “Please stop the war.” War is not the solution. Israel needs to sit at the table and negotiate.\n\nOn the opposite side of the rally, some pro-Israel protesters decried the brutality.\n\n“They support Hamas and they should be ashamed of themselves. And they laugh in our face,\" said Idan Naor, 39, of Queens. \"They are proud that they kill Jews.”\n\nAnother Jewish supporter from Queens said he’d never be the same after the invasion.\n\n“I’m not the same person, my perception of life and society has changed,” said Al Dro, 48, although he wasn’t sure if it was for better or worse.\n\nTwo hours into the protests, the Palestinian supporters de-escalated the situation by marching up 42nd Street past Bryant Park.\n\nPalestinian doctor in Gaza describes the current situation amid Israeli airstikes\n\nand\n\nPalestinian plastic surgeon Mohamed Ziara described the situation in Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza amid airstrikes from Israel.\n\n\"I'm trying to deal with patients, we have maybe 10 times the capacity of the hospital, overloaded with patients,\" the 37-year-old said in a video sent to NBC News.\n\n“Patients are in the corridors, the streets, they are evacuating them because there is no other beds,” he said. “Any other casualties come to the hospital, they stay in the emergency department.”\n\n“We tried to live in Gaza, but there is no hope now,\" Ziara said.\n\nFlorida lawmaker urges DeSantis to expel college students, fire faculty who participate in pro-Hamas rallies\n\nand\n\nA Florida state representative urged Gov. Ron DeSantis in a letter today to use state laws to expel college students and fire faculty who espouse antisemitic views and participate in pro-Hamas rallies.\n\n“Since Saturday, there have been celebrations of Jewish death across Florida. In Fort Lauderdale and Tampa and Jacksonville. On our state University campuses in Boca and Tampa and Tallahassee and Gainesville and Miami,” Rep. Randy Fine, a Republican, said.\n\nThe letter added, “Any student organization that has attempted to ‘justify the killing of Jews’ which is chartered by any state college or university, must be expelled immediately, and any public funds be cut off.”\n\nFine also wrote: “Any faculty member who has propagated, excused, or encouraged this genocide must be fired. … There is no excuse for inaction, no equivocation.”\n\nBiden promises to do ‘everything possible’ to locate missing Americans\n\nFrance declares terrorist alert after teacher is fatally stabbed\n\nFrench Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne declared a terrorist alert and mobilized the country's security forces after a teacher was fatally stabbed and two other people were wounded in the northern city of Arras.\n\nThe 20-year-old suspect, who is a former student of the Lycee Gambetta high school, where the attack happened, has been arrested and had been on a state watch list of people posing a potential security risk, officials said.\n\n\"Based on our intelligence, there is a link unfortunately between what is happening in the Middle East,\" Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin said on on TF1 TV.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has condemned the attack as a “barbaric Islamic terrorism.\"\n\nNYC councilwoman arrested after showing up at pro-Palestinian rally with gun\n\nand\n\nA New York City councilwoman was arrested and charged today with criminal possession of a firearm after images on social media showed her at a pro-Palestinian rally in Brooklyn yesterday with a gun appearing to protrude from her waistband, police said.\n\nInna Vernikov, 39, represents the 48th District in Brooklyn, according to a council website. Vernikov, a Ukrainian-born lawyer and Republican who serves as the minority whip, is a leading voice against antisemitism, according to the council website.\n\nVernikov could not be immediately reached for comment. She had repeatedly denounced pro-Palestinian rallies on her X account.\n\n“It is unacceptable and unlawful for a civilian to ever bring a firearm to a rally or protest, and especially important for elected officials to model a respect for the law that is expected of all New Yorkers,\" New York City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams said in a statement.\n\nPhoto: Israel delivers presentation at the U.N. on Hamas kidnappings\n\nIsrael used white phosphorus weapons in Gaza, human rights watchdog says\n\nA human rights watchdog says that it's verified that Israel used white phosphorous weapons in Gaza, which can cause severe burns and are considered particularly dangerous for civilians due to their indiscriminate nature.\n\nYesterday, Human Rights Watch published a report saying that it verified the use of the munitions in Gaza and Lebanon through videos and interviews.\n\nAmnesty International's weapons investigator agreed with Human Rights Watch's assessment in an emailed statement and said that his team had verified that white phosphorus munitions were spotted on Israeli planes that were conducting air attacks.\n\nA spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces called the accusation \"unequivocally false.\"\n\nIn interviews with NBC News, a photographer said that he believed he witnessed and photographed an air attack using white phosphorus weapons. A surgeon told NBC News that she witnessed wounds that she said were consistent with white phosphorus injuries.\n\nWhite phosphorus is allowed by international law in certain uses, such as for creating light or a smoke screen. But airdropping white phosphorus weapons is prohibited by international law, according to human rights groups, though Israel is not a signatory to that law.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\n‘Rescue Gaza!’: Desperate plea as Palestinians struggle to find safety\n\nGaza City residents were ordered to evacuate ahead of the IDF's ground offensive and are fleeing with their belongings — many by car, others on foot and some by horse-drawn wagon.\n\n\"I don’t know where I can go now,\" Gaza resident Mazen Saidam said. \"Egypt or Jordan or Syria or Lebanon?

Tonight, they gather again, but one important person is missing from the dinner table: His younger brother, Omer.\n\nOmer Shemtov was one of the people taken hostage Saturday at the musical festival where at least 260 others were killed. As the attack unfolded, he was frightened as he called his father, saying he was going to try to come back home. The family was able to track his phone's location until it crossed the border into Gaza, his older brother said.\n\nAt first, Amit Shemtov said, he was in denial about what might have happened to his brother, thinking: \"I bet he's just hiding in some bushes just waiting to be rescued.\"\n\nWhen they didn't hear from the 20-year-old, however, they panicked.
