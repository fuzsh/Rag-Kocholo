        "text": "Drone attack on US base comes after weeks of officials working to contain the war in Gaza\n\nThe overnight drone strike on a US military base in Jordan — which killed the first US service members in the Middle East since the start of the war in Gaza — comes after weeks of efforts by officials to avoid a broader regional conflict.\n\nA key part of the US’ work in the Middle East is “not to have the conflict broaden,” Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. CQ Brown said in a pre-recorded interview that just aired on ABC News Sunday morning.\n\nBrown said the goal was deterrence of Iranian proxies operating in the region, like the Houthi rebels in Yemen and the powerful Hezbollah paramilitary group in Lebanon.\n\nAttacks before Sunday: There have been dozens of injuries since recent attacks on US and coalition forces in Iraq and Syria began — a senior military official told reporters last week there were roughly 70. The Pentagon had previously classified most of them as minor, aside from one US soldier who was critically injured in an attack in Iraq on Christmas Day.\n\nThe US has taken several retaliatory actions against the Iran-backed groups in Iraq and Syria, one as recently as last week when the US struck three facilities in Iraq used by Kataib Hezbollah and other Iran-affiliated groups.\n\nThe killing of three Americans also comes as the US and Iraq are expected to soon begin talks about the future of the US military presence in the country.\n\nUN Secretary-General says 9 UNRWA staff members fired over allegations\n\nOf the 12 staff members of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) allegedly involved in the deadly October 7 Hamas attack in Israel, nine have been fired, one killed and the identities of two others are “being clarified,” UN Secretary-General António Guterres said.\n\n“The United Nations is taking swift action following the extremely serious allegations against several UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) staff members,” Guterres said Sunday, adding the UN’s oversight body has already launched an investigation and an independent review is forthcoming.\n\nHe urged countries, however, to continue financial assistance to the UNRWA that supports 2 million Gazans who depend on the “critical aid” for “daily survival,” warning the agency’s current funding “will not allow it to meet all requirements to support them in February.”\n\nIn the wake of the allegations against the UNRWA, nine countries have so far paused funding for the main UN agency in Gaza.\n\n“The abhorrent alleged acts of these staff members must have consequences. But the tens of thousands of men and women who work for UNRWA, many in some of the most dangerous situations for humanitarian workers, should not be penalized. The dire needs of the desperate populations they serve must be met,” he said."
