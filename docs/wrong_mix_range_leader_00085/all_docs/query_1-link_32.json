        "text": "Palestinian Authority president asks countries that stopped their relief agency funding to reconsider\n\nThe president of the Palestinian Authority has asked countries that halted funding for the United Nations relief agency in Gaza to reconsider.\n\nTen Western countries have now suspended their funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) after allegations arose that some of its staff members were involved in Hamas’ October 7 terror attacks.\n\nAbbas accused Israel of acting out of animus for the UN agency, saying: “Officials in the Israeli government openly expressed that there would be no role for UNRWA, revealing the true motive behind this campaign.”\n\nFor context: Foreign Minister Israel Katz suggested Friday that the Israeli government will seek to stop the UN agency from operating in post-war Gaza.\n\nMore from Palestinian officials: The PA Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh also said Sunday he hopes the “extremely dangerous” decisions to suspend funding will be “reversed.”\n\nHe said the decision to suspend aid “comes at the most difficult time, at a time when the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has called for an immediate supply, and increased supplies of international aid into Gaza.”\n\nMore context: The ICJ, which is the UN’s top court, ruled last week that Israel must act immediately to prevent a genocide in the Palestinian enclave, including ensuring access to humanitarian aid. Aid workers in Gaza warn that a famine is looming, and that hospitals are in dire shape.\n\nThe US is still working to identify militia responsible for attack on its base in Jordan\n\nThe US government is still working to assess exactly which militia group was responsible for Sunday’s attack on soldiers at a base in Jordan, a US official told CNN.\n\nAt least three service members died and more than 30 were injured in the drone attack by Iranian proxies, the White House said earlier Sunday.\n\n3 US soldiers killed and many more hurt in drone attack on a base in Jordan. Here's what to know\n\nThree US soldiers have been killed and more than 30 service members injured after Iran-backed militants launched a drone strike on a small US outpost in Jordan, US officials say.\n\nThe drone landed near living quarters at the base, located near the Syrian border, according to two US officials. At least three service members were evacuated for medical treatment, the officials said, and the injury toll is expected to rise as more personnel seek treatment.\n\nHere’s what to know:\n\nFears of a wider war: The soldiers’ deaths are the first of US service members in the Middle East since the start of the war in Gaza, with US President Joe Biden vowing those responsible will be held accountable, “at a time and in a manner our choosing.”\n\nThe attack comes after weeks of the US focusing on deterrence in the region, where it has been trying to prevent the war from spilling into a broader regional conflict.\n\nThe site of the attack: The attack took place at Tower 22, a small base near the border with Syria. US forces at the outpost are there as part of an “advise and assist” mission with Jordan.\n\nIt’s unclear why air defenses failed to intercept the drone, which appears to be the first known attack on Tower 22 since attacks on US and coalition forces began October 17.\n\nMore from the White House: Biden was briefed on the deaths Sunday morning in South Carolina, where he is making a stop on the campaign trail.\n\nUS Vice President Kamala Harris also made a statement on the attack Sunday, saying she and her husband mourn the loss of the soldiers killed in a “despicable attack by Iran-backed militant groups.”\n\nUS lawmakers call for strikes: Sen. Roger Wicker, the top Republican on the US Senate’s Armed Services Committee, called on the Biden administration to strike “directly” against Iranian targets and its leaders. The House Armed Services chairman, GOP Rep. Mike Rogers, also called on Biden to hold Iran and its proxies “accountable.”\n\nRepublican Sen. Lindsey Graham attacked Biden over the news, saying his administration’s “policy of deterrence has failed miserably” and calling for strikes on targets inside Iran.\n\nPrevious attacks: There have been numerous attacks on US and coalition forces in Iraq and Syria recently, resulting in dozens of injuries — a senior military official told reporters last week there were roughly 70. The Pentagon had previously classified most of them as minor, aside from one US soldier who was critically injured in an attack in Iraq on Christmas Day."
