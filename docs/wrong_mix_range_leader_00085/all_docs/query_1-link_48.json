        "text": "Palestine is comprised of two geographically separated areas of land, the West Bank and Gaza Strip. It has never existed as a fully realized nation-state, as foreign powers have for centuries been the dominant sovereign authority. In 1948, though neighboring Arab countries rejected UN General Assembly Resolution 181, which created the Israeli state on 77 per cent of Palestinian land, Palestinians faced mass expulsion and ethnic cleansing (Nakba). Several Arab-Israeli wars since then resulted in millions of Palestinian refugees throughout the region. Today, a majority (60 per cent) of Palestinian areas remain under full Israeli control and are particularly subject to constant military presence, arrest and detention, frequent acts of violence, restrictions on movement, and the destruction of property.\n\nThe ongoing occupation affects every aspect of Palestinian life, and both Israeli and Palestinian leaders face condemnation for severe human rights violations. A long-halted peace process with Israel, internal discord between Palestinian factions and the current war between Hamas and Israel have undermined the development of democratic institutions and have prevented Palestine’s ability to exercise self-determination. The country hosts a highly aid-dependent, captive economy with high poverty and unemployment rates.\n\nThe quest for independent statehood and resolution of historical injustices absorb much of Palestinian politics, and acts of violence continue to take place in connection to it. Yet, the state on offer to Palestine has been in rapid decline following the conflict and the expansion of Israel’s colonial settlement project. Beyond such physical fragmentation, internal strife, prominently between the two most dominant Palestinian political factions - the secular organization Fatah in the West Bank and the Islamic movement Hamas in Gaza - has further deeply divided the country. Coordination around domestic and Israeli occupation related issues, in turn, have been marred by the increasingly authoritarian character of the Palestinian National Authority – the Palestinian domestic body with authority to exercise partial control.\n\nBefore the start of the Gaza war in October 2023, the most prominent issues included corruption, the indefinite postponement of presidential elections, an increasingly strong executive, and a vast security apparatusthat can effectively repress its critics. These factors led to political stagnation, which has characterized the country since the 1994 Oslo Peace Accords. However, the main issues have now shifted to reversing the profound impacts of destroyed infrastructure, food insecurity, and widespread disease caused by the war.\n\nDespite ratifying relevant international treaties, Palestine ranks low in gender equality due to entrenched patriarchal socio-cultural norms, exacerbated by Israeli occupation and Gaza’s war. Women’s participation in the labor market and in politics are low, with care work dominating their primary responsibilities. As the current war with Israel continues, men are unable to perform traditional roles.\n\nGoing forward, any democratic progress will depend on the cessation of the current war with Israel, which is ongoing since October 2023. In a post-conflict context, it will be important to watch developments related to the resumption of national elections, any openings related to sovereign statehood, and the design of mechanisms to govern such a state. Barring statehood, the shape of post-war reconstruction and the right of return of Palestinian refugees will determine the degree to which democratization can progress."
