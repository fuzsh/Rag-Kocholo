They discussed the relationship between Japan and Palestine as well as the Middle East Peace Process.\n\n2.Prime Minister Abe explained the position of Japan in contributing towards the peace in the Middle East through political dialogues with the parties concerned, promoting confidence-building between Israel and Palestine, and extending economic assistance to the Palestinians, which amounts to 1.5 billion US dollars in total since 1993. Prime Minister Abe also stated that Japan will provide additional assistance amounting to 100 million dollars, subject to the Diet approval, for Gaza reconstruction, economic and social development, finances, medical, health and other areas, which complete the pledge of 200 million dollars assistance made in March 2014. President Abbas expressed his appreciation for these assistances and extended his support towards Japan's active role in promoting peace and prosperity of the world under the banner of \"proactive contribution to peace\" based on the principle of the international corporation.\n\n3.Prime Minister Abe, extending his sympathy for suffering of the Palestinians, expressed his intention to continue Japanese support for sustainable economic and social development of Palestine through the \"Corridor for Peace and Prosperity\" initiative launched by Japan in cooperation with Palestine, Jordan and Israel.
