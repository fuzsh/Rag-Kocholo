        "text": "Attachments\n\nDownload Report (PDF | 92.29 KB)\n\nRAMALLAH, 6 April 2016 – The Government of Japan has donated USD $7 million in support of UNICEF’s humanitarian and development response to children in Palestine.\n\nThis new grant will enable UNICEF and partners to implement interventions which are critical for children’s well-being and protection from violence, and to ensure their access to basic services such as education, water and sanitation, protection or health and nutrition.\n\n“Given the severe circumstances facing the Palestinian children on a daily basis, the Government of Japan highly appreciates UNICEF’s interventions in various areas to protect children and improve their living conditions through providing necessary cares and increasing their access to the basic services. We feel a strong need to protect Palestinian children from violence and to improve their limited access to their basic rights and services” said Takeshi Okubo, Ambassador for Palestinian Affairs and Representative of Japan to the Palestinian Authority. “As Prime Minister of Japan Mr. Shinzo Abe announced on the occasion of the recent visit of President Mahmoud Abbas to Japan, Japan has committed to providing the new package of assistance to the Palestinians amounting to USD 78,210,200 mainly through the international organizations including UNICEF which is one of the important partners.”\n\nJapan’s financial support will provide opportunities to strengthen Palestinian children’s resilience and their coping mechanisms in an increasingly tense environment. It will support an integrated, multi-sector response with a focus on securing the social protection and inclusiveness.\n\n“The Government and the people of Japan have been most valued supporters of UNICEF’s mandate to improve the lives of the most vulnerable Palestinian children for years,” said June Kunugi, UNICEF State of Palestine Special Representative.\n\n“We are very deeply grateful for Japan’s enduring commitment and generous support which will not only provide humanitarian relief, but also encourage recovery and system building benefiting Palestinian children and their families,” Kunugi added.\n\nThe grant focuses on children from birth through adolescence, including by improving neonatal services for increased survival of newborns; helping children to access safe, drinking water and adequate sanitation services while increasing the capacity of national water information management systems; providing children in distress with psychosocial support and child protection services; improving the resilience of adolescents through social entrepreneurial skills programmes and stress-relief activities; and helping students who fell behind in their studies to catch up through remedial learning activities and the rehabilitation of schools.\n\nJapan has continued to support Palestinians since the 1993 Oslo Accord and provided UNICEF with nearly USD 70 million for its work with Palestinian children, including grants for emergency relief work during rounds of armed conflict. Japan is among UNICEF’s top five government donors.\n\nAbout UNICEF:\n\nUNICEF promotes the rights and wellbeing of every child, in everything we do. Together with our partners, we work in 190 countries and territories to translate that commitment into practical action, focusing special effort on reaching the most vulnerable and excluded children, to the benefit of all children, everywhere.
