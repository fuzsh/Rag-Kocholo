        "text": "Nabil Shaath, advisor to the Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas for external affairs and international relations, Sunday affirmed that Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono is collecting signatures of Japanese parliamentarians to demand the government to recognize Palestine.\n\nHe told Voice of Palestine that Japan will recognize Palestine gradually, and is expected to raise the level of Palestinian diplomatic representation in the country from delegation to a representative office.\n\nShaath said,\n\n“Japan supports the formation of a new international framework for managing the peace process, breaking free from US monopoly over it.”\n\nHe added that Japan is committed to political and financial support of Palestine and has renewed its commitment towards financing water projects in the Gaza Strip and increasing its financial contribution to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) to cover the deficit after the US has decided to slash funding for the humanitarian agency.\n\n(Wafa, PC, Social Media)\n\nThe Black Dress: Unveiling the Truth about Rape, Sexual Assault on October 7\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\nTo watch the video in YouTube, click here\n\nA recent New York Times made many claims about the ‘mass rape’ of Israeli women on October 7. But two leading Palestinian media organizations, The Palestine Chronicle and Friends of Palestine Network, conducted a joint investigation, the outcome of which resulted in the ‘The Black Dress’, a groundbreaking 18-minute documentary looking into allegations and the possible falsification of evidence.\n\n(The Palestine Chronicle is a registered 501(c)3 organization, thus, all donations are tax deductible.)"
