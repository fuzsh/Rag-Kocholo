        "text": "A long list of Arab leaders visited the Gaza Strip in the past week as it faced the fiercest fighting with Israel in four years.\n\nHowever, one name was notably absent - that of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.\n\nHe has not visited Gaza since his political rivals, Hamas, won legislative elections and then took over the territory by force five years ago.\n\nAs Hamas now celebrates what it sees as the victory of its militants over Israel and promises to ease movement restrictions in the Palestinian territory, Mr Abbas risks losing credibility.\n\nHe and his Fatah movement, which governs the West Bank, are now under greater pressure to proceed with a risky diplomatic course of action - asking the United Nations for an upgrade to the Palestinians' status.\n\nAt Birzeit University in the West Bank, political science students are discussing the implications. Many believe the president was sidelined in recent days.\n\n\"This war proved the weakness of Mahmoud Abbas. He wasn't involved in anything that happened,\" says Abdulmajid Darawish.\n\n\"The one making decisions was [the head of Hamas], Khaled Meshaal. This was the second war in Gaza in which the Palestinian Authority and Fatah weren't involved.\"\n\n\"We were all expecting that he would go to Gaza,\" adds Maisa Salem. \"He has to support the people and show that he's the president of all the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.\"\n\nTalks with Israel stalled two years ago over the issue of Jewish settlements on occupied land that the Palestinians claim as part of a future state.\n\nAt this year's United Nations General Assembly, Mr Abbas announced his new plan. He has asked for a vote, as soon as 29 November, to admit the Palestinians as a non-member observer state.\n\nIt is expected that he will get the two-thirds majority that he needs to achieve this.\n\nThe Palestinians hope they will then be given access to international courts where they can challenge Israeli actions.\n\nPresidential adviser Sabri Saidam believes this is the only way forward for Mr Abbas. \"He came out of the Gaza war definitely more adamant to go to the United Nations,\" he says.\n\n\"He knows quite well that some countries will oppose the vote but it's a Palestinian move in the right direction, taking this conflict from being the Palestinians versus the Israelis to the international community versus the Israelis.\""
