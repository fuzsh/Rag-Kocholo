        "text": "I am HOSHI Mitsutaka, Chief Representative of JICA Palestine Office. It is my pleasure that you reached our page.\n\nJapan and Palestine have enjoyed and developed a unique and strong relation. In 2006, then Prime Minister Mr. Koizumi announced the \"Corridor for Peace and Prosperity\", a mid to long-term initiative with the aim of promoting socio-economic development in the Jordan Valley and promoting an economic independence of Palestine. Since then, Japan has provided various supports for stability of people's lives, building administrative capacity and promoting sustainable economic growth.\n\nFollowing the visits of President Mahmoud Abbas to Japan in February 2016, and the former Japanese Prime Minister Mr. Abe to Palestine in May 2018, this bilateral relation has witnessed great achievements in the fields of education, health, tourism, industrial development, local governance, water, and improvement of Palestinian refugee camps."
