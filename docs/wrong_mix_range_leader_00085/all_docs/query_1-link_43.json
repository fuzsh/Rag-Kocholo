        "text": "Editor’s Note: CNN reported from Gaza under Israel Defense Forces’ escort at all times. As a condition for journalists to join the embed with the IDF, media outlets must submit footage filmed in Gaza to the Israeli military for security review. CNN did not submit its final report to the IDF and retained editorial control.\n\nOn the streets of Khan Younis in southern Gaza, the scars of war are clear to see.\n\nThe city’s heavily damaged buildings bear testament to some of the fiercest fighting that has taken place in the nearly 100 days since the devastating Hamas attacks on October 7 that killed more than 1,200 people and sparked Israel’s war in Gaza. In the more than three months since, at least 23,357 people in Gaza have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. CNN cannot independently confirm those numbers due to the difficulty of access to Gaza for international media.\n\nBut the carnage above ground tells only half the story of the Israel Defense Forces’ effort to drive out Hamas from a city it has described as a “main stronghold” of the militant group.\n\nIt is below ground, in the massive Hamas tunnel networks that the IDF says stretch for miles in all directions that its soldiers face a task with no obvious parallel in modern military history.\n\nDan Goldfus, IDF Division Commander, told CNN’s International Diplomatic Editor Nic Robertson he believes some of the more than 200 people taken hostage by Hamas on October 7 were held in tunnels under the heart of Khan Younis, including some of the 106 who are still believed to be in Gaza.\n\nWATCH THE REPORT:\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\n4e4b4874-ba68-48ba-8248-d4e19a2ceca1.mp4\n\n05:12 - Source: cnn\n\nSome of the tunnels are 60 meters deep (nearly 200 feet), according to Goldfus. Some are wide and some narrow. Penetrating them is a notoriously dangerous task.\n\nGoldfus says the biggest issue facing his troops is the “multi-dimensional” nature of the fighting “on all fronts.”\n\nHe led a CNN team on a tour that illustrated the complexity of the task.\n\nThe tour took the team down a metal ladder and two flights of stairs, wiring visible all the way, to about 15 meters (50 feet) under the ground.\n\nThe CNN team descended over 20 meters (65 feet), taking steps into a complex network. Yet asked how deep this tunnel went, Goldfus replied, “This is not a very deep tunnel.”\n\nSome, he said, are nearly three times as deep.\n\nBranching off from the side of the tunnel CNN entered, the ceiling was so low it was impossible to stand up straight. And at the end was a small room with a metal frame around the door.\n\nIt is in small rooms like this where some of the hostages kidnapped by Hamas have been kept, Goldfus claims.\n\nIt is a grim, unforgiving place for anyone, whether hostage or soldier, but Goldfus says the IDF will continue its fight until Hamas is eliminated.\n\nThis week, the IDF claimed to have completed the dismantling of Hamas’ command structure in northern Gaza and said it was switching its focus to southern and central Gaza.\n\nGoldfus knows his job is far from over.\n\n“If we give in to the Hamas, we give in to this area, you have to understand that, and I think no sovereign state would agree to such a thing,” he says.\n\nHe believes the IDF’s objectives are clear:\n\nA Houthi senior leader described a UN Security Council resolution condemning the group’s attacks on vessels in the Red Sea as a “political game” and called on Israel to stop all attacks in Gaza.\n\nIn a message on X, formerly known as Twitter, Mohamed Ali al-Houthi, member of the Supreme Political Council and former head of Yemen’s Houthi Supreme Revolutionary Committee, called on the UN Security Council to release the people in Gaza from what he called “the largest prison in which collective criminal punishment is practiced.”\n\nHe argued that what “the Yemeni armed forces are doing comes within the framework of legitimate defense” and that the United States, Britain, and Israel are the ones violating international law in their response to Gaza.\n\nSome background: Before the UN Security Council resolution was approved, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned “there will be consequences” for the continued Houthi attacks in the Red Sea.\n\n“I’m not going to telegraph or preview anything that might happen,” Blinken said in a press gaggle in Bahrain. “We’ve made clear, we’ve been clear with more than 20 other countries that if it continues, as it did yesterday, there will be consequences.”\n\nBlinken’s warning comes as the Iranian-backed militant group shows no signs of de-escalation and the potential for regional flare-up looms large.\n\nOn Tuesday, the US Navy shot down 21 Houthi missiles and drones launched from Yemen, according to a statement from US Central Command, in one of the largest Houthi attacks to take place in the Red Sea in recent months.\n\nAlthough many around the world rang in the new year earlier this month, “2024 is not a happy new year,” World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Wednesday.\n\nThis Sunday will mark 100 days since the Israel-Hamas conflict, Tedros noted, adding that “the situation is indescribable.”\n\nDisruptions to the health care and water sanitation systems, the lack of food and water as well as having people displaced in the winter is “a cocktail for diseases,” said Dr. Richard Peeperkorn, the WHO’s representative in the occupied Palestinian territories.\n\nWHO Health Officer Dr. Teresa Zakaria, the incident manager for the escalation of violence in Israel and the occupied Palestine territories, said the agency’s surveillance systems are capturing the manifestation of diseases, but they aren’t able to verify the bacteria, parasite or virus causing the illnesses.\n\nThe agency canceled six planned missions to northern Gaza since December 26 “because our requests were rejected and assurances of safe passage were not provided,” the director-general said.\n\nA mission scheduled today to a hospital instrumental for maternal and child health was canceled as well, according to Peeperkorn.\n\nCNN has contacted the Israel Defense Forces and COGAT, the government entity responsible for implementing policy in the Palestinian territories, for comment.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Wednesday that “there will be consequences” for the continued Houthi attacks in the Red Sea.\n\nBlinken’s warning comes as the Yemen-based Iranian-backed militant group shows no signs of de-escalation and the potential for regional flare-up looms large.\n\nOn Tuesday, the US Navy shot down 21 Houthi missiles and drones launched from Yemen, according to a statement from US Central Command, in one of the largest Houthi attacks to take place in the Red Sea in recent months.\n\nThe Houthis say they will only relent when Israel allows the entry of food and medicine into Gaza; its strikes could be intended to inflict economic pain on Israel’s allies in the hope they will pressure it to cease its bombardment of the enclave.\n\nHere are more headlines you should know:\n\nUNSC vote on Houthis: The UN Security Council approved a resolution on Wednesday calling on Yemen’s Houthi rebels to “cease its brazen” attacks in the Red Sea and violation of international law. The vote was 11 in favor, 0 against, and four abstentions, including from Russia and China.\n\nOfficial visits: Blinken discussed “ongoing efforts to minimize civilian harm” and increase the delivery of humanitarian assistance in Gaza during a meeting with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, the US State Department said. He also urged Israel to pass on a tax revenue it takes from Palestinian imports to the Authority.\n\nDevelopments on the ground: Hamas is no longer in control in large parts of the Gaza Strip, Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz said. He also reiterated the importance of the return of all hostages abducted in the October 7 attack, saying this is the priority in every combat decision. Blinken said he believes Hamas “can and will engage” in hostage talks even after an Israeli strike killed a senior Hamas official in Beirut last week.\n\nHumanitarian crisis: The food situation in northern Gaza is “absolutely horrific,” according to the World Health Organization. A British surgeon in central Gaza who was treating patients in the Al-Maghazi refugee camp recounted the daily horror of working at the hospital: Scores of displaced civilians covering every inch of the medical facility, hundreds of wounded people – mainly children – arriving every day with traumatic burns, missing limbs and shrapnel injuries to the chest and abdomen. A United Nations envoy on sexual violence will travel to Israel and the West Bank to gather information on reports of sexual assaults committed during the attacks on October 7 and its aftermath.\n\nNick Maynard still remembers treating the little boy from the Al-Maghazi refugee camp.\n\nThe British surgeon found the 6-year-old on the floor of the emergency ward of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in central Gaza.\n\nMaynard has recounted the daily horror of working at the hospital: Scores of displaced civilians covering every inch of the medical facility, hundreds of wounded people – mainly children – arriving every day with traumatic burns, missing limbs and shrapnel injuries to the chest and abdomen.\n\nLeading a five-member emergency team of clinicians, he worked with Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP) and the International Rescue Committee (IRC) from December 26 to January 5.\n\nMaynard, who has been coming to Gaza for 14 years, told CNN the overcrowding in and around the hospital in Deir al-Balah, one of the last remaining functioning hospitals in the enclave, was like “something I’ve never, ever seen before.”\n\n“When you’re dealing with acutely ill patients like that, you have to have a really comprehensive triage system where you can prioritize, and that system collapsed completely,” he said on Tuesday, speaking from the Egyptian capital Cairo.\n\nThe ratio of doctors to patients spiraled, as medical workers who were volunteering at the hospital increasingly fled south after the Israeli military issued evacuation orders.\n\nIn Al-Aqsa hospital, many of the patients were refugees from local camps including Al-Maghazi, Al-Bureij and Nuseirat, in what Maynard called “the clearest evidence you could ever want that there was an indiscriminate slaughter of people.”\n\nThe office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the military “does its utmost to avoid civilian casualties including providing early warning before attack, safe passage corridors and designated safer zones.”\n\n“Hamas targets Israeli civilians and embeds itself in Palestinian civilian neighborhoods, using Palestinian civilians and Israeli hostages as human shields,” the office added.\n\nIsraeli attacks on Gaza have killed at least 23,210 Palestinians since October 7, and injured another 59,167, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health — more than 1% of the enclave’s total pre-war population of 2.27 million people.\n\nIsraeli forces are “deliberately blocking the delivery of water, food, and fuel,” and “depriving the civilian population of objects indispensable to their survival,” Human Rights Watch has warned. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported the enclave’s healthcare sector is crumbling at a “rapid pace.”\n\nMaynard said most patients arrived at Al-Aqsa with “dirty wounds” after bomb blasts had pelted fallen glass, gravel, dust and dirt into their injuries. Rampant shortages of painkillers, drinkable water, and medical equipment including gloves, and skin staple removers meant “the wound infection rate was stratospheric.”\n\nSome patients suffered blast injuries where shrapnel passed through multiple parts of the body, damaging the liver, the spleen, the stomach and bowel, while others sustained internal bleeding in the lungs. Worst of all, Maynard said, was the sheer number of Palestinians, mainly children, arriving with traumatic burns and amputations.\n\nMore than 10 children on average have lost one or both of their legs every day in Gaza since October 7, Save the Children said on Sunday.\n\nHe still thinks of the little boy he found on the floor at the hospital. The kid was just one of many orphaned by the war and coming in with no family, “screaming for their parents” who had been killed.“He was alive when we left, but I don’t know whether he survived,” Maynard said.\n\nThe post was updated with more details from the interview with Maynard.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he believes that Hamas “can and will engage” on hostage talks even after an Israeli strike killed a senior Hamas official in Beirut last week.\n\n“We succeeded before in the midst of this conflict in getting more than a hundred hostages out, and it’s my belief that they can and will engage on this, and that’s something we’re intensely focused on with Qatar and with Egypt,” Blinken said in an interview with NBC News’ Andrea Mitchell on Tuesday, which aired Wednesday.\n\nOn Sunday, Qatari Prime Minister and Minster of Foreign Affairs Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said that the assassination of Saleh al-Arouri “is something that can affect such a complicated process.”\n\n“We are not giving up; we are moving forward. We are continuing our discussions with the parties and trying to achieve as soon as possible an agreement that can bring assistance for humanitarian relief and the release of the hostages,” Al Thani said at a press conference alongside Blinken in Doha.\n\nBlinken told NBC News that he again met with hostage families on his trip, saying that “for them, these three months have been an eternity; every day, every hour, every minute feels like an eternity.”\n\nYemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels are stepping up their strikes on ships in the Red Sea, which they say are revenge against Israel for its military campaign in Gaza.\n\nThe strikes have forced some of the world’s biggest shipping and oil companies to suspend their travel through the sea and has prompted the US and UK to supply warships to the region in an attempt to deter further attacks.\n\nWhile — through a combination of geography and technology — the Houthis may lack the capabilities of Hamas and Hezbollah, their strikes on commercial vessels in the Red Sea may inflict a different sort of pain on Israel and its allies.\n\nThe global economy has been served a series of painful reminders of the importance of this narrow stretch of sea, which runs from the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait off the coast of Yemen to the Suez Canal in northern Egypt – and through which 12% of global trade flows, including 30% of global container traffic.\n\nIn 2021, a ship called the Ever Given ran aground in the Suez Canal, blocking the vital trade artery for nearly a week – holding up as much as $10 billion in cargo each day – and causing disruptions to global supply chains that lasted far longer.\n\nThere are fears that the Houthi drone and missile attacks against commercial vessels, which have occurred almost daily since December 9, could cause an even greater shock to the world economy.\n\nThe Houthis say they will only relent when Israel allows the entry of food and medicine into Gaza; its strikes could be intended to inflict economic pain on Israel’s allies in the hope they will pressure it to cease its bombardment of the enclave.\n\nFueling international tensions\n\nChampioning the Palestinian cause could also be an attempt to gain legitimacy at home and in the region as they seek to control northern Yemen, which they have dominated since the start of a bloody civil war almost a decade ago.\n\nIt could also give them an upper hand against their Arab adversaries, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, who they accuse of being lackeys of the US and Israel.\n\nBut, there is also concern that the attacks could draw more countries into the conflict.\n\nIn December, the US announced a multinational naval task force comprising the United Kingdom, Bahrain, Canada, France, Norway and others, to “tackle the challenge posed by this non-state actor” that “threatens the free flow of commerce, endangers innocent mariners, and violates international law.”\n\nRead the full story.\n\nAttacks by Iran-backed militants in the Red Sea have effectively closed one of the world’s main trade routes to most container ships — vessels that carry everything from car parts to Crocs from one corner of the globe to another.\n\nA prolonged closure of the waterway, which connects with the Suez Canal, could snarl global supply chains and drive up the prices of manufactured goods at a crucial moment in the battle to defeat inflation. The Suez Canal accounts for 10-15% of world trade, which includes oil exports, and for 30% of global container shipping volumes.\n\nHouthi militants, based in Yemen, say they are taking revenge for Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza. The US military and its allies have beefed up maritime security but the attacks continue, with 21 Houthi missiles and drones shot down late Tuesday.\n\nAs the crisis persists, the stakes for the global economy are rising. Retailers are already warning of delays, and the cost of shipping goods is increasing.\n\nSix of the 10 biggest container shipping companies — namely Maersk, MSC, Hapag-Lloyd, CMA CGM, ZIM and ONE — are largely or completely avoiding the Red Sea because of the threat from the Houthi militants.\n\nThe danger to crew, cargo and vessels has forced carriers to reroute ships around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, resulting in delays of up to three weeks.\n\nThis has already significantly increased shipping costs, which could ultimately show up in consumer prices.\n\nIf the Israel-Hamas war escalates into a wider regional conflict or the Houthis decide to redirect their attacks toward oil tankers and bulk carriers — which transport crucial raw materials such as iron ore, grain and timber — the consequences for the global economy would be altogether more severe.\n\nRead more about how shipping costs could be affected.\n\nA Canadian surgeon who recently returned from Gaza painted a grim picture of the situation on the ground.\n\n“We have a major lack of equipment, of the medical supplies, you know, CT scan machine, and things like that, let alone the lack of drugs (such as) … analgesia, antibiotics,” Anas Al-Kassem told CNN, adding that he had to perform stitches on patients without anesthetics so he could conserve it for major surgeries.\n\nHis comments come as the UN said that Israeli authorities denied a planned mission by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and the World Health Organization to deliver critical supplies into northern Gaza on January 8. It was Israel’s fifth denial of a mission to a drug store and hospital since December 26, OCHA said, leaving five hospitals in northern Gaza without access to medical supplies.\n\nThe death toll in Gaza has risen to 23,210, with nearly 60,000 people also injured since October 7, 2023, according to the Hamas-controlled health ministry.\n\nCNN is unable to independently confirm the figures provided by the Gaza health ministry, due to restricted access to the region and the difficulty in verifying accurate numbers amid the ongoing conflict.\n\nHere are the latest headlines:\n\nBlinken meets PA president: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken discussed “ongoing efforts to minimize civilian harm” and increase the delivery of humanitarian assistance in Gaza during a meeting with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, the US State Department said. He also urged Israel to pass on a tax they take from Palestinian imports to the PA, in accordance with their agreement. Abbas also called for the immediate end to hostilities and rejected any attempt to relocate Palestinians from Gaza in the meeting in Ramallah, according to a readout of the meeting reported by the official Palestinian news agency WAFA.\n\nIsrael rejects Slovenia claim: Israel has pushed back at a Slovenian claim that its forces in Gaza had committed “violations of international humanitarian law,” with the prime minister’s office saying “all civilian casualties” were Hamas’s fault.\n\nBlinken in Bahrain: The US Secretary of State is making a surprise visit to the country as a part of his Middle East trip to try to ease regional tensions.\n\nUK warship in Red Sea: The United Kingdom deployed the HMS Diamond guided missile destroyer to support United States warships shooting down more than a dozen Houthi missiles and drones over the Red Sea. The Iran-backed Houthis have said their barrage of drones and missiles are showing solidarity with the Palestinian people.\n\nTargets struck: The IDF says it shot down more than 150 “terror targets” across Gaza over the past day. The military said “dozens of terrorist operatives” were killed by Israeli forces in the southern city of Khan Younis.\n\n“Fauda” star injured: A top Israeli actor, best known for his role as a special forces soldier in hit Netflix series “Fauda,” was badly wounded in Gaza while fighting for Israel’s military against Hamas, according to his family and the hospital where he is being treated.\n\nSharp increase in US antisemitic incidents: Antisemitism has “skyrocketed” across the United States since the October 7 Hamas attacks on Israel, according to new data released Wednesday by the Anti-Defamation League. The ADL has tracked a total of 3,283 antisemitic incidents between October 7 and January 7, the group said.

He said that the conflict needs to end in order for an internationally legitimate political solution, including the creation of a Palestinian state, to be implemented, according to the statement.\n\nBlinken, in meetings with Israeli government leaders Tuesday, had said the Israeli government must move toward a two-state solution if it wants the help of Arab partners in the region with lasting security. He also stressed that Palestinians must be allowed to return to their homes in Gaza “as soon as conditions allow” and must not be displaced from the enclave,\n\nA 5-year-old girl was killed after a Médecins San Frontières (MSF) shelter in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis was hit by a “suspected tank shell,” MSF said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nMSF says that they cannot confirm the origin of the shell, however “it appears to be similar to those used by Israeli tanks.”\n\nThe child, who is a family member of MSF staff, underwent surgery after she was critically injured by the shell and died of her wounds the following day, MSF said.\n\nThree others received minor injuries after the shell broke through the walls of the shelter, which is housing more than a hundred MSF staff and their families, according to MSF.\n\nMSF said they did not receive evacuation orders to leave the shelter, despite informing the Israeli army of their location.\n\n“Prior to the incident, MSF notified Israeli forces that the shelter near Gaza European Hospital was housing MSF staff and their families,” the statement said.\n\nMSF has contacted Israeli authorities for further explanation, the group said.\n\nWhen asked about the incident, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told CNN on Tuesday that it is “operating to dismantle Hamas military and administrative capabilities,” and that the IDF “follows international law and takes feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm.”\n\nFour members of MSF’s staff have been killed since the beginning of the war in addition to multiple family members, MSF said.\n\nAt least 23,210 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, including more than 10,000 children, since October 7, the Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza said on Tuesday.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken discussed “ongoing efforts to minimize civilian harm” and increase the delivery of humanitarian assistance in Gaza during a meeting with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, the US State Department said.\n\nBlinken met with Abbas in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday during a week-long trip to the Middle East, aimed at easing regional tensions.\n\nAccording to a statement from State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller, the United Nations has appointed Sigrid Kaag as senior humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for Gaza as a part of those efforts to reduce civilian harm.\n\nRising death toll: Israeli attacks on Gaza have killed at least 23,210 Palestinians since October 7 and injured another 59,167, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health — more than 1% of the enclave’s total pre-war population of 2.27 million people.\n\nIn December, US intelligence revealed nearly half of the air-to-ground munitions that Israel has used in Gaza have been unguided, as US President Joe Biden said support for Israel’s military campaign would erode due to “indiscriminate bombing.”\n\nIt has prompted warnings from global leaders for Israel to shift its military strategy and limit civilian casualties.\n\nCNN is unable to independently confirm the figures provided by the Gaza health ministry, due to restricted access to the region and the difficulty in verifying accurate numbers amid the ongoing conflict.\n\nTax revenue: Blinken also discussed issues relating to Israel withholding tax revenue from the Palestinian Authority since the October 7 Hamas attacks.\n\nUnder existing agreements, Israel collects tax revenue on behalf of the Palestinian Authority on Palestinian imports and exports. Since October 7, the Israeli government has refused to disperse the full amount of taxes collected, which are primarily used by the Palestinian Authority to pay public employees and retirees.\n\nHe also discussed US efforts to address extremist violence in the occupied West Bank.\n\n“The United States supports tangible steps towards the creation of a Palestinian state alongside the State of Israel, with both living in peace and security,” the statement concluded.\n\n“You have to decide who you’re going to be saving and who has to be left behind.”\n\nThese are the words of a Canadian surgeon who’s just returned from Gaza, having spent two weeks working in Khan Younis in the southern part of the enclave.\n\nAnas Al-Kassem has detailed the impossible decisions that the last few remaining doctors are having to make, as staff, equipment and supplies run dangerously low amid Israel’s offensive.\n\nAl-Kassem told CNN Wednesday that the state of Gaza’s heath system was “worse than what I expected.”\n\n“I think it is worse than what I expected to be honest with you,” he told CNN’s John Vause, adding that Israeli bombardment in Gaza had been more intense than what he had experienced working in Aleppo during the civil war in Syria.\n\nA lack of adequate medical supplies has impacted remaining healthcare facilities in the territory, he said.\n\n“We have a major lack of equipment, of the medical supplies, you know, CT scan machine, and things like that, let alone the lack of drugs [such as] … analgesia, antibiotics,” he said, adding that he had to perform stitches on patients without anesthetic so he could conserve it for major surgeries.\n\nOn the ground: Israel’s siege and severe restrictions on food, fuel and water entering Gaza has crushed the health care system, forcing medical workers to grapple with severely wounded patients in an environment stripped of essential supplies and infrastructure.\n\nOnly 13 out of 36 hospitals in Gaza are partially functioning, and bed occupancy is at 351%, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah.\n\nIn Deir al-Balah, Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital reported receiving dozens of casualties from several parts of central Gaza, from heavy air strikes that pounded the area.

And in some of his most direct comments on the matter, Blinken said Netanyahu must rein in the far-right tendencies of his government to achieve any progress in the future.\n\nHere’s what else to know:\n\nOn the ground: Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital reported receiving dozens of casualties from several parts of central Gaza due to heavy overnight airstrikes.

The World Health Organization stressed that it “cannot afford” to lose the remaining operational hospitals in southern Gaza. The Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health in Gaza said Tuesday that in the previous 24 hours, a total of 126 people had been killed and 241 injured.\n\nHostages latest: Israel’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz told Blinken his nation’s military needs to “finish the war” with Hamas to secure the return of Israeli hostages and achieve the “security of our people.” But Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas’ political leader, reiterated the group’s stance that it will only release Israeli hostages after all Palestinian prisoners are freed from Israel’s prisons.\n\nRegional diplomacy: King Abdullah II of Jordan will hold a three-way summit on Wednesday with Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to discuss efforts to coordinate a ceasefire in Gaza. Blinken — who met with Netanyahu after meetings with leaders in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Jordan — said Israel must move toward a two-state solution if it wants the help of Arab partners in the region with lasting security.\n\nRed Sea attacks: The US Navy shot down 21 Houthi missiles and drones launched from Yemen, according to a statement from US Central Command, in one of the largest Houthi attacks to take place in the Red Sea in recent months.

Hezbollah confirmed his death but denied Burji was in charge of its air force or drone program. During meetings with top officials, Blinken said the US and Israel believe “a diplomatic path is the best way to achieve” security on Israel’s northern border. Tensions have ramped up after Israel killed a senior commander in southern Lebanon on Monday. Last week, a senior Hamas official was killed in Beirut in a strike that Israel has not claimed.\n\nGenocide allegations: Israel is set to appear before the International Court of Justice this week in a high stakes case that could determine the course of the brutal war in Gaza. South Africa brought the case against Israel, accusing it of being in breach of its obligations under the UN’s Genocide Convention in its war on Hamas. Israel has rejected the accusation.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken made clear to the Israeli government that Palestinians must be allowed to return to their homes in Gaza “as soon as conditions allow” and must not be displaced from the strip, the top US diplomat said Tuesday.\n\nBlinken announced that the Israeli government had agreed to a plan to allow a United Nations assessment mission to northern Gaza as the Israeli offensive there shifts to a new phase.\n\nIn a day of talks with top Israeli officials, Blinken said he reaffirmed US support for Israel “ensuring that October 7 can never happen again,” while also calling on the government to do more to mitigate civilian casualties. He also discussed the efforts to secure the release of hostages who remain held by Hamas.\n\nBlinken has made five visits to Israel since the October 7 Hamas attacks as the Biden administration sought to keep pressure on the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nIndeed, the stakes of the secretary’s latest visit couldn’t be higher as concerns mount over the war spilling out into the wider region and the humanitarian toll continues to grow. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the Israeli offensive, millions have been displaced, and the entire population in the war-torn strip faces the risk of famine, the UN has warned. US officials have publicly acknowledged that gaps remain between Israel’s “intentions” and “results” when it comes to the staggering toll on civilians.\n\nRead more about Blinken’s visit to Israel:"
