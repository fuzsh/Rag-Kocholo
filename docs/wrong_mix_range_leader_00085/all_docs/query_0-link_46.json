        "text": "A senior figure in the Palestinian Fatah movement has denied plotting an internal coup to remove President Mahmoud Abbas.\n\nMohammed Dahlan has been suspended from Fatah's central committee pending an investigation into the allegations, which he describes as \"fantastical\".\n\nThere are increasing divisions in the movement, which runs the Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank.\n\nMr Dahlan was Fatah's security chief in Gaza before Hamas took over in 2007.\n\nAlthough President Mahmoud Abbas enjoys strong backing from the international community, the 75-year-old's presidential term formally ended more than a year ago and he has been effectively governing by decree ever since.\n\nWith peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians indefinitely suspended, there is growing criticism in Palestinian circles of what some describe as Mr Abbas' weak leadership.\n\nAmong his critics is Mr Dahlan, a 49-year-old who is originally from Gaza.\n\nMr Dahlan has emphatically denied plotting a coup and expressed his full support for Mahmoud Abbas in a BBC interview.\n\n\"Abbas is the president of the Palestinian people and when he summons me, I will go to him. But this is an exaggerated story that is not good for Fatah or the Palestinian people,\" he said.\n\n\"There are those who want to stab Fatah in the back, but I won't give them the reason or means to do so. I am dedicated to the movement and I will not turn my back on it.\""
