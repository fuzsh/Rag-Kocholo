Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Tuesday that Japan will actively contribute to helping realize peace in the Middle East, and that it has no intention of moving its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

During their talks at Abbas' office in Ramallah, Abe also conveyed Tokyo's plan to provide food aid worth $10 million, Japanese officials said.

Abbas, for his part, thanked Japan for its assistance and expressed hope for whatever role Tokyo may play in helping to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
