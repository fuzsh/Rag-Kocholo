GRANDS MOTETS – RAMEAU

Choir & Orchestra Marguerite Louise

Gaétan Jarry, direction

Quam dilecta tabernacula

In convertendo Dominus

Laboravi clamans

Deus noster refugium

Although celebrated for opera and harpsichord in his fifties, Rameau had formerly been first and foremost a master of sacred music. These works, composed between 1712 and 1721 when he was in his thirties, are marvels of balance, fully bearing the seeds of the splendour that Rameau would later display on the Parisian opera scene. In the French tradition of Lully and Lalande, which places the sacred text at the heart of a sumptuous musical performance, this complete set of Rameau’s Motets is performed with jubilation and grace by the soloists, the choir and the Marguerite Louise Orchestra under the inspired direction of Gaétan Jarry.

Recorded from 13 to 16 November 2020, and from 28 to 30 March 2021 at the Royal Chapel of the Château de Versailles.
