With Campra’s monumental Requiem, Emmanuelle HaÃ¯m and the Concert d’AstrÃ©e continue their beautiful mission: to unveil the masterpieces of the French Grand SiÃ¨cle. Complementing the “Requiem Mass” is “In convertendo dominus” by Rameau, the composer who is at the beginning and center of the Concert d’AstrÃ©e’s repertoire, but also “In exitu IsraÃ«l” by Mondonville.

Campra, Rameau, Mondonville – these great composers who were on the program at the court of Versailles find, under the direction of Emmanuelle HaÃ¯m, the style and unique taste so characteristic of the 17th century. The productions of Rameau’s Hipolythe et Aricie at the Paris Opera or Campras IdomÃ©nÃ©e at the Lille Opera, showered with praise, confirm the immense musician at the head of a top-class orchestra.

“AndrÃ© Campra’s Requiem of 1695 (commissioned in memory of the Archbishop of Paris) is the main event here, but the two ‘grands motets’ are much more than makeweights: Rameau’s In Convertendo sees a star turn from the agile baritone Victor Sicard, whilst Mondonville’s In exitu Israel features some astonishingly vivid word-painting. – Katherine Cooper
