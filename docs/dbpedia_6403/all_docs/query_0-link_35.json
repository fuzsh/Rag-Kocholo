Frankly it needs some restoration, the print the dvd comes from is rather deteriorated - but I digress. A fine bit of propaganda it is, stirling performances from Niven and Howard - but how much of it is true and how much theatrical invention? Did Mitchell ever meet Messerschmitt as portrayed in the film? I thought I might ask you chaps for observations.... tally ho!",

        "text": "Dave.\n\nQuite honestly you sometimes baffle me. You are a proud and constant upholder of the heritage of both your country and mine. That film is part of that heritage. There is nothing wrong with it being shown on tv or released on DVD. It is a piece of its time, and a good one at that. Take it for what it is. You also have to remember the purpose of the film. It was to boost morale, something I suspect it did well. Compare that with the modern American film about the U-Boat and Enigma. That was made for no other purpose than to make money. It bore not even the slightest resemblance to the truth.\n\nPerhaps Went The Day Well should never be released or aired again because it is a dated piece of fiction. Or Carve Her Name With Pride, Nine Men, One Of Our Aircraft Is Missing, The Way To The Stars...... The list goes on and on.\n\nIf one person watches any of those films (and countless others) today and is inspired to look deeper into the story then it will have served its purpose.\n\nRegards,\n\nkev35\n\nNew\n\nKevin,\n\nNone of the films you mention are based directly on factual events and as far as I'm aware none of them claim to be. Whereas First of the Few/Spitfire alledges to be the true story, but is so loosely based on truth that it simply distorts history.\n\nMy opinion is that as time goes on and future generations become more and more removed from understanding the propaganda situation and the reasons why the film was so different from the truth, and also understanding the events and technology of the Second World War, that this can only confound confusion for the future populace as to what really happened as opposed to what the film says happened.\n\nIn fifty, sixty, seventy years time there will be no wartime Spitfire pilots left, nor their children, and very few of the current crop of historians who've been able to have personal contact with the WWII generation. The history will become more and more filtered and \"revised\". Books are becoming more and more unpopular with the younger people who would rather research by hitting Youtube and looking at something thrown together by Discovery or History Channels. The way we learn has dramatically changed in the past ten years and as technology moves forward who knows how people will view books in fifty years time - they'll probably be as unpopular to a teen in 2065 as the abacus is to us. But visual media through electronic technology is becoming wider and wider, and more popular with education. Films will probably still be watched then.\n\nHence the reason I think it's time this film is laid to rest and a better, more accurate version made that puts the record straight. The same goes for several other factual films that have more fiction than reality.\n\nI spend a fair bit of time trying to record history accurately while we still have the veterans to tell it first hand, and I know that you too have also done this. In my research I have found that many \"respected\" books by \"respected\" authors are full of rubbish due to poor research, and I seem to be forever trying to correct misconceptions when I can find a more reliable source and I try to always back up my findings from extra sources when I can to ensure I don't have it wrong. I feel we as a society should embrace accuracy when it comes to history, and we don't need more misconceptions being created for generation after generation at will by things like this film, to be frank.\n\nFor the record, I have no issues with fiction-based films when they are what they are. I thought U-571 was brilliant as an action adventure, its intended purpose, and I have never seen anyone connected with the film attempting to claim it to be a true story based on real events and people. So there's no comparison. In fact they acknowledge the true heroes at the end, so what's wrong with that? I will say that I much prefer Das Boot though.\n\nNew"
