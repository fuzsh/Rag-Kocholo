        "text": "by Brenda Dillon\n\nI'm sure many of you have enjoyed the fun of going to a drive-in movie, but how many of you have experienced the utter relaxation of a dive- in movie?\n\nDan and I had our first opportunity to take in a dive-in movie during our week-long stay at the Wyndham Ocean Walk Resort in Daytona Beach, Fla. Thanks to the generosity of ACB member Tim Paul of Illinois, who donated this great vacation to the auction held at the 2007 national convention, and the fact that we were the lucky high bidders on this fabulous item, we were afforded this unique experience along with so many others.\n\nImagine watching great movies like \"Ever After\" or \"National Treasure\" while kicked back, relaxing in the pool, or lounging poolside for those who preferred a dry seat! As the heat of the sun gave way to the cooler evening breeze, the movie was shown on a huge inflatable screen set up outside by the pool. The freedom to move about and frolic a bit in the water added a carefree element to the viewing of the movie. A tiki bar was located nearby with luscious tropical drinks and yummy appetizers.\n\nIf you ever get a chance to stay at this resort, I strongly encourage you to do so. Our one-bedroom unit with full kitchen had a huge jacuzzi and included a balcony overlooking the majestic surf of the Atlantic. The resort featured numerous pools, both indoor and outdoor. In addition to a couple of really large hot tubs on the pool deck, there was a lazy river to float around in and a two-story curvy slide. You could dance and sing along with the live entertainment at the indoor bar, and there was a full schedule of fun activities to participate in each day. They hosted karaoke for adults and a special time for kids. There were tournaments to show off your skills at poker, billiards and golf. Various relays and competitions were held on the pool deck. We played the not-so-newlywed game but didn't win. Thankfully we didn't embarrass ourselves by coming in last either. Our team won in the \"Name That Tune\" game and received a very nice prize package. We made several neat crafts during our stay there, including glass bead memory bracelets, beach in a bubble ornaments, tile trivets, and stuffed an alligator and a pink flamingo. There was a three-level shopping mall with lots of great restaurants attached to this resort as well as an amphitheater where we heard a free concert.\n\nThe assistant property manager, Tom St. Peter, and his staff could not have been friendlier or more accommodating. Assistance was readily available, but they did not hover, which enabled us to feel independent and yet know that we could rely on capable staff when needed. They made our stay a very pleasant and fun-filled experience and provided us with memories we will cherish forever!\n\nI cannot end this article without bragging about our ACB family in Daytona Beach. John and Faye Harden extended true Southern hospitality! They introduced us to several great restaurants in town where we were joined by other ACB friends. Dan even went to work with John one day to observe him as he inspected library players and repaired braille writers. We invited them to join us for some fun events at the resort.\n\nBe forewarned, if this resort package is ever available again at the ACB benefit auction, the Dillons will be among the bidders trying to win this outstanding trip!! It's not too early to begin thinking about what you can donate to the 2008 ACB auction!"
