        "text": "Poor Things- film review\n\nNot so much a review, more an Oh My Goodness!!\n\nWe went to see Poor Things (directed by Yorgos Lanthimos) at the cinema last weekend and I’m so glad we did. This is a film absolutely meant to be seen on the big screen. Many reviews talk about how visually stunning it is, but I was still unprepared for how beautifully and wildly creative the designers, cinematographer, and costume department have been. There is so much to look at in every scene it is quite dizzying!\n\nThe screenplay is an adaptation of a book by Alasdair Gray. The story is a curious take on the Frankenstein idea of a mad doctor reanimating a corpse. The newly minted Bella has to relearn/learn everything about the world, and her thirst for adventure and discovery, and her wide eyed curiosity and surprise, are what drive the film.\n\nOne of my favourite scenes showed Bella discovering how music can move you to dance. Her response to the unfamiliar rhythms and sounds was so joyous and spontaneous I found it delightful. Hats off to the choreographer, who had Mark Ruffalo gamboling and prancing to such marvellous effect too.\n\nThe surreal nature of the story was effectively underpinned by the sets. More was definitely more, with little allowed to look in any way natural. Such a stylistic choice can only really succeed if fully committed to, and my goodness, here was whole hearted commitment. My favourite location was probably Lisbon, though the ship was fabulous too.\n\nEmma Stone has rightly (IMHO) won a Golden Globe for her performance as Bella Baxter. Will she bag an Oscar too? I hope so. In fact, all the performances were impressive I particularly applaud Willem Defoe for (for once) underplaying his role, and Mark Ruffalo for stupendously overplaying his. I grimaced at his appalling English accent to begin with, but soon it just felt right for the character.\n\nThis is not a film for the faint-hearted. The surgical experiment that results in the creation of Bella is stomach churning (speaking as someone whose idea of a horror movie is Ghostbusters!), and there is a lot of sex. And I mean a lot! If you are likely to be offended by either of those things don’t go, but you will be missing out on something truly special.\n\nPoor Things is a film about innocence, about discovery, about human nature. It makes us question the way we view things, the way we censor behaviour, the way we impose societal norms upon each other, and how seeing those norms disregarded can be both disturbing and exhilarating."
