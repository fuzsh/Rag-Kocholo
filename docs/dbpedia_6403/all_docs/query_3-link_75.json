Larry Flynt was seeking distributors for Hustler Magazine. What was expected to be a brief sideline led to their becoming fully immersed in the LGBT community as they took over a local store, Circus of Books. A decade later, they had become the biggest distributors of gay porn in the US. The film focuses on the double life they led, trying to maintain the balance of being parents at a time when LGBT culture was not yet accepted. Their many challenges included facing jail time for a federal obscenity prosecution and enabling their store to be a place of refuge at the height of the AIDS crisis.

This is the story of the Stones in exile, and the making of ‘Exile on Main Street.’ Featuring a treasure-trove of rare and never-before-seen film and photos, new interviews with the band and some of the men and women who bore witness to the album’s creation, STONES IN EXILE is a heady time-travel trip back to the summer of 1972 that bears witness to a vivid moment in rock and roll history.\n\nIn 1994 a 13-year-old boy disappeared without a trace from his home in San Antonio, Texas.

Just as the truth begins to dawn on you, another truth begins to emerge leaving you even more on edge.\n\nWhen Pat Tillman gave up his professional football career to join the Army Rangers in 2002, he became an instant symbol of patriotic fervor and unflinching duty. But the truth about Pat Tillman is far more complex, and ultimately far more heroic, than the caricature. And when the government tried to turn his death into propaganda, they took on the wrong family. From her home in Northern California, Pat’s mother, Dannie Tillman, led a crusade to reveal the truth beneath the mythology of their son’s life and death.

This is an entirely experiential film: the cameras never leave the valley: there are no interviews with the generals or diplomats.

The conclusions are up to you.\n\nMarla Olmstead was hailed as a prodigy at 4 years-old when her paintings – compared to Kandinsky, Pollock and even Picasso – started selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars. When Marla sprang to fame her parents were sucked into the media frenzy, before being halted in their tracks by a ’60 Minutes’ piece which cast doubt over the authenticity of her paintings and the integrity of the family. In the face of the notoriety and backlash – which included personal assaults and threats – the family turned to director Amir Bar Lev to exonerate them.

It’s a story that split Governments and divided Nations but at its heart is a tale of two young women who just wanted to run.\n\nHILLSBOROUGH is the definitive account of the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster, Britain’s worst sporting disaster in which 96 men, women and children were killed, hundreds injured and thousands traumatised. Beginning with that fateful day, April 15th 1989, the film details the horror of the tragedy, told through the eyes of those who bore witness to it, be they fans, survivors, family members or policemen, many speaking publicly for the first time. It weaves through the shocking details of the human crush, revealing the attitude of the Police towards soccer fans. And it exposes both the lack of leadership of shown on the day by the Police Commanders and the deceit of those in charge who shifted the responsibility for the disaster away from their actions and onto those of the fans. HILLSBOROUGH shines light on the lack of dignity shown to the bereaved in the identification process, the vilification of the fans that ensued in the media and in the court of public opinion, and the 25 year campaign for justice that was fought on behalf of the 96 victims.\n\nThe story of Nim, the chimpanzee who in the 1970s became the focus of a landmark experiment which aimed to show that an ape could learn to communicate with language if raised and nurtured like a human child. If successful, the consequences of the project would be profound, forever breaking down the barrier between man and his closest animal relative and fundamentally redefining what it is to be human. Combining the testimony of all the key participants, newly discovered archive film and dramatic imagery, this is the picaresque story of one chimpanzee’s extraordinary journey through human society and the enduring impact he makes on the people he meets along the way. Filmmaker James Marsh has directed an unflinching and unsentimental biography of an animal we tried to make human. What we learn about his true nature – and indeed our own – is comic, revealing and profoundly unsettling."
