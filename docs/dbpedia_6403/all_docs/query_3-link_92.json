        "text": "Crimson Tide, 1995, stars Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington, along with a list of fine supporting actors. The plot concerns an American nuclear submarine and the conflict between the Captain (Hackman) and his Executive Officer (Washington) about launching missiles at a Soviet missile base. I thought the plot was contrived, but the movie is enjoyable for the acting and action.\n\n1951’s Submarine Command has submarines in it, but this fiction is really about the impact of World War II combat. It has a fine cast with William Holden, Nancy Olson, William Bendix and Darryl Hickman. The plot concerns a terrible incident near the end of the War, and the trauma this incident has left behind – sort of an early post-traumatic stress syndrome film before that malady was even diagnosed! I hesitate to recommend this film even though I enjoyed it. Not to everyone’s taste.\n\nA truly fabulous sub movie is On The Beach, 1959, with Gregory Peck, Ava Gardner, and Fred Astaire, directed by Stanley Kramer, based on a Nevil Shute novel. This is a story about the end of the world after an atomic war. I loved both the book and the movie. The movie is fascinating, dramatic and thought-provoking. It was a huge hit. It is still fun to watch, even though much of it is quite passé. I strongly recommend it.\n\nThe League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003) is a mythic tale of superheroes fighting evil. It stars Sean Connery. His band of super heroes travels the world in a fantastic submarine, and they fight to end a horrible plot by Professor Moriarty of Sherlock Holmes’ fame. I liked the movie for its action, for Connery, for the Victorian era setting, and for the film’s originality. Worth watching if you are the kind who likes comic books, as I often do!\n\nYet another fine submarine movie is The Bedford Incident, 1965, with Richard Widmark, Sidney Poitier, and James MacArthur. This is the story of a fictional Cold War incident involving an American destroyer and a Soviet submarine. The two vessels are caught up in a standoff, and tension is high. This is a fine movie with a riveting plot, excellent acting, and superb setting. Dated, but still well worth watching!\n\nIn 1961, Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea was released, starring Walter Pidgeon, Barbara Eden, and Joan Fontaine, directed by Irwin Allen, who seemed to specialize in disaster films. The movie tells of the saving of the world by a state-of-the-art underwater vessel. It is sheer entertainment. I never did care for it, but it did well at the box office.\n\n1966’s Fantastic Voyage was a similar science fiction film. It starred Stephen Boyd, Raquel Welch, and Donald Pleasance. This time, the submarine is a miniaturized version, which is injected in a human body to perform lifesaving surgery on a Cold War scientist. This film is as bad as Voyage, but somehow seems to work better. Try it; I think you will enjoy it.\n\nIce Station Zebra is a 1968 Cold War era movie about an American nuclear submarine tasked with travelling under the Arctic ice to retrieve a satellite capsule. The movie has stars such as Rock Hudson, Patrick McGoohan, and Ernest Borgnine, and is based on an Alistair MacLean novel. The movie has the requisite confrontation with Soviet forces. It is quite entertaining and was well made. It also seemed to strongly convey the sense of the Cold War. Still fun to watch, but drags a bit.\n\nFinally, the submarine movie to end all sub movies! 1968’s Yellow Submarine is an animated, fantasy movie based on the Beatles and their music. The blue meanies attack a music-loving paradise under the sea, and they must be resisted by cartoon heroes with the voices of the Beatles at the height of their careers!"
