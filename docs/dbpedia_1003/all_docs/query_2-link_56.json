        "text": "REPRODUCTION OF THIS SPECIES:\n\nThe breeding season occurs from late September to March.\n\nThe Rodrigues Warbler is territorial. The nest is a deep cup built between 0,5 and 9 metres above the ground, in fork of two or more slender branches in tree such as Strawberry guava, Rose-apple or Tecoma.\n\nThe nest-shape may vary from tall, inverted cone to more or less flat-bottomed structure. The cup is made of woven grass and lined with some feathers.\n\nThe female lays 2-3 eggs, and both adults incubate during at least 10-11 days. One or two chicks are reared and fledge about two weeks after hatching. This species may produce two broods per season.\n\nPROTECTION / THREATS / STATUS:\n\nThe Rodrigues Warbler was once probably widespread on Rodrigues, but during the mid-20th century, its range contracted dramatically due to loss and fragmentation of the habitat, severe droughts and cyclones.\n\nIn 1999, the population was estimated less than 150 individuals, and this level remained until 2004. Thanks to habitat protection and reforestation, the population was estimated at 3,100/3,900 individuals by 2010, and close to 4,000 by 2012.\n\nThe population is now estimated at 3,000/4,000 individuals, equating to 2,000/2,700 mature individuals.\n\nThis population is still increasing but the species has restricted range and remains vulnerable to stochastic events and introduced species.\n\nThe Rodrigues Warbler is currently listed as Near Threatened.\n\nFr: Rousserolle de Rodrigues\n\nAng: Rodrigues Warbler\n\nAll: Rodriguezrohrsänger\n\nEsp: Carricero de Rodrigues\n\nIta: Cannaiola di Rodriguez\n\nNd: Rodriguesrietzanger\n\nSd: rodriguessångare\n\nPhotographer:\n\nDubi Shapiro\n\nDubi Shapiro Photo Galleries & Dubi Shapiro's Pictures on IBC\n\nText by Nicole Bouglouan\n\nSources:\n\nHANDBOOK OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD Vol 11 by Josep del Hoyo, Andrew Elliott and David Christie - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 849655306X\n\nL’ENCYCLOPEDIE MONDIALE DES OISEAUX - Dr Christopher M.

It frequents woodlands with non-native trees and shrubs, and dense vegetation close to clearings and forest edge. It feeds primarily on insects caught by gleaning. This species is territorial during the breeding season.\n\nThe Rodrigues Warbler is threatened by habitat loss, predation by cats and rats, cyclones and drought, and degradation of remaining suitable habitat. However, following a period of stable numbers between 1999 and 2004, the species has now increased its population by 2010, but the Rodrigues Warbler is currently listed as Near Threatened.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:\n\nBiometrics:\n\nLength: 13-14 cm\n\nWeight: 11-13 g\n\nThe Rodrigues Warbler is a medium-sized warbler. Crown and upperparts are olive-brown whereas underparts are pale yellowish in fresh plumage and mostly greyish-white with yellow wash in worn plumage. The tail is long and graduated. The wings are short and rounded, with a large first primary.\n\nOn the head, the crown is olive-brown. We can see a pale yellowish supercilium and a short, blackish eyestripe. The cheeks are pale olive-brown and the lores are pale yellow.\n\nThe long, thin bill is pinkish to flesh-coloured with blackish culmen. The eyes are dark reddish-brown. Long legs and feet are blue-grey with yellowish soles.\n\nMale and female are similar.\n\nThe juvenile has throat and breast variably yellow. The belly is whitish.\n\nRANGE:\n\nThe Rodrigues Warbler is resident and sedentary on Rodrigues.\n\nHABITAT:\n\nThe Rodrigues Warbler frequents scrubs and woodlands, but it is restricted to the central uplands where its distribution is fragmented. It is found in dense thickets and woodlands with non-native trees and shrubs. It usually favours the dense vegetation with an access to more open areas such as clearings and forest edge.\n\nCALLS AND SONGS: SOUNDS BY XENO-CANTO\n\nThe Rodrigues Warbler gives sharp, sparrow-like calls described as « chipipi » or « chitik”.\n\nThe song is short and lasts only 1-2 seconds. The bird repeats a low, musical phrase, preceded of followed by one or two conversational notes. The sound may vary from one song to another, from rapid to harsher or strongly disyllabic, reminiscent of a Great Tit.\n\nBEHAVIOUR IN THE WILD:\n\nThe Rodrigues Warbler feeds primarily on insects caught by gleaning in canopy or subcanopy. The diet includes homopteran bugs, and also lepidopteran adults and larvae.\n\nThe bird often cocks the tail up and down or flicks it from side to side. It is a very agile and active species, always moving while foraging by gleaning from leaves and twigs.\n\nThe Rodrigues Warbler is apparently monogamous, but occasional co-operative breeding is probable, although the territory is usually occupied by two birds. The species sings from anywhere within the territory and does not have usual perches.\n\nThe Rodrigues Warbler is resident on Rodrigues. It does not fly over long distances, because its long tail and the short, rounded wings make the flight low and laboured."
