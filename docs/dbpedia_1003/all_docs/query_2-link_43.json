        "text": "Erasmus University Rotterdam is a university of academics and practitioners. The enterprising academics and students endeavor to solve global social challenges in the fields of wealth, health, governance and culture. They draw inspiration from the metropolis, which serves as both a testing ground and a laboratory. The university was founded in 1913, when a group of Rotterdam businessmen established the Netherlands School of Commerce to meet the growing demand for skilled personnel for the companies operating in the port of Rotterdam. Later it changed its name and achieved world fame in economics and econometrics, under the guidance of renowned scholars like Nobel Prize winner Jan Tinbergen. The university has always had an international character. Anyone who studies at Erasmus University, which attracts more than 22,000 students, is in fact already doing an international program. Rotterdam is a world port city with and an international life that goes with it. The grant made available by the university is named after Dr. Suzana Rodrigues, who taught at the university for many years.\n\nThe Netherlands is a small country, approximately the size of Maryland or West-Virginia. It is a fairly densely populated country, with good public transport links. This makes it easy to travel to other parts of the country during your stay. It has a temperate climate with a fair amount of rain. The Dutch economy is geared mainly towards import/export, services and trade, and less on heavy industry. Most Dutch people will be able to speak basic English, and you will be able to get around without speaking Dutch. However, it is really appreciated if you learn some Dutch either before or during your stay in the Netherlands. With two airports in Amsterdam and Eindhoven, it is also easy to reach other European countries for weekend trips.\n\nThe Dutch are known for being direct, which can also be interpreted as being rude or blunt. In general, most Fulbright grantees indicate that it takes a bit of getting used to, but they appreciate it after being in the country for a while. The grading system in the Netherlands may also take some time getting used to. It ranges from 10-1, with a 10 being a perfect score and anything below 6 a fail. The grades 10 and 9 are rarely given, only in case of exceptionally good work, a 7 and 8 are considered to be good grades. Also, the courses and grading are mostly based on exams at the end of term. In terms of discussions on diversity, equity and access, there is a growing awareness of the systemic inequalities in society. You may find that there are differences in interpretation and the discussion between the U.S. and the Netherlands on these topics.\n\nThe Dutch Fulbright Commission will organize four meetings during your stay, two introduction meetings at the beginning of the grant period, a mid-year evaluation and a meeting at the end of the grant period. There also is a cultural excursion program in place, where an alumna organizes 5 excursions to places of interest in the Netherlands."
