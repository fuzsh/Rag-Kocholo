        "text": "About Rodrigues Fruit Bats\n\nRodrigues fruit bats are one of 60 bat species often referred to as \"flying foxes.” They get this nickname from their dog-like faces, large eyes and widespread ears. Rodrigues fruit bats are covered with thick, brownish-black fur and have gold fur on their neck, head and shoulders. These large bats have a wingspan of about three feet, a length of five to seven inches and usually weigh less than one pound. Males are generally larger than females, but otherwise, it is difficult to differentiate between sexes.\n\nRodrigues fruit bats are crepuscular, meaning they are active at sunset and sunrise. These bats are social animals, living in colonies. Females roost in groups while males often roost by themselves. A dominance hierarchy has been observed among males, who will mark their territory by rubbing their heads, necks and shoulders on branches\n\nFlying foxes are members of a subfamily known as “megabats,” or Megachiroptera, which are large, frugivorous bats. Unlike smaller bat species, megabats have simple external ears and cannot use echolocation to search for food. Instead, they use their eyesight and sense of smell to find fruit, which they grab and hold with their large thumbs while they eat. These bats will then eat the fruit by taking a bite and crushing the fruit between their tongues and the ridged upper palate of their mouths. Bats will then swallow the juice and soft pulp and spit out the hard pulp, seeds and skin. In spitting out and dispersing these seeds, bats are helping to re-plant the rainforest.\n\nHabitat\n\nRodrigues fruit bats live in dense forest areas.\n\nGeographic Range\n\nThese bats are found only on the island of Rodriguez, located off the east coast of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean.\n\nDiet\n\nRodrigues fruit bats are frugivores who will eat ripe fruit such as bananas, papaya, figs, guavas and mangoes, as well as fresh flowers.\n\nPopulation Status\n\nThese bats are listed as “endangered” by the IUCN Red List. Major threats to their survival include deforestation, which leaves them without homes; strong island storms, which destroy large trees which protect them leaving them subjected to harsh weather; and limited availability of food as storms strip fruit from the trees. There are several programs geared toward supporting this species around the world, including an AZA Species Survival Plan (SSP), in which the Akron Zoo participates."
