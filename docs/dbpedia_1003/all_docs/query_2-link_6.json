        "text": "AN ISLAND OFF THE BEATEN TRACK\n\nRodrigues is a charming, remote, holiday island in the Indian Ocean. It was named after the Portuguese explorer Diogo Rodrigues and is the smallest of the Mascarene Islands and a dependency of Mauritius.\n\nRodrigues has a stunning landscape of hills, flora, and beautiful beaches and is surrounded by tiny islets such as the popular Ile aux Cocos.\n\nThe topography varies between steep volcanic inclines of basaltic rock and rolling hills, though the highest peak is Mont Limon, just 395 metres high. The 78 km coastline features fantastic sandy beaches with wild creeks, numerous coves and imposing cliffs. The coral reefs and lagoons are twice the size of the island, providing a marine life that is rich and dense, making Rodrigues an ideal diving location. Rodrigues is also the only Mascarene Island to contain substantial limestone deposits and caves.\n\nRodrigues is often thought of nostalgically as the island where time stands still. The islandâs natural beauty is well preserved and the Rodriguan people live a simple life making Rodrigues a perfect destination for âgoing off the beaten trackâ for a few days of peace and tranquillity. The charm and relaxed pace of life attracts tourists from all over the world who delight in the serene ambiance.\n\nRodrigues truly is an ideal location for a quiet, and yet memorable vacation. The tropical flora is enchanting, the natural landscape as a whole is mesmerising, and for those who enjoy a more active holiday, there are great hiking opportunities as well as numerous water sports, including some of the best diving spots in the world."
