        "text": "Primate are social animals, and my research focuses on how sociality affects our biology. To understand these processes, I focus on friendship, social networks, and stress in human and non-human primates. I’m especially interested in the evolution of female social relationships in species where females are typically unrelated and have flexibility in who they choose to associate with. In “fission-fusion” societies, social grouping is flexible. Spider monkeys, chimpanzees, bonobos, and humans have greater opportunities to choose to associate with others or spend time alone compared to primates living in cohesive social groups. I’m interested in how those choices shape social networks and impact stress and health. Through stress pathways, social experiences can have long-term effects on health throughout our lifespans. My ultimate goal is to apply our understanding of these processes to conserve wild primates, improve captive primate welfare, and ensure a healthy social environment for girls and women in science.\n\nFor access to publications, see my ResearchGate page.

However, sympatric howler and capuchin monkeys are not (yet). As part of my dissertation research, I examined how spider monkeys coped with anthropogenic pressures by altering subgrouping size. With colleagues Tracie McKinney and Stacy Lindshield, I am examining how human economic activity and disturbance impact spider monkey, capuchin, and howler monkey densities at El Zota Biological Field Station in northeastern Costa Rica, and Puerto Viejo-Gandoca-Manzanillo in southeastern Costa Rica. This project builds on the conservation work done with The Monkey Bridge Project. We hope to expand this work by conducting further comparative research on stress and social grouping processes at these two sites.\n\nRelevant Publications:\n\nRodrigues MA.

Does having close friends and a robust social network help you deal with the stressors that come from your social and academic environment? What happens if you don’t have a strong female support network? I am examining these questions in teenage girls and female scientists–both populations that have varying amounts of interpersonal stressors, as well as varying levels of social integration. With Kate Clancy, Carla Hunter, Jenny Amos, and others, we worked with a summer science camp where campers participated on a research project examining how the social environment affects adolescent girls. My postdoctoral includes both qualitative and quantitative data focusing on workplace stressors in women of color in science, and I’m now extending this project to include white female scientists. Additionally, with Liz Stine-Morrow and Si On Yoon, I am collaborating on research examining how social communication with friends and strangers changes with age in female dyads.\n\nRodrigues, M.A., Yoon, S.O., Clancy K.H.B., Stine-Morrow E.A.L.

These three species provide an interesting contrast. Spider monkeys and chimpanzees are distantly related, but exhibit a striking convergence in social patterns. Conversely, chimpanzees and bonobos are sister species, but exhibit differences in patterns of sexual behavior and social bonding. We compared social grooming network in both Pan species and spider monkeys to examine how similarities in how they utilize affiliative behaviors to mediate those relationships. Ultimately, we would like to apply our findings to improve captive welfare and management.\n\nRelevant Publications:\n\nBoeving ER, Rodrigues MA, Nelson EL.

However, as we do more research, we are recognizing that female social relationships are much more complicated. My dissertation research examined the “tend-and-befriend” hypothesis to examine if female spider monkeys seek affiliation with other primates to cope with stress. Female spider monkeys disperse in early adulthood, and other studies indicate that they have weak social relationships. However, I found that some females did form close bonds with other females, and increased affiliation with females when experiencing high stress levels. Furthermore, lactating females experienced higher stress levels than cycling females, which may be due to the the threat of male coalitionary aggression.\n\nRelevant Publications:\n\nRodrigues MA. 2017.Female spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) cope with anthropogenic disturbance through fission-fusion dynamics.

This extended developmental stage provides primates with opportunities to gain the social and ecological skills they need to become functional adults. My early research focused on social behavior in juvenile howler and spider monkeys, in order to examine how their social behaviors prepare them for adulthood. In both species, I found that juveniles actively seek social opportunities. In spider monkeys, male and female juveniles engage in sex-segregated patterns, in which they preferentially play with same-sexed peers. Furthermore, juvenile males interacted more widely, and spent more time in subgroups containing adult males. I’m currently collaborating with Emily Boeving to examine juvenile social development in captive Colombian spider monkeys.\n\nRelevant Publications:\n\nBoeving ER, Rodrigues MA, Nelson EL.
