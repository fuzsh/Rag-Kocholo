        "text": "Introduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nBackground\n\nAlthough known to Arab and Malay sailors as early as the 10th century, Mauritius was first explored by the Portuguese in the 16th century and subsequently settled by the Dutch - who named it in honor of Prince Maurits van NASSAU - in the 17th century. The French assumed control in 1715, developing the island into an important naval base overseeing Indian Ocean trade, and establishing a plantation economy of sugar cane. The British captured the island in 1810, during the Napoleonic Wars. Mauritius remained a strategically important British naval base, and later an air station, playing an important role during World War II for anti-submarine and convoy operations, as well as the collection of signals intelligence. Independence from the UK was attained in 1968. A stable democracy with regular free elections and a positive human rights record, the country has attracted considerable foreign investment and has one of Africa's highest per capita incomes.\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nSouthern Africa, island in the Indian Ocean, about 800 km (500 mi) east of Madagascar\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n20 17 S, 57 33 E\n\nMap references\n\nAfrica\n\nArea\n\ntotal: 2,040 sq km\n\nland: 2,030 sq km\n\nwater: 10 sq km\n\nnote: includes Agalega Islands, Cargados Carajos Shoals (Saint Brandon), and Rodrigues\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 181\n\nArea - comparative\n\nalmost 11 times the size of Washington, DC\n\nLand boundaries\n\n0 km\n\nCoastline\n\n177 km\n\nMaritime claims\n\nterritorial sea: 12nm\n\nexclusive economic zone: 200nm\n\ncontinental shelf: 200nm or to the edge of the continental margin\n\nmeasured from claimed archipelagic straight baselines\n\nClimate\n\ntropical, modified by southeast trade winds; warm, dry winter (May to November); hot, wet, humid summer (November to May)\n\nTerrain\n\nsmall coastal plain rising to discontinuous mountains encircling central plateau\n\nElevation\n\nlowest point: Indian Ocean 0 m\n\nhighest point: Mont Piton 828 m\n\nNatural resources\n\narable land, fish\n\nLand use\n\nagricultural land: 43.8% (2011 est.)\n\narable land: 38.4% (2011 est.)/permanent crops: 2% (2011 est.)/permanent pasture: 3.4% (2011 est.)\n\nforest: 17.3% (2011 est.)\n\nother: 38.9% (2011 est.)\n\nIrrigated land\n\n190 sq km (2012)\n\nPopulation distribution\n\npopulation density is one of the highest in the world; urban cluster are found throught the main island, with a greater density in and around Port Luis; population on Rodrigues Island is spread across the island with a slightly denser cluster on the north coast\n\nNatural hazards\n\ncyclones (November to April); almost completely surrounded by reefs that may pose maritime hazards\n\nEnvironment - current issues\n\nwater pollution, degradation of coral reefs; soil erosion; wildlife preservation; solid waste disposal\n\nEnvironment - international agreements\n\nparty to: Antarctic-Marine Living Resources, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Life Conservation, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands\n\nsigned, but not ratified: none of the selected agreements\n\nGeography - note\n\nthe main island, from which the country derives its name, is of volcanic origin and is almost entirely surrounded by coral reefs; former home of the dodo, a large flightless bird related to pigeons, driven to extinction by the end of the 17th century through a combination of hunting and the introduction of predatory species\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPopulation\n\n1,364,283 (July 2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 155\n\nNationality\n\nnoun: Mauritian(s)\n\nadjective: Mauritian\n\nEthnic groups\n\nIndo-Mauritian (compose approximately two thirds of the total population), Creole, Sino-Mauritian, Franco-Mauritian\n\nnote: Mauritius has not had a question on ethnicity on its national census since 1972\n\nLanguages\n\nCreole 86.5%, Bhojpuri 5.3%, French 4.1%, two languages 1.4%, other 2.6% (includes English, the official language of the National Assembly, which is spoken by less than 1% of the population), unspecified 0.1% (2011 est.)\n\nReligions\n\nHindu 48.5%, Roman Catholic 26.3%, Muslim 17.3%, other Christian 6.4%, other 0.6%, none 0.7%, unspecified 0.1% (2011 est.)\n\nDemographic profile\n\nMauritius has transitioned from a country of high fertility and high mortality rates in the 1950s and mid-1960s to one with among the lowest population growth rates in the developing world today. After World War II, Mauritius’ population began to expand quickly due to increased fertility and a dramatic drop in mortality rates as a result of improved health care and the eradication of malaria. This period of heightened population growth – reaching about 3% a year – was followed by one of the world’s most rapid birth rate declines.The total fertility rate fell from 6.2 children per women in 1963 to 3.2 in 1972 – largely the result of improved educational attainment, especially among young women, accompanied by later marriage and the adoption of family planning methods. The family planning programs’ success was due to support from the government and eventually the traditionally pronatalist religious communities, which both recognized that controlling population growth was necessary because of Mauritius’ small size and limited resources. Mauritius’ fertility rate has consistently been below replacement level since the late 1990s, a rate that is substantially lower than nearby countries in southern Africa.With no indigenous population, Mauritius’ ethnic mix is a product of more than two centuries of European colonialism and continued international labor migration. Sugar production relied on slave labor mainly from Madagascar, Mozambique, and East Africa from the early 18th century until its abolition in 1835, when slaves were replaced with indentured Indians. Most of the influx of indentured labor – peaking between the late 1830s and early 1860 – settled permanently creating massive population growth of more than 7% a year and reshaping the island’s social and cultural composition. While Indians represented about 12% of Mauritius’ population in 1837, they and their descendants accounted for roughly two-thirds by the end of the 19th century. Most were Hindus, but the majority of the free Indian traders were Muslims.Mauritius again turned to overseas labor when its success in clothing and textile exports led to a labor shortage in the mid-1980s. Clothing manufacturers brought in contract workers (increasingly women) from China, India, and, to a lesser extent Bangladesh and Madagascar, who worked longer hours for lower wages under poor conditions and were viewed as more productive than locals. Downturns in the sugar and textile industries in the mid-2000s and a lack of highly qualified domestic workers for Mauritius’ growing services sector led to the emigration of low-skilled workers and a reliance on skilled foreign labor. Since 2007, Mauritius has pursued a circular migration program to enable citizens to acquire new skills and savings abroad and then return home to start businesses and to invest in the country’s development.\n\nAge structure\n\n0-14 years: 19.9%(male 138,707 /female 132,774)\n\n15-24 years: 14.52%(male 100,281 /female 97,836)\n\n25-54 years: 43.6%(male 297,558 /female 297,243)\n\n55-64 years: 11.81%(male 76,620 /female 84,554)\n\n65 years and over: 10.17%(male 57,094 /female 81,616) (2018 est.)\n\npopulation pyramid:\n\nDependency ratios\n\ntotal dependency ratio: 41.6 (2015 est.)\n\nyouth dependency ratio: 27.5 (2015 est.)\n\nelderly dependency ratio: 14.1 (2015 est.)\n\npotential support ratio: 7.1 (2015 est.)\n\nMedian age\n\ntotal: 35.7 years (2018 est.)\n\nmale: 34.5 years\n\nfemale: 36.7 years\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 77\n\nPopulation growth rate\n\n0.57% (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 150\n\nBirth rate\n\n12.8 births/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 152\n\nDeath rate\n\n7.1 deaths/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 127\n\nNet migration rate\n\n0 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 92\n\nPopulation distribution\n\npopulation density is one of the highest in the world;

Mauritius has achieved steady growth over the last several decades, resulting in more equitable income distribution, increased life expectancy, lowered infant mortality, and a much-improved infrastructure. The economy currently depends on sugar, tourism, textiles and apparel, and financial services, but is expanding into fish processing, information and communications technology, education, and hospitality and property development. Sugarcane is grown on about 90% of the cultivated land area but sugar makes up only around 3-4% of national GDP. Authorities plan to emphasize services and innovation in the coming years. After several years of slow growth, government policies now seek to stimulate economic growth in five areas: serving as a gateway for international investment into Africa; increasing the use of renewable energy; developing smart cities; growing the ocean economy; and upgrading and modernizing infrastructure, including public transportation, the port, and the airport. Mauritius has attracted more than 32,000 offshore entities, many aimed at commerce in India, South Africa, and China. The Mauritius International Financial Center is under scrutiny by international bodies promoting fair tax competition and Mauritius has been cooperating with the European Union and the United states in the automatic exchange of account information. Mauritius is also a member of the OECD/G20’s Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting and is under pressure to review its Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements. The offshore sector is vulnerable to changes in the tax framework and authorities have been working on a Financial Services Sector Blueprint to enable Mauritius to transition to a jurisdiction of higher value added. Mauritius’ textile sector has taken advantage of the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, a preferential trade program that allows duty free access to the US market, with Mauritian exports to the US growing by 35.6 % from 2000 to 2014. However, lack of local labor as well as rising labor costs eroding the competitiveness of textile firms in Mauritius. Mauritius' sound economic policies and prudent banking practices helped mitigate negative effects of the global financial crisis in 2008-09. GDP grew in the 3-4% per year range in 2010-17, and the country continues to expand its trade and investment outreach around the globe. Growth in the US and Europe fostered goods and services exports, including tourism, while lower oil prices kept inflation low. Mauritius continues to rank as one of the most business-friendly environments on the continent and passed a Business Facilitation Act to improve competitiveness and long-term growth prospects.

Mauritian girls are induced or sold into prostitution, often by peers, family members, or businessmen offering other forms of employment; Mauritian adults have been identified as labor trafficking victims in the UK, Belgium, and Canada, while Mauritian women from Rodrigues Island are also subject to domestic servitude in Mauritius; Malagasy women transit Mauritius en route to the Middle East for jobs as domestic servants and subsequently are subjected to forced labor; Cambodian men are victims of forced labor on foreign fishing vessels in Mauritius’ territorial waters; other migrant workers from East and South Asia and Madagascar are also subject to forced labor in Mauritius’ manufacturing and construction sectors\n\ntier rating: Tier 2 Watch List – Mauritius does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so; in 2014, the government made modest efforts to address child sex trafficking but none related to adult forced labor; law enforcement lacks an understanding of trafficking crimes outside of child sex trafficking, despite increasing evidence of other forms of human trafficking; authorities made no trafficking prosecutions or convictions and made modest efforts to assist a couple of child sex trafficking victims; officials sustained an extensive public awareness campaign to prevent child sex trafficking, but no efforts were made to raise awareness or reduce demand for forced adult or child labor (2015)\n\nIllicit drugs\n\nconsumer and transshipment point for heroin from South Asia; small amounts of cannabis produced and consumed locally; significant offshore financial industry creates potential for money laundering, but corruption levels are relatively low and the government appears generally to be committed to regulating its banking industry\n\nFlag of Mauritius\n\nFlag of Mauritius\n\nFlag of Mauritius"
