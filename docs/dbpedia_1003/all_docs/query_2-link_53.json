        "text": "At the heart of the Indian Ocean Rodrigues Island stretches over a surface area of 108 sq km some 620 km to the north-east of Mauritius, it is the part of Africa that is closest to Australia.\n\nRodrigues is a wonderful playground for scuba divers who quickly fall in love with the diverse coral reef eco-system and its colourful assortment of sub-aquatic flora and fauna. Equally, the island appeals to those with a love of windsurfing, kitesurfing, sailing and fishing. Thanks to its outer reef edges sitting nearly ten kilometres away from the coastline, Rodriguan waters are rich in fish. In fact, no fewer than three world record catches have been hooked here since 2005.\n\nIt isn’t only those who like the ocean that will be swayed by Rodrigues’ charms. Yellows, greens and blues, nature on Rodrigues throbs with a palette of colours. Rarely will visitors encounter such a variety of landscapes in such a small area.\n\nBorn from volcanic activity between 1.3 and 1.5 million years ago, the island 18 km long and 8 km wide, is the smallest of the Mascarene archipelago. Rodrigues is a mountainous island with a succession of valleys plunging to the 300 sq km lagoon, bringing an exhilarating feeling of weightlessness whilst meandering through steep escarpments and terraced fields towards its 80-km coastline. The island enjoys a tropical climate with temperatures varying between 28 and 35°C during the summer, which coincides with the cyclonic season (November to April) and between 18 and 27°C in winter.\n\nSet off by foot or for a drive to discover Rodrigues to the rhythm of passing time. “Let time have its way”, “Take your time” are fashionable mantras. Don’t miss the most essential, a fauna and flora that are worth taking the time to admire.\n\nRodrigues most naturally lends itself to discovery whilst wandering around the island and encountering the population. Share the bond of walking, which has long been the only means for many people to travel from one place to another. Exalting encounters await you along footpaths that are always kept in good condition. Rodrigues has the particularity of offering a variety of landscapes despite its small surface area…\n\nWhat to see?\n\nMont Limon: Mont Limon, the highest point at 398 m above sea level, is situated at the heart of the island. Easily accessible, it offers a panoramic 360° view over the island and its sublime lagoon.\n\nPort Mathurin: Port Mathurin is the chief town and regional administration centre of Rodrigues. On Saturdays, the town is taken over by a particular atmosphere. It is market day and the day when ships bringing fresh supplies from Mauritius sail into port.\n\nA Lagoon With Infinite Shades Of Blue: Approaching Rodrigues by air, one gets the measure of the size of the lagoon compared to the surface area of the island, roughly in the proportion of three to one. Traditional fishing activities have been conducted since settlement on the island in the 18th century. The lagoon provides for the needs of the islanders in fish and other seafood. The calling of the lagoon is gradually changing due to its natural characteristics, it lends itself ideally to glide sports such as windsurfing and kitesurfing as well as sailing. Boat trips also remain a major attraction, providing a completely different approach to the small isolated inlets along the coastline. Lost in the shades of blue of the sea, indulge yourself in swimming or snorkelling along the channels that, here and there, link the lagoon to the ocean. After landing on the inlet or on the beach, immerse yourself in the rejuvenating feeling of isolation that prevails.\n\nIle Aux Cocos: Located amidst the south-eastern lagoon of Rodrigues and reputed for the sandy necklace of beach encircling its shores, the ill-named Ile aux Cocos is in fact a natural refuge for colonies of seabirds, just like its twin sister, Ile aux Sables, a short distance away. Ile aux Cocos can be accessed by pirogue only by registered operators that have access to the island for the day.\n\nTrou D’Argent: Accessible on foot from Graviers, Pointe Canon or Saint François, Trou d’Argent is reminiscent of those hidden treasures never to be found. Nestled in an inlet a short distance away from the coral reef, it can be reached with moderate effort by walking along the coastline and preserved narrow creek-like coves. Offering a true change of scenery, its peaceful atmosphere is lulled by the rolling waves almost at arm’s reach, breaking on the reefs. Trou d’Argent has recently been ranked among the 30 best preserved beaches in the world.\n\nCaverne Patate: Embedded underneath a coral plain resulting from the movement of tectonic plates, Caverne Patate is one of the key places to visit while on vacation in Rodrigues. For a small fee professional guides will take you to discover of the extensive stalactites and stalagmites unique in the Indian Ocean.\n\nFrançois Leguat Giant Tortoise And Cave Reserve: On the southern coast, just minutes away from the airport, the François Leguat Giant Tortoise and Cave Reserve is the result of passion for the natural heritage of the island. Until the 18th century, three species of tortoise could be found here according to the accounts of François Leguat himself. Over-exploitation as a consequence of man’s quest for fresh meat for sea voyages got the better of the population of reptiles in a matter of decades. Restoration enthusiasts embarked on a project to reintroduce akin species of tortoises from Aldabra and Madagascar, amongst others.\n\nRodrigues Jardin des 5 Sens: Located in the centre of the island in an enchanting and verdant scenery is the botanical garden of Rodrigues, “Jardin 5 Sens” offers an immersion in the Rodriguan fauna and flora with endemic plants which are unique in the world, fruit trees, aromatic and medicinal plants and flowers. Through guided tours you can learn about the legends, medicinal virtues and culinary benefits of plants that grow in the Rodriguan fertile soil.\n\nWhat to do?"
