        "meta_description": "Rodrigues is a small island measuring approximately 108 km2. It is one of a number of islands that form part of the Republic of Mauritius. It is characterised by its remoteness and its high population density. The island has undergone a continuous transformation since the 1980s from a subsistence economy to become a diversified sustainable economy due to the dynamism of new sectors such as tourism, small-scale industry, information and communication technologies, and services. The various factors that have contributed to this transformation are investment in local infrastructure, the improvement of air, sea, and Internet connectivity with Mauritius, policies for the promotion of the local folklore and culture, support of entrepreneurship, and political and administrative decentralisation that makes Rodrigues unique as an autonomous island. The development dynamic is evidenced by growth in the number of private enterprises and employment. Tourism has played a leading role in this development dynamic as it cuts across many sectors and interests and is a powerful leverage of valorisation of local resources that make the uniqueness of Rodrigues. Tourism development is predominantly of eco-tourism nature which is embedded in the social and natural fabric of the island. Sport tourism, in particular, has significantly contributed in making Rodrigues known as a tourist destination and in terms of income generation, cultural vitality, and nature regeneration.",
