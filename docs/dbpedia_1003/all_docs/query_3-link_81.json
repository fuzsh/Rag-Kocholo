        "text": "The purpose of the ISCHEMIA trial is to determine the best management strategy for higher-risk patients with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD). This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial with 5179 randomized participants with moderate or severe ischemia on stress testing. A blinded coronary computed tomography angiogram (CCTA) was performed in most participants with eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73m2 to identify and exclude participants with either significant unprotected left main disease (≥50% stenosis) or those without obstructive CAD (\\<50% stenosis in all major coronary arteries). Of 8518 participants enrolled, those that had insufficient ischemia, ineligible anatomy demonstrated on CCTA or another exclusion criterion, did not go on to randomization. Eligible participants were then assigned at random to a routine invasive strategy (INV) with cardiac catheterization followed by revascularization, if feasible, plus optimal medical therapy (OMT) or to a conservative strategy (CON) of OMT, with cardiac catheterization and revascularization reserved for those who fail OMT. SPECIFIC AIMS A. Primary Aim The primary aim of the ISCHEMIA trial is to determine whether an initial invasive strategy of cardiac catheterization followed by optimal revascularization, if feasible, in addition to OMT, will reduce the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for unstable angina or heart failure in participants with SIHD and moderate or severe ischemia over an average follow-up of approximately 3.5 years compared with an initial conservative strategy of OMT alone with catheterization reserved for failure of OMT. B. Secondary Aims Secondary aims are to determine whether an initial invasive strategy compared to a conservative strategy will improve: 1) the composite of CV death or MI; 2) angina symptoms and quality of life, as assessed by the Seattle Angina Questionnaire; 3) all-cause mortality; 4) net clinical benefit assessed by including stroke in the primary and secondary composite endpoints; and 5) individual components of the composite endpoints. Condition: Coronary Disease Procedure: Coronary CT Angiogram Procedure: Cardiac catheterization Phase: Phase III per NIH Condition: Cardiovascular Diseases Procedure: Angioplasty, Transluminal, Percutaneous Coronary, other catheter-based interventions Phase: Phase III per NIH Condition: Heart Diseases Procedure: Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery Phase: Phase III per NIH\n\nStanford is currently not accepting patients for this trial.\n\nView full details\n\nAbstract\n\nThere is a dearth of research on immunophenotyping in peripheral artery disease (PAD). This study aimed to describe the baseline characteristics, immunophenotypic profile, and quality of life (QoL) of participants with PAD in the Project Baseline Health Study (PBHS).The PBHS study is a prospective, multi-center, longitudinal cohort study that collected clinical, molecular, and biometric data from participants recruited between 2017 and 2018. In this analysis, baseline demographic, clinical, mobility, QoL, and flow cytometry data were stratified by the presence of PAD (ankle brachial index [ABI] ≤0.90).Of 2,209 participants, 58 (2.6%) had lower-extremity PAD, and only 2 (3.4%) had pre-existing PAD diagnosed prior to enrollment. Comorbid smoking (29.3% vs. 14%, p<0.001), hypertension (54% vs. 30%, p<0.001), diabetes (25% vs. 14%, p=0.031), and at least moderate coronary calcifications (Agatston score >100: 32% vs. 17%, p=0.01) were significantly higher in participants with PAD than in those with normal ABIs, as were high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels (5.86 vs. 2.83, p<0.001). After adjusting for demographic and risk factors, participants with PAD had significantly fewer circulating CD56-high natural killer cells, IgM+ memory B cells, and CD10/CD27 double-positive B cells (p<0.05 for all).This study reinforces existing evidence that a large proportion of PAD without claudication may be underdiagnosed, particularly in female and Black or African American participants. We describe a novel immunophenotypic profile of participants with PAD that could represent a potential future screening or diagnostic tool to facilitate earlier diagnosis of PAD.NCT03154346, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03154346.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ahj.2024.06.010\n\nView details for PubMedID 38969081\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Statins are a cost-effective therapy for prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Guidelines on statins for primary prevention are unclear for older adults (>75 years).Objective: Investigate statin utility in older adults without ASCVD events, by risk stratifying in a large healthcare network.Methods: We included 8,114 older adults, without CAD, PVD or ischemic stroke. Statin utilization based on ACC/AHA 10-year ASCVD risk calculation, was evaluated in intermediate (7.5%-19.9%) and high-risk patients (≥ 20%); and categorized using low and 'moderate or high' intensity statins with a follow up period of 7 years. Cox regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios for incident ASCVD and mortality across risk categories stratified by statin utilization. Data was adjusted for competing risk using Elixhauser Comorbidity Index.Results: Compared with those on moderate or high intensity statins, high-risk older patients not on any statin had a significantly increased risk of MI [HR 1.51 (1.17-1.95); p<0.01], stroke [HR 1.47 (1.14-1.90); p<0.01] and all-cause mortality [HR 1.37 (1.19-1.58); p<0.001] in models adjusted for Elixhauser Comorbidity Index. When comparing the no statin group versus the moderate or high intensity statin group in the intermediate risk cohort, although a trend for increased risk was seen, it did not meet statistical significance thresholds for MI, stroke or all-cause mortality.Conclusion: Lack of statin use was associated with increased cardiovascular events and mortality in high-risk older adults. Given the benefits appreciated, statin use may need to be strongly considered for primary ASCVD prevention among high-risk older adults. Future studies will assess the risk-benefit ratio of statin intervention in older adults.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ajpc.2024.100664\n\nView details for PubMedID 38665251\n\nAbstract\n\nLipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a causal risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).The authors assessed differences in Lp(a) testing and levels by disaggregated race, ethnicity, and ASCVD risk.This was a retrospective cohort study of patients from a large California health care system from 2010 to 2021. Eligible individuals were ≥18 years old, with ≥2 primary care visits, and complete race and ethnicity data who underwent Lp(a) testing. Race and ethnicity were self-reported and categorized as follows: non-Hispanic (NH) White, NH-Black, Hispanic (Mexican, Puerto Rican, other), NH-Asian (Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, other). Logistic regression models tested associations between elevated Lp(a) (≥50 mg/dL) and race, ethnicity, and ASCVD risk.13,689 (0.9%) individuals underwent Lp(a) testing with a mean age of 54.6 ± 13.8 years, 49% female, 28.8% NH Asian. Over one-third of those tested had Lp(a) levels ≥50 mg/dL, ranging from 30.7% of Mexican patients to 62.6% of NH-Black patients. The ASCVD risk of those tested varied by race: 73.6% of Asian Indian individuals had <5% 10-year risk, whereas 27.2% of NH-Black had established ASCVD. Lp(a) prevalence ≥50 mg/dL increased across the ASCVD risk spectrum. After adjustment, Hispanic (OR: 0.76 [95% CI: 0.66-0.88]) and Asian (OR: 0.88 [95% CI: 0.81-0.96]) had lower odds of Lp(a) ≥50 mg/dL, whereas Black individuals had higher odds (OR: 2.46 [95% CI: 1.97-3.07]).Lp(a) testing is performed infrequently. Of those tested, Lp(a) levels were frequently elevated and differed significantly across disaggregated race and ethnicity groups. The prevalence of elevated Lp(a) increased with increasing ASCVD risk, with significant variation by race and ethnicity.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jacadv.2024.100940\n\nView details for PubMedID 38938854\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC11198068\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Delayed intervention for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is associated with higher mortality. The association of door-to-ECG (D2E) with clinical outcomes has not been directly explored in a contemporary US-based population. Methods: This was a three-year, 10-center, retrospective cohort study of ED-diagnosed patients with STEMI comparing mortality between those who received timely (<10 min) vs. untimely (>10 min) diagnostic ECG. Among survivors, we explored left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) dysfunction during the STEMI encounter and recovery upon post-discharge follow-up. Results: Mortality was lower among those who received a timely ECG where one-week mortality was 5% (21/420) vs. 10.2% (26/256) among those with untimely ECGs (p = 0.016), and in-hospital mortality was 6.0% (25/420) vs. 10.9% (28/256) (p = 0.028). Data to compare change in LVEF metrics were available in only 24% of patients during the STEMI encounter and 46.5% on discharge follow-up. Conclusions: D2E within 10 min may be associated with a 50% reduction in mortality among ED STEMI patients. LVEF dysfunction is the primary resultant morbidity among STEMI survivors but was infrequently assessed despite low LVEF being an indication for survival-improving therapy. It will be difficult to assess the impact of STEMI care interventions without more consistent LVEF assessment.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3390/jcm13092650\n\nView details for PubMedID 38731180\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC11084706\n\nAbstract\n\nISCHEMIA (International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness With Medical and Invasive Approaches) did not find an overall reduction in cardiovascular events with an initial invasive versus conservative management strategy in chronic coronary disease; however, there were conservative strategy participants who underwent invasive coronary angiography early postrandomization (within 6 months). Identifying factors associated with angiography in conservative strategy participants will inform clinical decision-making in patients with chronic coronary disease.Factors independently associated with angiography performed within 6 months of randomization were identified using Fine and Gray proportional subdistribution hazard models, including demographics, region of randomization, medical history, risk factor control, symptoms, ischemia severity, coronary anatomy based on protocol-mandated coronary computed tomography angiography, and medication use.Among 2591 conservative strategy participants, angiography within 6 months of randomization occurred in 8.7% (4.7% for a suspected primary end point event, 1.6% for persistent symptoms, and 2.6% due to protocol nonadherence) and was associated with the following baseline characteristics: enrollment in Europe versus Asia (hazard ratio [HR], 1.81 [95% CI, 1.14-2.86]), daily and weekly versus no angina (HR, 5.97 [95% CI, 2.78-12.86] and 2.63 [95% CI, 1.51-4.58], respectively), poor to fair versus good to excellent health status (HR, 2.02 [95% CI, 1.23-3.32]) assessed with Seattle Angina Questionnaire, and new/more frequent angina prerandomization (HR, 1.80 [95% CI, 1.34-2.40]). Baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol <70 mg/dL was associated with a lower risk of angiography (HR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.46-0.91) but not baseline ischemia severity nor the presence of multivessel or proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis >70% on coronary computed tomography angiography.Among ISCHEMIA participants randomized to the conservative strategy, angiography within 6 months of randomization was performed in <10% of patients. It was associated with frequent or increasing baseline angina and poor quality of life but not with objective markers of disease severity. Well-controlled baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was associated with a reduced likelihood of angiography. These findings point to the importance of a comprehensive assessment of symptoms and a review of guideline-directed medical therapy goals when deciding the initial treatment strategy for chronic coronary disease.URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT01471522.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1161/CIRCINTERVENTIONS.123.013435\n\nView details for PubMedID 38629312\n\nAbstract\n\nMost patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) fail to achieve guideline-directed low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals. Twice-yearly inclisiran lowers LDL-C by ∼50% when added to statins.To evaluate the effectiveness of an \"inclisiran first\" implementation strategy (adding inclisiran immediately upon failure to reach LDL-C <70 mg/dL despite receiving maximally tolerated statins) versus representative usual care in US patients with ASCVD.VICTORION-INITIATE, a prospective, pragmatically designed trial, randomized patients 1:1 to inclisiran (284 mg at Days 0, 90, and 270) plus usual care (lipid management at treating physician's discretion) versus usual care alone. Primary endpoints were percentage change in LDL-C from baseline and statin discontinuation rates.We randomized 450 patients (30.9% female, 12.4% Black, 15.3% Hispanic); mean baseline LDL-C 97.4 mg/dL. The \"inclisiran first\" strategy led to significantly greater reductions in LDL-C from baseline to Day 330 versus usual care (60.0% vs 7.0%; p<0.001). Statin discontinuation rates with \"inclisiran first\" (6.0%) were noninferior versus usual care (16.7%). More \"inclisiran first\" patients achieved LDL-C goals vs usual care (<70 mg/dL: 81.8% vs 22.2%; <55 mg/dL: 71.6% vs 8.9%; p<0.001). Treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) and serious TEAE rates compared similarly between treatment strategies (62.8% vs 53.7% and 11.5% vs 13.4%, respectively). Injection-site TEAEs and TEAEs causing treatment withdrawal occurred more commonly with \"inclisiran first\" than usual care (10.3% vs 0.0%, and 2.6% vs 0.5%, respectively).An \"inclisiran first\" implementation strategy led to greater LDL-C lowering compared with usual care without discouraging statin use or raising new safety concerns.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jacc.2024.03.382\n\nView details for PubMedID 38593947\n\nAbstract\n\nThere remain disparities by race and ethnicity in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Statins reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) and improve ASCVD outcomes. ASCVD treatment patterns across disaggregated race and ethnicity groups are incompletely understood. We aimed to evaluate statin use and LDL-c control for ASCVD by race and ethnicity.From an electronic health record (EHR)-based cohort from a multisite Northern California health system, we included adults with an ASCVD diagnosis from 2010 to 2021 and at least 2 primary care visits, stratified by race and ethnicity (Non-Hispanic White [NHW], Non-Hispanic Black [Black], Hispanic, and Asian). Hispanic (Mexican, Puerto Rican, Other) and Asian (Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Other) groups were disaggregated. Primary outcomes were 1-year post-ASCVD statin use (prescription) and LDL-c control (at least one value <70 mg/dL). Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were estimated using logistic regression.Of 133,158 patients, there were 89,944 NHW, 6,294 Black, 12,478 (9.4 %) Hispanic and 13,179 (9.9 %) Asian patients. At 1 year after incident ASCVD, there was suboptimal statin use (any statins <60 %, high-intensity <25 %) and LDL-c control (<30 %) across groups, with lowest proportions in Black patients for statin use (46.7 %, any statin) and LDL-c control (10.7 %, OR 0.89 (0.81-0.97), referent NHW). Disaggregation of Asian and Hispanic groups unmasked within-group heterogeneity.In patients with incident ASCVD, we describe suboptimal and heterogenous 1-year post-ASCVD guideline-directed statin use and 1-year post-ASCVD LDL-c control across disaggregated race and ethnicity groups. Findings may improve understanding of ASCVD treatment disparities and guide implementation.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ajpc.2024.100647\n\nView details for PubMedID 38525197\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10958062\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Women with chronic coronary disease are generally older than men and have more comorbidities but less atherosclerosis. We explored sex differences in revascularization, guideline-directed medical therapy, and outcomes among patients with chronic coronary disease with ischemia on stress testing, with and without invasive management.METHODS AND RESULTS: The ISCHEMIA (International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness with Medical and Invasive Approaches) trial randomized patients with moderate or severe ischemia to invasive management with angiography, revascularization, and guideline-directed medical therapy, or initial conservative management with guideline-directed medical therapy alone. We evaluated the primary outcome (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or hospitalization for unstable angina, heart failure, or resuscitated cardiac arrest) and other end points, by sex, in 1168 (22.6%) women and 4011 (77.4%) men. Invasive group catheterization rates were similar, with less revascularization among women (73.4% of invasive-assigned women revascularized versus 81.2% of invasive-assigned men; P<0.001). Women had less coronary artery disease: multivessel in 60.0% of invasive-assigned women and 74.8% of invasive-assigned men, and no ≥50% stenosis in 12.3% versus 4.5% (P<0.001). In the conservative group, 4-year catheterization rates were 26.3% of women versus 25.6% of men (P=0.72). Guideline-directed medical therapy use was lower among women with fewer risk factor goals attained. There were no sex differences in the primary outcome (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] for women versus men, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.77-1.13]; P=0.47) or the major secondary outcome of cardiovascular death/myocardial infarction (adjusted HR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.76-1.14]; P=0.49), with no significant sex-by-treatment-group interactions.CONCLUSIONS: Women had less extensive coronary artery disease and, therefore, lower revascularization rates in the invasive group. Despite lower risk factor goal attainment, women with chronic coronary disease experienced similar risk-adjusted outcomes to men in the ISCHEMIA trial.REGISTRATION: URL: http://wwwclinicaltrials.gov.

Their prevalence, especially in ambulatory populations, is under-studied and limited by few female participants and the use of short-duration (24-48 hour) monitoring.Report the prevalence of frequent PVCs and NSVT in a community-based population of women likely to undergo ECG screening using sequential patch monitoring.Participants from the Women's Health Initiative Strong and Healthy (WHISH) trial with no history of atrial fibrillation (AF) but 5-year predicted risk of incident AF ≥ 5% by CHARGE-AF score were randomly selected to undergo screening with 7-day ECG patch monitors at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Recordings were reviewed for PVCs and NSVT (> 5 beats); data was analyzed using multivariate regression models.There were 1,067 participants who underwent ECG screening at baseline, 866 at 6-months and 777 at 12-months. Frequent PVCs were found on at least one patch from 4.3% of participants and one or more episodes of NSVT was found in 12 (1.1%) women. PVC frequency directly correlated with CHARGE-AF score and NSVT on any patch. Detection of frequent PVCs increased with sequential monitoring.Among postmenopausal women at high risk for AF, frequent PVCs were relatively common (4.3%), and correlated with higher CHARGE-AF score. As strategies for AF screening continue to evolve, particularly in those individuals at high risk of AF, the prevalence of incidental ventricular arrhythmias is an important benchmark to guide clinical decision-making.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.hrthm.2024.02.040\n\nView details for PubMedID 38403238\n\nAbstract\n\nPatients undergoing autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) have a >2-fold risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD; heart failure, myocardial infarction, and stroke), compared to the general population. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is predictive of CVD in nononcology patients but is not as well studied in patients who underwent HCT and survivors of HCT.The objective of this study was to examine the association between CAC and CVD risk and outcomes after HCT in patients with lymphoma.This was a retrospective cohort study of 243 consecutive patients who underwent a first autologous HCT for lymphoma between 2009 and 2014. CAC (Agatston score) was determined from chest computed tomography obtained <60 days from HCT. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to calculate hazard ratio (HR) estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for covariates (age, conventional risk factors [e.g., hypertension and dyslipidemia], and cancer treatment).The median age at HCT was 55.7 years (range, 18.5-75.1 years), 59% were male, and 60% were non-Hispanic White. The prevalence of CAC was 37%. The 5-year CVD incidence for the cohort was 12%, and there was an incremental increase in the incidence according to CAC score: 0 (6%), 1-100 (20%), and >100 (32%) (p = .001). CAC was significantly associated with CVD risk (HR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.2-7.5) and worse 5-year survival (77% vs. 50%; p < .001; HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.4), compared to those without CAC.CAC is independently associated with CVD and survival after HCT. This highlights the importance of integrating readily available imaging information in risk stratification and decision-making in patients undergoing HCT, which sets the stage for strategies to optimize outcomes after HCT.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/cncr.35252\n\nView details for PubMedID 38358333\n\nAbstract\n\nThere are several studies that have analyzed disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) health using a variety of different administrative databases; however, a unified analysis of major databases does not exist. In this analysis of multiple publicly available datasets, we sought to examine racial and ethnic disparities in different aspects of CVD, CVD-related risk factors, CVD-related morbidity and mortality, and CVD trainee representation in the US.We used National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, National Inpatient Sample, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-Ranging OnLine Data for Epidemiologic Research, United Network for Organ Sharing, and American Commission for Graduate Medical Education data to evaluate CVD-related disparities among Non-Hispanic (NH) White, NH Black and Hispanic populations.The prevalence of most CVDs and associated risk factors was higher in NH Black adults compared to NH White adults, except for dyslipidemia and ischemic heart disease (IHD). Statins were underutilized in IHD in NH Black and Hispanic patients. Hospitalizations for HF and stroke were higher among Black patients compared to White patients. All-cause, CVD, heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, IHD, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and cerebrovascular disease related mortality was highest in NH Black or African American individuals. The number of NH Black and Hispanic trainees in adult general CVD fellowship programs was disproportionately lower than NH White trainees.Racial disparities are pervasive across the spectrum of CVDs with NH Black adults at a significant disadvantage compared to NH White adults for most CVDs.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jnma.2024.01.022\n\nView details for PubMedID 38342731\n\nAbstract\n\nHigh blood pressure affects approximately 116 million adults in the United States. It is the leading risk factor for death and disability across the world. Unfortunately, over the past decade, hypertension control rates have decreased across the United States. Prediction models and clinical studies have shown that reducing clinician inertia alone is sufficient to reach the target of ≥80% blood pressure control. Digital health tools containing evidence-based algorithms that are able to reduce clinician inertia are a good fit for turning the tide in blood pressure control, but careful consideration should be taken in the design process to integrate digital health interventions into the clinical workflow.We describe the development of a provider-facing hypertension management platform. We enumerate key steps of the development process, including needs finding, clinical workflow analysis, treatment algorithm creation, platform design and electronic health record integration. We interviewed and surveyed 5 Stanford clinicians from primary care, cardiology, and their clinical care team members (including nurses, advanced practice providers, medical assistants) to identify needs and break down the steps of clinician workflow analysis. The application design and development stage were aided by a team of approximately 15 specialists in the fields of primary care, hypertension, bioinformatics, and software development.Digital monitoring holds immense potential for revolutionizing chronic disease management. Our team developed a hypertension management platform at an academic medical center to address some of the top barriers to adoption and achieving clinical outcomes. The frameworks and processes described in this article may be used for the development of a diverse range of digital health tools in the cardiovascular space.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1161/JAHA.123.030884\n\nView details for PubMedID 38226516\n\nAbstract\n\nHeart failure disproportionately affects individuals residing in rural areas, leading to worse health outcomes. Digital health interventions have been proposed as a promising approach for improving heart failure management. This systematic review aims to identify randomized trials of digital health interventions for individuals living in underserved rural areas with heart failure.We conducted a systematic review by searching 6 databases (CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed; 2000-2023). A total of 30 426 articles were identified and screened. Inclusion criteria consisted of digital health randomized trials that were conducted in underserved rural areas of the United States based on the US Census Bureau's classification. Two independent reviewers screened the studies using the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute tool to evaluate the risk of bias. The review included 5 trials from 6 US states, involving 870 participants (42.9% female). Each of the 5 studies employed telemedicine, 2 studies used remote monitoring, and 1 study used mobile health technology. The studies reported improvement in self-care behaviors in 4 trials, increased knowledge in 2, and decreased cardiovascular mortality in 1 study. However, 3 trials revealed no change or an increase in health care resource use, 2 showed no change in cardiac biomarkers, and 2 demonstrated an increase in anxiety.The results suggest that digital health interventions have the potential to enhance self-care and knowledge of patients with heart failure living in underserved rural areas. However, further research is necessary to evaluate their impact on clinical outcomes, biomarkers, and health care resource use.URL: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/; Unique identifier: CRD42022366923.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1161/JAHA.123.030956\n\nView details for PubMedID 38226517\n\nAbstract\n\nEffective shared decision-making (SDM) tools for use during clinical encounters are available, but, outside of study settings, little is known about clinician use of these tools in practice.To describe real-world use of an SDM encounter tool for statin prescribing, Statin Choice, embedded into the workflow of an electronic health record.Cross-sectional study.Clinicians and their statin-eligible patients who had outpatient encounters between January 2020 and June 2021 in Cleveland Clinic Health System.Clinician use of Statin Choice was recorded within the Epic record system. We categorized each patient's 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk into low (< 5%), borderline (5-7.5%), intermediate (7.5-20%), and high (≥ 20%). Other patient factors included age, sex, insurance, and race. We used mixed effects logistic regression to assess the odds of using Statin Choice for statin-eligible patients, accounting for clustering by clinician and site. We generated a residual intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) to characterize the impact of the clinician on Statin Choice use.Statin Choice was used in 7% of 68,505 eligible patients. Of 1047 clinicians, 48% used Statin Choice with ≥ 1 patient, and these clinicians used it with a median 9% of their patients (interquartile range: 3-22%). In the mixed effects logistic regression model, patient age (adjusted OR per year: 1.04; 95%CI 1.03-1.04) and 10-year ASVCD risk (aOR for 5-7.5% versus < 5% risk: 1.28; 95%CI: 1.14-1.44) were associated with use of Statin Choice. Black versus White race was associated with a lower odds of Statin Choice use (aOR: 0.83; 95%CI: 0.73-0.95), as was female versus male sex (aOR: 0.83; 95%CI: 0.76-0.90). The model ICC demonstrated that 53% of the variation in use of Statin Choice was clinician-driven.Patient factors, including race and sex, were associated with clinician use of Statin Choice; half the variation in use was attributable to individual clinicians.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s11606-023-08597-3\n\nView details for PubMedID 38191974\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: There are established sex-specific differences in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) outcomes. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) based on cardiovascular outcome benefits, typically either reduced cardiovascular mortality or hospitalization for heart failure (HHF), influence current guidelines for therapy.OBJECTIVES: The authors evaluate the representation of women in HFrEF RCTs that observed reduced all-cause or cardiovascular mortality or HHF.METHODS: We queried Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Excerpta Medica dataBASE, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, and PubMed for HFrEF RCTs that reported a statistically significant benefit of intervention resulting in improved mortality or HHF published from 1980 to 2021. We estimated representation using the participation-to-prevalence ratio (PPR). A PPR of 0.8 to 1.2 was considered representative.RESULTS: The final analysis included 33 RCTs. Women represented only 23.2% of all enrolled participants (n = 24,366/104,972), ranging from 11.4% to 40.1% per trial. Overall PPR was 0.58, with per-trial PPR estimates ranging from 0.29 to 1.00. Only 5 trials (15.2%) had a PPR of women representative of the disease population. Representation did not change significantly over time. The proportion of women in North American trials was significantly greater than trials conducted in Europe (P = 0.03). The proportion of women was greater in industry trials compared to government-funded trials (P = 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Women are underrepresented in HFrEF RCTs that have demonstrated mortality or HHF benefits and influence current guidelines. Representation is key to further delineation of sex-specific differences in major trial results. Sustained efforts are warranted to ensure equitable and appropriate inclusion of women in HFrEF trials.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jacadv.2023.100743\n\nView details for PubMedID 38405270\n\nAbstract\n\nCOVID-19 disrupted healthcare routines and prompted rapid telemedicine implementation. We investigated the drivers of visit modality selection (telemedicine versus in-person) in primary care clinics at an academic medical centre.We used electronic medical record data from March 2020 to May 2022 from 13 primary care clinics (N = 21,031 new, N = 207,292 return visits), with 55% overall telemedicine use. Hierarchical logistic regression and cross-validation methods were used to estimate the variation in visit modality explained by the patient, clinician and visit factors as measured by the mean-test area under the curve (AUC).There was significant variation in telemedicine use across clinicians (ranging from 0-100%) for the same visit diagnosis. The strongest predictors of telemedicine were the clinician seen for new visits (mean AUC of 0.79) and the primary visit diagnosis for return visits (0.77). Models based on all patient characteristics combined accounted for relatively little variation in modality selection, 0.54 for new and 0.58 for return visits, respectively. Amongst patient characteristics, males, patients over 65 years, Asians and patient's with non-English language preferences used less telemedicine; however, those using interpreter services used significantly more telemedicine.Clinician seen and primary visit diagnoses were the best predictors of visit modality. The distinction between new and return visits and the minimal impact of patient characteristics on visit modality highlights the complexity of clinical care and warrants research approaches that go beyond linear models to uncover the emergent causal effects of specific technology features mediated by tasks, people and organisations.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1177/1357633X231219311\n\nView details for PubMedID 38130140\n\nAbstract\n\nThe United States witnessed a nearly 4-fold increase in personal health care expenditures between 1980 and 2010. Despite innovations and obvious benefits to health, participants enrolled in clinical trials still do not accurately represent the racial and ethnic composition of patients nationally or globally. This lack of diversity in cohorts limits the generalizability and significance of results among all populations and has deep repercussions for patient equity. To advance diversity in clinical trials, robust evidence for the most effective strategies for recruitment of diverse participants is needed. A major limitation of previous literature on clinical trial diversity is the lack of control or comparator groups for different strategies. To date, interventions have focused primarily on (1) community-based interventions, (2) institutional practices, and (3) digital health systems. This review article outlines prior intervention strategies across these 3 categories and considers health policy and ethical incentives for substantiation before US Food and Drug Administration approval. There are no current studies that comprehensively compare these interventions against one another. The American Heart Association Strategically Focused Research Network on the Science of Diversity in Clinical Trials represents a multicenter, collaborative network between Stanford School of Medicine and Morehouse School of Medicine created to understand the barriers to diversity in clinical trials by contemporaneous head-to-head interventional strategies accessing digital, institutional, and community-based recruitment strategies to produce informed recruitment strategies targeted to improve underrepresented patient representation in clinical trials.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1161/JAHA.123.030042\n\nView details for PubMedID 38108253\n\nAbstract\n\nDespite efforts to improve the quality of care for patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), it is unclear whether the US has made progress in reducing racial and ethnic differences in utilization of guideline-recommended therapies for secondary prevention.To evaluate 21-year trends in racial and ethnic differences in utilization of guideline-recommended pharmacological medications and lifestyle modifications among US adults with ASCVD.This cross-sectional study includes data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 1999 and 2020. Eligible participants were adults aged 18 years or older with a history of ASCVD. Data were analyzed between March 2022 and May 2023.Self-reported race and ethnicity.Rates and racial and ethnic differences in the use of guideline-recommended pharmacological medications and lifestyle modifications.The study included 5218 adults with a history of ASCVD (mean [SD] age, 65.5 [13.2] years, 2148 women [weighted average, 44.2%]), among whom 1170 (11.6%) were Black, 930 (7.7%) were Hispanic or Latino, and 3118 (80.7%) were White in the weighted sample. Between 1999 and 2020, there was a significant increase in total cholesterol control and statin use in all racial and ethnic subgroups, and in angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) utilization in non-Hispanic White individuals and Hispanic and Latino individuals (Hispanic and Latino individuals: 17.12 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.37-37.88 percentage points; P = .046; non-Hispanic White individuals: 12.14 percentage points; 95% CI, 6.08-18.20 percentage points; P < .001), as well as smoking cessation within the Hispanic and Latino population (-27.13 percentage points; 95% CI, -43.14 to -11.12 percentage points; P = .002). During the same period, the difference in smoking cessation between Hispanic and Latino individuals and White individuals was reduced (-24.85 percentage points; 95% CI, -38.19 to -11.51 percentage points; P < .001), but racial and ethnic differences for other metrics did not change significantly. Notably, substantial gaps persisted between current care and optimal care throughout the 2 decades of data analyzed. In the period of 2017 to 2020, optimal regimens were observed in 47.4% (95% CI, 39.3%-55.4%), 48.7% (95% CI, 36.7%-60.6%), and 53.0% (95% CI, 45.6%-60.4%) of Black, Hispanic and Latino, and White individuals, respectively.In this cross-sectional study of US adults with ASCVD, significant disparities persisted between current care and optimal care, surpassing any differences observed among demographic groups. These findings highlight the critical need for sustained efforts to bridge these gaps and achieve better outcomes for all patients, regardless of their racial and ethnic backgrounds.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.45964\n\nView details for PubMedID 38039001\n\nAbstract\n\nStatins are the cornerstone for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease. Patients often consult online patient education materials (OPEMs) to inform medical decision-making. We therefore aimed to assess the readability and reliability of OPEMs related to statins.A total of 17 statin-related terms were queried using an online search engine to identify the top 20 search results for each statin-related term. Each OPEM was then grouped into the following categories based on 2 independent reviewers: government OPEMs (national, state, or local government agencies); healthcare/nonprofit OPEMs (major health systems and nonprofit organizations with a specific cardiovascular health focus); industry/commercial OPEMs (pharmaceutical manufacturers and online pharmacies); lay press OPEMs (healthcare-oriented news organizations); and dictionary/encyclopedia OPEMs. Grade-level readability for each OPEM was calculated using 5 standard readability metrics and compared with AMA-recommended readability recommendations. Reliability of each OPEM was evaluated using the JAMA benchmark criteria for online health information and certification from Health on the Net (HONCode).A total of 340 websites were identified across the 17 statin search terms. There were 211 statin OPEMs after excluding non-OPEM results; 172 OPEMs had unique content. Statin OPEM readability exceeded the recommended 6th grade AMA reading level (average reading grade level of 10.9). The average JAMA benchmark criteria score was 2.13 (on a scale of 0-4, with higher scores indicating higher reliability), and only 60% of statin OPEMs were HONCode-certified. There was an inverse association between readability and reliability. The most readable results were from industry and commercial sources, while the most reliable sites were from lay press sources.Statin OPEMs are written at an overall averaging reading grade level of 10.9. There was an inverse association between readability and reliability. Lack of accessible, high-quality online health information may contribute to statin nonadherence.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ajpc.2023.100594\n\nView details for PubMedID 37822580\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10562660\n\nAbstract\n\nWe assessed trends in novel cardiovascular medication utilization in US Veterans Affairs (VA) for angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI), sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 Inhibitors (SGLT2i), and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA).We retrospectively identified cohorts from 114 VA hospitals with admission for prevalent 1) systolic heart failure (HF, N=82,375) or 2) coronary artery disease and diabetes (CAD+T2D, N=74,209). Site-level data for prevalent filled prescriptions were assessed at hospital admission, discharge, or within 6 months of discharge. Variability among sites was estimated with median odds ratios (mOR), and within-site Pearson correlations of utilization of each medication class were calculated. Site- and patient-level characteristics were compared by high-, mixed-, and low-utilizing sites.ARNI and SGTL2i use for HF increased from <5% to 20% and 21% respectively, while SGTL2i or GLP-1 RA use for CAD+T2D increased from <5% to 30% from 2017-2021. Adjusted mOR and 95% confidence intervals for ARNI, SGTL2i for HF, and SGTL2i or GLP-1 RA for CAD+T2D were 1.73 (1.64-1.91), 1.72 (1.59-1.81), and 1.53 (1.45-1.62), respectively. Utilization of each medication class correlated poorly with use of other novel classes (Pearson <0.38 for all). Higher patient volume, number of beds, and hospital complexity correlated with high-utilizing sites.Utilization of novel medications has increased over time but remains suboptimal for US Veterans with HF and CAD+T2D, with substantial site-level heterogeneity despite a universal medication formulary and low out-of-pocket costs for patients. Future work should include further characterization of hospital- and clinician-level practice patterns to serve as targets to increase implementation.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ahj.2023.11.009\n\nView details for PubMedID 37956920\n\nAbstract\n\nIn this review, we present a comprehensive discussion on the population-level implications of digital health interventions (DHIs) to improve cardiovascular health (CVH) through sex- and gender-specific prevention strategies among women.Over the past 30 years, there have been significant advancements in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among men and women worldwide. However, women are often underdiagnosed, undertreated, and underrepresented in cardiovascular clinical trials, which all contribute to disparities within this population. One approach to address this is through DHIs, particularly among racial and ethnic minoritized groups. Implementation of telemedicine has shown promise in increasing adherence to healthcare visits, improving BP monitoring, weight control, physical activity, and the adoption of healthy behaviors. Furthermore, the use of mobile health applications facilitated by smart devices, wearables, and other eHealth (defined as electronically delivered health services) modalities has also promoted CVH among women in general, as well as during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Overall, utilizing a digital health approach for healthcare delivery, decentralized clinical trials, and incorporation into daily lifestyle activities has the potential to improve CVH among women by mitigating geographical, structural, and financial barriers to care.Leveraging digital technologies and strategies introduces novel methods to address sex- and gender-specific health and healthcare disparities and improve the quality of care provided to women. However, it is imperative to be mindful of the digital divide in specific populations, which may hinder accessibility to these novel technologies and inadvertently widen preexisting inequities.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s12170-023-00728-z\n\nView details for PubMedID 37868625\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10587029\n\nAbstract\n\nCoronary artery calcium (CAC) is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events across all racial and ethnic groups. CAC can be quantified on nonelectrocardiography (ECG)-gated computed tomography (CT) performed for other reasons, allowing for opportunistic screening for subclinical atherosclerosis.The authors investigated whether incidental CAC quantified on routine non-ECG-gated CTs using a deep-learning (DL) algorithm provided cardiovascular risk stratification beyond traditional risk prediction methods.Incidental CAC was quantified using a DL algorithm (DL-CAC) on non-ECG-gated chest CTs performed for routine care in all settings at a large academic medical center from 2014 to 2019. We measured the association between DL-CAC (0, 1-99, or ≥100) with all-cause death (primary outcome), and the secondary composite outcomes of death/myocardial infarction (MI)/stroke and death/MI/stroke/revascularization using Cox regression. We adjusted for age, sex, race, ethnicity, comorbidities, systolic blood pressure, lipid levels, smoking status, and antihypertensive use. Ten-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk was calculated using the pooled cohort equations.Of 5,678 adults without ASCVD (51% women, 18% Asian, 13% Hispanic/Latinx), 52% had DL-CAC >0. Those with DL-CAC ≥100 had an average 10-year ASCVD risk of 24%; yet, only 26% were on statins. After adjustment, patients with DL-CAC ≥100 had increased risk of death (HR: 1.51; 95% CI: 1.28-1.79), death/MI/stroke (HR: 1.57; 95% CI: 1.33-1.84), and death/MI/stroke/revascularization (HR: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.45-1.98) compared with DL-CAC = 0.Incidental CAC ≥100 was associated with an increased risk of all-cause death and adverse cardiovascular outcomes, beyond traditional risk factors. DL-CAC from routine non-ECG-gated CTs identifies patients at increased cardiovascular risk and holds promise as a tool for opportunistic screening to facilitate earlier intervention.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jacc.2023.06.040\n\nView details for PubMedID 37704309\n\nAbstract\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic accelerated adoption of telemedicine in cardiology clinics. Early in the pandemic, there were sociodemographic disparities in telemedicine use. It is unknown if these disparities persisted and whether they were associated with changes in the population of patients accessing care.We examined all adult cardiology visits at an academic and an affiliated community practice in Northern California from March 2019 to February 2020 (pre-COVID) and March 2020 to February 2021 (COVID). We compared patient sociodemographic characteristics between these periods. We used logistic regression to assess the association of patient/visit characteristics with visit modality (in-person vs telemedicine and video- vs phone-based telemedicine) during the COVID period.There were 54,948 pre-COVID and 58,940 COVID visits. Telemedicine use increased from <1% to 70.7% of visits (49.7% video, 21.0% phone) during the COVID period. Patient sociodemographic characteristics were similar during both periods. In adjusted analyses, visits for patients from some sociodemographic groups were less likely to be delivered by telemedicine, and when delivered by telemedicine, were less likely to be delivered by video versus phone. The observed disparities in the use of video-based telemedicine were greatest for patients aged ≥80 years (vs age <60, OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.21, 0.28), Black patients (vs non-Hispanic White, OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.56, 0.74), patients with limited English proficiency (vs English proficient, OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.46-0.59), and those on Medicaid (vs privately insured, OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.41-0.54).During the first year of the pandemic, the sociodemographic characteristics of patients receiving cardiovascular care remained stable, but the modality of care diverged across groups. There were differences in the use of telemedicine vs in-person care and most notably in the use of video- vs phone-based telemedicine. Future studies should examine barriers and outcomes in digital healthcare access across diverse patient groups.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ahj.2023.06.011\n\nView details for PubMedID 37369269\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10290766\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Statins are the cornerstone of treatment of patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Despite this, multiple studies have shown that women with ASCVD are less likely to be prescribed statins than men. The objective of this study was to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to elucidate factors contributing to this disparity.Methods: Our cohort included adult patients with two or more encounters between 2014 and 2021 with an ASCVD diagnosis within a multisite electronic health record (EHR) in Northern California. After reviewing structured EHR prescription data, we used a benchmark deep learning NLP approach, Clinical Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), to identify and interpret discussions of statin prescriptions documented in clinical notes. Clinical BERT was evaluated against expert clinician review in 20% test sets.Results: There were 88,913 patients with ASCVD (mean age 67.8±13.1 years) and 35,901 (40.4%) were women. Women with ASCVD were less likely to be prescribed statins compared with men (56.6%vs 67.6%, p <0.001), and, when prescribed, less likely to be prescribed guideline-directed high-intensity dosing (41.4%vs 49.8%, p <0.001). These disparities were more pronounced among younger patients, patients with private insurance, and those for whom English is their preferred language. Among those not prescribed statins, women were less likely than men to have statins mentioned in their clinical notes (16.9%vs 19.1%, p <0.001). Women were less likely than men to have statin use reported in clinical notes despite absence of recorded prescription (32.8%vs 42.6%, p <0.001). Women were slightly more likely than men to have statin intolerance documented in structured data or clinical notes (6.0%vs 5.3%, p=0.003).Conclusions: Women with ASCVD were less likely to be prescribed guideline-directed statins compared with men. NLP identified additional sex-based statin disparities and reasons for statin non-prescription in clinical notes of patients with ASCVD.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ajpc.2023.100496\n\nView details for PubMedID 37128554\n\nAbstract\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has evolved through multiple phases characterized by new viral variants, vaccine development, and changes in therapies. It is unknown whether rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor profiles and complications have changed over time.We analyzed the American Heart Association COVID-19 CVD registry, a national multicenter registry of hospitalized adults with active COVID-19 infection. The time period from April 2020 to December 2021 was divided into 3-month epochs, with March 2020 analyzed separately as a potential outlier. Participating centers varied over the study period. Trends in all-cause in-hospital mortality, CVD risk factors, and in-hospital CVD outcomes, including a composite primary outcome of cardiovascular death, cardiogenic shock, new heart failure, stroke, and myocardial infarction, were evaluated across time epochs. Risk-adjusted analyses were performed using generalized linear mixed-effects models.A total of 46 007 patient admissions from 134 hospitals were included (mean patient age 61.8 years, 53% male, 22% Black race). Patients admitted later in the pandemic were younger, more likely obese, and less likely to have existing CVD (Ptrend ≤0.001 for each). The incidence of the primary outcome increased from 7.0% in March 2020 to 9.8% in October to December 2021 (risk-adjusted Ptrend=0.006). This was driven by an increase in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction and stroke (Ptrend<0.0001 for each). The overall rate of in-hospital mortality was 14.2%, which declined over time (20.8% in March 2020 versus 10.8% in the last epoch; adjusted Ptrend<0.0001). When the analysis was restricted to July 2020 to December 2021, no temporal change in all-cause mortality was seen (adjusted Ptrend=0.63).Despite a shifting risk factor profile toward a younger population with lower rates of established CVD, the incidence of diagnosed cardiovascular complications of COVID increased from the onset of the pandemic through December 2021. All-cause mortality decreased during the initial months of the pandemic and thereafter remained consistently high through December 2021.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.122.009652\n\nView details for PubMedID 37017087\n\nAbstract\n\nDespite compelling evidence that statins are safe, are generally well tolerated, and reduce cardiovascular events, statins are underused even in patients with the highest risk. Social media may provide contemporary insights into public perceptions about statins.To characterize and classify public perceptions about statins that were gleaned from more than a decade of statin-related discussions on Reddit, a widely used social media platform.This qualitative study analyzed all statin-related discussions on the social media platform that were dated between January 1, 2009, and July 12, 2022. Statin- and cholesterol-focused communities, were identified to create a list of statin-related discussions. An artificial intelligence (AI) pipeline was developed to cluster these discussions into specific topics and overarching thematic groups. The pipeline consisted of a semisupervised natural language processing model (BERT [Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers]), a dimensionality reduction technique, and a clustering algorithm. The sentiment for each discussion was labeled as positive, neutral, or negative using a pretrained BERT model.Statin-related posts and comments containing the terms statin and cholesterol.Statin-related topics and thematic groups.A total of 10 233 unique statin-related discussions (961 posts and 9272 comments) from 5188 unique authors were identified. The number of statin-related discussions increased by a mean (SD) of 32.9% (41.1%) per year. A total of 100 discussion topics were identified and were classified into 6 overarching thematic groups: (1) ketogenic diets, diabetes, supplements, and statins; (2) statin adverse effects; (3) statin hesitancy; (4) clinical trial appraisals; (5) pharmaceutical industry bias and statins; and (6) red yeast rice and statins. The sentiment analysis revealed that most discussions had a neutral (66.6%) or negative (30.8%) sentiment.Results of this study demonstrated the potential of an AI approach to analyze large, contemporary, publicly available social media data and generate insights into public perceptions about statins. This information may help guide strategies for addressing barriers to statin use and adherence.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.9747\n\nView details for PubMedID 37093597\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground Statins are guideline-recommended medications that reduce cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes. Yet, statin use is concerningly low in this high-risk population. Identifying reasons for statin nonuse, which are typically described in unstructured electronic health record data, can inform targeted system interventions to improve statin use. We aimed to leverage a deep learning approach to identify reasons for statin nonuse in patients with diabetes. Methods and Results Adults with diabetes and no statin prescriptions were identified from a multiethnic, multisite Northern California electronic health record cohort from 2014 to 2020. We used a benchmark deep learning natural language processing approach (Clinical Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to identify statin nonuse and reasons for statin nonuse from unstructured electronic health record data. Performance was evaluated against expert clinician review from manual annotation of clinical notes and compared with other natural language processing approaches. Of 33 461 patients with diabetes (mean age 59±15 years, 49% women, 36% White patients, 24% Asian patients, and 15% Hispanic patients), 47% (15 580) had no statin prescriptions. From unstructured data, Clinical Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers accurately identified statin nonuse (area under receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] 0.99 [0.98-1.0]) and key patient (eg, side effects/contraindications), clinician (eg, guideline-discordant practice), and system reasons (eg, clinical inertia) for statin nonuse (AUC 0.90 [0.86-0.93]) and outperformed other natural language processing approaches. Reasons for nonuse varied by clinical and demographic characteristics, including race and ethnicity. Conclusions A deep learning algorithm identified statin nonuse and actionable reasons for statin nonuse in patients with diabetes. Findings may enable targeted interventions to improve guideline-directed statin use and be scaled to other evidence-based therapies.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1161/JAHA.122.028120\n\nView details for PubMedID 36974740\n\nAbstract\n\nAIMS: Ketone bodies (KB) are an important alternative metabolic fuel source for the myocardium. Experimental and human investigations suggest that KB may have protective effects in patients with heart failure. This study aimed to examine the association between KB and cardiovascular outcomes and mortality in an ethnically diverse population free from cardiovascular disease (CVD).METHODS AND RESULTS: This analysis included 6796 participants (mean age 62 ± 10 years, 53% women) from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Total KB was measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the association of total KB with cardiovascular outcomes. At a mean follow-up of 13.6 years, after adjusting for traditional CVD risk factors, increasing total KB was associated with a higher rate of hard CVD, defined as a composite of myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, stroke, and cardiovascular death, and all CVD (additionally included adjudicated angina) [hazard ratio, HR (95% confidence interval, CI): 1.54 (1.12-2.12) and 1.37 (1.04-1.80) per 10-fold increase in total KB, respectively]. Participants also experienced an 87% (95% CI: 1.17-2.97) increased rate of CVD mortality and an 81% (1.45-2.23) increased rate of all-cause mortality per 10-fold increase in total KB. Moreover, a higher rate of incident heart failure was observed with increasing total KB [1.68 (1.07-2.65), per 10-fold increase in total KB].CONCLUSION: The study found that elevated endogenous KB in a healthy community-based population is associated with a higher rate of CVD and mortality. Ketone bodies could serve as a potential biomarker for cardiovascular risk assessment.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/eurheartj/ehad087\n\nView details for PubMedID 36881667\n\nAbstract\n\nCurrent risk scores that are solely based on clinical factors have shown modest predictive ability for understanding of factors associated with gaps in real-world prescription of oral anticoagulation (OAC) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).In this study, we sought to identify the role of social and geographic determinants, beyond clinical factors associated with variation in OAC prescriptions using a large national registry of ambulatory patients with AF.Between January 2017 and June 2018, we identified patients with AF from the American College of Cardiology PINNACLE (Practice Innovation and Clinical Excellence) Registry. We examined associations between patient and site-of-care factors and prescription of OAC across U.S. counties. Several machine learning (ML) methods were used to identify factors associated with OAC prescription.Among 864,339 patients with AF, 586,560 (68%) were prescribed OAC. County OAC prescription rates ranged from 26.8% to 93%, with higher OAC use in the Western United States. Supervised ML analysis in predicting likelihood of OAC prescriptions and identified a rank order of patient features associated with OAC prescription. In the ML models, in addition to clinical factors, medication use (aspirin, antihypertensives, antiarrhythmic agents, lipid modifying agents), and age, household income, clinic size, and U.S. region were among the most important predictors of an OAC prescription.In a contemporary, national cohort of patients with AF underuse of OAC remains high, with notable geographic variation. Our results demonstrated the role of several important demographic and socioeconomic factors in underutilization of OAC in patients with AF.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.hroo.2022.11.004\n\nView details for PubMedID 36993910\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10041076\n\nAbstract\n\nINTRODUCTION: Diverse race and ethnicity representation remains lacking in science and technology (S&T) careers in the United States (US). Due to systematic barriers across S&T training stages, there may be sequential loss of diverse representation leading to low representation, often conceptualized as a leaky pipeline. We aimed to quantify the contemporary leaky pipeline of S&T training in the US.METHODS: We analyzed US S&T degree data, stratified by sex and then by race or ethnicity, obtained from survey data the National Science Foundation and the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics. We assessed changes in race and ethnicity representation in 2019 at two major S&T transition points: bachelor to doctorate degrees (2003-2019) and doctorate degrees to postdoctoral positions (2010-2019). We quantified representation changes at each point as the ratio of representation in the later stage to earlier stage (representation ratio [RR]). We assessed secular trends in the representation ratio through univariate linear regression.RESULTS: For 2019, the survey data included for bachelor degrees, 12,714,921 men and 10.612,879 women; for doctorate degrees 14,259 men and 12,860 women; and for postdoctoral data, 11,361 men and 8.672 women. In 2019, we observed that Black, Asian, and Hispanic women had comparable loss of representation among women in the bachelor to doctorate transition (RR 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.81-0.92; RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.81-0.89; and RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.77-0.87, respectively), while among men, Black and Asian men had the greatest loss of representation (Black men RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.66-0.78; Asian men RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.70-0.77)]. We observed that Black men (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.51-0.69) and Black women (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.49-0.63) experienced the greatest loss of representation among men and women, respectively, in the doctorate to postdoctoral transition. Black women had a statistically significant decrease in their representation ratio in the doctorate to postdoctoral transition from 2010 to 2019 (p-trend = 0.02).CONCLUSION: We quantified diverse race and ethnicity representation in contemporary US S&T training and found that Black men and women experienced the most consistent loss in representation across the S&T training pipeline. Findings should spur efforts to mitigate the structural racism and systemic barriers underpinning such disparities.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0284945\n\nView details for PubMedID 37099545\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Cardiovascular disease continues to be the leading cause of death globally. Clinical practice guidelines aimed at improving disease management and positively impacting major cardiac adverse events recommend genetic testing for inherited cardiovascular conditions such as dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), long QT syndrome (LQTS), hereditary amyloidosis, and familial hypercholesterolemia (FH); however, little is known about how consistently practitioners order genetic testing for these conditions in routine clinical practice. This study aimed to assess the adoption of guideline-directed genetic testing for patients diagnosed with DCM, HCM, LQTS, hereditary amyloidosis, or FH.Methods: This retrospective cohort study captured real-world evidence of genetic testing from ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes, procedure codes, and structured text fields of de-identified patient records in the Veradigm Health Insights Ambulatory EHR Research Database linked with insurance claims data. Data analysis was conducted using an automated electronic health record analysis engine. Patient records in the Veradigm database were sourced from more than 250,000 clinicians serving over 170 million patients in outpatient primary care and specialty practice settings in the United States and linked insurance claims data from public and private insurance providers. The primary outcome measure was evidence of genetic testing within six months of condition diagnosis.Results: Between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2021, 224,641 patients were newly diagnosed with DCM, HCM, LQTS, hereditary amyloidosis, or FH and included in this study. Substantial genetic testing care gaps were identified. Only a small percentage of patients newly diagnosed with DCM (827/101,919; 0.8%), HCM (253/15,507; 1.6%), LQTS (650/56,539; 1.2%), hereditary amyloidosis (62/1,026; 6.0%), or FH (718/49,650; 1.5%) received genetic testing.Conclusions: Genetic testing is underutilized across multiple inherited cardiovascular conditions. This real-world data analysis provides insights into the delivery of genomic healthcare in the United States and suggests genetic testing guidelines are rarely followed in practice.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3389/fcvm.2023.1272433\n\nView details for PubMedID 37915745\n\nAbstract\n\nSodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists (GLP1a) have cardiovascular benefit, but adoption into clinical practice has been lagging. We aim to evaluate use of SGLT2i and GLP1a across socioeconomic strata (SES), medical risk as well as provider type.We conducted a retrospective cohort study of the prescription of SGLT2i or GLP1a within 12 months of clinic visit between January 1, 2018 and January 1, 2019 using de-identified claims data. The primary outcome was the composite of a medication fill of either an SGLT2i and/or GLP1a within 180 days of the index visit.Of the total cohort, 125,636 (15.8%) received either a GLP-1a or SGLT2i.The odds of prescription of either medication was 0.64 [p=0.006)] in patients with heart failure. Patients who identified as Black, Hispanic or Asian had lower odds of the primary outcome [Black: (AOR 0.81, p<0.000); Hispanic: (AOR 0.87, p<0.000); Asian: (AOR 0.83, p<0.000). The odds was higher for those treated by an endocrinologist versus primary care clinician [AOR 2.12, p<0.000)].Prescriptionof SGLT2i or GLP1a was lower among patients with cardiovascular co-morbidities and those who identified as Black, Hispanic or Asian. Further efforts to minimize these disparities should be pursued.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.diabres.2022.110233\n\nView details for PubMedID 36581144\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) can be identified on non-gated chest CTs, but this finding is not consistently incorporated into care. A deep learning algorithm enables opportunistic CAC screening of non-gated chest CTs. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of notifying clinicians and patients of incidental CAC on statin initiation.METHODS: NOTIFY-1 was a randomized quality improvement project in the Stanford healthcare system. Patients without known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or prior statin prescription were screened for CAC on a prior non-gated chest CT from 2014-2019 using a validated deep learning algorithm with radiologist confirmation. Patients with incidental CAC were randomized to notification of the primary care clinician and patient versus usual care. Notification included a patient-specific image of CAC and guideline recommendations regarding statin use. The primary outcome was statin prescription within 6 months.RESULTS: Among 2,113 patients who met initial clinical inclusion criteria, CAC was identified by the algorithm in 424 patients. After additional exclusions following chart review, a radiologist confirmed CAC among 173 of 194 patients (89.2%) who were randomized to notification or usual care. At 6 months, the statin prescription rate was 51.2% (44/86) in the notification arm versus 6.9% (6/87) with usual care (p<0.001). There was also more coronary artery disease testing in the notification arm (15.1% [13/86] vs. 2.3% [2/87], p=0.008).CONCLUSIONS: Opportunistic CAC screening of prior non-gated chest CTs followed by clinician and patient notification led to a significant increase in statin prescriptions. Further research is needed to determine whether this approach can reduce ASCVD events.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.062746\n\nView details for PubMedID 36342823\n\nAbstract\n\nOral anticoagulation (OAC) is underprescribed in underrepresented racial and ethnic group individuals with atrial fibrillation (AF). Little is known of how differential OAC prescribing relates to inequities in AF outcomes.To compare OAC use at discharge and AF-related outcomes by race and ethnicity in the Get With The Guidelines-Atrial Fibrillation (GWTG-AFIB) registry.This retrospective cohort analysis used data from the GWTG-AFIB registry, a national quality improvement initiative for hospitalized patients with AF. All registry patients hospitalized with AF from 2014 to 2020 were included in the study. Data were analyzed from November 2021 to July 2022.Self-reported race and ethnicity assessed in GWTG-AFIB registry.The primary outcome was prescription of direct-acting OAC (DOAC) or warfarin at discharge. Secondary outcomes included cumulative 1-year incidence of ischemic stroke, major bleeding, and mortality postdischarge. Outcomes adjusted for patient demographic, clinical, and socioeconomic characteristics as well as hospital factors.Among 69 553 patients hospitalized with AF from 159 sites between 2014 and 2020, 863 (1.2%) were Asian, 5062 (7.3%) were Black, 4058 (5.8%) were Hispanic, and 59 570 (85.6%) were White. Overall, 34 113 (49.1%) were women; the median (IQR) age was 72 (63-80) years, and the median (IQR) CHA2DS2-VASc score (calculated as congestive heart failure, hypertension, age 75 years and older, diabetes, stroke or transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, age 65 to 74 years, and sex category) was 4 (2-5). At discharge, 56 385 patients (81.1%) were prescribed OAC therapy, including 41 760 (74.1%) receiving DOAC. OAC prescription at discharge was lowest in Hispanic patients (3010 [74.2%]), followed by Black patients (3935 [77.7%]) Asian patients (691 [80.1%]), and White patients (48 749 [81.8%]). Black patients were less likely than White patients to be discharged while taking any anticoagulant (adjusted odds ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.68-0.84) and DOACs (adjusted odds ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.65-0.82). In 16 307 individuals with 1-year follow up data, bleeding risks (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.08; 95% CI, 1.53-2.83), stroke risks (aHR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.34-3.20), and mortality risks (aHR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.02-1.47) were higher in Black patients than White patients. Hispanic patients had higher stroke risk (aHR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.38-2.95) than White patients.In a national registry of hospitalized patients with AF, compared with White patients, Black patients were less likely to be discharged while taking anticoagulant therapy and DOACs in particular. Black and Hispanic patients had higher risk of stroke compared with White patients; Black patients had a higher risk of bleeding and mortality. There is an urgent need for interventions to achieve pharmacoequity in guideline-directed AF management to improve overall outcomes.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamacardio.2022.3704\n\nView details for PubMedID 36287545\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects around 6 million Americans. AF management involves pharmacologic therapy and/or interventional procedures to control rate and rhythm, as well as anticoagulation for stroke prevention. Different populations may respond differently to distinct management strategies. This review will describe disparities in rate and rhythm control and their impact on outcomes among women and historically underrepresented racial and/or ethnic groups.METHODS: This is a narrative review exploring the topic of sex and racial and/or ethnic disparities in rate and rhythm management of AF. We describe basic terminology, summarize AF epidemiology, discuss diversity in clinical research, and review landmark clinical trials.RESULTS: Despite having higher rates of traditional AF risk factors, Black and Hispanic adults have lower risk of AF than non-Hispanic White (NHW) patients, although those with AF experience more severe symptoms and report lower quality-of-life scores than NHW patients with AF. NHW patients receive antiarrhythmic drugs, cardioversions, and invasive therapies more frequently than Black and Hispanic patients. Women have lower rates of AF than men, but experience more severe symptoms, heart failure, stroke, and death after AF diagnosis. Women and people from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds are inadequately represented in AF trials; prevalence findings may be a result of underdetection.CONCLUSION: Race, ethnicity, and gender are social determinants of health that may impact the prevalence, evolution, and management of AF. This impact reflects differences in biology as well as disparities in treatment and representation in clinical trials.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s10840-022-01383-x\n\nView details for PubMedID 36224481\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: COVID-19 spurred rapid adoption and expansion of telemedicine. We investigated the factors driving visit modality (telemedicine vs. in-person) for outpatient visits at a large cardiovascular center.METHODS: We used electronic health record data from March 2020 to February 2021 from four cardiology subspecialties (general cardiology, electrophysiology, heart failure, and interventional cardiology) at a large academic health system in Northern California. There were 21,912 new and return visits with 69% delivered by telemedicine. We used hierarchical logistic regression and cross-validation methods to estimate the variation in visit modality explained by patient, clinician, and visit factors as measured by the mean area under the curve.RESULTS: Across all subspecialties, the clinician seen was the strongest predictor of telemedicine usage, while primary visit diagnosis was the next most predictive. In general cardiology, the model based on clinician seen had a mean area under the curve of 0.83, the model based on the primary diagnosis had a mean area under the curve of 0.69, and the model based on all patient characteristics combined had a mean area under the curve of 0.56. There was significant variation in telemedicine use across clinicians within each subspecialty, even for visits with the same primary visit diagnosis.CONCLUSION: Individual clinician practice patterns had the largest influence on visit modality across subspecialties in a large cardiovascular medicine practice, while primary diagnosis was less predictive, and patient characteristics even less so. Cardiovascular clinics should reduce variability in visit modality selection through standardized processes that integrate clinical factors and patient preference.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1177/1357633X221130288\n\nView details for PubMedID 36214200\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Elevated remnant-lipoprotein (RLP)-cholesterol (RLP-C) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) are each individually associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the interplay of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-derived RLP-C and hsCRP and their association with ASCVD in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA).METHODS: Lipoprotein particles were measured using NMR spectroscopic analysis at baseline. RLP-C includes very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Four groups were created as follows: Group 1: RLP-C ≤ median (≤29.14 mg/dL) and hsCRP < 2 mg/L; Group 2: RLP-C ≤ median and hsCRP≥ 2 mg/L; Group 3: RLP-C > median and hsCRP level < 2 mg/L; and Group 4: RLP-C > median and hsCRP level ≥ 2 mg/L. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the relationship between RLP-C and hsCRP with incident ASCVD.RESULTS: A total of 6,720 MESA participants (mean age 62.2 y, 53% female) with a median follow-up of 15.6 years were included. In the fully adjusted model, compared to those in the reference group (Group 1), participants in Group 2, Group 3, and Group 4 demonstrated a 20% (95% CI, -2%-48%), 18% (-4%-44%), and 43% (18%-76%) increased risk of incident ASCVD events, respectively (p<0.01). An additive and multiplicative interaction between RLP-C and hsCRP was not statistically significant.CONCLUSION: NMR-derived RLP-C and hsCRP showed a similar independent association with incident ASCVD. Notably, the combination of increased RLP-C and hsCRP was associated with an increased risk of future ASCVD events.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jacl.2022.09.005\n\nView details for PubMedID 36180367\n\nAbstract\n\nAtherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States. Elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a major causal risk factor for ASCVD. Current evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that lowering LDL-C reduces the risk of secondary cardiovascular events in patients with previous myocardial infarction or stroke. There is no lower limit for LDL-C: large, randomized studies and meta-analyses have found continuous benefit and no safety concerns in patients achieving LDL-C levels <25 mg/dL. As 'Time is plaque' in patients with ASCVD, early, sustained reductions in LDL-C are critical to slow or halt disease progression. However, despite use of lipid-lowering medications, <30% of patients with ASCVD achieve guideline-recommended reductions in LDL-C, resulting in a substantial societal burden of preventable cardiovascular events and early mortality. LDL-C goals are not met due to several factors: lipid-lowering therapy is not initiated and intensified as directed by clinical guidelines (clinical inertia); most patients do not adhere to prescribed medications; and high-risk patients are frequently denied access to add-on therapies by their insurance providers. Promoting patient and clinician education, multidisciplinary collaboration, and other interventions may help to overcome these barriers. Ultimately, achieving population-level guideline-recommended reductions in LDL-C will require a collaborative effort from patients, clinicians, relevant professional societies, drug manufacturers, and payers.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1080/00325481.2022.2117498\n\nView details for PubMedID 36004573\n\nAbstract\n\nImportance: High lipid concentrations are a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Little is known about how population-level lipid concentrations, as well as trends in lipid control, have changed over the past decade among US adults.Objective: To determine whether lipid concentrations and rates of lipid control changed among US adults and whether these trends differed by sex and race and ethnicity, from 2007 to 2018.Design, Setting, and Participants: Serial cross-sectional analysis of 33 040 US adults aged 20 years or older, weighted to be nationally representative, from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (2007-2008 to 2017-2018).Main Outcomes and Measures: Lipid concentrations among US adults and rates of lipid control among adults receiving statin therapy. Lipid control was defined as a total cholesterol concentration of 200 mg/dL or less.Results: The mean age of the study population was 47.4 years, and 51.4% were women; of the 33 040 participants, 12.0% were non-Hispanic Black; 10.3%, Mexican American; 6.4%, other Hispanic American; 62.7%, non-Hispanic White; and 8.5%, other race and ethnicities (including non-Hispanic Asian. Among all US adults, age-adjusted total cholesterol improved significantly in the overall population from 197 mg/dL in 2007-2008 to 189 mg/dL in 2017-2018 (difference, -8.6 mg/dL [95% CI, -12.2 to -4.9 mg/dL]; P for trend <.001), with similar patterns for men and women. Black, Mexican American, other Hispanic, and White adults experienced significant improvements in total cholesterol, but no significant change was observed for Asian adults. Among adults receiving statin therapy, age-adjusted lipid control rates did not significantly change from 78.5% in 2007-2008 to 79.5% in 2017-2018 (difference, 1.1% [95% CI, -3.7% to 5.8%]; P for trend=.27), and these patterns were similar for men and women. Across all racial and ethnic groups, only Mexican Americans experienced a significant improvement in age-adjusted lipid control (P for trend=.008). In 2015-2018, age-adjusted rates of lipid control were significantly lower for women than for men (OR, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.40 to 0.72]). In addition, when compared with White adults, rates of lipid control while taking statins were significantly lower among Black adults (OR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.47 to 0.94]) and other Hispanic adults (OR, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.37 to 0.95]); no significant differences were observed for other racial and ethnic groups.Conclusions and Relevance: In this serial cross-sectional study, lipid concentrations improved in the US adult population from 2007-2008 through 2017-2018. These patterns were observed across all racial and ethnic subgroups, with the exception of non-Hispanic Asian adults.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jama.2022.12567\n\nView details for PubMedID 35997731\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground Social and environmental factors play an important role in the rising health care burden of cardiovascular disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention developed the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) from US census data as a tool for public health officials to identify communities in need of support in the setting of a hazardous event. SVI (ranging from a least vulnerable score of 0 to a most vulnerable score of 1) ranks communities on 15 social factors including unemployment, minoritized groups status, and disability, and groups them under 4 broad themes: socioeconomic status, housing and transportation, minoritized groups, and household composition. We sought to assess the association of SVI with self-reported prevalent cardiovascular comorbidities and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Methods and Results We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of adults (≥18years) in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2016 to 2019. Data regarding self-reported prevalent cardiovascular comorbidities (including diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, substance use), and ASCVD was captured using participants' response to a structured telephonic interview. We divided states on the basis of the tertile of SVI (first-participant lives in the least vulnerable group of states, 0-0.32; to third-participant lives in the most vulnerable group of states, 0.54-1.0). Multivariable logistic regression models adjusting for age, race and ethnicity, sex, employment, income, health care coverage, and association with federal poverty line were constructed to assess the association of SVI with cardiovascular comorbidities. Our study sample consisted of 1745999 participants ≥18years of age. States in the highest (third) tertile of social vulnerability had predominantly Black and Hispanic adults, lower levels of education, lower income, higher rates of unemployment, and higher rates of prevalent comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, hyperlipidemia, substance use, and ASCVD. In multivariable logistic regression models, individuals living in states in the third tertile of SVI had higher odds of having hypertension (odds ratio (OR), 1.14 [95% CI, 1.11-1.17]), diabetes (OR, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.09-1.15]), hyperlipidemia (OR, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.06-1.12]), chronic kidney disease (OR, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.12-1.23]), smoking (OR, 1.05 [95% CI, 1.03-1.07]), and ASCVD (OR, 1.15 [95% CI, 1.12-1.19]), compared with those living in the first tertile of SVI. Conclusions SVI varies across the US states and is associated with prevalent cardiovascular comorbidities and ASCVD, independent of age, race and ethnicity, sex, employment, income, and health care coverage. SVI may be a useful assessment tool for health policy makers and health systems researchers examining multilevel influences on cardiovascular-related health behaviors and identifying communities for targeted interventions pertaining to social determinants of health.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1161/JAHA.121.024414\n\nView details for PubMedID 35904206\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: We examined multi-dimensional clinical and laboratory data in participants with normoglycemia, prediabetes, and diabetes to identify characteristics of prediabetes and predictors of progression from prediabetes to diabetes or reversion to no diabetes.METHODS: The Project Baseline Health Study (PBHS) is a multi-site prospective cohort study of 2502 adults that conducted deep clinical phenotyping through imaging, laboratory tests, clinical assessments, medical history, personal devices, and surveys. Participants were classified by diabetes status (diabetes [DM], prediabetes [preDM], or no diabetes [noDM]) at each visit based on glucose, HbA1c, medications, and self-report. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to create factors that were compared across groups cross-sectionally using linear models. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with progression from preDM to DM and for reversion from preDM to noDM.RESULTS: At enrollment, 1605 participants had noDM; 544 had preDM; and 352 had DM. Over 4 years of follow-up, 52 participants with preDM developed DM and 153 participants reverted to noDM. PCA identified 33 factors composed of clusters of clinical variables; these were tested along with eight individual variables identified a priori as being of interest. Six PCA factors and six a priori variables significantly differed between noDM and both preDM and DM after false discovery rate adjustment for multiple comparisons (q<0.05). Of these, two factors (one comprising glucose measures and one of anthropometry and physical function) demonstrated monotonic/graded relationships across the groups, as did three a priori variables: ASCVD risk, coronary artery calcium, and triglycerides (q<10-21 for all). Four factors were significantly different between preDM and noDM, but concordant or similar between DM and preDM: red blood cell indices (q=8*10-10), lung function (q=2*10-6), risks of chronic diseases (q=7*10-4), and cardiac function (q=0.001), along with a priori variables of diastolic function (q=1*10-10), sleep efficiency (q=9*10-6) and sleep time (q=6*10-5). Two factors were associated with progression from prediabetes to DM: anthropometry and physical function (OR [95% CI]: 0.6 [0.5, 0.9], q=0.04), and heart failure and c-reactive protein (OR [95% CI]: 1.4 [1.1, 1.7], q=0.02). The anthropometry and physical function factor was also associated with reversion from prediabetes to noDM: (OR [95% CI]: 1.9 [1.4, 2.7], q=0.02) along with a factor of white blood cell indices (OR [95% CI]: 0.6 [0.4, 0.8], q=0.02), and the a priori variables ASCVD risk score (OR [95% CI]: 0.7 [0.6, 0.9] for each 0.1 increase in ASCVD score, q=0.02) and triglycerides (OR [95% CI]: 0.9 [0.8, 1.0] for each 25mg/dl increase, q=0.05).CONCLUSIONS: PBHS participants with preDM demonstrated pathophysiologic changes in cardiac, pulmonary, and hematology measures and declines in physical function and sleep measures that precede DM; some changes predicted an increased risk of progression to DM. A factor with measures of anthropometry and physical function was the most important factor associated with progression to DM and reversion to noDM. Future studies may determine whether these changes elucidate pathways of progression to DM and related complications and whether they can be used to identify individuals at higher risk of progression to DM for targeted preventive interventions.

However, it is unknown whether hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from socially vulnerable communities experience higher rates of death and/or major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). Thus, we evaluated the association between county-level social vulnerability and in-hospital mortality and MACE in a national cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.METHODS: Our study population included patients with COVID-19 in the American Heart Association COVID-19 Cardiovascular Disease Registry across 107 US hospitals between January 14, 2020 to November 30, 2020. The Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), a composite measure of community vulnerability developed by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was used to classify the county-level social vulnerability of patients' place of residence. We fit a hierarchical logistic regression model with hospital-level random intercepts to evaluate the association of SVI with in-hospital mortality and MACE.RESULTS: Among 16939 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the registry, 5065 (29.9%) resided in the most vulnerable communities (highest national quartile of SVI). Compared with those in the lowest quartile of SVI, patients in the highest quartile were younger (age 60.2 versus 62.3 years) and more likely to be Black adults (36.7% versus 12.2%) and Medicaid-insured (31.1% versus 23.0%). After adjustment for demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity) and insurance status, the highest quartile of SVI (compared with the lowest) was associated with higher likelihood of in-hospital mortality (OR, 1.25 [1.03-1.53]; P=0.03) and MACE (OR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.05-1.50]; P=0.01). These findings were not attenuated after accounting for clinical comorbidities and acuity of illness on admission.CONCLUSIONS: Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 residing in more socially vulnerable communities experienced higher rates of in-hospital mortality and MACE, independent of race, ethnicity, and several clinical factors.

The association between left ventricular (LV) diastolic function and CAC was assessed using multidimensional network and multivariable-adjusted regression analyses. Multivariable analysis was conducted on continuous LV diastolic parameters and categorical classification of LVDD and adjusted for traditional cardiometabolic risk factors. LVDD was defined using reference limits from a low-risk reference group without established cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular risk factors or evidence of CAC, (n​=​560). We also classified LVDD using the American Society of Echocardiography recommendations.RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 51​±​17 years with 56.6% female and 62.6% non-Hispanic White. Overall, 38.1% had hypertension; 13.7% had diabetes; and 39.9% had CAC >0. An intertwined network was observed between diastolic parameters, CAC score, age, LV mass index, and pulse pressure. In the multivariable-adjusted analysis, e', E/e', and LV mass index were independently associated with CAC after adjustment for traditional risk factors. For both e' and E/e', the effect size and statistical significance were higher across increasing CAC tertiles. Other independent correlates of e' and E/e' included age, female sex, Black race, height, weight, pulse pressure, hemoglobin A1C, and HDL cholesterol. The independent association with CAC was confirmed using categorical analysis of LVDD, which occurred in 554 participants (26.6%) using population-derived thresholds.CONCLUSION: In the PBHS study, the subclinical coronary atherosclerotic disease burden detected using CAC scoring was independently associated with diastolic function.CLINICALTRIALS: GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT03154346.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jcct.2022.06.003\n\nView details for PubMedID 35872137\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Systemic progress in improving trial representation is uncertain, and previous analyses of minority trial participation have been limited to small cohorts with limited exploration of driving factors.Methods: We analyzed detailed trial records from all US clinical trials registered in ClinicalTrials.gov from March 2000 to March 2020. Minority enrollment was compared to 2010 US Census demographic estimates using Wilcoxon test. We utilized logistic regression and generalized linear regression with a logit link to assess the association of possible drivers (including trials' funding source, size, phase, and design) with trials' disclosure of and amount of minority enrollment respectively.Findings: Among 20,692 US-based trials with reported results (representing ~4·76 million enrollees), only 43% (8,871/20,692) reported any race/ethnicity data. The majority of enrollees were White (median 79·7%; interquartile range [IQR] 61·9-90·0%), followed by Black (10·0%; IQR 2·5-23·5%), Hispanic/Latino (6·0%; IQR 0·43-15·4%), Asian (1·0%; IQR 0·0-4·1%), and American Indian (0·0%; IQR 0·0-0·2%). Median combined enrollment of minority race/ethnicity groups (Black, Hispanic/Latino, Asian, American Indian, Other/Multi) was below census estimates (27·6%) (p<0·001) however increased at an annual rate of 1·7%. Industry and Academic funding were negatively associated with race/ethnicity reporting (Industry adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 0·42, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0·38 to 0·46, p<0.0001; Academic aOR: 0·45, CI: 0·41 to 0·50, p<0.0001). Industry also had a negative association with the proportion of minority ethnicity enrollees (aOR: 0·69, CI: 0·60 to 0·79) compared to US Government-funded trials.Interpretation: Over the past two decades, the majority of US trials in ClinicalTrials.gov do not report race/ethnicity enrollment data, and minorities are underrepresented in trials with modest improvement over time.Funding: Stanford Medical Scholars Research Funding, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH (1K01HL144607) and the American Heart Association/Robert Wood Johnson Medical Faculty Development Program.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.lana.2022.100252\n\nView details for PubMedID 35875251\n\nAbstract\n\nPurpose of Review: This review summarizes contemporary data on unique cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in Hispanic individuals in the USA, and how addressing these factors is important in addressing health equity.Recent Findings: Recent studies have shown high rates of traditional CVD risk factors in Hispanic individuals such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and emerging CVD risk factors like hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, psychological stress, and occupational exposures. However, most studies fail to consider the significant heterogeneity in risk factor burden and outcomes in atherosclerotic CVD by Hispanic subgroup. Heart failure and rhythm disorders are less well studied in Hispanic adults, making risk assessment for these conditions difficult. High levels of CVD risk factors in Hispanic youth given an aging Hispanic population overall highlight the importance of risk mitigation among these individuals.Summary: In brief, these data highlight the significant, unique burden of CVD risk among Hispanic individuals in the USA and predict a rising burden of disease among this growing and aging population. Future CVD research should focus on including robust, diverse Hispanic cohorts as well as specifically delineating results for disaggregated Hispanic groups across CVDs. This will allow for better risk assessment, prevention, and treatment decisions to promote health equity for Hispanic patients.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s12170-022-00692-0\n\nView details for PubMedID 35669678\n\nAbstract\n\nImportance: An increasing proportion of people in the US hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are younger than 55 years, with the largest increase in young women. Effective prevention requires an understanding of risk factors associated with risk of AMI in young women compared with men.Objectives: To assess the sex-specific associations of demographic, clinical, and psychosocial risk factors with first AMI among adults younger than 55 years, overall, and by AMI subtype.Design, Setting, and Participants: This study used a case-control design with 2264 patients with AMI, aged 18 to 55 years, from the VIRGO (Variation in Recovery: Role of Gender on Outcomes of Young AMI Patients) study and 2264 population-based controls matched for age, sex, and race and ethnicity from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2008 to 2012. Data were analyzed from April 2020 to November 2021.Exposures: A wide range of demographic, clinical, and psychosocial risk factors.Main Outcomes and Measures: Odds ratios (ORs) and population attributable fractions (PAF) for first AMI associated with demographic, clinical, and psychosocial risk factors.Results: Of the 4528 case patients and matched controls, 3122 (68.9%) were women, and the median (IQR) age was 48 (44-52) years. Seven risk factors (diabetes [OR, 3.59 (95% CI, 2.72-4.74) in women vs 1.76 (1.19-2.60) in men], depression [OR, 3.09 (95% CI, 2.37-4.04) in women vs 1.77 (1.15-2.73) in men], hypertension [OR, 2.87 (95% CI, 2.31-3.57) in women vs 2.19 (1.65-2.90) in men], current smoking [OR, 3.28 (95% CI, 2.65-4.07) in women vs 3.28 (2.65-4.07) in men], family history of premature myocardial infarction [OR, 1.48 (95% CI, 1.17-1.88) in women vs 2.42 (1.71-3.41) in men], low household income [OR, 1.79 (95% CI, 1.28-2.50) in women vs 1.35 (0.82-2.23) in men], hypercholesterolemia [OR, 1.02 (95% CI, 0.81-1.29) in women vs 2.16 (1.49-3.15) in men]) collectively accounted for the majority of the total risk of AMI in women (83.9%) and men (85.1%). There were significant sex differences in risk factor associations: hypertension, depression, diabetes, current smoking, and family history of diabetes had stronger associations with AMI in young women, whereas hypercholesterolemia had a stronger association in young men. Risk factor profiles varied by AMI subtype, and traditional cardiovascular risk factors had higher prevalence and stronger ORs for type 1 AMI compared with other AMI subtypes.Conclusions and Relevance: In this case-control study, 7 risk factors, many potentially modifiable, accounted for 85% of the risk of first AMI in young women and men.
