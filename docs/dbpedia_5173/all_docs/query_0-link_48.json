        "text": "The Institute for Social Research emerged during and after the end of World War II. Here it played a vital role in the emergence of social research in Norway:\n\nThe institute and the researchers from the early pioneering phase and up to the present have contributed to the rise of important research communities and organisations in Norway.\n\nThe idea for the Institute for Social Research originated in the circle around Arne Næss, Vilhelm Aubert, Erik Rinde and Stein Rokkan during and after World War II.\n\nDuring the war, Næss and Aubert worked together in the intelligence organisation XU. Right after the war, this group of enthusiastic young intellectuals was also instrumental in the recognition of sociology as a university subject.\n\nThe Institute for Social Research was established as a result of the networking that took place in the first few years after the war, and the fact that Erik Rinde and his father Sigurd provided a financial foundation for the institute. The Institute for Social Research was thus established on 9 February 1950.\n\nRead more about the institute history:\n\nBelow you will find some selected publications, all in Norwegian.
