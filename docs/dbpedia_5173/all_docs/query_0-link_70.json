See as a Danish example, Lis Sejr, ed., Retsj ælp i et lokalormaide (Århus: University of Arhus, 1977). Johnsen, Retten til 255–74, presents a general approach to and analysis of methodology questions in action research. Information in this paragraph and the next two paragraphs relies on these sources.Google Scholar\n\n24 BEW seem to perceive this part of the Troms Study as a way of measuring latent demand and conclude that it indicated “a disproportionately large, latent demand for legal advice in rural areas” (BEW at 185). They apparently missed the point. Legal needs studies carried out in urban settings do not substantiate their conclusion. Unmet legal needs seem in Norway to occur roughly with similar frequency in the city and the countryside, although the structure differs in many respects. Compare Eskeland & Finne, Rettshjelp, and Haugen & Vigerust, Rettshjelpbehovet (both cited in note 16), with Johnsen, Retten til (cited in note 3). The study tried to map the importance of rural-urban factors to delivery models by applying the Juss-Buss model in both settings.Google Scholar\n\n28 This has not always been the case. In his broad analysis of legal development in Norway, Aubert points to the sharp legal division, developed by the autocratic kings, that still persisted in the 19th century:.Google Scholar\n\nThere was separate legislation for cities and countryside about elections and local government, about schools, taxation, social assistance (the “poor” laws), fire insurance, communication, craft industries, trade, property in land and real estate. Hodne, who mentions these differences in his Economic History of Norway 1815–1970, points out that legal scholars have never seen any reason to even mention this legal dualism which in some areas has persisted up to the present time [Fritz Hodne, Norgges konomiske historie 30–34 (Oslo: Cappelen 1981)].Google Scholar"
