        "text": "See the video recording of the lecture.\n\nFacts and Values: A Processual View\n\nAbstract\n\nAfter briefly sketching the Kantian position on facts and values and its implementation in classical sociological theory, I develop an alternative position based on an ontology taking change as primary and stability as secondary. I first relate the fact/value distinction to the distinctions between past and future and between other and self. I then develop a notion of “facting” and “valuing” processes that operate on present experience to construe experience (respectively) in terms of facts (enduring, causally formed, definable, constraining) and values (objects of possible choice, modes of choosing, rules for choosing). Moral rules emerge as universalizing rules for governing (maintaining and/or changing) these processes in the light of current experience.\n\nAndrew Abbott is the Gustavus F. and Ann M. Swift Distinguished Service Professor. Abbott's major research interests lie in the sociology of occupations, professions, and work, the sociology of culture and knowledge, and social theory. Abbott also has longstanding interests in methods, heuristics, and the philosophy and practice of sociology.\n\nSome of his selected works are: The System of Professions (1988), Department and Discipline (1999), Chaos of Discipline (2000), Time Matters (2001), Methods of discovery (2004), Digital paper (2014) og Processual Sociology (2016). Han har også vært redaktør for Work and Occupations (1991-1994) og American Journal of Sociology (2000-2016).\n\nProgram:\n\nLecture Tuesday June 4, 13.15-15.00:\n\nAndrew Abbott: \"Facts and Values: A Processual View”\n\nPlace: Auditorium 1, Eilert Sundts Building, University of Oslo, Blindern.\n\nSeminar Wednesday June 5, 10.00-12.00:\n\nAndrew Abbott: \"Pervasions: The Large Impact of Small Things”\n\nPlace: Institute for Social Research, Munthesgt 31\n\nNB!
