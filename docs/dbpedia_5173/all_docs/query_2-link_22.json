We argue that these problems require serious methodological reflection, but that adequately addressing them is usually possible. Differences between disciplines may make interdisciplinary research difficult. The chapter begins with identifying the most important differences between disciplines; these concern conceptual frameworks, theoretical frameworks, methods, research objectives, problem awareness, research objects and disciplinary cultures. Then a core problem is identified; that of integrating the results of auxiliary disciplines into a doctrinal framework. We identify three activities or processes that are essential in this integration process: translation, transformation and incorporation. Another cluster of problems is that of practical issues such as time and resources. The final problem discussed in this chapter is how to cooperate with researchers from different disciplinary backgrounds.",
