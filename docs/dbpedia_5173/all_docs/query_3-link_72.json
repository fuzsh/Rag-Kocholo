This fails to recognise the conjunction of the emergence of the nation-state with European colonial expansion. In this talk, Bhambra sets out an alternative account of how the modern state might be understood by better understanding the varieties of empire and varieties of colonialism with which it is associated. She argues that colonialism is a distinctly modern phenomenon and, in turn, gives European overseas empires a character different from other empires. This difference rests, in large part, in the specificity of a political economy of colonialism that is often misidentified as a separate capitalist modernity.\n\nSeminar\n\nDecember 1st, 10.00–12.00\n\nInstitute for Social Research, Munthes gate 31\n\nThe Trouble with (Racial) Capitalism\n\nBiography\n\nGurminder K.
