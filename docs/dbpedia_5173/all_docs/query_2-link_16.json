As well as presenting frontline new research in the form of books, book chapters, and refereed research articles, the 2018 publications list includes contributions to works of reference, ‘popular’ publications prepared by subject experts for a ‘middlebrow’ readership and thus addressing an outreach/impact agenda, and book reviews in learned journals. Conference and seminar papers also form part of the 2018-2019 output. The intellectual spread of the work is broad, with emphases in areas as diverse as Greek philosophy, Latin literature, the history of late Antiquity, and classical reception studies; as in its teaching, so in its research the Department’s scope is extensive, especially when considered in relation to its size.\n\nTexts and Violence in the Roman World\n\nPublication highlights from 2018 include Texts and Violence in the Roman World, a Cambridge University Press volume co-edited by Professor David Scourfield and Professor Monica Gale of Trinity College Dublin. A collection of eleven papers by a distinguished team of mostly senior scholars from the UK, the USA, and Ireland, and featuring a very substantial introductory chapter by the editors, the book breaks new ground in examining the representation of violence in different contexts across a wide sweep of authors and genres, from the Roman comedy of Plautus in the late third/early second century BC to the martyrological poems in lyric metres by the Christian Prudentius in the early fifth century AD. Special attention is paid to the topical subjects of the relationship between artistic representations of violence and violence in the real world and between violence and violent rhetoric, with parallels drawn with contemporary culture and much reference made to film and film theory. Reviews in the two principal Classics review journals in English are overwhelmingly positive: K. Gervais (Classical Review 69.2 [2019], 441-4) comments, for example, that ‘a volume like this is long overdue - The volume offers fine generic, temporal and methodological variety, while remaining admirably integrated in its approach; indeed, the introduction and cross-references bind the volume together unusually well’ (441-2), and describes the content as ‘excellent’ no fewer than five times; M. Myers (Bryn Mawr Classical Review 2019.14.05), similarly, characterizes it as ‘an excellent book full of exciting contributions to the study of Roman literary violence [which] will prove invaluable to scholars working on any aspect of violence in the ancient world - The chapters are constantly thought-provoking’.\n\nPositive reviews were received in 2018 also of Michael Williams’s monograph, The Politics of Heresy in Ambrose of Milan: Community and Consensus in Late Antique Christianity (Cambridge University Press, 2017). B. Dunkle (Church History 87 [2018], 832-4) declares that ‘Williams’s Politics of Heresy is an impressive achievement - All future Ambrosian scholars and students of late antiquity will benefit from his careful, if reasonably speculative, account of the central “doctrinal” achievements of the Bishop of Milan’ (834). M. Chalmers, in Ancient Jew Review for 2018 (online publication), concludes his review of the book by saying: ‘Williams’ book confidently represents, therefore, more than a successful alternative reconstruction of Milanese matters in the time of Ambrose. It also embodies the potential of a rhetorically-focused approach for generating research questions and reflexive critiques of our readings of late antique Christian texts’.\n\nMore generally, members of the Department published in front-rank international journals such as Classical Receptions Journal (Oxford) and Historia: Zeitschrift für alte Geschichte (Stuttgart), and in edited volumes published by major academic presses such as Brill (Leiden) and Routledge (London).\n\nThe highlight of the Maynooth Classics Seminar in 2018-2019 was a special event jointly hosted by the Departments of Ancient Classics and Music and supported by the MU Arts and Humanities Institute, at which Professor Armand D’Angour (Oxford), a world-leading authority on ancient Greek music and its performance, spoke on ‘The Rediscovery of Ancient Greek Music’. In all, the Seminar met eight times during the year, to hear and discuss papers on topics ranging widely across Greek and Roman culture and the reception of classical Antiquity.\n\nBesides presenting conference and seminar papers, members of staff were also involved in conference planning and preparation. Dr Jonathan Davies established the basis and framework for a conference on the Flavian Empire to be held at MU in June 2020 (a grant from the MU Conference and Workshop fund has since been awarded), while Professor David Scourfield continued to play a leading role, as Chair of the Steering Committee, in the planning of a major international conference on the (classically educated) author E. M. Forster, to be held in Cambridge (King’s College and the Faculty of English) in April 2020. Professor Scourfield obtained a grant for this conference from the Modern Humanities Research Association (MHRA) in its competitive annual scheme; successful\n\nFaculty HigHligHts Faculty oF arts, celtic studies and PHilosoPHy\n\nbids for funding (from Cambridge and from the University of Manchester) were also made through other members of the Steering Committee.\n\nclassIcs now 2020 (communIty PartnershIP ProJect)\n\nThis is a major outreach/impact project in which the Department is collaborating with colleagues from TCD, UCD, and the Classical Association of Ireland–Teachers (CAIT), and with a professional arts consultant/producer. It will be realized in a festival of Classics which will be held in Dublin in the autumn of 2020 and which, through a range of events, will invite audiences to discover and engage with classical Antiquity as interpreted by contemporary writers, artists, and thinkers from Ireland and abroad. It is researchdriven. A series of planning meetings took place during 2018-2019, and continues.\n\nschool of celtIc studIes\n\nThe School of Celtic Studies encompasses Nua Ghaeilge (Modern Irish), Early Irish and Lárionad na Gaeilge (Centre for Irish Language Research, Teaching and Testing).\n\nearly IrIsh\n\nIn 2018-19, the Department of Early Irish continued to produce world-leading research in the language, literature, history and culture of pre-modern Ireland. The 5-year ChronHib project, funded by an ERC Consolidator Grant awarded to Professor David Stifter, continued its innovative study of the chronology of the Irish language, while the 2-year MIMNEC project, funded by an IRC Laureate Award for Dr Deborah Hayden, began its first year of research into the medical manuscripts of medieval Ireland. The number of PhD students and postdoctoral scholars in the Department continued to grow, and the Department consolidated its international reputation as a leading centre for the study of Early Irish.\n\nresearch grants\n\nThe IRC-funded MIMNEC project got underway in 2018-19, and the ERC-funded ChronHib project entered its fourth year. Members of staff associated with both projects received numerous other research awards: both Dr Fangzhe Qiu, a postdoc on the ChronHib project, received a Royal Irish Academy Charlemont Grant to fund a research visit to Uppsala University, as well as a NUI Early Career Grant to fund an international conference on the use of statistics in the study of historical corpus linguistics (which took place in October 2019). There was also internal funding success beyond these two flagship projects: the top-ranked applicant to the Faculty of Arts, Celtic Studies and Philosophy in 2018 for the John and Pat Hume Scholarships at Maynooth, Viktoriia Krivoshchekova, arrived from Russia to begin her research under the supervision of Dr Elizabeth Boyle in September 2018. The top-ranked applicant to the Faculty in the 2019 competition was Chelsey Collins (Mississippi University for Women), who was also applying to work with Dr Boyle. She began her doctoral studies in September 2019. Two other PhD students also received Hume Fees Waivers in the 2018 and 2019 competitions respectively and are now undertaking doctoral research in the Department, under the supervision of Professor David Stifter and Dr Deborah Hayden.\n\nPublIcatIons\n\nMembers of the Department of Early Irish continued to publish world-class research in a diverse range of publications, including international peer-reviewed journals, edited books, handbooks, textbooks and encyclopedias. Publications in the leading peerreviewed journals in the field include articles by Professor David Stifter in Ériu, by Dr Deborah Hayden and by Dr Elliott Lash in Keltische Forschungen, by Dr Elliott Lash in Transactions of the Philological Society, and by Dr Bernhard Bauer in Zeitschrift für celtische Philologie. Both Dr Boyle and Dr Hayden contributed important chapters on aspects of the ‘Book of Ballymote’ to the latest volume in the Royal Irish Academy’s series on medieval Irish manuscripts (Codices Hibernenses Eximii) which arises out of an ongoing collaboration between the RIA and the Maynooth University Department of Early Irish. Furthermore, three members of the department (Professor Stifter, Dr Hayden, and Dr Qiu) published pieces in a Festschrift for Australian colleague Professor Neil McLeod, reflecting longstanding collaborations with colleagues in Sydney, and Professor Stifter published a collaboratively-written article with Dr Aaron Griffith (Utrecht) and Professor Gregory Toner (QUB) in Kratylos. In addition to work by academic staff, postgraduate students and recent PhD graduates published work in a range of outlets, from the Canadian philosophy journal Dionysius (Dr Daniel Watson) to the Annual of Medieval Studies at the Central European University (Viktoriia Krivoshchekova), from the Dutch journal of Celtic Studies, Kelten (Lars Nooij) to the local Laois Heritage Society Journal (Ellen Ganly).\n\nA Little Remnant of the Work of the Ancients Conference organised with the RIA\n\nFaculty HigHligHts Faculty oF arts, celtic studies and PHilosoPHy\n\nconferences and InVIted lectures\n\nThe Department hosted, and collaboratively organised, several international conferences and workshops. Dr Boyle organised, in association with the RIA, the fourth Irish manuscripts conference, entitled “A Little Remnant of the Work of the Ancients”: 23 N 10 (The Book of Ballycummin) at the Royal Irish Academy in March 2019. Dr Hayden was chair of the organising committee of the Annual Colloquium of the Henry Sweet Society for the History of Linguistic Ideas, which was held in Maynooth in September 2018 – postdoctoral researchers from the Department were also on the organising committee of this conference, which drew 55 delegates from 15 different countries. Postdoctoral researchers of the ChronHib project, headed by Dr Lash, organised the 10th Celtic Linguistics Conference in Maynooth University in September 2018. In June 2019, Dr Hayden also co-organised a collaborative workshop, hosted at the University of Nottingham, on Medieval Manuscripts Meet Modern Science: A Workshop on Theory and Practice, which brought together laboratory scientists and medievalists to discuss innovative research practices in the study of medieval medicine.\n\nIn the 2018-19 academic year, Professor Stifter gave eight invited lectures in institutions such as Queen’s University Belfast and the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies. In particular, we would note the outstanding honour of his being invited to give the prestigious O’Donnell Lecture 2019 at the University of Oxford. Dr Hayden gave ten academic papers in 2018-19, at institutions including Harvard, Nottingham, QUB and the RIA. Dr Boyle gave five invited lectures, including most notably at “Invasion 1169: the National Conference on the Occasion of the 850th Anniversary of the Anglo-Norman Invasion of Ireland”, which was held at Trinity College Dublin. Our postdoctoral researchers also gave numerous prestigious research talks: Dr Qiu, for example, gave invited lectures at both the Beijing Foreign Studies University and Peking University, China. Other postdocs delivered papers in Germany, Cyprus, Spain and the UK, while postgraduate students gave papers at Harvard, UCC and the University of Bangor. Closer to home, Dr Boyle gave a joint paper with then-MA (now PhD) student Chelsey Collins at the Inaugural Symposium of the MU SexGen Network of Research on Gender and Sexualities on the subject of “Judgements on Categories of Sons” and the “Regulation of Sexual Behaviour in Early Medieval Ireland’.\n\nImPact and externally‑engaged research\n\nThe Department of Early Irish remains fiercely committed to publicfacing dissemination of our research findings. In 2018-19 this resulted in a very wide range of high-profile public engagement activities both in Ireland and abroad. In one particularly notable instance, the work of the IRC-funded MIMNEC project was projected onto the side of a building in central Dublin, as part of a light display for Science Week 2018. The research of the Department of Early Irish also featured prominently in the media, with Dr Hayden, Dr Stifter and Dr Qiu all being invited onto the Pat Kenny Show (Newstalk) to speak about medieval Irish studies and the modern Irish language. Dr Hayden also appeared on The Chatroom with Angel Faull (CRCfm 102.9 Castlebar), was interviewed by Jim Carroll (RTÉ) at the BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition in the RDS, and recorded a podcast as part of the ‘Cool Science and Curious Minds’ series on East Coast FM. Professor Stifter featured in an episode of the RTÉ-produced series John Creedon’s Atlas of Ireland in August 2019. While co-organising a major conference on the ‘Book of Ballycummin’, Dr Boyle was the subject of an article in the Irish Independent in February 2019, under the headline “Stories and Laws from 1,000 Years Ago Unearthed in Ancient Book” and she was also interviewed on Kfm radio on the same subject. Both Dr Boyle and Dr Hayden published pieces for RTÉ Brainstorm: Dr Boyle had two articles published on the site (one about a conference trip to Svalbard, in the Arctic Circle, which took place during the polar night; the other about the use of “Celtic” imagery in modern folk horror TV and film), while Dr Hayden published a widely-read piece on medieval Irish medicine, which is now available as a podcast. Dr Qiu, was invited to give an overview of Irish language and culture to the new Chinese Ambassador to Ireland at the Chinese Embassy in Dublin.\n\nother research contrIbutIons\n\nMembers of the Department of Early Irish continue to promote good academic citizenship within the discipline of Celtic Studies. This includes serving on editorial boards and the committees of learned societies, engaging extensively in peer reviewing and in organising training events and masterclasses for postgraduate students and postdocs. The Early Irish and Celtic Studies Research Seminar is well attended by scholars from Maynooth University as well as from other institutions in the greater Dublin area. Dr Boyle continued to serve on the editorial board of the Medieval Texts and Cultures of Northern Europe series (Brepols) and undertook extensive peer review for Amsterdam University Press (acting as reader for two monographs) and numerous academic journals. Dr Hayden continued her position on the editorial board of the Journal of Celtic Linguistics as well as joining the Research Committees of the MU Academic Council and MU Faculty of Arts, and served on the 2019 ad hoc committee of the International Congress of Celtic Studies in Bangor, Wales. In addition to his existing service positions, Professor Stifter joined the Scientific Council of Études celtiques in 2019 as well as the Board of Management of the Maynooth University Arts and Humanities Institute. Postgraduate student, Lars Nooij, became editor-in-chief of Kelten, the Celtic Studies quarterly published by the Stichting A. G. van Hamel voor Keltische Studies.\n\nThrough innovative, ethical and dynamic scholarship, demonstrated by extensive publication, research grants, conferences, workshops, public engagement and media work, Maynooth University Department of Early Irish continues to be the world’s leading centre for the interdisciplinary study of early medieval Irish language, literature and culture.\n\nFaculty HigHligHts Faculty oF arts, celtic studies and PHilosoPHy\n\nThe Department of Early Irish continued its fruitful collaboration with the Royal Irish Academy in co-organising the Medieval Irish Manuscripts Conferences – the 4th such conference took place in 2019 and the 2nd book to arise out of the series (The Book of Ballymote, ed. Ruairí Ó hUiginn) was published by the Royal Irish Academy. These conferences are widely attended by the public and the talks are made freely available online on SoundCloud.\n\nnua‑ghaeIlge\n\nOur new internally-funded research project on 'Scríobhaithe an Tuaiscirt 1650-1900' (Scribes of the North, 1650-1900) is the first stage of an ambitious long-term research project which will produce an Atlas Litríocht na Gaeilge (Atlas of Literature in Irish). This project will help to build a community of researchers and an enhanced research environment by providing a detailed scholarly geographical profile of literary production in Irish over a period of 1,500 years. Its initial output will be the publication of a large multi-authored volume entitled Atlas Litríocht na Gaeilge/ Atlas of Literature in Irish. The project will also have a very significant outreach element centered on an interactive website aimed at local councils/heritage bodies/schools and colleges with a view to increasing awareness and sharing knowledge and resources concerning regional and local literary heritage.\n\nWhere Maynooth-specific expertise is concerned, Atlas Litríocht na Gaeilge will draw on scholarship in key historical periods such as the Bardic tradition and Early Modern Irish prose literature (Dr Eoghan Ó Raghallaigh and Dr Lára Ní Mhaoláin) and on expertise in a number of regional areas such as the Kerry Gaeltacht (Dr Tracey Ní Mhaonaigh), the Aran Islands (Dr Brian Ó Catháin), Donegal and East Ulster (Professor Fionntán de Brún). Dr Brian Ó Catháin's research on dialectology will also inform the linguistic commentary throughout.\n\nDr Eoghan Ó Raghallaigh is joint editor of A Bardic miscellany: five hundred Bardic poems from manuscripts in Irish and British libraries (Dublin: Department of Irish, Trinity College, 2010) and has made numerous contributions to scholarship in the field of Bardic Poetry and Early Modern Irish. His co-edited Bardic miscellany forms the basis of a new Sketch Engine database which has been developed by TCD with his assistance. Dr Lára Ní Mhaoláin is completing an edition of the Ulster Cycle tale, Táin Bó Fliodhaise, for the prestigious Irish Texts' Society series. This is a much anticipated edition which will be a very significant contribution to study of the Ulster Cycle. Both Dr Ó Raghallaigh and Dr Ní Mhaoláin work closely with the Russell Library, integrating the teaching of MA modules on Early Modern Irish with visits to the collections. With the assistance of the Department of Nua-Ghaeilge, the Russell Library and Dr Brian Mac Maghnuis (Oifigeach na Gaeilge) recently curated an exhibition of manuscripts and a symposium in which staff and postgraduate students of Nua-Ghaeilge gave talks on specific manuscripts.\n\nFionntan de Brún's AHRC (UK) project 'Rethinking Revivalism: A Conceptual Case Study in Modern Irish Literature' was completed in March 2019 with the publication of his monograph (Cork University Press). The seminal contribution of this monograph to the study of Irish literature has been highlighted in recent reviews by Declan Kiberd (Irish Times), Maurice Earls (Dublin Review of Books) as well as by Philip O'Leary and Brian Ó Conchubhair in Cork University Press internal reviews www.corkuniversitypress.com/ Revivalism‑p/9781782053149.htm The reception of this book has strengthened the profile of literary studies in the Department and will provide a platform for subsequent funded research projects.\n\nAn tOllamh Fionntán de Brún\n\nlÉachtaÍ cholm cIlle and IrIsleabhar mhÁ nuad\n\nThe Department hosts an annual conference, Léachtaí Cholm Cille, which celebrated its 50th anniversary in April 2019. To mark this milestone the conference took as its theme Téamaí agus Tionscadail Taighde (Research themes and Projects), a stock-take of current research in Irish, beginning with a keynote address by Prof. Máirín Nic Eoin (DCU) on the progress of critical discourse in Irish over the past 50 years, 'Imeall nó Tairseach? Ionad agus Éifeacht Chritic Liteartha na Gaeilge le 50 Bliain Anuas'. The proceedings of the 2018 conference on the Ó Nualláin/O’Nolan family of writers was also launched at the event, Léachtaí Cholm Cille XLIX: Ón nGruagach Gréagach go Myles na gCopaleen: Saol agus Saothar Mhuintir Nualláin. The 2018 conference and subsequent proceedings launch was attended by some of the relatives of this renowned literary dynasty, the most famous of whom was undoubtedly Brian Ó Nualláin (Myles na gCopaleen/Flann O’Brien).\n\nAlong with the annual conference proceedings of Léachtaí Cholm Cille, the Department hosts one of the oldest Irish academic journals, Irisleabhar Mhá Nuad, initiated as the Record of the League of Columba in 1898 before assuming its present title in 1907. Under the editorship of Dr Tracey Ní Mhaonaigh, the journal has allowed younger scholars to share a platform with seasoned writers such as Msgr. Breandán Ó Doibhlin, who is credited with transforming literary criticism in Irish from the 1960s onwards. The 2018 and 2019 issues feature articles by Breandán Ó Doibhlin,\n\nFaculty HigHligHts Faculty oF arts, celtic studies and PHilosoPHy\n\nMícheál Mac Craith, Michelle O’Riordan, Ailbhe Ní Ghearbhuigh, Nollaig Ó Muraíle, Fionntán de Brún, and Pól Ó Muirí as well as creative writing by Eimear Ní Chairbre, Katie Ní Fhaoláin, Mairéad Ní Neachtain, Megan McAuley and Eoin P. Ó Murchú.\n\ncontrIbutIons to scholarly databases and web ProJects\n\nDuring 2018–19 Dr Eoghan Ó Raghallaigh continued his work on Bardic poetry, and was a guest speaker at several events including a lecture in May 2019 at the ‘Understanding Ireland’ series held at John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin, Poland. Dr Ó Raghallaigh’s ongoing collaborative work with other institutions includes the Bardic Poetry Database (bardic.celt.dias.ie) hosted at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, the Learn Early Modern Irish Project (www. leamh.org) based at the University of Connecticut, and the Royal Irish Academy’s Doegen Records Web Project (www.doegen.ie).\n\nlÁrIonad na gaeIlge: taIghde, teagasc agus tÁstÁIl/centre for IrIsh language research, teachIng and testIng\n\nFounded in 1971, Maynooth University Language Centre is now known as the Centre for Irish Language Research, Teaching and Testing. The Centre offers an innovative approach to the teaching of the Irish language on our courses for degree students, the wider university community, and adult learners both in the locality, nationally and internationally. It also provides training in the teaching of Irish to adults as well as online postgraduate courses in translation, and a variety of services and courses for distance and autonomous learners.\n\nAreas of research in the Centre include language testing, the Common European Framework of Reference of Languages: Learning, Teaching, Assessment (CEFR), multilingualism, language policies, corpus linguistics, gender studies, plant lore, sean-nós singing, applied linguistics, translation studies, terminology and contemporary French literature.\n\nRecognised both nationally and internationally as the leading Irish organisation for language test development, the Centre is three-times winner of the European Language Label for excellence and innovation in language teaching and the Irish member of the prestigious Association of Language Testers in Europe (ALTE). A major focus of the work of the Centre is the development of tests in Irish for adult learners (Teastas Eorpach na Gaeilge) which are administered in Ireland, Europe, North America and Australia. (www.teg.ie) The Centre also holds the ALTE Q-Mark which confirms that our exams, which have been audited by ALTE, adhere to ALTE’s 17 minimum standards governing test construction, administration and logistics, marking and grading, test analysis and communication with stakeholders.\n\noutPuts\n\nAs pioneers nationally in the development of tests linked to the CEFR, the Centre acts as advisor to state bodies on the CEFR and language testing and has been commissioned on several occasions to produce test-related research on aspects of Irish language learning.\n\nIn June 2019, the Centre invited Jane Lloyd of Cambridge Assessment, Cambridge University to deliver a four-part course on language testing. The course was attended by 23 colleagues, most of whom came from other Irish universities.\n\nIn keeping with the principal areas of research in the Centre, in June 2019, Dr Thomas Bak of the University of Edinburgh delivered a public lecture on the theme ‘Why our brains need languages: cognitive effects of language learning and multilingualism.’\n\nIn September 2019, Aoife Ní Ghloinn was invited as consultant to facilitate the review of Irish language curriculum and assessments in Notre Dame University, South Bend, Indiana.\n\nAoife Ní Ghloinn is pursuing doctoral research funded by An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaelscolaíochta agus Gaeltachta (COGG). The aim of the project is to build a grammatically annotated corpus of written and spoken TEG exams, in order to analyse the development of grammatical competence in Irish from B1-C1 levels of the CEFR. In a separate project (2016-20), she is investigating the alignment of undergraduate Irish exams with the CEFR.\n\nSailí Ní Dhroighneáin is conducting doctoral research on the traditional medicine practised in Ireland to cure animal diseases in the 18th to 20th centuries, primarily from folklore sources.\n\nDr Seán Mac Risteaird presented and published on sexuality in the work of Connemara author Micheál Ó Conghaile.\n\nAnne Gallagher\n\nAnna Ní Ghallachair published a chapter on the image of Ireland in modern French literature in Ireland in the European Eye (RIA, 2019) and\n\nFaculty HigHligHts Faculty oF arts, celtic studies and PHilosoPHy\n\non European language policies in a publication on Tandem Learning for an American readership (Taylor and Francis).

Oid. san Oideachas lán-Ghaeilge and the well-established PME (Primary Teaching). In total, 1,780 candidates registered for the tests, a 120% increase on the previous year’s candidature.\n\nIrIsh cultural herItage\n\nDr Mary Leenane is currently working on a book publication on the characterisation of Cú Chulainn, with emphasis on the notion of heroic biography and related themes. Some insights into her findings have been presented at various conferences and published in, for example, Ulidia 3 (2013) and Ulidia 5 (forthcoming).\n\nDr Leenane is also conducting research into representation of elite figures in early Irish literature. She was invited to deliver a keynote address on this work at the 41st Californian Celtic Conference (UC Berkeley); related aspects were also presented at the 33rd Conference of Irish Medievalists, University College Cork; the XVIth International Congress of Celtic Studies (Bangor University); and more recently at the 39th Harvard Celtic Colloquium (Harvard University). The latter paper is being prepared for submission for publication in the Proceedings of the Harvard Celtic Colloquium 39. (Dec 2019). An interdisciplinary assessment of brooches and mantles is also being prepared for publication.\n\nBuilding on her involvement in the Black Pig’s Dyke regional research project, Dr Leenane is also examining the various ways in which characters are affixed to specific places and landscapes with a view to providing a better understanding of the related narrative creation process. This research was presented at the Ulidia VIFíanaigecht III Conference in Sabhal Mòr Ostaig, Isle of Skye and is scheduled for inclusion in the conference proceedings. Dr Leenane is also currently working on early Irish death narratives, which work will be presented at conferences in 2020.\n\nThe Moynagh Lough project concerns the publication of this, nationally important, crannog excavation carried out by our late colleague John Bradley of the History Department, Maynooth University. The research is led by Dr Michael Potterton (of the same department) and Dr Eoin Grogan (Irish Cultural Heritage) has undertaken the research and reporting on the very extensive Bronze Age phases of the site. This year, substantial work has been completed on the ceramic component of the assemblage. This project is funded by the Royal Irish Academy with support from Maynooth University.\n\nThe study of the Bronze Age cemetery at Carrig, Co, Wicklow, funded by the National Museum of Ireland, is engaged in the publication of the rich funerary complex at Carrig and the extensive Bronze Age landscape in the local area overlooking the Liffey Valley. The site was, uniquely, in use for over 1,000 years (c. 2000–800 BC) and produced an important assemblage of associated (and intact) Bronze Age pottery, copper alloy implements and (locally manufactured) faience beads. Dr Grogan presented a paper on the site to the Carlow Historical and Archaeological Society (Excavations\n\nFaculty HigHligHts Faculty oF arts, celtic studies and PHilosoPHy\n\nat Carrig, Co. Wicklow: a Bronze Age family cemetery) in May 2019. The first stage of a project involving The Bronze Age hilltop cemetery complex: Ballon Hill, Co. Carlow — the analysis and publication of the largely nineteenth century investigations of this important Bronze Age landscape—has been completed and published (O’Neil, Grogan et al. 2018; Grogan and Roche 2014a; 2014b).\n\nconference contrIbutIons\n\n> Leenane, M. 2019 Functional or symbolic?

Staff member Professor Pat Palmer received an IRC Advanced Laureate Award valued at just under €1milliion for MACMORRIS. This 4-year research project, which recovers the diverse, multilingual world of early modern Ireland, brings to the Department 2 Postdoctoral fellows and a PhD student. The Department was also ranked as one of the top 250 in the world in the QS World University Rankings by Subject. QS ranks Departments on their academic reputation, the employability of their graduates, the prominence of their research output and research citations. This ranking is a result of the hard work and dedication of all staff and research students in Maynooth University Department of English.\n\nMapping Actors and Contexts: Modelling Research in Renaissance Ireland in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Century\n\nabout macmorrIs\n\nThe project maps the full range of cultural activity, across languages and ethnic groups, in Ireland from 1541 to 1691 and reminds us just how rich and complex the wellsprings of Irish culture are. It opens a window on a world on the cusp of drastic change but where everything is still in play: Gaelic culture is vibrant; the English vernacular of the Pale is lively and colourful; agents of the Tudor conquest like Edmund Spenser bring the energies – often dark energies – of the English Renaissance to Ireland; and contact with mainland Europe is routine. First, MACMORRIS builds a dataset of biographical metadata for everyone for whom records exist active in Ireland between 1541 and 1591, so as to identify cultural producers of all kinds and across languages. Second, MACMORRIS focuses on Munster in the period 1569–1607 and provides bibliographical and textual material associated with cultural actors in this region. This material will be visualised, using geolocation to map the principal actors in their places of residence and to plot relationships of patronage and exchange. The project runs from 2019–2023.\n\nPublIcatIons\n\nIn addition to this success in funded research, Department staff continue to contribute to and enhance the Department’s international profile through publication: in 2018, staff published 2 edited books, 17 book chapters, and 8 peer-reviewed journal articles.\n\nDr James Fraser co-edited Joyce’s Non-Fiction Writings: \"Outside His Jurisfiction\" (Palgrave), which featured an essay by staff member Professor Emer Nolan, broadens critical work on Joyce’s oeuvre. Professor Nolan’s monograph, Five Irish Women was published by Manchester UP in October 2019. Dr Stephen O’Neill edited Broadcast Your Shakespeare: Continuity and Change Across Media (Arden Shakespeare / Bloomsbury), a volume exploring how Shakespeare’s works are remediated across a range of media forms. Book chapters published continue to demonstrate the depth, range, and international impact of the Department’s research, with staff members publishing in major prestige University presses. Dr Denis Condon published 3 chapters ranging from women and concern musicians in the Irish picture house to an analysis of Irish historical bodies in early cinema. Dr Michael Cronin published a chapter on Irish writing after Joyce in the Oxford History of the Novel in English, and another on Anglo-Irish perspectives on British fiction.\n\nThe novel form appeared in the publications output of Dr Catherine Gander, whose chapter on temporality in Don DeLillo’s Point Omega appeared in a major new critical appraisal of the American writer’s body of work, Contemporary Critical Perspectives on Don DeLillo (Bloomsbury Academic). Dr Gander’s research also featured in the DeLillo symposium that the Department hosted in 2017. Dr Sinead Kennedy co-authored chapters on Abortion rights in Ireland and the Repeal movement. In early modern and Shakespeare studies, Dr Stephen O’Neill’s chapter on Shakespeare quotations\n\nFaculty HigHligHts Faculty oF arts, celtic studies and PHilosoPHy\n\non Twitter and other digital platforms appeared in Cambridge UP’s Shakespeare and Quotation, while Professor Palmer’s research on Ireland’s forgotten Renaissance – work that informs her MACMORRIS project – appeared in the essay collection Becoming and Belonging in Ireland 1200-1600. Dr Rita Sakr’s chapter on Rawi Hage’s Cockroach appeared in Toronto UP’s Contested Spaces, Counter-narratives, and Culture from Below in Canada and Quebec.\n\nDr Catherine Gander\n\nDepartment staff published in peer-review journals of international standing, including Textual Practice, with Dr Catherine Gander’s “Poetry as Embodied Experience: the Pragmatist Aesthetics of Muriel Rukeyser’s The Life of Poetry”; Literature Compass, with Dr Stephen O’Neill and Professor Pat Palmer each contributing to a special issue on Ireland and the Renaissance; the Journal of Postcolonial Writing on Refugee Literature, with Dr Rita Sakr’s article on Hassan Blasim’s short stories; Boundary, 2, with Dr Michael Cronin’s article on “Modernization and Sexuality in Contemporary Irish Scholarship”; and Social Research, with Dr James Fraser’s “The Exile and the University in Exile: Betrayal as Work in the Writings of James Joyce”. As these publications attest, Maynooth University Department of English continues to make significant contributions to knowledge across a diverse range of areas from American poetry and Iraqi writing to the representations of Ireland across periods and forms.\n\nconferences and eVents hosted\n\nIn February 2018, Dr James Fraser organised a symposium “On your bike: how the bicycle influenced literature and art”, which was supported through an early career researcher grant from the Arts and Humanities Institute. In November 2018, Dr Stephen O'Neill and Professor Pat Palmer (2018) organised the conference “Earth Songs: Eco-Criticism and Early Modern Studies”, with speakers including Dr Gwilym Jones and Dr Deana Rankin, as part of the bi-annual Irish Renaissance Seminar. In November 2019, Dr Stephen O’Neill organised “Kylie: The Symposium”, an international conference on the Australian pop star held in Maynooth University over two days. The conference generated high media interest, including a feature in The Irish Times Culture, an RTÉ Brainstorm article, and radio interviews.\n\nsemInar serIes and wrIters‑In‑resIdence\n\nThe Department Research seminar series continued its long tradition of invited international speakers as well as papers from staff members and researchers. Speakers in 2018/19 included Professor Stefan Collini (Cambridge University) who spoke on “Quality control: academic disciplines and the future of universities”; the Department’s IRC Postdoctoral fellow Dr Niamh Campbell; and Dr Catherine Morris (NUI Galway), who read from and discussed her work Intimate Power: Autobiography of a City.\n\nThe 2018 Maynooth University Writers-in-Residence, Paul Lynch and Christodoulos Makris, read from their work in November 2018. Readings by the 2019 Maynooth University Writers-in-Residence Annemarie Ní Churreáin and Sue Rainsford took place in December 2019. This event, which marks the 5th year of the residency, a collaboration between Maynooth University and Kildare County Council, was followed by readings from other creative writers among the Department staff and student body.\n\nawards and other achIeVements\n\nProfessor Pat Palmer was named Maynooth University Researcher of the Year for the Faculty of Arts Celtic Studies and Philosophy in recognition of her IRC funded project MACMORRIS.\n\nDr Matthew Fogarty, who graduated with his PhD in September 2019, received a Postgraduate Award 2018 for his work on the MU Postgraduate Feedback Council and for establishing and convening the Doctoral Researchers Writing Group.\n\nDr Catherine Gander was elected Chair of the all-island Irish Association for American Studies, which promotes the culture as well as the study of the United States in Ireland. The next IAAS conference will be held in Maynooth University.\n\nMaynooth University Department of English is in the process of establishing an ERASMUS + Strategic Partnership with the Department of English, University of Malta, a Mediterranean hub for international academic exchange. The agreement will provide for research and postgraduate teaching collaborations in the future, especially with regard to Maynooth University Department of English’s MA Literatures of Engagement.\n\nDr Catherine Gander established CRISES (Critical Research in States, Ecologies, and Societies), which is co-funded by the Department and the MU Arts and Humanities Institute.\n\nFaculty HigHligHts Faculty oF arts, celtic studies and PHilosoPHy\n\nengaged research\n\n> SalaM‑Ireland: arabic‑speaking adolescents\n\nDr Rita Sakr is co-investigator on SALAM-Ireland, a funded project with Professor Sinead McGilloway (Maynooth University\n\nDepartment of Psychology and Principal Investigator-Founder\n\nDirector, Maynooth Centre for Mental Health and Community\n\nResearch) and Dr Anthony Malone (Maynooth University\n\nDepartment of Education and co-investigator). The project, part of an international collaborative research programme based at the University of Washington in St Louis, uses mixed-methods research to assess the psychosocial needs of first-generation\n\nArabic-speaking adolescents (in Ireland in the case of Maynooth) and to identify potential school-based strategies to foster support for this population.\n\n> Diversifying the Irish Poetry scene\n\nDr Catherine Gander is liaising with the Irish Writers Centre to develop a Ledbury Emerging Poetry Critics Programme in Ireland to address and promote diversity and equality in Irish poetry.\n\n> Writers and the community\n\nMaynooth University Writers-in-Residence, a partnership with\n\nKildare County Council, is now in its 5th year and continues to enrich the cultural life of the University and region, with regular events and readings throughout the year.\n\ndePartment of hIstory\n\nIn 2018-19 the Department of History once again demonstrated its standing as a significant centre of research in Maynooth. Southern Africa (London: Palgrave), the culmination of an IRCHSSsponsored project examining the diplomatic, intelligence and military links between Portugal, Rhodesia and South Africa in the 1960s and 70s. JoAnne Mancini published Art and War in the Pacific World: Making, Breaking and Taking from Anson’s Voyage to the PhilippineAmerican War (Oakland: University of California Press), an innovative exploration of looting in British and American colonialism that integrates the study of material culture with political and social history. Jennifer Redmond published her first monograph, Moving Histories: Irish Women’s Emigration to Britain from Independence to Republic (Liverpool: Liverpool University Press), a sustained exploration of an under-researched topic that sheds light on the experiences undergone by Irish women in Britain – and the commentary their actions generated at home. Viktoriya Fedorchak, of the Department’s Centre for Military History and Strategic Studies, published British Air Power: The Doctrinal Path to Jointery (London: Bloomsbury), an examination of the RAF’s evolving mission at a time of rapid political, technological and strategic change, while Ida Milne, then an IRC-backed postdoctoral researcher, published her book ‘Stacking the Coffins: Influenza, War and Revolution in Ireland, 1918-19’ (Manchester: Manchester University Press). Worthy of mention as well is the publication in Serbian of John Paul Newman’s book on Yugoslav veterans of the Great War – Jugoslavija u senci rata ratni veteran I stvaranje nove države 1903-1945 (Belgrade, Službeni glasnik).\n\nAlongside Judith Devlin and Maria Falina, John Paul Newman co-edited World War One in Central and Eastern Europe: Politics, Conflict and Military Experience (London: I.B.

There were, finally, numerous peer-review articles published by members of the Department of History. Filipe Ribeiro de Meneses had articles on the Portuguese Expeditionary Corps in France (1917-1918) published in the Journal of Military History Vol. 82 (4) and the E-Journal of Portuguese History (Brown University & University of Oporto), Vol. 16 (2). David Lederer, in collaboration with Maria Teresa Brancaccio, published on the subject of suicide statistics in nineteenth-century German and Italy in Crimino Corpus (May). John Paul Newman published on the care of disabled veterans in the Habsburg army in the 1840s and 50s in the Austrian History Yearbook Vol. 49. Finally, Raymond Gillespie examined the life of a Huguenot family in Dublin in a contribution to the Dublin Historical Record Vol. 71 (1).\n\n2018 saw the publication of six more pamphlets in the long-running Maynooth Studies in Local History Series, edited by Raymond Gillespie, with works written by Tadhg O’Keefe, Michael Nolan, Cathal Smith, Gerard Moran, Heather Stanfiel and Catherine Flanagan.\n\nIrish Research Council\n\nThe Department is currently home to three IRC-funded research projects. Dr Frances Nolan began her postdoctoral project, entitled ‘The Cat’s Paw? Jacobite Irishwomen, 1685-1718’. Seán Ó Hoireabhárd, meanwhile, is continuing to research his PhD thesis, ‘The Storm Before the Storm: The Irish 12th Century and the Impact of the English Invasion’, while Sven Milekic continued his project on ‘Croatian 1990s War Veterans: Creators or Transistor of the Homeland War Narrative?’ The Department is delighted as well to have seen one of its students, Eamonn Milliken, awarded a major John & Pat Hume doctoral scholarship, for a proposed thesis on Austrian veterans of the Great War. Two other doctoral students, Veronica Barry and Cora McDonagh, were given minor awards by the John & Pat Hume scheme.\n\nAs is customary, a number of conferences were hosted by the Department. These included the 17th Annual Historic Houses\n\nFaculty HigHligHts Faculty oF arts, celtic studies and PHilosoPHy\n\nConference, entitled ‘Country House Collections: Their Past, Present and Future’. The sessions for this event were held in Maynooth University, Castletown House, and the National Gallery of Ireland, 13-15 May 2019. John Paul Newman was responsible for two events, ‘1918 and the Old-New Europe’, a one-day conference marking the hundredth anniversary of the ending of the First World War and involving twelve speakers, and ‘Forging the Nation: Establishing National Armies in the Balkans, 1804-1914’, a one-day workshop involving eight contributors. Worthy of mention was the one-day conference organized by some of the Department’s PhD candidates, entitled ‘Central and Eastern Europe in Transition’. Held on 26 April 2019, this pioneering event brought postgraduate speakers from all over Ireland to Maynooth.\n\nThe Department’s Research Seminar once again demonstrated the vital role it plays in bringing world-class historians to address Maynooth staff and students alike. Seventeen sessions were organised throughout the year, with the invited speakers including Natalia Zacek (University of Manchester), Nigel de Lee (University of Hull), Iskra Iveljic (University of Zagreb), Paul Moyer (SUNY Brockport) and Larry Goodson (US Army War College, Carlisle PA).\n\nFinally, members of the Department presented their research findings at numerous seminars and conferences. Worthy of special mention is Jennifer Redmond, who gave a paper entitled ‘Was there an Irish Voice in 19th Century British Suffrage Debates? Investigating Parliamentary Petitions and Speeches’ at the Oxford University Women in Humanities conference (October 2018). She also gave one of the keynote speeches at the Women’s History Association of Ireland Conference, held in UCC (April 2019). During the subsequent summer, she was an invited speaker at the Parnell Summer School, speaking on ‘Venturing Beyond Borders: Irish Women’s Emigration and the “Problematic” Diaspora of the 19th and 20th Centuries’.

Noteworthy peer-reviewed entries in yearbooks include Professor Florian Krobb’s article on ‘Rupture and Dissolution: Gertrud Kolmar’s Prose Works and Modernity’ in the prestigious Leo Baeck Institute Yearbook.\n\nContributions to conferences were also a significant factor in research dissemination. In 2018 members of the SMLLC were speaking to international audiences in the UK, Austria, Germany, Spain, France, China, Malta, and South Africa. In total, 15 conference contributions were made. These included a public Lecture on ‘German Constructions of the Boers in 19thCentury Travel Writing’ by Professor Florian Krobb, delivered in the Department of Modern Foreign Languages, University of Stellenbosch in March 2018 and another paper by Professor Krobb on ‘Wallensteins Mörder in der Geschichtsschreibung von Thomas Carve bis Schiller’, presented at the conference on Der Dreißigjährige Krieg – Ereignis und Narration at the Alpen-AdriaUniversität Klagenfurt, Austria. Professor Ruth Whelan presented the paper ‘From the virtual to the real geographies of the Republic of Letters’ at the Third Annual Conference of COST Action IS1310 Reassembling the Republic of Letters at the University of Malta in Valletta in February 2018. This was her concluding lecture to the COST funded project, which brought together over a four-year period (2014-2018) representatives from 28 European countries, including two appointed for Ireland. Dr Yinya Liu presented a paper on ‘Some Genetic Ideas on Ideogrammatic Writing for a Metaphysical Consideration of Artificial Intelligence’ at the World Congress on Metaphysics, Salamanca, Spain; Dr Lu Zhouxiang gave a paper on ‘Shaolin Fever: The Revival and Development of Shaolin in the Era of Reform and Opening Up’ at the conference on Crossing Boundaries and Engaging Communities in the Process of ASEAN-China Regional Integration in July 2018 at Chongqing University, China; Dr Julie Rodgers was an invited speaker at Nottingham Trent University on the topic of ‘Narratives of traumatic pregnancy’ in November 2018, and she was also invited by the Irish Canadian University Foundation to give a keynote at the D’Arcy Magee summer school in Carlingford (August 2018) on the topic of feminist writing in Québec.\n\nDr Clive Earls was invited by National University of Ireland as keynote speaker and discussant at the NUI-UCC Symposium on Ireland’s Languages Connect Strategy in November 2018 at UCC. His paper has subsequently been published by the National University of Ireland in its publication Education and Society, Occasional Papers No. 1. As a result of this and the National Forumfunded project, Dr Earls has been invited as part of the consortium to join the Foreign Language Advisory Group (FLAG) to input into the implementation of the national Languages Connect strategy which aims at significantly investing in the expansion of foreign language provision at second level in Ireland.\n\nDr Clive Earls\n\nDr Earls’ involvement in language policy development and language enhancement is, among other outlets, expressed through his membership in the four-institution consortium (UCC, MU, DCU and WIT). This consortium’s collaborative research project (entitled HELECs) was in early 2019 awarded the top-level award of €150,000 by the National Forum for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning in Higher Education in Ireland. The outcomes of the research project are likely to contribute positively towards achieving some of the aims of the Languages Connect national strategy.\n\nFaculty HigHligHts Faculty oF arts, celtic studies and PHilosoPHy\n\ndePartment of medIa studIes\n\nIn 2018/19, the Department of Media Studies continued its internationally and nationally recognised critical engagement with Irish and global media environments. Researchers in the department were involved in a range of funded and unfunded projects engaged with industry and the civic sector, as well as dealing with important critical areas of concern such as race, racism, gender equality, and cultural history.\n\nDr Anne O'Brien\n\nMedia Studies researchers were involved in a range of ongoing projects involving both community, industry, and policy engagements.

Dr O’Brien secured an industry funded project with Community Foundation Ireland to research representations of domestic violence in Irish media. She also tendered for a consultancy with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland to research gender and diversity in Irish media to begin in December 2019. Postdoctoral researcher Dr Sarah Culhane began a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions cofunded Collaborative Research Fellowships for a Responsive and Innovative Europe (CAROLINE) fellowship to research and record Irish cinema-going history, and which has involved working with Age Action Ireland to facilitate community workshops across the country. Doctoral candidate Michael Kurzmeier (supervisor Dr Jarrett) secured an IRC postdoctoral research fellowship to continue his project on hacking, archives, and public memory. Dr Sarah Arnold also secured internal funding from the Centre for Teaching and Learning workshop fund for a symposium on best practice for practice-based PhD supervision. Researchers in the department also received other small internal grants from the Maynooth University Publication Fund and to run workshops, conferences, and symposia.\n\nResearchers within the Department also continued their public engagement through board membership and advisory roles in media industry organisations and NGOs connected to their research specialism such as Liffey Sound, the Irish Film Institute, Social Justice Ireland, Safe Ireland, Women’s Aid, and Headline. Community engagement was also articulated through the dissemination of department research in a range of publicly accessible forms, in particular Dr Denis Condon’s Early Irish Cinema blog, and through a range of media engagements which included interviews on Newstalk, LMFM, RTÉ Brainstorm, Hot Press, as well as Dr Stephanie Rains appearance in Tríd an Lionsa, a TG4 documentary on photographic history. Dr Condon also continued his involvement in the Maynooth Film For All film club managed by the Kildare County Council which is an important, long-term engagement linking the Department’s research concentration to the local Maynooth community.\n\nKey publications in 2018 included an edited collection Vocal Projections: Voices in Documentary (Bloomsbury) co-edited by Professor Maria Pramaggiore with Annabelle Honess Roe and in which Professor Pramaggiore also had a chapter.

The book – Music Preferred: Essays in Musicology, Cultural History and Analysis in Honour of Harry White (Vienna: Hollitzer Verlag) – whose title recalls one of White’s earliest publication, is an impressive collection of articles by contributors from all around the world, testimony to the role that Professor White has had in forging the musicological culture from Ireland onto the world. Dr Cascelli’s monograph – Schenker’s Chopin. Files from the Oster Collection (Libreria Musicale Italiana. Online Bibliometric through Amazon Sale suggests that on average 13/14 books a month are being sold, which is a very good figure for a music\n\nFaculty HigHligHts Faculty oF arts, celtic studies and PHilosoPHy\n\nanalysis book) – is the first comprehensive study of Schenker’s unpublished analyses, from the Oster Collection at the New York Public Library, on the music of Chopin. Susanna Pasticci, in writing about the recent developments in the discipline of music analysis (in the Rivista di Teoria e Analisi Musicale) states that “by bringing together analytical rigour and a broad cultural vision, Cascelli proposes a new interpretation of the theoretical thought of Heinrich Schenker.” Dr Sofer co-edited a book on Elizabeth Maconchy, a British composer of the 20th century. The book is entitled Elizabeth Maconchy. Music as Impassioned Argument (Universal Edition). Ricordi writes that the “book provides insight into Maconchy’s struggle in the beginning of her career in the male-dominated world of classical music, her musical connections to Béla Bartok and into her biography”.\n\nMusic preferred. Essays in musicology, cultural history and analysis in honour of Harry White\n\nbook chaPters\n\nIn 2018, researchers in the Department published six book chapters.

Goethe, Schubert and Claudine von Villa Bella.” Dr Scahill looks at the role of piano in the revival of Gaelic music in his contribution to the collection of articles dedicated to Professor White with a chapter on “‘That Vulgar Strummer’: The Piano and Traditional Music in the Gaelic Revival.” Professor Morris reflects on what it means to watch opera live at the cinema in his “The Deadness of Live Opera” in Performing Arts in Transition. Moving between Media (eds. Maria Katharina Schmidt and Cornelia Schmitz, Routledge). Professor Palmer provides a rich analysis of the socio-economic context of the Liverpool Philharmonic Society’s development in the mid19th-century in her article “Cultural Demand and Supply in an Imperial Trading Centre: Developing the Liverpool Philharmonic Society Orchestra in the Mid-Nineteenth Century,” included in Global Perspectives on Orchestras: Collective Creativity and Social Agency (New York: Oxford University Press). Dr Sofer contributes with a chapter to the book she co-edited on Elizabeth Maconchy: “Death Becomes Him: Elizabeth Maconchy’s One-Act Opera The Departure.” Dr Anderson contributes to the recent development of the studying of John William’s music both in terms of the dramaturgy and compositional skills with her chapter “Sounding an Irish Childhood: John Williams’s Score for ‘Angela’s Ashes” in John William: Music for Films, Television and the Concert Stage (ed.

Dukas’s Ariane et Barbe-Bleue in the Twenty-First Century,” (Twentieth-Century Music). Dr Sofer explores the reorientation of norms of sexuality through the musical associations and conventions in Barry Truax’s Song of Songs (Organised Sound) and aspects of censorship and interculturality in Alice Shields’s electronic opera Apocalypse (American Music). Dr Cascelli reconsiders the role of Euridice in the myth of Orpheus and in\n\nFaculty HigHligHts Faculty oF arts, celtic studies and PHilosoPHy\n\nparticular in Monteverdi’ opera L’Orfeo in “L’Orfeo: Memory, Recollection, and the tragedy of Choosing between Seeing and Hearing (Philomusica On-line).\n\ncomPosItIons\n\nFor Ryan Molloy, 2018 sees the premiere of Dúchann, a new work for piano and tape commissioned by the IMBOLC International Arts Festival, and Ogham, a new work commissioned by the Ulster Youth Orchestra to celebrate their 25th Anniversary Year.

Beginning with this issue, which is the ninth, Maynooth Philosophical Papers will be published in collaboration with the Philosophy Documentation Center of Charlottesville, Virginia. The PDC is one of the world’s leading publishers of philosophy journals. The entire content of the journal, including all past issues, is henceforth available both in print and online.\n\nMaynooth Philosophical Papers\n\nSeveral members of the department contributed to the issue. Notably, it includes the inaugural lectures of the new Chair of Philosophy, Professor Philipp Rosemann, and of the first holder of the Thomas A. F. Kelly Visiting Chair, Professor William Desmond. In their respective lectures, Rosemann spoke on the philosophical dimension in the work of Leonard Cohen, while Desmond offered reflections on the way in which the experience of beauty opens up a path into metaphysics. The newly appointed Chair of Modern Irish, Professor Fionntán de Brún, published the English version of his inaugural lecture in the Maynooth Philosophical Papers as well—appropriately so, since de Brún approached the question of the revival of the Irish language from a distinctly philosophical perspective.\n\nIn addition, issue nine of Maynooth Philosophical Papers offers papers by Dr Cyril McDonnell and Dr Mette Lebech (in collaboration with Dr James Smith), respectively on the HusserlHeidegger debate regarding the meaning of phenomenology and on Edith Stein’s philosophy of education. Professor Emeritus Jonathan Gorman, former Chair of Philosophy at Queen’s University, Belfast, wrote a piece in the area in which he enjoys international renown, the philosophy of history.\n\nMoving on to book publications, Professor Rosemann published Charred Root of Meaning: Continuity, Transgression, and the Other in Christian Tradition, an investigation of the importance of the element of rupture in the constitution and history of Western Christian thought. On the relationship between art and religion, Professor William Desmond authored The Gift of Beauty and the Passion of Being: On the Threshold between the Aesthetic and the Religious. The book extends Professor Desmond’s influential"
