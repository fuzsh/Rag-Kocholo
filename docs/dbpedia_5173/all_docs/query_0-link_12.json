Tanker om fred og nedrustning in 1952, and was among the founders of the newspaper Orientering.\n\nHe was the editor-in-chief of the newspaper for some time.\n\nThe persons in and around this newspaper were excluded from the Labour Party in 1960, following a turbulent existence as an internal party opposition, especially in foreign policy issues. Some of the excluded members went on to found the Socialist People\"s Party, whereas Aubert left partisan politics to concentrate on an academic career. However, he continued his opposition towards nuclear arms.\n\nHe took the doctor\"s degree in 1954, with the thesis Straffens sosiale funksjon.\n\nIn it, he discussed the preventive nature of laws and punishment. In the same year he was hired as a lecturer at the University of Oslo.\n\nHe was promoted to professor of the sociology of law in 1963. This institution was, and still is, a part of the Faculty of Law.\n\nBooks in the field of sociology of law include Likhet og rett (1963), Rettssosiologi (1968) and Rettens sosiale funksjon (1976).\n\nContinuity and Development in Law and Society was published posthumously in 1989.

His textbook Sosiologi, published in 1964, was the authoritative introduction to sociology in Norway for many years.\n\nHis book The Hidden Society from 1965 was inspired by symbolic interactionism and the Chicago school.\n\nAubert died in July 1988 during a hiking trip. He held an honorary degree at the Faculty of Law of the University of Edinburgh, issued in 1971.\n\nHe has been credited for his contributions to the sociology of law, and some have labelled him the \"father of Norwegian sociology\" in general. Later researchers have noted his tendency to stress the importance of norms.\n\nHe has been criticized for maintaining a thin line between research and activism in some of his works.\n\nAubert\"s employment of action research has been attributed to his left-wing political stance."
