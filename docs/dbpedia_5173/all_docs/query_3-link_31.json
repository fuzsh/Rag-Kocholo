        "text": "ABSTRACT FOR: Contributions to an Adequate Methodology in the Social Sciences This essay exposes some of the ambiguities that are present in contemporary social science methodology that are inhibiting progress in the social sciences. By listing these issues, discussing problems related to the notion of paradigm, providing exercises to assist the social science researcher in uncovering the data of human consciousness as the proper data of the social sciences. These ambiguities are exposed and pointers towards solutions are explored that will eventually provide a higher probability of cumulative and progressive results. This work draws mainly on the work of Bernard Lonergan and his exposition of the data of human consciousness and its relationship and relevance to social science methodology. Keywords: social science, methodology, objectivity, paradigm, intellectual operations"
