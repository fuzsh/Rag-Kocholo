        "text": "[FONT=&quot]10 September[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Page 2 of 4[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1920 - [FONT=&quot]Luke Wills[/FONT], is born in Hall County, Texas. WESTERN SWING bandleader, musician, and vocalist Luther J. Wills was the next-to-youngest brother of BOB WILLS. Luke began his musical career much like his older brothers, accompanying their father, Uncle John Wills, at dances. The first band Luke worked in was his older brother JOHNNIE LEE WILLS's first aggregation, the Rhythmaires, in 1938. Luke played bass, rhythm guitar, or banjo and contributed occasional vocals for his older brothers' bands until Bob's Texas Playboys disbanded in the mid-1960s. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Luke's best-known vocal was \"Little Star of Heaven.\" He also appeared in several B-western films with the Texas Playboys. In 1946 he formed his own unit, originally called the Texas Playboys Number 2. Based in Fresno, California, as was Bob Wills, they played the central and northern California areas when Bob Wills & His Texas Playboys were on tour elsewhere. Renamed Luke Wills' Rhythm Busters, Luke's outfit recorded for KING and RCA VICTOR RECORDS. These recordings featured such stellar sidemen as Junior Barnard, Joe Holley, Bobby Bruce, and Cotton Thompson. The band dissolved in 1948. Luke Wills started another short-lived band in 1950, in Oklahoma City. Though he typically limited himself to vocal asides with bands he fronted, both groups were first-rate. Died October 21, 2000.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1922 - Árpád Szendy, composer, dies at 59.\n\nSzendy was one of the most significant figures of the Hungarian music pedagogy, who as an outstanding pianist and teacher, - in cooperation with Kálmán Chován - worked out the first systematic curriculum of the Academy of Music, including all years of study. Not only did he establish the norms of the academic training by that, but since his curriculum was extended for all the state music schools, as well, he provided direction for the Hungarian piano education as a whole.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Árpád Szendy continued his studies, started at his native town, at the capital from 1876 and became a student of the Nemzeti Zenede [Music Secondary School] and of the Academy of Music from 1879. He completed the piano major with the guidance of Henrik Gobbi and composition with Hans Koessler. As an honor of his talent and knowledge he won the Liszt scholarship in the 1883/1884 school year and – probably in connection with that – became a pupil of Liszt in that academic year. He had to leave out the following two academic years due to his illness and other difficulties, and he could continue his studies only from 1887 with his former teacher, Henrik Gobbi – as Liszt died in 1886. He earned his degree by the spring of 1889 and went on a study trip in the autumn of the same year. He spent one year in Weimar and Berlin to study with former Liszt-disciples: Bernhard Stavenhagen and Hans von Bülow. He was appointed as a piano teacher of the Academy of Music after his return, in January, 1891.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Szendy and two of his colleagues, appointed at the same time as him, Kálmán Chován and István Thomán were soon faced those problems which originated in the unregulated Hungarian music education. The development of a authoritative curriculum which could be generally introduced at other music schools of the country – at lower levels of music education - was indispensable to raise the standards of the piano (and music in general) education. All three of the professors of the piano department participated in the years of work each of them asserting his personality and artistic-pedagogic principles. The differences between the Szendy–Chován- and the Thomán-methods were pointed out by their contemporaries, interpreting them in certain cases as contraries or fortunate complementary of each other. F. Gy., writer of the Szendy-portrait published in the May, 1917 edition of the Zenei Szemle summarizes the essence of the two methods: 'We may divide pedagogues generally into two groups. The first group consists of those whose teaching covers only monitoring of the student's work, who entrusts the student to his fate without making any impact on the formation of his personality, in general: aloof. The other group transmits its own world view, thinking, conception, knowledge, whole personality to his student, and intends to form him to his own image. Árpád Szendy belongs to this second group.' According to the pertinent phrasing of György Kálmán in 1928, a former student of Thomán: 'the school of Szendy plans the playing precisely in the smallest details, the school of Thomán designs only the frame precisely, in advance, leaving more space for the filling of the frame and the inspiration of the moment.´[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] In fact, while István Thomán presented the World with outstanding performers first of all, Árpád Szendy with excellent pedagogues primarily. The students of Szendy were: Ernő Fodor, Emánuel Hegyi, Ilonka Kabos, Sándor Kovács, Géza Nagy, Sándor Reschovszky, Irén Senn, Ernő Unger and Mrs. Margit Varróné Picker, among others. As an acknowledgement of his pedagogical prestige Szendy was appointed to lead the artist trainer school as well, organized in 1911. His artist candidate students debuted at a successful concert at the Konzerthaus in Vienna, in 1914.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Over time, the method of Szendy was ripe for upgrading which was first tried by Ernő Dohnányi in 1918. Szendy, characteristically, missed just the pedagogical progressivity, the observance of the principle of gradualism from the part of the former Thomán-student and disagreed especially in that Dohnányi called for the usage of Urtext editions against the editors' editions. However the reform plans of Dohnányi were rejected by the directorate, Szendy was still relegated to the background. Aladár Tóth wrote about the reasons of that, too in his obituary on the occasion of the death of Szendy on September 10, 1922 modulating the image of Szendy formed in his contemporaries: 'If it is allowed to talk about tragedy in a life so full of successes and recognitions, then we should seek for the tragedy of Szendy just in his public and relating pedagogic activities that deprived him from the truest opportunity for prevalence: the stage. [...] Piano teaching was really the brunt of Szendy's life. Still we feel that the personality of Szendy could have unfolded much more naturally on the concerts stage than in the classroom. [...] In the school of Szendy besides that students were accustomed to honest, conscientious work; we could find only the impact of the outstanding personality with all its advantages and disadvantages. We lacked the professor's approaching to the student more at him than the great results of modern teaching methods that he rigidly refused.' Despite this aloof behavior –admits Aladár Tóth finally- 'we could always feel his strong hand and the fascination of his original, excellent personality has still not been ceased now, when we are separated from him by the grave.'[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1925 - Boris (Alexandrovich) Tchaikovsky, (Russian: Борис Александрович Чайковский) Russian composer, is born at Moscow. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nHe was a Soviet composer, born in Moscow, whose oeuvre includes orchestral works, chamber music and film music. He is considered as part of the second generation of Russian composers, following in the steps of Pyotr Tchaikovsky (to whom he was not related) and especially Mussorgsky.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He was admired by Dmitri Shostakovich, with whom he studied, who (according to Per Skans in his notes for a recording) suggested in a letter of February 1, 1969 to Isaak Glikman, that \"If Barshai's orchestra (the Moscow chamber orchestra) makes a guest appearance in Leningrad playing Vainberg's Tenth Symphony and Boris Tchaikovsky's Sinfonietta, you really have to hear them\".[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Of his larger-scale works almost all have been recorded. Boris Tchaikovsky generally wrote in a tonal style, although he made brief forays into serialism.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1925 - Roy James Brown, New Orleans, boxer/soul singer (Good Rockin' Tonight) is born. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]A pioneering New Orleans R&B blues shouter, Brown is best known for his composition, 'Good Rockin' Tonight', later a hit for Elvis Presley. Reared on old-time spirituals, Brown had despised blues music during his youth. Moving to Los Angeles and changing his name to Billy Hale, he entered the boxing ring. Soon quitting over his aversion to the sight of blood, he returned to Louisiana. Pursuing a career in music, Brown found clubwork as a novelty act, a black Bing Crosby imitator. Relocating to Galveston, Texas, Brown gravitated toward blues in the late Forties, honing his soulful, gospel-based high-pitched voice. Also a songwriter, he offered 'Good Rockin' Tonight' to Wynonie Harris who initially turned it down, changing his mind when he heard Brown's version on the radio. But unfortunately for Brown, Harris' remake fared better on the charts. With his sax and piano-heavy sound, Brown's R&B hits continued with 'Boogie At Midnight' (1948), 'Hard Luck Blues' (1950), and 'Bar Room Blues' (1951). Blackballed by the music industry after demanding unpaid royalties from King Records, Brown saw his career slump. Signing with Imperial Records in 1957, Brown scored his only pop hit with 'Let The Four Winds Blow'. In the Sixties, Brown issued a series of self-produced records on several different labels. Touring with the Roomful Of Blues in 1981, Brown saw his career reinvigorated. Suffering a heart attack near his home in the San Fernando Valley, he died at nearby Pacoima Lutheran Memorial Hospital. He checked into the hospital after suffering an insulin rejection on May 23, two days before his death. - Died May 25, 1981.\n\nin 1927 - Yma Sumac, whose stage name was sometimes spelled Yma S[/FONT][FONT=&quot]ú[/FONT][FONT=&quot]mac, was a Peruvian[/FONT][FONT=&quot]–[/FONT][FONT=&quot]American soprano. Her real name was Zoila Augusta Emperatriz Ch[/FONT][FONT=&quot]á[/FONT][FONT=&quot]varri del Castillo. In the 1950s, she was one of the most famous proponents of exotica music.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Sumac became an international success based on her extreme vocal range, which was said to be \"well over five octaves\" at the peak of her singing career.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Sumac recorded an extraordinarily wide vocal range of 5 octaves, 3 notes and a semitone ranging from E2 to B[/FONT][FONT=&quot]♭[/FONT][FONT=&quot]7 (approximately 107 Hz to 3.7 kHz).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In one live recording of \"Chuncho,\" she sings a range of over four and a half octaves, from B2 to F[/FONT][FONT=&quot]♯[/FONT][FONT=&quot]7. She was able to sing notes in the low baritone register as well as notes above the range of an ordinary soprano and notes in the whistle register. Both low and high extremes can be heard in the song Chuncho (The Forest Creatures) (1953). She was also apparently able to sing in a remarkable \"double voice.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1954, classical composer Virgil Thomson described Sumac's voice as \"very low and warm, very high and birdlike,\" noting that her range \"is very close to five octaves, but is in no way inhuman or outlandish in sound.\" In 2012, audio recording restoration expert John H. Haley favorably compared Súmac's tone to opera singers Isabella Colbran, Maria Malibran, and Pauline Viardot. He described Súmac's voice as not having the \"bright penetrating peal of a true coloratura soprano,\" but having in its place \"an alluring sweet darkness...virtually unique in our time.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Señorita Sumac was born as Zoila Augusta Emperatriz Chávarri del Castillo on either September 13, 1922, or September 10, 1923, most likely in Callao, a seacoast city in Peru; but, possibly, according to herself, in Ichocán, an Indian village. Her parents were Sixto Chávarri and Emilia Castillo. Her father was born in Cajamarca and her mother was born in Pallasca. Stories published in the 1950s claimed that she was an Incan princess, directly descended from Atahualpa. The government of Peru in 1946 formally supported her claim to be descended from Atahualpa, the last Incan emperor.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Chávarri adopted the stage name of Imma Sumack (also spelled Ymma Sumack and Ima Sumack) before she left South America to go to the United States. The stage name was based on her mother's name, which was derived from Ima Shumaq, Quechua for \"how beautiful!\" although in interviews she claimed it meant \"beautiful flower\" or \"beautiful ....\".[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Sumac first appeared on radio in 1942. She recorded at least 18 tracks of Peruvian folk songs in Argentina in 1943. These early recordings for the Odeon label featured composer Moisés Vivanco's group, Compañía Peruana de Arte, a group of 46 Indian dancers, singers, and musicians.[citation needed][/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]She married Vivanco on June 6, 1942. She had a son, Charles, in 1949. In 1946, Sumac and Vivanco moved to New York City, where they performed as the Inka Taky Trio, Sumac singing soprano, Vivanco on guitar, and her cousin, Cholita Rivero, singing contralto and dancing. She was signed by Capitol Records in 1950, at which time her stage name became Yma Súmac. Her first album, \"Voice of the Xtabay\", launched a period of fame that included performances at the Hollywood Bowl and Carnegie Hall.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1950, she made her first tour to Europe and Africa, and debuted at the Royal Albert Hall in London and the Royal Festival Hall before the Queen. She presented more than 80 concerts in London and 16 concerts in Paris. A second tour took her to the Far East: Persia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Burma, Thailand, Sumatra, the Philippines, and Australia. Her fame in countries like Greece, Israel and Russia made her change her two-week stay to six months. During the 1950s, Sumac produced a series of lounge music recordings featuring Hollywood-style versions of Incan and South American folk songs, working with Les Baxter and Billy May. The combination of her extraordinary voice, exotic looks, and stage personality made her a hit with American audiences. Súmac appeared in a Broadway musical, Flahooley, in 1951, as a foreign princess who brings Aladdin's lamp to an American toy factory to have it repaired. The show's score was by Sammy Fain and E. Y. \"Yip\" Harburg, but her three numbers were the work of Vivanco, with one co-written by Vivanco and Fain.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]During the 1950s, Sumac continued to be popular, playing Carnegie Hall, the Roxy Theatre with Danny Kaye, Las Vegas nightclubs and concert tours of South America and Europe. She put out a number of hit albums, such as Mambo! (1954) and Fuego del Ande (1959). Capitol Records, Sumac's label, recorded the show. Flahooley closed quickly, but the recording continues as a cult classic, in part because it also marked the Broadway debut of Barbara Cook. During the height of Súmac's popularity, she appeared in the films Secret of the Incas (1954) with Charlton Heston and Robert Young and Omar Khayyam (1957).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]She became a U.S. citizen on July 22, 1955. In 1959, she performed Jorge Bravo de Rueda's classic song \"Vírgenes del Sol\" on her album Fuego del Ande. In 1957, Súmac and Vivanco divorced, as Vivanco had had twins with another woman. They remarried that same year, but a second divorce followed in 1965. Apparently due to financial difficulties, Súmac and the original Inka Taky Trio went on a world tour in 1961, which lasted for five years. They performed in 40 cities in the Soviet Union, and afterward throughout Europe, Asia and Latin America. Their performance in Bucharest, Romania, was recorded as the album Recital, her only live in concert record. Sumac spent the rest of the 1960s performing sporadically.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1971, Sumac released a rock album, Miracles. She performed in concert from time to time during the 1970s in Peru and later in New York at the Chateau Madrid and Town Hall. In the 1980s, she resumed her career under the management of Alan Eichler and had a number of concerts both in the United States and abroad, including the Hollywood Roosevelt Cinegrill, New York's Ballroom in 1987 (where she was held over for seven weeks to SRO crowds) and several San Francisco shows at the Theatre on the Square among others.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1987, she also recorded the song \"I Wonder\" from the Disney film Sleeping Beauty for Stay Awake, an album of songs from Disney movies, produced by Hal Willner. She sang \"Ataypura\" during a March 19, 1987, appearance on Late Night with David Letterman. She recorded a new German \"techno\" dance record, \"Mambo ConFusion\".[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1989, she sang once again at the Ballroom in New York and returned to Europe for the first time in 30 years to headline the BRT's \"Gala van de Gouden Bertjes\" New Year's Eve TV special in Brussels as well as the \"Etoile Palace\" program in Paris hosted by Frederic Mitterrand. In March 1990, she played the role of Heidi in Stephen Sondheim's Follies, in Long Beach, California, her first attempt at serious theater since Flahooley in 1951. She also gave several concerts in the summer of 1996 in San Francisco and Hollywood as well as two more in Montreal, Canada, in July 1997 as part of the Montreal International Jazz Festival. In 1992, she appeared a documentary for German television entitled Yma Súmac – Hollywoods Inkaprinzessin (Yma Súmac – Hollywood's Inca Princess). With the resurgence of lounge music in the late 1990s, Sumac's profile rose again when the song \"Ataypura\" was featured in the Coen Brothers film The Big Lebowski.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Her song \"Bo Mambo\" appeared in a commercial for Kahlúa liquor and was sampled for the song \"Hands Up\" by The Black Eyed Peas. The song \"Gopher Mambo\" was used in the films Ordinary Decent Criminal, Happy Texas, Spy Games, and Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, among others. \"Gopher Mambo\" was used in an act of the Cirque Du Soleil show Quidam. The songs \"Goomba Boomba\" and \"Malambo No. 1\" appeared in Death to Smoochy. A sample from \"Malambo No.1\" was used in Robin Thicke's \"Everything I Can't Have\". Yma Súmac is also mentioned in the lyrics of the 1980s song \"Joe le taxi\" by Vanessa Paradis, and her album Mambo! is the record that Belinda Carlisle pulls out of its jacket in the video for \"Mad About You\".[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]On May 6, 2006, Sumac flew to Lima, where she was presented the Orden del Sol award by Peruvian President Alejandro Toledo and the Jorge Basadre medal by the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Yma Sumac died on November 1, 2008 at an assisted living home in Los Angeles, California, nine months after being diagnosed with colon cancer. She was interred at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in the \"Sanctuary of Memories\" section.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]On September 13, 2016, a Google Doodle featured Yma Sumac dressed as a Peruvian songbird.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1929 - Akio Yashiro, composer is born.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1931 - Alfonso Randano, Italian pianist and composer, dies at 78.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He is mostly renowned for inventing the \"third pedal\", which augmented the interpretative resources of the piano. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Rendano was born in Cosenza. He was particularly precocious and at the age of ten he was admitted to the Naples Conservatory, where he was noticed by Sigismund Thalberg who sent him to Paris, recommending him to Rossini.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1866 he studied under Georges Mathias, Chopin's pupil. For about 15 years, he carried out an intense musical activity; he then devoted himself to teaching: first in Naples, then in Rome.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Rendano wrote the opera Consuelo, successfully staged in Turin and in Germany. He held his last concert at Rome's Teatro Valle in 1925. He died in Rome in 1931.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The main theatre of Cosenza is named after him.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1932 - Percy Fletcher, British composer of classical music, born in Derby, dies at 52.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He worked as musical director at London theatres including the Drury Lane Theatre and, from 1915 onward, His Majesty's Theatre. Besides, he wrote ballads, works for chorus, and suites for light orchestra, organ voluntaries for church use, as well as pieces commissioned for brass band competitions, including the tone poem Labour and Love used by the Irwell Springs Band to win the 1913 National Championships.

He subsequently took up singing, initially and briefly as a basso profundo but developing a fine baritone voice. In 1868, he sang the part of Hans Sachs in a concert performance of Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg at Munich. With one minor and unplanned exception, he never sang on stage, confining himself to concert appearances.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He was a close friend of Johannes Brahms, whom he met in May 1874 at the Lower Rhenish Music Festival in Cologne, where Henschel sang the role of Harapha in Handel's oratorio Samson. The friendship lasted until Brahms's death; Henschel reports in his memoirs that he arrived in Vienna only hours too late to see Brahms before his passing, and that their last meeting had been at a restaurant in Leipzig in 1896, where they were joined by Edvard Grieg and Arthur Nikisch.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1877, Henschel began a successful career in England, singing at the principal concerts and, in 1881, he married the American soprano, Lilian June Bailey (1860-1901), who was associated with him in a number of vocal recitals throughout the United States and nearly all Europe until 1884. Henschel's very highly developed sense of interpretation and style made him an ideal concert singer, while he was no less distinguished as accompanist. In fact he sometimes combined both functions; he can be heard on records made as late as 1928 for the Columbia Graphophone Company, singing Lieder by Schubert and Schumann to his own accompaniment.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Henschel was also a prominent conductor, in America and England. He became the first conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1881 (he used the name \"Georg Henschel\"); on his appointment, he sent his ideas for an innovative seating chart to Brahms, who replied and commented in an approving letter of mid-November 1881. In 1886, he started a series known as the London Symphony Concerts (no connection with the later London Symphony Orchestra), and in 1893 became the conductor of the Royal Scottish National Orchestra.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]His compositions include instrumental works, a fine Stabat Mater (Birmingham Festival, 1894), an opera, Nubia (Dresden, 1899), and a Requiem (Boston, 1903). In 1907 he published a collection of his journals and correspondence in Personal Recollections of Johannes Brahms and in 1918 Musings and Memories of a Musician. A Mass in eight parts a cappella was first sung in 1916.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He was knighted in 1914 and at a farewell concert that year, was presented with a lute engraved with \"A token of gratitude for forty years' song\". He taught at the Institute of Musical Art in New York, where he met his second wife, Amy Louis, who was one of his students.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]His daughter, Georgina \"Georgie\" Henschel, was a noted breeder of Highland ponies and Norwegian Fjord ponies, and author of several equestrian books. Henschel died in Aviemore, Scotland, where he maintained his holiday-home Alltnacriche with his wife. He is buried in the churchyard overlooking Loch Alvie, nearby.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1934 - Larry Sitsky, prominent Australian composer, pianist, teacher, and writer on music, is born at Tientsin, China (of Russian-Jewish parents).

Left permanently blind at birth as a result of congenital glaucoma, Feliciano was first exposed to music at age three and would play on a tin cracker can while accompanying his uncle playing the Cuatro. When he was five, his family moved to Spanish Harlem, New York City, and at age nine, he played the Teatro Puerto Rico in the Bronx. He started his musical life playing the accordion until his father and family friend, Benjamin Borges, gave him his first guitar in a brown paper bag. He played every chance he had by himself in his room for up to 14 hours a day listening to 1950s rock'n'roll records, classical guitarists such as Andrés Segovia, and jazz players such as Wes Montgomery. He later had classical lessons with Harold Morris, who earlier had been a student of Segovia.\n\nAt 17, he quit school to play in clubs, having his first professional, contracted performance in Detroit.\n\nIn 1963, after some live performances in pubs and clubs around the USA and Canada, especially in Greenwich Village in New York City, and Vancouver, BC, where he played at the same time as Bob Dylan and Joan Baez, he was signed by Jack Somer, an executive at RCA Victor. In 1964, he released his first single \"Everybody Do the Click\" (which become a hit in Philippines, at nr2 and stayed for 14 weeks in TopTen Hit parade) . Later, in 1965 and 1966, he also released his first albums The Voice and Guitar of Jose Feliciano and A Bag Full of Soul, two folk-pop-soul albums that showcased his talent on radio across the USA, where he was described as a \"10 finger wizard\". He also was invited to the Newport Jazz festival in 1964.\n\nIn 1966, he went to Mar del Plata, Argentina, to perform at the Festival de Mar del Plata. There, he impressed RCA Victor officials who told him to stay there to record an album in Spanish. They were not sure what they wanted to record, but Feliciano suggested they record bolero music. The result was two smash hits with the singles \"Poquita Fe\" (\"Little Faith\", a.k.a. \"Sin Fe\", or \"Without Faith\"), a song written by fellow Puerto Rican Bobby Capó, and \"Usted\" (the formal way to say \"you\" in Spanish).\n\nA year later, Feliciano was due to perform in the United Kingdom, but the authorities would not allow his guide dog into the country unless it was in quarantine for six months. The stringent quarantine measures of those days were intended to prevent the spread of rabies. Feliciano later wrote a song entitled \"No Dogs Allowed\" (then lately in 1969 become a Netherland Top10 Hit on the charts), which told the story of his first visit to London.\n\nDuring his British visit, on July 16, 1967, Feliciano gave a live performance on the pirate radio stations Radio 227 and Radio 355, on board the MV Laissez Faire off the British coast, less than a month before the stations were due to be closed by the UK's Marine Broadcasting Offences Act. Also he was guest on popular British Tv show with Dusty Springfield, recorded a rare single for UK RCA called \"My Foolish Heart / Only Once\" who was played on London radios and June 4, 1967 in Speakeasy, London, during the Jose Feliciano concert Jimi Hendrix jams with him.\n\nAfter two more successful albums, Feliciano, now a household name all over Latin America, moved to Los Angeles. He got together with Rick Jarrard who was, at the time, also producing Harry Nilsson and Jefferson Airplane. They recorded The Doors' song \"Light My Fire\" in a Latin style and when released as a single, it reached #3 on the US pop charts in late summer, 1968. It sold over one million copies in the US market alone. However the song became a #1 hit in many countries, including Canada, Brazil, and the UK, and was awarded a gold disc. On the strength of this success he won two Grammy Awards for Best New Artist Of The Year and for Best Pop Song Of The Year in 1969 and gave to him a worldwide pop star status and popular recognition as a lead musician like crossover from latin music and english pop rock and as a first virtuoso classical guitarist to bring nylon string guitar in the pop rock scene.\n\nIn October 1968, at the height of protests against the Vietnam War, Feliciano was given the opportunity by Detroit Tigers broadcaster Ernie Harwell to perform \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at Tiger Stadium in Detroit during Game 5 pregame ceremonies of the 1968 World Series. His highly personalized, slow, latin jazz performance proved highly controversial. As a result of his unusual delivery, many radio stations refused to play his songs, and his career was stalled for almost three years. Even so, in an October, 2006 NPR broadcast, he expressed pride for opening the door for later reinterpretations of the national anthem. His World Series rendition, which features him accompanying himself on an acoustic guitar, was released as a single which charted for 5 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at #50. In 1969 working with Quincy Jones on Mackenna's Gold movie soundtrack recorded popular theme song Old Turkey buzzard and appears on numerous US Tv shows where he made duets with Frank Sinatra, Johnny Cash, Bing Crosby, Glenn Campbell, Andy Williams, Diana Ross etc. Under the pseudonim of Werbley Finster in 1969 he recorded a single So Long Paul about rumors of Paul McCartney's death\n\nIn 1970, he wrote and released an album of Christmas music, Feliz Navidad. The title song has been covered by many artists and is now a traditional part of the musical landscape in the U.S, Canada and Latin America around Christmas time. Each year during the Christmas season, \"Feliz Navidad\" returns to US airwaves, one of the most-played and most-downloaded radio songs and downloaded songs of the season. \"Feliz Navidad\" is also recognized by ASCAP as one of the 25 all-time most-played Christmas songs in the world.\n\nIn 1971, he traveled to Italy to participate in the Sanremo Music Festival, singing the song \"Che sarà\" in Italian, earning second place in that contest as well as a standing ovation by the Italian public. He later recorded the song, which became a well-known act in Italy, a great hit in half of Europe, including the Iron Curtain countries, as well as in Asia. Feliciano later recorded it in Spanish as \"Qué Será\", becoming a hit in all of Central and South America, and in English as \"Shake a Hand,\" a big hit in Scandinavian countries.\n\nDuring the 1980s, after a brief attempt for an English album produced directly by Berry Gordy (Jose was guest also on famous 1983 Cbs Tv show Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever), record companies gave him space made only for the Latin market, and he recorded an impressive number of hit albums for that market, including the Motown albums Escenas de Amor and Me Enamoré, as well as others from RCA, EMI, and Capitol which added four more Grammys for best Latin performer. He recorded a duet called \"Por ella\" with the most popular Mexican singer at the time: José José and become a latin Hit. Even on 80s and 90s He recorded duet with Natalie Cole's Everlasting, Gloria Estefan's Alma Caribena and again, in 1985, with Jazz singer Diane Schuur on his album \"Schuur Things\" and with Paul Simon in a particular version of his album Songs from The Capeman He received a star in the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1987, and continued as a very popular singer during the 1980s. He had his hands cast on the famous Madame Tussauds Museum's Wall of Fame, and has a star in the Walk of Fame of his native Puerto Rico. He also had a great hit in 1987 in Austria with the song \"The Sound of Vienna\", number 1 for four weeks and recorded with the famous Vienna Symphony Orchestra. The Orchestra also performed with him live on national television at Danube Park in Vienna before more than 60,000 people.\n\nIn 1994, Feliciano recorded a dance record in English entitled \"Goin' Krazy\" (MJM Records) under the pseudonym JR. Latino DJs around the world supported the record helping the 12\" dance record chart on Billboard and earning him new and younger fans.\n\nIn 1995, Feliciano was honored by the City of New York, which renamed Public School 155 the Jose Feliciano Performing Arts School. In 1996, he had a short cameo role in the film Fargo.\n\nFeliciano was also an inaugural member of the Independent Music Awards' judging panel to support independent artists.\n\nFeliciano performed the theme song, \"Behind the Mask,\" for the TV series Queen of Swords in 2000. A promotional video sung in Spanish but never published is on YouTube, and the full English version, never published, sung by Feliciano and the composers Spencer Proffer and Steve Plunkett is also on YouTube.\n\nIn 2003 Guitarra Mía, a special tribute to Feliciano, was produced by the Banco Popular de Puerto Rico and aired in Puerto Rico and in cities with large Puerto Rican population in the United States. This television special (and its soundtrack) featured Feliciano and many Puerto Rican and international stars singing some of his most famous songs, along with his personal favorites from other artists. It was first aired in December 2003, just two days after his mother died unexpectedly from a heart attack; in an eerie coincidence, the special's last scenes featured her giving her son a standing ovation, recorded for the occasion a month before.\n\nOn December 6, 2006, Feliciano's new Spanish album, José Feliciano y amigos was released by Universal Records, featuring Feliciano joined in duets with many other Latin American stars including Luis Fonsi, Lupillo Rivera, Luciano Pereyra, Rudy Pérez, Cristian Castro, Marc Anthony, Ramón Ayala, Alicia Villarreal, Ricardo Montaner, and Raúl di Blasio. A special edition was later released and featured Ana Gabriel and Gloria Estefan.\n\nIn 2007, Feliciano released an album called Soundtrack of My Life, the first English-language album composed and written by him.\n\nIn 2009, after winning his 8th Grammy for the album Senor Bolero, he left Siente music and released two new English-language albums for digital download only from his personal websites, one dedicated to American Classics, including songs made famous by Frank Sinatra, and the other dedicated to an instrumental album in homage to jazz guitar legend Django Reinhardt who inspired Feliciano, and features Feliciano's song \"Djangoisms.\" A single from the Kumbia All Starz features him and the internationally famous Tejano band, Los Dinos, which was released April 28, 2010.\n\nOn May 10, 2010, Feliciano performed his rendition of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", at Comerica Park in Detroit. This was part of the remembrance of Detroit Tigers radio announcer Ernie Harwell, who had died the Tuesday before. He played it similarly to how he did in 1968; with his acoustic guitar and in his slow tempo-ed, latin jazz style.\n\nOn December 15, 2010, Feliciano appeared as the featured guest on the 37th wepisode of Daryl Hall's Webbie-Award winning webcast, Live From Daryl's House. Feliciano and Hall took turns on several numbers, including Felicano's version of \"Light My Fire.\" On November 9, 2011, Feliciano received the Latin Grammy Lifetime Achievement award from the Latin Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences.\n\nOn january 2012, guest in Memphis for the celebration of Elvis Presely birthday he announces the released (on 2012 August, 7) of the new album \"The King\", The Jose Feliciano tribute to Elvis and produced with collaboration of George Klein, past Elvis manager.\n\nFeliciano and his wife Susan have three children: daughter Melissa and sons Jonathan and Michael. Susan was raised in Detroit and met Ernie Harwell during the controversy over Feliciano's rendition of the national anthem in 1968. Harwell later introduced her to Feliciano.\n\nBesides his musical skills, Feliciano is known for his strong sense of humor. He constantly makes fun of people's reactions to his blindness, and has even played practical jokes on friends and family based on this. Once his then bass player, Ted Arnold, contrived to allow Feliciano to appear to be driving down a busy street, fooling the passing police. During a show he once said, \"I was going to dedicate this next song [Zorba The Greek] to Howard Hughes but I can't see him!\" He then dedicated it to Jacqueline Onassis.\n\nHe has performed comedy sketches alongside Freddie Prinze, Sunshine Logroño, and the staff of Despierta América and Verónica Castro, among others. He has also parodied fellow artists in his concerts, including Julio Iglesias, Raphael, Rocío Jurado and Isabel Pantoja. An occasional song at his Spanish concerts is a parody of Bobby Capó's song \"El Bardo\". While the Right Said Fred song \"I'm Too Sexy\" was popular in the early 1990s, Feliciano closed his English concerts with a parody of it.\n\nHis performance of \"Old Turkey Buzzard\" became a recurring bit on the Late Show with David Letterman in 2007, until Feliciano himself appeared on the show on October 16 of that year to perform a live rendition of the song.\n\nIn December 2009 a parody of Feliz Navidad entitled \"The Illegal Alien Christmas Song\" was created by radio producers Matt Fox and A.J. Rice and posted on the website for Human Events, a Washington-based conservative weekly publication. The parody, sung in English, played on the stereotype of Latino immigrants as heavy drinkers and that undocumented immigrants were going to \"spread bubonic plague\".\n\nFeliciano released a statement on December 23 on his official website:\n\n\"This song has always been a bridge to the cultures that are so dear to me, never as a vehicle for a political platform of racism and hate. It's disgusting and my only wish that my song and I are distanced from the whole affair as soon as possible.\n\nIn a statement to the Associated Press the same day, Jed Babbin, Human Events' site editor, apologized for \"any offense that Mr. Feliciano may have taken from this parody\" and removed it from the site.

Her family moved to Southern California when she was 12 years old. Flores was influenced by a wide range of popular musical styles, and unlike many other women musicians, focused on developing her GUITAR-playing skills. Her first band was a local group called Penelope's Children; an all-female outfit, it played soft-rock and even opened for the Turtles on a West Coast tour. In 1978 she formed a punk-cowboy fusion band Rosie and the Screamers, a band that lasted about five years and played the California alternative music circuit. In 1983 she joined her first successful band, the Screaming Sirens, another allgirl outfit that mixed heavy guitar work with country and rockabilly riffs; in 1987 the band was featured in the TV film [/FONT][FONT=&quot]The Running Kind, [/FONT][FONT=&quot]gaining them some national notoriety. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Flores became a solo performer in 1987, signing with Warner Brothers Records. Dwight Yoakam's lead guitarist and close associate Pete Anderson served as the producer for her first album, which not surprisingly had the sound and feel of Yoakam's neo-rockabilly recordings. A second album was recorded, but Warners dropped Flores before it could be released (it eventually appeared in 1996 on Rounder). Flores spent the early 1990s recording for Hightone, and increasingly focusing on her guitar work. In 1995 she released an album, [/FONT][FONT=&quot]Rockabilly Filly, [/FONT][FONT=&quot]that featured duets with two of her rockabilly idols,Wanda Jackson and Janis Martin; a tour with Jackson followed. Settling in the Austin, Texas, region, Flores released [/FONT][FONT=&quot]Dance Hall Dreams [/FONT][FONT=&quot]in 1999. In 2000, besides her own solo touring, Flores teamed up with several other female new-country artists to form Henhouse, which played some gigs in Nashville. In fall 2000 Eminent Records announced they were signing the artist, pairing her with pop producer Rick Vito.

While still a boy, the increasingly wayward Thomas frequented adult environments, blowing the harp for the likes of Chicago greats Elmore James, Muddy Waters and Bo Diddley. By the late fifties he was recording for King-Federal, his raucous stylings often compared with those of Little Richard. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The Kid's reputation was fast growing out of hand, however, the young blues prodigy pulling stunts such as stealing cars so that he and his band might make their gigs. Thomas eventually settled in Los Angeles in 1960, forming a new band, The Rhythm Rockers, and cutting sides with Muriel Records. Sadly, these achieved no commercial recognition, and he returned to the gardening business he had started when younger, a well-stocked Beverley Hills-based address book keeping the wolf from the door. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]On 10 September 1969, however, his van struck and killed a 10-year-old cyclist, who died shortly after. Thomas – whose driving licence had already been revoked – was arrested and charged with manslaughter. When the case was controversially thrown out of court, though, the boy's father decided to take matters into his own hands. As the rest of the world was engaged in the unfolding drama of Apollo 13, Thomas waited outside a courtroom to face his licence aberration. Without warning, the bereaved parent appeared, pulled a gun from his jacket and shot the musician at close range. Kid Thomas died at 9.20 am at the Beverley Hills UCLA Medical Center – leaving a wife and his own young children.

He also spent time in a United States Army band, and briefly had a tour of duty in Korea. He later moved to New York City, where he played on the album Dakar by John Coltrane, played with Lee Morgan on The Cooker, and briefly worked with Benny Goodman's band in 1958. During this time, he also began working with Charles Mingus, performing on one of Mingus's finest albums from this period, Blues & Roots. Thereafter he recorded with Mingus sporadically until the latter's death in 1979. He later became a significant member of the Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Big Band from 1965 to 1978, and continued to record Jones's compositions on many of his own albums. Pepper also co-led a quintet with trumpeter Donald Byrd, with whom he recorded a live date, 10 to 4 at the 5 Spot, featuring Elvin Jones.

Smith hones his acting skills during his six seasons on the show, which features guest appearances by his musical partner, DJ Jazzy Jeff.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Smith is 21 when the show debuts, but he is known for playing a high schooler. In 1986, he and Jazzy Jeff released their first single, \"..... Ain't Nothing But Trouble,\" which despite some adult themes (the .... sure is trouble: she takes his wallet and screams ....), set the jovial tone that made them very popular with the younger crowd, but also acceptable to adults. The video, directed by Scott Kalvert (who makes The Basketball Diaries in 1995), established their signature look: vibrant colors, white walls covered with unobjectionable graffiti, shifting scenes with abstract set pieces, fisheye view, spurts of fast motion. Kalvert used the same style in their 1988 video for \"Parents Just Don't Understand,\" which was their breakout hit, earning lots of exposure on MTV. That video was proof of concept for Will Smith, proving that he could do quite well in front of a camera, and that he could pull off the character.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The husband-and-wife showrunners Andy and Susan Borowitz pitched the show to NBC, the network that was enjoying tremendous success with The Cosby Show. Like Cosby, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air is about a wealthy black family, but with Smith, sent from Philadelphia for an affluent upbringing, as the focal point. Smith really is from Philly, but the story about moving to Bel-Air with his aunt and uncle is concocted for fish-out-of-water comedy.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The show earns respectable ratings, scarfing up lots of young viewers as it airs opposite MacGyver and Evening Shade. Concurrently, Will and Jeff keep their music career going with the album Homebase, released in the summer of 1991. They leave their juvenile songs behind, but keep it light, scoring their biggest hit with the breezy \"Summertime\" a hip-hop take on the disco hit \"Ring My Bell.\" But their most successful song, by miles, is the theme to The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Smith rapping the open was part of the pitch for the show. A huge fan of TV comedies, he had no trouble crafting lyrics that fleshed out the concept in clever fashion (\"Yo homes, smell ya later\"). Jazzy Jeff, a respected producer/DJ in the rap game, put together the beat; they had it done in less time than it takes to watch an episode.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The show lasts six seasons, and far longer in syndication. In the summer of 1996, about a month after the last episode airs, Smith stars in Independence Day, the biggest film of the year. He becomes one of the most bankable and beloved movie stars, with starring roles in Men in Black (1997), Ali (2001) and Hitch (2005).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince won a rap Grammy in 1989 for \"Parents,\" demonstrating tremendous crossover appeal but also exposing a rift between their whimsical hip-hop and harder-edged rap from groups like Public Enemy and LL Cool J. But on the show, Smith isn't a professional rapper: he's a student. By frontlining a successful major-network TV series, he opens doors for other rappers who make the transition to TV and film.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1991 - Nirvana's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" is released as a single, forever changing the musical meaning of the word \"Alternative.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1991, the music charts are dominated by the pop sounds of artists like Bryan Adams, Mariah Carey, Paula Abdul, and Michael Jackson. The hair-metal craze of the '80s is struggling to survive, and although there are plenty of punk and alternative fans hiding out in garages and dive bars, the sound has yet to really take over the mainstream.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]That changes in the fall of 1991. Nirvana appears as if out of nowhere, knocking the music world flat on its ... with the undefinable sound of their first single, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit.\" It isn't straight hard rock, it isn't quite punk, it certainly isn't metal; the only label we can think to put on it is Grunge, slid into the broader \"alternative\" category that up until then had been occupied by the likes of The Cure, R.E.M., and The Smiths.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Lead singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain is the antithesis of the pop star image, with his thrift store layers and bad haircut, not so much singing as groaning and screaming the nearly-unintelligible lyrics that somehow make sense to a generation bored to death with all things smooth and polished. Alternative is nothing new, but his alternative is viable, and the release of \"Teen Spirit\" opens the door for a music revolution.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1992 - Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash married actress and model Renee Suran.\n\nin 1994 - REM were at No.9 on the UK singles chart with 'What's The Frequency Kenneth', the song the inspired by a bizarre incident when a US newsreader was attacked.\n\nin 1995 - Kiss played the first date on their 117 date Alive World Tour at Chattanooga Memorial Auditorium in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1996 - Neil Peart employs some jazz-influenced traditional drum grip on Rush's 16th studio album, Test for Echo.

His lengthy career included stints with late-sixties bluesrockers Moloch (who released one 1970 album on Enterprise), Alex Chilton, Rufus Thomas and even country stalwart Charlie Rich. Baker formed the much-loved Mudboy & The Neutrons in 1972 – the band that really should have been the making of him – finally playing the clubs with his own Agitators during the eighties and nineties. In August 1996, a freak fire all but destroyed Baker's home; the musician was philosophical and optimistic about it when he learned nobody had been hurt. However, by dark coincidence, just one month later, on the night of 10 September, Baker – as much through necessity as neighbourliness – was staying with his aunt, Sally McKay, at her nearby home in Horseshoe Lake, Arkansas, when a pair of teenage boys attempted to break into the house, believing it empty. Disturbed first by McKay and then Baker, the boys panicked and pulled guns on their victims. When Baker attempted to intervene, he was shot in cold blood – as was his aunt, just moments later. Abandoning their dying victims, the criminals then set fire to the house before making their getaway. Baker left a wife and three sons. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1996 - Music journalist Ray Coleman dies of cancer, age 59. A pioneering British rock journalist and biographer, Ray Coleman is best remembered for editing Melody Maker. A native of Leicester, England, Coleman worked at a series of major British newspapers before landing a reporter's position at Melody Maker in 1960. He soon brought a hitherto unknown degree of professionalism to pop reporting, infusing politics and more thorough reporting into a field largely looked upon as trivial. Finding himself at the vanguard of the beat boom, Coleman frequently obtained exclusive interviews with The Beatles. He became a friend and confidant of the group, especially John Lennon. Leaving Melody Maker in 1967, Coleman took over the reins of a spin-off magazine, Disc.\n\nReturning to Melody Maker in 1969 as editor-in-chief, he held the post until 1979, during which time he strengthened the magazine's position in the crowded British music field. Coleman became a freelance writer in the early Eighties, writing columns for various magazines and eventually turning to books. After penning a biography of Gary Numan, Coleman became a serious musical writer, writing a definitive two-volume John Lennon biography, the first with the assistance of Cynthia Lennon, the second with Yoko Ono Lennon.\n\nHe followed with an authorised biography of Eric Clapton and then of the late Beatles manager Brian Epstein, the latter with the aid of Epstein's invalid mother, Queenie. Coleman's subsequent works included a tome with Bill Wyman (Stone Alone), Gerry Marsden (I'll Never Walk Alone), The Carpenters and Frank Sinatra. At the time of his death, Coleman was completing an authorised biography of Phil Collins. Coleman was deeply upset by Melody Maker's drop in stature and circulation after his departure. He died at his home in Shepperton, England.

In 1759 he was Master of the King's Musick. An increasing deafness forced him to abandon active musical duties after 1769. His main task consisted in providing sacred works for performance; he also contributed incidental music to theatrical productions.\n\nHe conducted the Festivals of the Three Choirs (Gloucester, Worcester, Hereford) in 1737, and served as Master of the Royal Band in 1755. His magnum opus was the compilation of the collection Cathedral Music, in 3 volumes (1760,1768, and 1773; 2nd ed., 1788; later eds., 1844 and 1849). This collection comprises morning and evening services, anthems, and other church music by a number of British composers, namely Aldrich, Batten, Bevin, Blow, Bull, Byrd, Child, Clarke, Creyghton, Croft, Farrant, Gibbons, Goldwin, Henry VIII, Humfrey, Lawes, Locke, Morley, Mundy, Purcell, Rogers, Tallis, Turner, Tye, Weldon, and Wise.

His father Charles was organist at Church Saint-Gervais in Paris, a position previously occupied by Charles' brother Louis Couperin, a highly regarded keyboard virtuoso and composer whose career was cut short by an early death. As a boy, François must have received his first music lessons from his father. Unfortunately, Charles died in 1679. The church council at Saint-Gervais hired Michel Richard Delalande to serve as new organist, with the condition that François would replace him at age 18. Meanwhile, the boy was taken care of and taught by organist Jacques-Denis Thomelin, who served both at the court and at the famous church of St Jacques-de-la-Boucherie. According to a biography by Évrard Titon du Tillet, Thomelin treated the boy extremely well and became \"a second father\" to him. François's talent must have manifested itself quite early, since already by 1685 the church council agreed to provide him with a regular salary even though he had no formal contract.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Couperin's mother Marie (née Guérin) died in 1690, but otherwise his life and career were accompanied by good fortune.
