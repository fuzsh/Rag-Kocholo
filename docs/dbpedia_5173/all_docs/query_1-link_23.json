We could ground this grand question in analytic philosophy ala Rawls, metaphysics ala Rousseau, or rational action a la Riker. I want instead to ground it in European political history.l In this, I take my lead from Barrington Moore's Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy) which repeatedly treats rights as historical products, outcomes of struggle. In particular, Social Origins argues that the creation ofdemocracychecking of arbitrary rulers, establishment of just, rational political rules, and influence of the \"underlying population\" in the making of such rules2entailed the making of rights. In that book, Moore grounded the crucial rights in Western European feudalism. \"For our purposes,\" he argued, \"the most important aspect was the 1 This paper owes its existence to a question Mayer Zald asked over coffee in the basement of the Michigan Union. Readers may blame him for the question, but not for the answer. The Vilhelm Aubert Memorial Symposium, University of Oslo, August I990, heard a premature version, and circulated that version slightly modified in Lars Mj0set, ed., Contributions to the Comparative Study ofDevelopment(Oslo: Institute for Social Research, I992). I am grateful for criticism to Thomas Janoski, Lars Mj0set, Sidney Tarrow, Viviana Zelizer, and members ofthe New School's proseminar on state formation and collective action. Altlwugh I have updated references, the essay records my understanding ofits subject in I 990, when I wrote it. For later versions see European Revolutions, I 492 -I992 (Oxford: Blackwell, I 993), \"Entanglements of European Cities and States,\" in Charles Tilly and Wim Blockmans, eds., Cities and the Rise of States in Europe, AD I ooo -I Sao (Boulder: Westview, I 994), and \"The Emergence ofCitizenship in France and Elsewhere,\" in Charles Tilly, ed., Citizenship, Identity, and Social History (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, I99 5). 2 Barrington Moore, Jr., Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy (Boston: Beacon Press, I966), p. 4I4. 55 56 Charles Tilly growth of the notion ofthe immunity ofcertain groups and persons from the power of the ruler, along with the conception of the right of resistance to unjust authority. Together with the conception of contract as a mutual engagement freely undertaken by free persons, derived from the feudal relation of vassalage, this complex of ideas and practices constitutes a crucial legacy from European medieval society to modern Western conceptions of a free society.\"3 Despite this passage's whiffofidealism, Moore's comparative history portrayed those crucial rights as coming to fruition by means ofrevolution and class struggle; he gave his opening chapter, after all, the title \"England and the Contributions of Violence to Gradualism.\" My argument will diverge from Moore's in three directions: doubting the centrality of feudalism, downgrading the relative importance ofideas, and considering the crucial events to have occurred after the general dissolution of feudalism. It will nevertheless agree with Moore in two fundamental ways: by emphasizing resistance and struggle, by grounding rights in the specific histories of different European regions. Grounded historically, the question about origins ofrights becomes a naturalistic one: How have European people acquired enforceable claims on the states to which they were subject? More narrowly, how have rights of citizenship come into being? How did authorities come to owe goods, services, and protections to people merely on the ground of their belonging to a category, the category ofpeople in the political community attached to a state? How did that political community expand to include most people, or at least most households, in the population at large? Even more surprising, how did ordinary people get the power to enforce such weighty obligations? Vying in vain in a national arena, did Europeans instead wrest rights from local authorities and then see them eventually extended to a national scale? Or did benevolent despots first grant these rights to a small number of companions, and then, as enlightenment spread among rulers and ruled, extend them gradually to the rest of the population? Or did they emerge from struggle at a national scale? My answer hews to the third alternative: struggle at a national scale. Rights, in this formulation, resemble what Amartya Sen calls entitlements, enforceable claims on the delivery of goods, services, or protections by specific others.4 Rights exist when one party can effectively insist that another deliver goods, services, or protections, and third parties will act to reinforce (or at least not to hinder) their delivery. Such entitlements become citizenship rights when the object ofclaims is a..."
