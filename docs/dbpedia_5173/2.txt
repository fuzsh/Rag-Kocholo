The aim of the lectures is to celebrate outstanding sociology and general social analysis as a tribute to the legacy of Norway's great sociologists and scholars, Vilhelm Aubert.

The memorial lecture is comprised of two parts: an open lecture held at the University of Oslo, followed by a seminar at the Institute for Social Research. The lecture series started in 1991 and has had the pleasure of hosting a distinguished scholar every year since.
