        "text": "Synopsis\n\nIn 1997 Los Angeles , Lieutenant Harrigan (Donald Glover) is in the middle of a gang war when, unbeknownst to him, he is targeted by a Predator (Kevin Peter Hall). He must figure out why his squad members are disappearing while dealing with a government official, Special Agent Peter Keyes (Gary Busey), who is taking over his investigation of the cartels.\n\nReview\n\nOne of Predator‚Äòs strongest features is its simplicity. A team of commandos is in the wrong place at the wrong time. Predator 2 tries to keep the same simplicity but in an urban jungle instead of a lush, green one. It‚Äôs an interesting concept to move to such a dramatically different environment but I don‚Äôt think the film fully took advantage of the setting. Maybe it was the way the Predator hunted this time wasn‚Äôt as exhilarating or maybe it was the film‚Äôs pacing. Either way, I didn‚Äôt feel the suspense I felt in the previous movie. The film has a good cast who do what they can with what little script they are given. Danny Glover is a good follow up to Arnold Schwarzenegger‚Äôs Dutch. I particularly liked Bill Paxton as the quick-talking Jerry Lambert. The character‚Äôs attitude is much some of Paxton‚Äôs other characters I like, such as Private Hudson in Aliens or even more recently John Garrett in Agents of SHIELD TV series. Similar to the Xenomorphs in Aliens, Predator 2 expands on the Predator‚Äôs as a species, apparently called the Yautja (e-wat-ya), more by showing they hunted a variety of species, not just humans, as well as expanding their arsenal.\n\nI thought Predator 2 was OK üòê It tries to be simple like Predator but it doesn‚Äôt have the same thrill or suspense so it ends up feeling dull at times. The great cast does well but they can only do so much with the little material they have to work with. This is a rare case where the plot was too simple and to have a twist or two would have kept it interesting.\n\nTrailer\n\nCast & Crew\n\nStephen Hopkins ‚Äì Director\n\nJim Thomas ‚Äì Writer\n\nJohn Thomas ‚Äì Writer\n\nAlan Silvestri ‚Äì Composer"
