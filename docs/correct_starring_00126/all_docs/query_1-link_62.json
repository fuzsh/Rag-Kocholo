        "text": "Sorry guys, had to do it! Earmarked my second review on FutureProof Movie Reviews to be the not-so-recent but my personal favourite movie of all time.\n\nThe timeless classic-\n\nPREDATOR\n\nBrought to you by the cerebrum of John McTiernan, the man behind such classics as ‘The Hunt For Red October’ and ‘Die Hard’ comes this Oscar nominated (Yes it was nominated for an Oscar! I just wont say what category!) 1987 gem. Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers and Kevin Peter Hall as the alien, this movie begins the franchise of Predator affiliated movies to come. We begin the story at the title screen where we view an alien spacecraft in the stratosphere of earth jettisoning an object that enters our atmosphere at an incredible speed. BEGIN THE ACTION!\n\nEnter Dutch (Schwarzenegger) who arrives in style and is greeted by an army general who at first glance does not give off the impression of a veteran soldier of combat but I digress. Basic plot and mission objective is that Dutch’s character and his team of crack commandos are required to enter a South American jungle and rescue a presidential cabinet minister who had been abducted by guerrilla forces. Enter Dillion (Weathers) who lets the viewers know straight off the bat that he was operational at one point but now is behind a desk at the CIA and the most epic man to man handshake ever recorded for the silver screen. [BELOW]\n\nDillion has a strange interest in this mission and has installed himself onto Dutch’s team for this trip, much to Dutch’s dismay but orders are orders. This movie is a genre chameleon and at different points can easily be identified in multiple genres. We begin with the classic military movie and as we unwrap the story further it becomes a thriller, until like the 41st minute when the alien creature is fully revealed and we begin the horror. Director John McTiernan wisely reveals the Predator only gradually, beginning by showing a first-person perspective shot through its heat vision, progressing into portraying the glass-like figure while its invisibility camouflage is activated, and eventually displaying its full ugliness as it is de-camouflaged and unmasked. Given this build-up, the final unmasking could have ruined the movie if the designers and special effects team did not endow it with a believable and frightening appearance, but the monster’s fleshy, slimy, insect-like mouth, its dreadlock-like hair, and its general viciousness effectively complete the terrifying nature of the creature. This is not just a highly skilled alien. This is a bloodthirsty hunter. [BELOW]\n\nThe initial title this movie shipped under was “Hunter” and what an apt title it would have been, however Predator is just as fitting. Dutch’s seven man commando team, alpha males every one begins to be taken down one by one by this Alien. As we learn more and more about this Alien we begin to establish an understanding for just how sophisticated it is, advanced unworldly tech and weapons, light bending cloaking device that renders it invisible to the naked eye and a multi option perspective helmet that enables it to view humans through a thermal spectrum. All the aforementioned in mind it suddenly makes the team the underdogs in a 1 on 7 deathmatch. We begin to understand as the minutes and scenes pass that the Alien is on the planet to hunt the strongest and smartest game it can find, in an honourable hunting process that only an armed person would intentionally be harmed by the Alien. The destiny of this story comes down to a man versus Xeno battle.\n\nBucket loads of commitment was displayed during filming in the tough uneven terrain of Mexico and also included Schwarzenegger leaving filming to become wed to Maria Shriver only to return the very next day and to deceive his new bride into thinking that the trip to Mexico was a demi-honeymoon. Shane Black being given a role in the movie so as to keep him near John McTiernan as they were collaborating the ‘Die Hard’ script.\n\nFunny facts about this movie is that Jean Claude Van Damme was an original stunt man until he was fired but some of his scenes remained in the final cut, also, production was shut down for two weeks when the ‘Predator’ body suit arrived on set and was worse than anyone ever expected it could be and urgent changes were required!\n\nFinally, its noteworthy to add that ‘Predator’ was made within a budget of $15 million but took in over $100 million in the box office. A nice investment and another stepping stone for a young Austrian actor who liked to work out!\n\nFutureProof Movie Review Score: 8.5"
