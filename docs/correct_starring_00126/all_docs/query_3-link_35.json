        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: After announcing that the studio would be expanding on its Predator universe earlier this year, 20th Century and Dan Trachtenberg’s next standalone pic Badlands looks to be gaining momentum with some serious star power. Sources close to Deadline say that Elle Fanning is in negotiations to star in the film with Trachtenberg directing. Trachtenberg co-wrote script with Patrick Aison.\n\n20th Century had no comment.\n\nPlot details are being kept under wraps, other than it will feature everyone’s favorite extraterrestrial big game hunter. It is also not known about release plans as the last film exclusively streamed on Hulu (breaking numerous viewerships records for the streamer) but given that 20th Century has been very much back in the theatrical game with films like Boogeyman and the upcoming Alien: Romulus film bowing in theaters, a theatrical premiere isn’t out of the question.\n\nDeadline reported earlier this year that when Prey premiered in the summer of 2022, It not only broke streaming records for Hulu but earned some of the best reviews in the franchise’s history the culminated in a nomination for best movie at this years Emmys. Since that successful relaunch, 20th Century is looking to not just move forward with another film but expand on a universe with Trachtenberg spearheading it.\n\nWhile Prey featured a cast of relative unknowns and rising stars like Amber Midthunder, execs and Trachtenberg wanted to try and land an established star for this new standalone pic and began taking meetings with talent. Insiders close to the project say Fanning is a fan of the franchise and once execs got wind of her interest moved to set a meeting with her and Trachtenberg. Following that meeting between the two, Fanning was on board and once a deal closes momentum is expected to pick up with the hope to shoot later this. year.\n\nAs for a sequel to Prey, sources say while it is still in early development, a Prey 2 is still in the works that would return to the films original setting and with Prey star, Amber Midthunder, potentially returning. Sources stress no talent is attached to that film but the interesting element is that even though there has been seven films featuring the infamous alien, there has never been an instance where the star of a previous film has returned to reprise their role.\n\nFanning is no stranger to battle alien lifeforms as she got her first big break in the J.J. Abrams sci-fi pic Super 8. Fanning is coming off the final season of The Great, which earned an Emmy nomination for her performance as Catherine The Great.\n\nNext up she can be seen in the Bob Dylan pic A Complete Unknown, where she will play Sylvie Russo opposite Timothee Chalamet who play Dylan. She is repped by UTA, TFC Management and Hansen, Jacobson, Teller."
