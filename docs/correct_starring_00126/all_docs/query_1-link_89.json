        "text": "Hurtin Bombs wanted to honor the late Kevin Peter Hall on his birthday yesterday, but due to technical issues we were unable to.\n\nStill we want to honor the man and his work, even if it is a day late, particularly for bringing to life one of the greatest movie monsters of all time-The Predator.\n\nHall secured the role after the creature had been redesigned. Originally Jean Claude Van Damme had been cast as the Alien hunter on the trail of Arnold and co, but as he was clearly far smaller than most of the cast (Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jesse Verntura et al) the decision was made to bring in the more physically dominating presence of 7ft 2in Hall.\n\nUntil then we had never seen Arnold up against anyone who seemed like they could so much as make him break sweat, let alone tear out his spinal column with bare hands, but with Hall’s powerful, yet graceful movements and distinctly reptilian body language we were finally made to fear for our hero.\n\nSeeing The Predator for the first time at age 9 left a lasting impression. I remember being simultaneously terrified and fascinated by the Predator. What was this thing that was bringing down these larger than life heroes? I wondered, watching through my fingers.\n\nIn contrast, I also remember feeling pity for the creature as Arnold does when he finally triumphs over it and shows mercy-unaware that it has one more trick up its sleeve of course.\n\nAlthough The Predator suit was Stan Winston’s genius design, it was the work of the man in the suit that had evoked all these feelings in me, and I don’t think anyone since has been able to bring the Predator to life as fully as Hall did.\n\nThank you Mr Hall, for both terrorizing and thrilling me.\n\nHB\n\nEarly life\n\nHall was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.[1] His parents were of above-average stature; his father, Charles Hall, was 6’ 6\", and his mother, Sylvia Hall, was 6’ 2\". At 7’ 2\" tall,[2] he was the tallest of six brothers, all over 6’ 5\". During his high school years at Penn Hills High School, he excelled at basketball and earned a scholarship to George Washington University inWashington, D.C.. In college, Hall continued to play basketball and majored in Theatrical Arts.[3]After graduation, Hall moved to Venezuela to play basketball.\n\nCareer\n\nHall made his acting debut in the 1979 horror film Prophecy. Due to his tall stature, he was often cast in monster roles. He appeared as “the alien” in the 1980 horror film Without Warning and as “Gorvil” in the 1982 television movie Mazes and Monsters. In 1985, he co-starred in the short-lived series Misfits of Science. He guest starred on the sitcom Night Court, as a huge but gentle mental patient who humorously towered over bailiff Bull Shannon (played by Richard Moll, who is 6'8\"). The next year, Hall portrayed yet another monster in the horror film Monster in the Closet, followed by the role of “Harry” in Harry and the Hendersons.\n\nIn 1986, Hall was cast as the main antagonist in Predator, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. During its developmental stages, the Predator was going to be played by Jean-Claude Van Damme, who played the Predator for the first few scenes and wasn’t billed on end credits. The producers decided to recast with Hall so that the Predator could realistically physically dominate the film’s human characters. Hall would go on to reprise the role in the 1990 sequel.\n\nFollowing his role in Predator, Hall appeared in the film Big Top Pee-wee (1988), and had a guest spot on Star Trek: The Next Generation (a series for which he had once been a leading contender for two key roles, Geordi LaForge and Lt. Commander Data).[4] From 1989 to 1990, he had a recurring role on the NBC sitcom 227. In 1990, Hall reprised his role as Harry on the television series based on the film. He died during the series’ first season.\n\nPersonal life and death\n\nHall met actress Alaina Reed while filming a guest spot on the television show 227. The couple would marry both on the show, and in real life.\n\nWhile working on the series Harry and the Hendersons, Hall announced that he had contracted HIV from a contaminated blood transfusion.On April 10, 1991, Hall died from pneumonia. He was 35 years old.\n\nHonours\n\nHall was posthumously inducted into the Penn Hills Hall of Fame as part of the inaugural class on May 8, 2009."
