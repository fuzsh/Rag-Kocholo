        "text": "Kevin Peter Hall He was big 2.20 mtr\n\nHall made his acting debut in the 1979 horror film Prophecy. Due to his tall stature, he was often cast in monster roles. He appeared as \"the alien\" in the 1980 horror film Without Warning and as \"Gorvil\" in the 1982 television movie Mazes and Monsters. In 1985, he co-starred in the short-lived series Misfits of Science. The next year, Hall portrayed yet another monster in the horror film Monster in the Closet, followed by the role of \"Harry\" in Harry and the Hendersons.\n\nIn 1986, Hall was cast as the Predator in Predator, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. During its developmental stages, the Predator was going to be played by Jean-Claude Van Damme, who played the Predator for the first few scenes and wasn't billed on end credits. The producers decided to recast with Hall so that the Predator could realistically physically dominate the film's human characters. Hall would go on to reprise the role in the 1990 sequel.\n\nFollowing his role in Predator, Hall appeared in the film Big Top Pee-wee (1988), and had a guest spot on Star Trek: The Next Generation. From 1989 to 1990, he had a recurring role on the NBC sitcom 227. In 1990, Hall reprised his role as Harry on the television series based on the film. He died during the series' first season.\n\nFilm Predator I+II\n\nHall met actress Alaina Reed while filming a guest spot on the television show 227. The couple would marry both on the show, and in real life.\n\nWhile working on the series Harry and the Hendersons, Hall announced that he had contracted AIDS from a contaminated blood transfusion. On April 10, 1991, Hall died from pneumonia.He was 35 years old."
