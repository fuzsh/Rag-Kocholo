He contracted HIV and shortly after was diagnosed with AIDS. He sadly died of AIDS related pneumonia on 10th April 1991, a month short of his 36th birthday.\n\nHe gave us one of the best sci-fi movie creatures of all time! üëå\n\nIf you get a few minutes, this video about him that also features some behind the scenes footage of Predator is worth a watch. üëá"
