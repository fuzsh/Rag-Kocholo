        "text": "Predator Badlands is the name of the next film in the Predator series. It has been written by Dan Trachtenberg and Patrick Aison and will be directed by Dan Trachtenberg.\n\nCurrent Status\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter broke the news in February 2024 that a few Predator projects are in development with Dan Trachtenberg at the helm. Predator Badlands is one of those projects and production on Predator Badlands is supposed to start in July 2024.\n\nPredator Badlands Cast\n\nNo formal cast announcements have been announced as of yet but Predator Badlands is said to have a female lead. In June 2024, it was revealed that Elle Fanning is in talks for a role.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger has long been rumoured to reprise his role as Dutch in a Predator sequel. When a new Predator film is announced, there is always some rumblings that Dutch might make an appearance. For Predators, Robert Rodriguez made it clear from the outset that he wanted Arnie to make an appearance but he was still busy.\n\nIn March 2016, Arnold Schwarzenegger had lunch with director Shane Black to discuss The Predator. In an early draft of The Predator, Arnold’s character Dutch appeared in the closing moments of the film. He emerges from a chopper and asks Quinn, Casey and Rory to come with him. Schwarzenegger was very unhappy with the script and refused to take part, saying he’d only do it if “there’s a chance that they rewrite it, or make it a more significant role.”\n\nOther people who have been in the spotlight was WWF wrestler The Rock who would have taken over the Dutch role. In September 2003, The Rock denied that he has any involvement in a Predator movie. In 2005, another wrestler, John Cena, was also rumoured to be involved in a remake of Predator.\n\nPredator Badlands Storyline\n\nUnlike Prey which was set in 1719, Predator Badlands is said to be set in the future and will feature a female lead.\n\nPrevious Stories\n\nBefore The Predator was announced, the most popular idea was Rodriguez returning to do a direct sequel to Predators with Adrien Brody again. The ending was very open-ended but I’d imagine it would be hard to do a new story without repeating the first movie. Rodriguez stated in July 2010 that he had a few ideas for Predator 4. He said Predators sets up a new story, new location and a new world for a potential sequel. If Rodriguez isn’t involved, it could be a completely new story.\n\nThere were all sorts of ideas for a new Predator sequel floating around over the years. Prior to Predators been made, there are about three scripts for Predator 3 circulating around the globe. The first, written by Sam Park, is called Predator 3: The Deadlier of the Species and features Arnold Schwarzenegger’s character, Dutch, in New York during a blizzard. A Predator comes to New York and tracks down Dutch to try and kill him.\n\nThe second script, written by Robert Rodriguez, is called Predators and is set on a 17th century ship where a Predator stalks the crewman who have to fight with inferior weaponry. Rodriguez did speak about his script during an interview at the beginning of 2004 and said it was rejected because the budget would have been too big – about $150m. The third and final script is called The Zoo which brings back both Dutch from Predator and Harrigan from Predator 2 and they are captured and brought back to the Predator homeworld because they were the only two people to have ever killed a Predator.\n\nYou can check out this article: Where should Shane Black’s Predator Sequel take place? which covers various locations they could go with Predator 6 including the Predator homeworld.\n\nLatest Predator Badlands News\n\nPrey Takes Home Emmy for Outstanding Sound Editing ( )\n\nHot Toys Shows Off New Pictures of Their Upcoming Feral Predator!
