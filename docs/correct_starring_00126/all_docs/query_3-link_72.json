        "text": "After stunning critics with Brie Larson in the Oscar-winning film “Room” last year, Jacob Tremblay is jumping into the world of blockbusters by joining the cast of Shane Black’s “The Predator.”\n\nThe film has been loading its cast up with major stars in the past few months. Joining Tremblay in the monster movie are Boyd Holbrook (“Narcos”), Keegan Michael-Key, Sterling K. Brown, Olivia Munn, and Trevante Rhodes (“Moonlight”). Production is set to begin in Vancouver next month.\n\nHolbrook stars in the film as an ex-Marine who discovers the existence of the titular alien species and is forced to lead the fight against them. Tremblay plays the marine’s son, an autistic boy who is bullied in school but becomes vital to his father’s mission as his ability to quickly learn languages proves to be a valuable tool.\n\nTremblay will also star alongside Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson in “Wonder,” an adaptation of R.J. Palacio’s novel about a boy who struggles for acceptance in school while bearing a facial deformity. That movie will be released this April.\n\n“The Predator” is slated by Twentieth Century Fox for a 2018 release and will be the first installment in the “Predator” series since 2007’s “Alien vs. Predator: Requiem.” The film is directed by Black, who co-wrote the screenplay with Fred Dekker (“Monster Squad”).\n\nTremblay is represented by UTA, Canada’s Play Management and Jackoway Tyerman."
