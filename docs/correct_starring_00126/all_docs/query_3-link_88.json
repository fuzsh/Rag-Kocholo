        "text": "Whether you love The Phantom Menace, hate it, or your feelings are somewhere in between, you’ve got to admit that one of the valid criticisms of the film is that–unlike the Predator movies–there’s no clear chief protagonist.\n\nWhen fans first learned the film was coming out, it was assumed Ewan McGregor’s Obi-Wan Kenobi was the main hero, but he’s benched for the entire Tattooine sequence and doesn’t really take center stage until after Qui-Gon’s death.\n\nJake Lloyd’s Anakin shows up too late to be the main guy. Liam Neeson’s Qui-Gon is the best candidate, but by the end he doesn’t fare better than your average Predator character.\n\nThere’s never much mystery regarding who is going to survive a Predator movie–Arnold Schwarzenegger, Danny Glover, Adrien Brody, Boyd Holbrook, Amber Midthunder, and whoever else is #1 on the call sheet.\n\nMaybe one other character will survive–a sidekick/love interest like Anna (Elpidia Carillo) in Predator or Isabelle (Alice Braga) in Predators, or a pet like Sarii in Prey–but pretty much everyone else but the main character is as good as dead.\n\nWe’re left to wonder not who will die, but when and how. Will they die heroically like Hanzo (Louis Ozawa) in Predators, or without having the slightest idea of what’s going on like Danny (Ruben Blades) in Predator 2?\n\nSure, that’s proven plenty fun so far, but what if we actually didn’t know who was going to survive, if anyone? What if the Adrien Brody and Arnold Schwarzenegger characters of each film had just as much chance of getting their spines ripped out of them as Carl Weathers or Walton Goggins?\n\nHaving no clear chief protagonist wasn’t a boon to The Phantom Menace but it would be a benefit to a Predator flick for the same reason a lot of fans enjoyed Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire more than critics did–because the film focused less on the human characters and more on the monsters.\n\nAfter all, just like the MonsterVerse flicks, while we may root for human heroes in the Predator films, it’s the eponymous hunters that keep us coming back.\n\nThat’s why not a single human character has appeared in more than one Predator movie so far, just as most (though not all) MonsterVerse actors show up for only a single film.\n\nMost of the Predator movies are ensemble affairs, with plenty of big name celebrities in the hunters’ sights. Even the flops like 2018’s The Predator boasted a cast with Body Holbrook, Game of Thrones‘ Alfie Allen, former Punisher Thomas Jane, Keegan-Michael Key, Olivia Munn, and Sterling K. Brown among others.\n\nPredators–the most underrated film of the series–stars Adrien Brody, Walton Goggins, Laurence Fishburne, Mahershala Ali, Danny Trejo, and Topher Grace.\n\nImagine a Predator movie with a cast like that, but with no clear main hero. It would be like a reverse Knives Out–anyone could die, no matter where they are on the call sheet."
