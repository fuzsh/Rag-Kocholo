        "text": "An elite special forces team led by Arnold Schwarzenegger's Dutch heads into the jungles of Central America on a mission to rescue hostages from guerrilla territory, only to encounter a superior race of alien hunters in the 1987 horror classic 'Predator.' 25 years later, we take a look back at the cast of this film to see what they were up to then, and where they are now.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger, Major Alan \"Dutch\" Schaefer\n\nThen: Action star Arnold Schwarzenegger played Dutch, a Green Beret and leader of the special forces team.\n\nNow: Schwarzenegger took a break from acting in 2004 to tend to his duties as governor of California, but recently returned to acting, starring in both 'Expendables' films and 'The Last Stand.' He can be seen next alongside fellow 'Expendables' star Sylvester Stallone in 'Escape Plan.'\n\nCarl Weathers, George Dillon\n\nThen: Carl Weathers, a former football player who starred in the 'Rocky' films with Sylvester Stallone, played George Dillon, a former colleague of Dutch and CIA agent who accompanies his old partner on the mission.\n\nNow: Weathers has starred in three films with Adam Sandler: 'Happy Gilmore,' 'Little Nicky,' and 'Eight Crazy Nights.' He has also had a recurring guest spot on 'Arrested Development' as a fictionalized version of himself.\n\nElpidia Carrillo, Anna\n\nThen: Mexican actress Elpidia Carrillo played Anna, a guerrilla fighter captured by Dutch and his team.\n\nNow: Carrillo made a cameo appearance in 'Predator 2,' and has appeared in the films 'Kingpin' and 'Seven Pounds.'\n\nRichard Chaves, Jorge \"Pancho\" Ramirez\n\nThen: Richard Chaves played Poncho, one of Dutch's team members who helps translate for Anna.\n\nNow: Chaves took a break from acting and appearing at conventions in the late 90s, following an incident with a stalker. Since then, Chaves has made few public appearances, but has appeared on an episode of 'Days of Our Lives' and in the movies 'Lost Warrior: Left Behind' and 'The Dark House.'\n\nBill Duke, Mac Eliot\n\nThen: Bill Duke played former Vietnam soldier and special forces team member Mac Eliot.\n\nNow: Duke had a recurring role on the series 'Fastlane' and 'Karen Sisco,' and has appeared in films like 'X-Men: The Last Stand' and 'The Limey.' In addition to acting, Duke also directs -- among his credits are the films 'Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit' and 'Hoodlum.'\n\nJesse Ventura, Blain Cooper\n\nThen: Former professional wrestler Jesse Ventura made his big screen debut in 'Predator' as Blain Cooper, a soldier who served in Vietnam alongside Mac.\n\nNow: Like Schwarzenegger, Ventura also got into politics, and was elected governor of Minnesota in 1998, and in 2002 he announced he would not be running for a second term. Ventura has written a number of politically-themed books, and has made several guest appearances on WWE programs.\n\nSonny Landham, Billy Sole\n\nThen: Sonny Landham starred as Billy Sole, a Native American tracker who helps Dutch and his crew. Landham was given a bodyguard on set -- not to protect him, but to protect his co-stars and the crew from him. Landham was prone to violent outbursts and drunkenly picking fights. Prior to landing acting gigs in films like 'The Warriors' and 'Predator,' Landham acted in pornographic films.\n\nNow: Landham, hoping to capitalize on the success of Schwarzenegger and Ventura's political bids, ran for governor of Kentucky in 2003. He also ran for a senate seat in the state in 2008, but after making inflammatory racist comments, the Kentucky Libertarian party voted to withdraw his nomination.\n\nShane Black, Rick Hawkins\n\nThen: Director John McTiernan hired screenwriter Shane Black to play the role of Hawkins -- McTiernan wanted to keep Black close at hand to help oversee the 'Predator' script. Black wrote 'Lethal Weapon,' which was released the same year. During his free time on the set of 'Predator,' Black was working on his script for 'The Last Boy Scout.'"
