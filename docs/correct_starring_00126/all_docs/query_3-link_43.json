        "text": "Director Dan Trachtenberg described his Predator movie, Prey, as a “David and Goliath story” in a recent featurette. It’s an apt description, and not solely because it refers to the first Predator hunt on Earth, 300 years ago. It’s also because the Predator itself is a bit of a giant.\n\nActor Dane DiLiegro towers over Prey star Amber Midthunder at 6’8″. And that’s before you factor in the fully mechanized Predator head that sits atop DiLiegro’s own head.\n\nBloody Disgusting spoke with the actor to discuss what it was like to play the much more feral iteration of the iconic horror character, the extensive training it required, and more.\n\nFor starters, how did DiLiegro find his way into the role?\n\n“Our dear friend Alec Gillis over at ADI messaged me on Instagram and had me come in for the design pitch for a project they’re doing in Canada is what he told me,” he explains. “I walk in, and there’s the Predator costume on the table with this gray, 3D printed iteration of what a Predator’s head looks like. I’m like, ‘This is Predator. This is Predator. Oh my God.’\n\n“Dan, our director came in. Then Marty Ewing, our producer, and Jeff Cutter, our director of photography. They came into the studio, and I put this Predator suit on. Alec told me he wanted me to deliver a balletic svelteness to this character. They were making a bit of a departure from the traditional Predator. Balletic svelteness, Hmm. Okay. I’m thinking a panther, something feline, smoother, that’s very in tune with the forest. Feral was another word thrown around, primal, something very instinctual and very in tune with nature. He could run through trees naturally because he’s done it a million times, and he’s one with the woods and the forest. I tried to incorporate all those feelings and emotions; fast forward to me running around studio ADI, turning corners, jumping up on tables, doing little shifty things, and running through the parking lot.”\n\nThat svelteness factored into more than just movement for the actor.\n\n“I had to lose 25 pounds to play this character. They wanted a lean, dynamic, more animal Predator. You know you look at a feral cat; feral cats are not very plump. Traditionally I’m bigger, more muscular. I had to get away from that.“\n\nIn addition to slimming down, DiLiegro dedicated himself to training for the physically demanding part.\n\n“I trained for two months parkour. I’m 6′ 9″; not many 6′ 9” guys do parkour. I had to learn the basics of that. I trained in martial arts for two months. I trained my neck. I teamed up with a company called Iron Neck and strengthened my neck for two months because the Predator’s head sits on top of my head, and it’s a lot of weight on the neck. It was about 13 pounds or something. On top of all the acting, I did all the stunts and the motion capture.”\n\nLuckily, playing the film’s Predator didn’t require hours in the makeup chair. DiLiegro revealed that the process for transforming into the Feral character was more streamlined.\n\n“One body suit, with sleeves up to my neck and down to my ankles. In the beginning, the suit was a little bit tighter. We had six suits and four heads; in the beginning, it was tight foam latex. The more you wear it, the more you use it, the more you sweat in it, it starts to loosen up; get looser, nicer, easier to get in. So, you slide into the suit, get zipped up, hike it on your shoulders, put it on, and then put on the gloves, put on the feet, and then you’re ready to go to set. When you go to set, they set up the shot, and it’s time to shoot.\n\n“We would call it predification, ‘Can we predify Dane?’ They put the head on, and there’s a series of zips and snaps, and that was it. Maybe they would put a little glue on my back to keep the back flush, but that streamlined the process. We got it down by the end of the shoot. Like it was so quick.”\n\nDiLiegro also detailed how his head sat in the suit’s neck, with the mechanized Predator head atop, adding complicated layers to filming.\n\n“The visibility was minimal. My head’s in the neck. For this Predator to look forward, I had to look down at the ground, and there were two holes in the neck that I could look through. I couldn’t see more than three feet in front of me. Alec Gillis will kill me for using this word because he’s like, ‘I didn’t create a torture device.’ It wasn’t a torture device, but I was essentially blind. I couldn’t see the people in front of me, but it was an interesting challenge. We had to lay sticks on the ground for me to follow along.\n\n“Our first AD, Rich Cowan, would be in my ear with a speaker, and he would cue me on when to do certain things, like, ‘go, walk forward, shield and shield up.’ Now, the trappers are out here. I’m looking at the ground the whole time and ‘lower your shield, and then turn and walk.’ Everything, whatever it was. It was difficult to hear anything. Because one ear is blocked and there’s a lot of motors. There are 30 servos in the head of this character. So, you can hear all the motors moving for the mandibles.“\n\nThe physically demanding role requiring precision and multitasking with a limited scope of vision meant a lot of sweat for the actor. In turn, it added even more weight to the suit.\n\nHe explains, “I mean, three months up there in Canada. We went through it all. We’d start at about 70 pounds at the beginning of the day. And foam latex just absorbs. It’s a sponge because it’s foam. So, the sweat doesn’t go anywhere. It just fills up the suit, and the suit gets heavier and heavier and heavier and heavier. I’d go down to crouch, and sweat would shoot out of my knees. You can see in some of the production stills, if I’m swinging during a fight scene, you can see the sweat just shooting out of my sleeve of this character.”\n\nDiLiegro shared a fight scene that ultimately didn’t make the film, much to his relief.\n\n“There was a tree chase scene in the script; I saw it pre-vis. It eventually got cut; I’m not sure why. But we were going to be running on tree branches and jumping from branch to branch, me chasing [Amber Midthunder]. They ultimately removed that from principal photography. But I was very concerned because it would’ve been interesting to run on tree branches with the head on and wires and everything.”\n\nWhile the actor is now pursuing more human characters in addition to his creature work, horror remains at the top of his list. When asked about any monsters he’d love to play post-Predator, DiLiegro didn’t hesitate to share his dream role.\n\n‘When I moved to Los Angeles when I was hooked on only doing monsters, it was being a Predator and being Jason Voorhees. Jason Voorhees ties back even further into my childhood. I was him about four times for Halloween. That character is fascinating to me because he’s a big supernatural child, and his movements are minimalist and effective. I mean, just tilting your head a centimeter to the right tells a completely different story of this character, and being granted the challenge to create and tell a story through Jason’s eyes to the audience, non-verbally, would be so much fun. He’s huge. He’s menacing. He doesn’t give a shit. He wants to avenge his mom.\n\nDiLiegro adds, “I have no idea how I would go about even being considered for a role like that, but to have that opportunity, would be astounding and an honor as well.”\n\nAn eerie, threadbare stuffed bunny induced scares for the way it signaled the presence of ghosts in writer/director Damian McCarthy’s feature debut, 2021’s Caveat. The filmmaker ramps up the tension and scares in his follow-up, Oddity, another chill-inducing tale of supernatural revenge with one creepy mannequin at the center.\n\nOddity, releasing on July 19, stars Carolyn Bracken (You Are Not My Mother) as twin sisters Dani and Darcy. When Dani is brutally murdered at the remote country house that she’s renovating with her husband Ted (Gwilym Lee), the suspect dies soon after. But Darcy, a blind medium and oddity shop owner, arrives at Ted’s home a year later under the conviction that there’s more to Dani’s death than meets the eye; and she’s brought a creepy wooden mannequin with her to find the truth.\n\nWhile the mannequin is the centerpiece in McCarthy’s unsettling sophomore effort, look for the Caveat bunny on the shelves of Darcy’s shop. It’s not the only loose connection either; Caveat star Jonathan French also appears in Oddity in a different role. Considering the shared themes of supernatural karma and justice, it’s easy to infer a shared universe unfolding. In Oddity‘s case, though, it’s a wry wink from its filmmaker.\n\nIn a recent chat with McCarthy, the filmmaker explained why the drumming bunny from Caveat received an upgrade for its brief cameo in Oddity, and why it’s ultimately a tongue-in-cheek in joke.\n\nMcCarthy told Bloody Disgusting, “It is the same designer. It’s Lisa Zagone, who designed the Caveat bunny. I just wanted her to design something, so she designed it. It’s impossible to replicate what she did with that bunny. I mean, the bunny’s gone. I unfortunately don’t have it anymore, but she built what I was saying, ‘Okay, let’s make a hare that has symbols this time and something bigger and meaner.’ That was her brief. She’s got this fantastic way of designing things. So, it’s just a little nod to [Caveat]. More from my own amusement than anything, but yeah, nicely spotted.”\n\nOddity belongs to Darcy and her terrifying Wooden Man, one whose face is locked in a permanent scream with finger-sized holes in the back of its skull. McCarthy’s explanation behind the mannequin’s design highlights how much he was thinking about crafting effective scares in advance.\n\n“The initial idea was that I always wanted him screaming, because he’ll just look unsettling sitting there with a silent scream,” McCarthy said. “But then just to leave it open for sound design at the end, because when he finally starts doing things, it’s like, great, so if he looks like he’s screaming, it just means that anything then can be put in once we get to the sound design. And as you say, sound design is probably 70%, if not more, of a horror film. We didn’t have much time to design him at all. It was luckily through Paul McDonnell. I had just sent him a few drawings, a few real basic examples of what I wanted. Because we were so tight on time and very lucky to get Paul, it was just sitting down on Zoom with him, just watching him mold it.\n\n“He goes, ‘You’re going to have to be very decisive because whatever we’re doing today is what it’s going to be molded.’ Because it had to go to mold, our stunt man’s body was going to be molded to play the non-prop parts. There were a lot of like, ‘Okay, remove the nose. Okay, bring the nose back.’ Poor Paul, but it worked really well. But he did say, ‘Next time we’re working together, just give me a bit more time.’ It was a bit of a mad dash, but it worked. Maybe that’s why it worked so well because we didn’t have time to overthink it.”\n\nMore than just scares, McCarthy wanted to use the Wooden Man to toy with audience anticipation and act as a pressure release where needed, too.\n\n“The idea was it was never going to be a big, big tease of even what he looked like. There’s a little bit when Yana [played by Caroline Menton] and Darcy are moving around a little bit, you’re getting a glimpse of him at the table, but finally, he’s just there. He’s just out front and center. That was always the idea that he’s just there, and it might even become comedic because he’s just sitting there and you’d almost wonder whether he is going to lose any kind of a threat because we’re so used to looking at him, by the time he finally does something. There were little things that we shot; that classic trope of his head moving left and right, and he’s looking at different things. We teased it a little bit, but no, in the end, once we really started locking the edit, it was actually funnier and just a little creepier if he just does nothing. He’s just sitting there, and the audience is going, ‘Is anything going to happen?'”\n\nOddity does have a playful attitude, but it’s not a horror-comedy. While there are occasional laughs to break up the tension, McCarthy’s latest brings the scares. For the filmmaker, it’s as much about making sure his audience is entertained as they are terrified.\n\nOn finding that line between horror and comedy, McCarthy shares, “I never try to intentionally be funny, heaven forbid, but it’s just, I think if you try to make a film that’s so serious, if it took itself so seriously, then it just becomes an unintentional comedy because it’s like we have to take this so seriously that there’s that thing of trying not to laugh then. If you allow the audience to laugh and just have the characters a little bit dry, some of the stuff that’s coming out of their mouth is quite droll, and some of their comments are cutting to each other; I think it helps. It’s just a bit more entertaining, as opposed to having all the dialogue be super serious.”\n\nHe continues, “I tried to do the same with Caveat. I put stuff in Caveat that I find quite funny, but because Jonathan’s on his own for so much of it. At one stage, that corpse has a bag on her head, and it moves around, and there’s a hole, and it’s great because anybody who laughs at that knows that that’s clearly not supposed to be serious. It’s like the old Sam Raimi rule that your number one goal in making a film should be to entertain. Just try to make it as funny as it can be, and it should just help the horror because it’s such a fine line between horror and comedy anyway.“"
