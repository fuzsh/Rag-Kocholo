        "text": "Elle Fanning is set to lead Badlands, a new standalone movie in the Predator franchise.\n\nPer Deadline, Fanning is set to star in the pic from Prey director Dan Trachtenberg. Screenwriter Patrick Aison will once again pen the script.\n\nTrachtenberg's Prey is the fifth installment in the Predator franchise and serves as a prequel to the first four movies, providing an origin story for the trophy-hunting species. A departure from its male-dominated predecessors, the film sees an indigenous female protagonist (played by Amber Midthunder) go up against the alien hunters.\n\nBadlands is set to serve as its own Predator film with the studio hoping to launch a new, separate series. A direct sequel to Prey, tentatively titled Prey 2, is reportedly still in development with Midthunder set to return. Though Prey was a Hulu exclusive, setting a streaming record for most-watched debut, it's possible that 20th Century will continue its string of theatrical releases and give Badlands a wide or limited run.\n\nDeadline also reported that Fanning is a fan of the franchise and was on board after a meeting with Trachtenberg. A deal has not yet been closed, but \"momentum is expected to pick up with the hope to shoot later this year.\"\n\nFanning received a Golden Globe nomination for her portrayal of Catherine The Great in the historical comedy The Great. The actor is currently filming the Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown where she plays Sylvie Russo, Dylan's early, pre-frame love interest."
