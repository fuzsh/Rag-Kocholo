        "text": "5. \"The Predator\" (2018)\n\nThis sequel has a very unique group of actors making up the cast, including Boyd Holbrook, Olivia Munn, Keegan-Michael Key, Thomas Jane, Trevante Rhodes, Sterling K. Brown, and Jacob Tremblay (yes, the kid from \"Room\").\n\nPlus, it's directed by Shane Black, who not only starred in the original movie (he played Hawkins) but also was responsible for some of the rewrites done to the 1987 movie.\n\nDespite all that, the movie is awful.\n\nWe don't care about the main characters, and even worse, the Predator aliens are laughable, especially the super buff one.\n\nIt's just best we never speak of this movie again.\n\n4. \"Predators\" (2010)\n\nOnce more, an interesting mix of actors makes up the ensemble: Adrien Brody, Topher Grace, Walton Goggins, Alice Braga, Danny Trejo, Mahershala Ali, and Laurence Fishburne.\n\nThey all star as people who have been placed on a planet that is a gaming ground for Predators.\n\nNow, they have to fight their way to figure out how to get back to Earth.\n\nThe story, created by Robert Rodriguez back in the 1990s, is the movie in the franchise that doesn't get enough respect. It's clever and there are some great performances. Seek it out.\n\n2. \"Predator 2\" (1990)\n\nThe people who say \"Prey\" is the best \"Predator\" movie since the original need to go back and watch the first sequel in this franchise.\n\nWritten by the creators of the character, Jim and John Thomas, and starring a great cast, the movie is a gem in genre filmmaking.\n\nSet in Los Angeles in 1997 during a heat wave, the Predator shows up and completely overpowers the drug cartel scene. This leads Danny Glover's Lieutenant Harrigan character and his team to figure out who the new player in town is.\n\nIt ends with an amazing ending onboard a Predator ship that rivals the fantastic conclusion of the original.\n\n1. \"Predator\" (1987)\n\nWhat can you say about the original that hasn't been said already?\n\nDirected by the great action director John McTiernan, written by Jim and John Thomas, and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger at the peak of his stardom, the movie is a masterpiece in the action genre.\n\nThe secret sauce of this movie, and what the franchise has attempted to replicate time and again, is the great ensemble. With the casting of the likes of Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura, and Sonny Landham, they elevate the brotherhood of the group and the fear of these men trying to face an unknown evil.\n\nAnd we can't leave out Alan Silvestri's amazing score, which also elevated the movie to icon status."
