        "text": "Predator is back in cinemas this month to mark the iconic action movie’s 30th anniversary.\n\nEven now, its testosterone-fuelled tale of an elite special forces team coming face to face with a technologically advanced alien remains tense, riveting viewing.\n\nBut events behind-the-scenes were just as tough as those depicted on camera.\n\nThanks to arduous filming conditions and technical difficulties, it tested the patience of its star, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and put Jean-Claude Van Damme through hell in pre-production.\n\nTo catch a Predator\n\nPredator’s creature became an instantly recognisable movie monster on release. But it wasn’t always so convincing.\n\nThe original design was more along the lines of a giant insect; cumbersome and difficult to manage in the jungle environments used for filming.\n\nAction-star Jean-Claude Van Damme was originally cast to star as the Predator opposite Schwarzenegger, but according to special effects expert Steve Johnson, “he had no idea what he was getting into”.\n\nVan Damme thought he could show his martial arts abilities to the world and fight Schwarzenegger. “He didn’t realise he was just a stunt man,” said Johnson. “He was so angry.”\n\nBaffled by the bright red costume he was asked to wear – used to achieve the cloaking device effect, which he thought was the final look of the monster – Van Damme also complained of excessive heat inside the suit.\n\nThe role was recast when producers realised they needed a more physically imposing man to square up to Schwarzenegger. The extremely tall Kevin Peter Hall got the part, and the suit was redesigned.\n\nSticking around\n\nSchwarzenegger’s previous commitments meant that the start of filming was delayed for several months.\n\nOnce production got underway, the film struggled to keep the action hero in one place.\n\nIn April 1986, filming was put on hold while Schwarzenegger flew to Massachusetts to get married.\n\nEven when filming was up and running smoothly, it certainly wasn’t easy.\n\nNight scenes proved to be problematic, involving Schwarzenegger swimming in cold water, the low temperatures exacerbated by Mexican jungle.\n\nHe also had to spend three weeks covered in pottery clay – used as a substitute for mud – which became cold and wet. The heat lamps needed to keep the star warm between takes just dried it out.\n\nThe actor shivered constantly, and things became so desperate that he resorted to drinking schnapps to keep warm.\n\n‘A survival story for all of us’\n\nSchwarzenegger complained in a 1987 interview with sci-fi film magazine Cinefantastique that shooting was “always on a hill”.\n\n“One leg down, one leg up. It was terrible,” he said.\n\nHall, as the Predator, had his own unique challenges. He was essentially blind when in costume, the design of the creature obscuring his eyes.\n\nThis proved especially difficult when shooting physical scenes with Schwarzenegger.\n\n“He’s supposed to slap me around and stay far from my face,” Schwarzenegger told Cinefantastique. “All of a sudden, whap! There is this hand with claws on it!”\n\nWhy filming Terminator 2 was ‘hell’ for Arnold Schwarzenegger’s stunt double\n\nHall said the making of the movie was “a survival story for all of us.”\n\nOne scene where the Predator chases Schwarzenegger’s special forces leader was shot in stagnant water full of leeches.\n\nHall – unable to see out of the mask – rehearsed his scenes with it removed, memorising where everything was so that he could replicate his movements with it back on.\n\nThe production of Predator was certainly an eventful one.\n\nCumbersome character suits at the mercy of the elements. Stories of bodybuilding contests (the actors would reportedly wake up at 3am to secretly work out).\n\nSchwarzenegger even suffered food poisoning during shooting.\n\n“While I was on a run, the runs hit,” he revealed, in a Reddit Q&A.\n\nIn turn, at least, the star became synonymous with a genuine action classic. Even if he was put through a similar ordeal to his on-screen hero.\n\nPredator is re-released in cinemas on November 9"
