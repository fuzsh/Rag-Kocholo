        "text": "blog post #66 by Science Fiction Author Clara Bush\n\nThanksgiving! Family Invasion! Turkey! Cranberries! And classic science fiction film!\n\nFor today’s blog I found a YouTube video since all parties involved—I feel sure—are busy with the holidays. Not much time for reading lengthy blogs or researching. (Overseas readers, I apologize. I know you don’t celebrate Thanksgiving.)\n\nIn Blog post #64, we talked about the similarity between the sounds emitted from Comet 67P and the sound made by the extraterrestrail alien in the 1987 classic science fiction movie, The Predator.\n\nWhile surfing YouTubes, I found this video which was released in memory of Kevin Peter Hall (1955-1991). Hall portrayed the Predator. He died from aids related pneumonia contracted from a blood transfusion. He was only thirty-five years old—such a short life for such a talented man. I found the discussions on his Predator wardrobe/make-up and his personality fascinating. I hope you do also.\n\nCome On Down\n\nWinner of the October/November comment posts is DilloBoi!!! Email me your prize choice and I will send you your prize. (Use the little envelop, at the top right hand corner of the page, to email me.)\n\nThank you everyone for participating and commenting. Last month’s names will remain in the magic jar for the November/December drawing.\n\nMy little Ninja Ghost was present today to draw the winner from the magic jar.\n\n***\n\nKeep the comments coming.\n\nToday’s Question: Do you enjoy the occasional YouTube or hate it on a blog?\n\nI love hearing from you.\n\nThe Magic Jar\n\nDesigned by Ninja Ghost\n\nTo prove I love hearing from you, for those who share a comment, your name will be placed into THE MAGIC JAR. If you comment and link back to my blog from your blog, your name will be placed in the magic jar twice. On December 29, 2014, my alien friend ( or ghost) (or Walk-In) (or whoever is hanging around at the time) will reach into the jar and pull forth a name. That person can claim one of the following:\n\n1. A Wyso/Danny ring handcrafted by my Native American friend, Neal Paquin of Santa Fe, NM, especially designed for my first novella, Wyso and the Other Creepy Kids on Gerard Street. (Picture below.) Sizes for children, women, and men. (Best choice. Simple. Elegant. One of a kind design.)\n\n2. A $20 gift certificate to Amazon via email.\n\n3. My opinion of the first twenty pages of your novel or novella. (Not that my opinion is worth anything, but it is someone else’s opinion. Something I look for every chance I get. Just thought you might be looking also.)"
