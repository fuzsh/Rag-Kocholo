        "text": "RIP Carl Weathers\n\nHollywood star Carl Weathers passed away aged 76. Best known for playing nemesis-turned-ally Apollo Creed in the 'Rocky' movies, he also essayed the role of Dillon in the iconic 'Predator' movie. Here are the other artists to feature in the 1987 movie. | AP\n\nAl Dillon\n\nCarl Weathers essayed the role of the man responsible for putting Dutch's men in harm's way. A Vietnam War buddy of the Major, Dutch had no idea that Dillan was pushing pen for CIA ahead of the South American mission. | Facebook/PredatorFOX\n\nAnna Gonsalves\n\nMexican Elpidia Carrillo (62) played the role of the insurgent detained by Dutch's men. She makes it out of the forest alive to make an appearance in the movie's sequel. In fact, Elpidia’s character is the only recurring character in the entire 'Predator' franchise! | Facebook/PredatorFOX\n\nStaff Sergeant Jorge \"Poncho\" Ramírez\n\nA Vietnam war veteran in real life, 72-year-old Richard Chaves was the last of Dutch's men to be taken down by the alien. Poncho talked less and did as asked by his Major. Chaves's grenade launcher from the movie is epic alongside Blain's minigun. | Facebook/PredatorFOX\n\nSergeant Blain Cooper\n\n72-year-old Jesse Ventura is a former WWF, who gave away his Hollywood career to become a politician. The former Governor of Minnesota was the heavy gunner in Dutch's team. | Facebook/PredatorFOX\n\nMaster Sergeant Mac Eliot\n\nBill Duke is now 80. Talking about the movie, he once told Hollywood Reporter: “We’re talking about 90-something or more. We’re talking about having to wear this gear that is heavy itself, and then the guns and stuff, and mine was like a gun off a battleship machine gun. So you’re carrying your bodyweight, you have clothing on, and then you’re crawling through the jungle on your stomach and there are coral snakes and spiders and scorpions and a lot of different things.” | Facebook/PredatorFOX\n\nSergeant Billy Sole\n\nSonny Landham passed away in 2017, aged 76. Billy was the badass of Dutch's crew -- the first to identify the presence of a non-human beast in the future. The scout admitted he was scared and later decided to take the beast head-on to give his team a shot at escape. | Facebook/PredatorFOX\n\nSergeant Rick Hawkins\n\nDirector Shane Black (62) played the radio operator of the crew who was the first victim of the alien's onslaught. Black's connection with the 'Predator' franchise didn't end with the movie as he went on to direct 'The Predator' in 2018.'Edge', 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang' and 'Iron Man 3' are some of his other notable films. | Twitter\n\nPredator movie trivia:\n\nRemember the pilot of the helicopter with Anna onboard that comes back to get Dutch? The guy in pilot gear was Kevin Peter Hall, who dressed up as the violent alien! | Twitter"
