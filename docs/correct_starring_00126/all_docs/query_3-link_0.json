        "text": "American actor (1955–1991)\n\nFor persons of a similar name, see Kevin Hall (disambiguation).\n\nKevin Peter Hall (May 9, 1955 – April 10, 1991) was an American actor. Hall stood 7 ft 2 in (2.18 m) tall,[1] and frequently played monster characters during his career. He was the original title character in the science fiction Predator franchise, appearing in the first 1987 film and its 1990 sequel. Hall also portrayed the eponymous Harry in the fantasy comedy film Harry and the Hendersons (1987), a role he reprised for the first season of NBC's television adaptation (1990–1991). His human roles included Dr. Elvin \"El\" Lincoln on the NBC science fiction series Misfits of Science (1985–1986) and Warren Merriwether on the sitcom 227 (1989–1990).\n\nHall was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Hall came from a tall family. His father, Charles Hall, stood 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m), and his mother, Sylvia, stood 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m). At 7 ft 2 in (2.18 m), Hall was the tallest of his brothers, all of whom were at least 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m) tall.[2]\n\nDuring his high school years at Penn Hills High School, he was a star basketball player. He subsequently attended George Washington University in Washington, D.C., where he played for its basketball team and majored in Theatrical Arts.[3]\n\nAfter graduation, Hall moved to Venezuela to play professional basketball.\n\nDue to Hall's height, he was often cast in monster roles. He made his acting debut in the 1979 horror film Prophecy. He appeared as the alien in the 1980 horror film Without Warning and as Gorvil in the 1982 television movie Mazes and Monsters. In 1985, he co-starred in the short-lived series Misfits of Science. He guest-starred on the sitcom Night Court as a huge but gentle mental patient who humorously towered over bailiff Bull Shannon, played by Richard Moll, who is 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m), and a fellow mental patient, played by James Cromwell, who is 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m). The next year, Hall portrayed yet another monster in the horror film Monster in the Closet, followed by the role of Harry, the Bigfoot, in Harry and the Hendersons.\n\nIn 1986, Hall was cast as the main antagonist in Predator, opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers and Jesse Ventura. During its developmental stages, the Predator was going to be played by Jean-Claude Van Damme, who played the Predator for the first few scenes, but was uncredited in the end credits. The producers decided to recast the role with Hall so that the Predator could more convincingly dominate the film's human characters with its greater size. Hall also appeared unmasked as a helicopter pilot at the end of the film. Hall would go on to reprise the role in the 1990 sequel, this time opposite Danny Glover and Gary Busey.\n\nFollowing his role in Predator, Hall appeared in the feature film Big Top Pee-wee (1988) and had a guest spot on Star Trek: The Next Generation; Hall had been one of the actors considered for the role of Geordi La Forge on the latter, before the role went to LeVar Burton.[4] From 1989 to 1990, he had a recurring role on the NBC sitcom 227. In 1990, Hall reprised his role as Harry in the television series Harry and the Hendersons, based on the 1987 film of the same name. He died during the series' first season.\n\nHall met actress Alaina Reed while taping a guest role on the television show 227. The couple would marry both on the show and in real life.[5]\n\nWhile working on the TV series Harry and the Hendersons, Hall announced that he had contracted HIV from a blood transfusion during surgery for injuries he sustained in a car accident.[6][7] He died from AIDS-related pneumonia on April 10, 1991, a month short of his 36th birthday.[8][9]\n\nHall was posthumously inducted into the Penn Hills Hall of Fame as part of the inaugural class on May 8, 2009.[10]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1979 Prophecy Mutant bear Uncredited 1980 Without Warning The Alien Credited as Kevin Hall 1982 One Dark Night Eddie 1982 Mazes and Monsters Gorvil Television Movie 1984 The Wild Life Bouncer Credited as Kevin Hall 1984 E/R Donald Haines Episode: \"Mr. Fix-It\" 1985 Night Court Wendell Martin Episode: \"Nuts About Harry\" 1985 The Dukes of Hazzard Floyd Malone Episode: \"Opening Night at the Boar's Nest\" 1985–1986 Misfits of Science Dr. Elvin \"El\" Lincoln 16 episodes 1986 Monster in the Closet Monster 1987 Harry and the Hendersons Harry 1987 Predator The Predator, Helicopter pilot Double role 1988 Big Top Pee-wee Big John 1989 Rodney Dangerfield: Opening Night at Rodney's Place Richard Small Television special 1989 Shannon's Deal Harry Television movie 1989 Star Trek: The Next Generation Leyor Episode: \"The Price\" 1989–1990 227 Warren Merriwether 11 episodes 1990 Predator 2 The Predator, Elder Predator Double role 1990–1991 Harry and the Hendersons Harry Main role 1992 Highway to Hell Charon Final film role\n\nList of tallest people\n\nBiography portal"
