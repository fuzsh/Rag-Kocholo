        "text": "There were many unique things about Kevin PeterHalle; the US actor popular as the title character in the first two films in the Predator franchise. One of them is that Hall was so big that he acted very well as a monster. In addition to playing the title character in the first two films in the Predator series, Hall has also starred in The Prophecy, Without Warning, the Outsider of Science and Harry and the Hendersons.\n\nUnfortunately we weren’t able to see more of this magnificent actor when he died in 1991 at the age of thirty-five; how great was he, the cause of his death, wealth at the time of his death, and more. Here you will find answers to the above and other questions.\n\nShort bio\n\nHall was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to Charles and Sylvia Hall on May 9, 1955. Both his parents and his siblings were taller than average. They all stood over 20 cm. Kevin Peter remained the tallest of them all.\n\nKevin Peter Hall attended Penn Hills High School, where he played basketball. After graduating from high school, he attended George Washington University in Washington, DC, where he majored in drama and also played college basketball. After graduating from college, Hall moved to Venezuela, where he played basketball. However, after a year, he lost interest in the game and moved to Los Angeles, California, where he began his acting career.\n\ncareer\n\nHall made his acting debut in the 1979 horror film Prophecy As Katahdin, and due to his size, he was always cast as a monster or alien. In 1980 he played the alien in the horror film Without Warning and in 1982 he appeared as Gorvil in the television film Mazes and Monsters.\n\nHe co-starred in the superhero fantasy series Science Outsiders which aired on NBC from October 1985 to February 1986. He also appeared in the sitcom Night Court. They played a giant, gentle mental patient who humorously rose above bailiff Bull Shannon (Richard Moll) and another mentally ill man, played by James Cromwell.\n\nThe following year, Kevin Peter Hall again played the monster in Monsters in the Closet and Harry and the Hendersons. In 1986, he landed the role of the Predator/helicopter pilot in the sci-fi horror film Predator, opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger. The role of Hall was originally filled by Jean-Claude Van Damme, but the producers decided to replace him with Hall and recast him after not being too happy with Van Damme’s performances in the opening scenes. He reprized the role in the 1990 sequel, this time alongside Gary Busey and Danny Glover.\n\nKevin’s performance in the Predator landed him a role in the 1988 comedy film A Big Top Pee-Wee and a guest-on-location Star Trek: The Next Generation ; Hall was considered for the role of Geordi La Forge before finally moving on to LeVar Burton.\n\nFrom 1989–90, Hall repeatedly played Warren Merriwether on the sitcom 227 ; He reprized the character Harry in the television series Harry and the Hendersons that same year\n\nWealth (income and earnings)\n\nThere is no information about how much the actorwas worth at the time of his death. Considering he was the actor behind so many horror characters in films of his time, there is no doubt that Kevin Peter Hall must have been alive.\n\nKevin Peter Hall Height\n\nHall was the tallest of seven brothers, all of whom ever stood over 6 feet 5 inches (1.96 m). He was 7 feet 2 inches tall, that is (2.18 m). His parents were also above average; his father Charles was 1.98 m tall and his mother Sylvia was 1.88 m tall. You could call it a family of semi-giants, and you wouldn’t be entirely wrong.\n\nWas he gay or did he have a wife?\n\nLearning that the actor always died of AIDS caused people to ask if he was gay; Well, not because straight people aren’t susceptible to contracting the virus, but because gay people are largely at a higher risk of contracting the virus. Kevin Peter Hall wasn’t gay; He actually had a wife before his death.\n\nWhile guest-starring on the TV series 227, the actor met actress Alaina Reed, whom he married both on the show and in real life. The couple married in December 1988; They had been together barely three years when Kevin died. They had two children together. Reed died in 2009 at the age of 63 after losing a battle with breast cancer.\n\nAlso Read About: Life And Death Of Michael Clarke Duncan His Wife Net Worth How Did He Die?\n\ndeath\n\nIn 1990, while filming the television series Harry and the Hendersons, Kevin Peter Hall, revealed that he had contracted HIV during a blood transfusion he received after a car accident.
