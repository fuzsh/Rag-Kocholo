Why they come?\n\nWhy they come? Why they come?\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nAnd why she losin' so much weight?\n\nI heard it's from the drugs she ate\n\nAnd I feel her, but I can't relate\n\n'Cause I'd never end up in that state\n\nA girl like that is a mother, must be tough\n\nA problem child, I was rough\n\nBut what do you do with a difficult grownup?\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n\nWhen I die, I won't have time to spend my money\n\nBut I hope that you still love me (Da-da-da-da, da-da-mm)\n\n[Chorus]\n\n'Cause I'm so lucky (I'm so lucky), I'm a star\n\nBut I cry, cry, cry in my lonely heart, thinkin'\n\n\"If there's nothin' missin' in my life\n\nThen why do these tears come at night?\"\n\n[Bridge]\n\nI shaved my head four times because I wanted to\n\nAnd then I did it one more time 'cause I got sick (I am so lucky)\n\nAnd I thought I changed so much, nobody would notice it, and no one did\n\nThen I left the doctor's office full of tears\n\nBecame a single mom at my premiere\n\nAnd I told everybody I was fine for a whole damn year\n\nAnd that's the biggest lie of my career\n\n[Chorus]\n\nBut I'm so lucky, I'm a star\n\nAnd I cry, cry, cry in my lonely heart, thinkin'\n\n\"If there's nothin' missin' in my life\n\nThen why do these tears come at night?\"\n\nI'm so lucky, I'm a star\n\nBut I cry, cry, cry in my lonely heart, thinkin'\n\n\"If there's nothin' missin' in my life\n\nThen why do these tears come at night?\"\n\n[Outro]\n\nShe's so lucky, she's so lucky\n\nShe's so lucky, she's so\n\nHaven't you heard?"
