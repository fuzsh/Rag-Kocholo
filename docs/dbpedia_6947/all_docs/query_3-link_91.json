        "text": "American football season\n\nThe 2022 season was the Jacksonville Jaguars' 28th season in the National Football League (NFL) and their first under head coach Doug Pederson.\n\nFollowing a 3–14 season marked with on-and off-the-field issues by head coach Urban Meyer who ultimately got fired, the Jaguars were one of the most active teams in free agency during the offseason and spent a record $175.3 million in guaranteed money, with the notable additions of Christian Kirk, Zay Jones, Brandon Scherff, Evan Engram, Foyesade Oluokun, Darious Williams and Folorunso Fatukasi. They earned the first overall pick for the second straight year in the 2022 NFL draft, which they used to select defensive end Travon Walker from Georgia.\n\nDespite a 3–7 start, the Jaguars won six of their final seven games, tripling their win total from 2021, including finishing the season on a five-game winning streak to win their fourth division title and second AFC South title after a Week 18 win over the Tennessee Titans, securing their first playoff berth since 2017. They also became the second team in NFL history after the 2008 San Diego Chargers to start 4–8 and make the playoffs.\n\nIn the Wild Card round, the Jaguars rallied from a 27–0 deficit to defeat the Los Angeles Chargers 31–30. It was the largest comeback in franchise history and the third largest in NFL postseason history. However, their season would end the following week with a 27–20 loss to the eventual Super Bowl LVII champion Kansas City Chiefs in the Divisional round.\n\nOffseason\n\n[edit]\n\nNFL draft\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: 2022 NFL draft\n\n2022 Jacksonville Jaguars draft Round Selection Player Position College Notes 1 1 Travon Walker DE Georgia 27 Devin Lloyd LB Utah from Tampa Bay[A] 2 33 Traded to Tampa Bay[A] 3 65 Luke Fortner C Kentucky 70 Chad Muma LB Wyoming from Carolina[B] 4 106 Traded to Tampa Bay[A] 5 144 Traded to Carolina[B] 154 Snoop Conner RB Ole Miss from Washington via Philadelphia[C] 157 Traded to Tampa Bay[D] from Minnesota[E] 6 180 Traded to Tampa Bay[A] 188 Traded to Philadelphia[C] from Seattle[F] 197 Gregory Junior CB Ouachita Baptist from Philadelphia[G] 198 Traded to Philadelphia[C] from Pittsburgh[H] 7 222 Montaric Brown CB Arkansas 235 Traded to Tampa Bay[D] from Baltimore[I]\n\nDraft trades\n\nUndrafted free agents\n\n[edit]\n\nName Position College Ref.
