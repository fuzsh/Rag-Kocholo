        "text": "MRMUSICPUBLISHER IS JAMES L. JACKSON\n\nJames Jackson is an award-winning music publisher, a Detroit native, with over 30 years of experience. Jackson’s affinity for numbers, love of music and passion for songs makes music publishing the perfect fit. His robust career and deep understanding of the music business is anchored from his early taste of studio life being an errand runner at Detroit’s legendary United Sound Recording studios, which was a few blocks away from his childhood home. The USR studios was the home to some of the all-time music greats from Barney “Boneyard” Perkins, George Clinton, Aretha Franklin, Bernie Worrell to Northern high’s Dramatics.\n\nJames said, “growing up in the D there were so many different sounds coming at me, Gospel, Blues, Jazz, R&B, Rock and so much more. My older brother, Charles, introduced me to so much as he bought new music every Friday. But, in the 70’s, it was the Sound of Philly Soul that moved me along with the world-renowned Detroit Symphony Orchestra, which was one of the first school trips; in which, I felt music was in my soul and all throughout my bones.”\n\nAfter university and a brief stint in the NFL, Jackson landed a job with Proctor and Gamble and was the lead product manager for the launch and roll out of Liquid Tide for the Black community. James used his love of music to attract his targeted audience and draw them in so he could introduce them to the new and innovative product of liquid detergent. He learned and witnessed the impact of using music as a marketing tool when he hired musicians and DJs to play on a flat bed truck and do sampling giveaways and coupons.\n\nIn the mid -80’s, Jackson was on the ground floor of Detroit’s techno scene working with techno’s architects, Eddie “Flash” Fowlkes , James Pennington and Jaun Atkins. He paid for the initial pressing of Inner City’s smash evergreen hit, “Big Fun.” Straight from the ‘Godfather of Techno,’ Juan Atkins, “James help give birth to techno as a business because he paid for the first 500 pressings of “Big Fun,” and was the one who structured the first commercial recording and distribution deals with Virgin for Inner City while crafting a deal with Polygram for the club classic, “Take Me Away,” by Final Cut featuring Bridgette Grace.”\n\nMaking things happen in Detroit and traveling back and forth to NYC then enters the “King of Promo,” Joey Bonner, a pioneer of radio promotions. Bonner’s career jumpstarted from handling on the road promotions for Anthony and the Imperials. Jackson has a special place in his heart for Joey Bonner. “Joey B knew everyone and was a legend widely respected. There was no station or label head that did not know Joey. He heard about me and gave me a call telling me…. son, you out here slinging Tide and you could be slinging records, let me show you the ropes and that he did.” Moreover, Joey B recognized that James did not enjoy the record promotions even though he was good at his job. After James told Joey that he believed that music publishing is an area he was interested in pursuing, in true Bonner fashion, he made a call and told some friends that Jackson was a solid choice to jumpstart anything.\n\nMCA Music Publishing is where Jackson landed as the National Senior Director of Black Music. He found his stride quickly and gained the reputation for having great ears, being aggressive, pulling the trigger before his competition, knowing the numbers for a great win-win deal, getting in early, utilizing untapped resources, and a genius for identifying great talent even when the talent or record company didn’t see them as a writer.\n\nIn 2020 and MrMusicPublisher’s track record is still rock solid with a portfolio of signings that are now hailed the crème de la crème in the music publishing world, but then were just emerging hitmakers.\n\nFor instance, the talent magnet, manager extraordinaire and hit songwriter, Kevin Wales, introduced James to the ATL scene before Atlanta was considered the talent hotbed it is now with hits with the Boys, ABC, TLC, 112 and so many more. Another early signing for James was INTRO's, Kenny Greene, who wrote and produced multiple songs on the recording debut for Mary J. Blige, the iconic multi-platinum, “What’s the 411?” Jackson signed MJB before others believed in her as a song writer just a month in on the release of her debut. In fact, Jackson had that album sewed up with his MCA Music Publishing squad. Again, proving to be the first in the ring and recognizing talent quickly he continued building with the inking of Aaron Hall of GUY before the debut GUY album was released on Uptown Records along with Carl Martin of Shai coupled with the genius producer, Prince Paul, of the legendary first hip hop band, Stetsasonic. Prince Paul touched so much in the golden era from The Jungle Brothers, De La Soul, ATCQ, L.O.N.S, BDP, MC Lyte, to Brand Nubian and Poor Righteous Teachers, just to name a few. James’ roster steadily blossomed with RFTW’s (Ready for The World) Melvin Riley, DJ Muggs of Cypress Hill and House of Pain notoriety, as well as \"The Smooth Operator” himself, Big Daddy Kane.\n\nArmed with his packaging and business experience at Proctor and Gamble, Jackson knew how viable it was to nurture partnerships with other greats through joint ventures. His JVs brought such notables as: 1st Priority Records, the home, of AudioTwo and MC Lyte; Soul Convention Records which gave him the dynamic duo, of Mark & Cory. Mark “Prince Markie Dee” Morales, of the Fat Boys and Cory Rooney, songwriter/producer added hits from Michael Jackson, Aretha Franklin, Mariah Carey, Marc Anthony, R Kelly, MJB, to Jennifer Lopez. Another joint venture was done with SOLID Productions anchored by Henrik Milling, b/k/a ‘Doctor Jam.’ This venture was ideal for the MCA culture because SOLID was a true songwriting force having hits on every Billboard chart with records ranging from Ice Cube, Vanessa Williams, Ultra Magnetic MCs and Johnny Gill at the same time! Jackson made sure the MCA portfolio was robust and deep bringing in some radio, easy-listening jazz with the signing of the Huggins Brother’s, Bush Burnin Music catalog, home to Najee, Alex Bugnon, Freddie Jackson, Melba Moore and the hit song writer, Paul Laurence, who was penning songs for Whitney Houston and others.\n\nBeing ahead of the curve, getting in early, remembering that ‘it all begins with a song,’ all night studio sessions, ripping and running and nurturing talent proved to be a winning formula for James was awarded ASCAP’s R&B Music Publisher of the Year. He also managed to guide Marcus Miller while Miller worked with Luther Vandross and help focus and shape Alanis Morrisette’s writing when she came to MCA Publishing.\n\nJackson’s steam proved to be hotter than fish grease and his song placements hotter. The placement of the Sweet Sable jam, “Old Time’s Sake, produced by another James signing, female hip hop producer pioneer, Nikke Nicole, on the multi-platinum, soundtrack, “Above the Rim,” still stands the test of time.\n\nHis success sounded the alarm for newly appointed Chairman of Motown, Jheryl Busby, and the Godfather of Black Music himself, Clarence Avant to hand-pick MrMusicPublisher to run the newly created Motown Music Publishing in their partnership with Polygram.\n\nAs Vice President and General Manager of Motown Music Publisher, James strikes immediately with the signing of Kenny Whitehead of the Whitehead Brothers. Whitehead’s presence on the successful Jason’s Lyric soundtrack brought Kenny to James’ attention as a writer and producer. A meeting was set in Philadelphia where James discovered Kenneth had an album of hits ready to go. So, Kenny Whitehead from Philly Soul royalty was signed and the world gained the cult classics, “Your Love is A 187” and “Forget I was A G.” Kenny went on to write and produce for Queen Latifah, Marques Houston, Silk, LSG and Total, among others. Jackson added to his Motown roster songwriter, Travon Potts, who worked with MJB, BeBe Winans, Kenny Latimore and Christina Aguilera. Jackson flavored the pot by signing Tony C who brought to the portfolio, Bones, Thugs & Harmony.\n\nAfter, Motown, James founded MrMusicPublisher, where he puts his passion first and foremost and reminds everyone who will listen that “it all begins with a song.” He continues to be the songwriter, producer’s champion while advocating for their rights and often helping our legends sort their publishing business out.\n\nHe is now set on sharing his knowledge and making sure there is pipeline of young professionals of color armed and learned in music publishing with the creation of MrMusicPublisherAcademy.\n\nJames continues to serve creatives, rights holders through MrMusicPublisher.com doing valuations, consultations, copyright terminations and representing several estates from B B King, McFadden & Whitehead, Ness, Nitty, Capone Music, Deep Space Music and a host of others as well as serving as Kevin Hart's HartBeat Music President."
