We talk through biblical literacy, how to find hope when your pain doesn't make sense, and having permission to wrestle with God.\n\nWe had Lisa on the podcast two years ago to dive into her work with Jude 3 Project. We talked about why it is necessary to have Black leaders in theological spaces, to truly listen to people’s questions, and to hold a humble hermeneutic. So, you definitely want to go back and listen!\n\nGrab a copy of Lisa's book today! https://amzn.to/3yqUsZT\n\nHost & Executive Producer - Latasha Morrison\n\nProducer - Sarah Connatser\n\nProducer, Editor, & Music - Travon Potts with ⁠Integrated Entertainment Studios⁠\n\nGospel artist, pastor, and entrepreneur Tasha Cobbs Leonard joins Latasha Morrison on the Be the Bridge Podcast to talk about her debut book, Do It Anyway: Don’t Give Up Before It Gets Good.\n\nAt Be the Bridge, we talk about hope often. It is what pushes us onward and allows us to persevere. Tasha Cobbs Leonard vulnerably shares parts of her story that will inspire and empower others. She offers hope to our community!\n\nAbout Tasha Cobbs Leonard:\n\nA pastor’s daughter born and raised in Georgia, Leonard first emerged to widespread acclaim with her breakout 2013 release, Grace, which garnered a GRAMMY, three Doves, and three Stellar Awards on the strength of its chart-topping, platinum-selling lead single, “Break Every Chain.” In the years that followed, Leonard would go on to establish herself as a genuine “gospel sensation” (NPR), racking up more than two billion streams across platforms, landing three more #1 singles and five #1 albums, performing with everyone from Common and Nicki Minaj to Ne-Yo and Ciara, and making national television appearances on Good Morning America, CNN’s Fourth of July, BET’s Black Girls Rock, CBC’s A Day Of Healing, and the Super Bowl Gospel Celebration.\n\nA tireless advocate for empowerment and positivity, Leonard has also risen to success as an author, actress, entrepreneur, and worship leader at The Purpose Place Church in her adopted home of South Carolina, where she co-pastors with her husband and producer, Kenneth Leonard, Jr.\n\nWe are thrilled to have author, speaker, perpetual theology student, and co-host of The Holy Post Podcast, Kaitlyn Schiess join the Be the Bridge Podcast with Latasha Morrison for an episode all about this American political life as followers of Jesus. They discuss Kaitlyn's new book, The Ballot and the Bible: How Scripture Has Been Used and Abused in American Politics and Where We Go from Here, which gives historical context for where we are now.\n\nThey talk about how looking to see what people in history missed in their ethics and Bible reading can help us not miss the same, the Bible in the Civil War and in the Civil Rights Movement, as well as the importance of seeing how Black Americans used Scripture in our history.\n\nThey offer both practical and hopeful words to our community as we navigate this presidential election year.\n\nJoin in the conversation on our social media pages on Facebook and Instagram and LinkedIn to let us know your thoughts on this episode!\n\nHost & Executive Producer - Latasha Morrison\n\nSenior Producer - Lauren C.

Join the Be the Bridge Executive Team as they talk about the impact of a yes, what true peace looks like, and how our stories are connected.

They lean into lament and remind us that hope is not wishful thinking or optimism.

We're seeing people who are transforming into these cross racial communities that live differently and act more justly because of it. And that's something that really gives me hope out of the work of Be the Bridge.” -Micah Smith\n\n“We may not know the ways that God is working.

Dr. Lester shares about his restorative work with Love Beyond Walls, a non-profit which is bringing true social change serving people who are experiencing homelessness in Atlanta and beyond. They talk about the disconnect the church in America has with seeing people on mission trips with dignity but not people in our own communities with that same dignity. And they have a vulnerable discussion around “the talk” that Black and Brown families in America have in their homes because of having to survive in and navigate this racialized society.\n\nThis episode of the Be the Bridge Podcast will remind you of the power one person can have in someone’s life and the power there is in truly seeing people. It also brings continued conviction that covering up history and removing access to information prevents healing, reconciliation, justice, and redemption.

Because many want the imagination of their children to be a offspring of what they know and not a development of what God is shaping in them or what's developing in them naturally because of the way that they are wired.” -Jefferson Jones\n\nLinks:\n\nIf you’d like to partner with the Be the Bridge Podcast, please fill out our Advertise with Us form.\n\nAds:\n\nSpotify for Podcasters [Record, edit, distribute your podcast.

And if we don't think that our theology is shaped by our place and our space, then we're not being honest with ourselves.” -Elizabeth Behrens\n\n“We're supposed to be trying to honor and glorify God, not a nation, not a group, not a denomination. But honor and glorify God. With everything that we got we're loving him.” -Micah Smith\n\nTerms:\n\nChristian Nationalism: a cultural framework that idealizes and advocates a fusion of Christianity with American civic life. Christian nationalism contends that America has been and should always be distinctively “Christian” from top to bottom – in its self-identity, interpretations of its own history, sacred symbols, cherished values, and public policies – and it aims to keep it that way.\n\nLinks:\n\nAd:\n\nSpotify for Podcasters [Record, edit, distribute your podcast.

And so for me, as an African American, knowing the history here, it's hard for me to even say that America was a Christian nation.” -Latasha Morrison\n\n“Our nation was birthed really out of genocide and enslavement. And so even though we say that we're a Christian nation, we've been violent from day one.” -Sean Watkins\n\n“If you find yourself unwilling to genuinely and authentically challenge those systems, then you might be a white Christian nationalist. Not intentionally. I don't think a lot of us are out there just saying, ‘Oh, we want to just tear other people down.’ But that's a framework….In the long run, you're going to dehumanize and marginalize and justify hurting people in the name of religion.” -Micah Smith\n\n“The top three curriculums used for homeschoolers, the top three curriculums used in private Christian schools, promote Christian nationalism. And those textbook companies have existed since the 50s and 60s. So you now have a couple generations where kids grew up on this. They had kids, they put their kids in those same schools with the same curriculums. You now have multiple generations who have been indoctrinated in this since the time they were learning to read.” -Elizabeth Behrens\n\nAd:\n\nSpotify for Podcasters [Record, edit, distribute your podcast with the Spotify for Podcasters app or at www.spotify.com/podcasters]\n\nLinks:\n\nJude 3 Project’s documentary “Unspoken”\n\nPew Research on How Americans describe ‘Christian nationalism’\n\nEqual Justice Initiative\n\nConnect with Be the Bridge:\n\nOur Website\n\nFacebook\n\nInstagram\n\nTwitter\n\nConnect with Latasha Morrison:\n\nFacebook\n\nInstagram\n\nTwitter\n\nNot all views expressed in this interview reflect the values and beliefs of Latasha Morrison or the Be the Bridge organization.\n\nIn a gentle and heartfelt conversation, Korean American Storyteller Tasha Jun discusses her new book, Tell Me the Dream Again, with Latasha Morrison on the Be the Bridge Podcast.

Marcie Alvis Walker, the woman behind the popular Instagram account Black Coffee with White Friends, joins Be the Bridge founder and podcast host, Latasha Morrison, for a dynamic conversation. They discuss being Black in predominantly white settings, the white backlash that comes after Black gain, and the effects of generational trauma. They dive into the beauty of mercy and what true integration means. You won’t want to miss Marcie’s words about the Asbury revival and the time of Moses in the wilderness.\n\nThis conversation will be beneficial to all listeners. And Latasha brings a great reminder for white listeners: “It's an honor when we invite you into these sacred conversations. When we invite you into our pain and our stories, and a lot of times that's for you to listen, and to ask yourself - ‘What is God trying to say to me in this?’ ‘What is God speaking?’ ‘What am I missing?’”\n\nHost & Executive Producer - Latasha Morrison\n\nSenior Producer - Lauren C.

It's about what our humanity looks like in that room.” -Marcie Alvis Walker\n\n“I believe that what was happening in 2020 was part of revival.” -Latasha Morrison\n\n“It's one thing to be made equal; it's another thing to be treated equal. It's one thing to be made equal, and then treated equal; it's another thing to have equity. It's one thing to be made equal, treated equal, have equity; but it's a whole nother thing to have retribution and reparations and reconciliation - all which are biblical.” -Marcie Alvis Walker\n\n“When you're able to connect culturally it's just a beautiful thing.” -Latasha Morrison\n\nConnect with Marcie Alvis Walker:\n\nHer Website\n\nInstagram\n\nTwitter\n\nBlack Eyed Stories Substack\n\nPreorder Everybody Come Alive: A Memoir in Essays book by Marcie Alvis Walker\n\nConnect with Be the Bridge:\n\nOur Website\n\nFacebook\n\nInstagram\n\nTwitter\n\nConnect with Latasha Morrison:\n\nFacebook\n\nInstagram\n\nTwitter\n\nNot all views expressed in this interview reflect the values and beliefs of Latasha Morrison or the Be the Bridge organization\n\nAs one of the founding pastors of Cornerstone Church in Atlanta and a co-founder of Portrait Coffee, John Onwuchekwa knows how to humbly lead and how to nurture a holistic vision of community.

Why should Christians be engaged in politics? Is social justice compatible with the gospel? Pastor Eugene Cho joins Be the Bridge founder and podcast host Latasha Morrison on this episode to discuss these questions and more. He brings wise insight into faithful living in this time. You’ll be pastored and encouraged by the words and work of Pastor Cho. He and Latasha remind us that even now Jesus is moving and working.\n\nQuotes:\n\n“Here's the most simple reason why I believe politics matter: politics influences policies that ultimately impact people.” -Eugene Cho\n\n“Sociologists are telling us that political identity is growing to become the most dominant way in which we see ourselves in the world.

Dr. Anita shares about the importance of singing together, of physical touch, and of living sacrificially as a follower of Jesus.

They talk about the importance of centering adoptee voices and of learning from adoptee’s experiences and ethnicities. This needed conversation deals with the ways our society has gotten things wrong with adoption and the ways to grow and do better. Listen in and lean in so we can build bridges and create safer and healthier spaces for adoptees.\n\nQuotes:\n\n“We think it's important that we empower those where this is their lived experience to do most of the talking. And so we do not want to silence those voices, because they are not voiceless. They’re just unheard.” -Latasha Morrison\n\n“We often talk about adoption in such a simple way: black, white; it's all unicorns and rainbows. And I think that's a really dangerous and problematic way to frame it, because it really severely limits the public's perception about the complex dynamics of adoption and the trauma that's associated with it, not only for first families, but for adoptees as well.” -Gina Fimbel\n\n“When I'm with other transracial adoptees, that's where I have felt the most freedom to be me.” -Tiffany Henness\n\nLinks:\n\nResources:\n\nBe the Bridge TRA Resources\n\nBe the Bridge Blog of Resources for Transracially Adopted People of Color\n\nBe the Bridge Panel Discussions: Colin in Black and White\n\nConnect with Tiffany Henness:\n\nPatreon\n\nInstagram\n\nJourneying Home: Advent Readings for Adoptees Deconstructing their Faith\n\nTiffany’s LinksConnect with Gina Fimbel:\n\nInstagram\n\nConnect with Be the Bridge:\n\nOur Website\n\nFacebook\n\nInstagram\n\nTwitter\n\nConnect with Latasha Morrison:\n\nFacebook\n\nInstagram\n\nTwitter\n\nHost & Executive Producer - Latasha Morrison\n\nSenior Producer - Lauren C.

Gina, India, and Rena have fun with Latasha discussing Hallmark Christmas movies. Their laughter will get you into the Christmas spirit. They also take notice of the improvements that Hallmark has made with diversity and inclusion in front of the screen and behind it. Movies (even feel-good, predictable Hallmark Christmas movies) broaden our imaginations and help remind us of the power and necessity of representation.\n\nQuotes:\n\n“We were at Christmas Con to feel that Christmas spirit.” -Latasha Morrison\n\n“I'm not really a holiday person. But it's just something about those Hallmark channels. We watch them over and over and over.
