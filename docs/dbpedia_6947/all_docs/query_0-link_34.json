        "text": "Narrator 0:01\n\nYou are listening to the Be the Bridge Podcast with Latasha Morrison.\n\nLatasha Morrison 0:06\n\n[intro] How are you guys doing today? It’s exciting!\n\nNarrator 0:09\n\nEach week, Be the Bridge Podcast tackles subjects related to race and culture with the goal of bringing understanding.\n\nLatasha Morrison 0:17\n\n[intro] …but I’m gonna do it in the spirit of love.\n\nNarrator 0:19\n\nWe believe understanding can move us toward racial healing, racial equity, and racial unity. Latasha Morrison is the founder of Be the Bridge, which is an organization responding to racial brokenness and systemic injustice in our world. This podcast is an extension of our vision to make sure people are no longer conditioned by a racialized society, but grounded in truth. If you have not hit the subscribe button, please do so now. Without further ado, let’s begin today’s podcast. Oh, and stick around for some important information at the end.\n\nLatasha Morrison 0:53\n\nHello, Be the Bridge community. And, I am so excited. I’m excited because we are just a few days, maybe a little over a week as we’re recording this, from Christmas. And as you know, if you follow me, you know that I love this season. So I watch Christmas movies 365 days of the year. I listen to Christmas music whenever I want to, because I feel like as a Christian I celebrate the birth of Christ everyday. And so I feel that I can celebrate Christmas anytime that I want to. So yes, I am one of those Hallmark watching young ladies. I also have ventured into watching other channels. You know, Christmas is famous now. I think it’s 2020, when everyone was home, we were looking for some pick me up and looking for joy and all of the things. And I think a lot of people discovered what I already knew. And so I am excited because this year, we’re going to do something a little different. I wanted to do a BTB Christmas. And so I want to bring a few of our staffers on here, and I’m going to introduce them in a moment, but just to talk about all the things Christmas, the things we love. We are in advent season right now. And for those of you who don’t quite know what advent is, because I don’t want to take that for granted. Because I know in some denominations you hear about it and you do readings, and then in others you don’t. And so, I want to read something from Advent Rhythms. And so one of my traditions is I always get a, sometimes people gift them to me, an advent Bible study. And one of the ones that I love is by She Reads Truth. They’re not paying me to say this, but this is the one that I’m using this year – Advent 2022: Joy of Every Longing Heart. I actually really love their stuff. And I have another one that I did last year. So I do different ones. I’ve done, I think Truth’s Table has done one. And some different ones. But this is the one I’m using this year. And it says, “Advent is a season to intentionally slow our pace, contemplating and celebrating the first coming of Christ, while also anticipating his promised return. Take time today to pause from the busyness of the season, to catch up on your reading, make space for prayer, and rest in the presence of the Lord.” So this is a time that we remember who we serve. And so I know without Christ, I am a person of faith and so, I could not do the work that I’m doing. Like it is too much. Like even today, today was heavy. There are things in our personal lives that are happening, then there’s things in the culture and there’s things in the world. There’s a lot of heartbreak and I do want to hold space as we begin to talk about some of these things. I want to hold space for those that have a difficult time during the holidays, that these holidays do not bring joy. There are people who, you know you’re listening and you don’t have family or you don’t have connection. So those of you who are listening, I want you to think about this season maybe someone in your neighborhood, someone in your church, or someone in your life that may be holding this to themselves. Check in with people. See if people want to spend the holidays with you or have dinner with you or do some of the pre celebration things you do. Call people and just check in with them. You know, I wanted this year to make sure I got a chance. I have a great aunt that is 93 years old and I wanted to make sure that I go see her. Another thing is because of the life that I live it’s hard sometimes for me to find time to connect like I would like to. And so I try to use this time when I have time off to kind of spend some time with people that I haven’t had that opportunity to do that. And so if that’s you, do that. And then the other thing is, I find so much joy in giving and giving to others during this season. So you can connect with local organizations where you can serve and give. There’s nothing like that, that can bring joy even during this season when you’re given out of yourself and giving out of your overflow. And so, and even as a single person, I know some you are listening to this, and maybe you don’t have children, but you have extended family. So those of you who have children, you know, extend yourselves and your family to maybe friends in your community that don’t have children. And I do know that there are a lot of adoption agencies and children’s homes that are sometimes looking for people to come and visit. I know growing up we used to actually go to a rest home and sing carols and give out gifts. And I mean, do you believe that some people that are in you know, retirement centers and rest homes, do not get visits from their families. And so that’s just another way that if you’re by yourself, you can go and step out and do something like that during this season. So I wanted to say that before we got into this.\n\nI have Micah Smith here who is the Director of our Operations. Michele Evans who is our Executive Administrator. Lauren Brown who is our Podcast Manager, Merch Manager, and also my Executive Assistant. So she wears three hats. That’s what you do around here at Be the Bridge, you got to wear a lot of hats, you know. (laughter) So everybody has like three jobs. So although I said Micah Smith is over operations, he probably does human resources, finances, and all other tasks needed. (laughter) So yeah, he said, loading Uhauls, taking stuff back to storage. Yes (laughter), we do all the things. But we’re grateful to be here. And what I’d love to hear is, what are some things that you enjoy about this season? And maybe give me one word. And then what I would like to hear is maybe what is the tradition that you have in your family? Or maybe if you don’t, what tradition would you like to start? We’re going to start with Michele.\n\nMichele Evans 8:13\n\nI knew it. (laughter) Okay wait a minute. The question, what do I enjoy? One word?\n\nLatasha Morrison 8:19\n\nOne word. Yeah. One word.\n\nMichele Evans 8:20\n\nComfort.\n\nLatasha Morrison 8:20\n\nOkay. Comfort.\n\nMichele Evans 8:23\n\nThat’s what came to my mind when you said it: comfort. And that’s like, you know, my blanket. I have a basket of Christmas blankets.\n\nLatasha Morrison 8:30\n\nOhh.\n\nMichele Evans 8:31\n\nI like all the lights out except for the Christmas lights in the house.\n\nLatasha Morrison 8:34\n\nOkay!\n\nMichele Evans 8:34\n\nAnd on the couch with the blanket watching a movie, having a whatever, you know hot chocolate or beverage or whatever with the family. So I do love that, comfort. My favorite tradition would be…in my family, my immediate family, we do a Secret Santa amongst ourselves every year. We do it typically, like, right after Thanksgiving, we pull names. And it’s always fun because Miles is my youngest. And so he gets so excited and we have to convince him not to tell anyone who he has. (laughter) And he has to be able to navigate who he’s gonna go shopping with. And we all go out together on one night in one car. We go and split up, you know, in an open mall somewhere. And everyone kind of just takes off, and we do it with a little bit of money.\n\nLatasha Morrison 9:22\n\nOkay.\n\nMichele Evans 9:22\n\n$25, $30 a person. But we’re a family of five. So it adds up. And then everyone does like a little short wishlist of things that they want. And really the reason I love it so much is it’s really fun that night. And then we go to dinner afterwards and everyone’s like hiding their stuff and comes home immediately and like wraps it up and puts it under the tree. And then we open them on Christmas Eve like when we do our pajamas. And they’re the most special and like intentional gifts of the whole season. Like they’re just so special that like, “You remembered that I said I wanted this thing and you took this time to plan this special gift for me,” and we all love it. So much so that Aria said she got an extra credit assignment in school this week of one of your favorite Christmas memories and she had to draw it. And that’s what she sketched, was our secret santa evening. So it’s fun.\n\nLatasha Morrison 10:11\n\nOh, that’s so good. And you do the PJs. I love that.\n\nMichele Evans 10:13\n\nWe do. Every year.\n\nLatasha Morrison 10:14\n\nLet me tell you. That’s one thing as a single person, that’s one thing that I miss. Because I try to get my family. I go home to North Carolina for Christmas. And so it’s my aunt, my mom, my brother. They are like bah humbug when it comes to PJs. My mom will participate with me, but no one else. So I’m going to make T’Challa participate with me this year.\n\nMichele Evans 10:37\n\nYes. Even if you buy them all the pajamas, like make everyone?\n\nLatasha Morrison 10:40\n\nNo. I bought my mom a pair, and she’s the only one. My aunt said pajamas are hot, she don’t wear them. (laughter) So y’all pray for me. Pray for me. (laughter) Okay. So Let’s go to Micah.\n\nMicah Smith 10:58\n\nOkay, first of all, I’m excited to be on here with you. It’s interesting to be here with the four of you on the podcast, because I know we meet a lot behind the scenes. And it gets crazy sometimes, maybe we’ll not get too far into it this time. (laughter) Yeah, I enjoy being with you all. I think the word that comes to mind for me is peace. There’s just something about Christmas when everything just kind of slows down a little bit. And there’s all this craziness, we’re in the middle of craziness all the time in Be the Bridge, with family stuff, with all the things going. And there’s just a moment where all of a sudden, it starts to kind of just like slow for a moment.\n\nLatasha Morrison 11:38\n\nYeah.\n\nMicah Smith 11:38\n\nAnd I love it. I was talking to Michele the other day, it’s like just having all your baby birds in the nest. You know? It’s like when they all get to come back.\n\nMichele Evans 11:45\n\nYes, absolutely.\n\nMicah Smith 11:45\n\nAnd everyone’s in the house. And so you’re all together. You know? I have four kids 18 to eight. And so just having us all just kind of slow down and be together more through the season. I love that. I just have a lot of traditions that I feel strongly about that I grew up with. And I actually had to convert my wife to these. She’s a little bit of a grinch. She’s self proclaimed grinch. She’s got a stocking, we have stockings. And she bought one for herself that has the Grinch on it. That’s what I’m working with. But she loves Christmas, too, now. I think she always has. But in terms of the traditions aspect. And one of the ones I’ve always lived with is a live tree. So we go out to the Christmas tree farm, we get a live tree. And there was two years in there I had hurt my knee. And she was like, “Oh, let’s just get an artificial tree.” Because that’s always what she wants to do, get an artificial tree, it’s easier. And I tell you what, the next year after that she was like, “You know what, I miss the live tree.”\n\nLatasha Morrison 12:43\n\nAww.\n\nMicah Smith 12:43\n\nBut I think the tradition that I would point out most is we get an ornament, each of our kids gets an ornament every year that somehow reflects their year. And so, every year, we add a new batch of ornaments to the tree. And I love it because that was something I did as a kid. My family was a bit messy growing up. And we always had those little Christmas things. And that’s why I think I hold on to them so strong.\n\nLatasha Morrison 13:10\n\nWow.\n\nMicah Smith 13:11\n\nSo, I would get ornaments every year. And my mom passed away five years ago in January. And I went and found…that was the one thing I went and found was all my ornaments. So now I got ornaments on the tree. I have like a little train that looks like a stained glass window from 1978 up there.\n\nMichele Evans 13:27\n\nI love that.\n\nMicah Smith 13:28\n\nAnd my son has one up there from 2010. You know, and then they have all their little ornaments stuck up on the tree. So now it’s gone from just our first year were it’s just like a couple ornaments that someone gave us as wedding gifts. Right? And now our tree is full. We can hardly even find place for all the ornaments on them and just keep adding to them every year. And I love it. And I love thinking about each one and why it’s hanging up there. Even ones like these random ones. Like when my son was two, he’s 15 now. He got the top of an m&m container that was a holiday container, it had a little loop on it and stuck it on the tree. That thing’s been hanging up there for 13 years because I thought it was funny. And so it just became one of our ornaments, too. (laughter)\n\nMichele Evans 14:08\n\nOh that’s so cool.\n\nLauren Brown 14:08\n\nI love that.\n\nLatasha Morrison 14:12\n\nOh, that’s so great. I think you should take some pictures. And we can post them on our Instagram when we actually aire this podcast. But I love that tradition. I love what you said like that, you know, there was some messiness growing up but this is one tradition that you had when you were little that you hold on to. And I think that’s what makes it special. So we can find like just, you know, in the midst of that there’s like little things that we can hold on to and kind of celebrate those things with your family. Lauren, you’re next.\n\nLauren Brown 14:53\n\nYes, my word is joy. It makes me happy. So I’ll make a confession. Last year, I thought I canceled Christmas for the Browns. And so, I’m the one that really does all the Christmas things. And coming out of COVID I was like, “I’m not doing it. I’m not putting up anything.” And I devastated everybody, all my kids, especially my son. But this year, I was encouraged to do all the things. And I’m not really a decorator so…Latasha has like, this energy about Christmas that makes you think you can decorate when you look at her stuff. And now I came home and was like, “I can do this!” And I looked at my tree I was like, “Oh this don’t look right. She a little bare. There’s something wrong.” (laughter) But I did buy like a wreath that is like animated. So when you walk by the house it sings songs. And it brings me the most joy. Like, now when I go downstairs, I see all the things that I have out and the ornaments and the lights. I like sparkly things. So I’m not like a Santa snow person, it’s definitely the glitter and the lights. The more glitter, it’s all over the house. I love it. So it’s joy. And it makes me remember when I grew up, how much fun we used to have. It was joy coming down to the tree. We didn’t really have traditions. I was an only child. So it was just lots of overkill of toys, which I guess is a tradition because that’s what I do with my kids – overkill. And the tradition that I started with my family is the pajamas, the PJs. So I buy them. They never know what it is. They know in the morning it’s going to be at the foot of their bed and they have to wear it. So we’ve done A Christmas Story. My son wore the pink pajama outfit. He loved it. Took pictures. Went somewhere with his friends. I have photos, that he would probably die if I shared on Instagram with Be the Bridge. (laughter) We had these little pimp sweat suits with a Santa Claus tiger on the back. And he had on a little glittery hat so it’s the pajamas. And I’m looking forward to that this year. I won’t buy them for everybody, which is sad because now I’m an empty nester. But they have to come to my house and have their pajamas on, so.\n\nLatasha Morrison 17:14\n\nOkay. Those are all great things. And so, you’re listening to this maybe these are really affordable things that you can do with your family. I love the ornament. You see I had a tree growing up. My family has always been into decor. You know if anybody knows me, if you’ve been to my house I love home decor.\n\nAD\n\nLatasha Morrison 0:00\n\nWe always had themes. And so I could never put random ornaments on the tree. So I remember one year we had a bear, a teddy bear tree. So all the ornaments were teddy bear and then we had that for several years. And then we had a fake tree that was like a flocked, like had snow on it, flocked tree. And, it was apples. So she had, it was all red, red and white. It was like apples on the tree. My grandmother always had a white tree, it’s a green tree with white lights, and all white ornaments and doves on it. And my aunt has kept up that tradition. So we’ve had to replace the ornaments with new ornaments. And we’ve added a little silver in there, also. So we’ve kept up that particular tradition. And then when my brother, I was probably about 17 and a half when my brother was born, and we had a clown tree. So all the ornaments that my mom had on the tree were little clowns. I don’t know where she found this stuff. Y’all like, “Nah uh.” (laughter) It was a clown tree. Yes, we had a clown tree.\n\nMichele Evans 1:37\n\nWe can do away with that particular tree.\n\nLatasha Morrison 1:41\n\nHis nursery was also clowns. And he is, my brother is traumatized. He doesn’t want anything to do the circus.\n\nMichele Evans 1:48\n\nI’m sure! Poor buddy.\n\nLatasha Morrison 1:52\n\n(laughter) He doesn’t want to do anything with it. But yeah, I think that is like really exciting just to hear some of the things that we celebrate. What is something that’s memorable to you? And sometimes like there’s some memories of Christmas that maybe it’s a good memory or maybe it’s just something that you think about at this season all the time that’s not, you know, as good. I can remember when my when my parents divorced, that was like definitely a change, a shift in how Christmas was celebrated. But one of the things my grandparents did was they would always come to our house that morning to see us open our gifts, but they would not bring their gifts. And so this is my mom’s, my maternal grandparents, so they will come to our house. And they would not bring their gifts for us. We had to come to their house when it was time for dinner to open up any gifts there. And so, my aunt in some way has kind of continued on that. My grandmother loved the season. She would play “This Christmas” on this record player that we had up until just a few years ago in her dining room. And my aunt has made like a playlist of all of these like favorite songs that my grandmother used to listen to. And they play them at Christmas time. And so, I one year said, “I want to make the playlist.” So I made a playlist and of course, you know, here I am. I’m all about diversity, inclusion, belonging, equity, all of these things. So I want to give every Christmas song a chance. So I had a Christmas playlist that was very diverse. I had some Kelly Clarkson in there, some Elvis, some different people in there. My family said, “You are fired.” (laughter) I’m sorry, they only want the Brown people. And it has to be R&B and it has to be around the 70s, 80s. She does have a more updated playlist. You know she has updated one with you know, Boyz II Men and different things like that. But they liked the old like The Supremes, and you know, all the old, old Christmas. The Temptations, Michael Jackson, you know, the Jackson Five, all of that stuff. That’s what they like. And that’s what we listen to. So I think, if I think of the most memorable Christmas…I will say something I think about all the time, this is probably not, my grandmother passed around a few days before Christmas. And it was her favorite season. And our family still decided to celebrate like in her honor. And we buried her the day after Christmas. And so, that was just, and we had like poinsettias and different things like that at her funeral. So that was just, so we always at Christmas time, we always think of my grandmother. But it’s not in a sad way. It’s always in a joyful way. And the way we celebrate Christmas as a family is to really honor her and to remember her and to celebrate her life. How about you? Let’s let’s start off with Micah.\n\nMicah Smith 5:21\n\nOkay. I guess two things popped into my mind. Like, specific Christmases I’m having a hard time thinking of. But I can think of like one is further back, where I just remember, like, my mom was over the top about Christmas. She had some traditions, but like, I’ve cut most of them, because it was just…she traumatized me on Christmas morning. I’m telling you. Because we had to do so many things before we could open the presents, it was like after lunch.\n\nMichele Evans 5:48\n\nLike what? That’s so interesting.\n\nMicah Smith 5:50\n\nSo we’d wake up and we’d have to make a breakfast thing like in the kitchen. It was some sort of like, it wasn’t an easy thing, either. It was like a from scratch, we had to roll up this nuts and wheat pastry sort of thing with some sort of orange topping that took forever. And then we had to do some sort of nativity reading. And there was a coloring book we pulled out, this giant Jesus coloring book. Right? And colored a picture every year when we did the nativity reading. And then we would tell our favorite things about Christmas. It was wild. (laughter) So that sticks out to me. But a more recent one, I think, and this is more, my wife, Amy was reflecting the other day, just remembering, and this ties into the ornament, as well. Just remembering how we were sitting around on my daughter’s first Christmas, and putting her first ornament on the tree, and how she was thinking about, you know, “Oh, what will it look like when this tree is full? And when our kids are growing?” And all that sort of stuff, just dreaming about that? And she said said something that stuck with me the other day that was, “Don’t forget about the dreams you dream that you’re living in now.” Because she was looking at our tree now and thinking about, “Oh, I used to dream about this tree and all the things it represents of our kids growing up.” And seeing them now, like our oldest turned 18. Like all the sudden we have this alleged adult in the house. You know? And she was, we were just reflecting on that Christmas when we had our first child and the tree and what it was like to have that new family environment. And now thinking about how we’re living that out with four kids and this tree full of memories that represents all of the things that have happened since then.\n\nLatasha Morrison 7:41\n\nSo you have really won Amy over with all the Christmas. Yes, yes. (laughter)\n\nMicah Smith 7:47\n\nYes, I’ve won her over! (laughter)\n\nLatasha Morrison 7:49\n\nOh, good. What about you, Lauren?\n\nLauren Brown 7:54\n\nLet’s see. I was thinking about that. I remember, because there was an abundance of toys, I remember…all right, I’m gonna date myself a little bit. But I remember this because I wanted it so bad. So my grandmother and my mom were pranksters and that did carry over to me. So I wanted one thing and I wanted that dog on Barbie doll head. (laughter)\n\nMichele Evans 8:20\n\nYes! I know exactly what you’re talking about.\n\nLauren Brown 8:23\n\nThat Barbie doll head. She came with that comb, that brush.\n\nMichele Evans 8:26\n\nThat blue makeup.\n\nLauren Brown 8:27\n\nYes, the blue eyeshadow.\n\nMichele Evans 8:29\n\nYes.\n\nLauren Brown 8:30\n\nSo I opened up all my gifts and she wasn’t under there. And I was devastated. I did get the Diana Ross. She had fingernails, long fingernails and long silky hair. (laughter) Listen. She had on these high heels. It was fabulous. But I did get her. So they waited. Like, we ate dinner and everything. And then all of a sudden, my grandmother put it in the bathroom. And I went in the bathroom and it was sitting on top of the toilet seat. I remember screaming and hollering through the house. And so now I do that to my kids. And I still do it now and they’re 25 and 28. Because I ask them for five things. Tell me five things. They know they’re pretty much gonna get it. But I try to like, Daniel asked for a Chad Ochocinco jersey a long time ago. I took a paper towel roller, I rolled that thing and put it inside the paper towel tube. And he had to pull it. (laughter) He was trying to figure out. He was like, “Why did I get this?!” But I was like, “Well look at it.” And so he had to pull it out. Sapphire we would take the sneakers and put them in something else. It’s just fun. So I remember just playing tricks with the gifts.\n\nMichele Evans 8:35\n\nThat is fun.\n\nLauren Brown 9:15\n\nBut that Barbie doll head. But once you cut that hair, it’s a wrap.\n\nMichele Evans 9:51\n\nYeah, it doesn’t grow back.\n\nMicah Smith 9:52\n\nWere those those huge heads?\n\nLauren Brown 9:54\n\nYes.\n\nMichele Evans 9:54\n\nIt was only like from half of the way of the chest and like up. I mean the blue eye eyeshadow. It’s the blue eyeshadow for me.\n\nLauren Brown 10:01\n\nIt was! (laughter)\n\nMichele Evans 10:02\n\nIt was that part. And we loved it.\n\nLauren Brown 10:04\n\nBut do you remember when they made a Brown Barbie doll head?\n\nMichele Evans 10:07\n\nYup, absolutely.\n\nLauren Brown 10:08\n\nIt was like, she was out of here. I had to get me the girls with braids. (laughter)\n\nMichele Evans 10:13\n\nSo funny.\n\nLauren Brown 10:14\n\nShe had barrettes, rollers, sponge rollers on there.\n\nMichele Evans 10:19\n\nOh my gosh. Wow.\n\nLauren Brown 10:21\n\nYeah, someone put a hot curler on there and destroyed it. (laughter)\n\nLatasha Morrison 10:26\n\nHow many kids did that? I mean we just destroyed hair, cutting hair thinking it was gonna grow back.\n\nMichele Evans 10:37\n\nColoring it with markers. All kinds of crazy stuff. Sorry Micah.\n\nLatasha Morrison 10:40\n\nWhat about you, Michele?\n\nMichele Evans 10:40\n\nMy favorite childhood memory would probably be like having so much pride in decorating. It just felt something like putting everything out, it was so special, all the things. It looks the exact same every year. Which I don’t know why it had to be that way, like, “This one here.” We have that…I’m gonna date myself, too…like a Santa that was like hard and big and like, it was like before blow up things happened. (laughter) Do you guys know what I’m talking about? I don’t even, it’s ridiculous. And he was inside like looking out the window.\n\nLauren Brown 10:40\n\nYes. (laughter)\n\nMichele Evans 10:48\n\nBecause then Christmas trees went in the window, too. So that you can see them from the street. Like houses aren’t really designed like that anymore. But I remember once when my mother, it was during the time that she was sick and stuff around Christmas. And we always had an artificial white tree, red light bulbs and white light, the same plastic white, it wasn’t even flocked. It was like a plastic white tree. And I decided I’m buying a Christmas tree, a live Christmas tree. And I went and did it myself and brought it home and like decorated it. And they brought her in there because she was like, you know, she was ill at that time. I was so proud of that tree and like doing that was like the adult thing that I did. “I can contribute to Christmas now.” So that’s honestly, a lot of the childhood years, while I know they were happy and full of good things, I don’t remember like the details from them. I think I’ve just kind of like, it’s not in my mind. I’m sitting here trying to remember like what was really special about it. There’s nothing particular specific that I remember, but I know that it was good. And that it was full. You know, if that makes sense?\n\nLatasha Morrison 12:18\n\nYeah.\n\nMicah Smith 12:19\n\nThere’s a feeling that you have…\n\nMichele Evans 12:19\n\nYeah, there’s a feeling. Yeah.\n\nMicah Smith 12:22\n\n…from that moment.\n\nMichele Evans 12:24\n\nYeah. That it was good.\n\nLatasha Morrison 12:25\n\nAnd the last question – what are some traditional meals that you cook? What are some traditional meals that you cook? I mean, I think, sadly, Thanksgiving and Christmas are probably just the only holidays that I probably do heavy cooking a little bit. But sadly, yeah. So what are some things that you cook or either that you would like to cook. Like you’ve had this aspiration of doing it, like you envision it, but it just never happened?\n\nMichele Evans 13:03\n\nWe think Lauren should go first. (laughter)\n\nLatasha Morrison 13:06\n\nLauren, Lauren.\n\nMicah Smith 13:07\n\nYes.\n\nLauren Brown 13:08\n\nYou are cheating! The only reason you’re doing that because you know. All right, Lauren is not… alright, so I don’t do Thanksgiving cooking. I did sides. I will go get my Honey Baked Ham. I’m gonna get a Honey Baked Ham for Christmas.\n\nMicah Smith 13:20\n\nYes!\n\nLauren Brown 13:21\n\nBut what I do for my family is I will do brunch. Because I’ll do like the small things. We’ll have like a taco bar. We’ll have like chicken and waffles, fried fish, or stuff like that. Something small. Deviled eggs. It’s just a bunch of finger foods. My mom likes appetizers, so that that’s her jam. So she loves that. I’m not the cook, but I will bake. So I will bake cookies for everybody. I make like four types of cookies. And I’ll go get my little dollar store tins to put them in and everybody goes home with their cookies. But I’m definitely not the cook.\n\nLatasha Morrison 13:55\n\nSo you actually bake the cookies from scratch? You’re not buying the dough that’s premade?\n\nLauren Brown 14:00\n\nI do. No, no, absolutely not. I have a mixer downstairs. I only use it for Christmas cookies. (laughter) And my sweet potato pie, because I make potato pie, too. But yeah, baking. Listen, that cooking is not for the faint of heart.\n\nLatasha Morrison 14:14\n\nI know. I know.\n\nMichele Evans 14:15\n\nBut if you love to bake that’s amazing. And Lauren, an idea for you. A cookie party where you can have people, everyone brings a dozen or two of cookies that they make, Christmas cookies. And you buy the little boxes and everyone goes home with like an assortment. I don’t like to bake, assortment of cookies.\n\nLauren Brown 14:31\n\nI’m picky with my cookies though. They have to be chewy, but crispy on the outside.\n\nLatasha Morrison 14:36\n\nMy friends did that. My friend did that at her Christmas party where everybody was supposed to bring cookies. I think everybody did it. I didn’t do it. (laughter) I have a confession. I have a confession. I love the idea of people like decorating cookies. And you know I’ve done that with my little cousins where you buy the cookies and you decorate them, or either bake the Pillsbury ones or whatever. But I have a confession. I have never made a cookie from scratch, ever.\n\nLauren Brown 15:05\n\nTest it before you give it out. Test it before you give it out. That’s all I’m saying. (laughter)\n\nLatasha Morrison 15:12\n\nYeah, cause a friend of mine, she made some from scratch. And they were beautiful. I mean she colored, the decorating was so pretty. I mean, put them in the wrappers. Oh, it’s so good. But they tasted like trash. (laughter)\n\nMichele Evans 15:27\n\nOh!\n\nLauren Brown 15:28\n\nNo! See.\n\nLatasha Morrison 15:29\n\nI hope they’re not listening to this podcast.\n\nLauren Brown 15:32\n\nI don’t, I don’t do those type of cookies. I do like a brownie fudge cookie. I do a toffee cookie. And I do a red velvet cooke. That’s new. We tried that. That’s a new one.\n\nLatasha Morrison 15:43\n\nOkay.\n\nLauren Brown 15:43\n\nAnd then I have an oatmeal one. We don’t like the raisins in it. So it’s oatmeal. And then I have to do a walnut cookie for my mom. Her and those walnuts. I have to.\n\nLatasha Morrison 15:53\n\nOkay. What about you, Michelle?\n\nMichele Evans 15:59\n\nWe do breakfast tacos. We love that. I have to have it every year.\n\nLatasha Morrison 16:03\n\nOkay.\n\nMichele Evans 16:03\n\nSo we just make all the, everything, from hashbrowns, bacon, sausage, all the toppings. Breakfast burritos, that’s what we do. And everyone just puts all the stuff in. And I make monkey bread, too, every Christmas. So we have to have those two things.\n\nLatasha Morrison 16:19\n\nOkay.\n\nMichele Evans 16:20\n\nI don’t have a dinner tradition. We tend to like go away from the traditional Christmas. We’ll want like Mexican food. You know, we’re from California, so we always want Mexican. (laughter) The breakfast burritos and the monkey bread are a must. And they have to wait. Because I don’t like being in the kitchen cooking while everyone’s having fun and doing their whole thing. So y’all gotta wait until I do that. And then we can.\n\nLauren Brown 16:42\n\nThat’s right.\n\nLatasha Morrison 16:44\n\nOkay. What about you, Micah?\n\nMicah Smith 16:48\n\nIt’s funny because some things I think cross racial culture and some things are very different. Because, I’m all about Honey Baked Ham. And that’s what I’m about. And you know, I think we do a breakfast casserole on Christmas. But we’re not big Christmas food people. We’re Thanksgiving, like Thanksgiving’s are big cooking holiday and New Year’s. Right? New Year’s we have certain things you have to eat: hog’s jowl, greens, and black eyed peas. Right?\n\nMichele Evans 17:17\n\nPause.\n\nLauren Brown 17:17\n\nRun that back.\n\nMichele Evans 17:19\n\nPause. What is hog chow?\n\nMicah Smith 17:24\n\nJowl.\n\nMichele Evans 17:25\n\nJowl.\n\nMicah Smith 17:25\n\nI don’t know it was introduced to me.\n\nLatasha Morrison 17:31\n\n(laughter) Chitlins. It’s chitlines.\n\nMicah Smith 17:31\n\nI’m in West Tennessee. And we’re in a rural part of Tennessee and that’s where my wife’s family grew up. And it is all, it’s like good luck and good fortune and all that stuff.\n\nLauren Brown 17:39\n\nChitlins!\n\nMicah Smith 17:39\n\nAnd so they have to, is it like the…I don’t know what part?\n\nMichele Evans 17:42\n\nThe jowl is like this part, like the cheek or something. Right?\n\nMicah Smith 17:46\n\nYeah, you cook it up, it’s kind of like bacon, a little bit tougher maybe, thicker.\n\nLatasha Morrison 17:50\n\nOh.\n\nMicah Smith 17:51\n\nYeah.\n\nI need a picture of that on Christmas.\n\nLatasha Morrison 17:53\n\nSo it’s white people chitlin? (laughter)\n\nMichele Evans 18:08\n\nOh my goodness.\n\nLatasha Morrison 18:08\n\nOr how we say pork belly? Pork belly. They try to sophisticate it, bougie fi it. Pork belly. (laughter)\n\nMichele Evans 18:14\n\nPork jowls. Okay, I need a picture of that on Christmas Day, please.\n\nMicah Smith 18:19\n\nI’m gonna say this, growing up, my mom she cannot cook. She couldn’t cook at all. She insisted on trying to cook a big Christmas meal. It was wild. I mean, I always say our home kitchen was Applebee’s. Because there’s an Applebee’s in town. That’s where we always went. But she tried to cook. And one of the things she always made and pulled off was a Coca Cola salad, which is a jello salad. So we got our gelatin white person like…\n\nLatasha Morrison 18:50\n\nOh my God. (laughter)\n\nMicah Smith 18:51\n\n…piece that people make fun of us for, so.\n\nLatasha Morrison 18:53\n\nOkay.\n\nMicah Smith 18:56\n\nI know in the Be the Bridge chat, there’s whole threads on the jello.\n\nLatasha Morrison 18:59\n\nOkay.\n\nMicah Smith 19:00\n\nWe had one that was legitimate. And I thought it was good for Christmas.\n\nMichele Evans 19:04\n\nHe did like this, hmmm. I thought it was good. (laughter)\n\nMicah Smith 19:07\n\nWe called it Coca Cola salad. It had no lettuce in it whatsoever.\n\nLatasha Morrison 19:11\n\nIf you are listening to this, if you did, if your family had a Coca Cola salad, please tag us. I want to see pictures of this Coca Cola salad.\n\nLauren Brown 19:22\n\nYes.\n\nLatasha Morrison 19:22\n\nAnd all the things. But the thing is, it’s so beautiful. Like I think Christmas is that season that really brings people together. You see a lot of kindness, generosity, love. You know, there’s some beauty in this season in the midst of a lot of brokenness. And I like to time to just take the time to pause. And so that’s one of the reasons why even in Be the Bridge we give, you know, time between time off for Christmas through New Year’s, so that people can kind of take some time to reflect and to pause and just to prepare yourself for the new year. And that’s just like a form of self care. And just so you can have time with your family. We do, we run hard, like we do a lot of stuff. And so it’s good for us to do that. And so as you know, one of the things that I do each year, one of the things that I do is I talk about some of the movies that I have watched. And there are a lot of Christmas movies. Let me tell you guys, Hallmark has stepped it up. Like I mean, I’m talking about plot and script writing. I’m like, “This has got layers in it, like this is a couple of things going on at once.” (laughter) You know, it’s like, “Oh, I didn’t know that was gonna happen.” And just every, if you noticed, like every streaming service, they have a couple holiday movies that you can choose from. Disney, all the different ones. I just watched one on BET+. First of all, we need to talk about all these streaming services, they need to start combining or partnering up.\n\nMichele Evans 21:12\n\nYes, it’s ridiculous.\n\nLatasha Morrison 21:14\n\nBecause it’s just ridiculous. I can’t even keep up. But most of them have like some type of Christmas movies. And so I had an opportunity to talk with three young women that I’ve met at Christmas Con. Yes, I went to Christmas Con. And I will explain all of that to you in just a moment. So I want you to just lean into this conversation with some ladies I’ve met, you’re going to hear their accent. They are from New Orleans. And one of them lives in Texas now, but still has the accent. And we’re just going to share our experiences at Christmas Con – good and bad. And just some of the movies that we thought stood out. And so we’re still in the middle of the holiday movie season. You know, Hallmark and Lifetime, they start theirs back in October and they run them like up until the first week of, the first couple of days of January. And so there’s a lot. So as we’re recording this, there’s some that we’re not gonna get a chance to talk about because they haven’t aired yet. But we’re gonna, I may bring some of those conversations over on Instagram Live throughout the season. I think I’m going to have a conversation this week on Instagram Live. So thank you so much for listening to us and the BTB Christmas. Thank you, Lauren and Micah and Michele for jumping on here and sharing your traditions.\n\nLauren Brown 22:52\n\nThis was fun.\n\nMicah Smith 22:52\n\nYeah, it was fun.\n\nMichele Evans 22:52\n\nIt was awesome.\n\nLatasha Morrison 22:52\n\nYeah! We hope that each of you have a blessed holiday season, that you take time to pause and to contemplate and to remember what this season is truly about and that you make sure that you extend yourself to others during this season. Thank you so much.\n\nNarrator 23:19"
