Without further ado, let’s begin today’s podcast. Oh, and stick around for some important information at the end.\n\nLatasha Morrison 2:02\n\nAnd we’re back!\n\nPatricia Taylor 2:04\n\nHello, hello!\n\nLatasha Morrison 2:05\n\n2021!\n\nPatricia Taylor 2:07\n\nYes, it’s a new season.\n\nLatasha Morrison 2:09\n\nLast year we had our All Things Christmas on Instagram.\n\nPatricia Taylor 2:14\n\nYes. And that was so much fun.\n\nLatasha Morrison 2:16\n\nSo good. But this year we done moved up. Patty, look.\n\nPatricia Taylor 2:20\n\nYes! I know, look at us.\n\nLatasha Morrison 2:21\n\nIt’s all looking like Christmas in here.\n\nPatricia Taylor 2:24\n\nWe’re in Christmas land. We’re in a Hallmark movie right now.\n\nLatasha Morrison 2:27\n\nThis is a hallmark movie!\n\nPatricia Taylor 2:28\n\nIt is. (laughter)\n\nLatasha Morrison 2:29\n\nThis is like one of the shows. We could actually write a movie about this.\n\nPatricia Taylor 2:32\n\nWe should.\n\nLatasha Morrison 2:33\n\nWe should.\n\nPatricia Taylor 2:33\n\nWe should.\n\nLatasha Morrison 2:33\n\nOkay, we should. Well, I am so excited because all my friends know that I am all about Christmas. You know, all about Black Santas. All about all the things of the holidays. This season, I love everything about it. Family, food, Jesus. All of it. Just in case someone wondered. I thought I’m a unicorn amongst my friends.\n\nPatricia Taylor 2:54\n\nRight, right.\n\nLatasha Morrison 3:00\n\nSo I’m thinking, are your friends into Christmas?\n\nPatricia Taylor 3:05\n\nThey are, but not to the extent when it’s like, “Oh, October 22nd we get to start watching Hallmark movies!” and they all tune me out. And they’re like, “Yeah, we’ll see you in January.” (laughter)\n\nLatasha Morrison 3:16\n\nSo you said October. You see and that’s the other thing. I start watching in October. Some people are saying we’re rushing Halloween, Thanksgiving, all of that. Like I start prepping in September.\n\nPatricia Taylor 3:30\n\nOh, I start prepping for sure.\n\nLatasha Morrison 3:32\n\nWell, really July. Because they have the Christmas in July.\n\nPatricia Taylor 3:35\n\nChristmas in July movies. And then when you have them DVR’d, then you can have some like throughout the year because you just need like a Christmas pick me up anytime.\n\nLatasha Morrison 3:43\n\nAnd if anyone should understand that, we should understand that.\n\nPatricia Taylor 3:46\n\nRight.\n\nLatasha Morrison 3:46\n\nBecause we can celebrate Christmas anytime.\n\nPatricia Taylor 3:50\n\nExactly.\n\nLatasha Morrison 3:50\n\nI say it’s Christmas 365.\n\nPatricia Taylor 3:52\n\nYeah, I’m with it. Which is why we bonded, because we found out that we’re unicorns when it comes to that. We don’t have to disregard or diminish any holiday.\n\nLatasha Morrison 4:01\n\nExactly.\n\nPatricia Taylor 4:01\n\nBut we can stand Christmas. And be like, “Thank you Hallmark for having like 40 movies always.” (laughter)\n\nLatasha Morrison 4:09\n\nI mean, like, okay, let’s let’s talk about the progression because okay, now the movies are starting in October.\n\nPatricia Taylor 4:15\n\nYes. Really. That was the real date. October 22nd this year.\n\nLatasha Morrison 4:19\n\nBut before they would have like one premiere when it first started out. Because I’ve been watching since ’09. So when I think two years ago, they had their 10 year anniversary. And I started in 2009. And I was thinking like, okay, it would be like one over the weekend. But now this year, did you notice? They’re like Friday,\n\nPatricia Taylor 4:42\n\nYes. Friday night, Saturday night.\n\nLatasha Morrison 4:44\n\nSaturday, and Sunday, brand new ones. So I could hardly keep up this year.\n\nPatricia Taylor 4:49\n\nRight, same. And on the other channel, because you have a main Hallmark Channel where they do Friday, Saturday, Sunday. But then you have Hallmark Movies and Mysteries where they always do like one new weekend premiere as well. Or maybe even two. So it’s a lot. We haven’t watched them all.\n\nLatasha Morrison 5:04\n\nWe’re bonding on Hallmark. Yeah.\n\nPatricia Taylor 5:03\n\nWe’re behind. We’ve been busy. We just had training for for work this week.\n\nLatasha Morrison 5:09\n\nEverything!\n\nPatricia Taylor 5:10\n\nYeah, life has been a lot.\n\nLatasha Morrison 5:12\n\nAnd not to mention, although we’re talking about Hallmark here, there are a lot of other stations: Lifetime, VH1, OWN, BET, TV One, Up, and many, many more…\n\nPatricia Taylor 5:27\n\nMany more! (laughter)\n\nLatasha Morrison 5:28\n\n…that are showing Christmas movies, like what is it? What do you think? Why do you think like Christmas is a big thing as it relates to movies now?\n\nPatricia Taylor 5:36\n\nOh, well, I mean, I honestly feel like Hallmark set the bar.\n\nLatasha Morrison 5:40\n\nYeah, I think so.\n\nPatricia Taylor 5:41\n\nAnd as much as there are people who, you know, will roll their eyes. And, you know, the thing is, we’re watching Hallmark fully aware of the cheese factor and just embracing it.\n\nLatasha Morrison 5:50\n\nAnd we’ll talk about it. We understand.\n\nPatricia Taylor 5:53\n\nWe understand. We get it. But I do think all these other networks are realizing this is what people want.\n\nLatasha Morrison 5:58\n\nYeah, I want a bow on it. I want a bow.\n\nPatricia Taylor 6:00\n\nBecause, you know, life is challenging. And life is hard. And the last two years, let’s not even go down that road, but the last two years. And we just want to be able to say, “This was nice. I can watch some it’s not going to trigger me, it’s not going to be traumatic.”\n\nLatasha Morrison 6:13\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nPatricia Taylor 6:14\n\nYou know, it’s going to actually like have that spirit that we say we want all year round where people are kind to each other and love each other.\n\nLatasha Morrison 6:21\n\nYou know how it ends.\n\nPatricia Taylor 6:22\n\nAnd you know it’s gonna be a nice ending. Like there’s nothing wrong with having that comfort, you know? (laughter)\n\nLatasha Morrison 6:28\n\nSome of you’re listening like, I know some people they’re like listening, and they’re gritting their teeth, because they’re like, “I cannot stand them. They’re so predictable.” That’s what I love. I love that it’s predictable. (laughter)\n\nPatricia Taylor 6:40\n\nI like good surprises, but I don’t need any bad surprises. (laughter)\n\nLatasha Morrison 6:44\n\nWhen I watch TV I want to escape. So I don’t want the same trauma that’s happening in the world on my TV, especially Christmas movies. And so this year there were a lot. So we are behind on some of them. And we’re gonna give some shout outs to some of the ones on some of the other stations that we also wantched to share them. But we are ready. I’m telling you, I think, I was trying to think about the progression because I remember in ’09 it started. And I could look at some of the Hallmark movies and then realize that they’re using the same like costumes and some of the other props. (laughter) Like that reindeer and that sleigh. I’ve seen that in about 50 movies.\n\nPatricia Taylor 7:34\n\nRight. Or that pea coat. It’s that same shade of baby blue. (laughter)\n\nLatasha Morrison 7:38\n\nYou know, and the same commercials and all of that. But now, like Hallmark’s on the come up. Like I mean, the commercials, they have Etsy commercials, Target, they are really doing it. And I’ve seen the progression. Because back in 2013, I know I wrote a blog post that really talked about the lack of diversity. Because when you think about Christmas, I think Christmas is very inclusive. You know, a lot of people unless you’re of a different religion, celebrate Christmas. It’s a staple American holiday in that sense. And all the Christmas movies I would watch, you know, you think back to Elf, or the Santa Claus, It’s a Wonderful World, White Christmas, like all of those there was really no representation. And I’m like, “Don’t they know we like Christmas, too?” I love Christmas!\n\nPatricia Taylor 8:33\n\nYeah, and even regardless of the faith tradition, for some people this is when you slow down and you spend time with family. And you know, I think that’s one thing that I appreciate that I understand, especially in the work we do, we are always looking for progress. And it’s difficult, though, because there is a big part of me that’s like, this is not happening fast enough. Like we see a problem. We want the solution, like we need to move fast enough. We’re not moving fast enough. But then when it comes to Hallmark, like they were a little late on this. Like this is not something new. It’s 2021.\n\nLatasha Morrison 9:09\n\nYup.\n\nPatricia Taylor 9:09\n\nYeah. And to be able to still be like, “Oh, wow, they’re getting there.” So can you just briefly speak to like this idea of progress and change? And like the timetable? Because that can really be frustrating. Like, “Well, that’s great they’re doing it now. But you know, why did it take this long for them to get here?”\n\nLatasha Morrison 9:26\n\nRight, right. I think that’s really good. Because I think, you know, a lot of times we lack the patience. We want things to change, but we have to realize that ships don’t, if you just turn around sometimes they sink.\n\nPatricia Taylor 9:28\n\nThat’s good.\n\nLatasha Morrison 9:28\n\nAnd so I think you know, it’s just like I think a lot of them have to have strategy.\n\nPatricia Taylor 9:44\n\nRight.\n\nLatasha Morrison 9:44\n\nAnd then it depends on who’s in the room. And I can tell when the room changes versus just some ideas flying around.\n\nPatricia Taylor 9:51\n\nYes!\n\nLatasha Morrison 9:51\n\nWe can tell, we can always tell.\n\nPatricia Taylor 9:53\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nLatasha Morrison 9:53\n\nAnd I can feel with Hallmark there’s some changes happening in the room.\n\nPatricia Taylor 9:57\n\nYes.\n\nLatasha Morrison 9:57\n\nAnd I think you know you’re seeing that because before when we would see the Christmas movies, it would be a Christmas movie where you can tell the script wasn’t probably written about us or for us.\n\nPatricia Taylor 10:08\n\nRight.\n\nLatasha Morrison 10:09\n\nBut they just put some brown faces in it.\n\nPatricia Taylor 10:11\n\nYeah, exactly. They just plop them in there. (laughter)\n\nLatasha Morrison 10:14\n\nThe jokes weren’t the same, the music was disconnected. It’s like, you know, we can tell that, right? We know. Because we’re gonna connect to it with just certain sayings that they would say. I think last year, there was one where everything about the movie, it was kind of like, I don’t think this was like written by someone that was a person of color. But there was one when the guy walked outside, it was an older Black man. And he walked outside and he said, “Whew. The Hulk is out here.” (laughter) And my grandfather used to say that all the time. And I was like ah! And right then it was like, okay, it made a connection.\n\nPatricia Taylor 10:54\n\nIt made a connection.\n\nLatasha Morrison 10:54\n\nIt made a connection.\n\nPatricia Taylor 10:57\n\nHe’s the one who owned the Christmas tree lot. I saw that one. (laughter)\n\nLatasha Morrison 11:00\n\nOkay, we could play trivia. I would know none of the characters names or the titles, but I can describe them. And so Patty is the one that knows the names of the characters, and their real names, their on stage names.\n\nPatricia Taylor 11:16\n\nRight. I got the details. I have the notes. I got the checklist.\n\nLatasha Morrison 11:17\n\nI have the highlights.\n\nPatricia Taylor 11:17\n\nRight, exactly. (laughter)\n\nLatasha Morrison 11:17\n\nAnd that tells you a little bit about our personality, like I can talk in circles about it, but she can give you the details about the show. But you know, one of the things I would say is I’ve seen there’s just this change in you know, from just having Black people just on the show, on the movies, but also I’m seeing there’s just this a lot of Latinx community…\n\nPatricia Taylor 11:46\n\nYes, Asian community.\n\nLatasha Morrison 11:48\n\n…Asian community. And it’s not just what the Christmas movies it’s with all of the communities. Even our Indigenous community.\n\nPatricia Taylor 11:55\n\nYeah, I was going to say that.\n\nLatasha Morrison 11:56\n\nSo, we’re going to be speaking to it from a racial standpoint as we’re dealing with ethnicity, but even LGBTQ, you know, all of those. I’m just seeing the world is being represented, the world that we live in.\n\nPatricia Taylor 12:07\n\nExactly, and age, too. You know, not everyone is finding love at 29.\n\nLatasha Morrison 12:11\n\nYou mentioned that!\n\nPatricia Taylor 12:14\n\nYou know, “Looking back on our first love, like I’m in my 60s, and I wonder what happened to her.” Like, there’s a movie about that this year.\n\nLatasha Morrison 12:20\n\nAnd everyone’s not a widower, you know. (laughter)\n\nPatricia Taylor 12:23\n\nRigth? People get divorced. I mean it’s just the reality!\n\nLatasha Morrison 12:25\n\nThings happen. People sometimes, you know, there was a representation this year of someone who they couldn’t have children. And just to bring that into the storyline, you know, even at Christmas, they did a great job.\n\nPatricia Taylor 12:38\n\nRight.\n\nLatasha Morrison 12:38\n\nBut, I want to find out from you.\n\nPatricia Taylor 12:42\n\nOkay.\n\nLatasha Morrison 12:42\n\nSo there’s been a lot of progression. We’ve seen the transformation that’s happened. And we’ll even talk about even what they did last year as it relates to leadership with Hallmark in a minute. But, what is your favorite so far this year? Your favorite Christmas? And why?\n\nPatricia Taylor 13:02\n\nOkay, you know, I don’t like to choose a favorite. There’s too many.\n\nLatasha Morrison 13:05\n\nI know, I know. You said that last year!\n\nPatricia Taylor 13:06\n\nI know I did. I say it every time. Okay, but I will say, okay, there are a few that I’m like, I’m saving this one. I’m never getting rid of it. (laughter)\n\nLatasha Morrison 13:16\n\nI do have a lot of them on DVR.\n\nPatricia Taylor 13:15\n\nI do. I have some recorded. (laughter) But I would say the first one I actually saw this season has stuck with me. And that was called Christmas in My Heart with Luke Macfarlane, who’s one of my favorites, and Heather Hemmens. And they had a lot of representation that again connects with me because it was about interracial love and there was a biracial girl. So let me say this first because again, if you know me, I will not be your friend if you do spoilers, okay?\n\nLatasha Morrison 13:16\n\nRight, right. (laughter)\n\nPatricia Taylor 13:18\n\nLike, I want to sit and watch a movie without anyone telling me anything. I don’t want you to ruin anything. But if you’re listening to this podcast, spoilers are coming. So be warned. (laughter) Okay, so he was a widower, but he was married to a Black woman.\n\nLatasha Morrison 14:02\n\nYeah.\n\nPatricia Taylor 14:03\n\nAnd they have a biracial daughter. And then there’s this other story of a biracial woman who just lost her Black mother, and she was a violinist. And so like that was, you know, they ended up meeting and his daughter played the violin. But I really appreciated the representation of just the family structure, but also Sheryl Lee Ralph was the grandmother.\n\nLatasha Morrison 14:21\n\nYes!\n\nPatricia Taylor 14:22\n\nAnd there were moments like, I almost teared up because the daughter, the little girl, they had like their grandma daughter time, and it was about hair, doing her hair. And she said something to the effect of, “Well, I think my hair should be straight because it looks more professional. And you know, when I watch videos of violinists and people and in the concerts, their hair doesn’t look like mine.” And just to see that moment happen, and we know like the fact that we have to have…\n\nLatasha Morrison 14:48\n\nIn a Hallmark movie!\n\nPatricia Taylor 14:49\n\n…in a Hallmark movie, okay! Where she was affirming her and, “You can wear your hair however. And who says that? And why do you think, why would you think that’s professional? Who’s defining that for you?” And in a time where we actually have to have something called the Crown Act to protect, you know, Black women in the workplace to be able to wear our hair as it actually comes out of our head. Like that was a huge step to see that on the Hallmark channel.\n\nLatasha Morrison 15:15\n\nThat was huge. And then the grandmother’s mannerisms, Sheryl Lee Ralph, if you know her. Yes, she’s big on camera.\n\nPatricia Taylor 15:18\n\nYes, she has that presence.\n\nLatasha Morrison 15:23\n\nYes, she just has a presence. When she made that face when she was doing the girl’s hair. And then to see the little girl sleeping in a bonnet.\n\nPatricia Taylor 15:32\n\nRight! I was telling you she had a bonnet on.\n\nLatasha Morrison 15:34\n\nI was like, I know we were in the room. We wrote that script. Like, I mean, just different. things and how it was addressed.\n\nPatricia Taylor 15:41\n\nAnd the Black angel. You know, that was, yeah. I made my husband watch that one with me. I was like, “Look. It’s our family! We can be on Hallmark!” (laughter)\n\nLatasha Morrison 15:49\n\nThat was one of mine, too. That was one of mine. I think the other one that I like this season, and I’m not trying to say that all the ones with Black people were my favorite.\n\nPatricia Taylor 16:01\n\nRight.\n\nLatasha Morrison 16:02\n\nBut it’s the things that I connect with. So it makes it my favorite because there’s things that I connect with and to see the progression was Christmas in Harlem.\n\nPatricia Taylor 16:11\n\nYeah. Oh Holiday in Harlem.\n\nLatasha Morrison 16:13\n\nYeah, Holiday in Harlem. There you go with the details! There you go. (laughter)\n\nPatricia Taylor 16:16\n\nWith Olivia. I got you covered. Olivia Washington, who you just told me is Denzel Washington’s daughter.\n\nLatasha Morrison 16:21\n\nDenzel Washington’s daughter was in it.\n\nPatricia Taylor 16:23\n\nI like that one, too. She also had a satin scarf on when she went to sleep. I was like, “Go sis!”\n\nLatasha Morrison 16:27\n\nExactly. And just that story of her going to see her grandmother and just what they were doing for the community. I think it showed a lot of the collectiveness in our community and how it is different. When you don’t come home for Christmas, or you don’t go to grandma’s or auntie’s, it is kind of like this thing like, “Why don’t they come home?” You know? And we have some of that in our family now. Where it’s like, “Why such and such don’t come home? Like, you know, I want to see her. What’s going on?” You know? And so I think that was some of the that you saw in there just about her coming home…\n\nPatricia Taylor 17:02\n\nYes.\n\nLatasha Morrison 17:02\n\n…and reconnecting with her community and not being disconnected. Like you can be successful and do the things but still being able to connect back with your family and your community.\n\nPatricia Taylor 17:12\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nLatasha Morrison 17:13\n\nAnd what I loved about that is because she’s a chocolate girl, she’s dark skinned.\n\nPatricia Taylor 17:17\n\nAnd she’s curvy!\n\nLatasha Morrison 17:18\n\nYes! And I loved that about that.\n\nPatricia Taylor 17:21\n\nDifferent body types. Yes.\n\nLatasha Morrison 17:22\n\nAnd she was a lead role in there. And so that was something different because sometimes, you know, in the movies, you know, you don’t have the diversity of body types. And then, you know, colorism is big.\n\nPatricia Taylor 17:34\n\nRight. Because yeah, you can still say well, we have a quote unquote, representation. But my sister likes to say the Disney approved kind.\n\nLatasha Morrison 17:41\n\nYes!\n\nPatricia Taylor 17:42\n\nYou still, like, again, you still have the same shape and can’t be darker than a certain shade.\n\nLatasha Morrison 17:47\n\nRight, right.\n\nPatricia Taylor 17:47\n\nSo to see that brought in was really great.\n\nLatasha Morrison 17:49\n\nBecause I was feeling some kind of way because when I went this year, when the movies came out, I started looking because I was trying to get Rukiya.\n\nPatricia Taylor 17:55\n\nRight. Rukiya Bernard! I love her!\n\nLatasha Morrison 17:56\n\nBecause I wanted to interview her because she had done, what’s the movie?\n\nPatricia Taylor 18:04\n\nOh, the Christmas in Evergreen series. It ended last year, but she was the lead in that one last year.\n\nLatasha Morrison 18:12\n\nAnd I like her and I follow her on social media. So I was following her. And I wanted to have her on, and then I looked through and I was like, she’s not in any of them. So I was feeling a little, some kind of way because you know she got that skin.\n\nPatricia Taylor 18:25\n\nShe got that chocolate dark skin. She has the representation.\n\nLatasha Morrison 18:26\n\nYeah! And I was like, okay, I feel a little better you had Olivia Washington in there. So I think that was one of my favorites. And then the other thing that they did they were talking about food.\n\nPatricia Taylor 18:39\n\nYes.\n\nLatasha Morrison 18:40\n\nAnd you know the kitchen is really sacred in our community. So they were talking about food, and they said it was time for her to get the mac and cheese recipe. And we know like let me tell you. Let me just tell y’all. Black folk in our community, I don’t know how it is in the Latinx community, I can’t speak to the Asian community, but I’m pretty sure like if you mess something up, you know. Like I got fired, I got fired from the collard greens and I make collard greens good but they said that my aunt makes them better and I got fired. And then they fired my great art from making mac and cheese because like they would like it was a little too crispy. And I mean how are you gonna fire your great aunt? (laughter) And then they tell you and make you feel bad. And so we know that cooking is just like sacred.\n\nPatricia Taylor 19:31\n\nYes.\n\nLatasha Morrison 19:32\n\nWe don’t play. Like the first thing is not about “Oh, what’s this dish right there?” The first thing, “Who made this?” (laughter)\n\nPatricia Taylor 19:40\n\nRight. Exactly. Whose is this? This is auntie’s or this cousin? This is grandma’s? Like whose is this? Who brought this?\n\nLatasha Morrison 19:47\n\n(laughter) Who made it? Who brought it? So they want to know all those details. But I got fired from the collard greens. (laughter) Which I have no problem, I’m like fire me from some more things. But I still can make the dressing, not the stuffing but the dressing, you know. And I just saw that translate in this movie. And so because when you can identify with that, you know, off screen and then when you’re watching the movie, it just makes you feel seen.\n\nPatricia Taylor 20:14\n\nOh yeah, that part really hit. Bcause I’m not a cook and I own that. But mac and cheese is my responsibility in the family. And I just, I made it for Turkey Day. And I was like, “Oh, see, that’s me.” Like I got passed on the family recipe for mac and cheese.\n\nLatasha Morrison 20:32\n\nYou can’t put too many noodles. You can’t put too much cheese.\n\nPatricia Taylor 20:34\n\nYou have to have a good ratio.\n\nLatasha Morrison 20:35\n\nIt has to be a good ratio. Yes.\n\nPatricia Taylor 20:38\n\nA little crisp, but not too much. (laughter)\n\nLatasha Morrison 20:40\n\nBut I thought it was really good. You know, it showed them as business owners.\n\nPatricia Taylor 20:44\n\nRight.\n\nLatasha Morrison 20:45\n\nAnd caring for their community. And I think there’s sometimes we can show just one side a lot in our community. You know, as it relates to movies and everything. So I love the diversity of just experience that you’re seeing in those. What if you…like because we talk about movies all the time, and I was like, sometimes I’m watching I’m like, “I can write this. I can write this.” You know? So if you could write a Christmas movie for Hallmark ,maybe BET, OWN, let’s say anyone (laughter) not just Hallmark. But we know Hallmark is the staple. Like what would it be around?\n\nPatricia Taylor 21:30\n\nWe really need to collaborate and do this for real.\n\nLatasha Morrison 21:33\n\nI know. (laughter)\n\nPatricia Taylor 21:34\n\nThat’s a good question, Tasha. I think that mine would center on this wonderful nonprofit organization that’s trying to bridge, (laughter) trying to be the bridge between different… (laughter)\n\nLatasha Morrison 21:45\n\nI think that would be a great movie! That would be a great Christmas movie.\n\nPatricia Taylor 21:48\n\nI mean, it would be. That’d be a great movie, you know, of bridge builders and the holiday spirit.\n\nLatasha Morrison 21:54\n\nAnd what we’re doing around the world and connecting people.\n\nPatricia Taylor 21:58\n\nAnd connecting people. And somebody can fall in love, too.\n\nLatasha Morrison 22:00\n\nYeah, yeah. Exactly.\n\nPatricia Taylor 22:03\n\nWe can do it all.\n\nLatasha Morrison 22:04\n\nI think I should find the love though, but. (laughter)\n\nPatricia Taylor 22:06\n\nYeah, I agree. Yes for that. Are you listening?\n\nLatasha Morrison 22:11\n\nWho would play you?\n\nPatricia Taylor 22:14\n\nI would play me. (laughter) We would be the stars in our own film.\n\nLatasha Morrison 22:20\n\nOh we would be the stars. Okay. So we want to write it, we want to play in it.\n\nPatricia Taylor 22:23\n\nWe want to write it. We want to star. We want Hallmark to do the things like behind the scenes. We need some fresh blood. We need some new life. (laughter)\n\nLatasha Morrison 22:31\n\nOkay, so we’re not gonna say, okay, okay. So we’re gonna write a movie.\n\nPatricia Taylor 22:36\n\nOkay, yes.\n\nLatasha Morrison 22:37\n\nAnd we’re gonna play in it.\n\nPatricia Taylor 22:38\n\nOkay.\n\nLatasha Morrison 22:39\n\nSo I think, because they need to add to…\n\nPatricia Taylor 22:41\n\nI mean, we could let professionals do it. As long as I’m an extra in there somewhere though. Like, I want to have that one line where it’s like, “It’s Christmas time!” (laughter)\n\nLatasha Morrison 22:52\n\nSo they had so many this year. And I’m thinking they…okay. So I wanted to mention there was one called Nine Lives of Christmas, I think it was. Or Nine Lives. And it was about, it was probably about four or five years ago they did this one when it was about a lady finding a cat.\n\nPatricia Taylor 23:12\n\nOh yeah, that was like seven years ago. Yeah, that was one of my favorites.\n\nLatasha Morrison 23:15\n\nThe lady finds a cat. Or the guy, the firefighter finds a cat. And then he connects with this girl and all the things.\n\nPatricia Taylor 23:25\n\nYes.\n\nLatasha Morrison 23:26\n\nAnd so you see it goes off. And then they’re like together and so you think, in all these movies they’re together.\n\nPatricia Taylor 23:32\n\nThey live happily ever after.\n\nLatasha Morrison 23:34\n\nBut they actually did a remake. Well, not a remake, but they did a part two.\n\nPatricia Taylor 23:39\n\nYes. The Nine Kittens of Christmas.\n\nLatasha Morrison 23:40\n\nNine Kittens of Christmas.\n\nPatricia Taylor 23:41\n\nThis is the one that stars Brandon Routh and Kimberley Sustad.\n\nLatasha Morrison 23:45\n\nOkay, yes, she’s in a lot of them.\n\nPatricia Taylor 23:47\n\nYeah, she is.\n\nLatasha Morrison 23:47\n\nYeah. And so that one right there. I thought that was neat how like seven years later to kinda see what happened. And to see that they didn’t end up together.\n\nPatricia Taylor 23:59\n\nRight.\n\nLatasha Morrison 24:00\n\nBut then they ended up.\n\nPatricia Taylor 24:01\n\nBut they came back.\n\nLatasha Morrison 24:02\n\nSpoiler alert. (laughter)\n\nPatricia Taylor 24:02\n\nSpoiler alert, they came back together. But I mean, she went and pursued her career.\n\nLatasha Morrison 24:06\n\nYeah.\n\nPatricia Taylor 24:06\n\nAnd he was very content where he was. And, you know, they tied in a lot of that. So there was a part of me that I love that first movie. So I’m like, how is this one going to be? (laughter) But it was really cute.\n\nLatasha Morrison 24:17\n\nThere was one that you had with the Asian American lead.\n\nPatricia Taylor 24:20\n\nOh I loved that one. That was the oh, The Boyfriends of Christmas Past I think.\n\nLatasha Morrison 24:27\n\nYeah, I saw bits and pieces of it.\n\nPatricia Taylor 24:28\n\nYeah, that one was really cute. It was, I believe that, I don’t have the actor’s name for that one. But I believe the lead was Korean American and the female, and then the male was Indian.\n\nLatasha Morrison 24:39\n\nOkay.\n\nPatricia Taylor 24:40\n\nAnd it was just, it was really cute. So yeah, it was just really cute. And again, like just tying in you know speaking language and culture. And they had a lot of focus around food, too, and having a family buffet. And who’s gonna bring what, and you know, she got to bring the drinks because apparently she couldn’t cook either. (laughter) But yeah, that was a lot of fun. And that was great to see.\n\nLatasha Morrison 25:03\n\nI think they have about 30, over 30 films and now we’re gonna switch channels\n\nPatricia Taylor 25:10\n\nBefore we do, though, I do want to say just because you mentioned this. You know, just like what we come across often in our work is people think of it with like a Black white binary.\n\nLatasha Morrison 25:19\n\nYeah.\n\nPatricia Taylor 25:19\n\nAnd, so I also got excited to say, oh, like there’s an Asian leader. Not just the silent, not just a friend, but like an Asian lead. And even with like the interracial relationships it’s not just Black and white, there’s, you know, Asian and white or you know, Black and Latina. You know, and so it’s just, so I just wanted to mention that.\n\nLatasha Morrison 25:38\n\nThey are doing that a lot that. And I saw that in the the one with the sisters. Her husband is African American, she’s Asian American. They did a lot around adoption this year, too.\n\nPatricia Taylor 25:49\n\nThey did, yes.\n\nLatasha Morrison 25:50\n\nA lot around adoption and fostering. And I would say, okay, I love the one Holiday in Harlem, but I want to take it back, because I just saw, well I’m not gonna take it back.\n\nPatricia Taylor 26:02\n\nOur Christmas journey?\n\nLatasha Morrison 26:03\n\nI just saw Our Christmas Journey.\n\nPatricia Taylor 26:07\n\nWith Holly Robinson Peete. Yeah.\n\nLatasha Morrison 26:08\n\nYes. And that one was about a family who has a son who’s autistic.\n\nPatricia Taylor 26:12\n\nRight. And that’s personal for her because her son RJ.\n\nLatasha Morrison 26:15\n\nYeah, is autistic. And, I think they’re taking him to this, kind of like a boarding school, but they’re like testing it out. And it’s hard for her to let go. So you see the struggle that she’s having, where a lot of her identity has been placed in her son. She had another daughter, which I think Holly Robinson has like four kids in real life. But on the show, there was only two. And I don’t think this was her story. I think she played in this, but I just loved how they were bringing out like families that where kids are different, you know? And how they navigate that and the struggle within the marriage.\n\nPatricia Taylor 26:57\n\nRight.\n\nLatasha Morrison 26:57\n\nAnd there was some layers in this one, because a lot of times in the Christmas movies, there’s not a lot of layers.\n\nPatricia Taylor 27:02\n\nYeah, it doesn’t go that deep. (laughter)\n\nLatasha Morrison 27:04\n\nBut they had these layers of the dynamic between her and her son, the daughter feeling like she was kind of second class or second place. And so her dealing with her dynamic. And then dealing with the grandmother, they were staying at a cottage where a woman had lost her mom at Christmas time. So there were these layers where sometimes the layers where you try to bring out too much too quick too soon.\n\nPatricia Taylor 27:31\n\nRight.\n\nLatasha Morrison 27:31\n\nAnd I see that happen in a lot of movies where you can get lost. But I love the fact that they were dealing with some issues that I hadn’t seen dealt with, especially in a holiday movie, and it was still a holiday movie.\n\nPatricia Taylor 27:45\n\nYes, absolutely.\n\nLatasha Morrison 27:46\n\nIt was really good. And so, and I know families who have children like that, that was something that they’re going to connect with. So I also look at, like, maybe it’s not a movie that I connect with, but then somebody else can connect with it.\n\nPatricia Taylor 27:46\n\nYeah, exactly.\n\nLatasha Morrison 28:02\n\nSo yeah. So I had to give a shout out to Hallmark for really integrating that. And the one where the young lady she had had a foster child that went back with their mom.\n\nPatricia Taylor 28:17\n\nThat one was interesting. That was one of the Mrs. Miracle ones. And that’s also been one that’s been done several times from Debbie Macomber’s books, I think. So there are a lot of them. And those tend to be like very like light and like fun. And so this one was interesting, because she’s grieving. The mom, you know, talks about her struggles with infertility, and they had a foster son who they thought they would adopt. And then he ended up being re reunified with his mom. And so watching it now with like, knowing people who have been in that situation, and again, like, I don’t know, if five years ago, I would have thought of this. Yeah, but thinking about it through the lens of I wonder how this is being received for those who have been in foster care or who have been adopted. And so there was just one thing I was waiting for, which was to say very clearly, like your feelings are valid.\n\nLatasha Morrison 29:11\n\nYes.\n\nPatricia Taylor 29:11\n\nAnd your grief is real. And he is back with his mom.\n\nLatasha Morrison 29:15\n\nYes.\n\nPatricia Taylor 29:15\n\nAnd and so I was like waiting, you know, for that to happen. And it came, it came. But that was just so important to acknowledge that.\n\nLatasha Morrison 29:21\n\nWhy do you think it came?\n\nPatricia Taylor 29:22\n\nBecause someone had to be in the room to say that because otherwise it was going to be fluffy and like oh, she’s sad and then okay, we’re moving on. But let’s not forget about the birth mom. Let’s not forget about this little boy is now back with his mom.\n\nLatasha Morrison 29:35\n\nRight, right.\n\nPatricia Taylor 29:36\n\nAnd that’s important.\n\nTandria Potts 29:39\n\nIf you are listening to today’s podcast and would like to become a bridge builder in your community, guess what? Be the Bridge programs are available for youth, college students, adults, BIPOC, and transracial adoptees and adoptive parents. Our desire is for people to have healthy conversations about race. So we’ve provided guides to lead people through these discussions, visit our shop at BeTheBridge.com to grab a guide and start conversations in your community.\n\nLatasha Morrison 30:11\n\nI think that’s good. Even with the one with the three sisters. One of the storylines is that she, all of them were adopted. And one reconnects with her biological mom, and just the kind of struggle of that. And her family being angry. And I remember seeing, it was like a reality show where the guy was interested in finding his family. But his actual adoptive family were angry at him for even attempting. You know, they really centered themselves. And I could just feel his pain where it didn’t have anything to do with them. And he loved them. And it didn’t change his love for them. But it was just something he wanted to know, he needed that for himself.\n\nPatricia Taylor 31:03\n\nHe needed that.\n\nLatasha Morrison 31:04\n\nAnd the fact that they couldn’t understand that. And so he stopped the search, because he didn’t want to cause any tension with his his mom or his brother. And that was just really sad. So to see that, and they actually displayed a little bit of that, where her sisters were angry because she didn’t tell them.\n\nPatricia Taylor 31:25\n\nRight.\n\nLatasha Morrison 31:25\n\nAnd so I think pulling out these real life situations and circumstances, even around Christmas, because it’s gonna end well. (laughter)\n\nPatricia Taylor 31:35\n\nIt’s still gonna end well! And it’d be a little lighthearted. But we can still talk about complexities and not act like we are not multi dimensional, dynamic people. (laughter)\n\nLatasha Morrison 31:44\n\nRight, right. You know, we can’t have a Christmas podcast without mentioning a little bit of Falala Lifetime or what’s the other one? A Wonderful Lifetime.\n\nPatricia Taylor 31:55\n\nIt’s a Wonderful Lifetime and Falala Lifetime? (laughter)\n\nLatasha Morrison 31:58\n\nThere’s so many.\n\nPatricia Taylor 31:59\n\nThere’s too many to keep up with.\n\nLatasha Morrison 32:01\n\nAnd there was an article that came out that where there were 45 African American leads in Christmas movies this year. So there was, you know, where…\n\nPatricia Taylor 32:15\n\nAnd they break it down, like in channels and like where you can find them and everything.\n\nLatasha Morrison 32:19\n\nYes. Exactly. I don’t know if they have that for other ethnicities, but I was sent that one. And I thought that was just a good start. Because, I mean, 10 years ago, we could name it on one hand. And we’re going to talk about a little bit of another one a little bit later, but I wanted to mention the one on Lifetime, Merry Liddle?\n\nPatricia Taylor 32:42\n\nYes, Merry Liddle Christmas and Merry Liddle Wedding. And then this year is the Merry Liddle Baby.\n\nLatasha Morrison 32:49\n\nThis one was pretty good this year. And you have Kelly Rowland, and she’s not singing in it. She’s just acting. And just all the family dynamics…\n\nPatricia Taylor 32:59\n\nOh, yes. (laughter)\n\nLatasha Morrison 32:59\n\n…from her being this tech, very successful tech head. And you know, then getting married and then this year is about her having a baby. And I thought that one was really, really cute. And I’m gonna talk with Travon Potts about another one that’s on VH1 one a little bit later that he actually did the score and the music for. We gonna talk about music, we’re gonna talk a little bit later about that. But I’m so excited. Now we didn’t mention any from the mysteries channel.\n\nPatricia Taylor 33:35\n\nI know. Well, gosh. There are so many, Tasha!\n\nLatasha Morrison 33:38\n\nI know, I know. Okay, so if we’re talking about all things Christmas, all things Christmas. What is your favorite all time Christmas?\n\nPatricia Taylor 33:51\n\nI can’t answer that. (laughter)\n\nLatasha Morrison 33:55\n\nYou don’t like anything that says favorite. (laughter) What do you play the most?\n\nPatricia Taylor 34:02\n\nOkay, I can say that it does not feel like the Christmas season until A Motown Christmas is on.\n\nLatasha Morrison 34:07\n\nOkay, okay.\n\nPatricia Taylor 34:08\n\nIt has to happen.\n\nLatasha Morrison 34:10\n\nIs it Silent Night?\n\nPatricia Taylor 34:13\n\nI mean, just the whole soundtrack. Like A Motown Christmas. Gotta press play start to finish. Jackson Five. Diana Ross. Silent Night. All the above. We have, you know, Stevie doing Ave Maria. Come on. Come on. (laughter)\n\nLatasha Morrison 34:28\n\nI went to see Ain’t Too Proud, it’s a story about, a Broadway play about The Temptations. And so it was great. But I’m like, they didn’t do Silent Night. Like, I don’t know all their songs. But they didn’t do Silent Night. Yeah, you know, so. And I’m glad to see that some of the music you know, when we talk about that connection, when we start talking about inclusion like connecting some of the music in the movies. That’s really huge.\n\nPatricia Taylor 35:00\n\nThat’s huge because it just shows that through line, you know. Not that people were just stuck out there and say, “Look! Diversity.” I think even when you mentioned A Holiday in Harlem, like the mailman had swag walking down the street delivering mail in the opening scene with Dizzy Gillespie in the background. And I was like, what? (laughter) Even like the murals in the background, even like seeing the art in the house, and you’re like, “Oh, okay!”\n\nLatasha Morrison 35:06\n\nYes, all of that. All of that. And there was one it was, I think it was, I can’t remember it. Um, Harmony?\n\nPatricia Taylor 35:32\n\nOh, yes.\n\nLatasha Morrison 35:33\n\nYes. And even in that one, they were, I saw the wine that they were drinking. It was the…\n\nPatricia Taylor 35:33\n\nIt was the Black Girl Magic wine! Yes, that was Christmas in Harmony.\n\nLatasha Morrison 35:37\n\n…the Black Girl Magic! Yeah, Christmas in Harmony. And they were drinking the wine. They were like, the family was sitting there, I mean even to the placements, you know, that’s key. You know, where it wasn’t just something but that was like, and you can see it it was prominent in the movie. So I think those are, you know. And that was a cute one, too. It had Michelle Williams in it. And they were singing and yeah. Luke,\n\nPatricia Taylor 36:08\n\nLuke James. Luke James and Loretta Devine. Yes.\n\nLatasha Morrison 36:13\n\nLoretta Devine like she is just, she’s, I think of her and Sheryl Lee Ralph that have been in this.\n\nPatricia Taylor 36:22\n\nIconic.\n\nLatasha Morrison 36:22\n\nIconic. Yes.\n\nPatricia Taylor 36:23\n\nYes. Absolutely. Can I just tell you how stunning you look by the way? I was like oh you got your glitter. And those earrings are cute. Someone has some good taste. (laughter)\n\nLatasha Morrison 36:35\n\nActually, Patty gave me these earrings.\n\nPatricia Taylor 36:37\n\nOh, I did! (laughter)\n\nLatasha Morrison 36:38\n\nThey’re so cute. We have our Christmas colors on.\n\nPatricia Taylor 36:41\n\nI know, we have to be coordinated.\n\nLatasha Morrison 36:43\n\nTell them a little bit about these earrings, because they’re lightweight. And these are cute.\n\nPatricia Taylor 36:47\n\nThese are cute. Yeah, so the earrings that we’re both wearing are from a shop called Chosen and Free. And it’s a black woman owned shop. Her name is Lena. She’s based out of Minnesota. She hand makes everything and so I just you know, got to bring a little Christmas magic. And there were just so many things that we love about Christmas. Like we could spend hours talking about just Hallmark alone and breaking down the movies. But there’s so many things that we love. So we’re gonna share more about that, right, on our socials? About some of our favorite things and…\n\nLatasha Morrison 37:15\n\nOh you’re gonna share your favorite things? I thought you don’t have it, you don’t like sharing your favorites.\n\nPatricia Taylor 37:18\n\nYou know what, I have to narrow it down for the purpose of the graphic. (laughter)\n\nLatasha Morrison 37:22\n\nThat’s why we couldn’t do it on the show. Because they’re too many things.\n\nPatricia Taylor 37:27\n\nMy favorite things plural. Not singular. (laughter)\n\nLatasha Morrison 37:30\n\nI had like a list of so many things. And we’re like, okay, we’re gonna have to do that separate. So you guys have to stay tuned and watch out for a list of Patty and Tasha’s favorite things. Some of this are things that you can get people for Christmas, some of it’s Christmas related, some of it’s not, some of it’s really lifting up some of the young entrepreneurs that are out here or up and coming.\n\nPatricia Taylor 37:55\n\nGreat work and books. There’s so much. So many things. There’s so much.\n\nLatasha Morrison 37:59\n\nSo we’re gonna have those things. So make sure you pay attention to our socials after playing this podcast. And so was there anything else when we talk about all things Christmas? I mean, we didn’t get to go over all of the movies because we would be here for five hours. (laughter)\n\nPatricia Taylor 38:18\n\nUntil next Christmas. We would be here until next Christmas. (laughter)\n\nLatasha Morrison 38:21\n\nBut take some time during the Christmas season with your families to watch. I know it feels like Christmas starts. I always will…And I want to find out what movie do you always watch at Christmas time? Like I know a lot of people they watch Elf. Or they watch A Miracle on 34th Street. Or they watch The Santa Claus or the Peanuts Christmas, you know Charlie Brown Christmas or a Snoopy Christmas. But mine, and you know, you think about this as a relatively new movie. This Christmas. I love This Christmas. You know, I love that version of I think it’s Donny Hathaway’s song, you know that Chris Brown does. And he does a great job with that. And when I think of This Christmas I think of my grandmother because that was something that she, that was one of her favorite songs. And my mom, you know, until recently, we had a record player that looked like a chimney. Not a chimney, but like a fireplace. But it was when you open it up, it was a record player. And she would put on her Christmas, you know, music and, you know, stockings. And she would incorporate a little of the German traditions into our family like putting the treats in the shoes because my grandparents lived in Germany for a little bit because my grandfather was in the military. So I remember all of those things.\n\nPatricia Taylor 39:56\n\nI love that.\n\nLatasha Morrison 39:56\n\nSo it brings back so much just warm feelings about my grandmother. She’s no longer with us. And just the food and all those different things. So that’s, I would say, that’s probably one of my favorite songs. How about you?\n\nPatricia Taylor 40:13\n\nWhew, as far as movies. Well, I think, again, there’s so many. But I think a new one, which we did talk about last year, which is Jingle Jangle. With having three daughters, like that is now a new staple. I was telling some of the team this week, I have this dress that every time I wear it, one of my girls says, “You look like Journey.” And so for them to see that representation. And for us to watch that together. Like, every year going forward, like that is definitely on the list.\n\nLatasha Morrison 40:44\n\nAnd Jingle Jangle came at the right time.\n\nPatricia Taylor 40:45\n\nThe right time.\n\nLatasha Morrison 40:46\n\nLast year was such a hard year, you know, with the pandemic and everything and just having Jingle Jangle and just having that type of fun, full of music movie was great. So I think they need to do like, everything good I want a part two.\n\nPatricia Taylor 41:02\n\nRight. You want another one. (laughter)\n\nLatasha Morrison 41:05\n\nOr either not another one, but something similar to it. (laughter)\n\nPatricia Taylor 41:08\n\nRight. I know. And I think you know, I think the last thing I want to say in general (because, again, we could say so much more) why we love these movies for a lot of reasons, but the joy. And especially in the work that we do. It is a heavy, heavy, heavy load. And I know for me, I have to be intentional about pressing into joy, and not feeling guilty for just relaxing, for just laughing. You know, I’m so cognizant of what’s happening in our world and our nation and just having empathy and feeling so sad and heartbroken for things that aren’t going well. But I also just want to relax and have fun and have joy. And this is such a great, easy way to do that. And to be reminded of the season, be reminded that Jesus is with us all the time. That even as we go through these trials, it’s okay to smile and laugh and have joy.\n\nLatasha Morrison 41:25\n\nExactly. And I think it’s a form of self care. You know, for me, I look at it as a form of self care, a little bit escape from (not so much disconnecting from reality) but just a little pause in reality. And I think that’s why I like the movies. And you know, it’s like a tradition. I think it’s important, even as a single woman to have my own traditions.\n\nPatricia Taylor 42:33\n\nFor now. (laughter) Remember our Hallmark movie, right?\n\nLatasha Morrison 42:38\n\nIn the Hallmark movie we’re gonna write my story. Right?\n\nPatricia Taylor 42:41\n\nExactly. (laughter)\n\nLatasha Morrison 42:42\n\nBut I think, you know, just having my own traditions, and a part of my tradition is Hallmark. Like, you would not believe how many people know about it, and they send me when the list comes out.\n\nPatricia Taylor 42:53\n\nSame! I get tagged all over. I get tagged on Facebook. (laughter)\n\nLatasha Morrison 42:57\n\nIt’s just this, everybody talked about it. But then my mom now is watching the movies. My aunt is like, “I’ve already seen that one.” You know? So all these people are watching the Hallmark movies, because you know, we’re talking about it. So you guys, you know, I know, you know, everybody doesn’t love, some of you probably turned it off because as soon as we start talking about Hallmark you’re like, “I do not want to hear it.”\n\nPatricia Taylor 43:22\n\nWe still love you though. (laughter)\n\nLatasha Morrison 43:23\n\nBut we are connecting with all the women who feel like unicorns, especially women of color, who feel like unicorns because they like these types of movies. But I think there’s so much more to why we like them. I think it is an escape. And so now that we can see ourselves in them that’s like even a cherry on top.\n\nPatricia Taylor 43:45\n\nExactly.\n\nLatasha Morrison 43:46\n\nAnd we were going to mention before we go, Hallmark made a change. And I don’t know if we have the information.\n\nPatricia Taylor 43:53\n\nOh, to the CEO? Oh, I think Wonya Lucas is the CEO of Crown Media Family networks.\n\nLatasha Morrison 43:59\n\nWhat’s her name?\n\nPatricia Taylor 43:59\n\nWonya Lucas.\n\nLatasha Morrison 44:01\n\nWonya. See I hadn’t even looked that up. (laughter)\n\nPatricia Taylor 44:03\n\nWonya Lucas. Yeah. See what you do? So change has to happen from the inside.\n\nLatasha Morrison 44:06\n\nThey do! I think it’s if you want to see change on the screen and you want to see system change, you do have to change the power. Right, you know, and so I think that’s important. And you’re seeing that in there. And it’s not to say that you want to see all the movies where you connect to all of them. But at least let me connect to some of them. You know, I love that, I want see…\n\nPatricia Taylor 44:15\n\nHave something for everybody.\n\nLatasha Morrison 44:30\n\nYeah, have something for everyone. And I’m glad that people are connecting in various ways to different stories. They don’t have to be as cookie cutter. But you know, cookie cutters come in all sizes, shapes, and colors.\n\nPatricia Taylor 44:44\n\nThat’s right. That’s a word. (laughter)\n\nLatasha Morrison 44:48\n\nOh, cool. So we gotta take us out, Black Santa can you know take us out. And you know we can wrap it.\n\nPatricia Taylor 44:59\n\nThanks for having me, Tasha! I looked forward to this.\n\nLatasha Morrison 45:02\n\nWe’ll put our favorite song at the end of this. I was gonna sing it but I decided not to grace people with my voice.\n\nPatricia Taylor 45:21\n\nOh, okay. (laughter)\n\nLatasha Morrison 45:10\n\nSo you guys thank you for listening. This is an annual thing talking about all things Christmas. Make sure you tune into our social media to take a look at all of our favorite things. And we’re gonna have some great organizations and some, you know, I even have some favorite authors and some books that you can buy for Christmas all on there. But we’re going to continue this conversation because I want to talk about more about Christmas music.\n\nPatricia Taylor 45:38\n\nYes, have fun with that. Can’t wait!\n\nLatasha Morrison 45:40\n\nOkay!\n\nOh, man, we got the man with the master plan. (laughter) You know I was gonna do it. We got the one and the only from behind the scenes to in front. So you know what Travon has been behind the scenes, but he is the one who is the man with the master plan like I said in the beginning, who is putting the Be the Bridge podcast together. He is a part of the brilliance that does the heavy lifting. And he’s always behind the scenes. And he’s a friend. And he’s also really smart. And he does a lot of different things. And so he had the opportunity to work on a Christmas movie.\n\nTravon Potts 46:34\n\nYes, yes. Yes, we did.\n\nLatasha Morrison 46:35\n\nAnd so I wanted to talk to him about even the creative process. We talked about a lot of things with Patty. But I wanted to talk music with you.\n\nTravon Potts 46:48\n\nYes, absolutely. Absolutely.\n\nLatasha Morrison 46:51\n\nYou know, but who are you, Travon?\n\nTravon Potts 46:53\n\nWho am I? Who am I?\n\nLatasha Morrison 46:55\n\nLet the people know who you are so that they know. They can put some respect on your name when they’re listening to the Be the Bridge podcast.\n\nTravon Potts 47:04\n\nWell, I mean, when it when it comes to the Be the Bridge podcast, being producer, so producing the podcast. So, which entails a lot of the recording and all of that. And so what the Be the Bridge community is hearing, a lot of that is being put together and edited and all that stuff by me. So that is, that is a part of what I do. But I also come from the music world. That’s where I am. You know, been playing music since a kid, a small kid and, you know, playing for church choirs and all that stuff growing up. And then, I got into music, songwriting, and production. And so what is it? Some of your audience, they may know a song that I wrote “Angel of Mine” for Monica. And I’ve written other songs for different groups, different artists. But then moved more into the television and film space, and so working on music for different shows like let’s see Greenleaf…\n\nLatasha Morrison 48:07\n\nYeah!\n\nTravon Potts 48:08\n\n…BMF, Swagger, The Shy. Let’s see, the Whitney Houston movie, and then I was just…\n\nLatasha Morrison 48:19\n\nYou just threw that one out there. The Whitney Houston movie. Just some little things, you know.\n\nTravon Potts 48:28\n\nWe worked on a number of different things. And so, the blessing is to actually have worked on this movie, this Christmas movie that you’re speaking of, Adventures in Christmasing.\n\nLatasha Morrison 48:41\n\nOkay! That was was written and directed by?\n\nTravon Potts 48:48\n\nWell, it was executive produced by Kim Fields.\n\nLatasha Morrison 48:53\n\nOkay Kim Fields.\n\nTravon Potts 48:53\n\nWho was also starring in that movie along with Adrian Holmes. But it was directed by Troy Scott.\n\nLatasha Morrison 48:53\n\nOkay, okay.\n\nTravon Potts 48:55\n\nYeah. And, it was written by Rhonda Baraka, but it was from a story that Kim Fields, who is a co writer on it, it’s a story that she came up with.\n\nLatasha Morrison 49:14\n\nOkay.\n\nTravon Potts 49:15\n\nAnd so she collaborated with Rhonda to write this wonderful Christmas movie. And so it was a blessing to be a part of it as the music supervisor. She brought me in, as the executive producer, she brought me in as the music supervisor. So that’s my role with this film.\n\nLatasha Morrison 49:35\n\nSo I want to talk about that. But those of you who are listening, you probably have heard of Kim Fields. She’s been in Living Single. That’s the thing that, you know, those of you who are fans of that show, she was iconic. I mean, her comedic timing is just like, it’s just own spot. You may if you’re old enough, you may remember her from Good Times and from the Facts of Life and all these things, and a host of other movies, and then just recently the Upshaws.\n\nTravon Potts 50:15\n\nYeah, yeah. She was in the Upshaws. Exactly, exactly.\n\nLatasha Morrison 50:17\n\nWhich has some great writing, The Upshaws on Netflix. And we actually had the privilege of having Kim Fields on last year to talk about another Christmas movie that she was in and just her longevity in this industry and how she’s in front of the camera, behind the camera, she’s executive producer, she’s writing. I mean, and she’s been doing this, like since childhood. She’s incredible. And you know, she has to be gifted, because she’s still sustaining herself in this. So I’m glad you had the opportunity to work with her. And as the music supervisor, because I know you do, when you were doing Greenleaf you did a lot of composing.\n\nTravon Potts 51:05\n\nYeah, I did a lot of composing. Yeah.\n\nLatasha Morrison 51:06\n\nNow tell us the difference. (laughter) Because this is true, because we just talked about this and how this role is extremely important, especially when we’re communicating through films.\n\nTravon Potts 51:18\n\nYes, exactly.\n\nLatasha Morrison 51:19\n\nAnd so, tell us a little bit about the difference. And I’ll tell you how I know the difference.\n\nTravon Potts 51:24\n\nOkay. Absolutely. Absolutely. Well, there is a composer and then there’s a music supervisor.\n\nLatasha Morrison 51:31\n\nOkay.\n\nTravon Potts 51:31\n\nThe composer, brilliant, brilliant songwriter is Paul Wright. So he was the composer for the film. So that’s what you you deal with when you’re dealing with the score.\n\nLatasha Morrison 51:42\n\nOkay. Okay.\n\nTravon Potts 51:43\n\nSo with the score with a film, like you’ll hear strings in the background, and things that kind of move the mood and all of that? Well, as a music supervisor, I’m concerned about, and what I do is, I find the right songs.\n\nLatasha Morrison 51:57\n\nOkay.\n\nTravon Potts 51:57\n\nSo like, for instance, in this film, it was looking at different scenes and recognizing that a good song would fit in there. And so then I would do things like I would go and I would find the producers and the songwriters to come up with the songs. I would attach artists to those songs.\n\nLatasha Morrison 51:57\n\nOh!\n\nTravon Potts 51:57\n\nYeah. So I would do that. And then on top of that, I then have to get the songs licensed. Basically, we have to license the songs from the different songwriters and the producers that do it or the publishing companies that own the songs, all of that. And so it was a blessing because I was able to bring a lot of wonderful artists like Jonathan McReynolds. What is it, Kenny Lattimore.\n\nLatasha Morrison 52:51\n\nOkay!\n\nTravon Potts 52:51\n\nAlex Isley.\n\nLatasha Morrison 52:53\n\nOh, wow.\n\nTravon Potts 52:53\n\nAnd you mentioned Living Single, we actually have TC Carson on the soundtrack. So yeah, so it’s getting a lot of different artists. And we were able to introduce some artists like Penzillathegreat, and there’s an artist named Aerin. They’re different artists that we were able to introduce, as well as some established artists, some names that you already know. And we actually not only put these songs in the film, but we actually were able to create a soundtrack album where we have the score and we have the songs all in this one piece for Adventures in Christmasing. So that’s amazing.\n\nLatasha Morrison 52:54\n\nAnd it’s on Spotify, and you guys, I had the opportunity to listen to the soundtrack. And it is really nice. Like it’s really good. And my context when I was talking to Travon before this, I was like, you know, he was talking about, you know, the difference between the music supervisor and the composer. And I know he’s done stuff for like Greenleaf and you know a lot of different shows, but my connection was another Christmas movie, The Holiday.\n\nTravon Potts 54:02\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nLatasha Morrison 54:03\n\nJack Black. I think he’s like a music supervisor, either a composer in the movie. He talks about the back end of the movie and putting it, so you see him doing that in the movie. He talks about the famous two notes that are the greatest score of all time.\n\nTravon Potts 54:20\n\nYes!\n\nLatasha Morrison 54:21\n\nAnd it was the, “Duh, duh. Duh, duh.”\n\nTravon Potts 54:23\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nLatasha Morrison 54:27\n\nJaws. But if you remove that from the movie, it’s not the same. And so that’s the importance of the work that you do. You know, when I think about the Be the Bridge podcast, you can have great content, but if the sound is off, if things are not smooth like that can make or break. We see that even with TV shows. I was even watching a couple Hallmark movies and it had the people singing, and it wasn’t matching up. Or if the music doesn’t match it just looks like really weird. And so I’m just glad that you are behind the scenes.\n\nTravon Potts 55:09\n\nYes, yes.\n\nLatasha Morrison 55:10\n\nI know you’ve been doing this for a while. And so what have you seen? What progress have you seen? I know, is there a lot of diversity in this?\n\nTravon Potts 55:19\n\nIt wasn’t. But it’s starting to happen now. Like I mentioned with Kim Fields being the executive producer. She’s the one that hired me.\n\nLatasha Morrison 55:29\n\nOkay.\n\nTravon Potts 55:30\n\nAnd the composer is also African American. So the idea is that…and I found this like with Greenleaf, part of what they wanted is they wanted, it was a church television show, and they wanted it to have an authentic Black church feel in terms of the music. And, so with a lot of the shows that I’m working with, in wanting it to feel very authentic. Like for instance, in The Shy when doing music, when I was brought in, one of the songs that I was working on is they wanted it to feel like this house music from an earlier era. But you have to be kind of familiar with, “Okay, well, what is Black house music in Chicago sound like?” And the way that you do that is you have to get us to do that.\n\nLatasha Morrison 56:27\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nTravon Potts 56:28\n\nAnd so the more that you have Black directors, Black producers, Black executive producers, and all of that behind the scenes, they’re going and they’re grabbing us – the Black composers, the Black music supervisors, and all of that.\n\nLatasha Morrison 56:38\n\nThey do exist.\n\nTravon Potts 56:45\n\nYeah, yes, we do. We do. And we understand what the music and what the feel is, and how to make it authentic.\n\nLatasha Morrison 56:52\n\nYeah. And I think that goes to say for you know, if you’re doing an Asian Film.\n\nTravon Potts 57:00\n\nYes, exactly.\n\nLatasha Morrison 57:01\n\nIt’s gonna be important of who’s behind the scenes? I think sometimes we look at okay, who’s on camera?\n\nTravon Potts 57:07\n\nExactly.\n\nLatasha Morrison 57:08\n\nBut sometimes there’s a disconnect.\n\nTravon Potts 57:09\n\nYes.\n\nLatasha Morrison 57:10\n\nYou know, if behind the scenes doesn’t align with what’s on camera and we see that in script writing. I think it applies to music. Music is so key, especially to Christmas.\n\nTravon Potts 57:22\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nLatasha Morrison 57:22\n\nAnd how we connect to the audience. But I wanted to find out from you. What is your favorite, what is your favorite Christmas song of all times? Or are you one of those people that you don’t like to name favorites?\n\nTravon Potts 57:39\n\nOh, let’s see. Probably “This Christmas,” Donny Hathaway. I absolutely love that song.\n\nLatasha Morrison 57:49\n\nWhat do you like about it, though? Because that’s my favorite, too. But you see, you’re probably more technical then I am. I just like the way it feels. And it connects to history for me. Of course, I love the song.\n\nTravon Potts 58:00\n\nBut believe it or not, it is not technical. You know? Us as Black folks, we want to feel our music. And there’s something about that, that you know, just the sound and all that it makes me feel…I feel that the yams and the collard greens and the macaroni and cheese. Just with the sound and the feel and just knowing that that’s what I’m hearing in the background when I’m around family and Christmas time. So yeah, that’s what it is. It’s the same for me as you. It’s not even technical it’s a feel. I just feel it.\n\nLatasha Morrison 58:33\n\nOkay. Number two. Number two. Number two for me would be “Let it Snow” by Boyz II Men.\n\nTravon Potts 58:40\n\nOh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.\n\nLatasha Morrison 58:42\n\nLet it Snow. And I saw they have, I think one of them they have sons. A couple of daughters. But they sing and they’re on Instagram. And they redid that song.\n\nTravon Potts 58:54\n\nOh, wow.\n\nLatasha Morrison 58:55\n\nThey’re incredible. Wanya. Wanya, he has kids. I think they’re the Wanya Group or something like that. But it’s a whole bunch of them. He’s got like a good group of kids. But they can sing.\n\nTravon Potts 59:10\n\nYeah. Wow. Oh that’s awesome.\n\nLatasha Morrison 59:11\n\nAnd they redid that. So you gotta go find them on Instagram and listen to that. But I think “This Christmas,” “Let it Snow.”\n\nTravon Potts 59:18\n\nYeah.\n\nLatasha Morrison 59:19\n\nAnd you know, as we talk about these things, I think it’s important for us not just to – for people who are in this industry – to seek diversity you know, and inclusion like on screen but also behind the screen. And not even just limiting you to Black music. You know? I know you. I mean, you were listening to jazz when I came in. It was very diverse jazz. What’s that? That sounds like a little bollywood. (laughter) But I know like you don’t even with you not putting yourself in a box. I’m not putting you in a box where, you know. The same way, you know, like as an author, I’m an author that happens to be Black. But just calling, referring to, and putting me in a section where it’s just Black authors. And you choose that when you’re talking about that particular subject. But there’s a wide variety of things that I can talk on and speak on. The same way with you.\n\nTravon Potts 1:00:25\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nLatasha Morrison 1:00:26\n\nSo, you know, I think that’s important. What do you think about that, like, having opportunities to work on other films that, you know, maybe people don’t look like us in the movie?\n\nTravon Potts 1:00:35\n\nYeah, yeah. Well, I mean, that’s a word because I had 14 years of classical training. So so that’s what I started off with. So it’s kind of like, really, honestly, when it comes to all of the music that I know, and all the music that I came up with, having the opportunity to really go after it and do that in different types of settings, different types of films, it’s amazing opportunity, and it’s something that I love to do and can do. And it’s great that Hollywood’s kind of catching up to the fact that we can do all types of things. We can do the things that are very authentic to us that we know, but also that we we know those other areas as well. And so it’s a blessed time to be able to be a part of all of it and do all of it.\n\nLatasha Morrison 1:01:25\n\nYeah. Well, we wanted to take this time to just kind of pause and introduce the Be the Bridge community to the man that’s behind the scenes, as I say the man with the master plan. And bring him to the forefront, especially after I heard that you worked on this Christmas movie. And you know Christmas is like my favorite thing. And then you worked on it with Kim Fields. And I interviewed her last year.\n\nTravon Potts 1:01:51\n\nYes, yes.\n\nLatasha Morrison 1:01:52\n\nAnd just all the things that technical things that comes into producing and editing and all those things. So it’s just important on screen and off screen.\n\nTravon Potts 1:02:03\n\nYeah.\n\nLatasha Morrison 1:02:04\n\nAnd so we just wanted to have you on to talk to you about that. And let me tell you guys to check out this soundtrack for Adventures in Christmasing. Check out the movie. It was on VH1.\n\nTravon Potts 1:02:16\n\nYes. It’s still on. It’s still running on VH1.\n\nLatasha Morrison 1:02:20\n\nSo check out that movie and check out the soundtrack. And I think it’s on Spotify.\n\nTravon Potts 1:02:25\n\nYes, it’s on Spotify. Was it iTunes, any of the Apple music, and any of the music platforms, you will find it. Please, please, please go check it out.\n\nLatasha Morrison 1:02:40\n\nAnd if you haven’t heard Brandy’s “Angel of Mine” go ahead and download that.\n\nTravon Potts 1:02:44\n\nWell, Monica.\n\nLatasha Morrison 1:02:46\n\nOkay. Well, if you haven’t heard Monica’s song “Angel of Mine” make sure you go ahead and download that.\n\nTravon Potts 1:02:54\n\nYes.\n\nLatasha Morrison 1:02:55\n\nI even called you Trayvon Martin. What is wrong with me? I’m tired.\n\nTravon Potts 1:03:01\n\n(laughter) That’s being an editor. I’ll edit that out.\n\nLatasha Morrison 1:03:06\n\nEdit that out. Edit that out, Travon. (laughter) Edit that out. Okay, but thank you so much for joining us.\n\nTravon Potts 1:03:10\n\nNo, thank you for having me.\n\nLatasha Morrison 1:03:11\n\nNow you guys have a face with what’s happening behind the scenes on the Be the Bridge podcast.
