        "text": "Established in 1904, the California Courts of Appeal form the largest state-level intermediate appellate court system in the United States. The California Courts of Appeal are the state’s intermediate courts of review and their primary function is to ensure that the law is interpreted and applied correctly.\n\nThe California Courts of Appeal have appellate jurisdiction in cases where the Superior Courts have original jurisdiction and in certain other cases prescribed by statute. They review the final judgment or appealable orders for prejudicial errors of law, except for cases of death penalty. These courts do not hear testimony, retry cases, or reconsider the factual findings of the judge or jury.\n\nThese courts also receive appeals, or writ proceedings, from decisions of the Workers’ Compensation Appeals Board, the Agricultural Labor Relations Board, and the Public Employment Relations Board. Like the Supreme Court, the Courts of Appeal have original jurisdiction in habeas corpus, mandamus, certiorari, and prohibition proceedings. In most writ proceedings, the court has discretion about whether to decide the merits of the claims set forth in the petition.\n\nThere are six appellate districts in California, divided on the basis of geography by the California Legislature, which may be further divided into divisions. Each appellate district (or division) has a Presiding Justice and at least two Associate Justices. There are a total of 106 appellate justices serving the six California Appellate districts.\n\nJustices are appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the Commission on Judicial Nominations, which consists of the Chief Justice, the Attorney General, and the Presiding Justice of the Court of Appeals of the affected district, or if there are 2 or more Presiding Justices, the one who has presided longest. They are appointed for a term of 12 years, subject to retention by the public at the next general election following appointment and confirmation and at the conclusion of each term.\n\nCalifornia Appellate Districts\n\nThe First District Court of Appeal\n\nThe First Appellate District serves the following twelve Northern California counties: Alameda, Contra Costa, Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Marin, Mendocino, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Solano, and Sonoma. This district has 20 justices that review over 2,000 criminal, civil, and juvenile appeals and over 1,300 original proceedings each year.\n\nThe First District Court of Appeal is divided into five divisions, which each have four judges. Originally, in 1905, the First Appellate District had only three justices. However, as the district has grown, more justices have had to be appointed to serve the population.\n\nThe Court of Appeals for the First Appellate District is required to hold its regular sessions at 350 McAllister Street, San Francisco, CA 94102.
