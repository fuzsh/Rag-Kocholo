        "text": "Cast-in-Place Concrete\n\nBasel Alaroudaki, Nicholas Burns, Ulises Fuentes, Walter Guzman, Katey Paraskiewicz, Joe Wiley Baker Concrete Construction\n\nProject Name: Skymark at Reston Town Center, Reston, VA\n\nArchitect: Solomon Cordwell Buenz\n\nEngineer: Thornton Thomasetti\n\nGeneral Contractor: Clark Construction Group\n\nBaker was responsible for the cast-in-place concrete for Skymark at Reston Town Center, a mixed use residential development with residential, office, retail, and parking space. The 41-story structure (the tallest residential building in the DMV and the third largest overall structure in the DMV) features 46,000 cubic yards of concrete and 6,500 tons of rebar. This included a complicated 7,400 cubic yards of mat slab poured in just three separate pours over three weeks that required significant coordination with mass concrete specifications. The structure also features large outrigger shearwalls on eight floors that extend from the building core to the edge of slab.\n\nPrecast Concrete\n\nCraftsmen with Gate Precast Company – Oxford\n\nProject Name: Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Gardens Facade Repair, Washington, DC\n\nArchitect: CallisonRTKL/Arcadis\n\nGeneral Contractor: Grunley Construction Company\n\nThe level of care for the precast panel aesthetics achieved extraordinary results. Each panel is fabricated by hand from initial fabrication of wood forms, hand sorting of aggregate to placement of concrete in the forms, blasting the surface of the panel to expose the aggregate and shipment. Each panel required technically skilled craftsman for blasting to ensure consistency and quality amongst all 675 panels. Every single panel received a full 35 item inspection upon delivery to site. If there were any items noted for adjustment these were addressed. Any spot of concrete matrix greater than 1” in any direction without aggregate and any void greater than ¼” in depth was addressed. Each panel was thoroughly reviewed following install as well to ensure a seamless appearance regarding exposure, texture and joints.\n\nStar Awards Nominee\n\nKayla Flores, Erik C. High Concrete Group\n\nProject Name: Conway School of Nursing and Campus Gateway, Washington, DC\n\nArchitect: Ayers Saint Gross\n\nEngineer: Simpson Gumpertz & Heger\n\nGeneral Contractor: Clark Construction Group\n\nThe most striking element of the project is the beautiful precast that wraps around the building. High Concrete Group did an extraordinary job with the façade of the building. On a daily basis, they safely set 4-6 panels per day, which was impressive based on tight site conditions in downtown DC, which required offloading, tripping, and placing precast off of one mobile crane. The most challenging part of the scope was High Concrete’s placement of panels on the south side, which required reaching up and over the building to place the panels on the entire west side of the building. Despite the challenge, they completed the work successfully.\n\nMiguel A Diaz Fuentes, Angel E Diaz Hernandez, Victor Lemus, Jose Amadeo Marquez, Wilfredo Orellana, Santos R Guevara Zelaya R. Bratti Associates, Inc.\n\nProject Name: Metropolitan Park, Arlington, VA\n\nArchitect: ZGF\n\nGeneral Contractor: Clark Construction Group\n\nR. Bratti’s scope included the architectural precast for the two towers. Although the medium was to be precast, the similarity between the complexity of this requirement and the usual natural stone scope blended perfectly. The project consisted of many exterior amenity balcony terraces throughout the North and South towers of this project. Each Terrace’s design has a highly ornate and heavily landscaped space with organic shapes for benches, planters, and kitchen counters. Hundreds of molds were required to manufacture these pieces, and many were unique to one piece due to each piece’s radii transitions and height. Foam molds were fabricated with CNC technology based on digital 3D models developed throughout the submittal process.\n\nLighting Systems\n\nRachid Abdessamad, Jared R. Crossley, Patrick Flaherty, Edwin Gutierrez, Jinhan Kim, Karla Martinez Dynalectric Company\n\nProject Name: In-Q-Tel, McLean, VA\n\nArchitect: sshape\n\nEngineer: GHT Limited\n\nGeneral Contractor: HITT Contracting\n\nDynalectric showed a great amount of organization and accountability in their efforts of purchasing and tracking all 50 light fixture types from across the country. The level of effort only increased when the fixtures arrived on-site and the layout process began. All fixtures are in perfect alignment with various ceiling types, ranging from undulating fabric baffles and millwork panels to exposed ceilings. The attention to detail and high-quality work is shown through Dynalectic’s efforts in maintaining all of the alignments and their installation of the fixtures, especially evident in the custom oblong shaped, translucent stretched-fabric light fixture above the reception desk.\n\nClaudia Hernandez, Malcolm Hunter, Jeff Orr, Eric Robinson, Scott Stevens, James Waring Valid Electric Company\n\nProject Name: Lifetime Fitness, Arlington, VA\n\nArchitect: RSP Architects\n\nEngineer: Emanuelson-Podas\n\nGeneral Contractor: Turner Construction Company\n\nValid Electric performed a scope of work that involved renovating a Clarendon Loft Office Space into a Luxurious athletic country club. The renovation outfitted with an extensive lighting package (2000 Fixtures) to include LED lighting throughout the space, Fiber optic lighting for the saunas and steam rooms, WattStopper Relay Panels to control the workout Floor, LED cove and tape lighting, Backlit Mirrors, to Specialty fixtures and Grand Chandeliers in the Café and LTWork. Difficulty on this project was that it was inundated with change orders, some mandated in the eleventh hour with Arlington County. Additionally, there was a significant BIM effort in the basement that delayed starting work in this area.\n\nSteven Berry, Charles DePhillip Jr., Douglas Gregory ll, Okechukwu Igwenagu, Jason Lockey, Adam Payne JE Richards\n\nProject Name: Metropolitan Park – Project Coco, Arlington, VA\n\nArchitect: ZGF\n\nEngineer: GHT Limited\n\nGeneral Contractor: Clark Construction Group\n\nThe lighting system installed is controlled by ETC (Electronic Theater Controls) lighting controls. With the use of DMX (Digital Multiplex), the space can be transformed with many different color changing LEDs. This is accomplished with 55 different lighting zones. These zones consisted of 412 linear feet of phase dimmable track lighting, custom curved RGBW linear pendant lighting, 143 ft. of recessed LED toe kick lighting in the mill-work, 92 linear feet of recessed LED mill-work lighting, approx. 30,000 LEDs back-lighting a custom art wall, and Horticulture stage lighting.\n\nCharles DePhillip Jr., Douglas Gregory ll, Cornell Houston, Ryan Potts, Jonathan Spivey, Aaron Steppler-Krieg JE Richards\n\nProject Name: Metropolitan Park – Center of Energy, Arlington, VA\n\nArchitect: NBBJ\n\nEngineer: GHT Limited\n\nGeneral Contractor: Clark Construction Group\n\nThe lighting control system was a Lutron system that allowed remote control of each floor individually, and tied in with the base building lighting controls. This system can be remotely controlled from the other Amazon headquarters. The space is for employees to come together and enjoy Amazons café’s, game rooms, and dog friendly seating, or congregate in their large meeting spaces and team suites. The lighting in this area was incorporated into various ceiling types from exposed concrete and fabric panels, to open wood structure beams. Considerable effort went into reducing visibility of the components that make the system work, such as LED drivers, lighting control devices and power raceways.\n\nRichard Arnold, David Hartman, Joshua Martin, Elmer Marquina, Luke Trevathan, Andrew Winslow JE Richards\n\nProject Name: Metropolitan Park – Tenant Improvements, Arlington, VA\n\nArchitect: Gensler\n\nEngineer: GHT Limited\n\nGeneral Contractor: Clark Construction Group\n\nThe lighting controls was a Lutron system that allowed remote control of each floor individually and tied in with the base building lighting control system. This can be remotely controlled back from the other Amazon headquarters. The TI space (Tenant Improvement) will be the office space for nearly 14,000 employees. Many hours went into VDC (Virtual Construction and Design) coordinating MEP and CSA trades with the lighting design. This aided in the installation of the lighting system to maintain consistent layout on each floor of each tower. Lingering supply chain constraints presented a unique obstacle sourcing lighting components in time for the installation schedule.\n\nPower Generation, Distribution and Switchgear\n\nSteven Berry, Charles DePhillip Jr., Douglas Gregory ll, Adam Payne, Ryan Potts, Collin Reitz JE Richards\n\nProject Name: Metropolitan Park – Tenant Improvements, Arlington, VA\n\nArchitect: Gensler\n\nEngineer: GHT Limited\n\nGeneral Contractor: Clark Construction Group\n\nJE Richards was responsible for the installation of electrical systems, normal and emergency power distribution, substations, switchgear, bus-duct, panels, transformers panel, disconnect switches, and light fixtures. The also completed delegated design of Digital Antenna System (DAS), Lightning protection system, and Fire Alarm and Life Safety Systems. The advanced and planned coordination schedule of the Core & Shell campus, plus the two tenant improvements and four floors of specialty amenity spaces required diligence and precision to evaluate pathways and overhead coordination of ceiling devices/elements.\n\nSean Lasalle, Pat Latham, Justin Lee, Peter Smith, Daniel Stamp, Mona Electric Group, Inc.\n\nProject Name: WMATA Bladensburg Bus Garage, Washington, DC\n\nArchitect: Michael Baker International\n\nEngineer: EPCM, Inc.\n\nGeneral Contractor: Hensel Phelps\n\nShepherd Parkway CNG includes a new Electrical Room, Compressor Room and Control room, which interfaces with the existing Shepherds Parkway Fuel Building. New electrical equipment was installed in the Electrical Room to provide Control and Power to the CNG Yard. Because this WMATA facility is currently in operation, daily coordination of the work was a key element in the success of this project. Despite the coordination challenges of integrating with an existing, and in-service facility, the field team rose to the challenge and kept consistent and open lines of communication with WMATA.\n\nAndrew Bean, Jesse Colie, Dwight Daniels, Bob Esteppe, Nick Long, Bob Spittle Singleton Electric Company\n\nProject Name: Piscataway Bioenergy Project, Accokeek, MD\n\nArchitect/Engineer: Stantec\n\nGeneral Contractor: PC Construction\n\nThis 4 year project (3 years for construction and 1 for commissioning) was very challenging. The power distribution included over 70,000′ of 4″ PVC ductbanks, 65,000′ of medium voltage cable, 160,000′ of 600V feeder wire. The distribution equipment included 10 medium voltage liquid filled transformers, (1) 4000A & (1) 3200A switchgear, (1) medium voltage generator sync switchgear, (2) 2000A MCC’s, (4) 1200A MCC’s, (1) 400A MCC, (38) panelboards, (27) dry transformers, (5) PDC structures, (170) disconnects, and over (100) VFD’s. Singleton Electric self-performed all splices and terminations including medium voltage splices and terminations.\n\nGeorge Breuninger, Michael Clements, Steven Cross, Anthony Fleming, Kevin Grubby, Kevin Pompey Power Solutions\n\nProject Name: VA21 – Project Vanquish, Sterling, VA\n\nArchitect: Corgan\n\nEngineer: KW Mission Critical Engineering\n\nGeneral Contractor: Whiting-Turner Contracting Company\n\nPower Solutions worked with EOR to perform “design assist” tasks; offering our expertise to design a constructible data center in a short time-frame. Power Solutions executed a full BIM model – determining proper equipment placement and conduit routing. EOR utilized Power Solutions model/design to update official drawing package. The VA2 campus consists of two data centers and a self-generation power plant, all being built simultaneously. All deliveries must be “just in time” as there is no lay-down available on-site. Each aspect of the electrical work received the time and detail required for aesthetics. A lot of minor details for a large scale, polished finished product.\n\nKenny Campbell, Michael Donahue, Jason Miller, Douglas Montenegro, Richard Reese, Craig Semler Power Solutions\n\nProject Name: Verizon Metro Communications Center Phase 1 Chiller Plant Installation, Washington, DC\n\nEngineer: Design Tech Inc.\n\nGeneral Contractor: W.E.Bowers\n\nThere was extensive planning and scheduling of outages with the owner and numerous tenants in the building. Temporary power was provided for some equipment during the job. The space that the new equipment was installed had limited ceiling heights and therefore the conduits runs had to be planned and coordinated with the other trades on the job. The craftsmanship involved in the planning and installation of the conduits is second to none. Part of the job involved intercepting an existing conduit run, and installing a junction box to allow the “H” tapping of the feeders that were feeding a switchgear in a different penthouse that housed chillers. Lengthy planning and temporary power was provided.\n\nWes Ditton, Greg Guisti, Tony Lambruno, Jeremy Rodkey, Chris Sartain, Juan Ventura Power Solutions\n\nProject Name: IAD2-3, 2-4, and 2-5, Ashburn, VA\n\nArchitect: HKS\n\nEngineer: DLB Associates\n\nGeneral Contractor: HITT Contracting\n\nOver 20,000’ of 6” RGC was installed at an elevation over 35’ from the ground for the installation of (3) new 35KV Switchboards. From these switchboards, along with existing MV switchboards, (39) MV Transformers, (39) Generators and (39) UPS Modules were installed. Structural Steel was provided and installed to support our feeders from (and between) the exterior equipment and to the interior switchboard line ups. Design changes and supply chain issues resulted in the projects Low Voltage incoming power being installed in cable tray and PVC interlock cable. Additional cable tray and interlock cables were installed between the interior boards and the final equipment in the Data Hall.\n\nJosh Hanks, Brian Hull, Kevin Hull, Thomas Lysinger, Nicholas Thompson, David Zimmerman Dynalectric Company\n\nProject Name: IAD2-5, Ashburn, VA\n\nArchitect: HKS\n\nEngineer: DLB Associates\n\nGeneral Contractor: HITT Contracting\n\nWith around 90,000FT of 2 1/2″ EMT conduit that needed to be installed, our coordination team and on-site team were in constant contact to ensure our conduit design meet the site constraints and would not require alterations as the installation progressed. Each data hall had four small locations that are 30,000 LF of conduit per data hall had to be installed in a 5-week duration. Dynalectric bent more than 2,800 bends of varying degrees that was installed needing no alterations once bent for the installation. This was due to our excellent communication of our BIM coordinators and site team that took the time up front to ensure the design took all challenges and constraints of the site into account.\n\nSean Damon, James Kingsbury, Wayne Kirkpatrick, Richard Ladow, Kevin Patterson, Scott Smith C3M Power Systems\n\nProject Name: WMATA Traction Power System Upgrades (Red/Green/Orange Lines), McLean, VA\n\nArchitect/Engineer: WMATA\n\nGeneral Contractor: C3M Power Systems\n\nThe WMATA Traction Power Systems Upgrade on the Red, Green, and Orange Lines (RGO) involved electrical rehabilitation to upgrade major power and supervisory equipment at five tiebreaker stations, 10 traction power substations, and one service and inspection shop. C3M continued to prove its capabilities to WMATA by expediting the schedule and working at seven locations at the same time. Over the course of the project, C3M was able to complete all fieldwork by the end of June 2023, over three weeks before contract completion. This was a result of effective execution by C3M’s talented craft labor and planning.\n\nSpecial Systems\n\nMike Barnes, Julius Che, Essence Crawley, Curtis Pollitt, Joe Raeder, Frank Tydings Singleton Electric Company\n\nProject Name: Smithsonian American History Museum Fire Alarm Replacement, Washington, DC\n\nEngineer: GHD\n\nGeneral Contractor: Grunley Construction Company\n\nThe project consisted of all new Head End Equipment, risers, 16 Fire Alarm Control Panels, 2 Annunciator Panels, 11 Terminal Cabinets, and 51 Notification Appliance Circuit panels. The project was a combination of replacing old devices with new as well as installation of new conduit, wire, and devices. Completing this work allowed for the demolition of the existing system. The new system has over 130 pull stations, 50 strobes, 850 speakers, 1500 speaker/strobes, 2000 smoke detectors, 200 duct smoke detectors, and over 500 modules as well as an extensive VESDA system. The work had to be completed at all different hours due to the needs of the Smithsonian.\n\nMike Abbott, Dwight Daniels, Bob Esteppe, Ralph Hepperle, Tim McDaniel, Joel Vitela Singleton Electric Company\n\nProject Name: Piscataway Bioenergy Project, Accokeek, MD\n\nArchitect/Engineer: Stantec\n\nGeneral Contractor: PC Construction\n\nThe project includes a cake receiving facility, CAMBI thermal hydrolysis process (THP), CHP facility, pre and post dewatering, (2) 1.5 million gallon anaerobic digestors, Control Building, Odor Control, gas upgrading system, gas storage and flare, sidestream treatment, and refurbished gravity thickeners. The Instrumentation portion of the project was extensive and complicated. The project had over 150,000′ of 3/4″ & 1″ conduit. Some imbeded, but mostly exposed aluminum rigid conduit. The project had over 1,000,000′ of #14 A.W.G., over 85,000′ of TSP, over 10,000′ of fiber optic cable, 10 PLC cabinets, over 70 local control panels, and over 500 instrumentation devices.\n\nBrian Cooper, Kenneth Higgins, Lewis Lloyd, Sothearak Nou, Janie Oliver, David Thompson JE Richards\n\nProject Name: Metropolitan Park – Tenant Improvements, Arlington, VA\n\nArchitect: Gensler\n\nEngineer: GHT Limited\n\nGeneral Contractor: Clark Construction Group\n\nAmazon Virginia Headquarters tenant installation consisted of work in 2 buildings, 2.1 million SF of office space on 43 floors simultaneously. There were over 4,500 fire alarm notification devices installed for the tenant space. There were 80 initiating devices installed throughout, covering area smoke for tenant room coverage, and AHU air coverage/shutdown. Most of the floors have exposed ceilings and were designed to have exposed MC throughout. The JER team stepped up to the challenge and installed over 90 miles of fire alarm MC runs in such a manner that it has been mistaken for conduit.\n\nBrian Brumby, Ernst Jean-Philippe II, Andres Lopez Campos, Cesar Guerrero, Malcolm Hunter, Wilfrido Morales Maldonado Valid Electric Company\n\nProject Name: Lifetime Fitness, Arlington, VA\n\nArchitect: RSP Architects\n\nGeneral Contractor: Turner Construction Company\n\nThe Pool/Spa installation consisting of Steam generators and Sauna heaters controlled via CPI panel to provide push button control and an elaborate pool equipment room housing UV filtration systems, heat exchangers, Chlorination equipment, and 8 pumps wired through VFDs controlled by individual EPO devices. The Fire Alarm system throughout the space was upgraded to a Voice Evacuation system wherein the primary FACP had to be upsized and replaced without interrupting the other tenant spaces within the building. The system included adding a new graphic annunciator, Sound/FX and Audio shutdown, and an ANSUL system for the kitchen hood.\n\nTelecommunications Systems and Facilities\n\nTheandre Currie, Russell Jones, Luigi Mesa, Marco Ochoa, David Rivera, Travis Weyant Vision Technologies\n\nProject Name: Metropolitan Park – Tenant Improvements, Arlington, VA\n\nArchitect: Gensler\n\nGeneral Contractor: Clark Construction Group\n\nVision Technologies was responsible for the low voltage, telecommunication scope and was integral to the building success as their scope spanned the entire project. Vision ran cabling to every camera, wireless/universal access point, and data drop. With such a large project, Vision broke their team up into project area and scope crews, and maintained these teams throughout the duration of the project. Communication and effective management was crucial as they sent weekly status reports for their telecom, sound masking, and DAS scopes for each building. Their reports noted work complete, forecast next week’s work, and called out any constructability issues.\n\nCeramic Tile & Terrazzo\n\nRainer Escobar, Jacinta Morales, Marcos Pérez, Eleazar Romero, Jose S. Sierra, Francisco Tapia Dominion Ceramic Tile, Inc.\n\nProject Name: The Virginian – Site Improvements & Interior Core and Common Area Upgrades, Fairfax, VA\n\nArchitects: Moseley Architects/Meyer Design\n\nGeneral Contractor: Wohlsen Construction Company\n\nThe difficulty of execution was high, with over 50 different tile specifications installed across the project. These tiles came from various manufacturers and required extensive floor leveling. Technical excellence is evident in the varying tile finishes in shape, size, color, and application. The coordination between adjoining trades and finishes was critical to installing and blending the interconnected finishes. The overall quality of craftsmanship is made evident by the complexity of the design, materials, and coordination required to bring these finishes together. The installations required expert cutting, fitting, and installation upon uniform setting beds.\n\nGuillermo Briones, Juan Carlos Pinto, Rosalia Pinto Lach Tile & Marble, Inc.\n\nProject Name: Lifetime Fitness, Arlington, VA\n\nArchitect: RSP Architects\n\nGeneral Contractor: Turner Construction Company\n\nDesign meetings were held to review aesthetics for install, grout joint alignments, symmetry throughout. A great deal of QC was implemented to ensure the buttering of the tiles, the overlaps were consistent, etc. The challenges in this space was schedule and change orders. Slabs in the basement were flat, and required floor sloping, and leveling to meet health department required slopes for ponding. The MEP overhead had a late start in the Basement as a result of on-going BIM, so finish trades were delayed to begin install in the basement which is floor to ceiling tile. The schedule was 7 days a week for this trade, and towards the end, double shifts to meet the Client’s date.\n\nDrywall\n\nBenjamin Alvarez, Wendel Lanuza, Erick Rodriguez, William Rodriguez JP Industries, LLC\n\nProject Name: M2 Ortho – Harborside Surgical Center, Forest Heights, MD\n\nArchitect: Boulder Associates\n\nGeneral Contractor: Forrester Construction\n\nArguably the most impressive aspects of JPs work will never be seen. This includes framing and drywall/cement board substrates used for wall tile and millwork, allowing finish trades to achieve high quality results. More importantly, the precision of JP’s wall/ceiling layout, framing, and finishing was critical to successful installation of the sensitive medical equipment. JP was responsible for many of the exposed finishes, such as wall/ceiling types including a custom wood cloud accent ceiling, full and partial height wall protection, unique angle corner guards and chair rail systems, acoustic draperies, accessory and misc. medical equipment installation, etc.\n\nGuery Belmonte, Mike Fleener, Roger Rocha, Mark Schneibolk, Paul Waters, Jill Schneibolk Wolfrey Form Construction Services\n\nProject Name: Confidential Client, Washington, DC\n\nArchitect: HOK\n\nEngineer: GHT Limited\n\nGeneral Contractor: rand* construction corporation\n\nLevel 4 bullet-resistant panel ordering and installation: over 500 lbs per 5’x5’ panel, hung using material hoist. Coordination + installation of ballistic door assemblies. 2-story Multifunction Room: scaffolding, fall protection, Level 2 bullet-resistant paneling, coordination with all trades and finishes. Madrid wood ceilings: lengthy lead-time for custom Steinway Cubes & grilles requiring multiple shop drawing revisions & extensive office coordination and field measurements. Madrid wood Steinway Cube ceiling: coordination with LT04 fixtures above. No ceiling hangers permitted within 4’x4’ light zone.\n\nVladimir Altamirano, Raul Alvarez, Pepe Calustro, Victor Mendoza, Jose Ortiz, David Ventura C.J. Coakley Company\n\nProject Name: National Museum of Women in the Arts, Washington, DC\n\nArchitect: Marshall Craft Associates\n\nGeneral Contractor: Grunley Construction Company\n\nC.J. Coakley’s scope included drywall and plaster; extensive wood blocking to support the artifacts; doors, frames, hardware; insulation and custom radiuses vaulted ceilings. GFRG reflector panels, insulation, firestopping, and an ACT ceiling that was designed with unconventional sizing were installed. The beauty in the completed work lies in the juxtaposition of the romantic Great Hall, the lavish plaster ornament, the contemporary exhibit spaces, and the functionality of the new office suites. Details on the existing walls were revitalized and brought back to their original beauty. Painstaking time was taken to patch and repair old plaster that needed restoration.\n\nDaniela Barahona, Arturo Gonzales, Richard Nicolari, John Pearson, Jason Spivey, Victor Veizaga Component Assembly Systems\n\nProject Name: Metropolitan Park – Center of Energy, Arlington, VA\n\nArchitect: NBBJ\n\nGeneral Contractor: Clark Construction Group\n\nComponent Assembly Systems provided all specialty ceilings for the common areas, training rooms, food concepts, and suites. Due to the intricate detail of the overall design, the scope included acoustical baffles, wood cloud ceilings, slat ceilings, and specialty drop ceilings, all with very intensive mechanical, electrical, and plumbing coordination and demanding alignment requirements. Component Assembly Systems also provided the event center’s acoustical panels and vertical wood baffles. Some of the more standard aspects of the scope included all drywall and framing for the Center of Energy common working spaces for Amazon team members.\n\nTodd Carlton, Clerence Hutchinson, Santana Perdomo, Sterling Riddle, Orlando Rivera, Kenny Silwick C.J. Coakley Company\n\nProject Name: JHU Bloomberg Center at 555 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, DC\n\nArchitect: SmithGroup\n\nGeneral Contractor: Clark Construction Group\n\nTo achieve a high-finish aesthetic and provide sound absorption, CJ Coakley installed plaster walls, wood and metal panel baffle ceilings, acoustic perforated wood ceiling panels, and perforated acoustical gypsum ceiling panels with a spray acoustic finish. To access the atrium slab edges and seventh-floor ceiling without impeding construction work below, CJ Coakley designed and installed multiple large-scale scaffold systems, including a moving cantilevered scaffold and a hanging dance floor scaffold. They also fabricated and installed acoustic wood ceiling panels which were required to match the acoustic wood wall panels installed by a different trade contractor. This accomplishment took significant coordination and sampling to achieve.\n\nFlooring\n\nOrlando Callejas, Eun Young Lee, Elenilson Lopez, Jackson Lynn, Sprigg Lynn, Stephen Pollehn Universal Floors Inc.\n\nProject Name: Chevron Wood Floor Historic Reproduction, Washington, DC\n\nArchitect: Citadel DCA\n\nGeneral Contractor: Meridien Group\n\nThis is the largest ornamental parquet wood floor in Washington, D.C. The massive historic reproduction chevron wood was reproduced to the original 1935 of the Mellon Auditorium exact appearance. Every angle and line is dead on. The curved border at the stage was hand made on site. The Chevron was hand cut on site. Universal Floors prepared the sub-floor to a level 5. We installed and sanded all 12,000 square feet. The finish is hard wax zero VOC oil varnished into the rift / quartered oak. This floor was delivered in full completion on time.\n\nStar Awards for Visual Excellence\n\nJackson Lynn, Sprigg S. Lynn, Stephen Pollehn Universal Floors Inc.\n\nProject Name: Bank of Alexandria Historic Restoration, Alexandria, VA\n\nArchitect: BarnesVanze Architects\n\nGeneral Contractor: Horizon Builders\n\n9,000 square feet of existing historic antique heart pine (circa 1806) was carefully removed & labeled. The historic pine was delivered to Universal Floors Inc. Washington DC restoration warehouse. Each and every board was carefully de-nailed, trimmed, repaired, passively sanded for installation. The boards were to match Gunston Hall home of George Mason. A perfect match was created for the architect’s approval. Some period antique boards were added as needed. Universal Floors emulated surface marks of time passed to marry the appearance of the site salvaged flooring. This extra touch helped marry antique replacement boards & stair case add to the original flooring.\n\nPainting & Wallcovering\n\nGreg Blick, Richardo Sanchez NLP Enterprises, Inc.\n\nProject Name: Museum Place, Washington, DC\n\nArchitect: Beyer Blinder Belle\n\nGeneral Contractor: Balfour Beatty\n\nThe project required constant coordination with the General Contractor and other trades for each portion of the work, including multiple passes through each of the units during, architectural finishes, drywall finishing, point-up, final painting and owner acceptance of units. It was imperative to maintain the coordinated durations to allow for the work to flow properly and this was discussed continuously with Balfour to stay on track. This allowed for the punch-out of the work to be minimized down to mostly small repairs that are traditional to this type of work.

The crew needed to learn special skills as to how to install stone blindly in the depths of the river, yet remain within the existing footprint of the wall. Clad in both wet suits and dry suits, the crews worked from barges in all months of the year to repair voids in the wall and reset stones, supplementing the walls with new stone to match the existing limestone. The new design of the walls features a much thicker cross section that what was originally installed, and much larger stones were required for the wall building.\n\nThermal & Moisture Protection\n\nChris Brown, Matt Higgins, David Imwold, Ryan Nagel Ruff Roofers, Inc.\n\nProject Name: Belmont-Paul National Monument Rehabilitation, Washington, DC\n\nArchitect: National Park Service\n\nGeneral Contractor: HPM, Inc.\n\nAs part of a larger rehabilitation project, Ruff Roofers, Inc. was contracted to replace the roof. The general scope was to remove the existing painted steel panel roof and install new standing seam copper. Ruff tapped Chris Brown as the Field Project Manager for the job, given his experience and skill with both historical and copper work. Chris has spent over 20 years working with sheet metal in the roofing industry, starting as a mechanic and working his way up to his current position with Ruff, where he has grown with the company for the past 14 years. Although he takes more of a managerial role with the company these days, he could not resist picking up his tools for a project of this historic nature.\n\nAnderson Acevedo, Inmer Espino, Edgar Hernandez, Rigo Martinez, Wilder Morales, Phen Pan Prospect Waterproofing Company\n\nProject Name: Udvar Hazy Center-Restore Exterior Envelope and Replace Roof, Chantilly, VA\n\nArchitect: AECOM/Hartman-Cox Architect JV\n\nBuilding Enclosure Consultant: Hoffmann Architects\n\nGeneral Contractor: Grunley Construction Company\n\nAt 115 feet tall and 1,000 feet long, the design of the hanger’s barrel roof made the work physically challenging for workers. Methods for access to the nearly vertical steep sloped roof sections included aerial lifts, system scaffold, and flexible rope positioning ladders as well as requiring workers to descend from the roof peak. Numerous temporary anchors were installed for fall protection. Materials and equipment were stocked daily as nothing could be left on the roof or scaffold overnight. Components of the reinforced liquid-applied membrane roof system were highly temperature sensitive on both the hot and cold extremes."
