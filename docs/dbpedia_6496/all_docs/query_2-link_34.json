NOTICE The Editorial Board wishes to render this Annual Bibliography as complete as possible, especially with regard to publications appearing in Indb. Authors are particularly requested to supply the Kern Institute with copies of any articles dealing with Indian archeology and allied subjects so that they may be duly noted in further issues of the Bibliography. FOREWORD. Since the appearance of Volume VII of this Bibliography, in June 1934, some important changes have taken place in the Editorial Board. In the Foreword to that volume we have already had occasion to note that, owing to Dr. FAbri's departure to India, his connexion with the editing of the Annual Bibliography of Indian Arihaology has been severed. Here we wish again to record our great indebtedness to Dr. FA MI for the amount of labour devoted by him to the editorial work for a number of years. Whatever success the Bibliography has achieved U in no small measure due to his indefatigable industry. Mr. Naoshiro Fukcsiiima, Professor of Sanskrit in the Imperial University of Tokyo, who for the last two years had rendered us valuable assistance in the capacity of an honorary editor, has now acceded to our wish and accepted a place in the Editorial Board. It has been with some difficulty that we have |>ersuadcd him to assume a position more in agreement with the great significance of his collaboration by which we arc enabled to include all important Japanese publications in this bibliography. In his letter of a6th August 1934 Professor FtnOStmiA declared his willingness to join our Editorial Board 'in the name of the international cooperation between scholars’; we welcome his consent given on this account all the more gladly. With no less satisfaction do we welcome Dr. Bimala Chum Law of Calcutta as a new member of our Editorial Board. It is fit that the country* which occupies the most important and, indeed, the central place in our Bibliography should be represented among its Editors. Dr. Law has not only distinguished himself especially in the domain of Buddhist studies (with which Indian archaeology is so closely associated), but he moreover enjoys a well merited reputation as a generous patron of antiquarian research. In both these capacities he has undertaken to further the interests of this annua) publication and it is mainly due to his vigorous support that we are able to bring out the present volume essentially on the same lines as had been followed in pre- vious issues. Dr. A. J. Bkrmet Kkmfers, whose name appears now for the first time among the Editors, is not indeed new to the work, as several years back he voluntarily rendered us valuable help in the editorial work. Certain measures of economy, sug- gested by him and put into practice in the present volume, have resulted in a con- siderable saving of space without, however, affecting the essential elements. The measures adopted find sufficient justification in the serious decrease in income, suffered VI by the Kern Institute of late years which, however natural it may be in the prevailing economic conditions, was none the less alarming and called for immediate redress. As stated in the Foreword to the Annual Bibliography for Ikr year /gjl (p. V), the Government of Netherlands India had been obliged to reduce their annual grant towards this publication from jooo to 1000 guilders. Whosoever is but slightly acquainted with the distressing financial situation by which the said Government is faced will not marvel that a further reduction from 1000 to 500 guilders has now appeared to be unavoidable. We have, indeed, every reason to be thankful that the grant-in-aid which hitherto has been our main stay has not been withdrawn altogether. The is not all. The drastic reduction of our chief subsidy was attended by a gradual fall in members and supporters. Last but not least, the fall of the Pound which was closely followed by that of the Rupee, added to our embarassment. As a result, the Bibliography is now supplied to our Indian members at a price (via. the annual fee of membership) below the cost of production. And this term should be understood as applying merely to the printing charges, the laborious editorial work being left out of account. It would be a natural and certainly not unreasonable expedient to raise the annual fee of six Rupees which has been fixed for members in India. It is however clear that such a measure might quite well have a contrary effect from that in view. Besides, it is our wish to keep the Bibliography within reach of that honourable but often indigent class of Pandits who from ancient times have regarded the essence of the (aitrat as their principal wealth. In this dilemma w« have ventured to appeal for aid and support to those Rulers of the autonomous States of India who enjoy the reputation of generous patrons of indigenous art and antiquarian research. It seemed by no means unreasonable to hope that they might be found willing to favour an enterprise calculated to promote the noble cause of Indian archxology. The result of our firat steps in this direction has not belied our expectations. The Government of H. E. H. the Nizam of Hyderabad-Deccan, the premier ruling chief of India, was the first to sanction an annual grant of Rs. 200.— for the period of five years. Their Highnesses, the Maharajas of Travancore and of Cochin have likewise lent their generous support and it is hoped that others among the enlight- ened rulers of the more progressive States will listen to our appeal. It is gratifying that the Government of Ceylon, too. have evidenced their appreciation of the Biblio- graphy by sanctioning a grant-in aid of Rs. 250.— In this connexion we wish also gratefully to record a gift received from His Highness the Maharaja Gaekwar of Baroda for the furtherance of the work of the Kern Institute in general in addition to a very liberal donation for the preservation and publication of the ancient manuscripts of Bali 1 . Another most welcome gift was received by us from H. H. Sir Kaiser SiiuM SHDt Jung Bahadur Rana. K. B. E.. Commanding General of Nepal. The gracious 1 Since -riling the above, we ban: bom informed ibal Ha hue, moreover, sanctioned a subsidy towards ihe puttkatioo of the present volume. VII letter, dated the 8th January 1935, in which he communicated to us his readiness to render his support to the editing of the Annual Bibliography, conveyed at the same time the important news that Sir Kaiser Shumsher has assumed the position of Director General of Archeology for Nepal and in that capacity has undertaken explorations on the ancient site of the Lumbinivana, the birth-place of the Buddha. It is a matter ot no small gratification that the archaeological interests of a country par- ticularly rich in ancient remains have now been entrusted to such able hands. We wish Sir Kaiser Shumsher every success in his great undertaking. Notwithstanding the imposing array of combined auxiliary forces which have come to the rescue and which undoubtedly bode a substantial improvement in the financial position of the Bibliography, we have deemed it prudent to adopt certain measures, alluded to above, which, while tending to reduce the bulk of the present volume, have not, we believe, resulted in any material loss. Some of the measures adopted, such as the employment of certain abbreviations, will indeed hardly be noticed even by those who have had occasion to handle the volumes previously published. Some, such as the omission of academic and honorific titles in connexion with the names of authors, will perhaps be regretted, but this measure having been carried through systematically, the regret need not be embittered by envy. An alteration of some greater import relates to archeological and historical journals which in the preceding issues used to be enu- merated under the letter A (Periodicals) in the different sections of the bibliography to which they belong, the full contents of each journal being added in each case. In the present volume the titles and contents of periodicals have been noticed in the bibliography proper only in exceptional cases, vis., when the various articles contained in a journal are not separately dealt with or when a particular issue of a journal has been made the subject of a review. The list of abbreviations, however, which was a constant feature of previous volumes has not only been retained, but has now been extended to a complete list of the periodicals with which we are concerned'. Those persons who are in the habit of consulting our Bibliography will be best able to judge whether this new arrangement is likely to cause any inconvenience. If such proved to be the case, it would be an inducement for reverting to the old arrangement. We trust, however, that such a retrograde movement will not be called for and that, on the contrary, the bibliography will be found to have gained in practical utility. The modified method now adopted may easily lead to a misunderstanding with regard to the exhaustiveness of the present issue as compared with its predecessors. It will be seen that it comprises 706 entries, whereas volume VII, which appeared a year ago, contains 75J items. These figures, however, include respectively 16 and 67 titles of periodicals so that the number of books and articles dealt with, has not fallen but has on the contrary slightly encreased. 1 Each title is followed by a reference to those numbers various articles comprised in the journal in question. of the bibliography »h.ch deal with the vm The introductory portion of the present volume is, we believe, more represent- ative than has been the case with previous issues. A novel feature is the general article on exploratory work in India daring the year under review. We arc greatly indebted to the scholars of different nationality who have contributed the various articles constituting the Introduction. Some amongst them like Sir Richard Burn, Mr, G. Yazdaxi, Mr. S. Paranavitaxa and Dr. F. D. K. Boscn we may regard as our regular collaborators. The names of others are now met with for the first time in the Introduction, though not perhaps in the bibliography proper; their co-operation is all the more welcome. They are M. Henri Marchal, directeur du service archco* logique dc l lndo-Chine, Mr. H. E. STAnnoN, I. E. S. (ret.), F. A. S. B., late Director of Public Instruction in Bengal, and Dr. W. D. van Wijxgaarden, Conservator of the Museum of Antiquities, Leyden. The able article devoted by the last-named scholar to Dr. Ernst HrRzrr.i.D's startling discoveries at Pcrsepolis is illustrated by two excellent photographs which we owe to the courtesy of the discoverer himself. We wish here to thank Dr. Hkrzku.d for his kindness in placing them at our disposal. The photographs here published in connexion with the contributions of Mr. Paraxavitana, Mr. Stapleton and Mr. Yazdani have been supplied by these authors themselves. The same is the case with the very fine photographs belonging to the concluding paper by Dr. F. D. K. Bosch, Director of Archxology in Netherlands India. Those relating to Kashmir we owe to the kindness of Mr. Kak, formerly Director of Archxology in that State. The photographic prints which M. George Canto, Director of the French School of Hanoi, allowed us to publish along with M. Marchal's article have been supplemented by a few particu- larly fine views which we received from the Musce Guimet through the kind inter- mediary of the Countess G. de Coral REmusat. Of the text-illustrations the sketch-map of Bengal has been prepared by Major J. J. Muldxr, late of the Survey Department of Netherlands India. For the next one we are indebted to the friendship of Licut.-Colonel Th. van E»», R. E. (ret.). Figures 3—4 we owe to the Director of the tUoU Frantaiu if Ex trim* Orient-, whilst, last but not least, the attractive little sketch of the ancient mosque of Cheribon in Java is a good specimen of the draughtsmanship of Mr. Th. P. Galbtin. This time the task of collecting and arranging the very extensive bibliographical materials was entrusted to Dr. Hermann Goetz and Dr. A. J. Bernrt K km reus. They have discharged it in a manner which will command satisfaction. Dr. B. C. Law, the new member of the Board of Editors, has now assumed the responsibility for books and articles written in the Indian vernaculars. Professor N. Fukusmma, our Japanese collaborator and his able assistant. Mr. Otoya Tanaka, have again favoured us with their valuable assistance with regard to archxological publications brought out in their cour.tr>-. In the editorial work we have received welcome help from Mrs. D. Kukxex-W ickstked, Frau Dr. Hermann GotTZ. M. Jean Buiiot, Mr. J.S. Furnivaix. I.C.S., late Commissioner of Settlements and Land Records. Burma, and Mr. VV. IX H. Nicholes, formerly Chief Engineer, P. W. D., Madras. We wish here to record our gratitude for this help as well as for all other as s istance by which the work has benefited. We should not conclude this Foreword without mentioning the publishers Messrs. E. J. Brill, Ltd., Leyden, as well as Messrs. L. van Leer & Co., the well-known lithographers and collotype-printers of Amsterdam. We record with satisfaction that Mr. Th. Folkers, the newly appointed Manager of the firm first-mentioned, has evinced no less interest and readiness to help with reference to this annual publication than we were accustomed to experience from his predecessor, the late Mr. C. Pel- tf.nbvrg, whose courteous personality will remain in our grateful memory. J. Pit. Vogel.

It is fit that in the present volume appertaining to the year 1933 some lines of reverential remembrance should be consecrated to the memory of the great scholar after whom the Kern Institute has been named After having taken his Doctor's degree in 1855 at the University of Leyden on a thesis relating to the Achxmenian inscriptions, he very soon started work on VarAhamihira's Rrthaliamkila, of which he published an edition and an English translation. About the same time he translated Kalidasa’s fiakumlata into his mother- tongue. In the spring of 1863 he was appointed * Anglo-Sanskrit Professor* in Queen’s College at Benares Kulm always retained pleasant memories of his contact with the representatives of indigenous scholarship. His stay in India, however, lasted only little more than a year. In 1865 he returned to his native country where he had been called to occupy the newly founded chair of Sanskrit and comparative philology in the Leyden University. He thus became the first Sanskrit Professor in Holland and may be rightly considered as the founder of .Sanskrit studies in that country. Until the year 1903, when he reached the age of seventy, he occupied the Leyden chair and numerous young scholars benefited by his teaching. It is not our object here to relate in detail the story of his life, which was entirely spent in the service of scholarship and was free from striking events. Nor do wc wish to survey the numerous works relating to so many fields of research which he has given to the learned world in the course of his life. After he had passed away on the 4'* July of the year 1917 at the age of eighty-four, several obituaries have appeared containing a full account of his life and work. The range of his studies was indeed incredibly wide and incredibly great was the number of languages with which he was familiar and which he could employ with ease both in conversation and correspondence. Kern was above all a Master of languages. He not only commanded the whole range of Indo-European languages both ancient and modern, but had also made an extensive study of the Indonesian tongues to which he applied the same methods of philological research as were practised with reference to the first-mentioned group. Especially in the domain of Old- Javanese philology Kern was one of the great pioneers. * The portrait reproduced u the front»ps«ce in ihe present rolame is the same which sppesred in the Memorial Volume presented to Ksaw 00 the occasion of his 70* birthday. Aoaul biLliogiaphy, VIII. I Linguistic study, however, did not exclusively occupy his attention. On the one hand, it led him on to the investigation of religions, particularly Buddhism. His History of Buddhism . written in the Dutch language but translated into French and German, appeared in 18*2-4 and is still considered a standard work. He also contributed a Manual of Buddhism (1896) to the well-known 'Encyclopedia of Indo- Aryan Research’. He edited AryaiQra’s JatakamaU (Harvard Oriental Series, vol. I, 1891) and the Saddharmapundartka (191s). the latter in collaboration with the Japanese sanskritist Bunyiu Nanjio. K rax was one of the foremost Pali scholars; we will only mention his valuable additions to R. C. Child***' Dictionary of tht Pali Language. On the other hand. Kras's intimate knowledge of Sanskrit and Pali brought him into contact with Indian epigraphy which under the inspiration of James Pkikskp, had just commenced its marvellous career. Kras devoted hi* great learning and sagacity in the first place to the most difficult department of that field of study, namely, the investigation of the Edicts of A 4 oka. Although hit conclusions have not always stood the test of further inquiry, his interpretation of those difficult documents possesses a |to*itive value and he is rightly reckoned among the foremost of the older generation of Asokan scholars. The study of the epigraphy of IndO'China was initiated by Krax. This fact is generously acknowledged by that select body of French scholars who have distinguished themselves in the decipherment and interpretation of the numerous cpigraphical records of Champa and Kambodia. One of them, M. Louis Fixot, calls him •l'initiateur dc lepigraphie cambodgicnne et le temoin attentif et cordial des travaux qui continwrent les .mens * With regard to the ancient inscriptions of the Malay Archipelago, too, Kkkn'h activity has been of primary importance. A considerable number of the Sanskrit records have been edited by him and it is astonishing that, notwithstanding the often defective character of the facsimiles which had been placed at his disposal, his readings have generally been accepted by subsequent, better equipped cpigraphists. It was no doubt his profound knowledge of San*krit which enabled him to arrive at conclusions of lasting value. Among those who have known Kras personally there is certainly none who will not bear a vivid recollection not only of his imposing scholarship but also of his unfailing kindness, his unaffected simplicity and his readiness to help and advise his fellow-workers and pupils. IRAN EXCAVATIONS AT PERSEPOL1S There is hardly any ancient site which in grandeur and beauty can be compared with the ruins of Persepolis, one of the early capitals of the Persian Empire. Already in the 1 7'* and 1 S' h centuries these remains drew the attention of European travellers, 3 such as Pietro della Valle, Cornells de Broth and Carsten Niebuhr who visited the spot in the years 1621, 1705 and 1765 respectively and have left detailed descriptions. 1 As regards the archaeological research carried out on the site of Persepolis from the middle of the i9 ,h century, special praise is due to the explorers DlEULAFOY, Df. Morgan, Sarre and HER2TELD who by their publications made the art of ancient Persia generally known. Excavations on strictly scientific lines, however, did not take place until the year 1931. when a systematic excavation of the site was commenced under the supervision of Dr. Ernst Herzffld. Field Director of the University of Chicago Oriental Institute Expedition to Persia. Particularly during the working season of 1933 discoveries of outstanding interest were made. The ruins of Persepolis are situated at a distance of some 50 kilometres from the town of Shiraz and stand on a terrace projecting from the fool of the mountain range which dominates the extensive plains of Mervdasht. The town was founded by Darius I, who is rightly regarded as one of the most prominent rulers of the Ancient Orient and as the real originator of the Achxmenian Empire. Under him and his successors Persepolis became a capital of the Persian Empire, but owing to the position of the town being somewhat too remote to serve the interests of their world-wide Imperial policy, these monarch* occupied it only at intervals. Nothing is yet known of the city which by in the plain in front of the terrace. The palaces of the Achit- menid kings which stood on the top of the terrace and have been partly preserved, arc the most representative monuments of ancient Persian architecture. The preserved portion consists of those parts of the palatial edifices which were constructed of stone, via. the flights of stairs, portals and pillars. In the construction of these buildings, in contradistinction with the Assyrian palaces, stone was largely used. It is true that sun-dried bricks, too. were very extensively employed as well as timber i but walls, roofs, in fact all that was built of these more perishable materials, has now completely vanished. As regards the Persepolitan palaces, we distinguish residential edifices and audience- halls (a/Wuna). The nucleus of these pabccs is the large hall covered with a fiat roof supported on pillars and provided with a front-hall and a lateral chamber on each side. The ground-plan is invariably square. Each of the palaces has been built on its own platform. An imposing double flight of steps leads up to the top of the terrace and to each palace separately. The terrace which is now strewn with blocks of marble carries the following buildings: a portal of Xerxes, the entrances of which were flanked by colossal statues of bulls, such as are well-known from Assyrian art; a large hall of audience, provided with thirty-six pillars which measure 19 metres in height; and the famous hall of a hundred columns, built by Darius, measuring 72 metres square, and provided with slender and richly decorated pillars which are uj 1 A description of the ruim with a eery fine pUw after a drawing probably made 00 the spot by- Philip AKOSL is found in the diary of Joan Cooaee. Ambassador of the Dutch East India Company to Penia in 1651— •*, which wa* composed by Cornelia Sraurax and edited by A. Hon in 1908 (p. 107—19). This description has been inserted by Francois Vaixxtij* in his big work Oud tn Xunt Oeit-Mif*. 4 metres in height The last-mentioned edifice, which recalls an Egyptian hypostyle hall, is regarded as the finest masterpiece of Persian palatial architecture. In this city of palaces Dr. Ernst Humii) has conducted excavations on behalf of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago. Magnificent works of art were found under the dibris of the palace buildings. When the grand monumental stair- ways leading up to the terrace and to the palaces had been laid bare, it was found that the walls of these stairways as wdl as those of the palace buildings themselves were adorned with magnificent sculptured reliefs. On these reliefs the person of the Great King, either Darius or Xerxes, is repeatedly pictured in the performance of ceremonial and symbolical actions, such as the granting of audience and the acceptance of the tribute of subject nations, on which occasions the King is represented either walking or seated on his throne and usually attended by satellites. Here wc see the grandees of the realm, the stately procession of courtiers and the train of royal body- guards in Persian attire, armed with lances, bows and quivers, and also the envoys from the different provinces of the Empire carrying their presents and advancing in a festal procession. The various groups are separated by conventional cyprcsvtrrcs. The ambassadors, recognisable by their peculiar dress and arms, are ushered in alter- nately by a Persian and a Median chamberlain on the occasion of the Noruz or New Year’s festival (at\" March) in order to present their gifts consisting of chariots, horses, camels, bulls, lions and, besides animals, other products of their country, such as garments, costly vases and so forth. They are arranged in three rows, one above the other i each group representing a nation or province is shown separately. These embas- sies clearly demonstrate the enormous extent of the Persian Empire whose vast terri- tories extended from Farghana in the north cast to Abyssinia in the south-west, and from the Balkans in the north west to Sind in the south-east. These reliefs exhibit the several nations constituting the Empire, as well as their costumes and weapons. The great exactness in the rendering of all the details is of special value for our knowledge of the peoples represented. They show us *gift-bearcrs from Kush and l’unt, Arachosians (Southern Afghanistan) bringing vessels and a camel, Sardians bringing a humped bull, shields and lances; Bactrians (Northern Afghanistan) bringing gold vessels and a camel, an Indian tribute-bearer from one of the three Indian satrapies of the Persian Empire, carrying two baskets of gold vessels on a flexible yoke; Susians (from Khuiistan), with a lioness and her cubs, and weapons (bows and long daggers, of which latter a golden specimen from the Oxus treasure is in the British Museum), Armenians with a stallion and an amphora; Scythian tribute- bearers from Farghana (in Russian Turkestan) bringing a horse, bracelets and garments; Syrian tribute- bearers with gold vessels, bracelets and a pair of horses; Cilician tribute- bearers with rains’ Although these figures are not accompanied with explanatory inscriptions, the groups 1 Tkt lUuitraUd Undn Nan of *5 March and 1 April 1953, ■Jiich has been quoted, may be consulted for further particulars. 5 of tribute-bearers can be identified with the aid of analogous representations found on other monuments. Thus the Scythian tribute-bearers are 'remarkable for their peculiar pointed and conical caps* which they likewise wear on certain Greek monu- ments such as the Francois Vase By the courtesy of Dr. HnzrEU) wc arc enabled to reproduce two groups here (Plate I), one of Indians and the other of Scythians or &akas, as they are called in Sanskrit literature. In a letter dated the 21“ December 1934 the explorer comments as follows on the two groups in question. He points out 'that the Saka of the tribute procession of Xerxes, although they are absolutely identical with the Saka Tigrakbauda, are not those, but are the Saka I'aradraya of Southern Russia, somewhere near the Cimmerian Bosporus |Crimca|. Of the three Indian satrapies, only the Hindui (Sind) arc represented. The animal is meant to be a wild ass, the man in front carries a flexible stick over his shoulder, not a scale. The very first figure to the right is the Persian usher, who holds by the hand the chief of the mission*. The Ach*menian relief bear testimony to an astonishing power of expression. They exhibit a remarkable freedom of style: the figures have been rendered in real profile, the faces show a great variety of expression, the animals are disting uislied by a vividness of motion, contrasting with the austere attitude of the human beings. Indication* of scenery are totally absent as well as anything suggestive of a back- ground. No vestige is found of those lively hunting and battle scene* selected by the Assyrian king* to decorate the walls of their royal dwellings. The same stereotyped subjects are repeated over and over again, but this monotony has a deeper meaning and is intended to emphasize the supreme power of the king of kings. For it is no series of historical events which these reliefs are meant to portray; they visualize the splendour of the royal court as indeed Acha-mcman sculptural art throughout serves to glorify the king. Among the reliefs there are several which represent a lion attacking a bull (a subject rightly designated as the 'arms* of Acluemcnian Persia), and some which show the king in the act of slaying a fabulous unicorn. Both these motifs, which are derived from Babylonian art. recur several times on the walls of the monu- mental staircase. They symbolize at the same time the power of the king and, in accordance with the Zoroastrian creed, the victory of the good over the evil principle. Persian art is not a popular but a courtly art in the strict sense; it was the creation of a royal dynasty. On that account its monuments are confined to the kingly capitals, while it flourished at the same time as the Empire under Darius and Xerxes (550—330 B. C.). It disappears with the downfall of the house of Ach*menes. This Achzrmenian art being the youngest of the Ancient Orient, is often regarded as a daughter of that of Babylon and Assyria Undoubtedly there exist numerous close relations between the two But it has also been influenced by other regions of the Near East and especially by Egypt, so that it can be better termed a late mani- festation. in fact, the last fruit of the art of the Ancient Orient. 1 L. Moon, Sty! hunt anJ Greeks. Cambridge. 1913. p. 54, fig. 8. 6 When the Persians had conquered the whole of the Near East, they adopted various artistic ideas from the subject nations. What they saw in Syria and Egypt took their fancy. Thus Persian art under the Ach*menids developed a character of its own. It combined the results of Near Eastern artistic ideals into a brilliant unity in which the national element is not wanting. It betrays connexions with Hittite, Babylonian, Assyrian and Egyptian art. although the independent development of analogous features is by no means excluded. But whatever Persian art has borrowed, it has combined with indigenous elements, so as to produce an entirely independent style. Eor that reason it must be considered as an autonomous art imparting visible expression to the unlimited power of the Acharmenian kings '. What lends a peculiar charm to the ruins of Persepolis is the absence of any additions of a later period. Persepolis existed for no more than two centuries. It was annihilated in the conflagration kindled in 330 B. C. by Alexander the Great who with his own hand flung a flaming torch into the royal palace. The story of the conflagration which has been handed down to us only by the lighter classical authors (Plutarch and Arrian), is confirmed by the recent excavations which have revealed masses of charcoal mixed with the dibris. By his action Alexander wished to emphasise symbolically that the Ach*meman Empire had ceased to exist. Aduemenian art came to an end together with the Empire. After the destruction of the palace buildings, the adjoining residential town seems soon to have been deserted. The palace-walls built of sun-dried bricks gradually crumbled down. The dtbrit covered the whole terrace with a thick layer of loam which during twenty-three centuries concealed, and at the same time guarded, the priceless sculp- tures. so that they could now be laid bare in an excellent state of preservation. Of the eight edifices only a few stone gateways and pillars remained standing to show the sj*ot where Alexander the Great once celebrated his triumph. Yet the ruins of Persepolis are still imposing by those monumental remains by reason of the pillars, gateways and grand staircases which make the whole terrace one of the wonders of the Ancient World. W. D. VAN WtJNUAARDKN. INDIA ARCH/EOLOGICAL RESEARCHES IN INDIA DURING THE YEAR l93*-33*- No excavations were carried out at Mohenjo-daro owing to the retirement of Dr. E. J. H. Mackay, whilst at Harappa little work was done. We understand that Dr. Mackay is bringing out a book on •Further Excavations at Mohenjo-daro’. As regards the mysterious Indus Valley script, we may draw attention to a paper on •Seals of ancient-lndian style found at Ur* published by Mr. C. J. Gann in the Pro- I F*. Same, Du Kmmit /et <tM P/riua, Berlin, 191a, p. S— 15. » The proent article hat been nuinly drawn from a note communicated to the principal Indian news- japm ( 7 *r SUInmta of 5 Nov. 1934. TV of 8 Nov. 1934, etc.) by Rai Bahadur I>aya Ram SaHNI, Director-General of Archxology. 7 cccdings of the British Academy, vol. XVIII. Mr. G. de Hkvesv's startling discovery that the script of the Indus Valley shows certain analogies to that found on wooden tablets in the Easter Island has evoked considerable interest. The explorations conducted by Sir John Marshall on the site of Taxila have brought to light another Buddhist monastery which exceeds in size all edifices of its class known in the North-West. The locality where it was found is called KalawOn. The site yielded a copper plate inscribed in Kharoshjhi characters. In this inscription the monastery from the ruins of which it was exhumed is indicated by the name of Chhadaiila. The document, which is dated in the year 1 34. has been edited by Professor Sten Konow It is of considerable importance as it supplies a reliable basis for the dating of the Gandhara sculptures which were discovered along with it. An event of importance was the opening of the Curzon Museum of Archeology at Mathura by Sir Malcolm Hailey, Governor of the United Provinces, on the a s' k January 1933. In the course of his speech H. E. gave the history of the Mathura Museum. It was Mr. F. S. Growsi who started the collection of sculptures and inscriptions which he himself had excavated during his collectorship of the District. It was housed in a very omate building which had originally been intended for a rest- house of Indian gentlemen of rank. The subsequent growth of the collection was mainly due to the infatigable labours of the late Kai Bahadur Pt. Radii* Krishna. Among the numerous important pieces which he recovered we need only mention the Yaksha of Parkham, the N'Aga of thhargaon. the statues of Kanishka and other princes of the Kushaga dynasty and the two sacrificial posts of IsApur. From 1911 Pt. Radica Krishna was in charge of the Museum as Honorary Curator. The old museum soon proved too small to contain the ever growing number of sculptures. In 1919 the local Government deckled to provide a suitable building to house the col- lection, it was completed in 1939 at a cost of Rs. 1.60.000. Moreover a grant of Rs. 10.000 was sanctioned to cover the expense of the removal of the exhibits to the new building. They were arranged under the personal supervision of Rai Bahadur Rama Prasad Ciianda. It was on the special wish of Pt. Radha Krishna lhal the new Museum was named after Lord Cuuon who during his Viccroyalty has done so much to promote archxological research in India. The foundation of a local archxological Society at Allahabad is another event which deserves to be mentioned. Excavations on the site of Kosam. the ancient Kausambl, arc contemplated. The Archxological Department of Gwalior under the direction of Mr. M. B. Garde carried out some remarkable excavations at Gyaraspur, a village 23 miles to the north-east of Bhiba, which yielded the remains of a huge Vaishnava temple of the io' h century A. D., some beautiful images and carvings and three fragments of a large Sanskrit inscription — a firaiasii — connected with the construction of a temple. • JR AS , i 9 j», p. 9,9-6$ <ff I A .

Pla«'- The recovered portion of the epigraph mentions the names of three kings of a hitherto unknown royal dynasty, namely, Sivagana, Chamundaraja and Mahendrapala. On the famous Buddhist site of N'alanda in Southern Bihar the excavations carried on during a number of years were continued. Hitherto eight monastic buildings, a large s tafia and other religious edifices had been discovered. Now a ninth monastery has been brought to light. In the course of its excavation as many as seventy-five images of metal and stone representing Buddhist and Brahmanical deities were recovered. It may now be considered as definitely sealed that the bronze statuettes belonging to the monastery which the Sailendra king Balaputra had founded at Nalanda were not imported from Java but must have been manufactured by local craftsmen Among the minor antiquities found at N'alanda there were some 3000 objects of burnt or unburnt clay, including miniature models of (haityas, as well as seals and sealings'. Several of the latter are inscribed ; the inscription usually reads : Sn-Nalanda-mahavi- ManyaryaiMktkuiamgkasya , 'Of the Community of the Venerable Friars (residing) at the Great Monastery of Srl-NilandA*. Incidentally these monastic sealings are of interest for the identification of other Buddhist sites, like that of Kasia, where similar discoveries have been made. They prove that these inscribed objects were not imported from elsewhere and therefore record the name of the convent in the ruins of which they were found. In the course of excavations at Rajgir, the andent Rajagriha, conducted in 1905 — 6 by Sir John Marshall and Dr. Theodor Bloch a curious brick structure, called Maijiyar Math, raised on a circular plan and decorated with remarkable terra cotta figures of Nagas and other divinities, had been discovered, the exact nature of which it wan impossible then to establish. Fresh explorations have now made it clear that this enig- matical structure consists of two buildings raised the one upon the other, the lower one being a circular &aiva shrine and the upper one a Buddhist sluf>a of the 8' fc or 9 ,h century A. D. A fragment of a stone sculpture which came to light in this excavation contains the name of the mountain Yipula, one of the five hills by which the ancient royal city of Rajagriha was surrounded. On account of its being engirdled by mountains the town was also known by the name of Girivraja. The excavation of the great temple of Pah&rpur in the Rajshahi district of Bengal has now been brought to completion '. At a small distance to the east of the temple the recent explorations have brought to light a shrine dedicated to the Buddhist goddess Tara. For further explorations carried out in Bengal by various archaeologists, we may refer to the special article which Mr. H. E. Stamj-Tok has contributed to the present volume. Here we wish only to record the discovery of an exquisitely carved Vishnu image of colossal size which was found at Itahar in the Dinajpur district. It has been deposited in the Indian Museum at Calcutta. ' The qJMUoo ha, b«n fully discus*! by A. J.

In the month of March 1933 a discover) of great interest was made by Mr. T. G. Aravamuda Iyengar of the Madras Museum at Satyamangalam, a village 7 miles west of the famous Fort of Gingee. It consists of a large number of stone sculptures repre- senting Vishnu, Rudra, Silrya and other deities of the Brahmanical l’antheon. These images, which are reported to be well preserved and of excellent workmanship, are ascribed by the discoverer to the time between 700 and 850 A.D. They exhibit a transition from the late Pallava to the early Chola period. The collection has been removed to the Government Museum at Madras. In the field of Moslim archaeology a find of importance was made at Old-Delhi by Khan Bahadur Maulwi Zafar Hasan. On the site of Jahanpanah, one of the six cities which preceded the capital founded by the Great Mogul Shah Jahan, he laid bare the remains of an extensive building which is believed to be the palace of Mubammad-bin-Tughlaq ( 1 — 51). the second ruler of the Tugblaq dynasty. A large hall, measuring 300 by 210 feet, which must have been supported on 300 wooden pillars is believed to be identical with the Qafr i haiar-Sutun or ‘Thousand-pillared Hall’ described by lbn Ba«u|a. For a number of years extensive works of repair and restoration have been car- ried out in the Lahore Fort under the superintendence of Mr. J. F. Blakiston. In the next issue of the Bibliography we hope to publish an account of this interesting work. Two more events of a personal character we wish briefly to commemorate. On the a6' h November 193a was Sir Aurcl Strim's seventieth birth day. Few arch.xolo- gists can look back on such an amount of epoch-making exploratory work published in the most perfect form, as Sir Aurel Smut has produced. But it will be hard indeed to point to any other explorer who at the age of seventy still carries on his work in the field under conditions which would deter a man of half that number of year*. While offering the veteran archeologist our congratulations, we wish to thank him for the warm interest which he has shown on many occasions in the Kern Institute and its work. We do not wish to conclude this survey without mentioning the death of Mr. Henry Cocsam which occurred at Tunbridge- Wells, Kent, on 5“ November 1933. Mr. Cousens joined the Archeological Survey of Western India in 1861 as a drafts- man and an assistant to Dr. James Burgess. From 1891 till his retirement in 1910 he was Superintendent of the Western or Bombay Circle. In that capacity he rendered excellent services in the listing, preservation and survey of the numberless monuments in his charge and, besides contributing valuable papers to the Annual Reports of the Archeological Survey, produced a considerable number of well-illustrated volumes on the architectural remains of Bijapur, Gujarat, Ka^iiiwar and Sind. Mr. Cousens was a conscientious and reliable worker and a first-class draftsman and photographer. He made a complete photographic survey of the sculptures of S2nchi ; we understand that the publication of these beautiful photographs is shortly to be expected. Mr. Cousens died at the age of nearly eighty years. J. Pm. Vogel. Asiua) bibliography, VIII. a IO INDIAN NUMISMATICS IN 1933 a. EARLY INDIAN COINS In vol. XIX of the Journal of the Bihar and Orissa Restarch Society Mr. K. P. Javaswal undertakes to fill the blank in the history of Northern India between the Kushans and the Guptas, drawing his evidence from the PurSijas, the play called Kaumudimakotsava, the poem named Bkataiataka, inscriptions and coins. He asserts that the Kushans were defeated by the Bhlraiivas about 180 A. D., and that about 344 A. D. the Bharaiivas and Vakatakas were amalgamated in the person of Rudra- scna I whose father was a Vlkifaka while his mother was a Bhiraiiva. The Vskatakas are know from copper-plate inscriptions chiefly found in Berir or the Bombay Presi- dency, with one or two bare mentions of their name in Baghelkhand, and three inscriptions at Ajaijii. The BharaAivas arc specifically mentioned only in the genealogy on the Vakataka plates, where Rudrasena 1 is shown to be the grand son of Bhava Naga who is described as a Bharatiya. In attempting to fit the Pauranic accounts to this reading of history Mr. Javaswal begins with the lists of the Naga dynasties, and equates some of thetn with the names on the coins found at Mathura His identification* are not very convincing, as he has to place Jsesha-data of the coins before Rama-data, while the true order is probably the reverse. Moreover Siiu-chandradata whose coin was published by Professor Ramon' must be much later than 10 B. C. — 35 A D., the date he assign* to the Naga-king Situ nandi. Some of the Mathura coins he describes as struck by the later Naga rulers, who are referred to but not named in the Purlnas, arc pro- bably earlier than those of Rama data, and one of them w-as struck by a Satrap (Siva- data) not by a Rijl. Lastly, while the coins were certainly struck by rulers in the Doflb, the Puraoas describe the Xagas as rulers of Vidita. Mr. Javaswal takes the word ‘Nava’ (Nikas or Nlgas) in the well-known pas- sage describing the rulers of Champavati and Mathura as a name instead of the number nine, and describes Navanlga as the first of the BharaAiva rulers. He identi- fies him as the striker of a well-known series of coins found chiefly at Kosambl the inscription on which has been variously read as .Vaasa, Detasa or as part of a name •navaia. Nava-nSga is said to have ruled first at Padmavati about 140 A. D. and then at Kantit ' on the Ganges, and to have conquered the Kushans. He was followed about 170 A. D. by Virasena whose coins are found at Mathura and in the DoSb from Bulandshahr to Cawnpore. Mr. Javaswal also assigns to Virasena two coins* obtained by Cinninomam near Narwar and read by him as Kha- which Mr. Javaswal 1 Cunningham.

This attribution cannot be supported on any ground. He thinks that the Bharaiivas then divided into three branches and assigns to one (at I'admavati) the rest of the coins published by Cuxnixgham (/. r.), and to another, ruling from Kantit, a series of coins which V. A. Smith 1 described as uncertain. Until more of these coins are discovered and it is known where the)- are found, it is purely specu- lative to assign them to Kantit. The third branch at MathurA is said never to have struck coins. Accepting a suggestion by V. A. Smith (/. t. p. 19J, 197, n. a) that there were two rulers called Vtrasena. Mr. Javaswal professes to read the name on the second scries as Pravarasrna, and also a date 76. It seems probable that Sami was mistaken in dividing the series, as the coins are rather crudely struck and many are worn. And it is certain that Mr Jayaswal’* reading is incorrect. He has taken as Pra-, the first syllable of the name he reads, a portion of a nandipada which comes below ‘Vlrasena’, and the marks he reads as 76 are portions of another nandipada on the right of the coin. The wheel mark which he notes on the coin, and which he identities with a similar mark on a pillar bearing the word Vakatanam , is merely the base of the same symbol. Mr. Jayaswal also reads on coins the name of two other VakApika rulers known from their plates The coins are of the Kau«mU series. One of them is an early cast coin, which bears no inscription, but Mr Jayaswal has taken part of a nandipada as the name Rudra, and turns a 1 vailika into the symbol for too. He thus assigns a coin which is |>robably of the y* century B. C. to Rudrasena I whom he places in 348 A. I). The name on the other coin, read by Smith as Pazataia (1 i.e . of Pirvata) he reads as Ppthvl sena. Smith’s reading is confirmed by a coin in the British Museum. Lastly Mr. Jayaswal refers to the Gupta coin*. He adds to their issues a coin of the Paftchala scries, reading Chandragnpiatpt. where Cunximgham preferred Rudra guptasa. The British Museum specimens clearly confirm the latter reading both as regards the initial syllable and the Prakrit form of the genitive. This coin is probably 500 years earlier than the date assigned in the paper. Mr. Javaswal’s deductions from the title used on the tiger type of Samudragupta's coinage are also unsound. k. INDO-SCYTHIAN AND KUSHAN Mr. N. G. Maji'mdar presents in the Ankerolagua! Survey of India Report for 1928 — 9 (p. 169, pi. LXIV) a fresh study of the coins of Spalirises. Ares and Arilises in which he supports V. A. Smith’s views that there were two kings named Ares, and that Arilises ruled between their reigns. His most important fresh material is the valuable suggestion that the form of the Kharosluhl dental sa changed at this period, which he appears to prove. It is of course quite possible that the change began in one portion of the dominions of Azes which, as pointed out by Whitehead, who takes the opposite view, were extensive V Indian Muirum Ca/aUgut. p. *05. • CtieUgur Punjab Muuum, 1 , p. 93. A very interesting gold coin acquired by the British Museum shows Wema Kadphiscs riding on an elephant and thus marks the conquest of Indian territory while three coins found in northern and eastern Bengal illustrate the later stages of KushSn coinage ’. t. GUPTAS In the Indian Historical Quarterly for 1933 Professor D. C. Ganguli makes the acute suggestion (p. 784) that the name read by Allan 1 doubtfully as Chandragupta ( 111 ) should be Vainyagupta, and the coins were then struck by the ruler whose copper-plate was published in Ind. Hist. Quart., 1930, p. 45. The reading has been accepted by Allan *, and it is curious that it was not suggested earlier from the engraving of no. MU, pi. XLVII in Marsoen's tfumismata Oritntalia. It is possible that Vainyagupta should be identified with Vajra named by Yuan Chwang as the son ot Baladitya since Vena of which Vainya is a patronymic, was a name of Indra, and the vajra was Indra s symbol. d. MEDIEVAL Mr. L. P. Panmya describes in Ini. Hist.

Ind., IX, p. 17a). No coins of this line have been published before, but as one side is blank the piece may have been struck as a seal or medal. /.

Bakua in the Journal of the Assam Research Society. 1933 (p. 33) on the coinage of Assam gives an interesting summary of the information derived from the coin legends about the religious tenets of the rulers. He suggests that the so-called Gahori Mohur, bearing the representation of a boar, which was much prized in Assam as a lucky amulet was a coin of the ancient KAmarupa kings who traced descent from the Variha incarnation. No specimen of this gold coin seems to be known, but a silver one in the Assam cabinet is described * ' Bril. Mat. Quarterly, VIII, p. JJ. 1 JASB. 19JJ, p. ttj. * Brit, xtm r. Cat.

RECENT ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE OF THE EARLY AND MEDIEVAL HISTORY OF BENGAL In Bengal the year was noteworthy for the publication in the Journal of the Aiiatic Sotitly of Rental of a series of papers* dealing with fresh work that has considerably extended our knowledge of the early and medieval history of North-Eastern India. The first five of these were contributed to a Symposium on Northern Bengal History, held at the Society's rooms in the first week of 1933; while the remaining two, by S. K. Sabaswati, embodied the results of two subsequent tours that were undertaken with the object of completing the previous surveys. Until recent years the earliest known fact in the history of Northern Bengal was that this area was included in the Gupta Empire* between 43s and 543 A. D. \\ but the papers now under consideration carry the political connection of Bengal with the rest of India backwards by more than 600 years In the first place, Mr. MaZUMDA*’i note on Rushan Coins indicates that, in the time of Vasudeva (185— jao A.D.), Northern Bengal also probably formed part of the Kushin dominions. In 19*8-9, however, a terra cotta plaque (showing an archer shooting deer from a four-horsed chariot) had been found at Mahisthln in the course of systematic excavations by the Archaeological Department, while in 193* Prof. S. K. Cmatterji also discovered at Bokhara (the ancient Pushkaranl). in the Bankura district of Western Bengal, a plaque of a standing Yakshini.

BhaNDarkar at the Symposium, is the finding, during the course of the Archeological Department’s 1 93 1 -2 season of work at Mahasthan, of a fragmentary inscription in the Brahml alphabet of the Aiokan rock and pillar edicts, recording the issue of an order to the local Mahamatra (officer) stationed at Pundranagara that, with a view to the relief of distress (caused either by flood or famine), he should (i) make advances in gatidaka coins and (a) distribute paddy from the district granary on which the inscription was placed. This not only settles the identity of Mahisthan with the historical Pundravardhana, but also indicates that Northern Bengal was probably included in the Nlauryan Empire. The inscription further shows, if Dr. Bhaxdarkar b correct in his reading and expla- nation of the name of the people who were to be assisted, viz. the Samvamglyas, or ‘Allied (tribes called) VaAglyas', that the name V**£* for Bengal was probably in use even in the time of Afoka (say 350 B. C.) The remaining four papers embody the results of enquiries that have been carried out by the writer, with various helpers, during the last few years in the M&ldah and Dinfljpur districts of Northern Bengal, particularly with a view to settling the vexed question as to the site of Ekdali, the stronghold before which the Bengal Kings, Ilyas Shah and hb son, Sikandar Shah, were able successfully to withstand two attacks of the Delhi Emperor.

Evidence has been gathered to prove the correctness of WltTMACOTfa suggestion (made as long ago as 1874) that it should be identified with the place of that name in DinSjpur. The city apparently included an area of upwards of 35 square miles, enclosed within a broad moat formed by linking up the Chiramatl and BAliyA rivers, and a memory of the battle between Ilyas and FirOx may be preserved in the name of the village Ranthail (‘Battle Field') which is situated in the great plain stretching to the south of the old city, about 4 miles to the south-west of the spot where the Baliya leaves the southern moat. A careful survey of the site and the surrounding country (which is scattered with mounds indicative of ancient settlements) resulted in the discovery of numerous images, some of which may date from at least the earliest Pala times (late 8* and 9' h cent. A. D.). This shows that Ekdali was originally a Hindu city the name of which was probably Bairhitia. Among these images, the following merit the special attention ol archaeologists: 1. Dantur.i — a form of Chamunda, (Plate IIu). A sandstone image found at Kafashan, a village lying a short dbtance to the north-east of the embanked area east of the Baliyi. Date possibly as early as the 8* century. 2. Vishnu, in sandstone, (Plate Hr). From Kakadighi, a mile to the N.W. of Qajbah, the citadel of Ekdali. As it b similar to the specimen of the same image Efi. /nJ., XXI, p. Sj— 91, with pUte. i6 found at Bodh Gaya that was dedicated in the 26* year of DharmapAla it probably dates from about 800 A. D. 3. A miniature Vishnu Trivikrama of the 9“ century — now in the Varendra Research Society Museum, RijshShi — came from Adyakhaij^a, on the ChirSmati. This hamlet (which lies immediately west of the Ekdila Maut£) may possibly, as suggested by its name, have been the original nucleus of the former Hindu city. 4. Tenth century sandstone image of Siva and Parvati (Plate II d) from Srlrlmpur, about to miles north-cast of Qa}bah (and 1 mile W. of Karanji — cf. later). 5. Eleventh century image of Rishabhanatha, the first of the twenty-four Jain Tlrthankaras\\ from Surohar, just across the ChirSmati river to the west of the old city. This is an epitome in stone of the Jain hierarchy, as the main image is sur- rounded by minatures of the twenty-three other Tlrtkankaras. 6. Seated Surya (Plate Ilr) from Q*»bah. If «his can be correctly assigned to the first half of the 13* century, it indicates how alight was the hold over Western Bengal of the Moslem rulers who succeeded Muhammad bin Bakbtiytr Khiljl, seeing that Devlkot — the headquarters of the latter Chief — by only 15 miles to the east of this particular yajbah. 7. Vishnu Trivikrama from Karanji. with an inscription Palirayam Jhakkurak. dating from the latter part of the 13* century and hence again subsequent to the first Moslem Conquest. The last-named inscription is of particular interest in connection with a further object of enquiry in this part of Bengal, vis. the means by which the Hindu Raja GariM was able to oust the reigning Moslem dynasty about 1415 A. D. and to rule over Bengal for 3 years under the somewhat too provocative title of Danuja Marddana ('Destroyer of the Demons'). Evidence is adduced to show that Raja Gari&i's home- village may have been Karanji, and that — if not a Koch himself — he probably utilised the Kochs of Northern Bengal to establish himself temporarily as sole ruler of Bengal. The leading race of Kochs is now known as Poliyas. and if the inscription was intended, more correctly, to read PaUrayam f 'kakkurah (the 'God of the Palis' — the image having been dedicated either by. or for, the l*al»), the existence of a strong Poliya clement in the locality may be inferred as far back as the 13“ century. The remaining historical problem that it was attempted to solve was the site of the battle in which Sikandar Shah, the builder of the great Adlna Mosque at Pindua, was slain about 1395 A. D., while opposing the advance of his rebellious son Ghiyiy- ud-din Azam. The probable site of the battle is shown to have been the village of Raniganj or Ranigarh, which lies on the Tangan River at the junction of three ancient roads. The first of these ran east towards Ghoraghat : and hence may have been the road along which Ghiyaj-ud-din advanced from his headquarters in Eastern Bengal. The second was the road from North-western India (through old Maldah): while the third ran north-west, first to Pandua and the Adina Mosque, and thence to Northern • A.R.

Both at Pandua and Ramganj. Hindu remains occur, dating, in one case, from the 9' h , and, in the other, the 10* century, and a fine specimen of the broad and well-cambered brick-on-cdge road by which the two places were connected was discovered just inside the eastern ramparts of Pandua. near a break in the wall, which probably marks the site of the Eastern Gate of the old city. H. E. Stan-KTOn. NOTE ON THE PROGRESS MADE BY H. E. H. THE NIZAM S ARCHAEOLOGICAL DEPARTMENT DURING THE YEAR 1933-34. A. D. *. SURVEY OF MONUMENTS Several new monuments of considerable arehxological and historical importance urre surveyed during the year in the Raichur. Bidar, Gulbarga. OsmanAbAd, Aurangabad, Nalgonda and AirAf-i-Baldah Districts. The most important of these is a vikara at Ghafotkatch which was concealed from view by the accumulation of (U&ris and has now been noticed and cleaned for the first time. It is separate from the two viharat at Ghatotkatch described in Fncttmc and Bimuus' Cm Templet of India (p. 346-7). Another important monument surveyed for the first time is the fort at Taltam, mentioned in the A'mi-Atiari and the Attar A 'a mat in connection with the conquest of Khandcsh and Ahmadnagar by Akbar. The fort is situated in the Indhiyari range between Ajanta and Kanhar. From an architectural point of view it is like the other hill forts of the Deccan; but it has inscriptions which throw light on contemporary history. Another important building studied systematically for the first time is the temple at GhanpUr, situated about 8 miles north east of Ramappa in the midst of thick jungle, which has now been cleared. The temple has a close resemblance to the well-known Saivite temple at Ramappa. being star-shaped in plan. It also has figure-brackets of polished black stone which show much imagination and skill in their carving. A full description of these monuments will appear in the Annual Report of the Department for 1933—34 A. D. which is under compilation. h. CONSERVATION A total sum of Rs. 04, 961—6—6 was spent during the year on the preservation of archzological monuments in the Dominions. The campaign of conservation work carried out at Aurangabad. Ajanta. Ellora and Bidar, which mostly engaged the attention of the Department, deserves special mention. At Aurangabad the two groups of Buddhist caves have been thoroughly cleaned and conserved, and made easily accessible by the construction of a motorable road from the Bcgampura Gate of Aurangabad to the foot of the hill in which the caves are situated. A bridle-path has Au.u.1 BiWiograph,. VUL i i3 also been cut along the brow of the hill for the convenience of visitors to go from one group of caves to the other without descending into the valley and climbing up the cliff again as they had to do before. At Ellora the frescoes in the ceding of the KailSsa and the Indra SabhS have been cleaned and preserved scientifically and there is no danger of their perishing for at least a couple of centuries to come. As they throw important light on the history of Indian painting after the disappearance of the Buddhist religion, a complete set of the copies is being prepared. It would seem that the societies of painters attached to different monasteries were persecuted at the time of the revival of the Brahmanical religion, so that artistic skill and tradition were completely lost with the waning of Buddhism in India. The frescoes at Ellora are nearly a century posterior in date to those of Ajanta; but the difference is so great that one fears to class them with the latter from consideration of points of technique and artistic feeling. The photographs of a few copies of these frescoes are reproduced in Plate III. At Ellora, for the facility of visitors, the road in front of the cave* has been widened at aeveral points and parking places laid out for cars. Inside the Daulatibid Fort almost all the prominent monuments have been con- served and much has been done in the clearance of jungle and the construction of foot-paths leading to various monuments. In the Aurangabad city itself the Department during the year under report has taken in hand the special repair* to the Naukhanda Palace. This was originally con- structed by Malik Ambar; but 'Alam All Khan, the Governor of Aurangabad under Aurungxeb, is reported to have made some additions to the edifice. His Highness Ajif Jah Ni*am-ul-Mulk made further addition* to the building and it was his favourite residence after his assuming independence. There is a carpet in the building which is shown to the public every year on the ‘Id festival when the Subahdar of the division receives *a:rs from the official* and the general public of Aurangabad as a token of their homage to the king. The building has some spacious halls which are now being repaired according to an estimate amounting to Rs. 37, too for the complete conservation of the building and the gardens. Of this sum Rs. 7, 500 have been spent during the year on repairs to this monument. At Ajanta the cleaning and conservation of the frescoes were continued during the year and the paintings on the walls of caves IX, X, XII, XVI, XVII and XIX have been preserved scientifically. In cave IX a fresco was noticed, concealed under dirt, which shows a dagaba with an enclosure and a gateway similar to those of the Sanchi Tope. In this painting votaries arc shown bringing offerings towards the dugaba. The head-gears and the dresses of these votaries are similar to those noticed on the southern gateway of the Great Tope at Sanchi. The painting from the point of technique seems to be of the second century A. D., and it is interesting to note that at this time the design and the detail of the Sanchi Tope held the imagination of artists in different parts of India. In Bidar the excavations of the Takht Maball have disclosed some halls decorated 19 with beautiful tile-work. The tiles are of different patterns and designs ; some are square in form, while others are of different shapes joined together like mosaic-work. The designs represent chiefly floral, geometrical and calligraphic devices. Some tiles are hand-painted and some have real gold work, which was also apparently done by hand. In the volume on Bidar, which is under compilation, a chapter is devoted to the technique of these tiles. At Bidar two other monuments of the Baihmani period have been conserved during the year. They are the Solah Khambh Mosque and the Madrasa Mabmfid Gawan. The former is a spacious building, rather severe in style, while the Madrasa has a close resemblance to similar buildings of Khurasan and Persia and must have been designed by a Persian architect. It is interesting to note that at Bidar the influence of Persian art and culture is very prominent; even the Persian royal emblem — the rising sun and the lion — is worked out in tiles as an ornamental motif in the spandrels of some buildings. c. EXCAVATION During the year under review Government have sanctioned a sum of Ks. 5000 to conduct excavations in the old fort at Warangal and at a site in the Nalgonda District on the northern bank of the Krishna river facing the remains of NAgarjuni- konija. The operations will commence in the next cold weather and the Department expect* to discover some interesting records at both these places. d EPIGRAPHY In the domain of Hindu inscriptions a comprehensive survey of the Telugu records has been made and all inscriptions in that language have been copied and arc now being edited in the form of a monograph by Dr. P. Smhivasachak of Madras, who a few years ago obtained the Ph. D. degree of the London University for his researches in the political history and the inscriptions of the Klkatlya dynasty. The monograph is likely to be published early next year (1935). Two other monographs have been compiled on the Canarese inscriptions of Kopbal. KukkanQr and KallQr and Mr. C. R. Krbhkamacmablc. Superintendent for Epigraphy of the Archiological Survey of India, is editing them for the Hyderabad Arthtrological Series During the year a thorough survey was also made of the Moslem inscriptions of ShfthpQr, SAgar and Gogi in the Gulbarga District, a detailed article on which has been contributed to the Epigraphia Ind^Stvslemica. The majority of these inscriptions are in Persian and belong to the 'Adil Shshl dynasty of Bljapur. One inscription, however, which was erroneously attributed to MabmOd Shah Baihmani belongs to Muhammad Tughlaq. The inscriptions of the 'Adil Shahi dynasty throw interesting light on the genealogy and the date of assuming independence by these kings. G.

ANCIENT MONUMENTS OF KASHMIR * We congratulate the India Society on the attractive volume, published under its auspices, in which Mr. R. C. Kas, formerly Director of Archeology in the Jammu- Kashmir State, has described the ancient monuments of his native country. It is provided with a Foreword by Sir Francis Youkhcsbakd, the President of the India Society, and with an Introduction by Professor A. Focam. The book, as explained by the author in his Foreword, ‘has been planned to suit the convenience and the requirements of the visitor who, without desiring any great erudition, takes an intelligent interest in the subject of Archeology\". Although Mr. Kak’s volume is intended therefore to be a guidebook for the benefit of the intelligent tourist, it is a scholarly production supplying the most reliable and up-to-date information regarding the numerous ancient temples and other sacred edifices for which Kashmir is famous no less than for the beauty of its scenery. The author appears to be acquainted with all that has been written on the subject of his book by previous writers; he must moreover be familiar with the monuments by personal inspection. The book is written in an agreeable and vivid style and show* a perfect command of the English language. In an introductory chapter dealing with the country and its people and with the sources of Kashmir history the author enumerates the Greek, Chinese, Arab, Indian and Kashmiri writings containing more or less detailed accounts of the history and geography of Kashmir. Among the indigenous sources Kalhana's famous chronicle, the Rdjalaraiigini, takes the first place. This remarkable historical work, unique in Sanskrit literature, was continued by jonarija, Sri vara and others, so that wc possess a consecutive history* of Kashmir from Aioka to Akhar. At the end of this chapter Francois Bernier is mentioned as the earliest European writer who has visited and described the Happy Valley or Me Paradis terrestre dcs Indes\", as he calls it. There exists however an earlier account of Kashmir in the Rtmomtlranlit of the Netherlander Francisco Pelsaert The next chapter supplies a very useful survey of the [.olilical history of Kashmir, in which special attention is paid to the early kings, like the renowned Lalitaditya, by whom were raised the magnificent temples dedicated to the great gods of the Hindu Pantheon. The last Hindu ruler was the Queen Kota Devi (1337 — 38). It was Sikandar (A D. 1390—1414), who was responsible for the wholesale destruction of those splendid monuments of Indian architecture and who thereby earned the name of But-shikan, 1. t. the Iconoclast. Among the Moslem rulers of Kashmir his son Zain- ul-abidln (A.D. 1421 — 1472) is distinguished by his just and tolerant rule. Up to the present time his beneficent reign is hdd in grateful memory.

But unlike the enlightened monarch of Hindustan, the king of Kashmir ended his days in bitter disappointment. ‘There arc few more pathetic figures in the annals of India than this solitary old man refusing to be consoled for a life of earnest endeavour, splendid achievement, and irremediable failure* (p. 39). Chapter 111 gives a succinct but clear description of the architectural styles repre- sented by the ancient buildings of the valley. It is well known that the Hindu tem- ples of Kashmir exhibit a distinct style in which various elements have been most happily combined. What strikes the visitor most is the classical aspect of the Kash- mirian temples. This is accounted for by the close affinity with the early art of Gan- dhftra. On the other hand, there are several elements which are purely Indian. Among these I would reckon the stepped pyramidal roof built up in two storeys as described by the author (p. 67). There can be little doubt that this type of stepped roof is an imitation in stone of the wooden hill-temples which still exist in the valleys of die Himalayas and are perhaps best known from Nepal. In connexion with the purpose for which the book has been written, the ancient monuments have been arranged not in a chronological but in a topographical order. The result is that the Muhammadan buildings, most numerous in the capital, arc pro- minent in Chapter IV entitled ‘Monuments in Srinagar and its Vicinity*, whereas the description of the Brahmanicial temples occupies most of the chapters V and VI in which the monuments above and below Srinagar are dealt with. From an archxological point of view the most valuable portions of Mr. Kak’s book are no doubt those relating to the Buddhist remains of the Valley which, apart from prehistoric relics like the megaliths of Yandrahom (p. 111, pi. XLIII), are at the same time the earliest. Although it was well known that Buddhism was once preva- lent in Kashmir — a fact expressly stated by Kalhana (I. 171, 177) and moreover abundantly testified by Buddhist scriptures — . hardly any monument of this religion had come to light during the nineteenth century. The explorations carried on during the last twenty years have revealed a considerable number in which the three main classes of Buddhist buildings — stupas . monasteries and temples — are well represented. First of all, there arc the remains of Ushkar not far from Baramula at the lower end of the Valley. It is the site of Hushkapura, one of the three towns which, according to Kalhana, were founded by the three Turushka kings Hushka, Jushka and Kanishka '. A ruined and overgrown stupa near this place was one of the very few monuments of Buddhism known to exist in Kashmir in the days of Coxmmgham and Cole’. Mr. Kak follows Stein in identifying it with the structure which, as stated in the Raja • tarangini (IV 188), was built by LafitSdhya in the middle of the eighth century. The ' Rajas. 1, 16A — 70. • A photograph of it has been reproduced in Cole* /BrnsSraiimt tj Ancient BmUiagi in A'ajAmir (1869). site, however, has yielded relies of a much earlier date. rc. eleven terra-cotta heads and other remains of images which unmistakably betray the influence of the Gr*co- Buddhist school of Gandhira They are well described by the author (p. 153), who assigns them to the third or fourth century. Another medieval stupa b found at the village of Malangpura, halfway between Avantipur and Payar. All that remains of it b the square basement with a double projection and a large staircase on each of the four sides The most remarkable feature of this Buddhist monument b the decoration of sculptured reliefs on the outer surface of the walls by which the stairs are enclosed. The author gives a graphic description of these reliefs representing \"a furious monster pursuing a man who is flying precipi tally before it*. There can be little doubt that the subject of these sculp- tures is a variation of the matara motif in which we find the aquatic monster combined with a little man who seems to be in danger of being swallowed This motif, first found in the art of Mathura, has spread as far east as the Island of Sumatra. It b well known that the makara b often used in the decoration of staircases. The archeologist will read with special delight the account of the excavations carried out by Mr. Kaic on the Buddhist site of Hlrwan (p. 105 — 11). The village, situated about 1 j miles to the north west of the famous Shalimir Garden near Srinagar, retains in a strongly modified form the ancient name of Shajarhadvana, the \"Grove of the Six Saints*, by which the locality b mentioned in the Rajatarattgini (I, 173). Even in the days of Kalhana it was remembered that this spot had once been hallowed by the presence of the great teacher Nigirjuna The excavations on this site which, as far as we know, are here for the first time described in some detail and with suitable illustrations \\ have revealed the exis- tence of walls built in the ‘diaper-rubble’ style well known from Gandhiira and Taxila. They also yielded a medium sized stupa, under the foundations of which a copper coin of Toramina. the Hun king of the fifth century, was discovered. A building of an earlier date and of greater antiquarian interest b the large apsidal temple occu- pying the highest terrace. The explorations of the last twenty years have made it abundantly clear that temples of this early type (apart from the enigmatical 'Tank building' of Mohenjo-daro, we may even regard it as the earliest type known in India) once must have existed all over the country. Sir John Marshall has discovered them both at Taxila and at Sanchi; Mr. LoNcmmst excavated several specimens at Nagaijunikonda on the banks of the Kistna river, whereas others had previously been found by Mr. Rea at Ramatlrthan and Sanluram in the Vlzagapatam dbtrict*. Two complete examples of this early temple architecture are still known to exist in the South : the one at Ter, the ancient ' Cf RAA, 1 9 JO, p. 140 f. — In 190J, -hen miMig Kashmir, I hid a photegraph of one of the relief* liken.

IV* Tagara, on the western boundaries of Hyderabad- Deccan and the other at Chcrarla in the Guntur district of Madras. The well-known rock-cut ehaitya-haXh, of Western India are, of course, cave-temples of exactly the same type. The peculiar 'apsidal' shape of these shrines is to be accounted for from the object of worship, the early ikaitya or stupa raised on a circular plan, which they were intended to enshrine. Hence the Prakrit name iluttyagkara (Sanskrit t haityagriha ) by which temples of this kind are designated in inscriptions. The term eiailya applies to the enshrined stupa and the use of the word with reference to the whole temple, not uncommonly met with in the works of archaeologists, is therefore to be discarded. The explorations of Harwan have now for the first time, I believe, revealed the existence of such an early temple in Kashmir. The wonderful tiled pavement of the courtyard (160 by 124) feet) which surrounds the apsidal temple adds not a little to its interest. The tiles which are numbered with Kharoshfhl numerals, show a great variety of curious designs which are well illustrated on plates XIX— X LI. They include the motif of the garland-carriers well known from the art of Gandh&ra. Fig. 1. - TOn Iren Hlmn, Kufcmir. Among Urahmanical monuments of Kashmir the author pays special attention to the two temples which King Avantivarman (855 — 883) raised on the left bank of the Vitastfl near the village Avantipur which up to the present day retains the name of the royal founder. These two temples are not so famous as the earlier sanctuary which the great Lalitaditya dedicated to the solar deity at Martand and which even in its sadly ruined condition is impressive by its picturesque appearance and imposing situation. The two temples which Avantivarman dedicated tu Vishriu and Siva under the names of Avantisvamin and Avan&vara have likewise been destroyed by the iconoclast. But the careful excavations carried out in 1913 — 14 by Mr. D. R. Sahni, while in charge of the ancient monuments of Kashmir, have added a great deal to our knowledge of these two religious edifices. The thoroughly scientific manner in which Mr. Sahhi has published the account of his explorations leaves nothing to be desired. There are, however, a few icono- graphical explanations in which we venture to differ from his conclusions and which it *4 will perhaps be useful here to record. The two reliefs found on the front faces of the dies of the pedestal which flank the staircase leading up to the sanctum (Plate IV) arc interpreted both by Mr. Sued and by Mr. K.oc as representations of the god Vishnu accompanied by Lakshmi and another goddess It seems to me much more probable that the two groups are meant for Kamadeva seated between his wives Rati and Prlti, not only on account of the amorous attitude of the central personage, but also on account of his attributes. He carries not only a bow but also an arrow ending in a flower which he holds with one of his right hands in front of his body. The parrots, too, appertain to Kama. The two inner panels, facing each other, of the same staircase are particularly interesting (Plate IVd). They show each a group of persons among whom a male personage is most prominent by his large size in relation to the other figures. On one of the two relief*, that on the left, this central figure is bearded and wears a crown. His right hand is raised as in reverential salutation and his left seems to hold a water-vessel In the corresponding panel to the right the central personage, likewise a male but here distinguished by a moustache and a curious head-dress, is shown in the same attitude. In the left-hand panel the protagonist is followed by a female of medium size. Mr. Kak observes that she wears a scarf over her head in the same fashion as is still observed by the women of Kashmir. In the right-hand panel there is also a medium-sized figure standing behind the principal person, but here this satel- lite appears to be a male. The remaining figures of both groups, which are consider- ably smaller in size, seem partly to carry offerings or to express reverence by their attitude. ‘The whole group'. Mr. Kak remarks, ‘seems to breathe a spirit of profound devotion to some undefined object*. Mr. Saiini tentatively identified the bearded person with Brahma and the principal person of the other group with Krishna For these identifications there appears to be little foundation. Mr. Kak. in my opinion, is nearer the truth when he recognizes the donor in the bearded personage. But in that case the central person of the opposite group must also belong to the mortals. The attitude of both these jiersons with their right hand raised, a gesture associated in Pallava sculpture with human adorers, points to this conclusion. A more definite interpretation of the two figures must be necessarily hypothetical. It should however be borne in mind that the temple of Vishnu to which these sculptures belong was founded by Avantivarman previous to his accession*. I feel therefore inclined to recognize the founder Avantivarman in the man with the moustache, whereas the crowned person with the beard would be his predecessor UtpalapJda. It would be interesting if the two figures in reality represented the first ruler of the Utpala dynasty and the last scion of the house of Karkota. But until further evidence is forthcoming, the proposed identification should be considered as purely conjectural. 1 A. R. Arch.

A series of seventy-seven excellent plates is an indispensable adjunct for the right understanding of the text. The fine volume produced by Mr. Kak is well calculated to draw anew the attention of artists and scholars all over the world to the wealth of antiquarian monuments which the Valley of Kashmir contains. May it also serve to render the local authorities fully alive to the great responsibilities which the possession of such a treasure-house of art and history involves. J. Ph. Vogel CEYLON CONSERVATION OF THE ROYAL BATH AT POLONNARUVA Among the most striking of the remains at the ancient capitals of Ceylon are the stone baths, called pokun* (Pali pokkkaratti, Sanskrit puihkarint) in Sinhalese. At Anuradhapura and Po|onnaruva as well as at the less well-known sites in the island, there exist numerous examples of these pekunas. varying in sire, in design and in artistic beauty. We have pukuttMt of a very simple pattern, being nothing more than small rectangular excavations with sides built of brick or rubble, large baths of elaborate design ornamented with stone work of excellent quality, and others of such artistic designs as the stone-built Lotus Bath at Polonnaruva which, as the name implies, resembles a full-blown lotus of eight petals. All these baths were, in ancient days, supplied with water from the neighbouring reservoirs by means of under ground pipes and there were similar passages for draining off the water when necessary. It is needless to mention that these underground passages are now all blocked up, so that at present the ancient pokunat, in which the rain-water stagnates, have become prolific breeding places of the malarial mosquito. The great majority of them, like most of the architectural remains at Anuradhapura and Polonnaruva, once belonged to the various monastic establishments. Of secular baths, very few examples remain; and among them the most important is the one now known as Kumara Pokuna (‘the Prince s Bath*), near the ruins of the palace of ParakramabShu I at Polonnaruva (Plate V). It is situated just outside the eastern enclosure of the Citadel, which was set apart entirely for royal buildings; but a flight of stone steps leading to it through a postern gate in the wall from the outer precincLs of the palace shows that it was within the area reserved for royalty. By a study of the topographical data given in the Afakacamsa, where the palace of ParakramabShu I is described, Mr. A. M. Hocart has been able to identify the Kumira Pokuga with the Silapokkharani ('Stone Bath’) mentioned in the Chronicle'. • To this •Bibliography- might be added Stew's Zmr GtttkukU 4 rr Qihis tarn JObn/, contributed to the Fu/grmu an Rudolf van Rath, Stuttgart. 1893 (Cf.

Bell in 1911, the pokuna was in a very dilapidated condition. The silent but steady action of tropical jungle growth during six centuries of desolation, and the ravages of man had done their work, and the stone slabs with which its sides had been faced were found displaced and scattered about. Some of the stones were missing and others broken into fragments. It remained in this condition (see Plate Va) till 1931, when the Archeological Department, in consideration of the association of this pokuna with the greatest name in the history of the island, and its intrinsic merit from the architectural point of view, derided to restore it. It was in such a ruinous condition that it was impossible to conserve it except by completely dismantling and re-building it. Detailed plans of restoration were made, in which the position of every slab and fragment of stone was accurately marked, and photographs showing the actual position of the stones in the various parts of the structure were taken before the dismantling was done. In re building, every possible precaution was taken to replace each slab of stone in the exact position which it originally occupied. The old builders had given a backing of brick and mud mortar to the stone work of the sides, and in reconstruction a reinforced concrete backing was given into which the vertical slabs were fixed by hidden steel cramps. The flag-stooes of the pavement, which had sunk in many places, were also re set. In the course of the work, it was found that, as in almost all the monumenU at I'ojonnaruva, the material used for this structure was not specially prepared for the purpose, but had been collected from various earlier buildings. In consequence, a few of the stone slabs are rather ill-fitting and the mouldings in the same tier also differ in style at places. All these defects must, of course, have originally been concealed by a coating of lime plaster, traces of which were found on some of the stones. In spite of these blemishes, the effect of the finished pokuna is on the whole very pleasing and impressive. The various parts of it balance each other very well, and the proportions are quite harmonious. It was also found that since its first construction, it had undergone repair at a subsequent date. The flight of steps leading down on the western side, and the greater part of the pavement can easily be distinguished as later additions In order to give the reader a general idea of this stone bath, 1 cannot do better than quote Mr. Bell’s succinct description included in his Report for the year 1911-12, p. 56: ‘The pokuna is shaped as a bayed oblong, 44 feet east to west by 38 feet crossways, giving a recessed outline all round, and diminishing in like plan to 31 feet 6 inches by 27 feet 3 inches at bottom by three graduated gangways. The floor is stone-flagged, and in each of its terraces is a low ledge, ogee-moulded, except on the west, down which side the only stairs descended. The mantling of the gangway’s differed. The lowest tier was given small ogee plinth, vertical block, and cyma coping; the second and third gangways dispensed with plinth; and the uppermost in addition to its coping, was topped by a parapet of double-cyma moulding, inside and out, rounded at top’. After the restoration of the pokuna itself had been completed, the surrounding area was excavated ; this work resulted in exposing the underground passages by which it was supplied with water and emptied. Between the pokuna and the Citadel Wall was a channel, with sides built of rubble masonry-, 1 1 feet 3 inches wide, from which water was conveyed to the bath through four underground pipes. Two of these, which were connected with the two MuAird-shaped spouts on the western side, were built entirely of stone. The other two conduits have stone slabs only on the floor, the side walls and the top being of brickwork, which has now crumbled away. The spouts on the other three sides, which were also similar in design to those already mentioned, have been damaged and most of the fragments have disap|»eared. The water was drained off through a stone-built culvert. 30 feet in length, a feet wide and 1 foot 5 inches in height. The flight of stone steps leading from the Citadel terminated at the above mentioned channel over which has been placed a large slab of stone to serve as a bridge. The underground passages, the stonework of the walls of the channel, the flight of steps, as well as the monolithic bridge have now been completely restored. A photograph showing the bath and its surroundings after restoration is reproduced on Plate \\b. To the south of the bath were the remains of a small pavilion which was probably used by the king and the members of his household when they came to bathe. This pavilion has been built on two superimposed platforms, the sides of which are faced with moulded stones and friexes of lions. The remains of this pavilion also have been conserved. S.

CONSERVATION OP THE BA YON TEMPLE The Bayon Temple, which rises in the centre of the latest town of Angkor and which is one of the last important shrines left by the Khmer kings, exhibits in certain parts a condition of very advanced decay (Plates Via VID). The monuments belonging to this period (the end of the 13* and the commencement of the 13'* century) were constructed hurriedly and with such a want of care and technical skill that they have resisted, far less than other temples of an earlier date, the inclemency of the weather and the luxurious growth of a tropical vegitation. The crown of the central tower of the Bayon is no longer extant, and the stones of the present top which are still in position have mostly been loosened and dislocated to such an extent that they have become separated from the core of the masonry. In June 1932, in consequence of a violent storm, a rather large number of these stones had become detached from the top portion so that there was reason to apprehend j8 the imminent fall of the remaining ones. In the beginning of the year 1933, therefore, advantage was taken of the dry season to undertake such works of conservation as appeared to be most urgent. It was M. Taoovt. the present Conservator of the monuments of Angkor, who was entrusted with the delicate task of carrying out this restoration which entailed grave risks on account of the conditions under which the work had to be done. Owing to the careless construction of the whole monument it was extremely difficult to erect the necessary scaffoldings for reaching the upper portions of the central tower, which rises to a height of 31 metres above the floor of the surrounding terrace and of 45 metres above the ground-level. The scaffolding was placed on the top of the little shrines which surround the central portion of the tower, the points of support having first been sufficiently strengthened. Then the layers of the masonry which had become detached, and whic"
