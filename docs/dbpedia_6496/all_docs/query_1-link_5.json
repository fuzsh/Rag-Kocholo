It is confidently hoped that the improve- ments, which are the result of a careful and exhaustive revision, will greatly increase its efficiency and popularity. The Vocabulary has been enriched by the insertion 'of a multitude of additional words. The definitions of scientific terms have been carefully verified ; and the pronunciation corrected in accordance with the best authorities. The changes in Etymology alone are so great as almost to constitute it a new work. For greater convenience of reference, the arrangement of the words has been made strictly alphabetical throughout. The Dictionary- is intended as a guide in the study and practical use of the English Language ; and embraces the Meanings of Words, their Pronunciation, and Etymology. The Vocabulary contains every English word sanctioned by good authority, with the exception of obsolete and very rare words, and terms exclusively technical. It includes, however, all the obsolete words that occur in the Bible, the Apocrypha, and the Book of Common Prayer. Owing to the uidc diffusion of scientific know- ledge and the application of scientific discovery to the business of every-day life, many terms that were once purely technical are now entering into the current speech. From this class of words large additions have been made to the Vocabulary. In tiie Definitions the current meaning of a word is usually put first. It is left to the Etymology to connect the present meaning with the root. But where the word still retains more or less of its original force, the Editor has endeavoured tip increase the vividness of the definition by indicating the radical idea in italics. Tt has been the aim throughout to avoid a distracting multiplicity of definitions — not to pile up unnecessary distinctions, but to emphasise only the real differences in the usage of words. The Pronunciation is exhibited in the simplest possible manner. The correct sound of every word is given by being written anew phonetically, thus obviating the use of a confusing array of marks. The accentuation has also been carefully attended to, and different pronunciations have been given in cases where authorities arc divided. . VI PREFACE. In the Etymological part of the work the results of the latest philological research are presented, though, necessarily in the briefest possible way. Each, word ts traced to its origin, whether as belonging to the oldest known form of English, the Anglo- Saxon, or introduced from some sister Teutonic speech, as the Dutch, or borrowed from the classical tongues, either directly, or through the French Cognate words in other languages, though not in the direct line of descent, are inserted, especially when light is thereby thrown on the ptimary sense of the word. In thus tracing words to their origin, the aim has been to show that the study of language is ent of the greatest interest, that every word has a life of its own, and is not an arbitrary and meaningless thing, _ but t 5 e result of laws of historic grow llu It will be seen also that words throw no little light on the history of the men lliat formed and used them ; and that our vast and complex vocabulary can be traced to a few roots expressing the simplest ideas. In this department full advantage has been taken of the best French and German works, as also of the labours of the new English school of philologists, who have done so much during the last twenty jears to promote the historic and scientific study of our own language. Special acknowledgment of indebtedness is due to Diez, Etymolo* gttchet Weritrbueh der Romanitchot Sprathat ftth ed. 187S) ; to Litud's great work ; to the Deutsches Wert cr buck (3d cd. 1878) of Weigaud, one of the contmuators of Grimm ; and above all to Prof. Skeat, whose Etymological Dictionary is indispensable to every scientific student of the English language. Great assistance has also been obtained from the Et} moloyischei XVorterbuch dcr Englischen Sprache (ad ed. 1878) of E. Muller ; from the French Etymological Dictionaries of Brachct and Scheler; from Diefenbach’s Gothic Dictionary j from the works of Morris and Trench ; and from the well-known lectures of Max Muller. As final authorities in their rtspectixe languages, the following dictionaries have been used, Liddell and Scott's Greek . Lexicon (6th ed.) j Lewis and Short in Latin; and the Icelandic Dictionary of Cleasby and Vigfussoa. The Appendix contains a Glossary of the obsolete and rare words and meanings In Milton's poetical works ; a copious list of Prefixes aud Suffixes, with their signification, derivation, and affinities, as far as ascertained; a statement of Grimm’s Law; and many useful lists. The Publishers have only to add that this Dictionary owes Its present form to ar able staff, including the Rev. A. P. Davidson, M.A., under the superintendence oL the late Dr Andrew Findlater. Edinburgh, 1890. W. & R. C. EXPLANATIONS 1V . *>>-. ' ^Ij-E ST^ent! , _> — ■ -j' ‘ The Arrangement of the Words— Every word is gTO gqjp ^ alphabetical order. Each uncompounded verb has its participles, when irregular, placed after it. Exceptional plurals are also given. When a word stands after another, with no meaning given, its meanings can be at once formed from those of the latter, by adding the signification of the affix : thus the meanings of Darkless are obtained by prefixing the meaning of ness, state of being, to those of Dark. The Pronunciation.— The Pronunciation is given immediately a fter each word, by the word being spelled anew. In this new spelling, every consonant used has its ordinary unvarying sound, no consonant being employed that has t, W re // ialt one sound. 'The same sounds are always represented by the same letters, n 0 matter how varied their actual spelling in the language. No consonant used has any mar g attached to it, - wii’d- dlmmur exeepVihir cUdh, wihi.il- A pninfcu 1 iir ctumnuir jlitto- wden sounded a s in thick , but in italics when sounded as in then Unmasked vowel s jj ave always their short sounds, as in lad, led, lid, lot, but, book. The marked vowel t are shown in the following line, which is printed at the bottom of each page — fate, far; me, her; mine; mGte ; mute; muun. Where more than one pronunciation of a word is given, that v,-hi c g ; 5 placed first is more accepted. The Spelling. — When more than one form of a word is given, that which is placed first is the more usual spelling. The Meanings. — The current and most important meaning of a word is usually given first. But in some cases, as in Clerk, Livery, Marshal, wh ere the force of the ' ’^■ord can be made much clearer by tracing its his tor)-, the original meaning is first jgiven, and the successive variations of its usage defined. i The Etymology. — The Etymology of each word is given t^fter the meanings, (within brackets. Where further information regarding a word is given elsewhere, it tis so indicated by a reference. It must be noted under the etymology tliat whenever a Aword is printed thus: Ban, Base, the student is referred to it ; a'l so that the sign — 1 1 > always to be read as meaning ‘ derived from.’ Examples are generally given of , vords that are cognate or correspond to the English words ; but it must be Remembered that they are inserted merely for illustration. For instance, when an EXPLANATIONS TO THE STUDENT. English word Is traced to its Anglo-Saxon form, and then a German word is e ; ven no one should suppose that our English word is derived from the German. G«m a „' and Anglo-Saxon are alike branches from a common Teutonic stem; and have seldom borrowed from each other. Under each word the force of (he prefix is usually given, though not the affix. For fuller explanation m such cases, the student is referred to the list <jf JfccTixes and Affixes in the Appendix.
