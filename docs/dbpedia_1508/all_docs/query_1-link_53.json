        "text": "Mr. Kevin Bolding is the President and CEO of the YMCA of Central Florida. Founded in 1885, the Y is one of the area’s largest nonprofits focused on strengthening communities across a six-county region. Through 14 Family Centers, multiple program locations and outreach services, online enrichment activities, 3 early-childhood learning centers, and 32 school site locations, the Y impacts the lives of over 200,000 Central Floridians each year.\n\nWith nearly 30 years of service to the YMCA, Mr. Bolding has served YMCAs in Lynchburg, VA, Detroit, MI, Miami, FL, and Pittsburgh, PA before his move to Orlando in 2021. Most recently in Pittsburgh, Bolding occupied several senior leadership roles before being selected as President/CEO in May 2016.\n\nDuring his tenure in Pittsburgh, Mr. Bolding led the YMCA through an extensive restructuring of its assets to better position the organization to succeed. Through strategic agreements with affordable housing partners, repurposing YMCA community centers, and advocating for a “Y Without Walls” program outreach model, the Y was able to find innovative new ways to serve and support the Pittsburgh community.\n\nIn Central Florida, Mr. Bolding is working collaboratively with local and regional investors to deepen the YMCA’s presence in the communities it serves. As Mr. Bolding states “When we work with and through our partners, the good work of the Y can be multiplied exponentially.”\n\nMr. Bolding is active both regionally and nationally with the YMCA of the USA, serving most recently on the National Board of Directors. Locally, he serves on the Dr. Phillips, Inc. Board of Directors.\n\nKevin is a graduate of the University of Virginia. Settling recently in Winter Garden, the Boldings are active supporters of the Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation of America and are members of the Orlando chapter of Jack & Jill of America, Inc.\n\nAs Chief Mission & Brand Advancement Officer for the YMCA of Central Florida, Dan Saginario leads the nonprofit’s efforts to advance and amplify the Y’s mission through marketing communications, sales, strategic insights, partnerships, and technology. He brings over 30 years of professional leadership experience in marketing & communications, brand management, special events, and strategic partnerships from Darden, Universal Orlando Resort, and HSN before joining the Y in 2016 as Vice President of Brand & Cause Advocacy.\n\nDan grew up as a Y kid playing soccer at the Downtown Y. He went on to earn his Bachelor’s Degree in Business Administration from UCF and his Master’s in Business Administration from the University of Florida. Dan and his wife have four children and live on a small farm in Oviedo along with their two golden retrievers, chickens, and heard of mini cows.\n\n“The Y was there for me as a kid who was new to Orlando thanks to so many others. It is a privilege to now do likewise and help advance the Y’s impact for good across our community. “Serve one another humbly in love” Galatians 5:13”"
