        "text": "World War I was a pivotal event for U.S. political and economic development, particularly in the realm of public finance. For it was during the war that the federal government ended its traditional reliance on regressive import duties and excise taxes as principal sources of revenue and began a modern era of fiscal governance, one based primarily on the direct and progressive taxation of personal and corporate income. The wartime tax regime, as the historian David M. Kennedy has observed, “occasioned a fiscal revolution in the United States.”\n\n1.

Scholars of U.S. political development have recently led the way in re-emphasizing the importance of international conflicts to U.S. domestic institutional development.

Ira Katznelson and Martin Shefter (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 2002).\n\n4. Legal scholars who have explored the nexus between professionalism and the rise of the modern U.S. nation-state have generally overlooked the significance of World War I, identifying the New Deal and World War II, instead, as the defining historical moments. See, for example, Shamir, Ronen, Managing Legal Uncertainty: Elite Lawyers in the New Deal (Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 1995)Google Scholar; Irons, Peter H., The New Deal Lawyers (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1982)Google Scholar; Ernst, Daniel R., “Dicey's Disciple on the D.C.

Whereas these New Deal studies focus primarily on the role of government lawyers as litigators, this article examines how legal professionals applied their skills and experience as transactional lawyers to their role as government administrators. For examples of the traditional historiography's focus on lawyers as litigators, see Twiss, Benjamin, Lawyers and the Constitution: How Laissez-faire Came to the Supreme Court (New York: Russell and Russell, 1962)Google Scholar; Kluger, Richard, Simple Justice: The History of Brown v.

Scholars of Western state-formation, with their broad comparative analyses, have documented the importance of wars to the emergence of modern nation-states, but they have been less concerned with exploring the microlevel details of World War I or with the contributions made by legal professionals.

Brian Balogh has described “the merger of professionals and federal administrative capacity,” as the rise of the “proministrative state” during the post–World War II period.

Although Skowronek was referring to the role of nineteenth-century government lawyers, his emphasis on the “intellectual skills and human talents” that lawyers brought to the resolution of crisis situations applies equally well to the World War I Treasury department lawyers (Ibid., 31–34); see also Hurst, J.

It should come as no surprise that attorneys working for President Woodrow Wilson—the lawyer/scholar turned statesman who arguably did the most to advance the intellectual campaign for the administrative state—were at the forefront of using tax laws and policies to develop the administrative infrastructure of the modern state.

The 1913 income tax had a $3,000 exemption level for individuals and a $4,000 exemption for married couples, and it had graduated rates that began with a 1 percent “normal” tax on all incomes above the exemption levels and included “surtax” rates that ranged from an additional 1 to 6 percent, with the maximum rate applied to incomes over $500,000 (Revenue Act of 1913, chap. 16, 38 Stat. 114, 166, 168).\n\n21. Effective tax rates refer to the ratio of a taxpayer's tax liability to income. For those few taxpayers who had annual incomes that exceeded $1 million the effective tax rate skyrocketed from 10 percent to over 70 percent between 1916 and 1918. Brownlee, W.

Brownlee, “Russell Cornell Leffingwell.” According to Robert Swaine, when the United States officially entered the war, Leffingwell demonstrated his patriotism—and perhaps his disillusionment with his successful legal career—by joining the Plattsburg Reserve Officers' Training Camp. Cravath was astonished to learn about his junior law partner's seemingly rash decision, and he intervened to ensure that Leffingwell's expertise in legal and financial matters would not be wasted on the battlefield. Cravath contended that Leffingwell with his age and experience could provide the country with greater service in Washington than by “toting a gun, doing K.P., or teaching American young men how to stick their bayonets through the bodies of imaginary Huns” (Swaine, Cravath Firm, 209).\n\n49.

Many Treasury lawyers went on to have prosperous postwar tax law careers, including Prettyman, Hopkins, Robert N.

Matthews began her career as a clerk in the BIR in 1914, worked her way up to become a senior attorney, and then became the first female judge on the U.S. Board of Tax Appeals in 1930 (“Miss Matthews, U.S. Tax Expert,” Washington Post, March 25, 1960); see also the appointment and promotion letters contained in “Folder 11: Correspondence, 1914–1930,” Annabel Matthews Papers, 1880–1960, Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass.\n\n50.

Roper informed business journalists that they also had a professional obligation to remind “the man who pays his Liberty tax in full, without question or murmur, is no less a patriot than the man who invests in the Liberty bond or volunteers his services for military duty.” Roper, “The War Revenue Act and the Taxpayer,” 5, DCRP.\n\n75. Even before the Revenue Act of 1917 was introduced in Congress, the New York Chamber of Commerce issued a statement urging “the advisability of a more nearly universal participation of the country's population in bearing the burdens of taxation; that the indirect sources of revenue should not be abandoned or unduly minimized, and that direct sources should not be overworked to the extent of arresting the financial ability of the country to develop enterprise at home and abroad” (“New York Chamber of Commerce and the Excess Profits Tax,” Commercial and Financial Chronicle, February 3, 1917, 421); “Opposition to the Excess Profits Tax By Business Men,” Commercial and Financial Chronicle, February 10, 1917, 517; “The Injustice of the Excess Profits Tax,” Commercial and Financial Chronicle, May 19, 1917, 1957.\n\n80. Reflecting back on the war, McAdoo boasted in his memoirs about how he, unlike his Civil War predecessor Treasury secretary Salmon Chase, was able to appeal directly to the patriotic fervor of the people through several successful and oversubscribed bond drives. “Any great war must necessarily be a popular movement,” wrote McAdoo. “It is a kind of crusade; and like all crusades, it sweeps along on a powerful stream of romanticism.” To harness such powerful emotions, McAdoo recalled, “we went direct to the people and that means to everybody—to businessmen, workers, farmers, bankers, millionaires, school teachers, laborers. We capitalized the profound impulse called patriotism” (McAdoo, Crowded Years, 374).\n\n86. McAdoo to Kitchin and Simmons, September 5, 1918, Reel 12, RCLP; McAdoo further informed lawmakers that the Treasury “sought to avoid the issue of bonds at such rate and upon such terms as might result ultimately, when the war is won, in the accumulation of great wealth in the hands of a relatively small proportion of our population, carrying interest at a high rate and exempt from taxes” (Gilbert, American Financing of WWI, 126).\n\n91. From June 1916 to June 1919, the money supply expanded by over $11 billion and consumer prices increased nearly 66 percent while the cost of living rose over 70 percent. As economic historians have explained, “The Federal Reserve became to all intents and purposes the bond-selling window of the Treasury, using its monetary policy almost exclusively to that end” (Friedman and Schwartz, Monetary History, 216).\n\n100. Although Seligman had been a longtime supporter of graduated income taxes as the proper method of taxing according to the progressive principle of ability to pay, he opposed the excess-profits tax because “the choice of capital not only constitutes a clumsy attempt to reach taxable ability, but introduces a gross inequality in principle and a deplorable uncertainty in administration” (Seligman, Edwin R. A., “The Excess-Profits Tax” The Nation, March 28, 1918, 365–66Google Scholar).\n\n104. Arnett, Claude Kitchin, 260; Blakey and Blakey, Federal Income Tax, 133. Some Treasury lawyers shared the vision of a postwar political economy that retained the excess profits tax as a permanent bulwark against corporate concentration. “The manifest advantage” of the excess profits tax, one Treasury lawyer wrote, is that it could become “a permanent part of the Government's revenue system, and can be used, if need be, as a check upon monopolies or trusts earning exorbitant profits” (Perry S. Talbert [Head of Law Division, Commissioner of Internal Revenue] to George R. Cooksey [Assistant to Secretary McAdoo], August 8, 1917, quoted in Brownlee “Economists and the Modern Tax System,” 408). Talbert was a member of the BIR throughout the war, and he leveraged his position to become a Washington, D.C., tax consultant after the war. Roper, Fifty Years, 181–82; Talbert, P. S., “Relief Provisions and Treasury Procedure on Appeal,” in The Federal Income Tax, ed. Haig, Robert M. (New York: Columbia University Press, 1921), 250–61Google Scholar.\n\n111. Tumulty to Leffingwell, August 1, 1918; Wilson to Kitchin, August 2, 1918, NARA Excess Profits Tax Folder. Leffingwell bolstered his case by directly contacting President Wilson to notify him that the difference between the two levies was not merely semantic: “It is sufficient to say that the difference is not one of words but one of substance and goes to the very root of the social and economic problem” (Leffingwell to Wilson, August 2, 1918, quoted in Ingle, Pilgrimage, 150).\n\n112. Arthur Capper (Chairman of the Farmers' National Committee for War Finance) to McAdoo, August 10, 1918; Leffingwell to Capper, August 27, 1918, NARA Excess Profits Tax Folder. Agrarian associations echoed these demands in a more formal proposal before lawmakers, which called for the “democratic financing of war costs by the retention of the income and excess profits taxes” (“Farmers Outline Their Program for Legislation,” New York Times, December 15, 1919, 1). Some newspaper editors, and even some officials within the Wilson administration, seemed to agree with the farmers (“Dodging the War-Profits Issue,” New York World, July 30, 1918, 7; “An Example of War Profits,” New York World, August 1, 1918, clippings in NARA Excess Profits Tax Folder).\n\n114. Corporations were required to pay the higher of either a graduated excess-profits tax, ranging from 35 to 70 percent, measured with reference to invested capital, or a war-profits tax of 80 percent on net income in excess of a specific credit and the average net income for the prewar years of 1911–13 (Blakey and Blakey, Federal Income Tax, 167–69).\n\n119. Ibid., 639. Ballantine also maintained that the congressional use of “invested capital” to measure excess profits was part of the practical, institutional deference that the Court had long granted in the context of tax laws: “The decided cases show that the presumption that each act of Congress is valid, is applied with special readiness to revenue acts and that the Court, even without the persuasive effect of the imperative need for war revenue, would not be likely to declare invalid a taxing act framed with anything like reasonable regard to its just incidence” (639).\n\n122. Ballantine, “Constitutional Aspects,” 635, 642. Despite his initial reservations about the administrability of an excess profits tax, he conceded that the levy had distributional merit: “So far as revenue yield was concerned a sufficiently high flat tax upon business or corporate incomes would have been as effective as the [excess-profits tax], and would have been easier to compute and to administer. A high flat tax would, however, have been borne with undue hardship on the enterprise” that was only moderately connected to the war effort. “And it would not have reached the limit of what was conceived to be the tax-paying ability of the enterprise enjoying, perhaps through war conditions, a very high return upon its investment” (Ibid).\n\n126. After the war, Glass commended Leffingwell as being “an indispensable factor in the most important activities of the Department.” Similarly, McAdoo recalled that he valued how Leffingwell, the “Wall Street Republican,” challenged his ideas without being disloyal. “While [Leffingwell's] point of view and mine were frequently at variance, nevertheless these differences were brought out in argument and enabled me to reach decisions with greater confidence and satisfaction to myself than if he had agreed with me about everything,” wrote McAdoo. “Whenever I made a final decision Leffingwell acquiesced and carried it out with loyalty and energy” (Carter Glass to Leffingwell, February 2, 1920, quoted in Pulling, Selected Letters of R. C. Leffingwell, 9; McAdoo, Crowded Years, 430; Murray, , “Bureaucracy and Bipartisanship”Google Scholar).\n\n127. Writing to a friend in 1952, Leffingwell recounted that he was disappointed but not surprised to learn that Wilson had appointed Houston ahead of him. After all, Leffingwell was neither a Democrat nor a close friend of Wilson's. “Under all the circumstances,” Leffingwell wrote, “it was most natural and proper for the President to appoint a long-time friend and Democrat and trusted Cabinet minister to this high office, instead of a stranger whom he knows only by reputation” (quoted in Pulling, Selected Letters of R. C. Leffingwell, 7). Leffingwell's postwar status as a partner in J. P. Morgan probably also cost him an appointment in Franklin Roosevelt's administration (Schuker, “Leffingwell, Russell Cornell,” in Dictionary of American Biography, 377; Swaine, Cravath Firm, 2:315).\n\n131. A Court of Internal Revenue Tax Appeals did not come into being, but this idea may have been the kernel that led to the creation of specialized federal trial courts for tax issues, the U.S. Board of Tax Appeals, which was a forerunner of today's U.S. Tax Courts (Dubroff, Harold, The United States Tax Court: An Historical Analysis [Chicago: Commerce Clearing House, 1979Google Scholar]). Tax scholars have analyzed the case for a specialized court of tax appeals, see Popkin, William D., “Why a Court of Tax Appeals is So Elusive,” Tax Notes, May 28, 1990, 1101–10Google Scholar; Griswold, , “The Need for a Court of Tax Appeals,” Harvard Law Review 57 (1944): 1153CrossRefGoogle Scholar."
