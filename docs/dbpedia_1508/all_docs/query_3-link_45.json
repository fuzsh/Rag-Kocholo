I did not serve in the military but I did spend over 15 years working for the defense industy supporting the troops in defense of this nation. My mission now is to help those who support this nation to earn passive income and grow their net worth so that they can live the lives they have dreamed of.

On this day in 1950, President Harry S. Truman established Armed Forces Day. Peering through literature reviews gives you a different view of those who served. When you FOCUS, you find that these leaders cared about the military. The theme of the first Armed Forces Day was “Teamed for Defense,” and it had a three-fold mission: 1. To celebrate and recognize all Americans serving in uniform, as well as those who had served before. 2. To bring citizens closer to their military by hosting base open houses and public displays of new military technology. 3. To promote the unity of the military services established in the National Security Act of 1947. #A1CLorenzoRWilson\n\nWomen Veterans have been crucial in defending their countries, constituting 10% of the Veteran population in the United States. This number is expected to grow over time, reflecting their enduring commitment and contribution. Despite facing discrimination, women Veterans have served in every U.S. conflict, from WWII to recent times, taking on diverse roles from non-combat to combat positions like pilots and military police officers. Today, they encounter challenges, with a 22% higher likelihood of underemployment compared to male Veterans, yet over 40% have STEM-related military specializations. Help us celebrate and support our women veterans! #womenveterans #celebrate\n\nDOES ANYONE KNOW IF JD VANCE has a COMBAT ACTION RIBBON? If so, I will update my post: TRUMPERS - Why would you conflate the term WAR with COMBAT, and let's add deployment and deployed for the Marine Public Relations dude. And when you say \"saw combat,\" what does that mean? Dropping bombs or launching missiles from a ship at sea or clearing houses one at a time. What's the technical term? DOOR KICKERS... Trumpers and JD, if you keep splitting hairs, you will become as bald as the ex-President! Let's unpack this. First, \"war\" and \"combat\" are not synonymous, just like \"truth\" and \"Trump's Twitter feed.\" War is...

Note the difference and plan your social media posts appropriately. As GI Joe would say, \"Now you know, and knowing is half the battle.\" 💯 Hot Take🔥 It's really not appropriate to say \"Happy\" Memorial Day. When you think about the true meaning of the day, it's more of a solemn note. #UnpopularOpinion . . . #SocialMedia #SocialMediaMarketing #SocialMediaStrategy #SocialMediaManager #SmallBusinessOwner #DigitalMarketing #digitalmarketing #socialmediaguru #smallbusinesssupport #MemorialDay #VeteransDay #Philadelphia #Marketing #SocialMediaExpert #SocialMediaStrategist #BucksCountyPA #BucksCountyBusiness #DoylestownPA #WarringtonPA #ChalfontPA #NewtownPA #MontcoPA #MakeItMontco #HatboroPA #HorshamPA #PlymouthMeeting #AdmasCountyPA #FrederickMD #SocialMediaHelp\n\nUnited Nations Peacekeeping must reflect the people it serves to ensure inclusive & lasting peace.
