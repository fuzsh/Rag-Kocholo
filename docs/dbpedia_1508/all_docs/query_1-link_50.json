        "text": "Primary care providers treat a variety of medical conditions and help manage many health-related issues throughout their patient’s lives. Primary care is considered the first-line treatment avenue for all non-emergent medical conditions. Primary care physicians focus on managing the total body coordinating referrals to specialists when needed.\n\nPrimary care practitioners help their patients navigate their chronic medical conditions, reducing risk factors for diseases and improving overall wellness. Primary care providers are associated with helping you and your family achieve an improved quality of life and a longer, healthier life while reducing the overall cost of medical care.\n\nPrimary care providers provide a wide range of medical services including acute, chronic, and preventive treatments. A primary care doctor can evaluate and treat non-emergent medical issues such as coughs, colds, urinary tract infections, and general musculoskeletal issues without the expensive emergency room or prompt care bill.\n\nPrimary care providers also maintain long-term relationships with their patients taking care of chronic medical conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure and coordinating referrals to specialists when needed. During your annual wellness exam, your practitioners will arrange appropriate screening tests and provide tips to lead to a healthier life.\n\nIf you are new to the clinic, the best way to schedule an appointment is to call the primary care clinic nearest you and talk to one of our patient care specialists. They will register in our system and will schedule your first appointment.\n\nIf you are already a patient at our clinic, use the patient portal to schedule your next appointment. For patients new to the portal, no worries, create a new account and follow the prompts to set up your account. The patient portal allows access to your care anytime and from anywhere.\n\nDuring your first appointment, the focus will be on learning about you. Your primary care doctor will obtain information about your medical history, specific needs, and any concerns you may have so that future visits will be more personalized.\n\nA general physical exam will be conducted and depending on the reason for the visit, specific exams and tests may be performed.\n\nThe frequency of visits to a primary care physician’s office depends on your age and health. For patients under 50 who are healthy, you may only need to visit the doctor’s office once every three years. For those 50 and older, following up with your primary care at least once a year is typically recommended. This once-a-year recommendation is also the minimum number of visits needed for those who take prescription medications.\n\nFor those with chronic medical conditions requiring frequent evaluations, such as diabetes, it is not uncommon to see your primary care physician every three months or sooner. Each person’s situation will dictate how often you need to be seen by your doctor.\n\nWhen visiting your primary care doctor’s office, bring your current health insurance information and any documents you need the doctor to complete. It is important to bring a list of your current medical conditions and medications including vitamins/supplements, with the name, dosage, and frequency of each medication. Finally, create a list of questions you want to ask the doctor, this will ensure you make the most of your appointment and leave feeling satisfied that all your questions were answered.\n\nYes. Primary care practitioners are well trained in managing a wide variety of chronic conditions including diabetes and high blood pressure. Primary care doctors can order appropriate tests to monitor the disease and prescribe medications as needed. In addition, they will arrange appropriate screening tests to monitor the effect of the chronic condition on your body. If needed, a primary care provider can coordinate an appointment with a specialist.\n\nComplete Health office. Our knowledgeable staff can help guide your next steps. For injuries or illnesses that are life-threatening or can result in significant disability, calling 9-1-1 and obtaining emergency care is best for these situations.\n\nIn non-emergent situations, our office can contact your provider’s team to obtain a quick response with the next steps in management. If after-hours, an on-call provider will be able to provide you with the initial management steps and help schedule an appointment with your doctor’s office."
