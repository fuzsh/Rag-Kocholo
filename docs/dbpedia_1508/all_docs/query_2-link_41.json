        "text": "Introduction\n\nIn July 2023, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved nirsevimab (Beyfortus, Sanofi and AstraZeneca), a long-acting monoclonal antibody, for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)–associated lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) among infants and children aged <24 months (1).* Nirsevimab is administered as a 1-dose intramuscular injection shortly before or during the RSV season (typically fall through spring).† Since October 2021, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Maternal and Pediatric RSV Work Group (Work Group) has reviewed data on RSV among infants and young children and evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of nirsevimab, and assessed the quality of the efficacy and safety evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) framework (2,3). The Evidence to Recommendation (EtR) Framework was used to develop recommendations (4,5). Evidence regarding potential use of nirsevimab was presented to ACIP at meetings during June 2022–August 2023. On August 3, 2023, ACIP recommended nirsevimab for infants aged <8 months who are born during or entering their first RSV season and for infants and children aged 8–19 months who are at increased risk for severe RSV disease and are entering their second RSV season.\n\nRSV Among Infants and Young Children\n\nRSV infection is the leading cause of hospitalization among U.S. infants (6); most children are infected during the first year of life, and nearly all have been infected by age 2 years (7,8). Infants with RSV infection frequently develop bronchiolitis, an LRTI that can be severe and result in hospitalization. Approximately 50,000–80,000 RSV-associated hospitalizations (9,10) and 100–300 RSV-associated deaths (11,12) occur annually among U.S. infants and children aged <5 years.\n\nThe rate of RSV-associated hospitalization among infants born at ≤30 weeks’ gestation (premature) is three times that of term infants (13). Premature infants also have higher rates of RSV-associated intensive care unit (ICU) admission (14). Although prematurity is a recognized risk factor for RSV-associated hospitalization, RSV is also the leading cause of hospitalization among healthy term infants. An estimated 79% of infants and children aged <2 years hospitalized with RSV have no underlying medical conditions (13).\n\nBefore licensure of nirsevimab, the only FDA-approved product to prevent severe RSV disease among infants and young children was palivizumab, another monoclonal antibody. However, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends palivizumab only for children with certain underlying medical conditions (comprising <5% of all infants), and its use is further limited by high cost and the requirement for monthly dosing (15,16).\n\nNirsevimab Efficacy and Safety\n\nAmong infants aged <8 months who were born during or entering their first RSV season, efficacy was evaluated through 150 days after injection. For the GRADE assessment, results from the phase 3 and phase 2b trials were pooled (17,18). Only infants who received the recommended dose of nirsevimab were included in pooled estimates.†† Pooled efficacy in preventing medically attended RSV-associated LRTI§§ was 79.0% (95% CI = 68.5%–86.1%; 31 of 2,579 in nirsevimab arm and 80 of 1,293 in placebo arm), efficacy in preventing RSV-associated LRTI with hospitalization was 80.6% (95% CI = 62.3%–90.1%; 12 of 2,579 in nirsevimab arm and 33 of 1,293 in placebo arm), and efficacy in preventing RSV-associated LRTI with ICU admission was 90.0% (95% CI = 16.4%–98.8%; one of 2,579 in nirsevimab arm and six of 1,293 in placebo arm). No deaths attributable to RSV were reported in either trial.¶¶ The incidence of serious adverse events*** was not increased in the nirsevimab arm compared with that in the placebo arm.††† The overall evidence certainty using GRADE criteria was rated as moderate. The GRADE evidence profile and supporting evidence for the EtR Framework are available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/recs/grade/nirsevimab-season1-rsv-infants-children.html and https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/recs/grade/nirsevimab-season1-rsv-infants-children-etr.html.\n\nAmong infants at increased risk for severe disease who are entering their second RSV season, evidence was derived from a single trial that enrolled 615 preterm infants born at <35 weeks’ gestation who were eligible to receive palivizumab and 310 infants with either chronic lung disease requiring medical intervention within 6 months of randomization or hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease (CHD) (19). Participants were randomized to receive nirsevimab or palivizumab.§§§ Efficacy against medically attended RSV-associated LRTI was extrapolated from pharmacokinetic data.¶¶¶ Nirsevimab concentration levels among infants and children aged ≤24 months with chronic lung disease or CHD who received 200 mg nirsevimab entering their second RSV season were comparable to levels among those who received 50 mg if weighing <5 kg (<11 lb) and 100 mg if weighing ≥5 kg (≥11 lb) in their first RSV season. During the participants’ second RSV season, the incidence of serious adverse events did not significantly differ between the nirsevimab and palivizumab arms. The overall evidence certainty using GRADE criteria was rated as very low. Because nirsevimab appears to have efficacy as high as, or higher than, palivizumab (although no head-to-head efficacy trials exist) (20), and is assumed to be less costly (21), replacing palivizumab with nirsevimab for the palivizumab-eligible children entering their second season is expected to be cost saving. The GRADE evidence profile and supporting evidence for the EtR Framework are available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/recs/grade/nirsevimab-season2-rsv-infants-children.html and https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/recs/grade/nirsevimab-season2-rsv-infants-children-etr.html.\n\nClinical Guidance\n\nTiming of Nirsevimab Administration\n\nProviders should administer nirsevimab to infants aged <8 months and to infants and children aged 8–19 months who are at increased risk for severe RSV disease beginning shortly before the start of the RSV season. On the basis of pre–COVID-19 pandemic patterns, nirsevimab could be administered in most of the continental United States from October through the end of March. Infants born shortly before or during the RSV season should receive nirsevimab within 1 week of birth. Nirsevimab administration can occur during the birth hospitalization or in the outpatient setting. Optimal timing for nirsevimab administration is shortly before the RSV season begins; however, nirsevimab may be administered to age-eligible infants and children who have not yet received a dose at any time during the season. Only a single dose of nirsevimab is recommended for an RSV season. Infants with prolonged birth hospitalizations related to prematurity or other causes should receive nirsevimab shortly before or promptly after hospital discharge.¶¶¶¶ No evidence is available to support use of nirsevimab for prevention of hospital-acquired RSV infection, and nirsevimab is not recommended for this indication.\n\nBecause the timing of the onset, peak, and decline of RSV activity might vary geographically, providers can adjust administration schedules based on local epidemiology. RSV seasonality in tropical climates (including southern Florida, Guam, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, U.S.-affiliated Pacific Islands, and U.S. Virgin Islands) might differ from that of most of the continental United States or be unpredictable (21–23). In Alaska, RSV seasonality is less predictable, and the duration of RSV activity is often longer than the national average duration (24). Providers in these jurisdictions should consult state, local, or territorial guidance on timing of nirsevimab administration.\n\nCoadministration with Routine Childhood Vaccines\n\nOn the basis of limited data from clinical trials, coadministration of nirsevimab with routine vaccines resulted in a similar rate of adverse events compared with administration of vaccines alone (25). Nirsevimab is not expected to interfere with the immune response to other routine childhood immunizations (26). In accordance with general best practices for immunization, simultaneous administration of nirsevimab with age-appropriate vaccines is recommended (27).\n\nInfants and Children Aged 8–19 Months at Increased Risk for Severe RSV Disease and Entering Their Second RSV Season\n\nInfants and children aged 8–19 months who are at increased risk for severe RSV disease and who are entering their second RSV season (timing of season as defined above) are recommended to receive nirsevimab. Replacing palivizumab with nirsevimab is expected to be cost saving, and ACIP recommends nirsevimab for eligible children entering their second RSV season, similar to groups of children recommended by AAP for palivizumab during their second RSV season (16) (Box). In addition, research suggests that some American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) children experience high rates of severe RSV disease. A recent study found that incidence of RSV-associated hospitalization among some AI/AN children aged 12–23 months was four to 10 times that of similar-aged children across seven sites in the United States (28). These studies have been limited to specific populations and might not be broadly representative of risk in all AI/AN children. Some AI/AN communities live in remote regions, making transportation of children with severe RSV more challenging (16). Given the available evidence, ACIP also recommends nirsevimab for AI/AN children entering their second RSV season.\n\nPrecautions and Contraindications\n\nWhen administering nirsevimab to children with increased risk for bleeding, providers should follow ACIP’s general best practice guidelines for immunization (27). Nirsevimab is contraindicated in persons with a history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) after a previous dose or to a product component. Adverse reactions might occur after administration of nirsevimab alone; these reactions may be reported to MedWatch online (https://www.fda.gov/medwatch), by fax, by mail, or by contacting FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.*****\n\nAdverse reactions might occur after the coadministration of nirsevimab with a vaccine; these reactions should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), and reports should specify that the patient received nirsevimab on the VAERS form.††††† Reports can be submitted to VAERS online, by fax, or by mail. Additional information about VAERS is available by telephone (1-800-822-7967) or online (https://vaers.hhs.gov). When adverse reactions that occur after the coadministration of nirsevimab with a vaccine are reported to VAERS, additional reporting of the same adverse reactions to MedWatch is not necessary."
