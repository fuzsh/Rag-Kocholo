        "text": "Upcoming Lectures and Conferences\n\nPast Lectures\n\nThe UNC School of Information and Library Science (SILS) invites distinguished scholars and industry leaders to share their knowledge and expertise with students, faculty, and the general public throughout the year. When possible and with the speaker’s permission, we record talks and post them to our YouTube channel. The following list highlights four of our most prominent, recurring lecture series:\n\nLucile Kelling Henderson Lectures\n\nThe Lucile Kelling Henderson Lecture Series was established in 1990 to honor the memory of Lucile K. Henderson, SILS faculty member (1932-1960) and dean (1954-1960). As an excellent teacher, administrator, counselor and adviser, Henderson made many contributions to the University and to the profession. She died in 1990 at the age of 95.\n\nPast Lecturers\n\nOCLC/Frederick G. Kilgour Lecture in Information Science\n\nThe Frederick G. Kilgour Lecture was established in 2004 by OCLC Online Computer Library Center on the occasion of Dr. Kilgour’s 90th birthday. Dr. Kilgour was a Distinguished Research Professor Emeritus at SILS and Founder of OCLC Online Computer Library Center. Of his many innovations, he is most noted for inventing the WorldCat database in1971. Today, OCLC is a nonprofit global library cooperative providing shared technology services, original research, and community programs so that libraries can better fuel learning, research, and innovation. For more information, visit www.oclc.org.\n\nPast Lecturers\n\nSusan Steinfirst Memorial Lecture in Children’s Literature\n\nThe Susan Steinfirst Memorial Lecture in Children’s Literature honors the memory of Susan Steinfirst, a professor of children’s and young adult literature at SILS from 1976 to 1996. Steinfirst dedicated her life to the promotion of children’s literature by teaching future librarians and by publishing scholarly works in the field. She died of cancer in 1997. The lecture is made possible by the Steinfirst Memorial Fund, which was established through gifts from Professor Steinfirst’s husband, Gene Story, as well as other family members and friends.\n\nIn 2016, the Steinfirst vision was expanded to include the Steinfirst Artist-in-Residency Program, which gives Triangle-area youth an opportunity to study with internationally acclaimed authors and illustrators. The artist-in-residence experience was partly funded by a gift from Professor Steinfirst’s niece, Julia Steinfirst Howard, and her husband, John, and received support through the Drs. Barbara and Robert S. Martin Research Assistant program.\n\nPast Lecturers\n\nSILS Commencement Speakers\n\nView past SILS commencement speakers below.\n\nPast Commencement Speakers\n\nPast Conferences and Symposia\n\nSymposium on Information for Social Good\n\nSILS hosted its first Symposium on Information for Social Good on April 21, 2017. Through panels and poster presentations, SILS graduate and undergraduate students addressed advanced questions and problems related to current ethical and social justice issues that impact information science. The format has remained the same for subsequent symposiums, though the theme and focus change each year.\n\nSymposium on Blockchain and Trusted Repositories\n\nSILS brought together speakers and organized panels to address the technical, financial, and legal/regulatory issues related to current and potential blockchain applications. The event was sponsored by the SILS Knowledge Trust, UNC Center for Media Law & Policy and The Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise. A water main break in Chapel Hill and the resulting water shortage forced the symposium to conclude less than halfway through its scheduled time. Slides from the speakers have bee shared on the event’s website.\n\nCHIIR 2016\n\nThe first annual ACM SIGIR Conference on Human Information Interaction and Retrieval (CHIIR 2016) was held March 13-17, 2016, in Chapel Hill. Over 130 attendees came from all over the world to share and discuss research on the user-centered aspects of information interaction and information retrieval. CHIIR (pronounced “cheer”) was the merger of two successful previous events, the Information Interaction in Context conference (IIiX) and the Human Computer Information Retrieval symposium (HCIR). In addition to the usual conference highlights–including poster presentations, paper sessions, keynotes, and workshops–the event featured an early look at Google User Study Mobile, a van the company has equipped to serve as a portable user studies lab. CHIIR was one of the first stops on the lab’s cross-country tour.\n\nFull conference proceeding are now available from the ACM Digital Library or search CHIIR at dl.acm.org\n\nSILS and UNC’s Odum Institute for Research in Social Science co-presented the 12th International Conference on Digital Preservation (iPRES) November 2-6, 2015, in Chapel Hill. The conference drew 327 delegates from 22 countries, and the program included 12 long papers, 15 short papers, 33 posters, three demos, six workshops, three tutorials, and five panels, as well as several interactive sessions and a Digital Preservation Showcase. iPRES rotates between Asia, Europe, and North America. It had not been in North America since 2009, and it will not return until 2018. Each of the iPRES2015 contributions can be accessed through the iPRES2015 proceedings collection at http://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:429627. For the full proceedings volume, see specifically https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:429524.\n\nKeynote addresses are available to watch on the SILS Vimeo channel:\n\n“The Digital Afterlives of This Bridge Called My Back: Public Feminism and Open Access,” by Lisa Nakamura, Professor in the Department of American Culture at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor\n\n“Mass Digitization of Cultural Heritage: Can Copyright Obstacles Be Overcome?” by Pamela Samuelson, Professor of Law and Information at the University of California, Berkeley, are available to watch on the SILS Vimeo page vimeo.com/uncsils.\n\nIP2050"
