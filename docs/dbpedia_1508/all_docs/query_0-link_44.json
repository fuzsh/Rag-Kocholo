        "text": "The Diversity Strategic Plan Committee was charged with informing the development of UMB’s first Diversity Strategic Plan, which will serve as a road map and framework to activate and advance diversity, equity, and inclusion at UMB.\n\nThe committee adopted a data-driven, evidence-based approach to identify university equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) priorities and needs. It extensively reviewed surveys, climate studies, our UMB Strategic Plan, University-wide strategic goals and outcomes, and best practices at UMB and throughout higher education and industry to inform the plan's development. During spring 2023, the committee hosted listening sessions to learn more from our UMB community about future directions in EDI.\n\nFurther movement on the DSP developed through the engagement and collective action of the DSP Committee, a broadly representative body inclusive of students, staff, faculty, and administrators from various ranks and from across UMB. The DSP discussed diversity, equity, and inclusion at UMB until four clear themes emerged, which became the basis for the four Theme Working Groups, listed below with their full titles and the names of their leads.\n\nRecruitment and Retention: Yolanda Ogbolu, PhD, NNP, FNAP, FAAN, the Bill and Joanne Conway Dean of the University of Maryland School of Nursing and Sheila Blackshear, MS, CAAP, Diversity, ADA and Affirmative Action Administrator\n\nClimate/Experience (later Experience and Climate): Courtney Resnik, EdD, Director, Academic Administration\n\nProfessional Development and Career Advancement: C. Daniel Mullins (see above) and Wei Ming Dariotis, PhD, Assistant Vice President for the Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion.\n\nEducation, Scholarship, and Service (later Scholarship, Service, and Education): Franck Dumetz, PhD, Research Associate, Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine and Amy Ramirez, MA, Director of the Office of International Services"
