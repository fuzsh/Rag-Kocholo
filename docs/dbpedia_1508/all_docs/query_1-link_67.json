(front) Lyda McCartin, who begins her tenure as director of the iSchool in June 2023\n\n\"We are in this business together,\" said cybersecurity expert Eddie Doyle in his address to students, faculty and alumni leaders at the 38th Deans' and Directors' Lecture and Awards ceremony on March 16.\n\n\"We guard cybersecurity. You are part of the cybersecurity dynamic because you guard precious information.\"\n\nDescribing the internet as the \"printing press on steroids,\" Doyle discussed various threat actors — hackers with nefarious intent — and encouraged the iSchool to continue educating and preparing students to push back on these attacks. With more than 3.4 million cybersecurity jobs available, Doyle said employees with these skill sets are the \"heroes.\"\n\nSpecial Recognition\n\nDoyle's keynote was just one highlight of this annual event, which honors past and current deans and directors of the school for their many contributions to the school and the profession.\n\nDean Emeritus Fred Roper presented Karen Gavigan with the College of Information and Communications 2023 Award for Outstanding Leadership. Gavigan came out of retirement to serve as interim during the search for a new iSchool director.\n\n“She could have been a caretaker interim director, but in her inimitable fashion she chose to be proactive,” said Roper. “She worked with the faculty to develop new degree programs and she worked to expand existing programs — particularly the B.S. in Information Science.”\n\nDean Tom Reichert praised Gavigan for \"milestones\" of her two years as interim: the 50th Anniversary celebration, Davis College upgrades, as well as an increase in undergraduate enrollment and the development of the cybersecurity program.\n\nAwards and Scholarship Presentations\n\nAssociate professor Susan Rathbun-Grubb inducted 13 students into the Beta Omega Chapter of Beta Phi Mu, the library and information science honor society. Inductees were selected by the faculty based on scholarship, leadership and service. The initiates were: Laura Carter, Frances Caroline Crouse, Allison Crout, Michelle M. Grabiec, Andrea Harmon, Randy Dantrell Heath, Gabriel C. Marz, Sherry V. Neal, Melinda Joy Nye, Heather Lynn Richardson, Peter Santore, Kathryn Thoemke and Edward Leon Wilson, Jr.\n\nOther honorees were:"
