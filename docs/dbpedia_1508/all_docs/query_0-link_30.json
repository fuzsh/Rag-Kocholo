        "text": "1910 Separation on Cruelty Grounds\n\nLONDON What counsel described as a remarkable suit, it being one where both husband and wife alleged cruelty and asked for a judicial separation, was begun in the Divorce Court yesterday. The petitioner was Mrs. Grace Naish and the respondent Captain Theodore Edward Naish, R.E. On both sides charges of cruelty were denied. Every effort was made at the suggestion of the judge to get the couple to come to an agreement without going into the details of the case, but without success, the custody of the child of the marriage being, it is understood, the chief obstacle to a settlement. There was one child, now about ten years old.\n\n1935 Accident Blamed on Two Pilots\n\nWASHINGTON The crash near Macon, Mo., of Transcontinental Western Airways’ crack coast-to-coast night plane, Sky Chief, with a loss of five lives, last May 6, was described as due to bad weather, plus wrong weather forecasts by both government and company experts and faulty work by the ground personnel of the airlines, in a report made public today by Secretary of Commerce Daniel C. Roper. The department announced that as a matter of procedure charges of five violations would be filed against both pilots who lost their lives in the crash. The violations including flying in fog when unable to maintain two-way radio communications.\n\n1960 Robens to Head Coal Board\n\nLONDON Labor party leader Hugh Gaitskell today gave a reluctant blessing to the impending departure from the House of Commons of one of his most loyal and effective supporters — at a time when his own political fortunes have descended to a new low. Alfred Robens, Minister of Labor in the last Labor government in 1951, has been offered by the Conservative government the lucrative and important job of chairman of the National Coal Board. For Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, it is a political move comparable to that of President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940, when he brought Republicans Henry M. Stimson and Frank Knox into his Cabinet."
