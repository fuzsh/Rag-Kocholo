He began his career as a Physical Therapist Assistant at the East Cooper Regional Medical Center in Mt. Pleasant. While there, he also was the Director of Wound Care and an Emergency Room Technician. He did all this before joining the Southeastern Spine Institute in 2003 as a Physician Assistant in Spine Surgery.\n\nFurthermore, Mr. Butler is affiliated with the East Cooper Regional Medical Center and with the Roper Hospital Systems.\n\nIt’s safe to say that Mr. Butler has spent some time in school. He’s earned two Associate degrees, two Bachelor degrees and a Master’s from the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC). The second Associate’s was for his Physical Therapist Assistant Studies degree.\n\nHe graduated Magna cum Laude at MUSC for his first Bachelor degree in Health Sciences. His second was for a Physician Assistant degree. His Master of Science Degree in Physician Assistant Studies (MSPAS) completes his education, for now."
