        "text": "By Kathleen Connors\n\nI have mentioned a number of times on Twitter that the 1978 Warren Beatty classic Heaven Can Wait is one of my all-time favorite movies. After giving it careful thought and consideration, I have decided to share the reason why.\n\nHeaven Can Wait features Beatty’s character, Joe Pendleton, a journeyman NFL quarterback who is finally named the Los Angeles Rams starting QB. Shortly after getting the great news, he sadly finds himself a victim of an untimely and accidental death. The remaining plot centers on Pendleton’s unlikely route to a second chance in life, which includes inhabiting the body of an eccentric millionaire CEO Leo Farnsworth. (Will avoid spoilers, beyond what is seen in the film’s trailer online).\n\nOne of the pivotal scenes in the movie occurs in the aftermath of Pendelton’s accident as he is seen next walking through clouds. He spots an airplane in the clouds and thinks he’s having an “airplane dream” when in fact he is on his way to Heaven. Pendelton is asked by the mysterious “Mr. Jordan” played brilliantly by James Mason, if he knows where he is — and is told “this is not a dream.”\n\nBeatty’s character proclaims in disbelief “I’m not supposed to be here.”\n\nMr. Jordan replies “but you are here.”\n\nHave you ever experienced a life altering challenge that made you feel that way?\n\nWhere do you go from there?\n\nThis is my story.\n\nI found myself in late August 2007 in unchartered territory, without a job. Until that point, my career in the sports industry had been the all-consuming, driving force in my adult life. My existence and sense of self-worth revolved entirely around my career. It wasn’t what I did, it was who I was. I was fortunate to enjoy steady, challenging and fulfilling employment. I had been lucky to travel the world working with some of the most recognizable people in sports. I worked hard and took tremendous pride in my work, even in a very challenging career situation at the agency where I was working. Being fired was professionally and personally devastating to me. I was completely shattered. I felt like a total failure.\n\nI did my best to move forward, trying to say the right things. I spent the next year interviewing for a series of sports industry positions. The job market and economy however, was becoming increasingly more challenging, heading into a slowdown that would result in an economic crash and the Great Recession. Then unfortunately in mid-October 2008 my grandmother had a stroke.\n\nThere was no way to know it at the time, but that drive from my Northern Virginia home to Central Pennsylvania to be by her side, started a journey that changed my life.\n\nThe theme of Heaven Can Wait on the most basic level is second chances. The bigger and deeper theme is when an individual is faced with setbacks or a crisis, being open and willing to take the unexpected route and make the most of the journey on your road back. The movie explores the possibility that perhaps while you are on this alternate path, that the journey can actually open up a dimension in your life that wouldn’t have existed otherwise.\n\nAs my grandmother’s health situation was being assessed it was clear she was going to need help in the short-term and there probably would be long-term ramifications for her ability to live independently. None of us in her immediate family, lived in, or near her hometown.\n\nI could write volumes about the sacrifices that my grandmother has made for her family — but simply stated she took care of everyone. She is the most loving, selfless and decent person I have ever known, constantly forsaking her needs for the care and concern of others. And even though she would rather die than ask “who is going to take care of me now?” I didn’t want her to spend one second pondering that question. She had physical obstacles to overcome, she didn’t need to add emotional ones.\n\nThe family matriarch and caretaker needed a caretaker — and it would be me.\n\nThere were times early on in the process, mostly lying awake at night in my grandmother’s home, I cried for the happy career memories that felt a million miles away — Olympics, Triple Crown bids & U.S. Opens and PGA Tour stops with the NBC Sports broadcast crew. It seemed like a career past that was increasingly distant and a life further away from my grasp. I was legitimately worried about my future. But I also knew that my grandmother and my family really needed my help and I owed it to them, especially my parents and the grandmother who never missed a chance to show her love and support for me.\n\nI suspended my search for full-time work and thanks to the encouragement from friend and colleague Patrick McGee, decided to formalize a consultancy which allowed me the freedom to continue to care for my grandmother. Consulting was not a full-time work commitment, it allowed me to work from remote locations, and it afforded me the opportunity to stay active in the sports industry.\n\nUpon completion of my grandmother’s outpatient recovery program, I started making bi-monthly trips, which then gradually phased into monthly trips to manage her household operations and personal matters, oversee her doctor’s appointments and coordinate her medical care. My uncle also made occasional trips to help her maintain her household and continue her independent living. She was also lucky to have extended family, friends and lovely neighbors checking in on her and helping with special needs and household tasks when we were not there.\n\nEven though caretaking represented a drastically different undertaking, I approached it as I have every new professional experience. I rolled up my sleeves and worked with the tools and knowledge I did have. I didn’t worry about the skills or experience that I may have lacked. I was confident I would adapt and would learn along the way.\n\nThe valuable assets she needed were time, energy and encouragement — which I could give her. The amazing thing was how much my background participating in athletics, recovering and rehabilitating from sports related injuries and surgeries, and working in our fast paced, high octane sports industry helped me. The skill she needed the most, and the one that came so naturally based on my professional background, was the need for a spokesperson. She required a person who could communicate effectively with the various constituents involved and when required — a gatekeeper, champion and fierce advocate to protect her best interests.\n\nMy mother is an extraordinary teacher whose professional life has been dedicated to mathematics education (my father’s career has as well). She is an amazing, pioneering woman and achiever of the highest order. As the situation progressed with my grandmother, I was sensitive to the idea that if I did not continue taking care of my grandmother, my mother who had worked so hard to achieve all that she had may have to retire early to care for her elderly mother. Having gone through the experience I had, I was not going to allow my mother to have to suspend or end a career on anyone’s terms but her own. (Unfortunately my father also required full-time care while recovering from aortic valve replacement surgery in November 2009. I supervised his care in Massachusetts as well, and thankfully he recovered fully.)\n\nAlthough I have enjoyed Warren Beatty’s movies, I had never seen Heaven Can Wait and it was incredibly helpful to see it during a difficult time. Watching Beatty’s character’s “out of body” experience that I described earlier was a total revelation. The character is fictional, but the emotions are real and it’s Warren Beatty on the screen so you just can’t stop looking. It’s written on his face, you see it in his eyes and you hear it in his voice — he’s lost, he’s confused, he’s vulnerable, he’s upset and he thinks his life is over.\n\nYou know THAT feeling and even despite the passage of time, it is beneath the surface gnawing away at you inside because you couldn’t and wouldn’t express it.\n\nAnd suddenly there it is right in front of you providing the vital moment of clarity and it was liberating. The rest of the film provided an emotional soft landing and an uplifting message for me — embrace the unconventional, unexpected route — it actually may take you where you need to go.\n\nI am a strong and resilient person and I realize I should have been able to handle losing my job better than I did. I knew that and told myself that often. I had handled adversity and setbacks well in the past, and that actually made me feel even MORE disappointed in myself. But this situation wasn’t that simple.\n\nThe reality is that many people including very successful ones are fired at some point in their careers. Experience is the best teacher and I have emerged from this period of my life wiser, more enlightened and equipped with valuable lessons and perspective.\n\nWhat I will always be proud of is that this caretaking work absolutely made a difference in someone’s life — a person who I love and admire dearly. My caregiving environment was devoid of the group of select but vocal colleagues or executives providing arbitrary analysis, self-serving commentary or subjective opinions, which unfortunately is a practice those of us who make a living in PR are frequently asked to endure. The work was challenging, the results were tangible and so was my grandmother’s overwhelming, freely expressed gratitude. It was the perfect antidote and just what I needed at that time.\n\nThe career sacrifices I made in the short term, helped prevent my mother and my uncle from having to make agonizing decisions. I am proud that I helped alleviate additional anguish from these people I love.\n\nMy grandmother’s health situation took a drastic turn for the worse in late March 2012. Suffering from the onset of congestive heart failure and a blocked aortic valve, she needed to have surgery to repair the damaged valve and insert a pacemaker. It became quite clear to us very early in the challenging and lengthy recovery process that independent living, which was so important to her, and that we worked diligently to preserve, was no longer a viable option.\n\nAt one point, during an excruciating night, after several days of suffering setbacks, my mother turned to me full of sadness and reluctance, and asked me to start writing my grandmother’s obituary.\n\nIt was the night before Mother’s Day.\n\nGrandma fought hard and started to recover very gradually, showing signs of making slow and steady progress. She was eventually discharged from the rehabilitation hospital and allowed to return to her home. My mother and I were exceedingly honest with her about her situation and her options based on the new reality she faced — she needed daily care and could no longer live alone. She courageously decided that it was best for her to move to Massachusetts to live with my parents. In six weeks, while continuing to manage her ongoing medical care, recovery and physical rehabilitation, we also readied her house for sale, packed and dispersed her belongings and transitioned her medical care and life to her new home.\n\nAs three generations of women prepared to walk out of my grandmother’s home together for the final time, my mother and I wiped tears away from our eyes, my grandmother held her head up high, dry eyed and with a smile. She knew she had been given another chance at life and she embraced the fresh start.\n\nI am an “old school” PR pro, I believe in promoting my clients and telling their stories. I prefer to work in the background and stay away from the spotlight. I decided to make an exception in this case because if I were advising me as a client, I would say it is worth overcoming my personal reservations and share my story.\n\nHere are the reasons:\n\nI thought sharing my experience may help someone in a tangible or even a tangential way.\n\n2. I want to express my respect and genuine admiration for the caregivers. Like Beatty’s stint as Leo Farnsworth, my caregiving was certain to be a “temporary arrangement”, but for so many who either do it as a profession or voluntarily for a loved one, family member or friend, it is a serious daily responsibility. I am eternally grateful for my caretaking & caregiving experience, but it is difficult and often physically and emotionally grueling work. If you know someone who is a caregiver or people who are elderly, disabled or infirmed — please try and lend a hand if you can. A modest commitment of time, energy and personal attention is more valuable and uplifting to them than you can possibly fathom.\n\n3. Elder Care is complicated. Be prepared. It’s a challenging matrix of complex issues that require careful consideration and tough decisions. The process is compounded if the immediate family are geographically distant. The most important duty is treating the elderly person with the dignity and respect they richly deserve, while calmly navigating the challenges and squarely confronting the realities and the choices. The process may involve philosophical differences, emotionally charged issues, gut wrenching and life altering decisions. Every situation is unique and different based on the individual’s medical and personal circumstances and the needs and choices of the family involved.\n\n4. My mother is now retired, and I have completed the full transition of my grandmother’s care to my parents. Everyone is settled and it is now time for me to resume my full-time professional career. I updated my resume to add my consulting work, which I have been grateful for and have truly enjoyed. The caregiving experience obviously is not listed. Let me be clear — I’m not implying it should be included, this was a personal choice. I realized however, that it would be helpful for me to explain my situation, since there actually may be some elements of the experience, the perspective and skills gained, that potentially would be regarded as valuable and desirable skill set in addition the professional acumen developed in 20 years of diverse sports industry PR work.\n\n5. Heaven Can Wait is a fantastic movie. Beatty produced, co-wrote, co-directed & starred in the film that earned nine Academy Award nominations. Beatty was nominated in all four categories he was eligible. If you saw Heaven Can Wait years ago — consider watching it again. If you haven’t seen it, I highly recommend it. Besides Beatty (and yes sports fans, an NFL team in Los Angeles!) it boasts an amazingly talented cast including Julie Christie, James Mason, Buck Henry, Charles Grodin, Dyan Cannon, Jack Warden and Vincent Gardenia. What I love about Heaven Can Wait, beyond what I have already discussed is its combination of humor, heart, and humanity.\n\n6. It is important to express my appreciation to those people that have helped, especially during difficult times.\n\n• I have so much to be grateful for, starting with my extraordinary parents who are a constant source of love, encouragement and support. I never take for granted that I hit the parental jackpot and how profoundly blessed and lucky I am to have my mother and father firmly in my corner.\n\n• I appreciate my clients and have enjoyed fulfilling and rewarding client-focused sports industry consulting work. I am also grateful for unique professional development opportunities including being asked by my former Professor and mentor Dr. Bill Sutton to author the PR Chapter in Sport Marketing (4th Edition).\n\n• As I mentioned before, my friend and trusted colleague Patrick McGee encouraged me to pursue consulting, something at the time I didn’t have the confidence to do. It proved to be an important choice, because it provided the ability to stay active in the sports industry while taking care of my family. Patrick has been a strategic partner, advocate of my work and I appreciate his advice and value his smart insight on our industry.\n\n• Frequent long car trips, extended hours sitting in doctor’s offices and hospital rooms, and the physical labor of caretaking aggravated and worsened chronic athletic injuries and joint issues. My friend Ron Laham, who has been a great athletic training and injury care resource to me over the years, evaluated my condition last summer, dedicated his time and provided his help and expertise to develop a rehabilitation and fitness program. The process has been gradual, the progress steady. I still have work to do on my fitness level, but I wake up, and walk up stairs pain free, which I haven’t been able to say for a long time.\n\n• It is not uncommon now to see actors who also direct, produce, write movies, but Warren Beatty solidified and advanced the opportunities and career possibilities for the multi-faceted Hollywood acting talent. In the spirit of appreciation that is mentioned in the title of this piece, it is important for me to salute not only Beatty’s singular cinematic achievement on Heaven Can Wait, but that this wonderfully smart and entertaining movie is emblematic of his larger filmmaking legacy.\n\nAs for Grandma, or as my father calls his beloved mother-in-law, “Our Sunshine”, every day is a gift filled with joy and gratitude. Her mind is sharp, but as could be expected, her health is delicate and at times precarious. She has a team of wonderful doctors and nurses who provide excellent treatment.\n\nShe enjoys the extraordinary daily care of a loving and devoted family. She is happy and peaceful. She thanks my father after every single meal he cooks for her, often adding adjectives like “delicious” or “awesome!” She is living with dignity and on her terms, which is what I hoped and prayed for when we started on this uncertain path. She proudly witnessed my mother being honored with a Distinguished Alumni Leadership Award at Seton Hill University (PA) and earning Professor Emerita status at Westfield State University (MA).\n\nShe celebrated her 94th birthday last fall.\n\nI continue to be in awe and am inspired by her infinite wisdom, uncommon grace, the love and kindness in her heart, the sparkle in her blue eyes, her positive attitude, and her deep reservoirs of courage, remarkable strength and indomitable spirit.\n\nI am humbled to be her granddaughter and have been honored to be her caretaker.\n\nThe unexpected route has proven to not only be the road leading to a second act in my life, but it has been a great joy and blessing. The experience has provided a loving and healing journey for my grandmother and quite frankly — for me too.\n\nI feel empowered, content and at peace with myself.\n\nOn May 10th, we celebrated Mother’s Day together.\n\nI understand the day will come eventually, but I still haven’t written my grandmother’s obituary.\n\nHeaven Can Wait."
