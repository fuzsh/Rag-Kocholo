        "text": "We have more \"icon\" threads about women, so let's have one about a guy obsessed with women: Warren Beatty, one of Hollywood's most infamous lotharios.\n\nBeatty, the brother of Shirley MacLaine, was born on March 30, 1937 and, according to his own script for HEAVEN CAN WAIT, will die on March 20, 2025.\n\nHe started out in DOBEY GILLIS, was engaged to Joan Collins, starred with Natalie Wood in SPLENDOR IN THE GRASS and appeared with Faye Dunaway in BONNIE AND CLYDE. He's done many others -- and some movies, too.\n\nAnd fans?\n\nI like Beatty, although I'd stop well short of calling myself a fan. Since his big breakout in BONNIE & CLYDE, he's worked with discretion making films that were mostly well crafted and entertaining (ISHTAR notably aside).\n\nI didn't bother with his most recent movie, RULES DON'T APPLY (2016) because the basic premise irked me. Beatty played Howard Hughes as owner of RKO Studios in 1958. I'm not sure how someone could go through the effort of writing a screenplay and producing a film without spending 30 seconds on Wikipedia to realize Hughes sold RKO in 1955.\n\nI always forget that Warren Beatty and Shirley MacLaine are siblings. Every time I read that somewhere, I have to do a quick Google search just to make sure someone hasn't pulled a fast one on me.\n\nAs an actor, I don't really know if I qualify as a fan of Beatty. I like him well enough in BONNIE & CLYDE -- he and Faye Dunaway make a good star-duo -- and I remember seeing him in SHAMPOO when TCM aired it a few years back. Oh, and I liked him starring as Vivien Leigh's handsomely young escort in THE ROMAN SPRING OF MRS. STONE.\n\nOther than that, I don't believe I've seen Beatty in anything else. From what I have seen, however, he seems to be a pretty good actor. I kind of wish he and Joan Collins would've worked out their kinks and married. For what reason, I don't necessarily know, but I guess I think it would've been \"neat\".\n\nAs a side note, my brother-in-law kind of reminds me of a young Warren Beatty.\n\nMcCABE AND MRS. MILLER was pretty good, but it's been forever since I've seen it. I downright like his \"small\" film with Elizabeth Taylor, George Stevens' Vegas-themed THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN (the interiors were shot in Paris!) where he is really excellent playing a down-and-out piano-player(who loses your sympathy once he starts smashing Taylor's grandmother's little treasures).\n\nAnd there's Alan Pakula's THE PARALLAX VIEW, a really good '70s political \"paranoia\" picture (like Redford's THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR) inspired by the increasing revelations coming forth at that time regarding CIA corruption of the most apocalyptic kind -- things we now have collectively forgotten, or shrug about, or, it would seem, even condone. (Spoiler alert: he's framed for murdering Jock Ewing). Made all the more unsettling by the way director Pakula later died in real life, in a bizarre manner consistent with the characters in some of his movies.\n\nClassyCo said:\n\nI kind of wish he and Joan Collins would've worked out their kinks\n\nJoan suggests their \"kinks\" were one thing they had little trouble working out."
