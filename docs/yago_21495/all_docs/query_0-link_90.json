        "text": "It’s Super Bowl week. There aren’t many films made about the NFL, let alone the Super Bowl. With that in mind, I had a mission in mind for this week’s Throwback Thursday — find a film about the Big Game.\n\nIt would have been too easy to pick something from the NFL Films archive, but those are typically half-hour highlight videos. While those are great, it wasn’t what I was looking for. A Google search gave me a pair of options — “Black Sunday” and “Heaven Can Wait.” Talk about two completely different films. “Black Sunday” is about a group of terrorists who plan to blow up the Orange Bowl on Super Bowl Sunday. “Heaven Can Wait” is a comedy-drama about a quarterback for the Super Bowl-bound Los Angeles Rams.\n\nI opted for “Heaven Can Wait.” I saw it many, many years ago and I remember it being a quality film.\n\nThe 1978 film stars Warren Beatty as Joe Pendleton, a backup quarterback for the Rams. Although Pendleton is a backup QB, things are looking up for him. He’s on the fast track to getting the starting job when an unfortunate chain of events takes place. While riding his bicycle through a tunnel, Joe’s guardian angel, known only as The Escort (Buck Henry), sees a large truck heading into the other end of the tunnel toward Joe. The Escort grabs Joe from his body early in the mistaken belief that Joe was about to be killed.\n\nOnce in the afterlife, Joe refuses to believe that his time was up. A man named Mr. Jordan (James Mason) investigates and discovers that Joe was going to just narrowly miss the truck and he was not destined to die until 2025! So, the Escort and Mr. Jordan shift gears to put Joe back in his body. However, it turns out that he was cremated, so a new body must be found for him.\n\nMr. Jordan persuades Joe to enter the body of a multi-millionaire, Leo Farnsworth. Farnsworth is near death after being drugged and drowned in his bathtub by his cheating wife, Julia (Dyan Cannon) and Farnsworth’s personal secretary, Tony Abbott (the late great Charles Grodin). Reluctantly, Joe jumps into Farnsworth’s body. Got all that?\n\nIt’s far-fetched for sure, but it’s a fun ride. As Farnsworth, Joe concocts a plan to get back on the Rams to fulfill his desire to be the starting quarterback. Since Farnsworth has no experience as an athlete, Joe decides to buy the Rams just to get a shot at playing QB. He enlists the help of a Rams assistant coach (Jack Warden) to train him. While he’s Farnsworth, he falls for activist Betty Logan (Julie Christie).\n\nAs for the football, there are some practice scenes and the film culminates with the Rams making it to the Super Bowl and they are playing the Pittsburgh Steelers. Fun fact: The Rams and Steelers play in the film, though the Super Bowl is not numbered. The film was made in 1978 and the Steelers and Rams would meet in Super Bowl XIV just two years later! I was fascinated watching the football scene as the NFL allowed the filmmakers to use the official uniforms and helmets, but all of the names on the jerseys were different. I’m still not sure why that is. I did a deep dive, but still couldn’t find any answers. Also of note, in the film, the Steelers wore white jerseys. In their actual Super Bowl with the Rams, they wore black jerseys.\n\n“Heaven Can Wait” earned several Academy Award nominations, but won just one — art direction. Beatty, Warden and Cannon all scored nominations. It is rated PG for some adult language, themes and mild violence.\n\nYou can watch “Heaven Can Wait” on Xfinity OnDemand, Prime Video, VUDU and Apple TV.\n\n— — — —\n\nChris Morelli is the news editor of The Express."
