        "text": "AND then there's the one about Joe Pendleton, the saxophone-playing pugilist, who dies prematurely (by 60 years) and, it turns out, erroneously. Somewhere outside heaven, the mistake is discovered. Having already been cremated, the boxer is escorted back to earth in search of another body.\n\nThe tall tale may be best remembered in its most popular guise, a 1941 film, ''Here Comes Mr. Jordan,'' or as the slick 1978 remake, ''Heaven Can Wait,'' in which the bodyless soul belonged to a fighter, not a football player, and was played by Warren Beatty.\n\nNow, the George Street Playhouse has resuscitated, through June 18, the original 1938 stage version by Harry Segall, which, one learns, was first called ''It Was Like This,'' but was later retitled, more familiarly, ''Heaven Can Wait.'' By any name, this is a charmless affair that never transports one out of its own internal illogic, and into some fanciful, validating realm.\n\nAs if he were taking the cue from such recent successful escapist re-creations of the 1930's as ''You Can't Take It With You'' and ''Anything Goes,'' the director Gregory S. Hurst may have wished to take flight into a time warp on gossamer wings, when innocence and love were all. But the director has no consistency of vision. The Cole Porter songs played throughout serve as superimpositions, being sophisticatedly beside the point. From the first ominous scene, in which smoke overtakes the stage and two of the newly dead ''passengers'' are seen grimly and motionlessly waiting to get into heaven, there is more foggy pretension than pure pleasure in the air.\n\nEven when the action shifts to a Rhode Island mansion, a handsomely appointed Art Deco set by Atkin Pace, Mr. Hurst's lugubrious staging, besides Mr. Segall's script, may be the production's most fatal flaw. Among the most dubious accomplishments of ''Heaven Can Wait'' is its transformation of fatality into a matter of degree.\n\nStriking another, if lesser, death blow is William Cain's pompous performance as the considerably less than celestial agent, Mr. Jordan. Only actors with an extraterrestrial air and a sly wit can handle such a potentially winning assignment. In Mr. Cain's dull delivery, Mr. Jordan's platitudinous phrases, about destiny, perfect balance and mankind's place in the sun, reassure us only about one thing: We don't want to hear it.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
