        "text": "A FEW years ago, soon after the premiere of his first comedy special on HBO -- the special that in short order would get him an Emmy and a book deal and propel him into his Emmy-winning talk show -- Chris Rock was offered the chance to star in a movie about a busload of touring rappers. It would have paid him a pile of money, he recalls, but he said no.\n\n''Do something you can only do when you're hot,'' Mr. Rock remembers telling himself. ''A movie about a busload of rappers? I can do that when I'm ice cold! I can do the rapping bus movie when I'm on my last leg!''\n\nAbout the same time, Warren Beatty, who was working on his movie ''Bulworth,'' invited Mr. Rock to lunch. ''A good guy,'' Mr. Rock recalls, ''a cool guy. I liked his views. But I didn't know his whole legend, like I do now. To me he was a guy who did 'Dick Tracy' and 'Bugsy.' I even argued with him about women!''\n\nNonetheless, Mr. Rock was sufficiently impressed that he rented some of Mr. Beatty's films. ''When I saw 'Heaven Can Wait,' I lit up. I said, 'Man, Richard Pryor should've done this!' ''\n\nInstead, Chris Rock did. ''Down to Earth,'' which opens on Friday, is a remake of Mr. Beatty's ''Heaven Can Wait,'' (a 1978 comedy that is itself a remake of ''Here Comes Mr. Jordan,'' a 1941 film starring Robert Montgomery). Mr. Beatty was a co-director, with Buck Henry; a co-writer, with Elaine May; and a co-star, with Julie Christie. He plays a quarterback for the Los Angeles Rams who dies before his appointed time and who, in heavenly compensation, is returned to earth in the body of a multimillionaire (before it could be taken for granted that professional football players were millionaires).\n\n''Three of the writers from my show and I watched it,'' Mr. Rock says, over a recent breakfast in Manhattan, ''and we went, 'Aw, yeah, we can annihilate this!' We thought it would be a way better movie if he was a loser, and a way better movie if he was black. Not to say this is a better movie, but me in a mansion doing things is funnier than Warren Beatty in a mansion, where you think he kind of lives anyway.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
