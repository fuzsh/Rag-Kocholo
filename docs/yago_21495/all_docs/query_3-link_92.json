To correct the wrong, there is an attempt to return Joe to his body. Unfortunately, he has no body to return to, since his manager has already had him cremated!\n\nHilarity, confusion and a little bit of romance ensue as Joe and Mr. Jordan's search for a new body and a second chance at life.\n\nInspiring the movie Here Comes Mr. Jordan and an adaptation starring Warren Beatty, Heaven Can Wait, presented by The Masquers will be the perfect night out!"
