        "text": "The second film adaptation of Harry Segall’s play of the same name, Heaven Can Wait is a fantasy-comedy about a young man (played by Beatty) being mistakenly taken to heaven by his guardian angel. Beatty sought out May for her writing expertise, and she earned her first Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay for this project. “[The film] has everything going for it: big laughs, populist politics, billowy sequences set in heaven, a murder plot, a climactic Super Bowl game, a supporting cast of choice comic actors, and best of all, a touching (but PG) romance” (Frank Rich, Time)."
