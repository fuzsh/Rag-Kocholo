        "text": "I watched the 2013 NBA Draft at a bar in Bowling Green, OH — the television muted, the tables around me intermittently peppered by Cavaliers fans. I still remember the confusion in the room when Cleveland chose Anthony Bennett over every other option, but as time went by I started wondering if I was remembering too much confusion — if the way we talk about the Bennett choice now is the same as it was talked about at the time.\n\nSo many attempts to revisit the drafts of the past do so by redrafting — saying what teams should have done if they’d been given a do-over. But those things don’t interest me very much because they’re rooted in so much unreality — there isn’t a universe where the Cavaliers actually would have picked Giannis and it doesn’t do much good to write an article about what would have happened if they had. It can be useful, though, to discuss what would have happened in logical scenarios — say the 2003 Pistons take Carmelo Anthony over Darko, since that was actually a possibility.\n\nSo, I’m re-watching the draft. I want to put myself as “in the moment” as possible, so I’m going to try pausing as little as possible and not do much research aside from quick looks at Basketball Reference. I’m also not going to pretend teams would have done wildly divergent things.\n\nOkay. Let’s relive this thing. Anything in parentheses was added after I watched.\n\nThe Draft\n\nI completely forgot this was the last David Stern-era NBA Draft. All these boos! I miss it.\n\n1. Cleveland Cavaliers- Anthony Bennett\n\nCleveland is on the clock. Knowing what’s going to happen here makes a lot of this build-up feel sad, though I guess Bennett was a piece of the Love trade so it isn’t the worst thing for Cleveland.\n\nJalen wants Noel. Bill wants Oladipo. They’re trying to trade the pick but no one wants it. Jay is mentioning Alex Len and Ben McLemore. None of these names are very exciting four years later, but they all feel like upgrades over what’s about to happen. No mentions from the crew yet of Bennett.\n\nBill Simmons drops the “Cavs could get LeBron” line. OOH. HE KNOWS.\n\nI think we’re forgetting already how shocking this Anthony Bennett pick was. No one on the ESPN crew even thought about him. They are literally shocked and not sure what to say. Bill does not have words right now.\n\nThis was the kind of bad pick that would have gone down as even worse historically if LeBron didn’t erase the mistake by signing with Cleveland.\n\nShane Battier: “Jabbar. Magic. LeBron. Bennett. How does that sound?” *Sigh.*\n\nI feel like Bennett could have been successful in an earlier version of the NBA — one where he could take advantage of his size and his inconsistent shooting wouldn’t hurt his stock as much. Instead, Bennett regressed as a three-point shooter and he never was able to carve out playing time in the league.\n\n(I’m an expert on Bennett because I spent a lot of time trying to use him at PF in NBA 2k14. I’d always have to trade him when his constant barrage of missed threes became too much. Doing this article encouraged me to try again with Bennett and I’m playing him as a small-ball center. It’s actually sort-of working!)\n\n2. Orlando Magic- Victor Oladipo\n\nOh yeah, the Magic are on the clock. All the discussions about Bennett made the crew forget about that.\n\nOrlando makes this pick very fast. They really wanted Oladipo so they could eventually trade him to the Thunder for a half season of Serge Ibaka.\n\n“He’s now making wide-open jump shots,” says Jay Bilas. This was such a rough draft — the number two pick was being lauded for learning to make wide-open shots.\n\nI like Oladipo. I still think he can be a good player for the Pacers this season. But to think that he was the probably the player who was projected to make the biggest early impact in this draft class — man, rough draft.\n\n3. Washington Wizards- Otto Porter Jr.\n\nPorter’s name was only mentioned once before he was picked here, but his selection was not at all the shock that Bennett was. Porter is a good player and still playing for the team that picked him, so it probably isn’t an exciting one to write much about.\n\nBill is a little surprised because he thought Noel would go here. Good choice by Washington to pass on him. Jay loves this pick.\n\nI forgot about the Wizards trying to start Emeka Okafor and Nene together.\n\n4. Charlotte Bobcats- Cody Zeller\n\nThey are going to be shocked Zeller went over Noel. They are definitely going to be shocked. Bill is calling Noel to Charlotte.\n\nAnd the pick is in and there is a long silence from the ESPN crew.\n\nBy the way, I forgot how bad the Bobcats logo was.\n\n(Hindsight is interesting. Noel was the right pick in 2013 — there was a risk to taking him, but the Bobcats needed to take that risk. Four years later, Zeller seems like he was probably the right pick for the team. Four years from now? I’d be willing to go out on a limb and say that Noel will end up with a better career than Zeller. It’s weird, isn’t it?)\n\n5. Phoenix Suns- Alex Len\n\nThey went to commercial by asking if Phoenix would take Noel. The only time Phoenix taking Len was mentioned was earlier when they proposed the Cavs take Noel then trade him to Phoenix if the Suns took Len.\n\nThe ESPNers sound bored by this pick, though they might just be bored by this whole draft at this point.\n\nJay’s basically saying that Alex Len is almost as good as Nerlens Noel. Not so sure about that — I actually would have loved to see Noel in Phoenix. I know all the talk about the Suns having a great training staff is a little overblown, but maybe there’s some truth to it?\n\n6. New Orleans Pelicans- Nerlens Noel\n\nSo much hype here for a player who ended up not playing at the level that everyone seemed to think he’d play at. Not that he can’t — I think he’ll do fine with Dallas this season, as long as they actually re-sign him.\n\nAnyway, back to the draft: David Stern just said “The New Orleans Pelicans — yes, the New Orleans Pelicans select,” which I already knew was going to happen because he says it the same way in 2k14. It’s a fun little moment that reminds fans at home that there actually is a team called the Pelicans. It’s much less fun to hear on the video game.\n\nOkay, Noel goes here. He won’t stay in New Orleans, though I can’t remember when that gets announced so I’m betting we get to listen to the crew discuss his fit with Anthony Davis. Simmons expects Noel to stay in New Orleans and so does Jalen and OMG THEY JUST DISCUSSED WHAT THE PELICANS WILL DO WITH RYAN ANDERSON BECAUSE HE MAKES SO MUCH MONEY THINGS NEVER CHANGE THEY NEVER CHANGE.\n\nSad to watch Noel tell Shane Battier how excited he was to play with Anthony Davis. I would have loved to see that combo even if it would have been a spacing nightmare.\n\n7. Sacramento Kings- Ben McLemore\n\nJay Bilas has spent the whole night talking about McLemore and he finally goes here. This is a kid who I was really high on at the time. I was with Bilas — WAIT TIMEOUT BILL SIMMONS JUST SAID THE KINGS NEW OWNERSHIP WAS GOING TO MAKE THEM A STABLE TEAM HA HA HA HA HA.\n\nSorry. McLemore. I was with Bilas on McLemore having the highest ceiling. I thought he’d end up as a really good offensive player, somewhere near twenty points-per-game. I think he can be valuable this season with the Grizzlies as a shooter off the bench, but he never put it all together.\n\n8. Detroit Pistons- Kentavious Caldwell-Pope\n\nESPN seems pretty convinced that Trey Burke is going to Detroit.\n\nAlright, here is the Noel trade — the 76ers begin “The Process” by sending Jrue Holiday to New Orleans.\n\nCaldwell-Pope is announced and the camera pans to a dejected Trey Burke.\n\nThey ended the discussion of Caldwell-Pope early so they could interview Rob Hennigan about the Oladipo pick. The interview looks like something off the local news in a very small city. Hennigan just doesn’t look comfortable up there.\n\n9. Minnesota Timberwolves- Trey Burke\n\nMaking a David Kahn reference right before Burke gets picked. Feels like the ESPN guys are going to expect a trade here.\n\nThey do expect a trade. They are all adamant that he is going to get traded, though they seem to think he’ll be going to the 76ers right now. That would have been interesting to see — would Burke have ended up as the Rookie of the Year instead of Carter-Williams? Could he have stuck longer in the league on a team with the patience of the Hinkie-era 76ers?\n\nReally awkward interview with Burke’s mom where she is immediately asked about trade rumors. I’m not sure that’s the best approach.\n\nI am totally here for these Trey Burke/ Jared Sullinger BFF pictures.\n\n10. Portland Trail Blazers- C.J. McCollum\n\nRece Davis seems to think McCollum is getting traded because he doesn’t fit with Damian Lillard. I can understand his thought process with that, but I’m glad it didn’t happen. As much as I dislike Portland because of that whole “Lillard Shot Over Parsons” in the Rockets/Blazers series, I think Lillard/McCollum is such an exciting back court.\n\n11. Philadelphia 76ers- Michael Carter-Williams\n\nI’m pretty sure the ESPN crew thinks this pick was also traded to New Orleans — it might be why they seemed hesitant about the Holiday/Noel trade, because they thought this pick went to the Pelicans.\n\nMy wife is a big Syracuse fan and was really hyped about Carter-Williams. He looked good his rookie season, but it isn’t great that he never really developed his shot. If you can only make a quarter of your threes, you aren’t going to be a starting point guard in the league, though he can still give you some decent minutes off the bench as a ball handler.\n\n12. Oklahoma City Thunder- Steven Adams\n\nIt’s time for the crew to remember the Harden trade. That trade wasn’t great for Oklahoma City, but Lamb — who had just been drafted in the first round — and two more first rounders and Kevin Martin is actually not terrible when you look at how trades for stars have gone down in 2017, right?\n\nDavid Stern mispronounced Adam’s hometown.\n\nAnd we’re back to discussing the Harden trade. I wish there was a time machine available so we could show 2013 Bill Simmons what the Cousins trade and the Paul George trades looked like. Sure, neither player is as good as Harden, but it’s still interesting to think about.\n\n13. Dallas Mavericks- Kelly Olynyk\n\nMavericks are trying very hard to move this pick for cap space in order to pursue Dwight Howard or Chris Paul. I forget how much attention Dwight to Dallas was getting in 2013. I think one of the more intriguing things about looking back at this Draft is remembering all the things that didn’t actually happen.\n\nOlynyk to the Celtics happened really fast. I wonder if ESPN was able to out-scoop Twitter on it? What year did Twitter start to beat the networks at reporting draft picks?\n\n(Now that I think of it, I’m pretty sure I was using Twitter during this draft to make up for the bar not having the sound on.)\n\n14. Utah Jazz- Shabazz Muhammad\n\nEven though the Jazz are making this pick, it’s already been announced they’re making it for the Timberwolves.\n\nAnother thing I forgot: the Muhammad age controversy. As I wrote elsewhere on this site, I still think Muhammad has a place in this league, but he had so much hype when he was coming out of high school and the way his stock went down after his time at UCLA is tough to watch.\n\nNot sure why, but the crowd just erupted with boos and David Stern wasn’t even on the stage.\n\nSimmons would rather have Trey Burke. Really, though, this trade didn’t work out for either team.\n\nThe lottery is over. Normally I’d quit doing this article right now, but let’s hold on for one more pick, since that pick is:\n\n15. Milwaukee Bucks- Giannis Antetokounmpo\n\nHere we are. The best player in the 2013 NBA Draft. A name that hasn’t been mentioned during this broadcast. The whole NBA crew talking pessimistically about how there probably aren’t any gems left to pick.\n\nAlright. Stern made the pick and Rece Davis immediately uses the phrase “unlimited potential.” Fran Fraschilla called him the “most mysterious player” in this entire draft. The videos they are showing look exciting. Fraschilla is just gushing right now about Antetokounmpo’s future. This is one of the first times in this entire draft where it really sounded like everyone was excited for the pick.\n\nRECAP\n\nI don’t think it’s going to be very interesting to watch on from this point — Gobert at 27 is really the main highlight.\n\nThis draft has gone down historically as a bad draft and after re-watching it — it was pretty rough. A lot of lottery picks who didn’t do much — the best lottery pick ended up being either Otto Porter or C.J. McCollum. This wasn’t a draft that produced stars (aside from Giannis and Gobert) and it wasn’t even really a draft that produced starters.\n\nLet’s look at Basketball Reference’s list of players in this draft class ranked by career win shares:\n\nThis draft was pretty wild in terms of where the best players came from. If we’re looking strictly at win shares — which, yes, doesn’t give us the full picture, we’d see that Cody Zeller was the best player picked in the top ten. Looking at the Box Plus/Minus says Porter and Noel are better, and looking at real life says that McCollum has been fine, but overall it isn’t a great picture.\n\nI think it’s safe to conclude that the 2013 NBA Draft is very much how we remember it — a draft filled with failed lottery picks and chaos and Anthony Bennett was exactly as shocking a pick as we thought it was."
