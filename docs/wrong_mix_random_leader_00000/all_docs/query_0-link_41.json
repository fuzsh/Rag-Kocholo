        "text": "Previously when it came to property rights, only men were accorded ownership rights over landed properties. With the passage of the Married Women’s Property Act the rights of married women to possess their own private property became a reality. With the enactment of the Married Women’s Property Act, women in the western region were treated better when compared to those in the non western region. Irrespective of this development, discriminatory and harmful cultural practices which subjugate the rights of women still persist in some part of Nigeria because of the nature of the society which is patriarchy in nature. It is without doubt that an effective means of transferring economic, social and political power in most societies is through succession and inheritance. Unfortunately, the Igbo customs like some of its counterpart discriminate against women though the situation has improved tremendously with the current judicial reforms. At the root of this unequal treatment of women are traditional and cultural beliefs and practices. Continuation of discriminatory practices has led to wider gap between men and women and the increase in poverty among women. It is against this background, that this dissertation seeks to critically analysis the current position of women’s inheritance rights under the laws in Nigeria. This critical analysis helped to explore the inheritance rights of women under Igbo custom, the effectiveness of the various legal framework protecting the rights of women to property in Nigeria , a detailed insight into the various rights that accrued to women under the statutes and Igbo custom with respect to their inheritance and exposure of the challenges that still constitute a stumbling block to the full realization of women’s right to property. The findings of this dissertation are that; despite legislative restriction and judicial pronouncements on discriminatory customary practices, the fact still remains that these discriminatory customs and norms still exist in some selected regions because of an established patterns of male superiority and segregated societal patterns of behavior; most of the legislative instruments have customary law intrusion in them, and illiteracy have hindered the women affected from knowing existing statutory laws and judicial activism that have began to change the discriminatory nature of custom. This paper concluded that with the current judicial reforms, the inheritance rights of women have greatly improved. The recommendation of this paper included among others that there is still need to involve traditional rulers and chiefs in customary law reform on inheritance since they are custodians of people’s culture, promotion of will making, consistency in the judicial activism by the court, need for sensitization and enlightenment programme to include both rural and urban regions and translation of inheritance laws into dialects and other indigenous language.\n\n1 The sudden demise of a man calls to question the manner of distributing his properties as well as succeeding to his offices of dignities and honour after his death. The position of the wives and children of the deceased are even more critical. Which of the properties of the deceased should go to the wives or the children in the face of a strong claim for them by the deceased's siblings and relatives? Will the wives and children continue to live in abject poverty after the demise of their husband and father? Will they continue to suffer in silence for the rest of their lives? These and similar other posers should be unraveled. This study, therefore, examines the distribution of the wealth of a deceased person among his survivors with a view to maintaining equity and justice and in order to avoid unnecessary acrimony among the relatives.\n\nEsan Native Law and Customs like any other customary laws in Nigeria is recognised as law that regulated the customary aspect of the people subject to its jurisdiction. One of such aspect, is succession and inheritance rights. Although, Esan customary law has from time immemorial made adequate and sufficient rules that regulate and govern succession rights, recently these rules have come under vigorous legal scrutiny concerning their applicability vis-à-vis the enforcement of fundamental rights of citizens that are constitutionally guaranteed. This article therefore seeks to examine critically the application of Esan Native Law and Customs regulating succession and inheritance rights in general, identify its deficiencies and advocate for sustainable ways to harmonise them by making them to conform with the current state of the law dealing with the enforcement of fundamental rights of citizens. This approach has become imperative in other to prevent certain aspect of Esan Native law and customs dealing with succession rights from being adjudged repugnant to natural justice equity and good conscience.\n\nNigeria as a heterogeneous society obviously does not have a customary law governing the behaviour and activities of the citizens as they relate with one another in their daily lives. They differ in every respect both in custom, traditions, beliefs; norms etc. succession to family property under customary law is one such area deserving attention for research. The scope of this dissertation is limited to selected customary laws guiding the selected ethnic groups in Ibo, Rivers, Efik/Qua and Islamic (the North) customs. The doctrinal method was adopted in this paper. The paper found that in respect of Igbo, Benin and Yoruba customary laws of inheritance reveals that there are local variations to the general rule of inheritance of the customary laws of these ethnic groups that women as wives and daughters are not entitled to inherit the property of their deceased husbands and fathers. The paper concluded that any customary law rule of a people perceived to be repugnant to natural justice, equity and good conscience or against the provisions of the constitution or any other law in force should not be applicable. Thus, it is recommended that the time is overdue for the legislature to enact a uniform legislation on laws of interstate succession that will be applicable throughout the federation or each state enacting their own laws. This will enable reduce the variations among the indigenes of the same region while catering for certainty and easy administration of such laws."
