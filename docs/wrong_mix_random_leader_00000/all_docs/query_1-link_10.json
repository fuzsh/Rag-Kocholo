        "text": "Real estate development is a significant factor in shaping the built environment. It shapes the way people live and work, and by doing so determines and enables human activity and its evolution. Around the globe, real estate development forms a contemporary reflection of societal needs and the market demand in particular geographies. Nonetheless, due to globalization we increasingly witness similar needs and demands for space despite institutional differences existing between countries and cities. Within each context real estate development is concerned with innovations, such as introducing new forms of development finance, setting up new types of development partnerships, or incorporating sustainable solutions within development processes. As such, the practice and science of real estate development are subject to constant change, reflected in a diversity of topics that are addressed in both academic publications and professional practice. As an applied and practice-oriented scienc...\n\nThe 34th annual congress of April 10-14 this year took place in Bonita Springs (Florida) where the professionals in real-estate education and research discussed six themes: global economy and capital flows, real estate market cycles, demographic effects, future-proof real estate, disruption in technology and future educational models. The six themes of this congress were the result of the more than 120 participants who participated in the Critical Issues Seminar in Coronado, San Diego last year. As with the previous nine years of these ARES meetings, the central goal of the meeting is to focus on education and research strategies and action plans that can close the gap between the real estate profession and the academic world. This makes real estate education and research more relevant and better utilized within the various professional and academic sectors of the real estate economy. The large variety of the many panels that took place included many different perspectives in 105 sub-sessions. The influence of technology on the valuation of real estate is also presented in various themes. The impact of technological changes on real estate and the real estate sector is considerable. Proptech is developing very fast, but can this be expressed in a valuation of real estate as we can and should do with sustainability? Big data too-we have a lot of data, but do we know how to ask the right question to make this data accessible? – will influence the potential impact on demand, supply and financing. All questions that the Congress tries to answer with many researches. In seven presentations of research into the digitization of real estate and its influence on the development of real estate, two of the 105 sessions presented, explained and commented with approximately 500 participants: (1) Technology &Housing Dynamics and (2) Big Data & Urban Dynamics:\n\nof this paper is based on the relevant facts which are the key factors for increase the economic range in the Building trade market and Real estate sector in Kosovo which is depend and connect with Laws and dispositions rules from the European Union in Energy sector.

Global economic growth came to an abrupt halt, as a result of the effects of the pandemic on social and economic activities-countries around the world have implemented changes to real estate policies in order to reduce the effects of the lockdown on the citizens who are tenants and, in some cases, landlords. In the United States, many decisions are made at the state and local levels to prohibit eviction of tenants. Many countries are considering legislations that would protect tenants who cannot pay rent for a period of six months. Due to this global lockdown resulting from the pandemic, Nigeria is currently facing financial crisis which has directly/indirectly affected all sectors of human endeavor including the real estate sector of the economy. In all, the usual way of life and work system is changing and some of the upcoming trends will become part of the 'new normal' in the Nigerian real estate sector. The researchers used survey method in obtaining data by distributing questionnaires to respondents. Data collected were collated and analyzed using table, simple percentage and mean. Findings reveal that the outbreak has had an adverse effect on many tenants' ability to pay rents and have also led to a decrease in investment yield for residential and commercial real estate as a result of the economic \"lockdown\" in the country. The study suggests that, although all forms of real estate investment produce viable returns, it will be a wise investment decision to capitalize on the agricultural real estate sector during this pandemic as well as the post-COVID era. It also recommends that the Nigerian government should create an enabling environment to encourage investors, by coming up with policies that will help ease the effect of the pandemic on real estate investment."
