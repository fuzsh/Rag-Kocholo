We examined clinicians' recommendations of the copper IUD for emergency contraception in a setting with few cost obstacles. We conducted a survey among clinicians (n=1,246; response rate 65%) in a California State family planning program, where U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved contraceptives are available at no cost to low-income women. We used multivariable logistic regression to measure the association of intrauterine contraceptive training and evidence-based knowledge with having recommended the copper IUD for emergency contraception. The large majority of clinicians (85%) never recommended the copper IUD for emergency contraception, and most (93%) required two or more visits for an IUD insertion. Multivariable analyses showed insertion skills were associated with having recommended the copper IUD for emergency contraception, but the most significant factor was evidence-based knowledge of patient selection for IUD use. Clinicians who viewed a wide range of patients as IUD candidates were twice as likely to have recommended the copper IUD for emergency contraception. Although more than 93% of obstetrician-gynecologists were skilled in inserting the copper IUD, they were no more likely to have recommended it for emergency contraception than other physicians or advance practice clinicians. Recommendation of the copper IUD for emergency contraception is rare, despite its high efficacy and long-lasting contraceptive benefits. Recommendation would require clinic flow and scheduling adjustments to allow same-day IUD insertions. Patient-centered and high-quality care for emergency contraception should include a discussion of the most effective method. III.\n\nActinomyces-like organisms in cervical smears from women using intrauterine contraceptive devices.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDuguid, H L; Parratt, D; Traynor, R\n\n1980-01-01\n\nCervical smears from 293 users of intrauterine contraceptive devices attending family planning clinics in East Fife, Dundee, and Angus were stained by Papanicolaou and Gram's methods and examined for actinomyces-like organisms. Of the 128 women using plastic devices, 40 gave smears positive for these organisms. In contrast only two positive smears were obtained from the 165 women using devices containing copper and none from a control group of 300 women taking oral contraceptives. Colonisation was more common in women whose plastic devices had been in situ for over two years. Correlations between the presence of these organisms and recorded incidences of pain and both clinical and cytological evidence of inflammation of the lower genital tract were highly significant (p = 0.00001, p < 0.00001, and p < 0.00001 respectively). The results suggest that plastic intrauterine contraceptive devices predispose to colonisation by actinomyces-like organisms, particularly after long-term use. Hence if the apparently bacteriostatic action of copper devices is confirmed these should probably be more widely used.

Newer long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods such as intrauterine devices and subcutaneous implants are preferred because they do not depend on patient compliance. They are highly effective and appropriate for most women. Female and male sterilization are other effective but they are irreversible and require counseling to minimize regret. The contraceptive injection, patch, and ring do not require daily administration, but their typical efficacy rates are lower than LARC methods and similar to those for combined oral contraceptive pills.

Although lowering unintended pregnancy rates requires multiple approaches, individual obstetrician-gynecologists may contribute by increasing access to contraceptive implants and intrauterine devices. Obstetrician-gynecologists should encourage consideration of implants and intrauterine devices for all appropriate candidates, including nulliparous women and adolescents. Obstetrician-gynecologists should adopt best practices for long-acting reversible contraception insertion. Obstetrician-gynecologists are encouraged to advocate for coverage and appropriate payment and reimbursement for every contraceptive method by all payers in all clinically appropriate circumstances.\n\nTraining contraceptive providers to offer intrauterine devices and implants in contraceptive care: a cluster randomized trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nThompson, Kirsten M J; Rocca, Corinne H; Stern, Lisa; Morfesis, Johanna; Goodman, Suzan; Steinauer, Jody; Harper, Cynthia C\n\n2018-06-01\n\nUS unintended pregnancy rates remain high, and contraceptive providers are not universally trained to offer intrauterine devices and implants to women who wish to use these methods. We sought to measure the impact of a provider training intervention on integration of intrauterine devices and implants into contraceptive care. We measured the impact of a continuing medical education-accredited provider training intervention on provider attitudes, knowledge, and practices in a cluster randomized trial in 40 US health centers from 2011 through 2013. Twenty clinics were randomly assigned to the intervention arm; 20 offered routine care. Clinic staff participated in baseline and 1-year surveys assessing intrauterine device and implant knowledge, attitudes, and practices. We used a difference-in-differences approach to compare changes that occurred in the intervention sites to changes in the control sites 1 year later. Prespecified outcome measures included: knowledge of patient eligibility for intrauterine devices and implants; attitudes about method safety; and counseling practices. We used multivariable regression with generalized estimating equations to account for clustering by clinic to examine intervention effects on provider outcomes 1 year later. Overall, we surveyed 576 clinic staff (314 intervention, 262 control) at baseline and/or 1-year follow-up. The change in proportion of providers who believed that the intrauterine device was safe was greater in intervention (60% at baseline to 76% at follow-up) than control sites (66% at both times) (adjusted odds ratio, 2.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-5.4). Likewise, for the implant, the proportion increased from 57-77% in intervention, compared to 61-65% in control sites (adjusted odds ratio, 2.57; 95% confidence interval, 1.44-4.59). The proportion of providers who believed they were experienced to counsel on intrauterine devices also increased in intervention (53-67%) and remained the same in control sites (60\n\nThe copper-7 intrauterine contraceptive device: 5-year evaluation.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSellors, J. W.\n\n1981-01-01\n\nOver a 5-year period a family practitioner inserted copper-7 (Cu-7 intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUDs) in 134 women. The rates of continued use after 2 years, 53.0% for the women's first IUD and 63.9% for all their IUDs, and of accidental pregnancy, 2.4%, are comparable to those in the literature. However, in this series the rate of expulsion was 0.8%, much lower than that in the literature. Fertility did not appear to be reduced in women who planned to have pregnancies after the device was removed. A carefully scrutinized technique of insertion and conscientious follow-up make the Cu-7 IUD an acceptable form of contraception for many patients in a family practice. PMID:7326653\n\nIntra-uterine contraceptive devices.\n\nPubMed\n\nElias, J\n\n1985-05-01\n\nAmong the advantages of IUDs are the device's high continuation rate, the lack of systemic side effects, and the absence of a need for continual motivation to practice contraception. The effectiveness of plastic IUDs is directly proportional to their surface area, but the degree of excessive bleeding experienced is inversely related to device size. Thus, devices represent a compromise between large size for effectiveness and small size for acceptability. The optimum time to fit an IUD is during the 1st hald of the menstrual cycle. Absolute contraindications to IUD use include the presence of active pelvic inflammatory disease, undiagnosed irregular bleeding, a history of ectopic pregnancy or tubal surgery, and a distorted uteine cavity. Failure rates associated with IUD use range from 2-3% in the 1st year and then decrease. Since the main mechanism of action appears to be production of a sterile inflammatory reaction in the uterine cavity, the IUD prevents intrauterine pregnancy more effectively than ectopic pregnancy. Nonetheless, there is little evidence to suggest that IUD use actually increases the incidence of ectopic pregnancy. Resumption of fertility after IUD removal is not delayed. There is not need to change inert plastic IUDs in women who remain symptom free. The copper devices should be changed every 3-4 years. A search is under way for antifertility agents that can be incorporated into the device to reduce side effects. In general, the IUD is most suitable for older, parous women.\n\nNon-contraceptive benefits of hormonal and intrauterine reversible contraceptive methods.\n\nPubMed\n\nBahamondes, Luis; Valeria Bahamondes, M; Shulman, Lee P\n\n2015-01-01\n\nMost contraceptive methods present benefits beyond contraception; however, despite a large body of evidence, many healthcare professionals (HCPs), users and potential users are unaware of those benefits. This review evaluates the evidence for non-contraceptive benefits of hormonal and non-hormonal contraceptive methods. We searched the medical publications in PubMed, POPLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE and LILACS for relevant articles, on non-contraceptive benefits of the use of hormonal and intrauterine reversible contraceptive methods, which were published in English between 1980 and July 2014. Articles were identified using the following search terms: 'contraceptive methods', 'benefits', 'cancer', 'anaemia', 'heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB)', 'endometrial hyperplasia', 'endometriosis' and 'leiomyoma'. We identified, through the literature search, evidence that some combined oral contraceptives have benefits in controlling HMB and anaemia, reducing the rate of endometrial, ovarian and colorectal cancer and ectopic pregnancy as well as alleviating symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Furthermore, the use of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system also controls HMB and anaemia and endometrial hyperplasia and cancer, reduces rates of endometrial polyps in users of tamoxifen and alleviates pain associated with endometriosis and adenomyosis. Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate controls crises of pain associated with sickle cell disease and endometriosis. Users of the etonogestrel-releasing contraceptive implant have the benefits of a reduction of pain associated with endometriosis, and users of the copper intrauterine device have reduced rates of endometrial and cervical cancer. Despite the high contraceptive effectiveness of many hormonal and intrauterine reversible contraceptive methods, many HCPs, users and potential users are concerned mainly about side effects and safety of both hormonal and non-hormonal contraceptive methods, and there is scarce information\n\nTwo-year continuation of intrauterine devices andÂ contraceptive implants in a mixed-payer setting:Â aÂ retrospective review.\n\nPubMed\n\nSanders, Jessica N; Turok, David K; Gawron, Lori M; Law, Amy; Wen, Lonnie; Lynen, Richard\n\n2017-06-01\n\nAs the popularity of long-acting reversible contraception increases, so does the need for accurate data on method continuation in diverse clinical settings. We determined 2-year continuation rates for the levonorgestrel 52-mg intrauterine device, the copper T380A intrauterine device, and the 68-mg etonogestrel contraceptive implant in an academic healthcare system with mixed-payer reimbursement. The purpose of this study was to examine the proportion and characteristics of women who continue intrauterine device and implant use to 2 years and to relate continuation to device type when controlling for patient characteristics. This retrospective chart review assessed University of Utah Healthcare System patients who had an intrauterine device or contraceptive implant inserted between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2012. We identified users and dates of insertions and removals by querying billing, medication, and procedural data in the Electronic Data Warehouse. Multivariable Poisson regression was conducted to estimate incidence risk ratios and to relate the probability of 2-year continuous use to device type. Data on 8603 device insertions were obtained with theÂ following distribution: levonorgestrel 52-mg intrauterine devicesÂ (6459; 75.1%), copper T380A intrauterine devices (1136;Â 13.2%), and 68-mg etonogestrel implant (1008; 11.7%). Two-year continuation rates were 77.8%, 73.1%, and 75.9%, respectively. There was no statistical difference in 2-year continuation between levonorgestrel 52-mg intrauterine device users (adjusted risk ratio, 1.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.1) and 68-mg etonogestrel implant users (adjusted risk ratio, 1.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.1) compared with copper device users, after we controlled for age, Hispanic ethnicity, payer type, and year of insertion. Older-age, self-pay, or public payer insurance (reference commercial payer) and Hispanic ethnicity were associated with 2-year continuation.

Although the exact mechanisms by which copper-bearing IUDs produce contraceptive action are not completely defined, recent evidence indicates that they act primarily to prevent sperm from fertilizing ova. The future of the IUD is brighter than it has been for the past 20 years. The latest generation of IUDs, such as the TCu 380A (Paragard, GynoPharma, Somerville, NJ), are safer and more effective than ever. In World Health Organization large, multicenter trials, pregnancy rates for the TCu 380A are 1.0, 1.4, 1.6, and 1.8 at 3, 5, 7, and 9 years of use, respectively. The ectopic pregnancy rates and removal for pelvic inflammatory disease are very low. The device may soon be the major IUD available in most countries. The acceptability of IUD use can be increased by good clinical management, sympathetic counseling, careful client selection, proper device selection, careful insertion, timing of insertion, and regular follow-up with quick access to medical care.\n\nComparison of copper intrauterine device with levonorgestrel-bearing intrauterine system for post-abortion contraception.\n\nPubMed\n\nBilgehan, Fatma; Dilbaz, Berna; Karadag, Burak; Deveci, Canan Dura\n\n2015-09-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to compare the safety, bleeding pattern, effects, side-effects, complications and 6-month continuity rates of levonorgestrel-bearing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) with conventional copper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD) inserted immediately after voluntary termination of pregnancy up to 10 weeks of gestation. One hundred women who underwent voluntary pregnancy termination and preferred IUD insertion as a contraceptive method after counseling were enrolled. The patients were randomly allocated to Cu-IUD or LNG-IUS and followed up at 10 days, and at 1, 3 and 6 months. The expulsion rates, continuation rates, side-effects, and bleeding patterns were compared. Fifty women in the Cu-IUD group and 44 women in the LNG-IUS group were followed up. The continuity and expulsion rate for Cu-IUD and LNG-IUS at the end of 6 months was 74%, 12%, and 75%, 11.3%, respectively. In LNG-IUS users, the incidence of amenorrhea and the number of spotting days were higher and hemoglobin increased throughout the follow-up period. The side-effects related to both methods were not different from interval insertions. Immediate post-abortion intrauterine contraception with Cu-IUD or LNG-IUS is a safe, reliable method. The incidence of side-effects is similar, and there is only a slightly higher rate of expulsion but an acceptable rate of method continuation.

Thus, clinical recommendations are based on exposure to a single episode of underprotected intercourse. We sought to assess the prevalence and timing of underprotected intercourse episodes among women requesting emergency contraception and to examine the probability of pregnancy following an emergency contraception regimen including placement of either a copper intrauterine device or a levonorgestrel intrauterine device with simultaneous administration of an oral levonorgestrel pill in women reporting multiple underprotected intercourse episodes, including episodes beyond the Food and Drug Administration-approved emergency contraception time frame (6-14Â days). Women seeking emergency contraception who had a negative pregnancy test and desired either a copper intrauterine device or levonorgestrel emergency contraception regimen enrolled in this prospective observational study. At enrollment, participants reported the number and timing of underprotected intercourse episodes in the previous 14 days. Two weeks later, participants reported the results of a self-administered home pregnancy test. Of the 176 women who presented for emergency contraception and received a same-day intrauterine device, 43% (nÂ = 76) reported multiple underprotected intercourse episodes in the 14 days prior to presenting for emergency contraception. Women with multiple underprotected intercourse episodes reported a median of 3 events (range 2-20). Two-week pregnancy data were available for 172 (98%) participants. Only 1 participant had a positive pregnancy test. Pregnancy occurred in 0 of 97 (0%; 95% confidence interval, 0-3.7%) women with a single underprotected intercourse episode and 1 of 75 (1.3%; 95% confidence interval, 0-7.2%) women reporting multiple underprotected intercourse episodes; this includes 1 of 40 (2.5%; 95% confidence interval, 0-13.2%) women\n\nEffects of intrauterine contraception on the vaginal microbiota.\n\nPubMed\n\nBassis, Christine M; Allsworth, Jenifer E; Wahl, Heather N; Sack, Daniel E; Young, Vincent B; Bell, Jason D\n\n2017-09-01\n\nThere have been conflicting reports of altered vaginal microbiota and infection susceptibility associated with contraception use. The objectives of this study were to determine if intrauterine contraception altered the vaginal microbiota and to compare the effects of a copper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD) and a levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) on the vaginal microbiota. DNA was isolated from the vaginal swab samples of 76 women using Cu-IUD (n=36) or LNG-IUS (n=40) collected prior to insertion of intrauterine contraception (baseline) and at 6 months. A third swab from approximately 12 months following insertion was available for 69 (Cu-IUD, n=33; LNG-IUS, n=36) of these women. The V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA-encoding gene was amplified from the vaginal swab DNA and sequenced. The 16S rRNA gene sequences were processed and analyzed using the software package mothur to compare the structure and dynamics of the vaginal bacterial communities. The vaginal microbiota from individuals in this study clustered into 3 major vaginal bacterial community types: one dominated by Lactobacillus iners, one dominated by Lactobacillus crispatus and one community type that was not dominated by a single Lactobacillus species. Changes in the vaginal bacterial community composition were not associated with the use of Cu-IUD or LNG-IUS. Additionally, we did not observe a clear difference in vaginal microbiota stability with Cu-IUD versus LNG-IUS use. Although the vaginal microbiota can be highly dynamic, alterations in the community associated with the use of intrauterine contraception (Cu-IUD or LNG-IUS) were not detected over 12 months. We found no evidence that intrauterine contraception (Cu-IUD or LNG-IUS) altered the vaginal microbiota composition. Therefore, the use of intrauterine contraception is unlikely to shift the composition of the vaginal microbiota such that infection susceptibility is altered. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Widespread, over-the-counter availability of oral emergency contraception (EC) has not reduced unintended pregnancy rates. The EC visit presents an opportunity to initiate a highly effective method of contraception in a population at high risk of unintended pregnancy who are actively seeking to avoid pregnancy. The copper intrauterine device (IUD), the most effective method of EC, continues to provide contraception as effective as sterilization for up to 12Â years, and it should be offered as the first-line method of EC wherever possible. Increased demand for and supply of the copper IUD for EC may have an important role in reducing rates of unintended pregnancy. The EC visit should include access to the copper IUD as optimal care but should ideally include access to all highly effective methods of contraception.\n\nStructure of a radiate pseudocolony associated with an intrauterine contraceptive device\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nO'Brien, P.K.; Lea, P.J.; Roth-Moyo, L.A.\n\nTransmission electron microscopy of a radiate pseudocolony associated with an intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) showed central bundles of extracellular fibers averaging 35 nm in diameter, surrounded by layered mantles of electron-dense, amorphous granular material. No bacterial, viral, or fungal structures were present. X-ray microanalysis revealed copper, sulfur, chloride, iron, and phosphorus; no calcium was found. It is postulated that these structures and histologically identical non-IUCD-associated granules from the female genital tract, as well as similar structures from other body locations, including those reported in colloid cysts of the third ventricle, are of lipofuscin origin.\n\nBacteriological colonisation of uterine cavity: role of tailed intrauterine contraceptive device.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSparks, R A; Purrier, B G; Watt, P J; Elstein, M\n\n1981-01-01\n\nIntrauterine contraceptive devices (IUCDs) are thought to cause pelvic inflammatory disease by allowing vaginal bacteria to pass into the uterus along the tail of the device. In this study the uterine cavities of 22 women using an IUCD were examined by a multiple biopsy technique. All five uteruses with a tailless IUCD were sterile but 15 out of 17 with a tailed device contained bacteria. The bacteria had not reached the fundus and most were commensals. The bacteria were not introduced by insertion of the IUCD as bacteria were present in several cases long after insertion. No differences in bacterial count were found between monofilamentous and multifilamentous devices. Bacteria were cultured from only four devices, which suggested that the bacteria adhere to the endometrium and not to the device. The bacteria in the cavity represent interference by the tail with the protective mechanisms of the uterus, which explains the increase in pelvic inflammatory disease in IUCD users.

We enrolled a prospective cohort of postpartum adolescents and young women who chose either postplacental IUDs or postpartum contraceptive implants prior to hospital discharge. We used chart review and phone interviews to assess device discontinuation (by request or expulsion) and pregnancy within 12 months. Of the 244 13-22 year-old participants, 82 chose IUDs (74 levonorgestrel IUDs and 8 copper IUDs), and 162 chose implants. Both groups had participant-requested discontinuation rates of 14% (9/67 IUD; 19/135 implant) within 1 year. Participants choosing IUDs had a 25% (17/67) expulsion rate. Median time to expulsion was 4.1 weeks (range: 0.4-29.3 weeks, 16/17 within 12 weeks), and participants recognized 15/17 expulsions. IUD initiators had significantly higher pregnancy rates by 12 months (7.6% vs. 1.5%, p=0.04). Most pregnancies occurred when women discontinued their initial device and did not start alternative contraception. Participant-requested discontinuation was similar in both groups. Differences in overall device discontinuation rates were due to IUD expulsions. Pregnancy rates by 12 months postpartum were lower than previously reported in this age group in both implant initiators and IUD initiators. Young mothers who choose postplacental IUDs or postpartum contraceptive implants are unlikely to request removal within the first year. Clinicians should counsel postplacental IUD users that early expulsion is common (25%) and may be unrecognized (11% of expulsions). Patients should have a plan for contraceptive management should expulsion occur. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

A multinational, prospective, non-interventional cohort study of new users of LNG IUS and copper IUDs was performed. Following a baseline survey, study participants and their physicians completed one follow-up questionnaire after 12 months. A multifaceted four-level follow-up procedure minimized loss to follow-up. Patient-reported outcomes were validated by the treating physicians. A total of 61,448 women with a newly inserted IUD were enrolled in six European countries between 2006 and 2012. The copper IUD cohort contained more than 30 different types. Validated 1-year follow-up information for 58,324 users between 18 and 50 years of age (70% using LNG IUS, 30% using copper IUDs) was collected. A total of 118 contraceptive failures occurred (26 LNG, 92 copper). Both types of IUD were highly effective, with overall Pearl indices of 0.06 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.04-0.09] and 0.52 (95% CI: 0.42-0.64) for LNG IUS and copper IUDs, respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio for LNG IUS vs. copper IUDs was 0.16 (95% CI: 0.10-0.25). Tenty-one pregnancies (7 LNG IUS, 14 copper IUD) were ectopic, yielding an adjusted hazard ratio for ectopic pregnancy of 0.26 (95% CI: 0.10-0.66). The contraceptive failure rate was low with both IUDs. However, the LNG IUS was associated with a significantly lower risk of pregnancy, including ectopic pregnancy, than the copper IUDs. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale, multinational, prospective epidemiological study to measure and compare the contraceptive effectiveness of LNG IUSs and copper IUDs during routine clinical practice. Clinicians and patients should be aware of differences in rates of unintended pregnancies and associated complications\n\nInfection risk and intrauterine devices.\n\nPubMed\n\nMartÃ­nez, Francisca; LÃ³pez-Arregui, Eduardo\n\n2009-01-01\n\nFor most women, intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUCD) are a safe option. Upper genital tract infections (pelvic inflammatory disease, PID) occur when pathogenic microorganisms ascend from the cervix and invade the endometrium and the fallopian tubes, causing an inflammatory reaction. Evidence-based recommendations regarding intrauterine contraception and risk of infection were presented at the Congress of the European Society of Contraception, in Prague, 2008: A clinical history (including sexual history) should be taken as part of the routine assessment for intrauterine contraception to identify women at high risk of sexually transmitted infections (STI); if appropriate a test should be offered; if symptoms or signs are present, appropriate diagnostic tests should be done, results awaited, necessary treatment completed, and IUCD insertion postponed until resolution. Prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended (evidence level II-3). STI screening is not routinely recommended. PID among IUCD users is most strongly related to the insertion process and to the background risk of STI (evidence level II-2). Conditions which represent an unacceptable health risk if an IUCD is inserted (WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria, MEC, Categories 3-4) are current PID, current purulent cervicitis, chlamydial or gonorrheal infection. For continuation as well as initiation, WHO MEC categories 3-4 are allotted to women with known pelvic tuberculosis, puerperal sepsis and septic abortion.\n\nRoutine provision of intrauterine contraception at elective cesarean section in a national public health service: a service evaluation.\n\nPubMed\n\nHeller, Rebecca; Johnstone, Anne; Cameron, Sharon T\n\n2017-09-01\n\nWe conducted a prospective health service evaluation to assess the feasibility and acceptability of routinely offering insertion of intrauterine contraception at cesarean section in a maternity setting in the UK. One month before scheduled cesarean section, women were sent information about postpartum contraception including the option of insertion of an intrauterine contraception at cesarean. Women choosing intrauterine contraception (copper intrauterine device or levonorgestrel intrauterine system) were followed up in person at six weeks, and telephone contact was made at three, six and 12 months postpartum. Our main outcome measures were uptake of intrauterine contraception and complications by six weeks. Secondary outcomes were continuation and satisfaction with intrauterine contraception at 12 months. 120/877 women opted to have intrauterine contraception (13.7%), of which 114 were fitted. By six weeks, there were seven expulsions (6.1%). The expulsion rate by one year was 8.8%. There were no cases of uterine perforations and one case of infection (0.8%). Follow-up rates were 82.5% at 12 months, and continuation rates with intrauterine contraception at 12 months were 84.8% of those contacted. At 12 months, 92.7% of respondents asked were either 'very' or 'fairly' happy with their intrauterine contraception. Routine provision of intrauterine contraception at elective cesarean for women in a public maternity service is feasible and acceptable to women. It is associated with good uptake and good continuation rates for the first year. This could be an important strategy to increase use of intrauterine contraception and prevent short inter-pregnancy intervals and unintended pregnancies.

The secondary objective was to determine factors associated with successful initiation of postpartum IUDs as planned. We conducted a retrospective chart review of women who had at least one prenatal visit and delivered a viable pregnancy at our academic medical center. Methods of planned and established postpartum contraceptive methods were recorded, as well as demographic information and documented reasons for failure to initiate planned intrauterine contraception. A total of 110 women planned postpartum IUD placement. Of these women, 84 (76%) presented for at least one postpartum appointment. Only 22.6% (95% confidence interval 13.7-31.5) of those presenting for postpartum follow-up underwent IUD placement within 8 weeks of delivery. Women planning postpartum IUD insertion were just as likely as women with no planned postpartum contraceptive method to fail to establish contraception within 8 weeks (P = 0.55). Failure to establish planned postpartum intrauterine contraception occurs frequently, even in a setting with a high rate of postpartum follow-up.\n\nA Forgotten Migrated Intrauterine Contraceptive Device Is Not Always Innocent: A Case Report\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBrar, Ranjeet; Doddi, Sudeendra; Ramasamy, Anand; Sinha, Prakash\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe incidence of transuterine perforation and migration of intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUCDs) into the abdominal cavity has been estimated at less than 0.1%. It has been suggested that intraperitoneal IUCD have low morbidity and may be left in situ. We report the first case of closed loop small bowel obstruction due to migration of a âSaf-T-Coilâ IUCD into the abdominal cavity, where it became embedded in the omentum and ultimately, 31 years after deployment, coiled both arms around a loop of ileum. This late complication underlines the dangers of intra-abdominal foreign bodies, even when chemically and biologically inert.

Historically, the use of certain intrauterine devices was associated with increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease. More recent evidence suggests that newer devices do not carry the same threat; however, certain risk factors can increase the possibility of infection. To review the risk of infection with the insertion of intrauterine devices and recommend strategies to prevent infection. The outcomes considered were the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease, the impact of screening for bacterial vaginosis and sexually transmitted infections including chlamydia and gonorrhea; and the role of prophylactic antibiotics. Published literature was retrieved through searches of PubMed, Embase, and The Cochrane Library on July 21, 2011, using appropriate controlled vocabulary (e.g., intrauterine devices, pelvic inflammatory disease) and key words (e.g., adnexitis, endometritis, IUD). An etiological filter was applied in PubMed. The search was limited to the years 2000 forward. There were no language restrictions. Grey (unpublished) literature was identified through searching the web sites of national and international medical specialty societies. The quality of evidence in this document was rated using the criteria described in the Report of the Canadian Task Force on Preventative Health Care (Table). Recommendations 1. All women requesting an intrauterine device should be counselled about the small increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease in the first 20 days after insertion. (II-2A) 2. All women requesting an intrauterine device should be screened by both history and physical examination for their risk of sexually transmitted infection. Women at increased risk should be tested prior to or at the time of insertion; however, it is not necessary to delay insertion until results are returned. (II-2B) 3.

Methods Between January 2012 and June 2014, 109 nulliparous women, aged 18â30â years, who had an intrauterine device (IUD) placed at a student health clinic [88 levonorgestrel-intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) users and 21 Cu T 380A (IUD) users] were surveyed at 1, 6, 12 and 18â months after insertion. Results Overall satisfaction was high; at follow-up survey 83% of 100 women (mean use 13.4â months) were âhappyâ or âvery happyâ with their IUD, and there were no differences in satisfaction between the two IUD types. Some 75% of participants stated that the insertion procedure went âvery wellâ, despite 78% rating insertion pain as moderate to severe, and 46% experiencing vasovagal symptoms. The 12-month continuation rate was 89%, with discontinuations for expulsion (3%), side effects (6%), lack of anticipated benefit (1%) and pregnancy (1%). Users of the Cu T 380A were more likely to have heavy menses (74% vs 2%; p<0.0001) or moderate to severe cramping (68% vs 20%; p=0.0002) compared with LNG-IUS users. There were no uterine perforations or diagnoses of pelvic inflammatory disease. The rate of failed insertions during the study period was 6.2%. Conclusions Despite significant symptoms with insertion, intrauterine contraception is safe, effective and ultimately well tolerated in nulliparous women and should be provided to this population in both university and community health settings.

Because of disparate interventions and outcome measures, we did not conduct meta-analysis. Five trials met the inclusion criteria. The studies included a total of 1503 women, with a mean of 301 participants. The trials compared the following contraceptives: combined oral contraceptive (COC) versus transdermal contraceptive patch, vaginal contraceptive ring, or levonorgestrel intrauterine system 20 Âµg/day (LNG-IUS 20); LNG-IUS 12 Âµg/day (LNG-IUS 12) versus LNG-IUS 16 Âµg/day (LNG-IUS 16); and LNG-IUS 20 versus the copper T380A intrauterine device (IUD). In the trials comparing two different types of methods, the study arms did not differ significantly for contraceptive efficacy or continuation. The sample sizes were small for two of those studies. The only significant outcome was that a COC group had a higher proportion of women who discontinued for 'other personal reasons' compared with the group assigned to the LNG-IUS 20 (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.85), which may have little clinic relevance. The trial comparing LNG-IUS 12 versus LNG-IUS 16 showed similar efficacy over one and three years. In three trials that examined different LNG-IUS, continuation was at least 75% at 6 to 36 months. We considered the overall quality of evidence to be moderate to low. Limitations were due to trial design or limited reporting. Different doses in the LNG-IUS did not appear to influence efficacy over three years. In another study, continuation of the LNG-IUS appeared at least as high as that for the COC. The current evidence was insufficient to compare efficacy and continuation rates for hormonal and intrauterine contraceptive methods in women aged 25 years and younger.\n\nSerum copper levels in users of multiload intra-uterine contraceptive devices.\n\nPubMed\n\nArowojolu, A O; Otolorin, E O; Ladipo, O A\n\n1989-12-01\n\nThe systemic absorption of copper incorporated into multiload intra-uterine contraceptive devices (IUDs), as indicated by serum copper levels in users of such devices, was assessed in a prospective longitudinal study. One hundred and ten healthy Nigerian women using either multiload copper 250 (MLCU 250) or multiload copper 375 (MLCU 375) IUDs participated in the study. Their serum copper levels were estimated serially during 12 months of continuous use of the devices. The mean (+/- s.e.m.) pre-insertion serum copper levels of our subjects using MLCU 250 (17.0 +/- 3 mumol/l) and MLCU 375 (16.7 +/- 0.5 mumol/l) were found to be lower than those reported in Americans (22.2 mumol/l) and in Germans (20.2 mumol/l), although similar to levels in Indians (17.0 mumol/l). There was no significant difference in the mean serum copper levels estimated before and after 1 month of continuous use of the device. Serial estimations of the serum copper levels in users showed that there was no alteration in these levels after a period of 12 months of continuous IUD use. We therefore conclude that the copper incorporated into multiload IUDs appears not to influence the concentration of serum copper of users.\n\nIntrauterine contraception in nulliparous women: a prospective survey.\n\nPubMed\n\nHall, Alexandra M; Kutler, Beth A\n\n2016-01-01\n\nIntrauterine contraception is a first-line option for young women, yet relatively few prospective studies have been performed in nulliparous women using currently available devices, and many providers are still reluctant to provide this option.

Because progesterone (P) antagonists (AP) are known to suppress the endometrium, induce amenorrhea, and inhibit fertility, AP IUDs may provide an effective contraceptive that also controls endometrial bleeding. Here we assessed the effects of empty (blank) vs AP-releasing (ZK 230 211) IUDs on bleeding patterns and endometrial growth in ovariectomized, artificially cycled macaques. The AP IUDs (but not the blank controls) induced extended, frank menstruation when inserted during the late luteal phase, an indication of local AP action. Over time, endometrial glandular and arterial proliferation were inhibited, steroid receptors were elevated, spiral arteries showed degenerative changes, progesterone withdrawal bleeding was prevented and estradiol-dependent proliferation was suppressed by the AP IUDs. In sum, AP IUDs suppressed the effects of P on endometrial progestational development and blocked the effects of estradiol on endometrial proliferation as previously shown for systemic treatment with APs. Therefore, AP IUDs may provide novel contraceptive devices with minimal breakthrough bleeding.

Nulliparous and parous women aged 18-35 years with regular menstrual cycles (21-35 days) requesting contraception were randomized to 3 years of treatment with one of two levonorgestrel intrauterine contraceptive systems: 13.5 mg total content or 19.5 mg total content. The primary outcome was the pregnancy rate, calculated as the Pearl Index. Overall, 1,432 and 1,452 women in the 13.5 mg intrauterine contraceptive system and 19.5 mg intrauterine contraceptive system groups, respectively, had a placement attempted and were included in the full analysis set to evaluate efficacy and safety. Mean (standard deviation) age was 27.1 (4.8) years; 39.2% were nulliparous. Over the 3-year study period, 0.33 pregnancies per 100 women-years (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.16-0.60) were observed with the 13.5 mg intrauterine contraceptive system compared with 0.31 per 100 women-years (95% CI 0.15-0.57) with the 19.5 mg intrauterine contraceptive system. Kaplan-Meier estimates for that period were 0.009 and 0.010, respectively. At least partial expulsions occurred in 4.56% and 3.58% and discontinuation rates resulting from a reported adverse event occurred in 21.9% and 19.1%, respectively. Ten of the 20 pregnancies were ectopic. Serious adverse events included six cases of pelvic inflammatory disease and one partial uterine perforation. Both lower-dose levonorgestrel intrauterine contraceptive systems were highly effective for 3 years of use and generally well tolerated.

Our specific aims were to describe women who accepted PPIUCD, their experience and satisfaction with their choice, and complication of expulsion or infection. Methods We studied 2,733 married women, aged 15â49 years, who received PPIUCD in sixteen health facilities, located in eight states and the national capital territory of India, at the time of IUCD insertion and six weeks later. The satisfaction of women who received IUCD during the postpartum period and problems and complications following insertion were assessed using standardized questionnaires. Results Mean (SD) age of women accepting PPIUCD was 24 (4) years. Over half of women had parity of one, and nearly one-quarter had no formal schooling. Nearly all women (99.6%) reported that they were satisfied with IUCD at the time of insertion and 92% reported satisfaction at the six-week follow-up visit. The rate of expulsion of IUCD was 3.6% by six weeks of follow-up. There were large variations in rates of problems and complications that were largely attributable to the individual hospitals implementing the study. Conclusions Women who receive PPIUCD show a high level of satisfaction with this choice of contraception, and the rates of expulsion were low enough such that the benefits of contraceptive protection outweigh the potential inconvenience of needing to return for care for that subset of women.

The aim of our study was to investigate knowledge and attitudes about intrauterine contraception among obstetricians and gynecologists in the area of Saint Louis. Study Design We mailed a self-administered, anonymous survey to 250 clinicians who provide obstetric and gynecologic care in Saint Louis City and County which included questions about demographics, training, family planning visits, and intrauterine contraceptive knowledge and use. Results The overall survey response rate among eligible clinicians was 73.7%. Clinicians who had recently finished training or saw higher numbers of contraceptive patients per week were more likely to insert intrauterine contraception than clinicians who completed training prior to 1989 or saw fewer contraceptive patients. Several misconceptions among clinicians were identified, including an association between intrauterine contraceptives and an elevated risk of pelvic inflammatory disease. Conclusions Physician misconceptions about the risks of intrauterine contraception continue to occur. Improved clinician education is greatly needed to facilitate the use of these highly effective, long-acting, reversible methods of contraception.

Provision of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) is highly effective in this regard. The aim of our study was to compare use of an effective method of contraception 6 months following insertion of a copper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD) or intake of ulipristal acetate (UPA) for emergency contraception (EC). Women (n = 79) presenting with need for EC at an outpatient midwifery clinic chose either Cu-IUD or UPA according to preference. Follow up was 3 and 6 months later through telephone interviews. Primary outcome was use of an effective contraceptive method at the 6-month follow up. Secondary outcomes included use of an effective contraceptive method at 3 months follow up and acceptability of Cu-IUD. A total of 30/36 (83.3%) women who opted for Cu-IUD for EC used an effective contraceptive method 6 months after their first visit compared with 18/31 (58.1%) women who opted for UPA (p = 0.03). In the Cu-IUD group 28/36 (77.8%) were still using Cu-IUD at 6 months and 31/36 (86%) stated that they would recommend the Cu-IUD to others as an EC method. Significantly more women who chose Cu-IUD for EC used an effective method for contraception at the 6-month follow up. The results of this study support increased use of Cu-IUDs for EC.

New developments in intrauterine technology, smaller frameless copper and levonorgestrel-releasing devices, could help increase the prevalence-- of use in adolescents and nulliparous women. Because adolescents and young nulliparous women contribute disproportionately to the epidemic of unintended pregnancies, long-acting methods of contraception, particularly IUDs, should be considered as first-line choices for interval, emergency and immediate post-abortal contraception in this population of women. As the uterine cavity is generally much smaller in this group than in older women, adapted IUDs may be very useful. Compatibility of the IUD with the small uterine cavity leads to high acceptability and continuation of use, a prerequisite to reduce unintended pregnancies. A strategic advantage of IUDs is that, unlike the Pill, they are genuinely 'fit-and-forget'. In use, they are much more effective than Pills in this age group. However, copper intrauterine devices do not offer protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and, therefore, they are not always the methods of first choice for teenagers and nulliparous women. New evidence, however, from the World Health -Organization and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, shows that IUDs can be used and that they are safe for most women, including adolescents.\n\nDeterminants of Method Switching among Social Franchise Clients Who Discontinued the Use of Intrauterine Contraceptive Device\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHameed, Waqas; Ali, Moazzam; Hussain, Wajahat; Mustafa, Ghulam; Ishaque, Muhammad; Ali, Safdar; Ahmed, Aftab; Temmerman, Marleen\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIntroduction. Women who do not switch to alternate methods after contraceptive discontinuation, for reasons other than the desire to get pregnant or not needing it, are at obvious risk for unplanned pregnancies or unwanted births. This paper examines the factors that influence women to switch from Intrauterine Contraceptive Device (IUCD) to other methods instead of terminating contraceptive usage altogether. Methods. The data used for this study comes from a larger cross-sectional survey conducted in nine (9) randomly selected districts of Sindh and Punjab provinces of Pakistan, during January 2011. Using Stata 11.2, we analyzed data on 333 women, who reported the removal of IUCDs due to reasons other than the desire to get pregnant. Results. We found that 39.9% of the women do not switch to another method of contraception within one month after IUCD discontinuation. Use of contraception before IUCD insertion increases the odds for method switching by 2.26 times after removal. Similarly, postremoval follow-up by community health worker doubles (OR = 2.0) the chances of method switching. Compared with women who received free IUCD service (via voucher scheme), the method switching is 2.01 times higher among women who had paid for IUCD insertion. Conclusion. To increase the likelihood of method switching among IUCD discontinuers this study emphasizes the need for postremoval client counseling, follow-up by healthcare provider, improved choices to a wider range of contraceptives for poor clients, and user satisfaction.

This paper examines the factors that influence women to switch from Intrauterine Contraceptive Device (IUCD) to other methods instead of terminating contraceptive usage altogether. Methods. The data used for this study comes from a larger cross-sectional survey conducted in nine (9) randomly selected districts of Sindh and Punjab provinces of Pakistan, during January 2011. Using Stata 11.2, we analyzed data on 333 women, who reported the removal of IUCDs due to reasons other than the desire to get pregnant. Results. We found that 39.9% of the women do not switch to another method of contraception within one month after IUCD discontinuation. Use of contraception before IUCD insertion increases the odds for method switching by 2.26 times after removal. Similarly, postremoval follow-up by community health worker doubles (OR = 2.0) the chances of method switching. Compared with women who received free IUCD service (via voucher scheme), the method switching is 2.01 times higher among women who had paid for IUCD insertion. Conclusion. To increase the likelihood of method switching among IUCD discontinuers this study emphasizes the need for postremoval client counseling, follow-up by healthcare provider, improved choices to a wider range of contraceptives for poor clients, and user satisfaction.\n\nThe intrauterine device as emergency contraception: how much do young women know?\n\nPubMed\n\nGoodman, Suzan R; El Ayadi, Alison M; Rocca, Corinne H; Kohn, Julia E; Benedict, Courtney E; Dieseldorff, Jessica R; Harper, Cynthia C\n\n2018-04-18\n\nUnprotected intercourse is common, especially among teens and young women. Access to intrauterine device (IUD) as emergency contraception (EC) can help interested patients more effectively prevent unintended pregnancy and can also offer ongoing contraception. This study evaluated young women's awareness of IUD as EC and interest in case of need. We conducted a secondary analysis of data from young women aged 18-25â¯years, not desiring pregnancy within 12â¯months, and receiving contraceptive counseling within a cluster-randomized trial in 40â¯US Planned Parenthood health centers in 2011-2013 (n=1500). Heath centers were randomized to receive enhanced training on contraceptive counseling and IUD placement, or to provide standard care. The intervention did not focus specifically on IUD as EC. We assessed awareness of IUD as EC, desire to learn more about EC and most trusted source of information of EC among women in both intervention and control groups completing baseline and 3- or 6-month follow-up questionnaires (n=1138). At follow-up, very few young women overall (7.5%) visiting health centers had heard of IUD as EC. However, if they needed EC, most (68%) reported that they would want to learn about IUDs in addition to EC pills, especially those who would be very unhappy to become pregnant (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.6, p<.05). Most (91%) reported a doctor or nurse as their most trusted source of EC information, over Internet (6%) or friends (2%), highlighting providers' essential role. Most young women at risk of unintended pregnancy are not aware of IUD as EC and look to their providers for trusted information. Contraceptive education should explicitly address IUD as EC. Few young women know that the IUD can be used for EC or about its effectiveness. However, if they needed EC, most reported that they would want to learn about IUDs in addition to EC pills, especially those very unhappy to become pregnant.

Intrauterine devices are a popular contraceptive choice for many women but are associated with a risk of vagal response upon placement in certain patients with pulmonary hypertension, which may not be well tolerated. More recently, newer permanent contraception devices have emerged in the market, such as the Essure. We describe the first case, to our knowledge, of vagal-associated response due to an Essure device placement.

A prospective observational study of 1073 women using OCs or an IUD at the Family Planning Center 'Marina Alta' in Alicante, Spain. In order to evaluate the relative risk regarding the decrease in libido attributed to each contraceptive method, a logistic regression analysis was undertaken which considered the factors of age adjustment, level of studies, family planning information, relationship with partner, age when sexual relationships were initiated, parity, contraceptive method previously used and the duration of use of the contraceptive method. No differences in the decrease of sexual desire were observed between the use of the OC and IUD (odds ratio (OR) 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70-2.49), yet differences were noted, however, in relation to age (OR 1.05; 95% CI 1.01-1.10). Although these differences were not statistically significant, a high level of awareness regarding family planning was shown to increase sexual desire when compared to a lower level of information on this subject (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.41-1.01). Sexual desire was seen to decrease if the quality of the relationship with the partner was average (OR 2.24; 95% CI 1.36-3.69) or poor (OR 4.69; 95% CI 1.93-11.4). Nulliparous women showed a greater decrease in sexual desire in relation to women who had already given birth (OR 1.57; 95% CI 1.00-2.47). Sexual desire was greater if the contraceptive method had already been in use for 6-12 months (OR 0.41; 95% CI 0.17-0.98). Sexual desire does not vary in relation to the use of OCs or IUDs, yet it does decrease with age, in nulliparous women and in those with an average or poor relationship with their partner. Furthermore, sexual desire shows an increase between the first 6 and 12 months of contraceptive treatment.\n\nCost-effectiveness of emergency contraception options over 1 year.\n\nPubMed\n\nBellows, Brandon K; Tak, Casey R; Sanders, Jessica N; Turok, David K; Schwarz, Eleanor B\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThe copper intrauterine device is the most effective form of emergency contraception and can also provide long-term contraception. The levonorgestrel intrauterine device has also been studied in combination with oral levonorgestrel for women seeking emergency contraception. However, intrauterine devices have higher up-front costs than oral methods, such as ulipristal acetate and levonorgestrel. Health care payers and decision makers (eg, health care insurers, government programs) with financial constraints must determine if the increased effectiveness of intrauterine device emergency contraception methods are worth the additional costs. We sought to compare the cost-effectiveness of 4 emergency contraception strategies-ulipristal acetate, oral levonorgestrel, copper intrauterine device, and oral levonorgestrel plus same-day levonorgestrel intrauterine device-over 1 year from a US payer perspective. Costs (2017 US dollars) and pregnancies were estimated over 1 year using a Markov model of 1000 women seeking emergency contraception. Every 28-day cycle, the model estimated the predicted number of pregnancy outcomes (ie, live birth, ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, or induced abortion) resulting from emergency contraception failure and subsequent contraception use. Model inputs were derived from published literature and national sources. An emergency contraception strategy was considered cost-effective if the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ie, the cost to prevent 1 additional pregnancy) was less than the weighted average cost of pregnancy outcomes in the United States ($5167). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and probability of being the most cost-effective emergency contraception strategy were calculated from 1000 probabilistic model iterations. One-way sensitivity analyses were used to examine uncertainty in the cost of emergency contraception, subsequent contraception, and pregnancy outcomes as well as the model probabilities. In 1000 women\n\nRoutine counseling about intrauterine contraception for women seeking emergency contraception.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchwarz, E Bimla; Papic, Melissa; Parisi, Sara M; Baldauf, Erin; Rapkin, Rachel; Updike, Glenn\n\n2014-07-01\n\nTo compare contraceptive knowledge and use among women seeking emergency contraception (EC) before and after an inner-city clinic began providing structured counseling and offering same-day intrauterine device (IUD) or implant placement to all women seeking EC. For 8 months before and 21 months after this change in clinic policy, women aged 15-45 who wanted to avoid pregnancy for at least 6 months were asked to complete surveys immediately, 3 and 12 months after their clinic visit. In addition, we abstracted electronic medical record (EMR) data on all women who sought EC (n=328) during this period. We used chi-squared tests to assess pre/post differences in survey and EMR data. Surveys were completed by 186 women. After the clinic began offering structured counseling, more women had accurate knowledge of the effectiveness of IUDs, immediately and 3 months after their clinic visit. In addition, more women initiated IUD or implant use (survey: 40% vs. 17% preintervention, p=0.04; EMR: 22% vs. 10% preintervention, p=0.01), and fewer had no contraceptive use (survey: 3% vs. 17% preintervention, p<0.01; EMR: 32% vs. 68%, p<0.01) in the 3 months after seeking EC. EMR data indicate that when same-day placement was offered, 11.0% of women received a same-day IUD. Of those who received a same-day IUD, 88% (23/26) reported IUD use at 3-months and 80% (12/15) at 12 months. Routine provision of structured counseling with the offer of same-day IUD placement increases knowledge and use of IUDs 3 months after women seek EC. Women seeking EC from family planning clinics should be offered counseling about highly effective reversible contraceptives with the option of same-day contraceptive placement.

Study Design Women enrolling in a 2-month study who desired an IUD for contraception were randomized 1:1 to receive a levonorgestrel 52mg IUD (LNG-IUD) or copper T380A (Cu-IUD), understanding they could switch IUD type at the end of the study. Results Randomization to IUD type was acceptable to 54/55 (98%) women who screened. All 32 enrolled participants completed follow-up. Two women exchanged their IUD (Cu-IUD to LNG-IUD) and 2 requested removal (1 LNG-IUD, 1 Cu-IUD). Overall, 88% continued their assigned IUD. Conclusions Randomization to IUD type is feasible and few women change their IUD.

Cost-effectiveness model using efficacy and discontinuation data from published articles. Societal perspective including direct and indirect costs. Women at risk of unintended pregnancy using reversible contraception. An economic analysis was conducted by modeling the different health states of women using contraception over a 3-year period. Typical use efficacy rates from published articles were used to determine unintended pregnancy events. Discontinuation rates were used to account for method switching. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated in terms of the incremental cost per unintended pregnancy avoided. In addition, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year was calculated. Levonorgestrel intrauterine system 13.5 mg generated costs savings of â¬ 311,000 in a cohort of 1000 women aged 15-44 years. In addition, there were fewer unintended pregnancies (55 vs. 294) compared with women using oral contraception. Levonorgestrel intrauterine system 13.5 mg is a cost-effective method when compared with oral contraception. A shift in contraceptive use from oral contraception to long-acting reversible contraception methods could result in fewer unintended pregnancies, quality-adjusted life-year gains, as well as cost savings.

IUDs are safe and highly effective for emergency contraception and regular contraception, and are extremely cost-effective as an ongoing method. The objective of this study was to evaluate the existing data to estimate the efficacy of IUDs for emergency contraception. METHODS The reference list for this study was generated from hand searching the reference lists of relevant articles and our own article archives, and electronic searches of several databases: Medline, Global Health, Clinicaltrials.gov, Popline, Wanfang Data (Chinese) and Weipu Data (Chinese). We included studies published in English or Chinese, with a defined population of women who presented for emergency contraception and were provided with an IUD, and in which the number of pregnancies was ascertained and loss to follow-up was clearly defined. Data from each article were abstracted independently by two reviewers. RESULTS The 42 studies (of 274 retrieved) that met our inclusion criteria were conducted in six countries between 1979 and 2011 and included eight different types of IUD and 7034 women. The maximum timeframe from intercourse to insertion of the IUD ranged from 2 days to 10 or more days; the majority of insertions (74% of studies) occurred within 5 days of intercourse. The pregnancy rate (excluding one outlier study) was 0.09%. CONCLUSIONS IUDs are a highly effective method of contraception after unprotected intercourse. Because they are safe for the majority of women, highly effective and cost-effective when left in place as ongoing contraception, whenever clinically feasible IUDs should be included in the range of emergency contraception options offered to patients presenting after unprotected intercourse. This review is limited by the fact that the original studies did not provide sufficient data on the delay between intercourse and insertion of the IUD, parity, cycle day\n\nContraceptive use in the Nordic countries.\n\nPubMed\n\nLindh, Ingela; Skjeldestad, Finn E; Gemzell-Danielsson, Kristina; Heikinheimo, Oskari; Hognert, Helena; Milsom, Ian; Lidegaard, Ãjvind\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe aim was to compare contraceptive use in the Nordic countries and to assess compliance with recommendations from the European Medicines Agency regarding the use of combined oral contraception containing low-dose estrogen and levonorgestrel, norethisterone or norgestimate. Data on hormonal contraceptive prescriptions and sales figures for copper intrauterine devices were obtained from national databases and manufacturers in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden in 2010-2013. Contraceptive use was highest in Denmark (42%) and Sweden (41%), followed by Finland (40%). Combined oral contraception was the most used method in all countries, with the highest use in Denmark (26%). The second most used method was the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system, with the highest use in Finland (15%) and â10% in the other countries. Copper intrauterine devices (7%) and the progestin-only pill (7%) were most often used in Sweden. Combined oral contraception use decreased with increasing age and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system and progestin-only pills use increased. The use of long-acting reversible methods of contraception (=levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system, copper intrauterine devices, and implants) increased with time and was highest in Sweden (20%) and Finland (18%). The highest use of European Medicines Agency recommended combined oral contraception was in Denmark, increasing from 13 to 50% between 2010 and 2013. In Finland, recommended combined oral contraception remained below 1%. Contraceptive use was highest in Denmark and Sweden, levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system use was highest in Finland and all long-acting methods were most common in Sweden. The use of combined oral contraception recommended by the European Medicines Agency was highest in Denmark.

The four devices were the Dalkon shield, Lippes loops 3C and 2D, and the Gravigard (copper 7), and data used were those collected systematically through the UK intrauterine device research network. Prospective reports that the Dalkon shield was uniquely related to high levels of infection when compared with other intrauterine devices were not substantiated in this prospective study among 13 349 users. Though some factors such as social class and previous experience of abortion appeared to influence the rate of infection, the type of intrauterine device being worn did not appear to be a significant factor. Various methods of analysis were used including life table, regression, and discriminant analysis, using information relating to the type of intrauterine device worn, the characteristics of the user, the fitting centre, and the pattern of diagnosis and treatment of reported or suspected pelvic infection. The results of this study suggest that fears that the Dalkon shield may be associated with a higher incidence of pelvic infection than other intrauterine devices may have been unjustified.

The nodule showed no external evidence of an IUD or its string. An examination of the nodular surface by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed mostly amorphous material with some adherent filamentous structures. Its energy dispersive x-ray microanalysis revealed the presence of calcium and phosphorus suggesting that the nodule was actually a urolith. Fracturing the nodule exposed an embedded entity consistent with being a copper IUD.moreÂ Â» Apparently, the lost IUD had migrated from the uterus into the bladder where it became mineralized. Thus the solid nodule was actually a foreign body stone.Â«Â less\n\nEvaluation of quality of life and sexual functioning of women using levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine contraceptive system--Mirena.\n\nPubMed\n\nSkrzypulec, Violetta; Drosdzol, Agnieszka\n\n2008-12-01\n\nThe advantages ensuing from the high contraceptive efficacy, positive effect on the parameters of the menstrual cycle as well as other values of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system may play an important role in women's sexual life. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system on the quality of life and sexual functioning of women. The research encompassed 200 women aged between 30 and 45. 52 women using the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system were qualified to the study as the research group (Mirena Group). The control groups consisted of 48 women using a different type of intrauterine device (Control Group I--Other IUD) and 50 women using no contraception (Control Group II). A specific questionnaire with a general part concerning socio-demographic conditions, a part dealing with contraception and Polish version of self-evaluation inventories: Short Form-36 Health Survey, Female Sexual Function Index and Mell-Krat Scale was used as a research tool. Quality of life parameters for women using the Mirena system were higher than for the control groups, especially in the aspect of general health, energy/fatigue and emotional well-being. A significant beneficial effect of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system on sexual functioning (sexual desire and arousal) was also revealed in the study. Sexual dysfunctions were diagnosed in 20.8% of Other IUD, 34.7% of Control Group II and 9.6% of Mirena Group. Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system increases female quality of life and sexual functioning parameters.\n\nImmediate vs. delayed insertion of intrauterine contraception after second trimester abortion: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nNorman, Wendy V; Kaczorowski, Janusz; Soon, Judith A; Brant, Rollin; Bryan, Stirling; Trouton, Konia J; Dicus, Lyda\n\n2011-06-14\n\nWe describe the rationale and protocol for a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess whether intrauterine contraception placed immediately after a second trimester abortion will result in fewer pregnancies than current recommended practice of intended placement at 4 weeks post-abortion. Decision analysis suggests the novel strategy could substantially reduce subsequent unintended pregnancies and abortions. This paper highlights considerations of design, implementation and evaluation of a trial expected to provide rigorous evidence for appropriate insertion timing and health economics of intrauterine contraception after second trimester abortion. Consenting women choosing to use intrauterine contraception after abortion for a pregnancy of 12 to 24 weeks will be randomized to insertion timing groups either immediately (experimental intervention) or four weeks (recommended care) post abortion. Primary outcome measure is pregnancy rate at one year. Secondary outcomes include: cumulative pregnancy rates over five year follow-up period, comprehensive health economic analyses comparing immediate and delayed insertion groups, and device retention rates, complication rates (infection, expulsion) and, contraceptive method satisfaction. Web-based Contraception Satisfaction Questionnaires, clinical records and British Columbia linked health databases will be used to assess primary and secondary outcomes. Enrolment at all clinics in the province performing second trimester abortions began in May 2010 and is expected to complete in late 2011. Data on one year outcomes will be available for analysis in 2014. The RCT design combined with access to clinical records at all provincial abortion clinics, and to information in provincial single-payer linked administrative health databases, birth registry and hospital records, offers a unique opportunity to evaluate such an approach by determining pregnancy rate at one through five years among enrolled women.

Scanning electron microscopy was used to study the crust. Cellular material consisted mainly of blood cells and various types of bacteria. The fibrillar material appeared to be fibrin which was omnipresent in the crust and formed a thin layer immediately over the IUD surface. X-ray microanalysis of the acellular component of the crust revealed the presence of calcium. No other major peaks were identified. Near the IUD surface characteristic calcium phosphate crystals were present. Their microanalysis showed peaks for calcium and phosphorus. X-ray diffractionmoreÂ Â» of the crust however, showed it to contain only calcite. It is through the use of scanning electron microscopy that calcium phosphate has been detected in the IUD crust and a fibrillar layer has been visualized on the IUD surface. This study further demonstrates the effectiveness of SEM analytical techniques in the area of biomedical research.Â«Â less\n\nExpression profiles of antimicrobial peptides in the genital tract of women using progesterone intrauterine devices versus combined oral contraceptives.\n\nPubMed\n\nIntroini, Andrea; KaldensjÃ¶, Tove; Hirbod, Taha; RÃ¶hl, Maria; Tjernlund, Annelie; Andersson, Sonia; Broliden, Kristina\n\n2014-11-01\n\nSex hormones can influence the immune defenses of the female genital tract (FGT) and its susceptibility to infections. Here we investigated the effect of different hormonal contraceptives on the production of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in different compartments of the female genital mucosa (FGM), secretions and tissue. Cervicovaginal secretions (CVS) and ectocervical tissue samples obtained from women using progesterone intrauterine devices (pIUD) (n = 23) and combined oral contraceptives (COC) (n = 23) were analyzed for the expression and in situ localization of HNP1-3, BD-2, LL-37, SLPI and trappin-2 by ELISA, real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry. Women using COC had significantly lower mRNA levels of BD-2 and trappin-2 in ectocervical tissue than pIUD users. The two groups showed no differences in CVS concentration, as well as similar in situ expression patterns in ectocervical tissue, of all five AMPs. The use of hormonal contraceptives influences AMP expression differently in genital secretions compared to ectocervical tissue. This suggests that the impact of sex hormones on local immune defenses varies in different compartments of the FGM, and likely in different locations across the FGT. Â© 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

One approach to decrease that rate is to increase contraceptive use. We sought to characterize LA and MS family physicians' (FPs) contraception counseling for adolescents with a focus on the intrauterine contraceptive device (IUD). DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, INTERVENTIONS, AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Online survey of resident and practicing physician members of the LA and MS Academy of FPs. Three hundred ninety-eight of 1616 invited FPs responded; 244 were included in our analysis. When counseling adolescents about contraception, respondents \"frequently discussed\" oral contraceptives and condoms 87.5% (210/240) and 83.8% (202/241) of the time, respectively. Newer and more highly effective contraceptives such as the ring, patch, IUD, and implant were \"frequently discussed\" only 34.6% (82/237)-39.3% (92/234) of the time. In the previous 6Â months, 56% (136/243) of respondents ever discussed an IUD with an adolescent. Respondents were more likely to have discussed IUDs if they learned IUD insertion during residency, had on-site access to IUD inserters, believed they were competent and/or comfortable with IUD counseling. In 5 clinical scenarios asking whether the respondent would recommend an IUD to a 17- or a 27-year-old patient (in all scenarios patients were eligible for an IUD), respondents were restrictive overall and significantly fewer would recommend an IUD for the adolescent. Our results suggest that there are missed opportunities for full-scope contraception counseling by LA and MS FPs. When these FPs counsel adolescents about contraception they less frequently discuss newer methods and more highly effective methods. Additionally many LA and MS FPs use overly restrictive eligibility criteria when considering IUDs. Copyright Â© 2016 North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology.

The use of long acting reversible methods (LARC) is proposed as a strategy to reverse undesirable maternal health consequences in developing countries. To determine the uptake of long-acting reversible contraceptive in The Gambia. A community based cross-sectional study of women attending family planning clinic were studied using intervieweradministered questionnaire which included information on socio-demographic factors, reproductive health and contraceptive use of the participants. About 89 % of study participants used long acting reversible contraceptive methods. Of the three commonly available long acting reversible contraceptive methods, Depo Provera was the most commonly used method; 78 of 141 (55.32%); followed by implants (43.3%) and intrauterine contraceptive (1.42%). Being housewives, with 3-4 living children and having secondary level education were associated with high uptake of LARC. The uptake of long acting reversible contraceptive was high; with Depo Provera as the most commonly used contraceptive method in The Gambia. There seemed to be an increase in the uptake of implants; with intrauterine contraceptive device being the least commonly used method.\n\nA reanalysis of the Cu-7 intrauterine contraceptive device clinical trial and the incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease: a paradigm for assessing intrauterine contraceptive device safety.\n\nPubMed\n\nRoy, S; Azen, C\n\n1994-06-01\n\nWe calculated and compared the incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease in a 10% random sample of the Cu-7 intrauterine contraceptive device (G.D. Searle & Co., Skokie, Ill.) clinical trial with the rates reported to the Food and Drug Administration and those in subsequent trials published in the world literature. A 10% random sample of the Cu-7 clinical trial was examined because calculations had demonstrated this random sample to be sufficient in size (n = 1614) to detect a difference in rates of pelvic inflammatory disease from those reported to the Food and Drug Administration. An audit of a subset of the patient files, compared with the original files in Skokie, Illinois, confirmed that the files available for analysis were complete. Standard definitions were used to identify cases of pelvic inflammatory disease and to calculate rates of pelvic inflammatory disease. The world literature on Cu-7 clinical trials was reviewed. The calculated crude and Pearl index rates of pelvic inflammatory disease were consistent with those rates previously reported to the Food and Drug Administration and published in the medical literature. Life-table pelvic inflammatory disease rates were not different between nulliparous and parous women and pelvic inflammatory disease did not differ from basal annual rates in fecund women. On the basis of the analysis of this 10% sample, the pelvic inflammatory disease patient rates reported to the Food and Drug Administration for the entire Cu-7 clinical trial are accurate and are similar to those published in the world literature.\n\nSix-month expulsion of postplacental copper intrauterine devices placed after vaginal delivery.\n\nPubMed\n\nGurney, Elizabeth P; Sonalkar, Sarita; Mcallister, Arden; Sammel, Mary D; Schreiber, Courtney A\n\n2018-06-02\n\nImmediate placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) after vaginal delivery is safe and convenient, but longitudinal data describing clinical outcomes have been limited. To determine the proportion of TCu380A (copper) IUDs devices expelled, partially expelled, malpositioned, and retained, as well as contraceptive use by 6 months postpartum. To determine risk factors for expulsion and partial expulsion. In this prospective, observational study, women who received a postplacental TCu380A IUD at vaginal delivery were enrolled postpartum. Participants returned for clinical follow-up at 6 weeks, and for a research visit with a pelvic exam and ultrasound at 6 months. We recorde"
