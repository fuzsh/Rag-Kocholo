        "text": "LOUDONVILLE – The NBA’s Draft Lottery Wednesday evening and this weekend’s seventh annual GymRat Challenge AAU boys basketball tournament at Siena College and the University at Albany share a common link, more accurately, a Houston LYNX.\n\nAs Orlando Magic general manager Pat Williams jumped for joy in Secaucus, N.J. after he realized his team owned the No. 1 selection, the local legend of the prospective top selection grew a little bit more.\n\nMany believe the Magic will select University of Connecticut center Emeka Okafor.\n\nBack in 1999, the 6-foot-10 Okafor made his first appearance in an AAU national tournament at the GymRat Challenge for the Houston LYNX. Okafor’s spectacular performance at the event helped the then-unknown center become a hot commodity.\n\n“The GymRat Challenge was Emeka’s first experience on the road,” said Dr. George Schudy, the head coach and co-founder of the Houston LYNX with his wife Judy. “Things really took off for him after that.”\n\nMore than 2,000 hopefuls invade the area this weekend hoping they can become the next Emeka Okafor. Pool play for the field of 200 teams, including several for the Capital Region, at the 17, 16 and 15-year old levels begins Saturday morning at Siena and UAlbany. Tournament passes are $8 and a one-day pass can be purchased for $6 at the door of both locations.\n\nThe GymRat Challenge is one of the largest and best-run AAU tournaments in the country. Tournament founder and Executive Director John Kmack has put together a star-studded field of 80 teams at the 17-year old level, 72 teams at the 16-year old level and 48 teams at the 15-year old level.\n\n“I love coming to John’s tournament because he plans his work and he works his plan,” Dr. Schudy said. “He has extra people working, extra trainers and everyone is constantly communicating. We really like the way he runs the tournament and I like the exposure it has given our kids.”\n\nSeveral future Division I stars have played in the GymRat Challenge since its inception in 1998, including Siena recruit Artavius “Tay” Fisher.\n\nOkafor’s arrival in 1999 received little fanfare at the time – for good reason.\n\nJust before the start of 1999 AAU season, Okafor wasn’t even a member of the Houston LYNX.\n\n“We were putting together our first team and we already had all our post players,” Dr. Schudy said. “Just before we were to start our season, two of them decided the hour-plus travel was too much and decided to play for other teams. I remembered a kid from Bellaire. He was a big, raw-boned that was sort of green. I couldn’t remember his name, but I knew he wore No. 50.”\n\nJudy Schudy had some connections and arranged a meeting for her husband with Okafor at a local Burger King.\n\n“Emeka is very, very meticulous and very, very thorough. He asked a lot of questions,” Dr. Schudy said. “We had no track record at all.”\n\nDr. Schudy, who runs a privately-founded AAU program, still made enough of an impression on Okafor for him to join the LYNX.\n\nAfter playing in the Kingswood Classic in Houston, Okafor and the LYNX made their first national trip together to compete at the GymRat Challenge.\n\n“A lot of people want us to go become an elite-only tournament. Nobody knows exactly who the elite are. To me, that isn’t what AAU basketball is about,” Kmack said. “In some tournaments, teams are invited on reputation. You earn your reputation. If we were an elite-only tournament, Emeka Okafor never would have been here.”\n\nOkafor helped the LYNX advance to the championship round and then put on a jaw-dropping performance against the highly-regarded New York Gauchos.\n\n“We got into the championship round on a tie-breaker,” Dr. Schudy recalled. “I remember asking John who we drew and he said, ‘The New York Gauchos. Good Luck.’ I figured we were in for it.”\n\nThe LYNX pulled off the upset.\n\n“What Emeka did was something to see,” Kmack said.\n\nOkafor went on to land a scholarship at UConn and helped the Huskies capture the 2004 NCAA championship in his junior season. An academic All-America, Okafor graduated UConn in three years and declared himself for the NBA draft last month.\n\n“He single-handily improved more than anyone else we had,” Dr. Schudy said Okafor. “Some of the other kids we had were very talented also, but Emeka has done more with what he has been given. That comes from hard work. His work-ethic is amazing.”"
