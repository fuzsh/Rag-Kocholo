This study examined the effect of immediate vs delayed postpartum levonorgestrel intrauterine device insertion on breast-feeding outcomes. We conducted this noninferiority randomized controlled trial at the University of Utah and the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Centers from February 2014 through March 2016. Eligible women were pregnant and planned to breast-feed, spoke English or Spanish, were aged 18-40 years, and desired a levonorgestrel intrauterine device. Enrolled women were randomized 1:1 to immediate postpartum insertion or delayed insertion at 4-12 weeks' postpartum. Prespecified exclusion criteria included delivery <37.0 weeks' gestational age, chorioamnionitis, postpartum hemorrhage, contraindications to levonorgestrel intrauterine device insertion, and medical complications of pregnancy that could affect breast-feeding. We conducted per-protocol analysis as the primary approach, as it is considered the standard for noninferiority studies; we also report the alternative intent-to-treat analysis. We powered the study for the primary outcome, breast-feeding continuation at 8 weeks, to detect a 15% noninferiority margin between groups, requiring 132 participants in each arm. The secondary study outcome, time to lactogenesis, used a validated measure, and was analyzed by survival analysis and log rank test. We followed up participants for ongoing data collection for 6 months. Only the data analysis team was blinded to the intervention. We met the enrollment target with 319 participants, but lost 34 prior to randomization and excluded an additional 26 for medical complications prior to delivery. The final analytic sample included 132 in the immediate group and 127 in the delayed group.

Chart review was undertaken of patients with AH/EC who underwent levonorgestrel intrauterine device insertion by a gynecologic oncologist within two academic health systems between 2002 and 2013. When available, tissue blocks were evaluated with immunohistochemical staining for progesterone receptor expression. A total of 41 patients received treatment for AH/EC with the levonorgestrel intrauterine device. Follow up sufficient to assess response occurred in 36 women (88%). Complete response was documented in 18 of 36 women (50%), no response in 8 patients (22%), partial response in 3 women (8%) and progression of disease in 7 patients (19%). Four of 18 patients with complete response (22%) later experienced relapse of hyperplasia or cancer. Four patients (10%) died during the study period: none had evidence of metastatic disease and 1 of the 4 woman died of perioperative complications following hysterectomy for stage I disease. Patients responding to treatment had significantly lower progesterone receptor expression on post-treatment biopsies. Intrauterine levonorgestrel is a viable treatment option for post-menopausal women with AH/EC who are poor candidates for standard surgical management. The response rate in this series is similar to published reports in premenopausal patients and includes cases of disease recurrence following conversion to benign endometrium.

Transvaginal 2D and 3D US examinations were performed on all patients 1 month after insertion of levonorgestrel IUDs. The devices were considered adequately visualized on 2D US if both the vertical (shadow, upper and lower extremities) and the horizontal (two echogenic lines) shafts were identified. 3D volumes were also captured to assess the location of levonorgestrel IUDs on 3D US. Thirty women were included. The rates of adequate device visualization were 40% on 2D US (95% confidence interval [CI], 24.6; 57.7) and 100% on 3D US (95% CI, 88.6; 100.0). The device was not adequately visualized in all six women who had a retroflexed uterus, but it was adequately visualized in 12 of the 24 women (50%) who had a nonretroflexed uterus (95% CI, -68.6; -6.8). We found that 3D US is better than 2D US for locating and adequately visualizing levonorgestrel IUDs. Other well-designed studies with adequate power should be conducted to confirm this finding.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that studies of Mirena(Â®) were generally small and consequently imprecise. Our study was aimed at assessing the effects of a slow-release levonorgestrel (20 Î¼g/day) intrauterine device in fertile and postmenopausal women experiencing abnormal uterine bleeding that did not respond to traditional medical management. A total of 40 women, of whom 24 were of reproductive capacity and 16 were postmenopausal, were enrolled in the trial. Removal of the intrauterine device was required for only 2 of the 24 fertile women and for only 3 of the 16 postmenopausal women. After 6 and 12 months of treatment, the remaining women were clinically evaluated and underwent ultrasound and hysteroscopy using biopsy specimens as a control. The EuroQol Group EQ-5D questionnaire was used for evaluation of quality of life. The device showed good tolerability and efficacy. It resulted in a reduction in the endometrial mucosal thickness with a regression of bleeding and collateral effects, which were more evident after 12 months of treatment. A positive effect of the device on the woman's quality of life was demonstrated. The slow-release levonorgestrel intrauterine device may be a valid therapeutic tool for treating basic symptomatology and increasing quality of life in women with abnormal uterine bleeding.

METHODS We enrolled pregnant women planning vaginal deliveries and desiring a postpartum levonorgestrel-releasing IUD. Patients were randomly assigned when admitted in labor to postplacental or delayed IUD insertion. The women followed up in person at 6â8 weeks and 6 months and were contacted by telephone at 3 months. Women were ineligible for a study IUD postenrollment for intrapartum events including infection, hemorrhage, and cesarean delivery; these women were contacted by phone at 3 and 6 months. Expelled IUDs were replaced per patient preference. RESULTS Successful IUD placement occurred in 50 of 51 participants (98.0%) and 46 of 51 participants (90.2%) in the postplacental and delayed groups, respectively (P=.2). Expulsion within 6 months occurred in 12 of 50 (24.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 13.1â38.2) and two of 46 (4.4%; 95% CI 0.5â14.8) participants, respectively (P=.008). Intrauterine device use at 6 months was 43 of 51 (84.3%; 95% CI 71.4â93.0) and 39 of 51 (76.5%; 95% CI 62.5â87.2), respectively (P=.32). For ineligible patients, only 11 of 41 (26.8%) women were using IUDs at 6 months and two (4.9%) had become pregnant. CONCLUSION Intrauterine device use 6 months after delivery is similar in women who have postpartum or scheduled delayed IUD placement through a study after replacement of expelled IUDs. Expulsions are significantly higher with postplacental compared with delayed IUD placement. Women asked to follow up with their own health care providers for delayed insertion are significantly less likely to receive an IUD.

However, recent clinical trials have identified side effects of LNG-IUD that appear to be systemically mediated, including depressed mood and emotional lability. We performed two experimental studies and a cross-sectional study. For each study, women were included from three groups: LNG-IUD (0.02mg/24h), oral ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel (0.03mg/0.15mg; EE30/LNG) and natural cycling (NC). Study 1-Salivary cortisol was measured at baseline and at defined intervals following the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Heart rate was monitored continuously throughout the TSST. Study 2-Salivary cortisol and serum total cortisol were evaluated relative to low-dose (1Î¼g) adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) administration. Study 3-Hair cortisol was measured as a naturalistic index of long-term cortisol exposure. Women using LNG-IUD had an exaggerated salivary cortisol response to the TSST (24.95Â±13.45 nmol/L, 95% CI 17.49-32.40), compared to EE30/LNG (3.27Â±2.83 nmol/L, 95% CI 1.71-4.84) and NC (10.85Â±11.03nmol/L, 95% CI 6.30-15.40) (P<0.0001). Heart rate was significantly potentiated during the TSST in women using LNG-IUD (P=0.047). In response to ACTH challenge, women using LNG-IUD and EE30/LNG had a blunted salivary cortisol response, compared to NC (P<0.0001). Women using LNG-IUD had significantly elevated levels of hair cortisol compared to EE30/LNG or NC (P<0.0001). Our findings suggest that LNG-IUD contraception induces a centrally-mediated sensitization of both autonomic and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis responsivity. LNG-IUD sensitization of HPA axis responsivity was observed acutely under standardized laboratory conditions, as well as chronically under naturalistic conditions. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Continuation of hormonal intrauterine devices (IUDs) - widely used and highly effective contraceptives that also decrease menstrual flow - is controversial during hematopoietic stem cell transplants (SCTs) due to infectious and vaginal bleeding concerns. A 23-year-old nulligravid female was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML, positive for FLT3-ITD, DNMT3A and RUNX1, with normal cytogenetics). She elected to retain her existing levonorgestrel-containing IUD during chemotherapy and SCT. During and following treatment, she remained amenorrheic without infection, despite severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Eight months later, she remains in remission without IUD-related complications. This is the first report of levonorgestrel IUD retention during hematopoietic SCT. Despite severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, the patient developed neither pelvic infection by retaining her IUD nor significant vaginal bleeding. Future studies are needed to confirm the safety of levonorgestrel IUDs in women undergoing SCT. CopyrightÂ© 2017, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

All Finnish women aged 30-49 years using a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system for treatment of menorrhagia in 1994-2007 (n=93,843) were identified from the National Reimbursement Registry and linked to the Finnish Cancer Registry data. The incidence of cancers in levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system users was compared with that in the general population. A total of 2,781 cancer cases were detected in levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system users during the follow-up of 855,324 women-years. The standardized incidence ratio (observed-to-expected ratio) for endometrial adenocarcinoma was 0.50 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.35-0.70; 34 observed compared with 68 expected cases) after the first levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system purchase and 0.25 (95% CI 0.05-0.73; three observed compared with 12 expected cases) after two purchases. The standardized incidence ratio for ovarian cancer was 0.60 (95% CI 0.45-0.76; 59 observed compared with 99 expected cases), for pancreatic cancer 0.50 (95% CI 0.28-0.81; 15 observed compared with 30 expected cases), and for lung cancer 0.68 (95% CI 0.49-0.91; 43 observed compared with 63 expected cases). The standardized incidence ratio for breast cancer among all levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system users was 1.19 (95% CI 1.13-1.25; 1,542 observed compared with 1,292 expected cases). The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system may have a protective effect against endometrial malignant transformation. Using the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system for treatment of menorrhagia during reproductive years was associated with a lower incidence of endometrial, ovarian, pancreatic, and lung cancers than expected. Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system use was associated with a higher than expected\n\nComparison of copper intrauterine device with levonorgestrel-bearing intrauterine system for post-abortion contraception.\n\nPubMed\n\nBilgehan, Fatma; Dilbaz, Berna; Karadag, Burak; Deveci, Canan Dura\n\n2015-09-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to compare the safety, bleeding pattern, effects, side-effects, complications and 6-month continuity rates of levonorgestrel-bearing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) with conventional copper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD) inserted immediately after voluntary termination of pregnancy up to 10 weeks of gestation. One hundred women who underwent voluntary pregnancy termination and preferred IUD insertion as a contraceptive method after counseling were enrolled. The patients were randomly allocated to Cu-IUD or LNG-IUS and followed up at 10 days, and at 1, 3 and 6 months. The expulsion rates, continuation rates, side-effects, and bleeding patterns were compared. Fifty women in the Cu-IUD group and 44 women in the LNG-IUS group were followed up. The continuity and expulsion rate for Cu-IUD and LNG-IUS at the end of 6 months was 74%, 12%, and 75%, 11.3%, respectively. In LNG-IUS users, the incidence of amenorrhea and the number of spotting days were higher and hemoglobin increased throughout the follow-up period. The side-effects related to both methods were not different from interval insertions. Immediate post-abortion intrauterine contraception with Cu-IUD or LNG-IUS is a safe, reliable method. The incidence of side-effects is similar, and there is only a slightly higher rate of expulsion but an acceptable rate of method continuation.

One hundred thirty eight women aged between 30 and 50 years with abnormal uterine bleeding and diagnosed as EH by transvaginal ultrasound were randomized to receive either LNG-IUD or dydrogesterone for 6 months. Primary outcome measures were regression of hyperplasia after 6 months of therapy. Secondary outcome measures were occurrence of side effects during treatment or recurrence of hyperplasia during follow-up period. After 6 months of treatment, regression of EH occurs in 96% of women in the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) group versus 80% of women in the oral group (P < .001). Adverse effects were relatively common with minimal differences between the 2 groups. Intermenstrual vaginal spotting and amenorrhea were more common in the LNG-IUD group (P value .01 and .0001). Patient satisfaction was significantly higher in the LNG-IUS group (P value .0001). Hysterectomy rates were lower in the LNG-IUS group than in the oral group (P = .001). Recurrence rate was 0% in the LNG-IUD group compared to 12.5% in the oral group. In management of EH without atypia, LNG-IUS achieves a higher regression and a lower hysterectomy rate than oral progesterone and could be used as a first-line therapy.

Its influence on the rate of vulvovaginal infections and flora disturbance is insufficiently known, but important for contraceptive advice in women, especially those who develop recurrent vaginosis or Candida vulvovaginitis. Slides of 286 women who had a Pap smear taken before and 1 to 2 years after placement of a LNG-IUS were blindly reviewed for the presence of abnormal vaginal flora (AVF), bacterial vaginosis (BV), aerobic vaginitis (AV) and Candida vaginitis (CV). Prior to insertion, there were no differences in vaginal flora abnormalities between women using different kinds of contraception. LNG-IUS users did not have different rates of AVF, BV, AV or CV, but the general risk to develop any infection was increased. Uterine bleeding after insertion did not seem to predict a different flora type. We found that Pap smears suggested more vaginal infections after 1 year of LNG-IUS use than prior to insertion of the device. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Limited available data suggested both of these methods are effective beyond that time. Demonstration of prolonged effectiveness will improve the cost-effectiveness of the device, and potentially patient continuation and satisfaction. We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of the contraceptive implant and the 52-mg hormonal intrauterine device in women using the method for 2 years beyond the current Food and Drug Administration-approved duration. We initiated this ongoing prospective cohort study in January 2012. We are enrolling women using the contraceptive implant or 52-mg levonorgestrel intrauterine device for a minimum of 3 and 5 years, respectively (started intrauterine device in â¥2007 or implant in â¥2009). Demographic and reproductive health histories, as well as objective body mass index, were collected. Implant users were offered periodic venipuncture for analysis of serum etonogestrel levels. The primary outcome, unintended pregnancy rate, was calculated per 100 woman-years. We analyzed baseline demographic characteristics using Ï 2 test and Fisher exact test, and compared serum etonogestrel levels stratified by body mass index using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Implant users (nÂ = 291) have contributed 444.0 woman-years of follow-up. There have been no documented pregnancies in implant users during the 2 years of postexpiration follow-up. Calculated failure rates in the fourth and fifth years for the implant are calculated as 0 (1-sided 97.5% confidence interval, 0-1.48) per 100 woman-years at 4 years and 0 (1-sided 97.5% confidence interval, 0-2.65) per 100 woman-years at 5 years.

The research encompassed 200 women aged between 30 and 45. 52 women using the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system were qualified to the study as the research group (Mirena Group). The control groups consisted of 48 women using a different type of intrauterine device (Control Group I--Other IUD) and 50 women using no contraception (Control Group II). A specific questionnaire with a general part concerning socio-demographic conditions, a part dealing with contraception and Polish version of self-evaluation inventories: Short Form-36 Health Survey, Female Sexual Function Index and Mell-Krat Scale was used as a research tool. Quality of life parameters for women using the Mirena system were higher than for the control groups, especially in the aspect of general health, energy/fatigue and emotional well-being. A significant beneficial effect of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system on sexual functioning (sexual desire and arousal) was also revealed in the study. Sexual dysfunctions were diagnosed in 20.8% of Other IUD, 34.7% of Control Group II and 9.6% of Mirena Group. Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system increases female quality of life and sexual functioning parameters.\n\nOpen randomised study of use of levonorgestrel releasing intrauterine system as alternative to hysterectomy\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLÃ¤hteenmÃ¤ki, Pekka; Haukkamaa, Maija; Puolakka, Jukka; Riikonen, Ulla; Sainio, Susanna; Suvisaari, Janne; Nilsson, Carl Gustaf\n\n1998-01-01\n\nObjectives: To assess whether the levonorgestrel intrauterine system could provide a conservative alternative to hysterectomy in the treatment of excessive uterine bleeding. Design: Open randomised multicentre study with two parallel groups: a levonorgestrel intrauterine system group and a control group. Setting: Gynaecology departments of three hospitals in Finland. Subjects: Fifty six women aged 33-49 years scheduled to undergo hysterectomy for treatment of excessive uterine bleeding. Interventions: Women were randomised either to continue with their current medical treatment or to have a levonorgestrel intrauterine system inserted. Main outcome measure: Proportion of women cancelling their decision to undergo hysterectomy. Results: At 6 months, 64.3% (95% confidence interval 44.1 to 81.4%) of the women in the levonorgestrel intrauterine system group and 14.3% (4.0 to 32.7%) in the control group had cancelled their decision to undergo hysterectomy (P<0.001). Conclusions: The use of the levonorgestrel intrauterine system is a good conservative alternative to hysterectomy in the treatment of menorrhagia and should be considered before hysterectomy or other invasive treatments.

We searched the Medline, Central and ICTRP databases for all articles published from inception through July 2013 that examined the following outcomes: uterine volume, uterine leiomyoma volume, endometrial thickness, then menstrual blood loss, blood haemoglobin, ferritin and hematocrit levels, treatment failure rate, device expulsion rate, hysterectomy rate and side effects. From 645 studies, a total of 11 studies met our inclusion criteria with sample sizes ranging from 10 to 104. Evidence suggested that levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems could decrease uterine volume and endometrial thickness, significantly reduce menstrual blood loss, and increase blood haemoglobin, ferritin and hematocrit levels. There was no evidence for decreasing uterine leiomyoma volume. There were no adverse effects on the ovarian function except for ovarian cysts. Device expulsion rates were low, which associated with leiomyoma size (larger than 3cm) but not with leiomyoma location. Irregular bleeding/spotting was observed at the beginning of the follow-up period and then decreased progressively. Results of this systematic review indicate that levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems may be effective and safe treatment for symptomatic uterine leiomyoma in premenopausal women.

It also has a variety of noncontraceptive benefits including treatment for menorrhagia, endometriosis, and endometrial hyperplasia. The LNG-IUS has also been used in combination with estrogen for hormone replacement therapy and as an alternative to hysterectomy. Overall, the system is very well tolerated and patient satisfaction is quite high when proper education regarding possible side effects is provided. However, despite all of the obvious benefits of the LNG-IUS, utilization rates remain quite low in the developed countries, especially in the United States. This is thought to be largely secondary to the persistent negative impressions from the Dalkon Shield intrauterine experience in the 1970s. This history continues to negatively influence the opinions of both patients and health care providers with regards to intrauterine devices. Providers should resolve to educate themselves and their patients on the current indications and uses for this device, as it, and intrauterine contraception in general, remains a largely underutilized approach to a variety of womenâs health issues.

Deep endometriosis can affect the urinary tract in 1-5% to 15-25% cases. Even though deep endometriosis' surgeries are usually complex with higher rate of complications, conservative management is not always considered as an option because of its high failure rates. This paper describes two cases of deep endometriosis with ureteric involvement (hydronephrosis) treated conservatively with a double-pigtail stent plus a Levonorgestrel intrauterine device, after conservative surgery, who remained symptom free with no evidence of recurrence at 3 years follow-up, avoiding radical high-risk surgery. Impact statement Several treatments have been described for endometriosis. From a symptomatic perspective, conservative medical management has been proposed with a variable response. Concerning deep endometriosis (affecting the urinary or digestive tract), the definitive treatment has always been thought to be radical surgery. However, this can lead to several complications. To illustrate a possible more conservative approach this paper describes two cases of deep infiltrating endometriosis affecting the ureter, treated conservatively with a temporary pigtail ureter stent plus a Levonorgestrel intrauterine device. The management demonstrates that, in a selected population, conservative treatment solves the urinary disease avoiding the surgical complications and, what is more, improving patients' symptoms in a permanent way. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm whether the introduction of this management in clinical practice would reduce the need for surgery thereby, avoiding high-risk surgery and improving the success rate of conservative management.\n\nLevonorgestrel Intrauterine Device Placement in a Premenopausal Breast Cancer Patient with a Bicornuate Uterus.\n\nPubMed\n\nEskew, Ashley M; Crane, Erin K\n\n2016-01-01\n\nYoung women with breast cancer face contraceptive challenges. Data are limited and conflicting on the use of the levonorgestrel intrauterine device (LNG-IUD) in this patient population. A 32-year-old nulligravid woman with a history of breast cancer on tamoxifen presented with new-onset vaginal bleeding. Further workup revealed a previously undiagnosed bicornuate uterus. She underwent hysteroscopy, dilation and curettage, and LNG-IUD placement in each uterine horn. Postoperative follow-up confirmed retention and proper placement of both IUDs. Pathology from the dilation and curettage was benign, and the abnormal uterine bleeding abated. LNG-IUD placement in a young patient with a personal history of breast cancer on tamoxifen and a bicornuate uterus is a safe and feasible alternative for contraception. Copyright Â© 2016 AAGL.

We performed uterine cervical dilation surgery in two patients with severe stenosis, followed by insertion of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system, which is used for dysmenorrhea or endometriosis-related pain because of its strong progesterone activity. Patient 1 was a 34-year-old Japanese woman who was diagnosed with dysmenorrhea caused by recurrent uterine cervical stenosis and hematometra after laser conization. Patient 2 was a 44-year-old Japanese woman who developed dysmenorrhea and prolonged menstruation caused by uterine cervical stenosis without hematometra. After providing informed consent, they underwent cervical dilation surgery followed by insertion of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system. After treatment, their symptoms immediately improved, and after removal of their devices, they remained asymptomatic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to confirm the usefulness and easy applicability of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system for uterine cervical stenosis. Although we had success with the method, this study of two patients is preliminary. Further study with larger numbers of patients is necessary to confirm the usefulness of our technique.\n\nComparison of human papillomavirus infection and cervical cytology in women using copper-containing and levonorgestrel-containing intrauterine devices.\n\nPubMed\n\nLekovich, Jovana P; Amrane, Selma; Pangasa, Misha; Pereira, Nigel; Frey, Melissa K; Varrey, Aneesha; Holcomb, Kevin\n\n2015-05-01\n\nTo investigate whether there is a difference in cervical cytology and high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection clearance between levonorgestrel- and copper-containing intrauterine device (IUD) users. The electronic medical record system was searched by the appropriate procedural code for IUD insertion for all patients undergoing IUD placement during the study period (January 31, 2005 to January 31, 2012). Patients who received treatment for cervical dysplasia, had their IUDs removed, or conceived during the study period were excluded. High-risk HPV and cervical cytology results immediately preceding and after IUD placement were obtained. One hundred fifty patients had a copper-containing and 152 patients a levonorgestrel-containing IUD placed. The groups were comparable in terms of age, body mass index, duration of follow-up, and percentage of smokers. Sixty-six patients were high-risk HPV-positive before IUD insertion (30 in copper compared with 36 in the levonorgestrel IUD group, P=.4), and the groups had similar follow-up times (364.1Â±26.3 compared with 357.2Â±29.7 days, respectively, between the IUD placement and a repeat Pap test with high-risk HPV cotesting, P=.2). Of those, 21 (70%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 53.6-86.4%) cleared the infection after copper-containing IUD placement compared with 15 (42%; 95% CI 25.6-57.8%) in the levonorgestrel group (P=.04). There were only two (1.7%) new high-risk HPV infections in the copper compared with eight (6.9%) in the levonorgestrel group (P=.056). Our data suggest that levonorgestrel-containing IUD could be associated with decreased high-risk HPV infection clearance and possibly increased acquisition compared with the copper-containing IUD. II.\n\nTwo low-dose levonorgestrel intrauterine contraceptive systems: a randomized controlled trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nNelson, Anita; Apter, Dan; Hauck, Brian; Schmelter, Thomas; Rybowski, Sarah; Rosen, Kimberly; Gemzell-Danielsson, Kristina\n\n2013-12-01\n\nTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of two low-dose levonorgestrel intrauterine contraceptive systems. Nulliparous and parous women aged 18-35 years with regular menstrual cycles (21-35 days) requesting contraception were randomized to 3 years of treatment with one of two levonorgestrel intrauterine contraceptive systems: 13.5 mg total content or 19.5 mg total content. The primary outcome was the pregnancy rate, calculated as the Pearl Index. Overall, 1,432 and 1,452 women in the 13.5 mg intrauterine contraceptive system and 19.5 mg intrauterine contraceptive system groups, respectively, had a placement attempted and were included in the full analysis set to evaluate efficacy and safety. Mean (standard deviation) age was 27.1 (4.8) years; 39.2% were nulliparous. Over the 3-year study period, 0.33 pregnancies per 100 women-years (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.16-0.60) were observed with the 13.5 mg intrauterine contraceptive system compared with 0.31 per 100 women-years (95% CI 0.15-0.57) with the 19.5 mg intrauterine contraceptive system. Kaplan-Meier estimates for that period were 0.009 and 0.010, respectively. At least partial expulsions occurred in 4.56% and 3.58% and discontinuation rates resulting from a reported adverse event occurred in 21.9% and 19.1%, respectively. Ten of the 20 pregnancies were ectopic. Serious adverse events included six cases of pelvic inflammatory disease and one partial uterine perforation. Both lower-dose levonorgestrel intrauterine contraceptive systems were highly effective for 3 years of use and generally well tolerated.

Study Design Women enrolling in a 2-month study who desired an IUD for contraception were randomized 1:1 to receive a levonorgestrel 52mg IUD (LNG-IUD) or copper T380A (Cu-IUD), understanding they could switch IUD type at the end of the study. Results Randomization to IUD type was acceptable to 54/55 (98%) women who screened. All 32 enrolled participants completed follow-up. Two women exchanged their IUD (Cu-IUD to LNG-IUD) and 2 requested removal (1 LNG-IUD, 1 Cu-IUD). Overall, 88% continued their assigned IUD. Conclusions Randomization to IUD type is feasible and few women change their IUD.

A modified Markov model was used to compare IUD placement at age 50 with usual care among women with a body mass index (BMI, kg/m) 40 or greater or BMI 30 or greater. The effects of obesity on incidence and survival were incorporated. The IUD was assumed to confer a 50% reduction in cancer incidence over 5 years. Costs of IUD and cancer care were included. Clinical outcomes were cancer diagnosis and deaths from cancer. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated in 2015 U.S. dollars per year of life saved. One-way and two-way sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo probabilistic analyses were performed. For a 50 year old with BMI 40 or greater, the IUD strategy is costlier and more effective than usual care with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $74,707 per year of life saved. If the protective effect of the levonorgestrel IUD is assumed to be 10 years, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio decreases to $37,858 per year of life saved. In sensitivity analysis, a levonorgestrel IUD that reduces cancer incidence by at least 68% in women with BMIs of 40 or greater or costs less than $500 is potentially cost-effective. For BMI 30 or greater, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of IUD strategy is $137,223 per year of life saved compared with usual care. In Monte Carlo analysis, IUD placement for BMI 40 or greater is cost-effective in 50% of simulations at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per year of life saved. The levonorgestrel IUD is a potentially cost-effective strategy for prevention of deaths from endometrial cancer in obese women.\n\nIs antibiotic prophylaxis mandatory after the insertion of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systemin order to decrease the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease?\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMunteanu, O; Radulescu, L; Bodean, O; Cirstoiu, C; Secara, D; Cirstoiu, M\n\n2013-01-01\n\nAbstract Objective: This study was undertaken in order to determine if antibiotic prophylaxis is mandatory, after the insertion of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system in order to decrease the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease. Materials and methods: We prospectively evaluated 44 patients, admitted in the Bucharest Emergency Hospital between the 1â± of February 2012 and the 1â± of October 2012, in whom the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system was inserted. The patients enrolled were divided into two groups. In group A, a number of 22 patients, received, after the insertion of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system, 875mg Amoxicillin Trihydrate + 125 mg Potassium Clavulanate, a dose every 12 hours for 5 days. Group B was represented by the other 22 patients who did not receive antibiotic prophylaxis. All patients were reevaluated at 4 and 12 weeks after the insertion of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system. Results: During the first 4 weeks after the insertion of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system only two patients, one from group A and one from group B were diagnosed with pelvic inflammatory disease. At a second follow up visit â 12 weeks after the insertion of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system, no other patient was diagnosed with pelvic inflammatory disease.

Only a few studies have evaluated the long-term effectiveness of the device for preventing endometrioma recurrence, and the effects of a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system as a maintenance therapy remain unclear. The objective of the study was to evaluate whether a maintenance levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system is effective for preventing postoperative endometrioma recurrence. From May 2011 through March 2012, a randomized controlled trial including 80 patients with endometriomas undergoing laparoscopic cystectomy followed by six cycles of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist treatment was conducted. After surgery, the patients were randomized to groups that did or did not receive a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (intervention group, nÂ = 40, vs control group, nÂ = 40). The primary outcome was endometrioma recurrence 30 months after surgery. The secondary outcomes included dysmenorrhea, CA125 levels, noncyclic pelvic pain, and side effects. Endometrioma recurrence at 30 months did not significantly differ between the 2 groups (the intervention group, 10 of 40, 25% vs the control group 15 of 40, 37.5%; hazard ratio, 0.60, 95% confidence interval, 0.27-1.33, PÂ = .209). The intervention group exhibited a lower dysmenorrhea recurrence rate, with an estimated hazard ratio of 0.32 (95% confidence interval, 0.12-0.83, PÂ = .019). Over a 30 month follow-up, the intervention group exhibited a greater reduction in dysmenorrhea as assessed with a visual analog scale score (mean Â± SD, 60.8 Â± 25.5 vs 38.7 Â± 25.9, P < .001, 95% confidence interval, 10.7-33.5), noncyclic pelvic pain visual analog scale score (39.1 Â± 10.9 vs 30.1 Â± 14.7, PÂ =Â .014, 95% confidence interval, 1.9-16.1), and CA125 (median [interquartile range], -32.1 [-59.1 to 14.9], vs -15.6 [-33.0 to 5\n\nTwo-year continuation of intrauterine devices andÂ contraceptive implants in a mixed-payer setting:Â aÂ retrospective review.\n\nPubMed\n\nSanders, Jessica N; Turok, David K; Gawron, Lori M; Law, Amy; Wen, Lonnie; Lynen, Richard\n\n2017-06-01\n\nAs the popularity of long-acting reversible contraception increases, so does the need for accurate data on method continuation in diverse clinical settings. We determined 2-year continuation rates for the levonorgestrel 52-mg intrauterine device, the copper T380A intrauterine device, and the 68-mg etonogestrel contraceptive implant in an academic healthcare system with mixed-payer reimbursement. The purpose of this study was to examine the proportion and characteristics of women who continue intrauterine device and implant use to 2 years and to relate continuation to device type when controlling for patient characteristics. This retrospective chart review assessed University of Utah Healthcare System patients who had an intrauterine device or contraceptive implant inserted between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2012. We identified users and dates of insertions and removals by querying billing, medication, and procedural data in the Electronic Data Warehouse. Multivariable Poisson regression was conducted to estimate incidence risk ratios and to relate the probability of 2-year continuous use to device type. Data on 8603 device insertions were obtained with theÂ following distribution: levonorgestrel 52-mg intrauterine devicesÂ (6459; 75.1%), copper T380A intrauterine devices (1136;Â 13.2%), and 68-mg etonogestrel implant (1008; 11.7%). Two-year continuation rates were 77.8%, 73.1%, and 75.9%, respectively. There was no statistical difference in 2-year continuation between levonorgestrel 52-mg intrauterine device users (adjusted risk ratio, 1.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.1) and 68-mg etonogestrel implant users (adjusted risk ratio, 1.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.1) compared with copper device users, after we controlled for age, Hispanic ethnicity, payer type, and year of insertion. Older-age, self-pay, or public payer insurance (reference commercial payer) and Hispanic ethnicity were associated with 2-year continuation.

A multinational, prospective, non-interventional cohort study of new users of LNG IUS and copper IUDs was performed. Following a baseline survey, study participants and their physicians completed one follow-up questionnaire after 12 months. A multifaceted four-level follow-up procedure minimized loss to follow-up. Patient-reported outcomes were validated by the treating physicians. A total of 61,448 women with a newly inserted IUD were enrolled in six European countries between 2006 and 2012. The copper IUD cohort contained more than 30 different types. Validated 1-year follow-up information for 58,324 users between 18 and 50 years of age (70% using LNG IUS, 30% using copper IUDs) was collected. A total of 118 contraceptive failures occurred (26 LNG, 92 copper). Both types of IUD were highly effective, with overall Pearl indices of 0.06 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.04-0.09] and 0.52 (95% CI: 0.42-0.64) for LNG IUS and copper IUDs, respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio for LNG IUS vs. copper IUDs was 0.16 (95% CI: 0.10-0.25). Tenty-one pregnancies (7 LNG IUS, 14 copper IUD) were ectopic, yielding an adjusted hazard ratio for ectopic pregnancy of 0.26 (95% CI: 0.10-0.66). The contraceptive failure rate was low with both IUDs. However, the LNG IUS was associated with a significantly lower risk of pregnancy, including ectopic pregnancy, than the copper IUDs. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale, multinational, prospective epidemiological study to measure and compare the contraceptive effectiveness of LNG IUSs and copper IUDs during routine clinical practice.

Cost-effectiveness model using efficacy and discontinuation data from published articles. Societal perspective including direct and indirect costs. Women at risk of unintended pregnancy using reversible contraception. An economic analysis was conducted by modeling the different health states of women using contraception over a 3-year period. Typical use efficacy rates from published articles were used to determine unintended pregnancy events. Discontinuation rates were used to account for method switching. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated in terms of the incremental cost per unintended pregnancy avoided. In addition, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year was calculated. Levonorgestrel intrauterine system 13.5 mg generated costs savings of â¬ 311,000 in a cohort of 1000 women aged 15-44 years. In addition, there were fewer unintended pregnancies (55 vs. 294) compared with women using oral contraception. Levonorgestrel intrauterine system 13.5 mg is a cost-effective method when compared with oral contraception. A shift in contraceptive use from oral contraception to long-acting reversible contraception methods could result in fewer unintended pregnancies, quality-adjusted life-year gains, as well as cost savings.

Of 32 evaluable patients at the 6-month time point, 15 had complex atypical hyperplasia (47%), nine had G1 endometrial cancer (28%), and eight had grade 2 endometrial cancer (25%). Overall response rate was 75% (95% CI 57-89) at 6 months; 80% (95% CI 52-96) in complex atypical hyperplasia, 67% (95% CI 30-93) in grade 1 endometrial cancer, and 75% (CI 35-97) in grade 2 endometrial cancer. Of the clinicopathologic features evaluated, there was a trend toward the association of lack of exogenous progesterone effect in the pathology specimen with nonresponse to the IUD (P=.05). Median uterine diameter was 1.3 cm larger in women who did not respond to the IUD (P=.04). Levonorgestrel-releasing IUD therapy for the conservative treatment of complex atypical hyperplasia or early-grade endometrial cancer resulted in return to normal histology in a majority of patients.\n\nLevonorgestrel intrauterine system versus medical therapy for menorrhagia.\n\nPubMed\n\nGupta, Janesh; Kai, Joe; Middleton, Lee; Pattison, Helen; Gray, Richard; Daniels, Jane\n\n2013-01-10\n\nMenorrhagia is a common problem, yet evidence to inform decisions about therapy is limited. In a pragmatic, multicenter, randomized trial, we compared the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (levonorgestrel-IUS) with usual medical treatment in women with menorrhagia who presented to their primary care providers. We randomly assigned 571 women with menorrhagia to treatment with levonorgestrel-IUS or usual medical treatment (tranexamic acid, mefenamic acid, combined estrogen-progestogen, or progesterone alone). The primary outcome was the patient-reported score on the Menorrhagia Multi-Attribute Scale (MMAS) (ranging from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating greater severity), assessed over a 2-year period. Secondary outcomes included general quality-of-life and sexual-activity scores and surgical intervention. MMAS scores improved from baseline to 6 months in both the levonorgestrel-IUS group and the usual-treatment group (mean increase, 32.7 and 21.4 points, respectively; P<0.001 for both comparisons). The improvements were maintained over a 2-year period but were significantly greater in the levonorgestrel-IUS group than in the usual-treatment group (mean between-group difference, 13.4 points; 95% confidence interval, 9.9 to 16.9; P<0.001). Improvements in all MMAS domains (practical difficulties, social life, family life, work and daily routine, psychological well-being, and physical health) were significantly greater in the levonorgestrel-IUS group than in the usual-treatment group, and this was also true for seven of the eight quality-of-life domains. At 2 years, more of the women were still using the levonorgestrel-IUS than were undergoing the usual medical treatment (64% vs. 38%, P<0.001). There were no significant between-group differences in the rates of surgical intervention or sexual-activity scores. There were no significant differences in serious adverse events between groups.

Laparoscopic ligature is safe, but invasive and with possible surgical and anesthetic risks. The hysteroscopic approach enables tubal occlusion at outpatient's setting without the need of incisions or anesthesia. A microdevice (EssureÂ®) is inserted directly into the tubes and its polyethelene fibers cause obstruction of tubes in about three months. During this period, it is recommended that patients continue the use of a temporary birth control method. Several women use the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system, which is called in the market as MirenaÂ®. This report evaluated the possibility of inserting EssureÂ® without remove the intrauterine device; patient tolerance to the procedure was also assessed. The tubal device was successfully placed in the patient without the need to remove MirenaÂ®. After three months the intrauterine device was removed with no intercurrent events.

Three patients presenting with a missing LNG-IUS on examination and pelvic ultrasound are presented. A preoperative CT scan was performed, what helped in a successful removal of the LNG-IUS. The patients were discharged home the same day of the procedure. Our cases reinforce, besides the diagnosis of a migrated LNG-IUS by ultrasound, the fact that preoperative CT scan imaging assists in the diagnosis of the precise location of a migrated LNG-IUS into the pelvic/abdominal cavity and helps the physician in the prediction of the difficulty of the laparoscopic removal.\n\nLevonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system and the risk of breast cancer: A nationwide cohort study.\n\nPubMed\n\nSoini, Tuuli; Hurskainen, Ritva; GrÃ©nman, Seija; MÃ¤enpÃ¤Ã¤, Johanna; Paavonen, Jorma; Joensuu, Heikki; Pukkala, Eero\n\n2016-01-01\n\nProlonged steroid hormone therapy increases the risk of breast cancer, especially the risk of lobular cancer, but the effect of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) use is controversial. In this study we aimed to test the hypothesis that risk for lobular breast cancer is elevated among LNG-IUS users. We identified from the national Medical Reimbursement Registry of Finland the women aged 30-49 who had used LNG-IUS for the treatment or prevention of menorrhagia in 1994-2007, and from the Finnish Cancer Registry breast cancers diagnosed before the age of 55 and by the end of 2012. A total of 2015 women had breast cancer diagnosed in a cohort of 93 843 LNG-IUS users during follow-up consisting of 1 032 767 women-years. The LNG-IUS users had an increased risk for both ductal breast cancer [standardized incidence ratio (SIR) 1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14-1.25] and for lobular breast cancer (SIR 1.33, 95% CI 1.20-1.46), as compared with the general female population. The highest risk was found in LNG-IUS users who purchased the device at least twice, whose SIR for lobular cancer was 1.73 (95% CI 1.37-2.15). The results imply that intrauterine administration of levonorgestrel is not only related to an excess risk of lobular breast cancer but also, in contrary to previous assumptions, to an excess risk of ductal breast cancer.\n\nIntrauterine device insertion in the postpartum period: a systematic review.\n\nPubMed\n\nSonalkar, Sarita; Kapp, Nathalie\n\n2015-02-01\n\nGiven new research on postpartum placement of levonorgestrel and copper intrauterine devices (IUDs), our objective was to update a prior systematic review of the safety and expulsion rates of postpartum IUDs. We searched MEDLINE, CENTRAL, LILACS, POPLINE, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases for articles between the database inception until July 2013. We included studies that compared IUD insertion time intervals and routes during the postpartum period. We used standard abstract forms and the United States Preventive Services Task Force grading system to summarise and assess the quality of the evidence. We included 18 articles. New evidence suggests that a levonorgestrel releasing-intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) insertion within 48 hours of delivery is safe. Postplacental insertion and insertion between 10 minutes and 48 hours after delivery result in higher expulsion rates than insertion 4 to 6 weeks postpartum, or non-postpartum insertion. Insertion at the time of caesarean section is associated with lower expulsion rates than postplacental insertion at the time of vaginal delivery. This review supports the evidence that insertion of an intrauterine contraceptive within the first 48 hours of vaginal or caesarean delivery is safe. Expulsion rates should be further studied in larger randomised controlled trials.\n\nManagement of initial bleeding or spotting after levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system placement: a randomized controlled trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nSÃ¸rdal, Terje; Inki, Pirjo; Draeby, John; O'Flynn, Mary; Schmelter, Thomas\n\n2013-05-01\n\nTo assess the efficacy of tranexamic acid or mefenamic acid in the management of the initial \"nuisance\" bleeding or spotting in the period immediately after placement of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system. Women were randomized after levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system placement to oral tranexamic acid (500 mg), mefenamic acid (500 mg), or placebo three times daily during bleeding or spotting episodes over a 90-day treatment period. Treatment was initiated from onset of a bleeding or spotting episode and continued until the first day after bleeding or spotting stopped and restarted with a new bleeding or spotting episode. The primary efficacy variable was reduction in the number of bleeding or spotting days. Tranexamic acid and mefenamic acid were compared with placebo using a one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Bonferroni-Holm adjustment was used to account for multiple testing. A total of 204 women were screened; 187 were randomized to tranexamic acid (n=63), mefenamic acid (n=63), or placebo (n=61). The median number of bleeding or spotting days experienced during treatment was 25, 29, and 33 days in the three groups, respectively. The median number of bleeding or spotting days was reduced by 6 days (95% confidence interval [CI] -14.0 to 1.0, P=.049) with tranexamic acid and by 3 days (95% CI -11.0 to 5.0, P=.229) with mefenamic acid compared with placebo. The relative risk of bleeding or spotting compared with placebo with tranexamic acid and mefenamic acid was 0.82 (95% CI 0.65-1.03) and 0.89 (95% CI 0.71-1.11), respectively. Most women (85% or more) were satisfied with the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system across the groups. Tranexamic acid and mefenamic acid during the first 90 days after levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system placement do not alleviate \"nuisance\" bleeding or spotting.

Areas Covered: This article will provide an overview of this new intrauterine system - its composition and its mechanisms of action as well as the results of the Phase II and III clinical trials of its efficacy, safety and tolerability. Expert Commentary: This new LNG-IUS 12 provides five-year contraceptive protection a pregnancy rate (less than 1%) in first year of use, which puts it into the top tier with the existing LNG-IUS 20 products; however, the LNG-IUS 12 does not have the high rates of amenorrhea often seen with the higher dose devices. On the other hand, this new IUD shares the smaller frame and narrower insertion tube with the lower dose LNG-IUS 8, but offers longer effective life.\n\nPostplacental or delayed levonorgestrel intrauterine device insertion and breastfeeding duration\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChen, Beatrice A.; Reeves, Matthew F.; Creinin, Mitchell D.; Schwarz, E. Bimla\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBACKGROUND The objective was to assess the effect of timing of postpartum levonorgestrel-releasing IUD insertion on breastfeeding continuation. STUDY DESIGN Women interested in using a levonorgestrel IUD postpartum were randomized to immediate postplacental insertion (postplacental group) or insertion 6â8 weeks after vaginal delivery (delayed group). Duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding were assessed at 6â8 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months postpartum. Only women who received an IUD were included in this analysis. RESULTS Breastfeeding was initiated by 32/50 (64%) of women receiving a postplacental IUD and 27/46 (58.7%) of women receiving a delayed IUD (p=0.59). More women in the delayed group compared to the postplacental group continued to breastfeed at 6â8 weeks (16/46 vs 15/50, p=0.62), 3 months (13/46 vs 7/50, p=0.13), and 6 months postpartum (11/46 vs 3/50, p=0.02). The results did not differ when only women who initiated breastfeeding or only primiparous women with no prior breastfeeding experience were analyzed. CONCLUSIONS Immediate postplacental insertion of the levonorgestrel IUD is associated with shorter duration of breastfeeding and less exclusive breastfeeding. Further studies are needed of the effects of early initiation of progestin-only methods on womenâs lactation experience.

To provide comparative estimates of clinical outcomes after placement of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS), ablation, or hysterectomy for AUB. A PubMED search was done using combinations of search terms related to abnormal uterine bleeding, LNG-IUS, hysterectomy, endometrial ablation, cost-benefit analysis, cost-effectiveness, and quality-adjusted life years. Full articles published in 2006-2016 available in English comparing at least two treatment modalities of interest among women of reproductive age with AUB were included. A decision tree was generated to compare clinical outcomes in a hypothetical cohort of 100Â 000 premenopausal women with nonmalignant AUB. We evaluated complications, mortality, and treatment outcomes over a 5-year period, calculated cumulative quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and conducted probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system had the highest number of QALYs (406Â 920), followed by hysterectomy (403Â 466), non-resectoscopic ablation (399Â 244), and resectoscopic ablation (395Â 827). Ablation had more treatment failures and complications than LNG-IUS and hysterectomy. Findings were robust in probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system and hysterectomy outperformed endometrial ablation for treatment of AUB.

However, exercise-induced oedema has not been described before. A 38-year-old woman presented with symptoms of diffuse, exercise-induced oedema and dyspnoea. Tests for heart failure and other causes of oedema showed no abnormalities. All symptoms resolved spontaneously after the patient initiated removal of the IUD. The pathophysiology of exercise-induced oedema is still poorly understood. When confronted with a patient with oedema (induced by exercise or other cause), the most common causes must first be excluded. If no explanation can be found, then the effects of medication must not be overlooked.\n\nPain perception during levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device insertion in nulliparous women: a systematic review.\n\nPubMed\n\nAnthoulakis, Christos; Iordanidou, Eirini; Vatopolou, Anastasia\n\n2018-06-08\n\nIntrauterine devices (IUDs) still remain underused in adolescents. Pain during insertion may prevent adolescents to opt for a levonorgestrel (LNG) - releasing IUD. This study aimed to conduct a systematic review, following the PRISMA guidelines, and critically appraise published data with respect to the efficacy of various substances (analgesics or not) in preventing pain during LNG-IUD insertion in nulliparous women as a proxy for adolescents. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, INTERVENTIONS, AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A comprehensive computerized systematic literature search of all English language studies between 2006 and 2016 was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Evidence Based Medicine Reviews (Cochrane Database and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), and Google Scholar. Relevant article reference lists were hand searched. Computerised database search revealed 31 citations of relevance, 9 of which with a total of 355 treated women and 345 controls fulfilled the inclusion/exclusion criteria. In women treated with misoprostol (n=150) versus placebo (n=145), the median visual analog scale (VAS) score Â± standard deviation (SD) were 5.7 Â± 2.1 versus 5.1 Â± 2.2, respectively. In the abovementioned population, there was a non-significant change in VAS score (OR=1.44, 95%CI 0.86-2.40). In women treated with lidocaine (n=140) versus placebo (n=136), the median VAS score Â± SD were 4.6 Â± 2.1 versus 5.8 Â± 2, respectively. In the aforementioned population, there was a significant decrease in VAS score (OR=0.12, 95%CI 0.02-0.91). In nulliparous women, lidocaine treatment seems to be a reasonable choice. However, further studies are required to examine the different routes and modes of administration as well as optimal quantities. Copyright Â© 2018.

This cohort study enrolled 188 women who presented at a single family planning clinic in Utah between June 2013 and September 2014 and selected either the Cu T380A IUD or LNG 52 mg IUD plus oral LNG for EC. Trained personnel followed participants by phone, text or e-mail for 12 months or until discontinuation occurred. We assessed reasons for discontinuation and used Cox proportional hazard models, Kaplan-Meier estimates and log-rank tests to assess differences in continuation rates between IUDs. One hundred seventy-six women received IUDs; 66 (37%) chose the Cu T380A IUD and 110 (63%) chose the LNG 52 mg IUD plus oral LNG. At 1 year, we accounted for 147 (84%) participants, 33 (22%) had requested removals, 13 (9%) had an expulsion and declined reinsertion, 3 (2%) had a pregnancy with their IUD in place and 98 (67%) were still using their device. Continuation rates did not differ by IUD type; 60% of Cu T380A IUD users and 70% of LNG 52 mg IUD plus oral LNG users were still using their device at 12 months (adjusted hazard ratio 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.40-1.3). Two-thirds of women who chose IUD placement at the EC clinical encounter continued use at 1 year. Women initiating Cu T380A IUD and LNG 52 mg IUD had similar 1-year continuation rates. These findings support same-day insertion of IUDs for women who are seeking EC and would like to use a highly effective reversible method going forward. Providing IUD options for EC users presents an opportunity to increase availability of highly effective contraception. Copyright Â© 2017.

This was an open-label 7-year randomized controlled trial in 20 centres, 11 of which in China. Data on 1884 women with interval insertion of the LNG-IUD and 1871 of the TCu380A were analysed using life tables with 30-day intervals and Cox proportional hazards models. The cumulative 7-year pregnancy rate of the LNG-IUD was 0.5 (standard error 0.2) per 100, significantly lower than 2.5 (0.4) per 100 of the TCu380A, cumulative method discontinuation rates at 7 years were 70.6 (1.2) and 40.8 (1.3) per 100, respectively. Dominant reasons for discontinuing the LNG-IUD were amenorrhea (26.1 [1.3] per 100) and reduced bleeding (12.5 [1.1] per 100), particularly in Chinese women and, for the TCu380A, increased bleeding (9.9 [0.9] per 100), especially among non-Chinese women. Removal rates for pain were similar for the two intrauterine devices (IUDs). Cumulative rates of removal for symptoms compatible with hormonal side effects were 5.7 (0.7) and 0.4 (0.2) per 100 for the LNG-IUD and TCu380A, respectively, and cumulative losses to follow-up at 7 years were 26.0 (1.4) and 36.9 (1.3) per 100, respectively. The LNG-IUD and the TCu380A have very high contraceptive efficacy, with the LNG-IUD significantly higher than the TCu380A. Overall rates of IUD removals were higher among LNG-IUD users than TCu380A users. Removals for amenorrhea appeared culturally associated. The 52-mg LNG-IUD and the TCu380A have very high contraceptive efficacy through 7 years. As an IUD, the unique side effects of the LNG-IUD are reduced bleeding, amenorrhea and symptoms compatible with hormonal contraceptives. Copyright Â© 2016.

We conducted a randomized controlled trial of naproxen, estradiol, or placebo that was administered over the first 12 weeks of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system use. Participants completed a written bleeding diary. We imputed missing values and performed an intention-to-treat analysis. There were 129 women who were assigned randomly to naproxen (n = 42 women), estradiol (n = 44 women), or placebo (n = 43 women). The naproxen group was more likely to be in the lowest quartile of bleeding and spotting days compared with placebo (42.9% vs 16.3%; P = .03). In the multivariable analysis, the naproxen group had a 10% reduction in bleeding and spotting days (adjusted relative risk, 0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.84-0.97) compared with placebo. More frequent bleeding and spotting was observed in the estradiol group (adjusted relative risk, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-1.34). The administration of naproxen resulted in a reduction in bleeding and spotting days compared with placebo. Copyright Â© 2012 Mosby, Inc.

Materials and Methods: Seventy women between 30 and 55 years with AUB were included in a study conducted over a period of 3 years. Response was assessed monthly for first 4 months and then yearly for maximum 2 years. Results: Mirena caused a 80% decrease in median menstrual blood loss (MBL) at 4 months, 95% decrease in MBL by 1 year, and 100% decrease (amenorrhea) by 2 years. Mean hemoglobin (Hb) % showed a significant rise of 7.8% from baseline 4 months post Mirena insertion. Mirena acted as an effective contraceptive in women not using any other form of contraception. Hysterectomy could be avoided in most of the women. Conclusion: Mirena provides an incredible nonsurgical alternative in treatment of menorrhagia. Its effects are reversible and it is an excellent fertility-sparing device. It is also an effective contraceptive.

We sought to evaluate the relationship of Chlamydia and gonorrhea screening to pelvic infection for up to 2 years following placement of the levonorgestrel 52-mg intrauterine system. A total of 1751 nulliparous and multiparous females 16 to 45 years old enrolled in a multicenter trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a new levonorgestrel intrauterine system for up to 7Â years. Participants had Chlamydia screening at study entry and yearly if they were age â¤25 years. Women also had baseline gonorrhea screening if testing had not been performed since starting their current sexual relationship. Those who changed sexual partners during the trial had repeated Chlamydia and gonorrhea testing. Intrauterine system insertion could occur on the same day as screening. Participants did not receive prophylactic antibiotics for intrauterine system placement. Investigators performed pelvic examinations after 12 and 24 months and when clinically indicated during visits at 3, 6, and 18 months after placement and unscheduled visits. Pelvic infection included any clinical diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease or endometritis. Most participants (nÂ = 1364, 79.6%) did not have sexually transmitted infection test results available prior to intrauterine system placement. In all, 29 (1.7%) participants had positive baseline testing for a sexually transmitted infection (Chlamydia, nÂ = 25; gonorrhea, nÂ = 3; both, nÂ = 1); 6 of these participants had known results (all with Chlamydia infection) prior to intrauterine system placement and received treatment before enrollment. The 23 participants whose results were not known at the time of intrauterine system placement received treatment without intrauterine system removal and none developed pelvic infection.

Analysis groups of 86 women in each arm were needed to demonstrate a 20% difference in any breastfeeding. Thirty-five women were randomized to the early (N=17) and standard (N=18) arms. The combination of unsuccessful placement (2/17; 12%), expulsions (7/17; 41%) and removals (3/17; 18%) reached 71% (12/17) in the early arm, so the study was stopped. In our small study cohort, levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system insertion between 6 and 48 h after vaginal birth was associated with a high rate of expulsion or removal soon after insertion.

Nulliparous and parous women aged 16-45 years at enrollment with regular menstrual cycles and requesting contraception were enrolled in an open-label, partially randomized trial to evaluate LNG20. The primary outcome was pregnancy rate for women aged 16-35 years calculated as the Pearl Index. Women aged 36-45 years received LNG20 for safety evaluation only. All participants had in-person or phone follow-up approximately every 3 months during the study. A total of 1600 women aged 16-35 years and 151 women aged 36-45 years agreed to LNG20 placement, including 1011 (57.7%) nulliparous and 438 (25.1%) obese women. Successful placement occurred in 1714 (97.9%) women. Six pregnancies occurred, four of which were ectopic. The Pearl Index for LNG20 was 0.15 (95% CI 0.02-0.55) through Year 1, 0.26 (95% CI 0.10-0.57) through Year 2, and 0.22 (95% CI 0.08-0.49) through Year 3. The cumulative life-table pregnancy rate was 0.55 (95% CI 0.24-1.23) through 3 years. Expulsion was reported in 62 (3.5%) participants, most (50 [80.6%]) during the first year of use. Of women who discontinued LNG20 and desired pregnancy, 86.8% conceived spontaneously within 12 months. Pelvic infection was diagnosed in 10 (0.6%) women. Only 26 (1.5%) LNG20 users discontinued due to bleeding complaints. The LNG20 intrauterine system is highly effective and safe over 3 years of use in nulliparous and parous women. A new 52-mg levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system is effective and safe for nulliparous and parous women for at least 3 years. Copyright Â© 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

One hundred and thirteen patients with displaced LNG-IUS presenting with irregular uterine bleeding, pelvic pain or asymptomatic displacement were recruited for hysteroscopic examination. Displaced LNG-IUS was relocated by hysteroscopic intervention and the effect on symptoms and LNG-IUS position was followed. The displaced LNG-IUS was successfully relocated by hysteroscope in 112 (99.1%) of 113 cases. Following LNG-IUS relocation, 71 (79.8%) patients of 89 with preoperative irregular uterine bleeding had amenorrhea or vaginal spotting, and 14 of 15 (93.3%) patients with preoperative pelvic pain became asymptomatic. LNG-IUS expulsion was recorded in two patients 7 and 21 days after hysteroscopy. Displaced LNG-IUS can cause clinical symptoms (e.g. irregular bleeding, pain). Hysteroscopic relocation of displaced LNG-IUS is a feasible method in the management of these symptoms. Risk of spontaneous expulsion associated with hysteroscopy is low. Â© 2013 The Authors.

The levonorgestrel releasing intrauterine system with daily average release of 20 mcg (LNG-IUS 20) is the popular choice because of its favorable bleeding patterns and many noncontraceptive benefits. A three year (LNG-IUS 8) became available three years ago. More recently, the LNG-IUS 12 was added. This new IUD shares a smaller frame, narrow inserter and lower rate of amenorrhea with the LNG-IUS 8, but it offers the five years of contraceptive protection of the LNG-IUS 20. Areas covered: This article provides information on the contraceptive efficacy, safety and tolerability of this new IUS based on approximately 60,000 cycles of use. Where available, the impacts of subject age, parity and body mass index (BMI) on study outcomes are reported. Expert opinion: This new LNG-IUS 12 with mid-dose hormone levels, smaller frame and longer effective life fills a niche that may better meet the needs of women who might appreciate the narrow insertion tube and/or the lower rates of amenorrhea. Cost will ultimately help determine success.\n\nIntrauterine levonorgestrel delivery with frameless fibrous delivery system: review of clinical experience\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWildemeersch, Dirk; Andrade, Amaury; Goldstuck, Norman D; Hasskamp, Thomas; Jackers, Geert\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe concept of using a frameless intrauterine device (IUD) instead of the conventional plastic framed IUD is not new. Frameless copper IUDs have been available since the late 1990s. They rely on an anchoring system to retain in the uterine cavity. The clinical experience with these IUDs suggests that frameless IUDs fit better as they are thin and, therefore, do not disturb or irritate the uterus. High tolerance and continuation rates have been achieved as complaints of pain are virtually nonexistent and the impact on menstrual blood loss is minimal. Conventional levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems (LNG-IUSs) are very popular as they significantly reduce menstrual bleeding and provide highly effective contraception. However, continuation of use remains problematic, particularly in young users. Total or partial expulsion and displacement of the LNG-IUS also occur too often due to spatial incompatibility within a small uterine cavity, as strong uterine contractions originate, attempting to get rid of the bothersome IUD/IUS. If not expelled, embedment ensues, often leading to chronic pain and early removal of the IUD/IUS. Several studies conducted recently have requested attention to the relationship between the LNG-IUS and the endometrial cavity. Some authors have proposed to measure the cavity width prior to inserting an IUD, as many uterine cavities are much smaller than the currently existing LNG-IUSs. A frameless fibrous drug delivery system fits, in principle, in all uterine cavities and may therefore be preferable to framed drug delivery systems. This review examines the clinical performance, acceptability, and potential of the frameless LNG-IUS (FibroPlantÂ®) when used for contraception, treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhea, and endometrial suppression in women using estrogen replacement therapy, endometrial hyperplasia, and other gynecological conditions. The review concludes that FibroPlant LNG-IUS offers unique advantages in reducing\n\nUnprotected intercourse in the 2 weeks prior to requestingÂ emergency intrauterine contraception.\n\nPubMed\n\nSanders, Jessica N; Howell, Laura; Saltzman, Hanna M; Schwarz, E Bimla; Thompson, Ivana S; Turok, David K\n\n2016-11-01\n\nPrevious emergency contraception studies have excluded women who report >1 episode of unprotected or underprotected intercourse. Thus, clinical recommendations are based on exposure to a single episode of underprotected intercourse. We sought to assess the prevalence and timing of underprotected intercourse episodes among women requesting emergency contraception and to examine the probability of pregnancy following an emergency contraception regimen including placement of either a copper intrauterine device or a levonorgestrel intrauterine device with simultaneous administration of an oral levonorgestrel pill in women reporting multiple underprotected intercourse episodes, including episodes beyond the Food and Drug Administration-approved emergency contraception time frame (6-14Â days). Women seeking emergency contraception who had a negative pregnancy test and desired either a copper intrauterine device or levonorgestrel emergency contraception regimen enrolled in this prospective observational study. At enrollment, participants reported the number and timing of underprotected intercourse episodes in the previous 14 days. Two weeks later, participants reported the results of a self-administered home pregnancy test. Of the 176 women who presented for emergency contraception and received a same-day intrauterine device, 43% (nÂ = 76) reported multiple underprotected intercourse episodes in the 14 days prior to presenting for emergency contraception. Women with multiple underprotected intercourse episodes reported a median of 3 events (range 2-20). Two-week pregnancy data were available for 172 (98%) participants. Only 1 participant had a positive pregnancy test. Pregnancy occurred in 0 of 97 (0%; 95% confidence interval, 0-3.7%) women with a single underprotected intercourse episode and 1 of 75 (1.3%; 95% confidence interval, 0-7.2%) women reporting multiple underprotected intercourse episodes; this includes 1 of 40 (2.5%; 95% confidence interval, 0-13.2%) women\n\nRelationship between uterine volume and discontinuation of treatment with levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine devices in patients with adenomyosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Ki Hwan; Kim, Jang Kew; Lee, Min A; Ko, Young Bok; Yang, Jung Bo; Kang, Byung Hun; Yoo, Heon Jong\n\n2016-09-01\n\nThis study is to evaluate the relationship between the uterine volume and the failure of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (LNG-IUD) in patients with adenomyosis. A total of 171 women with adenomysis were treated with LNG-IUD from November 2009 to December 2011. The amount of menorrhagia, degree of dysmenorrhea, and the uterine volume were compared before and after insertion of LNG-IUD, and the treatment failure of LNG-IUD was observed. The mean age of the participants was 42.5Â years (range 29-53Â years). The mean uterine volume was 158Â mL (range 46-769Â mL). Among the total participants, 37 (21.6Â %) discontinued the treatment prematurely. There were no different characteristics between the ongoing treatment group and treatment failure group with LNG-IUD. However, there was significant difference of uterine volume between two groups (178Â Â±Â 14 and 141Â Â±Â 7Â mL, PÂ =Â 0.010). Based on the receiver operator characteristic analysis, the optimum cutoff value of uterine volume more than 150Â mL was significantly associated with failure of LNG-IUD (area under curve: 0.763, 95Â % CI 0.669-0.856). In univariate analysis, the uterine volume more than 150Â mL was the only independent factor for the failure of LNG-I"
