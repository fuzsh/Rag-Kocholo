Professor of Blockchain in Information Sciences at the University of South Carolina, Validide leverages advanced emerging technologies such as AI, HI, cryptography, and blockchain to provide individuals with a decentralized cryptographic digital wallet system for daily use. Industry Overview Overall Identity Management is a • $24 billion Total Addressable Market • $15 billion ID Serviceable Market • $5 billion ID Attainable Market • Industry is Focused is on the Corporate Client, not the Individual • Ripe for M&A, SPAC, or Rollup Marketing & Sales Operations • Three Channels of Revenue • Fee for Service and Subscription • Exposure Based Growth Model • Performance Based Sales Model Validide is advancing the worldwide trend for Self-Sovereign Identity and the decentralized control of Personal Identity Information by the Individual. Validide enables people to move their identity from the physical and centralized world to today’s advanced digital world, both safely and securely. Use Cases • Age Verification • Employment Verification • Education Validation • Know Your Customer (KYC) • COVID Status / Vaccine Verification • Secure Messaging • Peer to Peer Payments • State Driver’s Status • Voter Registration • Much More Funding Stages Open & Future • $25K of $125,000 Grant Potential • $85K of $210,000 Friends & Family (20% Disc) • $5 Million Convertible Note • Follow-on Series Leveraging the cryptographic encryption patents of our CTO, Josiah Umezurike, and his company, LokDon, as our development partner, Validide verifies your information based on the strength of a collection of evidence to convert the information into VCs so you may share your Personal Identity Information when validated data is required.\n\n2. I thought you may enjoy a bit of my song, Blockchain Movement that we produced back in 2018 to celebrate the successes of the blockchain world at the time. I also use the full song as a teaching tool for my students. As we speak about our startup, Validide, you will understand the power of blockchain and artificial intelligence that we leverage so that you can Be Future Proof by Owning your Identity. 1\n\n3. All Rights Reserve © Validide ™ 2 Due to COVID, nearly every aspect of life is shifting to digital. 2\n\n4. All Rights Reserve © Validide ™ 3 Just last week, the EU presented the future adoption of open standards for holding government credentials for identity such as driver’s licenses and passports. This will allow any EU Validide customer to be able to hold their official EU member government credentials in their Validide Wallet. 3\n\n5. All Rights Reserve © Validide ™ 4 Apple has not only given their iOS users more control over the sharing of their data with other apps; but they are working to open their wallet to government credentials such as state ID and driver’s licenses. This is great for Validide because Apple will use their strength and money to open the highly controlling state DMVs so Apply users can hold their ID, but and once they do, Validide plays our personal data and consent card to require the DMV also share our members’ DMV records with the respective individual’s Validide Wallet. You gotta love when you can piggy back off the big boys’ work! 4\n\n6. All Rights Reserve © Validide ™ 5 We all know today’s world is centralized and hackable. One of the first items you received upon birth was a government issued Social Security Number as a form of identification that has followed you throughout your life. It is now the bane of your identity, and the number one item hackers search for. It is also on an average of 100 databases from the credit bureaus, doctors' offices, to former employers, schools, and banks. No one purges this stuff. In 2020 alone, 49 million US citizens fell victim to Identity Fraud and cost them and the corporations around $56 Billion. And following on the words of Benjamin Franklin; nothing is certain in America today but Death, Taxes, and now Hacks. 5\n\n7. All Rights Reserve © Validide ™ 6 What if we could put control of your identity in your hands making it virtually impossible to hack for your data so you can dictate how much personal information you share when you want to? 6\n\n8. All Rights Reserve © Validide ™ 7 Validide is helping people move their identity from the physical and centralized world to today’s advanced digital world, both safely and securely. As a matter of fact, when I was teaching blockchain at USC last semester, my student Erica Barnette, who is now a co- founder of Validide, brought up a scary scenario that immediately made me think of my own daughter’s security. 7\n\n9. All Rights Reserve © Validide ™ 8 Imagine this is your daughter and she is being carded by the bartender. When she hands over her State ID, she is giving away more information than he needs to serve her. He doesn’t need to know her name, her home address, or even her actual birth date. All he needs is proof she is over 21. Now, this is both a personal safety issue AND an identity theft issue. This is the essence of Validide, prove your identity without sharing TOO much of your personal information and keep the rest securely locked away in your digital wallet. 8\n\n10. All Rights Reserve © Validide ™ 9 Verifier Validide Customer submits info for verification Holder Institutions send their issued Credential to Validide Issuer 3 Validide converts credential into an immutable Verifiable Credential (VC) Customer shares PII as a Trusted VC as needed Receiver Validide Burns the PII (deletes) from our Servers so there is no “Honey Pot” for Hackers All records are stored in the Wallet, no PII is Stored at Validide The first thing you do as our customer, is scan the front and back of your State ID. Then to prove it is you, our AI asks you to take a live selfie and compares that image with the one on your State ID. This launches your Validide account. From here you can request that we verify any aspect of issued information you wish to carry in your Validide Wallet. We take that request and reach out to the issuers of that information such as education, work history, a gov’t agency, or even health information you may wish to use in your wallet. The issuer verifies the information and sends us the credential. We then convert those credentials into what are called Verifiable Credentials which are encrypted, secured and made immutable or unchangeable. A major component our security protocols is what we call “Burn the PII”, in other words, we delete all your personal information off our servers so that we are not liable for creating a “Honey Pot” of personal data for hackers to target. Now, you are free to share your personal information and the receiver can trust that information without hiring a third-party middleman to validate it on their behalf. 9\n\n11. All Rights Reserve © Validide ™ 10 As the world shifts to Individual Control of our personal information, everyone will have a digital identity wallet so they can control the sharing of their personal data in everything they do in life. Your digital wallet could be connected to a central system like Google, Apple or Facebook… 10\n\n12. All Rights Reserve © Validide ™ 11 or it can be independent and decentralized! So, the question you’ll need to ask yourself is… WHO OWNS YOUR WALLET? 11\n\n13.

I am a PhD experienced in many emerging tech and startup projects. I served two tours with the 82nd Airborne Division. I have participated in three exits over my career, and I have been involved with cryptocurrency and blockchain since 2013 where I now teach blockchain at University of SC. I am also co-founder of PalmettoChain which is our 501c3 non-profit has been educating legislatures, commissioners, and statewide professional associations on the benefits of blockchain. I have been working on Validide fulltime since we first came up with the idea back in October. I expect Validide to be my life’s biggest venture, with the exception of my family of course. Validide is a startup by USC alumni including my co-founders Erica Barnette and Seth McGaugh. Erica was my best student last semester. She is a well recognized student leader at USC, and an Award Winner for Leadership in information sciences who is graduating in about a week… we expect as magna cum laud. She has been envisioning owning her own tech startup since she was a freshman. Seth was a runner-up in the finals of the McNair Institute/SC Blockchain Challenge last Fall where I met him. His idea is to build a supply chain solution for organic farming on the blockchain. I asked him to put that on hold for now and join us in Validide. Our acting CTO is Josiah Umezurike who holds three patents in cryptography and encryption; he and his firm LokDon is building our wallet as we speak. Spencer, Will, and Tony are all highly experience experts in their fields, and early builders and scalers of blockchain solutions. 12\n\n14.

You all know Dr. Dirk Brown of the McNair Institute for Entrepreneurship and Free Enterprise. He was our sponsor in StartupWind, the Silicon Valley virtual incubator that partners with universities across the country. Validide was chosen as on of six companies out of 100s of startups to be a member of their first Accelerator Cohort. We just graduated last Friday. The others bring their expertise, and we talk with them regularly. I have also started reaching out to my Citadel network to find backers and bankers who can help get Validide launched. One who I have invited as an advisor and investor is the CFO of a publicly traded company and several large raises. 14\n\n16.

I have spent much of my personal time researching and talking to my network while Erica’s research for her course project last semester directly benefited Validide. We have been hitting the national network of 1 Million Cups Communities conducting over 10 presentations so far with great feedback that has helped us tweak our idea and grow our opportunity. We also conducted a survey on LinkedIn focused solely on the benefits of a verified LinkedIn Profile where 400 people completed the survey with 42% indicating they would pay for such a basic service. We have plans for a more in-depth survey specific to the benefits they see in a decentralized cryptographic identity wallet system. 16\n\n18. All Rights Reserve © Validide ™ 17 ~$24.7B The identity management industry we are targeting is rapidly expanding to a 24 Billion Dollar Addressable Market. 17\n\n19. All Rights Reserve © Validide ™ 18 ~$15B ~$24.7B Of that, the identity security sector is a 15 billion dollar Serviceable Market 18\n\n20. All Rights Reserve © Validide ™ 19 ~$5B ~$15B ~$24.7B and our Attainable Market is Identity Verification where over 500 million background screenings were conducted in the US last year and that expected to increase dramatically as we rehire employees after COVID. US financial institutions also spent $528 million dollars on “Know Your Customer” requirements. 19\n\n21. All Rights Reserve © Validide ™ Pending 20 We do have competitors who are on a similar mission in this emerging field of serving the individual with decentralized identity services as illustrated by the group in the upper right. But, in order to serve the ultimate 7.5 billion people on earth, we will need a 1,000 more. The other three segments are support rolls to the Validide business model focused on transactional corporate services or platforms to enable the emerging market of Self Sovereign Identity. Validide’s intellectual property is in the utility of our processes of which we are defining IP; But our Secret Sauce is our hyper focus on individual customer service! We tell everybody, most of our competitors think 90% tech and 10% customer service; Validide is the exact opposite – we are 10% about the tech 90% solely and wholly focused on the customer experience, making them happy so they will be a customer for life. 20\n\n22. All Rights Reserve © ValidIDe ™ 21 2 2 Our primary revenues come from employers who are already paying for background screening, and other receivers who will pay us on a transactional basis such as restaurants and stadiums. Individual customers will also pay as they learn the benefits of having a Validide Wallet in their every day lives; and Finally, as the issuers of credentials see the cost savings of providing Verifiable Credentials, they will pay us to convert that information for them. 21\n\n23. All Rights Reserve © Validide ™ 22 Our proforma numbers are straight forward and more transactional in the beginning 22\n\n24. All Rights Reserve © Validide ™ Pending 23 moving to monthly subscriptions as we prove the value of our utility, continuous support, and customer service; but, so you understand… 23\n\n25. All Rights Reserve © Validide ™ 24 24 421,000 1,000,000 1,500,000 the $46 million in annual net revenue by end of year 4 is based on acquiring only 421,000 individual wallet holders. This is highly attainable, our expectation is that we will actually earn the trust of over 1,000,000 customers in that same period; And our Stretch Goal is 1.5 million customers which will bring us deep into 9 digitals of revenue and values the company a Unicorn. 24\n\n26. All Rights Reserve © Validide ™ 25 SC University Seniors = 50,000 College Town Residents = 1.5 million SC Employees = ~2.5 million Duplicate State by State across USA Leverage LinkedIn’s 675 Million Users LinkedIn is our primary online market because that is where both professional and corporate identity fraud and abuse is happening directed at individuals. We are building Local to grow Global - organically. We want South Carolina to be the first state in the nation to scale its citizens’ use of decentralized digital identity services. Once we build and prove the model works for South Carolina, we expect to grow and scale other states and internationally. We can also market directly on LinkedIn as these people and companies are our primary target demographic. 25\n\n27. All Rights Reserve © Validide ™ 26 33% 33% 33%    We’ve designed our share pools to narrow the founders’ holdings; so as a Benefit Corporation, we can share the company with our employees; with an equal outside investor pool. We have filed a Form D with the SEC letting them know that we are raising funds from Friends & Family with a 20% discount off the $1.00 share price through a SAFE agreement where we have raise $85,000. We were recently accepted in the South Carolina Research Authority fold with a $25,000 project development grant where we can apply for two more follow on grants totaling another $100,000. Next, we will purse angel and accredited investor funding, to include the SCRA’s first tranche of equity funding to come into the mix. We will then extend that raise on to a convertible note, Reg A or D. We will eventually have raised $5 million and that is all we’ll need to get through the first two years. From there the tech will be deployed and stable, and our user experience will be ready for scaling the company where we may need more investment for marketing and further product development. 26\n\n28. All Rights Reserve © Validide ™ 27 So as you think about “WHO OWNS YOUR WALLET?”; Know that Validide helps you move all your life’s credentials from your physical and centralized world to the security of a decentralized digital one. 27"
