Kabir Hassan, Mamunur Rashid, PhD, Darniya Prabu and Ahmed Sabit Title: Risk dimensions, risk clusters, and foreign direct investments in developing countries 50 Free online copies available before September 30, 2022 (use the link below). https://lnkd.in/geCcgjSF Abstract We analyse four risk dimensions of inward FDI alongside economic growth for forty-eight developing countries for the period 2000–2019 using Fixed Effects, and System GMM models. After controlling for potential endogeneity issues, the results show that economic growth and currency rate have robust positive effect on FDI inflows, whereas inflation rate and financial risk have negative impacts. Political risk both at the contemporaneous and lagged terms had inconsistent results. The nexus between FDI and risk dimensions emends significantly with the risk cluster analysis that finds a strong interplay among financial and currency risks having economic growth in the centre. Results suggest that countries with stable economic growth can cover for an extent (‘U’ shaped relationship) of inflation, currency, and financial risks. The worse possible countries are the ones with unstable political condition, which cannot be mitigated by higher economic growth. We propose a two-layer FDI decision typology that includes country-specific endogenous and non-country specific exogenous factors in primary and secondary layers, respectively. Using a location-risk typology, we relate our discussions on the locational advantage from the eclectic paradigm with the approaches to risk management in international investment.

Title: Covid-19 vaccines, rules, deaths, and tourism recovery 50 Free online copies available before July 15, 2022 (use the link below). https://lnkd.in/eA6df4gg Abstract This study explores whether vaccination coverage, social distancing rules, and COVID-19 death rate affect tourism recovery using data from 249 countries/territories. We used panel data regression techniques—namely Fixed-effects, Hausman-Taylor, and Instrumental Variables regressions for the empirical analysis. Results show that a higher vaccination coverage is not necessarily accompanied by a higher tourism recovery. Similarly, a higher level of stringency restriction hinders tourism recovery. Results also indicate that a lower death rate helps to promote tourism recovery in developed economies. These results suggest that vaccination coverage alone is not the magic bullet for restarting the tourism industry. Policymakers should consider a mix of effective vaccination administration accompanied by the use of therapeutics to lower the death rate.

Sharing a recent article published in Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Management, co-authored with Usman Khalid and Tan Chee Meng. Free online copies available before October 29, 2021 (use the link below). https://lnkd.in/gyJSJdJg This study examines whether panda diplomacy promotes Chinese outbound tourism flows. A gravity model of tourism outflows from China to 137 destination countries over the 1995–2018 period is used for the empirical analysis. The results indicate that destination countries that host pandas from China attract a substantial number of Chinese tourists compared to those that do not. This effect persists over time and is stronger in later years, particularly after three years of hosting pandas. The findings of this study suggest that destination countries that host pandas can enhance their international tourism attractiveness for tourists from China. This improvement can be realized by incorporating panda-themed international marketing campaigns, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDoes the level of a country's resilience moderate the link between the tourism industry and the economic policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic? Sharing a recent article published in Current Issues in Tourism, co-authored with Usman Khalid and Katarzyna Burzynska. 50 free online copies available (use the link below). https://lnkd.in/grtQkbx Abstract This study examines whether the level of a country's resilience to shocks moderates the link between the size of the tourism industry and the economic policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic using data from 113 countries. The findings suggest that countries with large tourism sectors responded more aggressively by using economic stimulus packages to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; however, the impact of the tourism sector is moderated by the country's resilience to shocks. The study also finds that both high level of economic resilience and high level of risk quality of a country moderate the link between the tourism sector and the economic policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings of the study suggest that tourism businesses in high resilient countries are better prepared to cope with the disruptive challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and thus needed less assistance from governments. Improving a country's resilience to shocks is an important strategy to minimize the impact of future negative shocks in the tourism sector. https://lnkd.in/g4i_2HB\n\nDo Regional Trade Agreements Enhance International Tourism Flows? Evidence from a Cross-Country Analysis Sharing a recent article published in Journal of Travel Research, co-authored with Usman Khalid and Katarzyna Burzynska. Abstract This study investigates the effect of regional trade agreements (RTAs)—including preferential and free trade agreements, customs unions, and common markets—on bilateral tourism flows. We explore these effects using a panel gravity data set of 163 destination countries, 171 source countries, and 13,589 country-pairs from 1995 to 2015. This is the first large cross-country study to undertake such an integrated analysis using the gravity framework. Results show that all types of RTAs have a positive and significant effect on bilateral tourism flows. The overall indicator of RTAs that captures the combined effect of all types of RTAs on bilateral tourism flows is also positive and significant, on average, as well as when different regions are separately evaluated. These findings underscore the importance of strong economic integration in fostering international tourism flows. Policies aimed at improving a country’s economic integration with other countries can help promote international tourism flows. https://lnkd.in/g9FBSmx\n\nThe Effect of Regional Trade Agreements on International Tourist Flows in the Middle East and Africa Sharing a recent book chapter published in Springer International, co-authored with Usman Khalid and Ogechi Adeola This chapter uses a gravity framework to analyse the effect of regional trade agreements (RTAs) on international tourist flows in MENA and SSA regions... While the literature is replete with studies indicating that RTAs help boost trade volumes among participating countries (Kagochi and Durmaz 2018; Ngepah and Udeagha 2018; Wandrei 2018; Okoro et al. 2020), little attention has been devoted to their impact on international tourist flows within SSA and MENA... https://lnkd.in/gyjcrMA\n\nThe Effect of Migration on International Tourism Flows: The Role of Linguistic Networks and Common Languages Sharing a recent publication in Journal of Travel Research co-authored with Usman Khalid and Katarzyna Burzynska. Abstract We investigate the effect of migration rates on international tourism flows and whether linguistic networks and common languages affect the relationship between migration rates and tourist flows. We utilize the gravity data set consisting of 166 origin and 30 destination countries, over the 1995–2010 period for the empirical analysis. The results show that increased migration rates lead to higher international tourism flows in destination countries. This effect becomes even stronger when the destination country has a larger linguistic network. Migration matters less, however, when a country-pair shares closer linguistic ties. The findings of this study will help to inform public, and tourism industry policies aimed at boosting sustainable tourism flows, especially post COVID-19 pandemic. Targeted immigration policies, such as those that seek to attract foreign workers with specific skill sets, tend to enlarge linguistic networks and contribute to multilingualism, which in turn can boost international ... https://lnkd.in/gcREpdp\n\nNatural disasters, trade openness and international tourism: the role of income levels across countries Sharing a recent publication in Tourism Recreation Research co-authored with Ogechi Adeola and Oludele Folarin. To download free online copy, use the eprint link below (50 free online copies of the article) https://lnkd.in/dPhBtUA ABSTRACT This study uses a gravity framework to investigate the effects of natural disasters and trade openness on bilateral tourism flows. This includes investigating the influence of income levels across countries in the underlying relationships. Results show that the effects of natural disasters and trade openness on tourism flows differ by income groups. For instance, population share affected by storms negatively affect tourism flows in low-income countries, whereas its effect in high-income countries is statistically insignificant. The results also indicate that the negative effect of volcanoes on tourism flows persists after a year in some income groups. Furthermore, trade openness promotes tourism flows in low-income countries, while its effect in high-income countries is statistically insignificant. Appropriate urban planning..."
