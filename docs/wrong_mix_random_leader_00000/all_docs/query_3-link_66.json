        "text": "His team is in the midst of the NBA playoffs.\n\nHe must have a million things on his mind. . . . What to do about Dwight Howard's free throws? How to convince Vince Carter to take the ball to the hole more. . . . How to stop Charlotte's guards from penetrating into the paint?\n\nAnd, so, what better time to ask Magic general manager Otis Smith to answer the question that is on everybody's mind:\n\nWould he draft homeboy Tim Tebow if he were running his hometown Jacksonville Jaguars?\n\nSmith laughs as if this is a joke.\n\nThis is no joke.\n\nThis is no laughing matter.\n\nThe future of the NFL in Jacksonville may depend upon it.\n\nWhy shouldn't Smith have an opinion on Tebow? He is, after all, one of the most astute talent evaluators in professional sports.\n\nIf the Magic can put a hockey guy in charge of drafting Dwight Howard, why not ask a respected NBA general manager about drafting Tim Tebow? Seriously, whose opinion are you going to trust more -- Todd McShay and Mel Kiper Jr. or Otis Smith?\n\nMcShay and Kiper have never played a minute of professional sports or made any draft pick that actually counted. Smith was a long-time NBA player who's been in the trenches of the war room and felt the pressure of making draft picks that might turn into multi-million-dollar busts.\n\nBesides Smith was born and raised in Jacksonville. He knows the city. He knows the people. He knows what the fans want. And they want Tebow, right Otis?\n\nSmith shakes his head.\n\n\"You can't take him just because you think you're going to sell tickets with him,\" Smith said. \"You don't run a franchise that way. It's Jacksonville. I've been there. I know the town. If you ain't winning, they ain't coming. The fans in Jacksonville aren't going to come to games just to watch Tebow sit by the Gatorade cooler.\n\n\"Pro sports is not a popularity contest. If it was, we would have picked Emeka Okafor instead of Dwight Howard. You put all of the prospects into whatever machine you have and draft according to your machine. You don't put them in your machine and then draft according to popularity.\"\n\nWith that said, Smith does question some of the so-called NFL draft \"experts\" who say Tebow's motion and mechanics are not conducive to being a success at the next level. He says you can't always draft by reading a book or watching a tape.\n\nIf that were the case, Jameer Nelson wouldn't have scored 32 points in Game 1 of the series against the Charlotte Bobcats because he wouldn't even be on the Magic roster. Even though Nelson, like Tebow, was a phenomenal college player, the book on him was that he was too small and didn't have the skill set and instincts to be an NBA point guard. Many experts said Nelson was more of a shooting guard in a point guard's body.\n\nLikewise, some NFL draft analysts say Tebow is more of a fullback masquerading as a quarterback. They say he doesn't read defenses well enough or have the proper throwing mechanics to play in the NFL.\n\nSmith is also not a fan of overanalyzing Tebow's unorthodox throwing motion just as he has never judged a shooter on the aesthetic quality of his shot. If that were the case, he never would have signed Rashard Lewis and his funky shooting motion to a $118 million contract.\n\n\"If the ball goes in the hole, I don't care how he shoots it,\" Smith says.\n\nSo,, Mr. Smith, what's your final analysis? What would you do if you were in the Jaguars' war room? Would you draft Tim Tebow or not?\n\nSmith, as you might expect, refuses to answer the question. It must be written somewhere in the Fraternal Order of GM's Handbook that general managers must stick together and not second-guess one another.\n\nBut, luckily, that didn't stop Magic coach Stan Van Gundy from giving his opinion about Tebow's draftability.\n\n\"Anybody who has played that big a role in winning that many games has got something; he's got something that allows him do that,\" Van Gundy says. \"It would be a tough call not to take him.\"\n\nThere you have it -- a basketball perspective on football.\n\nComing in June: We attempt to ask Bill Parcells who the Magic should take in the NBA draft."
