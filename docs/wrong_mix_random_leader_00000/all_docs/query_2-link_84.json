        "text": "How do you lead your team to a national championship? You start\n\nby eating a proper pregame meal. More precisely, you eat a\n\nproper pregame meal properly--the same way you've eaten every\n\nother pregame meal all season. That means exactly the same\n\nnumber of pieces of chicken, which, alas, on Monday afternoon,\n\nthe good people at the Plaza San Antonio hotel didn't seem to\n\nhave for their fastidious guest, Connecticut center Emeka\n\nOkafor.\n\nOkafor asked if he might have one more piece. As the\n\nkitchen tried to oblige, he waited patiently. The dining room\n\nemptied of coaches and teammates. The 6'10\" junior lay his head\n\non the table and briefly snoozed. Finally after 20 minutes the\n\nrequisite piece of chicken arrived. He had to complete the\n\ncycle he goes through, explained Ted Taigen, the Huskies'\n\nacademic adviser. He's very linear and meticulous. He sets\n\nthings out for himself and just follows through.\n\nConnecticut, 82-73 victors over Georgia Tech in the Alamodome on\n\nMonday night, had been, for much of the season, neither linear\n\nnor meticulous. The Huskies had been a maddening team of detours\n\nand stallouts, of shaky free throw shooting and inexplicable\n\nlosses. But throughout, bad back permitting, the lead Husky\n\nslogged indomitably forward. And in the title game, his\n\nchicken-fried wait over, Okafor led the way with 24 points and 15\n\nrebounds. Facing the rare center with a height advantage, the\n\nYellow Jackets' 7'1\" Luke Schenscher, Okafor tossed in field\n\ngoals that bookended the 21-6 first-half run on which the game\n\nturned. He added two blocked shots, and in Georgia Tech's 38%\n\nfield goal percentage there's an implication of uncounted\n\nalterations, intimidations and \"rearrangements,\" in the wonderful\n\nphrase of Dee Rowe, the former UConn coach. \"He's there,\" Rowe\n\nsays. \"Beware. And don't go there.\"\n\nThe world Okafor and his teammates now sit astride is lousy with\n\nshortcuts--Enron and Martha Stewart shortcuts; Baylor and Georgia\n\nand St. Bonaventure shortcuts--that might allow you to get to the\n\nLife and the Show, but in the end won't give you much to show for\n\nyour life. Okafor's instinct is to sight goals and reach them,\n\none after another. The ball is there; get it. A title is there;\n\nclaim it. The shortest distance between a man and his goal\n\nneedn't be a shortcut but the most direct legitimate distance. In\n\nhis family's native Igbo language, his given name Chukwuemeka\n\n(Emeka to an adoring state; Mek to his coach and teammates) means\n\nGod has done wonderfully well. That may sound like a burden, but\n\nOkafor treats it as prophecy.\n\nPeople close to Okafor carry around storehouses of tales about\n\nhim, and on Monday they spilled forth. When his sister, Nneka,\n\nrebounded for him on a playground in the heat of the Houston\n\nsummer, he had to plead with her to stay longer than the mere\n\nhour she could tolerate. When Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun\n\nsuggested during the preseason that Okafor take out a policy to\n\ninsure against a career-altering injury, he initially resisted,\n\ninsisting he'd be happy to use his brain to make a living. When\n\nhe had to write a term paper for his favorite college course, an\n\nhonors class called Roman Civilization, he chose as his topic the\n\nlife and culture of the ancient gladiators. \"Combat, man,\n\ncombat,\" he said after the title game, confirming that he\n\nidentifies with the noble warrior. \"Our lives were never at\n\nstake, but competition-wise, we'd go out and do battle. No guts,\n\nno glory.\"\n\nBack in December, Oklahoma coach Kelvin Sampson had declared that\n\nthe Huskies might be as good as any team his Sooners had played\n\nin the last 10 years. \"Expectations were so high that we were\n\nmade almost godlike,\" Calhoun says. \"People wrote that we weren't\n\ngoing to lose a game in the Big East.\" Why then, in the preseason\n\nNIT, did they struggle to beat Yale and get smoked by Georgia\n\nTech? In February, UConn suffered back-to-back losses at Notre\n\nDame and Pittsburgh, but it was their next game, a desultory\n\n76-63 victory over Miami at home, that took Calhoun to the edge.\n\n\"I went bonkers on the sideline,\" he says. \"No matter what we\n\ndid, it wasn't right. The team walked into the locker room\n\nafterward looking like they'd lost by 40. Everyone was expecting\n\nAttila the Hun.\" Instead, Calhoun cracked a string of jokes. He\n\npleaded with his players to find within themselves the emotion\n\nand passion that they'd need as the season reached its climax,\n\nand he pledged in return to check his own temper, if only they\n\nmet him halfway. \"It was corny and funny,\" Calhoun says, \"and\n\nthey just started laughing at me and enjoying themselves. They do\n\nhave emotion and passion. I just had to back off to let it come\n\nout.\"\n\nIn the team's regular-season finale at Syracuse, Okafor\n\nreaggravated a stress fracture that had caused spasms in his\n\nlower back. He was unavailable for the Huskies' Big East\n\ntournament opener against Notre Dame, and before the game the\n\ncoaching staff smelled fear among the players, a foreboding that\n\nthe team would be going home early. Yet the Huskies reached the\n\nfinal without Okafor, then welcomed him back and beat Pittsburgh\n\nby making up an 11-point deficit over the final nine minutes.\n\nOkafor's absence for those two Big East tournament games \"showed\n\nme something in the team,\" junior guard Ben Gordon says, \"that I\n\ndidn't even know we had.\"\n\nOkafor fouled out of the Big East final with slightly more than\n\ntwo minutes left and UConn's comeback incomplete. It was Gordon\n\nwho closed out the Panthers, scoring 15 points in the final\n\n11:12, a development that delighted the coaching staff, which had\n\nbeen pleading with him all season to be more assertive. He\n\nfollowed that up by being named Most Outstanding Player of the\n\nPhoenix Regional, and scored 21 in the championship game, firing\n\nin three treys. \"I've pushed and prodded and loved that kid for\n\nthe last three years,\" says Calhoun, who once mockingly suggested\n\nthat Gordon inquire about season tickets, so often did he turn\n\ninto a spectator.\n\nCalhoun's concerns about his players' mental makeup resurfaced\n\nduring the NCAA tournament. He hadn't liked the Huskies' body\n\nlanguage and attitude before their opener with Vermont, so before\n\nUConn's second-round game with DePaul he made sure a locker room\n\nTV was tuned to the duel between Syracuse and Maryland, \"to give\n\nthem a feel for what they're involved with here.\" When the\n\nHuskies reached San Antonio after thrashing Vanderbilt and\n\nAlabama in the Phoenix Regional, he even brought his players on\n\nstage at the Thursday Final Four Salute, an NCAA function that's\n\nnormally coaches-only. Where UNLV's 1990 national champions--a\n\nteam to which UConn had been compared in terms of sheer\n\ntalent--were remorseless in their run to the title, these\n\nHuskies, impressive as they were, let their vulnerabilities play\n\nnear the surface, whether in the form of Okafor's tender back, or\n\npoint guard Taliek Brown's complaints about his rough treatment\n\nin Internet chat rooms, or accounts of the players-only meetings\n\nthat were convened after every loss. Leave it to Okafor to cut to\n\nthe essence of all those fits and starts: \"We wouldn't be here if\n\nwe'd gone undefeated in the regular season,\" he said last week.\n\n\"Because the losses helped us learn so much.\"\n\nA loss in the tournament may provide similar learning\n\nexperiences, but there's no opportunity to set things straight in\n\nanother game. And Duke, the Huskies' semifinal opponent, would\n\nnearly give Connecticut just such a lesson in its sternest test\n\nsince the Big East final. With only 3:56 gone, Okafor picked up\n\nhis second foul; he would sit for the rest of the half while Duke\n\nused a 15-1 run to build a 41-34 lead. Okafor watched helplessly.\n\nHe kneaded a towel, then turned imploringly to his teammates,\n\nwith palms upturned and open. \"I mean, it was eating me, eating\n\nme up inside,\" he would say later. \"I blew off steam for like two\n\nor three minutes. But I knew I couldn't stay sour-faced for the\n\nwhole half. I didn't want to be a cancer on the team.\"\n\nThe most telling tactical change Calhoun made to start the second\n\nhalf was to move Okafor off Duke center Shelden Williams to\n\nforward Luol Deng, thereby foiling Duke's plan to draw Okafor's\n\nfourth foul by posting up Williams. In fact, Williams fouled out\n\nfirst, with 5:04 left, and by then Okafor had begun to put his\n\nsignature on the game, most emphatically with a block of an\n\nattempted dunk by Deng. Not two minutes later the horn tolled for\n\nanother Duke big man, forward Shavlik Randolph. That left the\n\nfifth-year senior Nick Horvath, a physics and English double\n\nmajor, as Duke's lone big man standing. His matchup with Okafor\n\nduring the game's decisive minutes was a genuine student-athlete\n\nsmackdown, and Okafor's domination was pivotal. He finished with\n\n18 points, all of them in the second half, as UConn overcame an\n\neight-point deficit in the last 3:28 to escape with a 79-78 win.\n\nIt's a truism of tournament life that a team needs a near-death\n\nexperience to win it all. With the Huskies having reached San\n\nAntonio by beating teams seeded Nos. 15, 7, 6 and 8 by an average\n\nof 17.5 points, Duke taught them more than any of Calhoun's\n\nheadshrinking could. \"It wasn't who we beat,\" Okafor said\n\nafterward. \"It was how we beat them. Down eight points, how many\n\nminutes left, the whole country probably thought we were out\n\nexcept us. I don't remember the comeback, to tell you the truth.\n\nI just know we all believed, and the next thing you know, we're\n\nup, game over, we're all hopping around.\"\n\n\"He was zoned,\" Calhoun said of his center. \"He was just so\n\nfocused on winning that basketball game that he took it upon\n\nhimself. I did tell him, 'You can't make the conditions, you just\n\nhave to react to them.'\"\n\nOf that Okafor hardly need be reminded. Many people mistakenly\n\nbelieve he's African-born and -raised, and he might as well have\n\nbeen, as he watched his first-generation immigrant parents, Pius\n\nand Celestina, make their way in the New World. During the late\n\n1960s his father, then 17, had joined the Biafran rebels, taking\n\nup arms against the Nigerian army during the 30-month civil war\n\nthat became notorious worldwide as a million people died, mostly\n\nof starvation. In '74 Pius immigrated to the U.S., attending\n\nGrambling and then, while working nights at a Houston filling\n\nstation, Texas Southern, where he earned an accounting degree. In\n\n'80, on a visit to Nigeria, he met Celestina, who's now a\n\nregistered nurse. Emeka's ability to excel at basketball while\n\ndoing honors work in finance is less impressive next to the\n\nexample of his father, who currently shuttles between Houston and\n\nKansas City, where he takes classes toward his fourth degree, a\n\ndoctorate in pharmacy, even as he works as a CPA. \"My role model\n\nis just the average hard worker,\" Emeka says. \"People that build\n\nthemselves up from nothing. I really have an admiration for\n\nthat.\"\n\nOkafor is grateful for his good fortune, for not having to worry\n\nabout war, famine or pestilence, and for getting a free education\n\nin exchange for playing ball. He didn't begin to play in earnest\n\nuntil the sixth grade, and even as a senior at Houston's Bellaire\n\nHigh he was unpolished, an easy mark for peers like Eddy Curry\n\nand Josh Childress at the NBA's camp for promising high\n\nschoolers. Now his left hand is so well developed that Calhoun\n\nthinks it might be more effective than his right (his natural\n\nshooting hand). He has the foot speed to guard a small forward\n\nout on the floor, and at a taut 252 pounds, he can now block\n\nshots even when an offensive player bodies him on a power move.\n\nOkafor's teammates needled him every time they hit a new city and\n\nhe had to field another round of questions about how he balanced\n\nbooks and basketball, but the guardians of the NCAA's image\n\ncouldn't have invented a better character as the frontman for\n\ntheir gemstone event. Okafor is handsome, elegant, well-spoken,\n\nthoughtful, selfless, diligent and worldly. He is remarkable\n\nenough, in fact, to be subversive, for he puts the lie to the\n\nclaims of many in the college hoops establishment (his own coach\n\namong them) that it's too much to expect every ballplayer to\n\ngraduate within six years. Okafor will do so, easily and with a\n\n3.8 GPA, in three. Excuse me. The NCAA wants to relax its\n\nstandards? As the nation's leading shot blocker might say, \"Get\n\nthat weak stuff out of here!\"\n\nInstead of NCAA poster boy, perhaps he should be NCAA president.\n\nOkafor is opposed to salaries for players, but he would like to\n\nsee a number of smaller things: plane tickets home, extra seats\n\nfor family at tournament games, stipends \"just to get by.\" He\n\nadds, \"Also, right now athletes can't keep additional\n\nscholarships they earn through academics. That makes no sense.\n\nAnd the gambling is getting crazy. Every town I go to, some fan\n\nis like, 'Emeka, I got a thousand bucks on you guys.' I'm like,\n\n'Great, dude, I don't really care.' The NCAA should be careful\n\nwith that, but I guess it's probably too big already.\"\n\nIf Connecticut had begun the season as everybody's No. 1, the\n\nHuskies' opponent in the final was the season's surprise. Georgia\n\nTech's 67-65 semifinal defeat of Oklahoma State was born of\n\nshrewd offensive sets and changing defenses. Both follow from\n\ngood backcourt play, which the Yellow Jackets had in abundance.\n\nBut in the championship game those guards--Jarrett Jack, B.J.\n\nElder and Will Bynum--shot 4 for 17 in the first half, and by\n\neight minutes into the second, the Huskies' lead crested at 25.\n\nIn its November loss to Georgia Tech, UConn missed 20 free\n\nthrows, but on Monday it was the Yellow Jackets who shot 57.1%\n\nfrom the line. A late hail of three-pointers eventually brought\n\nthem to within seven, but they had spent far too much of the game\n\nsimply trying to put Okafor's looming presence out of their\n\nheads.\n\nUConn swingman Rashad Anderson held the ball as the horn sounded\n\nand Okafor leaped twice in celebration. But soon his expression\n\nturned serious again. He stalked his teammate around the chaos\n\nand confetti of the Alamodome floor, trying to seize the ball for\n\nhimself, and prized it from Anderson only after agreeing to give\n\nup his shoes in exchange. Throughout the postgame he cradled\n\nit--at the press conferences, in the locker room and onto the\n\nteam bus. At 1:15 Tuesday morning he was on a balcony at the\n\nHuskies' hotel, surveying a riotous courtyard, with the ball\n\nstill lodged in the crook of his elbow. \"I wanted something to\n\nremember this by,\" he explained. \"I've been plotting a long time\n\nfor this. Ben got the ball after the Big East tournament. I was\n\ngoing to get the championship ball.\""
