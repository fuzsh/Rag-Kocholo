        "text": "My favourite things to read are books written by women, especially those by African women. As a book lover, I’m always on the lookout for new releases by African women for the upcoming year. One that I’ve been particularly excited about is We Were Once Girls by Aiwanose Odafen. I’ve been eagerly awaiting Odafen’s next work ever since I read her debut novel, Tomorrow I Become a Woman, back in 2022. The novel delved into the complex relationship between a mother and daughter as they grappled with tremendous loss. I was drawn to the way Odafen presented the struggles of women with care and sensitivity, as well as her portrayal of friendship among women.\n\nAll these reasons aside, I’ve been eagerly anticipating her next book since she offered a peek into it in a 2022 interview with The Republic. In the interview, she expressed her eagerness to ‘explore the lives of the daughters of the three main characters [in Tomorrow I Became a Woman]’ in her next book, which she was working on at the time. ‘I cannot wait for readers to get to know Ego, Zina, and Eriife better, and perhaps see themselves in these terrific women,’ Odafen added. To my utmost satisfaction, her second novel, We Were Once Girls, will be released later this year. The novel follows the lives of best friends Ego, Zina, and Eriife as they navigate strikes and political turmoil, ultimately taking separate paths. United by their shared past, this novel seeks to answer the question: can they, and their country, overcome the challenges they encounter?\n\nThis year, I’m also excited about other offerings from women across the continent. Abi Daré returns after her widely read 2020 novel, The Girl with the Louding Voice. Her forthcoming novel, And So I Roar, is about a young girl who must advocate to save not only herself but the young women in her village. Additionally, in An African History of Africa, Sudanese-British journalist, Zeinab Badawi, guides us through Africa’s remarkable history. This year, Sierra Leonean author, Namina Forna, also presents the finale to her young adult fantasy series, Deathless. In the third and final book, The Eternal Ones, Forna takes us through her protagonist’s attempts to kill the gods, whose ravenous competition for power is bleeding her kingdom dry.\n\nFrom exciting novels to thought-provoking non-fiction, these new book releases by African women promise to captivate readers with their stories, shedding light on the multifaceted experiences, cultures, and struggles of African women. They are as follows:\n\nDetermined to avoid the pain and instability of her parents’ turbulent marriage, Kokui marries a man far different from her loving, philandering, self-made father—and tries to be a different kind of wife from her mother. But when Kokui and her husband leave Ghana to make a new life for themselves in America, she finds history repeating itself. Her marriage failing, she is called home to Ghana when her father dies. Back in her childhood home, which feels both familiar and discomforting, she comes to realize that to exorcize the ghost of her parents’ marriage she must confront them, not only to enable her own healing, but for the sake of her daughter who is considering a marriage proposal of her own. Tender and illuminating, warm and bittersweet, My Parents’ Marriage by Nana Ekua Brew-Hammond is a compelling story of family, community, class, and self-identity from an author with deep empathy and a generous heart.\n\nFor reasons of her own, Hero Tojosoa accepts an invitation she was half expected to decline, and finds herself in Prague on a bachelorette weekend hosted by her estranged friend Sofie. Little does she know she’s arrived in a city with a penchant for playing tricks on the unsuspecting. A book Hero has brought with her seems to be warping her the text changes depending on when it’s being read and who’s doing the reading, revealing startling new stories of fictional Praguers past and present. Uninvited companions appear at bachelorette activities and at city landmarks, offering opinions, humour, and even a taste of treachery. When a third woman from Hero and Sofie’s past appears unexpectedly, the tensions between the friends’ different accounts of the past reach a new level. An adventurous, kaleidoscopic novel, Parasol Against the Axe considers the lines between illusion and delusion, fact and interpretation, and weighs the risks of attaching too firmly to the stories of a place, or a person, or a shared history.\n\nNelah seems to have it all: wealth, fame, a husband, and a child on the way. But in a body her husband controls via microchip and the tailspin of a loveless marriage, her hopes and dreams come to a devastating halt. A drug-fueled night of celebration ends in a hit-and-run. To dodge a sentencing in a society that favours men, Nelah and her side-piece, Janith Koshal, finish the victim off and bury the body. But the secret claws its way into Nelah’s life from the grave. As her victim’s vengeful ghost begins exacting a bloody revenge on everyone Nelah holds dear, she’ll have to unravel her society’s terrible secrets to stop those in power and become a monster unlike any other to quench the ghost’s violent thirst.\n\nWomb City imagines a dark and deadly future Botswana, rich with culture and true folklore, which begs the question: how far must one go to destroy the structures of inequality upon which a society was founded? How far must a mother go to save the life of her child?"
