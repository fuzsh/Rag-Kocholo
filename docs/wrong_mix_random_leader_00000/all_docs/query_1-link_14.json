        "text": "2. Grid-connected Solar Electric Systems Solar electricity – or photovoltaics (PV) – is the world’s fastest growing energy technology. It can be used on a wide variety of scales, from single dwellings to utility-scale solar farms providing power for whole communities. It can be integrated into existing electricity grids with relative simplicity, meaning that in times of low solar energy, users can continue to draw power from the grid, while power can be fed or sold back into the grid at a profit when their electricity generation exceeds the amount they are using. The falling price of the equipment combined with various incentive schemes around the world has made PV into a lucrative low carbon investment, and as such demand has never been higher for the technology, and for people with the expertise to design and install systems. This Expert handbook provides a clear introduction to solar radiation, before proceeding to cover: electrical basics and PV cells and modules inverters design of grid-connected PV systems system installation and commissioning maintenance and troubleshooting health and safety economics and marketing. Highly illustrated in full colour throughout, this is the ideal guide for electricians, builders and architects, housing and property developers, home owners and DIY enthusiasts, and anyone who needs a clear introduction to grid-connected solar electric technology.

Preface and Acknowledgements The worldwide market for grid-connected solar electric systems has increased from 1.55 gigawatts (GW) installed in 2006 to 11.86GW in 2010. This 2010 figure represents an increase of 665 per cent over the 2006 figure. It is to be expected that the general public as well as tradesmen, technicians and other professionals will need information about all aspects of grid-connected solar as they see these systems installed in their suburbs and on larger roof spaces; they will also wish to know how it affects their lives. In the absence of basic technology and installation information, how and why grid- connected solar electric systems work and the value they can represent for the electricity grid may be misrepresented. As can be seen by the increase in the grid-connected solar electric market, the technology and production of solar modules and enabling products (e.g. inverters, mounting structures etc.) are now mature; product demand has been increasing from year to year with healthy forward projections, so many more manufacturers have moved into this technology market, driving prices down; governments around the world have introduced various economic drivers for renewable energy, with those affecting solar electric systems being typically subsidies, feed-in tariffs and redeemable renewable energy credits. Global Sustainable Energy Solutions was pleased to be approached by Earthscan to write this book now, because the market demand for the product clearly demonstrates a need for information at all levels. This book is suitable for anyone wanting to learn about grid-connected solar electric systems starting with the explanation of solar radiation, its origin, solar modules, solar electric systems, system composition, system installation, through to the economics of these systems.

As technology improves, almost everything we use, from cooking and cleaning appliances to sports and entertainment equipment, has been updated to include electronic circuitry.However,society’sdependenceonelectricityisincreasinglyproblematic: as conventional fossil fuel reserves diminish and the danger of climate change materializes, the need for alternative energy sources is unprecedented. Solar power, that is electricity generated using energy from the sun, is an attractive way to offset our reliance on electricity generated by burning fossil fuels. This book explores how solar energy is converted into electricity that can be used to power our homes and cities. It begins with a description of the solar resource, which is the sun’s energy hitting the Earth’s surface, and goes on to describe ways in which this resource can be quantified and captured by solar power systems. It explores different technologies used to convert sunlight into electricity and details how a grid-connected photovoltaic system is designed, installed and commissioned at the residential level. Why solar power? Since the industrial revolution, developed nations have been burning fossil fuels in ever increasing quantities. However, in the past decade two major problems with this have come to light. The first relates both to the scarcity of fossil fuel resources and the notion of energy security. The oil reserves that the world currently depends on are accepted as being a limited resource, and it is acknowledged that demand for oil will only increase as countries such as India and China increase their levels of industrialization and burgeoning middle classes demand more power. This growth will create an enormous demand on finite resources. Moreover, these resources are generally found in areas characterized by conflict, such as the Middle East, and prices can be highly variable. Interest in renewable energy technologies like solar power is driven by the need to meet these increasing needs and a desire for independence from ever increasing oil prices. The beauty of solar power is that it has very few running costs: once the capital investment has been made the energy is effectively free, while fossil fuels must be purchased continuously and all indications are that prices will continue to rise. The second problem is that of human-induced climate change (also known as global warming), the widely accepted theory that burning fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide and methane into the www.EngineeringBooksPdf.com\n\n20. 2 grid-connected solar electric systems atmosphere, causing the planet’s climate to change and alter weather patterns. Scientists predict more extreme weather events such as floods and droughts will occur as a result of climate change and that the average global temperature will rise. Naturally this affects the plants and animals that inhabit the Earth. Many species are predicted to suffer extinction if urgent action is not undertaken. Human-induced climate change has been acknowledged by all levels of government in developed and developing countries as needing urgent international action to mitigate its effects. This action will include measures to reduce the use of fossil fuels, so reducing the release of GHGs. A major contribution to the success of this action will be substituting fossil fuels with cleaner, low-emission technologies. Renewable energy technologies that make use of wind and solar power will therefore play an important role in reducing global GHG emissions and are likely to represent a large portion of the world’s energy production in the future.

Solar energy is harnessed by using solar electric systems, also known as photovoltaic (PV) systems. The word photovoltaic is derived from the Latin words photo (light) and voltaic (energy). PV devices capture the energy in sunlight and convert it into electricity – that is, they use light energy. Solar electric systems should not be confused with solar thermal systems which use the sun’s energy to heat a substance (typically water). Electric and thermal systems are very different in appearance and operation, as Figure 1.3 shows. There are several different types of solar electric systems, discussed below. This book focuses on solar electric systems that feed electricity back into the grid (grid-connected solar electric systems). Off-grid systems An off-grid or stand-alone solar electric system is designed to replace or supplement conventional mains power supply. They are most commonly used in rural or remote areas where mains power is not available due to the high cost of grid extension. Off-grid systems use solar power to charge batteries that store the power until it is needed for use. The battery power is then used to operate appliances (e.g. lighting, pumps, refrigeration etc.) either directly from the batteries as low-voltage equipment (e.g. 12V DC lights) or from a power inverter, which is connected to the batteries and converts the battery voltage to mains equivalent for use in regular AC equipment (e.g. computer, television, radio etc.). Off-grid systems can range in size from a single PV module, battery and controller to very expensive large systems incorporating sophisticated control equipment and large back-up generating sets. Further reading about off-grid systems can be found in Chapter 15.

Unlike off-grid systems they are not designed to be a substitute for grid power. Grid-connected systems are normally found in urban areas that have readily available mains supply and instead of storing the electricity generated by the PV system in batteries, the power is fed back into the grid. In this way the grid acts as a kind of storage medium and when power is needed in the building it can be imported from the grid. One of the key benefits of this is that the system does not have to supply enough electricity to cover the property’s power demand as in an off-grid system. The property can be powered by the PV system, the electricity grid or a combination of the two, meaning that the system can be as small or large as the owner desires. Excess power generated by the PV system will be exported to the power grid and in many areas the system owner is paid for the exported power. The major components of a grid-connected PV system include the PV array, inverter and the metering system. In addition to these major components are the necessary cables, combiner boxes, protection devices, switches, lightning protection and signage. Figure 1.7 Grid-connected PV systems are becoming more common in urban areas Source: Green Solar Group www.EngineeringBooksPdf.com\n\n24. 6 grid-connected solar electric systems Central grid-connected PV systems The existing electricity system typically consists of central power stations using a variety of fuel sources such as coal, gas, water (hydro) or diesel that provide power to end-users via transmission lines and a distribution system. The power stations directly connect to the transmission lines and the power produced by the power stations is consumed by end-users at their actual location in factories, businesses and homes. A central grid-connected PV system operates in the same way. A large PV array is directly connected to the transmission lines. Grid-connected central PV systems can be as small as 50kWp, while systems as large as 60MWp have been installed in recent years in Europe. There are also companies planning grid-connected PV power plants over 1GWp, with many plants to be completed in the near future. Figure 1.8 Typical small grid- connected PV system (as set up for gross metering). A grid-connected PV system uses the sunlight that strikes the PV array to generate DC power. This DC power is converted to AC power via the inverter and the AC power is supplied (or fed) into the electricity grid via the meter Source: Global Sustainable Energy Solutions Figure 1.9 Alicante, Spain, 5.6MWp central PV system Source: SMA Solar Technology AG www.EngineeringBooksPdf.com\n\n25. introduction to solar power 7 Distributed grid-connected PV systems As the name suggests, these grid-connected PV systems are distributed throughout the electricity grid. This is the most common type of PV system and hence the focus of this book. There are typically two types of system: commercial and residential. Commercial systems are generally greater than 10kWp and are located on buildings such as factories, commercial businesses, office blocks and shopping centres. The power generated by these systems is typically consumed by the loads within the building, so no excess power is exported to the electricity grid. Residential systems refer to those installed on homes and are generally smaller than commercial systems, typically between 1 and 5kWp. The power generated by these systems is first consumed by any loads operating in the house during the day; excess power is fed into the grid providing electricity to nearby buildings.

The other main technologies are described below. It is important to understand that although they all use a form of solar power, each is very different in its operation, design and installation. Solar thermal power Rather than using sunlight, solar thermal power uses the sun’s heat in a variety of different ways. Solar thermal power is becoming very prominent in both small- and large-scale applications as it is becoming cost-competitive with conventional generation in some applications. Solar hot water Solar hot water is one of the most commonly used forms of solar power. Solar power is used to heat water in what is often referred to as a ‘solar collector’. Solar collectors are housed on the roof and may also include a rooftop storage tank for the hot water; they should not be confused with solar modules which produce electricity. There are two main types of solar hot water collectors. The most common collector is the flat plate; a large dark plate collects heat while water flows through tubing beneath. Heat is transferred from the dark plate to the water that, when sufficiently hot, rises to the tank as steam. Recently, evacuated tubing (a different style of collector) has become popular; this collector uses cylindrical tubing through which water passes. The tubing has an inner and an outer tube and the space between them is a vacuum in order to provide insulation and reduce heat losses from the water to the surroundings. For further reading on solar hot water systems, see Chapter 15. Figure 1.12 This system includes a solar electric system (back) and ﬂat plate solar hot water system with a storage tank (front) Source: Green Solar Group www.EngineeringBooksPdf.com\n\n27. introduction to solar power 9 Figure 1.13 A solar hot water system with an evacuated tube collector Source: Global Sustainable Energy Solutions Concentrated solar power (CSP) CSP is a large-scale form of solar thermal power. However, rather than producing hot water, it produces electricity and is effectively a power plant that feeds into the grid. CSP uses large mirrors to concentrate the sun’s rays towards a central point (normally a tube). This concentrated energy is used to boil water Figure 1.14 A CSP installation in the Nevada Desert. Parabolic mirrors concentrate sunlight to heat the water running through the thin tubes in front of the mirrors www.EngineeringBooksPdf.com\n\n28. 10 grid-connected solar electric systems and create steam which can be used to drive a steam turbine and generate electricity. CSP systems are most economical when deployed on a large scale and normally act as a power plant; feeding the electricity produced back into the grid. This technology has been in use for many years in the Mojave Desert, California, and is now emerging in other regions such as Spain. There is a great deal of international interest in CSP technology and a new trend for substituting water with molten salts as a storage medium is emerging. One of the main problems with solar power is that electricity storage is very expensive; however, molten salts are able to store the energy produced by a CSP system as heat for several hours so electricity can still be produced at night time when the sun no longer supplies energy. This form of storage is significantly less expensive than the batteries normally used to store energy produced by photovoltaics. Passive solar design Passive solar design refers to designing a building in order to utilize the sun’s energy as much as possible. It varies significantly throughout the world, the basic idea being to keep the sun’s rays out of the house in the summer and to trap the sun’s rays inside the house during winter and so to minimize the need for artificial cooling and/or heating. Deciduous trees and vines are useful because if planted in a location exposed to direct sunlight, they will shade the area in summer, but in winter they lose their leaves allowing the sun’s rays to come in and warm the area. Eaves and pergolas can be designed to shade windows during the summer (when the sun is high in the sky) but allow sunshine in during winter (when the sun is low in the sky) to warm the building. The eaves should also be lightly coloured so they will reflect the sun’s rays in summer. If they are a dark colour the material will absorb the sun’s rays and heat up. • • Figure 1.15 A variety of techniques used to capture the power of passive solar: some are very simple while others need to be incorporated into the building’s design from the very beginning Source: Global Sustainable Energy Solutions www.EngineeringBooksPdf.com\n\n29. introduction to solar power 11 Windows allow for cooling breezes in summer and can be closed in the winter to seal in warm air. These should be positioned according to local wind direction, i.e. if summer winds commonly blow from the northeast, windows should be placed on the north side of the building and on the east side of the building to capture the breeze. Thermal mass and insulation is important for maintaining the building at a comfortable temperature despite fluctuations in outside temperature. This can be as simple as closing curtains in winter to stop heat escaping through the windows. All these techniques can be used to reduce the need for artificial heating or cooling and reduce the property’s energy consumption. They are an excellent complement to a solar electric system as energy-efficient households will use less electricity and so export more solar electricity to the grid. How to use this book Getting involved with the solar industry can be daunting. This book provides a clear introduction to the terminology and technology used in grid-connected PV systems. For homeowners and property developers looking to purchase a system, this book gives a clear outline of what to expect during the design and installation processes. For builders and electricians looking to work in the solar industry, it serves as an introduction. It should not, however, be used as a substitute for an accredited training course. Grid-connected PV systems should only be designed and installed by professionals accredited in the country of installation; in all cases local codes and national standards must be consulted. The following chapters outline topics relevant to grid-connected solar electric systems. Solar Resource and Radiation (Chapter 2) Before the sun’s power can be harnessed by PV devices it is important to establish how much solar energy is available at a given location. This chapter outlines the basics of solar resource data: where it can be acquired and how it is used. Solar resource varies significantly depending on the time of day, location and time of year. All these factors must be taken into account when designing a PV system. • • Figure 1.16 When correctly designed eaves can prevent summer sun entering the window but allow winter sun to warm the building Source: Global Sustainable Energy Solutions www.EngineeringBooksPdf.com\n\n30. 12 grid-connected solar electric systems PV Industry and Technology (Chapter 3) What are PV devices and how are they manufactured? This chapter explores the basic science of PV technology and the many different varieties of PV technology available, including their strengths and weaknesses. It also includes important information about buying modules, such as which standards and certifications to look for and what to expect from a PV module warranty. PV Cells, Modules and Arrays (Chapter 4) In order to design and install a PV array a sound knowledge of the electrical characteristics of PV cells is required. This chapter explores how PV cells are connected to make modules and the different ways in which these modules can be connected to create arrays. Sample calculations demonstrate how the voltage and current outputs of a solar array are determined. Inverters and Other System Components (Chapter 5) As well as the PV array there are many other components required to make a PV system. The inverter converts the DC power produced by the PV array to AC power appropriate to be fed into the grid. Many different types are available and their different uses are discussed. This chapter also discusses the cabling used to connect the components, PV combiner boxes and module junction boxes which are used to bring together wires and cables. Protection and disconnect devices that ensure the safety of the system, lightning protection, the meter through which electricity flows into the grid and monitoring equipment that provides system owners with useful information regarding power output are also covered. Mounting Systems (Chapter 6) Mounting systems are used to secure the PV array to a surface; both roof and ground mounting systems are discussed in Chapter 6. There are many different ways to mount a PV array and the final decision on which system to use is often based on a compromise between performance and aesthetics. This chapter describes the different systems and explores these trade-offs. Site Assessment (Chapter 7) Once a property owner decides to purchase a PV system the next step should be a thorough site assessment. The designer will assess important physical features of the site such as size and solar resource in order to determine the optimal system design. Designing Grid-connected PV Systems (Chapter 8) Following a successful site assessment the system must be designed. This chapter explores important design processes such as responding to the design brief and choosing system components by referring to local codes, calculation, software and analysis of local conditions. www.EngineeringBooksPdf.com\n\n31. introduction to solar power 13 Sizing a PV System (Chapter 9) This chapter demonstrates the calculations required to match the inverter and array and ensure they operate safely together. It also shows how to calculate the PV system’s yield, accounting for typical system losses. Two sample calculations show the complete process. Installing Grid-connected PV Systems (Chapter 10) The installation of PV systems is described with reference to each individual component and the chapter concludes with a discussion of the requirements related to connecting a PV system to the grid. System Commissioning (Chapter 11) This chapter describes the process of turning the PV system on and feeding electricity into the grid. Safety is paramount to this process, which involves a thorough visual inspection of the PV system followed by electrical tests and finally the commissioning of the system (that is its connection to the grid). The process is heavily dictated by local codes. However, a rough description of the inspections and tests that may be required is given. System Operation and Maintenance (Chapter 12) After commissioning, many PV systems operate without trouble for decades. However, regular maintenance checks are important to ensure the system always operates at its best. This chapter outlines common maintenance practices and who they should be completed by. If a problem does occur, troubleshooting will be required; this can be difficult and should always be done by an accredited professional. Marketing and Economics of Grid-connected PV Systems (Chapter 13) In addition to the technical details of PV systems, familiarity with the economics of PV systems is an important part of any solar professional’s job. This chapter outlines the types of financial incentives available throughout the world to PV system owners and where further information on them may be found. It also demonstrates how to calculate the payback time of a PV system using this information. Case Studies (Chapter 14) Chapter 14 offers case studies of a variety of grid-connected PV systems throughout the world, demonstrating how the principles outlined here are implemented in real life. www.EngineeringBooksPdf.com\n\n32. 2 Solar Resource and Radiation Throughout history humankind has held a strong relationship with the sun. Many prehistoric cultures worshipped the sun as a deity and modern scientific thinking confirms that the sun and its energy are essential to life on Earth. Solar power has often been a topic of science fiction and fantasy: Isaac Asimov’s short story ‘The Last Question’ (1956) envisaged all the Earth’s power being supplied by a small one-mile wide solar collector orbiting the Earth, launched in 2061, while other stories have explored the use of solar power for long-range space travel. Advances in modern solar technology are bringing such fantasies closer to reality and future technology may only be limited by imagination. Solar resources The sun is the source of almost all energy on our planet, either directly as sunlight or indirectly as wind and waves. Even the coal reserves we mine today were once living plants that gained their energy from photosynthesis: the process by which sunlight, carbon dioxide and water are converted to carbohydrates. The sun’s seemingly endless energy supply is driven by a process known as nuclear fusion, where atoms of hydrogen combine to form an atom of helium releasing a large amount of energy in the process. The helium atom may then combine with other helium or hydrogen atoms to release even more energy. The energy produced in the heart of the sun is emitted as electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic radiation is emitted in many useful forms including microwaves (as used in microwave cooking), radio waves (used in telecommunications) and visible light. Solar cell designers focus on capturing the energy carried in visible light. Box 2.1 Power and energy The unit of electric power is the watt (W). Power in watts is equal to the product of volts (V) x amperes (amps). Power (watts) voltage (volts)\n\n33. current (amps) P V w I Kilowatts (kW) is the term used for large amounts of power; i.e. 1000 watts = 1kW Energy is defined as the capacity to do work, or power, over time. www.EngineeringBooksPdf.com\n\n34. 16 grid-connected solar electric systems Energy (watt-hours) power (watts) w time (hours) E P w t Large amounts of electrical work or energy are expressed in kilowatt-hours1 , that is simply the amount of power multiplied by the time it is used. The solar radiation data unit commonly used is kWh/m2 . This is the amount of solar energy received by a square metre exposed to full sun (1000W of solar radiation) for a period of one hour. The difference between power and energy is an important concept as energy usage is the basis for determining the output of renewable energy systems for a given period. Example A 60 watt light globe is left on for 12 hours. This light bulb will consume 720Wh or 0.720kWh of energy: 60 watts w 12 hours 720Wh Figure 2.1 The IKAROS (Interplanetary Kite-craft Accelerated by Radiation Of the Sun) mission was launched on 21 May 2010. This solar powered craft features a large membrane (or sail) of solar cells that produces electricity and receives additional propulsion from solar radiation Source: Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Figure 2.2 The sun releases vast amounts of electromagnetic radiation – photovoltaic devices provide an efﬁcient means of converting this power into electricity Source: Global Sustainable Energy Solutions www.EngineeringBooksPdf.com\n\n35. solar resource and radiation 17 Quantifying solar radiation Although radiation emitted from the sun is fairly consistent there is significant variation in the radiation received at the Earth’s surface. This is caused by the Earth’s orbit (responsible for the seasons), rotation on its own axis (responsible for night and day) and the albedo (covered later) of certain areas. Solar array Figure 2.3 White visible light can be divided into many colours; each ray of colour has a different wavelength/ frequency and energy content. Violet light has the most energy while red has the least Figure 2.4 Average annual insolation for Boston, MA on a horizontal plane measured in peak sun hours (PSH). Insolation varies widely throughout the year and doubles in summer months so solar module output power greatly increases in summer. This data is for the insolation on a horizontal plane, which is not ideal in a city so far from the equator. Inclining a plane to a tilt equal to the angle of latitude ensures that the plane faces the sun more directly and receives more insolation – optimum angles for PV modules are dealt with in Chapters 7 and 9 Source: Atmospheric Science Data Center, NASA www.EngineeringBooksPdf.com\n\n36. 18 grid-connected solar electric systems Figure 2.5 Daily irradiance for London, UK, on a horizontal plane measured in W/m2 and varying with time of day and month. Solar energy varies throughout the day and peaks in the middle of the day Source: PVGIS © European Communities, 2001–2008 designers need to be able to quantify how much solar radiation a given site will receive throughout the year. The amount of solar energy received by an area over a day is referred to as insolation and can be measured in kWh/m2 /day or peak sun hours (PSH), which are explained below. It is important to note that most PV arrays are tilted at a certain angle above the horizontal and the insolation on the horizontal plane will differ from the insolation on the tilted plane of the array; data is often available for both the horizontal and various tilt angles. Box 2.2 Solar radiation terminology Peak sun hours (PSH): Daily irradiation is commonly referred to as daily PSH (or full sun hours). The number of PSH for the day is the number of hours for which power at the rate of 1kW/m2 would give an equivalent amount of energy to the total energy for that day. The terms peak sunlight hours and peak sunshine hours may also be used. Irradiation: The total quantity of radiant solar energy per unit area received over a given period, e.g. daily, monthly or annually. Insolation: Another term for irradiation. The amount of solar radiation incident on a surface over a period of time. Peak sun hours (kWh/m2 / day) are a measurement of daily insolation. Irradiance: The solar radiation incident on a surface at any particular point in time measured in W/m2 . Figure 2.6 Peak sun hours are very useful in system yield calculations (see Chapter 9); one PSH represents 1 hour of radiation at 1kW/m2 . Because the sun does not shine consistently all day the number of peak sun hours will always be less than the number of hours in a day Source: Global Sustainable Energy Solutions www.EngineeringBooksPdf.com\n\n37. solar resource and radiation 19 The effect of the Earth’s atmosphere on solar radiation The Earth’s atmosphere reflects a large amount of the radiation received from the sun – without this protection life could not be sustained on the planet. When solar radiation arrives at the top of the Earth’s atmosphere it has a peak irradiance value of 1367W/m2 (this is known as the solar constant). By the time solar radiation reaches the Earth’s surface it has a peak irradiance value of approximately 1000W/m2 . The difference between the solar constant and the peak irradiance value at the Earth’s surface is due to the Earth’s albedo – the amount of solar energy reflected from a surface on the Earth at that specific location. Light is reflected from Earth in a variety of ways: Radiation is reflected off the atmosphere back into space. Radiation is reflected off clouds in the stratosphere. The Earth’s surface itself reflects sunlight. The average portion of sunlight reflected from the Earth (the Earth’s albedo) is 30 per cent. Polar regions have very high albedo as the ice and snow reflect most sunlight, while ocean areas have a low albedo because dark seawater absorbs a lot of sunlight. • • • Example If sunlight is received at an irradiance of 1000W/m2 for 2 hours, 600W/m2 for 1.5 hours and 200W/m2 for 1 hour, the total radiation received that day is 3.1PSH: 1000W/m2 w 2 hours\n\n39. 200W/m2 w 1 hour 3100W/m2 /day 3100W/m2 /day { 1000W/m2 /day 3.1PSH Box 2.3 Key terminology Direct radiation: Solar radiation that passes directly to the Earth’s surface. Diffuse radiation: Solar radiation that is scattered or absorbed by clouds and gases within the atmosphere and then re-emitted – diffuse radiation is less powerful than direct radiation. Air mass: The distance that radiation must travel through the atmosphere to reach a point on the surface. This value varies throughout the day for a location. www.EngineeringBooksPdf.com\n\n40. 20 grid-connected solar electric systems Irradiance is a combination of direct and diffuse radiation and will depend on the albedo (reflected solar radiation) of that particular location. That proportion of solar radiation which is scattered, absorbed or re-emitted in the atmosphere is diffuse radiation. Understandably on a sunny day, this scattered diffuse radiation will contribute only to 10 per cent of visible light, but on a cloudy day there will be much more scattering of the solar radiation reaching the Earth’s surface which means the amount of diffuse radiation will be much greater. Air mass will also affect the irradiance at a location.

Air mass of 1.5 is the standard condition at which solar modules are rated. Air mass zero refers to air mass in space; air mass one corresponds to conditions when the sun is directly overhead. Regions outside the tropics will never experience air mass one, as the sun is never directly overhead. Figure 2.10 At sunset the sun is low in the sky and therefore air mass is very high. Light is scattered so much that the white light is separated into its different colours. Most of the colours scatter so that they are not visible but red light scatters the least, which is why we see red sunsets on cloudy days. Blue light is scattered the most, which is why the sky is blue when sunlight passes through the least amount of atmosphere (during the day) Source: Global Sustainable Energy Solutions Figure 2.9 From the surface of the Earth, air mass is directly related to the altitude of the sun Source: Global Sustainable Energy Solutions www.EngineeringBooksPdf.com\n\n42. 22 grid-connected solar electric systems Insolation varies widely depending on location (and time of year) and when designing a system it is very important to consider the solar radiation characteristics for the specific location where the solar array will be installed. For instance, a solar array powering a household in a German city would have to be significantly larger than a solar array powering a household with the same energy consumption in the Australian desert. Locations far from the equator such as Poland receive a large amount of irradiation during long summer days but very little during winter when the days are very short. Figure 2.11 Average annual insolation for Krakow, Poland (northern hemisphere), Nairobi, Kenya (near the equator) and Melbourne, Australia (southern hemisphere) on a horizontal plane. This ﬁgure shows that areas around the equator (Kenya) receive signiﬁcantly more solar radiation than areas closer to the poles (Poland and Australia).

NASA provides web data for most of the world and the European Commission Joint Research Centre provides a free web tool, Photovoltaic Geographical Information System (PVGIS), that estimates the daily output of a solar array in any location in Europe or Africa (see Chapter 15 for details of these websites). Figure 2.14 This image shows the variation in insolation across Europe: the southern parts of Europe receive signiﬁcantly more sunlight.

Designers use several geometrical techniques to design an array that will capture the most solar energy possible. The location of the sun is specified by two angles which vary both daily and annually. Figure 2.15 Solar resource varies during the day due to Earth’s rotation on its own axis and during the year due to Earth’s orbit around the sun Source: Global Sustainable Energy Solutions Box 2.4 Sun angles Solar altitude: The angle between the sun and the horizon; the altitude is always between 0° and 90°. Azimuth: The angle between north and the point on the compass where the sun is positioned. The azimuth angle varies as the sun moves from east to west across the sky through the day. In general, the azimuth is measured clockwise going from 0° (true north) to 359°. Figure 2.16 The sun’s altitude is shown in blue while its azimuth is represented by green Source: Global Sustainable Energy Solutions www.EngineeringBooksPdf.com\n\n45. solar resource and radiation 25 In the northern hemisphere solar arrays are normally installed to face south as the sun is always in the southern sky and in the southern hemisphere solar arrays normally face north. In regions between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn this is not always the case, at certain times of year the sun will be in the southern sky for those in the southern hemisphere and in the northern sky for those in the northern hemisphere. In summer the sun will always be higher in the sky than in winter due to the natural tilt of the Earth. The longest and shortest days of the year are known respectively as the summer and winter solstices and usually fall around 21 June and 21 December. The sun’s altitude is highest on the summer solstice and lowest on the winter solstice. The midpoints between the two solstices are known as the equinoxes, normally falling around 20 March and 23 September. Many prehistoric cultures learned to identify and predict the solstices and equinoxes, these dates being useful in planning harvests and religious celebrations. Figure 2.17 Not only does the sun’s position vary during the day, it also varies throughout the year and this is an important consideration when choosing the orientation and tilt of an array Source: Global Sustainable Energy Solutions Figure 2.18 At sunrise on the summer solstice the sun can be seen to align with the stones at Stonehenge in the UK Source: Andrew Dunn www.EngineeringBooksPdf.com\n\n46. 26 grid-connected solar electric systems The sun’s path in the sky for any particular location can be depicted on a two-dimensional surface in a sunpath diagram. This diagram can be used to determine the position of the sun in the sky at any time of the day, for any day of the year. From this information the times at which an area is shaded can be determined, which in turn allows the yearly insolation to be calculated. Practical use of the sunpath diagram is covered in Chapter 7. The sunpath diagram is composed of: azimuth angles, represented on the circumference of the diagram; altitude angles, represented by concentric circles; sunpath lines from east to west for different dates in the year; time of day lines crossing the sunpath lines; location information that refers to latitude. Sunpath diagrams may look entirely different for other areas. Directly on the equator, the sunpath would range equally north and south. Outside the tropics, sunpath diagrams generally look like the one below, though in the northern hemisphere they will be inverted. Note the seasonal variation in the path of the sun. Outside the tropics, the sun only rises to a low altitude in winter and is always north or south (depending on the hemisphere) of the observer. During summer, the sun rises to a higher altitude. The sun will always be farthest north or south at the solstices in all locations, north in June, south in December. • • • • • Figure 2.19 Sunpath diagram of Sydney has been used to ﬁnd the precise location of the sun on 1 December at 10am. 1 December is highlighted on the right of the circle, this line is then followed across until it corresponds with the line for 10am (which follows a ﬁgure of eight shape), at the point of intersection the altitude can be found. To determine the azimuth a line must be drawn from the centre of the circle, passing through the intersection between date and time and out to the perimeter; here the azimuth is 71°. Block lines correspond to dates on the left-hand side and dotted lines correspond to dates on the right.

This orientation of the solar array is very important as it affects the amount of sunlight hitting the array and hence the amount of power produced. The orientation generally includes the direction the solar module is facing (i.e. due south) and the tilt angle, which is the angle between the base of the solar module and the horizontal. The amount of sunlight hitting the array also varies with the time of day because of the sun’s movement across the sky. It then becomes apparent that if the sun is overhead and the solar panel is laid flat on the ground, it will capture all the sun’s rays, as shown in the image below. Figure 2.20 Imagine a 1m2 solar panel, tilted as shown. At a speciﬁc time there are 12 of the sun’s rays coming from the sun and hitting the solar panel Source: Global Sustainable Energy Solutions Figure 2.21 If the same collector is laid horizontally on the Earth’s surface at the same time as in the image above, the collector only captures 9 rays Source: Global Sustainable Energy Solutions Figure 2.22 A solar array horizontal to the ground will receive the most radiation at solar noon when the sun is directly overhead Source: Global Sustainable Energy Solutions www.EngineeringBooksPdf.com\n\n48. 28 grid-connected solar electric systems Solar modules should be installed so that as much radiation as possible is collected. To achieve this, the solar modules should be installed facing either true south (northern hemisphere location) or true north (southern hemisphere location). There will be some exceptions for installation depending on the local environment (i.e. array’s installed in a valley in the southern hemisphere may not necessarily face north). To point a module directly towards the sun at all times would require a solar tracking frame to be installed. This can be expensive, so it is not common practice for most PV applications. However, it will be discussed in further detail in Chapter 6. Box 2.5 Magnetic declination When installing a photovoltaic system it is important to consider the magnetic declination of a location (also known as magnetic variation). Magnetic declination is the difference between true north (the direction of the north pole) and magnetic north (the direction in which a compass will point). A solar system should face true north or true south and so the magnetic declination angle of the location should be considered. In New Orleans magnetic declination is approximately 0° and so the compass would point to true north. In Seattle, however, the magnetic declination angle is approximately 17o east, so when the compass points to 17o east it is in fact facing true north or true north is 17° west. A PV system in Seattle should be installed facing 197o east (or 163o west) so as to face true south. Figure 2.23 Magnetic declination is the bearing between true north and magnetic north Source: Global Sustainable Energy Solutions Figure 2.24 In Seattle magnetic north is always 17o east of true north Source: Global Sustainable Energy Solutions Note 1 The System International (SI) unit for energy is the joule (J). A joule is a relatively small quantity so large energy quantities such as solar radiation are often expressed in megajoules (MJ). 1MJ is equivalent to 1,000,000 joules. The conversion factor for MJ and kWh is: 1kWh = 3.6MJ or 1MJ = 1/3.6kWh. www.EngineeringBooksPdf.com\n\n49. 3 PV Industry and Technology Solar cells, also known as photovoltaic (PV) cells, are devices that produce electricity when exposed to sunlight. In 1921 Albert Einstein won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of the photoelectric effect that is the scientific basis for solar cells. Solar cells were first developed in the 1950s for use in space exploration. They are ideal for this application because they are reliable, need little maintenance (having no moving parts) and require only sunlight, which for this use is in almost limitless supply. In the 21st century solar cells are an increasingly attractive energy source considering the problems posed by greenhouse gas emissions and dwindling fossil fuel energy reserves. They are also popular because they are very versatile and can be used on a small scale, i.e. on homes or to power a single device such as a remote telecommunications repeater station, as well as for large-scale power use. The potential for photovoltaics has attracted significant investment from governments and businesses all over the world. Globally laboratories are working to improve solar cell efficiencies and to create more powerful cells by further developing existing technologies and by using new materials and manufacturing methods. This chapter explores some solar technologies available today and explains the operation of a PV array. Semiconductor devices Solar cells are made from semiconducting materials. Semiconductors are materials that conduct electricity under certain conditions, so they are neither insulators nor conductors. The most common semiconductor material is silicon. To improve its conductivity, it is often combined with other elements in a process known as doping. Semiconductors are used frequently in electronics, including PV cells, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and microchips such as those used in computers. Mainstream technologies Silicon is the most widely used material in solar cell production; most commercial solar cells are made of silicon. Silicon is extracted from silicon dioxide (also known as quartzite); quartzite crystals are quarried and refined to extract silicon for solar cell manufacture. Quartzite crystals are also a major component of sand; however, regular sand is too impure to be used in this process. Silicon is a versatile material: a metalloid, it exhibits many of the properties of metals (i.e. it is lustrous and solid at room temperature) but also exhibits www.EngineeringBooksPdf.com\n\n50. 30 grid-connected solar electric systems Figure 3.1 Semiconductors are used in many electrical components Box 3.1 Solar cell efficiency Efficiency is a unitless measurement used to indicate how well a device changes one form of energy (i.e. heat, movement, electricity etc.) into another. Efficiency is mentioned a great deal in connection with solar cells, so it is important to understand what is meant by it and what it actually entails in relation to the operation of the cell. Many different forms of efficiency are used to describe the operation of a solar cell: Cell efficiency: The amount of electrical power coming out of the cell per amount of light energy that hits the cell. Usually this is measured at standard test conditions (STC): 25°C ambient temperature and 1000W/m2 light intensity. A cell will rarely experience STC in the field so it will rarely perform at its rated efficiency. Efficiency and power output are related as follows: Efficiency Power OUT/Power IN The standard value for power in (irradiance) is 1000W/m2 . If the cell’s efficiency is 22 per cent and it has an area of 0.2m2 then: Power OUT Efficiency × Power IN Power OUT 0.22 × 1000W/m2 × 0.2m2 Power OUT 44W Module efficiency: The efficiency of a module is measured the same way as that of a cell, the difference being the inclusion of losses from reflection and shading of the glass as well as a few other minor losses. Purchasers should always be wary when considering efficiency figures; it is important to find out what the test conditions were and to understand how the performance will change when the array is installed, the environment is never at standard test conditions and variation in temperature, wind and insolation will strongly affect the array’s performance. Efficiency ratings given at STC are generally best for comparing cells/modules, rather than calculating system yields (covered in Chapter 8), as cell temperatures in the field change throughout the day and may never achieve 25°C. The efficiencies achieved for a PV cell in a laboratory are generally significantly higher than the efficiency of a readily available PV module, because many techniques used in laboratories are not yet economically viable for use in mass production. • • www.EngineeringBooksPdf.com\n\n51. pv industry and technology 31 some properties of non-metals. There are several different types of silicon solar cell: monocrystalline, polycrystalline and amorphous silicon will be discussed in this chapter. Monocrystalline silicon These solar cells are produced from a single silicon seed crystal placed in a crucible of molten silicon and drawn out slowly while rotating. In this manner it is possible to produce a larger pure crystalline silicon ingot, which is then sliced into thinner wafers. Monocrystalline silicon solar cells are the most efficient and generally the most expensive, although the higher initial cost may be justified by their increased power output as they are highly efficient compared to other silicon technologies. The highest recorded efficiency for Figure 3.2 A single-crystal silicon ingot is drawn from the molten silicon Source: Silfex Figure 3.3 As well as being used in rooftop and grid-connected applications, 22 per cent efﬁcient monocrystalline PV cells were used by Sunswift IV, the winning silicon solar car at the 2009 World Solar Challenge held in Australia Source: Photo: Daniel Friedman www.EngineeringBooksPdf.com\n\n52. 32 grid-connected solar electric systems monocrystalline silicon solar cells is 25 per cent; commercially available solar cells are now being produced with efficiencies of 22.5 per cent and finished modules with efficiencies of 19 per cent. Multicrystalline/polycrystalline silicon Multicrystalline or polycrystalline silicon solar cells are manufactured by block casting molten silicon, so they are not made from a single crystal ingot but rather from one composed of many small crystals, which grow in random orientations as the molten material solidifies. This produces lower efficiencies than monocrystalline cells; however, it is still a very popular technique because it is easier and less expensive. Multicrystalline and monocrystalline silicon solar cells are those most commonly used in PV arrays, and commercially available multicrystalline solar cells can now reach laboratory efficiencies over 18 per cent, with the record for module efficiency being 17.84 per cent. Thin film solar cells Thin film solar cells are made from materials suitable for deposition over large areas. They need only be about one micron thick, hence the name thin film (a dot such as ‘.’ covers 615 microns and multicrystalline and monocrystalline silicon solar cells are normally about 300 microns thick). Increasing material prices and high worldwide demand for affordable photovoltaics have led to increasing interest in thin film solar cells. They are less expensive to manufacture than crystalline solar cells and a lot of research has been directed towards increasing efficiencies, the current laboratory record Figure 3.4 Multicrystalline cells are easily identiﬁable by their distinct grain structure which gives a glittering effect in sunlight Source: Global Sustainable Energy Solutions www.EngineeringBooksPdf.com\n\n53. pv industry and technology 33 for thin film solar cell efficiency being 20.1 per cent. However, commercially available thin film modules are between 6 and 12 per cent efficient. Thin film cells are being used more and more frequently in buildings and are often used for gadgets such as solar-powered watches and calculators. The most common materials are amorphous silicon (a-Si, still silicon but in a different form), cadmium telluride (CdTe) and copper indium (gallium) diselenide (CIS or CIGS). In amorphous silicon the molecules are randomly aligned instead of having a fixed crystalline structure as seen in mono- and poly-silicon. CdTE, CIS and CIGS are all polycrystalline materials, their internal structure being similar to that of polycrystalline silicon; however, they are very different materials. Thin film solar cells are well suited to high volume manufacturing; they are made using the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) process, where the material is deposited onto large area materials, e.g. coated glass, flexible plastic or stainless steel sheet. Figure 3.5 Amorphous silicon modules are easily distinguished from crystalline modules by their dark and uniform colour but they also look like non-silicone thin ﬁlm modules Table 3.1 Comparison of different solar technologies Cell material Module efficiency Surface area required for 1kWp in metres squared Surface area required for 1kWp in square feet Monocrystalline silicon 14–20% 5–7m2 54–77 ft2 Polycrystalline silicon 13–15% 6.5–8.5m2 72–83ft2 Amorphous silicon thin film 6–9% 11–16.5m2 110–179ft2 CdTe thin film 9–11% 9–11m2 98–110ft2 CIS/CIGS thin film 10–12% 8.5–10m2 90–108ft2 Source: IEA www.EngineeringBooksPdf.com\n\n54. 34 grid-connected solar electric systems The size of the array required is largely dependent on the efficiency of the module, although the most efficient module may not always be the most desirable. Less efficient modules are generally less expensive and may be most cost-effective in areas where the amount of space available for the array is not a constraint. Contacts For either PV cells or modules to work, they need electrical connections. A solar cell has electrical connections provided by metal conducting strips that collect electrons produced in the cell and allow this current to flow through the circuits. These metal strips are known as contacts and there are several different contact technologies currently in use. The most common way to manufacture solar cells is by screen printing, where the metal is simply printed onto the cell. This method is very reliable and is typically applied to solar cells producing efficiencies of about 12–15 per cent. Several factors need to be balanced when using screen printing: If there is too much space between the contacts, the cell will be less efficient. If the area covered by the contacts is too large, the cell will receive less sunlight and produce less power. For the contacts to be effective, the top of the cell often needs to be treated in such a way that its absorbance of high-energy blue light is reduced. Another method used by manufacturers to achieve solar cell efficiencies over 20 per cent is rear or back contacts. This technology increases the working cell area, allows a simplified automated production and the cell wiring is hidden from view. The most efficient commercially available silicon solar cells use rear contacts (18–23 per cent). There is no metal on the front of the cell, which means the whole cell is producing electricity. The highest efficiency silicon cells (25 per cent laboratory efficiency) derive from another method known as buried contact solar cells (BCSC). This method uses small laser grooves which are cut in the cell and the metal is inserted into • • • Figure 3.6 The metal contacts on this polycrystalline cell are clearly visible www.EngineeringBooksPdf.com\n\n55. pv industry and technology 35 the groove. Buried contact and rear contact technologies are advantageous because they solve many of the problems associated with screen printing. Buried contacts cover very little surface area because most of the contact is inside the groove. This means they don’t block as much sunlight and the contacts can be very close together because they are so thin. The sides of the grooves are treated instead of the top, so the PV cell’s absorption of blue light is not affected. Rear contacts also eliminate many of these problems, because they are located at the back of the cell, they do not shade the cell and so the number of these cell contacts can be increased to improve cell efficiency. Buying solar modules Many different PV modules are available worldwide. It can, however, be difficult to determine whether the products and suppliers are reliable. It is important to be able to ensure that the PV modules and the electrical installation are safe and of good quality. Poor practice and sub-quality products pose serious risks to the safety and financial viability of this investment. Outlined below are factors to consider when purchasing a PV system, bearing in mind Figure 3.7 Front and back of SunPower rear (back) contact monocrystalline silicon solar cell Source: SunPower Figure 3.8 BCSC technology is used to manufacture solar cells with much higher efﬁciencies than those that use screen printing.

This means that the modules, additional equipment (discussed in Chapter 5), mounting frame (discussed in Chapter 6) and roof must all last as long as the modules or be replaced during that time. Solar modules are sold with a lengthy manufacturer’s warranty, e.g. 25 years for 80 per cent of output. While the guaranteed output must be included in any system output estimates, the buyer needs to understand that if they are installing a product with such a potentially long warranty, the structure (e.g. the building and roof itself) and other system components need to last a similar length of time. For some equipment, i.e. the inverter, a replacement may be planned over the life of the PV system. Standards The PV industry is growing rapidly, resulting in many new manufacturers producing PV modules. It is important that only quality modules are installed and standards do exist. The most common standards applicable to PV modules are: IEC 61215 Crystalline silicon terrestrial photovoltaic (PV) modules – Design qualification and type approval. IEC 61646 Crystalline thin-film terrestrial photovoltaic (PV) modules – Design qualification and type approval. IEC 61730 Photovoltaic (PV) module safety qualification – Requirements for construction and requirements for testing. These standards originate from the International Electrotechnical Commission: www.iec.ch. In many countries a PV module must evidence compliance with either IEC 61215 or IEC 61646 (depending on whether it is thin film or crystalline silicon technology) and IEC 61730. Certifications Quality modules should comply with the IEC standards but may also adhere to local standards. Certifications generally ensure that modules adhere to all relevant standards in addition to the specific photovoltaics standards; examples range from wind loading to salt mist corrosion resistance (IEC 61701). The two most common certifications are: CE marking: The CE mark stands for conformité européenne. By using this mark the manufacturer is declaring that their module complies with the essential requirements of the relevant European Union health, safety and environmental protection legislation. The CE marking is mandatory on modules sold and installed in the EU. Underwriters Laboratory (UL): The Underwriters Laboratory is a US-based testing facility. Modules bearing a UL mark have been tested for compliance to IEC standards and local standards (depending on the country code next to the UL mark). Further information can be found in Chapter 15. • • • • • www.EngineeringBooksPdf.com\n\n57. pv industry and technology 37 Warranties PV modules are typically supplied with three levels of product warranty: 1-, 2- or 3-year warranty on the physical manufacture of the module itself, i.e. the frame, encapsulant, glass, module junction box etc.; 10–12 year warranty that the module will produce 90 per cent of its rated output; 20–25 year warranty that the module will produce 80 per cent of its rated output. If any of these conditions are not met, the question of a warranty claim will depend on the manufacturer’s published warranty and/or the commercial laws of the country where the module was purchased. For example, if someone buys a module from overseas and imports it for sale or their own use, then it is assumed that they understand that they have to send the module back to where they purchased it to claim warranty. If an imported module is purchased from a ‘reseller’ of the product, i.e. not the manufacturer itself or their agent, the reseller might have an arrangement 1 2 3 Figure 3.9 Sample data sheets showing information regarding the technical and safety standards to which the sample module complies. All manufacturers’ data sheets are speciﬁc to their products only, and when accessing any solar module speciﬁcations (either in soft or hard copy) the manufacturer should be contacted to conﬁrm that their published material is current.

PV modules are extremely reliable and stable products, but it is still advisable to find out the warranty provisions of any product being considered for purchase and installation. Emerging technologies Besides well-established mainstream technologies many new technologies are emerging. Some build on existing knowledge and research while others incorporate innovative new materials and techniques. Dye-sensitized solar cells Dye solar cells are still technologically immature. At the atomic level they operate very differently from other solar cells and do not use silicon. Dye solar cells use titanium dioxide (also used in toothpaste) and coloured dyes; they can be manufactured at a much lower cost than other solar cells and work better in low light. Dye solar cells are transparent and can be produced in many different colours, making them ideal for architectural applications as windows. Dye solar cells also have potential in military applications as they can be made in camouflage patterns.

Sliver cells Sliver cells were developed at the Australian National University and are very thin monocrystalline silicon solar cells. They are unique as silicon cells because they are bifacial (they can absorb light from both directions). Sliver technology has achieved cell efficiencies of over 19 per cent and module efficiencies of 13.8 per cent. The technology is in its early stages of commercialization but shows a lot of potential for applications in building-integrated photovoltaics.

III-V Semiconductors III-V or extrinsic semiconductor solar cells use an element from group III of the periodic table and an element from group V (as opposed to silicon which is a group IV element), such as gallium arsenide which is commonly used in space grade solar cells. These solar cells are commonly multi-junction so they are in fact many layers of solar cells, which will collect different colours of visible light. They also frequently use advanced solar concentrator technology to maximize incoming solar radiation. Extrinsic semiconductor multi-junction solar cells are the most efficient and most expensive technology on the market. The highest recorded laboratory efficiency is 41.6 per cent and is held by Spectrolab Inc in the US. Due to their high cost, III-V semiconductor cells are normally used for space applications such as satellites or other big-budget, high-performance, solar- powered devices such as solar planes and solar racing cars (see Figure 3.13). Solar concentrators Solar concentrators are used to increase the intensity of light hitting the cell so that it will generate more electricity (the output power produced by a solar cell is dependent on the intensity of light hitting that cell). There are many different kinds of solar concentrators available for a variety of applications, but the most common are lenses or reflective troughs used to focus light. Solar concentrators are advantageous because they increase the power output so that the system requires fewer solar cells (solar cells are always the Figure 3.13 Nuon Solar Team from the Netherlands races its solar car Nuna5 in the Suzuka Dream Cup 2010, a track race held in Japan Source: Hans Peter van Velthoven www.EngineeringBooksPdf.com"
