I understand of course their are other Blazers books out there, but I am gonna focus a lot on the fans throughout our history, their personal stories with the team, along with those in the background, etc. Will have some stats and higher ups too of course haha, but that will be the main focus.\n\nOne of my favorite interviews I have done so far is a gentleman who has been going to games since the 70's and has been to tons of away Blazer games also. Nice guy with some great tidbits.\n\nTrying to narrow down a title for it, but that will probably come more when its almost done(I aim for this time next year for that, but hopefully sooner).\n\nIf any want to share their stories, feel free to DM me here or can send me an email:tarheelripcity@hotmail.com\n\nCan send any Blazer related pictures as well if you want and if I decide to put them in the book, will have you sign a release statement to that affect(Same for your stories).\n\nThanks friends and any tips or suggestions will be much appreciated!\n\nStart with this…… http://www.sportstwo.com/threads/ot-hockey-puck-russell-westbrook.220764/\n\nIf you hadn’t of been so rude to me the other day, I could share 50 more just about you mighty Blazers.\n\nUpdate:\n\nA friend of mine is helping me with the project who is very good at organization which I need haha. We have decided on a title, let me know what you all think!\n\n\"Rip City Nostalgia:Blazers Fans On Their Favorite Team'\n\nGoal is to keep it under 400 pages and at some point get the team themselves to somewhat endorse it(But not end of the world if they choose to not do so)l Though looking into copyright aspects of that.\n\nHeaded out to Portland hopefully by the end of the year to not only watch the Blazers but also to get some more in person stories if possible.\n\nAgain if want to share anything with me just let me know! Plan on starting the writing and collating of what I have so far in the next couple of weeks and add/detract as the days go by."
