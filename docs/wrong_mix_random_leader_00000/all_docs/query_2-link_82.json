        "text": "This was supposed to be Connecticut’s season, and the court was going to be Emeka Okafor’s personal playground, where he could take anyone’s ball and swat it away.\n\nThe Huskies – before Howard Dean growled like a caged Huskie, Justin Timberlake exposed Janet Jackson’s nipple ring, and Mike Jarvis was fired at St. John’s – were everyone’s preseason No. 1, led by regal and relentless Okafor.\n\nConnecticut learned soon enough that life seldom goes according to plan. Freshman Charlie Villanueva’s eligibility was called into question early, then in an after-thought game against Sacred Heart, Okafor suffered a back injury.\n\nHe has been poked and prodded by more doctors than Elizabeth Taylor.\n\nFor a while, Okafor’s back loosened up and the 6-foot-9 junior with the wingspan of one of those prehistoric birds, showed why Emeka Okafor must translate into “I Own the Lane.”\n\nIn a late-season four-game stretch, he averaged 21 points and 14 rebounds. After he had a double-double at halftime of a 71-53 win over St. John’s in the Garden, Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun made Okafor’s case for Player of the Year.\n\n“He is evolving into something awfully special,” Calhoun said after Okafor grabbed 22 rebounds against the Red Storm. “He is clearly the best player in America. Most importantly, he is the most valuable player in America.”\n\nConnecticut (24-6) and the rest of the Big East is about to learn how valuable Okafor is. The league tournament begins today in the Garden with four first-round games. Seton Hall, led by Andre Barrett of The Bronx, and Villanova, led by Jason Fraser of Long Island, cap day one with the most intriguing matchup.\n\nThe Huskies will meet the winner of the Notre Dame-West Virginia game tomorrow, and Okafor’s status is uncertain. He clearly was in pain Sunday when the Huskies lost 67-56 at Syracuse.\n\nOkafor, who had an MRI exam Monday, scored two points and grabbed nine rebounds against the Orangemen. There is no indication that additional rest will cure Okafor’s aching back.\n\n“When he’s healthy, he’s the dominant player in college basketball,” Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim said. “When he’s healthy, [UConn] is the best team in college basketball. They’re still a good basketball team without him, but clearly, without him, it hurts them.”\n\nWithout a healthy Okafor, Pittsburgh, last year’s Big East tournament champ, has an excellent chance to repeat. The Panthers (27-3) are tougher than the Huskies to begin with.\n\nProvidence and Syracuse, the other teams with a first-round bye, will have to play exceptionally well to cut down the nets in the Garden on Saturday night. The Hall is a great dark-horse candidate to play for the title.\n\n“There’s no dominant team,” Barrett said. “There are teams that have shown they can be dominating at times. It’s the team that’s most determined and focused that will win it.”\n\nCHART: Big East Tournament at Madison Square Garden\n\nOdds & Ends\n\nThe Big East Tournament beings today at Madison Square Garden.
