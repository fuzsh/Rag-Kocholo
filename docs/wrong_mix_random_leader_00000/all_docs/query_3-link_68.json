        "text": "Nowadays many University students in Tanzania are facing challenges in writing their research reports, be it in government or private Universities. Specifically, students encounter problems in writing and formulating background of the study, statement of the problem, study objectives, literature review and research methodology. Their failure in these preceding chapters, leads to failure in data analysis and presentation, hence shortfalls in discussion and conclusion chapters. Methodologically, the article reviewed some scholarly studies conducted in Tanzania to substantiate the problem and indicate examples on how best the research reports can be written. Apart from narrations given, the article indicates examples with the aim of helping both junior and senior researchers to organize well their research reports in a manner of aligning ideas and chapters within the report. The article will as well help both undergraduate and postgraduate students whose programmes require researches in fulfillment of the requirement, for the award of their particular degrees.\n\nThe paper is designed to acquaint the researchers about how to write a research report. The paper intends to discuss the common format of research report. There can be several reasons for writing a research report. It can be written for publishing in scholarly journals, peer-reviewed journals, publications and books. The paper will improve our understanding of writing a good academic research report with example of our research topics on various issues. The examples are based on our research on HIV positive people, adolescent health and infertility issues. The primary source of data collection for the paper is our field work.\n\nThe abstract serves two major purposes: it helps a person decide whether to read the paper, and it provides the reader with a framework for understanding the paper if they decide to read it. Thus, your abstract should describe the most important aspects of the study within the word-limit provided by the journal. As appropriate for your research, try to include a statement of the problem, the people you studied, the dependent and independent variables, the instruments, the design, major findings, and conclusions. If pressed for space, concentrate on the problem and,\n\nMany young researchers find it difficult to write a good and quality research thesis/article because they are not prone to article writing ethics and training. Yet, a thesis/publication is often vital and paramount for career advancement, grants, academic qualifications and others. This research work described the basics and systematic steps to follow in writing a good scientific thesis/article. This research also outlined the main sections that an average thesis/article should contain, the elements that should appear in each section, the systematic approaches in writing research, the characteristics of a good thesis/article, the attributes of a good research thesis/article, qualities of a good researcher and finally the ethics guiding research."
