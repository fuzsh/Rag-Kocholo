        "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. - The New Orleans Hornets have finally found a taker for Tyson Chandler. It took a deal with tinkering Charlotte coach Larry Brown, who was willing to jettison the Bobcats' first draft pick.\n\nEmeka Okafor was dealt to the Hornets on Tuesday for Chandler in a deal involving 26-year-old centers, a trade that brought different financial relief to both teams and hopes they'll thrive under different big men.\n\nThe Hornets have been trying to unload the 7-foot-1 Chandler for several months. Last season they sent him to Oklahoma City, but the trade was rescinded after Chandler failed a physical amid concerns aver a lingering toe injury.\n\nBrown was willing to gamble on the injury-prone big man who is more athletic and can also play power forward. It comes at the expense of Okafor, who at 6-foot-10 is shorter than Chandler and had trouble guarding the NBA's top big men.\n\n\"We're getting a young kid who is long and athletic and can play multiple positions and fills a need that we obviously have,\" Brown said.\n\nBut the Hornets were intrigued by Okafor's superior rebounding and durability, giving New Orleans a reliable big man with a longer contract as they try to recover from last season's first-round playoff exit.\n\n\"Emeka is one of the premier centers in the NBA with All-Star caliber scoring and rebounding averages throughout his career,\" Hornets general manager Jeff Bower said. \"His potential to improve is endless once you put him on the court running with Chris Paul.\"\n\nPaul and Chandler comprised a constant alley-oop threat when Chandler was healthy, and the two were close off the court.\n\n\"I'm losing a great friend, a brother. T.C. is my man. ... I'm going to miss him,\" said Paul, who was attending a basketball camp in New Orleans.\n\n\"It's going to take some time to see how this works out,\" Paul continued. \"I want Emeka to come in here and be the best player he's ever been. From today on out, that's my teammate. ... Hopefully we can eventually have the same relationship that me and Tyson had.\"\n\nThe deal is the fourth trade Charlotte has made since managing partner Michael Jordan hired Brown before last season. Brown, in his record ninth NBA head coaching job, has continued his history of numerous trades to mold the team into his versatile, defensive-minded liking.\n\nNow it includes sending the centerpiece of Charlotte's new franchise to the city's old team.\n\nTwo years after the Hornets left Charlotte for New Orleans, the expansion Bobcats took Okafor with the No. 2 pick in the 2004 draft - after Orlando grabbed Dwight Howard.\n\nOkafor, who won a national championship at Connecticut, had injury problems early in his career. But he has played all 82 games in each of the last two seasons while providing Charlotte with solid, if unspectacular, play.\n\nOkafor averaged 13.2 points and 10.1 rebounds last season, but his style didn't mesh with Brown, who questioned his basketball fire at the end of the season.\n\n\"I wanted him to have a passion and work on his game,\" Brown said Tuesday. \"I think he made unbelievable progress in that regard. When we had an exit meeting this past season he told me he was going to do that, he was going to work on his game. ... This was a basketball decision. I had nothing to do with Emeka.\"\n\nBut Chandler is coming off surgery, and despite their identical ages, Chandler has played four more seasons than Okafor because he came to the NBA directly from high school in 2001.\n\n\"We appreciate what Tyson has done for our club in the past and wish him the best, but our intention this summer was to improve our team and this trade is definitely a positive move in that direction,\" Bower said.\n\nChandler, averaged 8.8 points and 8.7 rebounds in only 45 games last season. He then underwent procedures on his left ankle and toe in May after being ineffective in the first-round series loss to Denver.\n\nGeneral manager Rod Higgins said Chandler will be in Charlotte for a physical later this week, but they're confident he'll be ready for the start of training camp.\n\nFor the Hornets, it immediately lowers their payroll would reduce luxury tax payments. Okafor is scheduled to make $10.5 million next season and Chandler $11.8 million. The Hornets entered the week with a payroll of about $78 million, triggering a dollar-for-dollar tax over the NBA's luxury tax threshold of $69.9 million.\n\nBut the Bobcats unload a much longer long-term commitment. Okafor still has five years left on a six-year, $72 million deal he signed last year. Chandler would make $12.7 million in a player option in 2010-11, the final season of his deal.\n\nBobcats owner Bob Johnson, who is looking to sell the team after losing millions of dollars, has ordered management not to reach the luxury tax threshold. Getting Okafor's big contract off the books will help achieve that goal in future seasons.\n\n\"Emeka is a great kid, but we all felt that with the way Tyson plays, with his quickness and his ability to handle the ball and his length, that was something that was very important to us,\" Brown said. \"That was the overriding factor.\"\n\n---\n\nAP Sports Writer Brett Martel in New Orleans contributed to this report."
