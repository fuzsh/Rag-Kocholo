November 2023: Recipient 039, Udochukwu Emeka-Okafor

We’re pleased to announce that November’s recipient of the Creatives Grant is Udochukwu Emeka-Okafor. Udochukwu a producer, writer, and director based in England. She is due to release her debut short film, Between You & Me. We really enjoyed the work she sent in, Beings (link below), an exploration of masculinity and femininity through androgynous fashion. We found it really interesting – the way she was able to blend critical engagement with aesthetics, style, making her subject feel full and slippery in all its nuance. We hope you enjoy her work as much as we did!
