        "text": "On April 21, HBO Max released the trailer for “On The Record,” an investigative documentary highlighting the stories of three courageous women who came forward with accusations of rape and sexual assault against Russell Simmons, co-founder of the hip-hop music label Def Jam Records.\n\nDirected and produced Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering—the team behind the by “The Invisible War” (2012) and “The Hunting Ground” (2015), highlighting sexual assault within the U.S. military and on college campuses, respectively—”On the Record” premiered at Sundance in January to rave reviews. It is set to premiere on HBO Max on May 27.\n\nIn November 2017, reports emerged that Simmons, 62, was accused of sexual misconduct and rape by several women who worked alongside him in the industry.\n\nThe following month, The New York Times interviewed music director Drew Dixon—the first woman to publicly share her heartbreaking experiences with Simmons. Dixon viewed Simmons as a mentor who offered her a job at Def Jam early in her career. Shortly after, Simmons allegedly raped Dixon and “exposed his erect penis to her.”\n\n“I didn’t tell that many people about what happened with Russell,” Dixon shares in the trailer.\n\nIn addition to Dixon’s initial accusation, the film also highlights the stories of journalist Sil Lai Abrams and “Mercedes Ladies” group member Sherri “Sheri Sher” Hines, both of whom also accuse Simmons of sexual misconduct or rape. (Altogether, Simmons also faces more than a dozen cases of sexual assault or sexual misconduct.)\n\nIf you found this article helpful, please consider supporting our independent reporting and truth-telling for as little as $5 per month.\n\nWhile the documentary aims to hold sexual assaulters like Simmons accountable for their actions and provide a national platform to discuss these issues, the producers also hope it showcases the voices of black women in the #MeToo Movement.\n\nZiering and Dick say the film is meant to be a voice for women who experienced similar circumstances, specifically Black women and other women of color, who are too often left out of #MeToo discussions—despite the movement being founded by Tarana Burke, a Black woman herself.\n\n“He’s the king of hip-hop, the Black community will hate my guts,” Dixon said about her thinking before coming forward. “I didn’t want to let the culture down.”\n\nIn that vein, “On the Record” tackles a much-needed topic: the harsh realities of being a Black woman in the music business, and the little attention they receive in the #MeToo Movement."
