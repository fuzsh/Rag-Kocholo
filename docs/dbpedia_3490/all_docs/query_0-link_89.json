        "text": "Kirby Dick's typically insightful and compassionate documentary presents a harrowing picture of an epidemic of sexual assault and rape within the US military.\n\nFirst-hand testimony of survivors, many of whom tell alarmingly similar stories, paints a picture of systematic abuse within an institution that tolerates, fosters and indeed protects sexual predators on a massive scale. First released in 2012 and nominated for best documentary at the 2013 Academy awards, this shocking film now ends with an updated coda, which declares that recorded sexual assault in the military has increased by 35% since 2011, making its message even more timely and urgent."
