        "text": "Sexual assault is epidemic in the U.S. military. A female soldier in Iraq or Afghanistan is more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire. It’s estimated that 26,000 soldiers were assaulted in 2012 alone. Statistics like these have never been documented more personally or powerfully than they are in The Invisible War. The documentary catalogues rules and conditions that perpetuate rape and protect perpetrators. But the film’s real power comes from a series of wrenching interviews with veterans still coping with the aftermath of vicious, shameful assaults. From the Department of Defense down through all branches of the military, the impact of these courageous, fierce testimonials continues to be felt, manifested in actions as diverse as banning sexist material from computers to providing legal representation to victims. For its powerful indictment of criminal behavior in our armed forces, The Invisible War receives a Peabody Award.\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;"
