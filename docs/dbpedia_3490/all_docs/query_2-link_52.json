        "text": "Oprah Winfrey has signed on to produce a new documentary about sexual abuse in the music industry that will premiere on Apple TV+ next year.\n\nKirby Dick and Amy Ziering will helm the project, which, per a press release, will follow “a brilliant former music executive who grapples with whether to go public with her story of assault by a notable figure in the music industry. The film is a profound examination of race, gender, class and intersectionality, and the toll assaults take on their victims and society at large.”\n\nThe documentary does not have a release date nor a title, and no details about the subjects of the film were revealed.\n\nTrending\n\nDick and Ziering previously collaborated on two documentaries that tackle sexual abuse, 2012’s Oscar-nominated The Invisible War, which examines sexual assault in the U.S. armed forces, and 2015’s The Hunting Ground, about sexual assault on college campuses. Dick’s 2004 film, Twist of Faith, also told the story of a man who recounts the abuse he suffered at the hands of a Catholic priest as a teenager."
