        "text": "This Film is Not Yet Rated is a documentary directed by Kirby Dick, and produced by Eddie Schmidt about the Motion Picture Association of America (or the MPAA) and their often-unjust rules in rating movies. The MPAA’s rating system is as follows: G and PG are the same as they are in Australia, M is called PG-13 in America, MA15+ is R, and R18+ is NC-17, the latter being the strongest rating. The difference between an R movie and an NC-17 movie can be as wide as hundreds of millions of dollars, and is factored by disparities between Hollywood and indie filmmakers, straight and gay sex, male and female sexual depictions and violent and sexual content.\n\nLittle is known about the production process of This Film Is Not Yet Rated, other than it was presumably filmed sometime in late 2005. Most of the documentary follows Dick’s collaboration with Becky Altringer, a private investigator, to reveal the identities of the members of the MPAA review board, which they claim to be “average American parents” with children aged between five and seventeen. They discovered that most of the MPAA review board members had children over the age of eighteen at the time of filming, and some of them had no children at all, contrasting with the MPAA’s original intentions of guiding parents on what they should let their children watch. They also discovered that the members of the MPAA appeals board were mostly comprised of studio executives, sales representatives and film buyers, putting Indie filmmakers at an immediate disadvantage of getting an NC-17 rating so they make less money at the box office. The documentary also includes interviews with filmmakers whose movies received NC-17 ratings. The documentary falls under the Expository mode, due to its use...\n\n... middle of paper ...\n\n...ringer that exposes all of the MPAA’s worst kept secrets, namely their unjust criteria and ulterior motives behind the NC-17 rating as well as the identities of the raters. It is a system made to give parents a guideline on what they should let their children watch, but their biased rating methods at the end of the day will only fail parents and their families if they see a scene that justifies its corresponding movie to be given a higher rating than the one it was given. While some may argue that the documentary is one sided, the MPAA are highly unlikely to give an honest point of view when their credibility is at stake. Instead, the documentary tells the untold stories of the filmmakers affected by the NC-17 rating and this is where the documentary gets its drive from, rather than the MPAA defending themselves by denying all the rumours circulating around them."
