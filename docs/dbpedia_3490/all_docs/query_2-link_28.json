        "text": "At the time of its release many critics had written this film off considering as an average film with an average story. Chicago Sun-Times labeled it as an attempt to divert away from the traditional cinema, with a new concept silent film and it failed to make an impression on the audience because of lack of creativity in the story. The film had no surprise element in it for the audience.\n\nThe movie is ‘G’ rated and aimed at children aged around 7-12 years. The movie met its target audience because I feel they would be able to relate to this movie the most, but I also feel that the movie would be enjoyable for children of all ages and parents.\n\nThis is just one of the numerous misconceptions portrayed. When this film won the Oscar for best documentary, it was not actually supposed to have been able to win – in general terms, a documentary is a non-fiction movie. Although it met the criteria of being a movie, it was most certainly not non-fiction. Another example is when Heston's \"cold dead hands\" speech, which leads off Moore's idea of the Denver meeting, did not\n\nHundreds of movies are released every year. Filmmakers try to create the next jaw-dropping movie that audiences will stand in line for hours and pay top dollar to see. The key to success is finding ideas that appeal to a mass audience. Viewers are the lifeline of any production company so making something for everyone is a savvy business move for the film industry. To cover all bases, there are over fourteen different genres of movies. Film making is not a solo effort. It is a collaboration between the actors, directors, producers and other key contributors. This combined effort or mise-en-scene includes all the elements of the film to include actors, backdrops, costumes, props and lighting used to meet the director’s vision\n\nThe film premiered in May of 1986, a critical period in American history due to the Cold War between the United States and Russia. In the past, The United States government had set up offices in Hollywood to “advise” Hollywood producers that they could not and should not produce films that were about anything related to the Cold War. Although this was not a law, producers often did abide by the rules and for the most part listened to the suggestions of the government. Some could argue that this was a form of censorship because it regulated what movies could be about. However, in actuality, producers had free choice to produce movies in whatever genera they wanted, and whatever topics they wanted.\n\nBaby Face, as originally produced, edited, and released in 1933, gave rise to a fierce controversy regarding its content that perfectly exemplifies the relationship that existed then between studios, producers, and the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA). In retrospect, the film seems to capture the struggle between creative effort and censorship during the Golden Age of Hollywood. The Hays Code was the product of a rapidly changing era; a time when new technology allowed for provocative ideas to spread as a form of entertainment. What Baby Face did was to display the contradictions inherent in the motion picture industry and help elucidate the need for control over production standards.\n\nI love rated-R movies because they are actually interesting and keep me in the edge of my seat. If this movie wasn't as blunt as it is I probably wouldn’t like it. Usually I would recommend R movies to 10 and up, but I saw it before when I was younger. I had no idea what was going on, and I didn’t understand the message it was sending. So I would probably recommend it to 14 and up, for some children won’t see the message. MPAA rated Training Day rated-R, for it’s brutal violence, pervasive language, drug content, and brief nudity. Overall this is a entertaining movie that doesn’t disappoint. 9/11 would watch\n\nThis sort of rating usually subverts common horror ratings as it is very low but this was requested by the film makers. The film starred Daniel Radcliff an actor who starred in the renowned harry potter series of films all rated at 12A so Radcliff’s fans that are usually younger were attracted to the film which aided in it’s lower rating the film makers wanted to appeal to this so the film was not as graphic as some other horror films but some parents and the BBFC still has some concerns for the children watching it at age of 12 because they found that supernatural being convincing children to kill themselves and murdering people would disturb younger children the children who wouldn’t usually watch horror films were brought by Radcliff another scene were concerns were raised was with the woman in black hanging herself from a noose and the young girl setting herself on fire with an oil lamp so they cut certain scenes darkened certain shots and reduced sound affects to achieve the lower rating which is all unconventional of a horror\n\nThe movie is rated PG-13 and its total running time is two hours and 10 minutes. The main characters set in the movie are Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Matt Schulze, Sung Kang, Gal Gadot, Tego Calderon, Don Omar, Joaquim de Almeida, Dwayne Johnson, etc. After a successful prison escape, Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, and Jordana Brewster flee to Rio De Janeiro. Sooner than you know it, they are involved in another high speed race car theft. As the film goes on, their plan goes south and things start to get out of hand. During this time, they kill three DEA Agents and are wanted by the Kingpin leader of a drug cartel, Joaquim de Almeida, and a ruthless federal agent, Dwayne Johnson. As their time begins to wind down, Vin and Paul gather up a group of elite outlaws to stage a $100 million heist while being chased down all over the city of Rio De Janeiro.\n\nIn order to establish a group that censors televisions and movies, the Motion Picture Producers Association (MPAA) was created. Each rating category has a description of the appropriate age at which to view the film and whether or not a parent’s accompaniment is necessary. The Motion Picture Producers Association assesses a film and gives it a rating of G (general audiences), PG (parental guidance suggested), PG-13 (parents strongly cautioned), R (restricted), or NC-17 (no one under seventeen admitted). As the film industry has been changing over time, so have the ratings. More and more parents are having issues with the ratings that some films are issued. “The man behind the ratings, Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), says the system works just fine. ‘Parents use it and trust it, and that's why it's lasted for almost 35 years,’ Valenti says. ‘It warns parents in advance about what's in a particular movie, but ultimately, parents are responsible for the behavior and conduct of their children — not the ratings system’ (Hansen 273).”"
