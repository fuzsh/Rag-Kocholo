        "text": "The SHIELD Act’s requirements can be divided into two distinct categories: (1) the reasonable security measures obligation and (2) the data breach notification obligation.\n\nReasonable security measures\n\nThe statute lists its expectations for a reasonable security program. (Those are discussed in the SHIELD Act Compliance Checklist below.) In short, the SHIELD Act requires the adoption of security measures that includes at a minimum, administrative, technical, and physical safeguards for the private information of New York state residents. Administrative safeguards seek to manage an organization’s operations by influencing things like employee training, company policies, and data loss prevention procedures designed to mitigate the risk and damage from the mishandling or breach of personal information. Technical safeguards are things like cybersecurity, access controls, and software designed to preserve the confidentiality of data. Physical safeguards are locks and other barriers that limit the physical access to systems that store private information and the facilities that house them.\n\nThe SHIELD Act also recognizes that a company’s compliance with other data security regulations satisfies the reasonable security measure requirement. These include compliance with:\n\nGLBA\n\nHIPAA\n\nHITECH\n\nNew York’s Department of Financial Services 23 NYCRR Part 500, and\n\n“any other data security rules and regulations of … the federal or New York state government.”\n\nThe statute considers entities subject to these requirements to be a “compliant regulated entity.”\n\nDid New York create exceptions to the security obligation requirements?\n\nIn short, no. This law is very broadly applicable and has only outlined two possible mitigating factors on a business’s responsibility to comply.\n\nPublicly available information is not private information.\n\nThe SHIELD Act recognizes that creating security programs may be difficult for small businesses and alters its expectations with respect to small businesses (in light of a few factors).\n\nWorth noting is that the public information exception is also narrow. It does not excuse a business from compliance beyond the limited scope of use for the public information. Essentially, if a business uses public information and private information, they will be expected to comply with the obligations of the SHIELD Act.\n\nThe small business ‘exception’ is better understood as a lowered expectation for their security practices, rather than safe harbor or immunity for small businesses. Small businesses must still attempt to comply with the security requirements of the SHIELD Act and are still required to implement reasonable security programs. Small businesses are defined as having fewer than fifty employees, less than $3M in gross annual revenue for each of the last three years, or less than $5M in total assets. The understanding of what is acceptable as compliant varies when considering three statutorily outlined factors:\n\nThe size and complexity of the small business;\n\nThe nature and scope of its activities; and\n\nThe sensitivity of the personal information the business collects.\n\nSo, while all businesses with private information on New York residents must comply, what will ultimately be a reasonable security program varies based on whether the business is simple like a pizza shop or complex like a small financial institution or startup biotech company.\n\nData breach notification (and changes to the statute)\n\nThe data breach notification obligations stemming from the SHIELD Act came into effect in October of 2019. They utilize the same broad and encompassing definition of private information that applies to the security obligations.\n\nAn obligation to send out a breach notification arises if a “breach of the security of the system” is discovered or detected, or reasonably believed to have occurred, that allows access or acquisition to a system that has private information on “any resident of New York … without valid authorization.” The SHIELD Act expanded the original requirement to now also include unauthorized access instead of just acquisition. This change dramatically expands the scope of the data breach obligations and further necessitates the need for robust technical safeguards that can detect an intrusion that allows either access to or acquisition of private information.\n\nTo determine if a breach has occurred, the Act recommends that you look for indicators that information:\n\nis in the physical possession or control of an unauthorized person\n\nhas been downloaded or copied, or\n\nhas been used in an unauthorized way such as if fraudulent accounts are being opened or identity theft is reported.\n\nThese breach notification requirements make it essential that your business have the security infrastructure necessary to recognize and detect if information has been viewed or used by someone that was not authorized to do so.\n\nExceptions to the data breach notification requirements\n\n“Good faith access to, or acquisition of, private information by an employee” for business purposes “is not a breach … provided that the private information is not used or subject to unauthorized disclosure.” The SHIELD Act does not consider inadvertent access or disclosure by an authorized individual to be a data breach necessitating notification. This exception applies only if a reasonable determination was made that the exposure is not likely to result in misuse, financial harm, or emotional harm. Essentially, this exception permits the use of private information for business purposes if there is not likely to be any misuse or harm stemming from the use.\n\nAdditionally, data breach notifications that are compliant with GLBA, HIPAA, HITECH, New York’s 23 NYCRR Part 500, and “any other” federal or New York state regulation or law will satisfy the SHIELD Act’s requirement.\n\nForm and delivery of notices in the case of a breach\n\nA proper data breach notification informs the affected New York residents in “the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay.” Affected residents, the New York Attorney General (if over 500 residents’ information breached), the New York state department, the New York state police, and the consumer reporting agencies (if over 5,000 residents’ information breached) all need to be provided notice of a breach. Notices to the government organizations need to contain the timing and content for notices to affected individuals, and the approximate number of affected persons from a breach. Notices to affected residents can be done through a variety of media, including:\n\nWritten or Electronic (if the subject has consented to electronic notice)\n\nBy phone or through email (if the breached information doesn’t include email addresses in combination with passwords)\n\nConspicuous posting on the business’s website\n\nNotifying major statewide media\n\nOther substitute notice if the cost exceeds $250,000, the affected individuals exceeds 500,000, or the organization does not have the necessary information to provide notice\n\nThese notices must include:\n\nThe contact information of the organization making the notice\n\nThe contact information of state and federal agencies that can provide information on security breach responses for preventing identity theft\n\nA description of the categories of private information implicated in the breach, including the specific elements of private information that were believed to have been accessed or acquired\n\nThe act also contains additional reporting requirements. For instance, the New York Attorney General is to be notified within 10 days after a determination is made that the breach is unlikely to result in misuse or cause financial or emotional harm or within five business days of notifying the secretary of state when complying with HIPAA.\n\nWhat was the timeline for businesses to become compliant?\n\nThe SHIELD Act is now fully in effect. On October 23, 2019 the law came into effect with respect to the changed breach notification requirements. On March 21, 2020 the enhanced security measure requirements for businesses that handle the private information of New York residents came into effect.\n\nIf your organization possesses the private information of New York residents, this law applies to you and your organization will need to begin compliance efforts immediately.\n\nWhat is the audit process to identify shortcomings?\n\nShortcomings in compliance efforts can be addressed in a few ways. For instance, consider consulting our SHIELD Act compliance checklist against the policies and procedures within your organization. This will allow for a simple precursory way to audit your organization, but a more comprehensive approach by privacy and security professionals may be needed.\n\nAnother way to internally test compliance is to do a dry run of a breach incident with your organization’s employees to test policies, procedures, and training. This can directly test the deployment (or existence) of administrative safeguards like how employees follow procedures and their security training. Internal audits can also assess technical and physical safeguards. For instance, consider if all the devices within your company’s infrastructure are running the most current versions of your cybersecurity program and have maintained the same appropriate firewall configuration. Deviations or variance in the variations across devices may signal a need for further compliance efforts and pose potential risk vectors for a breach. This is just one simple step of many that your organization can undertake to test or audit its technical safeguards.\n\nIn addition, employees can also be used to assess physical safeguards like workplace security and the effectiveness of access controls. If your employees can get access to workstations or information security systems that they are not authorized on, then your organization will need to reassess its practices. A thorough and robust approach to assessing your security program is through a privacy risk assessment. This can be done internally but can be immensely time consuming, so if your organization does not have the capacity or manpower to spare, consider hiring a privacy consultant or using a privacy risk management software.\n\nYour security program can also be audited externally by hiring a consultant. These consultants can conduct a privacy impact assessment and provide consultation on how to bring your organization into compliance. A privacy impact assessment will serve as a comprehensive way to audit your company’s compliance shortcomings.\n\nIf your business operates digitally and collects information, presume that the New York SHIELD Act will apply to you or your organization. Every company that has a New York customer or the private information of a New York resident will need to implement the basic requirements of this Act.\n\nThe SHIELD Act recognizes an effective data security program as one that incorporates administrative, technical, and physical safeguards. To comply, the SHIELD Act lays out its requirements rather clearly and simply by requiring the implementation and maintenance of a reasonable data security program. Below is a checklist of items for SHIELD Act compliance.\n\n1. Security Program\n\nIf your organization does not have a comprehensive security program, consider developing an action or to-do list. Through that you can identify both your organization’s security weaknesses and needs but also demonstrate tangible progress to regulators.\n\n2. Administrative Safeguards\n\nAsk if your organization has administrative safeguards that satisfy the SHIELD Act? If no, implement the policies and procedures that the SHIELD Act suggests including by:\n\nAppointing someone to coordinate the security program\n\nIdentifying reasonably foreseeable internal and external risks\n\nAssessing safeguards and compare them to identified risks\n\nTraining employees in security procedures\n\nSelecting service providers that also maintain appropriate security practices and requiring them in contracts\n\nAssessing security programs as circumstances and threats evolve\n\n3. Technical Safeguards\n\nDoes your organization have reasonable technical safeguards, such as sensitive data discovery or data classification, that satisfy the SHIELD Act? If no, implement the policies and procedures that the SHIELD Act suggests including a system that:\n\nAssesses risks in network and software design\n\nAssesses risks in information processing, transmission, and storage\n\nDetects, prevents and responds to attacks or systems failures\n\nRegularly tests and monitors the effectiveness of access keys, key controls, systems and procedures\n\n4. Physical Safeguards\n\nDoes your organization have reasonable physical safeguards that satisfy the SHIELD Act? If no, implement the policies and procedures that the SHIELD Act suggests including a system that:\n\nAssesses the risks of information storage and disposal\n\nDetects, prevents, and responds to intrusions\n\nProtects against unauthorized access to or use of private information (throughout the data lifecycle from collection to transportation and destruction or disposal)\n\nDisposes of private information within a reasonable amount of time after it is no longer needed\n\n5. Considerations for Small Businesses\n\nSmall businesses (fewer than 50 employees, less than $3 million per year gross annual revenue, or less than $5 million in year-end total assets) should attempt to comply with the security program requirements, discussed in Points 1-4. However, the SHIELD Act recognizes that privacy compliance can be a difficult and expensive task. As such, there is some leniency for small businesses.\n\nSmall businesses must still implement reasonable security programs (but the perception of what is reasonable shifts)\n\nSmall business security programs will be acceptable if they are appropriate for the:\n\nSize and complexity of the small business\n\nNature and scope of its activities\n\nSensitivity of the personal information the business collects\n\n6. Unauthorized Access Detection\n\nEnsure that you have a system in place to detect the unauthorized access or use of information that would give rise to the SHIELD Act’s breach notification requirements. Train your employees to ensure they will also recognize when a breach may have occurred.\n\nIt is worth noting that the SHIELD Act recognizes compliance with GLBA, HIPAA, and other New York security regulations as being reasonable security measures. The same logic is applied to breach notification requirements, wherein they will also be satisfied if you comply with the requirements of other federal or state laws and regulations.\n\n7. Breach Notification Procedure\n\nEstablish a procedure for issuing notices to those affected by a data breach, in the event that you detect one."
