Of these, the shift from a natural disaster orientation in the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to an ‘all-hazards’ approach centred on terrorism was one of the more significant shifts in policy substance and governing strategy. The new focus was consequential because it organised attention within FEMA, making it organisationally difficult to balance traditional concerns for disaster management, mitigation and response with new priorities for human-induced disasters, particularly terrorism.\n\nAttention shifts like the turn to ‘all-hazards’ in FEMA present peculiar problems for organisations. These shifts do not demand increased or decreased attention to issues already on the agenda. They represent new substantive dimensions of issues. The organisation of bureaucracies channels attention to component dimensions of problems (Arrow, 1974; May et al, 2008). Suppose the new demands for attention and monitoring cannot be accommodated within the organisational structure, as it is mapped onto substantive problems. In that case, the result is agenda disruption and, potentially, policy failures (May et al, 2009).\n\nBureaucracies are not all organised the same way. Some are more adaptive to agenda change than others. Research in political institutions and public policy has suggested that various processes of policymaking and types of institutions exhibit differential distributions of policy change (Jones et al, 2003; Breunig and Koski, 2006; Robinson et al, 2007). While much of this work has addressed public budgeting, the challenges presented by a diverse agenda are less studied. Few studies have addressed whether the same pattern of policymaking found in budgets and legislatures comes to the fore in public bureaucracies, specifically for regulatory policy. In particular, US federal bureaucracies are perhaps more institutionally varied than any other organisations in American politics. The bureaucracy’s institutional variation coincides with a regulatory agenda akin to lawmaking, presenting methodological challenges distinct from modelling budgets.\n\nWe argue that the delegation of attention in larger bureaucracies makes them more adaptive to substantive agenda change and shifting attention among problems. Both substantive specialisation and functional differentiation characterise organisations. Substantive specialisation refers to the ability of units within an organisation to parse the components of a larger policy problem and delegate these to substantively specialised offices within the organisation. Functional differentiation refers to specialisation by function, even within units dedicated to the same topical problem (for example, rate-setting versus distributing funds). By ‘larger’, we mean bureaucracies that contain substantively and functionally diverse units for dealing with a policy problem, not an organisation’s sheer size and resources. The delegation of attention differs from the delegation of authority regarding agenda setting, allowing organisations to confront substantive attention shifts and alleviate decision costs. This logic runs afoul of traditional notions of transaction costs and smaller, more agile organisations. Nevertheless, in institutions and policymaking systems confronting decision costs and institutional friction (Jones and Baumgartner, 2005), bureaucracies with robust delegation can better process the information on the agenda.\n\nWe use a new data set on the regulatory agenda of the US federal bureaucracy from 2008 to 2016 to examine two questions. We conceptualise the regulatory agenda as the substantive regulatory proposals developed by executive branch agencies over time. These are the rules bureaucracies developed for administering programmes and adapting statutes to work on the ground. The Administrative Procedures Act (APA) of 1946 contains the process for issuing and revising regulatory proposals and policies. This set of proposals constituting the regulatory agenda appears in the Unified Agenda of executive branch agencies. While rules are but one indicator of bureaucratic agendas (for example, spending, guidance documents, enforcement activity), they are a particularly important one constituting the most time- and resource-intensive activity that bureaucracies undertake (Kerwin, 2003). First, we ask whether regulatory policy displays the same leptokurtic distribution found for other policy processes. Second, we ask whether bureaucracies are uniformly similar in this characteristic shape or whether the patterns differ by organisational configuration. The same pattern of central peaks and fat tails characterise regulatory policy across the federal bureaucracy, as does agenda, policy and budgetary change. We also find that federal agencies lodged within departmental structures display smoother, less leptokurtic distributions than independent regulatory agencies, commissions and boards. This finding suggests that the cognitive limits of attention may be more acute than institutional friction in shaping regulatory change. These findings are important for the interdependence of transaction and decision costs in the design of institutions and systems of governance.\n\nIn what follows, we first address the distinction between organisational transaction costs and decision costs. We suggest that, while delegation induces transaction costs, it is a salve for the decision costs faced by organisations with diverse agendas. We then discuss delegation and institutional friction related to attention shifts and the nature of problems on the agenda. We distinguish between delegated authority and the delegation of attention. Bureaucracies can be characterised by their organisational configuration relating to the delegation of attention. We offer a research design that is straightforward and addresses the regulatory agenda of the entire federal bureaucracy. Finally, we discuss our findings considering organisational design and avenues for a more nuanced understanding of the organisation in the context of institutional friction and attention shifts.\n\nBackground\n\nFor some time now, public policy scholars have pointed to attention shifts and institutional friction as key to understanding the dynamics of policy change (Jones and Baumgartner, 2005; Baumgartner and Jones, 2009). Attention shifts comprise shifts in substantive focus between or among issues or between or among dimensions of a single issue. Scholars classify the substantive content of agenda items, policies or budgetary categories and can gauge shifts in content across political systems, organisations or institutions (Jones, 2015). This research has led to a wealth of understanding about systematic, institutional and issue differences in policy agendas and change. The research has also helped to establish the well-known pattern of punctuated policy change, whereby short periods of drastic policy change punctuate incremental policy change.\n\nPolitical institutions funnel attention to various issues on the agenda in most of these depictions of the policy process. Institutions cannot allocate attention to the range of issues and impose costs on issue prioritisation. Institutional friction is generally conceived as the costs imposed by systems or institutions as they translate inputs into outputs. Institutional friction is somewhat less understood than attention shifts between and among issues, though some key findings have emerged.\n\nWe know that some policy processes and systems impose more friction than others, as evidenced by the distribution of outputs generated by these systems. Processes at the front end of the policy process, such as agenda setting, suggest less friction than policymaking. Getting an issue on most institutions’ agenda is easier than enacting policy (Jones et al, 2003). Political systems that impose institutional or coalition divisions (for example, coalition government, bicameralism, presidential systems, or federalism) contain greater friction and more leptokurtosis than do unitary systems dominated by a few parties (Jones et al, 2009: 868–869). Fragmented systems increase both decision and transaction costs.\n\nThe distinction between the costs imposed on policymaking systems or within political institutions is important. Jones, Sulkin and Larsen (2003: 154) discuss four costs that systems or institutions may impose on the policy process. Decision costs are the costs of agreeing (particularly steep in pluralistic democracies). In economics, transaction costs are those faced in enforcing and implementing an agreement (or contract). Information costs arise when gathering information relevant to a decision or are associated with the search process, especially under uncertainty about the nature of the problem (Workman et al, 2017). Finally, cognitive costs are at work when individuals or organisations stretch their capacity for information processing to their limits.\n\nStudies of institutional friction have overwhelmingly focused on decision costs as the key driver of disproportionate information processing – the characteristic leptokurtosis evidenced in policy change distributions. Information costs are far less studied because pluralistic systems generate a robust flow of information (Baumgartner and Jones, 2015). In the context of bureaucracies in the United States and Europe, the operation of institutional friction is less clear. The standard mantra is that bureaucracies greatly increase transaction costs as political overseers attempt to mitigate and constrain bureaucratic drift (Epstein and O’Halloran, 1999; Huber and Shipan, 2002). There is a need, however, to understand institutional friction in the context of delegation and the characteristics of bureaucracies.\n\nFurthermore, the justification for problem-solving bureaucracy is generating flows of information about important policy problems (Workman, 2015). Within this context, we think delegation bears directly on the information costs confronted by political institutions. With this in mind, we argue that policy scholars should begin to pay more attention to the costs associated with information, particularly institutional problem searches.\n\nFrom this larger systems perspective, scholars researching the impact of organisational characteristics find that high performance and low turnover lead to more incremental, smoother budgetary changes (Flink, 2017). This research further suggests that organisational performance is resilient in the face of budget instability, though more successful at buffering large cuts than seizing the opportunity of large increases (Chen and Flink, 2022). Torfs, Wayenberg and Danneels (2022) find that institutional shifts are key in directing substantive policy in the case of digital policy, clearly linking organisational change to substantive policy directions as a mechanism and strategy for change. We build on this research by examining organisational forms as a separate influence on the shape of policy change.\n\nDelegation and institutional friction\n\nCentralised governing arrangements greatly exacerbate the costs of information, search and cognition (that is, information processing), which is easy to see in the extreme case of authoritarian regimes. By centralising power and streamlining organisational forms such that strict hierarchy prevails, authoritarian governments experience greater probabilities for episodic, disjointed policy change (Baumgartner et al, 2017). Lam and Chan (2015) show that government spending is punctuated in Hong Kong in an analysis that straddles the period of colonial and post-colonial regimes. Disaggregated decision-making mitigates against punctuations.\n\nThe degree of punctuation in authoritarian regimes also strongly relates to information flows. Chan and Zhao (2016) examine Chinese governing regions and find that regions with less social opposition and in the absence of groups and veto players to obstruct policy response are even more punctuated than expected, given the lack of players to block policy change. They attribute this to a lack of information flow about problems – leading to long periods of non-response and subsequent policy disasters. Likewise, Fagan (2022) finds that systems with more veto players and weak information flows lead to punctuated change. He suggests that policy failures result from the centralisation of decision processes and more so in systems where veto players can dampen or eliminate government responses to problems. Governing systems order themselves from closed autocracies to electoral democracies in decreasing risk of catastrophic policy failure. This finding holds across all types of policy disasters – natural, technological and financial.\n\nJones, Epp and Baumgartner (2019) provide a more general framework for aligning the relative system openness and the distribution of policy change. They point to institutional friction and information flows but add that systems must have incentives to respond, whether political or substantive and urgent. The centralised or decentralised nature of decision-making conditions these responses. Building on this framework, Sebők, Balázs and Molnár (2022) examine three Hungarian regimes over 73 years. A key finding is that hybrid regimes lying between the ideals of open or closed systems vary greatly concerning policy dynamics, as the four factors identified by Jones, Epp and Baumgartner (2019) interact and mix in different proportions.\n\nEven within more open forms of government, closed systems experience more difficulty processing information than open systems leading to more disjointed policymaking. Epp (2015) finds significant differences in the outcomes of deliberative decision-making systems and market systems. The key distinction is that deliberative systems involve bargaining, coordination and interaction; that is, outcomes depend on the actors’ interaction. Market systems for decision-making are aggregations of the decisions of independent actors. While both exhibit the classic ‘fat-tails’ behaviour of decision systems, markets are much less so. In bureaucratic units, this interdependence arises doubly – from deliberative decision-making systems and the organisational design’s hierarchical nested nature.\n\nEpp and Baumgartner (2017) also find that the institutional complexity of a policy area induces more episodic policy dynamics. This type of jurisdictional overlap and occurring in spending for a particular issue leads to positive feedback in large-scale policy changes. Overall, this research identifies the interaction and interdependency of decision processes as key forces in punctuated policy change. Collective decision-making models outperform deliberative models in smoothing policy change across various systems, sectors and organisational types (Epp, 2018).\n\nInstitutional costs and organisational design\n\nDegrees of centralisation of information and decision-making and the complexity of the policy issue are important in explaining the relative adaptivity of policy change. However, there is a need to understand how these operate within the architecture of organisations (Simon, 1996). Most of these studies occur at the stage of policymaking, while in advanced systems, policy implementation largely determines how these decisions connect to system and societal outcomes.\n\nIn understanding how institutional friction may operate at the level of bureaucracies, it is useful to consider the differential impacts of delegation on the array of institutional costs. Delegation induces transaction costs and, perhaps, decision costs. At the same time, delegation is a salve for information and cognitive costs. Most institutional analyses addressing delegation centre on the impact of delegation at the back end of the policy process. However, to understand the importance of delegation in alleviating information, search and cognitive costs, we need to consider what delegation does at the front end of the policy process, where organisations develop agendas and define problems. It is here that information and cognitive costs are at their highest.\n\nWhen attention shifts cripple bureaucracies and induce instability in the agenda, they do so because they introduce new issues or dimensions of issues relevant to understanding the problem, destabilising existing patterns of issue attention. In other words, the organisational structure cannot contain the problems within its sub-units and agencies. In this instance, collective decision-making across the range of issues becomes deliberative decision-making within an issue as bureaucracies must grapple with one another over policymaking and seek out information unavailable within their structures. As the problem begins to span substantive and functional boundaries, policy change becomes more vulnerable to positive feedback and punctuated change. When new issues intrude, policymaking systems must attend to and define them. In prioritising issues and problem definition, information costs are high, and bureaucracies are front and centre.\n\nIn addition to the costs incurred in problem search and definition to understand and frame the problem for action, new issues test the carrying capacity for new issues on the institutional agenda. At some level of aggregation, organisations of all types have limited attention. The delegation of attention and problem-solving in bureaucracies is a triage when viewed from the front end of the policy process. Larger bureaucracies with robust substantive policymaking sub-units can diagnose incoming policy issues and delegate to substantively differentiated organisational sub-units. The delegation of attention alleviates cognitive costs by allowing the organisation to address more problems than it would otherwise be able to. These bureaucracies can better process diverse policy problems simultaneously and in parallel. It alleviates informational costs because substantively oriented organisational sub-units can gain from the comparative advantage in expertise.\n\nCentralised or smaller organisations are often considered more nimble, efficient and responsive. However, these same organisations also face more acute cognitive limits in addressing new issues and shifting substantive focus. Regarding information and search costs, smaller or more centralised organisations face trade-offs in shifting substantive focus and expertise (for example, FEMA and all-hazards preparedness). In addition, smaller, centralised institutions have a lower capacity for issues. Given these, information, search and cognitive costs are generally higher.\n\nResearch investigating punctuated policymaking is supportive of this distinction. Robinson et al, (2007: 146-7) find that centralisation drives larger, punctuated policy changes in bureaucracies. He further finds that smaller organisations are prone to punctuations on both the positive and negative sides of budgetary change distributions. Bureaucratisation in public schools is associated with reductions in punctuated budgetary change distributions. These papers suggest that delegation, and larger bureaucracies, reduce the slip–stick, lurching policy dynamics evident in other realms of the policy process. From the transaction and decision costs’ perspective, the bureaucracy would seem anathema to enabling proportional information processing. But, from the vantage point of information, search and cognitive costs, they are superior to their leaner, centralised counterparts.\n\nBecause of complex boundary-spanning problems, substantive specialisation and functional differentiation, organisations cannot grow out of the vagaries of shifting policy problems. Organisations, both large and small, can be substantively or functionally narrow. More than personnel, budgets or bricks-and-mortar, the crucial link between bureaucracies and problem-solving in an adaptable way is the fit of the organisational structure in terms of topical expertise and function to the set of problems it means to solve. In the extreme case, the organisational structure is the organisation’s agenda (Hammond, 1986).\n\nThe logic and concern for information, search and cognitive costs also apply to the different policymaking processes. In part, agenda setting is less punctuated, or leptokurtic, because it is the state of the process preoccupied with problem definition and issue prioritisation, where information and cognitive costs are higher. Agenda setting is a more delegated process than legislating, for instance. The US Congress is instructive on this point. The institution delegates attention to members and committees for raising and prioritising issues on the agenda. This process is information-intensive and geared towards defining problems for action. Decisions on the floor are a centralised process involving the decision costs associated with bargaining and compromise.\n\nThe nature of policy dynamics can make information, search and cognitive costs more acute. Boundary-spanning problems fuse multiple traditional understandings of issues (May et al, 2011). The rise of boundary-spanning problems (for example, homeland security, climate change, infrastructure development) tests the limits of all types of bureaucracies. In addition, bureaucracies compete to supply information on policy problems, define problems, and steer resulting policy. As issue agendas change, bureaucracies configured to delegate attention and attend to multiple, diverse substantive issues simultaneously can better address boundary-spanning problems and craft problem definitions that combine substantive expertise from numerous areas.\n\nThis discussion leads to a few direct expectations concerning the shape of regulatory agenda change and the relationship between organisational types, configurations and regulatory agenda change. First, we expect regulatory agenda change to exhibit the same characteristic leptokurtosis – with tall central peaks and fat tails – as with other agenda and policy changes. These typical distributions have excess mass in the centre and tails of the distribution at the expense of the shoulders. In regulatory agenda change, this means excess cases of incremental or no change in the presence of large punctuated negative and positive changes. It also means that the shoulders of the distribution are underpopulated, meaning there are fewer cases of moderate proportional regulatory changes.\n\nHypothesis 1: General punctuation hypothesis – the regulatory agenda for all bureaucracies and organisational designs contain punctuations (that is, be leptokurtic), exhibiting greater mass in the tails than would be predicted by a normal distribution.\n\nSecond, we expect ordering in the distributions owing to organisational type and our arguments concerning delegation and information costs. We expect larger organisations to be substantively specialised and functionally differentiated concerning their sub-units, like agencies, services and bureaus. Substantive specialisation and functional differentiation will be greatest in Cabinet departments and grow narrower in topical and functional variation as we move to smaller independent regulatory agencies and government corporations. Specifically, we expect federal agencies and offices within Cabinet-level bureaucracies to exhibit less punctuated distributions, with lower kurtosis than independent agencies, commissions and boards. Independent agencies and boards, in turn, will exhibit lower kurtosis than government corporations.\n\nHypothesis 2: Organisational design – we expect Cabinet departments, independent agencies, and government corporations to order themselves from least to most leptokurtic regarding regulatory agendas. Further, we expect our generalised extreme value (GEV) models (below) to yield shape parameters consistent with this greater probability in the tails of the distribution moving over these types.\n\nResearch design\n\nOur approach to research design follows standard procedures common in the study of policy change distributions. The approach is distributional and based on stochastic process methodology. In this instance, we will rely on histograms of the first differences of regulatory agenda change and the calculation of l-kurtosis scores for each distribution (Hosking, 1990; Breunig, 2006) to establish evidence that regulatory change follows the characteristic pattern of policy change. This approach offers evidence of these expectations and builds an edifice for further exploration.\n\nTo examine these theoretical expectations, we amass a new, unique data set of all federal regulatory agenda items across the federal bureaucracy from 2008 to 2016. Our indicator of the regulatory agenda is the Unified Agenda (UA), which appears in the Federal Register biannually, once in the spring and once in the autumn (usually April and October). The UA catalogues all the regulatory agenda items which executive branch agencies reasonably expect to take action in the coming 12 months, subject to the rule-making procedures of the APA.\n\nFor example, consider the following proposed rule:\n\nThis rule would propose to revise the Bureau of Land Management’s fire trespass and cost recovery regulations. The changes would help prevent wildfires by creating a more effective deterrent to human-caused wildfires and unauthorized burning of public lands and make it easier for the agency to recover damages from wildfires.\n\nThe rule with Regulatory Identification Number (RIN) 1004-AE88 is currently on the agenda for the Department of the Interior. It clarifies that its purpose is preventing further human-caused wildfires by stiffening rules and penalties for wildfire damage due to trespassing. These policies are implemented and enforced by the Bureau for Land Management. The prioritisation of these policies looms large as fire damage, particularly wildfire smoke, is a pressing problem resulting from climate change. This data type allows us to connect organisational designs with the dynamics of policy change.\n\nData, coding and measures\n\nIn all, there were 63,289 entries in the UA over this period. For each entry, the UA catalogues the agency issuing the rule and the parent department or agency (in the case of independents). This information made categorising each rule as coming from a department, an independent regulatory agency, a commission or board, or a governmental corporation possible. In many cases, classification into the first of these categories was straightforward, as most departmental regulations were easily identifiable. For example, the UA labels regulations from agencies or programmes within the Department of Agriculture as such. This was the case for rules published by each department, defined as agencies headed by a cabinet secretary.\n\nFor independent agencies, classification was not always as easily accomplished and proved quite difficult in a few cases. Independent agencies, commissions and boards exist outside the cabinet departments. They are created to focus on issue areas that do not fit within the purview of the established departments and thus are not under the authority of a cabinet secretary. Instead, these bodies are, in most cases, accountable directly to Congress. Additionally, independent boards and commissions are often headed by groups of directors rather than a single individual, as in the cabinet departments. While it was easy to classify some independent agencies as fitting into this category (for example, Environmental Protection Agency), others were unclear. Particularly difficult to categorise were those agencies whose names and missions appeared to align with a cabinet department but were organisationally separate from them (for example, Financial Stability Oversight Council). In these instances, we relied on the classifications provided by the Office for Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) or agency websites.\n\nOur final category for organisational design and coding the regulations is governmental corporations. These organisations are corporations owned by the federal government. They operate in the same way as a privately owned business (though without generating an excess profit) and typically self-fund a significant portion of their operations through customer fees. Examples of this type of organisation in the data set include the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Export–Import Bank of the United States. Once again, we relied on OIRA classifications and agency websites when the appropriate category was not easily discernible.\n\nFor each of these issuing agencies or offices, we aggregated the total number of rules for each agency for each issue or edition of the UA. Using these data, we constructed counts of agency regulations on the agenda for each agency and edition. This yields a series for each agency using the UA edition as a biannual measure of regulatory agenda activity. Given that agencies may withdraw regulations for myriad reasons, we use all actions currently on the agenda.\n\nUsing these count measures, we also constructed the biannual first differences of the counts of regulatory proposals. We calculate the change in biannual agency entries as ∆t = at − at−1. In other words, the change in the current biannual period is the current edition’s count of agenda items minus the previous edition’s count for each agency issuing regulations. These simple measures lend themselves to stochastic processes or distributional approaches to policy change.\n\nMethods\n\nIn the case of the calculated changes, we use both distributional representations of the data and calculate l-kurtosis in the standard way (Jones et al, 2009; Breunig and Jones, 2011). This simple but powerful approach addresses whether regulatory agendas follow the same characteristic pattern of leptokurtic change distributions – distributions with excess cases in the centre (that is, peaked-ness) and excess cases in the tails (that is, fat tails). These distributions have a dearth of cases in their shoulders, indicating lower-than-expected instances of moderate change. We also expect the leptokurtosis to vary systematically with the organisational locus of the agency.\n\nOnce we establish that regulatory agendas follow the same characteristic pattern of policy change, we turn to extreme value analysis (EVA). Extreme value analysis is a set of statistical methods geared toward extreme deviations from the medians of probability distributions. It is used extensively in the study of disasters and insurance, where analysts attempt to gauge the probability of observing cases in the extreme tails of a distribution. Specifically, we use the generalised Pareto distribution (GPD) combined with a peak-over-threshold approach (Leadbetter, 1991) to examine the probabilities of extreme realisations of regulatory change. In this approach, the analyst first estimates a threshold subjectively, with knowledge of the data, or derived empirically with reference to some measure of the skewed distribution’s centre mass. We set our threshold at the median value for the regulatory agenda distributions and then use this threshold to model excess peaks.\n\nUsing maximum likelihood estimation, we estimate the fit of the GPD to the regulatory agenda. Specifying a peaks-over-threshold approach, the log-likelihood of the GPD is as follows:\n\nIn Equation 1, the regulatory agenda, yi, is modelled as a GPD conditional on scale parameter σ and shape parameter ξ. The shape parameter is the most important as it determines the tail behaviour of the GPD. For our purposes here, differences in the shape parameter indicate where there are differences in tail behaviour based on our coded organisational types. Equation 1 also contains the parameter µ, which accounts for the number of excess peaks given our estimation of the data’s threshold. After fitting the GPD model to the regulatory agenda for organisational types, we examine the probabilities of excess tails for the different organisational types to ascertain whether an agency’s organisational locus influences tail behaviour in the regulatory change distributions.\n\nFindings\n\nFigure 1 displays the histograms and normal density estimates for regulatory agenda change for all agencies (top left), departments (top right), independents (bottom left), and government corporations (bottom right). Figure 1 confirms the general pattern of policy change distributions from previous research. Our first expectation about the peaks of the distributions and fat tails is evident in the data. The characteristic pattern holds for all agencies and each organisational type we coded in the sample.\n\nThe second and more important finding in Figure 1 is that there appears to be an ordering to the degree of punctuated regulatory change. Figure 1 shows that this ordering follows our expectations about the effect of organisational locus. Agencies lodged within departmental structures exhibit less peaked centre mass and slimmer tails than agencies or offices within independent regulatory agencies or government corporations. We would, however, caution against drawing too many conclusions from the government corporations data as the sample size here warrants much further exploration. These ranges follow our expected ordering despite similarities in their centre masses. Agencies within departments have a mean of 16.22 and a standard deviation of 36.78 regulatory proposals. The same number for independent regulatory agencies, commissions and boards is 16.62 and 29.00, respectively. Government corporations issue many fewer, with a mean of 8.33 and a standard deviation of 9.03.\n\nThe simple histograms confirm our first expectation, but of course, this sort of ‘ocular’ verification is less reliable than a measure of kurtosis of the distributions. Standard kurtosis measures are unstable for most policy studies’ small distributions and sample sizes. Table 1 uses the L-moments methodology of Hosking (1990) as brought to political science by Breunig (2006), which is more reliable and consistent in smaller sample sizes. For reference, a standard normal distribution would exhibit an l-kurtosis of 0.123. Values of l-kurtosis exceeding 0.123 indicate leptokurtic distributions, with classic peaked-ness and fat tails common in many policy change distributions. Values lower than 0.123 indicate platykurtic distributions, which are ‘flatter’ than the normal Gaussian. Table 1 also records the inter-septile range and the L-skewness of the distributions.\n\nTable 1\n\nInter-septile rangea L-kurtosis L-skew All types 30.00 0.54 0.54 Departments 27.10 0.51 –0.03 Independents 35.82 0.59 –0.04 Corporations 21.00 0.63 –0.03\n\nIn Table 1, the distribution for all agencies and those broken down by organisational locus exhibit l-kurtosis well above what we might observe in a normal distribution. The table lends numerical verification to the ocular verification in Figure 1: the inter-septile range and the l-kurtosis exhibit ordering in line with our theoretical expectations. The range for l-kurtosis is 0.51 for agencies located within departmental structures to 0.63 for government corporations. Table 1 thus provides some initial support for our second expectation concerning organisational types. Agencies lodged in departmental designs exhibit less l-kurtosis than independent agencies, boards, and government corporations.\n\nFigure 2 uses the counts of the regulatory agenda for each agency to display distributions with the long, fat tails characteristic of policy change distributions and the classes of generalised extreme value distributions (GEV). Again, organisational type orders the distributions in Figure 2. While GEV behaviour characterises all agencies, agencies within departmental structures (top right) are less so than their counterparts in independent commissions, boards, or government corporations. Figure 2 strongly suggests the appropriateness of EVA for investigating the policy dynamics associated with the regulatory agenda of the US federal bureaucracy.\n\nWe use the peaks-over-threshold approach to fit a GPD to the regulatory agenda. Generally, the analyst chooses a threshold above which the tail behaviour of a GPD characterises the distribution. This approach demands the choice of an appropriate threshold, and in general, there are three methods. First, the analyst may choose subjectively, relying on the threshold range plot or mean excess plot and knowledge of the data-generating process. Second, the analyst might make an empirical choice by fitting several GPDs across a range of threshold values and using statistics such as the log-likelihood to decide on the threshold. Caution is needed here. With large values for the threshold, the maximum likelihood estimator has less information on which to arrive at the parameter values for the GPD. In the third and simplest approach, the analyst can look at the distributions and choose a threshold according to a convenient mode or median value. We opt for the third and simplest approach and set our threshold value at the median for the pooled regulatory change distribution. This allows us to compare organisational types across the range of quantiles in our model.\n\nTable 2 displays the GPD fits for the regulatory agenda for pooled organisations and then separately for the subset of agencies located within departmental, independent and government corporation structures. The scale and shape parameters define the GPD. For purposes here, the shape parameter is the most important, as it determines the tail behaviour of the GPD. Each estimated shape parameter is greater than zero, ξ > 0. These indicate that the GPD fit for these data has no upper bound. Each of the scale and shape parameters for the distributions is statistically significant. In comparing them, the ordering by organisational locus of the agency follows our theoretical expectations. Independent agencies and government corporations have smaller-scale parameters than the departmental or pooled fit. This indicates fatter tails for independent boards and commissions and governmental corporations.\n\nTable 2:\n\nScalea Shapea −Log(L) BIC All organisations 17.18 (0.63) 0.36 (0.03) 7974.91 15964.91 Cabinet departments 14.83 (0.64) 0.42 (0.04) 5597.43 11209.30 Independents 26.24 (1.87) 0.15 (0.06) 2141.10 4294.57 Government corporations 20.00 (0.00) –1.00\n\n(0.00) 101.86 210.77\n\nThe GPD models support our theoretical expectations concerning the influence of organisational types on information processing. Agencies and offices lodged within departmental structures experience relatively more adaptive, or at least proportional, patterns of regulatory change. These agencies are not forced to shift attention to each new problem. That is, departmental structures increase carrying capacity for addressing issues. In part, departmental structures have more ‘bins’, or boxes, to put problems as they emerge on the agenda. In addition, the delegation of attention creates a wider array of comparative advantages in departmental structures.\n\nThe figure displays the probabilities of regulatory counts lying at given quantiles exceeding the threshold of 50. Estimations are based on 10,000 simulations of the models in Table 2 at each quantile.\n\nFigure 3 displays the probabilities associated with the pooled, departmental and independent organisational structures at each quantile of the regulatory agenda distributions. Note that at each quantile beyond the median of each subset defined by organisational types, agencies and offices within independent regulatory commissions and boards have a higher probability than agencies within departmental structures in those portions of the tails. Lacking the cognitive kind of slack defining organisations that delegate attention, independent commissions and boards have fewer ‘bins’ to direct emergent policy problems. Instead, attention must shift to these problems as they arise at the expense of current agenda items. It is also the case that, lacking the comparative advantage provided by specialisation across a broad range of issues, independent commissions and boards may have to engage in problem definition – learn and understand the problem.\n\nOur findings relating the organisational locus of federal agencies to regulatory change distributions support our theoretical expectations. It also highlights the value of thinking about the policy process’s front end, not just policy implementation, when considering the bureaucracy’s role in policy change dynamics. At the front end of the policy process, where information and cognitive costs are high, organisational structures can alleviate or exacerbate these costs. We would note that the situation likely reverses in policy implementation, where there is a need for more agile and perhaps more centralised independent agencies. Where solution generation and implementation are concerned, cognitive and transaction costs are paramount in determining policy dynamics.\n\nThe distribution of policy change we document and explain in terms of organisational types is greater than that for democratic legislatures. They are comparable to the quasi-democracies or in-between systems in the existing literature where we have data. Part of the importance of understanding information processing and punctuated equilibrium within administrative units lies in this distinction. Democratic legislatures are composed of generalists who develop expertise within given issue areas over time and are free to take on new issues with ease. They are relatively open institutions, and necessarily so, as the nature of their problem is responding to the demands of citizens and groups. The governing problem that democratic legislatures aim to solve is issue prioritisation.\n\nBureaucracies differ because the governing problem they mean to solve is policy implementation. The necessity of making problem prioritisation and resultant policies work on the ground is a set of factors delimiting issues and approaches to them, as well as specific organisational structures. This starts with the organisational mission, usually defined by legislatures, directing an agency’s overall effort to address a particular substantive problem. Within the organisation, standard operating procedures specify many of an agency’s responses to various external and internal stimuli. Unlike legislatures, bureaucracies are composed of substantive and functional specialists.\n\nSubstantive specialisation is the hallmark of bureaucracies and determines how they define problems, the types of information they respond to, and the set of solutions available. Substantive specialisation is further delineated by functional differentiation. In the examples of government corporations, an agency may not only be substantively specific (for example, energy) but functionally differentiated (for example, rate-setting). Moreover, like all organisations, bureaucracies house substantive specialisation and functional differentiation within hierarchical or nested structures. In our analysis above, rule-making is the most time- and resource-expensive activity that bureaucracies undertake, further exacerbating these features. For these reasons, bureaucracies should look more punctuated than legislatures, even more so when centralised and dealing with complex problems.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis study has confirmed that the characteristic policy change distributions witnessed in public budgeting, statutes and agenda change also characterise regulatory agendas, at least for our initial sample of the UA. We have argued for an approach to theorising that better incorporates the role of delegation in understanding policy change in bureaucracies and, particularly, in regulatory policy. The interplay of delegation and the costs associated with institutional friction are fruitful theoretical focus areas.\n\nOur analysis also opens up the ‘black box’ of how organisational structures channel information and attention (Arrow, 1974). How organisations configure themselves interacts with informational and cognitive costs to structure the dynamics of policy change.\n\nThe analysis here is suggestive of several avenues for extensions. First, the data are preliminary, so some caution is necessary for generalising from these organisational distinctions. This is especially true with the government corporations category. Second, policy scholars utilising legislative-type data rather than budgets face difficulty conceptually. It is easy to categorise budgets in terms of directionality – the measure builds it in. This is not the case for substantive policies like statutes or regulations. These are policy changes of one form or another – a movement away from the status quo in a way that budgets are not. The stochastic process and distributional approach to policy dynamics have offered tremendous leverage in the study of public budgeting. However, scholars working with substantive policies have much to do in characterising policy change distributions, where the available models are not as analytically tractable.\n\nAnother avenue for future research concerns how agencies develop rules and regulations. A major delineation is the body of rules made by the typical administrative procedures outlined in the APA versus those produced from regulatory negotiation, where stakeholders actively participate from the beginning, more closely approximating a legislative process. The APA’s procedures are cumbersome because the development of rules and regulations, once finalised, have the force of an Act of Congress and are not easily adjusted. In recent years, agencies increasingly rely on guidance documents intended to govern clients’ behaviours and the regulated with respect to particular policies and programmes. Guidance documents follow a less rigorous process for promulgation and are more easily adjusted in the face of changes on the ground. They are also more ephemeral, though. We think regulatory negotiation (reg-neg) and guidance documents are great points of departure and bases of comparison in future studies. Key to these is how much organisational process matters versus organisational structure. These are important decision-making components and represent organisational choices about procedure (Potter, 2019) that bear on distributions of policy change.\n\nThe degree to which agencies interact with other actors and whether these settings are deliberative or collective choices will also bear on distributions of policy change. Agencies operate in environments where regulation could be coercive, private or voluntary (Prakash and Potoski, 2007; Mills, 2016). The deliberative or collective models for decision-making bear directly on distributions of policy change (Mills, et al, 2016; Epp, 2018; Dwidar, 2022).\n\nInformation processing requires an organisational design open to diverse streams of information. But at some level, this information must be coordinated and actionable with nimbleness and efficiency (Koski and Workman, 2018). For governance practice, our research suggests that optimal organisational designs and strategies will depend on whether the task is prioritising and defining problems or policy implementation.\n\nFunding\n\nThis work was supported by the Institute for Policy Research and Public Affairs in Eberly College at West Virginia University and jointly by the Center for Risk and Crisis Management at the University of Oklahoma.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors would like to thank Chris Koski, Christian Breunig, Bryan Jones and Hank Jenkins-Smith for valuable feedback on this manuscript.
