        "text": "FIPS 200 specifies the minimum security requirements for non-military federal information systems. It implements the authority given to NIST (US National Institute of Science and Technology) by the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2014.\n\nThe FISMA Law\n\nThe FISMA law mandated the created of federal standards for: (i) the security categorization of federal information and information systems based their risk levels in order to provide the appropriate level of security for each system; and (ii) the minimum security requirements for each such category.\n\nFIPS 200 addresses the specification of minimum security requirements for federal information and information systems. FIPS 199 addresses the classification divides systems. It divides the systems into high, moderate, and low impact systems based on their impact on individuals and organizations.\n\nFederal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)\n\nThe Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) are standards published by NIST for use by the United States federal government and government contractors in relation to computer systems. Generally compliance with the FIPS standards is mandatory, but waivers are sometimes available.\n\nRelation to FedRAMP\n\nFedRAMP is a government-wide program that builds on the FIPS requirements to provide a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services. The objective is to save government costs by implementing once, and then reusing the implementation and security assessments in many government agencies.\n\nScope of Applicability\n\nFIPS 200 generally applies to all Federal Government information and information systems, except national security systems and certain classified information.\n\nEssence of FIPS 200 - Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems\n\nFIPS 200 itself is very brief. It basically says that there are 17 security-related areas where federal agencies must meet certain minimum requirements. For the actual requirements, it refers to NIST Special Publication 800-53 and says that federal agencies must meet its requirements.\n\nThe seventeen areas are:\n\nAccess Control\n\nAwareness and Training\n\nAudit and Accountability\n\nCertification, Accreditation, and Security Assessments\n\nConfiguration Management\n\nContingency Planning\n\nIdentification and Authentication\n\nIncident Response\n\nMaintenance\n\nMedia Protection\n\nPhysical and Environmental Protection\n\nPlanning\n\nPersonnel Security\n\nRisk Assessment\n\nSystem and Services Acquisition\n\nSystem and Communications Protection\n\nSystem and Information Integrity\n\nFurther Information"
