        "text": "The Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA 2014) updates the Federal Government's cybersecurity practices by:\n\nCodifying Department of Homeland Security (DHS) authority to administer the implementation of information security policies for non-national security federal Executive Branch systems, including providing technical assistance and deploying technologies to such systems;\n\nAmending and clarifying the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) oversight authority over federal agency information security practices; and by\n\nRequiring OMB to amend or revise OMB A-130 to \"eliminate inefficient and wasteful reporting.\"\n\nOverview\n\nFISMA 2014 codifies the Department of Homeland Security’s role in administering the implementation of information security policies for federal Executive Branch civilian agencies, overseeing agencies’ compliance with those policies, and assisting OMB in developing those policies.\n\nThe legislation provides the Department authority to develop and oversee the implementation of binding operational directives to other agencies, in coordination and consistent with OMB policies and practices. It also:\n\nAuthorizes DHS to provide operational and technical assistance to other federal Executive Branch civilian agencies at the agency’s request;\n\nPlaces the federal information security incident center within DHS by law;\n\nAuthorizes DHS technology deployments to other agencies' networks (upon those agencies' request);\n\nDirects OMB to revise policies regarding notification of individuals affected by federal agency data breaches;\n\nRequires agencies to report major information security incidents as well as data breaches to Congress as they occur and annually; and\n\nSimplifies existing FISMA reporting to eliminate inefficient or wasteful reporting while adding new reporting requirements for major information security incidents.\n\nThe Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 amends the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA)."
