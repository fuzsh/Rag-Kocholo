While between cycles, solutions may not appear here.\n\nApproved Products - PIV Smart Cards\n\nThe Personal Identity Verification (PIV) cards listed below are approved for FICAM implementation under the FIPS 201 Evaluation Program. These are blank PIV cards available for purchase. A PIV service provider will personalize these blank cards for federal agencies and contractors. PIV service providers are required to use PIV cardstock from the Approved Products List (APL).\n\nIf you do not see a card below, it’s possible it’s on the Removed Product List.\n\nPlease note:\n\nTri-Interface cards are not approved for federal government PIV or CAC card use. Agencies should not procure them. They are listed on the APL for industry-only acquisition.\n\nManufacturers may call Tri-Interface cards by different names (for example, Dual Hybrid). The prohibited feature of Tri-Interface cards is a prox interface (a 125 kHz antenna).\n\nAgencies should procure only cards validated by the NIST Personal Identity Verification Program (NPIVP).\n\nApproved PIV Cards\n\nApproved PIV Cards List APL Number Product Name Valid Date 1512 ID-One PIV v 2.4.2 on Cosmo V8.2 11/16/2021 1428 ID-One PIV v 2.4.0 on Cosmo V8.1 (EEPROM) 08/15/2017 1428 ID-One PIV v 2.4.1 on Cosmo V8.1 (ROM) 11/13/2017 1428 ID-One PIV v 2.4.1 on Cosmo V8.1 (EEPROM) 11/13/2017 1355 ID-One PIV v 2.3.5 on Cosmo V8 (High Speed) 06/17/2015 1354 ID-One PIV v 2.3.5 on Cosmo V8 06/17/2015 1511 IDEMIA Cosmo V8.0 11/13/2019 1431 HID Global Crescendo PIV 01/24/2018 1500 Gemalto TOP DL v2.1 with HID Global ActivID Applet Suite v2.7.4 08/03/2018 1510 Safenet IDPrime PIV v3.0 08/01/2019 1430 Gemalto IDPrime PIV v2.1 01/10/2018 1429 Giesecke+Devrient Mobile Security SmartCafe Expert 7.0 with HID Global ActivID Applet v2.7.5 11/09/2017 1502 Giesecke+Devrient Mobile Security SmartCafe Expert 7.0 with StarSign Applet v1.0 12/13/2018\n\nLegacy PIV Cards\n\nLegacy PIV cards are no longer approved for purchase by the FIPS 201 Evaluation Program. Any cardstock designated as “legacy” is placed on this legacy list and on the Removed Product List. However, some federal agencies still need to procure the legacy cardstock to use while existing systems are being upgraded. Agencies must stop using cardstock on the legacy list by June 30, 2024.\n\nLegacy PIV cards include the following:\n\nGemalto IDCore 3020 v1, 128k dual-interface with ActivIdentity Digital Identity Applet Suite – APL# 1244\n\nGiesecke & Devrient StarSign(R) SmartCafe(R) Expert 144K with PIV Applet – APL# 525\n\nIDEMIA ID-One (Type A) Large D – APL# 587\n\nAgencies procuring cardstock from the legacy list assume all risks associated with its use from now until the NIST-mandated deadline of June 30, 2024.\n\nIf your agency needs to purchase cardstock from this legacy list, you must submit an Assumption of Risk Memorandum (memo) from the agency Chief Information Officer(s) to the General Services Administration (GSA). The memo must contain the following information:\n\nAcknowledgement of the assumption of all associated security risks;\n\nAcknowledgement of non-compliance with NIST standards;\n\nA transition plan specifying major milestones to achieve full compliance by the 2024 deadline; and\n\nImplications resulting from non-compliance with federal policy related to this purchase.\n\nSubmit the memo to GSA’s Associate Administrator for Government-wide Policy (OGP) (regardless of the acquisition vehicle used). If using GSA Multiple Award Schedule as the acquisition vehicle, also submit a copy of the memo to the Commissioner of GSA’s Federal Acquisition Service.\n\nNote that GSA will provide the Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer (OFCIO) at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) with copies of all memos submitted.\n\nRemoved Product List\n\nThe FIPS 201 Evaluation Program’s Removed Products List (RPL) displays products and services that were at one time on the Approved Products List but are no longer approved for government procurement. Due to security concerns, products on the RPL are not recommended for government acquisition. Products will be removed from the RPL after 3 years.\n\nPACS Infrastructure Category List PACS Infrastructure Category APL # Supplier Product Name(s) Product Number Removal Date Reason For Removal 10013 Identiv 13.01 - Identiv Velocity 3.8.4 w/pivCLASS validation 5.20 N/A Monday, October 16, 2023 Per vendor request 10043 American Direct Procurement, Inc.
