        "text": "Section 1 of this resolution amends Article XIV, Section 1 of the New York State Constitution. This constitutional provision, originally located in Article VII, section 7 of the Constitution, has protected Forest Preserve land since it first became effective on January 1, 1895. In the relevant part, that constitutional provision provides: The lands of the state, now owned or hereafter acquired, constituting the forest preserve as now fixed by law, shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private, nor shall the timber thereon be sold, removed, or destroyed. This proposal amends this provision to allow the State to construct, operate, and maintain Nordic and biathlon trails and appurtenances ther- eto on not more than 322.26 acres of Forest Preserve land at the Mount Van Hoevenberg Olympic Sports Complex in the Town of North Elba, Essex County. The proposal also requires that, as an offset to the use of those lands, the State would acquire at least 2500 acres of land located elsewhere for inclusion in the Forest Preserve, and would require the legislature to approve that acquisition. Further, the relevant constitution provides authority to NYCO Minerals, Inc. to engage in mineral sampling operation on 200 acres of forest preserve land in lot 8, Stowers survey, the town of Lewis, Essex county in exchange for land of equal or greater value. This proposal establishes a sunset for such authority on December 31, 2025, and clarifies that such authority is granted to the successor or assign of NYCO Minerals, Inc. JUSTIFICATION: This resolution proposes an amendment to Article XIV, Section 1 of the Constitution to protect the integrity of the Forest Preserve by consti- tutionally authorizing the existing Mount Van Hoevenberg Olympic Sports Complex and allowing for a limited expansion of the Nordic skiing and biathlon trails and appurtenances thereto that are located at the Complex, to comply with modern international standards necessary for accommodating international Nordic ski and biathlon training and events. As an offset to the land developed for the Olympic Sports Complex, the Forest Preserve will be benefited through the addition of 2500 acres of land elsewhere in the Adirondack Park. Moreover, the local and State economy will be benefited from the continued public recreational use, and national and international competitive use of the facility. The Mt. Van Hoevenberg Olympic Sports Complex traces its origins as far back as 1929 when a bobsled run was built to accommodate the 1932 Olym- pics. The Complex includes portions of the Nordic ski and biathlon trails and related facilities on Forest Preserve lands, as well as parts of the Nordic ski and biathlon trails and a bobsled run on State ease- ment land owned by the Town of North Elba. In 1969, a new and modern Nordic ski trail system was designed and constructed. This Nordic ski trail system was the first in the country planned not only for use by competitors but also for spectators and use by recreational skiers. At the time of its development, the Nordic system met the International Ski Federation (FIS) requirements for Olympic and World Class competitions. As a result of this world-class Nordic trail system, the Mount Van Hoevenberg Olympic Sports Complex played host to the Nordic and biathlon competitions during the Lake Placid 1980 Winter Olympic Games. In 1982, the Legislature created the Olympic Regional Development Authority (\"ORDA\") to operate, manage and maintain the Olympic facili- ties. Since then, the Sports Complex has been host to several national and international events, and from January 1222, 2023, the Lake Placid Olympic facilities will host the 2023 Winter World University Games Sponsored by the International University Sports Federation (\"FISU\"), the World University Games are an international sports and cultural event staged every two years in a different city worldwide. Second only to the Olympics, the 11-day competition is the second-largest multi- sport event in the world and draws more than 2,400 student-athletes together to compete in various sports and events including Nordic skiing and biathlon, as well as alpine skiing, skating, curling, hockey, and snowboarding. The continued maintenance of the Mount Van Hoevenberg Olympic Sports Complex, and the ability to implement upgrades that will meet existing Nordic skiing and biathlon international competition stan- dards, is critical to the continued attraction of such events. Portions of the Mount Van Hoevenberg Sports Complex are located on State Forest Preserve land (with other portions located on land that belongs to the Town of North Elba). Forest Preserve land is protected as \"forev- er wild forest land\" by Article XIV, Section 1 of the New York State Constitution; however, the Constitution has never been amended to explicitly authorize the Sports Complex. This amendment is intended to protect the integrity of the Forest Preserve by constitutionally author- izing the historic use of this Forest Preserve land to support world- class Nordic skiing and biathlon training and competition, as well as recreational Nordic skiing and other recreational uses by New York State residents and others, in accordance with the Legislature's intent in establishing ORDA. The proposed amendment restricts the development of this Forest Preserve land to a maximum of 322.26 acres. All structures and improvements authorized by the amendment would remain subject to approval through the Unit Management Planning process, which includes State Environmental Quality Act review, a significant public review and comment process, and a required finding by the Adirondack Park Agency that the Unit Manage- ment Plan is compliant with Adirondack Park State Land Master Plan guidelines, in accordance with Executive Law ยง 816. This amendment would provide a significant public benefit to the People of the State of New York by recognizing and preserving the unique and historic role that the Mount Van Hoevenberg Olympic Sports Complex has to our state and to the world. By recognizing the use of these lands for these discreet and limited purposes while simultaneously growing the total acreage of the Adirondack Forest Preserve by at least 2500 acres, this amendment will continue the State's 125-year commitment to protect- ing the integrity of the Forest Preserve. In 2013, Article XIV was amended to authorize the State to allow NYCO Minerals, Inc. to conduct mineral sampling operations to determine the quantity and quality of wollastonite on approximately 200 acres of Forest Preserve land in lot 8, Stowers survey, Town of Lewis in Essex County. This amendment provides that any such authorization shall be deemed null and void on or after December 31, 2025 and that NYCO Minerals, Inc. or its successors or assigns shall remediate the site from mineral sampling operations and convey to the State lands of equal or greater value to the disturbed lands, subject to approval by the Legislature. PRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY: 2021-2022: S7222A- Died in Judiciary FISCAL IMPLICATIONS: None, although the economy of the Lake Placid area and the State as a whole will benefit from the amendment. EFFECTIVE DATE: In order to make the constitutional amendment effective this concurrent resolution will also have to be approved by the next legislative session and then be approved by the voters at the subsequent election.\n\nLBD89070-01-3 S. 5540 2 north, east and northwest slopes of Whiteface Mountain in Essex county, nor from constructing and maintaining not more than twenty-five miles of ski trails thirty to two hundred feet wide, together with appurtenances thereto, provided that no more than two miles of such trails shall be in excess of one hundred twenty feet wide, on the slopes of Belleayre Moun- tain in Ulster and Delaware counties and not more than forty miles of ski trails thirty to two hundred feet wide, together with appurtenances thereto, provided that no more than eight miles of such trails shall be in excess of one hundred twenty feet wide, on the slopes of Gore and Pete Gay mountains in Warren county, nor from relocating, reconstructing and maintaining a total of not more than fifty miles of existing state highways for the purpose of eliminating the hazards of dangerous curves and grades, provided a total of no more than four hundred acres of forest preserve land shall be used for such purpose and that no single relocated portion of any highway shall exceed one mile in length. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the state may convey to the village of Saranac Lake ten acres of forest preserve land adjacent to the boundaries of such village for public use in providing for refuse disposal and in exchange therefore the village of Saranac Lake shall convey to the state thirty acres of certain true forest land owned by such village on Roaring Brook in the northern half of Lot 113, Township 11, Richards Survey.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions and subject to legislative approval of the tracts to be exchanged prior to the actual transfer of title and the conditions herein set forth, the state, in order to facilitate the preservation of historic buildings listed on the national register of historic places by rejoining an historic grouping of buildings under unitary ownership and stewardship, may convey to Sagamore Institute Inc., a not-for-profit educational organization, approximately ten acres of land and buildings thereon adjoining the real property of the Sagamore Institute, Inc. and located on Sagamore Road, near Raquette Lake Village, in the Town of Long Lake, county of Hamilton, and in exchange therefor; Sagamore Insti- tute, Inc. shall convey to the state for incorporation into the forest preserve approximately two hundred acres of wild forest land located within the Adirondack Park on condition that the legislature shall determine that the lands to be received by the state are at least equal in value to the lands and buildings to be conveyed by the state and that the natural and historic character of the lands and buildings conveyed by the state will be secured by appropriate covenants and restrictions S. 5540 3 and that the lands and buildings conveyed by the state will reasonably be available for public visits according to agreement between Sagamore Institute, Inc. and the state. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions the state may convey to the town of Arietta fifty acres of forest preserve land within such town for public use in providing for the extension of the runway and landing strip of the Piseco airport and providing for the maintenance of a clear zone around such runway, and in exchange therefor, the town of Arietta shall convey to the state fifty- three acres of true forest land located in lot 2 township 2 Totten and Crossfield's Purchase in the town of Lake Pleasant.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions and subject to legislative approval prior to actual transfer of title, because there is no viable alternative to using forest preserve lands for the siting of drinking water wells and necessary appurtenances and because such wells are necessary to meet drinking water quality standards, the state may convey to the town of Long Lake, Hamilton county, one acre of forest preserve land within such town for public use as the site of such drinking water wells and necessary appurtenances for the municipal water supply for the hamlet of Raquette Lake. In exchange therefor, the town of Long Lake shall convey to the state at least twelve acres of land located in Hamilton county for incorporation into the forest preserve that the legislature shall determine is at least equal in value to the land to be conveyed by the state.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the legislature may author- ize the settlement, according to terms determined by the legislature, of title disputes in township forty, Totten and Crossfield purchase in the town of Long Lake, Hamilton county, to resolve longstanding and compet- ing claims of title between the state and private parties in said town- ship, provided that prior to, and as a condition of such settlement, land purchased without the use of state-appropriated funds, and suitable for incorporation in the forest preserve within the Adirondack park, shall be conveyed to the state on the condition that the legislature S. 5540 4 shall determine that the property to be conveyed to the state shall provide a net benefit to the forest preserve as compared to the township forty lands subject to such settlement. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the state may authorize NYCO Minerals, Inc. to engage in mineral sampling operations, solely at its expense, to determine the quantity and quality of wollastonite on approximately 200 acres of forest preserve land contained in lot 8, Stowers survey, town of Lewis, Essex county provided that NYCO Minerals, Inc. shall provide the data and information derived from such drilling to the state for appraisal purposes. Subject to legislative approval of the tracts to be exchanged prior to the actual transfer of title, the state may subsequently convey said lot 8 to NYCO Minerals, Inc., and, in exchange therefor, NYCO Minerals, Inc. shall convey to the state for incorporation into the forest preserve not less than the same number of acres of land, on condition that the legislature shall determine that the lands to be received by the state are equal to or greater than the value of the land to be conveyed by the state and on condition that the assessed value of the land to be conveyed to the state shall total not less than one million dollars. When NYCO Minerals, Inc. terminates all mining operations on such lot 8 it shall remediate the site and convey title to such lot back to the state of New York for inclusion in the forest preserve. In the event that lot 8 is not conveyed to NYCO Minerals, Inc. pursuant to this paragraph, NYCO Minerals, Inc. never- theless shall convey to the state for incorporation into the forest preserve not less than the same number of acres of land that is disturbed by any mineral sampling operations conducted on said lot 8 pursuant to this paragraph on condition that the legislature shall determine that the lands to be received by the state are equal to or greater than the value of the lands disturbed by the mineral sampling operations. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions and subject to legislative approval prior to actual transfer of title, a total of no more than two hundred fifty acres of forest preserve land shall be used for the estab- lishment of a health and safety land account. Where no viable alterna- tive exists and other criteria developed by the legislature are satis- fied, a town, village or county may apply, pursuant to a process determined by the legislature, to the health and safety land account for projects limited to: address bridge hazards or safety on county high- ways, and town highways listed on the local highway inventory maintained by the department of transportation, dedicated, and in existence on January first, two thousand fifteen, and annually plowed and regularly maintained; elimination of the hazards of dangerous curves and grades on county highways, and town highways listed on the local highway inventory maintained by the department of transportation, dedicated, and in exist- ence on January first, two thousand fifteen, and annually plowed and regularly maintained; relocation and reconstruction and maintenance of county highways, and town highways listed on the local highway inventory maintained by the department of transportation, dedicated, and in exist- ence on January first, two thousand fifteen and annually plowed and regularly maintained, provided further that no single relocated portion of any such highway shall exceed one mile in length; and water wells and necessary appurtenances when such wells are necessary to meet drinking water quality standards and are located within five hundred thirty feet of state highways, county highways, and town highways listed on the local highway inventory maintained by the department of transportation, dedicated, and in existence on January first, two thousand fifteen, and S. 5540 5 annually plowed and regularly maintained.
