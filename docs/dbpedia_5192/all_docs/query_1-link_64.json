Section NR 154.015 is entitled “Department Review Times”, and it establishes time limits for review and action by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources on three types of air permit applications.\n\n(50) On November 20, 1986, the State of Wisconsin submitted a revision to the Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance program (I/M) portion of its ozone/CO SIP. This was a revised rule Table 1 for NR 485.04, Wisconsin Administrative Code, plus State SIP Revision Certification.\n\n(i) Incorporation by reference.\n\n(A) Wisconsin revised rule NR 485.04, Wisconsin Administrative Code, effective November 1, 1986.\n\n(51) [Reserved]\n\n(52) On December 1, 1987, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) submitted NR 418.06. NR 418.06 is an SO2 rule which is only applicable to the Badger Paper Mills facility, located in the City of Peshtigo, Marinette County, Wisconsin.\n\n(i) Incorporation by reference.\n\n(A) Natural Resources (NR) 418.06, Peshtigo RACT sulfur limitations, as published in the (Wisconsin) Register, October 1987, No. 382 at page 74, effective November 1, 1987.\n\n(53)-(54) [Reserved]\n\n(55) On January 28, 1985, Wisconsin submitted its Rothschild (Marathon County) SO2 plan, which contains emission limits for sources in the City of Rothschild and the Town of Weston, specifically for the Weyerhaeuser Paper Company and the Reed-Lignin Company, respectively. USEPA is approving NR 418.08 because this revision meets the requirements of part D of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7501-7508. The Wisconsin SIP, however, contains additional existing requirements for SO2. Today's action on NR 418.08 has been integrated within Wisconsin's existing SIP regulations, and does not eliminate a source's obligation to comply with all existing SO2 SIP requirements. Specifically, today's action in no way affects the terms and conditions of a Federal Consent Decree entered into by USEPA and the Weyerhaeuser Company located in Rothschild, Wisconsin No. 89-C-0973-C (W.D. Wis., filed November 1, 1989). This Consent Decree resolves USEPA's enforcement action against Weyerhaeuser Company for violations of SIP rule NR 154.12(1) (now recodified as 418.08). In that Decree, Weyerhaeuser committed to comply with NR 154.12(1) by installing a desulfurization scrubber. August 15, 1989, the WDNR issued a construction permit to Weyerhaeuser which limit the combined emissions of Weyerhaeuser's acid plant and desulfurization scrubber to 28 pounds of SO2 per hour. The conditions and terms of this construction permit and of the Consent Decree remain federally enforceable. On May 9, 1987, 18 months past the effective date of USEPA's designation of Marathon County as a primary SO2 non-attainment area (October 9, 1985, (50 FR 41139)), a construction moratorium was imposed in Marathon County under section 110(a)(2)(I) of the Clean Air Act because the county did not have a USEPA approved plan which assured the attainment and maintenance of the SO2 NAAQS. However, USEPA final approval of Rothschild's SO2 SIP will lift the section 110(a)(2)(I) construction ban in Marathon County.\n\n(i) Incorporation by reference.\n\n(A) Wisconsin Administrative Code, Natural Resources 418.08, Rothschild RACT sulfur limitations, as published in the (Wisconsin) Register, September, 1986, number 369, effective October 1, 1986.\n\n(ii) Additional information.\n\n(A) Weyerhaeuser Company, Federal Consent Decree No. 89-C-0973-C (W.D.
