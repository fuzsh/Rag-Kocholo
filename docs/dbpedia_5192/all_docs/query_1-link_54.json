T H E SPEAKER OF T H E HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. Pursuant to the requirements of section 10 of the Federal Reserve Act, as amended, I have the honor to submit the Twenty-sixth Annual Report, prepared by direction of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, covering operations during the calendar year 1939. Yours respectfully, M. S. ECCLES, Chairman. v -finnual Mepott ofo the jSaatd redetal /Qe&etve ok Qovatnotl ob the Sultem SUMMARY AT T H E beginning of 1939 business activity had recovered about half •E*- of the severe decline that had occurred between the middle of 1937 and the summer of 1938. In the early months of 1939 there was a slight recession in industrial output but other types of business activity were for the most part maintained. In the middle of the year an upward movement got under way, which was sharply accelerated in September when war broke out in Europe. In the closing months of the year the current rate of output in terms of quantity of goods and services was higher than at any time in the country's history. With continued growth of population, however, output per capita was no larger than in 1929. Unemployment, while reduced materially from the highest level of the depression, was still in large volume. In the latter part of the year there was an increase in commitments for new industrial plant and particularly for new equipment, which will further increase and improve productive capacity. Building activity increased in 1939 but was still far below the levels of the 1920's. National income and distribution of commodities to consumers also increased in the last few months, and exports were considerably larger. In many lines, however, it appears that production rose more rapidly than consumption, with a consequent increase in inventories in the hands of producers and distributors. Unfilled orders, which had been in unusually large volume after the buying wave in the early autumn, had declined somewhat by the end of the year. During the year recurring war crises in Europe resulted in an increased flow of gold to this country, and at the end of the year our gold stock reached the unprecedented total of $17,650,000,000, representing twothirds of the world's monetary gold. This inflow of gold resulted in a corresponding growth of member bank reserves and deposits, and this, together with some expansion of bank loans and investments, carried bank deposits to new high levels. Required reserves increased correspondingly but this increase fell far short of absorbing the additions to bank reserves, so that excess reserves rose further to a volume in excess of five billion dollars. The principal medium of Federal Reserve policy during the year was open-market operations. In the middle of the year, when rates on Treasury bills were practically on a no-yield basis, the Federal Open Market Committee decided that, whenever market conditions warranted, holdings of Treasury bills wrould be allowed to mature without replacement. 1 2 ANNUAL REPORT OF BOARD OF GOVERNORS In the autumn when hostilities broke out in Europe and United States securities, as well as other high-grade fixed-interest obligations, fell rapidly in price, the System bought Government securities freely with a view to cushioning the decline and exerting an influence against disorganization in the capital market. It was not the System's objective to hold Government security prices at any given level but to prevent them from falling so rapidly as to result in panicky conditions in the market. When the shock of the outbreak of the war had subsided and prices of Government securities, after a substantial recovery, had advanced further, the System sold some securities from its portfolio. As a net result of the year's operations, the System's open-market portfolio at the end of 1939 was $80,000,000 lower than at the beginning of the year. In its annual report for 1938 the Board presented a brief review of the problems of banking and bank supervision with which the country is confronted. No material changes in the situation described in the report occurred during 1939, except a further large expansion of bank reserves. In the summer the United States Senate adopted a resolution introduced by Senator Wagner of New York, reading in part as follows: \"Resolved, That the Committee on Banking and Currency is authorized to conduct a study and to hold hearings to consider and recommend a national monetary and banking policy by which the monetary and banking authorities of the Federal Government shall be guided and governed, and to consider and recommend the character of governmental machinery best calculated to carry out such policy. The Committee shall report to the Senate as soon as practicable the results of its study, together with its recommendation for the enactment of any legislation it may deem necessary.\" FEDERAL RESERVE POLICY An important change in the System's open-market policy during 1939 was the departure from the practice of recent years of maintaining a constant amount of securities in the System account. This change reflected a shift in emphasis in the use of open-market operations from their influence on member bank reserves to their direct influence on conditions in the capital market. As a corollary of this change it was no longer necessary to attach as much importance as previously to having at all times a large amount of securities of short maturity. Since the autumn of 1933 the System's open-market portfolio had been approximately $2,500,000,000. No net changes in the portfolio had occurred, except for relatively minor purchases in Flexible the spring of 1937 for the purpose of attempting to portfolio1* preserve orderly market conditions and in the autumn of that year for the purpose of providing funds to meet seasonal requirements. Maintenance of a constant portfolio had reflected 3 FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM the judgment of the Federal Open Market Committee that, so long as business recovery was incomplete and there was no evidence of overexpansion of credit, there wTas no occasion for a reduction in the System's open-market holdings. On the other hand, there was no occasion to increase the portfolio materially so long as excess reserves were abundant and growing, bank deposits were in unusually large volume, and interest rates were lowr. In 1939, however, developments in the market caused the System to depart from the practice of maintaining a constant portfolio. These developments were, first, the difficulty of replacing maturing Treasury bills without paying a premium over a no-yield basis, and, later, the sharp decline in United States Government security prices at the outbreak of the war in Europe. As early as the last quarter of 1938, the diminution in the supply of Treasury bills in the face of a growing demand had resulted in a decline in the rate on weekly bill issues almost to zero, and on Liquidation of some occasions bills were not obtainable except at a lreasury bills x # premium above a no-yield basis. This matter was discussed by the Federal Open Market Committee as early as December 1938, and the following statement was released to the press on December 30: \"The Federal Open Market Committee announced, following a meeting today, that weekly statements of the total holdings in the Federal Reserve System's Open Market Account may at times show some fluctuation depending upon conditions in the market affecting the Committee's ability to replace maturing Treasury bills held in its portfolio. The volume of Treasury bills available on the market has declined materially during the year and, owing to the large and increasing demand, such bills are already selling either on a no-yield basis or at a premium above a no-yield basis. It has, therefore, become difficult and in some weeks impossible for the System to find sufficient bills on the market to replace those that mature. Shortterm notes are also selling on a no-yield basis and longer-term notes have at times been difficult to obtain. In these circumstances, it may be necessary from time to time to permit bills held in the portfolio to mature without replacement, not because of any change in Federal Reserve policy but solely because of the technical situation in the market. Because no change in Federal Reserve policy is contemplated at this time, maturing bills will be replaced to the extent that market conditions warrant.\" For nearly six months after this announcement it was found possible to replace maturing bills each week with other bills or with short-term Treasury notes without paying a premium above a no-yield basis or with 4 ANNUAL REPORT OF BOARD OF GOVERNORS longer-term Treasury notes without causing undue disturbance in the market for such notes. The difficulty of replacing bills, however, became continuously more pronounced. On June 21, the Open Market Committee considered the matter again and decided that no useful purpose would be served by continuing to replace maturing bills for which there was a strong demand in the market and that, therefore, the System's holdings of bills should be allowed to run off without replacement unless market conditions made this undesirable for any given week. On June 30 the following statement was issued: \"As a result of a reduction in holdings of Treasury bills, this week's statement of condition of Federal Reserve banks shows a decline of $13,378,000 in the System Open Market Account. This is in accordance with action taken by the Federal Open Market Committee on June 21, 1939. For some time past, Treasury bills have been purchased for the System's account at or near a no-yield basis and the account at times has had difficulty in replacing its maturing bills. I t was decided that it would serve no useful purpose to continue full replacement of maturing bills, the supply of which is not always equal to the market demand. This action is in response to technical conditions in the bill market and does not represent a change in general credit policy.\" In the course of 24 weeks the total of Treasury bills held on June 21 amounting to $477,000,000 was liquidated, and since December 6 no Treasury bills have been held in the System's open-market account. While the gradual liquidation of the System's Treasury bills was in process, world events precipitated conditions in the bond market which caused the System to make purchases of other United Open-market States obligations on a substantial scale. As early as outbre*akSoTwar ^ s meeting on April 19 the Federal Open Market Committee had taken cognizance of the possibility of serious disturbances in the Government security market in the event of an armed conflict in Europe. At that meeting the committee gave authority to its executive committee to arrange for large-scale purchases of United States Government securities in case war should break out and result in serious disturbances in the capital market in the United States. This authority was renewed on June 21 at the last meeting of the committee before the outbreak of the war. On September 1, when war in Europe actually began, prices of United States Government and high-grade corporate bonds declined abruptly. Prices of Government bonds had advanced almost continuously from September 1937 to June 1939 and were at that time at the highest level on record, with the average yield on long-term Treasury bonds at 21/4: per cent. Even prior to the actual outbreak of hostilities high-grade FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM D bond prices had declined somewhat as the result of uncertainties in the world outlook, but early in September the break in the bond market became more pronounced. In the circumstances, the Federal Reserve System deemed it to be in the public interest to exert its influence in a positive way toward maintaining orderly conditions in the market for United States Government securities. While the System has neither the obligation nor the power to assure any given level of prices or yields for Government securities, it has been its policy in so far as its powers permit to protect the market for these securities from violent fluctuations of a speculative, or panicky nature. Prices of fixed-interest rate securities, including those of the Government, inevitably adjust to changes in long-time interest rates. Consequently, an orderly rise or fall in United States bond prices in response to changes in underlying credit conditions, as expressed in interest rates, does not call for action by the System. Violent temporary movements, however, caused by such circumstances as the shock of the outbreak of European hostilities, make it in the public interest for the System to use its influence toward preventing a disorganized condition in the market. In undertaking large-scale open-market operations in September 1939, the System was guided principally by the following considerations: (1) By helping to maintain orderly conditions in the market for United States Government securities the System can exert a steadying influence on the entire capital market, which is an essential part of the country's economic machinery, and disorganization in which would be a serious obstacle to the progress of economic recovery. The market for United States Government securities is the only part of the capital market in which the System is authorized by law to operate, and Government securities occupy a vital place in that market. (2) The System also has a measure of responsibility for safeguarding the large United States Government portfolio of the member banks from unnecessarily wide and violent fluctuations in price. The System cannot and does not guarantee any current prices of Government obligations, nor does it undertake to preserve for member banks such profits as they may have on their Government securities, or to protect them against losses in this account. The Government security market, however, has become in recent years the principal part of the money market, and member banks are in the habit of adjusting their cash positions through sales and purchases of United States Government securities. This practice has arisen partly because of a shrinkage in the availability of other liquid assets, such as Street loans and bankers' acceptances, which in earlier years were in much larger volume and were the medium through which banks were likely to adjust their positions. In the enhanced importance of the Government portfolio to member banks, the System sees 6 ANNUAL REPORT OF BOARD OF GOVERNORS an additional reason for exerting its influence against undue disturbances in Government security prices. On September 1 the System announced that all the Federal Reserve banks stood ready to make advances on Government securities to member and nonmember banks at par and at the discount rate. The discount rate at the time was 1 per cent in New York and 1% per cent at the other Reserve banks. During September the rate for such advances was reduced to 1 per cent at six Federal Reserve banks. The purpose of the announcement and of the reduction in the discount rates was to assure all banks, as large holders of Government obligations, that a temporary decline in prices of Government securities should not be regarded as an occasion for selling these securities, as, in case of need, these holdings could be the basis for obtaining their par value in cash at the Federal Reserve banks. A more tangible expression of System policy, however, was the active intervention of the Federal Reserve banks, at the direction of the Federal Open Market Committee, in the market for Government securities. In the early part of September the System made substantial purchases with a view to preventing the development of disorderly conditions or unreasonably abrupt declines in prices. Offerings were increasing and there was a scarcity of buyers. Consequently, prices were falling rapidly. A few purchases of United States Government securities were made in the closing days of August. On September 17 when war actually broke out and long-term Government bonds declined by a full point, the System purchased more than $100,000,000 of Government securities. This amount included $61,000,000 purchased from dealers in order to prevent these holdings from hanging over the market, or from demoralizing the market further if the dealers attempted to liquidate them at once. The understanding with dealers during this period was that they were expected to act in effect as brokers only and were not to take positions on either the long or the short side of the market. For a brief period from September 1 to September 6 dealers were also requested, when offering securities to the Federal Reserve banks, to give the names of the sellers of the securities. This plan was adopted as a means of detecting possible speculative short sales and in general as a method of having better knowledge of developments in the market. The policy of requiring the names of sellers was discontinued as soon as market conditions justified its abandonment. As a further precaution it was agreed that dealers would stop trading in United States Government obligations at 4 o'clock in the afternoon. During the period in September when the Federal Reserve banks were making purchases in the open market, many banks cooperated with the System's program by refraining from making sales from their portfolios of United States Government securities. 7 FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM The aggregate amount of securities purchased by the System from August 28, when the purchases began, to September 25, when they terminated, was $473,000,000. Toward the end of September prices of Government and high-grade corporate obligations steadied and shortly thereafter began to advance. By the end of the year their level had advanced to Recovery of ^ n a ^ prevailing prior to the outbreak of the war in J b o n d prices ^ • Europe. Advances m Government security prices during the last three months of the year were at times so rapid that it was thought advisable to sell some of the System's holdings, particularly of issues for which there was a strong market demand. In the course of these months a total of $77,000,000 was sold. As a net result of the year's open-market operations, the System's portfolio at the end of December was about $80,000,000 smaller than a year earlier. Two charts are presented in this connection. The first chart shows for the last five months of 1939 daily changes in the price of a representative long-term Treasury bond (2% per cent bonds of 1960-65) and daily purchases or sales of securities by the Federal Reserve System. The chart shows that over a period of a few weeks a sharp drop in the OPEN-MARKET OPERATIONS AND TREASURY BOND PRICES AUGUST-DECEMBER, 1939 112 *RS DOLLARS 112 108 108 ^TREASURY BOND PRICES 104 100 100 96 96 92 92 MILLIONS OF DOLLARS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS 100 FEDERAL RESERVE PURCHASES SO K 50 J I FEDERAL RESERVE SALES 50 50 AUGUST SEPTEMBER OCTOBER NOVEMBER DECEMBER Prices of Treasury bonds of 1960-1965.

It is apparent from the chart that open-market operations by the Reserve System were so timed as to moderate the more extreme daily movements of bond prices but not so as to prevent the market from following over the period the general pattern of decline and recovery.

FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 9 of member banks, and bank deposits and currency outside of banks. The extraordinary inflow of gold has been the principal factor in the growth of excess reserves and of bank deposits in recent years with a consequent large volume of funds seeking investment. As a result, interest rates have declined to record low levels, as is indicated by the course of Government bond yields on the chart. The sudden sharp rise in these yields in the autumn of 1939, without a change in the deposit and reserve position of banks or a substantial increase in credit demands by commerce and industry, was a temporary development rather than a reflection of a change in underlying credit conditions. Adoption by the System in 1939 of a flexible portfolio in place of the fixed portfolio held for the preceding six years was in response to monetary conditions that had developed over the past few Significance of years. In earlier years changes in the System portflexible portfolio folio had been made with reference to their effect on member bank indebtedness or the volume of excess reserves. With bank reserves at an unprecedented and constantly mounting level, and with a vast amount of funds in the hands of individual and institutional investors seeking outlets, such changes in member bank reserves as are caused by System open-market operations are no longer a major factor in easing or tightening credit conditions. On the other hand, such operations exert an influence on conditions in the capital market. The entry or withdrawal of the System as an active buyer or seller has an influence not only on prices of the particular issues that the System buys or sells, but also on the market for Government obligations as a whole and to some extent on the capital market in general. In view of the fact that member banks hold a large volume of Government and corporate bonds, the endeavors of the System to contribute to the maintenance of an orderly bond market tend to stabilize banking conditions and, through their effect on the capital markets, they contribute to general economic recovery. The change in the immediate objective of open-market operations has had the incidental effect of making it less important for the Federal Reserve System to have its portfolio of United States Change in Government securities consist in large part of shortmaturity distribution term obligations. The chart following shows the extent of the decrease in the last six months of 1939 in the System's holdings of obligations maturing in a year or less and the increase in obligations maturing in more than five years. At the end of the year about one-tenth of the System's portfolio had a maturity of one year or less, compared with one-third at the end of 1938. When open-market sales and purchases by the System were primarily forFRASER the purpose of affecting the volume of member bank reserves, it was Digitized for 10 ANNUAL REPORT OF BOARD OF GOVERNORS considered important to hold a large amount of securities that would mature in a short time or could be sold without sustaining losses or causing a disturbance in the market. With the shift in emphasis in openmarket operations from their effect on member bank reserves to their effect in contributing to orderly conditions in the market for United States Government obligations, it has become less important for the UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS HELD BY FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS 3 1936 BILLIONS OF DOLLARS 3 1937 1938 1939 System to have a large proportion of its portfolio in short-term obligations. The change in the distribution of maturities in the portfolio during the year was consistent with this viewpoint. UNITED STATES ACQUISITIONS OF FOREIGN GOLD Gold movements to this country in recent years have been influenced to an increasing extent by apprehensions of war and by actual hostilities. In the last year and a half the movement of capital to the United States has been almost entirely determined by the war situation, which has also been a powerful influence on American exports. FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 11 The war flight of capital to the United States assumed large dimensions in September 1938 with the events leading up to the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia. During the year ending Tapital inflow August 1939, according to the reported figures, $1,800,000,000 of capital came to the United States from abroad, a larger sum than in any other period of equal length. Roughly half the total inflow occurred during the twelve weeks of severest crisis— four in September 1938 on the occasion of the first Czech crisis, five in March and April 1939 following the German absorption of Bohemia and Moravia, and three in August, immediately preceding the outbreak of war. The bulk of the capital inflow represented private money seeking refuge in the United States, most of which was placed on deposit, but foreign central banks and governments also participated in the movement. In the year ending August 1939 official balances held with the Reserve banks and certain other institutions rose by $260,000,000. The increase would no doubt have been much larger were it not for the fact that foreign central banks are permitted to hold gold in this country, a facility denied to private persons. Gold earmarked for foreign account increased $700,000,000 in the year ending August 1939, bringing the total accumulation of foreign official resources in the United States during the period to approximately $1,000,000,000. A second important factor in the gold flow to the United States in the prewar period was the excess of merchandise exports. The sudden emergence of a large export surplus in the latter part P ewa m r u .? £ i of 1937 was due less to war influences than to the chandise balance coincidence of diminishing business activity in the United States with increased agricultural output after a year of short crops occasioned by drought. Imports of industrial goods declined and certain agricultural commodities shifted from an import to an export basis. But in addition to these domestic developments there was also a strong foreign demand for American manufactures. Military expenditures abroad contributed to this demand, partly through enlarging the flow of goods and materials needed directly for armament and partly through intensifying the whole range of foreign business activity. The growth in exports of American manufactures was the chief factor in maintaining the export surplus of this country at an unusually high level even after the domestic conditions which had played a large part in creating the surplus in 1937 had disappeared. In the middle of 1938 business began to recover and in the ensuingyear there was a renewed expansion of raw material imports, while exports of agricultural products, reflecting chiefly a decline in cotton exports, receded to an unusually low level; but owing to larger shipments of manufactured goods the excess of exports was maintained 12 ANNUAL REPORT OF BOARD OF GOVERNORS during the year ending August 1939 at $800,000,000, compared with $1,100,000,000 in the previous twelve months. Acquisitions of foreign gold by the United States during the year ending August 1939 reached the unprecedented total of $3,400,000,000. Most of this gold, as already indicated, was received m connec on acquStfons ^ with the reported inflow of capital and the excess of exports, but a substantial portion represents transactions which have not been identified. It seems probable, however, that many of these transactions constituted capital transfers hidden for the purpose of evading exchange restrictions abroad and particularly the compulsory relinquishment of foreign assets to the governments. With the outbreak of war and the imposition of war controls the recorded inflow of capital came to a halt, but the merchandise export surplus and credits due to unidentified transactions rose to of^a^ 10111118 £ r e a t e r volume. This country continued to acquire gold from abroad on nearly the same scale as before. Gold acquisitions in the first four months of the war averaged $55,000,000 a week, compared with $65,000,000 a week in the record year that preceded the declaration of war. The cessation of the recorded capital inflow that occurred following the commencement of hostilities in Europe reflected two offsetting movements. Capital continued to arrive from the neutral countries of Europe at fully as great a rate as before the war, but the inflow from England, France, and Canada came to an end and was succeeded by a release of funds for account of these countries which offset the continuing receipts from other areas. The belligerent countries, with the exception of Germany, which had taken such steps some years before, imposed foreign exchange restrictions immediately after the outbreak of war. For the most part these restrictions were designed to prevent the further transfer of capital abroad. In England, moreover, the public was required to offer short-term assets denominated in dollars and other leading currencies to the Treasury, which was also authorized to requisition stocks and bonds. Compulsory sale of foreign assets was not decreed in France, but measures designed to encourage capital repatriation were taken. In the four war months of 1939 nationals of England, France, and Canada reduced their holdings of short-term balances in the United States by about $300,000,000 and sold more than $100,000,000 of American securities. Some of the proceeds of this liquidation went into official deposits in this country, and there was some further return of United States capital so that the net capital outflow to these countries was about $300,000,000. The net inflow from the rest of the world was of approximately equal magnitude. The effect of the war on American foreign trade was equally prompt though less spectacular. Exports from the United States increased sharply FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 13 in September and October and, after a setback in November, rose further in December. The rise was partly seasonal, but it carried the figures well above those of a year previous. By far the largest increase as compared with 1938 occurred in exports of raw cotton, which had been unusually small the year before. Iron and steel manufactures, aircraft, petroleum products, industrial machinery, coal, industrial chemicals, and copper also showed large advances. Except for cotton, agricultural exports showed few increases, and shipments of tobacco fell off sharply. Imports also increased under the stimulus of rapidly expanding business activity, but not to the same extent as exports. The export surplus increased substantially during the last four months of 1939. At $400,000,000 it was the principal known factor bringing gold to the United States. Transactions whose nature could not be determined precisely from available figures, but which probably in large part represented some form of capital movement, also continued to be important. From the outbreak of war to the end of the year the United States acquired nearly $1,000,000,000 of foreign gold. In the year and a half in which the war influence was predominant the United States acquired $4,500,000,000 of gold, an amount larger than the dollar value of the entire gold stock of this country at the end of 1933. The gold stock at the end of 1939 was $17,650,000,000; and it was increasing at the rate of about $2,500,000,000 a year. BANKING DEVELOPMENTS Bank reserves and bank deposits increased further during 1939 to the highest level on record. The principal factor in the increase was the inflow of gold from abroad but deposits were expanded also by an increase in bank holdings of United States Government obligations. The growth of deposits during the year was larger than the rise in economic activity with the consequence that the turnover of deposits declined further. Total reserves of member banks rose by $3,000,000,000 in 1939, following a rise of $2,000,000,000 in 1938; over the two-year period the amount of reserves held by banks in excess of legal ^nd\"dtehositseSerVeS r e < l u i r e m e n t s increased from about $1,000,000,000 to eposi s $5?5oo?000,000, the highest on record. At the a b ^ end of 1939, therefore, nearly half of the $12,000,000,000 of reserves held by member banks were excess reserves. Rapid expansion of bank reserves in recent years has been due chiefly to the acquisition of foreign gold, discussed in the preceding section of this report. Gold imports, together with the increase in bank loans and investments, have also added to our already swollen volume of bank deposits. Although recent increases in bank deposits have been widespread, with substantial percentage increases in some of the Southern and far Western States, the largest growth has been at banks in New York City. These banks are the chief holders of balances of large institutional and indi- 14 ANNUAL REPORT OF BOARD OF GOVERNORS vidual investors and receive most of the deposits of funds representing the capital inflow from abroad, which was mainly responsible for our gold imports and deposit growth in 1939. Banks were purchasers of United States Government securities on a large scale in 1939 and their combined holdings of direct and guaranteed obligations rose above the previous peak reached in Increase in 1936. Changes in bank holdings of Government oblisecu^m^esf11 gations in recent years have been chiefly at city banks. In 1939 the increase was mainly at member banks in New York City, and in 1938 it was mainly at member banks in other leading cities. As shown by the chart, United States Government securities held by banks in New York and 100 other leading cities increased by $1,900,000,000 from June 1938 to the end of 1939; this compares with an estimated increase of $2,100,000,000 at all commercial banks.

The chart also shows that city banks experienced a livelier demand for loans from commercial and industrial borrowers in the latter half of 1939, when a sharp increase m business activity commercial loans brought a growing need for funds to finance the current expansion of business operations, including the acquisition of enlarged inventories. In this period commercial loans at FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 15 banks in 101 leading cities rose by nearly $600,000,000, or 13 per cent. About half of this increase was at New York City banks. Taking the year as a whole, commercial loans increased at city banks in each Federal Reserve district, except the San Francisco district. Outside the leading cities there were moderate but widespread increases in commercial and industrial loans and in real estate loans. During 1939, as during the previous year, there was a decline in the number of operating banks which was offset only in part by an increase ™ . in the number of branches. As a result the number Changes in banking structure of offices at which banking business is conducted declined during the year, continuing the trend of the four previous years. The proportion of branches to total banking offices again increased but at a slower rate than in most earlier years. Details of these changes may be found in tables 15 and 16 on pages 53-54 of this report. There was a net decrease of 160 operating banks during the year, reflecting principally 122 consolidations, absorptions, and mergers. There were 41 voluntary liquidations and 42 bank suspensions. Thirty new banks were organized and 15 were added to the records as a result of revisions. The number of Federal Reserve member banks increased during the year, while the number of insured nonmember banks and of noninsured banks continued to decline. The increase in Federal Reserve membership was due mainly to the admission of 85 nonmember State banks. During 1939 the number of branch offices of banks showed a net increase of 49, slightly more than in 1938, but increases in each of these years are much less than those of the previous four years. The net increase in 1939 was wholly accounted for by branches located outside the head-office city; the number of head-office city branches has remained almost unchanged for several years. BUSINESS CONDITIONS By the end of 1939 business activity was at a much higher level than at the beginning of the year. A considerable part of the rise was due to the influence of war conditions abroad, which in early autumn stimulated a general wave of buying and greatly accelerated the rise in production already under way. The increase in production extended quite generally throughout industry and led to large increases in payrolls and many other types of income payments. Cash farm income from marketings rose more than seasonally in the autumn and for the year was about the same as in 1938, while Government payments to farmers were larger. Distribution of commodities to individual consumers in turn increased and this rise, together with larger orders for capital goods, particularly equipment, took a large part of the expanded output off the market; also, 16 ANNUAL REPORT OF BOARD OF GOVERNORS exports of industrial products expanded. Part of the increased output, however, went into inventories and in some lines, as production toward the end of the year reached levels clearly in excess of current consumption, new orders fell to a level below current output and unfilled orders wTere being reduced from earlier peak levels. Such developments indicated that in these industries a decline in activity was to be expected during the early part of 1940. In some other lines, however, it appeared that new orders were continuing at relatively high levels and that the volume of unfilled orders on hand at the end of the year was sufficient to maintain activity at high levels for a considerable period. The extent of any decrease in output as a whole appeared to depend on whether the decline would prove cumulative or whether it would be stopped by new demands forthcoming from domestic sources or from abroad.

Income payments and industrial production are adjusted for seasonal variation. FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 17 The course of industrial production, as measured by the Board's seasonally adjusted index, is shown for 1939 and other recent years on the accompanying chart. During the first half of 1939 Developments there was some decline, reflecting in large part reducoutbreak of war tions in activity in the steel and automobile industries and a protracted shutdown at bituminous coal mines pending settlement of contract negotiations between mine operators and the miners' union. In most important steel-consuming lines, with the exception of the automobile industry, activity was maintained during this period or increased further; the decline in steel production was due largely to the fact that in the latter part of 1938 steel production had been in excess of consumption and there had been some accumulation of inventories at steel-consuming establishments. Production of textiles, shoes, and certain other nondurable goods showed some reduction from the levels reached at the end of 1938. In the construction industry activity during the first half of 1939 was maintained near the highest level in recent years owing to a large volume of public work and to a substantial amount of private residential building. Total income payments, which include many items not affected directly or immediately by changes in industrial activity, did not decline and distribution of commodities to consumers showed about the usual seasonal fluctuations until May when there was a moderate decline. In June industrial output began an advance, which continued through the summer. Steel production increased and coal production rose considerably, following reopening of mines in the latter half of May. There was an increase in automobile production schedules during the remainder of the model year, made possible by an improvement in retail sales of new and used cars. Activity in the machinery and other steel-consuming industries rose further. There were increases also in output of textiles and other nondurable goods. On the railroads, where shipments had decreased considerably during the shutdown of coal mines, loadings were in larger volume during the summer. In August retail trade advanced to the level prevailing in the first part of the year. Throughout the first eight months of 1939 manufacturers and distributors had followed a policy of inventory reduction so that by the beginning of September their stocks of industrial materials and products were generally in smaller volume than earlier in the year and in some instances were at low levels. Stocks of agricultural products, however, particularly cotton and wheat, were large. Commodity prices as a whole declined somewhat in the period, reflecting reductions in prices of farm products, particularly livestock; prices of industrial products showed little change. Common stock prices at the end of August were generally somewhat lower than at the begin 18 ANNUAL REPORT OF BOARD OF GOVERNORS ning of the year, although during the summer they had advanced from the lower levels reached in the spring during the period of unusual international tension. When war broke out in Europe at the beginning of September industrial activity had already increased to about the level reached at the close of 1938 and a further increase was anticipated Developments in many quarters. The outbreak of war greatly acsubsequent to the outbreak of war n , i xl •, T v x i ex. celerated the advance. Immediately a wave ol buying developed, extending beyond the commodities and securities markets to industrial materials and products not traded in on organized exchanges, such as steel and textiles, and, for a short time, even to some retail markets. For the most part the buying was from domestic sources, although foreign demand also increased. Prices of basic commodities and of many equity securities rose sharply in this period, while bond prices declined. The buying wave that occurred at the outset soon subsided but purchasing of some materials continued in considerable volume and was supplemented by a large volume of orders for finished products, such as machine tools and other machinery and railway equipment. By the end of October producers in some lines had sufficient orders on their books for capacity or near-capacity production throughout the remainder of the year and in certain instances well into the first quarter of 1940. Commodity prices generally showed little change after the sharp advances of the first few weeks in September. Prices of semi-finished and finished steel for delivery in the first quarter of 1940 were reaffirmed in November, and in December prices of grains, cotton, and silk rose substantially, while there were declines in prices of steel scrap and some nonferrous metals. Commodity prices at the end of 1939 were generally somewhat higher than a year earlier but considerably below the levels reached in 1937 at the culmination of the previous recovery in business. Prices of common stocks, particularly those that earlier had risen sharply, declined after the middle of October. At the year end stock prices were generally about the same as a year earlier. In a few lines, however, notably the public utility and aircraft industries and some companies producing nondurable goods, especially textiles and foods, prices were above the level prevailing at the end of 1938. Industrial output rose sharply in September and October and in the remaining months of the year continued at a high rate, near capacity levels in a number of industries. There were also considerable increases in employment, in total income payments, and in distribution of commodities to consumers. Expenditures on publicly-financed construction, other than works projects, continued at the high level reached in the summer, but the volume of public construction undertaken declined toward the end of the year and was considerably below that of a year 19 FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM earlier when a new Public Works Administration program was initiated. Private residential building continued at the highest level in recent years. Other private work was at a level somewhat greater than during the summer but still considerably below the levels reached in 1937.

S. Government securities. 2 Principally charge-offs on bank premises and reserves for losses, and in 1938 contributions to retirement system for prior service. Since nearly all member banks have reserves substantially in excess of requirements, they have had little occasion to borrow from their Federal Reserve banks. As a result, earnings on discounts for and advances to member banks amounted to only $61,000 in 1939. Earnings on industrial advances and commitments made under section 13b of the Federal Reserve Act, which authorizes the Federal Reserve banks, under certain conditions and limitations, to make industrial advances to established commercial and industrial enterprises either direct or in participation with financing institutions and to enter into commitments to make such advances, aggregated $744,000. Expenses connected with industrial 20 ANNUAL REPORT OF BOARD OF GOVERNORS advances and commitments amounted to $424,000 and in addition provision was made in 1939 for estimated losses on such advances in the amount of $739,000. Net operating expenses of the Federal Reserve banks, which consisted of total operating expenses after deducting reimbursements of $4,939,000 received from the United States Treasury and other Government agencies for fiscal agency, depositary and custodianship work, were slightly larger in 1939 than in 1938, but decreases in the assessments for expenses of the Board of Governors and in the cost of Federal Reserve currency resulted in a slightly smaller total of current expenses as compared with 1938. Principal items of expenses were salaries and contributions to the Retirement System, $20,663,000, postage and expressage, $3,356,000, taxes and normal depreciation allowances on bank premises, $2,717,000, and printing, stationery and supplies, $783,000. As shown in the foregoing table current net earnings of the Federal Reserve banks amounted to $9,854,000 in 1939. After adding to this amount $4,391,000 net profits on sales of United States Government securities and other credits to profit and loss aggregating $423,000 and deducting $1,417,000 for special depreciation allowances and charge-offs on bank premises, $739,000 for losses and reserves for estimated losses on industrial advances, and other charges to profit and loss aggregating $269,000, there remained net earnings of $12,243,000, as compared with $9,582,000 in 1938. Federal Reserve banks paid dividends to member banks aggregating $8,110,000 at the rate of 6 per cent per annum on paid-in capital, as provided in the Federal Reserve Act. Payments to the United States Treasury under provisions of section 13b of the Federal Reserve Act, relating to industrial advances, amounted to $25,000. These payments are made in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Reserve Act wliich require the Federal Reserve banks to pay to the Secretary of the Treasury 2 per cent, if earned, on the amounts paid to the Federal Reserve banks by the Secretary of the Treasury for the purpose of making industrial advances. The remaining net earnings of the Federal Reserve banks, transferred to surplus, amounted to $4,108,000, as compared with $1,443,000 in 1938. Itemized earnings and expenses in 1939 and distribution of net earnings for each Federal Reserve bank are shown in Table 5 on pages 40-41. Total earnings on bills and securities were $2,177,000 more in 1939 than in 1938. The increase in earnings was the result of an increase of $20,000,000 in daily average holdings of United States Government securities and an increase from 1.34 per cent to 1.43 per cent in the average rate of earnings thereon. The increase in the rate of earnings was due to the replacement of maturing bills with bonds and notes. Average daily holdings of bills and securities, together with average rates and 21 FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM amounts of earnings thereon, during the last four years are shown in the following table: EARNINGS ON BILLS AND SECURITIES [Amounts in thousands of dollars] Total Daily average holdings: 1936 1937 1938 1939 Earnings: 1936 1937 1938 1939 Average rate of earnings (per cent): 1936 1937 1938 1939 Bills discounted m United States Government Bills Industrial securities, bought in advances open market direct and guaranteed 2,469,688 2,542,545 2,590,597 2,602,590 6,135 13,749 8,739 5,103 3,725 3,390 543 440 2,430,657 2,503,865 2,564,877 2,584,268 29,171 21,541 16,438 12,779 36,909 40,352 35,404 37,581 108 212 124 61 30 24 3 2 35,184 39,025 34,446 36,903 1,587 1,091 831 615 1.49 1.59 1.37 1.44 1.76 1.54 1.42 1.20 .81 .71 .48 .45 1.45 1.56 1.34 1.43 5.44 5.06 5.05 4.81 The number of banks on the Federal Reserve par list at the end of 1939 was 11,758, comprising all of the 6,362 member banks and 5,396 nonmember banks. The number of nonmember banks Interdistnct (other than mutual savings banks and banks on which collection system ° no checks are drawn) not on the par list was 2,719. Banks on the par list pay without deduction of exchange charges such checks drawn upon them as are forwarded for payment by the Federal Reserve banks. Changes in the number of par and nonpar banks during 1939 reflect principally changes in the banking structure. 1 During the year there was a net reduction of 3 in the number of nonpar banks, due to 44 such banks terminating their existence and 16 becoming par banks, offset by 21 new banks opening as nonpar banks and 36 par banks assuming a nonpar status. As these figures show, more of the banks which were in existence throughout the year withdrew from the par list than were added to it. The number of banks on the par list declined 185 during the year, as a result of mergers, voluntary liquidations, suspensions, and withdrawals from the par list. Of the gross addition of 57 to the number of nonpar banks, 20 were in the Atlanta and 15 in the St. Louis Federal Reserve districts. The net increase in the number of nonpar banks in the Atlanta district was 9 and in the St. Louis district 5. The distribution of the number of nonpar banks by States at the end of the year was as follows: Minnesota 411, Georgia 260, Mississippi 175, Tennessee 171, Nebraska 161, Wisconsin 158, Arkansas 132, Alabama 130, North Carolina 126, South Carolina 120, North Dakota 117, Iowa 110, Missouri 106, Louisiana 104, 1 See page 15 and table 17, page 55. 22 ANNUAL REPORT OF BOARD OF GOVERNORS Texas 102, South Dakota 93, Florida 87, Virginia 43, and twelve other States 113. The credit to the National Bank of Hungary, granted by the Federal Reserve banks in 1931, was reduced during 1939 in accordance with the terms of the renewal agreement of 1937 (Annual ReCr ntrllbanks e i g n P °rt f °r 193? > P ' 3 5 ^ 0 n D e C e m b e r 31 > 1939 > t h e share of the Federal Reserve banks in the outstanding amount of the credit was $1,830,000, as compared with $2,055,000 at the end of 1938. With authorization of the Board of Governors, four loans secured by gold earmarked at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York were granted by that and other Federal Reserve banks to a foreign central bank in June, September, November, and December. The first loan, which had been renewed once, and the second loan matured in December, when they were replaced by a fourth loan in the form of a credit for a larger amount, to be made available as required. Repayment in full of this credit is due not later than June 15, 1940. The third loan, which was not covered by the fourth, was repayable in February 1940. Amounts outstanding on December 31, 1939, under the third and fourth loans totaled $5,020,000. LEGISLATION RELATING TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM Renewal of Loans to Executive Officers of Member Banks.—By an Act of Congress approved June 20, 1939, section 22(g) of the Federal Reserve Act was amended so as to permit loans made to an executive officer of a member bank prior to June 16, 1933, to be renewed or extended, subject to the other provisions of the law, for periods expiring not later than June 16, 1944. (The law had previously limited such renewals or extensions to June 16, 1939.) Repeal of Compulsory Federal Reserve Membership of Insured State Banks.—The Act of June 20, 1939, which amended section 22(g) of the Federal Reserve Act as indicated above, also repealed section 12B(y) (1) of the Federal Reserve Act which had required that after July 1, 1942, each State bank with average deposits of $1,000,000 or more must be a member of the Federal Reserve System in order to have its deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under section 12B of the Federal Reserve Act. Government Obligations as Collateral for Federal Reserve Notes.—By an Act of Congress approved June 30, 1939, the second paragraph of section 16 of the Federal Reserve Act was amended so that the authority of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to permit direct obligations of the United States to be used as collateral for Federal Reserve notes was extended from June 30, 1939, until June 30, 1941. Existing Interlocking Bank Directorates.—A bill, S. 2150, to amend the second paragraph of section 8 of the Clayton Act so as to extend FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 23 from February 1, 1939, to February 1, 1944, the period during which certain interlocking relationships lawfully existing on the date of the Banking Act of 1935 might continue was vetoed by the President of the United States on August 5, 1939. CHANGES IN REGULATIONS OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS The regulations of the Board of Governors were changed during the year 1939 in the following respects: Rediscount of Notes Secured by Adjusted Service Certificates.—On April 6, 1939, the Board of Governors repealed its Regulation G, series of 1932, relating to the rediscount by Federal Reserve banks of notes secured by adjusted service certificates. No notes covered by the regulation had been discounted with the Federal Reserve banks in several years, and the Board announced that if any applications for the rediscount of any such notes should be received in the future they would be handled under the pertinent provisions of the law in the same manner as if the provisions of the regulation were still in effect. (As indicated below, the designation \"Regulation G\" was applied later in the year to the regulation issued by the Board on noncash collections.) Extension of Credit by Brokers, Dealers, and Members of National Securities Exchanges.—Effective May 22, 1939, the Board of Governors amended its Regulation T, relating to the extension and maintenance of credit by brokers, dealers, and members of national securities exchanges. The amendment clarified and liberalized, with appropriate safeguards, provisions that relate to bona fide cash transactions in securities and to certain other classes of transactions that are not effected in margin accounts. Loans to Executive Officers.—Effective July 1, 1939, the Board of Governors amended the definition of the term \"executive officer\" contained in section 1(b) of its Regulation 0, which relates to loans to executive officers of member banks. The regulation had previously included as \"executive officers,\" among others, all persons who have certain titles, such as chairman of the board, president, vice-president, etc., regardless of their actual duties. The amendment provided that the term should include only those officers who actually participate or have authority to participate in the operating management of the bank or a branch, but provided that persons having certain titles, such as chairman of the board, president, vice-president, etc., would be assumed to be executive officers \"unless it is provided by resolution of the board of directors or the bank's by-laws that any such officer is not authorized to participate in the operating management of the bank and he does not actually participate therein.\" The amendment also changed the date in section 4(a) of the regulation to \"June 16, 1944.\" This change was made to conform to the change 24 ANNUAL REPORT OF BOARD OF GOVERNORS in the law, as referred to above, which extended until June 16, 1944, the date to which loans made by member banks to their executive officers prior to June 16, 1933, may be extended or renewed. Interlocking Bank Directorates under the Clayton Act.—Effective August 1, 1939, the Board of Governors amended sections 3(a) and 3(e) of its Regulation L, relating to interlocking bank directorates under the Clayton Act, so as to extend until February 1, 1940, the time during which certain persons who had been serving member banks might continue to serve a member bank and not more than one other bank. Check Clearing and Collection.—Effective September 1, 1939, the Board revised its Regulation J, relating to check clearing and collection. The revision, which made a number of technical changes in the regulation, was adopted in connection with the new procedure established at the Federal Reserve banks to give their member banks more prompt credit for checks deposited with the Reserve banks for collection and to reduce the amount of work required in preparing checks for deposit with the Reserve banks. Trust Powers of National Banks.—Effective November 20, 1939, the Board of Governors amended its Regulation F, relating to trust powers of national banks. The only substantial change made was in the requirements of section 11 regarding self-dealing in the investment of trust funds and the sale or transfer of trust assets. The change exempted from the requirements of the section all transactions which are specifically authorized by court order. Certain other clarifying and technical changes also were made in the regulation. Membership of State Banking Institutions in the Federal Reserve System.—Effective November 20, 1939, the Board of Governors amended its Regulation H, relating to membership of State banking institutions in the Federal Reserve System. A number of technical changes were made in the regulation, but the principal changes were those made necessary by the repeal, as referred to above, of the statutory requirement in subsection (y) of section 12B of the Federal Reserve Act that after July 1, 1942, each State bank with average deposits of $1,000,000 or more must be a member of the Federal Reserve System in order to have its deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under\" section 12B of the Federal Reserve Act. Regulation on Noncash Collections.—On December 26, 1939, the Board of Governors adopted a regulation governing the collection by Federal Reserve banks of notes and bills and other \"noncash items\" for member banks and nonmember clearing banks. The new regulation was made effective February 1, 1940, and was designated Regulation G. (The designation \"Regulation G\" had previously applied to the Board's regulation relating to the rediscount by Federal Reserve banks of notes secured by adjusted service certificates, but that regulation, as indi FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 25 cated above, was repealed on April 6, 1939.) The regulation on noncash collections was issued by the Board in order that the principal terms and conditions relating to the collection of such items might be published in the Federal Register and it required no change in the existing practices of the Federal Reserve banks. Other provisions regarding the collection of noncash items are contained, as heretofore, in the circulars of the individual Federal Reserve banks. BANK EXAMINATIONS Federal Reserve Banks.—Each of the 12 Federal Reserve banks was examined during the year by the Board's Division of Examinations. Foreign Banking 'Corporations.—The head office of the one banking corporation now in active operation organized under the provisions of section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act to engage in foreign or international banking was examined during the year by the Board's Division of Examinations. Member Banks.—All member banks are examined by a Federal agency; national banks by the Comptroller of the Currency, and State member banks by the Federal Reserve System. State member banks are subject, under the provisions of the Federal Reserve Act, to examinations made by direction of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or of the Federal Reserve banks by examiners selected or approved by the Board of Governors. The policy approved by the Board of Governors for examinations pursuant to such provisions is that at least one regular examination of each State member bank, including its trust department, be made during each calendar year by examiners for the Federal Reserve banks. In order to avoid duplication of examinations and to minimize inconvenience to the banks examined, the policy of making joint examinations in cooperation with the State banking authorities wherever practicable was followed during the past year as in previous years. GRANTS OF AUTHORITY During the year 1939, 20 national banks were granted authority by the Board to exercise one or more trust powers under the provisions of section 11 (k) of the Federal Reserve Act. This numnatimud banks ^eY m c m d e s grants of one or more additional powers to three banks which previously had been granted certain trust powers; it also includes one grant of trust powers contingent upon the consolidation of a national bank with a State institution having a trust department, and one grant of trust powers contingent upon the conversion of a State bank into a national banking association, neither of which transactions had been consummated by the end of the year. 26 ANNUAL REPORT OF BOARD OF GOVERNORS In ten cases the grant of trust powers did not represent the establishment of new trust facilities. In nine of such cases the grants were made in connection with the conversion of a State bank into a national bank or the consolidation of a State bank with a national bank, thereby enabling the national banks concerned to continue operation of trust departments acquired by reason of such conversions or consolidations. In the other case the grant was made to a newly organized national bank to enable it to acquire the trust business of its predecessor national bank. One grant of trust powers was made to a newly chartered national bank which was organized solely for the purpose of doing a trust business. I t appears that this is the first instance of a national bank being chartered under such circumstances. During the year, 12 operating national banks surrendered their trust powers, and the trust powers of 15 other national banks were terminated, 14 because of the banks being placed in voluntary liquidation and one because of a consolidation with another national bank having trust powers. The reasons generally given for the surrender of trust powers were either the entire lack of trust business, or that the small amount of such business, past or prospective, did not justify maintenance of a trust department. The net result of the various actions with respect to trust powers during the year 1939 was a decrease of ten in the number of national banks holding one or more general powers, and a decrease of one in the number of national banks holding restricted trust powers. On December 31, 1939, 1,873 national banks held permits to exercise trust powers. A list of such banks with indication of the power or powers each bank is authorized to exercise will be supplied to those requesting it. This list does not include 12 national banks which had authority at that time to exercise restricted trust powers only. The term \"restricted trust powers\" as used above refers to powers granted a bank to acquire certain trust accounts but not to acquire other fiduciary business. Such restricted powers have been granted to enable a newly organized, consolidated, or converted institution to acquire the trust business held by a predecessor bank or banks, or to enable a bank to administer one or more specific trust accounts, when, in the light of all the facts and circumstances in the particular case, such action was deemed warranted. During the year 1939 the Board acted upon the applications for voting permits submitted by holding company affiliates of member banks in accordance with the provisions of section 5144 of ?ffililtl s C O m p a n y t h e R e v i s e d Statutes and section 9 of the Federal Reserve Act, and authorized the issuance of six permits for general purposes and six permits for limited purposes. Under the authority of section 301 of the Banking Act of 1935, the FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 27 Board determined that seven organizations were not engaged directly or indirectly as a business in holding the stock of, or managing or controlling, banks, banking associations, savings banks or trust companies, and that, therefore, they were not holding company affiliates except for the purposes of section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. During the year there were no changes in the list of foreign banking corporations operating under agreements entered into with the Board of Governors pursuant to section 25 of the Federal ReForeign banking s e rve Act and of foreign banking corporations charcorporations i -r» i i .. tered by the Board under the provisions of section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act, The 4 corporations organized under State law and operating under agreements with the Board pursuant to the provisions of section 25 of the Federal Reserve Act relating to the investment by member banks in stocks of corporations engaged principally in international or foreign banking are: Bankers Company of New York, which is affiliated with the Bankers Trust Company of New York; International Banking Corporation, which is affiliated with the National City Bank of New York; First of Boston International Corporation, wrhich is affiliated with the First National Bank of Boston; and French American Banking Corporation, wrhich is owned by the Guaranty Trust Company of New York, the First National Bank of Boston, and the Comptoir National D'Escompte of Paris. The Chase Bank, which commenced business in 1930 and is affiliated with the Chase National Bank of New York, is the only banking corporation in active operation organized under the provisions of section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act to engage in international or foreign banking. Two of the five corporations referred to above have no foreign branches. The other three corporations operate, either directly or through subsidiary corporations, 11 foreign branches or offices. There has been no change in the list of such branches during the past year, and they are located as follows: in England, 3; France, 3; Spain, 2; China, 2; Hong Kong, 1. During the year the Board granted a member bank permission to establish two foreign branches, which, however, had not been formally opened for business by the end of the year. Due to Foreign branches w a r cono }itions certain member banks with branches of m e m b e r banks in London obtained the Board's permission to transfer the banking activities of the branches to points outside that city whenever such action is deemed necessary during the present emergency. Two London offices of member banks have been temporarily closed by reason of exigencies of the war. At the end of the year, 7 member banks were operating a total of 92 28 ANNUAL REPORT OF BOARD OF GOVERNORS branches or offices located in 62 cities in 22 foreign dencies or insular possessions of the United States. and offices, 4 national banks were operating 83, and bers were operating 9.

At the end of the year there were 152 nonmember banks with such agreements in force.
