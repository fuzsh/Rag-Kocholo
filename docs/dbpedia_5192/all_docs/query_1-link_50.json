        "text": "WARREN COUNTY\n\nCOUNTY ROADS\n\nWarren County roads are not posted in the standard fashion, although markers like the one shown above are affixed to some sign posts, usually at the beginning of a county-maintained road. Tenth-mile markers are posted along the remainder of the route. Rick Harrington has a few pictures of Warren County signage practices and anomalies.\n\nWarren County's highways range in character from lonely, wooded access roads to high-volume suburban thoroughfares. A number of county highways are short streets in the larger unincorporated communities. A numbered route may bear several different names throughout its length. Conversely, a single road name may carry several different numbers, usually changing at major intersections or town lines.\n\nIn the \"Towns\" column, Villages are also shown. No county highways enter the City of Glens Falls.\n\n# NAME FROM TO TOWNS NOTES 1 Riverside Station Road c. 0.9 mi.
