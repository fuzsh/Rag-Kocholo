        "text": "AWS Fargate Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS-140)\n\nFederal Information Processing Standard (FIPS). FIPS-140 is a U.S. and Canadian government standard that specifies the security requirements for cryptographic modules that protect sensitive information. FIPS-140 defines a set of validated cryptography functions that can be used to encrypt data in transit and data at rest.\n\nWhen you turn on FIPS-140 compliance, you can run workloads on Fargate in a manner that is compliant with FIPS-140. For more information about FIPS-140 compliance, see Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2.\n\nAWS Fargate FIPS-140 Considerations\n\nConsider the following when using FIPS-140 compliance on Fargate:\n\nUse FIPS on Fargate\n\nUse the following procedure to use FIPS-140 compliance on Fargate.\n\nUse CloudTrail for Fargate FIPS-140 auditing\n\nCloudTrail is turned on in your AWS account when you create the account. When API and console activity occurs in Amazon ECS, that activity is recorded in a CloudTrail event along with other AWS service events in Event history. You can view, search, and download recent events in your AWS account. For more information, see Viewing Events with CloudTrail Event History.\n\nFor an ongoing record of events in your AWS account, including events for Amazon ECS, create a trail which CloudTrail uses to deliver log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By default, when you create a trail in the console, the trail applies to all regions. The trail logs events from all Regions in the AWS partition and delivers the log files to the Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. Additionally, you can configure other AWS services to further analyze and act upon the event data collected in CloudTrail logs. For more information, see Log Amazon ECS API calls using AWS CloudTrail.\n\nThe following example shows a CloudTrail log entry that demonstrates the PutAccountSettingDefault API action:"
