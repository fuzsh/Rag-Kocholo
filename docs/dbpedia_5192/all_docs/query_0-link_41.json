        "text": "New York’s Conditional Adult-Use Retail Dispensary (CAURD) licenses are temporary licenses only available for “justice-involved” applicants in the first round of applicants for cannabis retail (dispensary) licensure. To be considered “justice-involved” the applicant must have a cannabis-related offense or have an immediate family member with a cannabis-related offense, who have experience owning and operating a profitable business. These individuals must show evidence of running a profitable business for two (2) consecutive years.\n\nThe Cannabis Control Board (CCB) received 903 applications for the Conditional Adult-Use Retail Dispensary in the summer of 2022, and awarding 463 total licenses in late into 2022 and 2023. This has allowed the first cannabis retail store (or dispensary) to open before the end of 2022, which was selling New York first regulated and tested cannabis products. New York’s implementation of conditional cannabis licenses will assist the state in catching up with its neighbors in the Tri-state area, New Jersey and Connecticut, and has allowed recreational cannabis (non-medical or adult-use cannabis).\n\nConditional licenses are valid for four (4) years from the date of license issuance by the OCM. License holders may apply to convert their “Conditional Adult-Use Retail Dispensary License” to a standard, “Adult-Use Dispensary License” prior to its expiration. License holders would be required to enter a labor peace agreement with a bona fide labor organization. Note, this is not to be confused with the State of New Jersey. New Jersey’s conditional licenses are meant to allow people to obtain adult-use cannabis licenses without large amounts of capital pre-application.\n\nAnyone. In the first round of licensure, the adult-use (non-medical/recreational) dispensary (cannabis retail) licensing process is designed to favor those that have a past conviction of a cannabis offense or have a close relationship with someone who has been charged and convicted with a cannabis-related offense. We refer to this as “justice-involved” individuals.\n\nApplicants will also need to prove that they have had at least 10% ownership in a profitable business for at least two years.\n\nResidency Requirement\n\nA majority of the ownership of the applying company/entity must have been in New York State for 180 days within the last year, or 540 days within the last three years.\n\nConviction Requirements\n\nThe applicant, of if the applicant was dependent to must have been convicted of a cannabis-related offense in New York State at any time prior to 3/31/2021.\n\nBusiness Requirements\n\nYou need to have held at least 10% ownership for two years in a business that had at least two years of net profit.\n\nOr if you’ve owned at least part of a non-profit, a non-profit that has all the following:\n\nHave people with marijuana convictions in New York on its board or as its officers\n\nHas at least two years of positive net assets or profit\n\nHas at least 5 full-time employees\n\nServes individuals and communities with high rates of cannabis-related arrests and convictions\n\nHas a history of creating work for people with marijuana convictions\n\nOwnership Percentages\n\nThe entity with sole control of the applying business and at least 30% of the ownership interest must meet the residency requirement AND the conviction and for-profit business requirement OR the non-profit business requirement.\n\nIn addition, at least 51% of the applying business’s ownership interest must 1) meet residency requirement AND the conviction and for-profit business requirement OR the non-profit business requirement or 2) the conviction requirement.\n\nNo, you can no longer apply for a CAURD License.\n\nThe CAURD licensing program was put on pause in late 2023 after an injunction was filed.\n\nThe Coalition for Access to Regulated & Safe Cannabis (CARSC), also known as the Registered Organizations (ROs), initiated legal action in Albany’s state court. They levied accusations against regulatory bodies for mishandling the launch of New York’s cannabis market, which they claimed obstructed the entry of licensed entities and enabled the proliferation of unlicensed vendors (referencing Coalition for Access to Regulated & Safe Cannabis v. New York, Index No. 902390-2023, filed in N.Y. Supreme Court, Albany County on Mar. 16, 2023).\n\nThis backdrop set the stage for the CARSC and Fiore disputes, which were ultimately settled in a manner akin to the Variscite case. These settlements not only provided licenses to the complainants but also instituted a pause on new CAURD applications, though it allowed for the processing of existing ones."
