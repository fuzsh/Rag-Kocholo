        "text": "Standards and Specifications\n\nStandards and specifications are rules and guidelines by which methods, manufactured items, linkages, and so on, are made more compatible, safer, replaceable or connectable. They impose a certain minimum quality level for products and services.

Generally they are not listed in the Library's catalog but may be located using indexes. Librarians will provide assistance in locating these publications.\n\nSpecifications and standards have unique alpha-numeric document numbers which generally include the year of issue. The number is sufficient when requesting a publication, but it is helpful to have the title or subject also, for verification. If the number is not available, the name of the issuing group and title or subject should be provided. The year should be given when not part of the number.\n\nUnless otherwise specified, the latest version will be supplied."
