This chapter describes some of these standards and regulations.\n\n9.1. Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)\n\nThe Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 140-2 is a computer security standard, developed by the U.S. Government and industry working group to validate the quality of cryptographic modules. See the official FIPS publications at NIST Computer Security Resource Center.\n\nThe FIPS 140-2 standard ensures that cryptographic tools implement their algorithms properly. See the full FIPS 140-2 standard at http://dx.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.FIPS.140-2 for further details on these levels and the other specifications of the FIPS standard.\n\nTo learn about compliance requirements, see the Red Hat Government Standards page.\n\n9.1.1. Enabling FIPS Mode\n\nTo make Red Hat Enterprise Linux compliant with the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 140-2, you need to make several changes to ensure that accredited cryptographic modules are used. You can either enable FIPS mode during system installation or after it.\n\nDuring the System Installation\n\nTo fulfil the strict FIPS 140-2 compliance, add the fips=1 kernel option to the kernel command line during system installation. With this option, all keys' generations are done with FIPS-approved algorithms and continuous monitoring tests in place. After the installation, the system is configured to boot into FIPS mode automatically.\n\nImportant\n\nEnsure that the system has plenty of entropy during the installation process by moving the mouse around or by pressing many keystrokes. The recommended amount of keystrokes is 256 and more. Less than 256 keystrokes might generate a non-unique key.\n\nAfter the System Installation\n\nTo turn the kernel space and user space of your system into FIPS mode after installation, follow these steps:\n\nInstall the dracut-fips package:\n\n~]# yum install dracut-fips\n\nFor CPUs with the AES New Instructions (AES-NI) support, install the dracut-fips-aesni package as well:\n\n~]# yum install dracut-fips-aesni\n\nRegenerate the initramfs file:\n\n~]# dracut -v -f\n\nTo enable the in-module integrity verification and to have all required modules present during the kernel boot, the initramfs file has to be regenerated.\n\nWarning\n\nThis operation will overwrite the existing initramfs file.\n\nModify boot loader configuration.\n\nTo boot into FIPS mode, add the fips=1 option to the kernel command line of the boot loader. If your /boot partition resides on a separate partition, add the boot=<partition> (where <partition> stands for /boot) parameter to the kernel command line as well.\n\nTo identify the boot partition, enter the following command:\n\n~]$ df /boot Filesystem 1K-blocks Used Available Use% Mounted on /dev/sda1 495844 53780 416464 12% /boot\n\nTo ensure that the boot= configuration option works even if the device naming changes between boots, identify the universally unique identifier (UUID) of the partition by running the following command:\n\n~]$ blkid /dev/sda1 /dev/sda1: UUID=\"05c000f1-f899-467b-a4d9-d5ca4424c797\" TYPE=\"ext4\"\n\nAppend the UUID to the kernel command line:\n\nboot=UUID=05c000f1-f899-467b-a4d9-d5ca4424c797\n\nDepending on your boot loader, make the following changes:\n\nGRUB 2\n\nAdd the fips=1 and boot=<partition of /boot> options to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX key in the /etc/default/grub file. To apply the changes to /etc/default/grub, rebuild the grub.cfg file as follows:\n\nOn BIOS-based machines, enter the following command as root:\n\n~]# grub2-mkconfig -o /etc/grub2.cfg\n\nOn UEFI-based machines, enter the following command as root:\n\n~]# grub2-mkconfig -o /etc/grub2-efi.cfg\n\nzipl (on the IBM Z Systems architecture only)\n\nAdd the fips=1 and boot=<partition of /boot> options to the /etc/zipl.conf to the kernel command line and apply the changes by entering:\n\n~]# zipl\n\nMake sure prelinking is disabled.\n\nFor proper operation of the in-module integrity verification, prelinking of libraries and binaries has to be disabled. Prelinking is done by the prelink package, which is not installed by default. Unless prelink has been installed, this step is not needed. To disable prelinking, set the PRELINKING=no option in the /etc/sysconfig/prelink configuration file. To disable existing prelinking on all system files, use the prelink -u -a command.\n\nReboot your system.\n\nEnabling FIPS Mode in a Container\n\nA container can be switched to FIPS140-2 mode if the host is also set in FIPS140-2 mode and one of the following requirements is met:\n\nThe dracut-fips package is installed in the container.\n\nThe /etc/system-fips file is mounted on the container from the host."
