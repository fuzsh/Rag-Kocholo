        "text": "FIPS standards to identify U.S. national subdivisions\n\nFIPS state codes were numeric and two-letter alphabetic codes defined in U.S. Federal Information Processing Standard Publication (\"FIPS PUB\") 5-2 to identify U.S. states and certain other associated areas. The standard superseded FIPS PUB 5-1 on May 28, 1987, and was superseded on September 2, 2008, by ANSI standard INCITS 38:2009.[1]\n\nThe codes are used in Geographic Names Information System, overseen by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. The codes were assigned by NIST and each uniquely identified a state, the District of Columbia, or an outlying area of the U.S. These codes were used by the U.S. Census Bureau, the Department of Agriculture to form milk-processing plant numbers, some cash registers during check approval, and in the Emergency Alert System (EAS).\n\nThe FCC assigned additional numeric codes used with the EAS for territorial waters of the U.S., but these were not part of the FIPS standard.\n\nThe FIPS state alpha code for each U.S. states and the District of Columbia are identical to the postal abbreviations by the United States Postal Service. From September 3, 1987, the same was true of the alpha code for each of the outlying areas, with the exception of U.S. Minor Outlying Islands (UM) as the USPS routes mail for these islands indirectly.\n\nEach of the various minor outlying islands that fell within alpha code UM had an individual numeric code, but no individual alpha code.\n\nOn September 2, 2008, FIPS 5-2 was one of ten standards withdrawn by NIST as a Federal Information Processing Standard.[2]\n\nFIPS state codes\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following table enumerates the FIPS state alpha and numeric codes for the states, the District of Columbia, the outlying areas of the United States, the freely associated states, and trust territory, and FIPS state numeric codes for the individual minor outlying island territories.\n\nOnly actual U.S. states and the District of Columbia had FIPS state numeric codes in the range 01 through 56.\n\nFIPS PUB 5-1 (published on June 15, 1970, and superseded by FIPS PUB 5-2 on May 28, 1987) stated that certain numeric codes \"are reserved for possible future use in identifying American Samoa (03), Canal Zone (07), Guam (14), Puerto Rico (43), and Virgin Islands (52)\", but these codes were omitted from FIPS PUB 5-2 without comment. These areas are marked with a * and highlighted in red in the table below.[3]\n\nFor states, the \"Status\" column in the table below includes a link to a list of the counties (boroughs and census areas in Alaska; parishes in Louisiana) for that state including the county codes as defined in FIPS PUB 6-4. The listings of counties for other areas are set out at the end of this article.\n\nName Alpha code Numeric code Status Alabama AL 01 State; counties Alaska AK 02 State; boroughs American Samoa AS 60 Outlying area under U.S. sovereignty American Samoa * 03 (FIPS 5-1 reserved code) Arizona AZ 04 State; counties Arkansas AR 05 State; counties Baker Island BI 81 Minor outlying island territory California CA 06 State; counties Canal Zone * 07 (FIPS 5-1 reserved code) Colorado CO 08 State; counties Connecticut CT 09 State; counties Delaware DE 10 State; counties District of Columbia DC 11 Federal district[4] Florida FL 12 State; counties Federated States of Micronesia FM 64 Freely Associated State Georgia GA 13 State; counties Guam * 14 (FIPS 5-1 reserved code) Guam GU 66 Outlying area under U.S. sovereignty Hawaii HI 15 State; counties Howland Island HI 84 Minor outlying island territory Idaho ID 16 State; counties Illinois IL 17 State; counties Indiana IN 18 State; counties Iowa IA 19 State; counties Jarvis Island JI 86 Minor outlying island territory Johnston Atoll JA 67 Minor outlying island territory Kansas KS 20 State; counties Kentucky KY 21 State; counties Kingman Reef KR 89 Minor outlying island territory Louisiana LA 22 State; parishes Maine ME 23 State; counties Marshall Islands MH 68 Freely Associated State Maryland MD 24 State; counties Massachusetts MA 25 State; counties Michigan MI 26 State; counties Midway Islands MI 71 Minor outlying island territory Minnesota MN 27 State; counties Mississippi MS 28 State; counties Missouri MO 29 State; counties Montana MT 30 State; counties Navassa Island NI 76 Minor outlying island territory Nebraska NE 31 State; counties Nevada NV 32 State; counties New Hampshire NH 33 State; counties New Jersey NJ 34 State; counties New Mexico NM 35 State; counties New York NY 36 State; counties North Carolina NC 37 State; counties North Dakota ND 38 State; counties Northern Mariana Islands MP 69 Outlying area under U.S. sovereignty Ohio OH 39 State; counties Oklahoma OK 40 State; counties Oregon OR 41 State; counties Palau PW 70 Freely Associated State Palmyra Atoll PA 95 Minor outlying island territory Pennsylvania PA 42 State; counties Puerto Rico * 43 (FIPS 5-1 reserved code) Puerto Rico PR 72 Outlying area under U.S. sovereignty Rhode Island RI 44 State; counties South Carolina SC 45 State; counties South Dakota SD 46 State; counties Tennessee TN 47 State; counties Texas TX 48 State; counties U.S. Minor Outlying Islands UM 74 Minor outlying island territories (aggregated) Utah UT 49 State; counties Vermont VT 50 State; counties Virginia VA 51 State; counties Virgin Islands of the U.S. * 52 (FIPS 5-1 reserved code) Virgin Islands of the U.S. VI 78 Outlying area under U.S. sovereignty Wake Island WI 79 Minor outlying island territory Washington WA 53 State; counties West Virginia WV 54 State; counties Wisconsin WI 55 State; counties Wyoming WY 56 State; counties\n\nCounty codes\n\n[edit]\n\nSupplemental codes for maritime areas\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Emergency Alert System (EAS) and the weather radio service provided by NOAA use these codes to supplement FIPS PUB 5-2 to include certain maritime areas.[5]\n\nEAS code Maritime area 57 Pacific coast from Washington to California 58 Alaskan coast 59 Hawaiian coast 61 American Samoa waters 65 Mariana Islands waters (including Guam) 73 Atlantic coast from Maine to Virginia 75 Atlantic coast from North Carolina to Florida, and the coasts of Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands 77 Gulf of Mexico 91 Lake Superior 92 Lake Michigan 93 Lake Huron 94 St. Clair River, Detroit River, and Lake St. Clair 96 Lake Erie 97 Niagara River and Lake Ontario 98 St. Lawrence River\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nFIPS PUB 10-4 international region codes\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
