        "text": "Description\n\nSTATEFIP reports the state in which the household was located, using the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) coding scheme, which orders the states alphabetically.\n\nIn the 1980 Urban/Rural sample, STATEFIP identifies state groups that are not available in STATEICP; these state groups (codes 61-68) are only available for that particular sample.\n\nSee \"Geographic Coding and Comparability\" for more information on the geographic detail available in particular samples.\n\nComparability\n\nAs long as boundary changes are taken into account, this variable is largely comparable across years.\n\nIn the two 1970 Metro samples, states are identified only for households in county groups that lie entirely within one state. (See CNTYGP97 for more information about county groups.) Households in county groups that span state boundaries have a \"99\" STATEFIP code. Only 5 states (Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, and Hawaii), plus the District of Columbia, have completely identifiable records. To obtain representative 1970 data for all states, use the 1970 State samples.\n\nSee STATEICP for more discussion of comparability issues."
