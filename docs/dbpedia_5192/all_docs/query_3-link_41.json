        "text": "Innovation in next-generation encryption\n\nCisco is a leader in securing Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140 validations. We are dedicated to information assurance and complying with standards for both product depth and breadth. FIPS 140 is a U.S. and Canadian government standard that specifies security requirements for cryptographic modules. A cryptographic module is defined as \"the set of hardware, software, and/or firmware that implements approved security functions (including cryptographic algorithms and key generation) and is contained within the cryptographic boundary.\" The cryptographic module is what is being validated.\n\nTo learn more visit the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Computer Security Resource Center.\n\nFull listing of Cisco FIPS validated crypto modules\n\nFIPS 140 compliance review\n\nOur Global Certification and Common Security Modules Team implemented an innovative approach to expedite FIPS certifications. They developed a crypto module that is already FIPS-validated and can be embedded in Cisco products. Because the crypto module is already FIPS-validated, the Cisco product can claim compliance to FIPS 140.\n\nThe compliance process verifies that the Cisco product has implemented cryptography according to standards and all applications that use cryptography, do so correctly. Cisco’s FIPS Compliance Reviews can be found in the table below.\n\nTransition to FIPS 140-3\n\nCisco is working the transition from FIPS 140-2 to FIPS 140-3, which is best summarized at this NIST page\n\nThe key item to note is that “Modules validated as conforming to FIPS 140-2 will continue to be accepted by the Federal agencies of both countries for the protection of sensitive information (United States) or Designated Information (Canada) through September 22, 2026. After that time CMVP will place the FIPS 140-2 validated modules on the Historical List, allowing agencies to continue using these modules for existing applications only.”\n\nCisco has several 140-3 validations in process, and will continue moving the portfolio of 140-2 validations to 140-3 over the next several years."
