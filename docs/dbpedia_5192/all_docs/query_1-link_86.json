        "text": "TRAILING the candidates through the key primary states as a political correspondent many years ago, I decided that, California aside, I liked Wisconsin best. I respected its political creativity, especially under the La Follettes, who prefigured the New Deal. I grew fond of its rich, bucolic landscapes -- the red barns, the black-and-white cows and the fields of lime-green grass interrupted by bands of chocolate-brown earth.\n\nI also learned to admire Wisconsin's people. They are a well-educated lot, modest, public spirited, committed to preserving the environment and intensely proud of their ethnic heritage. The gravestones in the Catholic churchyard at Independence, near Eau Claire, could be in Warsaw: Woychik, Kowalski, Klimek and Jaszewski.\n\nThe Danish-Americans of Racine still eat the buttery kringles turned out by local bakeries, which put the ''Danish'' pastry New Yorkers eat to shame. The Swiss and the Dutch make superb cheeses (and Green Bay Packers fans wear blocks of foam rubber cheese on their heads). The Germans wolf down sausages of a hundred different varieties.\n\nWhat Midwestern heart could resist? Certainly not mine, and over the years my wife, Betsey, a devout Southerner, has come to share my enthusiasm. So when a hole opened in our schedule, we decided to take a breather and drive across Wisconsin from Minneapolis to Milwaukee. On the Interstate, the run takes eight hours, but we opted for byways, wandering unhurriedly for four days in search of pleasures recalled and anticipated.\n\nAs we drove along the Wisconsin shore of the young but already broad Mississippi River southeast of Minneapolis, admiring the willows in their gauzy early-spring foliage, it started to snow. Big, wet flakes. In April. Steam rose from the marshes, and the shivering ducks acted as if they had been cruelly misled by the weatherman.\n\nThat's the way life goes in the Upper Midwest. When we stopped for dinner at the Harbor View Cafe in Pepin, the bartender, Durk Stark, made us a pair of mean martinis and told us it had been 91 degrees earlier in the week. ''What can you do?'' he said. Later we discovered that his wife was the town's Lutheran pastor, which must make for a nice balance in their household.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
