        "text": "For system architects\n\nThe Cyber Centre recommends only using only CMVP validated products when system architectures include cryptography. Using CMVP-validated products ensures that when information is encrypted, it happens with an approved algorithm, with keys that have been generated or derived in an approved manner, using an approved strength, in both length and randomness. The Cyber Centre considers using unvalidated cryptography as providing no protection to the information; in other words, it is equivalent to plaintext.\n\nPlease see how to select a CMVP validated product for more information on selecting the right validated product for your architecture.\n\nFor purchasers\n\nPrior to using any product that implements cryptography, the Cyber Centre recommends that organizations obtain a copy of the vendor's FIPS 140-2 or FIPS 140-3 validation certificate or certificate number for the product and validate these certificates against the CMVP's validation list. The standard provides four increasing, qualitative levels of security: Levels 1 through 4. These levels cover the wide range of potential applications and environments where you may use cryptography. The security requirements cover 11 areas related to the secure design and implementation of a cryptographic module. The Cyber Centre advises that the overall rating of a cryptographic module is not necessarily the most important rating.\n\nVendors often include a variety of terms for conformance claims in marketing material, which can be confusing. For example, here is the Cyber Centre's opinion regarding the acceptability of the following claims of conformance to FIPS 140:\n\nThe module has been designed for compliance to FIPS 140. No\n\nThe module has been pre-validated and is on the CMVP pre-validation list. No\n\nThe module will be submitted for testing. No\n\nThe module has been independently reviewed and tested to comply with FIPS 140 No\n\nThe module meets all the requirements of FIPS 140. No\n\nThe module implements FIPS Approved algorithms; including having algorithm certificates. No\n\nThe module follows the guidelines detailed in FIPS 140. No\n\nThe module has been validated and has received Certificate #9999. Yes\n\nPlease see how to select a CMVP validated product for more information on selecting the right validated product for your architecture."
