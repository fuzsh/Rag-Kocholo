Any revenue derived from such conveyance must be paid into an account of the state to be used only for acquisi- tions to the forest preserve. JUSTIFICATION: The land that comprises Camp Gabriels has been continuously developed since at least 1895 and was in private hands until 1982. The site and several buildings were acquired for use as a sanatorium by the Sisters of Mercy Order. Sanatorium Gabriels officially opened in July 1987 for the treatment of Tuberculosis. After World War II, the facility was used for the field of geriatrics due to the decline in the number of tubercu- losis cases. Eventually, the Sisters of Mercy Order decide d to sell the property and it was sold on August 15, 1965 for $150,000 to Paul Smith's College. The Gabriels campus included student housing as well as classrooms and a cafeteria. New buildings were added to the campus. By 1988 many buildings were not used due to declining enrollments and the College began moving the Forestry Program back to the main campus. On April 9, 1982, the Department of Correctional Services (\"DOCS\") purchased the property from Paul Smith's College for $635,000. At that time, the property consisted of approximately 221 acres and included 19 buildings. The contract of sale was approved by the Attorney General and OSC. The full warranty deed was executed by the College and recorded with the Franklin County Clerk's office on June 21, 1982. The deed provides that \"It is intended that all of the above-described premises, except for the following described parcel... become and be part of the Adirondack Forest Preserve.\" The portion that was intended to be exempted consisted of the developed portion of the property that was to be used by DOCS as Camp Gabriels with some surrounding trees. DEC applied to OGS under Section 3(4) of the Public Lands Law for a transfer of jurisdiction of 129.2 acres deemed necessary for addition to the Adirondack Forest Preserve. The application was approved by OGS in an order dated March 3, 1983. During the time Camp Gabriels was a corrections facility, a number of existing buildings were upgraded and new buildings were constructed. Camp Gabriels was closed and vacated by DOCS effective July 1, 2009 in accordance with the requirements of Chap- ter 56 of the Laws of 2009. It was subsequently transferred pursuant to the Public Lands Law to OGS' jurisdiction. In a memo dated December 17, 2010, OGS received advice from the Executive Director of the Adirondack Park Agency with respect to the proposed reuse of the property, which included classifying it as \"Moderate Intensity Use. That use of the property allows for development opportunities in areas where development will not significantly harm the physical and biological resources. According to the APA's Memorandum, the Camp has enough acreage for 71 principal buildings under the Adirondack Park Land Use and Development Plan. OGS' Report of Physical Inspection of Improvements, dated Septem- ber 9, 2010, stated that the size of the property is +- 91.7 acres and that there are a total of 48 structures that range from an open covered weight pavilion, an outdoor cooler and freezer to a chapel and shrine, an administrative building, housing units and several support buildings. The Report also noted that there is a Sewage Treatment Plant and a Wastewater Treatment Plant. OGS has twice attempted unsuccessfully to sell the property at auction, in April and November, 2011. Since that time, there has been renewed interest in selling or leasing Camp Gabriels, currently including a not-for-profit organization that operates educational summer camps for young children and teenagers purchasing the property as well as a group interested in developing a Native American cultural education center. This constitutional amendment would enable the sale, lease or other disposition for Camp Gabriels thereby assisting the local economy and communities as well as removing this property as a financial liability for the State.
