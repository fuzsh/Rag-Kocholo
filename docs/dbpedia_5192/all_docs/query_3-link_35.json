        "text": "The Federal Information Processing Standard 201 (FIPS 201) Evaluation Program (sometimes called the FICAM Testing Program) tests and certifies services and commercial products used in PIV credentialing systems, physical access control systems (PACS), and public key infrastructures (PKIs).\n\nProgram Announcements\n\nAnnouncements older than four years are removed. Contact us if you have any questions.\n\n+\n\n-\n\nTesting and Evaluation\n\nWe test and evaluate a variety of products and services, such as:\n\nSmart cards (secure elements) that are used in Personal Identity Verification (PIV), Personal Identity Verification - Interoperable (PIV-I), and Common Access Card (CAC) credentials.\n\nPhysical access control systems for buildings, including readers and infrastructure.\n\nService providers who manage, install, or provide hosted solutions for issuing Personal Identity Verification (PIV) and CAC credentials.\n\nIf you’re looking for testing procedures related to products not listed above, review the Program Announcements. Over the years, some product testing has been deprecated to eliminate redundancy, or the product categories have become stable and represent general commercial use products.\n\nProduct Testing\n\nProduct testing is performed by either:\n\nThird-party accredited testing labs, OR\n\nGSA-managed testing labs\n\nIf the product passes testing and review, the vendor is granted a certification letter, and the product is placed on the Approved Products List (APL). The APL includes product information, version, date of certification, and special considerations.\n\nVisit the Vendors page for more on testing and certification.\n\nTesting Guidance and Documents\n\nThe sections below provide the guidance and application documents associated with the testing and evaluation of the various products and services indicated in the Testing and Evaluation section above. Functional requirements for the products are outlined in each test procedure. Review the testing agreements and the test procedure for your specific product and submit the associated agreement and package to fips201ep@gsa.gov.\n\nPhysical Access Control System\n\nGSA tests and validates the interoperability of PIV and CAC credentials with the software and hardware used for physical access control to government facilities.\n\nReview the PACS APL Guidance Documents and PACS Application Package Requirements listed below, choose the application documentation that applies to your solution to be evaluated, and submit it to fips201ep@gsa.gov.\n\nPACS APL Guidance Documents\n\nThe documents in this section provide guidance and information necessary for evaluating a PACS solution to be listed on the FIPS 201 Evaluation Program’s Approved Products List (APL) and the criteria followed for the Removed Products List (RPL).
