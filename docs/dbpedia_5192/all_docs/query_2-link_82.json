Click on the dropdown menu to select the patient.\n\nOn a mobile device in “full site” view: In the upper right corner of the Patient Portal, next to your name, click the down arrow and select from the patient list.\n\nTo use the same email address for the Patient Portal, patients must choose one person to be the Patient Portal account owner. Additional patients will be added as family members. The Patient Portal account owner has access to all family members’ patient records when logged into the Patient Portal. For each patient to be the owner of a Patient Portal account, each patient must establish his or her own account using a unique email address.\n\nAll communications between you and your provider’s office are carried over a secure, encrypted connection. This secure connection utilizes industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption to ensure data transmission as well as server-side digital certification authentication. To prohibit unauthorized access, all medical information is stored behind our firewall in our electronic medical record system.\n\nYou should always make sure that the email address on file for your account is accurate, as notifications from the portal are sent to the email address on file. Make sure to sign out of your account each time you are finished using the portal.\n\nHudson Headwaters patients have secure online access to most of their personal medical information through our Patient Portal (click here to sign up). You can view your medication list, allergies, immunizations, appointment history and most test results. You may also complete and update medical forms, exchange messages with your primary care provider team and request non-urgent appointments and medication refills. Caregivers may also be given access to medical information."
