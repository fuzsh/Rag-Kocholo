        "text": "Unless otherwise specified, you can submit your grant application using our Online Grants Manager. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to contact us.\n\nWhen using our Online Grants Manager, applications must be received by 5:00 pm on the indicated deadline date to be considered eligible. For all other applications, they must be postmarked by the deadline date.\n\nThe 501(c)(3) is a section of the tax code which indicates that the IRS has determined an organization to be a charitable not-for-profit entity. When applying through our Online Grants Manager, you must include your EIN Number (Federal Tax ID) upon registering for an account.\n\nIf you are in the process of obtaining 501(c)(3) status, a copy of a receipt or acknowledgment from the IRS that the paperwork has been received will suffice. However, an award check will not be issued until the IRS has determined your 501(c)(3) status.\n\nWe make grants to registered nonprofits, public agencies, schools, and municipalities in the Adirondack region of New York. A small portion of our grantmaking goes to registered organizations outside the region when directed by our fundholders. Entities who do not have 501(c)(3) status may apply for grant awards to help further work with a clear charitable purpose if they can identify an eligible organization to act as a fiscal sponsor.\n\nAdirondack Foundation only makes grants to 501(c)(3) nonprofits, schools, and municipalities. If your organization does not have 501(c)(3) status, you might be able to use a fiscal sponsor, which is an organization with 501(c)(3) status and a mission that is supported by your project.\n\nThey must be willing to accept money on your behalf, and they would be ultimately responsible for making sure the project is completed and that all grant reports are filed as required. Some organizations charge a fee to be a sponsor. If you need to use a fiscal sponsor, we require the EIN Number from the sponsor's 501(c)(3) determination letter and a copy of the sponsor's financial statements with your application.\n\nIRS Form W-9 is the Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification form. We require a completed W-9 for individuals receiving grants over $600 from certain funds.\n\nIf you are an individual who has received a grant for over $600 and need to complete one of these forms, download one here and return to the Adirondack Foundation office via mail or by email to [email protected].\n\nThe advisors of funds at Adirondack Foundation and the Adirondack Foundation Board of Trustees want to know the impact that our grantmaking is having on individuals and communities served. Was the program a success? How did it affect the community? What were the challenges faced? What could be done differently next time?\n\nWe generally require follow up reports for all grantees. Unless otherwise specified, you can submit all grant reports via our Online Grants Manager.\n\nIf you are an individual who has received a grant from Adirondack Foundation – via the Uihlein-Ironman Sports Fund or Christopher Emmett Hallowell Fund – of $600 or more, you are required to complete an IRS Form W-9. (Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification). Please return your completed W-9 via email to [email protected], or send via mail.\n\nThe vast majority of Adirondack Foundation’s funds do not accept applications for support, as the grantmaking is either advised by a living donor to meet his or her charitable objectives or is predetermined by a specific fund purpose, such as an annual scholarship award or a permanently designated annual grant to a specific nonprofit organization.\n\nWhile applicants cannot directly apply to or contact these funds, please know that we do our best to keep our family of funds connected with emerging needs in our communities. If we see an opportunity to share a project or application with a fundholder, we may sometimes do so."
