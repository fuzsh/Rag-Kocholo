        "text": "This attachment lists Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) codes used to code respondents' state of birth and state of residence. The FIPS codes are taken from the Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 5-1, published June 15, 1970, FIPS 5-1, which supersedes FIPS 5, published November 1, 1963.\n\nStates of the United States (including the District of Columbia) with their assigned codes\n\nOutlying areas of the United States with their assigned codes\n\nAlabama through Montana FIPS Codes by County (separate document)\n\nNebraska through Wyoming FIPS Codes by County (separate document)\n\nSpecifications for States and Outlying Areas of the United States\n\nName of Standard. States and Outlying Areas of the United States.\n\nCategory of Standard. Federal General Data Standard, Representations and Codes.\n\nExplanation. This standard provides names, abbreviations and codes for representing the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the outlying areas, all of which are considered to be \"first order subdivisions\" of the United States.\n\nQualifications. In the application of this standard, any of the three forms of representation (i.e., names, abbreviations, or codes) may be used to represent those data elements having values (data items) of States or outlying areas of the United States. Names and abbreviations are preferred when human considerations and input reliability are important. The two character numeric code may be used in those applications where machine and numeric sorting considerations are more important, since a sort on the numeric code arranges the States in alphabetical sequence. The codes from FIPS 10, Countries, Dependencies, and Areas of Special Sovereignty, are listed in this standard for the outlying areas of the United States. The form of representation used (i.e., names, abbreviations, or codes) should be identified in format descriptions when data are interchanged.\n\nSpecial Information. Changes in this revision of the standard are noted by an asterisk in the left margin. Also, the number of changes which have occurred to an item since its original publication is noted by a superscript character following the code. All changes are explained by footnotes.\n\nSpecifications.\n\nTABLE 1: States of the United States (including the District of Columbia) with their assigned codes.\n\nName Abbrev. Code Name Abbrev.
