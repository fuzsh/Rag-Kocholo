Before Betty and Jughead from Riverdale were the most beloved couple on TV, there was Seth Cohen and Summer Roberts from The O.C.. Even though The O.C. has been off the air for some time now, fans still love the iconic teen drama. So much so that they're always asking for a reboot of the California-set series. If the show ever did get rebooted, though, fans would want Seth and Summer to still be together. Us Weekly caught up with Rachel Bilson to ask her whether she thinks they're living happily ever after.

“Oh my gosh, I try to remember. I’m like, 'What happened at the end?' I think Seth and Summer got married,” she said. “Yeah, sure. Why not? You always want a happy ending.”

Fans aren't the only ones who miss the good old days when The O.C. was on the air. “The whole time is like an amazing memory because it was really a transitional time,” Bilson revealed. “I was 21, and you’re so young, and I was so fortunate. It was like this ride we all went on together, that was really special. That’s always going to be, like, a cool memory for me.”

As for whether she'd ever participate in a reboot, she said: “I mean, you know, I never like to say never. I am so, I loved that show. I loved doing that show. I always bug [creator] Josh Schwartz about it. You know, if it was up to me, I’d be like, ‘Summer Breeze, is the name of this show.’”

Would you watch a reboot of The O.C.?
