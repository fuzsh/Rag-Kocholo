        "text": "Seth: Thor. That’s a strong name. No one’s gonna mess with Thor.\n\nRyan: Thanks.\n\nSeth: Seth’s a good name for a boy too. Although at Camp Takahoe I was often referred to as a girl. So I guess it works either way.\n\nRyan: Can we not play the name game?\n\nSeth: Not having anyone pick on me, there’s really been no need for the Seth Cohen retaliatory zinger.\n\nKirsten on the phone: My dad hates cilantro. If you put cilantro on anything I may be uninvite to the wedding.\n\nSandy: Somebody get me some cilantro.\n\nKirsten: And colored lights no way. White lights only. Because colored lights remin my father of a carnival. And he hates carnies.\n\nSandy: Note to self: hang with carnies.\n\nSandy: You’re not in school.\n\nRyan: Yeah, we were at the doctor’s office.\n\nKirsten: Is everything okay?\n\nSeth: Yeah, it’s fine.\n\nTheresa: I’m pregnant.\n\nSeth: Well, except for that.\n\nSummer: I’m freaking out.\n\nSeth: You’re freaking out? What about Ryan and Theresa?\n\nSummer: What about my best friend.\n\nSeth: Princess Sparkle is freaking out?\n\nSummer: Marissa, dumb ass.\n\nSeth: Oh. I always get those two confused. They both have really shiny hair.\n\nTheresa: 85¢. Great. I’ll put it towards the baby’s college tuition.\n\nCaleb: So. What are you going to do when I’m not around to make you feel better about yourself?\n\nSandy: What, are you going somewhere?\n\nCaleb: Maybe. Like say, San Quentin.\n\nSandy: So that’s why you wanted us out of the restaurant so fast. You sneaky… not-so-successful son of a bitch.\n\nJimmy: Hey kiddo. What are you doing?\n\nMarissa: Oh you know. Preparing to move into the House on Haunted Hill.\n\nJimmy: Hey, your mom has to wake up every morning and be Julie Cooper. That is punishment enough.\n\nSeth: Hey man. They raised me. Okay. Proof pudding. Speaking of pudding, mother, do we have any tapioca on tap?\n\nKirsten: You are king of the segues.\n\nSeth: I just love pudding. It’s so fun to say. Pudding. Pudding. Puuudding.\n\nKirsten: I have my secret recipe. Takeout.\n\nKirsten to Theresa: You won’t want to drive. I’m an excellent driver and an amazing parker.\n\nMarissa: I think we should spend this whole summer just being normal.\n\nRyan: We’re not holding Seth to that are we?\n\nMarissa: No, no. That’d be impossible.\n\nRyan: You’re talking to a boat, Seth.\n\nSeth: Yeah, I talk to a plastic horse, too. But that never worries anyone.\n\nRyan: It worried me.\n\nTheresa: Not having this baby makes the most sense.\n\nKirsten: You don’t have to make the decision that makes the most sense.\n\nSandy: Do you know what Ryan’s going through right now?!\n\nKirsten: Not as well as I know what she’s going through.\n\nKirsten: Denial is a very effective coping mechanism.\n\nSummer: I can’t believe your boat’s name is Summer. What a coincidence. My name’s Summer, your boat’s name is Summer. That’s kind of crazy.\n\nSeth: Yeah. It’s just crazy.\n\nSummer: Six thousand dollars in cash? What are you, fleeing the country or something?\n\nSeth: No, it’s for Ryan.\n\nSummer: What? For vintage wife-beaters?\n\nSandy: It’s ironic. Julie leaves Jimmy, marries you, now he’s worth millions. And you’re gonna be broke.\n\nCaleb: I don’t believe in irony.\n\nSandy: Well that’s too bad. Because, well it might be just the thing to get you through this.\n\nSeth: I think it was on this very stretch of beach where we first got our asses kicked by the water polo team.\n\nRyan: Yeah. Could be.\n\nSeth: Yes, it definitely tastes the same.\n\nMarissa: Wait, when was that?\n\nRyan: When I first got here.\n\nSeth: Yeah it was after the fashion show at Holly’s beach house.\n\nSummer: You guys were at that party?\n\nSeth: Those were the days.\n\nRyan: I’ve been thinking. I think… I need to go back. I can’t let Theresa do this by herself. I’m leaving.\n\nMarissa: Believe me, if there was something I could do, I would.\n\nSeth: Yeah, well, I think you’ve done enough, so…\n\nMarissa: What does that mean?\n\nSeth: I just don’t think even Ryan would be back with Theresa if it weren’t for you and Oliver in the first place.\n\nSummer: Cohen!\n\nSeth: Really. All you ever did was drag that kid into your messed-up life.\n\nMarissa: Right. And all you ever did was use him to meet girls and get out of fights.\n\nSandy: I told you. You could’ve done worse.\n\nSandy: Just because you’re leaving doesn’t mean I’m letting you go. pause. Now, come on, get dressed. You’re about to witness the most unholy of holy unions.\n\nSummer: They sent me out to find you. Found you. I figured you’d be stuffing your pockets with cocktail weinies.\n\nSummer: You’re still gonna see him. Chino’s not that far away.\n\nSeth: I just can’t believe he’s leaving. He’s the first real friend I’ve ever had. He’s the only real friend I’ve ever had.\n\nSummer: No. You have me.\n\nSeth: Yeah, but that’s not the same thing. You don’t get it. Before he got here, I was the biggest loser. This place was hell for me, okay? I can’t help him and I just, I can’t even imagine what’s it’s gonna be like here without him.\n\nSummer: We’ll get through it. I promise.\n\nSeth: Could you tell them I’ll be back in a few moments, please?\n\nSummer: Sure.\n\nSeth to Summer: And, for the record? The boat was named after you."
