        "text": "Ihave a confession: I don’t think I’ll ever be obsessed with anything ever again quite like I was obsessed with The OC. Case in Point:\n\nMy sister came across an email I sent her on February 6, 2005 right after my obesssion started and lovingly displayed it on my Facebook wall, not trying to embarrass me, at all:\n\nThis e-mail completely encapsulates the power The OC had over me from the moment I started watching it (mid-way through Season 2) FUN FACT: My first phone conversation with Nikki since college was actually after this crazy-OC-obsessed weekend. I needed someone to tell us what we missed in the few episodes of Season 2 and she was the one to save the day.\n\nIt’s been so long since I’ve watched The OC (it was last time my college roommate, Lucy, visited, and this was NOT the first weekend together we “wasted” watching The OC. Not that flying 2 hours to visit me and spend the weekend on the couch watching The OC should ever be called a waste) that I thought I’d dig deep into the depths of the world wide web and find the best gifs tumblr can offer to answer important unanswered questions like “Whatever happened to Marissa Cooper” and “Why did Seth and Summer (I mean Adam and Rachel) break up.”\n\nWhatever happened to Marissa Cooper?\n\nWell, we know what happened to Marissa, but I mean the real-life girl, Mischa Barton.\n\nBecause whenever she decided she was “too good”* for The OC and they had to kill off a MAIN CHARACTER by taking her down the worst downward spiral on television (Ew- remember when she hooked up with Volchok aka James the vampire from Twilight?) -yet somehow still remaining likable enough that I cried at her death, I’m sure she thought THAT’S when her career would take off, and The OC would fail behind her. And while it did only last another short season, she was never really missed and that last season was actually one of my favorites.\n\nSource\n\nSince the OC Misha has had a TON Of credits according to IMDB thought I’ve heard of none of them- except for Law & Order SVU. Yep, from Marissa Cooper, star of The OC, maker outer with Olivia Wilde and Ryan Atwood (Max Ions look-alike, am I right?) to dead girl on the New York streets.\n\nThe only other news I could dig up is that she is renting out her LA home for $35k a month, she owes a $90k bill to sober-coaches from 2009 and Tate Donovan (daddy Coop!) thinks she’s a ding dong.\n\nWhat is Taylor Townsend up to?\n\nSource\n\nAfter going from one of the world’s most annoying characters to a super likable one, Taylor Townsend, aka Autumn Reeser, did a bunch of stuff in TV & Film that you can read about on imdb and most importantly, had a cute kid and started a really great blog called Move Lifestyle. She’s so adorable now that you’ll completely forgot how she used to drive you nuts until that time when you realized what a terrible mother she had and then she and Ryan got super cute together. You’ll forget about the time before that time. I Promise. @AutumnReeser\n\nWhatever happened to Rosa the maid\n\nShe was in season 1. And I have no idea. I didn’t even remember The Cohen’s had a maid until I read someone asking this question on Tumblr. And, of course, now that I remember her, I could easily pick her out of a crowd of Mexican women wearing maid’s uniforms. #Thatsnormal\n\nWhy did Seth and Summer have to break up In Real Life?\n\nSeth and Summer are not only THE ultimate TV couple, they are the ultimate Real life couple. Geeky boy gets beautiful girl. He loves Comic Books, she fulfills as Wonder Woman fantasy. He has a plastic toy Horse, she has a My Little Pony. They.Are.Perfect\n\nIt’s always been you, Summer. It’s always been you and I’ve tried to fight it, and I’ve tried to deny it and I can’t. I can’t do it. You’re undeniable.\n\nEntire thing borrowed from This Tumblr because it’s SO DAMN GOOD\n\nAnd is it weird that even though they haven’t been together since 2006 and Adam is now dating Leighton Meister (YEP BLAIR WALDORF), and I THINK Rachel has been engaged for a few years to some loser, I still hope this happens to them in real life:\n\nSource\n\nListen to this once again, you won’t be sorry.\n\nFun Fact: I make Nikki play this whenever I visit and we drive on the 101.\n\nI will never, ever love a TV show as much as I love(d) The OC.\n\nLove,\n\nSeth Cohen lover for life"
