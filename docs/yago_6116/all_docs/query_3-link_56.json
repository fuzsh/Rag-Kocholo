        "text": "Rachel Bilson and a few close friends welcomed fans back to The O.C.\n\nBilson, who starred on the Fox teen drama series The O.C. as Summer Roberts, was joined by show creator Josh Schwartz and executive producer Stephanie Savage on Wednesday in West Hollywood to celebrate the 21st birthday of the fondly remembered program that signed off in 2007 after four seasons. A surprise musical guest at the event was the band Phantom Planet, who performed several tunes, including their single “California,” which was used as the show’s theme song.\n\n“It’s hard to believe that was 21 years ago,” Bilson told fans at the event. “And you know what I realized? I was 21 when we shot the pilot. I know — mind-blowing.”\n\nIn introducing Phantom Planet, Schwartz said, “It would not be The O.C. without this band. We’re thrilled that we were able to use their music on the show and thrilled that they’re here tonight.”\n\nAt the start of their set, the band’s lead singer, Alex Greenwood, expressed his appreciation for being a part of the series. “That it’s been 21 years is insane,” he said. “I feel like that just happened a month ago.”\n\nTequila brand 21Seeds, which sponsored the party, has partnered with Bilson, along with Fake Empire — the production company founded by Schwartz and Savage — for a campaign celebrating the actress’ character, Summer Roberts. Schwartz and Savage have more recently served as executive producers for such television series as Gossip Girl, Runaways and City on Fire.\n\nDebuting back on Aug. 5, 2003, The O.C. co-starred Peter Gallagher, Ben McKenzie, Mischa Barton, Adam Brody and Tate Donovan. The series followed wayward teen Ryan Atwood (McKenzie) moving into the pool house belonging to his attorney Sandy Cohen (Gallagher) and their family in tony Newport Beach."
