        "text": "Adam Brody was not afraid of commitment.\n\nThe 43-year-old actor first met his wife Leighton Meester in 2010 while filming The Oranges.\n\n“I was never scared of the idea of marriage or kids,” Adam said.\n\nKeep reading to find out more…\n\n“It always seemed, you know, like a route I would go eventually, and I was excited to when it, you know, when, when it came together, when I met the right person and, you know, my wife and I actually got married very fast after we started dating,” he told SiriusXM’s Jess Cagle. “That’s how sort of easy a decision it was for me and us.”\n\nAdam‘s character on The O.C., Seth Cohen ended up marrying Summer Roberts (Rachel Bilson) in the season 4 finale and he said he does see some similarities.\n\n“I think with the character of Seth, you know, I still, it’s easy to tap into that mindset. And also, you know, there’s other qualities too, I think, not just in terms of pure commitment and a relationship, but in terms of aging,” Adam said. “And so there was plenty of, you know, of similarities regardless of, you know, our difference in a marriage. But even that mindset was easy enough to think about it from the other side of the coin.”\n\nHe also explained that his character Seth Cohen sometimes reminded him of himself.\n\n“I mean I did a crime drama called StartUp it’s very adult and yet there were dynamics in it, which reminded me of Seth Cohen and, but I guess just some of that is cuz he reminds me of me, you know?” Adam said. “I am him, not exclusively or holy, but you know, there’s a lot of overlap.”\n\nAdam and Leighton got married in 2014 and their first child Arlo Day was born in 2015."
