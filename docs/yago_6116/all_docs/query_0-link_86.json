        "text": "It was surely Sandy Cohen's dream to turn his life into a musical, and now it's finally going to happen.\n\nThe OC will receive its own unofficial musical for one night only in Los Angeles next month, and the production has found its new all-singing versions of Ryan, Seth, Summer and Marissa.\n\nNashville actor Tilky Jones will appear as brooding Ryan Atwood, while theatre actress Molly McCook will play his on-off girlfriend Marissa Cooper.\n\nPretty Little Liars star Brendan Robinson takes on loveable geek Seth Cohen, while Awkward's Greer Grammer will play his future wife Summer Roberts.\n\nThe production previously announced that original OC star Autumn Reeser will play super-bitch Julie Cooper, The Flash's Rick Consett will play Sandy, Jersey Boys' Drew Seeley will be Luke Ward, Christine Larkin is Kirsten Cohen, and Buzzfeed editor Jarrett Wieselman is show creator Josh Schwartz.\n\nSadly, Jordan Ross and Lindsey Rosin's production will only be staged once at the Federal Bar on August 30.\n\nThe play will incorporate several memorable music moments from the show into a new reimagining of the pilot episode.\n\n\"You want to see the New Year's kiss and you want to see the Spider-Man kiss and you want to see Marissa dying - even though you all cried about it for weeks,\" said Ross. \"But it's hard to condense a legacy into an hour and 15 minutes or an hour and a half.\n\n\"So we decided to go back to that moment where they first fell in love with the show and in order to build on that, we use music from all four seasons. So even if that music moment that you loved in the series isn't in the show, you're going to feel it. A really good example is 'Champagne Supernova'.\n\n\"So you're not going to see the upside-down Spider-Man kiss because we're not doing that scene but you will feel that moment between Seth and Summer; it's sung by Seth and Summer, so you're going to get it.\"\n\nThe OC originally ran for four seasons from 2003 to 2007 on Fox.
