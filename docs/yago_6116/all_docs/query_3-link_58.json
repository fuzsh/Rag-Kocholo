        "text": "Last week was a great episode. But the big question is this..is Johnny REALLY dead or not? It would seem like he would be dead, but the previews of this episode make it seem like he is just severely hurt. Maybe we’ll get the news that he died during this episode or something. I hope so, because that would be a real bad move to not have him die after falling off a cliff.\n\nNow then it’s Valentine’s Day as well. Seth is in trouble and somehow that has to do with lingerie. Hey..who wouldn’t want to see Summer in that?!\n\nKaitlin is preparing to go back to school finally. She did her damage and I would hope to see her come back sometime later.\n\nFinally, Ryan helps some girl named Sadie. Um..are we supposed to know Sadie? I have never heard that name before. Is that a nickname for someone? I mean who is she and why are we supposed to know who she is? Oh..she has something to do with Volchok, but I swear I have not heard that name before. It’s all very confusing, but apparently it will make Ryan doubt his relationship with Marissa. About time I would say as she has been nothing but selfish.\n\nThis is the last new episode for a month. Why? It is because of the Olympics? I guess I could use a break from recapping the show for a month. Not from watching it, but from writing about it. But first we got to take care of this little episode. So I hope it doesn’t disappoint and continues the hot streak the show has been on recently. Lets find out…\n\nThe O.C. – Season Three (Episode 15) – “Heavy Lifting”\n\nWe open up to the foursome sitting in the living room. They are waiting for the news on Johnny. He is still in the hospital. Marissa can’t eat or sleep. And now it looks like he is in a coma as Sandy and Kirsten come in. Of course, another coma. They bring up Trey’s coma and Marissa’s overdose in Tijuana. And how they made it out okay. But Ryan says the doctors didn’t want them to get their hopes up, so it doesn’t look that good. He may not wake up. A call comes in and it’s Johnny’s mom. Ryan answers the phone. He gets the news and sees Marissa. It doesn’t look to be good as he goes to hug Marissa. She cries. Now Kaitlin wakes up and asks what happened? Yes..what happened?!\n\n“California…here we come…right back where we started from…California…here we come! Oh!!”\n\nWe come back to see Marissa walking up to Johnny’s house. Chili is there and he called and wanted her to come. Yep..Johnny is dead! They talk about the funeral. They say it would be too depressing. Maybe talk about doing it during the day and near the ocean instead.\n\nSeth and Ryan talk about what happened and Seth tells Ryan not to blame himself. He tried to save him.\n\nSeth: “Well I guess you don’t have to worry about Johnny coming between you and Marissa anymore…!”\n\n**EVIL LOOK FROM RYAN**\n\nSeth: “…Sudoku..fun to say and fun to do..Su..okay..too soon!”\n\nKirsten and Julie walk on the beach and they are planning a Valentine’s dance. They don’t know if it’s a good time now with the funeral. Dr. Roberts hasn’t asked Julie to a date yet for Valentine’s Day and she is worried that he is going with someone else. Sandy is not a big fan of the holiday either so Kirsten tells her not to worry. They just need to plan the dance and take care of their love lives later. Julie wants to go to Dr. Roberts house instead and snoop around.\n\nMarissa comes out of Johnny’s house and she runs into Sadie. That is Johnny’s cousin. Finally..we get all the answers! She came down to stay with Johnny’s mom. Sadie’s mom thought it would be a good idea. Sadie sees that Marissa is a little bummed and picks up on the fact that this is the infamous..Marissa Cooper. Sadie is glad to meet her.\n\nKaitlin answers her trailer door and it’s that guy Justin again. He came back to take Kaitlin back to school, but Kaitlin doesn’t think so. She wants him to leave. So leave stalker dude. Although, he seems to think they have a relationship..so who knows.\n\nSandy and Matt chat at the office. Sandy says the board is ready to start building, but he needs to meet with them one last time. He tells Matt not to lie this time around. Matt likes the daughter of the head of the board, so he won’t lie or so he says. He is about to leave, when Marissa comes in to shock them both. There is a lot of paperwork that Marissa has with Johnny’s death and stuff. Matt says he is the man for that job. He will take care of that.\n\nSummer comes into Seth’s room and he is doing something on his laptop. Seth hides it away. Summer wants to know what it is. She looks at his laptop.\n\nSummer: “That’s not porn!”\n\nSeth: “It’s a list of my Yakuza DVDs..sorted alphabetically by title and also by director. Making my inventories is sorta one of those things..kinda like masturbating or flossing my teeth..where eventhough you know I do it..I just rather you not witness it!”\n\nSummer says she found something in his drawer, though. It was the pot. He asks if she is mad? She is mad, but not about the pot. It’s the lying that she is mad about. He says he is sorry and he won’t do it again..the lying. But she doesn’t trust him anymore. So Seth has to find some way to get the trust back.\n\nRyan comes to see Marissa. That’s Kaitlin’s cue to leave. Kaitlin is upset as expected. Marissa gets a call and she thinks it’s Johnny’s mom. But it’s not.\n\nShe leaves and goes to meet Sadie at the diner. She called Marissa. Sadie just graduated from high school or so she says. Marissa would love to sit here and chat with her, but she needs to be with her boyfriend. Sadie is shocked to find out that Marissa has a boyfriend. Sadie thought that Johnny was Marissa’s boyfriend. Why would she think that? Well little Johnny called Sadie last week and asked her to make Marissa something for Valentine’s Day. It was a necklace with Johnny’s birthstone and Marissa’s birthstone and an angel in the middle. He thought it might be cheesy, but Marissa was Johnny’s angel to him..so that is why the angel was there.\n\nWe come back from a break to see that it’s time for the funeral. Everyone writes on a surfboard. The funeral is during the day near the ocean. Marissa, Chili, Ryan, Seth, and Summer are all there. Here comes Sadie and Johnny’s mom. Johnny’s mom looks at Marissa and she can’t look back at her. They pay their last respects to Johnny. Ryan grabs Marissa’s hand. Sadie now talks about the good times she had with Johnny. Oh..now we see Volchok in the background away from the funeral. He looks on. Trouble ahead. Now a couple of guys send the surfboard out to see. No body or anything. Just a surfboard..so it’s not too depressing.\n\nThe funeral is over and Ryan sees Volchok. Marissa sees Kaitlin off on the beach alone. Ryan goes to talk to her. Ryan wanted to know where she was. Kaitlin blames herself for Johnny’s death, but Ryan says she didn’t make him climb the rock or fall. Kaitlin tells Ryan that he made Johnny fall, which is a little retarded, but somewhat true. Ryan tries to help her. But Kaitlin walks away from him with this line.\n\nKaitlin: “You know what..Ryan..you can’t fix this. So just save the speeches for my sister..alright!”\n\nSandy and Matt finish playing basketball. Matt screwed things up with the daughter of the head of the board. He didn’t call her back, so she figured he wasn’t interested. Smooth move! Kirsten comes in. Sandy tells her about Matt’s troubles and Sandy wants Kirsten to invite the daughter of the head of the board to the dance. She thinks it won’t work. Matt says never mind. They will think of something else. Matt walks away but Kirsten makes a deal with Sandy. She will get her to the party, if Sandy embraces Valentine’s Day and gets her lingerie! But nothing red or see-through! Nice lingerie!\n\nSeth: “Death and Valentine’s Day..now there’s an unbeatable combination!”\n\nSeth and Ryan are up at the Bait Shop. Ryan says this is the first Valentine’s day where he and Marissa are actually together. Ryan is surprised to see Seth all in one piece after Summer found out about the pot.\n\nNow Summer and Marissa chat at the Bait Shop. Marissa and Ryan have no plans for Valentine’s Day yet, which shocks Summer.\n\nSummer: “Really?! It’s the first Valentine’s Day where you guys aren’t fighting or kissing another girl! This is special!”\n\nMarissa says Valentine’s Day might be cancelled this year as she is depressed about Johnny and his death.\n\nVolchok comes to talk to Sadie at the Bait Shop. He came to see how she was doing. She wants him to leave. Ryan comes in to see if there is a problem here. Volchok leaves. Ryan asks her if she knew him? And Sadie said she used to know him. Ryan introduces himself to Sadie. They talk about Johnny and Sadie’s family. Sadie has lost a lot of people close to her in her life. Ryan says sorry, but somehow Sadie knows that Ryan really means it. Marissa comes to drag Ryan away. And Sadie smiles as they walk away. Hmm…\n\nJulie is at Dr. Roberts’ house. Julie is looking for a cake knife at his house. She left it there. But she really wants to know what he is doing on Valentine’s Day. She doesn’t ask him that. He kinda tells her that he is staying in to read a book. HA! She is stunned. I smell a surprise coming! They say goodbye.\n\nJustin is waiting outside of the Cooper trailer for Kaitlin. He has a Valentine’s Day present for Kaitlin. It’s a bear. She could hug it or throw it at him and it won’t break. Justin asks if something is wrong. Kaitlin tells him about the whole Johnny story and his death. It was an accident, but Kaitlin said she let it happen. Justin tries to make sense of everything. His parents are therapists, so that’s why he makes sense or something. Kaitlin thanks him and Justin does a victory dance..thinking he is melting her cold heart. He gets busted by Kaitlin who sees him and calls him on it. She smiles.\n\nBack to the Cohen house. Everyone is there. Sandy is looking through a catalog that Kirsten gave to him. The items are marked and the sizes are circled for him. HA! Seth may have to look through that thing later.\n\nRyan and Marissa talk about Valentine’s Day. Marissa doesn’t want to do anything, but Ryan wants to do something. Marissa says that Ryan has NEVER liked Valentine’s Day before. It’s hard for Marissa now. Ryan says it’s hard for him too. Marissa says that Ryan doesn’t understand. But Ryan was there..just like her! He should understand just like her! Oh..bravo Ryan..bravo! Marissa decides to leave now. And we leave with her.\n\nWe come back to see Seth come into the pool house to talk to Ryan. Ryan said that he and Marissa had a good day yesterday. They were good..it wasn’t a good day with the funeral. Seth says that funerals make people do weird things. Give Marissa some slack. Ryan says Marissa said she didn’t want to see him today. Seth says that is not true. No girl wants to be alone on Valentine’s Day. Ryan asks him how he knows this?\n\nSeth: “Because inside my manly exterior..beats the heart of a 14-year old girl!”\n\nMatt comes knocking at the Cooper trailer and he has the paperwork done. Matt asks if she and Ryan are coming to the party tonight? Marissa says she started a fight..so she doesn’t think so. She was going to let Ryan cool off for a bit. Matt says he is here to help with whatever and leaves. Marissa walks back inside and picks up her phone to call Ryan. He doesn’t answer. She hangs up.\n\nKirsten talks with the daughter of the head of the board. She tries to get her to come to the party. But the woman knows who Kirsten is and knows Matt wants to go out with her again. She secretly likes Matt too and wants to go out with him again. Kirsten says that Matt regrets not calling her. So she tells Kirsten that she will go. Yay!\n\nSandy comes home with a Victoria’s Secret bag. He got the goods for Kirsten. Seth doesn’t want to talk about it, because that is his mom.\n\nSandy: “Women’s underwear has gotten very complicated..thongs, bikinis, briefs..who knew women’s panties was such a minefield!”\n\nSeth: “Don’t say panties!”\n\nSeth is busy drawing Summer a picture of a heart! HA! Seth sorta tells Sandy what happened without mentioning the pot thing or the interview thing. Sandy knows he lies and got caught in it. Summer may think of Seth as a man and not a kid says Sandy. Kids lie all the time, but a man is only as good as his word says Sandy. Seth says that Summer deserves a good man and Sandy says she has one. Seth asks where he is and how long he know about it. Joking, of course. Sandy is sure that Seth will show her.\n\nSadie is unloading some boxes. Ryan comes to help. Actually, he came to see Marissa, but decides to help Sadie first. Sadie doesn’t mind sharing “the heavy lifting”..you see..if it’s Ryan doing the helping. Hmmm…\n\nSandy gives Kirsten her Valentine’s Day gifts. Kirsten opens up her lingerie and it is pink. Not what she was expecting and Sandy said he didn’t buy that.\n\nOh..we go straight to Summer hitting Seth and seeing that the packages were switched. Summer got the black number that Kirsten was supposed to get. Summer doesn’t think the situation can be fixed with lingerie. Seth doesn’t think so either, even it is “VERY SEXY”. That’s what the tag says.\n\nSummer: “Our problem can’t be fixed with underwear..not even age-appropriate underwear with the right cup size!”\n\nSeth asks what he needs to do. Summer said he needed to come up with a revolutionary way to fix things and ROCK HER WORLD! She says Valentine’s Day is off. He says fine, but she didn’t see the card. He walks away and Summer looks at the card. It has a heart on it and over the heart is a picture of Pinocchio with Seth’s face on his body. He can not tell a lie and it says I love you inside. Genius!\n\nThe Cooper girls talk at the trailer. Kaitlin and Julie are going to the dance. They want Marissa to go too. She’s not in the mood. But look who comes to see her..it’s Ryan! Kaitlin and Julie leave. He wants her to go to the party. So maybe she will go after all. Ryan gives Marissa her present and it’s a necklace. She is happy about that. He wants her to go get dressed, but still no go. Ryan says they can hang out here. It’s been a long time since the two of them just hung out together. Marissa thinks Ryan means “without Johnny here to get in the way”. Marissa thinks Ryan is glad that Johnny is gone, but Ryan is not even going to answer that. He leaves. Marissa goes to her drawer and puts away Ryan’s present. She puts it next to Johnny’s present. We go to one last break!\n\nTime for the party/dance! Sandy and Seth come alone. They talk about the switch that took place. Ryan comes alone. Summer is here with Dr. Roberts, though. Sandy sees Matt and wonders if his date showed up. Seth has to go do something.\n\nWe see Kaitlin at the dance. Justin is there too. She sees him and he comes over to ask her to dance. She is not surprised to see him here. But seems happy that he is here now. They go off together.\n\nSeth comes over to Dr. Roberts and Summer. He wants to borrow Dr. Robert’s daughter for a second. She is right there, though. Just get to the point..Seth. And Seth gives Summer something he wrote on a napkin! It goes a little something like this:\n\nSummer: “To whom it may concern..My name is Seth Cohen and I have a problem with flying…!”\n\nSeth: “It says lying..the pen shook!”\n\nSummer: “…I’ve lied about many things over the years..the most recent and troubling lies include but are not limited to the following…”\n\nSeth: “There’s a complete list on the back of the napkin!”\n\nSummer: “Cohen..I know all of this!”\n\nSeth: “I know, but if I ever screw up again..you can give this to my parents!”\n\nTHAT is how you ROCK Summer’s world! She likes that idea! YES! She says she is wearing the thong that Seth gave her. That was his mom’s though. “EWWW” says Summer!\n\nMarissa finds Chili on the beach. He is wasted and says that they are the only two that know what they are going through. Right. Anyways he is not Chili anymore. He goes by his real name now, which is Dennis. Whatever. Marissa consoles him.\n\nBack at the party, Kaitlin informs Julie that she is going back to school. She is leaving Newport. Justin is giving her a ride. Justin says he will be a safe driver. Julie says okay, but she better come back. She will. Yay! They say goodbye.\n\nOh..there’s Dr. Roberts. Julie tells him not to explain. Dr. Roberts says that he lost his nerve and didn’t trust his instincts. He finally asks her to be his Valentine! She smiles.\n\nKirsten finds Ryan at the party and sees that he is alone. He and Marissa have been fighting a lot lately. Kirsten thinks that maybe Johnny was more than a friend to Marissa. Ryan says that she said that he was just a friend, but maybe she was just lying to herself. Kirsten suggests he goes and finds her. Ryan leaves.\n\nSandy comes over to talk with Kirsten. They see Matt and his date chatting it up. They are happy. They watch as the party begins to end.\n\nMarissa comes home to see Kaitlin packing. She makes amends with Kaitlin. Kaitlin tells her to figure out how she really felt about Johnny. Marissa thinks it doesn’t matter, but Kaitlin says it does matter. Marissa says she was glad that Kaitlin came home, though, and Kaitlin sorta believes her. They hug.\n\nRyan knocks on a door, but it’s not Marissa’s door. It’s Sadie’s! He left to come help Sadie pack up Johnny’s room or something. Interesting.\n\nJustin and Kaitlin drive back to school. Kaitlin is crying, which shocks Justin. Kaitlin says she is going to miss this place.\n\nWe go back to the party to see scenes with music, of course. YES! My favorite part of the show! Matt and his girl are dancing, Sandy and Kirsten are dancing, Julie and Dr. Roberts are dancing, and Seth and Summer are making out on the beach! JACKPOT baby! Marissa looks at the two necklaces again in her drawer. She takes out Johnny’s and looks at it. She begins to cry as she clutches it and lays down.\n\nMeanwhile, Ryan helps Sadie. He is thinking something and Sadie asks what it is. Ryan thinks about if there was anything he could have said to Johnny to save him. Sadie says no. Ryan was there for Johnny. And we can’t control life. We can only be there for our friends, even when we know they are making mistakes. There is a knock at the door. It’s Volchok. Sadie wants him to go or she will call the cops. Volchok knows she won’t do that. Ryan walks in and Volchok sees him. She slams the door in his face as Volchok asks what Ryan is doing there? Ryan looks out the window and sees Volchok. They stare each other down!\n\nAnd we are out until March 9th! CRAP! A whole month off!"
