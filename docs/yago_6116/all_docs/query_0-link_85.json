        "text": "Rachel Bilson knows that you still ship Seth Cohen and Summer Roberts from The O.C. She also knows you might still ship her and her costar Adam Brody, who dated offscreen too in 2006. And she's sorry for both relationships ending. Okay, she's not actually, like, sorry about the breakup itself. She just feels bad that fans were so messed up over it. (It's me. I'm \"fans.\")\n\nIn case you forgot, Bilson and Brody dated for three years while playing Seth and Summer. “It was a typical romance and they just grew apart,” a source told People after the breakup. “They've been on and off for a while now.”\n\nInStyle magazine decided now was the time to remind us all about one of the most iconic IRL TV ships ever, posting multiple old shots of the costar couple on Instagram on Tuesday, March 24. \"#rachelbilson and #adambrody's breakup basically ruined high school for us,\" InStyle's clearly O.C.-obsessed team wrote in the caption. No judgment. I am in full agreement with this post.\n\nWell, the hashtag did its job, and Bilson saw the post, responding in the best way possible. \"I'M SORRY,\" she said with four exclamation marks. Mm, what you say? That you only meant well? Well, of course, you did.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\n\"He fared really well,\" she added. They both did, to be honest. Bilson, who was married to actor Hayden Christensen from 2010 to 2017, is now dating Saturday Night Live alum and actor Bill Hader. Brody, on the other hand, has been with Gossip Girl's Leighton Meester since 2010. They married in 2014 and have one daughter, Arlo Day Brody, together. \"[Leighton and I are] big hand-holders,\" he told Glamour in 2019. \"Physical affection is very nice to me; it doesn’t necessarily have to be sexual.\"\n\nFine, I'm happy for them both. At least I'll always have this moment:"
