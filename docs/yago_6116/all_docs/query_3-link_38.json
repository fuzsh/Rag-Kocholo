        "text": "It’s official: We live in the age of reboots and revivals. From iconic ‘90s TV shows to nostalgic movies-turned-musicals, it seems as though, every day, all of our old faves are being brought back for one last hurrah.\n\nAhem. All of our old faves except one.\n\nThe O.C., which blessed our television screens from 2003 to 2007, continues to remain untouched. And, TBQH, we’re not entirely sure why. Even Rachel Bilson, who played Summer Roberts, has said she’d be down to do a revival, and that at least eight of her costars would probably join her. (Mischa Barton, however, said that a reboot “wouldn’t be right” for her character, but given Marissa Cooper’s fate at the end of season 3, that’s pretty fair.)\n\nBut putting the ghost of Coop aside for a second, there’s plenty of reasons why an O.C. reboot would be just the thing we all need this year. Grab a bagel, pull up a chair, and allow us to explain.\n\nLiterally every other show has gotten a reboot.\n\nI have patiently (not really) waited for Hollywood to finally recognize the value of a rebooted version of The O.C.. I’ve felt the pain of longing and disappointment, watching as shows like Gilmore Girls, Charmed, Roswell and even Bug Juice got their happy endings. Nostalgia is a major part of Hollywood, and if Ariana Grande can create an entire music video that was an homage of classic ‘90s films, someone out there can definitely revive The O.C..\n\nI need to know what happened to Anna Stern.\n\nI have spent 10 years of my life contemplating what happened to this fictional character. Is she happy back in Pittsburgh? Did she ever reunite with Seth? I have so many questions, and The O.C. never provided any answers. I can’t continue searching for another 10 years, I need closure, I need to move on.\n\nNot to mention Lindsay Gardner, Taylor Townsend, and Alex Kelly.\n\nWhere are they now? In a present-day O.C., would Taylor be running for local office and vying to become the first woman President of the United States? No doubt Lindsay and Alex would also be out there in the middle of it all, with Alex probably organizing protest concerts and Lindsay leading some sort of STEM program for young kids. (Right? Can’t you see it?)\n\nSpeaking of Alex...just imagine the potential Bait Shop musical guests.\n\nAs someone who based their entire musical taste around the rotating cast of musicians that played at The Bait Shop, I’m already envisioning the amazing modern-day musical talent that might be more than happily stop by. It’s not out of the question to imagine artists like Shawn Mendes, Hayley Kiyoko, or Alyson Stoner taking to the stage, and with so many television series relying on crossover events, perhaps Riverdale’s very own Josie McCoy could stop by for a special performance.\n\nSocial media would change everything — on and off the screen.\n\nCan you imagine all the O.C. characters with iPhones? We deserve to see what Seth Cohen’s Instagram account looks like, OK? Plus, maybe if Marissa and Ryan both had the “Find My Friends” app installed, they could have avoided at least 40% of that drama in Tijuana. Most importantly, just think of the live-tweeting opportunities...not to mention the endless amount of use we’d get out of those Summer “ew” gifs.\n\nIts outlandish plot would distract me from the world’s current garbage fire.\n\nEach week, I never knew what to expect from my favorite cast of Orange County, California residents. Throughout its four seasons, The O.C. went through numerous, unbelievable plots and characters. Remember Oliver? How about Rebecca? How about...all of season 4? Our own current IRL news cycle can prove to be a little bleak, but with a rebooted version of The O.C., we’d be able to escape all that, and instead spend just one hour in a seemingly idyllic paradise filled with a ridiculous amount of drama.\n\nAnd not just the drama...all the romance.\n\nCan you imagine The O.C. without the romance? You can’t, because the two cannot be separated. Despite the fact that Seth Cohen was an arguably sh*tty boyfriend (he literally sailed away without any notice remember?), it’s pretty undeniable that together, he and Summer were the definition of adorable. (Exhibit A: The Spider-Man kiss.) The O.C. gave us the ability to suspend belief every week and unabashedly swoon over one-liners like “Who are you? / Whoever you want me to be” — no matter how silly the love plotlines might seem in real life.\n\nOK, now imagine: Noah Centineo as Seth Cohen."
