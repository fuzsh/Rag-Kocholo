        "text": "Deep in the throes of Lockdown: Winter Edition as we are, TV is one of the only things offering a sense of blessed escapism.\n\nLast year we were spoiled with an off-season Love Island, but this year we’ve no such luck and many of our favourite binge-worthy series are behind filming schedule thanks to the entire world crashing to a halt last year when the pandemic first hit.\n\nEven Selling Sunset’s Christine Quinn has admitted that they hadn’t even STARTED filming for season four yet (boo, get in the bin).\n\nThe obvious choice, then, is to revisit some old favourites. And while ITVhub has recently added every episode of Love Island ever made to the platform and Netflix isn’t in a rush to drop any of its lockdown heavy hitters (Too Hot to Handle, anyone?) I’m looking even further back to have a rummage around in the archive of my childhood.\n\nThere’s something wholesome about re-watching old favourites as an adult, and eleven episodes deep into the teen drama classic, The OC, I’ve realised – this is probably the best show ever made.\n\nFor the first time in my adult life, the entire series is now available to stream (legally) in one place, with All 4 adding it to the platform in late January. And I’m genuinely looking forward to having an old friend to hang out with every evening after work, when I’m separated from my real ones by the current government restrictions. And for how long? With four glorious seasons to watch (American series being, on average, 423 episodes per season), it’s likely that my viewing commitment will postdate the pandemic, and I’m not even mad.\n\nWatching for the first time in years, it's difficult to describe the wave of dreamy nostalgia that came over me hearing the opening credits again (California by indie band Phantom Planet, a song so inspiring I was moved to download the entire album onto my iPod shuffle, and still know half the words to), and I continue to be utterly transported to early noughties Newport at the start of each episode – not that All 4 has a ‘skip intro’ option, anyway.\n\nThe million-dollar question at the time, of course – Ryan or Seth? I was all about Ryan Attwood, the brooding bad boy type from the wrong side of the tracks, the saviour of the poor little rich girl who has, even now, aged remarkably well.\n\nSeth Cohen was too much of a gangly nerd for me, tbh, but evidently during my teenaged years my SOH wasn’t developed enough to appreciate that actor Adam Brody’s comedic prowess made the series stand out against other teen dramas like, say, Gossip Girl – #sorrynotsorry – which had zero humour (he was, undoubtedly, the best actor of the young cast). I’ve even now realised that a lot of the tried and tested funnies I’ll use today were pulled directly from season one Seth’s lexicon. So, thanks Seth.\n\nNow I’m a grown up, I’m outrageously attracted to Sandy Cohen*, Seth’s social justice warrior Jewish father. It’s unusual, for the era it was made, for a character not to possess a hint of toxic masculinity, and in so many ways The OC has stood the test of time where others have been ruined through the lens of feminism (I mean, I’ll still WATCH Love Actually, I’m just not going to enjoy it, ok?). Despite initially seeing a yawn-worthy patriarchal high-school hierarchy to begin – with Marissa the property of her Water Polo-playing caveman boyfriend Luke, Summer the vapid best friend and Seth ostracized because he’s into sailing and comic books instead of soccer and sex – first impressions give way to impressive character development, even within the first few episodes.\n\n*Also, special shout out to Jimmy Cooper.\n\nCHECK OUT: The OC's most ICONIC cast - where are they now?\n\nGallery\n\nThe O.C - then and now slider\n\n1 of 26\n\nCREDIT: College Hill Pictures\n\nRyan Atwood/Ben McKenzie\n\nRyan Atwood was the troubled kid from Chino, the outsider in Newport who brought everyone together and launched four season's worth of California-grown TV gold.His on/off relationship with girl next door Marissa Cooper was the crux around which plenty of the drama revolved, and his brooding, bad-boy-gone good charisma and fierce loyalty earned him legions of teenaged girl fans.\n\n2 of 26\n\nCREDIT: Getty\n\nBen McKenzie/Ryan Attwood\n\nBen has been in his current role as Jim Gordon in Gotham since 2014, and prior to that starred as Ben Sherman in Southland for 43 episodes. He also dabbles in screenwriting and directing, making his directional debut on an episode of Gotham aired earlier this year. He married actress Morena Baccarin in 2017 after they became involved while she was still married to her first husband and fell pregnant with Ben's child.\n\n3 of 26\n\nCREDIT: College Hill Pictures\n\nMarissa Cooper/Mischa Barton\n\nMarissa Cooper was the beautiful, rich, popular girl next door who always needed saving – the perfect romantic match for perpetual savior Ryan. Drug and alcohol abuse, fighting with her family, and abusive boyfriends, Marissa went through it all, and fell from grace when she was expelled from Harbor School for shooting Ryan's brother Trey.Her self-destructive streak eventually caused her demise at the end of series three, when she died in Ryan's arms in a dramatic car accident.\n\n4 of 26\n\nCREDIT: Instagram\n\nMischa Barton/Marissa Cooper\n\nA true California girl, Marissa has recently signed up to a reality show inspired by The O.C, The Hills (a spin off of Laguna Beach, The Real Orange County). She's now starring along OG cast members Audrina Partridge, Justin Bobby and Stephanie Pratt. She's been consistently in the limelight since her time on the O.C as a socialite and fashion influencer as well as an actress, and in 2016 competed in America's answer to Strictly, Dancing with the Stars.\n\n5 of 26\n\nCREDIT: College Hill Pictures\n\nSeth Cohen/Adam Brody\n\nSeth Cohen was a loner at Harbour whose unrequited love for popular girl Summer Roberts was the stuff of high school nightmares – or indeed, teen dramas – when Ryan came along and changed his life. He eventually got the girl and made friends for life in Ryan and Marissa, without ever having to shed his nerd credentials.\n\n6 of 26\n\nCREDIT: Getty\n\nAdam Brody/Seth Cohen\n\nAdam Brody, who hasn't aged a day since his time on the show, is one of our favourite O.C success stories.After dating Summer Roberts actress Rachel Bilson in real life, he met his now wife Leighton Meester, who starred as Blair Waldorf in Josh Shwartz's other teen smash, Gossip Girl. The two share their daughter Arlo and son, who they are yet to announce his name. Careerwise, Adam's movie credits include productions like Lovelace and Jennifer's Body, as well as TV work in, among others, New Girl and House of Lies.

She was the interfering goody-two shoes intent on stealing Marissa's crown as the social chair and star student, despite her unlikeability. After Marissa's death, Taylor gradually became more intergral to the lives of Seth, Summer and particularly Ryan. By Chrismukkuh that year, she and Ryan were beginning to develop a romantic relationship, although Ryan never truly gets over Marissa.\n\n20 of 26\n\nCREDIT: Instagram\n\nAutumn Reeser/Taylor Townsend\n\nNow a mum of two, Autumn has expanded her acting repertoire to include theatre since joining The WorkJuice Players theatre troupe in 2006 playing Amelia Earhart in their popular production of The Thrilling Adventure Hour.She's also got plenty of film and TV credits under her name, including Star Trek, CSI and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.\n\n21 of 26\n\nCREDIT: College Hill Pictures\n\nKaitlin Cooper/Willa Holland\n\nKaitlin Cooper is the younger sister of Marissa and the only surviving daughter of Jimmy and Julie Cooper.

He's now a dad to two kids, and is still VERY HOT.\n\nWATCH: Emily Atack Talks Holiday Romances | My First Times\n\nSummer Roberts was initially written as a bit part, one-dimensional and unlikeable, the requisite sidekick to Marissa Cooper’s troubled – though outwardly charmed – life, but as soon as it became clear the character could form part of the core storyline (in part as the object Seth’s long-term love obsession which, I’ll admit, is slightly problematic in the cold light of 2021), her role became instantly more nuanced. Within the space of an episode or two, actress Rachel Bilson’s acting went from a two to a solid six, given the room to develop her character.\n\nThe early noughties was a strange time, on the cusp of the information age as we know it today, with attitudes toward sex, gender, sexuality, and racial diversity and representation feeling like much longer ago than two short decades. When Marissa loses her virginity to Luke and Ryan later makes a visit to her home, she tells him he’s “too late”, as if giving away her purity has left her in some way unviable. When Luke – a caricature of what we now call toxic masculinity – learns that his dad has been having an affair with a man, he immediately loses his status as a big name on campus, with all the obvious slurs thrown about in abundance. But the storyline gives way to exploration of the issues which feels modern for its’ time, where, despite the outward hostility from peripheral characters, Luke learns to check his prejudice; his father, Carson, is not just gay, but a rounded character who struggles deeply with the pain he’s caused his family.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nThe OC original cast - where are they now?\n\nGogglebox: 20 things you didn't know about the hit show\n\nHome and Away's ICONIC cast – then and now\n\nIn one episode where Ryan goes to visit his older brother Trey in prison in his hometown of Chino, Sandy – his newly assigned legal guardian – hands him his flip phone, to use “in case of emergencies”. The fact that a (purportedly) 17-year-old Ryan wouldn’t have his own phone sums up why this show, for me, is the ultimate in nostalgic watching. It really doesn’t feel that long ago that I was watching it, imagining myself living that life, being able to fully immerse myself in the world of a series that grown-up responsibilities and the permanent tech at my fingertips would never allow these days – seriously, when was the last time you watched a series without scrolling?\n\nIt’s the sweet-spot in the personal history of my life – recent enough to remember, but long enough ago that there’s a sense of fascination in watching it, like it’s history, like it’s another world. Which I suppose, while I’m still stuck within the four walls of my flat in North London, with the snow (if you can even call it that) still coming down, it is."
