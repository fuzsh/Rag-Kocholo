        "text": "I’m rather late on the OC/Gossip Girl bandwagon, and though there are countless blog posts circling the internet comparing the two, I have decided to write my own. The OC and Gossip Girl are two of the most acclaimed TV shows of the past decade. Both set in affluent communities in which the drama surrounds opulent yet corrupt characters, the shows have many overlaps as they were created by the same director, Josh Schwartz. Which of the two is the better of the archetypal TV dramas?\n\nSimilarities and Differences in Characters\n\nSerena Van Der Woodsen, Gossip Girl Marissa Cooper, The OC\n\nThere are distinct similarities between Marissa and Serena: their looks (tall, slim and blonde, though Marissa is lithe and willowy unlike Serena), notorious party-girl reputation, sporadic drug and alcohol abuse, relationships with their mothers characterised by rebellion and miscommunication and a troubled background stemmed from their parents’ own predicaments and adversity. However, Marissa has potential to become successful and in control of her life, despite her relapses into alcoholism and debilitating low self worth. We never get to see how she makes use of her potential as she dies age 18 in season three. Serena, on the other hand, is inherently ignorant and rather boring, which doesn’t reflect on her eventual success in season six.\n\nSummer Roberts, The OC Blair Waldorf, Gossip Girl\n\nBlair and Summer likewise are similar characters. They’re both brunette and significantly shorter than their overshadowing best friends, loyal, intelligent and have their fictional favourites- Blair attempting to mirror Audrey Hepburn and Summer obsessed with the fictional show The Valley. Neither of them have struggled with alcohol or drug abuse, and only rarely are depicted drinking alcohol. However, their relationships with their mothers are different. Blair’s mother doesn’t pay much attention to Blair but when she does, she controls Blair’s diet to the extent that Blair succumbs to her compulsive bulimic urges. Summer’s mother left her at the age of 13 and she doesn’t have a relationship with her stepmother.\n\nThough the four characters seem to be split into two groups, there are resemblances between Blair and Marissa; and Summer and Serena, too. Both Marissa and Blair are driven by their insecurity and lack of self-worth, tending to feel ignored, isolated and belittled. Serena and Summer garner more positive attention from the other characters, due to their outgoing and extroverted character. The four actresses do their characters justice; however, Leighton Meester, who portrays Blair, has garnered the most recognition and acclaim for her competent acting and portrayal of the multi-faceted character. Summer and Blair are my favourites as they have more depth than would superficially suggest and pursue their passions with ambition.\n\nRyan Atwood, The OC Nate Archibald, Gossip Girl\n\nSeth Cohen, The OC Dan Humphrey, Gossip Girl\n\nChuck Bass, Gossip Girl\n\nThe main male cast has a lot less in common than the female one does. Dan Humphrey and Seth Cohen undoubtedly look alike, though Dan’s and Ryan’s backgrounds are more similar. They both came from a poorer community (Dan from Brooklyn, Ryan from Chino) and attract the attention of troubled ‘it girls’ Marissa and Serena (Ryan upon arrival, Dan during Junior year). They both also have a propensity for violence under certain circumstances. Aside from that, the male cast is unique in terms of both shows. Seth is a socially awkward nerd who is the adoptive brother of Ryan Atwood and love interest of Summer; Ryan an introverted, protective outsider who falls in love with Marissa; Nate the boring, “golden boy” of the Upper East Side; Dan a pretentious writer who eventually marries Serena and Chuck, the sociopathic yet charismatic love interest of Blair. Seth and Ryan are my favourite characters as their friendship is the most promising plot on the show and is characterised by constant humour and loyalty.\n\nLily Van Der Woodsen-Bass-Humphrey, Gossip Girl Julie Cooper-Nichol, The OC\n\nJulie and Lily, mothers of Marissa and Serena, respectively, have much in common. They both struggle with their turbulent relationships with their daughters, and have betrayed and lied to them on several occasions. For example, Julie has an affair with Marissa’s ex-boyfriend in season one, and Lily put Serena’s boarding school “boyfriend” in jail (for allegedly raping her) to get Serena back into private school in season four. They have also had several marriages and have been unfaithful to most of their previous partners. Both of their family issues are arguably due to their rocky relationships with their own parents, as Julie no longer has relations to her parents and Lily’s were demanding and overly controlling. Julie is my favourite of the two as her vulnerability and soft side emerges as the show progresses and it’s apparent that she has changed from malicious and self-centred to remorseful, selfless and always a source of entertainment.\n\nJenny Humphrey, Gossip Girl Kaitlin Cooper, The OC\n\nThe two rebellious younger characters from the shows, Jenny and Kaitlin are both the younger sisters of main characters; Jenny is Dan’s younger sister and Kaitlin is Marissa’s. Both characterised by defiance and rebellion, we’ve watched them both grow up from young and demure teenagers (though Kaitlin was 11 in the first season and Jenny 14) to provocative and attention-seeking. They often feel overshadowed by their older siblings’ success, much like Jenny was payed a lot less attention than Dan and Kaitlin dismissively sent off to boarding school, arguably so that their parents could focus more on Marissa. This leads them to having affairs with their older siblings’ friends, such as Jenny dating Nate and Caitlin having an affair with Johnny, a friend of Marissa’s in season three. Due to their being ignored, they resorted to rebellion and disobedience to garner attention from their family and peers. For example, Jenny feels that her talent is being exploited at her internship with Blair’s mother, so creates her own line and crashes Lily’s award ceremony with a “guerilla fashion show.” Kaitlin, on the other hand, leaves boarding school once rumours start circling about her, attends elite clubs (though she’s six years underage), smokes marijuana and gives some to Seth, commencing his short-term intake of the drug. Though Kaitlin is also somewhat defiant and rebellious, I prefer her over Jenny as Jenny had been corrupted and depraved by the inequity and classism of the Upper East Side.\n\nCaleb Nichol, The OC Bart Bass, Gossip Girl\n\nCaleb and Bart are very similar characters: both extremely opulent, self righteous and egotistical. Caleb Nichol is said to “own Newport Beach”, similarly Bart Bass and his company provide a lot of employment and he possesses the power on the Upper East Side. They are also untrusting and have kept close tabs on their wives; Caleb hiring professionals to follow and frequently cross-examine Julie Cooper and Bart Bass hiring private investigators to not only follow his wife, but her children. Also known for providing money in order to bribe others, their enemies have become privy to family secrets and are payed to stay quiet. As Caleb and Bart are essentially the same kind of people, I don’t prefer one over the other.\n\nThemes Explored\n\nThe most prevalent themes explored in both The OC and Gossip Girl are social class, alienation, sexuality, virginity, culture-shock, alcoholism, drug addiction, insecurity, death and acceptance of loss. Both the settings of the Upper East Side and Newport Beach are characterised by classism and hierarchy which leads to the ‘outsiders’ feeling alienated. A subtle example of the hierarchy symbol at work is the ‘steps of the Met’; Blair sits at the top steps of the museum and orders that her friends sit below her, suggesting that she thinks herself superior. Some characters who deal with alcohol abuse are Serena, Marissa and Kirsten. Marissa’s demise at the end of season three had an immense impact on the characters, which is most closely examined in the Chrismukkah episode in season four. Ryan and Taylor are in a coma and enter into an alternative universe in which Marissa passed away three years prior in Tijuana, reflecting the episode in season one. Once Ryan wakes up, he reads a letter addressed to him from Marissa and finally lets go of her and of his past. In Gossip Girl, Chuck’s father Bart ‘dies’ in season two which leaves emotional repercussions on Chuck. He retreats back into alcohol abuse but never properly accepts his loss. In season five it is revealed that Bart Bass didn’t actually die, and after continually emotionally harassing Chuck, Chuck lets him die in the penultimate episode of the show and finally lets him go.\n\nMarissa exploring a lesbian relationship Blair sitting alone in her low self worth\n\nSerena sitting alone at a bar Minutes after Marissa’s demise, parallel of similar scene in Tijuana\n\nSo Which Show Do I Prefer?\n\nThere’s no doubt that I prefer The OC by far. What I love about it is the indicative nature of its era, the comedy, the realistic drama, the characters and the music. It’s set in the early 2000s and it’s clear- the fashion and trends conjure images of the that time. The drama is a lot more realistic than Gossip Girl, and even though it can be melodramatic, it’s something I indulge in. The characters are unique and are so multi-faceted, my favourites being Seth, Sandy, Summer, Julie and Taylor. An element that all of my favourite shows share is the comedy, and none of the episodes have ceased to provide me with joy and laughter. Finally, the soundtrack of the OC is unique- indie rock as opposed to the typical hip hop background music that heightens scenes of other TV shows. The OC is my favourite show, as well as many other people’s favourites, and though Gossip Girl is similar it doesn’t compare to the classic teen drama that is The OC."
