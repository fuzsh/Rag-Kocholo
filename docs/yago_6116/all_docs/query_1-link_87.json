        "text": "Rachel Bilson has reflected on how The OC transformed her life and career.\n\nThe actress starred for four seasons as Summer Roberts in The OC, which became a cultural phenomenon upon its premiere in 2003.\n\nBilson recently explained to Cosmopolitan UK that she had little awareness of The OC's impact until the show came to an end in 2007.\n\n\"I didn't have any idea how much The OC would change my life,\" she said, adding: \"I thought I knew everything, but now I look back and think, 'You were a dumb-ass! What was your problem?'\"\n\nThe 31-year-old star also offered her thoughts on where The OC's beloved married couple Summer Roberts and Seth Cohen (Adam Brody) would be in 2013.\n\n> The OC turns 10: Five reasons why we still love it in 2013k\n\n\"Well, they got married [in the finale] and that was supposed to be a future episode,\" she said. \"They're probably still married in the OC.\n\n\"What do they even do? I don't even know. Did I graduate college? I don't even know. He writes comic books and she... runs a charity organisation for... trees.\"\n\nHer OC co-star and former boyfriend Brody said last year that he would be open to a reunion episode in the future.\n\nBilson's current series Hart of Dixie returns on Monday, October 7 at 8/7c on The CW."
