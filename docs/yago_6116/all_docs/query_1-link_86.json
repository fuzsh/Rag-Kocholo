        "text": "Blair Waldorf is marrying Seth Cohen.\n\nI repeat.\n\nBLAIR WALDORF IS MARRYING SETH COHEN.*\n\nTHIS IS THE BIGGEST NEWS EVER, because the it means that the worlds of The O.C. and Gossip Girl, two of the most seminal television shoes of my generation, are finally colliding. I can officially die happy.\n\nFor those of you living under a rock for the last decade, Seth and Blair are the king and queen of the Josh Schwartz teen drama universe.\n\nSeth, albeit on first appearance the geeky second fiddle to Ryan Atwood’s leather cuff wearing brooding protagonist, was the driving force behind the wit, humor, and emo-laden indie music soundtrack that made The O.C. a tour de force in the mid-2000s. Seth is the guy whose best friend was a plastic horse named Captain Oats (I swear it was much more charming than it sounds), who coined the term Chrismakkuh, who perfectly summarized the insanity that was the Cohen-Atwood-Roberts-Cooper family tree when he said “It’s a tale as old as time. Boy meets girl, boy likes girl, boy finds out girl is surrogate mom’s illegitimate step-mother,” who provided his girlfriend with a “Seth Cohen Starter Park” that included The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay and The Goonies and who might just be a stunning satire of Canada. In short, Seth totally stole the show and is awesome.\n\nBlair, albeit on first appearance the constant runner-up to Serena Van Der Woodsen’s cleavage-blessed protagonist, was similarly the driving force behind the wit, humor, and preppy-based fashion that made Gossip Girl a tour de force in the early 2010s. This is the girl who is responsible for the power headband fashion trend, deporting Georgina Sparks to Russia, making the Met steps a status symbol, turning Chuck Bass into a good person, and stating the obvious truth that “it’s so hard finding obedient minions.” In short, Blair is everything that I want to be and is awesome.\n\nWith the union of Blair and Seth and their mutual love of Thanksgiving, everything is FINALLY right in the world. I’ve been waiting for this moment since Blair said, with respect to Serena, “I’m sick of always looking like Darth Vader next to sunshine Barbie.” If that Star Wars reference wasn’t a mating call specifically meant for Seth Cohen, then I don’t know what is.\n\nOf course, this blessed event leaves me with SO many questions. Will Dorota be the maid of honor? Will Ryan Atwood be the best man? Will Captain Oats be present? Will he bring Princess Sparkles as his date to the wedding or will she refuse to attend out of loyalty to Summer Roberts, who was, after all, Seth’s first wife? Will the ghosts of Bart Bass and Marissa Cooper haunt their blessed union? Will Little J finally realize that the model who destroyed her fashion line was actually Kaitlyn Cooper? Will Blair walk down the aisle while Rufus Humphreys plays an acoustic cover of a song by The Shins on the mandolin?\n\nJust imagine the dorky law and Judaism conversations that Blair’s stepfather Cyrus and Seth’s dad Sandy will have at the reception! Kirsten Cohen and Lily Van Der Woodsen will drink the place out of Chardonnay in under an hour! Taylor Townsend and Neli Yuki will finally be united, which means that they will assuredly plot to take over the universe together, because they went to the Sorbonne and Yale and were smarter than all of the rest of those kids and its about time someone noticed!\n\nI, for one, could not be happier that Blair finally heard those “three words, eight letters” that she was always waiting for and that it was from Seth Cohen.\n\nMazel Tov!\n\n* Okay, fine, perhaps technically it is Leighton Meester and Adam Brody who are engaged, but whatever.\n\nIt’s an age-old question: Does art imitate life or does life imitate art?\n\nNo one illustrates the Aristoltelian mimesis debate better than Blake “Serena van der Woodsen” Lively and Leighton “Blair Waldorf” Meester.\n\nBlair and Serena are the best frenemies television has ever seen. They love hard and they fight even harder. Blair undisputedly has the market cornered on brains, ambition, leadership, and fashion sense. But, yet, every time, Serena always comes out on top with everyone looking at her lovingly.\n\nGranted Blair did some serious scheming and took down more than one socialite, but, when it came to dastardly deeds, Serena was the ultimate. A drunk Serena took the virginity of her best friend Blair’s long-term boyfriend Nate. Knowing that Yale was Blair’s lifelong dream school, Serena sabotaged Blair’s application, was accepted into Yale while Blair was not, and then didn’t even go to Yale. Serena gave Blair her blessing to date Dan, but then, despite that, Serena destroyed that budding relationship and Blair’s life by publishing Blair’s diary to the entire world. And, as if that wasn’t enough, then Serena slept with Dan.\n\nIn addition to her crimes against Blair, Serena KILLED someone. Serena had an innocent teacher locked away in prison as a sex offender for years. And, Serena got high and passed out on Metro North. All of those, individually, are unforgivable offenses. Yet, somehow, because she’s Serena, everyone just rolled with it.\n\nEveryone, especially Blair, always forgave Serena. She was always up on a pedastol while Blair always played her lady-in-waiting even though, for a brief moment, Blair was actually royalty. In the end, Serena married Dan in Blair’s apartment in a room full of her closest friends and family, all of whom she had done unspeakable things to on multiple occasions. And, yet, there they were gazing at her adoringly as she glided down the stairs above them.\n\nWHAT?!\n\nHas there ever been such an untouchable golden girl?\n\nThings out in the real world aren’t much different. Blake Lively, who played Serena van der Woodsen, and Leighton Meester, who played Blair Waldorf, are stuck in the same paradigm as their characters. Both women are stunningly beautiful. Both women are talented actresses. Yet, even though she hustles her ass off, Leighton just can’t catch a break while Blake is one adorable bungle away from accidentally wandering into a room and having an Oscar with her name on it fall into her lap.\n\nBefore being cast in Gossip Girl, both Blake and Leighton were working actresses. Blake was one of the four leads in the adorable movie The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, while Leighton was working the guest role circuit and had been on a pile of shows, including Crossing Jordan, 8 Simple Rules, 7th Heaven, Veronica Mars, 24, House, and Entourage. They were on fairly equivalent footing coming into the show.\n\nBut then everything changed.\n\nAs a highly promoted lead CW actress on a teen drama, Blake Lively’s career trajectory should have involved a reality show on Oxygen, a downward drug-fueled spiral, or, at best, another role on a Josh Schwartz show.\n\nBut, no, Blake landed a prominent role in Ben Affleck’s critically acclaimed movie The Town, a co-starring role in the Green Lantern alongside Ryan Reynolds, and a role in Oliver Stone’s The Savages. I know she’s got an outstanding rack and great hair, but really?! How do you go from a CW teen drama to working with multiple oscar winners and a summer action blockbuster?\n\nAs if that’s not enough, in 2011 Blake was featured in Time magazine’s 100 influential people issue with a write up by Baz Luhrman. Again, really?!\n\nAnd, in what may be her ultimate coup de grace to every other woman on the planet, Blake married Ryan Reynolds after meeting him on the set of The Green Lantern while he was still married to Scarlett Johansson. Yes, think about that. Blake and Ryan meet on set in early 2010. By the end of 2010, Ryan and ScarJo are divorced. By 2012, Blake and ScarJo are married, holed up in a multimillion dollar “cottage” in upstate New York, and living a life of domestic bliss.\n\nDoes this sound familiar?\n\nTHIS IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED WITH ANGELINA JOLIE, BRAD PITT, AND JENNIFER ANISTON! You know, that huge scandal that made millions around the world hate Angelina Jolie and created a bazillion tabloid covers. But, yet, even though Scarlett Johansson is a much bigger celebrity than Jennifer Aniston, no one noticed.\n\nBlake Lively got absolutely no shit for that. NONE. She just tossed her blond hair, flashed her charismatic smile, and all was forgiven.\n\nAnd, in the other corner, we have Leighton Meester.\n\nOnce on Gossip Girl, Leighton went full-throttle with her career. She landed a role in Country Strong alongside Oscar winner Gwenyth Paltrow, but, despite good reviews for Leighton, the movie was a flop. Since then, she’s been relegated to critically denigrated horror films starring other former CW stars and Selena Gomez flicks for tweens. Oh, and That’s My Boy. I get why she did that movie since it starred both Adam Sandler and Andy Samberg, but, as is evidenced by its 8 Golden Raspberry Award nominations and the fact that I could not sit through it despite my undying love of Blair Waldorf and The Lonely Island, it was one of the worst comedies ever written.\n\nAnd then there’s Leighton’s personal life. While Blake was skipping around potentially seducing her married co-stars without nary a tabloid witch hunt, Leighton was all over the tabloids because she was embroiled in a nasty legal battle driven by her mother’s attempt to extort millions of dollars from her. And, while Blake is filming spots for Vogue from her country mansion with her movie-star husband, Blair’s been quietly dating The O.C. star Adam Brody while making coffee runs in Encino in cut-offs.\n\nNow, none of this is to downgrade everything that Leighton has accomplished. She has managed to parlay her teen drama fame into a movie career and a happy relationship with a cool indie movie star LA boyfriend. That is way above and beyond anything that nearly all of the other young CW stars have been able to pull off. What are Chace Crawford and Ed Westwick doing these days?\n\nBut, its unbelievable that there is such a chasm between Leighton and Blake. They came from the same place. They were doing the same thing. And, in a lot of ways, Leighton was working harder and doing it better, especially on Gossip Girl where her delivery of cutting one-liners was impeccable. She carried that show. But, yet, somehow Blake/Serena always manages to come out on top.\n\nDid being cast as the untouchable golden girl Serena van der Woodson cause Blake Lively’s life to become just as golden? Or was Blake Lively cast as Serena van der Woodsen because she was actually an untouchable golden girl? Now that’s a conundrum for Aristotle to ponder for the next several thousand years.\n\nBut, whether its life imitating art or art imitating life, one thing is for sure. Any way you slice it, everything in Blake “Serena van der Woodsen” Lively’s life will always be coming up Milhouse."
