        "text": "Once Upon a Mattress makes a Broadway return with a new revival at the Hudson Theatre, officially opening August 12 after beginning previews July 31. The 18-week limited run is set to continue through November 30. The production comes to the Main Stem via New York City Center Encores!, and with much of the cast from that run earlier this year.\n\nAmong those returning are two-time Tony winner Sutton Foster as Princess Winnifred, along with Michael Urie as Prince Dauntless, Nikki Ren√©e Daniels as Lady Larken, David Patrick Kelly as King Sextimus the Silent, and Kara Lindsay as the standby for Princess Winnifred. New for the Broadway bow are Ana Gasteyer as Queen Aggravain, Will Chase as Sir Harry, Daniel Breaker as the Jester, and Brooks Ashmanskas as the Wizard.\n\nThe ensemble includes Daniel Beeman, Wendi Bergamini, Taylor Marie Daniel, Cicily Daniels, Ben Davis, Oyoyo Joi, Amanda LaMotte, Michael Olaribigbe, Adam Roberts, Jeffrey Schecter, Darius Wright, and Richard Riaz Yoder. Swings Sheldon Henry and Sarah Michele Lindsey round out the company.\n\nThe revival is offering $45 rush tickets via the TodayTix app, with the tickets going up for sale at 9 AM on the day of each performance. Rush tickets are also available in-person at the Hudson Theatre box office when it opens at 10 AM. There is a limit of two rush tickets per person, subject to availability.\n\nFree tickets and other prizes will be offered at a weekly \"Princess Test,\" held at the Hudson's box office each Thursday evening two hours prior to curtain time.\n\nFeaturing a book by Jay Thompson, Dean Fuller, and Marshall Barer; music by Mary Rodgers; and lyrics by Barer, Once Upon a Mattress is a comedic retelling of the Hans Christian Andersen fairytale The Princess and the Pea. The musical, which premiered Off-Broadway in 1959, launched the career of Carol Burnett, who starred in the work's original Off-Broadway and Broadway bows along with a string of live TV productions. The musical has since become a favorite at high schools and theatre groups around the world. This revival features a book adaptation penned by Amy Sherman-Palladino (Gilmore Girls).\n\nRead reviews for the Encores! run here.\n\nFollowing the Broadway run, Foster and Urie (further casting is to be announced) will take the revival to Los Angeles' Ahmanson Theatre via Center Theatre Group, with performances beginning December 10 and continuing through January 5, 2025.\n\nAlso back from the Encores! production is director Lear deBessonet. She's reassembled much of her Encores! creative team, including choreographer Lorin Latarro; scenic designer David Zinn; costume designer Andrea Hood; sound designer Kai Harada; hair, wig, and makeup designer J. Jared Janas; and physical comedy and effect designer Skylar Fox. New for the Broadway bow is lighting designer Justin Townsend. Cody Renard Richard is production stage manager, and casting is by The Telsey Office's Craig Burns.\n\nThe transfer has also elected to use orchestrations by Bruce Coughlin, who scored the work's 1996 Broadway revival. Encores! Music Director Mary-Mitchell Campbell serves as music supervisor, with Annbritt duChateau as music director and Kimberlee Wertz as music coordinator.\n\nThe revival is the eighth Encores! production to play the Main Stem, following earlier transfers of Chicago, The Apple Tree, Gypsy, Finian's Rainbow, After Midnight, Violet (which originated as a New York City Center Encores! Off-Center production, also starring Foster), and Into the Woods. A 2000 Encores! concert of Wonderful Town also inspired a full Broadway revival in 2003.\n\nSeaview, Creative Partners Productions, Jenny Gersten & Halfzip Production, and Hugo Six are producing alongside co-producers Cohen-Gutterman Productions, Bob Boyett, Stephen Byrd, Kate Connova, Pam Hurst-Della Pietra & Stephen Della Pietra, Nicole Eisenberg, LD Entertainment, Jay & Mary Sullivan, Richard Batchelder & Brady Brim-DeForest, Sharon Azrieli, Adam Cohen, Steve Peters, Trafalgar Entertainment, Dennis Trunfio, Mark Weinstein, Acton Carter Deignan Willman Productions, Crumhale Taylor Productions, Jamie deRoy & Paula Kaminsky Davis, Howard Overby Rubin Fink Productions, Under The Mattress, and New York City Center. Sue Wagner, John Johnson, and Jillian Robbins are executive producers."
