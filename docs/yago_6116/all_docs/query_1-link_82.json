        "text": "Newlyweds Adam Brody and Leighton Meester have made their first public appearance together since tying the knot.\n\nThe couple looked dashing as they walked the red carpet at the Tony Awards, for the first time as husband and wife.\n\nThe hotties - who co-starred in 2011 romantic-comedy The Oranges - went public with their relationship in February 2013, and began planning their nuptials after The OC actor popped the question in November 2013.\n\nAdam, most famous as character Seth Cohen , and Leighton, of Blair Waldorf fame from hit TV show Gossip Girl , rarely make public appearances and haven't been spotted together since that \"intimate, secret\" wedding in February.\n\nThe actor has come a long way since his time as the nerdy curly-haired charmer from California.\n\nWith its brilliant theme music, enormous mansions and ridiculously beautiful stars, The O.C. kept most of our teen-selves well entertained from 2003-2007.\n\nThe show introduced us to the festive celebration known as Chrismukkah and morphed our iTunes library into what's essentially a TV series soundtrack.\n\nBut since Summer married Seth and the Cohens moved back to Berkeley, what have all the stars of the show been up to?\n\nRachel Bilson (Summer Roberts)\n\nRachel, who we were first introduced to as stereotypical posh rich kid Summer, is pregnant with her first child with Hayden Christensen.\n\nThe 32-year-old actress admitted last year she was keen to start a family with the Star Wars actor.\n\nShe said: \"I definitely have family on the brain. Having kids is something I want to see in my future - I hope.\"\n\nRachel and Hayden, 33, met in 2007 on the set of Jumper and got engaged a year later However, they called off their engagement in August 2010 but reconciled three months later.\n\nBen McKenzie (Ryan Atwood)\n\nIt was hard not to love bad boy Ryan Atwood from the first second we laid eyes on him, but what has he been up to since The O.C. put him on the acting map?\n\nHe's since starred in a string of feature films, including Johnny Got His Gun. He featured in TV series Southland and will star in big screen blockbuster Gotham.\n\nRumours are rife he recently got married in secret.\n\nMischa Barton (Marissa Cooper)\n\nBritish born actress Misha played the troubled Marissa Cooper.\n\nIt all went off the rails in real life in 2007 when Misha joined Lohan, Bynes and Brian Boswell in the' Disney stars who have mug shots' group.\n\nFollowing her arrest Misha did a stint in rehab. But that didn't get her clean, and in 2009 Mischa was admitted to a psych ward under an involuntary hold by her worried parents.\n\nThe scary episode forced her to get healthy again, but even that led to criticism: \"I was under enormous pressure. It was always, 'She's too skinny, she must be sick.' Then it was, 'She's too big.' I was never the right weight.\"\n\nAdam Brody (Seth Cohen)\n\nSadly Adam and Rachel never did end up together - but he did end up with Rachel look alike Leighton Meester.\n\nThe pair first sparked marriage rumours in February after 34-year-old (!) Adam was spotted wearing a wedding band.\n\nSince then the couple have officially tied the knot and made their first public appearance together as husband and wife at the Tony Awards.\n\nCam Gigandet (Kevin Volchok)\n\nScary Volchok went onto play an even scarier character in Twilight alongside Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart.\n\nThe actor has two children with his long-term love Dominique Geirsendorff.\n\nSamaire Armstrong (Anna Stern)\n\nThe pretty actress went on to appear in more US TV shows, but in October 2007 it's reported she entered an \"outpatient facility\".\n\nHer publicist at the time said she \"decided to enter an outpatient facility to deal with some personal issues in a therapeutic atmosphere and is doing very well.\"\n\nShe gave birth to a baby boy in late 2012.\n\nLogan Marshall Green (Trey Atwood)\n\nHunky actor Logan starred in TV series Dark Blue as Dean Bendis, and as Charlie Holloway in the 2012 Ridley Scott film Prometheus.\n\nHe married wife Diane in 2013 and has two adorable children."
