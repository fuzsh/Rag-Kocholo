        "text": "Grew up… in Newport Beach, Calif. Seth’s childhood was as good as it gets, which is perhaps why he turned out to be such a well-adjusted, kind and smart teenager. The only thing Seth lacks is a group of close friends.\n\nLiving… with his parents in Newport Beach. Seth’s life revolves around comic books, school and video games. Before he met Ryan, his new best friend, Seth was good at finding things to occupy himself with. Now Ryan has moved in with the Cohen family because he was kicked of his own place in hardscrabble Chino by his alcoholic mother. It’s really shaken up Seth’s life for the better.\n\nInterests… comic books, old movies and anything related to science fiction. Seth isn’t used to life outside of his own little world. When he begins to make friends he claims to have a difficult time adjusting to Newport’s social scene. “I’m just having an allergic reaction to the universe,” he says.\n\nRelationship Status… single, but Seth is a dreamer when it comes to women. He’s had a longtime crush on Summer Roberts, one of the popular girls at The Harbor School. It took a lot of guts for Seth to approach Summer, but when he did, he went big: “It’s always been you, Summer. It’s just always been you. I tried to fight it and I tried to deny it. And I can’t, I can’t do it, you’re undeniable.”\n\nChallenge… breaking out of his loner lifestyle and making some friends. Before Ryan came to Newport, it was just Seth and his comic books. With Ryan there to help him out of his shell, Seth is riding along with the new guy’s popularity."
