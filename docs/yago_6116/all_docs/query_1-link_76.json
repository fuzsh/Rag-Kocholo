        "text": "Rachel Bilson was briefly reunited with her on-screen love Adam Brody more than a decade after the pair ‘tied the knot’ on American teen drama The OC.\n\nThe 37-year-old actress shared a selfie to her Instagram page after bumping into Adam, 39, at New York’s JFK airport on Tuesday night.\n\nThe pair, who had a relationship both on- and off-screen, sent fans wild after posing together for the snap in which a make-up free Rachel stuck her tongue out.\n\nAdam, who played Seth Cohen in the teen drama, is seen with his arm around Rachel, who played his girlfriend-then-wife Summer Roberts.\n\nPaying tribute to The OC’s theme song by Planet Phantom, she captioned the post: “Ran into my ol buddy from jfk to lax #californiaherewecome.”\n\nHowever, show creator Josh Shwartz left the comment of the day by refusing to play along, joking: “Sorry don’t get the reference”, to which Rachel replied: “well played Schwartz, well played”.\n\nFans immediately went wild seeing Rachel and Adam together again, begging for an on-screen reunion for their characters too.\n\nOne fan pleaded: “WE WANT A REUNION, EVEN IF IT IS A 5 MINUTES CLIP, DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND????? WE NEED IT!”\n\nAnother commented: “I have reboot goosebumps”, while others called for Rachel and Adam to star in a spin-off: “THE O.C , SETH AND SUMMER , REBOOT”.\n\nAnother fan wrote: “If thats not a sign you should do a reboot .. I don’t know what is.”\n\nRachel and Adam dated in real life for three years while playing the on-screen mismatched couple during the show’s four season run from 2003 to 2007.\n\nWhile their characters went on to marry on the show, the pair’s real-life romance sadly did not go the distance.\n\nAfter their break-up, Rachel went on to have a decade-long on-off relationship with Hayden Christensen, with the couple having one child together before splitting in 2017.\n\nAdam went on to date Gossip Girl star Leighton Meester, with the pair getting engaged in 2013, married in 2014 and having their first child in 2015."
