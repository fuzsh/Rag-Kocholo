Queen Sunandha Kumariratana of Siam (also known as Queen Sunanda) was born in 1860 and was the queen consort of King Rama V (Chulalongkorn) of Siam (now Thailand). She was a member of the royal family and was known for her beauty, grace, and kindness.

Queen Sunandha was born into a life of luxury and was raised with the utmost care and attention. She was educated in the traditional arts and sciences, and was trained in the royal court's etiquette and protocol. In 1878, she married King Rama V, who was just 20 years old at the time, and became his queen consort.

Tragically, Queen Sunandha's life was cut short in a drowning accident on May 31, 1880. She was just 20 years old at the time of her death. The accident occurred while she was on a royal barge trip along the Chao Phraya River with her husband and other members of the royal family.

According to historical accounts, Queen Sunandha Kumariratana of Siam was forbidden from being touched by commoners, as she was considered sacred and of high royal blood. During the boat accident, no one dared to touch her or try to save her, as it was believed that doing so would result in severe punishment or even death. This strict protocol and taboo surrounding the royal family's sanctity ultimately led to the tragic loss of the queen's life, as no one intervened to assist her during the accident.

According to eyewitness accounts, the royal barge was traveling too fast and hit a sandbar in the river, causing it to capsize. Queen Sunandha was thrown into the water and despite efforts to save her, she drowned. The king was devastated by her death and ordered a period of mourning throughout the kingdom.

Queen Sunandha's death had a significant impact on the kingdom and led to changes in royal protocols and water transportation safety measures. The king also built a temple in her honor, Wat Sunandha, which still stands today.

Despite her short life, Queen Sunandha left a lasting legacy in Siam. She was remembered for her kindness and compassion, and was revered by the people of Siam. Her story has been passed down through generations and continues to be celebrated in Thai culture and history.

In recent years, Queen Sunandha's story has gained international attention, with books, films, and documentaries telling her story and highlighting her significance in Thai history. Her legacy serves as a reminder of the importance of safety, compassion, and kindness, and continues to inspire people around the world.
