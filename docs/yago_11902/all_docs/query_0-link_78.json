        "text": "Sunandha Kumariratana (1860 – 1880) was a queen consort of Siam. She was a daughter of Siamese King Mongkut (Rama IV) and Princess Consort Piam. She was the half-sister and first wife of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) of Siam (now Thailand). The kings's other two wives were her full-sibling younger sisters, Queen Savang Vadhana and Queen Saovabha Bhongsi. King Mongkut had at least 82 children with various consorts and concubines. Sunandha Kumariratana had a daughter on August 12, 1878, named Kannabhorn Bejaratana and she was pregnant again when tragedy struck on May 31, 1880. While on the way to the Summer Palace Bang Pa-In, the royal boat she and her daughter were traveling on capsized. There were many onlookers who witnessed the capsizing and watched them drown, but they were unable to help. They were forbidden from touching the Queen on pain of death. It was a capital offense, even if it meant that they couldn’t save her life. They were even instructed to do nothing by a guard on another boat, though he was later punished for his strict view of the law in such circumstances. The grief-stricken Chulalongkorn later erected a memorial to her and their unborn child at Bang Pa-In Palace. Queen Sunandha’s ashes are enshrined at the Sunandha Nusavarya Memorial in the Royal Cemetery at Wat Ratchabophit with her daughter. #destroytheday"
