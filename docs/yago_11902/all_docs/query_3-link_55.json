        "text": "Until 1939, Thailand was known as the Kingdom of Siam.\n\nThe Kingdom of Siam became Thailand under Plaek Phibunsongkhram, who was prime minister from 1938 to 1944.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Phibunsongkhram and some of his acolytes were accused of war crimes, but were acquitted.\n\nSince 1973, the history of Thailand has been marked by alternating shifts in power between military and civil authorities.\n\nThe Thai Rak Thai Party, led by Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra governed the country from 2001 to 2006, before being removed from power by a military coup.\n\nFirst referendum:Â\n\nIn 2007, the Thai people approved the New Constitution following the first referendum in the country’s history.\n\nThe People’s Power Party won the elections that took place that year, but Thailand remained highly unstable and significant protests broke out in 2010.\n\nIn 2011, Thaksin Shinawatra’s sister became prime minister.\n\nTwo years later, she was accused of being a political puppet of her brother.\n\nShe held planned parliamentary elections in February, 2014, but these were invalidated the following month.\n\nThe 1850s\n\nIn 1855, the Kingdom of Siam was opened to trade with England, followed by France in 1858, Germany in 1862, and Austria in 1868.\n\nKing Mongkut implemented a number of social and economic reforms.\n\nHis son, Chulalongkorn abolished slavery and built relations with England: he had been brought up by an English governess, and the Thai ruler established personal relationships with foreign diplomats, even going as far as having his children raised in England.\n\nThe Franco-Siamese treaty of October 3rd, 1893, forced the Siamese to cede all its territory on the eastern bank of the Mekong, with France becoming the colonial power there.\n\nThe French and the English then divided the territories of the Menam Basin amongst themselves.\n\nThe land to the west, particularly the Malay Peninsula, was acknowledged to be English territory, and the land to the east, i.e., the Mekong Basin fell under French control. Ultimately only a small part of Siam remained independent.\n\nAncient Origin\n\nPeople speaking one of the Tai group of languages settled in what is now Thailand around 1,000 years ago.\n\nThe name Siam came from a Sanskrit word, syam.\n\nIt was adopted by the Portuguese from the 16th century and became the accepted geographical term.\n\nKingdoms rose and fell, but from the 1780s the Chakri dynasty ruled the whole of Siam from their capital at Bangkok.\n\nThey extended their domain into parts of modern Laos, Cambodia and Malaya, but in the late 19th and early 20th centuries they were forced to surrender their territories there to the French.\n\nThailand consists of two broad geographic areas: a larger, main section in the north and a smaller, peninsular extension in the south.\n\nThai-LandÂ\n\nThe Thai are descended from a much larger group of Tai-speaking peoples.\n\nThe latter are found from extreme northeastern India in the west to northern Vietnam in the east and from southern China in the north to as far south as the central Malay Peninsula.\n\nIn the past, scholars held that a parent group called the Proto-Tai originated in southern China and pushed southward and westward from the China landmass into northern mainland Southeast Asia.\n\nMost scholars now believe that the Tai came from northern Vietnam around the Dien Bien Phu area and that about 1,000 years ago they spread from there northward into southern China; westward into southwestern China, northern Myanmar (Burma), and northeastern India; and southward into what are now Laos and Thailand.\n\nEarly Tai culture\n\nTai-speaking peoples historically settled along river valleys, where they formed small settlements and engaged in subsistence rice agriculture, fishing, and gathering of forest products.\n\nEarly in their history the Tai domesticated animals: they used water buffalo for plowing and ritual purposes, and they raised pigs and fowl for food.\n\nWomen were accorded relatively high social status and could inherit property.\n\nThe Tai followed local religions that involved propitiation of both malevolent and benevolent spirits through offerings and special ceremonies.\n\nThe basic unit of Tai political organization was the mÃ¼ang, or group of villages, ruled by a chao, or hereditary chief or lord.\n\nDuring the 1st millennium CE the political strengths of the mÃ¼ang system enabled the Tai to move out of their original homeland until, by the 8th century, they had expanded across much of southeastern China and northern mainland Southeast Asia.\n\nBy the 11th century they had begun to filter down into the area of what is now Thailand, and by the middle of the following century they had formed petty principalities there.\n\nAs the Tai moved into mainland Southeast Asia, they came into contact with peoples speaking Mon-Khmer languages who had long inhabited the region.\n\nIndian traders traveling to China during the early centuries of the 1st millennium CE had carried Hindu and Buddhist beliefs and practices to some of those peoples, including the Mon, who lived in what is now Myanmar.\n\nThe Mon were the first people in mainland Southeast Asia to adopt Buddhism.\n\nBetween the 6th and 9th centuries the Mon established several small Buddhist kingdoms within the area encompassed by what is now southern Myanmar and central Thailand.\n\nFrom what are now the towns of Nakhon Pathom and Lop Buri in central Thailand, they extended their power eastward across the Khorat Plateau, northward as far as Chiang Mai, and northeastward into what is now Laos.\n\nThose Mon kingdoms are collectively called Dvaravati. The Dvaravati period is noted for its artwork, particularly its Buddhist sculptures and votive images made of terra-cotta or stucco.\n\nQueen consort of Siam (modern-day Thailand), Sunandha Kumariratana (1880s).\n\nBefore I begin let’s know the difference between a Queen and Queen Consort.\n\nA reigning monarch’s wife is traditionally known as the Queen Consort, while the Queen (technically the âQueen Regnantâ) refers to a woman who has ascended the throne through the pre-established familial line of succession and has sovereign power.\n\nShe was the first of the three wives of Siamese King Chulalongkorn, who is known for introducing some progressive reforms within his kingdom, like abolishing slavery.\n\nAt the time of her death, Sunandha Kumariratana already had one daughter and was expecting another child.\n\nIn May 1880, when Sunandha was just 19 years old, she was on a trip to the royal familyâs bountiful Bang Pa-In summer residence, outside of Bangkok.\n\nShe was accompanied by Princess Karnabhorn Bejraratana, who was not even two years old, and a group of guards and servants.\n\nBut reaching the palace required crossing Chao Phraya River, Thailandâs biggest river.\n\nThe queen consort and the princess were escorted to a separate boat which was dragged by a bigger boat to carry them over the river.\n\nHowever, the royal vessel capsized in strong currents and both were plunged into the water.\n\nNone of the royal entourage proceeded to help them!Â\n\nWhy?!!Â\n\nSupposedly everyone followed the lead of the main guard, who did not assist them or urge anyone else to help the drowning royalsâall three lives were lost while their attendants just stood sheepishly and watched!\n\nWhat Exactly was Happening?\n\nThe guards, and everyone on the scene, were adhering to an old and rigid Siamese law that did not allow ordinary persons (slaves ) to touch a member of the royal family!\n\nBreaking this law was punishable by death!\n\nAccording to Siamese oral tradition, besides the law, any desire to help save the life of the queen could have been diminished by a superstitious belief as well.\n\nAllegedly, saving a person who was drowning in the river was associated with misfortune.\n\nIf someone offered help to the person that meant meddling with the spirits who lived in the water.\n\nAfter this unbelievable incident, where three lives could have been easily spared with a little help, King Chulalongkorn proceeded to imprison the attendant who did not give any orders to attempt a rescue.\n\nThe king greatly grieved the death of his spouse, who is said to be the one he loved among all his wives.\n\nThe funerary procession that was accordingly arranged for the queen was possibly the most expensive funeral in the history of this Asian kingdom!\n\nThe king also carried out a great deal of work to complete the royal summer residence, which his revered wife was due to visit on the day of her unfortunate demise.\n\nIn the backyard of the palace, he placed a memorial to Sunandha Kumariratana and the children, a reminder of the unthinkable circumstances that ended their lives all too soon."
