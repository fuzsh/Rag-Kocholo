        "text": "The first branch would marry into the Royal Houses of Devakul, Isarasena, Kitiyakara and Sutasna, as well as several aristocratic families. A third generation, Princess Upsornsamarn married the Prince of Chantaburi, grandfather of Her Majesty Queen Sirikit, our present Queen.\n\nThe second branch became a royal, and mother of three Queens as mentioned above. Decendants of this branch include the Royal Houses of Bhanubandhu, Chakrabandhu, Chakrabongse, Chudadhuj, Chumbala, Devakul, Gunchara, Kasemsri, Kitiyakara, Kridakara, Ladawan, Paribatra, Rabibhat, Sonakul, Svasti, Tongyai, Visuthi and Vorawan - most of the Thai Royal Houses! In addition, many important aristocratic families are included in this line such as Bhirom Bhakdi, Posayananta, Punyaratabandhu, Sarasin and Sukhum, as well as Lamsam, a very prominent business clan.\n\nThe third branch includes two consorts of King Rama VI - Pra Sucharit Suda and Queen Indrasakdi Sachi. Decendents of this branch married into the Royal Houses of Sutasna and Pravitra, as well as prominent aristocratic families of Bunnag, Krairikh and Sarasin.\n\nThai/Siamese families married within their own clan. In the beginning, many royals married within the extended royal family, and then expanded to the aristocratic families. Even today, most still try to find partners within the old guards, thus intertwine the already tight connections."
