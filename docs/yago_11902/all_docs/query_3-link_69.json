        "text": "The selection of books below focuses on acclaimed chefs and cooks who have deep roots in Thailand, either because of a familial connection or a life long commitment to studying Thai cuisine and traveling / living in Thailand. These books are a fantastic starting point on your Thai cuisine journey.\n\nTHE CHEF: David Thompson\n\nWhile Chef David Thompson (Nahm (former), Long Chim Perth, Long Chim Sydney and Aaharn Hong Kong) is most definitely not a Thai national (he is Australian), he has been considered for years to be one of the top authorities on Thai cuisine and the history of Thai cuisine. In fact, during the History of Thai Cuisine section of my culinary program in Bangkok, our lecturer recommended David Thompson's books as the only resources available for further reading on Thai culinary history in English. He has lived and traveled extensively in Thailand, researching cuisine and history along the way, thus developing a very deep knowledge and expertise in Thai cuisine.\n\nIn addition travel research, David Thompson explores Thai cuisine through his impressive collection of funeral books. In Thailand, it is common for families to give funeral attendees gifts as keepsakes to remember their lost loved one, often the keepsake is a book encompassing the essence of the person. The books will include favorite Buddhist teachings and philosophies, personal stories and if the deceased was an exceptional cook, one would expect a recipe or two. This practice is believed to have started with Rama V in the 1800s, after the tragic deaths of his first wife and his daughter. The Royal Palace produced 10,000 books to memorialize the beloved Queen, Sunandha Kumariratana, and gift to mourning countrymen. The practice peaked in fashion until the mid 1900s, and has decreased in recent times. Chef David Thompson is said to have a collection of over 500 of these types of primary resource materials, which he uses to explore the history of Thai cooking. Sources: Altaabscura and Random Times\n\nTHE CHEF: Nuit Regular\n\nChef Nuit is the executive chef and co-owner of Pai Northern Thai Kitchen, Sabai Sabai, Sukhothai, and Kiin, all located in Canada.

If perhaps you've traveled to Northern Thailand and fell in love with the local cuisine, this is the book for you! Additionally, if you love Thai food and want to expand your knowledge of regional cuisine, this is a fantastic resource. The recipes are very traditional and don't make allowances or modifications for the Western palate, which is something many of us have been looking for in Thai cookbooks. This book is for you if your approach to Thai cooking is: don't give me a Thai recipe developed for what you think my palate wants, just give me the actual recipe and I'll take it from there!\n\nTHE CHEF: Chef McDang\n\nChef McDang was born into the Royal Family of Thailand. He was educated in the United States at Georgetown University, where, after watching Julia Child on American TV, he discovered his love for cooking and sharing Thai cuisine. From there he turned his professional attention to the culinary arts. In 2010 he published a cookbook called The Principals of Thai Cookery, which is considered by many to be a keystone resource on the topic. The recipes in this book are intended for those of us looking for Thai recipes translated into English. The recipes don't offer substitutions for foreigners and haven't been developed for the Western palate. These are the recipes people are cooking in Thailand every day.\n\nTHE CHEF: Pailin Chongchitnant\n\nPailin is probably the most famous Thai Chef Youtuber, and with good reason.

She was born into a family of farmers, in the very small town of Khao Khor in Phetchaboon province in northern Thailand, and had set up her own noodle stall at age 14. Soon after she finished her training in Hong Kong, she opened her first real restaurant there: Tuk Tuk Thai (which is still open today). After moving to London with her husband, Saiphin founded Rosa's Thai Café, which started as a food truck business in 2008. Saiphin and her husband, Alex, now own and operate six notable Thai restaurants in London with plans to open branches in North America.

Jody Horton is an award-winning food and lifestyle photographer. The recipes in the book are the top selling dishes at her the restaurant, which tend to be more fusion that traditional.\n\nTHE CHEF: Pepper Teigen\n\nAs a child, Pepper Teigen worked with her mom who was sort of a street food lunch lady in a small town outside of Korat in the Issarn region of Thailand. While she may not be a chef, she is definitely well experienced in Thai food. She's also a Thai mom. She's the mom of one of the world's most famous super models, to be exact.
