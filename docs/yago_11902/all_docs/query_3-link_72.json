        "text": "He is next in line to the Thai throne, but mystery still shrouds the low profile 14-year-old crown prince. Here are some things about him that you probably didn’t know.\n\n1. He is the only officially recognised son of the king\n\nDipangkorn has four half-brothers, but they are not officially recognised as the king’s sons, since their mother, Sujarinee Vivacharawongse, fled the country. Dipangkorn is the only son of the king to currently live in Thailand.\n\n2. He was featured in his mother’s campaign\n\nHis mother Srirasmi launched a breastfeeding campaign entitled “Sai yai rak chak mae su luk”, which translates as “Love and care from mother to children”. Images of her son as an infant were featured. A video on YouTube inspired by the campaign features touching pictures and clips of the two together.\n\n3. He lives apart from his mother\n\nHis mother, former royal consort Srirasmi Suwadee, was married to then-Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn from 2001-2014. When the prince was nine, seven of his mother’s family members were accused of lèse-majesté – defaming the monarchy, which is a crime in Thailand. Srirasmi was stripped of all her royal titles and is now said to live in seclusion outside Bangkok although she has not been seen since 2014 – the same year her son last saw her.\n\n4. He is the heir presumptive, not the heir apparent\n\nTechnically, Prince Dipangkorn is first in line to the throne. However, as his mother and the king are divorced, he can be replaced if the king has a son with his current wife. In that situation, the new son will be the crown prince and take Prince Dipangkorn’s place as first in line to the throne.\n\n5. He has started volunteering\n\nHe is only 14 years old, but the crown prince has been spotted cleaning the windows and painting the temple walls of the Rangsri Vadhana Memorial, which houses the former Queen Sunanda Kumariratana’s royal relics. He also gave food and water to people who were camping out along the Royal Cremation Ground. At another volunteering event in Germany, he expressed his desire to “do good deeds for other people”.\n\nWant more stories like this? Sign up here.
