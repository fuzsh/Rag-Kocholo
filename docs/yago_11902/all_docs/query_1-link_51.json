        "text": "On 20 November 2013, the Prime Minister announced that UNESCO has included Her Majesty Queen Sri Bajarindra on the list of Anniversaries of historic events and of eminent personalities celebrated by Member States and Associate Members with which UNESCO is associated in 2014-2015. Thailand celebrates the 150th Anniversary of the Birthday of Her Majesty on 1 January 2014.\n\n20 November 2019 marks the Centenary of the passing of Her Majesty Queen Sri Bajarindra the Queen Regent. Her great-granddaughter, Mom Rajawongse Narisa Chakrabongse, owner of River Books, is publishing a commemorative book on the Forgotten Queen. Luckily, she was not completely forgotten in the Tenth Reign, with a Buddhist Ceremony to mark the event at the Amarindra Throne Hall, The Grand Palace.\n\nHer Majesty the Queen Regent was the first woman of Siam to oversee the betterment of the Siamese women, first making herself a teacher to the Court of King Chulalongkorn, teaching the ladies the proper ways and educating them about Siamese ceremonies and culture.\n\nKing Chulalongkorn first thought of establishing a hospital in 1886, and the Siriraj Hospital was set up on 26 April 1888, in which the Queen contributed a large sum, and naming it after their son, Prince Siriraj Kakudhabhandha, who has died in 1887, not yet 2 years of age. Also in 1888, the Queen set up a nursing school that also specialized in pregnancy care, thereby becoming the first nursing school in Thailand that has since became the nursing faculty of Mahidol University. During the spat between Siam and France in 1893 which resulted in many wounded soldiers, doctors from Siriraj were sent to help, and the Queen herself went to visit, becoming the first Siamese Queen to do so. She said to the soldiers,\n\nQueen Sri Savarindhira or Queen Savang Vadhana was mother to 4 sons and 4 daughters, namely:\n\n1. HRH Crown Prince Maha Vajirunhis 26.7.1878-4.1.1895 (16), Siamâs first Crown Prince 2. HRH Prince Isariyalongkorn 4.9.1879-25.9.1879 (21 days) 3. HRH Princess Vichitra Chiraprabha 21.4.1881-15.8.1881 (3 months) 4. HRH Prince Sommatiwongse Varodaya 9.6.1882-17.6.1899 (17) 5. HRH Princess Valaya Alongkorn 16.4.1884-15.2.1939 (54) 6. HRH Princess Sirabhorn Sobhon 19.7.1888-28.5.1898 (9) 7. HRH Prince Mahidol Adulyadej 1.1.1892-24.9.1929 (37), father of Thailandâs present King Bhumibol Adulyadej, or Rama IX 8. HRH Princess (Not yet named, died a week after birth) 9.11.1893 (7 days)\n\nHer Majesty Queen Sri Savarindira passed away on 17 December 1955 at 93 years old, making her the last of Rama Vâs Queen Consorts, having survived all of her siblings, her husband as well as all of her own children and all of her sistersâ children. She also lived under 25 Prime Ministers of Thailand in the span of just 23 years in the so-called new era after the change from absolute monarchy to democracy. It was known that during the last years of Queen Savangâs life, during her spats of forgetfulness that is common with old age, she would call out to her younger sister to come and join her for lunch and dinner.\n\nIt should be noted that with all the changes that affected the Kingdom, which in turn directly affected her life, Queen Savang never once uttered a word. In this day and age, oneâs life is not at all affected in the same manner, but with just a small mishap in politics, the minority would come out and shout obscenity while misunderstanding their own beliefs.\n\nQueen Savang was listed in the UNESCO Calendar of Anniversaries of Great Personalities and Historic Events, 2012-2013, on her 150th anniversary in 2012.\n\nPoignantly, her beloved sister, Her Majesty Queen Regent Sri Bajarindra has been listed in the UNESCO Calendar of Anniversaries of Great Personalities and Historic Events, 2014-2015, also on her 150th anniversary in 2014."
