        "text": "Bang Pa In is a palace alongside Chao Phraya River built in the 17th century. It was used by the kings of Thailand until the sack of Ayutthaya in 1767 and since then it was abandoned for quite a long time.\n\nKing Mongkut (Rama IV) however, renovated the palace in the 19th century. Today, this historic palace is only used for state occasions instead as royal summer residence.\n\nThe summer palace of Bang Pa In is very European in design. The buildings are exquisitely laid around a long artificial pond which is surrounded by crafted ornaments and formal plants.\n\nThe extended pond serves as a partition of the outer palace from the inner palace where visitors are not allowed. In the center of the pond, you will find the stunning pavilion called The Divine Seat of Personal Freedom. It is the only Thai-style building in the palace and it features a statue of Rama V in its front.\n\nThe Excellent and Shining Heavenly Abode is a one-story mansion which is artistically and elaborately decorated that highlights the throne hall of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V). A two-story building named Exhibition Hall serves as a royal museum which displays the fragments of the palaceâ€™ history. It was originally built for the brothers of the king.\n\nThere is a fascinating Chinese-style building of red, black and gold hues with culmination of pearl. It was built by the Chinese Chamber of Commerce as a gift to the king in 1889.\n\nA Memorial to Queen Sunanda Kumariratana sculptured in marble can touch your heart where a special message from the king was encrypted. There is a Buddhist temple disguised as a Gothic church across the river which is named Wat Niwet Thamprawat.\n\nAyutthayan King Prasat Thong originally built the palace. Rama V expanded the palace grounds and built additional European-style buildings which are visited by tourists today. The latest renovation happened in 2001 and the palace and its grounds are well-kept.\n\nBang Pa In summer palace can be easily reached by boat service, luxury cruises or by train from Hualampong station. It is only 60 kilometers north of Bangkok."
