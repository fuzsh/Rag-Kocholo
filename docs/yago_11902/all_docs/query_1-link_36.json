She was a half-sister and the first queen consort (พระบรมราชเทวี) and one of four queens of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V,of Siam,now Thailand), two of which were her full-sibling younger sisters, Queen Savang Vadhana and Queen Saovabha Bhongsi. Despite the presence of many onlookers, they were forbidden on pain of death to touch the queen – not even to save her life."
