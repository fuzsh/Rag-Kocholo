        "text": "Ultimately paving the way for Thailand's current Democratic system, King Chulalongkorn or, King Rama V, is one of the most revered monarchs in Thailand's rich history. (1853-1910)\n\nCrowned at fifteen, King Chulalongkorn established a Government based upon the Western system and succeeded in reforming the rule of law by creating a proper judicial system.\n\nNot only this, but during his forty-two year reign, the Thai Baht was introduced, which is still used throughout the country today.\n\nHaving an interesting relationship with British monarchy in the late 19th Century, he was a cunning negotiator and keen diplomat who forestalled British Colonization - something which many Asian countries failed to do at the time.\n\nAs the story goes, Queen Elizabeth requested a railroad to be built through Siam (Thailand), which could potentially undermine the King's rule. Observing this likely event, he denied the construction - whilst sourcing materials from other European countries to build the rails for himself.\n\nThis tactical approach was primarily on the account of his father, King Rama IV, one of Siam's most educated leaders, who taught him the value of knowledge as well as the importance, and danger, of Western Civilazation - which granted him immense foresight on how to balance power and control.\n\nSiring seventy-seven children, he was the country's greatest patriarch. Despite the success of so many offspring, this King was to be struck with tragedy in love. His first wife, Queen Sunanda Kumariratana and her unborn daughter drowned when the royal boat capsized on its way to Bang Pa-In Royal palace.\n\nThrough his love and grief over his wife, the King built a grand memorial and temple at Bang Pa Palace, also known as the Summer Palace.\n\nThe preservation of Thailand's sovereignty and independence is a direct result of this man's efforts and he is loved by young and old alike, even as the tenth King is about to take the reign today. Every year on the Twenty-third of October, thousands of Thai people take to the King Rama V Equestrian monument to pay homage to him and his legendary reign."
