We invite you to explore the theme of Be/Longing in your submissions for our first edition. We accept various forms of literature, photo essays, and visual arts.

WAYF is an international journal with the mission to promote literature and art that transcends man-made boundaries. WAYF stands for Where Are You From, a loaded question for many who have a heritage that is different from their place of birth or residence. WAYF aims to help disarm this question and reclaim our identities beyond where we are from.
