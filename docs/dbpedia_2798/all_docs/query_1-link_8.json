        "text": "One of the first articles I did for TME years ago in February 2021 (it feels like years ago at least) was a review and try-on of CeCe tops at Nordstrom. I’d never heard of the brand before, but the frilly collars and fun colors had me intrigued.\n\nSo, when I found myself gravitating towards clothing brand WAYF, I figured it was time for installment deux of “Meredith orders a bunch of stuff from a new-to-her label, leading to worrisome glances from her family.”\n\nDress | Similar Heels | Lipstick (Secret Salma)\n\nAffordable Luxury? I Tried 4 Pieces From WAYF To Find Out\n\nWAYF (Where Are You From) is an affordable luxury brand started by Meredith Fisher (excellent name if I do say so myself). Her designs have caught the eyes of Rachel Zoe, The Olsen Twins and Meredith Plunkett — you know, A-List style icons (I kid, I kid).\n\nSo. While WAYF’s half-zip sweaters were the gateway drug, I quickly found myself adding other items to my Nordstrom cart…from a hot pink blouse to a very unexpected velvet dress. Was the quality still there? Was affordable luxury an oxymoron? Will I stop asking rhetorical questions? Maybe.\n\nBut first, let’s get to the try-on…\n\n1. The Grace Sleeveless Mock Neck Velvet Dress\n\nDress | Similar Heels | Lipstick (Secret Salma)\n\nI have to start with the absolute show stopper: this velvet dress for under $120. Perfect for an Angelia Jolie award show leg flaunting moment (iykyk). I actually bought this a week before my brother’s fake wedding (it’s a long story) and wore it to the courthouse. It will definitely be pulled out for future “real” weddings, fancy date nights, etc., The style is classic and the velvet luxe. Truly it looks more expensive than it is.\n\nFit Notes: The dress is TTS (I’m wearing a large).\n\n2. Nelle Half-Zip Pullover\n\nSweater | Jeans (diff. wash) | Boots\n\nI couldn’t resist this half-zip sweater. Comfy, cozy and more than half the price of an Everlane one I tried. I ordered it in a medium (wine) and a large (camel). While both fit, the large was more comfortable, particularly in the shoulders. It pairs great with my slouchy boyfriend jeans (diff. wash) and Vince suede boots.\n\nFit Notes: The sweater is TTS (I’m wearing a large. For a more fitted size, size down). The boots are TTS (I’m wearing an 8).\n\n3. Sweet Nothings Cable Turtleneck Sweater\n\nSweater | Jeans | Boots | Lipstick (Secret Salma)\n\nThe color of this lilac cable turtleneck sweater is everything. Nice and heavy for those cold winter days I was promised in Colorado. The only downside is the size of the sleeves. I love an aggressive sleeve as much as the next queen, but these just spell trouble with a toddler and doorknobs in general. So close, but just a tad too much for me.\n\nFit Notes: The sweater is TTS (I’m wearing a large). The boots are TTS (I’m wearing an 8). The jeans run big (I’m wearing an 8).\n\n4. I’m Blushing Puff Shoulder Top\n\nBlouse | Similar Trousers | Similar Heels | Necklace | Lipstick (Secret Salma)\n\nReminder to self: Wear brighter colors. This blouse is a knockout. If I were an extra in And Just Like That, this would totally be my outfit. The only thing I would do to alter it is add a stitch to close the front an inch or two to avoid any public displays of indecency. And get a regular, V-cut bra to wear underneath. This would be a fun going out top or an office top, but only if you work for Miranda Priestly, and if you do, my apologies.\n\nFit Notes: The blouse fits TTS (I’m wearing a large).\n\nShop More Pieces From WAYF\n\nBack to top\n\nIs affordable luxury achievable? When it comes to WAYF, I’d say so. A few stumbles here and there, but overall these are pieces that feel much more expensive than they look.\n\nx, Meredith"
