        "text": "I’ve been a huge fan of WAYF since I first discovered them in Nordstrom years ago. Sadly, their sizing always ran small and I could never wear them until now. As part of Nordstrom’s initiative to carry more extended sizes, WAYF has gladly stepped up and is offering the same cute pieces in plus & extended sizes as straight sizes in Nordstrom stores. I am excited to see more straight size brands follow suit and grateful that retailers like Nordstrom are changing the dynamic to offer more options in a range of sizes in store.\n\nThis Roxy Glen Plaid jumpsuit immediately caught my eye and I knew I had to have it. But what was even better was being able to try it on in store and see that they had a variety of size offerings from xs-4x in the same style!\n\nYou can shop some of my favorite WAYF looks below and coming this week my guide to Nordstrom’s new brands carrying extended sizes. So happy to have more options and places to shop!\n\nAlso in case you missed it, be sure to check out my previous post on 10 brands who recently launched extended sizes.\n\nxoxo – Rachel"
