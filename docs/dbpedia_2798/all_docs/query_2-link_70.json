        "text": "One Saturday evening in June 2019 I went to see new work by Marwa Abdul-Rahman at the Wilding Cran Gallery in Los Angeles. I was fascinated by the lack of boundaries in the work on display, its open sense of struggle and pressure. In the artist’s range of materials and the tensions contained within, I was struck by a bursting energy and a feeling of something more cerebral, controlled, and willed. So, three years later, when my partner Hedi El Kholti came back from a visit to Abdul-Rahman’s home and studio, I was not surprised at his enthusiasm for the newest work she was making. Clearly, she was not going to settle for anything easy or predictable, but what was happening with the new work, Hedi said, was not ordinary.\n\nThat fall, when he and I visited Abdul-Rahman and her partner, the writer Robert Dewhurst, for supper, I took stealthy looks at a door that I presumed led down to her studio and wondered if I could ask her what was happening there, knowing she had been working flat-out for a show opening in December. Following Abdul-Rahman into her workspace, I understood what Hedi had been talking about. Something extraordinary had happened to her imagination over the previous year, it was clear, culminating in forms that almost wriggle into life but maintain their autonomy. They were not figures, although some had the shape of figures; they were not metaphors, although each possessed elements filled with resonance and suggestion. They had an astonishing presence in that room, a strength and a force, as they later did in her show The World at The Box in Los Angeles. A year after the show, I went with Abdul-Rahman to her new studio and then accompanied her back to her house in Altadena. We sat at her dining room table, and she spoke about how this work was made.\n\nColm TóibínWe’re looking at a piece in process, and what I’m seeing are old objects, things found rather than bought, and a set of frames that you’re building from, where there was once nothing. Could you describe the process of moving from nothing into the first moment of building?\n\nMarwa Abdul-RahmanOften there’s a long time between nothing and something. I usually have scraps all around me—materials I’ve found or fragments I’ve built or woven for a previous show but didn’t use. At first it’s always about being patient and seeing what wants to emerge from such things. I generally don’t have a preconceived idea of what I’m going to do. I just sit in a place of darkness, mental darkness, where I can feel thoughts collecting and pressure forming around my body but still not act on concrete impulses. I know that in this darkness of mind I’m gathering information. After a long time—days or sometimes weeks—of feeling extremely uncomfortable in this state of neither seeing nor understanding, I start to sense that there’s something that wants to be told or said. It’s then that I begin physically moving things around.\n\nThe piece you’re looking at is still in process, which means I have no idea what it will look like when it’s complete. It began with a pile of old window screens that my parents were throwing out. I’m really not sure why, maybe because of their connection to my parents, but when I saw them I immediately thought, We can’t throw those away—I need to use them. I rescued the screens from the curb, but then left them in my yard for another year. They were just there, in the way that junk is junk, being rained on, collecting spider nests, and starting to rot. Finally, when it was time to start a new series, I dragged them inside, into a corner of my studio. When I start working with found objects like this, I sit in the chaos of the material, and inviting this chaos into my space makes me uncomfortable. I don’t know why I’m always surrounding myself with things that are on the verge of breaking down, but discomfort, darkness, and sitting in the unknown are an inescapable part of my process.\n\nCTDo you produce a drawing or an early blueprint of where the work might go?\n\nMAR I used to, but I now do a lot of looking, a lot of trying to really see and understand whatever it is I’m starting with. When I’ve saved something like the screens, something that is destroyed or broken and discarded, I try to appreciate that item’s potential and worthiness. How many hands have touched it? In what ways did it serve? Often when something breaks, our first instinct is to fix and manage. We want to repair things that look old or chaotic or decrepit and restore them to order and functionality. We tell ourselves that everything will be okay as long as we fix what’s broken, and if it seems irreparable, we throw it away. But when something broken is really just looked at in that state and allowed to be what it is, so much else can happen. Does it have to be a better version of what it was, or can it be something completely different? Can it remain in this decrepit state and still be valued?\n\nCT What relationship do the pieces have to a body? Not your body in particular and not in terms of figuration, but they are near to body size. Are you aware of working with something like a body?\n\nMAR I do think of them as bodies. My paintings are made in many layers, and I spend a lot of time constructing and creating their “insides” before I even start to paint. So I try to be patient with them and listen for what I think each one needs. In doing that, I form a relationship with the paintings as if they’re living beings that I’m caring for.\n\nCT It seems very physical, a lot of reaching, struggling, pulling, pushing, squeezing.\n\nMAR I usually build my pieces on cinder blocks, not on the wall, because they’re so heavy. I also need to manipulate them from all sides, so I’m often hugging a painting from the front and the back, squeezing it into my body in order to fasten or shape the area that I’m building. I’ll be standing on a ladder, for example, with a spool of wire or whatever in my hands or teeth, reaching to hook two loose ends together with just the right amount of tension. My body has physically rested inside and around each piece for hours. There’s so much wrestling involved.\n\nCT Your work Daybreak (Acceptance) seems to possess a sort of sexual presence. Does that way of looking make sense to you?\n\nMAR It does. At least four paintings in my most recent show, The World at The Box, have forms that recall the human body, although in an abstract or disfigured way: Daybreak (Acceptance), I Know You Want To Sing (Flesh), Ouroboros (Fire), and Fulfilling Agreements (Grace). In Daybreak (Acceptance), I think it’s the colors of the body, the suppleness and fleshiness of the body. This wasn’t intentional but it’s not surprising. I often think of creation—literally, birth—while I’m working, a moment that is of course inextricably tied to sex and sensuality. For me, the sexual presence of these works is far from sexy; it’s much closer to something primal and repulsive.\n\nCT One might think about birth and death as sort of soft ideas about the natural way in which things flow. But when I saw your show Eternal Return in 2019, I felt aware of an immense physical struggle that might have to do with an emerging spirit. Violence is not the word, but it seemed to involve a real struggle. There was a sense of tension within the material. Take me back to that show.\n\nMAR Eternal Return, named after Friedrich Nietzsche’s concept, was at Wilding Cran in Los Angeles. The works were painted sculptures, primarily made of discarded clothing that I shoved through welded wire fencing, covered with paint, glue, and resin, and then ripped apart and bound with more wire and twine. So it was an incredible struggle.\n\nReturning to the relationship with the body, it’s not lost on me that a lot of the materials I use once clothed people’s bodies. Also, I’m aware that I’m often compelled to make something that’s much bigger and heavier than me—something that’s out of my control. The materials I use are very difficult to handle. They have weight and awkward centers of gravity and are often falling or tumbling while I’m trying to catch them. I also often push materials to hold a weight or position that they cannot physically bear and then see what happens when they fail. I’ll use a floppy material, like Mylar, and weigh it down with glue and lead shot, or I’ll take a delicate piece of lace and slather it with oil paint. I’m trying to surrender, to relinquish control, but getting there is always a struggle because another part of me is fighting to maintain control.\n\nCT How does color happen to these three-dimensional forms?\n\nMAR Color isn’t important to me at all until I finish the form. When I’m creating these ambiguous sculptural shapes out of different materials, my only goal is to keep manipulating and building up a mass, to create a form. I’ll pour any color of house paint on them as long as it adds to this mass.\n\nCT You’re using paint as a sort of sculptural material.\n\nMAR Exactly. And once I can see and understand the form, the container that’s going to hold the information of the color, then I’ll start all over again moving from nothing to something. It feels to me that I do two very different things: I sculpt, then I paint. The two are completely separate, and it’s very hard for me to go from one mode to the other.\n\nCT So the paint you’ve put on before the painting really begins has been applied wildly, as it were, irresponsibly.\n\nMAR Irresponsibly, completely. But after that I look at the form with a painterly eye, and I’m very deliberate. I’m asking, What color is going to serve this form and allow it to come to life and speak what it needs to speak? Where am I going to put this color in relation to that color? What is the language of this particular piece? Obviously, when I’m actually working it’s not so literal. But the basic question is, What is there? What can the viewer see, and how can I guide their eye? I’m responding both to the form I’ve sculpted and to all the colors that are already there, which come from the materials I’ve used, from whatever paint I’ve applied recklessly and from things like resin, which I might have applied to strengthen the base. I’m always responding to what is already present.\n\nCTDo you call what you make paintings or pieces of sculpture?\n\nMAR That’s a fair question. The work could also be classified as assemblage, but I have always considered myself a painter and used the word paintings. The building or sculpting of the form is a starting point for the actual work, not unlike stretching canvas on a frame but obviously more elaborate. Many of the artists I most admire straddle this line between genres, such as Ree Morton, Paul Thek, and Jay DeFeo. On the other hand, I identify with a painting tradition that includes Odilon Redon and J. M. W. Turner. One of the most inspiring shows that I saw in 2023 was the Edvard Munch exhibit, Trembling Earth, at the Clark Art Institute in Massachusetts.\n\nCT I have a feeling that between Eternal Return, in 2019, and your most recent show at The Box, in 2022, something happened to your imagination. I think a lot of writers and painters experience, before a breakthrough, a time in which the mind can seem both oddly empty and strangely receptive, as though it were waiting to receive and sift through images, inspirations, rhythms. Do you know what went on for you in that period between the two shows?\n\nMAREternal Return was the last show for which I made sketches for each piece, which I would stay pretty faithful to. After that show, I actually took about a year off from painting. I questioned whether I wanted to continue putting objects into the world; I tried to examine exactly what it was I was doing. I became very introspective and also started doing other things with my time, like gardening and focusing on meditation and spirituality.\n\nCT Was there anything else you did?\n\nMAR Well, I am clairaudient, which means I can hear things that are physically inaudible. I’ve had this ability as far back as I can remember. When I was maybe ten or eleven, I shared this with my parents and they strongly discouraged it, so I learned to manage and ignore this layer of my reality the best I could. During this year when I was looking inward, I decided I wanted to delve deeper into why I have these gifts and see if there was some other thing I was supposed to be doing with my life and time. I took a two-year intensive course that taught me how to work in this world that is invisible and inaudible to others.\n\nCTWhat’s your family background?\n\nMARI’m a first-generation Egyptian American. My dad came to the United States in 1969, and my mom came in 1970. They were part of a program sponsored by the Egyptian government that paid for them to attend graduate school in the United States. They ended up staying here and starting a family. It was extremely important to them to raise my sister and me to know our cultural heritage, so I grew up in an observant Muslim household, speaking Arabic. They sent us to Egypt every summer so we could build a relationship with our ancestral home and our extended family and be immersed in Arabic. Hearing voices at a young age made sense to me, since I always was close to something that I couldn’t see. Even though my parents discouraged me from communicating with voices and spirits, they gave me another framework that was not so different: Islam, prayer, closeness to God.\n\nCTHow did the voices affect the art you were making?\n\nMARWhen I started painting seriously, as an MFA student at ArtCenter College of Design, I couldn’t stop the voices. They started getting really loud. I resisted, but they wanted to tell me what to do. They told me to just put a brush in my hand and let them do the work, but I was trying to learn my craft.\n\nIn the year I didn’t paint, learning how to work in the spirit world was extremely valuable. I thought this study would be separate from my art, but very quickly I identified three beings whom I could see and hear who were specifically interested in my art. I learned that I was very good at translating information from the invisible world, especially through the work. I began to understand that painting helped me to express this information I was being given so that I wouldn’t have to hold it all on my own. In January 2020, these beings said, “Give us one year, and let us make some work.” So that was the very first time that I didn’t start with a drawing or idea or anything else. That is how The World came to be. It felt like a huge breakthrough.\n\nCT We’re in Southern California, where death doesn’t really happen. It strikes me that you’re not part of that movement. What does death mean, or what does it do, in your work?\n\nMAR Death has always been a huge preoccupation for me. It’s the ultimate unknown. I learned during this two-year course that I’m really good at death. My gift isn’t just listening to invisible beings or seeing them; it’s something called “deathwalking.” When people die, they often don’t cross over for a number of reasons. I’ve learned how to help them do that—how to deathwalk them. It’s almost automatic, since I am associated with beings who do all the work. I just have to open a portal and then be a present witness. Being present for this is a beautiful thing.\n\nMany people who are dead still need to cross over, and they often collect in certain areas. I recently visited Egypt, where a lot of graveyards are now being demolished because the government wants to build on top of them. So I spent much of my time there in the back seat of my aunt’s car, taking direction from these beings, being asked to open portals for the dead. Usually by the time I’m being asked to open a portal and deathwalk en masse like this, most of the deceased understand and are ready to cross. But sometimes there is confusion and reluctance. So I’ll speak to the dead about their circumstances, and they’ll tell me about where they think they are. Sometimes they don’t know they’ve died because their death was too sudden, or they have left someone they’re having trouble letting go of. I’ll say, “Hey, you just happen to be dead ...” I know their circumstances, and I can answer their questions until they feel comfortable crossing. I’ve never forced anyone who has died to cross. It always has to come from them.\n\nDeath is mysterious and it’s powerful. It’s hard to sit with because it feels like such a loss from our point of view. But at the portal when the dead are crossing, I see loved ones and helpers waiting to celebrate and catch the deceased on the other side—very much like the joyful moment of birth. It’s a very silent and still space between worlds. I try to bring these experiences to the work. I wonder how much disintegration and decomposition a person can look at without turning away. I want to insist on the beauty of it, even though that transition is usually considered grotesque. The series Wayfarer There Is No Path, Only Wake Trails on the Sea I–IV was directly informed by deathwalking.\n\nCT It’s possible to imagine that the art that might come from deathwalking would be something fey, paintings filled with vague figures and even vaguer clouds. Your work, however, is so strong, so filled with power, with force, with struggle. What is the connection between this physicality and the portals and the voices beyond the line of the visible?\n\nMAR While I wait for instruction, information comes through my body. It’s really uncomfortable and heavy— like a twisted intestine or something similarly painful. My task is to sit with this discomfort and try to understand how to translate it into a visual language. Yet I know that I will never fully understand the information that I’m being given—and if I did, I think the work would suffer to a certain extent because it is all about forces that cannot be named. If I don’t surrender to the unknown, the work doesn’t come, but surrender is neither clean nor easy. It’s breaking down and admitting that I can no longer hold this intensity of feeling and this information coming at me. I’ll hear the beings that I work with in my studio tell me to “let it go.” People say this all the time: “Oh, if you let it go, things will get better.” But that is so hard to do. What does that really look like? For me, it looks like grieving, attacking the material, or moving my body to expend excess energy—it looks like me losing control.\n\nThe centerpiece of The World was a series of four works, the elements: Adumbration (Air), Ouroboros (Fire), You Are Held (Earth), and The Singularity (Water). I wasn’t told in advance that these works would represent the four elements, but while making them I did feel like I was dealing with forces that were larger than life and that I would never wholly understand. While these forces felt benevolent, I also felt the overwhelming weight of something powerful and present that I needed to contend with in order to survive.\n\nCT Do you have a problem with someone misreading the work as being much more figurative than you intend? You mentioned intestines, which I wouldn’t have mentioned because talking about blood and guts could lead to a too-simple misinterpretation. But there really is the sense in the work of the inside of a body—intestines, heart, an amount of mess. Are you working with the interior of the body as a metaphor, or are you depicting it?\n\nMAR I think that the pieces speak for themselves. If you’re seeing intestines, you’re seeing intestines; if you’re seeing a flower, then so be it. My paintings are metaphors and always abstract, but I won’t stop a painting from starting to look like something if it’s moving in that direction. In fact, if a painting isn’t finished the way it needs to be, I get a feeling at my heart and in my throat that won’t go away. As soon as that feeling drains out of me, I know a piece is finished. It’s very exciting because only then can I truly see what it looks like.\n\nCTWhen I first saw in your studio these half-made objects arranged in various ways, I had the sense you were working on something that was totally alive. I felt a force in the air.\n\nMARThat’s absolutely the way I experience it. The way I understand it, there is information in my paintings that cannot be understood in our verbal language. And so they feel magical to me; they feel like portals. I don’t necessarily attribute the magic to myself. I just take impressions and feelings into my body, then do my best to translate them visually.\n\nCTCan you tell me about your time as a student at ArtCenter? How did you get there?\n\nMARI studied film in undergrad, and the kind of films that I was really into were art films, anything that spoke of art or reminded the viewer that they were actually watching a movie. That idea of breaking the fourth wall is still exciting to me. I think a lot about what we call “reality,” how little we know about it, and all of the clues we have about it being an illusion. When I finished college, I got married young and moved to Switzerland. I thought I was going to be able to pursue filmmaking, but it didn’t work out that way. I graduated from college in 1996, and by the time I came back to the States, it was 2004, I had two young children, and I was going through a divorce. I said to myself, “For the first time in my life, I’m going to do exactly what I want.” What I wanted to do was paint.\n\nI was at ArtCenter from 2009 to 2011, and it changed my life. I would drop my children off at elementary school nearby and drive straight to my studio. No one else would be there that early, and I’d be able to get a lot of work done. I’d have to pick the kids up after school, so I had to be efficient. It was the first time in my life that I woke up knowing that I was going to make art every single day.\n\nBruce Hainley and Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe were the two professors/mentors who most shaped the way I looked at and questioned my work. They are two very different thinkers and would have such different insights about the work, but they both challenged me to be more honest in what I was doing.\n\nCT I’m not sure I can ask you to explain the work, but I’m still somewhat mystified by it. In this painting that we’re looking at, Daybreak (Acceptance), I’m seeing strength, struggle, force, and some extraordinary sense of life wriggling into being. What was it like to go down to the studio in your house, sit in the dark, and let this work come to you?\n\nMAR It’s hard to be clear about this because the work really comes from the space of the unknown. But I can start by saying that I believe that everything around us is alive and imbued with spirit. For human beings, I think the body is the site of the spiritual. We all have a body, and we all experience it and experience through it. If you’ve ever seen a dead body, you can tell that it’s different from a sleeping body. I believe there’s something that animates us, and that something animates all material and form.\n\nDaybreak (Acceptance) came from a very personal place of loss and grief. It was one of the hardest paintings to create because I was working with a specific loss, and I understood the pain and pressure in my body as grief. I felt extremely vulnerable wrestling with the push and pull of wanting to keep this loss alive, even though holding on to it was prolonging my pain. Eventually, by working with and looking at this loss closely, I understood it as something that was not exactly lost but transformed. That’s where the title came from. There really is a moment when something turns and the only thing left to do is let go. It doesn’t mean that we can no longer have grief; it just means accepting that we cannot control all outcomes, no matter how hard we try. All of the paintings are alive. They are portals into places of knowing, acceptance, and surrender. I don’t know how it’s possible that fabric, wire, and paint can create a living being, but I believe it."
