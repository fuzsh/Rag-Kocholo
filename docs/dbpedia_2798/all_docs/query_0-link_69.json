        "text": "We love stumbling across new brands that are now carrying plus size options. No stranger to this introduction is Nordstrom. And right in time for the fall season, Wayf, this LA based brand has added plus size options to its lineup, exclusively at Nordstrom!\n\nThanks to the tip from @LovelyInLA in Instagram, we immediately dove into this brand to learn more about this aesthetic, vibe, and what they had to offer the plus size curvy fashionista!\n\nThink LA cool, polished, eclectic, editor chic vibes. If this collection continues to extend its plus size options, there could really be some magic in store for us plus size women.\n\nDesigner and owner Meredith Fisher continues to bring affordable luxury to the contemporary market with her label, WAYF (Where Are You From).\n\nAvailable up through a size 22, we are curious to see how the plus size options with this brand evolve, especially as we have fallen in love with their fall lookbook!\n\nOur Favorite Wayf Plus Size Picks\n\nBUT. As fun as these pieces are? You have to see a few of the options that we wish Nordstrom and Wayf fashioned in plus sizes… Don’t be scared! If you make it, we will come!\n\nOur Wayf Plus Size wish list:\n\nYou see that purple faux fur jacket? The leopard pieces? The hemlines and details? We need all of this. STAT. Okay Nordstrom and Wayf?\n\nK. Thanks.\n\nYou can shop the collection now, at Nordstrom.com\n\nBut, can we take a minute and just give some love and credit to Nordstrom who has been putting in THAT work to really extend the breadth of their plus sizes both online and instore? Nordstrom made a pledge and listen, they are making inroads! From in store options of Leith, BP. (Brass Plum), Good American, and more, Nordstrom has consistently been delivering on their commitment to adding more plus size options to their assortment, especially with brand exclusives.\n\nThis is something that Rachel Pally championed years ago!\n\nWhat do you think about the options that Nordstrom is bringing us, especially with Wayf? I do hope to see more plus sizes added to Wayf’s social media and website!\n\nDo you see a few pieces that you can have a little fun in?\n\nDrop us your thoughts and faves in the comments below!"
