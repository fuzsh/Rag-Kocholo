        "text": "The switching of map type each time i go to submit a waypoint should remember either Map or Satelite from my last submission. Each time our intern had to go in and switch the map view because it’s easier to find things on the satellite view.\n\nWhen you go to The Title, Description and Reason screens can it be preselected to type in the boxes. Would save a click each time on the entry.\n\nReview Your submission should really come after the Explanation and the explanation should be included in it. Really doesn’t make sense to have the explanation after the review.\n\nWhen you go from one step to the next it would ne nice instead of seeing a generic placeholder image at the top of the steps to actually see the image of the waypoint there instead.\n\nThe show the surrounding area description has new line characters showing on the android version.\n\nCan any waypoint you submit immediately show up on your local map? I know they seem to sync every 30 minutes but if i want to create scans for it i have to wait for it to appear which is annoying.\n\nHave a way to upload later instead of using my mobile data plan in the middle of a woods where the connection is terrible.\n\nI get so lost sometimes in the interface trying to find the Wayspot submit button. It is not apparent where it is in the app and it disappears if you have clicked on a waypoint to view details.\n\nHave a way in the app on waypoint details to click on them to get the GPS Coordinates auto copied. I can see the coordinates but cannot copy them on my phone. On click it should copy to clipboard.\n\nI really wish there was a search for both locations and waypoints in the app. For example if i go to a park with 100 waypoints in it and want to find something quickly i have to click on every single one. If there was a simple search interface within a radius it would solve this.\n\nDo waypoints get stored in a local cache in the app currently or are they redownloaded each time? If not that should definitely happen so they can persistently load in an area without issue. I don’t want to have to keep clicking load waypoints for areas I have been to. Only load new waypoints.\n\nSpecifically for the edit interface each specific change needs to have a reason for changing it. Sometimes there are businesses that change names but all photos say the old name? How could you expect anyone to review that without having a reason field for every change? So yes the big thing is the reason.\n\nNone of my edits have been reviewed that i have submitted through the app so I have no idea how the process works. It would be nice for your team to put some of those through and so I can see the full process and provide more feedback."
