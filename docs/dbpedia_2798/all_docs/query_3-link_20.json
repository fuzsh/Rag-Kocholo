        "text": "Itchi.io is a website that I visit weekly. I click through a bunch of pages of cool little games and add them to one of several in-app collections with the intention of playing them “soon.” Such is a hopeful lie I tell myself barring a scant few exceptions. One such exception came from my ever growing list of Twine titles.\n\nI know what I am. I love a good choice based narrative, especially if you’ve got some cool characters in there that I can smooch. Turns out dating sims and Bioware are a rather common influence among narrative heavy experience on itch. However, one in particular has such an attention grabbing premise. The ambitions of its largely solo developer are quite high, and only two of fifteen episodes have been released, with only one more planned for this year. That game is Wayfarer from Idrelle Games. As ambitious and as early as it may be, there is something special at work.\n\nTo give a brief narrative and mechanical setup, Wayfarer takes place in a western fantasy world where nearly everyone has some form of magic. Most have mundane skills best suited for daily labor and simple tasks of otherwise typical medieval life. But of course there are those with immense social and political sway as a result of equally immense magical prowess. Then there are the rare few who have no magical power, who are ostracized by much of society because not only do they not wield magic, but they are immune to it. Among some of the unmagical are the wayfarers, an order of wandering mercenaries recruited from all over the world and trained from a young age to become warriors. The big fantasy IP touchstone here is The Witcher and the Witcher’s guild. Wayfarers are looked upon with distrustful eyes, but when a job arises that they’re capable of handling, they’re seen as a necessary evil.\n\nYou play as one such wayfarer. Choosing from a handful of possible fantasy races and origin stories that determine all sorts of RPG factors. Elves can see in the dark, Melusine — fish folk — can breath under water, and other such racial bonuses. Depending on the region you character is from, an understanding of certain languages becomes a factor. Of course, there are stats such as strength, agility, persuasion, and perception on top of status / ailments such as intoxication or focus. These then play into skill checks during dialogue. Based on behind the scenes dice rolls, you will either pass or fail those checks. All of this is fairly typical but given the that this is entirely a solo project made with a text heavy design frame, it’s impressive how much is implemented. Factoring in the setup of having to balance relations not only with a group of companions, but a number of factions, and there is a strong sense of peril. Each have their own meter with which your relations are measured. No choice pleases everyone.\n\nUnsurprisingly such an underdog setup lends itself to a sense of vulnerability. At no point did I feel this more than in the finale of episode two. Finally reaching Velantis, having been hired by the heir to the throne for a mission placing my wayfarer, Itri, directly in the midst of the many sub-factions within the Guild of Mages. The night of Itri’s arrival, is by circumstance, also been the night of a party being thrown at the palace in honor of some foreign dignitaries. Before splitting up, Aeran makes one request of Itri: don’t drink.\n\nNow, I’ve played a Bioware game or two and know for a fact that when a game like this gives you the opportunity to drink, it only ever leads to goofy fun times and some endearing companion chatter. I ignored the fact that Aeran was already disappointed in Itri for having not trusted him during the finale of episode one. A choice that got Itri gut stabbed and nearly dead. Lingering in the background of all of this is the destruction of the Wayfarer Order, and Aeran’s trauma of barely escaping that event alongside he and Itri’s master. The latter of whom, despite the possibility of being dead, seemingly grew to favor Aeran in recent years. There are a whole lot of other tortured pasts at play as well with Aeran never fully speaking of his life in the five years since he and Itri last met. Though it sure does seem like he did some heavy shit that has made him both accomplished and feared.\n\nSide note: There is also some Jedi Order stuff going on here with questions around how willing, or capable of making the decision, the children are when they’re recruited by wayfarers. Yes, this is touching on so many of my favorite aspects of my most beloved pieces of media.\n\nDespite all of that I made the obviously right choice and slowly warmed up to the idea of throwing a few back across the evening. It would have been rude not to! I was being offered drinks and was simply trying to blend in! Well…\n\nTowards the end of the night, Aeran and Itri meet up with the princess, and her co-conspirators. What plays out not only highlights the divergence in choice, heavily coloring a scene and its potential outcomes, but a deeply effecting moment of disempowerment within a choice drive narrartive.\n\nItri’s employer relies upon him and he betrays that trust by showing an extreme lack of self-control. The anger and disappointment they view Itri with makes me feel disgusting. As the meeting goes on and it becomes obvious how drunk Itri is, the other conspirators turn sour on the whole plan. They talk as if he isn’t even in the room, like he is nothing. Itri is a mess others — people who he is egregiously disappointing — have to handle. I feel genuinely guilty over letting Aeran down and forcing him to be the responsible one once more. It’s then that it fully hits me who Itri is in this story. They’re not the Bioware protagonist. They’re not the force of will pulling their tortured companions along through whatever world altering events are occuring. They’re not even Hawke blowing in the winds of history as in Dragon Age II. Itri is a stock character from crime fiction. The unreliable best friend who the protagonist is going to have to let go of, lest they both be brought down.\n\nInterestingly, despite this unpleasant turn of events, and the moment to moment feeling of being under threat, there are no bad endings. As I dug through the itch.io page, a player had expressed some frustration with how some choices played out and asked if there was a guide. The developer’s response is rather compelling.\n\n“Wayfarer is not a typical RPG in how it handles success and failure — failure is not a punishment, simply another path through the story. There is no game over; your choices will not lead to your pre-mature death. The gameplay is not about good routes vs bad routes, good endings vs bad endings, wrong choices vs right choices, or maximizing the path you are on for the “best” version (what is “best” is going to vary wildly from player to player, and the game is designed to have a high replay value so there will be small variances on every playthrough). The gameplay is about the journey and where your choices take you, even when events spin out of control; it is about seeing what happens next, not deciding the result you want and trying to achieve it. There are hundreds of choices that impact each other in a domino effect, which gets even more complex with stat checks involved. When approaching this game, you may need to reconfigure how you see failure, character relationship, and faction relationship progression.”\n\nAll choices lead to alternate paths that are all intended to be meaningful. Being the fuck-up hits so much harder than a game over screen. The latter is a mechanical reality that we are largely numb to as video game players. The former is something we have to sit with."
