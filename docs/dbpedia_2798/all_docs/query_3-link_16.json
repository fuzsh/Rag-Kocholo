        "text": "You're probably reading the title and thinking \"uh huh, Ashley... sure!\" To be honest, I think all brides have the intention of finding perfect bridesmaid dresses to compliment their wedding, look good on all their gals and don't cost a fortune. Until recently the issue has been lack of options so usually the default is \"must have something that compliments my wedding\" and the rest kind of fell to the wasteside. For all of us who have worn a dress we didn't really love or cringed looking at the credit card statement for the dress you know you're never going to wear again... remember, we did it in the name of LOVE + FRIENDSHIP - haha! And for all of us planning a wedding in 2018, let's step it up for our bridesbabes ðŸ˜‰\n\nAs I started putting together the Pinterest board for #aplusabigday I had a pretty clear picture on what color I wanted for my gals - champagne- and originally thought I was going to all let them choose whatever dress they wanted, however, champagne looks diff from fabric to fabric and brand to brand which started making me a bit nervous. Around the same time WAYF reached out to tell me about their new bridesmaid line and I was super excited because they're a contemporary brand that makes regular (and V cute) clothes, not just bridesmaid dresses, so I knew there would be a fashion element to them!\n\nNext thing you know the gals and I were at Nordstrom Topanga trying on some styles and picking their faves...\n\nThe key: can you dance in it? Haha - that was our motto during the entire try-on sesh. The second we walked in each of my bridesbabes gravitated to a different style; it was so fun to see! As women, we all know our bodies best and what looks great and not so hot, so I think it's so important to let your gals chose their style. Even though it's my big day, I want them standing next to me feeling sups confident and fabulous!\n\nI don't know if they were just humoring me but at some point every bridesbabe said how much they loved the WAYF dresses from the styles to the fits. To me they look effortless and not too stuffy, which is really the entire vibe of our wedding. The ruffle and tie details add a bit of romanticism without overdoing it, and everything is SO flattering. A few girls had trouble deciding on the ONE because they loved a few styles.\n\nAren't they just so stunning? Love these gals and can't wait for the big day! The style that was definitely a favorite is the Jamie Ruffle Wrap Gown - it's the one with the criss-cross detail in the back. Wrap styles are definitely the most flattering overall and also work well for gals that may have bigger boobs! I think two of my bridesbabes opted for this style. The Lauren Tiered Gown is one that looks SO amazing on but doesn't necessarily scream \"wear me\" hanging on the rack. The gals didn't even try that one on until the end and we were like \"OMG, where has this one been the whole time?\" It's the style that my friend Heather is wearing in the solo black + white pic.\n\nTechnically our color \"champagne\" hasn't launched yet BUT it will be soon, so if that's a color you're looking for then stay tuned. Also there's a few new WAYF styles coming in the next couple months to add to the assortment. For sizing, they definitely run big so if you can't stop in to your local Nordstrom and try, I would suggest sizing down TWO sizes.\n\nEek, you guys the countdown is ON... 50 something more days until #aplusabigday and OMG there's so much to do! Comment below or DM if you have any bridesmaid dress Qs - so so happy to help. I'm working on an insane wedding dress story for you. xo - Ash"
