        "text": "Ella Wayfarer\n\nName: Ella Wayfarer\n\nProfession: Yoga teacher and social media manager\n\nBackground: Photographer, yoga teacher, and social media manager traveling in her self-built camper van \"Pumpkin the Van\".\n\nResidence: Leipzig, Germany\n\nFamily: Partner Malo and a two-month-old baby\n\nInstagram: @ellawayfarer\n\nYou recently became a mother, congratulations! How are you feeling?\n\nIt feels like my heart is filled to the brim with both exhaustion and love.\n\nDid you have any special tricks that helped you prepare for your delivery, now that you look back?\n\nI prepared mentally. I have been practicing yoga and meditation for a few years now, and I also trained meditatively for the delivery. It really helped me stay relaxed during both the pregnancy and the delivery, even though I didn't have the chance to use the meditation techniques I had practiced for the delivery, since it went so quickly...\n\nCan you tell us a bit about your maternity wardrobe and which pieces you continue to use now that you're a mother?\n\nI still use my maternity pants and leggings. I especially love my merino wool leggings and my Once-on-never-off wide pants from Boob ;) And of course, my comfortable 24/7 bras!\n\nHow would you describe your childbirth experience in three words?\n\nStrong, intense, and confidence-boosting!\n\nBeing a new mother and taking care of a newborn brings up a lot of emotions. Is there something special you treat yourself to, or that you want to treat yourself to in the future?\n\nMeditation mainly, although I haven't quite gotten there yet ;) And trying to plan a little alone time each week where I can be completely alone for a while and just rest or do something for myself.\n\nLooking back, what would you say is the most surprising thing you learned about yourself (or life) during your pregnancy?\n\nI really learned to love my body a lot more. I've never felt uncomfortable with my body, but now I have the utmost respect and love for all women's bodies. They are miraculous and can handle anything if you just let go.\n\nWe love your van-life concept because it shows that you can live well without living large. Can you tell us more about #pumpkinthevan and why you love living in your van part of the year?\n\nI learned to live in a van when I lived in Australia when I was 18. My friend and I had a kombi back then, and when I could afford it, I decided to switch to a small VW T5 camping bus. And since then, my lovely \"Pumpkin\" and I have traveled to many places in Europe. There will be more in the future.\n\nYoga is a big part of your identity. Has it changed since the baby arrived?\n\nYes, I definitely don't have time for long yoga sessions anymore, haha! But that will change as soon as our baby gets a bit older. My body also needs to fully recover before I'm ready to practice yoga as I did before, and it feels important not to rush it. So, I prefer slower and gentler yoga until then.\n\nWhat does sustainability mean to you?\n\nIt is a big part of my life. I try to make small efforts here and there, in all areas of life, from clothes to food and furniture, and now even when it comes to baby clothes and hygiene products.\n\nDo you see any similarities between yoga and living a sustainable life?\n\nYoga teaches you to live a little more consciously, to reflect on your choices, and to approach your surroundings with love and respect. Sustainability is also about caring for Mother Earth and all life. So yes, absolutely!\n\nWhat do you hope to pass on to your child?\n\nOh, so many things! But most of all, self-confidence and taking oneself seriously, with all the emotions it entails. If you have that as a foundation, everything else is a bit easier.\n\nFavorite places you like to visit?\n\nI'll mention 3 that I really love:\n\n1. Gorge du Verdon in France, preferably in the fall.\n\n2. Portugal in a caravan, you live a wonderful hippie life there!\n\n3. Venice, but without a map and guide. It's a perfect place to get lost and find little hidden gems.\n\nLastly, do you have any special advice you'd like to share with pregnant or new mothers?\n\nRelax and trust your instincts and feelings. Our bodies and our babies already know what to do."
