        "text": "|| Sunnies || Top || Pants || Purse || Shoes ||\n\nHi Everyone!\n\nWe hope you are loving The WAYF Influencer Collection at Nordstrom as much as we do. We are so thrilled to be a part of it and we think the clothes are SO adorable for the holiday season. Every piece is affordable, great quality, and versatile as well. All things we look for when we‚Äôre deciding which collections to promote. In this post I am breaking down the collection, item by item. I‚Äôll tell you exactly what I like about each piece, and explain all the different ways I would style them.\n\nShop The Wayf x Nordstrom Influencer Inspired Collection:\n\n1.) The San Francisco Sweater Dress:\n\nThis sweater dress is quite literally the only sweater dress you need for Fall and Winter. Ashley and I are both think this is THE BEST piece of the whole The WAYF Influencer Collection at Nordstrom. We are obsessed with both of the colors. The burgundy color is perfect for Thanksgiving. We‚Äôd wear it with OTK boots and a vest. But you can also wear it with tights, pumps, and a fur coat for Christmas. The army green is THE most amazing everyday sweater dress. I love that you can wear it with nude, brown or black. These dresses are SO comfortable and super versatile. We also LOVE the adorable ruffle detailing it the shoulders. It is that attention to detail that makes these dresses so much more than just the average sweater dress. We also LOVE the material. It is a little bit stretchy, but it doesn‚Äôt stretch out when you wear these dresses multiple times in a row. The last part that we love about the San Francisco Sweater Dress is that the material is super soft and not itchy at all. Buy this dress. Trust us‚Ä¶ you will LOVE IT!\n\n|| Hat || Dress || Boots || Sunnies ||\n\n2.) The Reno Cardigan:\n\nRENO BABES! Can you believe we have THE CUTEST CARDIGAN EVER named after us ‚Äî at Nordstrom?!?! This is a very exciting day. We may not have a Nordstrom in town, but we have a cardigan named after us! We love all the different ways you can style this cardigan. It is THE perfect length to wear with slip dresses. We love how adorable it looks with jeans and a cami. And in true Two Peas form, it had to be long enough to wear with leggings. BLESS the Reno cardigan. YOU WILL LOVE IT!\n\n|| Hat || Tank || Cardigan || Jeans || Boots ||\n\n3.) The Cincinnati Corset Top:\n\nThis TOP is so adorable. I have legitimately 0 boobs and this top kind of helped me ‚Äúfake it till I make it‚Äù ‚Äî if you know what I mean. üôÇ We LOVE the burgundy leopard print‚Ä¶ and the floral version would be ADORABLE with a black skirt for the holidays. We will say ‚Äì this top is definitely cropped, so you have to be ok with showing a little midsection or into high waisted pants/skirts. We just wanted to keep it real!\n\n|| Sunnies || Top || Pants || Purse || Shoes ||\n\n4.) The Charlotte Tie Waist Pant:\n\nThese pants are the PERFECT fall and holiday pants. Whether you‚Äôre wearing them to the office with my favorite white button down ‚Ä¶ or to Thanksgiving with the Reno Cardigan‚Ä¶ or to Christmas parties with the Nashville Cami as I have paired it here‚Ä¶ these pants are EVERYTHING. They are equally comfortable and cute and they are under $100 too!\n\n|| Sunnies || Top || Pants || Purse || Shoes ||\n\n5.) The Nashville Cami:\n\nThis cami is absolutely perfect for the holidays. I am sad to say‚Ä¶ I have a cami that is exactly the same‚Ä¶ only I paid 3x more last year for it. Lucky for you ‚Äì WAYF designed the perfect holiday sequined cami. The quality is AMAZING and the colors are perfect for this time of year!\n\n|| Top || Pants || Purse || Shoes ||\n\n6.) The Los Angeles Snakeskin Dress:\n\nThis snakeskin dress is SOOO comfy ‚Äì hello elasticized waistband ‚Äì and SUPER cute for holiday and New Years parties alike!\n\n|| Sunnies || Dress || Purse ||\n\n7.) The Brooklyn Fur Coat:\n\nThis fur coat is everything you‚Äôre looking for in a holiday topper. Of course we LOVE the leopard print‚Ä¶ but the burgundy would look SOOO amazing over a slip dress for Christmas parties! OOOO LAH LAH!\n\n|| Sunnies || Coat || Top || Pants || Purse || Shoes ||"
