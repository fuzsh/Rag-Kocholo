        "text": "The Challenge\n\nUniversities, academic institutions, and other organizations typically use Identity Management systems to provide their members access to a variety of content and services.\n\nIn an environment where users from different organizations can access the same resources, the content and service providers are challenged to discover the organization with which each user is affiliated in order to direct them for authentication to their organization’s Identity Provider.\n\nUser Friction\n\nCurrently, to determine a user's affiliation, publisher platforms guide the user through a multi-step process, including selecting their organization from a long list of supported organizations.\n\nUsers have to repeat this process at every publisher site that they visit.\n\nThe WAYF Cloud\n\nContrast the previous process to one in which the user's selection for one service provider is remembered for all. This is the WAYF Cloud’s user experience.\n\nThe WAYF Cloud is the infrastructure that allows service providers to share information with one another to avoid repeatedly asking the user the same set of questions."
