        "meta_description": "WAYFARER by Vylet Pony, released 30 July 2021\n\nI didn’t know\nThat I could still love you\nStill I wondered\nEvery day\nI think dreamt of you\nThe other night\nNo short-lived\nMemory\nLook how far you’ve come\nBecoming somepony brand new\nI’ve been a wayfarer so long\nBut when I came home, you were still you\nSomehow I knew we’d end up further\nWhat did I get us into?\nStill my heart is breaking\nNo magic could heal these wounds\n—\nI wish I could tell you\nTell you\nBut I don’t wanna fuck this up\nLike I have before\nThink it’d be better\nIf I just shut my mouth\nCuz I hate how I look\nHow I sound\nI just can’t help this feeling of\nFalling in love\nStill proxying my feelings\nOn a digital dove\nI’ve been back in Sire’s Hollow\nfor a really long time now\nSo why do you feel so \nFar away?\n—\n[Nov 5, 2012]\n“Hello Brandon? Yeah. You know me.”\n(Call-waiting Jingle)\n—\nCan you hear me?\nCan you hear me?\nFrom all those miles away.\nCan you hear me?\nCan you hear me?\nFrom all those miles away.\nCan you hear me?\nCan you hear me?\nFrom all those miles away.\nCan you hear me?\nCan you hear me?\nFrom all those miles away.\n—\nI’m just so scared putting all this\nPressure on you\nI care so much, but I’ve still\nGot these feelings too\nEverytime I hear you laugh\nI feel like I’m ok\nSo I’ll never talk\nI swear I’ll never say\n—\nI just can’t help this feeling of\nFalling in love\nStill proxying my feelings\nOn a digital dove\nI’ve been back in Sire’s Hollow\nfor a really long time now\nSo why do you feel so \nFar away?",
