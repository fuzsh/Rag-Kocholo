Your users will search for and select your institution name to go through to your institutional login page.\n\nHowever, if you have both Nature and SpringerLink set up with Okta, the behaviour on the WAYF pages will be different. The best user experience will be from using the OKTA homepage/app directly, or by using WAYFless URLS on your own site (WAYFless URL set up instructions can be found here for Nature and SpringerLink)\n\nThe naming on our WAYF pages (Nature WAYF and Springer WAYF) is taken from the metadata associated with your entity id. If you have two entity ids (one for Nature and one for SpringerLink) and the display names within the metadata are the same, then your users will see your institution name listed twice on the WAYF pages. If they choose the correct one for that site, then they will authenticate; if not, it won't work.\n\nWe recommend amending your entity IDs to avoid confusion (for example 'Company, Inc. (Springer)' & 'Company, Inc. (Nature)')."
