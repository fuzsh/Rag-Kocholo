        "text": "I found myself at the LF sale this weekend, surrounded by screaming teenage girls. How did I know they were teenagers? Aside from the obvious, they were still shopping with their mothers. No offense to mine because I love her dearly but by now, we’ve learned shopping is best conducted as a solo mission. After listening to a high pitched series of chants involving words like “sooooo cute”, “I looooove it”, and “ohmygosh” coming from the dressing rooms, I found myself wondering: should I be really shopping here?\n\nWith 30 right around the corner, I have some preconceived notions of what ladies at that age wear: the J.Crew catalogue. Don’t get me wrong, I definitely picked up that catalogue for inspiration last week but I’m not ready to look like I’m from Connecticut just yet. At least not every day. After some reflection, I realized that while I may have just purchased the exact same crop top as a 14 year old, I definitely wasn’t intending to wear it the same way. It’s all about pairings. I mean what else have we learned from all those girls weekends spent wine tasting?\n\nOne of my favorite ways to pair is the matching set like this one from WAYF. Yes, it’s still a crop top but it’s far from what you would see on an angsty teen wearing a Jansport backpack. It’s the perfect date night look that shows a little skin in the most tasteful way. When channeling date night looks, I lean toward pops of red and I always go tasteful. Whether it’s speculation or Matt doing an incredible job at subconsciously training me, I’ve learned guys love red. Heck, guys love a little edge too which makes the rockstuds on this clutch perfect. Not to mention, it was a gift from him and you know how happy guys get when you wear their gifts.\n\nWAYF matching set (crop and skirt) | ASOS heels (in case your size is sold out, try these!) | E&J sunglasses | Valentino bag | Gorjana snake ring\n\nShare this post:"
