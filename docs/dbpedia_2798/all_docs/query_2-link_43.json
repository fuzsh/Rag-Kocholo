        "text": "The EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is the EU's tool to put a fair price on the carbon emitted during the production of carbon intensive goods that are entering the EU, and to encourage cleaner industrial production in non-EU countries.\n\nBy confirming that a price has been paid for the embedded carbon emissions generated in the production of certain goods imported into the EU, the CBAM will ensure the carbon price of imports is equivalent to the carbon price of domestic production, and that the EU's climate objectives are not undermined. The CBAM is designed to be compatible with WTO-rules.\n\nCBAM will apply in its definitive regime from 2026, while the current transitional phase lasts between 2023 and 2025. This gradual introduction of the CBAM is aligned with the phase-out of the allocation of free allowances under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) to support the decarbonisation of EU industry.\n\nOn 1 October 2023, the CBAM entered into application in its transitional phase, with the first reporting period for importers ending 31 January 2024. The gradual phasing in of CBAM allows for a careful, predictable and proportionate transition for EU and non-EU businesses, as well as for public authorities.\n\nThe CBAM will initially apply to imports of certain goods and selected precursors whose production is carbon intensive and at most significant risk of carbon leakage: cement, iron and steel, aluminium, fertilisers, electricity and hydrogen. With this enlarged scope, CBAM will eventually – when fully phased in – capture more than 50% of the emissions in ETS covered sectors. The objective of the transitional period is to serve as a pilot and learning period for all stakeholders (importers, producers and authorities) and to collect useful information on embedded emissions to refine the methodology for the definitive period.\n\nDuring this period, importers of goods in the scope of the new rules will only have to report greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) embedded in their imports (direct and indirect emissions), without the need to buy and surrender certificates. Indirect emissions will be covered in the scope after the transitional period for some sectors (cement and fertilisers), on the basis of a defined methodology outlined in the Implementing Regulation published on 17 August 2023 and its accompanying guidance.\n\nThe Implementing Regulation on reporting requirements and methodology provides for some flexibility when it comes to the values used to calculate embedded emissions on imports during the transitional phase. Until the end of 2024, companies will have the choice of reporting in three ways: (a) full reporting according to the new methodology (EU method); (b) reporting based on an equivalent method (three options); and (c) reporting based on default reference values (only until July 2024).\n\nAs of 1 January 2025, only the EU method will be accepted and estimates (including default values) can only be used for complex goods if these estimations represent less than 20% of the total embedded emissions. The Commission published default values on 22 December 2023. This report from the EU’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) fed into the preparation of those default values.\n\nThe Commission has also developed dedicated IT tools to help importers perform and report these calculations, as well as in-depth guidance, training materials and tutorials to support businesses in this transitional phase.\n\nA review of the CBAM's functioning during its transitional phase will be concluded before the entry into force of the definitive system. At the same time, the product scope will be reviewed to assess the feasibility of including other goods produced in sectors covered by the EU ETS in the scope of the CBAM mechanism, such as certain downstream products and those identified as suitable candidates during negotiations. The report will include a timetable setting out their inclusion by 2030.\n\nSectors covered in the first phase of the CBAM - our environmental policy tool to help maximise the European and global impact of our fight against climate change.\n\nCEMENTIRON & STEELALUMINIUMFERTILISERSELECTRICITYHYDROGEN\n\nWhere to report\n\nThe Commission has developed the CBAM transitional registry to help importers perform and report as part of their CBAM obligations. Access to the registry should be requested through the National Competent Authority (NCA) of the Member State in which the importer is established.\n\nCBAM Transitional Registry – Link for importers\n\nThe provided link is accessible solely to importers who have been duly registered by the relevant National Competent Authorities.\n\nIf you haven't yet registered and you wish to access the registry, kindly reach out to the NCA of your respective Member State. Otherwise, unauthorised access to the registry is prohibited.\n\nCBAM reporting declarants will find in the CBAM Transitional Registry User Manual an XSD file describing the full structure of the CBAM quarterly report, as well as a sample ZIP file, which may be uploaded in the Registry to fill in automatically the quarterly report’s data. For convenience, the XSD and the sample ZIP files can also be downloaded below.\n\nIn addition, the Commission has prepared a specific guidance document for declarants, which outline the functioning and step-by-step use of the “request delay” options in the CBAM Transitional Registry.\n\nThe CBAM Transitional Registry is continuously enriched with IT updates and fixes (see attachment below for the latest update).\n\nTransitional CBAM Registry user manual for Declarants\n\nAs of June 11th, Release 1.2.1 is in production. The latest features are highlighted in the slide below.\n\nMost important features for the Declarant Portal for release CBAM 1.2.2.0\n\nGuidance for declarants - “Request Delayed Submission”\n\nQuarterly Report\n\nCBAM Quarterly Report structure XSD and “stypes.xsd” (ZIP format)\n\nCBAM Quarterly Report sample file for representatives\n\nCBAM Quarterly Report sample file for importers\n\nCBAM Quarterly Report structure (XLS format)\n\ncontains the \"Error Messages Glossary\" tab mentionned below\n\nThis XLS file can be used by CBAM Declarants to facilitate completion of the CBAM quarterly reports using XML files. The XLS file indicates which are the optional/mandatory fields and provides the pre-defined values that are allowed for specific fields.\n\nCourse Video - Quarterly Report XML Upload TutorialVideo available here.\n\nFurthermore the “Error Messages Glossary” tab is providing guidance on how the user can overcome the validation error messages displayed whenever a validation rule/condition is triggered due to an issue with the field values filled/selected by the user.\n\nError messages explained\n\nCourse Video - Declarant acts as Indirect Customs RepresentativeVideo available here.Course Video - Importer for some Goods / Indirect Customs Representative for some GoodsVideo available here.Course Video - Declarant acts as Importer for all GoodsVideo available here.\n\nHow to access the transitional registry\n\nAccess to the Transitional CBAM registry should be requested through the National Competent Authority (NCA) of the Member State in which the importer is established.\n\nProvisional list of National Competent Authorities (NCAs) for the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism\n\nThe recording of an info session on the CBAM Transitional Registry can be found here.\n\nCBAM Transitional Registry Privacy Statement"
