        "text": "The last time I interviewed actor, director and changemaker Justin Baldoni was in 2017, right before he delivered his now viral TEDTalk “Why I’m Done Trying to Be Man Enough,” which has been viewed over 8 million times. Since then, his exploration into what it means to be a man today, which began for him as a personal inquiry, has evolved into the Man Enough Movement, founded on the belief that by “undefining traditional roles and traits of masculinity, men will be able to realize their potential as humans and their capacity for connection.” He has written a book, Man Enough: Undefining My Masculinity, and co-hosts the popular Man Enough podcast, along with author and journalist Liz Plank and award-winning music producer Jamey Heath. The video podcast features thoughtful, candid conversations with a wide array of celebrities and thought leaders talking about relationships, body image, success, parenthood, mental health and more, investigating “how traditional structures and attitudes toward masculinity oppress and negatively affect men, women and humanity as a whole.”\n\nA former actor who starred in the hit show Jane the Virgin and saw untapped potential in the power of media, Baldoni turned to filmmaking and cofounded Wayfarer Studios aimed at “upending the traditional Hollywood studio model by putting equity and social justice at the forefront.” They achieve this not only by developing projects that can “serve as true agents for social change” but also by “hiring executives, creators and filmmakers who reflect the diverse world we live in—more women and people of color than is typical at most Hollywood companies—and establishing a creator-friendly environment where writers and directors share in the success of the studio.” Baldoni recently directed Clouds, the company’s first feature film, available on Disney+. As he told me, he hopes to “create content that challenges the status quo, asks us to think a little bit differently and forces us to go in and reexamine some areas in our own lives.”\n\nI recently had the opportunity to speak with Baldoni about his journey of challenging traditional masculinity, the overall impacts it has on our society, his mission to enact social change through his media projects, the most important message he wants to instill in his children and more. Here are some highlights from our interview.\n\nMarianne Schnall: You wrote this incredible book, Man Enough, and you now have this amazing podcast where you're exploring these themes even further. Why has challenging traditional masculinity become your main focus, and what are you most hoping to achieve?\n\nJustin Baldoni: Truthfully, it feels like a responsibility, like an obligation–something that, because I am aware of it, I can no longer just continue living with blinders on. I feel an obligation to my children, to my wife, to my friends, to my parents. I'm somebody who always wants to work on myself. I don't believe in complacency. And so much of this work is healing for me also, so it's an obligation to myself. For me, this is a radical act of self-love. Using whatever little platform I have to talk about these issues forces me to learn in real time, forces me to go deeper, forces me to not allow the bar to be so low that I can just crawl over it and get a pat on the back.\n\nIt's also for all of the women in my life who continue to tell me unbelievable stories that you just can't imagine [still exist today]. It's my wonderful assistant who is so tired of needing to put me on the phone to be taken seriously by other men. It's my inability to connect with other men in my kids’ school because they're shut down and they don't know how to communicate. It's all of these types of things. And it's for our future. Crazy enough, it's for climate change. It's for peace. I believe all of this work connects to a more loving, peaceful, kind future. And my little tiny piece of it is hopefully one of the billions of bricks that will go into building this bridge to the next generation.\n\nSchnall: What are the overall impacts of men having to repress their emotions and not be able to be their full selves?\n\nBaldoni: Just turn on the news. Look at what's happening around the world. Look at politics, climate change, sexual assault and rape cases, suicides, crime–it intersects with all of it. I don't think you could separate the conversation of masculinity in men with all of the current events happening around the world that make us feel so hopeless at times.\n\nSchnall: How is all of this linked to what we traditionally call “women’s issues”–for example, how violence against women is connected to how we socialize men or how the challenges women face in the workplace are connected to how our society doesn’t encourage men to be caretakers, or makes it “unmanly” to take on household responsibilities or stigmatizes men for taking family leave?\n\nBaldoni: That's a huge one right now: family leave and men. In the Scandinavian countries, they have incredible family leave programs that are very equal–you have men and women who get a chance to take a tremendous amount of family leave when they have a newborn, but what they found is, even in those countries, the men won't take it. My sister-in-law and brother-in-law live in Sweden. They just welcomed this beautiful little baby girl, and it was so sweet. And I’ve got to be honest, I was so damn jealous that he got a chance to stay at home for months with her, and they did it together. Research shows that if both parents take the time off at the same time, it's better for the child, so what they're doing is investing in the future of their country by allowing parents to take time off to connect with their newborn and hopefully create a more empathetic, compassionate, kind, smart child that will eventually lead their country.\n\nBut what they found was that the men were not taking the time off because of the way it would look, because even in those progressive countries, men still battle with the patriarchy, they still battle with this dominant pyramid-scheme culture that says, “If you're not showing up for work, you're a slacker and someone else is better suited for that job.” So there was this underlying, subconscious, unwritten rule that if you were a new father and you took time off, or at least the full time off, then you are not seen as a great employee. So what they had to do was institute this idea of “take it or leave it,” where they're just going to take it away–like you get this once and then it's gone, and it's gone forever. Then they noticed that men started taking it more. So they had to use reverse psychology just to battle these ingrained ideas of masculinity and what it means to be a good employee versus a good father and husband just to get men to take this time off. When I see that, and then I see how far we are behind–and of course we're making some progress, thank God–it's just like, oh my goodness, we have such a long way to go.\n\nSchnall: How has your journey and all that you've learned in your work affected how you raise both your son and your daughter?\n\nBaldoni: From the very beginning, I've been teaching my kids that the strongest muscle in their body is their heart. And I am doing that for a reason, specifically for my boy, because the world is going to tell him to grow up and have a strong body, and they're going to forget the heart. And for most of us men, we've lost that connection at a very young age and severed the connection between ourselves and our hearts.\n\nTrying to teach my boy that the heart is the strongest muscle has been a journey. And I know that no matter what I do, the world is going to put my daughter in a box and my son in a box. They’re going to tell my daughter that she has to be polite and behaved and sweet and not take up too much space and not use a loud voice and be gentle and nurturing and all of the various things. And they're going to tell my son the opposite: that boys will be boys, that being rowdy is okay, that you should take physical risks, that you should take up space, that you can be loud and crack jokes–they're going to teach him that that's acceptable behavior. So in some ways, what my wife and I are doing is reversing that and building a foundation on the opposing idea. So reinforcing in my daughter that it's okay for her to take up space and be loud and have an opinion and be athletic and take physical risks and all of these various things. And with my son, really reinforcing in him the idea that being a boy is about being kind and that being sensitive and sweet is beautiful. That crying and showing his feelings and emotions is the most manly boy thing that he could do. And how do I do that? I have to model that; Daddy does that. It's being nurturing. It's being compassionate and empathetic.\n\nThe more I can build that strong foundation, I believe the stronger the tree will be, and the more flexible it will be. Like a palm tree in a hurricane, he'll be able to bend and go with the socialization that's coming his way without losing his sense of self. Will it work? I have no idea, because those hurricane gale-force winds of socialization are very strong and they might uproot it, but as long as he is in my home, I can model what that healthy masculinity looks like. That's what we're doing right now, and that's what I would encourage anybody who's open to this idea to think about: make sure that we are reinforcing the opposing ideas of the narrative of what socialization will teach our children about gender and roles.\n\nSchnall: As the cofounder of Wayfarer Studios, which develops projects that create social change, how do you see the role of media and its ability to shift consciousness?\n\nBaldoni: I think media is directly intertwined with all of it. It's a part of capitalism. It's in many ways a Trojan horse–we have to be in it, show that we can be successful doing it, and do it in a way that disrupts the system and helps us all wake up. How do we go against the grain and do things differently in an industry that rewards a certain type of behavior and doing things a certain way? How do we create content that challenges the status quo, that asks us to think a little bit differently, that forces us to go in and reexamine some areas in our own lives that are uncomfortable, that gives people a microphone that maybe they haven't had the chance to hold in a while? That's what we're trying to do.\n\nWe just finished four films–two of them documentaries, two of them feature-length films. Two of them are on social and racial justice issues, and one of them is a teen comedy about female empowerment and body positivity from an incredible female first-time writer/director. It’s just really exciting to see what's possible. We're talking about changing culture and having this conversation around masculinity. That's our goal; it's a really exciting goal, and I'm just grateful that I get the chance in this lifetime to even pursue it.\n\nFor more information, visit Man Enough and Wayfarer Studios.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and brevity."
