        "text": "Tab 1: Create application\n\nYour name, civil registration number and e-mail address will be at the top of this page\n\nUnder \"Choose place of education\", you choose Copenhagen Business School\n\nSingle subject as a guest student: choose this option if you are enrolled in another educational institution and want to have the courses you take at CBS credit transferred to your own study programme.\n\nStudent Place Vacancy: choose this option if you want take single courses af CBS which you will be paying for yourself.\n\nThen click \"Search\" and a list of available types of education will appear:\n\nChoose either the bachelor or graduate and click on the button \"Create application\"\n\nAt the next step, you state your nationality. This field is filled in per default, so please proceed by clicking \"Create application\"\n\nYou have now moved to the next step of the application process. A process bar will inform you of the different steps before you can submit your application.\n\nPlease note that you cannot navigate the process by using the \"back\" and \"forward\" buttons on the browser. Instead, you must navigate back and forth by using the process bar.\n\nNon EU/EEA citizen\n\nPlease note! If your nationality is not Danish or Nordic, you have to provide documentation of a residence permit in Denmark. Later on in the application, you need to provide this documentation.\n\nExplanation for selected steps in the process bar\n\nPerson\n\nIn the step \"Person\", some of your data will already have been retrieved from your WAYFlogin. Just state your telephone number and a private address, on which we can reach you.\n\nYou will be presented to the abbreviations: WAYF, MAN, and DANS. This means that your information already has been retrieved via different systems (WAYF and DANS), or that you have to enter them yourself manually (MAN).\n\nRequirements and prerequisites\n\nIf you apply as a credit transfer student, you must upload your preapproval here. If you do not have your preapproval yet, select the option “Will be forwarded later”. If you choose this option, you will receive an e-mail about when you will be able to access your application again to upload your preapproval. The preapproval is a prerequisite for admission to a course as a credit transfer student and must be uploaded before semester start.\n\nIf you apply as a single course student (Student Place Vacancy), you will not be asked for a preapproval.\n\nNationality\n\nIf you have stated that you are a non-EU/EEA citizen but you have a residence permit, you will be asked to upload documentation for this.\n\nOther\n\nNow you need to fill out how many courses you wish to apply for. It is very important that you only write numbers 1, 2, 3 or 4. If you are a credit transfer student, you can only choose the number of courses that you can get credit transfered to your studies.\n\nYou now have to fill in which courses you want to apply for:\n\nYou can choose up to 8 priorities and these will be distributed according to the order of priority.\n\nEach priority must contain a course code and title: eg. BHAAV2389U or CCMVV1583U. It may be a good idea to copy paste course codes directly from our homepage.\n\nPlease note: in some cases the course code has prefix BA- or KAN- e.g. BA-BHAAV2389U or KAN-CCMVV1583U. This prefix should NOT be included in the application.\n\nYou can find all courses offered in the given semester on cbs.dk See courses at bachelor level or courses at graduate level\n\nYou cannot apply for courses that are \"cancelled\" or \"closed for further enrollment\"\n\nShow the application\n\nHere you can see what you have indicated and uploaded to your application.\n\nSubmit the application\n\nSubmit the application electronically to CBS by clicking \"Submit application\".\n\nAs soon as you have submitted your application, you are no longer able to edit it, unless the caseworker returns it and asks for additional information. However, you can still view and read all the applications you have submitted under the step \"See application status\"."
