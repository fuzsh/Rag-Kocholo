He worked for someone here in Gippsland that had the agency for Wayfarer in the late 60s or thereabouts.\n\n...Spoke to my father in law briefly this morning. I think I have probably \"over promised and under delivered\" on the info side. Anyway, he told me his involvement with Wayfarer vans was late sixties. At that stage Wayfarer were building vans in Melbourne - he was pretty sure it was Springvale, as he visited the factory there at the time. Not sure if they built in other states also at the time? Next time he's round I'll show him the pics and ask if he knows anything about the vintage etc of yours (I'm tipping it would be before his Wayfarer days).\n\nPost by Don Ricardo on\n\nHi all,\n\nCan anyone help sort out this puzzle about Wayfarer caravans.\n\nCuz wrote on 22 April 2009\n\n...i bought a Wayfarer a few years back, took some pics, looked up Wayfarer in the phone book and got onto a bloke who used to work for them years ago who bought the trading name. After showing him the pics he said mine was a 59 model. Strange thing is that it is exactly the same inside and out as a Globetrotter. He told me that my van was made in Ballarat where Wayfarer farmed out work. I assume two companies produced the same style van. My van has been registered as a Wayfarer from new. It even has the same plaque as Globetrotters used located at the front of the left set of overheads. Strange goings on in those days.\n\nBill\n\nThen on 20 September 2009, Raym wrote:\n\nHi all Wayfarer not only built their own van but engaged in badge engineering. They sold other manufactures vans and added their name to them. My father built Broadway caravans but he sold on consignment to Wayfarer who put their name on the vans.These were sold in Warracknabeal victoria. Dad or his partner John would leave Adelaide in either of their 1950 or1951 Humber Super Snipe cars with a van in tow to meet the rep from Wayfarer at 11 oclock in Bordertown for him to take delivery of the van. They would then return to Adelaide and go to the factory pick up the hammer and start work on the next one. Ray\n\nQuestions:\n\n(1) Did Wayfarer 'badge engineer' both Globetrotter and Broadway caravans?\n\n(2) Is the caravan in Reply #1 above (the one with an FX balanced on top of it!) a Globetrotter or a Broadway?\n\n(3) Is the Model J Wayfarer caravan in Reply #3 above a Globetrotter or a Broadway?\n\n(4) Did Globetrotter ever produce caravans in Ballarat as Cuz was told, or were they an exclusively South Australian manufacturer.\n\nAnswers to any of the above would add to our knowledge base on Wayfarer caravans.\n\nDon Ricardo\n\nPost by Don Ricardo on\n\nHi Dave,\n\nThanks for your comments about your Wayfarer. I agree that your van doesn't look like any of the pics of GlobeTrotter vans on the GlobeTrotter thread in the DHL section, nor does it look like a Broadway. Maybe your Wayfarer was one of the vans actually built by Wayfarer itself and not a badge engineered van from another manufacturer?\n\nAs it happens I've done a bit more digging and as a result may be able to throw a bit of light on a couple of questions I asked in my post last night. I reckon that both of the Wayfarer vans I referred to were probably built by GlobeTrotter:\n\nCompare the Wayfarer in this advert posted above by Franklin1...\n\n...with the photo of this GlobeTrotter posted by 313Royal on 27 April 2008...\n\nSame shape, same side profile and roof line (as much as you can tell with an FX sitting on top of the van ), same paint job and side stripe, same placement of logo. One difference is the shape of the wheel arch, but the Wayfarer looks like it's a Globetrotter to me.\n\nNow compare the Wayfarer Model 'J' in this advert, also posted above by Franklin1...\n\n...with this pic of a GlobeTrotter posted by 313Royal...\n\nSame shape, same side profile and roof line, same paint job and side decoration, same placement of logo, same reinforcement of the A-frame with steel tubing. Looks like a GlobeTrotter to me.\n\nAccording to Franklin1 both the Wayfarer adverts copied to this post were dated 1958, although the design of the first van (the one with the FX on the roof) looks older than the Model 'J' van. Having said that one of 313Royal's photos on the DHL GlobeTrotter thread shows both caravans on display together at what appears to be a caravan show.\n\nBut wait there's more! As shown above, Franklin1 magnified the GlobeTrotter logo on the pics provided by 313Royal. The logo on the Model 'J' equivalent clearly says 'Globe Trotter' (see pics above). But, have a careful look at this pair of photos again:\n\nIn his post, Franklin1 commented: \"the first word doesn't clearly look like Globe, because the 'b' is the wrong shape (looks more like a 'y' or something like that)...\".\n\nLooking at the logo in the context of this discussion, the words look very like 'Way farer' to me...\n\nCould it be? What do others think?\n\nDon Ricardo (who perhaps is beginning to see things )\n\nAddendum:\n\nJust after posting the above I came across Winterwood's post showing the original paperwork for his 1964 GlobeTrotter here. The Globe logo on the envelope and the order form consists of a drawing of a caravan with an FX on its roof, as shown in the Wayfarer advert.\n\nCase closed, I guess...\n\n...except that we still have to work out which Wayfarers were actually Broadway vans in disguise. Maybe Raym can tell us more?\n\nPost by Franklin1 on\n\nBy jingo, DonR...remind me to never commit a crime in your neighbourhood!!\n\nYou should change your log-in name to Sherlock Ricardo! ;D\n\nThe thing that doesn't add up in my mind about all these brands from the late 1950s is the number of vans registered Australia-wide back then, versus the number of different brands we've come across.\n\nThe archives tell me that there were 3425 caravans registered Australia-wide in 1958, of which 2870 were complete, and 555 were shells and pre-cut kits.\n\nIn 1956, Carapark were claiming to be making \"more caravans than all the other manufacturers in the Commonwealth combined\". So if we assume Carapark was still a force-to-be-reckoned-with in 1958, then lets give them half of the 3425 vans.\n\nWhich leaves 1710 of other brands.\n\nIn 1959, Globe Trotter claimed they were the leading manufacturer in South Australia. So how many of the 1710 should we give them? 10%? 20%? Let's give them 20% (340 vans), which is about 6 vans made each week.\n\nWhich leaves 1370 of other brands.\n\nHow many brands have we discovered? A gazillion? What's 1370 divided by a gazillion? Some of these smaller manufacturers can't have been making many vans per week, eh? Or, maybe they weren't making any at all, and were just pinching other builds and whacking their name on them.\n\nIt seems like the South Australian industry, being somewhat remote from the Victorian market (the largest back then) and the NSW market (the second largest), were only too keen to see their vans infiltrate those two states. The Globe Trotters, the Rowe vans, and the Broadway vans apparently pop up in disguise in a number of places, it seems.\n\nBut...I digress.\n\nNice bit of detective work there, DonR! ;D\n\nYou haven't seen my glasses anywhere, have you??\n\ncheers,\n\nAl.\n\nPost by Don Ricardo on\n\nDor Ricardo, I wonder if the \"Wayfarer\" badge on the Kennedy merely indicates the model, rather than the manufacturer? I notice that the knight's head is missing, which seems to be their trademark.\n\nRay\n\nHi Ray,\n\nI can see what you're driving at. The helmet does seem to have become part of the Wayfarer logo during the 60's - maybe the mid-60's? However, the earlier Wayfarers don't seem to have used the helmet symbol. The ones sourced from Globe Trotter seem to have used the Globe Trotter kangaroo, for example.\n\nTo my mind, the similarity between the Wayfarer nameplate on Exocet's Kennedy is close enough to the Wayfarer name used in advertising at the beginning of the 60's to think that they are from the same company. Check out this 1960 advert (copied from Reply #2 above) with the nameplate on Exocet's van:\n\nFrom that I think that Exocet's van was sold as a Wayfarer, not that Wayfarer was a Kennedy model name. I don't think that enough Kennedys were sold for them to get to model names.\n\nMaybe we can ask Overlanda at the Victorian VV Christmas do, seeing he now owns the Wayfarer name, etc? Are you in Victoria at the moment and are you coming to the do?\n\nDon Ricardo"
