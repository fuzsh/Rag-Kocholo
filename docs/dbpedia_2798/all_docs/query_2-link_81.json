        "text": "I recently thought I was purchasing a great deal from Facebook. There was an advertisement coming from Wayfair for a five-piece outdoor furniture set with cushions selling for $89.99. When I submitted the order, no email was coming back from Wayfair for the confirmation. Instead, it was a suspicious SCAM/FRAUD SELLER ending with 163.com. I was furious and immediately called my bank to stop this transaction. My bank told me to call Paypal and sure enough, that amount was already on my account. Paypal is NO HELP! I checked the status of this dispute and just like everyone else, it was CLOSED! The Seller gave Paypal a fictitious tracking number that was sent by USPS. This SCAM Artist is from China and there is no fringing way that USPS will ship Outdoor Furniture to be placed in a mailbox! I'm furious, because I lost $112.00. I'm looking into this further and will blast this all over Facebook about this SCAM and also how PayPal will not help!\n\nLooking for help or advice from this Community to see if anyone else had similar problems with this!\n\nhe same issue on Marketplace under their Sponsered listings. I paid the same 89.99 and 20 minutes later after noticing the scam I called Paypal to get them to reverse the charge as it is a scam. The reply I got was that Well we have to give it time to see if the seller ships the item. Ive been waiting 3 weeks and finally after the seller gives a fake tracking number Paypal sides in thier favor. This is flat out fraud! And seems Paypal must be in on the scam or something. You should be able to cancel a transaction if you feel there maybe an error or foul play and not give these scammer days or weeks to run off with our money. Something needs to be put in place to protect online consumers from these types of scams. A simple way to cancel within 24hr if need be.\n\n@temp20222506\n\nPaypal is a payment processor, so they sent the payment YOU requested to be sent to the seller of your choice.\n\nThey can't turn around and snatch it back again because you made a mistake.\n\nPaypal covers you for non receipt of item OR item received but not as described (terms and conditions as per buyer protection policy).\n\nThey do not cover you for 'changed mind' or 'bought from a scam seller'.\n\nSo .............\n\nDisputes for non receipt of item are mostly automated. Seller provides tracking that shows delivery = seller wins.\n\nSo then its your turn to do some work to assist Paypal in recovering your purchase price from your seller.\n\nFirstly ring customer services and tell them that the number is fake or that the item was shown as shipped before you purchased it. With that information they may well just issue you a refund.\n\nSecondly if they don't then... APPEAL\n\nTo submit an appeal on the dispute that was closed, PayPal asks that you obtain a detailed report from the shipper/courier (on their letterhead or some other form of official stationary) that includes the address the seller gave them for the shipment. Or one that includes a statement mentioning your address and saying the item was delivered to a different address. THEY DON'T HAVE TO SAY WHICH ADDRESS IT WAS SENT TO, JUST THAT IT WAS NOT DELIVERED TO YOUR ADDRESS.\n\nCheck tracking in below link to see where it went.\n\nhttps://www.17track.net/en\n\nWhen you have that, contact PayPal via phone (log on to your account and click contact at the bottom of the page, or via Facebook (send a Private Message to PayPal) or via Twitter (send a Direct Message to @AskPayPal) and say you want to appeal the denial of the dispute based on the shipper saying the item was delivered to a different address. Once it's submitted (you will be provided with directions on how to do that), the dispute will be reviewed further and a determination will be made.\n\nYou also have the option to contact your card issuer if you funded your paypal payment that way and see if they will do a chargeback for you.\n\nAdvice is voluntary.\n\nKudos / Solution appreciated."
