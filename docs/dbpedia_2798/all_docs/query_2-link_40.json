My family and I landed at 7am this morning (yawn!) and are off for a full day of exploring. The best way to beat jet lag, in my opinion! (Constant espresso and gelato stops don’t hurt, either.)\n\nI’m giddy to share today’s look with you, because I can genuinely say it’s one of my very favorites of the season! I wear a lot of dresses around here, so for me to say that this is the one white dress under $100 you need means I must really love it.\n\nIntroducing your go-to summer frock, this romantic off the shoulder dress! Doesn’t it look straight out of a movie? I purchased it when shopping for this Italy trip, and was floored to find it looked even better on than I had expected.\n\nThe silhouette is gorgeously flattering, and I love the slightly loose off the shoulder neckline… it creates an almost whimsical femininity to the dress that I adore!\n\nI am looking forward to wearing this during one of our evenings in Cortona, Italy. It’s called the Wine Dine Shine dinner, where a few of the local purveyors (jewelry, wine, etc) get together to throw a dinner party in their different shops! My parents travel to this town often and have been telling my sister and I about this event for what feels like forever. I can’t wait to experience it in this beauty!\n\nLove from Texas,\n\nKate"
