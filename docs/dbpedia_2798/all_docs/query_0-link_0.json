        "text": "Our Story\n\nDesigner and owner Meredith Fisher continues to bring affordable luxury to the contemporary market with her label, WAYF (Where Are You From). It was during a high school internship with designer Jennifer Nicholson that the Kentucky native's designs were picked up by Los Angeles boutique, Satine. Within weeks, Fisher's color blocked silk dresses had caught the eye of celebrity stylist Rachel Zoe, and fashion's societal muses, the Olsen twins. With the buzz generated by Satine, Fisher launched her first WAYF collection. In its first seasons, the collection was picked up by retailers around the world, including Barneys New York, Intermix and Selfridges. Fisher incorporates the design philosophies that were at the foundation of this first collection in her expanded lifestyle brand WAYF. Now sold at retailers such as Nordstrom, Bloomingdaleâ€™s, Shopbop and Revolve, WAYF is the perfect addition to every fashion savvy wardrobe."
