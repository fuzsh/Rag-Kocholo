        "text": "Thank you so much for doing this with us! Before we dig in, our readers would like to get to know you a bit. Can you tell us a bit about how you grew up?\n\nI grew up in Belgium. My mother is Belgian and my father is from New Zealand, as such I had the immense privilege of traveling across the globe from a very young age.\n\nThese family trips ignited my passion for travel, which turned into a career.\n\nEveryone has a cataclysmic moment or marker in their life which propels them to take certain actions, a “why”. What is your why?\n\nA few years ago, my life was in utter chaos; I was going through a hard divorce and had just walked away from a high-paying corporate job. So I decided to turn to the one thing that still made sense: Travel. I packed up my life into boxed and embarked on a seven-month journey. I was thirty at the time, traveling solo, and in no mood to share my room with a bunch of boisterous youngsters playing beer pong. So I veered away from hostels and instead opted for local homestays and Couchsurfing. This meant I was spending time with locals, spending my tourism dollars at local establishments where they made a difference. I started documenting my travels, and thus my travel blog was born.\n\nYou are currently leading an organization that is making a difference for our planet. Can you tell us a bit about what you and your organization are trying to change?\n\nI run an award-winning blog and have a sizeable social media presence. My clients are mainly tourism boards and hospitality businesses who are slowly but surely veering towards sustainable practices. ‘Sustainability’ is the buzzword of 2023 and 2024. It seems like everyone and their cat is green and sustainable. It is my job to cut through the greenwashing and find those rare gems that do make a difference and give them a platform. It is work in progress, but my mission is to make sustainable travel accessible for everyone. To help the average Joe cut through the beautifully phrased, utter void, marketing terminology and put them in touch with local businesses.\n\nCan you share the most interesting story that happened to you since you began leading your company or organization?\n\nOne of my key pillars of sustainability travel is to explore lesser-known locations. A few years back I traveled to Iran, despite a lot of pressure from close friends and family. When I announced on social media that I was planning this trip, I was inundated with messages, many of them very negative.\n\nSo it was ok for me to travel and share my experiences, but not everywhere? This was the first time I encountered this level of prejudice about a specific destination. It turned out the be one of the most wholesome experiences, and is still my number one destination to this day. Never have I felt such warmth and hospitality as when I stayed in little inns and local family homes in Iran. As I shared my experiences along the journey, there was a noticeable shift in perception from my followers and readers. People started viewing the country through different eyes, unlearning the false narrative portrayed by Western media.\n\nNone of us can be successful without some help along the way. Did you have mentors or cheerleaders who helped you to succeed? Can you tell us a story about their influence?\n\nThe beauty of living in a small country and working within a niche industry is the tight-knit community. I have always strongly disagreed with the notion of gatekeeping information and have always freely distributed knowledge to fellow travel writers asking for help. Each voice has a different story to tell, so why not help them amplify their voice. This way of working has meant that when I hit a speedbump in the road, am ready to throw in the towel or am just genuinely having a rough day, there is usually a sympathetic ear around. My partner is a former McKinsey consultant and has a very rational and methodical brain, he is oftentimes my voice of reason, helping me keep the boat afloat in the sometimes muddy waters.\n\nThank you for that. Let’s now move to the central part of our discussion. Let’s start with a basic definition of terms so that everyone is on the same page. What does climate justice mean to you? How do we operationalize it?\n\nScience is telling us that we have 7–10 years to make critical decisions about climate change. What are three things you or your organization are doing to help?\n\nINFORM: For many the idea of climate change is a heavy topic and, unfortunately, something which is “happening out there”. find that oftentimes whenever I hear about climate change there is a lot of science-heavy terminology being thrown around and there is an assumption that people have understood the need for action. We must not forget that it is a privilege to be able to make time to read and study about climate change. Let’s not underestimate the amount of people that are merely trying to get through their day. What I try and do with VeggieWayfarer is break things down into more bitesize pieces of information, to connect the dots for people, without making them feel like a. I am lecturing and b. shameful for not knowing.\n\nCREATE AGENCY: A key component in the fight for climate change is to create agency within individuals. Bring them into the fold of knowledge (by informing them) and then provide them with the tools to make a difference. A concrete example could be to inform consumers of budget-friendly alternatives when it comes to purchasing fast fashion: Purchase second-hand, swap clothes with friends, and find brands that have a transparent production process (ethical treatment of workers & use of sustainable materials). Or perhaps showing travelers that by taking a night train instead of a flight they save a night in the hotel, they get to connect with locals and they might just have a much more relaxed onward journey. The key is to provide a variety of different options so they — and this is the crux of the matter — can actively choose an alternative.\n\nCREATE A PLATFORM FOR OTHERS: As a travel website, I try and connect visitors to a specific destination with the locally run businesses of said destination. These locally run businesses work with local suppliers thus creating a cascade effect ensuring that tourism money benefits the local economy and not to line the pockets of an already affluent conglomerate.\n\nAre there three things the community, society, or politicians can do to help you in your mission?\n\nI think the main thing we can do as a politician is to stimulate new behaviors and habits by taking away the barrier to entry. It is a privilege to be able to travel, and even more so to do so sustainably. People can simply not afford to spend triple the money on train fare versus airfare, nor should they to be honest. Reward your constituents for taking the train; make sure that places with high foot traffic have plastic-free, healthy food alternatives available and ensure they do not cost triple; place more drinking fountains around cities. The list is truly endless. As both a community and a society it is up to us to use our voice, and the power of our wallet to pressure politicians to make shifts in the legal framework. It really is a battle that needs to be fought on both ends, both top-down and grassroots.\n\nHow would you articulate how a business can become more profitable by being more sustainable and more environmentally conscious? Can you share a story or example?\n\nThe younger generation of consumers is much more implicated in the status of our planet, in the environment. They are hungry for change and willing to pay for brands that offer them an alternative. They are a lot more vocal and will sing praise of brands they think are credible, but equally, they will annihilate (advocate to cancel out) brands that they feel are greenwashing. It takes courage, means, and a lot of hard work for brands/services to switch to a more eco-conscious way of doing business but it is the future and the sooner brands hop on the brand wagon the more they have the first mover advantage. A concrete example would be H&M and its use of cotton produced by the Uyghurs in China or how the online shopping outlet Zalando reportedly destroys a large percentage of clothing that is sent back as it is “cheaper”. These stories are picked up, spread across social media platforms, and met with widespread outrage from the TikTok generation. There is no hiding\n\nThis is the signature question we ask in most of our interviews. What are your “5 things I wish someone told me when I first started promoting sustainability and climate justice” and why?\n\n1 . People will feel threatened: No matter which side of the story you are advocating for, it will be too much X or not enough Y. When I traveled to Bolivia to work with the local government I received an inordinate amount of messages stating that “my profession” was killing the planet because I was taking a flight and so I would do better to keep my mouth shut and stop “preaching”. When I was showcasing the wonderful work the local indigenous communities were doing in the Amazon, welcoming tourists in their villages and sharing the resources from tourism to build schools/infrastructure, I received an avalanche of comments ranging from “Who would ever stay in this type of place” to “you should not promote the amazon rainforest or the indigenous communities”.\n\n2 . Greenwashing PHDs should be awarded: As brands start picking up on the changing consumer trends, they try and capitalize on them. There is a plethora of so-called ‘green labels’ and a severe lack of governmental regulations/governing bodies that fact-check these labels. Take for example the labels that are placed on fish. You have sustainable fishing, responsible fishing, wild fishing, Dolphin Safe, MSC Blue Label, and a variety of labels placed on packaging by the wholesalers themselves. Not to mention the fact that many of these labels differ depending on the continent you are currently in. The same goes for hotels, tour operators, clothing, and just about any commodity or service.\n\n3 . It can get very lonely, fast: As I started down the path of sustainable travel, the hardest part of the process was saying “no” to shiny new destinations and fun-filled experiences with friends and family. Sticking to your guns is really hard when the people around you are playing a different game. Despite living in the capital of Europe, I had to actively go out and search for like-minded individuals to travel with. People who a. had the time and b. were willing to compromise to take the train/travel in an electric car for a road trip.\n\n4 . It is a very slow process: Change does not happen overnight. When I started out blogging about 5 years ago the only “sustainable” practice my clients in the tourism industry would have to offer was the option to rent a bike and cycle around. Now years later clients within Europe are open to reaching their destination via train (instead of flying), actively proposing farm-to-table restaurants, and promoting local artisans.\n\n5 . There is no room for perfectionism: Perfectionism will burn you out, isolate you, and in the end bring your work to a grinding halt. When I first started out I wanted to go as green as possible e.g. not flying anywhere, only eating organic/in season, not purchasing anything, and if I did get new items scouring the internet for a secondhand piece versus buying new. I was so focused on getting it perfect that I lost sight of my mission: To help make the process of transitioning to a more sustainable way of living/travel for others easier.\n\nIs there a person in the world, or in the US with whom you would like to have a private breakfast or lunch with, and why? He or she might just see this, especially if we tag them. :-)\n\nSir David Attenborough. He has managed to captivate audiences across the globe and spark interest for our planet, both fauna and flora. He shows us just how precious and precarious life is and the very tightrope we are currently walking when it comes to climate disaster.\n\nHe uses the power of words and strong visual images like nobody else in the industry. The man is an absolute legend and his documentary “Breaking Boundaries” had me laughing and crying at the same time. It is a warning, and simultaneously a message of hope.\n\nHow can our readers continue to follow your work online?\n\nFollow along my imperfect sustainable journey on socials (https://instagram.com/veggiewayfarer) or read along on https://www.veggiewayfarer.com\n\nThis was very meaningful, thank you so much.
