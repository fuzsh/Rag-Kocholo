Indicated by type="WAYF", this initiator refers the browser to a Shibboleth WAYF service. As a discovery handler, no entityID can be known (or the handler will silently ignore the request, since discovery would serve no purpose).

The design of this protocol results in the browser leaving the SP until a successful authentication response is returned. This is a legacy technique that limits the ability of an SP to effectively support newer protocols and more advanced features.
