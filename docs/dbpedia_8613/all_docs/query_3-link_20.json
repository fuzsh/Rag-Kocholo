        "text": "In his Mémoires, published in the year of his death in 1983, Raymond Aron—the French sociologist and Cold War champion of liberalism—astonishingly remarked that as a man of high culture Carl Schmitt could have never been a Nazi. Aron's defenders have typically downplayed his mature views on Schmitt: for how else could the main defender of the liberal faith in France devote himself to salvaging the reputation of the greatest antiliberal of the age? This essay argues, however, that Aron's bizarre statements about Schmitt actually provide a crucial aperture into the nature of Aron's liberalism. I will begin by placing Aron's comments about Schmitt within his Clausewitz project of the 1970s. Aron took Schmitt as a guiding inspiration even as he sought to overcome Schmitt's existential interpretation of Clausewitz. By doing so, Aron hoped to establish a rational foundation for political action. Yet Aron's attempt to contain Clausewitz would not only lead to a renewal of interest in Schmitt's thought; it would also revive Aron and Schmitt's correspondence that had lain dormant since the early 1960s. As the 1970s advanced, this would have implications for how Aron viewed Schmitt, especially in light of the critical German reception of Penser la guerre, Clausewitz. This essay concludes by looking at the intellectual legacy of Aron's Schmittian inspirations—at just the time he became the avatar of contemporary French liberalism\n\n24 Sternhell, Zeev's Ni droite ni gauche (Paris, 1983)Google Scholar; Levy, Bernard-Henri's L’idéologie française (Paris, 1981)Google Scholar. In 1983 de Jouvenel sued Sternhell for bringing to light his brief membership in the fascist Parti populaire français and his relationship with Otto Abetz, the German ambassador to France during the occupation. Aron, who was ill at the time, testified on behalf of de Jouvenel's defense that he “was one of the two or three leading political thinkers of his generation.” He also remarked that Sternhell's Ni droite ni gauche was “the most ahistorical book that I can conceive of. The author never places things in the context of events. He gives fascism a definition so vague and imprecise that it could refer to anyone. He loses sight of the fact that national socialism was, in the thirties, a theme which spread about Europe. It is true that we, the men of that generation, despaired about the weakness of democracy. We sensed that war was coming. So we dreamed. But it is inadmissible that this be used to defame people who are worthy of respect, even with regard to their mistakes.” Le Monde, 19 Oct. 1983. Aron died of a heart attack while leaving the courtroom. Yet for our purposes, Aron's views of de Jouvenel as a great man who momentarily succumbed to fascism bears light on Aron's later views of Carl Schmitt's Nazi involvement. For background on the controversy involving Sternhell and de Jouvenel see Wohl, Robert's “French Fascism, Both Right and Left: Reflections on the Sternhell Controversy,” Journal of Modern History, 83/1 (March 1991), 91–8CrossRefGoogle Scholar.\n\n31 Ibid., 207. One can quote many instances, but the following is emblematic of many other Schmittian-inspired passages in Peace and War: “The opposition of land to sea—the one which symbolized the contrast between the remote control of the ocean and the yard-by-yard occupation of the earth, or even between the possessive and stay-at-home spirit of the territorial power and the adventurous and commercial spirit of the maritime power—tends to lessen or to assume a new character . . . In terms of myth, we might say that earth and water are henceforth subject to the law of air and fire.” Ibid., 208. For Schmitt's mythological discussion of the opposition between land, sea, air and fire see Schmitt, Carl, Land und Meer: Eine weltgeschichtliche Betrachtung (Stuttgart, 2011)Google Scholar.\n\n53 Manfred Baldus remarks that Schmitt's Concept of the Political had been partially translated into French in 1933 by the banker Pierre Linn—a friend of Jacques Maritain—who refused to publish it after learning of Schmitt's entrance into the NSDAP. He further comments that though many French jurists and intellectuals have been familiar with Carl Schmitt throughout the twentieth century, it is only in the last few decades that there has been a general willingness to discuss his works since previously he was without question discredited.
