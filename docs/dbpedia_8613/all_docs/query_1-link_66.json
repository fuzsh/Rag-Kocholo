        "meta_description": "The chapter continues the examination of central texts on sovereignty into the twentieth century, including the work of Georg Jellinek and Raymond Carré de Malberg. It illustrates how the concept of sovereignty was connected to the conditions of an increasing sociological reality of social classes and inequality, particularly through the successful formula of political representation and parliamentarianism, and the dramatic expansion of the modern apparatus of order, the state. It also examines the related concept of ‘nation’ in the theories of Carl Schmitt and Hermann Heller.",
