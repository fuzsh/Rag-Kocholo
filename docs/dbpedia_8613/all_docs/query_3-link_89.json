Many scholars have developed his ideas, using them as a powerful theoretical resource for conservatism. This article seeks to introduce his realistic theories to domestic politics in democratic countries after making necessary developments to Schmitt’s theory and explore the underlying tendency of liberalism in his theory. We will first reanalyze the concepts of politics, enemy, and war to propose and demonstrate that the essence of an enemy is the existence of a hostile status. The application of Schmitt’s theory to domestic politics presents the need to introduce a realistic perspective to liberalism. Considering the escalating antagonism as evidenced by recent political science research within democracies, realistic liberalism may effectively recognize the threats that are negated by liberals and could warn us of authoritarianism and the encroachments on political rights.\n\nCopyright\n\n© 2021 The Authors.
