        "text": "Carl Schmitt is one of the most dedicated opponents of liberal universalism, with its notion of pluralist, rational and non-exclusivist consensus politics as a progressive democratic project and its understanding of the political arena – \" purified \" , being free from struggles and conflict – as the progressive move of democratic logic. In this paper I will first try to show Schmitt's pessimistic and negative stance based on ontological and theological grounds on the deliberative model of politics with its claim about the possibility of making particular wills reach the conception of common public interest or the common good through discussion and dialogue. Secondly, I'll try to show that, within Schmitt's project, the concept of the sovereign dictatorship exists as the necessary counterpoint to the concept of the political. Schmitt refuses to understand political life as a medium of dialogue leading to a rational consensus. In this context, the sovereign in Schmitt's theory should be precisely understood as a force constructed to reproduce homogeneity in a hegemonic manner. Hegemonia, in a Gramscian sense, is not a bare oppressive force. Rather, it refers to a ruling force which is able to inject its own ideology and world view into the public through persuasion. In this framework, leftist thinkers like mouffe, who recommended that we should think \" with Schmitt against Schmitt \" in order to develop a new democratic political understanding, draw attention to Schmitt's thesis that every political identity functions as \" we-they \" antinomy, yet they miss the fact that it is impossible to deduce a conception of a truly democratic public sphere from Schmitt's theory. As it will be emphasized in this paper, democracy in the Schmittian sense can be the perfect form of sovereignty, one which in contrast to liberal democracy results in homogenization and the exclusion of the heterogeneous and thus must be conceived as a fundamentally hegemonic system. The Schmittian ideal of democracy requires that political identities, public opinion, public sphere and will formation are the products of a sovereign will and not of open and free discussion.\n\nCarl Schmitt (1888–1985) was a conservative German political theorist, jurist and philosopher, who analysed the relationship of legal and constitutional concerns in relation to defining the political. He is considered to be one of the most important, yet overlooked critics of liberalism, liberal cosmopolitanism, and parliamentary democracy. The significance of Schmitt's work is still considered controversial, due to his active involvement in and intellectual support for National Socialism. In 1932, Schmitt published \"The Concept Of The Political\", in which he analysed the fundamental nature of the \"political\", and its place in the modern world. In his analysis, Schmitt criticises Liberalism, and its neutral, utopian stance in attempting to avoid antagonistic conflict, which Schmitt argues is a central, defining, and ineradicable trait of human nature. Borrowing elements from Hegel's idea of history being aesthetically driven forward by the antipodal distinction of qualitative quantification, Schmitt identified the core concept of the political in the states antithetical distinction between friend and enemy. ... http://www.whenthenewsstops.org/2017/02/the-concept-of-political-by-carl-schmitt.html\n\nCarl Schmitt's use of the friend–enemy distinction to define the political is intimately connected to the question of how to define who is a friend and who is an enemy. This article shows that Schmitt bases it on the perceived threat posed by another. Because the political is social, this means that the political decision is intimately connected to war, which leads Schmitt to offer a tripartite analysis of war grounded in different forms of enmity called classical, real or absolute. While a number of commentators have suggested that Schmitt's insistence that the political is the most intense antagonism should lead him to connect the political with absolute enmity, I show that the Schmittian political is and must be located against a real enemy. This not only clarifies an issue in Schmittian scholarship but also provides insights into how warring states should treat their enemy. The distinctive trait of the Schmittian conception of the political is the friend–enemy distinction, with this distinction arising due to a political decision regarding a perceived existential threat to the (way of) life of the political community. According to Schmitt, what is distinctive about the political is that it entails a reaction to a perceived violence that has been or is about to be committed against the community. If there is a lack of perceived violent threat, the other will be thought of as a political friend; if there is a perceived threat of violence from the other, the other will become a political enemy"
