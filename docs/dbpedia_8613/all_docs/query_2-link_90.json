        "text": "Some excerpts from the more recent State of Exception. First, pp. 38-9:\n\n[T]he concept of ‘force of law,’ as a technical legal term, defines a separation of the norm’s vis obligandi, or applicability, from its formal essence, whereby decrees, provisions, and measures that are not formally laws nevertheless acquire their ‘force’…\n\nIn our discussion of the state of exception, we have encountered numerous examples of this confusion between acts of the executive power and acts of the legislative power… But from a technical standpoint the specific contribution of the state of exception is less the confusion of pwoers than it is the separation of ‘force of law’ from the law. It defines a ‘state of the law’ in which, on the one hand, the norm is in force but is not applied and, on the other, acts that do not have the value of law acquire its ‘force.’ That is to say, in extreme situations ‘force of law’ floats as an indeterminate element that can be claimed both by the state authority and by a revolutionary organization. The state of exception if an anomic space in which what is at stake is a force of law without law. Such a force-of-law, in which potentiality and act are radically separated, is certainly something like a mystical element, or rather a fictio by means of which law seeks to annex anomie itself. But how is it possible to conceive of such a mystical element and the way it acts in the state of exception?\n\nA possible answer appears via a summary of the argument thus far on pp. 50-1:\n\n(1) The state of exception is not a dictatorship (whether constitutional or unconstitutional, commissarial or sovereign) but a space devoid of law, a zone of anomie in which all legal determinations are deactivated. Thus, all those theories that seek to annext the state of exception to the law are false; and so too are both the theory of necessity as the originary source of law and the theory that sees the state of exception as the execrise of a state’s right to its own defense or as the restoration of an originary pleromatic state of the law. But fallacious too are those theories, like Schmitt’s, that seek to inscribe the state of exception indirectly within a juridical context by grounding it in the division between norms of law and norms of the realization of law, between constituent power and constituted power, between norm and decision. The state of necessity is not a ‘state of law,’ but a space without law.\n\n(2) This space devoid of law seems, for some reason, to be so essential to the juridical order that it must seek in every way to assure itself a relation with it, as if in order to ground itself the juridical order necessarily had to maintain itself in relation with an anomie. On the one hand, the juridical void at issue in the state of exception seems absolutely unthinkable for the law; on the other, this unthinkable thing nevertheless has a decisive strategic relevance for the juridical order and must not be allowed to slip away at any cost.\n\n(3) The crucial problem connected to the suspension of the law is that of the acts committed during the iustitium, the nature of which seems to escape all legal definition. Because they are neither transgressive, executive, nor legislative, they seem to be situated in an absolute non-place with respect to the law.\n\n(4) The idea of a force-of-law is a response to this undefinability and this non-place. It is as if the suspension of law freed a force or a mystical element, a sort of legal mana, that both the ruling power and its adversaries, the constituted power as well as the constituent power, seek to appropriate. Force of law that is separate from the law; floating imperium, being-in-force without application, and, more generally, the idea of a sort of ‘degree zero’ of the law–all these are fictions through which the law attempts to encompass its own absence and to appropriate the state of exception, or at least to assure itself a relation with it. Though these categories are really scientific mythologemes, they perform in the law’s long battle over anomie. Indeed, it is possible that what is at issue in these categories is nothing less than the definition of what Schmitt calls ‘the political’.\n\nAnd one final quote re: Schmitt, six pages later:\n\nFrom Schmitt’s perspective, the functioning of the juridical order rests on an apparatus – the state of exception – whose purpose is to make the norm applicable by temporarily syspending its efficacy. When the exception becomes the norm, the machine can no longer function. In this sense, the undecidability of norm and exception formulated in the [Benjamin’s] eigth thesis puts Schmitt’s theory in check. Soverieng decision is no longer capable of performing the task that Political Theology assigned it; the rule, which now coincides with what it lives by, devours itself. Yet this confusion between the exception and the rule was precisely what the Third Reich had conceretely brought about, and the obstinacy with which Hitler pursued the organization of his ‘dual state’ without promulgating a new constitution is proof of it.\n\nI take it that the core of Schmitt’s thinking revolves around the constitutional paradox or aporia of the constituent/constituted power as the source of sovereign power and the authority of law. Whatever the strange alchemy of violence, organization, and legitimatation that goes into the sovereign power of a state and the authority of its laws (or their “origin” or creation), it does little good and perhaps makes less difference than one would like to think, whether sovereign power is said to belong to or derive from “the people” or be invested in the person of an inbred idiot. That power will always be tranferred to a legal-administrative apparatus and always be threatened with rupture from novel situations that emerge from its indefinable base, (“anomie”), which, in turn, re-opens the conflict of contested and irreconcilable conceptions of political power. What Schmitt is effectively saying is that political power and the authority of law, from which it derives and which is supposed to regulate it, are without foundation, such that its “basis” can only be construed in terms of contingency, conflict and decision, though, in accordance with his archconservative nationalist, and authoritarian Catholic background and biases, he dresses the point up in the numinous aura of theology. (This basically says that sovereignty and authority are ultimately fictive or mythic.) In particular, the foundational attempts of classical liberalism, that attempted to resolve the problem through a pre-established harmony of equal and equitable rights, values and interests, in an abstract scheme or plan of society fall to that criticism. (And, of course, from the leftie point of view, such liberal schemes served to perpetuate or augment inequality and inequitable distributions under the very guise of formal equality.) For my part, of course, I would reject Schmitt’s antinomian and annihilatory definition of politics in terms of the distinction of friend and foe, but rather would regard politics as having to do with the constitution and maintenance of a political community through the “productive” pursuit and possible resolution of conflicts, in which there are no prior or foundational guarantees, since not only interests, but the values which frame their perception and identification might be incommensurable and potentially irreconcilable, leading to the potential from violence and repression/oppression at the extreme. In other words, politics is a matter of praxis, in the sense of Aristotelian practical reason, which seeks to resolve conflicts in view of enhance relations within the good life in common, rather than “solve problems”, in the manner of modern conceptions of theoretical reason, heavily infiltrated by techne, as in technocratic-economistic conceptions of politics. (Law too is a means of resolving conflicts through access and appeal to the formal means of applying the coercive power of the sovereign state, though not only is law preceded by prior, informal levels and modes of conflict, even while provoking conflicts through the very availability of formal means to conflict,- as with the famous litigiousness of Americans or the endless political squabbles over judicial rulings and appointments,- but ultimately the legitimacy and efficacy of law depends on whether it is consonant with and supported by the practices of the communities under its juristiction. If Schmitt, by profession a legal and constitutional theorist and not per se a political one, means to suggest the ultimate primacy of the political over the legal and the ultimate impossibility of an automatically self-regulating “rule of laws, not men”, then I basically agree.) At any rate, as I think was hinted by others above, the dilemmas that Schmitt adumbrated need not be applied in a violently authoritarian and anachronistically traditionalist sense, as opposed to a democratic context. FDR’s New Deal could be seen partly in Schmittian terms, rather than conventional liberal-legalistic terms,- (think of the failed court-packing scheme),- as it involved the acquiring/creation of new governmental functions and powers and the promulation of whole new areas of administrative laws and regulations, with only indirect consent from the lawmaking legislature, leading to a conflict between the universalist, liberal conception of law and the particularisms of administrative law that has riddled the welfare-state compromise ever since.\n\nIt might also be useful to de-toxify Schmitt just a bit, without ignoring his toxicity. The writings for which he is best known stem from the Weimar period, when he was working with the Catholic Center Party, attempting to preserve the viability of the Weimar constitution, which he saw as the legitimate embodiment of the German state, in continuity with the defeated Wilhelmine Reich, amidst not just rampant economic dislocation and misery and violent street agitation, but an electoral and parlimentary system that was irreconcilably divided and incapable of forming a functional consensus, the rechts radical parties, (of which the Nazis were initially not foremost), undermining the traditional conservative parties and the Communists undermining the SDP. His theoretical efforts can not really be disentangled from the practical-legal problems he was confronting, as he tried to provide a constitutionally legitimate basis for presidential rule by decree, as the only recourse for maintaining, as he saw it, the legitimate authority and functionality of the German state in the face of the parlimentary/electoral deadlock. And, in particular, he worked vigorously with elements in the Von Hindenburg circles to prevent the rise of Hitler. A year after having failed, responding to a letter from Heidegger, who had already hitched himself to the Nazis, he joined the party, having to suck up to the Nazi hierarchs, who regarded him with suspicion as a former opponent. That’s damnable, but his Nazi period still has to be distinguished from his Weimar writings and his rancorous post-war analyses of international relations. What distinguishes Schmitt from his predecessors on the counter-revolutionary authoritarian Catholic right, such De Maistre and Donoso Cortes, is precisely his sophisticated, modernistic understanding of the highly differentiated and functionally complex nature of modern societies, which is why an absolutist appeal to the restoration of authoritarian tradition would not avail. However repulsive or reprehensible the character of the man, there’s still some reason for attending to what his intelligence has to convey.\n\nAs to the immediate topic at hand, the Bush surveillance revelations, liberals who claim that Bush has broken the law and evaded the constitution are not wrong, so much as, in my book, missing the real point. The inapplicability of warrants is apparently due to the operation of high-tech data-mining techniques. The U.S.A. has pursued a lavishly funded high-tech military-industrial complex, while cutting back or constraining social provision and other governmental operations, if not rendering them sheerly dysfunctional. Meanwhile the military caste and the Pentagon complex have gained increasing autonomy, as almost a state-within-the-state, in their pursuit of “full spectrum dominance”, of which this case is just another instance, evading not just oversight and accountability, but the public deliberative processes that are the only way to test the applicability and suitability of the accumulation of such fantastically violent means of “power projection”. The problem here is not just that “big brother” is watching you, but that “big brother” is lavishing himself with sophisticated means of “enforcing” its power, without any consideration of the actual applicability or efficacy of such means in a real political world. “Big brother” might be watching you, though most of us might not have all that much to hide. But still more frightening is that the sophistication of his means only re-enforces the unthinking stupidity of his ends. Be afraid, very afraid.\n\nThought the following debunking of the right-wing talking points concerning Carter/Clinton authorization of electronic surveillance would be useful (from georgia 10 at Daily Kos).\n\nYou know the shit is about the hit the fan when the wingers turn to Clinton to try and excuse King George’s behavior. We saw it with the illegal invasion of Iraq (“but..but…CLINTON said Saddam has WMD!”) and with the nuclear option (“but…but…you hated the filibuster when the Clenis was in power!”). But no distortion is more blatant, I think, than the one being circulated now that both Clinton and Carter authorized warrantless searches.\n\nThink Progress does a quick and painless job of eviscerating the myth. Let’s take a closer look and put this lie to rest. Yes, both Clinton and Carter issued executive orders pertaining to foreign intelligence surveillance. But neither of these even remotely authorized warrantless searches of American citizens, as Bush’s order does.\n\nCLINTON DID NOT ORDER WARRANTLESS SEARCHES OF AMERICAN CITIZENS\n\nHere’s what Clinton signed:\n\nSection 1. Pursuant to section 302(a)(1) [50 U.S.C. 1822(a)] of the [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance] Act, the Attorney General is authorized to approve physical searches, without a court order, to acquire foreign intelligence information for periods of up to one year, if the Attorney General makes the certifications required by that section.\n\nYou don’t have to be a lawyer to understand that Clinton allowed warrantless searches if and only if the AG followed section 302(a)(1). What does section 1822(a) require?\n\nthe “physical search is solely directed at premises, information, material, or property used exclusively by, or under the open and exclusive control of, a foreign power or powers.” Translation: You can’t search American citizens.\n\nand there is “no substantial likelihood that the physical search will involve the premises, information, material, or property of a United States person.” Translation: You can’t search American citizens.\n\nMoreover, Clinton’s warrant waiver consistent with FISA refers only to physical searches. “Physical searches,” as defined by 1821(5), exclude electronic surveillance.\n\nCARTER DID NOT AUTHORIZE WARRANTLESS SEARCHES OF AMERICAN CITIZENS\n\nAnd now, Carter’s turn:\n\n1-101. Pursuant to Section 102(a)(1) of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1802(a)), the Attorney General is authorized to approve electronic surveillance to acquire foreign intelligence information without a court order, but only if the Attorney General makes the certifications required by that Section.\n\nHere, Carter refers to “electronic surveillance,” rather than “physical searches” like Clinton. But again, Carter limits the warrantless surveillance to the requirements of Section 1802(a). That section requires:\n\nthe electronic surveillance is solely directed at communications exclusively between or among foreign powers. Translation: You can’t spy on American citizens.\n\nthere is no substantial likelihood that the surveillance will acquire the contents of any communication to which a United States person is a party. Translation: You can’t spy on American citizens.\n\nSection 1803(a)(2) requires that the Attorney General report to Congress (specifically, the House and Senate Intelligence Committees) about whether any American citizens were involved, what minimization procedures were undertaken to avoid it and protect their identities, and whether his actions comply with the law. Hot damn, that sounds like a check and balance to me!\n\nabb1:\n\nPhalangist movements are more traditionalistic and less totalitarian than fascism proper, relying on a reactive alliance of existing traditionalist class/caste groups rather than mass mobilization through all-encompassing novel ideology and correspondingly are less expansively agressive in their assertion of nationalist claims. Many strains nowadays on the far right would be more usefully described and analyzed in terms of phalangist tendencies rather than in terms of fascism proper: an organization such as, e.g., the American Legion, might at times express such tendencies. The basic point I was making was that fascism emerged an historically unique juncture of the development of socio-political affairs in Europe and it is little likely that we will ever see the re-emergence of full-blown fascism ever again, while it’s highly likely that we will witness much that is woeful or abusive. Using “fascism” as an epithet to label any authoritatian, dictatorial, tyrannical or otherwise oppressive and abusive tendency, whether only on the right or on the left, as well, just muddles the issues, whereas a more differentiated categorical vocabulary in interpreting and analysizing different political-historical situations might more usefully provide some sense of orientation in these “interesting” times. Someone else above gave a good example of the effects of such conflations, but I’ll add another one of my own: the Cold War identification of Nazism/fascism with Stalinism/communism under the rubric of “totalitarianism”. There were, of course, analogies between the two, with strong similarities in terms of mass mobilization through an all-encompassing, totalizing ideology, combined with the extensive and intrusive deployment of state-organized terror. But there were just as strong differences in the historical situations, aims and complexions of the respective regimes. But, of course, the conflation was a deliberate ideological trope, mobilizing the fight against and opprobrium of fascism for the aggressive “containment” of communism, stigmatizing any effort at mutual accommodation, peaceful coexistence or gradualism between the two “blocs” as “appeasemnt”, while disguising/justifying, that is, denegating, oppressive or imperialistic alliances or manoeuvres on behalf of the “free world”. (This is not to deny, of course, that there was much that was oppressive, culpable or dangerously inept on the other side, as well. It’s just to emphasize the importance of clarifying the ideological dynamics and power diffentials operating in various situations.)\n\nCarl Schmitt might have been a nasty piece of work, but his work still constitutes a useful reminder against complacent assumptions, such as that “liberal democracy” is somehow the natural or inevitable political estate, condition or terminus ad quem of mankind, that law and legal proceduralism are somehow a self-grounding and “transparent” medium, that the substance and limits of politics consist solely in representational processes, and that authoritarianism and democracy are simple opposites. His agonistic definition of the political as being determined and organized by the distinction between friend and foe is, of course, an analytic statement,- (though keeping in mind, as Bateson put it, the “report/command” structure of every statement),- that, though weak on understanding how a political community is “internally” constituted, does usefully bring out the issues of the competitive/oppositional organization of power that all but inevitably ensues. As for the Busheviks, though Bush is definitely a divider and not a uniter and is unstinting in his arrogant, corrupt, and reckless usurpation of power, it would be difficult to attribute to them anything like the cold and stark clarity of the Schmittian outlook. Were Schmitt alive today, though I doubt he was known for his sense of humor, I suspect the Iraq invasion would have provoked him to gales of Mephistophelian laughter. (Perhaps he is, in fact, so laughing in unheard realms.)\n\nBut once we’re on the topic of “political theology”, perhaps a glance back at the first such analyst might be of some interest: Spinoza’a contention, based on his metaphysics on the “conatus essendi”, that right extends as far as power. That was precisely not an identification of right with power, “might makes right”, but an assertion that rights could not meaningfully be talked of without the capacity to sustain them. In fact, he deployed the claim to criticize, from a “democratic” perspective, Hobbes’ theory of sovereignty based on an authoritarian social contract. That men would voluntarily transfer the whole of their right to a sovereign in exchange for protection and survival and that they would adhere to their contractual obligations as moral duties when the sovereign proved abusive of the putative contract Spinoza regarded as weak claims that reasonable men would not sustain and that could have no causal/rational- (the two were identical for him)- explanatory force. In other words, he turned the Enlightened critique of superstition on Hobbes’ own claim to establish a bold new “science” of politics. Following up on that, I’ll just remark that it might be more useful to delineate the realm of politics as the expression, for better or for worse, of the relational nexuses that comprise social life processes, including the power differentials that are constantly negotiated in them, rather than analysing it in terms of the utilitarian calculation of interests, since it is the resulting “values” and their conflicts, (which can be “internal” to positions, as well as, occurring ‘externally” between positions), that frame the perception and identification of “interests” by actual individual and group agents. Interpretation and analysis in terms of such an expressive conception of the political might better capture the real force of the interests at play in the organization of effective power than programmatic analysis based on the imputation of “objective” interests, with its denegation of the very agency it ostensibly appeals to. But still the question remains, hanging over us like the Sword of Damocles: what is power?"
