The introduction provides an overview the key concepts in Schmitt’s writings in the 1920s. Chapter one examines Schmitt’s influence on the German-Jewish émigré political theorists Leo Strauss and Hans Morgenthau, in an attempt to explain how Schmitt’s ideas were initially transported from Germany to the U.S. The second chapter is a more detailed case study of the American leftist journal, Telos, which played a key role in introducing Schmitt’s writings to a broader, English language audience in the late 1980s and 1990s. Chapter three examines the reception of Schmitt among left and left-liberal Anglo-American political theorists more generally. Both chapter two and three address the larger question of which elements of the Anglo-American left were drawn to Schmitt and why the ideas of this conservative German thinker – and former Nazi – still seemed relevant to them.",
