In today’s economy credit cards are increasingly becoming the mode of payment, not only in The Bahamas but around the world. Accepting credit cards is not only convenient for customers, it offers them more choice, flexibility, safety in terms of traveling with cash and also improves processing speed.\n\nSuperintendent Juanita Armbrister, Officer-in-Charge at LPIA noted that credit card terminals are effective in the ease of conducting business with the general public and for the purpose of transparency. This is the Department’s intent at modernization of operations as we move toward e-government throughout the Public Service.\n\nEnd."
