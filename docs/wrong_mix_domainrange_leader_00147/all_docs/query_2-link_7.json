        "text": "In January 1967, when the Bahamas was still a British colony, the black population of Nassau, New Providence, and of the other 700 or so islands of the far-flung archipelago, danced with delight as the news seeped through of a famous election victory. By a whisker, black majority rule had arrived.\n\nThe stranglehold on power of the entrenched white elite, the so-called \"Bay Street Boys\" (named after Nassau's main business street), had been broken. For three centuries, they had dominated commercial and political life, and had been the mainstay of the \"colour bar\" that controlled most areas of Bahamian life.\n\nThe man responsible for this historic electoral win was Sir Lynden Pindling, leader of the Bahamas for 25 years - both before and after its independence in 1973 - known as \"Black Moses\", who has died aged 70. Always ready to use robust language to denounce first, British colonialism, and later, American imperialism as the political occasion demanded, he deployed his considerable charm to court British, European and American investment and business activity.\n\nMost Bahamians overlooked his dictatorial manner (often accompanied by intense staring through a slow eye) and questionable business deals, as he transformed the prospects of his fellow blacks. By the time he was voted out of office, in 1992, GNP per capita was $12,000, second only to the Caymans in the English-speaking Caribbean.\n\nThe son of a retired policeman, he did well enough at school to go to London university, from where he graduated with a law degree in 1952. He was called to the Bar at Middle Temple in early 1953 and to the Bahamian Bar in the following August. On his return home, he joined the minority black-led Progressive Liberal Party (PLP), which had been only recently formed.\n\nHe was elected to the House of Assembly in 1956 on a limited franchise and unremittingly campaigned for universal suffrage, always delayed by the white elite. Male universal suffrage was conceded in 1962, when older women also got the vote.\n\nContrary to expectations, the United Bahamian Party (UBP), which had been created by the white elite to counter the PLP, won the 1962 elections, although the PLP polled a majority of votes. Crisis gripped the PLP leadership and Pindling became leader soon after. His platform was to insist on constitutional advancement, and universal suffrage for both sexes came in 1964. Despite growing prosperity, the British government reserved considerable powers to itself, and this provided a further target for Pindling.\n\nAt the 1967 election, he switched his electoral base from New Providence to Kemp's Bay, Andros Island, where accusations of corruption against members of the UBP, vigorous PLP campaigning and support from the sole representative of the Negro Labour Party resulted in Pindling becoming premier. Shock waves rippled through the Bahamas. Racial strife and economic collapse were predicted. In fact, the white elite soon learned they could live with a PLP government, which was similarly interested in promoting business, tourism and offshore finance.\n\nAlmost at once, Pindling insisted on constitutional change: the Assembly was dissolved and an election called in 1968 to ensure a mandate for change, which returned the PLP to power. Independence followed five years later. Thereafter, Pindling led the PLP to win five successive elections. The UBP collapsed and it took years of confusion before the Free National Movement (FNM) eventually emerged as the opposition party. Pindling paid particular attention to immigration, in the hope that black Bahamians would benefit. Yet successive clampdowns on illegal Haitian immigrants and strict work permit rules for (mainly white) expatriates had unforeseen effects. Wages rose, but not in line with skills.\n\nDespite impressive industrial and other development, notably at Freeport on Grand Bahama Island, black (especially youth) unemployment stubbornly remained and investment was often being directed at capital-intensive rather than labour-intensive projects.\n\nBy the late 1970s, the Bahamas had become associated with drug trafficking and money laundering, being en route between south America and the United States. The FNM eventually focused on narcotic-related corruption in the PLP ministerial ranks. In 1983 - the year he was knighted - Pindling was accused in a US television programme of involvement in drug trafficking and was forced to launch a royal commission to investigate the claims against himself and the PLP. The commission found against several ministers but Pindling was cleared, although the report noted that his expenditure was eight times his declared income.\n\nConfronted by an angry US government which threatened sanctions against the Bahamas, Pindling had to grant US law enforcement officials diplomatic immunity and free passage through the archipelago, plus access to the criminal secrets of offshore banks.\n\nGradually, the offshore industry was cleaned up. In 1985 a joint US-Bahamian operation in Bimini netted an incredible 34,000 tonnes of marijuana and 2,500 tonnes of processed cocaine .\n\nPindling sought political vengeance for his humiliation. The FNM opposition had urged cooperation with Washington. In the 1987 election campaign, he played both nationalist and racial cards to good effect. His opponents, he said, were traitors, concerned only to appease US and white interests and to degrade the black populace. The FNM was trounced and its leadership demoralised. But change was in the air. Former PLP minister Hubert Ingraham emerged as FNM leader and his party's image became more black-orientated.\n\nBy the early 1990s, the black population in New Providence in particular was severely affected by recession; then another scandal broke over the state-owned airline, Bahamasair, and the Pindling-headed Bahamas Hotel Corporation. In the 1992 election, the PLP was decisively defeated.\n\nAs leader of the opposition, Pindling fought a long rearguard action against inquiries involving his business affairs. Despite his legal difficulties, he gained comfort from the knowledge that the political magic associated with \"Black Moses\" remained very much alive. His offer to resign after the 1992 election was refused by the PLP rank and file, who revered him to the end.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, the former Marguerite McKenzie of Andros, and by his two sons and two daughters."
