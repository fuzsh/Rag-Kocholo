        "text": "Rt Hon. Hubert Minnis\n\nPrime Minister of The Bahamas\n\nIt is with pride and pleasure that I welcome the introduction of The Bahamas section on the Commonwealth of Nations website, the electronic addendum to the member country information in the Commonwealth Yearbook, the Commonwealth Secretariat’s flagship publication.\n\nSince its founding, the Commonwealth has lived up to its Declaration of Principles, that of being a voluntary association of independent sovereign states, each responsible for its own policies, consulting and co-operating in the common interests of their peoples and in the promotion of international understanding and world peace.\n\nThe Bahamas has and continues to play its part in the affairs of the Commonwealth and remains committed to the principles of the organisation. Indeed, The Bahamas was privileged to play a pivotal role in the dismantling of Apartheid in South Africa by extending the economic sanctions against the white minority government at the 1985 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Nassau.\n\nIn fact, our former Prime Minister, the late Sir Lynden Pindling, was appointed Chairman of a group of Commonwealth Heads of Government to review the progress of the sanctions that eventually led to the freeing from prison of Nelson Mandela and the peaceful transition to majority rule in South Africa.\n\nThe Commonwealth, which makes up about one quarter of the world’s population, continues to be a force for good in international affairs, assisting member nations in the monitoring of elections and the peaceful transfer of power, providing technical assistance, and helping to address the social, political and economic challenges of the peoples of the world.\n\nI am therefore delighted to invite the millions of Commonwealth viewers, and millions more residing outside of the Commonwealth, to visit www.commonwealth-of-nations.org to find out more about The Bahamas, one of the smallest but also one of the most stable democracies in the Commonwealth of Nations.\n\nThe above message was provided by the previous Prime Minister.\n\nThe Bahamas in the Commonwealth\n\ndid you know?\n\nThe Bahamas joined the Commonwealth in 1973\n\nThe Bahamas became an independent country on the 10th of July 1973\n\nThe Bahamas has been taking part in the Commonwealth Games since 1954, and has won 25 medals in total\n\nDebbie Ferguson of The Bahamas took the Commonwealth Games Women’s 100 Metres record when she won the event in 10.91 seconds in the Manchester Games in 2002\n\nRobert Antoni, born in The Bahamas in 1958, was winner of the Commonwealth Writers’ Prize Best First Book award with his novel, Divina Trace, in 1992\n\nElaine Toote, Director of the Department of Archives, The Bahamas, was Chair of the Association of Commonwealth Archivists and Records Managers 2005-08\n\nThe Bahamas enjoys the third highest per capita income among all Western Hemisphere countries led only by the United States and Canada\n\nThe country is a coral archipelago of about 700 islands and more than 2,000 cays and rocks and has some 3,500 km of coastline\n\nCommonwealth meetings hosted\n\n1985 CHOGM, resulting in the Nassau Declaration on World Order and Commonwealth Accord on Southern Africa\n\n2006 Sixth Commonwealth Youth Ministers Meeting in Nassau\n\n2009 Fifth Commonwealth Local Government Conference held in Freeport\n\nCommonwealth Projects\n\nCapacity Building in Legislative Drafting (2007/08)\n\nThe Commonwealth Secretariat commissioned this project as a way of overcoming delays in the preparation of legislative instruments, by using the assistance of a legislative drafter. The expert was providing on-the-job training to legislative drafting staff in order to develop the capacity to prepare legislation and provide the legal framework through which new policies were approached and then implemented.\n\nTelecommunications Regulatory Advisor (2003/04)\n\nThe Commonwealth Secretariat introduced a telecommunications advisor who provided assistance and advice to the Public Utilities Commission on policy, licensing issues and regulation.\n\nDevelopment of Sustainable Tourism (1997/8 – 2001/02)\n\nThe Commonwealth funded a project where a plan of action was drawn up for the development of sustainable tourism in the country, following an investment promotion workshop for the tourism sector.\n\nAssistance with WTO Status (1997/8 – 2001/02)\n\nThe Commonwealth funded a project which provided assistance to the Government of Bahamas in deciding the feasibility of joining the WTO. An assessment was made on the impact of the reduction of tariffs required by the WTO on the Bahamian economy.\n\nFunctional Eco-Souvenirs Industry (1987/8 – 2001/02)\n\nThis project, commissioned by the Commonwealth Secretariat, began to manufacture custom-designed high-margin eco-souvenirs for the Disney market and high-income tourists from the United States, as a way of creating income-generating opportunities among the Family Islands."
