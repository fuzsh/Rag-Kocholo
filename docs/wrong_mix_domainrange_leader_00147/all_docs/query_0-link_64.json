        "text": "atg airports is a world renowned manufacturer of airfield lighting solutions, producing a range of products and services designed to maintain safe and efficient airport operations.\n\nAirfield lighting\n\nBy creating a range of solutions at the forefront of the airfield ground lighting industry, atg airports are able to provide a range of approach, taxiway and runway lighting, utilising LED or tungsten halogen light sources, all of which are designed in compliance with ICAO, FAA, CAP 168 and other relevant international standards.\n\nIRIS, atg’s latest development is the future of airfield lighting. IRIS offers unique technological developments designed to improve airfield lighting performance, including the introduction of dynamic light output (DLO) technology. DLO is the ultimate in back indication of the luminaires performance, providing maintenance staff with the actual light output of the fitting and automatically compensating against LED \"fade away\" to maintain airfield luminance uniformity.\n\nAirfield installation services\n\nWith a highly skilled installation team adept at completing a variety of airside projects, from simple luminaire replacement projects through to complex runway development and refurbishment projects, atg airports have a team able to work in the toughest environments to the tightest of deadlines.\n\natg airports’ project services portfolio includes airfield lighting installation, navigational aids installation and commissioning, bulk fuel electrical systems, apron lighting, fixed ground power systems and docking guidance systems.\n\nAirfield lighting control systems\n\natg airports provide a range of airfield control solutions, all of which are designed to maximise the efficiency of the available infrastructure. Both the Sonnis and SmartControl systems provide full AGL control and monitoring functionality, including individual lamp control and monitoring, and are suitable for use at international hub airports.\n\nRepresenting the latest development of the Smart suite of control system products, the SmartMini has been specifically designed for airports with lower traffic volumes that seek a creative yet practical solution to complex airfield challenges.\n\nAirfield guidance signs\n\nThe clearway range of airfield guidance signs are based around a well-proven design currently in operation at airports around the world. Incorporating the latest LED guidance sign technology, atg ‘s clearway signs are available as mandatory or information signs, illuminated runway distance markers (IRDM) and illuminated stand number indicator boards (SNIB). RHAG markers are used primarily for military operations and non-illuminated retro-reflective signs.\n\nConstant current regulators for airfield lighting circuits\n\natg airports design and manufacture a variety of advanced power regulation equipment for airfield lighting circuits. Both the thyristor controlled micro 100 and the sinewave output micro 200 regulators are in operation at airports across the globe, utilising modern electronics and FAA style cubicles to maintain a prominent position in the marketplace.\n\nPortable and temporary airfield lighting\n\natg offer both temporary and portable lighting solutions in the shape of the PEARL and POLARIS systems. Providing compact LED lighting solutions, PEARL and POLARIS offer the latest technological developments to small airfields and remote locations, allowing for quick and easy deployment or repositioning.\n\nHelipad, shipboard and naval lighting\n\nFor helipads, both onshore and offshore, atg airports offers a range of helipad lighting to assist helicopter guidance even in the most hostile environmental conditions. Products include the glide path indicator, horizon lights, stop / go lights and deck lighting. atg airports offers a fully engineered system of helicopter landing and servicing aids for aircraft carriers, frigates, corvettes, OPVs, oil rigs and other naval and commercial vessels.\n\nObstruction lights\n\natg airports offers a wide range of obstacle lighting, floodlights, airport location beacons and markers for use within airports and for general obstacles such as chimneys, discharge towers, radio and television towers, bridges, high-rise buildings and offshore oil platforms.\n\nAirfield maintenance and support\n\nFollowing installation, atg airports can provide the complete support service, offering a comprehensive maintenance package which can include measurement of photometric performance of installed airfield lighting and the provision of routine maintenance and repairs."
