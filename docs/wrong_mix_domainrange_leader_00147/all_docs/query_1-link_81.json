All the power it has society gives it, plus what it confiscates from time to time on one pretext or another; there is no other source from which State power can be drawn. Therefore every assumption of State power, whether by gift or seizure, leaves society with so much less power; there is never, nor can be, any strengthening of State power without a corresponding and equivalent depletion of social power.\" -Albert]. Nock (1935) \"Knowledge itself is power.\" -Francis Bacon, Meditationes Sacrae (1597) In the age-old struggle for individual liberty against the power of the state, there can be no question which side has triumphed throughout most of the twentieth century. T h e one interest the state willingly sacrifices to the \"common good\" is personal liberty \"the freedom to produce and create, to buy and sell, to speak and publish, to travel, to live freely. By diminishing liberty, government systematically subverts people's responsibility for their own lives. It robs those who produce in order to placate those who only consume. T h e result is economic stagna-tion, retrogression and political corruption. Since the seventeenth century, in England, France and America, and more recently in Russia and eastern Europe, revolutions against this tyranny of the state were fought on behalf of an alternative we can call \"natural liberty.\" At first successful, over time these revolutions cooled to com-placency and hard-won freedom came to mean guaranteed entitlement to government largess. True natural liberty means that each of us is the sole legitimate owner of our own life and destiny, free to act as we wish so long as we use no violence, fraud or other aggression against others.\n\nThat same freedom dictates a free-market economy enjoying peaceful production and trade. It opposes government control by self-serving politicians. No activity of statist government has diminished personal liberty more than the unchecked power to tax. In the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany the effective rate of personal taxes far exceeds 50 percent of earnings. In some nations, such as France and Sweden, it is higher still. Business is taxed at even greater levels. And everyone pays the ultimate price. When government takes wealth from some and gives it to others, this forced redistribution diminishes the rights and well-being of the former, and often destroys the independence of the latter. T h e issue of taxation involves nothing less than the human and natural right to own, use and enjoy private property, a \"civil right\" of the most basic kind. Property and wealth determine personal power to control our own lives, to make decisions, to raise a family, to live free. As Albert Jay Nock noted, every additional tax imposed diminishes our freedom. In an economic history of the Middle Ages, Paul Craig Roberts, the economist and columnist, showed that medieval serfs bound to the land and their masters rarely paid more then one-third of the value of their labors in taxes. For good reason: with very low productivity, serfs could not survive if forced to pay more taxes. With nothing to lose, they would revolt and kill the tax collectors. Yet a half-millennium later, with capitalism's enormously increased productivity, we have even less right to our earnings than did those enslaved serfs. Says Roberts: \"You are not free when you do not own the product of your own labor.\" This book, Forbidden Knowledge, is a compendium of the acts and ideas of dynamic men and women who have exalted natural liberty in their own lives— and many who do so to this day. Albert Camus said, \"Revolutionaries are men who say no!\" These authors have said an emphatic \"NO\" to Big Brother government. These practical people refuse to bow down to government, to submit to bureaucratic demands for ever higher taxes, greater controls and increased regulation.\n\nIn some cases this has meant leaving the nation of their birth and moving to countries that still believe in and practice natural liberty. There are such places, as you will see. Some individuals you will meet in these pages call no single nation \"home,\" spending the changing seasons of each year in many places where they do business, and enjoy the new experiences and the pleasures life has to give. Drawing on their experience, you too can have a life of natural liberty. You too can live, work, invest and do business without having to pay taxes to any government anywhere. And you can do this legally and with maximum personal security and financial privacy. To knowledgeable people, true financial security means: • the maximum possible tax avoidance • the strongest possible financial privacy • the greatest degree of asset protection • the most profitable investments These goals, and how to achieve them, are spelled out in Forbidden Knowledge.\n\nThe Meaning of Natural Liberty C H A P T E R ONE\n\nThe Meaning of Natural Liberty On Becoming a Sovereign Individual 2 T h e Evolution of Freedom 3 The \"PT\" Life...

These emerging systems weaken the power of traditional governments, even as they increase individual freedom, financial choice and personal privacy.\n\nToday's politicians see what is coming and are clawing desperately to stay ahead of the inevitable tide. They'll fail, as did the corrupt leaders of a dying Soviet Union, brazenly trying to stop the spread of free ideas by outlawing fax and copying machines. As myopic nineteenth century Luddite workers failed to thwart the Industrial Revolution by destroying new laborsaving machinery. As evidence, consider how shared, instantaneous information contributed to the collapse of Asian economies a few years ago, nations widely touted as world leaders of an unending boom. T h e resulting economic \"correction\" wasn't confined to Wall Street and the City. Nervous waves rippled daily through time zones and stock markets as C N N covered it live and Internet trading went wild, another example of irresistible techno-advances forcing a totally new financial and banking reality. Consider too, the recent technology boom and bust on Wall Street and in other markets. Stock of corporations whose wealth existed only on paper or as future concepts rocketed up in price, and just as quickly, they disappeared. A select few people long ago anticipated the revolution now at hand. These are the Sovereign Individuals, voluntary citizens of the world-at-large seeking freedom and fortune wherever they judge best. 1\n\nThe Meaning of Natural Liberty Weary of oppressive governments and onerous taxes, they search the globe for personal liberty, for safe havens for their families, themselves and their wealth. Now the rest of the world is coming to realize the successful strategies that the Sovereign Individual has known all along. This first chapter highlights the basic principles of the freedom philosophy. This begins your guide to natural liberty.\n\nOn Becoming a Sovereign Individual by John Pugsley, The Sovereign Individual, June 1999\n\nThe chairman of the Sovereign Society traces the evolution of freedom from serfdom into democracy, and now to a modem slavery by government in the name of democracy. Since emerging from the caves and jungles of antiquity, mankind has been engaged in an epic struggle to discover the ultimate design for social organization, one that would allow civilization to progress in peace and ever increasing prosperity. For thousands of years, the idea of monarchy reigned. T h e overwhelming majority accepted rule by an all-powerful government headed by a king appointed by God. Then, about 200 years ago, an idea emerged that was to change the nature of government ... the idea that all men were born with equal rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. In short, all individuals were sovereign, and had both the right and the responsibility to rule themselves. T h e concept of the divine right of kings was cast aside and in its place democracy was born: citizens were free to elect their rulers. It was believed the era of oppressive government was over. When democracy was embryonic, it seemed to work. Individual freedom from oppression led to a nourishing new world. Over the past few decades, however, there has been a steady growth of government as the masses of voters have learned that they can manipulate government to their advantage. They have found they can enrich themselves at the expense of the successful and thrifty. This attack on the more affluent and productive individuals in countries like the United States, Canada, Germany and Great Britain has had the same effect as the repressive policies of King George had in the eighteenth century. It has led to a rising exodus of society's most productive people as they migrate to political environments that offer greater asset protection, privacy and lower taxation. Many are moving only their assets offshore to countries that offer more financial privacy and low or no taxation. A smaller but rising number are electing to move themselves and their families offshore as well. While a few officially disconnect from their nation of birth by renouncing their citizenship, others merely reside offshore while retaining their original\n\ncitizenship. Still others acquire dual nationality by ancestral right or through financial citizenship programs offered by many countries. A few adopt the so-called \" P T \" lifestyle and become nomads, never staying long enough in one place to become subject to its taxes, thus becoming Permanent Tourists or Prior Taxpayers. But all are united in seeking privacy, freedom of movement, low or no taxes, safety of capital and minimal connection with big government. And in being Prepared Thoroughly for the unexpected.\n\nT h e Sovereign Society Over the years my study and writings on the subjects of political coercion, freedom and free markets has led to correspondence, affiliations and friendships with like-minded individuals from many disciplines and many countries. In the past few months a group of us have formed T h e Sovereign Society, a group of the most 2\n\nThe Meaning of Natural Liberty creative thinkers on the subjects of personal and financial freedom, as well as individuals who are motivated to achieve personal independence for themselves. The aim of the Society is to create a network for developing strategies that individuals can use to wrest control of their lives and assets away from the menace of Big Brother. I don't think of the Society as a club or organization but as a virtual society, an extranational community existing all over the world in the hearts and minds of its citizen members. Essentially, it will offer members a new \"passport,\" a whole new concept of citizenship in a country that takes its shape not on the basis of geography, but on the basis of ideology. Through borderless cyberspace and with the security of encryption, members will be taught to carry on intellectual and financial commerce worldwide, 24 hours a day. Most important, citizen members will work with one another in their quest to find sanctuary from private and state snoops, bugs, swat teams, property seizures and other incursions on civil and economic liberties.\n\nOur aim is to find free market alternatives to the services that governments today promise but fail to provide: security from crime and violence, education, old age security, health care, just enforcement of contracts.

I have long struggled to unravel the mystery of why the majority of intelligent, educated, successful people accept even the most irrational social customs of the society into which they are bom. Why do people buy into the concept that government should solve their problems when history clearly demonstrates that the State worsens every problem that it is assigned to solve? Most individuals go to great lengths to become model citizens. They dutifully follow the established religion of the group, the current economic system and the current political system. T h e majority experiences no urge to deviate from the customs, mores and taboos of the group and strives to be politically and socially correct. Only a small minority views convention as a curious and irrational way to make choices. We question authority, ask for logical explanations of why particular rules should be followed, and, lacking a suitable explanation, do things our own way.\n\nWhy do most individuals march with the masses, while only a few of us march to our own drummers? One close friend and colleague jokingly suspects a \"socialism\" gene that blinds people to the logic of the free market. He may be looking in the right area. Recently I've been reading a book by Dean Hamer and Peter Copeland titled Living with Our Genes that sheds breakthrough insights into the roots of individual behavior. T h e book is a fascinating investigation of the link between genes and social behavior. Using D N A samples from a variety of sources in conjunction with psychological personality-typing questionnaires, Hamer and other scientists have isolated specific genes that regulate a variety of individual behaviors. Some of these bear heavily on an individual's propensity to follow social rules versus exploring on his or her own initiative. Perhaps the slice of DNA most linked to the rule-following behavior in question is what psy-3\n\nThe Meaning of Natural Liberty chiatrist Robert Cloninger has dubbed the \"novelty-seeking\" gene. T h e gene triggers the release of pleasure-creating chemicals in the brain when the individual is exposed to a new experience. Individuals carrying this gene tend to become bored with orderliness, precision and routine and have a higher-than-average propensity to be exploratory, seeking out new situations, new ideas, adventure, dangerous sports and unconventional pursuits. For individuals without the gene, new situations hold little reward and following routine and tradition would be more natural. Other genes also influence social behavior. Hamer and other gene sleuths suspect a \"harm-avoidance\" gene causing feelings of increased anxiety when danger threatens. T h e presence of the harm-avoidance gene would thus ameliorate the effects of a gene that urges one to take risks. Of course, genes influence our feelings but feelings alone don't determine behavior. Our feelings are tempered by our experiences and our accumulated experiences determine how our genetic propensities are played out.\n\nHow does the novelty-seeking gene help explain the mystery of why people support the idea of government control? Most people aren't drawn to experimentation and change, and follow the dictates of custom and tradition. I would wager that this majority doesn't carry the gene. T h e minority that do carry it become the engines of change in society. As I interpret the evidence, those with a high novelty-seeking score feel compelled to experiment outside the boundaries of tradition. Does this indicate that those of us who struggle to live as sovereign individuals are doomed to remain in the minority, and that the growing trend toward big government is the fate of mankind? Although the majority will always support the status quo, history also teaches us that the novelty-seekers, with their experimentation, do influence the course of history. Explorers like Columbus do discover new worlds, and intellectual adventurers like Thomas Paine do alter the course of society. In social evolution, just as in biological evolution, more efficient ideas eventually win the evolutionary contest. There are two systems evolving, biological and social. Over millions of years, biological evolution has programmed each of us to be self-interested. This biological programming seduces individuals entrusted with political power to abuse that power. But social technology is the product of an evolutionary process, as well. In their quest for safety and security in societies, individuals have experimented with various forms of governments. All forms that have evolved to date grant power to some individual or small group of individuals. Our biological nature guarantees that individuals given political power will tend to be corrupted by that power, yet social evolution has not become sufficiently advanced to create systems of government that don't hand power to individuals. Fortunately, evolution has also created the novelty-seeking gene, and the novelty-seekers, scat-tered throughout the human population, will continue to resist the status quo. We are also individually programmed to act in our own selfinterest, so we resist being subjugated by the State. I believe our experimentation will eventually lead to the evolution of a new social system in which the concept of government will change and a new status quo will be created. T h e majority will still accept the customs and traditions of the society into which they are born. However, those customs and traditions will\n\nno longer be that governments should have arbitrary powers over individuals. Rather, all individuals will be sovereign unto themselves. The \" P T \" Life... Is It For YOU? By John Pugsley, The Sovereign Individual, February 2002 More than a decade ago, an interesting character with the nom de plume of \"Bill Hill\" penned a popular escape manual for freedom advocates titled P T — T h e Perpetual Traveler. Hill had spent much of his life traveling the world, visiting the continents, regions, countries, and cities that interested him, while carefully avoiding staying in each place long enough to be considered a permanent 4\n\nThe Meaning of Natural Liberty resident and therefore subject to such unpleasantries as taxes, military service, and other local rules and regulations. Hill argued that in a world in which every spot on the globe is under the forcible control of one gang of politicians or another, the answer for individual sovereignty is to avoid their control by becoming a \"PT,\" an acronym for a Perpetual Traveler, Prior Taxpayer, or Permanent Tourist. T h e ability to become a full-fledged Bill Hill style PT—i.e., living a life absolutely free of taxation, restrictions and obligations imposed by most governments—depends a great extent on your citizenship. U . S . citizens, for example, are liable for taxes on their worldwide income, wherever they travel or live. I've spent many years living outside the United States. But, because I haven't relinquished my U . S . citizenship (yet), living an expat lifestyle has provided very minimal tax advantages. Most countries, however, impose tax on the basis of residency, not citizenship. Move abroad for at least a year or two and thereafter, the mother country ignores you, at least in reference to income tax. Therefore, for citizens of most countries, the PT lifestyle could legally eliminate income (and with proper planning, estate) taxes, along with along with achieving many other goals of individual sovereignty. A dozen years ago I became friends with Paul and Vicki Terhorst, who could be\n\nconsidered a poster couple for the PT concept. Paul began his career as an accountant. After working his way up to a partnership in Peat Marwick, he and Vicki decided that what they really wanted in life was freedom from routine, and the opportunity to travel. Paul tetired at age 35, and for the past 18 years Paul and Vicki have made do on a modest income from their investments, while leisurely wandering the world. After retirement they spent eight years in Argentina, then lived in Mexico, London, Thailand, Bali, Australia, Paris, and even had a couple short stints in the United States. Often they just hit the road for several months, revisiting their favorite countries or exploring new ones. Right now, they're spending a few months in my current hometown of Carlsbad, California. Since they've chosen to remain U . S . citizens, there are no significant tax advantages to their PT lifestyle. They file tax returns every year and meticulously declare all investment income, in spite of the fact that their investment accounts are offshore. And they are careful not to do anything that would constitute legal residence in any state with a personal income tax. Thus, they carry Nevada driver's licenses, and keep their financial records and mailing address in the state of Washington (several states including Nevada, Texas, Florida and Washington do not tax personal incomes). To Paul and Vicki, the allure of the PT life has less to do with keeping out from under the scrutiny of Big Brother and minimizing taxes than with being free of the routines. Travel and exploration is their idea of the sovereign life. If the PT life sounds attractive, it's probably more achievable than you might imagine. T h e communications revolution has dissolved the chains that bound many professions to urban offices. However, Paul and Vicki have demonstrated that if you're willing to trade the security of roots and possessions for travel and leisure, it can be done on a very modest income. They've written about their own strategies to show the way. Paul's book, Cashing In on The American Dream: How to Retire at 35 is presently out of print, but you can learn about their techniques and follow them in their travels through their Web site, www.geocities.com/TheTropics/ Shores/5315.\n\nWhile not everyone will find being a perpetual traveler fulfilling, it still makes sense to increase our personal sovereignty by adopting any of the elements of the PT concept that fit. T h e full PT plan includes holding citizenship in one country; maintaining official residence in a second; if not retired, domiciling your business in a third; and keeping investment accounts in one or more others. In each case, the country chosen should provide the best and most advanced laws for minimizing 5\n\nThe Meaning of Natural Liberty taxes, optimizing business and investment opportunities, and providing maximum privacy and legal protection from lawsuits. Then, if your business permits and you enjoy travel, you can live the PT life by spending your time in the most interesting places around the world in their prime seasons—London or Aspen in July and August, January and February in the Bahamas or New Zealand, April and May in Paris, and so on. The goal of every sovereign individual is to maintain control of his or her life and property, which coincide nicely with the PT concept. These are goals for which members of T h e Sovereign Society can strive to achieve. PT: What's It All About? PT, 1996 A p/vilosoplry and a way of life for those willing to roam the world seeking maximum freedom and personal liberty. Do you want to escape the control over your life and property now held by modern Big Brother government? T h e PT concept could be called \"individual sovereignty,\" because PTs look after themselves. We do not want or need authorities to dominate every aspect of our existence. T h e PT concept is to break free. It is a coherent philosophy, a plan for a stressfree, healthy, prosperous life unlimited by government interference, threats of\n\nwar, environmental contamination, litigation, domestic conflicts, taxation, persecution or harassment. PT offers escape. It is a way out of any negative situation. Many individuals choose to vent their frustrations with acts of violence. T h e PT merely avoids conflict by refusing to play where the rules are unfair. W h a t Does P T Mean? PT stands for many things, Perpetual Traveler or Permanent Tourist, for instance. However, a PT need not always travel. T h e PT merely arranges his paperwork so that all governments consider him a tourist, a person just Passing Through. In the eyes of government officials, the PT is merely on a temporary sojourn, and as such is not subject to taxes, military service, lawsuits or persecution. Unlike most citizens or subjects, the PT will not be persecuted for his beliefs or lack of them. PT is a concept, a way of life, a way of perceiving the universe and finding your place in it. One can be a dedicated PT all the time or part-time. PT is elegant, simple and requires no accountants, attorneys, offshore corporations or other complex arrangements. It's the Perfect Thing. Governments, under the guise of protecting us, intrude into every area of life, taking our earnings in taxes and rewarding us with restrictions and harassment. Modern government has virtually eliminated individual privacy and continues to limit freedom of choice in many areas of human activity. T h e constitutions of most nations give lip-service to the absolute freedom to travel, but in practice governments severely limit travel with passport, visa and other requirements. Personal finances, currency controls, domestic situations and job requirements make the freedom to go anywhere at anytime just a dream for most people. T h e properly equipped PT operates outside the usual rules, gaining perfect mobility and full human rights. PT is the logical and natural path to freedom from political whims and destructive buteaucracy.\n\nPerpetual Traveler PTs, People of Talent, can, at a few strokes of the pen, be truly free of Big\n\nBrother. Since oppressors and exploiters in the modern world exercise control with paperwork and computers, your prime objective is to disappear from all lists and registers of any kind. Once that is accomplished, your present government will lose interest in you. You have ceased to be a citizen or subject. It is the goal of the PT to achieve this invisibility by acquiring a new nationality and an offshore address. 6\n\nThe Meaning of Natural Liberty PT freedom extends beyond monetary concerns. Neither the PT nor his family need be inconvenienced by government-instigated wars or military service. T h e flexibility and mobility of being a PT means you will never be an unwilling draftee, victim, inmate, casualty or refugee. PTs pick their fights and choose their surroundings. They are not swept along in torrents caused by forces beyond their control. T h e PT remains comfortably beyond the reach of Big Brother's grasp. Governments cannot easily attack or wipe out an amorphous group with no consistent behavior patterns. Government officials see PTs as the most desirable kind of tourist, respectful of local authority, low profile and prosperous. Thus, unlike publicity-seeking tax rebels, a PT courts no danger and invites no confrontations. Avoid T a x e s Legally By merely moving abroad and establishing a legally recognized residence and domicile in a tax haven, an investor can legally avoid handing over half of his income to the bureaucrats. He is free to roam the world, provided he does not remain anywhere long enough to be considered a resident for tax purposes. Thus, the PT avoids most income taxes without resorting to fraud, because fraud is unnecessary. In most cases a theoretically perfect PT need never file tax returns, government-required disclosure forms or other needless paperwork. If you don't enjoy forcible extractions from your bank account or restrictions on your basic human rights, then you can easily move and declare yourself to be a legal resident of any place you please. No government has the legal right or ability to tax a PT who neither lives within its borders permanently nor has any\n\nassets there. T h e PT is free to enrich the world with his talent, skills, invention, industry or artistry and then enjoy 100 percent of the fruits of his enterprise. Unlimited, untaxed wealth and the power to dispose of it as you please are two of the major benefits of becoming a PT. PTs can produce good things, be paid in full without withholdings or deductions and then spend their earnings as they please.\n\nP T Possibilities As PTs, only self-imposed restrictions can keep us from experiencing the wonders of the world. T h e PT can and will drive, fly or sail across international frontiers, moving freely without need of exit permits or entry visas. T h e PT is able to move fast and decisively, to disappear and resurface anywhere, anytime. PTs believe one must raise self-consciousness about the nature of freedom and rid one's self of limitations. P T M e a n s T r u e F r e e d o m PTs can study any philosophy, raise and educate our children in our beliefs and opinions without contradiction from government-controlled school curriculum. We can pass on our knowledge according to our inner lights. We need not follow the dictates of an obtuse school commissar who bans books and forbids truths we find self-evident. As PTs we are able to invent, reject or follow any religion, personal morality or way of life we choose. For those with unconventional thoughts, habits or beliefs, PT is the answer. PTs need not abide by regulations or laws they find offensive, inconvenient or immoral. PT is all about options. T h e more options, the greater the freedom. This freedom does not mean a PT can be irresponsible, causing problems, injury or pain to others. As PTs we can vote with our feet, but the trip doesn't have to be irrevocable or permanent. The PT can leave until things get better, then return. T h e PT gains the world, while giving up nothing except the treadmill that is life as most people know it.\n\n7 The Meaning of Natural Liberty\n\nFollow Your Heart by Gary Scott, The Sovereign Individual, July 1999 How two world travelers found just the right home simply by following the dictates of their hearts. Those who choose to change residence to regain control over their lives often jump from the frying pan into the fire. Recently, I received a call from a reader who told me he was moving out of the United States to get away from Big Brother and reduce taxes. \"Have you ever lived abroad?\" I asked. \"Never have,\" he replied. \"Visit first,\" was all I could add, knowing that it's usually cheaper to live in the United States and pay tax. I have found there is a better process than checking tax regimes to figure out where to live. To start this process, look within, rather than without. Look for ways to do more of what you want and should do with people you like. T h e action you take in life is more important than money. If you follow your heart (intuition) and invest and live in places that interest and attract you, your life gets better and your financial success will grow. W h e n you are no longer consumed by money, it comes more easily. W h e n you are on your own unique and correct path, synchronicity takes over and resolves issues that may formerly have appeared to be unresolvable. Intuition W o r k s ! To show how this works, allow me to share what happened to my wife, Merri, and me when we left the United States and began investing in and moving toward our dreams.\n\nI have been concerned with the Y2K millennium bug for years. But what can one do? This computer problem is so complex no one knows what will really happen. How much should one do to prepare ? I was grappling with this problem when our hearts became enthralled with the people who are Inca descendants and live in Ecuador. We became so involved in the Andes that I forgot about Y2K and started an Ecuadorian business. We followed our intuition and the monetary rewards became better than we could have ever imagined. Exactly the right people, land, ideas and information popped up exactly when they were needed. Call it synchronicity, felicity or just good luck, but an extra financial power came along when we let go of our monetary motives and began to follow our dreams. T h e magic worked in every way. For example, we had been trying for years to find a farm in North Carolina and nothing had seemed to work. Yet, when we decided with our Ecuadorian partners that we needed such a place in the Blue Ridge Mountains, a farm that the owners had previously refused to sell suddenly became available. But the deal was even better. Along with the 179 acres we expected and had tried to buy (without success) an extra 28 acres were thrown in free. Suddenly the perfect plantation we needed in Ecuador also appeared at just the perfect altitude, the perfect location, perfect pure volcanic water and natural organic food supply and of course, the perfect price. But the benefits of this approach reached into all levels. For example, Merri and I had no thought about the Y2K benefits when we started planning our Ecuadorian move, yet we ended up with a Y2K solution better than we could ever have conceived. We'll begin the new millennium living on land where we are self-sufficient in food, water and energy. Our Ecuadorian friends who live there with us are almost Y2K proof as their culture has lived beautifully without much technology for the last 500 years! We started the venture because of our interest and not money or the need to protect ourselves from Y2K. Yet, we expect this venture to be very profitable and our Y2K needs have been resolved.\n\nApparent T a x Benefits\n\nT h e benefits don't end there. My tax attorney told me that 1 had stumbled into one of the The Meaning of Natural Liberty greatest tax benefits around. On the land, we are developing a center for longevity in a 50 percent partnership with local villagers. T h e center will offet ancient purification techniques that the Andeans have never before shared. Because this is half owned by non-Americans, the centet can defer U . S . taxes on its business income. All we had to worry about was Ecuadotian tax. We did not start this business as a tax shelter. Our goal was to help protect and preserve the wonderful valley where the center is situated, to help employ Ecuadorians, and to help share the wondrous Ecuadorian knowledge. But the synchronicity didn't end there. A second incredible tax benefit appeated. Just as we began moving, Ecuador abolished all income and corporate tax. We'll live in Ecuador tax free! W h e n you follow your heart and not just your tax advisor you become more independent, self-sufficient, altruistic, connected, revitalized and respected, and gain a greater self-worth. You automatically become a better investor too! You don't have to abandon your investing disciplines either. Quite the opposite. By narrowing your participation into areas you really enjoy, you'll have more time to apply greater economic sense and thought to your endeavors. Plus, you'll gain help from the universe you can't acquire in any other way. This can quickly put you on the path to personal sovereignty and wealth. Big Brother's Tyranny PT, 1996 There is not an adult alive who has not had unpleasant or annoying encounters with government bureaucrats. These experiences should serve as warnings of what to expect in more important matters. Serious, life-threatening troubles with government are like cancer. They strike unexpected-ly. You could be lucky, but it is not always the guy next door who will be the victim, crushed by the gtinding wheels of bureaucracy. Government actions, not cancer, A I D S or heart attacks, have been the greatest killers throughout histoty. They are the primary cause of human injuries and\n\npremature death. Governments, not natutal disasters, bear most of the blame for the suffering in the world. Vast numbers of good patriotic citizens are murdered in needless wars, displaced by government engineered relocations or starved by famines caused by government intentions or stupidity. We do not have to look far to find examples of good, innocent people whose lives have been needlessly destroyed by oppressive systems. T h e former Soviet Union used to drug dissidents and confine them to mental wards. They were not alone. Consider the case of the German-Jewish teenager whose biography I recently read. He was shipped to boarding school in England during the Hitler era. In England, he was not permitted to finish the schooling that had been ptepaid fot him, but instead was interned as an enemy alien for the duration of the war. No matter which way he turned, government, those seen by historians as both good and bad, sought only to take away his freedom or his life. All extreme right-and left-wing governments are ruthless, inhuman and wellorganized oppressors. They don't let civilized concepts of human rights stand in their way. Governments are, always have been and always will be dangerous, warlike and immoral institutions. No government is innocent of such proclivities, unless it is totally inept, powerless and inefficient. Belize, Portugal and Costa Rica come close to our ideal. After all, anarchy does permit the most individual freedom. In war and in peace, in democracies or in dictatorships, under capitalists or under communists, strong centralized governments can make original thinking or succeeding visibly in any endeavor dangerous to your health. Governments are like fires, they can be useful. A fire can warm, if you can control it. A fire can also cook your goose. Sooner or later you will surely be involved in a con-9\n\nThe Meaning of Natural Liberty frontation with Big Brother. For those who have not read George Orwell's classic satire 1984, in which the expression \"Big Brother\" was coined for the first time, get a copy and do so at once. Thus prepared, you will gain a better understanding of what I perceive as a clear and present danger: rampant government and big bureaucracy. In most democratic countries, there is the illusion that citizens\n\ncontrol government, but the reality is that Big Brother is here today and will not be gone tomorrow. Western man in our present day Big Brother world is nothing more than a dog on a leash. And that leash is getting shorter, due to the ridiculous and destructive laws that have been passed. T h e laws in most countries are so pervasive that one cannot get out of bed and engage in any economic activity for even a single day without breaking enough laws to go to prison. Everyone who is or has been in an executive position or who has owned his own business knows exactly what I am talking about. Record-keeping requirements alone are almost impossible to maintain. Individuals of every occupation and profession, even those on the dole, are required to file a multitude of documents and papets, all within testricted time limits. A seemingly infinite number of worthless rules, laws, regulations and legal precedents can get even the most honest person into hot water. Furthermore, many activities previously considered to be purely civil matters have been reclassified as criminal offenses. T h e difference between civil and ctiminal penalties is enormous. If you lose a civil case, you pay damages. If government is involved, civil damages usually take the form of back taxes or relatively reasonable fines. However, if criminal charges have been brought against you, jail may well be your next stop. No, you will not be allowed to pass go, but all of your assets will probably be confiscated. Also, as criminal cases are easier to win and offer more opportunities of career advancement for prosecutors, few civil cases remain purely civil these days. There are, unfortunately, few areas of human activity remaining that cannot in some way land you in jail when things go wrong. Working in combination with this increase in senseless legislation is an alarming decline in personal privacy in most parts of the world. Nameless, faceless petty government officials can press a few buttons to find out what magazines you read, what videos you rent, where you travel, whom you call or who calls you. In the modern electronic world, it is a simple matter for government investigators to uncover every financial transaction you have ever made, or at least those that appear in your proper name with yout proper taxpayer identification number. Armed with such information, a skilled team of investigators can, if they wish, apply pressure or build a legal case against you for many victimless crimes from\n\nadultery to tax evasion, or for having failed to meet one of a myriad of technical requirements. Government or private investigators can and will quickly find out how much money you earn and where it is deposited or invested. They can also dig up quite a few damaging \"facts\" that are completely incorrect as a great deal of the information is culled from other people's files, intercepted mail and a mish-mash of unreliable sources and misinterpreted material. Unfortunately, you can never know for certain what they have in theit mound of manure. Although this proliferation of new and senseless laws and the accompanying decline in personal freedom may look accidental, there is method to the madness. As almost no one is in full 100 percent compliance with the various laws and regulations now in existence, we all become criminals by definition. Government prosecutors like a situation in which everyone is a potential criminal and thus a potential victim. T h e fact that we are not all prosecuted is due to luck and selective enforcement. T h e government cannot go after all law breakers. Big Brother can only shoot down those who provoke confrontations or otherwise stand out from the crowd. 10 The Meaning of Natural Liberty\n\nWritten in the Whirlwind by Robert E. Bauman, JD, September 1998 There's an old saying about \"straws in the wind\" indicating future events. If true, the international monsoon directed against legal tax avoidance should tell us something about the future. What we're seeing is an official hurricane headed directly at legitimate offshore tax, business and banking haven nations. And if the tax-hungry bureaucrats have their way, national sovereignty and independence will top the casualty disaster list. It's all part of a concerted battle Big Brother government is waging against personal liberty on many fronts. T h e Brussels bureaucrats running the European\n\nUnion, under the hypoctitical banner of \"tax harmonization\" (meaning \"high taxes for all\"), demand an EU-wide withholding tax on interest income earned by foreigners. Alternately they want a snitch-reporting system that informs a non-resident interest earner's home government of any and all offshore income. In London, the Labour government demands \"reform\" of financial laws in the Channel Islands and on the Isle of Man. Never mind that these constitutionally independent territories have had the right to enact such laws as they see fit since the Norman Conquest. Whitehall bluntly has informed Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man they must write foreign tax evasion into local law as a criminal offense. Similarly, U.K. pressure is mounting on offshore dependencies such as Bermuda and the Cayman Islands to enact \"all crimes\" money laundering laws (including tax evasion) that go far beyond anything ever envisioned as anti-drug measures. In defiance, the Caymans and the British Virgin Islands, bless them, have adopted statutes specifically excluding \"fiscal crimes.\" What should worry freedom lovers everywhere is that \"tax avoidance\" is now being rewritten to mean \"tax evasion\" both wrapped neatly into the all-purpose indictment of \"money laundering.\" Throw in police forfeiture powers and you have a tax collectors' nirvana. Instant, self-financing government tax grabs. At a June 1998 conference in New York, the United Nations sought to impose this expansive redefinition on the world at large. T h e draft UN report argues the common theme in financial crimes is the \"enabling machinery\" that exists in haven nations. T h e UN sees these haven nations (18 in the Caribbean, 16 in Europe, 11 in Asia and 6 in the Middle East and Africa) as \"an enormous hole in the international legal and financial system\" that must be plugged firmly and fast. In effect, the UN wants to end and/or control the \"proliferation\" of offshore trusts and international business corporations, attorney-client privilege, use of free trade zones and the operation of gambling casinos. For good measure, they demand an enforceable international financial reporting system in which all nations will be forced to participate. Goodbye national sovereignty! T h e UN minces few words in demanding that the world must \"face the issue of the use of sovereignty by some countries to give citizens of other countries a\n\nway around the laws of their own society.\" Can we now expect to see multinational tax-collecting expeditions dispatched to Panama or the British Virgin Islands? Will CNN flash scenes of legions of armed accountants flooding ashore in the Cook Islands under the UN banner? T h e Wall Street Journal editorially questioned Europe's lack of concerted action in foreign policy matters. \"The EU's most obvious deficiency is that it lacks the military muscle to back up its declarations.\" It also needs political unanimity, which Switzerland and Luxembourg are unlikely to grant on most financial restriction issues. But who knows what will happen? After years of talk, diplomats meeting in Rome on July 17, 1998 created an international court to punish those who commit \"war crimes and atrocities.\" One-hundred twenty nations, including all those in Europe, voted for it; six (including the U.S., Istael, India and China) opposed; and 21 abstained. T h e coutt, destined for location in the Hague, the World Court's long-time hang out, will step in when a nation's justice system is deemed by othet 11\n\nThe Meaning of Natural Liberty nations as being unable or unwilling to act. T h e day may come when a gradual redefinition (as with money laundering) will expand the scope of \"war crimes\" to include the \"war\" against tax avoidance. T h e Nuremberg Trials will be child's play by comparison. [Ed. Note: In 2003 the world criminal court came into existence at The Hague, with the United States government refusing to participate or recognize its claimed jurisdiction over U.S. diplomats or members of the U.S. military.] Speaking of freedom, in 1976 the late U . S . Supreme Court justice, William O. Douglas, warned, \"As nightfall does not come all at once, neither does oppression. In both instances, there is a twilight when everything remains seemingly unchanged. And it is in such twilight that we all must be most aware of change in the air 'however slight,' lest we become unwitting victims of the darkness.\"\n\nAdopt a New Country by Marshall J. Langer, The Tax Exile Report, 1997 A noted international tax expert shares with you his ideas about how to reduce your taxes to an absolute minimum—if you are willing to make a new home for yourself. I personally believe you would be much better off moving to another country than you would be trying to roam the world just a step ahead of those who may pursue you. Some advisers suggest that the best way to escape from Big Brother's tax clutches is to become a low-profile world traveler. I disagree. That may have worked well in the pre-computer days when people could simply disappear from the system never to surface again. Today, if you are a significant taxpayer in any high-tax country, the government's computers should quickly notice your absence. T h e tax authorities may simply monitor your situation on an ongoing basis, waiting for the right time to pounce. It is very difficult to become a true world traveler in today's computerized world. If you move from a high-tax country to a tax haven such as the Cayman Islands everyone will know exactly what you have done. If, on the other hand, you move from one high-tax country to another high-tax country you may not be watched nearly as closely. In fact, some high-tax countries treat newcomers rather well. I suggest that you consider establishing a new homeland in a hospitable high-tax country rather than moving to a notorious tax haven or wandering from place to place forever.\n\nThe Growing Sovereign Individual Movement by Nicholas Pullen, 1998 Globalization of the world economy and the advent of immensely improved telecommunications have for many made it possible to live where we \"want\" to live rather than whete we \"have\" to live. So says Roger Gallo in his excellent book, Escape From America.\n\nThough the title of the book suggests a work exclusively for U.S. citizens it is, in fact, an indispensable resource for any individual seeking to escape the negative impositions of any government. And every day more individuals are seeking to do just that. Everywhere, people are choosing to escape restrictions, limitations and complications at \"home\" by physically relocating themselves and their affairs to countries where they can enjoy greater freedom. F r e e d o m Desired T h e freedoms these people desire take many forms and depend as much on individual consider-12\n\nThe Meaning of Natural Liberty ations as anything else. I have spoken to numerous individuals who have waved goodbye to their \"home\" government in order to enjoy their own particular brand of freedom. Their motivations were many and varied. Some were sick and tired of paying high taxes. No longer prepared to be milked like cattle, they chose to relocate to countries where they get to keep more of their hard-earned wealth. Some were tired of relentless government infringement and intfusion at home. So they relocated to countries where personal and financial privacy are still respected. Some felt unsafe at home. They wanted to be free of high crime levels, avaricious litigants, malevolent bureaucrats and corrupt politicians. So they moved to countries offering security, political stability and social harmony. Some felt they could secute bettet opportunities and a better future for their childten than were available at home by telocating to younger, emerging countries with healthier economies.\n\nMany people left their home shores to go in seatch of places whete they could enjoy a significantly lower cost of living, cut-price real estate and setvice charges considerably less inflated than their equivalent at home. Othets left home to enjoy a more attractive climate, a better environment, a more relaxed pace of life and, in one case I know about, bettet skiing and a thriving social scene. Every expatriate I spoke to had cast off the shackles imposed by their home government for different reasons. But they all agree on one fundamental point: increased mobility and sophisticated technology make it perfectly practicable to live and conduct business, financial and personal affairs from almost anywhete in the world. A computer, a modem and a telephone line make it perfectly feasible for anybody to stay in touch with friends and family, run a business, work and remain in contact with financial advisors, bankers and professionals worldwide at the touch of a button. And the rest of the world is never more than a flight away. This is the gospel of the Sovereign Individual. And the word is spreading. Flight from t h e U . S . We only have to take a look at U.S. State Department figures issued toward the end of 1997. These illustrate how the principles of the Sovereign Individual are catching on in the U . S . Thete are now 3.3 million Americans living abroad (excluding government and military personnel). Over the last 30 years the numbet of Ameticans going offshote to seek out lower living costs, better lifestyles and more freedoms has quadrupled. And the rate of exit continues to accelerate. Evety year, mote and more Americans are waving farewell to Uncle Sam and relocating to every corner of the globe where freedoms remain available and intact. T h e U.S. State Department used to publish annual statistics on the number of Americans renouncing their citizenship, but this infotmation is no longet being made public. It isn't hatd to figure out why. High tax bracket Ameticans must renounce their citizenship to escape from the U.S. tax net, which is imposed on all citizens regardless of residence. With countless thousands of Americans\n\npaying seven-digit tax bills while teceiving little in the way of benefits to show for it, it isn't hard to undetstand why an exodus of the best and btightest has begun. Flight from E u r o p e And it isn't just Americans turning their backs on their countries of origin. Every week I speak to Germans, Britons, Dutch, French, Scandinavians and individuals of every conceivable nationality who are unhappy with the services and rights theit taxes buy at home. These people ate looking for alternative governments, alternative service providers who offer cheaper services, less restrictions, more freedom and an improved quality of life. Simply flipping through the papers on the desk in front of me and reading some of the reports and bulletins sent in by contacts, it becomes blatantly evident why so many people ate disillusioned 13\n\nThe Meaning of Natural Liberty by life at \"home.\" T h e German government has been particularly busy attacking privacy lately. German police officers were awarded the right to bug private homes and eavesdrop on private conversations. Federal agencies in the U . S . have 15,000 \"wild, out of control\" informants on their payrolls. Now the Germans want to play follow-my-leader. T h e German tax department is eagerly awaiting the outcome of a Finance Ministry meeting which will consider awarding cash rewards to informants who squeal on tax evaders. It is easy to foresee the abuses to which such activities could lead. In Switzerland, the police have been secretly following mobile phone users through a telephone computer company. In Britain, mobile phone companies are understood to have come to an arrangement with law enforcement agencies to provide coding information on individual phones used by suspected criminals. This will mean the police can track anybody who has their mobile phone switched on. All ovet Europe, bank employees are being used as unpaid government\n\ninformers, and cameras and surveillance equipment are springing up at seaports, airports, on roads, in the streets and in public buildings. We are told this development is to fight crime. But all too often in the past we have seen technology originally introduced to fight ctime subsequently directed at private, non-criminal citizens. If you live in the U.K., on any average day you are caught on camera up to 14 times. Many Western governments are working on and introducing technology capable of scanning individual faces and recording them. Pretty soon it will be difficult for Westerners to move without their government's surveillance network knowing about it and recording it. And you won't need reminding that every day that ever dawns in the U.S. sees possibly innocent, unsuspecting individuals embroiled in the latest deployment of draconian civil asset forfeiture laws or predatoty litigation. Every day sees fresh civil liberties violations. Every day sees the death of another freedom. E x o d u s N o Surprise We shouldn't be surprised that people have had a gut full. We shouldn't be surprised that more and more individuals are voting with their feet. On the evidence of the above we should only be surprised that more Americans and Europeans aren't following the example. Inevitably more will. This is the age of the Sovereign Individual. Increasing mobility and sophisticated telecommunications technology has made it possible to find freedom offshore without sactificing eatning potential, personal relationships or convenience. When you relocate offshore the only things you sactifice are your relationships with a government that doesn't respect your freedom and a tax authority that only has eyes fot your personal wealth. I don't think the termination of either of these relationships is a sactifice. I think of the end of such nightmarish associations as a blessing. Y o u r O w n E s c a p e Plan? You may alteady be numbered among these sovereign individuals enjoying your new-found freedom. It may be that you are already considering escaping your government yourself.\n\nIf you fall into the latter category you may want to consider the findings of a study published by the Swiss-based Corporate Resource Group rating the best cities worldwide for expatriates to live in. The survey focuses on \"quality of living issues\" and rates cities fot political and economic stability, ctime, pollution, health, environment and schooling. T h e top ten ranked cities for expattiates were, in descending order: Vancouver, Auckland, Toronto, Zurich, Geneva, Melbourne, Sydney, Helsinki, Vienna and Brussels. If you're considering looking for a suitable destination to escape to or even weighing up the options just in case you need to move fast in the future, you might focus your initial research on these cities. 14\n\nThe Meaning of Natural Liberty Are You a Libertarian? by Vincent H. Miller, 1998 One of its American leaders recalls the history and growth of the Libertarian movement—and asks you to examine your own political conscience. What is a libertarian? T h e catch phrase, \"Fiscally conservative; socially liberal,\" explains it— sort of. But simplifications often lose the essence of what they describe. Basically a libertarian is a person who believes in individual liberty, an unregulated market economy and social tolerance for diverse lifestyles. It's a \"live and let live\" philosophy. T h e foundation of libertarianism is the Non-Aggression Principle, which states that no one may initiate force or fraud against others. This is sometimes stated as, \"First, do no harm,\" or in the biblical turn of phrase, \"Thou shalt not aggress.\" Many libertarians trace their roots back to the eighteenth and nineteenth century\n\nclassical free trade liberals to England's Adam Smith, John Locke, John Cobden, Richard Bright, French philosopher Frederic Bastiat and others. Others look to nineteenth-century American individualist anar-chists such as William Lloyd Gatrison, Lysander Spooner, and Henry David Thoreau. Modern G r o w t h T h e modern libertarian movement, however, has been most strongly influenced by the late Austrian economist Ludwig Von Mises, Mises' protege and Nobel Laureate, F. A. Hayek, and Nobel Laureate Milton Friedman of the University of Chicago. Perhaps the most influential of all was the novelist and philosopher Ayn Rand, whose novels, plays, and essays strongly influenced the new wave of libettarians. T h e message of her epic novel Atlas Shrugged has been so powerful that a joint survey by the Book of the Month Club and the Library of Congress ranked Atlas Shrugged second only to the Bible as the book that had most influenced people's lives. Although there have been pockets of libertarian influence throughout history, the modern movement began to gain momentum in the 1940s. With the founding of Leonard Read's Foundation for Economic Education at Irvington-on-Hudson, New York, and the near-simultaneous publication of Rand's The Fountainhead, Hayek's The Road to Serfdom, Isabel Paterson's The God of the Machine, Rose Wilder Lane's The Discovery of Freedom and Mises' Human Action, the modern libertarian movement took its first steps. It wasn't until the publication of Atlas Shrugged in 1957 that the Libertarian movement as we know it today regained its stride. During those earliest years, a whole generation was inspired by Rand's libertarian message of individualism and uncompromising free-market capitalism. It was all the more amazing given that libertarianism began evolving during the era of President Roosevelt's socialist/fascist New Deal. Libertarian pioneers such as author Rose Wilder Lane and H. L. Mencken, columnist for the Baltimore Evening Sun, vigorously attacked the socialism and collectivism of the New Deal and paved the way for a much larger and more influential movement which later developed.\n\nA seminal moment of the modern libertarian movement was the 1969 convention of the pioneer young conservative group, Young Americans for Freedom (YAF) in St Louis, Missouri. Since the founding in 1960 of this association of young Barry Goldwater conservatives, there had been an uneasy peace between YAF's traditionalist conservative wing and the libertarian-Randian wing. Libertarian opposition to the Vietnam War, the military draft and other human rights issues finally erupted into full-scale political war. This confrontation resulted in a purge of the libertarians, who left en masse and met under St. Louis Gateway Arch to found a new movement. Luminaries such as Karl Hess, author of the 1960 Republican platfotm and a fotmet Goldwater-Nixon-Ford speech writer, Leonard Liggio, who would later become president of the Institute for 15\n\nThe Meaning of Natural Liberty Humane Studies, and most of the International Society for Individual Liberty's (ISIL) current board members were thete. At this time ISIL's sister organization the Society fot Individual Liberty (SIL) was formed as an umbrella group for disenfranchised libertarians. From this new beginning the movement grew. SIL produced a comprehensive series of educational pamphlets which sold in the millions. They organized tax protest days, and created a network of activist student chapters in colleges and universities across the nation. In 1971, SIL member David F. Nolan founded the Libertarian Party in his Denver, Colorado, living room. In the years following the historic 1969 conservative/libertarian split, many of the movement's intellectual institutions formed: Laissez Faire Books, Reason magazine and the Reason Foundation, the Cato Institute, the Institute for Humane Studies, the Ludwig von Mises Institute and more. A n Intellectual F o r c e Today libertarianism in America, if not a major success at the ballot box, is an intellectual force to be reckoned with.\n\nOne of the key contributions of the libertarian movement has been its critical examination and analysis of the proper role of government. This is a subject libettarians take very seriously. For many years the standard line was that since governments enjoy a monopoly on the use of force, its proper role should be limited to those agencies in which such powers seem appropriate, i.e., police, military and courts. Nothing else. An impressive body of litetatute has arisen from the pens of libertarian scholars challenging the role of government in today's society. They have observed that it is difficult to find anything that governments touch that is not eventually turned into a cesspool of corruption, patronage and mind-boggling waste. Competitive markets in a free economy, they assert, can provide most if not all the essential services currently provided by government. Many in the movement, including David Friedman, son of Milton Friedman and authot of a seminal book entitled The Machinery of Freedom, explain that virtually evety function currently provided by governments can be provided better and more inexpensively—not to mention more compassionately—by competitive market institutions. There are interesting arguments of great merit from both sides of this debate. How much better would it be, for example, if organizations like the United Way, churches or other charitable organizations handled welfare instead of government? For example, in America the government wastes over 80 percent of its welfare dollars on mam-moth bureaucracies and their palatial offices, whereas private charities reverse these figures. T h e Social Security system is bankrupt and inflicts a terrible tax burden on the younget genetation. Why not take it out of the hands of corrupt politicians and privatize it? There is a vast library of literature on the privatization of most governmental functions by the world's leading scholars. For those interested, Laissez Faire Books can provide the proper research material. Their book service and informative catalogue is one of the treasures of the libertarian movement. In 1980, I founded the Libertarian International in Ann Arbor, Michigan, with the assistance of Bruce Evoy of Toronto (founder of the Canadian Libertarian Party). In 1982, the first world conference of libertarians was held in Zurich,\n\nSwitzerland. This event brought together widely diverse groups of classical liberals, libertarians and Ayn Rand Objectivists from all over Europe and the world (few of whom had been aware of their brothers and sisters in neighboring countries). A world network was established which attracted an amazingly powerful group of activists and intellectuals. Former industrialist Hubert Jongen of Holland rapidly organized a network of European libertarians, which to this day meets quarterly in Amsterdam. He also organized the 1983 ISIL World Conference in Brussels. In 1989 the Libertarian International and the original SIL merged to form the International 16\n\nThe Meaning of Natural Liberty Society for Individual Liberty. T h e original founders of both of these pioneering organizations fotmed the board of the new educational foundation. Since then, world conferences have been held in most European countries and, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, in many of the former Eastern Bloc countries— the Czech and Slovak Republics, Estonia and Russia. Economics and human rights conferences were held in Swaziland, Southeast Africa, Mexico's Yucatan —even one in San Francisco. Our members became major figures in their home countries. South African advisory board members Leon Louw and Frances Kendall were nominated three times for the Nobel Peace Prize for their work to defuse the explosive environment in their country by installing a Swiss-styled cantonal system—and for setting up a law review project to repeal hundreds of the oppressive apattheid laws. They also had significant input into the drafting of a new Bill of Rights for South Africa. In recent years, we have sponsored hundreds of struggling activists in the developing world, as well as the former countries of the Soviet Eastern Bloc. Today, we are providing support for courageous individuals who are setting up free-market organizations in Belarus, Albania, Serbia and Croatia to name a few countries.

Ayn Rand: A Very Special Person PT, 1996 An examination of the origins and theories put forth by the noted author and influential founder of the Objectivist philosophy. Governments like the idea that innocent people suffer at the hands of new legislation. They know that in our modern world, anyone who achieves any degree of success also inherently becomes a lawbreaker along the way. As a tesult of this arrangement, they can prosecute almost anyone at almost any time. T h e fact that the laws broken are silly, if not uttetly ridiculous, does not in any way miti-gate the severity of a conviction. Again, it seems that those responsible for shaping the movements of government have done their homework. Just as George Orwell demonstrated the need to have a fictitious enemy, Ayn Rand showed the benefits that a government can enjoy by ttansforming its entire population into ipso facto criminals. A Russian expatriate who fled to the United States from Soviet Russia in the 1920s, Ayn Rand went on to become one of the leading authors of this century. Her success is based largely on the public acclaim she received for both her novels and philosophical volumes, but also comes from her general outlook on life. In her view, life belongs exclusively to the individual who shall, in turn, be absolutely free to do with it whatever he pleases, as long as the rights of others are not transgressed. In 1957, Rand published her stunning and immensely significant novel Atlas Shrugged (out of print in Britain, it is still available from Signet Books, New York). In her work, Rand explains exactly how things work in the real world and what may happen if too many people lose sight of the facts. More terrifying still is the realization that much of what Rand predicted has alteady begun to happen in almost every western country.\n\nSet in the U.S. (without mentioning any specific year), the backdrop for Atlas Shrugged is 17\n\nThe Meaning of Natural Liberty industry and the people who make it work. The heroes, according to Rand, are not unionized workers who alternate between whining for shorter hours and demanding more pay for less work, but lather a few, tate capitalists, without whose constant quest for efficiency and profit the engine of the world would stop. In the novel, a number of senseless laws are introduced by government. All are, officially, passed for the common good and public welfare. Competition is testticted by law, lest old and inefficient companies with bloated payrolls lose ground to new, ambitious upstarts. Plans are introduced to spread profits around, lest a few attain \"excessive\" riches. An industrialist, Hank Rearden, invents a revolutionary metal, Rearden Metal. Suspicious, at first, over this new product, the wotld soon realizes that the invention holds supreme advantages over steel and will tevolutionize just about every sector of industry. To make sure that Rearden does not discriminate against those customets who initially refused to buy his product, laws are passed that require him to put a quota-system into operation that ensures everyone will enjoy his state-guaranteed right to buy his \"fair share\" of the output. Even so, Reatden profits mightily due to his years of research and hard work. Soon rival mills, unable to compete against him with theit old-fashioned steel, are driven to the brink of bankruptcy. Making no excuses for his success, Rearden is in due course blackmailed by the government into giving up his patent tights so that all may shate in the benefits of his invention. T h e following excerpt from the book is a verbal exchange between Rearden and Ferris, the emissary of Big Brother who visits the mills to announce the government blackmail. \"You honest men are such a headache, but we knew you'd slip up sooner or later —and this is just what we wanted.\" \"You seem to be pleased about it.\" \"Don't I have good reason to be?\"\n\n\"But, aftet all, I did break one of your laws.\" \"Well, what do you think they'te thete for?\" Dr. Ferris did not notice the sudden look on Rearden's face, the look of a man hit by the first vision of that which he had sought to see. Dt. Fetris was past the stage of seeing; he was intent upon delivering the last blows to an animal caught in a trap. \"Did you really think that we want those laws to be observed?\" said Dr. Ferris. \"We want them broken. You'd better get it straight that it's not a bunch of boy scouts you're up against. We're after power and we mean it. You fellows were pikers, but we know the real trick, and you'd better get wise to it. There's no way to rule innocent men. T h e only power any government has is the power to crack down on criminals. Well, when there aren't enough ctiminals, one makes them. One declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes impossible for men to live without breaking laws. W h o wants a nation of law-abiding citizens? What's there in that for anyone? But just pass the kind of laws that can neither be observed nor enforced nor objectively interpreted—and you create a nation of lawbreakers—and then you cash in on guilt. Now that's the system, Mr. Rearden, that's the game, and once you understand it, you'll be much easier to deal with.\" Translate this to modern-day politics and you quickly see that the so-called \"war on drugs\" is, in fact, nothing but an elaborate scare to make it legal for the state to invade everyone's privacy. A multitude of legislation introduced creates a situation where prosecutots can select and convict almost anyone of a drugrelated crime. If nothing else, Adas Shrugged will open your eyes to what happens in both Europe and the U.S. once politicians, scheming intellectuals and over-ambitious bureaucrats are given too much of a say in your life. I S\n\nThe Meaning of Natural Liberty The New Cold War: Wealth Is the Target\n\nby Robert E. Bauman, JD, 1998 Knowledgeable U . S . lawyers, accountants and tax consultants will admit that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ( I R S ) has declared war on Americans engaged in ttaditional offshore financial activity of nearly every kind. It's a favorite IRS public relations tactic to issue dire \"crack down\" warnings and enforcement threats to keep taxpayers honest. In 1997, the IRS theme was stop \"abusive trusts,\" both domestic and foreign, and those who sell them. T h e IRS believes there is a host of alleged tax evaders and money launderers whom they presume guilty based on the financial tools the accused taxpayer uses. High on the prime IRS target list: those who set up and use international business corporations ( I B C s ) , offshore trusts, and bank accounts in known \"tax haven\" nations, especially where financial privacy laws are strict. This anti-wealth attack is cootdinated with other federal agencies including the U.S. Department of Justice ( D O J ) , the Federal Reserve Board, the U . S . Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, other appropriate police agencies, and sympathetic foreign governments like the U.K. J. Richard Duke, Esq., a leading U . S . asset protection attorney from Birmingham, Alabama, sees the IRS agenda as \"an indiscriminate attack on anyone who dates to shield wealth in ways that until now have been considered entirely legitimate.\" Mr. Duke's view was echoed by Charles A. Cain of the U.K., editor of Offshore Investment, in a February 1998 editorial (\"The New Cold Wat\") in which he charged \"the line between tax avoidance and tax evasion\" is purposely being blurred by governments, with honest people (and theit tax advisots) being jailed for \"failed attempts at tax avoidance\" while \"tax evasion is put down on a moral level with heroine and cocaine pushing.\" Among current programs IRS officials boast of: • A computerized I R S \"wire transfer project\" that matches outbound and inbound wire transfers with individual income tax teturns, or lack theteof. (Keep\n\nin mind the U.S. government has the ability to monitot virtually every electtonic communication that occurs anywhete in the world.); • A continuing review of suspicious IBCs, especially Panamanian IBCs using \"bearer\" shares; • T h e \"Offshore Internet Wagering Project\" looking for unreported income from cyberspace gambling. Scores of people in the U . S . have been arrested for running Internet gambling operations; • T h e auditing of tax returns of offshore trusts with U.S. offices primarily located in the Miami and Los Angeles areas; and • A special effort by the IRS Criminal Investigation Division (CID) to search out \"promoters\" of alleged tax-evading legal structutes, with the goal of indictment, as well as hitting their clients with back taxes due, penalties, interest and possible criminal charges. IRS C I D officials also revealed they now systematically train agents of the FBI, Central Intelligence Agency ( C I A ) and the U . S . Secret Setvice in tax aspects of international crime. They also train police agents from Russia, Spain, Mexico, Brazil, several Central American and Caribbean nations and have established formal \"working relationships\" with Canada, Germany and other nations. Cold W a r Against W e a l t h This is all part of a new international \"Cold War,\" waged by government bureaucrats against 19\n\nThe Meaning of Natural Liberty anyone who seeks lower taxes and less financial tegulation, especially those who choose to go offshore. The IRS battle plan is a despetate gtasp by Big Brother aimed at stopping those who rebel against heavy taxation and the transfer of wealth from productive citizens to unworthy tax consumers. The tax collectors know the most talented citizens of the U.S., U.K. and other\n\nwelfare states are deserting, setting up financial shop whete they and their capital are treated best. This trend is intensified by the developing wotldwide \"cybereconomy\" based on Internet technology and free communications unmediated by governments. What has been called the \"permeability of financial frontiers\" now empowers investors instantly to shift vast sums of money from one nation to another and from one currency to another. T h e 1998-99 \"Asian crisis\" demonsttated this heretofore unparalleled economic force. Myopic liberals welcome these trends as the potential \"collapse of nationhood,\" the chance to establish one-world government and control by institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the European Union. Lovers of liberty with an acute sense of history see instead the potential for liberation of \"the sovereign individual,\" the courageous person who declares independence from \"decrepit and debili-tating welfare states\" as the Wall Street Journal described them. (For more on this debate, read The Sovereign Individual, by James Dale Davidson and Lord William Rees-Mogg, Simon & Schuster, U S $ 2 5 , 1997, an excellent book that explains the coming mass exodus of wealthy people from high tax nations.) No wondet the U.K. Inland Revenue, the IRS and other tax hounds are worried. T h e Economist notes that \"undeclared\" (untaxed) work now exceeds 15 percent of Europe's combined gross domestic product ( G D P ) , up from five percent in the 1970s. In the somewhat freer U.S., the underground \"black market\" economy accounts for nearly 10 percent of GDP. That means billions of dollars slipping through the eager hands of the tax man. Why the growing black market? Confiscatory taxes, exorbitant labor costs, over regulation - all failures of big government. All things bureaucrats love. This coordinated assault on wealth has a strong international dimension as well. T h e U.S., using its considerable powers, and the U.K., using old colonial ties, are turning the screws on national governments who fail or refuse to go along with the conceited anti-offshote wealth attack. Even greater pressure is being applied to international banks who do business in the U.S. or U.K., as well as in known tax and wealth \"haven nations\"—which means nearly every international bank. As that firebrand of the American Revolution, Patrick Henry of Virginia said, \"I\n\nam willing to know the whole truth, to know the worst, and to prepare for it. You have been forewarned and should act accordingly.\" Should You Become A Tax Exile? by Marshall J. Langer, The Tax Exile Report, 1997 Most people are not likely to become tax exiles. Most Ameticans and some British are insular; they tend not to invest abroad and wouldn't think of moving to another country. This section is intended fot those individuals who would consider obtaining a new citizenship and moving abroad. A surprisingly large percentage of wealthy individuals seem to like the idea of being shorn like sheep. They live and work in high-tax countries and they allow their governments to take from them a substantial portion of everything they earn. They tolerate wealth taxes and transfer taxes that take away much of what they own, not only yeat-by-yeat but also when they try to transfet it to their loved ones by gift or inheritance. They sheepishly acquiesce as their governments use the 20\n\nThe Meaning of Natural Liberty power to tax to redistribute their wealth within the society. They tolerate an everincreasing expansion of the Robin Hood theory of taxation, under which governments take from the middle class and the rich and give to the bureaucrats and some of the poor. T a x e s , T a x e s , M o r e T a x e s People generally understand that they have to pay some taxes if they expect to receive any services from their government. Most of us accept that taxes ate the price we pay for a civilized society. T h e problem is that many of us now feel—rightly I think—that we are being gouged by taxes, taxes on taxes, and more taxes. We pay federal taxes, state or provincial taxes and local taxes. We pay two levels of tax on corporate income— first at the corporate level and again at the shareholder level when dividends are paid. Salaries are subject to both a gross income tax (called social security) and a net income tax on the same earnings. Investment income is subject to two\n\ndifferent forms of taxes—an income tax and inflation that strips away the value of the investment. Capital gains tax must often be paid not only on the real gain but also on the appreciation in value that is actually due to inflation. Insular A m e r i c a n s I have represented non-American clients for more than three decades. Many of my clients were either Europeans or former Europeans who had fled to Latin America just before the second World War. These people left nearly everything behind and struggled to build a new life in a new land. Most went to Latin America only because they couldn't get into the U . S . or Canada. Using their European know-how in third-world countries, some of them became immensely wealthy. One of their primary investment objectives was and still is international diversification. They keep perhaps one-third of their money in their new homeland and they divide the rest of it between Europe (mostly in Swiss banks) and North America. More recently, some of them have begun investing a small part of theit wealth in the booming Pacific Basin. Contrast this picture with Americans who typically invest all of their funds in the U.S. Until very recently, most Americans hesitated to put even a small percentage of their assets in as foreign a place as Canada. Anything more foreign than that was unthinkable. Only duting the past two or three years have some Americans begun to buy U.S.-based mutual funds investing in the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America. An article by Anatole Kaletsky in the Times of London discussed and tried to explain the insularity of Americans. Based on a study by Philip Turner entitled Capital Flows in the 1980s, published by the Bank for International Settlements ( B I S ) , Basel, Switzerland, the article asked: If Japanese, German and British investors have been diversifying theit pottfolios into dollars, why has this not been offset by American investors buying up assets in yen, marks and pounds? Financial analysts rarely stop to ask this obvious question. Perhaps it is because the answer, suggested in the BIS study, is too alarming, or simply too damaging to the financial markets' self-esteem. T h e fact is that despite the apparently sophisticated and overdeveloped financial industry operating on Wall Street, American investors are among the most primitive and insulat in the world. In 1990, American pension funds and\n\nlife insurers each held only four percent of their portfolios in foteign assets. Among individual investors, international diversification is almost unheard of. One reason for this is that, despite Washington's free-market rhetoric, America has some of the fiercest and most effective capital controls anywhere in the world. American banks make it almost impossible for individuals to hold foreign currencies, pension fund trustees frequently insist on \"buy America\" investment policies, and matketing restrictions imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission make it illegal for American citizens to invest in most offshore equities, bonds and investment funds. And, he didn't even discuss the nasty tax problems that arise when Americans acquire foreign 21\n\nThe Meaning of Natural Liberty shares or mutual funds. A m e r i c a n s Stay and P a y T h e U.S. Congress and the IRS both know that they have a captive market of taxpayers. Most Americans don't even think in terms of investing outside the U.S. They are incapable of moving abroad ot becoming perpetual tourists. They are horrified at the thought that anyone would give up American citizenship either to avoid taxes or for any other reason. Congress could double present tax rates and most Americans would simply grumble. Most of them would not even consider leaving. They would stay and pay. Many Britons are like that too. During the last Labour government, investment income over about £20,000 a year was taxable at a whopping 98 percent. In the late 1970s, I was asked to advise an elderly British woman how she could reduce her taxes. I suggested that she move to a tax haven such as Bermuda. Her response was: \"Oh, but I wouldn't think of leaving London.\" She stayed and paid. She eventually got a reprieve in the form of lower taxes from Margaret Thatcher's Tory government.\n\nViolence in Our Time by John Pugsley, The Sovereign Individual, June 1999 April 1999 was the cruelest month, bringing unbearable heartbreak in Kosovo as well as in Littleton, Colorado. Both events unnerve and confound us. How can our civilization be so breathtakingly advanced, yet so frighteningly primitive? There is a tendency to believe that we live in a more enlightened age, one in which advancing civilization has risen above the mutderous behavior that charactetized more primitive cultures. Yet, the facts destroy this illusion. T h e dark, violent side of human culture has not been subdued as civilization has aged. T h e twentieth century regimes of Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot and now Milosevic are proof that our \"advanced\" civilization has not advanced in thousands of years. Throughout history people in every nation have searched in vain for solutions to mass slaughter, but they have utterly failed. T h e historians debate past wars, pontificating on how each could have been avoided by better diplomacy or faster response. They place the blame on evil leaders, or they blame some genetic defect of the people, like the militarism of the Germans or the belligerent nature of the Serbs. Occasionally, they blame the meekness of the population for failing to stand up to the rising bullying of a dictator. Sometimes they flail themselves for failing to intervene in time. All these ideas are \"sound and fury signifying nothing.\" In truth, wellintentioned people have failed to stop wars because, in their anguish and frustration, they have not bored deep enough into the chain of causality to discover the ultimate root of war. T h e root of these murderous conflicts is not to be found in the evil nature of the leaders or the perpetrators, a flaw in the race, or strategic errors in responding to tyranny. I'm convinced that the cause of these conflicts lies in a fundamental defect in the concept of government. The core premise of all governmental systems is that to satisfy the needs of the people for defense, protection or property, and securing of rights, power must be relinquished by the many and placed in the hands of a few. Those few, be they kings, dictators or elected representatives, are then expected to exercise that power on behalf of the governed. However, history proves that government inevitably grows corrupt, and that corruption leads to an increasing use of police\n\nand military force, both against foreign \"enemies\" and against its own citizens. Rising taxes, regulations, restrictions, conscriptions and war are built into the nature of government. Why is this inevitable? T h e survival of the human species required the evolution of selfishness. To survive, individuals must be \"hard-wired\" to act first on behalf of their offspring and themselves, 22\n\nThe Meaning of Natural Liberty then on behalf of their close kin. Any system of social organization that expects individuals to act altruistically toward distant and unknown membets of the tribe or nation, rather than considering their own immediate needs and wants, is certain to fail. Yet, that is exactly what is expected of those in government. It is only a matter of time in any nation until the power to tax, regulate and conscript is twisted and used to the personal gain of those in power. Eventually, the lure of power attracts those with the least integrity and greatest lust for personal gain. How can the tragedy in Littleton be rooted in government? It is rooted in the existence of government power. W h e n our youth are indoctrinated on a diet of propaganda glorifying violence and justifying the use of deadly force by the police or the armed forces against enemies of the State, then those few who feel oppressed and who simultaneously tend toward violence, will justify the use of force against their perceived oppressors. T h e violence presented in the media is a symptom of our cultute's fascination with power, not a cause of the existence of either the powet or the violence. T h e endless wars and the mass murders will cease only when individuals learn that it is not necessary for them to seek safety and security through handing power to government. When there is no longer a belief that the group must hand power to someone, then there will no longer be the opportunity for a Milosevic or a Bill Clinton to use that power for his own benefit. When such power is no longer available, thete will no longer be long lines of power-seekers waiting for their turn to grab it. History and the study of human nature lead me unswervingly to the conclusion that the peaceful society will be one in which all individuals are sovereign unto\n\nthemselves. It will be one in which both the tight to self-regulation and the tesponsibility for personal survival and self-defense rest with each individual. As mote and more people elect to become Sovereign Individuals, the world grows closer to the ultimate solution to events like Kosovo and Littleton. It All Starts With Property Rights By John Pugsley, The Sovereign Individual, January 2003 \"To be controlled in our economic pursuits, means to be., .controlled in everything.\" — F . A. Hayek T h e feelings that dtive us to defend ourselves against government oppression are an expression of our innate compulsion to conttol our own property. Each of us shares the feeling that it is unjust and an outrage for our hard-earned wealth to be taken from us without our consent. T h e drive to control our own property is not unique to modern man. Studies of animal species, observations of hunter-gatherer groups still in existence, and the written history of civilization leave no question that territorialism is a biological imperative. As socio-biologist E. O. Wilson argues, \"The biological formula of territorialism translates easily into the ritual of modern property ownership.\" By the time our early hominid ancestors were wandering the African savannah millions of years ago, the genes that expressed the \"property\" instinct were firmly wired into mammalian DNA. T h e Declaration of Independence suggests that the Founding Fathers sensed this aspect of human nature. It atgued that all men \"are endowed by their Creatot with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\" Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, of course, are all aspects of property. T h e long train of abuses and usurpations that drove the founding fathets to rebel were triggered by the same genes that give rise to your rage when someone burglarizes your home, steals your car or defrauds you. Those genes are equally activated when that attack comes from government.\n\nMost would agree that the function of government is to safeguard the property and freedom of citizens. Yet, it must be clear by now that the single greatest threat to any citizen's property is its own government. In the United States, the combined burden of local, state and federal tax immedi-23\n\nThe Meaning of Natural Liberty ately confiscates between 3 0 % and 6 0 % of our annual incomes, and hits anything a person saves again at the point of death. And that's just the beginning. Governments also hold monopolies on licenses and permits which, in many countries, prohibit rather than encourage business enterprise and wealth creation. Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto in his brilliant book Tfie Mystery of Capital provides numerous examples of how governments around the world discourage private ownership and enterprise. \"An Egyptian who wants to acquire and legally register a lot on state-owned desert land (which means, most land) must wend his way through at least 77 bureaucratic procedures at 31 public and private agencies,\" which can take from 5 to 14 years. \"To build a legal dwelling on former agricultural land would require 6 to 11 years of bureaucratic wrangling.\" \"In Haiti,\" writes De Soto, \"one way an ordinary person can settle legally on government land is first to lease it from the government for five years and then buy it. Working with associates in Haiti, our researchers found that to obtain such a lease took 65 bureaucratic steps requiring, on average, a little more than two years. All for the privilege of merely leasing the land for five years.\" Of course such government resttictions have given rise to tremendous amounts of underground activity, but people are seldom able to do as well as they could if the activity was legal. \"Extra legal businesses,\" De Soto explains, \"are taxed by the lack of good property law and continually have to hide their operations ftom the authorities. Because they are not incorporated, extralegal entrepreneurs cannot lure investors by selling shares; they cannot get low-interest fotmal credit because they do not have legal addresses. They cannot reduce risks by declaring limited liability or obtaining insurance coverage...moreover, because extralegal entrepreneurs live in constant fear of government detection and extortion from corrupt officials, they are forced to split and compartmentalize theit production facilities between many locations, thereby rarely achieving economies of scale.\"\n\nMoreover, because illegal businesses are always on the lookout for police, they can forget about openly advertising to build their customer base or making less costly bulk deliveries. Underground businesses are also easy prey for local Mafias who know they don't have to feat official police protection of the illegal operation. Failute to comply with the myriad laws, regulations, rules, codes and policies levies an additional cost. Fail to pay your taxes, allow a permit or license to expire, find your property in the way of a new public project, have any illegal drug found on your premises, violate a building code, deposit an unusual amount of cash into your bank account, have inadequate toilet facilities fot handicapped employees, or paint your building a shocking color, and you may be fined, arrested, and have your property taken away by city, county, state, or federal authorities. Attempt to resist and they'll take your \"primordial property\" (you). They will throw you in prison or even kill you. Ultimately, protection of your property rests on protecting yourself from all threats, the biggest of which is government itself. T h e United States is consideted by many the freest nation on earth and one in which private property is held in the highest regard. In fact, thete are many nations in the Western wotld, the Pacific Basin, and elsewhere that recognize and respect ptivate property to a much higher degree than the United States. Prudent individuals diversify their financial portfolios to protect against market fluctuations, inflation, deflation, recession, depression, currency devaluation and even war. In the same way, they divetsify internationally to protect against the abuses of government. T h e function of T h e Sovereign Society is to help identify those political jurisdictions that offer the most effective and cost-efficient methods of property protection. Using offshore bank accounts, trusts, and teal estate, as well as spreading business holdings among different countries, are practical ways to accomplish your primal need to defend and protect your property. 24\n\nThe Meaning of Natural Liberty\n\nA Declaration of Independence for Sovereign Individuals By John Pugsley, The Sovereign Individual, July 2002 For Americans, July 4, 2002, will be a particularly emotion-filled Independence Day. T h e first one since last September's terrorist attack, it strums an intensely patriotic chord in most citizens. That makes this an especially appropriate time to reflect on the principles of independence. Revolts against despotic governments are a familiar motif of history. Almost all modern nations from Mexico to the Philippines and from Zaire to the Ukraine have their own national \"independence\" days, marking their emergence from under one group of tyrants and usually into the grip of another. Throughout history, independence and subjugation ha"
