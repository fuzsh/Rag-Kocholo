Yet its path to independence was anything but smooth. Occupied by the British in the seventeenth century in defiance of Spanish territorial claims, it was not until 1862 that it became the colony of British Honduras following the 1859 AngloGuatemalan Treaty that temporarily put an end to its ambiguous status. It gained independence in 1981, backed by a British defense guarantee that ended only in 1993. Today the biggest threat to Belize’s status as a sovereign and independent country is the still unresolved Guatemalan territorial claim. However, it was not always so. The independence movement, born on New Year’s Eve 1949/1950 when the colonial authorities devalued the British Honduran dollar in the dead of night, saw as its principal obstacle the British determination to hang on to the remains of its Empire following the end of the British Raj on the Indian subcontinent. Yet within a decade, British attitudes would change. The winds of change that swept Africa in the late 1950s, following a series of disastrous colonial wars, had drifted across the Atlantic by the early 1960s. Independence for British colonies in the Caribbean was no longer resisted and decolonization followed swiftly. Belize, still called British Honduras until 1973, had to settle for a more limited arrangement that gave it home rule in 1964. The reason was partly the slow pace of democratization under colonialism, but more importantly the Guatemalan territorial claim which had been revived in the 1940s and which had led Britain to dispatch troops to its mainland colony in order to repel a possible invasion. The UK accepted the right of the Belizean people to self-determination, but the presence of British troops appeared to rule out a move to full independence.\n\nxii\n\nFOREWORD\n\nThis was the stalemate that lasted for nearly 20 years until independence finally was achieved on September 21, 1981. Yet the basic dilemma had still not been resolved. Guatemala claimed the territory and the UK defended it. How independence came about despite these inauspicious circumstances is the story of this remarkable book written by one of the dramatis personae. The Guatemalan claim rests on the interpretation of the 1859 treaty, the British and Belizeans asserting it was a boundary treaty and the Guatemalans that it was a treaty of cession that was invalidated by the failure of the British government to carry through one of the articles. Although for many people today the right of self-determination trumps these seemingly arcane issues of international law, it is impossible to understand the complexity of the Belize situation without a proper understanding of the legal framework. Assad Shoman, who has worked for years on the dispute for the Belize government, treats us to a full and dispassionate account of the different interpretations. If the dispute ends up in the International Court of Justice, as now seems possible, this part of the book will prove to be indispensable for all those involved in the judicial proceedings. The main part of the book, however, deals with the dilemma referred to above—a dilemma that other countries such as Western Sahara have signally failed to resolve. That Belize appears to be a unique case of a country that in recent decades has peacefully achieved independence despite a major territorial claim requires an elucidation and we find the answer in this book. The explanation is partly a matter of asymmetry, partly of hemispheric geopolitics but above all of individual leadership. However much as social scientists we recognize the “forces of change” and “drivers of circumstance,” we learn from this perspicacious book that individuals do matter. The key individual in the Belize story was George Price, who was the dominant figure in the nationalist movement up to and beyond independence. Loathed by the colonial authorities and accused of being a secret agent for Guatemala, he eventually not only secured British support but also steered a path to independence that involved the Commonwealth, CARICOM, Latin America, the nonaligned countries and the UN. In this he was helped by a dedicated group of young nationalists including Assad Shoman, the author of this book. Even today there is no satisfactory biography of George Price, but this book goes a long way to understand this complicated man. The support of the UN turned out to be crucial. Guatemala could dismiss the Commonwealth and even CARICOM as institutions that were prejudiced in Belize’s favor through their connection\n\nFOREWORD\n\nxiii\n\nwith Britain. It could not do so in the case of the UN General Assembly. Furthermore, Argentine complaints about the (ab)use of self-determination for the Falkland Islanders may have had some resonance in the UN Committee on Decolonization, but it made little sense in the case of Belize whose population (only 300,000 even today) had all the characteristics of a nation despite its size. Belize, a nation that sits comfortably in both Central America and the Caribbean, has always been conscious of the geopolitical realities of the region. As early as the 1850s the United States had challenged the UK on its interpretation of the 1850 Clayton-Bulwer Treaty that Britain had assumed allowed it to keep a foothold in Central America at Belize (but not the Bay Islands or the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua). Reluctantly, the United States eventually accepted this interpretation but Guatemala’s staunch anticommunism under a succession of military governments from 1954 onward created a potentially risky situation for Belize’s nationalist movement. Here George Price and other leaders were relatively powerless, hoping that Britain would at least be able to ensure that the United States remained neutral in the dispute. Yet it was the Belizean people, demonstrating their fury on more than one occasion at U.S.-inspired proposals designed to compromise their sovereignty, who may have saved the day. No one is better placed than Assad Shoman to write this book. He has known almost all the actors involved inside and outside Belize for the past 40 years. He has played a leading part in both the nationalist movement and in party politics. He is respected on all sides of the political divide and has negotiated at the highest level with the Guatemalan authorities. These attributes alone would make him more than qualified. However, he brings something else as well: a knowledge of the primary and secondary sources and a scholarly devotion to accuracy that makes this book a pleasure to read. And his wide vision makes this a book not just about Belize, but also about a world in which small nations struggle to have their voices heard. Victor Bulmer-Thomas Institute for the Study of the Americas\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nPreface\n\nT\n\nhis book is based on a thesis done for my Ph.D. degree at the University of London in 2008, where I was privileged to have as my supervisor the Director of the Institute for the Study of the Americas, James Dunkerley. His predecessor, Victor Bulmer-Thomas, first urged me to undertake that course, knowing that my real purpose was to publish a book that would tell the dramatic story of Belize and its unlikely success, against all odds, in achieving its secure independence with all its territory. London was an ideal place for writing this story—apart from the fact that almost all of the original material, involving the facts as seen by British officials, was available only at the National Archives at Kew Gardens, the city hosts many institutions related to Britain’s colonial past and its history of decolonization, such as the Commonwealth Institute, the Royal Institute for International Affairs, the Commonwealth Secretariat, and, of course, the Houses of Parliament. Besides, some of the key players were still alive and around, and I was able to interview them. Although I had a hunch before I started writing that the Belize story represented a unique case in the annals of decolonization, it was not until I had delved into numerous works on the subject that I became convinced that this story was significant for many reasons. Most accounts of the decolonization process emphasize the influence of indigenous independence movements that colonial powers eventually accommodate, sometimes only after armed struggle. The Belizean case is different because years after the colonial power was ready to grant independence, a territorial claim from a neighboring state considered by the United States as a crucial ally became the only obstacle. The Cold War was a fundamental backdrop to the ensuing struggle, from the beginning of the independence movement in 1950 until its culmination in 1981.\n\nxvi\n\nP R E FA C E\n\nWhen I went to the UN in 1975 to seek support for Belize’s early and secure independence, two other similar cases had landed on the UN plate at about the same time—East Timor and Western Sahara. In both cases, the colonial power—Portugal and Spain respectively— was leaving a colonial territory and a neighboring country—Indonesia and Morocco respectively—was intent on claiming the entire territory as its own. Of the three cases, Belize was the only one to gain its objective within a reasonable time and without bloodshed. This may have been due not only to the fact of the difference in the attitudes and actions of the colonial powers involved, but more likely because of how each of the territories was viewed at the time by the U.S. government in terms of Cold War politics. East Timor, after suffering several massacres that cost it thousands of lives, eventually achieved independence in 1999. And the people of Western Sahara are still struggling to exercise their right to self-determination. I thought it was worthwhile to tell the story of how and why Belize succeeded where others failed: how it was possible for a tiny country to defy both the UK and the United States, who tried for years to convince Belize’s leaders to cede land to Guatemala and allow that country to have a decisive say in its economic development, its foreign relations, and, incredibly, its defense. In the course of my research, it became clear that the Belizean leaders had given a new meaning to “negotiation,” and that they had evolved a strategy that they called “internationalization,” their effective use of which made Belize the only country to win its independence by this means, with all its territory and with its security guaranteed by a major power as well as by the UN. Clearly, in order to succeed they had to take advantage of the shifting conjuncture, including the fact that the “Third World” and the UN were at the apex of their influence in the 1970s. I have included enough background on the origins and evolution of Belize and of the Guatemalan claim, including details never before revealed of the U.S. mediation and subsequent negotiations, to make the story meaningful, and I believe the book will be useful for students of dispute resolution as well as for those interested in decolonization, international relations, and the role of international organizations. Guatemala’s claim did not end with Belize’s independence, although it never again threatened force to pursue it. In 1991 the Guatemalan government recognized the independent state of Belize, but maintained its territorial claim, although in 2008 the two countries signed an agreement that could result in the dispute being submitted for\n\nP R E FA C E\n\nxvii\n\nfinal resolution to the International Court of Justice, provided that referendums in both countries approve such action. From 1981 until the present time, the two countries have engaged in frequent and often imaginative, perhaps unique, attempts to settle their differences. That story is the subject of my forthcoming book, The Resolution of Territorial Disputes: Belize/Guatemala, a case study. I need to declare that for the critical period that forms the substance of this book, I was part of the Belizean team dealing with the dispute—from 1971 to 1974 as head of the Belizean Independence Secretariat, and from 1974 to 1978 and in 1980–1981 as one of Belize’s negotiators and head of the missions to the UN. I have made every effort to ensure that, while enriching the content of the work, this fact does not militate against its objectivity and fairness.

Manuscript references up to 1981 were made possible by the fact that the author was a participant in the events of the modern period, and that he had access to the relevant documents of the period. In addition, he was provided with documents by George Price, as a result of which he has in his possession papers covering the period 1948–1981, including some papers in the modern period before 1976 that are not available for viewing at the National Archives in London. References to these privately held papers are indicated in the notes as PF. Major printed collections of documents are as follows: • Sir John Burdon’s (ed.) Archives of British Honduras (3 vols., London, Sifton Praed, 1931–1935) is a collection of documents in the archives at Belize in 1930 that were extracted, some incomplete, by public officers in Belize and later printed in London. Its value is enhanced by the destruction of archival documents in subsequent hurricanes in Belize. Cited as ABH. • The White Book. Controversy between Guatemala and Great Britain relative to the Convention of 1859 on Territorial Matters. Belize Question, published by the Guatemalan Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1938, is a useful volume containing a large number of documents.

Belize’s independence movement started in 1950, when the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (hereafter referred to as UK or Britain) still wanted to hold on to parts of its empire. By the early 1960s, however, Britain was committed to Belize’s independence and the only obstacle then was the Guatemalan claim. Belize’s struggle for independence, although influenced by the worldwide phenomenon of decolonization, was unique in that Belize was the only British colony whose entire territory was actively claimed by another country and whose people wanted independence.1 This meant that its nationalist leaders, after a decade of fighting the colonial power, had to cooperate with it to seek a negotiated solution to the claim, while bearing in mind the proprietary interest assumed by the United States in its “backyard.” Britain was anxious to rid itself of this irritating remnant of its empire, and it sought, with U.S. help, to arrange a spurious independence for Belize while actually making it subservient to Guatemala. Public opinion in Belize, however, was opposed to the exchange of one colonial master for another and to British pressure to cede land to Guatemala. The only option for Belize, faced with the military power of Guatemala and pressures from the UK and the United States, was to internationalize its struggle. Belizeans were able to take advantage of the international conjuncture, where key organizations like the United Nations (UN), the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), the Commonwealth, and the\n\n2\n\nB E L I Z E’ S I N D E P E N D EN C E\n\nNon-Aligned Movement (NAM) were at the apex of their influence in decolonization matters and in which important countries like Mexico and Panama had strong motivations of self-interest for supporting Belize’s cause. Decolonization “Decolonization” is the established term in scholarly literature and it is retained here; in this volume, the preferred definition is “the historical process by which the European powers who had established empires in the non-European world ceased to rule those regions.”2 The seeds of the post-1945 process of decolonization began to grow during the First World War and were nourished by the Great Depression and its effects on standards of living in the colonies. The British response was to make generally ineffective attempts to improve living conditions and to concede varying degrees of administrative autonomy, depending on the circumstances. Also, the British government did not decide to end colonialism immediately after the Second World War. Winston Churchill’s sentiment expressed in his famous statement that he did “not become the King’s First Minister in order to preside over the liquidation of the British Empire”3 was shared by Clement Attlee and even by Harold Wilson,4 because what made Britain a world power was its empire.5 The war and its consequences, however, dealt a severe blow to Britain’s imperial ambitions. With Britain’s expulsion from many Asian countries by Japan, “the myth of the invincible white man was exploded overnight.”6 Although it had reclaimed these territories after the war, Britain was in dire financial straits,7 and was further humiliated by having to accept from the United States a loan of $3.75 billion with strings attached: the abolition of trade preferences and the free exchange of sterling for the dollar.8 This struck a serious blow to the “imperial trade preferences and currency controls which had knitted the empire together as an economic unit.” 9 Britain’s status as a great power was predicated on its being an imperial power, the essence of which was precisely the existence of the sterling area and preferential trade with its empire. The growth of the global economy after 1945 made the trade policies of colonialism obsolete and was also one of the root causes of decolonization.10 Furthermore, the revival of the Western economies in the 1950s led Britain to shift its emphasis from its empire to Europe and North America, where trade in manufactured goods was growing rapidly. Trade and investment between industrialized countries had become much more important.11\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nMoreover, the United States was pressing Britain to take up its role as a leader in Europe and to shed its colonial empire.12 Washington regarded the UK’s imperial tariffs as inimical to the free trade requirements of the fast-growing U.S. economy and its need to control strategic raw materials.13 It also considered the British Empire a hindrance to uniting the “free world” against Soviet influence.14 But the United States was quite willing to prop up Britain’s colonial system when it felt that this was necessary to keep communism from taking hold in a country.15 Such was the case in Malaya16 and, closer to Belize in many ways, in Guyana, which will be considered below. Nationalism and the British Response Lord Rosebery remarked in 1884 that “great empires, when they crumble, are apt to crumble exceedingly small.”17 After 1945, “virtually everywhere, colonial rule crumbled far quicker and decolonised states took forms unforeseen by British planners.”18 Dozens of small states became independent from Britain, and in almost all cases the phenomenon of nationalism was critical in determining the nature and timing of independence. Belize was an exception to this because its independence was delayed by the Guatemalan claim, but it did have a strong and militant nationalist movement for a decade before Britain conceded the promise of independence. The first global call by nationalists for self-government was made by Kwame Nkrumah in his “Declaration to the Colonial Peoples of the World,” approved by the Pan-African Congress in 1945, affirming that all people must gain the right to control their own destiny “by all means at their disposal.”19 In the British colonies, the means used by the nationalists were generally peaceful,20 but wars were fought in Malaya, Kenya, and Cyprus. Britain was forced to concede independence to the Indian subcontinent in 1947, even though “in London’s eyes India’s significance bulked larger than any other part of the imperial system.”21 At the same time, however, it pushed deeper into Africa and the Middle East.22 In the desperate financial situation in which they found themselves in 1947, British ministers believed that “the colonial empire could make a major contribution towards solution of our present difficulties.”23 Indeed, they harbored “the idea of expanding Britain’s power to equal the United States and the Soviet Union . . . by combining the resources of Western Europe, the Dominions, and the AfroAsian colonies under British leadership.”24 This led to what has been called “the new imperialism”25 or “the second colonial occupation.”26\n\n4\n\nB E L I Z E’ S I N D E P E N D EN C E\n\nAfter 1945 the sterling area, of which the colonial empire was the backbone, was more tightly controlled. It discriminated against trade with the “hard currency” areas, especially the United States, and became a device for minimizing dollar expenditure.27 In 1948, the Colonial Development Corporation (CDC) was created to promote increased colonial production “whose supply to the UK or sale overseas will assist our balance of payments.”28 This led to a significant expansion in local bureaucracies and “a fresh invasion of British and Commonwealth personnel to fill expanding technical departments overseas.” Crucially, too, solving Britain’s post-war dollar shortage by stimulating colonial exports to the United States was also a key element in the 1949 decision to devalue the pound by 30 per cent, and the sterling crisis of November 1951 later re-emphasised the integral role of colonial primary producers in British economic recovery. 29\n\nAs we shall see, the September 1949 devaluation of sterling was followed by the devaluation of the Belize dollar three months later, providing the immediate trigger that launched the independence movement in Belize. The British push for economic growth in Africa carried within it the seeds of the demolition of the colonial system, since this growth “would have to be paid for by political concession,” and [t]he British were to be surprised by the extraordinary scale of popular support which the nationalists were able to command . . . territories which had been political deserts now seemed to pullulate with political parties that were the darlings of the masses, the tribunes of the people and the voice of the future.30\n\nAnother aspect of Britain’s decolonization policy was what has been called its “federal panacea”: the idea that a federal structure could create more viable postindependence states, since self-government seemed unrealistic for small populations. Nicholas White opines that “the federations all illustrate an imperial desire to refashion empire and, in so doing, strengthen, rather than weaken, ‘the British connection’ with overseas dependencies.”31 This is certainly how it was seen by the Belizean leaders of the independence movement, who also feared the effect of a “West Indian invasion” on the job market. They effectively exploited parochial sentiments and used the British West Indies Federation as a major weapon in their attacks against colonialism.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n5\n\nUntil the late 1950s, British officials and politicians alike believed that “it was dangerous for smaller territories to nurse illusions of independent grandeur.”32 The early Labor governments sought to implement a new approach to the colonies: “they were to be properly developed and the natives were to learn to govern themselves. Independence would be granted once the colonies were ready for it, i.e. after 30 to 40 years at the earliest.”33 After the experiment to turn the colonies into profitable productive units had failed, however, most colonies were seen as financial burdens, and the foremost reason for hanging on to them was “a sense of responsibility as well as the feeling that to abandon them would damage Britain’s prestige.”34 It would be left to Harold Macmillan, in his second government (1959–1963), to speed up the pace of decolonization and scuttle the concept of “viability” and “readiness.” But before that, Britain had to pass through the trauma of losing its hold on the Suez Canal in 1956, which “was regarded as central to any postwar revitalisation of imperial power and the preservation of great power status” and important for securing oil supplies.35 More broadly, it has been argued that the [Suez] crisis concerned the UK’s ability to operate as a world power whose claims to that status were uniquely geared to its role in the underdeveloped world, and that this crisis was resolved only when the British government recognized that this status, given existing constraints, was too grandly conceived and had to be scaled down.36\n\nThe United States was instrumental in having Sir Anthony Eden replaced by Macmillan as prime minister, emphasizing the fact that Britain could no longer play the great power game as it had been accustomed to, and that “subsequent decolonisations in Africa and the Mediterranean were simply one aspect of an adaptation of British statecraft which flowed from this recognition.”37 An important factor affecting Britain’s decolonization policy was its poor economic performance, including the decline in its share of world exports. Britain’s trade with Commonwealth countries also declined dramatically between 1950 and 1970 in comparison with its trade with the United States and Europe, and while in 1960 about 60 percent of British foreign investment was in sterling area countries, by 1970 this proportion had fallen to 38 percent.38 It was not surprising, then, that in 1957 Macmillan famously called for “something like a profit and loss account for each of our colonial possessions,” and suggested that in some places, “there is no United Kingdom interest in resisting constitutional change even if it\n\n6\n\nB E L I Z E’ S I N D E P E N D EN C E\n\nseems likely to lead to cession from the Commonwealth.”39 Officials concluded, however, that the colonies had contributed to the importance of the sterling area and were important for UK trade, and that premature withdrawal would be discreditable and dangerous.40 They also warned against withdrawal where, as in Cyprus, Belize, and the Falkland Islands, this might lead to a vacuum into which other powers would move, damaging British prestige and risking the loss of the territories to communism.41 A few months later the governor of Barbados wrote that he had been appalled on visiting London to hear a Conservative Party official say that “Britain should withdraw from useless places like British Honduras in order to save money.”42 By 1960, however, Britain’s determination to shed its colonies, except in very special cases like Aden, became inexorable. That is when Britain signaled to Belize its readiness, indeed its desire, to discard its imperial mantle there, changing the decolonization movement in that colony from the standard anticolonial struggle against the metropole to one focused on removing the remaining obstacle to independence, the Guatemalan claim, and requiring Belizean leaders to concentrate on the international environment, which was then heavily affected by Cold War politics. The Cold War and the Special Relationship A bipolar world emerged after the Second World War: the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) became the superpowers, and British pretensions to be a competing “third force” through the empire-commonwealth were soon shown to be an illusion. It became clear during the war, and clearer still after the Suez crisis in 1956, that Britain’s only chance of remaining a relevant power in the world lay in nurturing the “special relationship” that had been created during the war by Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt.43 Before Suez, independent British action without U.S. approval still seemed possible, but afterward “the forward movement of American influence steadily demolished any such assumption.”44 Macmillan was at pains, after Suez, to mend fences with the United States, which had vigorously opposed Britain’s war against Egypt, and in March 1957 British and U.S. officials agreed that the best counter to Soviet aims is to pursue resolutely and systematically the constructive policy of leading dependencies as rapidly as possible toward stable self-government or independence in such a way that these governments are willing and able to preserve their political and economic ties with the West.45\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n7\n\nThe most important aspect of the special relationship for the United States, however, was the Cold War, which was “of central importance in the redefining and repositioning of the empire.”46 The British minister of defense declared that “our Colonial Empire in its varying stages of development is likely to be a vital ‘cold war’ battlefield,” where the communists might strike directly or “exploit troubles basically of a nationalist character.”47 That is why it sometimes suited the United States to tolerate and even encourage continued British colonialism, even though it shared the developing anticolonial mood of the postwar world.48 The Case of Guyana Because of its similarities with Belize, it is instructive to consider the decolonization of Guyana,49 the only other British colony on the American mainland in the twentieth century, and over which Venezuela maintained a claim to two-thirds of its territory, although it supported Guyana’s bid for independence.50 The People’s Progressive Party (PPP), led by Cheddi Jagan, like Belize’s People’s United Party (PUP), was launched in 1950 with ethnically diverse leadership and won the first general election under universal adult suffrage in April 1953. British intelligence reports acknowledged that the PPP had a wide following among the working class and that the election demonstrated the success of African and Indian unity, support from the indigenous professional classes, and “the profound desire by many people for a change from the old order.”51 The report opined that “the PPP is by no means a Communist organisation as such, but is exploited by a tight clique of Communists or ‘fellow travellers.’ ” It identified Jagan as belonging to the communist section while Forbes Burnham headed the noncommunist section.52 When the government introduced a Labor Relations Bill that the business sector decried as a communist measure, the Colonial Office determined that a very grave situation is developing. It is evident that there is an important section of the [PPP] . . . which is trying to turn the territory into a Republic completely independent of the United Kingdom with a Communist political bias and a leaning towards Russia rather than the West in international affairs.53\n\nThe government had done nothing illegal or anticonstitutional, and the British admitted that “it might be argued that since the\n\n8\n\nB E L I Z E’ S I N D E P E N D EN C E\n\npeople of British Guiana chose this government it is undemocratic to intervene,” but concluded that intervention could be justified as a means of “protecting them from their own folly,” and because a communist regime (no evidence for the existence of which was proffered) “would seriously embarrass the UK in its diplomatic relations with U.S.”54 The action taken thereafter is summarized by Nigel Bolland: On October 9, 1953, the British government suspended the new constitution, threw out the PPP ministers and fomented a split within the PPP. By 1955 the PPP was divided and race quickly emerged as the central political issue between Cheddi Jagan’s PPP and Forbes Burnham’s People’s National Congress (PNC). Although the PPP won the elections in 1957 and 1961, Jagan was not allowed to lead his country into independence. His government was destabilised between 1962 and 1964, when a new constitution enabled Burnham to create a coalition government consisting of two minority parties.55\n\nIn order to enable Burnham to win, the British government went against all tradition and enforced a proportional representation system on Guyana. The United States insisted that Guyana must never become independent under Jagan, who they considered a communist threat. In 1962 U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk told British Secretary of State Lord Home that the continuation of Jagan in power “is leading us to disaster in terms of the colony itself, strains on Anglo-American relations and difficulties for the inter-American system.”56 Lord Home replied that Britain could not go back on the policy of bringing dependent territories to self-government, and slipped in a reference to Belize: As the present regime in Guatemala would hardly have come into being without your support in 1954 and since, I shall be asking you to use your good offices at the right time to prevent another possible misadventure on your doorstep.57\n\nBut the British were unable to withstand the onslaught of U.S. diplomacy, which pursued at the highest levels its goal of denying Jagan the opportunity to lead Guyana into independence. President John Kennedy told Prime Minister Macmillan in June 1963 that if in 1964 a communist state were to be established in Guyana, the next president would have to take military action against Cuba and that there would be considerable resentment in the United States if the UK pulled out of Guyana.58 Rusk suggested that the British\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n9\n\nimpose direct rule, but Home noted that this would be condemned in the UN, whose Committee of 24 (see below) had just voted for Britain to leave at once and in this context, the question would be why the same could not be done in Rhodesia.59 It was finally agreed, at Kennedy’s suggestion, that the best solution would be to call an election and arrange for a coalition government of Burnham’s and another minority party to win; this was in fact achieved by Britain imposing the proportional representation system in 1964. Two years later, Guyana became independent, and at the strong urging of the United States,60 the UK decided to leave British troops in the territory until the Guyanese security forces were strong enough to cope with any attempts at subversion by the PPP.61 The case of Guyana shows clearly that “in the competition in the American mind between the ‘Special Relationship,’ ‘anti-colonialism’ and ‘anti-communism,’ the last always prevails.”62 It also demonstrates how far Britain was willing to go to accommodate U.S. wishes affecting countries in its “backyard”; this did not augur well for Belize. William Rogers, who as Henry Kissinger’s assistant secretary of state for Latin America until 1977 dealt with British officials on the Belize question, was brutally blunt on the question: Latin America probably yields less evidence of a unique relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom than any other part of the world . . . No other major grouping of developing countries is so dominated by an economic and military superpower as Latin America is by the United States.63\n\nRogers displays his own disdain and arrogance when he refers to the case of Belize: Britain’s last remaining defense commitment on the mainland of the hemisphere is Belize, and this is strictly marginal in Washington’s scheme of things. America’s concern is for the nurturing of the tender shoots of democracy in Guatemala, the restraint of its military, and the enhancement of development in that last firebreak between a Central American conflagration and Mexico. So the festering problem of Belize has been an irritant and a side-show as far as American strategy in Central America is concerned for years.64\n\nThe status of Belize as a “side-show” in the U.S. scheme of things became painfully apparent during the two decades that the Belize government sought to gain independence for Belize.\n\n10\n\nB E L I Z E’ S I N D E P E N D EN C E\n\nDefense Matters Security issues were always at the heart of the relations of cooperation between the United States and the UK; they were also crucially important for the issue of Belize’s independence: there came a point when the only thing that stood between Belize and independence was the fear of a Guatemalan military takeover, and the only feasible shield against that was British forces. It is, therefore, important to look briefly at the UK’s defense policy at the crucial times. Upon taking office in 1964 (by which time Belize had become self-governing and expected to gain independence within four years), Prime Minister Harold Wilson (Labor) believed that Britain had to maintain three defense roles: the strategic nuclear, the defense of Europe under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and a global role: our maritime tradition, our reputation . . . above all our Commonwealth history and connections, mean that Britain can provide for the Alliances and for the world peacekeeping role a contribution which no other country, not excluding America, can provide.65\n\nThis grandiose vision of Britain’s “unique” world power role could not be sustained. In 1968 Wilson declared that “apart from our remaining Dependencies and certain other necessary exceptions, we shall by [1971] not be maintaining military bases outside Europe and the Mediterranean.”66 Wilson’s second government (1966–1970) enunciated to Belize its policy of no defense guarantee after independence. Heath’s Conservative government (1970–1974) maintained this policy. In March 1974 Wilson’s government (reelected in February) announced that it had initiated a review of current defense commitments whose aim was to save several hundred million pounds per annum while maintaining a modern and effective defense system.67 NATO would remain the first charge on defense expenditure, and other commitments would be reduced, although Britain would “continue to maintain forces in the dependent territories of Hong Kong, Gibraltar, Belize and the Falkland Islands.”68 Wilson announced that British forces would be withdrawn from Malaysia and Singapore by April 1976, but that a training team in Oman would be maintained. Foreign Secretary James Callaghan would later suggest that a similar arrangement might be the way forward for Belize. By 1975 Britain had embraced its European destiny, and sought to remove or reduce its few remaining worldwide defense commitments.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n11\n\nThis posture played an important role in delaying Belize’s independence, since the UK was policy-bound in denying the possibility of providing a defense guarantee with a military presence in Belize after independence. Although this was the position of both Labor and Conservative governments from 1965, the change of government from Labor to Conservative in 1979 proved significant, since the Margaret Thatcher government, in the international conjuncture of the early 1980s, was less reluctant to deploy its military forces in furtherance of its interests. The International Arena The Commonwealth The British saw the Commonwealth as a medium to maintain their status as a great power after their real power in the world had waned. The white “Dominions” that had become self-governing states would constitute a partnership of free societies exercising a powerful moral influence on world affairs.69 At the same time, [t]he British . . . were determined to conserve sufficient elements of legal unity such that the empire continued to be perceived as an operational (and, when necessary, fighting) entity by potential great power entities.70\n\nHowever, as long as what was essential in Britain’s empire relationships could be maintained, concessions could be made in relation to formal constitutions.71 With the advent of the independent nonwhite ex-colonies, the question of their full and equal membership of the Commonwealth worried the British; Burma was denied membership in 1947 when its leaders insisted on a republican constitution, because the object of British policy was to transfer power on terms that would preserve a special link with the British imperial system, minimise the international and strategic significance of self-rule and encourage commercial cooperation.72\n\nThe UK felt that Commonwealth membership should include continued loyalty to the British Empire by way of the monarchy, and denying this would damage British prestige and encourage anti-British sentiment elsewhere. Two years later, the British reversed that policy when it became clear that India would rather leave the Commonwealth\n\n12\n\nB E L I Z E’ S I N D E P E N D EN C E\n\nthan give up its republican constitution, and India was too important a country to lose.73 Another problem was faced with the admission of Ghana and other black-led states, which precipitated apartheid South Africa’s withdrawal from the Commonwealth. The British then saw the efficacy of opening membership in the Commonwealth to all their former colonies, but they still entertained doubts about the readiness of subject peoples to throw off the colonial mantle, which the British regarded as a protective blanket required for people unprepared for self-rule. Even Iain Macleod, Macmillan’s colonial secretary who put decolonization on fast track, admitted that he never believed the colonies were “ready” for self-government.74 Still, for British politicians and officials alike, a large part of the success of Britain’s decolonization project was the creation of the new Commonwealth, which was seen “as a means of supporting Britain’s role as a great power: independence within the Commonwealth would enable decolonised states to play a positive role in Commonwealth defence and the sterling area”;75 in this sense decolonization could be seen as “the continuation of empire by other means.” 76 But while the newly independent countries were happy enough to stay in an organization that provided a useful international forum, they regarded their Commonwealth links as only one aspect of their foreign relations, as Britain’s patronage became less and less important compared to other foci of world influence and they developed diverging interests and sympathies. The Commonwealth came to have a more practical advantage for the newly independent states when, following an initiative by Kwame Nkrumah, the Commonwealth Secretariat was established in 1965.77 This instrument was to play a crucial role in the Belize question. The Non-Aligned Movement The NAM was an “international social movement rooted in the national liberation movements waged by the three continents of Asia, Africa and Latin America against Western colonial and neo-colonial domination.” 78 Its ideological origin is traced to the Afro-Asian Conference in Bandung in April 1955, in which 29 countries led by India’s Jawaharlal Nehru, Indonesia’s Achmad Sukarno, and Egypt’s Gamal Abdel Nasser proclaimed their “non-alignment” from either of the superpowers.79 By 1960, world events moved a great many other countries to embrace and expand this concept. Cold War tensions had intensified and Africa had become a crucial battleground in\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n13\n\nthe East-West conflict, with the crisis in the Congo enveloping the UN, to which many of the new countries turned for solutions. In 1960, 16 new African states became UN members; they joined the other Third World countries in getting the General Assembly (GA) to pass (with both the United States and the UK abstaining) the seminal Resolution 1514 on Decolonization.80 After the April 1961 U.S.generated invasion of Cuba, several Afro-Asian states, along with Europe’s Yugoslavia (whose Josip Broz Tito had become an important leader in the budding movement) and Cuba from Latin America held a preparatory meeting in June for a conference of nonaligned countries to which they invited the Algerian liberation movement. This invitation to the provisional government of Algeria “established a precedent in international relations and became an integral part of non-alignment.”81 The assumption by the NAM of the right to recognize the legitimate representatives of a country before independence later allowed Belize to be welcomed in the fold of the NAM while it was still a colony, and facilitated its bid for independence by internationalization. The First Summit of the NAM was held in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, in September 1961, and it set very broad parameters for membership: a country should have an independent foreign policy based on peaceful coexistence of states with different political and social systems, support national independence movements, and not belong to a multilateral military alliance concluded in the context of Great Power conflicts.82 The movement privileged multilateralism and consistently sought to strengthen the role of the UN in world politics. The NAM came of age at the Fourth Summit in Algeria in 1973: 75 countries attended, representing two-thirds of UN membership. Its Political Declaration emphasized the problems of Latin America (the threats against Cuba and Salvador Allende’s Chile, the continuance of colonial situations) and declared that as long as colonial wars, apartheid, imperialist aggression, alien domination, foreign occupation, power politics, economic exploitation and plunder prevail, peace will be limited in principle and scope.83\n\nAlthough the NAM had no constitution or permanent secretariat, it did have many institutional organs, the most important of which was the Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries. Belize presented its case fully to the fifth such conference, held in Peru in 1975, effectively launching its internationalization campaign.\n\n14\n\nB E L I Z E’ S I N D E P E N D EN C E\n\nThe UN and Decolonization The framers of the UN Charter never used the word “decolonization,” and provided no firm guidelines for that process. Although Chapter 11 of the Charter calls on members with colonies to “develop self-government . . . and assist in the progressive development of their free political institutions,” there is no call to make those countries free. The only duty put on those states was to transmit to the secretary general, “for information purposes, subject to such limitations as security and constitutional considerations may require,” technical information relating to economic, social, and educational conditions in the territories.84 The exclusions suited the philosophy of Britain and the other “administering powers” that the timing and nature of any constitutional advance was a matter for them alone: Churchill had said at the Yalta Conference that he would “never consent to the fumbling fingers of forty or fifty nations prying into the life’s existence of the British Empire.”85 But by 1960 the membership of 49 in 1945 had doubled to 98, and the recently independent states led the move to pass the “Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples,” adopted by the GA on December 14, 1960 (Resolution 1514), radically changing the rules of the game and expanding the Charter. The Resolution demanded a “speedy and unconditional end to colonialism” and declared that “lack of preparedness should never serve as a pretext for delaying independence.” In 1961, the GA established a Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration (originally of 17 members and then of 24, it became known as the Decolonization Committee or the Committee of 24 or C24). In contrast to the former “information” committee, it had a majority of members who were not colonial powers, asserted the right to receive petitioners and send visiting missions, and examined the political situation in colonial countries with a view to assisting them in the early attainment of independence.86 Britain became a member of the C24, but as early as 1962 British officials, annoyed by its anti-British rhetoric, agonized over whether to leave the committee, although they recognized that UN pressure was “likely to bedevil our international position for so long as we continue to be regarded as a colonial power.”87 In 1971 Britain finally left the committee, just around the time that Belizean leaders started thinking of appealing to it. In 1974, however, the new Labor government’s Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador Ivor Richard, recommended that Britain should resume cooperation with\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n15\n\nthe committee, although not become a member, and indicated that visiting missions to British colonies would be favorably considered.88 Resolution 1514, however, was not free from controversy. One early question was that of defining the “self” that was the bearer of the right of self-determination; was it to be a race, a territorial area, or a community? By and large, the UN opted for the territorial over the ethnic criterion, or “the right of the majority within a generally accepted political unit.”89 It went further and established the norm of respect for the former colonial boundaries. Another problem was how self-government was to be achieved, as the Resolution enumerated three alternatives: independence, free association, and integration. Luckily for Belize, UN practice in the C24 and the Fourth Committee (the GA committee of all members, which dealt with decolonization issues) was “suffused with a strong bias in favor of one particular result, independence,” and it was contended that “any decision to merge with an already existing political unit must follow independence . . . and cannot be a substitute for it.” 90 A great deal of disagreement revolved around paragraph 6 of the Resolution, which condemns the disruption of the territorial integrity of a country, since it “provides the springboard for all arguments designed to pit or preserve territorial integrity claims against a rival claim to selfdetermination.”91 How Belize argued its case for the primacy of selfdetermination is described in Chapter 5. Internationalization The Belizean people’s march toward independence was blocked in the 1960s by the Guatemalan threat to use force to satisfy its territorial claim. Britain sought to settle the dispute by negotiation, but at the expense of the sovereignty or territory of Belize, whose people were not prepared to accept this. In theory, they had no standing in traditional international law; sovereignty of the territory lay in the UK, not in Belize. At the same time, Britain was constrained from reaching a settlement with Guatemala against the express wishes of the Belizean people, first for reasons of prestige and later because of commitments made as a result of Belize’s internationalization, and a stalemate ensued. Under the normal scheme of things, such an intractable dispute would be submitted to the traditional means of resolving disputes in accordance with Chapter 6 of the UN Charter, the Pacific Settlement of Disputes, under which Article 37 gives the Security Council ultimate authority to “decide whether to take action under Article 36 or\n\n16\n\nB E L I Z E’ S I N D E P E N D EN C E\n\nto recommend such terms of settlement as it may consider appropriate.” Article 36 recommends that legal disputes “should as a general rule be referred to the International Court of Justice (ICJ).”92 The Chapter 6 provisions were unacceptable to the government of Belize, first because under the principle of self-determination, peoples’ rights could not be overridden by an irredentist territorial claim, and second because it deemed the referral to the ICJ at that time, when Belize was still a colony, an unacceptable risk, as well as a factor that would delay independence for many years. Belize was, therefore, faced with Sophie’s choice: to make unpalatable concessions to Guatemala or to remain a colony.93 The Belize government could not convince Britain of its central thesis, that there were two distinct issues: the territorial claim, which was a matter between Britain and Guatemala; and the demand for independence, which was a matter between Belize and Britain to be resolved under the principles of the UN, and particularly those of Resolution 1514. The Belizeans argued that since the Anglo-Guatemalan dispute was Britain’s responsibility, it must resolve it without penalizing Belize in any way, and if it could not do so, it had an obligation to resolve the issue of Belize’s independence by providing it with a defense guarantee against any Guatemalan threat to its sovereignty or territorial integrity. When this was categorically and consistently denied by the UK, and when Belize’s participation in negotiations proved that its true independence could not be thereby achieved, it opted for internationalization. Internationalization is here used to mean the use of international norms, and the moral authority of international organizations, to achieve the independence and security of Belize. It refers to a strategy conceived and implemented by the government of Belize to achieve independence with all its territory and with adequate security against any Guatemalan invasion. This strategy involved lobbying other bodies and persons who could have a positive impact on the achievement of its goals (including governments, groups within states, and international organizations such as the Commonwealth, NAM, and the UN), the use of international norms to its advantage, coalitionbuilding, and the multifaceted use of negotiations as a tool of the strategy. The Belizean leaders gave “negotiations” a new meaning: a process by which one appears to seek to reach agreement with another party or parties and in which reconciling differing views, needs, or ideas may or may not be the ultimate goal. Normally, negotiation is seen as a dialogue between opposing parties intended to produce an\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n17\n\nagreement and so resolve a dispute. Here, negotiation is used as a tool that has to do with dispute resolution (in that, for example, it is an alternative to the use of force) but that is a process in which at least one party does not expect the negotiation itself to produce an agreement. All social relations—in the family, in the workplace, in relations between states—utilize negotiation as a form of dispute resolution. Central to the concept of negotiation, whether it is openly recognized or lurking in the background, is the idea of compromise, that in order to reach agreement each side must give up something. This becomes a problem when one party to a dispute believes that the dispute is bogus, or constructed, and has no basis whatsoever in fact or law; in such a context that party will not consider itself compelled to give up anything at all, and the negotiation is bound to fail. That scenario would accurately characterize the views of the Belizean people and government with regard to the Guatemalan claim. They believed that Guatemala had no justifiable claim to any part of Belize’s territory, and that to the extent that it was aggrieved about any failure to fulfill the 1859 Treaty, that should be resolved with Britain, not with Belize. For the Belizean people, that meant that Belize should not negotiate about the claim, period. For the Belize government, which was aware that it had to play by the rules of the international relations game, it meant that it had to “negotiate,” but that it could not consider making any concessions of substance. For the first decade during which the Belize government was allowed to participate in the Anglo-Guatemalan negotiations, Belize was at a severe disadvantage, since Britain and Guatemala were the only recognized parties to the negotiations. Those negotiations failed because Belize refused to budge on any major issue and Britain did not feel free to ram a solution down its throat. One solution tried was to allow third-party intervention in the negotiation through mediation: negotiations continued, but under another regime, and again Belize was at a disadvantage, since the choice of mediator was made against the wishes of Belizean leaders, and the channels of mediation were controlled by Britain and Guatemala. It can be said that this process got out of Belize’s hands, with serious internal political consequences for the Belize government. Consequently, after that debacle the Belize government simply dug in its heels in the following series of negotiations, which naturally broke down, but, fortunately for Belize in terms of its international reputation, they did so in circumstances in which the breakdown was ascribed to the Guatemalan government. Once Belize implemented its strategy of internationalization, however, “negotiation” took on a totally different meaning, since the very\n\n18\n\nB E L I Z E’ S I N D E P E N D EN C E\n\nfirst UN resolution in 1975 severely circumscribed the scope of negotiations: Belize was to become fully independent with all its territory and with security, and Guatemala and Britain were to continue negotiations that would produce that result. To that extent the U.S. government was right in pointing out that the resolution did not leave Guatemala with anything to negotiate. Furthermore, Britain was constrained to conduct the negotiations “in close consultation with the government of Belize,” which effectively made Belize, hitherto a nonparty, a party to negotiations whose results were predetermined not by the parties but by the GA of the UN. The negotiations thenceforth undertaken with Guatemala, therefore, had a surreal aura, with Britain trying to give them meaning by proposing real concessions and Belize stubbornly adhering to the UN resolutions that effectively outlawed such concessions. The Belize government used “negotiation,” then, as a part of its internationalization strategy, in the very stripped-down form of sitting at a table and talking with the opposite party, but with absolutely no intention, and no hope, of reaching agreement. The real negotiations carried out by Belize at that time were those with the UK, where it used its newly acquired status endowed on it by the UN and other international organizations like the Commonwealth and NAM to counter Britain’s legal/constitutional advantage as the administering power, and with other governments, with representatives of international organizations and civil society groups, within the framework of the ever-more-widely accepted norm of self-determination. The latter negotiations turned out to be for the most part very successful. In order to make its internationalization strategy effective, Belize moved the question of a legal dispute over territory decisively away from the legal/bilateral sphere to the politico-ideological/multilateral sphere. It gained independence by using the moral authority of the UN both to prevent the claimant state from enforcing its will and to force the administering power to assume the responsibility of defending the newly independent state. The key organ of the UN for implementing Belize’s strategy was the GA, the deliberative body composed of all members, with each having one vote. It can discuss any issue and make recommendations, except on matters of peace and security when those matters are before the Security Council, and if any action is required it must submit the matter to that body, which is made up of 5 permanent members94 and 10 other members elected by the GA on the basis of geographical distribution.95 But because the permanent members each has a veto, and because during the Cold War years the Security Council was often\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n19\n\nfrustrated by its use, the GA deliberations took on a strong moral authority that few nations found it convenient to ignore. Normally, the GA meets in the last four months of each year, and begins with the “general debate,” often addressed by heads of state or government and foreign ministers on the issues that interest them. Matters that will be brought to the Assembly for decision are first discussed in the relevant committees, which then submit their drafts to the Assembly for decision by resolution; in the case of decolonization issues, this is the Fourth Committee. On dealing with a matter, the committee usually holds a general discussion, then a draft resolution is prepared, usually with a number of “cosponsors”; a resolution with a large number of cosponsors indicates broad support. The drafts are discussed by the whole committee, which then votes on them; the approved drafts are forwarded to the GA.96 Given the fact that its resolutions are nonbinding, skeptics have questioned the value of the GA as an instance of meaningful international action, but as Samuel Barkin notes, the GA speaks with some real moral authority simply because it is the core democratic organ of the UN, and, to some extent, the voice of the community of nations. The Assembly helps to legitimate broad principles such as the sovereign equality of nations and the cooperative settlement of disputes, and can also be used to legitimate positions on specific issues.97\n\nHe also affirms that the UN as a system “plays a fundamental role not in undermining but in redefining the sovereign state system . . . it has changed the content of the set of rules, the international regime that we understand by the term sovereignty.” 98 Multilateralism, for example, has become the norm of state behavior in a way that was not so 50 years ago. This, surely, is an expression of some form of power: If one defines power in terms of changes in outcomes, without requiring that it be the result of some conscious or active attempt to change outcomes, then the UN system does have some real power.99\n\nIndeed, as I have suggested above, the GA was able to effectively alter the meaning of the UN Charter (which was the product of the power of a handful of countries in 1945) through its passing of Resolution 1514 in 1960. A priori, a simple state-centered perspective would predict that if the interests of a very small colony clashed with those of much larger\n\n20\n\nB E L I Z E’ S I N D E P E N D EN C E\n\npowers, the interests of the latter would prevail. This is even more evident when we recall Kenneth Waltz’s claim that the capabilities of states can be measured in terms of “how they score on all of the following items: size of population and territory, resource endowment, economic capability, military strength, political stability and competence.”100 It would be difficult to find a country that, according to these criteria, could be ranked lower than Belize. Moreover, initially Belize was confronted not only with a vastly more powerful regional state (Guatemala) but also with two world powers determined to force it to make unwanted concessions in order to achieve its independence. In the event, however, Belizean interests prevailed, suggesting that Belizean leaders had greater diplomatic and political resources than should be expected from the “capabilities” of their country. These resources lay in international institutions (in particular the UN), and in the ability of Belizean leaders to negotiate and to gain evergreater international support. In essence this very small country was able to build coalitions of support among like-minded states, many of whom were members of the emerging and increasingly influential nonaligned movement. As Robert Keohane and others have demonstrated, institutions can mediate the interests of protagonist states and give to small states the ability to build coalitions that can act as bulwarks against great power interests.101 This approach has particular force when the incentives of the small state are very great and the incentives of the larger state are comparatively minor. In this case, Belize’s very survival was at stake, whereas Britain’s motivation was simply to disengage from its colony in as decorous a manner as possible and without affecting its relations with the United States. Keohane refers to this phenomenon as an “asymmetry of motivation,” which explains discrepancies between power resources and outcomes: An actor with intense preferences on an issue may be willing to use more resources to attain a high probability of a favorable result, than an actor with more resources but lower intensity.102\n\nIn other words, outcomes do not always reflect real power resource availability; in this case Belize was heavily underresourced in comparison to all three of the significant others (Guatemala, the UK, and the United States), but its motivation for securing its goals was higher. Likewise, third-party states also had an incentive to support the Belizean cause: Mexico because of its own geopolitical\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n21\n\nconcerns, Panama because of its dispute with the United States over the Canal, and CARICOM and NAM states because of their determination to defend hard-won gains for less powerful countries, distance themselves from ex-colonial powers and demonstrate their independence in the international arena. Belizean leaders realized that, given Belize’s ministate condition, they could only succeed in their goal by enlisting the support of other countries. They, therefore, decided to steadily build coalitions, expanding out in concentric circles to encompass first the Caribbean Community countries (who themselves were punching beyond their weight in the international arena), then the Commonwealth, and then the Non-Aligned countries. Having gained such overwhelming support, the Belizeans chipped away at Guatemala’s hold on Latin American countries. They succeeded because they were able to interject regional and international organizations as intermediaries between the main protagonists. They also took advantage of the evolving norms of international behavior. The norms of self-determination, which by the 1970s had acquired a highly developed meaning in relation to colonial territories (with a strong bias toward independence), and of territorial integrity (which in the hands of NAM countries acquired a meaning more favorable to Belize than to Guatemala) played a crucial role. The norm of nonintervention, which was jealously guarded by NAM countries, also played in favor of Belize’s security, no doubt helping (along with UK reinforcements) to still the hand of those Guatemalan generals who throughout the 1970s were minded to provide a military solution to their desire to “reincorporate” Belize. The same can be said about the norm of multilateralism and in particular the role of the UN. Belize purposely sought to use resolutions of the UN (where it was guaranteed an automatic and overwhelming majority as a result of the use of its alliance-building capabilities) in order to limit Guatemala’s scope of action, although it must be said that the nature of Guatemalan governments at that time led them to seek to defy UN resolutions. More importantly, Belize used the moral authority of the UN, and more particularly of the Commonwealth, which had a special significance for Britain, to “name and shame” the UK into honoring its obligations toward Belize. Britain’s concept of prestige, its desire to be considered a good international citizen, was highly instrumental in leading it to be mindful of the views of the Belizean government, which were so fully supported by the overwhelming majority of the international community. And when that majority became a consensus (with the adherence of Latin American\n\n22\n\nB E L I Z E’ S I N D E P E N D EN C E\n\nstates and especially of the United States), this acquired a level of pressure that it was almost impossible for the UK to resist. This book will demonstrate that Belize used its “internationalization strategy” to gain independence against all odds, and will detail how this was done. In effect, a nonstate actor faced off against three powerful state actors and had greater success in shaping the outcome than any of them. It may well be that Belize was the first, and remains the only, country to use this strategy successfully to gain its independence recognized by the entire world community.\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Guatemalan Claim and Decolonization\n\nT\n\nhe territory that became known as Belize was an undifferentiated part of the Caribbean coast of Central America that was considered subject to Spanish sovereignty, by virtue of the Papal Bull of 1493. In 1821, Central America declared formal independence from Spain, and in 1823 an assembly in Guatemala City proclaimed the United Provinces of Central America, made up of the territories that had formed part of the Kingdom or Captaincy General of Guatemala (except Chiapas, which became part of Mexico). In 1838/1839 this federation broke up into the countries of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica.1 Guatemala asserts that it then inherited sovereignty over Belize, which it alleges had been considered part of the Petén and/or Verapaz regions of Guatemala. In the seventeenth century British subjects established a settlement on the Belize coast to cut logwood. For over a hundred years the Spaniards tried to dislodge the British, but in the latter part of the eighteenth century Spain, while it retained sovereignty, accorded the British treaty rights to cut logwood and mahogany in the area between the Hondo and Sibun rivers. But there were subsequent attempts by Spain to remove the British settlers, who exceeded the limits of the treaty in terms both of their activities and of the land they occupied. The last Spanish attempt to dislodge the settlers occurred in 1798, and thereafter Spain made only faint-hearted attempts to assert its sovereignty. The British continued to gain control of several parts of the isthmus and to influence the new states in Central America. The emerging hemispheric power, the United States, also staked an interest there. After decades of conflict and diplomatic activity, Britain signed treaties that settled territorial issues with several of the new Central American states.2\n\n24\n\nB E L I Z E’ S I N D E P E N D EN C E\n\nA British treaty with Guatemala was signed and ratified in 1859. It recognized British sovereignty over Belize and specified boundaries, but it did not end the conflict over Belize, because of an article that committed both countries to build a means of communication from Guatemala City to the Caribbean coast, which was never done. Guatemala later contended that this had been intended as compensation for what was in fact a treaty of cession; Britain denied this, insisting that the treaty was what it claimed to be on the face of it: a boundary treaty. A closer look at the facts is necessary in order to appreciate why, a century and a half after the issue seemed to have been resolved, it remains an intractable problem that has defied all attempts at solution. The Belize Settlement and Spain At the dawn of the seventeenth century Spain still dominated the Central American region. It did not remain unchallenged for long: British pirates roamed the coast from northern Yucatán to Bluefields in Nicaragua, raiding Spanish ships for whatever cargo they carried. One lucrative item was logwood, which was valued for its use as a dye in Europe.3 Peace treaties between Britain and Spain in 1667 and 1670 committed the British to suppress piracy, and within a few years many of the British buccaneers had settled down to cut logwood all along the coast, from Campeche on the Gulf of Mexico to the Caribbean coast of Central America. By the Treaty of Paris of 1763 Britain obtained Spanish license to cut logwood in the “Bay of Honduras,” as the settlement in Belize was called; the British would demolish all fortifications they had built, and Spain would ensure that they were not “disturbed or molested under any pretence whatsoever in the said places, in their occupation of cutting, loading, and carrying away logwood.”4 Disturbed and molested they were, however. In 1779, when war had broken out again in Europe between Britain and Spain, the Spaniards forcibly expelled the British from the settlement, which remained deserted until the European powers signed the Treaty of Versailles of 1783, in which Spain again afforded the British settlers the right to cut logwood and this time they defined limits: between the Hondo and Belize Rivers. The treaty maintained Spanish sovereignty over the area and required that “all the English, who may be dispersed in any other parts, whether on the Spanish Continent, or in any of the Islands whatsoever . . . shall retire within the District which has been above described.”5 The British cutters complained that the areas and privileges assigned to them were “most unexpectedly and extremely\n\nG UAT E M A L A N C L A I M A N D D E C O L O N I Z AT I O N\n\n25\n\ndiminished,”6 since the 1763 arrangement had merely referred to “the Bay of Honduras,” which was capable of a wide interpretation. By a further Convention of 1786 Spain agreed, in return for the British evacuation of the Mosquito Shore, to extend the limits of the Belize settlement southward to the Sibun River and to allow the settlers to cut any wood and gather any produce from the earth, but not to establish plantations.7 Britain appointed a “Superintendent” with illdefined powers, and subject to the Governor of Jamaica, to preside over the settlement; he arrived in Belize in 1786.8 A Spanish officer would inspect the settlement twice a year to ensure compliance. The Convention expressly forbade the formation of any system of government except as Spain and Britain may agree in order to maintain peace and order. The Convention’s limitations were quickly ignored, however, because of the internal development of the settlement. After the 1763 Treaty, a very basic system of government was codified for the British settlers in Belize by Vice Admiral Sir William Burnaby, who had been sent from Jamaica to put into effect the treaty provisions. This rudimentary set of rules provided for magistrates to pass laws and enforce them,9 although the settlers had already been administering their affairs by “Public Meetings” that passed resolutions deemed to have the force of law, and they also elected magistrates with some judicial and executive functions.10 At the time the settlers had been granted permission to cut logwood, the logwood trade was going through a sharp decline as a result of falling prices, and the British had begun to divert their attention to mahogany, which in 1765 accounted for about a quarter of the total value of exports; by the 1770s it had overtaken logwood in importance.11 After 1786 the settlers passed a new set of resolutions to regulate their claims to the mahogany works, but contrary to the terms of the treaties, which granted merely usufructuary rights, these lands were in fact treated as freehold property, being dealt with in all respects as such from an early time, and certainly by 1765.12 The shift from logwood to mahogany changed the nature of the settlement. Since the mahogany tree was much bigger than the logwood and was scattered over a much larger area, its trade required more land, more capital, and more labor. The first British settlers cut their own logwood, but by the 1720s they had begun to import African slaves to work for them. By the middle of the eighteenth century, the slaves outnumbered their masters.13 Most of the Africans were brought from Jamaica and some from the United States.14 In 1745 there were some 120 slaves in the settlement and by 1779, when the main activity had shifted to mahogany, there were 3000 (or 86 percent of the\n\n26\n\nB E L I Z E’ S I N D E P E N D EN C E\n\ntotal counted population). Although the slave trade was abolished by Britain in 1807, in 1820 there were still over 2,500 slaves in Belize. Thereafter the numbers gradually declined, until by 1835 the census counted 1,184 slaves, just under half of the enumerated population.15 The slaves in Belize were fortunate in that the settlement was surrounded by territories administered by Spanish officials who were only too happy to give them refuge as a means of destabilizing the British settlement. Slaves escaped with such regularity, and in such numbers, that their masters often felt that the very existence of the settlement was threatened by this phenomenon.16 In the eighteenth century, most escapees went north to Yucatán, where the Spanish authorities offered them protection.17 In the nineteenth century, when the settlement expanded to the west and south, the slaves sought and found refuge in neighboring Petén, or even further south, down the coast to Omoa and Trujillo in Honduras.18 The records are replete with references to what was undoubtedly a continuous flow of escapees.19 The independence of the Central American countries only made matters worse for the slave owners. In 1825, Superintendent Edward Codd reported that the neighboring republics had passed a law declaring that all slaves who went over to them would be declared free, complained that those areas were “vastly inhabited by descendants of former Runaways,” and declared that if the matter were not resolved “this Settlement must be entirely ruined.”20 Another contentious issue complained of by the visiting Spanish commissioners was the use made of the land. Although the slaves were brought to the settlement to cut logwood and mahogany, many of them were engaged in “making plantations”—that is, the cultivation of small plots of ground foods, grains, fruits, and vegetables, which was forbidden under the Treaties. When the Anglo-Spanish War (1796–1808, resulting from Spain having allied itself with Revolutionary France) broke out, the settlement at Belize was put on the alert; fortifications were built, and from Jamaica came artillery, ammunition, soldiers, and supplies. In 1798 a Spanish expedition from Bacalar (in Mexico) attacked the settlement. After a few skirmishes, however, it became clear that they would be unable to overcome the defending forces and so retired from the area.21 This was the last Spanish attempt to impose its rights of sovereignty in the settlement, although on very few occasions, even until 1816, Spain sent protests to Britain regarding the continued defiance by the British settlers of the Treaties of 1783/1786.22 Effectively, however, Spanish power was absent from the time of the failed military action in 1798. In 1800, the Law Officers of the Crown opined that the\n\nG UAT E M A L A N C L A I M A N D D E C O L O N I Z AT I O N\n\n27\n\n“Bay of Honduras” was a British possession.23 By 1802 the settlers had occupied areas as far south as Stann Creek and Deep River.24 In 1806 the mahogany cutters were active at Golden Stream, Deep River and Rio Grande.25 In 1816, the Superintendent affirmed that the woodcutters had long been in quiet possession of land as far south as the Moho River, only 15 nautical miles north of the Sarstoon, 26 and in 1825 the British Superintendent in Belize described the Sarstoon as being the southern boundary.27 Guatemala Stakes Its Claim It is not clear what part of the Spanish empire had been responsible for the territory of Belize from the Hondo to the Sarstoon during the colonial period. The limits of the Belize settlement described under the Treaties with Spain had nothing to do with her internal organization in Central America, but with negotiations between Spain and Britain at the end of wars that were concerned with other issues. The AngloSpanish treaties set limits to the settlement without any thought as to whether it fell under the Captaincy General of Yucatán or of Guatemala. What is known is that all the Spanish attacks on the settlement, and the inspectors who came to enforce the treaties, were from Yucatán, not Guatemala, and that, for example, in 1787 “boundary marks were erected and the new territory was formally assigned to the settlers by the then Governor of Yucatán.”28 The Spanish jurisdictional divisions were often vague and changed over time, and in any case no effective Spanish administration was ever established over any part of Belize.29 Barely a month after its declaration of independence, the government at Guatemala wrote to the Superintendent in Belize proposing a “definitive commercial agreement.”30 In December 1821 the Belize magistrates asked the Superintendent to protect their interests with the new states by the establishment of boundaries and the regulation of commercial intercourse.31 London advised, however, that in order to maintain neutrality as between Spain and the new republics it would be better to enter into informal arrangements rather than a formal treaty.32 Although by July of 1825 a British Consul had been appointed to Guatemala,33 the British government was for the most part consistent throughout this period in maintaining that “it is only with Spain that Great Britain can properly or conveniently entertain” the question of British tenure of Belize.34 Britain, meanwhile, exercised jurisdiction over the territory: in 1837, the Superintendent began to make crown grants of land outside the old treaty limits;35 on November 2, 1840 he issued a proclamation declaring that the\n\n28\n\nB E L I Z E’ S I N D E P E N D EN C E\n\n“Law of England is and shall be the Law of this Settlement or Colony of British Honduras.”36 In 1854 the first constitution was declared, providing for a House of Assembly of 18 elected representatives;37 in 1862 the settlement was declared the colony of “British Honduras,”38 and in 1871 it was made a Crown Colony.39 The first declaration by the government at Guatemala which might be seen as reflecting a claim to territory occupied by Britain occurred in 1832, when the minister of war announced to Congress that Belize was a great danger to Guatemala, as it represented a manifest usurpation of Guatemalan territory, and was increasing in population at such a rate that its encroachments were becoming more serious day by day.40 In 1834, the Guatemalan government purported to make a grant of the entire territory between the Sibun and the Sarstoon.41 The judges and magistrates along with the Superintendent in Belize then declared the territory held by the British settlers at the time of Central American independence as follows: an imaginary line drawn due north from “Garbutt’s Falls” to the Rio Hondo on the north and from the same point due south to the River Sarstoon in the south, should form the extreme line of our claims to the westward, and that the course of those two rivers from the points where this imaginary line cuts them to their fall into the sea, should form our respective boundaries to the north and the south.42\n\nBritish and U.S. Interests in Central America Britain had challenged Spanish hegemony of the Central American coast in several areas, not only in Belize. In 1823, the United States proclaimed the Monroe Doctrine, warning European countries off any new or recolonization in the Americas—and British Foreign Secretary Canning “proceeded to adopt and carry out a policy calculated to render ineffective the Monroe doctrine in so far as it conflicted with British designs.”43 In the 1840s, the United States was intent on building an interoceanic canal across Nicaragua, and in 1849 that country granted the United States the right in perpetuity to do so. The British, however, were keen on maintaining their grip on the Mosquito Shore (a territory that straddled Honduras and Nicaragua), and warned the Central American nations that Britain would resist any attempts by them to encroach on the territory of the Mosquito King. In 1850, Britain and the United States attempted to resolve their differences in the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty, by which both governments agreed not to\n\nG UAT E M A L A N C L A I M A N D D E C O L O N I Z AT I O N\n\n29\n\ncolonize or occupy any part of Central America.44 They later agreed that this undertaking did not apply to Belize’s dependencies nor to “the small islands in the neighborhood of that settlement.”45 The treaty left undetermined the areas that would be considered as “dependencies.” Britain took advantage of this ambiguity, and proceeded, in 1852, to declare Ruatan, Bonacca, and four neighboring islands in Honduras a British “Colony of the Bay Islands.”46 This naturally aggravated the United States, and its relations with the United Kingdom were further strained by the filibustering activity of U.S. nationals, which culminated in the U.S. filibuster William Walker declaring his own government in Nicaragua.47 Negotiations to resolve their conflicts over Central America resulted in the Dallas-Clarendon Treaty of 1856. Britain agreed to return the Bay Islands to Honduras, and the Mosquito territory was incorporated into Nicaragua. In return, the United States agreed that Belize was a British settlement, and that it was bounded on the north by the Mexican Province of Yucatán, and on the south by the River Sarstoon.48 The treaty required the UK to settle the boundaries with Guatemala within two years. Although the treaty was not ratified for reasons unrelated to the Belize question, Britain decided to carry out its provisions, and sent an emissary first to Washington and then to Central America to pursue this objective. In 1859 and 1860, treaties were signed by the British with Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Honduras, which gave effect to the Dallas-Clarendon Treaty.49 The Anglo-Guatemalan Treaty of 1859 By the time the Dallas-Clarendon Treaty was signed, Guatemala and Britain had already been engaged in diplomatic negotiations. In 1849, Britain and Guatemala signed and ratified a Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation; it did not mention Belize at all, and Guatemala did not enter any reservation with respect to it.50 In 1850, Guatemala appointed a consul in Belize.51 Guatemala sent an emissary to London, who in 1857 submitted a draft treaty to the Foreign Office setting out the actual British possessions “on and prior to the 1st of January 1850.” It stated that Guatemala was renouncing its rights to the territory, and that as a compensation for the renunciation made, Britain was to give Guatemala “effective and positive guaranty” against filibusters.52 The UK refused to acknowledge that the territory was Guatemalan, or to offer any compensation whatsoever, and appointed Charles Wyke to negotiate the required agreements. In 1859 and 1860, Wyke negotiated treaties with Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua in accordance with the terms agreed previously with the\n\n30\n\nB E L I Z E’ S I N D E P E N D EN C E\n\nUnited States. In his annual message to Congress in 1860, President James Buchanan declared that the final settlement of the Central American question was entirely satisfactory to his government.53 The arrangements regarding Belize, however, turned out not to be satisfactory to Britain, because Wyke had exceeded his instructions. He had been told that, in order not to offend the terms of the treaty of 1850 with the United States, the boundary must be described not as involving any cession or new acquisition from Guatemala “but, as it is in fact, simply as the definition of a boundary long existing, but not hitherto ascertained.”54 Wyke, however, believed that Britain had encroached on the Guatemalan territory, and that Guatemala would demand some form of compensation in order to sign the boundary treaty. He, therefore, agreed to include in the treaty a provision (Article 7) requiring Guatemala and Britain “conjointly to use their best efforts” to establish a means of communication from Guatemala City to the Atlantic coast.55 On April 30, 1859, a “Convention between Her Majesty and the Republic of Guatemala, relative to the Boundary of British Honduras,” was signed.56 It declared: It is agreed . . . that the boundary between the Republic and the British Settlement and Possessions in the Bay of Honduras, as they existed previous to and on the 1st day of January, 1850, and have continued to exist up to the present time, was, and is as follows: Beginning at the mouth of the River Sarstoon in the Bay of Honduras, and proceeding up the mid-channel thereof to Gracias a Dios Falls; then turning right and continuing by a line drawn direct from Gracias a Dios Falls to Garbutt’s Falls on the River Belize, and from Garbutt’s Falls due north until it strikes the Mexican frontier.57\n\nRatifications of the Convention were exchanged on September 12, 1859,58 and that should have been the end of the matter, but it turned out to be just the beginning of a century and a half of strife, occasioned by Article 7 of the treaty. It seems, however, that in 1859 the Guatemalan government was more concerned about security than compensation. Foreign Minister Pedro de Aycinena wrote to the C"
