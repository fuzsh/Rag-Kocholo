        "text": "2001 Scores\n\nStatus: Free\n\nFreedom Rating: 1.0\n\nCivil Liberties: 1\n\nPolitical Rights: 1\n\nOverview\n\nThe government of the Bahamas announced in October 2000 that it was creating a new intelligence unit to investigate suspicious financial activity in the island chain as part of an effort to remove the country from an international money-laundering \"blacklist.\" The measure followed the release of a report in June by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) – a coordinating body set up a decade ago by the Group of 7 (G-7) economic powers to coordinate international efforts against money laundering) – that cited the Bahamas for not doing enough to fight illegal flows of cash. The finding was made just four months after the United States called for the Bahamas to improve its judicial system, win convictions against narcotics kingpins, and speed up extraditions. In August 2000, the country mourned the death of former Prime Minister Lynden Pindling, the \"Black Moses,\" the country's independence hero and leader of the Bahamas for 25 years.\n\nThe Bahamas, a 700-island nation in the Caribbean, is a member of the Commonwealth. It was granted independence in 1973. The British monarchy is represented by a governor-general.\n\nUnder the 1973 constitution, a bicameral parliament consisted of a 49-member house of assembly directly elected for five years and a 16-member senate with 9 members appointed by the prime minister, 4 by the leader of the parliament opposition, and 3 by the governor-general. The number of seats in the assembly has been reduced by 9, to 40, in keeping with a campaign promise by the Free National Movement (FNM) party. The prime minister is the leader of the party that commands a majority in the house.\n\nPindling's Progressive Liberal Party (PLP), dogged by years of allegations of corruption and high official involvement in narcotics trafficking, was ousted after two and a half decades rule by Ingraham and the FNM in the 1992 elections. Hubert Ingraham, a lawyer and former cabinet official, had been expelled by the PLP in 1986 for his outspoken attacks on corruption and became leader of the FNM in 1990.\n\nIngraham vowed to bring honesty, efficiency, and accountability to government. Pindling, at the time the western hemisphere's longest-serving head of government, relied on his image as the father of the nation's independence. With 90 percent of the electorate voting, the FNM won 32 seats in the house of assembly, to the PLP's 17. Pindling held his own seat and became the official opposition leader.\n\nUpon taking office as prime minister, Ingraham appointed a Commission of Inquiry to investigate the Pindling government. In 1995 the commission detailed widespread mismanagement and malpractice in the national telephone and airline companies. In the 1997 election, Ingraham claimed credit for revitalizing the economy by attracting foreign investment. Voters handed his FNM a 34-to-6 majority in parliament, rebuking Pindling and the PLP for a second time. In April 1997, Pindling resigned as opposition leader and was replaced by Perry Christie, who had served in the PLP cabinet until he denounced government corruption in the wake of a drug probe.\n\nIn the last few years, a spiraling crime rate linked to illegal narcotics and gunrunning has left Bahamians questioning whether the islands were returning to the ways of the last decade, when the Bahamas earned the nickname \"a nation for sale.\" In March 2000, the U.S. State Department praised the Bahamas for giving \"high priority\" to combating the transshipment of drugs and for cooperation on regional antinarcotics efforts. In addition to setting up the new antidrug intelligence unit, the Ingraham government also announced sweeping plans to bring the country's financial sector into full compliance with international standards and practices. In June amendments to the Money Laundering (Proceeds of Crime) Act strengthened requirements for financial institutions to report suspicious and unusual transactions. Among the initiatives undertaken in October were the mandating of cooperation of bank supervisors with international authorities and the granting of permission to home-country banking regulators to conduct inspections that ensure Bahamas-licensed affiliates of foreign banks comply with international standards. That same month the U.S. Internal Revenue Service went to court to seek records of U.S. taxpayers with credit card accounts in the Bahamas and two other offshore havens.\n\nPolitical Rights and Civil Liberties\n\nCitizens can change their government democratically. Constitutional guarantees regarding the right to organize political parties, civic organizations, and labor unions are generally respected, as is the free exercise of religion. Human rights organizations have broad access to institutions and individuals.\n\nThe judicial system is headed by a supreme court and a court of appeals, with the right of appeal under certain circumstances to the Privy Council in London. There are local courts, and on the outer islands the local commissioners have magisterial powers. Despite antidrug legislation and a 1987 agreement with the United States to suppress the drug trade, there is evidence of drug-related corruption and money laundering, although less than during the Pindling years.\n\nViolent crime is a growing concern, particularly in Nassau, and has been a focus of the Ingraham government. Nongovernmental organizations have documented the increase in recent years of violent crime, as well as the occasional beating of prisoners and other abuse by police, including arbitrary arrests and lengthy pretrial detention. No independent agency exists to investigate reports of police abuse.\n\nRights groups also criticize the inhumane conditions and overcrowding at the Fox Hill prison, the country's only penal facility. Fox Hill remains filled to more than twice its intended capacity. In 1996 Ingraham reinstated the death penalty for murder. In 1998, he commuted the death sentences of 17 prisoners who had spent more than five years on death row – in keeping with the limit set by the Privy Council in London. However, that September he announced that his government would limit the right of appeal in capital cases. Ingraham also kicked off the hiring of 200 more police officers in an effort to crack down on violent crime. In 1998, 30 people sat on death row. Two people were executed.\n\nThere are three daily and several weekly newspapers, all privately owned, and they express a variety of views on public issues, as do the government-run radio station and four privately owned radio broadcasters. Opposition politicians claim, however, that the state-run television service, Broadcasting Corporation of the Bahamas (ZNS), does not accord them the same coverage as that given to the ruling party. Full freedom of expression is constrained by strict libel laws. Unlike its predecessor, the Ingraham government has not made use of these laws against independent newspapers. It has amended media laws to allow for private ownership of broadcasting outlets.\n\nLabor, business, and professional organizations are generally free. Unions have the right to strike, and collective bargaining is prevalent. Discrimination against the disabled and persons of Haitian descent persists. Between 25,000 and 40,000 Haitians reside illegally in the Bahamas. Tight citizenship laws and a strict work permit system leave Haitians with few rights. The influx has created social tension because of the strain on government services. Violence against women is a serious, widespread problem. In 1999, the government and private women's organizations kicked off a public awareness campaign highlighting the problems of abuse and domestic violence. In 2000, the Department of Social Services created two shelters for battered women."
