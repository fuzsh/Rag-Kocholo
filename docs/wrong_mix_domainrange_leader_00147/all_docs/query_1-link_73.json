I know that my life would have been more useful and fulfilled had I learned at an earlier age the principles described here. The twenty-one steps of The Templeton Plan could have provided me and others of my generation with clearer guideposts to success. James Ellison relates lucidly the ideas and experiences Ishared with him in the course of many interviews. During my seventy-four years I have made my share of mistakes, but Mr. Ellison thought it best to stress those experiences and thoughts from which the reader may derive a useful lesson. To overcome the problems that face each one of us — and no life is problem-free — it is crucial to have a plan to live by. The plan this book suggests is by no means complete. Many principles for a happy and successful existence — what you might call the laws of life — are not included because I have not yet learned them. The Templeton Plan is written for those who consider themselves students in the school of total success. Each student should study the twenty-one steps included here and then try to add to them. Nothing can be more beneficial for your spiritual growth than to put down in writing what you believe are the most important laws for happiness, usefulness, and success.\n\nvi\n\nI\n\nForeword\n\nI am convinced that the basic principles for happiness and success can be examined, tested, and agreed upon so that the best ones can be combined into textbooks for teaching in schools. No subject in the curriculum would seem more important than one that can help us fulfill our potential as human beings. It is my vision that more and more people worldwide will lead lives of happiness, usefulness, and prosperity if we work continuously toward spiritual growth and better understanding of the virtues by which we should govern ourselves. And it is my hope that not only each of us but also our children and grandchildren will one day benefit from reading this book. John Marks Templeton\n\nIntroduction\n\nJohn\n\nMarks Templeton, regarded by Wall Street as one of the world's wisest investors, is the founder of the Templeton mutual fund group, which now manages more than $6 billion owned by more than 500,000 public investors. He started his investment career on a borrowed $10,000 and thus is a living embarrassment to the efficient market theory, which holds that you cannot start from nothing and end up with a large fortune in a single lifetime. Forbes magazine has dubbed him \"one of the handful of true investment greats in a field crowded with mediocrity and bloated reputations. \" Templeton believes that successful investing is a product of a person's overall relationship to life and to the universe. Unlike most people, he is at peace with himself. He has sorted the important questions out. He believes that God created and is continuously creating the universe. While many people hold that financial success is separate from religious belief, that in fact there is a conflict between the two, it is John Templeton's conviction that the two are related. He contends that the most successful people are often the most religiously motivated. They are likely to have the keenest understanding of the importance of ethics in business. They can be trusted to give full measure and not cheat their customers. In trying to appraise the value of a corporation, which is the heart of selecting investment bargains,\n\nviii\n\nI Introduction\n\nthere is nothing more important than the quality of the management. Each year, Templeton and his associates study hundreds of corporations to determine which ones offer the best opportunities for their clients. They have found that the common denominator connecting successful people and successful enterprises is a devotion to ethical and spiritual principles. When John Templeton first became a trustee at the Princeton Theological Seminary thirty-six years ago, there was another trustee named John J. Newberry. As a young man, Newberry had worked for F. W. Woolworth. When he left to open his first J. J. Newberry store, he instituted the practice of daily prayer meetings. Newberry hired people who wanted to open each working day with prayer. Throughout the day, they usually did a better job for customers because they began with a better attitude. The Newberry chain spread rapidly until it included hundreds of stores. For John Templeton there is no special magic in this remarkable success story. He is convinced that you can credit a significant part of Newberry's success to the prayer meetings with which he opened each store each morning. J. C. Penney, a devout Christian, built up one of the largest retail organizations in the world, based squarely on the principles of brotherhood and a belief in God. Sam Walton, the originator of Wal-Mart stores in Arkansas and a fabulous Wall Street success story, was another who founded his business on Christian attitudes with both customers and employees. No other retail organization over the past thirty years could rival Wal-Mart's steady and consistent growth.\n\nIntroduction\n\nI ix\n\nAt Templeton, all of the directors' and shareholders' meetings open with prayer. But prayer is never used as an aid in making specific stock selections. \"That would be a gross misinterpretation of God's methods/' Templeton says. \"What we do pray for is wisdom. We pray that the decisions we make today will be wise decisions and that our talks about different stocks will be wise talks. Of course, our discussions and decisions are fallible and sometimes flawed. No one should expect that, just because he begins with prayer, every decision he makes is going to be profitable. However, I do believe that, if you pray, you will make fewer stupid mistakes.\" Tales of the Templeton wizardry are often told in dollar growth figures. For example, where would you be today if you had put $10,000 into his first mutual fund in 1954? Your investment, including reinvestment distributions, would have grown to more than $800,000 by 1987! That's how successful the Templeton technique has been over a thirty-twoyear period. And to what does Templeton credit this remarkable growth? \"Backed by our beliefs,\" he says, \"we're not so uptight and on edge as those who are in the business merely to make money. We start each day by setting our minds on the important things and praying. All our transactions are influenced by that. \"There are businesses that apply the wrc-Christian principle. They ignore the human factor. They lack the wholehearted desire to offer better service and higher quality at lower prices. More often than not, those businesses fail. In general, people who take advantage in their dealings will get a bad reputation and before long others will not want to deal with them.\n\nx\n\nI\n\nIntroduction\n\n\"That greed and callousness are shortsighted business methods is a crucial lesson for us all to absorb. Learning it will spell success. You should always care about your customer. You should treat your employee as you want to be treated. If you follow those precepts, which are rooted in religion, financial success is likely to follow/ ' The purpose of The Templeton Plan is to reveal the vital connections between belief in religious principles and belief in oneself that will enable you to become a successful and happy person. Through Templeton's twenty-one-step program that follows, you will learn how the person who lives by God's principles is the same person who will succeed in life, making lasting friendships and most likely reaping significant financial rewards. It is suggested that you devote yourself to one step each day, over a period of three weeks. Each step should be studied carefully until the following questions can be answered in a satisfactory and thorough manner: 1. What do these ideas really mean? 2. How do they apply to my own life? 3. How can I use their meaning in achieving success? The Templeton Plan: 21 Steps to Success and Happi-\n\nness has worked for many people — for John Templeton himself and for others. There is no reason that it cannot work for you. James Ellison\n\nStep!\n\nLearning the Laws of Life J. he world operates on spiritual principles, just as it does on the laws of physics and gravity. These principles, or laws, are as important for our welfare as stopping for a red light at a busy intersection. Our inner life is saved or lost to the extent that we obey or disobey the laws of life. These laws are the underpinning of The Templeton Plan. We will examine them now, at the start, so that we can have a clear idea of our direction. Just as a baby learns to walk by taking one step at a time, so we will look at the laws of life one at a time to assess the ground that will be covered in our twenty-one steps. Truthfulness is a law of life. In the farming community where John Templeton grew up, there was a general saying that your word was your bond. People of character would never promise something and then go back on their word. A contract between two parties did not have to be put into writing; there was no need for a court or a judge to enforce it. Civilization, as it was then perceived by many, was a place where the handshake was sacred. Reliability is a law of life. The shopkeeper or professional who prospers today is the one whose\n\n2\n\n/ Stepl\n\nword you can depend on. If he says he will have a certain product available for you Tuesday afternoon, he will have it Tuesday afternoon. If she tells you the product is genuine leather, you can rest assured that genuine lealher is what youTl get. Faithfulnesses a law of life. You expect people not to cheat you or put themselves ahead of you. Faithfulness means that they will be faithful to their trust. You can rely on them not to cut corners or try to deceive you. Perseverance is a law of life. You will always give your business and your trust to someone who will see a project through even if difficulties arise — and they usually do. In everything we do, there are problems to solve, and the person who gives up or turns to an easier task is not the kind of person who will find success. Thirty-six years ago, John Templeton helped to found the Young Presidents' Organization, a worldwide club. Each of the thousands of members, though they come from a wide range of cultural and economic backgrounds, before age forty became president of a company employing over a hundred people. What do these men and women have in common? \"Perseverance/' Templeton explains. \"When they undertake to accomplish something, they accomplish it. The program may change along the way, but they don't give up.\" Enthusiasm is a law of life. To be a success you must work at a task with your whole heart. Enthusiasm is contagious. You can infect your suppliers and customers with it. Energy is a law of life. Successful, deeply fulfilled people have a high degree of energy. They are\n\nLearning the Laws of Life\n\nI 3\n\nnot lazy, nor do they spend much time on idle matters. They are constantly trying new things, experimenting, searching for a cheaper method of production or for ways to improve the quality of a product. Humility is a law of life. The young should welcome, not ignore, the advice and experience of their teachers and parents. The majority of parents discipline their children because they love them and want the best for them. For children to rebel against their teachers and parents flies in the face of the simplest common sense. The teacher is in school to help students; students should be humble enough to realize that the teacher knows more than they do. Through a humble approach to life, the successful person will learn at an early age to profit from the knowledge of parents and teachers. Pleasing others, is a law of life. Now, of course, it's impossible to please everyone, but we will be more productive and successful if we try. That means pleasing your colleagues, pleasing your clients and customers. The concept of giving pleasure to others is having a healthy new influence on the business world. There are now dozens of service clubs where business people gather as equals once a week to discuss mutual concerns — the Rotary and Kiwanis clubs, among others. As an old Oriental proverb has it, \"If you wish your merit to be known, acknowledge that of other people/' Giving is a law of life. Successful people give and give still more; their giving is returned to them in full measure. Watch the top people in business. They are the ones who give more than is expected of them. In return, they receive the rewards. They\n\n4\n\n/ Step 1\n\nattract the customers. Their giving leads ultimately to success, both in worldly terms and spiritually. John Templeton serves on the board of corporators of the oldest corporation in the United States, the Presbyterian Ministers7 Fund. It is a life insurance company that insures the lives of ministers of all faiths. The company seal carries a drawing of the sower. The Presbyterian Fund has enjoyed considerable success for more than two centuries. They have given their policyholders more insurance for a lower price than other companies. And their representatives, who are usually Christian ministers, never fail to explain to prospective clients that the fund is founded on the concept that as you sow, so shall you reap. Learning from others is a law of life. As a child, John Templeton used to observe his schoolmates as well as the adults with whom he came in contact. He watched the farmers in the country. He learned from each of them which things led to success, happiness, and productivity and which did not. He learned what to emulate as well as what to avoid. Most importantly, he learned to assimilate the wisdom of many lives. You can do the same. If you're alert, it is possible to learn from each person you meet, to avoid mistakes, and to put new virtues into practice. Jew is a law of life. John Templeton names as the most joyful group of people he has ever met the young women studying to be members of the society of Mother Teresa. He observed that their happiness had an almost visible glow, and it had nothing to do with self-indulgence. They were happy because of the opportunity to serve.\n\nLearning the Laws of Life\n\nI\n\n5\n\nWhile Templeton was attending the twenty-fifth anniversary of Mother Teresa's order, the Missionaries of Charity, in Calcutta, a young novice approached Mother Teresa and in an overjoyed manner cried out, \"Mother, for six hours I've been handling the body of Christ!\" She meant that she had found a man in the street whose condition was so bad that it took her six hours to get him cleaned up, comfortable, and in bed. She felt that Christ had come to her in the form of that man. What a joy it was that she could be useful, that she was in a position to help Christ when he came to her in need. Success need not necessarily take a financial form. But real success can never be achieved without the element of usefulness, of serving. Altruism is a law of life. The altruistic person tries to make our world a better place to live in. There are medical researchers who have improved our lot by discovering penicillin or insulin. Every person — each in his or her own way — can make the world a better place. Those who search for success and happiness will find a way. One man makes the world a better place by developing his farm with more modern agricultural methods. Another man, a widower, raises his six children on his own. They love him so much that, when they marry, they live near home so that the family needn't split apart. That man made the world a better place by loving his six children. They had the benefit and warmth of his love, and that is a form of riches that is always passed on. The altruist discovers an individual way to make the world a better place than it was before. It may be because he writes a book. Or because she paints\n\n6\n\n/ Step 1\n\na picture. Or because he rears his children with intelligence and compassion. Or because she invents a new cooking recipe. Or because his life serves as a shining light for others. There are large and small ways to make the world a better place, and all the paths, as different as they may be, lead to success. Templeton recalls a school near where he grew up in Winchester, Tennessee, that tried to teach more than reading, writing, and arithmetic. The Webb School was started by an elderly man named Shaunee Webb. The motto of the school was \"We Teach Character/' Webb regarded it as his principal purpose to teach students the laws of life along with Latin, history, and mathematics. Many graduates of the Webb School became nationally known, their success based on what they learned from the founder. Templeton says: \"I am now offering prizes for the best essays on the laws of life, written by high school and college students. My hope is that this will create a beautiful snowball effect. The students writing the essays will have to read extensively in the fields of ethics, religion, and philosophy. Consequently, ata very young age, they will have formulated their own laws and will learn to focus on them. When the prizewinning essays are published, they will reach others, and gradually a literature on the laws of life can be built up. \"Taking that thought a step further, it might even be possible to develop a world council on the laws of life. I believe there are such laws that every religion believes in. We might thereby produce a world view, thus eliminating conflicts between individuals and even nations, because we will have\n\nLearning the Laws of Life\n\nI\n\n7\n\ndeveloped a more sophisticated understanding of the principles that unify us. \"My guess is that there are literally hundreds of such laws that can be agreed on by 99 percent of all people. It would then be possible to prepare textbooks for high schools and colleges so that there could be courses on the laws of life. I believe that such a program would help religions and governments to cooperate with one another more easily/' Step 1 teaches you to study the laws of life as you proceed on the road to success and happiness. Study those you know and search for new ones. The list of those laws we have examined is small: Truthfulness Reliability Faithfulness Perseverance Enthusiasm Energy Humility Pleasing others Giving Learning from others Joy Altruism There are many more laws, perhaps hundreds more. Start with these twelve and apply the meaning of each law to your own life. Are you lacking in energy? Could you use an extra dose of enthusiasm? Consider this a checklist to use to monitor your own\n\n8\n\nI\n\nStepl\n\nstrengths and weaknesses. Remember: The laws of life are the basic building blocks for a successful and happy life.\n\nStep 2\n\nUsing What You Have Louring John Templeton's four decades as an investment counselor, he has seen many families who have left their children great wealth. But that kind of inheritance can create more problems than it solves. He likes to quote the founder of Pennsylvania, William Penn, who said, \"He who is taught to live upon little owes more to his father's wisdom than he who has a great deal left him does to his father's care.\" In studying hundreds of clients, Templeton has never been able to discern a connection between happiness and inherited wealth. In fact, in most cases the inheritance of wealth has done more harm than good. It tends to give people false values and causes them to show personal pride without having earned that pride. It causes people to take the edge off their efforts. Templeton is convinced that the young should earn their own spending money. A child needs to learn to work as early as six years old. Although it takes an expenditure of time and imagination for the parent to figure out what a child of six can do that is useful, there are many activities that will teach a child the meaning of pride in work. In the country, children can tend a lemonade stand, or grow radishes to sell to the grocery store, or collect\n\n10\n\nI\n\nStep 2\n\ncans for the return of the deposit. In the city, children can be assigned chores around the apartment. Templeton, who grew up in the rural South, feels that it's rare for a country child to get in trouble with the law later in life. On a farm, children can feed the farm animals or help with the preparation of food; they are more likely than their city counterparts to become useful members of the family at a very young age. As a result, they will mature earlier and have a firmer grasp of the laws of life. Contrary to current psychological opinion, children in many respects are miniature adults. They have a burning desire to stand on their own two feet. Thus, when a mother does her daughter's homework, feeling she's helping the child, she is actually doing her harm in the long run. Granted, the child will get good grades the next day in school. But it's far better to take the longer and more arduous route and show the girl how to do the long division herself. She will then have more personal pride and self-confidence, feel more adult, and be better able to take the next step in school, because today's lesson is based on what was learned the previous day. If the mother causes her daughter to miss out on that single step in her progress, then the daughter may have trouble picking it up later. As mentioned in Step 1, the successful person learns from others. By careful observation, you can monitor the mistakes of others and not make them yourself. You can also begin to see who is happy and why they are happy. Train yourself to watch those in your school, at your place of employment, in your own family. And listen to what they say. Listening intelligently is a key to success, because\n\nUsing What You Have\n\nI 11\n\nyou are storing up the wisdom and the folly of others and beginning to discriminate between the two. Never forget that learning is a lifetime activity of vast importance. John Templeton recalls a friend from his high school who, upon graduating, got a job and never read another book. He watched television in his spare time, went to movies, did some hunting and fishing, but made no effort to expand the frontiers of his mind. At age forty, he was no better educated than he'd been at sixteen, and that's the sign of a wasted life. Wasted lives are never successful lives. In fact, we're in a position to learn more once we're out of school, because school is a kind of hothouse environment; it is later, out in the world, that we meet the realities of life. Once involved in the world of work, books should take on an even greater importance. We can test them against our greater maturity and knowledge. We can absorb their messages with a more profound understanding. Years ago John Templeton set himself a goal to learn something new each day. It is important not to let a day go by without learning the meaning of an unfamiliar word, without a new insight, without experiencing a fresh taste, thought, or sensation. If you travel to your job by bus, watch the other passengers. You will discover that the majority of them do absolutely nothing. They simply sit there. Are they thinking something significant? Are they working out a problem? The chances are they are letting time die, unused. But those who are going to get ahead, who will achieve success, will refuse to waste their moments\n\n2\n\n/ Step 2\n\nn that bus. They will study. They will read or write. They will use their time, to and from school or work, for self-improvement, production, and continued learning. By listening to the passengers on that bus you can guess with fair accuracy who is going to achieve success and who is not. If you hear someone saying that \"he said so and so and she said so and so and then he said so and so,\" you can bet that person is not forging ahead. But the one who is saying that \"this is what I learned yesterday; this is what I hope to accomplish today\" is a person on the road to success. Besides perfecting the art of listening, the successful person is the one who asks questions. You don't learn much if you're doing the talking. Form the habit of asking yourself, \"What can I learn from this person?\" Discover what the individual likes to talk about and then ask questions in that area of interest. This practice will pay off in two ways: You will please the person by asking intelligent questions and at the same time you will learn something yourself. Successful people seek advice more often than they give it. John Templeton gives an illustration of this strategy from his days as a young man working for the National Geophysical Company in Dallas, Texas. It was his first major job after college and he was bent on succeeding. At least once a month he approached his employer and said, \"What can I do to improve my work?\" Again, there was a twofold benefit: While Templeton learned how to do a better job, his boss realized how sincere he was in his desire to improve. Within a year, he became financial\n\nUsing What You Have\n\nI 13\n\nvice-president of the company; the key to his advancement, he's convinced, was his attitude of constantly asking questions. The question \"What would you do if you were me?\" is a stepping-stone toward success. By asking that question, you'll not only get creative suggestions but other people will realize that you're the type of person whose career course is decidedly on the upward swing. A candidate for success should always carry a library. You can make the minutes count, whether waiting at the airport to board an airplane or holding on to a strap on the subway. You may be catching up on office work, or analyzing current events, or simply reading to improve your mind and widen your knowledge. If you arrive early for an appointment, you can have papers to occupy you while you wait. By having books and papers with you at all times — your portable library — you can always accomplish something that will advance your career that much more quickly. Success comes more easily to those who were given sound role models. John Templeton was most fortunate in that respect. He was born into a family of modest means in the small town of Winchester, Tennessee. His father, Harvey Maxwell Templeton, was a lawyer by profession, even though he'd never attended college. But, in a town of fewer than two thousand people, legal work alone. that would become operated a cotton as many as two\n\nyou couldn't earn a living from Showing the entrepreneurial flair his son's trademark, he built and gin, which sometimes produced thousand bales of cotton in one\n\n14\n\nI\n\nStep 2\n\nseason. Even though the farmers paid Harvey only two dollars a bale, that was enough to support the Templeton family throughout the year. But it was only a beginning. Like his son, Harvey Templeton was never satisfied with less than the utmost effort. His business led to a cotton storage venture, to fertilizer retailing, to profitable speculation on the New York and New Orleans cotton exchanges. Young John listened eagerly to tales of the wheeling and dealing that engaged much of his father's attention each week. Nor did Harvey Templeton stop there. He was also an agent for a number of insurance companies. He was acutely sensitive to ways he could profit from the rise and fall of the rural economy in his section of Tennessee. When farms came up for auction because of nonpayment of real estate taxes, he would buy a farm if the price was unusually low. He would then plan to resell the farm for a profit at a later date. Young John was always watching and evaluating his father's enterprises. John's convictions about the hazards of incurring debt were reinforced as he saw many farmers losing their land at auction. And his natural inclination toward independence and selfreliance grew stronger as he saw the excitement and potential profit that accompanied his father's business activities. By 1925, Harvey Templeton owned six farms, in addition to his cotton gin, legal work, and other business activities. Also, by using low-cost surplus lumber and workmen who couldn't find other jobs, he was able to build about two dozen small homes\n\nUsing What You Have\n\nI 15\n\non his growing real estate holdings. He then rented them for from two to six dollars a month — a good return on houses that cost only two hundred to five hundred dollars to build. John Templeton learned the uses of ambition and drive from his father, who provided a relatively good living for his family during hard times. Even though they were not wealthy by the outside world's standards, they were the second family in the county to own both a telephone and an automobile. And, significant for John's development, year by year he observed a gradual increase in the family's financial position through his father's hard work and creative business flair. But his father was only half of John Templeton's background. John's mother Vella provided a quite different — but equally important — example for John to incorporate into his own personality. First of all, she was very well educated among women of that era. She had attended grammar school and high school in Winchester, and then she went on to study mathematics, Greek, and Latin for more than seven years at the Winchester Normal College. Vella's interests were as wide-ranging as her husband's. Though well educated and an intellectual by inclination, she enjoyed raising chickens, cows, and pigs. She enjoyed gardening and raised peaches, corn, cabbage, cherries, asparagus, and green beans. The Templeton table was always well supplied with fresh vegetables, meat, and dairy products. Young John, along with his brother Harvey, Jr., was often underfoot as his mother went about her daily tasks. And it was in this environment that he\n\n16\n\nI\n\nStep 2\n\nlearned his first important lesson about profits — at the age of four. To start with, he found that, with a little work, he could grow his own beans in his mother's garden at a cost of next to nothing for the seeds. Then he could sell the beans to a local country store for a handsome profit. John came up with the idea of selling produce on his own. His mother allowed him the freedom to set up his little business, but the outside advice and direction ended there. From then on, he was on his own. The practical business savvy that young Templeton inherited from his father was clearly one aspect of his inheritance. But his mother's influence was crucial in bringing precocious financial achievement into perfect balance with sound spiritual values. John learned early from his mother that the content of his character could lead either to success or failure. His mother and his aunt Leila taught him how right thoughts can forge right actions. For a number of years they kept the Cumberland Presbyterian church going by raising enough money to pay the part-time minister. Thus they taught this future investment genius a valuable lesson on different ways to raise money and what money, once earned, can do to help others. It is clear that, in John Templeton's case, his background helped point the way to success. But success is never a legacy. It must be earned by each individual on his or her own terms. Although young John was given a better start than many, like all of us he had a long way to go before, through growth and transformation, he could truly call himself a successful human being.\n\nUsing What You Have\n\nI 17\n\nA careful reading of Step 2 should help you to raise your success and happiness quotient. Try to follow these rules: 1 . Discover your strengths and then use them to the best advantage. 2. Listen to others and learn from them. 3. Observe the actions of others so that you can profit from both their strengths and their mistakes. 4. Do not wait for goals to materialize but go out and actively seek goals. 5. Money can be inherited but never success. It must be earned by each individual. 6. The surest way to achieve success is to emulate sound role models, whether they be your parents, your teachers, your friends, or your business associates.\n\nStep 3\n\nHelping Yourself by Helping Others V V hen people hear the word ministry, they automatically think of a church or government office. But, in truth, everything productive that you can accomplish in life is a ministry. If you make shoes that last, you have performed a ministry. It's aan ministry produce a bountiful harvest. you're internist towho saves lives or a novelist who If creates beauty, then that too is a ministry. Because your ministry is also your livelihood, choose with care. Make certain that you love what you do. By loving your work, by taking the attitude that it should be done on behalf of others, you'll be doing it as a ministry. You will be creating something that the world needs — which is dedication to the job at hand — and that makes you a genuine minister. As a giver, a helper, you are much more likely to be successful than the person who works simply to earn a living. You will make more money and receive greater recognition. The more one works and plants, the more one will harvest. The more good one can do, the more success one can achieve. Perhaps this is best explained byJesus in the Bible parable of the talents. To quote John Temple ton, who likes to tell his own\n\nHelping Yourself by Helping Others\n\nI 19\n\nversion of the story: \"A man going on a trip entrusted his property to his servants. He gave one man five talents, another two, and another one, each according to his abilities. While he was gone, the man with five talents traded with his money and made five talents more. And the man with two talents traded his and made an additional two talents. But the man with one talent buried his master's money in the ground. \"When the master returned, he went over his accounts with his three servants. The man entrusted with five talents explained that he'd invested and made five more. And the man given two talents also showed how he'd put his talents to work and now had four talents. The master complimented them both, told them that they had been faithful servants, and that he would entrust them with greater responsibilities. \"The man with one talent came forward and said, 'Master, I figured you're a hard man and you might rob me of my earnings, so I hid this money in the ground.' \"His master replied, 'You're a wicked and lazy slave. You knew I'd demand your profit. You should have put my money in the bank where it would draw interest. Give your money to the man with ten talents. For to the man who has will be given more. And from the man who has nothing, even his nothing will be taken away!\" In New Testament times, a silver talent was valuable currency, worth well over a thousand of today's dollars. spokefrom in parables he used them to But veil Jesus the truth those whoandwere not willing to see it. Those, on the other hand, who\n\n20\n\nI\n\nStep 3\n\nwere zealous for the truth would not rest until they had found out his meaning. Thus the talent certainly stood for something else, something with a more spiritual weight than money alone. Many people, Templeton among them, believe that the talents Jesus spoke of were literally abilities that God bestowed on each individual human being — few in some cases, many in others. For John Templeton, nothing in his religious training had more influence on him than the parable of the talents. What exactly did he learn from it? He learned that God gives talents to each of us. He also learned that God hands these talents out in uneven measure. But, although God may have given more talents to one person than another, he expects everyone to use those they have to the utmost, no matter how great or meager they might be, and to use them in the service of others. The point is simply this: God is responsible for what talents you possess. From there on, the responsibility is yours. You have to develop them as far and as deeply as they will go. And the people who use their talents completely — and most of all to help others less fortunate— will be rewarded. Those people will find success. At least ninety-nine people out of a hundred are born into the world with talents that can be developed. Most of us are given more talents than we realize, and it's up to us to mine those at which weTl be best. Also, in developing your own talents, you should help other people develop theirs. The great ministry is not to build yourself into a model but to help others discover and develop their abilities, to help yourself by helping them. Sometimes\n\nHelping Yourself by Helping Others\n\nI\n\n21\n\npeople don't know their own worth and need praise and encouragement. An illustration of this is the story about a priest named Bourne, counseling an unhappy man who claimed to have no talents. The priest disputed him. He said, \"As long as you are able to speak to me, you are not one of those people. Anyone who can carry on a conversation has been given a talent. Suppose your talent is to keep a street clean. Supyour that chiefstreet. qualification go ahead pose andthat'sclean Clean it in withlife.loveSo and care to make others happy as they walk on it. Then, as your talent for cleaning that street grows, it should become a famous street/' When he first heard this story, Templeton thought of the street as Bourne Street, after the priest who encouraged the man. He says that if he were given that one talent, he would have tourists coming from hundreds of miles around to marvel at his clean street, and in its glory it would be renamed Bourne. Success takes many forms; wealth and fame are only one kind of success. Perhaps you have a talent to help those who have no talents. There are such people. For example, the severely brain-damaged are unable to develop talents; taking care of them can help us to grow by helping them to function. The aged and infirm, the mentally and physically handicapped, those beyond hope and caught in the coils of mental disease — they are the people who teach us the meaning of spiritual principles. John Templeton knows a Christian minister who was awarded grants from the federal government to maintain a home for sixteen severely mentally retarded people. Through his efforts, all sixteen have\n\n22\n\nI\n\nStep 3\n\ndeveloped at least minimal abilities: Some wait on tables and carry out garbage, others plant vegetables and mow lawns. That Christian minister may not have large bank accounts and a Rolls Royce. Nonetheless, he is among the richest and most successful of men. Every act of helping is a way of saying yes to life. And saying yes is a profound form of successful behavior and happiness. Step 3 suggests the following course of action: 1 . Explore your talents carefully; choose your career with care; make certain you love what you do. 2. Share your talents in ways that truly benefit others, particularly the less fortunate. 3. Develop an attitude of greatness by applying the \" Bourne\" principle. 4. Share your greatness, as described in the \"Bourne\" example, with others. Ask yourself these two key questions: • Am I doing the thing that I am best qualified to do? • Is my work helping me by helping at least one other human being?\n\nStep 4\n\nPutting First Things First i\\\\\\ of us believe in virtue, but few of us give much thought to the varieties of virtue that exist and to their relative spiritual weights. One of the best methods for examining virtues is to try to decide in your own mind which virtues you think are the most important. Draw up a list of them. What virtue would you put first? In what order would you assign their importance? No two people will compile the same list, but the effort of preparing it will help you clarify your thinking. All of us have been taught that crime does not pay and, of course, it's true. Crime of any kind is a sin and leads to failure. The virtues provide the underpinning for success in life, both in business and spiritually. Study the virtues. Start family discussions around the dining room table, having each member draw up his or her list of virtues. This can also be done in college classrooms, or at church prayer meetings, or wherever people gather socially. Encourage others to draw up their own list of virtues in order of importance. There is no surer way of growing spiritually than to discuss and study priorities in the field of virtues.\n\n24\n\nI\n\nStep 4\n\nThe purpose of The Templeton Plan is to help people become successful in the full sense of that word. No matter what career you might embark on, success comes from knowing the importance of the virtues. It is not enough to live them unconsciously; you must struggle to know them and live them consciously. Each person will have a different list of virtues, with different priorities. It will be helpful to discuss virtues with people who have viewpoints different from yours. By exchanging viewpoints on virtues, everyone can grow more open-minded and productive. Here is the start of a list, which you can add to and change as you produce your own: gentleness, humility, self-control, hopefulness, perseverance, enthusiasm, responsibility, farsightedness, unselfishness, honor, hard work, generosity, promptness, thrift, originality, judgment, calmness, loyalty, forgiveness, thanksgiving, common sense, honesty, bravery, and love. This is by no means a complete list. But it's a beginning. We all learn by setting down our own priorities in virtues. John Templeton discussed the priority of virtues with an acquaintance who placed labor at the top of her list. That told him a lot about the woman. It also made him consider labor in the vast scheme of virtues. Another friend of Templeton's ranked loyalty first on his list. Templeton asked him for an example of what he meant by loyalty. His friend explained that he could think of nothing more beautiful than a married couple celebrating their golden wedding anniversary— two people having lived fifty years of\n\nPutting First Things First\n\nI 25\n\ntheir life together. This example was at the root of his concept of loyalty. Still another friend of Templeton's, Royal Little, a successful businessman now in his nineties, assigns great importance to the virtue of modesty. He believes that a man must be willing to admit his mistakes and deflate his own balloon before he can call himself truly successful. Little actually wrote a book called How to Lose a Hundred Million Dollars and Other Valuable Advice. Here is a member of the Business Hall of Fame; a man who built a great corporation called Textron and later a company called Narragansett Capital; a man who is widely regarded as the originator of the conglomerate — a man famous in his field. And yet what is the subject of his book? He writes of his mistakes and of what he tried to learn from his mistakes. When discussing the book with Templeton, he said that many of his friends had written books detailing all the things they had done right, but he thought it would be much more helpful to the public to read about his various disasters. So he assembled forty different mistakes he had made in his career and explained to the reader what he had learned from each mistake. Thus the importance of modesty as a virtue. Through the example of this multimillionaire businessman we have a much clearer sense of what modesty can actually mean in practice and how, like all of the virtues, it can promote success. John Templeton himself, in fact, wrote a book entitled The Humble Approach. Templeton has been a sharp observer of people all his life. During the thirty-seven years since he\n\n26\n\nI\n\nStep 4\n\nhelped form the Young Presidents' Organization, whose members were leaders in their fields, he watched these people carefully and studied their virtues. He believes that the virtues most visible among them were responsibility, energy, hard work, enthusiasm, and perseverance. Although he does not necessarily assign them the highest rank among the virtues, he is convinced they are significantly present in almost every prime candidate for success. To successfully complete Step 4, try to answer the following questions: 1. List all the virtues that have special meaning for you. 2. Rank them in order of importance in your life. 3. Think of examples where you have been able to put various virtues into practice. 4. Discuss virtues with family members, business associates, and friends. They may provide you with insights into the virtues you need to practice to lead a happy and successful life.\n\nStep 5\n\nAchieving Happiness by What You Do J ohn Templeton is fond of quoting financier Charles H. Burr, who said: \"Getters don't get happiness; givers get it. You simply give to others a bit of yourself — a thoughtful act, a helpful idea, a word of appreciation, a lift over a rough spot, a sense of understanding, a timely suggestion. You take something out of your mind, garnished in kindness out of your heart, and put it into the other fellow's mind and heart.\" And the world-famous philosopher and physician, Dr. Albert Schweitzer: \"I don't know what your destiny will be, but one thing I know: The only ones among you who will be really happy are those who will have sought and found how to serve.\" And Henry Ward Beecher, the religious leader and social reformer: \"No man can tell whether he is rich or poor by turning to his ledger. It is the heart that makes a man rich. He is rich according to what he is, not according to what he has.\" And the author Sidney Powell: \"Try to forget yourself in the service of others. For when we think too much of ourselves and our own interests, we easily become dependent.\" Hugh Black, who was for thirty years professor\n\n28\n\nI\n\nStep 5\n\nof practical theology at the Union Theological Seminary in New York: \"It is the paradox of life that the way to miss pleasure is to seek it first. The very first condition of lasting happiness is that a life should be full of purpose, aiming at something outside self. As a matter of experience, we find that true happiness comes in seeking other things, in the manifold activities of life, in the healthful outgoing of all human powers.\" And, lastly, Robert J. McCracken, then pastor of New York City's Riverside Church: \"The most infectiously joyous men and women are those who forget themselves in thinking about others and serving others. Happiness comes not by deliberately courting and wooing it but by giving oneself in selfeffacing surrender to great values.\" The American Declaration of Independence states that the pursuit of happiness is an inalienable right, but the pursuit of happiness is never successful. The more you pursue it, the less it will be achieved, and the less your success will be assured. The way to capture happiness is to try to do something not directly aimed at giving you pleasure. Then happiness will come to you. If you develop your talents and become excellent at a particular line of work, you will realize happiness and success. Happiness and success are awarded to those who do not seek them as ends in themselves but struggle to excel at a given task. If you try to help someone else achieve happiness, happiness will come to you. We have all heard people say, \"Oh, if only I had an extra ten thousand dollars, I'd be really happy.\" But those are the very people who remain dissatisfied when they get an additional ten thousand dollars.\n\nAchieving Happiness by What You Do\n\nI 29\n\nIf they had a million dollars more, they would not be happy, nor would they be successful. Happiness is never the completion — the getting. Happiness comes from the work, the endeavor, the pursuit of a goal — the giving. Production, not consumption, isat the core of happiness and success. If you can see progress in your work, then you will know happiness in that very process. Process is production, and production is giving. As Templeton is fond of saying, \"Happiness pursued eludes, happiness given returns. \" One way to understand happiness is to study happy people. Think of those you know or see who radiate happiness. What is the source of their joy? What lessons can you learn from them? Templeton saw true happiness in the novices in Mother Teresa's order as they dedicated their lives to Jesus. As an investment counselor, he has considered it his business to closely observe his clients. Who is happy? Who is not? And what makes the happy ones happy? His richest clients, he has come to realize, are not necessarily his happiest clients. He sees no clear correlation between wealth and happiness. It is not money alone that makes people happy. In gambling casinos, you rarely see anyone smiling, even those who have beaten the odds and are standing behind stacks of chips. In fact, a sure system for understanding wnhappiness is to assume the attitude of the gamblers in the casino. They have made the accumulation of money an end in itself, related to nothing but the turn of a card, the roll of the dice. If you do this, soon your own face will reflect the gambler's anxiety,\n\n30\n\nI\n\nStep 5\n\nunhappiness, and selfishness — even when beating the odds and winning large sums of money. When you meet someone, always ask yourself this question: What makes him or her special? Look for the glow that person gives off, because everyone has a glow. There is a tendency to see only the faults in others. Obviously, all of us have personalities that are a mixture of good and bad elements, but if you form a habit of looking for the bad, then that's all you will see. If, instead, you train yourself to look for the good, you will find it. Seek out the good and your mind will fill with happiness. And happiness, being one of the purest forms of strength, is crucial to success. Pleasing others is an avenue to happiness. If you please others, you please yourself. Early in his career, John Templeton learned that each client had to be treated differently. He worked diligently to answer the special wishes and needs and to solve the tax problems of each client. He asked a lot of questions; he listened carefully — he pleased. By pleasing others, he helped to fulfill himself. Today, John Templeton has few individual clients; those individual accounts he does accept invest a minimum of $10 million. Yet another success and happiness strategy is never to argue unless a useful purpose can be served. Too often, we are ruled by our emotions. We start an argument without stopping to think of the consequences; nothing is achieved in the end except a mutual feeling of ill will. The proper tactic is to remain silent until you have determined that the disagreement will have positive results that can't be arrived at through reason and quiet discourse.\n\nAchieving Happiness by What You Do\n\nI 31\n\nOnce involved in debate, it is vital that you know your facts. Your argument should proceed from facts, not emotion. If you're well prepared, it's possible to disagree with someone in a way that is convincing and helpful to that person. Templeton has sat in many board meetings, involving both large and small corporations, and he has carefully observed how directors behave in those settings. The successful directors (and the ones who run the most profitable companies) tend to be thoughtful and long-range in their thinking. When they raise a prickly issue, they will have the facts; they can prove why their way would bring better results. Poor leaders, on the other hand, will sometimes prove to be wrong after they have already lodged a complaint or an objection. Know your facts. Speak only after you have thought. And hold your fire. There are psychologists today who believe that anger can play a positive role in our dealings with others. Experience with successful people, however, has convinced John Templeton that anger is a retrograde emotion that should be banished from our lives. It is not an intellectual pursuit. Basically, it unleashes destructive forces that cripple communication. Successful people think in terms of respect for others, not anger toward others. They reach out for accommodation rather than confrontation. You should say to yourself, \"Those people are doing what they believe is right. I don't have to agree with them, but there has to be a reason for their actions.\" Perhaps they recently received bad news. They may not be feeling well. The proper action is to answer their anger with love and logic.\n\n32\n\nI\n\nStep 5\n\nMake them happy, not angry. Anger hurts no one more than the person entertaining it. It is a negative emotion that leads to unproductivity. Jesus says, in the Gospel according to Saint Matthew (7:1-5): \"Judge not, that you be not judged. For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and the measure you give will be the measure you get. Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? Or how can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye/ when there is the log in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye/' John Templeton believes strongly that people should not take others to court. He is in favor of settling problems short of litigation. The speck is in your neighbor's eye, the log is in yours, and two civilized people should be able to arrive at a peaceable solution. Templeton says, \"One of the things I have most pride in in my life is that I never sued anybody for anything, even though I've been the chief executive of literally dozens of corporations, including a group with as many as five hundred thousand shareholders. Nor have I, or any company controlled by me, ever been sued in my seventy-four years. I think that's a wonderful thing to try to achieve. In a way, it's a form of happiness. \"When I was a student at Yale, Professor Glenn Saxon, who taught industrial engineering, said we should try to solve problems by what he called integration. Byintegration he meant trying to understand the basic prevailing forces on both sides, rather\n\nAchieving Happiness by What You Do\n\nI 33\n\nthan resorting to argument and name calling. If you can decipher those forces, you have a better chance of arriving at a solution that everyone can live with. \"You search for the underlying long-range motives on both sides and try to integrate them so that both parties can start working in the same direction.\" We also achieve happiness by remaining active. Many people think of retirement as a blank page: nothing to do but sit around all day and be lazy. But if you want happiness, you must always have some project that you're working on. It's all right to end one career, providing that you have structured activities to fill the empty spaces. No matter what age you are — even if you're eighty, if you're ninety — you must continue to cultivate your talents. Retirement works only if people plan carefully for it. It is good to set new goals for yourself, realistic goals. Often, if we think the future out in detail, the work we do after retirement can be more rewarding than the work we did all those years for a salary. There are people who feel they're so old that they can no longer have useful goals. But that is rarely the case. For instance, if you are still able to write, you have a number of possible options. You can correspond with lonely people. You can work on your autobiography: We all have our own story to tell and no two stories are ever the same. You can write poems or short stories or novels and try to have them published. John Templeton cites an example of how happiness and success can be achieved by the elderly. He had a roommate at Yale, John Bradley Greene, whose grandmother, Mrs. Talbot, was a wealthy woman.\n\n34\n\nI\n\nStep 5\n\nShe played no role in the business from which she drew a considerable income and could have simply done nothing. Instead, she undertook to help her children, grandchildren, and friends by seeking out inspirational articles, and once a year she would compile a calendar of 365 passages, one for each day of the year. Those people to whom she gave the calendar were uplifted by that day's inspiration. Her grandson at Yale shared those inspirations with young Templeton, who benefited from them in his life as an undergraduate, just as his friend's grandmother benefited by focusing her mind on a helpful and happy activity. Perhaps Mother Teresa of Calcutta epitomizes better than anyone the concept that happiness can be achieved by what you do. She believes in showing love first to those who are near to you, those who cross your path every day. And that means even the panhandlers on the streets of American cities, even those who may use your money to buy a drink or drugs. Mother Teresa explains, \"Whenever we give, we give to Jesus. He has identified himself with the hungry, the naked, and the homeless to make it possible for us to love God. After all, how can we love God if not through others? Jesus has given us an opportunity to love God in action — through these poor who approach us for money in our cities, these poor to whom we already owe deep gratitude for accepting our services.\" But what if a panhandler really does use his contribution to buy a drink or help pay for drugs? \"I tell our sisters that I'd rather we made mistakes in kindness than work miracles in unkindness,\" she\n\nAchieving Happiness by What You Do\n\nI 35\n\nanswers. \"Maybe that man will buy a drink. Maybe he'll buy drugs. But then too, he may buy a piece of bread or pay for medicine for his child. We don't know. So I'd rather make a mistake than not to give at all. If someone approached me for something, I would always give it.\" As John Templeton's spiritual sensitivities increased through the 1960s and early 1970s, he began to search for some significant, concrete way to spread the love and knowledge of God. The result was the Templeton Foundation Prize for Progress in Religion.* It is annually awarded to an individual who has made a significant advance in any religion. Now valued at over $300,000, it is the largest annual award given for any purpose. The prize is a direct reflection of the personal values and religious views of Templeton himself. He decided it should be larger than any other prize in order to tell the world that progress in religion is more crucial than progress in any other area of life. About 1970, Templeton talked with the British Governor-General of the Bahama Islands, Lord Thurlow, about the possibility of the queen of England awarding the Templeton Prizes just as the king of Sweden awards the Nobel Prizes. Lord Thurlow introduced Templeton to his friend, the Right Reverend Sir Robin Woods, Dean of Windsor. Sir Robin accepted Templeton's invitation to serve for three years on the original board of nine judges from all five major religions. He then talked with Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, who agreed to present the first award, to Mother Teresa of 'See Appendix A.\n\n36\n\nI\n\nStep 5\n\nCalcutta, before an audience of eight hundred select guests in London's Guildhall. In fourteen subsequent years, the Templeton Foundation has invited Prince Philip to make the presentation and he has graciously accepted these invitations making the work of each prizewinner more widely known throughout the world. When Mother Teresa traveled to London to receive the first Templeton Prize, reporters asked her why her nuns maintained a home there. They understood her need to remain near the destitute and dying in India, but what could she possibly accomplish in England's largest city, one of the main cradles of contemporary civilization? She answered that her London house was one of her most important ones. She said that in London, as in all great cities, large numbers of people were starving and their condition was more serious than starvation from lack of food. They were starving spiritually. She explained that spiritual starvation was endemic among the wealthy, among those with an abundance of worldly possessions, and that her order's presence in London was meant to help such unfortunates. There is a lesson to be learned from Mother Teresa about the true meaning of starvation. One of its dictionary definitions is \"to be deprived ment.\" Ifwe are without goals, without out an experience and appreciation of then we cannot hope to find happiness. elude us.\n\nof nourishGod, withour talents, Success will\n\nAfter reading Step 5, ask yourself the following questions:\n\nAchieving Happiness by What You Do\n\nI 37\n\n1 . Are you happier when you give a present than when you receive one? 2. Do you derive the most pleasure from activities that are geared to helping others or that add to their knowledge or pleasure? 3. Do you find that more differences are settled amicably through gentle persuasion than through angry confrontation? 4. Are you continually setting new goals for yourself? 5. Do you try to remain active throughout the day by pursuing a worthwhile activity? If you have answered these questions in the affirmative, you are ready to proceed to Step 6.\n\nStep 6\n\nFinding the Positive in Every Negative x\\ hit song written by Johnny Mercer during the Second World War contained the words \"accentuate the positive, eliminate the negative. ...\" For John Templeton they express one of his deepest beliefs: that you must be a positive person to succeed in life. Over the years he has compiled a list of quotations dealing with positive behavior, some of which might help those who tend to take the dark view. Horace Rutledge, author of religious tracts, had this in a look you you\n\nobservation: \"When you look at the world narrow way, how narrow it seems! When you at it in a mean way, how mean it is! When look at it selfishly, how selfish it is! But when look at it in a broad, generous, friendly spirit,\n\nwhat wonderful people you find in it.\" Lydia Maria Child, abolitionist and nineteenthcentury author: \"You find yourself refreshed by the presence of cheerful people. Why not make an earnest effort to confer that pleasure on others? Half the battle is gained if you never allow yourself to say anything gloomy.\" Famous nineteenth-century English novelist George Eliot had this to say on the subject: \"Wear\n\nFinding the Positive in Every Negative\n\nI 39\n\na smile and have friends; wear a scowl and have wrinkles. What do we live for if not to make the world less difficult for each other?\" French philosopher and mathematician Blaise Pascal put it this way: \"Kind words do not cost much. They never blister the tongue or lips. Mental trouble was never known to arise from such quarters. Though they do not cost much yet they accomplish much. They make other people good-natured. They also produce their own image on men's souls, and a beautiful image it is.\" Author J. Kenfield Morley put his views on a positive versus a negative viewpoint in the form of an aphorism: \"I can complain because rosebushes have thorns or rejoice because thornbushes have roses. It's all how you look at it.\" \"A pessimist,\" said Reginald B. Mansell, a business executive, \"is one who makes difficulties of his opportunities; an optimist is one who makes opportunities ofhis difficulties.\" And, lastly, William Makepeace Thackeray, the author of Vanity Fair: \"The world is a looking glass and gives back to every man the reflection of his own face. Frown at it and it will in turn look sourly upon you; laugh at it and with it and it is a jolly, kind companion.\" Success depends to a very large extent upon enthusiasm. The Greek origin of the word enthusiasm means \"in God.\" Therefore, the enthusiastic person is in tune with the infinite, with God himself. Jesus said (Matt. 7:15-20): \"Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. You will know them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thorns, or\n\n40\n\nI\n\nStep 6\n\nfigs from thistles? So every sound tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears evil fruit. A sound tree cannot bear evil fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus you will know them by their fruits/' In business or socially or within your family, you will be known by your fruits. Love and joy — both positive emotions — are among the sweetest fruits of the spirit. God is the source of all love, and by tapping the divine source, you will radiate love and attract it at the same time. You often come across people who say, \"I can't find love anywhere/' The reason they can't find love is that they don't give love. If you forget about trying to acquire love as though it's a material object that you can touch, and, instead, concentrate on giving it, then love automatically comes your way. We must train ourselves to genuinely and deeply love every person; we will then, in return, be people who are magnets for love. Remember: The ability to love without stint or qualification is a form of happiness. Happiness breeds success. And successful people are free to love. God is an infinite source of love, and there is no limit to the amount of love you can get and give. All of God's love is ready to flow through you if you don't block it. Think of yourself as a water faucet. If the faucet is on full, the water will flow through from the source and be a blessing to the person who drinks it or to the garden or flowers that need it. But if the faucet is turned off, no water flows and nothing grows.\n\nFinding the Positive in Every Negative\n\nI 41\n\nThere are those who think that smiling is facile and insincere. But you will discover that when you smile at someone who doesn't often show happiness, that person will immediately brighten. They have been waiting for the brightness that you shine on them, and they are ready to respond. Your face is a mirror that reflects happiness back onto others. Another way to accentuate the positive is to welcome change each day. It is human nature to get stuck in a rut and resist innovation, but you must teach yourself to try new paths. Don't let a day go by without learning something new. The successful life is an adventurous one. When John Templeton goes to restaurants with clients in connection with his investment counseling work, he makes it a point to order one item on the menu that he's never tried before. That way he assures himself that the day will not be like any other day; he assures himself of an adventure, a seminar in living, no matter how small. A successful life depends less on how long you live than on how much you can pack into the time you have. If you can find a way to make every day an adventure — even if it's only a matter of walking down an unfamiliar street or ordering an untried cut of meat — you will find that your life becomes more productive, richer, and more interesting. You also become more interesting to others. The same rule applies to travel. For example, make it your objective to visit all fifty states in the Union and at least a dozen other nations. You will thus have a positive goal worth pursuing and, as you begin to fulfill your goal, a sense of accomplishment. You will also begin to develop a world\n\n42\n\nI\n\nStep 6\n\nview that will contribute to building a successful career. So far, in his seventy-four years, John Templeton has visited forty-nine of the fifty states of the U.S. and seventy-seven nations in the world. He feels that extensive travel has enabled him to have viewpoints not obtainable to those who stay at home; he has also discovered wonderful new opportunities for investments. To reach out, to try the new, is to accentuate the positive. The successful person never stops reaching and trying. When Templeton first became an investment counsellor after college, he had a friend, Harry J. Haas, a banker in Philadelphia. Haas formed a habit of making friends with other bankers whom he met at conventions and bankers' associations. He would write their names on individual cards and file them in his desk drawer. Subsequently, he would keep a sharp eye out for a photograph or any news item relating to them — a promotion mentioned in the business section of any newspaper, a recent entry in Who's Who, a social event — and whenever he found something, he would clip it out and attach it to the card. He collected cards on thousands of bankers, and he never failed to drop someone a line of congratulations on good news or commiseration if the news were bad. As a result, Haas, who through his thoughtfulness had made thousands of friends, later in life became president of the American Bankers' Association. Men like Haas are uplifting forces in the lives of many. They make an extra effort to find the positive in every negative. Their genuine interest in others translates into substantial success.\n\nFinding the Positive in Every Negative\n\nI 43\n\nJohn Templeton believes that we all have within us a deep reservoir of faith, but it often lies buried and unused. To bring it out takes training. You can teach yourself to talk to another person and glimpse that person's true faith. Every person has it, and if you can find it, you will be able to genuinely express friendship, love, and joy — three great aids to becoming a successful and productive person. If you meet someone at a party or in business about whom you can't find anything positive to say, it is best to say nothing. But if you can find something good to say, don't keep it to yourself. Pass on the good news to the person most eager to hear it — namely, that person. If, for example, someone has remarkably clear eyes, eyes that illuminate a room, compliment his eyes. If he has a soft and musical voice, tell him how pleasant it sounds. Whatever you find admirable about a person, let it be known. The telling also benefits the teller because the habit is established of expressing useful and constructive thoughts. The telling builds friendships. You have found the positive in the negative. John Templeton gives an example from his own life of how positive behavior can draw family members together in a tighter, more loving bond. He says: \"When my second wife, Irene, and I were first married, I had three young children and she had two. We wanted them to be friends, to feel like one family. So we decided to take them on an eightweek trip through Europe. That way, they would be together constantly, twenty-four hours a day. \"We found that we couldn't get all five children and us and our luggage in an automobile, and we realized that we'd have to buy a bus in Europe. So we invited three of my brother's children along for\n\n44\n\nI\n\nStep 6\n\nthe eight weeks, making ten of us, eight children and two adults. \"Now, like many children, they wanted to have their own way about things. Right at the start, we made a crucial decision. We said, This is your trip. You're in charge/ \"In order to avoid any conflict, each child was given a particular responsibility and made the decisions in that area. The oldest girl was in charge of the money. The next oldest had to decide which cities we would visit and the hotels at which we would stay. Another was in charge of everything to do with eating. Another was responsible for the bus. One was in charge of photography. Another was the trip historian. Every second day, she would write about the most interesting thing that had happened to the group. We would then send her notes back to my secretary who typed them out, mimeographed them, and gave them to our friends as letters. \"The point is that we gave the children the authority. We gave ourselves only the hardest job, which was to keep our mouths shut when the young people made the inevitable hundreds of childish mistakes. \"Our duty was to get up each morning, pack our one bag each, sit down on the backseat of the bus, and then wait for the children to pay the hotel, tip everybody, and decide where to go next. And to keep our mouths firmly closed. \"The only serious mistake made all summer was not made by any of the children but by me. At the beginning of the trip, I handed out the cash for the first week to the girl in charge — all of it, rather than a portion — and it was more money than any of the eight children had ever seen before. They were over-\n\nFinding the Positive in Every Negative\n\nI 45\n\nwhelmed by it and determined to manage it wisely so there would be plenty of money left over. I said they could divide any surplus among them, but there I made my mistake. They took such an interest in saving that they didn't want us to have a hotel room with a bath — too expensive. They were suddenly opposed to restaurants. They wanted us to buy food in grocery stores and eat on the bus. \"My son in charge of hotels, age seventeen, was the only one of the eight children who had been in Europe before, and he decided we wouldn't need any advance reservations. It happened to be the busiest tourist summer Europe had ever had up to that time, and here were ten of us in a bus with no reservations. We would drive into a town at about five o'clock in the afternoon and we'd say to my son, 'We're going to have tea while you find us a place to stay.' \"Surprisingly enough, he managed to find us a place to sleep every single night. Not always deluxe, but something. In Yugoslavia we slept on cots in a high school auditorium, and in Frankfurt he came up with a restored bomb shelter with no windows. \"Like most children, the eight of them were prone to a certain amount of grumbling and squabbling. And there was one younger child in particular whose life was mainly one constant grumble. At the start of the trip we said to him, 'Your job is to police the attitudes of the others. If anybody says anything unpleasant, they must remain silent until they've found two happy things to say.' \"It worked like a charm. Not only did he conscientiously get on the others but, because he was the\n\n46\n\nI\n\nStep 6\n\ndesignated enforcer, he converted himself. The lively and warm side of his personality came out.\" If complaints are invidious, so are comparisons, particularly comparisons between people. Almost every comparison is negative by its very nature. Rid yourself of the habit of saying, \"This girl is prettier than that girl,\" or even \"I like oranges better than apples.\" However they may be framed, comparisons have a negative aspect to them and are often harmful. The successful person learns to avoid comparisons of all types. Instead, learn to say, \"What a pretty girl!\" or \"I like oranges very much.\" The same ideas can be expressed without the use of comparisons. John Templeton gives a dramatic example of how he learned this lesson: \"As a young man I attended a house party. There was a girl there who wanted to know me better, and the host of the party had her listening in on our conversation while he asked me questions about her. I dealt in comparisons; I was carelessly negative, more than I meant to be. When later I discovered that she'd listened in, I was mortified. I was only trying to be honest and answer my friend truthfully, but I learned my lesson. Always talk as though the subject under discussion is an invisible presence who can see your expressions and hear every word you say. Then you'll be careful and scrupulous in your judgments. That's the kind of behavior that makes a successful person.\" Gossip is another vice shunned by the successbound person bent on finding the positive in the negative. Most gossip is adverse information, usually riddled with exaggeration and falsity. The individual who hopes to be successful, to be admired\n\nFinding the Positive in Every Negative\n\nI 47\n\nand popular in business, should work hard to avoid gossip. The ability to speak well of others, without comparisons, and to avoid gossip are positive approaches to life. Most circumstances can be interpreted in two ways; it all depends on your point of view. When two people look at a given situation, one can take a positive posture, the other a negative one. There is the famous illustration of two people studying a glass of water. One says that it is half empty. To the other, it is half full. We can train ourselves to look up rather than down — by finding the positive in the negative, by viewing the glass as half full. Two guaranteed methods for approaching that happy state are to shun comparisons and avoid gossip in your relations with others. John Templeton also recommends that you devote part of your reading time to material of an inspirational nature. Guideposts, a magazine with over three million subscribers, dedicates itself to uplifting stories. It forges a clear connection between business success and a life of inspiration. Templeton recommends Norman Vincent Peale's books on the power of positive thinking; the television programs and books by Robert Schuller, featuring his method called Possibility Thinking; and the Reader's Digest. As Templeton points out, the inspirational movement is one of America's greatest success stories. Reader's Digest has become the most widely read magazine in the world, with the largest circulation, and has accomplished this without articles dealing with sensationalism, degradation, and violence. Reading inspirational material can be an essential item in your success portfolio.\n\n48\n\nI\n\nStep 6\n\nThe motto of the Christophers, a Roman Catholic organization of hundreds of thousands of people, is that \"it is better to light one candle than to curse the darkness/7 If you live by that precept, you will be following the steps to success. Light a candle in the darkness that will illuminate your life and the lives of those around you, and that very light will lead you to your goal. To summarize Step 6, anything that can be formulated inpositive terms will lead to harmony among people and productive change. Through practice, you can almost always find the positive in any situation. Below are listed areas for further study: 1. When you start to analyze the character of person B while talking to person A, stop yourself. Resist the impulse. It is gossip, and gossip is a negative force that leads away from success and happiness. 2. Avoid comparisons. They have a way of making negatives out of positives. 3. Be sure that your life is a seminar in living. You can achieve this by learning something new each day, no matter how small; by reaching out to others; by never passing up an opportunity for a new experience that will enlarge your knowledge; and by traveling as much as possible so that you can see new places and meet new people from different backgrounds. 4. Read literature that inspires you. Inspiration is a core characteristic of the positive personality.\n\nStep 7\n\nInvesting Yourself in \"T Your Work boy.\n\nI'll buy two Roman candles!\" said one\n\n\"Give me a pinwheel!\" cried another. \"Three firecrackers for me!\" demanded yet another. Money was changing hands so fast that you might think an experienced adult entrepreneur was hawking fireworks for the Fourth of July. But such was not the case. John Templeton, at the age of eight, was the salesman who had found the market and was busily raking in the profits. Even in those early days in his hometown of Winchester, Tennessee, he was beginning to make his mark in the world of business. And one of the most striking personal characteristics he displayed, while only a child, was the ability to formulate an idea, plan ahead carefully, and then invest himself totally in the work at hand. How did hard work pay off for him at such a tender age? Because there was no fireworks store in Winchester, there was a vacuum in the market and, hence, an opportunity for him. He did some research\n\n50\n\nI Step 7\n\nto see how he could buy quantities of fireworks at cut-rate prices and then sell them at a profit to his classmates. Through diligent detective work, he discovered a mail-order outlet in Ohio, and about a month before the holiday, he was ordering various kinds of fireworks from Cincinnati — Roman candles, pinwheels, sparklers. You name, it, he had it. Then, just before the Fourth, he would pack up his wares into his schoolbag, run off to class, and sell them to the other children at a healthy markup in price. Young John Templeton had learned one of the cardinal success secrets at a tender age: the importance of hard work. In his long life, he has never stopped working hard, and he has never regretted a single moment of it. Through his extensive reading, Templeton has compiled a number of quotations on the value of hard work and how hard work leads to success. Here are some of his favorites: Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes believed in \"work, hard work, and long hours of work. Men do not break down from overwork, but from worry and dissipation/7 The advice of Harlow Herbert Curtice, an automobile manufacturer, was to \"do your job better each time. Do it better than anyone else can do it. Do it better than it needs to be done. Let no one or anything stand between you and the difficult task. I know this sounds old-fashioned. It is, but it has built the world.\" Grenville Kleiser wrote some of the earliest successful \"how-to\" books. He believed that \"there is honor in labor. Work is the medicine of the soul. It\n\nInvesting Yourself in Your Work\n\nI 51\n\nis more: It is your very life, without which you would amount to little/' William Feather, publisher and author, said: \"The prizes go to those who meet emergencies successfully. And the way to meet emergencies is to do each daily task the best we can; to act as though the eye of opportunity were always upon us. In the hundred-yard race the winner doesn't cross the tape line a dozen strides ahead of the field. He wins by inches. So we find it in ordinary business life. The big things that come our way are seldom the result of long thought or careful planning, but rather they are the fruit of seed planted in the daily routine of our work.\" For Sir Theodore Martin, the nineteenth-century Scottish biographer: \"Work is the true elixir of life. The busiest man is the happiest man. Excellence in any art or profession is attained only by hard and persistent work. Never believe that you are perfect. When a man imagines, even after years of striving, that he has attained perfection, his decline begins.\" In the opinion of Thomas Carlyle, the Scottish essayist and historian: \"The glory of a workman, still more of a master workman, that he does his work well, ought to be his most precious possession; like the honor of a soldier, dearer to him than life.\" Henry Ford, the automotive great, believed that \"nobody can think straight who does not work. Idleness warps the mind. Thinking without constructive action becomes a disease.\" Author Jacob Korsaren gave this advice: \"If you are poor, work. If you are burdened with seemingly\n\n52\n\nI\n\nStep 7\n\nunfair responsibilities, work. If you are happy, work. Idleness gives room for doubts and fear. If disappointments come, keep right on working. If sorrow overwhelms you and loved ones seem not true, work. If health is threatened, work. When faith falters and reason fails, just work. When dreams are shattered and hope seems dead, work. Work as if your life were in peril. It really is. No matter what ails you, work. Work faithfully — work with faith. Work is the greatest remedy available for both mental and physical afflictions. \" The English statesman and man of letters, Lord Chesterfield, said: \"It is an undoubted truth that the less one has to do, the less time one finds to do it in. One yawns, one procrastinates, one can do it when one will, and, therefore, one seldom does it at all; whereas, those who have a great deal of business must buckle to it; and then they always find time enough to do it/' Psychiatrist W. Beran Wolfe put it this way: \"If you observe a really happy man, you will find him building a boat, writing a symphony, educating his son, growing double dahlias, or looking for dinosaur eggs in the Gobi desert. He will not be searching for happiness as if it were a collar button that had rolled under the radiator, striving for it as the goal itself. He will have become aware that he is happy in the course of living life twenty-four crowded hours of each day.\" Former President Calvin Coolidge was certain that \"all growth depends upon activity. There is no development physically or intellectually without effort, and effort means work. Work is not a curse; it is the prerogative of intelligence, the only means to manhood, and the measure of civilization.\"\n\nInvesting Yourself in Your Work\n\nI 53\n\nAnd perhaps the Greek playwright Antiphanes summed it all up when he said: \"Everything yields to diligence.\" Very few of us work as hard as we can. We think we work hard. But in fact nine out of ten people waste more time than they use. The successful person learns to avoid wasting precious moments. It is helpful to carry with you reading material that is necessary in your career. Then, when you have a few minutes between appointments or while riding on a bus or train, you can absorb a page or two, or an entire article. Thus you've used your time fruitfully. Whenever possible, carry a tape recorder with you in your briefcase. You will find that you can jot down ideas and dictate letters, accomplishing something in what might otherwise be wasted time. Career success depends on such tactics. If you can learn to use all that time that would otherwise be wasted, you are learning the meaning of hard work. Forty years ago, when John Templeton was first calling on investment counseling clients, he trained himself to arrive early for appointments. He set his watch ten minutes fast (he does to this day) so that he would be likely to be ahead of schedule at all times. While waiting for his appointment, he would spend those extra ten minutes reading. Another way to save time is to think two thoughts at once, a trick that Templeton has mastered. He has found that it's possible while, say, giving a lecture to be thinking also of what you're going to do the next day. Our time is limited, and it's helpful to think along one channel while functioning on another. As strange as it may seem, you will make fewer mistakes by distributing your thoughts over a wide\n\n54\n\nI Step 7\n\nrange of consciousness and you will accomplish more. For example, if you're carrying on a conversation, analyze at the same time what your objective is in carrying on that particular conversation. Is it to produce abook or a paper? Is it to persuade someone? Is it to convey new ideas or to sharpen your own viewpoint through discussion? Think while you talk. It takes long practice to train yourself to concentrate on a subject that you're not discussing or doing or reading about, but the payoff is that you can extend each workday by packing more substance into it. Those who learn the secret of hard work will find success; the winning of awards and scholarships will point you in the right direction. The awards needn't be major; they can be ribbons awarded for winning a spelling bee or a swimming meet in school. But big or small, it pays to set yourself the task of winning an award because it trains you to work harder. Once you win something, you're all the more motivated to win something else. We live in a credit economy and an advertising culture that advises us to buy now and pay later. At best, this is a dubious proposition. The underlying philosophy — a dangerous one — is that we accept gratification before we've earned it. Although it goes against the grain of our current \"live for the moment\" orientation, children should be taught to \"study first and play later.\" If children do their homework in school or as soon as they get home, they will begin to build a reputation as students who know the meaning of responsibility and hard work. They will please their teachers, their parents, and themselves. They will make the honor roll and\n\nInvesting Yourself in Your Work\n\nI 55\n\nwin scholarships. They will truly enjoy their leisure time because they will have earned it. Those children will already be on the fast track to success because they will have learned the first key lesson: Defer pleasure until the job is done. When John Templeton worked for an oil company in Dallas, his first important position, he watched to see what time his boss arrived and left each day. Templeton then scheduled his time so that he was always in before the boss arrived and still at his desk when the man left each evening. He feels that his rapid rise had much to do with the impression he made on his boss as a man willing to work long hours. He was labeled as a hard worker, and hard workers advance the most rapidly in any enterprise. It was in his second year at Yale, however, in 1931, that John Templeton truly learned the meaning of hard work. His father told him, \"John, I can't give you one more dollar toward college. I can barely hold on through this depression.\" The news was a blow to young Templeton's future hopes. But when he got over the initial shock, he searched for answers. Should he look for a job or return to college? He prayed and sought advice from family and friends. He mulled over their suggestions and offers, including that of his uncle, Watson G. Templeton, who was willing to lend him two hundred dollars if he would try to work his way through the next three years of college. Templeton finally decided to borrow the money from his uncle. With a positive \"can-do\" attitude, he returned to Yale that fall prepared to scramble for the necessary funds to finish his education.\n\n56\n\nI\n\nStep 7\n\nOn his arrival, he immediately went to Ogden Miller, the man in charge of the college's Bureau of Appointments, and explained his financial predicament. Because of his excellent freshman record, he not only received a scholarship but got employment from the university as well. He had taken a chance in returning to Yale on his uncle's modest loan. And now, to stack the odds solidly in his favor, he was forced to invest more of his own effort and sweat to see that the gamble paid off. One lesson he learned during that period was that you must ' 'always deliver more than you promise/' Another lesson: \"Seeming tragedy can be God's way of educating his children.\" Most importantly, the need to earn his own college expenses taught him the meaning of hard work and thrift. Templeton says, \"I knew that to continue at Yale I would have to get not one but several scholarships simultaneously. To do that I would have to have top grades, and so for the first time in my life, I became a really hard worker. Throughout my college career, I always had at least two scholarships, and at the end of my junior year, I was the number one student in my class. \"How did this happen? Not because I was the smartest kid in my class. I wasn't. There were dozens of students with superior intellects. But I had learned to be a hard worker, and that's more significant in the end than being intellectual. Success depends more on how you develop your talents than on how many talents you have.\" In college exams, you have to answer as many questions as possible as accurately as possible. One\n\nInvesting Yourself in Your Work\n\nI 57\n\nsuccess secret that Templeton learned is not to dwell on those questions that pose difficulties. If you have an examination of ten questions, glance through it quickly and first complete the answers you are sure of. Do those accurately and thoroughly. Then try the others. If, by the time the examination is over, you have neglected anything, it is likely to be a question you couldn't have answered in any case. Don't waste time on the impossible when you can make valuable headway in the area of the possible. That is a valuable success habit to carry through life. John Templeton believes that successful people, ever conscious of time management, will not get their news from television. Too much time is wasted. During a thirty-minute program, there are numerous commercial interruptions and very little substantive news. For the hard worker, conscious of time, it is far more expedient to read a good newspaper. In only ten minutes with a newspaper, by running your eyes down the columns and picking out the headlines of significant items, then scanning what is pertinent, you will gain ten times the information you will receive from half an hour of television viewing. He further believes that no one who watches more than one hundred hours of television a year will become a success. Scanning is a must for anyone who hopes to be successful. There is far too much printed material in any given area for one person to digest in a single lifetime. You have to select whatever is most helpful. Proper scanning will allow you to increase your work load at least twofold. Also, proper scanning frees you from the drudgery of reading through long\n\n58\n\nI\n\nStep 7\n\npassages of material that aren't related to your interests. Skip items that are trivial and read those of lasting significance. Because, as Korsaren said, \"Work is the greatest remedy available for both mental and physical afflictions/ 'in adversity, it is important to work even harder, as Templeton did as a Yale sophomore. Too many people take the attitude that there are no suitable jobs for them. If these same people became givers rather than getters, they would move ahead much faster. They should ask themselves, \"What can I give of myself and my talents that will please someone?\" They should not simply say, \"Give me a job with a salary.\" This applies particularly to the sales area. Hundreds of corporations are delighted to have sales representatives if they can pay them on a commission basis. If you want to get started on the success course, you should carefully choose the industry with which you feel a kinship. You should then approach a company in that field and say, \"Don't pay me anything. I'm not asking for a drawing account. Just let me sell your product.\" Then, once on board, it's up to you to give the job long hours and lots of enthusiasm. Remember, all the power of God within you is at work. Margaret Thatcher has offered a program in Britain that would be worth considering in the United States. By offering a valid start-up plan, the unemployed there are provided money to go into business for themselves. So much is allotted to the person wanting to open a shoeshine stand; a larger sum goes to the person opening a restaurant at the seashore. Ifthose recipients of government funds work\n\nInvesting Yourself in Your Work\n\nI\n\n59\n\nhard and are successful, they hire others and thus the unemployment rolls are reduced even more. Of course, the plan's success — like that of almost every plan in life — depends on hard work. Another key to success, and one that John Templeton recommends and tries to use himself, is to take one day off each week and use that time to do something that is both totally different and spiritually uplifting. Call it your sabbath day. It need not be a Saturday or a Sunday. Even those who are not churchgoers should observe a sabbath day, working on spiritual growth or charity. As you climb toward success, striving each day and each hour to fulfill your goals, it is vital that you not neglect your sleep. John Templeton has worked long hours his entire life, putting in many fifteen-hour working days, six days a week. Yet he has tried to get seven hours of sleep a night. Without proper rest, energy flags. In some respects, his approach to life, even at a young age, matched the method of time and energy management discovered by the hardworking founder of Methodism, John Wesley. At the age of eighty-five, Wesley wrote in his Journal: I this day enter on my eighty-fifth year; and what cause have I to praise God, as for a thousand spiritual blessings, so for bodily blessings also! ... To what cause can I impute this, that I am as I am? First,"
