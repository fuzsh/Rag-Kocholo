Of course, I did not know this at that time. I wrote my Ph.D. thesis on the colonial history of Pennsylvania on the eve of the American Revolution. I thus studied a very early incident of ‘decolonization’. My main interest was in the interaction of various denominational and political groups and the contribution of this process to the development of democratic institutions. After ﬁnishing this work I went to India where I spent three years doing archival work on the history of the Indian freedom movement. I also had a chance to interview Jawaharlal Nehru and many other Indian politicians who had participated in the freedom movement. The main focus of my work was the alternating current of nationalist campaigns and British constitutional reforms. I subsequently continued my research work at the India Ofﬁce Library in London. On one of my trips to India I also visited East Africa in 1964 and had a long interview with Julius Nyerere. Some of his reactions to my questions reminded me of my interview with Nehru. Seeing Tanganyika, Kenya and Uganda soon after the attainment of independence was a great experience. My studies of nationalism and decolonization led me to a deeper interest in the economic history of the interwar period. I worked on the agrarian distress caused by the Great Depression and after doing a book on India in the Great Depression, I expanded my research interests to the global impact of the Great Depression. The sufferings of the peasants in this period attracted my attention. They had hardly been taken note of by historians up to that point. In doing all this work I somehow acquired the qualiﬁcations for undertaking the present work. Nevertheless, I approached the task of writing this Companion with some trepidation. Dealing with the whole world single-handedly seemed to be a frightening challenge. An edited volume with contributions by several area specialists would perhaps have been a better idea. But it would have been impossible to produce a reference work with a uniﬁed perspective in this way. Fortunately I could rely on the help of generous colleagues who read my chapters and commented on them in detail. Basudeb Chaudhuri, Caen, read the chapter on neocolonialism; Bernhard Dahm, Passau, read the sections on Southeast Asia; Andreas Eckert, Hamburg, had a quick glance at the Africa chapters; Mark Figueroa, University of the West Indies, had a close look at the chapters on the Caribbean and on the sugar colonies; Bernd Hausberger, Berlin, also read the chapter on the Caribbean; Dane Kennedy, Washington, examined the chapter on the white settlers in Africa; Malyn Newitt, London, commented on the chapter on the Portuguese empire and xi\n\nPREFACE\n\nWalter Schicho, Vienna, looked in great detail at the chapter on the ‘Wind of Change’ in Africa. To all of them I owe a debt of gratitude. I also wish to thank my wife, Chitra, for reading the text, correcting mistakes and pointing out some errors of judgement. I am, of course, entirely responsible for all errors which may have remained in the text.

Within less than two decades, from 1947 to the mid-1960s, several colonial empires disappeared and scores of new nations became independent. Altogether it had taken more than three centuries to expand and consolidate these empires. Compared to this long span of time, the short period of decolonization appears to be only a fleeting moment in the course of history, and yet it is of utmost signiﬁcance. The focus of this Companion is on this brief period. But further developments up to the return of Hong Kong and Macao to China in 1997 and 1999 respectively will also be taken into consideration. Colonies in Europe, like Cyprus and Malta, will not be discussed in this book, which is exclusively devoted to the emancipation of the colonies in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and the Paciﬁc. The Union of South Africa is also not covered by the present text. No doubt the regime of white supremacy, which prevailed until 1994, was a quasi-colonial one, but Great Britain had ‘decolonized’ South Africa long ago. It had become a dominion like Canada in 1910. As far as all other countries are concerned, the phenomenon of ‘decolonization’will be seen in a broad perspective. Current usage of this term as reﬂected in dictionaries is a rather narrow one. ‘Decolonize’ means ‘to release from being a colony, to grant independence’. This attributes the action exclusively to the metropolitan government. Accordingly the student of decolonization would have to ﬁnd out how, when and why this action was taken. Actually, most studies of decolonization have followed this line. Moritz Julius Bonn (1873–1965), the scholar who coined the term ‘decolonization’in the 1930s, however, had something else in mind. Bonn was a German economist who taught at the London School of Economics. In 1932 he had contributed the article on ‘Imperialism’ to the Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences in which he referred to ‘decolonization’. He explained the meaning of this term in greater detail in a book which he published in 1938 under the prophetic title The Crumbling of Empire. The Disintegration of World Economy.1 In this book he frequently used the term ‘counter-colonization’ as a synonym for decolonization. With this new term he wanted to characterize the movements of subject peoples who wished to put an end to colonial rule as well as the trend of global developments, which led to the demise of colonial empires. The subtitle of his book refers to this trend. He witnessed the years of the Great Depression and criticized the practice of exchange manipulations and protectionism. ‘Vertical colonialism’, as he called the penetration of subject societies, 1\n\nTHE ROUTLEDGE COMPANION TO DECOLONIZATION\n\ncould not be extended any longer. It had passed its zenith and was on the decline. At the most, hungry powers could indulge in wars of conquest like the Japanese did in Manchuria, but this was also bound to fail. Such belated efforts at empire building would only strengthen the forces of counter-colonization. For Europe he predicted an imminent civil war but also a future federation of Europe. Colonial empires, however, were bound to crumble as the epoch in which they could ﬂourish was drawing to an end. Bonn would have agreed with Karl Hack’s recent suggestion of a ‘broader conception, in which imperialism and globalization are themselves the taproots of decolonization’.2 In studying decolonization along the lines suggested by Bonn, one would have to trace the currents of ‘counter-colonization’ in social, political and economic terms. The acts of metropolitan governments which relinquish crumbling empires would only be one aspect of this study. The movements of colonial subjects as well as the social and economic context of colonial rule would also have to be taken into consideration. Furthermore, the study of decolonization should not stop with the formal transfer of power. There is a complex legacy of colonial rule, which would escape our attention if we stopped at that point. In most cases the national elites that replaced the colonial rulers took over the state as a going concern with all its instruments of governance. They also accepted the boundaries of the colonial states as if they were ‘natural’ ones. Programmes drafted by national movements before the ‘transfer of power’ were often shelved in the interest of consolidating the new states. Lifestyles adopted in colonial times often persisted for a long time. Leopold Sédar Senghor, the famous poet and statesman of Senegal, had once made a comment on the French policy of assimilation. He had said that the Africans wanted to assimilate and not be assimilated. This distinction sounded convincing, but in the daily lives of colonial ‘subjects’ it could not be made as easily. Education and language were very pervasive. Senghor himself, who was a specialist in West African linguistics, could hardly address his immediate neighbours, the Woloff, in their language and had to resort to French when talking to their leaders.3 In recent years the problem of ‘decolonizing the mind’ has attracted the attention of many scholars. The term ‘post-colonialism’ has been introduced in this context. There have been lively debates on ‘hybrid culture’ and on the relation between power and knowledge as exemplified by ‘Orientalism’. Unfortunately many of these studies have ended up in the rariﬁed atmosphere of ‘discourse analysis’. The Companion will not follow this path, but some of the insights of its votaries will be noted. Another contentious subject, which has given rise to heated debates, is ‘neocolonialism’. This term has often been used as a slogan by those who have been disappointed with the results of decolonization. The ‘promised land’, which they had hoped to enter at the attainment of independence, eluded them. Therefore, they argued that formal political independence only masked the harsh reality of continued economic dependence. Actually, the inﬂuence which the colonial rulers had hoped to gain by handing over power more or less gracefully receded very soon. But global relations of creditors and debtors emerged, which often proved to be burdensome. This will be discussed at the end of section II. 2\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nORGANIZATION OF THE BOOK Like all Companions in this series, this book is divided into three key reference sections. The ﬁrst one begins with a chronology of events, taking the end of the First World War as a point of departure, when the Ottoman Empire was dismantled and the German colonies were entrusted to other colonial powers under mandates of the League of Nations. The chronology ends with the return of Hong Kong and Macao to China in 1997 and 1999 respectively. The second part of the ﬁrst section is devoted to the colonial background without which the process of decolonization cannot be understood. This is followed by a part on historiography which contains a critical evaluation of the major trends of analysis of the process of decolonization. The maps appended to the first reference section show the regions discussed subsequently in the second reference section. The second section contains eleven thematic chapters. The ﬁrst chapter outlines the global political and economic context of the process of decolonization. It also contains an analysis of the emergence of nationalism in the colonies and the mobilization of the people into various movements of resistance to colonial rule. The third section of this ﬁrst chapter deals with Afro-Asian solidarity and non-alignment and the fourth section is devoted to the system of mandates of the League of Nations followed by the organization of trusteeship by the United Nations. The subsequent chapters deal with the regional processes of decolonization in Asia, Africa, the Caribbean and the Paciﬁc. Two major problems have been highlighted in speciﬁc chapters: the impediments to decolonization, which existed in those colonies where white settlers played an important political role and the peculiar situation of the sugar colonies in which Indian immigrant labour more or less balanced the indigenous population. Another special chapter deals with the Portuguese empire, which was of a rather different kind to the other ones. Portugal was ruled for a long time by an authoritarian government which held that all Portuguese colonies were integral parts of the Portuguese state. ‘Decolonization’ in this context meant the dissolution of that state and this required a revolution, which took place in 1974. By that time the ‘Cold War’ was in full swing and this affected the belated decolonization of this diehard empire. The last two chapters of the second reference section are devoted to general themes concerning the fate of the new nations after the attainment of independence. The legacy of colonialism is studied in its various aspects. Finally an attempt has been made to deal with ‘neocolonialism’. Some of the economic issues touched upon in earlier chapters will again be taken up in this last chapter. The third reference section begins with a survey of the sources related to the process of decolonization and recommendations for secondary reading. Metropolitan powers have published selections of archival sources, often amounting to many volumes. Spurred by the publication of such sources, some of the decolonized countries have turned to a documentation of their freedom movements. Such publications will also be included in this survey. A further part of the third section contains biographies of African, Asian and 3\n\nTHE ROUTLEDGE COMPANION TO DECOLONIZATION\n\nCaribbean leaders. The inclusion of European politicians who were in one way or another involved in the process of decolonization would have taken up too much space, the more so as the respective biographical information would have to be ampliﬁed by detailing the role which they had played in this context. Most of them held their respective ofﬁces only for a short time. The glossary, which follows this biographical section, is aimed at explaining terms contained in the text of the ﬁrst and the second reference sections. The ﬁnal bibliography lists only those books that have been used for the preparation of the text. The copious index is the main tool for locating cross-references. For ready reference, all names and terms in the text, which have been also mentioned in the biographies and in the glossary, are printed in bold. This will also help the reader to retrieve information in the text at a quick glance.\n\n4\n\nI CHRONOLOGY, BACKGROUND, HISTORIOGRAPHY\n\nCHRONOLOGY\n\nAbbreviations: Com. = Member of the (British) Commonwealth of Nations; Conf. = conference; indep. = independent; occ. = occupy, occupied; Pres. = president; PM = prime minister; Rep. = republic\n\n1920 League of Nations sanctions distribution of mandate territories among colonial powers Non-cooperation campaign led by M.

During those centuries European imperialism had frequently changed its character. Different powers took the lead in the quest for European expansion. The thrust of this expansion shifted from continent to continent and the economic conditions changed dramatically over time. In the mid-eighteenth century Europe’s standard of living was probably somewhat lower than that of most other parts of the world.1 By 1830 Western Europe had moved far ahead of the rest of the world in this respect. Throughout the nineteenth century the European imperial powers led by Great Britain forged ahead at a fast pace. The fatal sequence of First World War–Great Depression– Second World War then broke the back of European imperialism and prepared the ground for decolonization. Periodizations have at the most a didactic value as they invariably reﬂect simpliﬁcations which scholars may rightly criticize. Nevertheless, an attempt will be made to sketch ﬁve phases of European imperialism: 1) From early maritime expansion to the Seven Years War which ended in 1763; 2) The consolidation of colonial rule until the 1870s; 3) The high tide of imperialism until 1914; 4) The sequence war–depression–war; 5) Post-war imperialism as a rearguard action against inevitable decolonization. The protagonists of the ﬁrst phase were the Portuguese, the Spanish and the Dutch who established impressive seaborne empires. Advances in shipbuilding and nautical knowledge, the skill of installing guns on ships, the control of trade in precious metals, spices and ﬁnally cotton textiles helped to establish European rule overseas. Most European outposts were merely bridgeheads at that time; only in a few places did the Europeans aim at more extensive territorial rule as the Dutch did in the Netherlands Indies (Indonesia) and the Spanish in Latin America. The Dutch also found out about the proﬁts of intra-Asian maritime trade, mostly in textiles, and the British followed them, tapping the enormous wealth of textile production in India. The method of auctioning Asian goods in Amsterdam and London permitted the testing of the European demand for new items and this is how Indian cotton textiles entered the European market in a big way. The growth of trade also gave rise to a ﬁnancial revolution which was institutionalized in banks such as the Bank of England and the Bank of Amsterdam or in joint stock companies like the English and Dutch East India companies. These institutional innovations which set the pace for future economic development were made around 1600.2 All this happened when, in terms of per capita incomes and living 15\n\nCHRONOLOGY, BACKGROUND, HISTORIOGRAPHY\n\nstandards, Europe was not yet ahead of the rest of the world. It was a time of intense European rivalries which often culminated in terrible internecine wars. These wars also produced institutional innovations which then became important for warfare overseas. Well-ﬁnanced standing armies replaced the rather irregular troops of earlier times. The strategy of combining a powerful ﬁeld artillery with a well-drilled infantry put an end to cavalry warfare. The ‘man on horseback’ might still direct the battle, but the cavalry would be mowed down by the superior ﬁrepower of artillery and infantry. The new achievements of international ﬁnance and of military strategy culminated in the Seven Years War which was in fact the ﬁrst ‘world’ war, raging on three continents and ending with a triumph for Great Britain.3 The British fought their battles mostly in Canada and India; in Europe they ﬁnanced allies such as Frederick the Great of Prussia. The French lost this war and with it their Spanish allies. The Spanish had joined the French for political reasons which conﬂicted with Spanish commercial interests. Both French and Spanish imperialism suffered a setback due to the war. Much of the Spanish empire was decolonized in the second phase of European imperialism. French imperialism was revived once more in the third phase, while in the meantime British hegemony enveloped the globe. The second phase of European imperialism was dominated by the British, although they suffered a setback in its early years due to the secession of the American colonies. Imperial overstretch forced the British to tax the American settlers who protested against this with the famous slogan: ‘No taxation without representation’. At the same time the British were more successful in India which they conquered at the expense of the Indian taxpayer who had no idea of representation as yet. After capturing the rich revenue of Bengal, the British could recover the silver which they had earlier brought to India in order to buy Indian textiles. This ﬁnanced the war efforts as well as the booming trade in Chinese tea. It has sometimes been argued that ‘the plunder of Bengal’ ﬁnanced the Industrial Revolution. There was no such direct connection. The early decades of the Industrial Revolution were marked by the invention of simple labour-saving devices such as spinning jennies and looms driven by waterpower. The entrepreneurs concerned could easily ﬁnance these means of production from their earnings, but, of course, the increasing commercial wealth of Great Britain helped them to sell their products. Indirectly, therefore, ‘the plunder of Bengal’ did contribute to ﬁnancing the Industrial Revolution. This ‘revolution’ was not a sudden event, but rather a slow process. Advances in metal work and mechanical engineering were required before powerlooms could replace handlooms in the 1830s. Finally the steam engine would drive such powerlooms as well as railways and ships, among them the new gunboats which helped the British to win the Opium War against the Chinese. The Industrial Revolution not only added to military power, but also created new outlets for British investments. Railways were built and ﬁnanced by the British in America and in India at a very rapid rate in the mid-nineteenth century. Steamers 16\n\nBACKGROUND: THE PHASES OF EUROPEANIMPERIALISM\n\ncrossing the oceans independent of adverse winds brought down freight rates and contributed to the growth of international trade. The telegraph speeded up intercontinental communications. Commercial intelligence was available within a short time and instructions from imperial centres to the colonial periphery could be transmitted with lightning speed. Further progress in the control of international ﬁnancial markets backed up all these developments. The British were far ahead of their rivals, the French, in this respect. French ﬁnancial institutions lagged behind the British ones by about 100 years.4 There had also been a surprising demographic development: in c. 1750 the British Isles were inhabited by about 5 million people whereas France had 27 million; by 1850 the respective ﬁgures were 20 and 35 million. Initially the Industrial Revolution came about due to the lack of manpower which necessitated the invention of labour-saving machinery, but as industrialization progressed it offered employment and thus bred an expanding proletariat. Throughout the second phase of imperialism Great Britain consolidated its rule overseas and produced more and more industrial goods. The years from 1850 to 1875 were a period of rapid economic growth both in Great Britain and in France. Towards the end of this phase, however, industrial growth slowed down while the service sector expanded by leaps and bounds. Much of this was due to the role of the City of London as the centre of international ﬁnance. Walter Bagehot, the editor of The Economist, remarked at that time that the British Isles would soon be inhabitated only by moneylenders and their servants. Invisible earnings from capital investment abroad rivalled industrial exports. The lion’s share of British overseas investment from 1865 to 1914 was attracted by North America (34 per cent); India and Ceylon received only a minor share (10 per cent), about the same as Australia.5 The third phase of imperialism was characterized by conﬂicting trends. The Great Depression of the late nineteenth century – a long period of decline of commodity prices in terms of gold – affected the metropolitan countries, but this did not impede their imperialist vigour. Many parts of the globe which had so far not been ‘colonized’ were now subjected to foreign rule. The European powers competed for territories, very often establishing their claims mainly in order to prevent others from getting there ﬁrst. The British annexed Upper Burma in 1885 while the French penetrated Indo-China at the same time. Siam (Thailand) was left as a buffer state between them. The Scramble for Africa was the most notorious of these imperial endeavours. The British and the French were the main contestants, but they were now joined by the Germans who had so far not shown much interest in colonial pursuits because they had been busy consolidating their own nation. Chancellor Bismarck, the architect of the German ‘Reich’, was initially not interested in colonies but he was pushed by German pressure groups to join the fray. Finally he volunteered to act as the ‘honest broker’ at the Berlin Conference of 1884–1885 where Africa was divided up into suitable pieces. The straight lines on the map show, even today, that the borders of African territories were drawn at a conference table without regard for local realities. It is interesting to note that 17\n\nCHRONOLOGY, BACKGROUND, HISTORIOGRAPHY\n\nthe Organization of African Unity (OAU) endorsed these borders in the 1960s so as to discourage all revisionist claims. At the time when the imperial powers met in Berlin, they did not yet control these African territorities. Very often they had only bridgeheads on the coast and a rather vague idea of the hinterland. In making actual occupation the criterion for the recognition of territorial rule, the Berlin Conference speeded up the Scramble for Africa on the ground. Most imperial powers built railways for this purpose which went straight from the bridgeheads into the hinterland. Wherever this hinterland was suitable for cash crop production for export, the new railways helped to open it up, linking it to the world market. The home markets of the colonies in Africa and Asia were thus subjected to the world market before they actually emerged ‘at home’. The decade before the First World War witnessed a boom in all commodity markets. The gains from this trade accrued only to a limited extent to the producers; they beneﬁted the traders, most of all the great metropolitan ﬁrms which controlled the export markets. The glory of European imperialism was terminated by the First World War which disrupted maritime trade and ruined the international gold standard. Both Great Britain and France emerged from this war with a much reduced political and economic power. The zest for empire which had earlier inspired the educated middle class was waning. When prime minister Lloyd George made his famous speech in 1922 in which he compared the Indian Civil Service to a ‘steel frame’, this was no imperial bravado but a desparate attempt to recruit young men for this service. The future of the empire appeared to be dim, thus the thought of a lifetime service in India seemed to be less attractive. Prospects seemed to be better in the mid-1920s after Great Britain had once more joined the gold standard at the pre-war parity. This proved to be a wrong decision only a few years later, but while the going was good it revived imperial optimism. However, this was soon dampened by the sudden blow of the Great Depression which started in the USA in 1929 and subsequently engulfed the whole world. The consequences of the disintegration of the world economy will be discussed in a subsequent chapter. Here it may sufﬁce to point out that the slump in commodity prices caused by the Great Depression reduced the value of colonial possessions, but since most colonies were indebted to their European masters, imperial control was tightened so as to save the creditors from bankruptcy. Great Britain was forced off the gold standard in 1931, but the ﬂow of gold from the indebted periphery to the centre then supported the newly created Sterling Area. It was backed up by ‘Imperial Preference’, a tariff wall protecting the British empire. This greatly annoyed the USA which had always pursued an ‘Open Door’ policy. American anticolonialism, which became more assertive under President Roosevelt, owed much to this development. The economic policy of the imperial powers changed under the impact of the new challenges which they had to meet. Economic liberalism was abandoned step by step, while protectionism emerged as a reaction to the depression. State intervention was introduced to meet the need of managing the economy during 18\n\nBACKGROUND: THE PHASES OF EUROPEANIMPERIALISM\n\nthe Second World War. While the apparatus of colonial rule had been of modest dimensions before the war, it was far more formidable by the end of the conﬂict. The concept of economic planning had emerged during the war and then became a characteristic feature of post-war imperialism. The last phase of imperialism was riddled with contradictions. Great Britain was practically bankrupt at the end of the war and depended on the credit of the USA and of some of its own colonies, which had turned from debtors into creditors as India had done during the war. France and the Netherlands had, as a result of Nazi occupation, practically ceased to exist during the course of the war and had to restore their sovereignty both at home and in their colonies. The French and the Dutch governments conceived of these tasks as interrelated. The French Union whose constitution was introduced in 1946 encompassed France as well as its ‘overseas territories’; the Dutch envisioned a Union headed by the Queen of the Netherlands and including the colonies. While the French and the Dutch launched great campaigns to recover their colonies, the British set the pace for decolonization by granting independence to India in 1947. Since India was now a creditor of Great Britain it was easier to let it go, particularly as the Indian interim government had to sign a moratorium on the eve of independence. A strong motive for the rapid decolonization of India was the demobilization of the huge British-Indian army which was a potentially dangerous task. But whereas Great Britain withdrew quickly from South Asia, it clung to its African possessions and produced plans for their economic development just as the French did. By the mid-1950s both the French and the British governments realized that they could not make ﬁnancial ends meet in their colonies. Even before Harold Macmillan noted the ‘Wind of Change’blowing across Africa he had felt it in Whitehall where he had conducted a cost/beneﬁt analysis of colonial rule, showing that the costs far outweighed the beneﬁts. At about the same time a French minister had made similar calculations. If France was really serious about raising the standard of living throughout the French Union to the same level, the French in France would have to reduce their standard of living by at least 25 per cent. If imperialism no longer paid, or even demanded economic sacriﬁces, it was time to give it up. Admittedly, this outline of the phases of imperialism is rather Eurocentric. It does not account for activities at the periphery of empires. Some scholars have advocated an ‘excentric’ theory of imperialism in order to correct this perspective. They argue that the ‘agency’ of people at the periphery was sometimes more important for imperial growth than the political will of the imperialists. In a way Mahatma Gandhi was an early representative of this ‘excentric’ theory when he asserted that the Indians had given India to the British by cooperating with them. Of course, for Gandhi this was a polemical argument meant to convince the Indians of the need for non-cooperation. The European ‘excentrics’ have also stressed the role of ‘collaborating elites’ in supporting the empires. They tend to forget the importance of systematic coercion which radiated from imperial authority. This coercion sometimes appeared in the form of outright military intervention, but it usually expressed itself in institutional arrangements with 19\n\nCHRONOLOGY, BACKGROUND, HISTORIOGRAPHY\n\nthe threat of force as a residual element. The ‘native authorities’ on which the European imperialists relied in Africa could be characterized as ‘collaborating elites’. The imperialist discourse on preserving traditions and respecting the ‘natural leaders’ of the people would tend to give credence to ‘excentric’ views. But these ‘natural leaders’ were often appointed chiefs and even if they had the dignity of some ancient lineage, they knew very well that they were at the mercy of the colonial rulers. It was only at the time of the initial imperial encounter when the colonial rulers had to look for military allies in order to consolidate their power that ‘collaborators’ could make a difference. But even then, the superior organization of the imperial power and the collective memory embodied in its civil and military staff was more important than the intentions of the individual ‘collaborator’ who could be easily replaced if he was no longer useful. Colonial rule was not a rule of warlords, but was managed by bureaucrats controlled by the respective imperial centre. The arguments against ‘excentrism’ should not distract from the need to correct the Eurocentric perspective. Perhaps one should suggest an interactive and contextual theory of imperialism which would portray imperialism as an open system which could adapt to new challenges. Similarly we shall have to think of decolonization as an interactive process which encompassed the intiatives of the colonial rulers as well as those of anti-colonial movements. The rulers tried to set the agenda and to deﬁne the arena of political activity, but those who deﬁed them had their own agenda and mobilized their supporters so as to shift the arena of political action.\n\n20\n\nHISTORIOGRAPHY\n\nDecolonization has given rise to a voluminous historiography which could be the subject of a special comparative study. It includes the accounts written by historians of the countries of the former colonial rulers as well as those of the decolonized nations. The former range from apologetic studies to proud proclamations of a successful transfer of power, while the latter include the work of nationalist myth-makers as well as the critical analyses of trained historians. In addition to the work of historians of nations directly involved in the process of decolonization, there have also been important contributions by historians of other nations who had a more detached view. The brief historiographical survey provided here is restricted to a few examples of the major approaches to the subject. Since there is also a Guide to Sources and Secondary Reading in this book (see pp. 272–92), the present chapter concentrates on the work of a few authors. They are discussed here because their work illustrates the variety of perspectives.\n\nTHE METROPOLITAN AGENDA OF DECOLONIZATION Many scholars writing on decolonization viewed it ﬁrst and foremost as an initiative taken by the metropolitan powers and tried to reconstruct the agenda of these powers with regard to colonial administration, constitutional reform and the ﬁnal ‘transfer of power’. Those who explored European archives were naturally inﬂuenced by the type of sources available to them. Colonial proconsuls and the staff of colonial ministries as well as European politicians discussing colonial affairs were the actors in the drama which they portrayed. The views of colonial nationalists were at the most reﬂected through the prism of ofﬁcial reactions to them. The metropolitan approach was also attractive because it provided a panorama seen from the commanding heights of imperial power. Metropolitan policies rarely applied to single colonies only, as there were always larger issues to be taken into consideration. The scholar who looked at decolonization from the metropolitan perspective could therefore claim to base his analysis on a wide range of information. In general such scholars would not openly assert that the colonial ‘subjects’were at the receiving end and that their actions hardly mattered, but their work often reﬂected this attitude. Of course, there were also scholars in this ﬁeld who modestly stated that they saw their work as a part of European history and were unable to spend years in Africa or Asia to do their research there. 21\n\nCHRONOLOGY, BACKGROUND, HISTORIOGRAPHY\n\nThe most comprehensive study of the metropolitan agenda was undertaken at an early stage by a Swiss scholar, Rudolf von Albertini, whose book on decolonization has the subtitle ‘The Discussion on the Administration and the Future of the Colonies, 1919–1960’.1 This accurately reﬂects his main aim in writing this book. He concentrated his work on comparing the British and the French colonial administrations and their plans for decolonization. The Dutch and the Portuguese empires are only discussed very brieﬂy at the end of the book. There are also two brief sections on the Americans in the Philippines and the Belgians in the Congo. The book is not based on archival research, but there are frequent references to ofﬁcial publications, parliamentary papers, newspaper reports, etc. As a comprehensive study of this particular subject, von Albertini’s work has not yet been superseded by any subsequent publication. Almost at the same time, a French scholar, Henri Grimal, published his book on Decolonization: the British, French, Dutch and Belgian Empires, 1919–1963.2 Since he taught colonial history in France, he was very well informed about the French colonial empire and its decolonization, but he examined the French record from a critical perspective and tended to give more credit to the British approach. He also showed a sympathetic interest in the nationalists of the colonies to whose movements he gave due importance without covering them in detail. In general he devoted more attention to the metropolitan agenda, but he was also aware of the inﬂuence of outside forces on the process of decolonization to which he devoted an essential chapter of his book. The work of von Albertini and Grimal reﬂects the state of the debate in the early 1960s. A much shorter book on European decolonization with a similar scope was published by Roy Fraser Holland at a later stage.3 He also takes the end of the First World War as his point of departure but takes 1981 as his cut-off point. He thus includes the decolonization of the Portuguese empire. His treatment of this subject, however, is fairly short. Just like von Albertini, Holland also deals mainly with British and French colonial policy. Holland is an avowed advocate of the metropolitan approach to decolonization and asserts that it arose more directly from changes within the metropoles than from a metamorphosis of the periphery. John Darwin also belongs to the metropolitan historians. He has restricted his study of decolonization to the British empire.4 Unlike other historians he pays much attention to economic aspects, particularly to currency affairs. The devaluation of sterling and its impact on the Sterling Area are discussed by him in detail. Nevertheless he asserts that political rather than economic reasons have been the main cause of decolonization. A French metropolitan historian, Jacques Marseille, has come to a different conclusion in this respect.5 In dealing with the relations between French imperialism and capitalism he argues that economic growth in the 1950s and the attractions of the European market weakened the colonial lobby and strengthened those who wished to invest in Europe rather than waste money on colonial development. When he started his research he wanted to ﬁnd evidence for the hypothesis that the export of capital to the colonies was the driving force of imperialism, but 22\n\nHISTORIOGRAPHY\n\nhis ﬁndings disproved it. He found that the Great Depression was the turning point in imperial relations. It compelled the French to restructure their industries as well as the relations with their empire. In many ways Marseille’s ﬁndings correspond to Bonn’s The Crumbling of Empire, but it seems that he did not know of Bonn’s work. In its subtitle Marseille calls his book the ‘History of a Divorce’. He shows that this divorce was not a sudden event but took place over a long time during which capitalism lost its intimate relationship with imperialism. The tragic irony of this divorce was that before the marriage broke up bloody wars were fought in Indo-China and Algeria in order to retain political control over colonies which were no longer useful from an economic point of view.\n\nTHE DIMINISHING RETURNS TO COLLABORATION Whereas metropolitan historians tend to attribute ‘agency’ exclusively to the colonial rulers, there are others who adopt an ‘excentric’ view and stress the ‘agency’ of collaborators among the colonized people. These collaborators were used by the colonialists but also made use of their rulers to serve their own interests. The advocates of the excentric view hold that the periphery did not accept passively what the centre imposed on it but shaped the imperial impact to a large extent. Ronald Robinson, the pioneer of ‘excentrism’, even claims that this theory can explain the rise and fall of colonialism through the reversal of a single model.6 Colonialism thrives on recruiting collaborators and when it can no longer do so, decolonization becomes inevitable. It seems that diminishing returns to collaboration lead to the reversal of the model. Robinson has not used these terms, but they help to elucidate the process which he has tried to explain. The original type of collaborator was the ‘comprador’. This Portuguese word meant ‘buyer’ but referred more generally to an intermediary agent who helped foreign traders to transact their business with his countrymen. When commercial relations receded and territorial rule was established, other types of collaborators were required: chiefs, military entrepreneurs, revenue accountants, etc. In general, the colonial rulers were more exacting revenue collectors but also more reliable paymasters than their indigenous predecessors. Therefore they could reward their collaborators on a regular basis. The main function of colonial pro-consuls was that of arbiters of the fate of various types of collaborators. As colonial rule progressed and developed into a bureaucratic machine, the importance of the collaborators diminished. Robinson argues that the demise of colonial rule began when it ran out of collaborators. But in some instances the real problem was that there were more potential collaborators than the colonial machine could absorb. The diminishing returns to collaboration could thus refer both to restrictions on collaborators and to the lack of opportunities for those who wanted to collaborate but did not get a chance to do so. Research on collaborating elites proved to be particularly attractive to British scholars inﬂuenced by the ideas of the great historian, Lord Namier. He had fashioned his unique methodology in the study of eighteenth-century British 23\n\nCHRONOLOGY, BACKGROUND, HISTORIOGRAPHY\n\nparliamentary politics.7 Parties of the modern type did not yet exist at that time; politics was based on ‘interests’. The aggregation of such interests could be studied by minute biographical research on individual Members of Parliament. Namier impressed more than a generation of scholars with his methodology. It had a special afﬁnity for British scepticism with regard to ideologies or deterministic social theories. ‘Interests’ were real and down to earth and could be identiﬁed by using Namier’s method. The drawback of this very rational method was that it could not account for movements such as nationalism or socialist revolution, etc. Why would people be prepared to risk their lives or go to prison instead of looking after their individual ‘interests’? But even though ‘Namierism’ did not provide answers to such questions, it had made an important contribution to historical research as long as it did not claim that only ‘interests’ mattered and everything else could be safely neglected. Similarly, the excentric model proposed by Robinson had a heuristic value for the study of decolonization. It served as a corrective of metropolitanism and drew attention to the ‘agency’ of the periphery, indicating that colonial rule was to some extent the product of ‘negotiation’. Critics have pointed out that the fascination with the periphery has tended to let the excentrics forget about the prime movers in the imperial centre.8 Obviously one has to keep both sides in mind.\n\nTHE EMANCIPATION FROM COLONIAL RULE The historians who studied national freedom movements and various forms of anti-colonial protest tended to disagree with the metropolitan historians with regard to the importance of their respective ﬁelds of research. The more radical representatives of both sides might actually think that the work of those on the other side was irrelevant. This disagreement was to some extent also due to the fact that the metropolitan historians usually originated in the nation of the colonial rulers while the others had been born as colonial ‘subjects’ and felt that they were continuing the freedom struggle by writing history. Moreover, some governments of newly independent nations commissioned the writing of national histories for political reasons. India is a particularly interesting case in point, as two rival ‘master narratives’ of the Indian freedom movement were produced in the 1960s. The inﬂuential education minister, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, a famous Muslim scholar, initially commissioned Romesh Chandra Majumdar to write the ‘ofﬁcial’ history of this movement. Majumdar was a noted nationalist historian who had inspired many Indians with his work on the glories of ancient India. He took up his work with great enthusiasm. Being a Bengali Hindu he portrayed the freedom movement from a perspective which did not please the minister who had expected an emphasis on Hindu–Muslim cooperation in the freedom movement, as he himself had been a close associate of Mahatma Gandhi. The work was almost ﬁnished when the Government of India withdrew its patronage; Majumdar then published three massive volumes on his own for which he won acclaim from many 24\n\nHISTORIOGRAPHY\n\nnationalists.9 In the meantime the minister had commissioned another ofﬁcial history, making sure that it would correspond to his point of view. The author of his choice was Tara Chand, an educationist from Allahabad, who already had a book on The Inﬂuence of Islam on Indian Culture to his credit which was ﬁrst published in 1922. This showed him to be a Hindu scholar with a sympathetic interest in Indian Muslims. Assisted by a competent staff, Tara Chand produced four massive volumes on the freedom movement which were published by the Government of India.10 Both Majumdar and Tara Chand took a long view and did not restrict their work to the twentieth century. Tara Chand constructed his narrative as a dialectical trilogy, beginning in the eighteenth century and showing how India had lost its freedom, then describing the colonial period and incipient nationalism and ﬁnally showing how India regained its freedom. He paid due attention to the nationalist Muslims whereas Majumdar had neglected them because he was attracted to Hindu communalism. The tensions between Hindus and Muslims which had led to the partition of India were thus reﬂected also in the ﬁeld of historiography. The two comprehensive ‘master narratives’ literally exhausted the subject and discouraged younger scholars from contributing further studies to this ﬁeld. Moreover, the younger generation of historians was inspired by Marxist ideas and nationalist historiography appeared old-fashioned to them. A new impetus to the study of the national movement was given only by the project Towards Freedom which was the Indian response to the great British publication of sources concerning The Transfer of Power. This will be described in the Guide to Sources and Secondary Reading. Other African and Asian nations produced hardly any nationalist ‘master narratives’ of the Indian type. There are good reasons for this; India had experienced a long and intense freedom movement and it already had a tradition of Western-style historiography as several Indian universities had built up history departments and many Indian scholars had studied history in British universities before taking up teaching positions at home. There was thus a universe of modern historical discourse in India which was lacking elsewhere. In the absence of trained historians, poets and other intellectuals tried to project a vision of national history in those other countries. Muhammad Yamin of Indonesia was a typical example of the ‘myth-maker’ who emerged as a national ‘historian’. He was a noted poet who was close to Sukarno. In 1957 he dominated the ﬁrst Indonesian national history conference where he was challenged by Soedjatmoko, a leading intellectual who defended rational rather than national historiography. Soedjatmoko had studied medicine and had then represented Indonesia in the United Nations. Yamin’s views prevailed at that time, but among the participants there was a young historian, Sartono Kartodirdjo, who was dissatisﬁed with the proceedings and looked for new ways of writing history. In 1970 he chaired the second national history conference and launched a plan for a multi-volume national history to be written by a team of authors. Soedjatmoko put him in touch with the Ford Foundation and the team was able to work for some time at the University of California, Berkeley. Sartono was 25\n\nCHRONOLOGY, BACKGROUND, HISTORIOGRAPHY\n\nnot satisﬁed with their product. He was also soon eclipsed by one of the members of his team, the military historian, Nugroho Susanto, who was close to President Suharto and gloriﬁed the role of the Indonesian army in his work. During Nugroho’s hegemony, he more or less determined the writing of history. He was a military ofﬁcer with suave manners who served as a minister and also held high university positions. New approaches to national history could only be articulated after Suharto’s ‘New Order’ collapsed. Critical voices such as that of the younger historian, Bambang Purwanto, could now make themselves heard. It seems that Indonesian historiography will only now come into its own. While Indonesian historians were busy with their self-centred historiography, some sympathetic ‘ex-patriates’ stepped in and produced their versions of Indonesia’s national history. Among them were scholars who started their academic careers after decolonization and were dissatisﬁed with the metropolitan approach described above. A senior leader of this group of scholars was George McTurnan Kahin, born in 1918, who had completed his studies in the USA before the war and was almost dropped as a parachutist on to Java in 1945. This plan was cancelled, but he then did land in Indonesia as a Ph.D. student in 1948, collecting material for his book Nationalism and Revolution in Indonesia which has remained a classic ever since its publication.11 He subsequently pioneered Indonesian studies at Cornell University and emerged as a strong critic of the Vietnam War. He was operating on the same wavelength as his Dutch colleague, W. F. Wertheim, and his Australian colleague, Herbert Feith, who both made major contributions to Indonesian studies. A younger German colleague, Bernhard Dahm, followed the same line of Indonesian studies, working ﬁrst on a biography of Sukarno and then publishing a history of Indonesia in the Twentieth Century.12 The examples of India and Indonesia may sufﬁce for an illustration of the historiography concerning the emancipation of Asian countries from colonial rule. A description of the historiography of other Asian countries in this ﬁeld would more or less reﬂect the same pattern. A comparative study of national ‘master narratives’ would go far beyond the scope of the present chapter; it could be the subject of another book. The historiography of the emancipation of African nations is less extensive than that concerning Asia. Professional African historians were very rare at the time of decolonization. In the meantime their numbers have not grown greatly and some of the best of them are working abroad rather than in the countries of their origin. The institutional support for the study of history is insufﬁcient in most African states. Of the few African historians of international stature working in their home countries one may mention Bethwell A. Ogot, University of Nairobi, a very productive scholar who published on numerous areas of African history. Among his books is one which is also dedicated to the subject under discussion here: Decolonization and Independence in Kenya, 1940–1993.13 His Nigerian contemporary, J. F. Ade Ajayi, University of Ibadan, has also published widely. He stresses the continuity of African history and considers the brief period of colonial rule only as an episode. This is reﬂected in his essays on 26\n\nHISTORIOGRAPHY\n\nTradition and Change in Africa.14 In francophone Africa, Joseph Ki-Zerbo of Burkina Faso followed a similar line in his Histoire de l’Afrique Noire.15 ‘Expatriates’ have also chimed in and contributed to the history of decolonization in Africa. One of them is David Birmingham who has been a pioneer in studying decolonization from the perspective of local experience rather than from the metropolitan point of view. He has paid attention to social and economic history and has placed African movements into this larger context without adopting a deterministic approach. He has highlighted African ‘agency’ in all his books. The slim volume on The Decolonization of Africa provides a good insight into his method of historiography and is also a succinct survey of this subject.16 The interested reader may then turn to his chapter on ‘Images and Themes in the Nineties’ which he contributed to a volume which he also co-edited with Phyllis M. Martin.17 Since this volume is devoted to the history of Central Africa after 1960, Birmingham’s chapter does not deal with the whole of Africa in a grand sweep, but shows at least for an important part of the continent what happened after decolonization. Another historian of Africa, Frederick Cooper, has also taken the side of African ‘agency’. His special subject is labour relations in British and French Africa from the 1930s to the 1960s. But he uses this topic as an entry into the wider sphere of social history as demonstrated in his book Decolonization and African Society.18 His work is based on a great deal of archival research in France, Great Britain, Kenya and Senegal. The various strikes in Africa are analysed by him in detail; he also shows how militant labour was drawn into national movements and how trade unions were used as stepping stones to political power by ambitious leaders. Whereas labour in Africa was initially very often forced labour, organized labour progressed literally along the railway lines. Cooper also shows how labour was ﬁnally deceived by the logic of nationalism. Under colonial rule, labour had tried to appeal to the universal idea of equal pay for equal work, whereas after independence the workers and their unions had to subordinate their interests to the goal of national development as deﬁned by their leaders. Cooper not only captures the assertiveness of African agency but also the constraints imposed on it by colonial as well as national rule. A prominent ‘expatriate’ who took sides with the Africans in the ﬁeld of historiography is Terence Ranger, who taught history in Zimbabwe and Tanzania before becoming Rhodes Professor of Race Relations at Oxford University. He had gone to Africa as a young lecturer, teaching European history, but was soon ‘converted’ to African history to which he made important contributions. An early work in this ﬁeld was The African Voice in Southern Rhodesia.19 He had not only sided with the Africans as a historian, but also as a citizen and was deported from Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) in 1963, then ﬁnding a new academic home at the University of Dar-es-Salaam. In his later work he devoted attention to the ‘invention of tradition’ as he observed it in Africa.20 This theme has since been widely discussed by scholars. It has also been subjected to criticism as it could be taken to mean that all traditions are invented, which is certainly not what Ranger 27\n\nCHRONOLOGY, BACKGROUND, HISTORIOGRAPHY\n\nhad stated. In fact, he had made a contribution to the new ﬁeld of ‘discourse analysis’, revealing the political motives behind certain types of ‘traditionalism’. He had earlier devoted a regional study to this theme in his book The Invention of Tribalism in Zimbabwe.21 Returning to Zimbabwe in recent years as a visiting professor, he was faced with the ‘patriotic history’ propagated by the government which ﬁts into the pattern of ‘invented tradition’.\n\nINTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND COLONIAL RETREAT Decolonization was an integral part of world politics. The old discipline of diplomatic history was extended so as to encompass the interaction of various powers in this ﬁeld. William Roger Louis, an American historian whose special ﬁeld is British history, did pioneering work in this ﬁeld. He bases his studies on very detailed archival research. In addition to the decisions of the main actors he pays close attention to the minutes and notes of bureaucrats and experts who have often strongly inﬂuenced those decisions. His ﬁrst major book was Imperialism at Bay22 whose tragic hero is President Roosevelt. Deeply convinced of the need to subject all colonies to international trusteeship so as to remove the causes of future wars, he was ﬁnally prevented from reaching this goal by the development of international relations at the end of the Second World War. This kind of trusteeship was not meant to perpetuate foreign rule but to prepare the way for independence. Louis traces the debates on this central theme and shows how and why Roosevelt’s policy was bound to be stymied. Louis’s second great book, The British Empire in the Middle East,23 also has a tragic hero: Ernest Bevin, the British Foreign Secretary, who was a tough labour union leader and a great patriot. He wanted to uphold Great Britain’s imperial position by converting the empire into a partnership with the people who had so far been treated as colonial subjects. An empire based on partnership was, however, a contradiction in terms and Bevin had to learn this the hard way: his policy was a failure. Again, Louis analysed this tragedy with great skill. Subsequently he continued this line of analysis of the process of decolonization in several major publications. In recent years two younger historians have followed this path in different ﬁelds: Matthew Connelly and Piero Gleijeses. Connelly’s book A Diplomatic Revolution24 throws new light on Algeria’s ﬁght for independence. He explains how this ﬁght was won in the ﬁeld of diplomacy although it had practically been lost on the battleﬁeld. The French military had crushed the Algerians but was not permitted to win the war because Algerian leaders mobilized international opinion in the United Nations and elsewhere very successfully. Like Louis’s books this work is also based on very detailed archival research of French, British, American and many other archives. Gleijeses has matched this effort in a very different ﬁeld in his Conﬂicting Missions.25 He has reconstructed the Cuban campaigns in Africa, particularly in the Portuguese colonies, with great attention to detail. As he had access to Cuban archives, he can tell his readers the inside story. Earlier there 28\n\nHISTORIOGRAPHY\n\nhad been a general impression that the Cubans acted as Soviet mercenaries in Africa, but Gleijeses can show that Castro and his followers were directing their own actions and initiated risky ventures while the Soviet Union watched and at the most lent its support when necessary. The Cubans have kept quiet about their achievements because they had promised their African friends that they would keep a low proﬁle so as not to distract from the merits of African freedom ﬁghters. Similar work documenting this new approach to diplomatic history has been published in a volume on International Diplomacy and Colonial Retreat edited by Kent Fedorowich and Martin Thomas.26 In his introductory contribution to this volume John Darwin mentions the impact of the Cold War on the process of decolonization but also stresses that now, after the end of the Cold War, the breakup of colonial rule once more emerges as the key event of the second half of the twentieth century. The other contributions to this volume highlight the impact of the Cold War as well as other factors which inﬂuenced the process of colonial retreat. The tangled skein of British–American cooperation and rivalry is portrayed in several contributions. These contributions are devoted to very speciﬁc themes such as the re-establishment of British rule in Hong Kong after the war, the Congo crisis, the Yemeni revolution, etc., but they all show that the process of decolonization must be analysed in the context of international relations. Thus they continue the work of Louis, Connelly and Gleijeses mentioned above. They are also based on very detailed archival research and thus demonstrate that the archives contain very valuable information which deserves to be explored. A volume devoted to a speciﬁc region has been edited by Marc Frey, Ronald W. Pruessen and Tan Tai Yong: The Tranformation of Southeast Asia. International Perspectives on Decolonization.27 It contains four chapters on different aspects of the role of the USA in Southeast Asia. Other chapters deal with the decolonization of Indo-China, Indonesia, Malaya, etc. The grand old master, Wang Gungwu, has contributed a perceptive afterword on the limits of decolonization. He feels that the meaning of the term ‘decolonization’ is sometimes expanded too much and that one must be careful not to overload it. He ends his afterword with a plea to ‘distinguish between what decolonization did for transformation in Southeast Asia and what transformations actually occurred because a restructured international architecture had transcended the heritage of decolonization’.28 This is a crucial point for the study of ‘International Relations and Colonial Retreat’. Decolonization is in itself an aspect of international relations. To separate it analytically from other ﬁelds of international relations is a difﬁcult task but it must be undertaken so as not to blur the meaning of decolonization. The work of the scholars mentioned here has contributed to an awareness of such analytical distinctions.\n\n29\n\nCHRONOLOGY, BACKGROUND, HISTORIOGRAPHY\n\nCHANGING THE FOCUS OF HISTORIOGRAPHY The future historiography of decolonization may also wish to highlight other aspects than those mentioned here so far. In reviewing the historical debate on the end of the British empire, John Darwin has stressed the deﬁciencies of all standard approaches to this subject.29 He has pointed out that those who trace the motives of decolonization to the domestic politics of the colonial powers as well as those who highlight the ‘Onslaught of Nationalism’ cannot provide adequate explanations of the process of decolonization. But he is also not satisﬁed with those who restrict their vision to economics or to international politics. He pleads for a mix of interpretations but does not provide a receipe for a proper mix. Perhaps the proper mix will have to be composed according to the particular constellation studied by the historian. Phyllis Martin in her article ‘Beyond Independence’ has mentioned another reason for changing the focus of historiography.30 She feels that the life histories of those who experienced the attainment of independence rarely reﬂect the triumph portrayed in standard national historiography. She pleads for a ‘decentring of decolonization’as reﬂected in such life histories. There is an element of postmodern resistance to structural explanations of history in her plea. However, the need for new narratives in the ﬁeld of decolonization is very obvious. The rivalling master narratives of the smooth ‘transfer of power’ and of triumphant nationalism no longer ﬁnd receptive audiences. A more comprehensive social and cultural history of decolonization is required. It will not produce a new master narrative but may contribute to a deeper understanding of the causes and consequences of decolonization. Mahmood Mamdani has opened up new lines of historical research in his book Citizen and Subject in which he discusses the legacy of late colonialism in Africa.31 He tries to steer a middle course between structuralism and its postmodern critics. He states that whereas structuralism puts ‘agency’ into the straitjacket of the iron laws of history, its critics tend to diminish the signiﬁcance of historical constraint in order to salvage agency. He wants to ﬁnd out how the subject population was incorporated into the arena of colonial power. As he sees it, the colonial rulers operated a system of decentralized despotism by means of ‘native authorities’. This system has been maintained by the post-independence state. But there are instances of peasant resistance movements. Such instances are of special interest to Mamdani and he has done ﬁeld work in areas where such movements are in evidence. His approach may provide new insights into the process of crossing the threshold of decolonization. In India Ranajit Guha and the historians who have produced a series of Subaltern Studies have explored the relation between colonial hegemony and ‘subaltern autonomy’.32 The categories of this line of historiography are derived from the work of Antonio Gramsci who has certainly much to offer to historians of decolonization. The Italy which Gramsci tried to analyse from a Marxist perspective had hardly reached an advanced stage of bourgeois capitalism when it was uniﬁed by the nationalist movement of the nineteenth century. This movement 30\n\nHISTORIOGRAPHY\n\nwas supported by an educated service class whose hegemony the ‘subaltern’ class accepted. The situation of many colonies was very similar to that of nineteenthcentury Italy. But although Guha adopts Gramsci’s categories, he is sceptical about ‘hegemony’. He doubts whether either the British colonial rulers or the national government of India have ever been able to establish a real hegemony in India.33 On the other hand he has no doubt about the urge of the ‘subalterns’ to assert their autonomy and to make their voices heard. There are methodological problems in this type of research, but at least the quest for giving expression to the sufferings and the hopes of the ‘subalterns’ has been of great heuristic value. The authors of the Subaltern Studies have used police reports and court cases as source material for their reconstructions of the ‘subaltern’ voice. They have also used the modern method of discourse analysis to penetrate the surface of colonial texts. Historians of other ex-colonies could learn a great deal from these studies which help to ‘decentre decolonization’. Parallel to the work of Subaltern Studies there has been the new venture of ‘post-colonial studies’. Whereas the scholars engaged in Subaltern Studies were interested in the muted voices of the lower classes, the ‘post-colonialists’ paid attention to the new African, Asian and Caribbean writers who expressed the quest for an identity which had been submerged by the colonial impact. The seminal work of Edward Said on Orientalism had stimulated ‘post-colonial studies’.34 Said had shown how the image of the ‘other’ projected by Western Orientalists had forced the ‘Orientals’ to think of themselves in terms constructed by scholars who served the colonial rulers. The anti-colonial freedom movements had fought for political self-determination, the ‘post-colonialists’ inspired by Said fought for the intellectual and spiritual self-determination of the people who had been subjected to colonial rule. Said was a professor of English literature and his methodology of discourse analysis naturally attracted the historians of literature who found a rich ﬁeld indeed in the creative writings of authors such as Chinua Achebe, Vidiadhar Naipaul, Ken Saro-Wiwa, Salman Rushdie, to mention just a few. But the more ardent post-colonialists have not been satisﬁed with this kind of work; they have launched an attack on historiography as a Western construct. Dane Kennedy has provided an insightful survey of post-colonialism in his article ‘Imperial History and Post-colonial Theory’.35 He has criticized the excesses of the post-colonialists but also recommends some of their work as a corrective to conventional imperial history. Cultural anthropologists have also made important contributions to postcolonial studies, sometimes without explicitly identifying themselves with post-colonialism. The work of Brackette F. Williams is a case in point; her study of the politics of cultural struggle in Guyana is a report on ﬁeld work among poor people but also a treatise on hegemony and the quest for identity.36 Her empirical work infuses her theoretical interpretations with a strong dose of realism which is often missing in the more rareﬁed contributions to post-colonial studies. In some respects, Williams’s work is akin to that of Mamdani mentioned earlier. 31\n\nCHRONOLOGY, BACKGROUND, HISTORIOGRAPHY\n\nThe future study of decolonization will embrace these various currents of historiography and add new dimensions to it. The old limitations of political history stressing the institutional aspects of the devolution of power will be overcome and the ‘cultural turn’ of the social sciences is bound to affect the study of decolonization.\n\n32\n\nMAPS\n\nMap 1 British India and princely states before independence\n\n33\n\nCHRONOLOGY, BACKGROUND, HISTORIOGRAPHY\n\nMap 2 a) Partitioning the Punjab; b) partitioning Bengal (Radcliffe Award, 1947)\n\nMap 3 Southeast Asia 34\n\nMAPS\n\nMap 4 South Paciﬁc\n\n35\n\nCHRONOLOGY, BACKGROUND, HISTORIOGRAPHY\n\nMap 5 The Arab world and black Africa\n\n36\n\nMap 6 The Commonwealth Caribbean\n\nII THEMES\n\nTHE CONTEXT OF DECOLONIZATION\n\nTHE DISINTEGRATION OF THE WORLD ECONOMY Decolonization was precipitated by the disintegration of the world economy during the period from 1914 to 1945 which was marked by the sequence war–depression–war. Before 1914 the dominant countries were linked in a kind of economic world federation of the gold standard.1 This federation had an unnofﬁcial capital, the City of London. According to economic doctrine, there was no monetary policy which supported the gold standard. The free ﬂow of gold automatically adjusted international prices. Prices would rise in the country which attracted gold and decline in the country which had to export it. This would lead to a reversal of the ﬂow in due course. The balance could be upset if a country which attracted gold decided to hoard it so as to maintain internal price stability. This is exactly what the USA did after the First World War. The war had put an end to the economic world federation of the gold standard, but then several countries adopted it again so as to restore the old stability. The USA, however, refused to follow the rules of the game and kept its gold locked up in Fort Knox. This was done for purely domestic reasons, but it deeply affected the world economy nevertheless. In the ‘golden age’before the First World War, the City of London could control the unofﬁcial world federation because it was the clearing house for all major ﬁnancial transactions and could maintain an uninterrupted ﬂow of gold. This also helped to secure the British empire although the majority of British investment was made outside the empire than within its conﬁnes. Interest payments on these investments were so enormous that they provided the City of London with the critical mass required for keeping the ‘world federation’ going. This was drastically changed by the First World War from which Great Britain emerged indebted to the USA as well as to its own people as it had contracted a huge internal war debt. Moreover, the interest payments on investment abroad were reduced to less than one-third of their former dimensions. In spite of this Great Britain returned to the gold standard in 1925 at the pre-war parity to the US dollar which it maintained only with great difﬁculties until it was forced to abandon the standard under the impact of the Great Depression in 1931. The vain attempt at reviving the gold standard after the First World War proved to be a distaster.2 The ‘Crumbling of Empire’was precipitated by the Great Depression, but at the same time the depression stiffened imperial resistance to decolonization. The 41\n\nTHEMES\n\ndepression years witnessed a contraction of international credit. Some countries defaulted on their debts, some devalued their currencies, others introduced strict exchange controls. The British economist Joan Robinson coined the term ‘beggar thy neighbour’ for the economic nationalism that prevailed in this period. Each sovereign state tried to improve its position at the cost of others. There was one exception: colonial governments could not default nor manipulate their currencies as they were controlled by their imperial rulers.3 The ﬁerce debates on the exchange rate of the Indian rupee and the action of the Secretary of State in dictating terms to the Government of India on behalf of the Bank of England in 1931 is a case in point.4 The focus of colonial rule was narrowed to the interest of the creditor in controlling the debtor. The access to colonies as suppliers of raw materials was no longer of importance as the Great Depression had led to such a steep fall in the prices of raw materials that anybody could buy them cheaply in the world market. Trade in these commodities declined in terms of value but not of volume during the years of the Great Depression. Since the control of trade in colonial commodities was no longer a lucrative affair, the metropolitan power"
