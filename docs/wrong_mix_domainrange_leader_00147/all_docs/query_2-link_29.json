He was also a Privy Councilor and knighted by the Queen in 1983. A lawyer by profession, he held a law degree from the University of London. He was both a Barrister of the Middle Temple and an attorney of the Bahamas Bar. Pindling led the Bahamas to black majority rule in 1967 and Independence in 1973. He was the longest elected leader in the Western Hemisphere. The popular prime minister emphasized public aid to education and the continued attraction of foreign investment, international banking and tourism. He fought vigorously for equal rights.
