The attacks could begin momentarily, and will apparently be focused on the western III Corps area. The Saigon delegation led by Vice President Ky is now in place in Paris, and an enlarged and strengthened Liberation Front delegation soon will be, but there is still little sign of an early breakthrough in the procedural deadlock that has delayed opening of the expanded talks. Even if the Communists were to become more flexible on seating arrangements and other procedural matters, the South Vietnamese seem set for a lengthy period of haggling to prevent the Liberation Front from achieving an independent position at the negotiating table. Indications continue to mount that North Korea may be planning to increase its actions against the South. One telling indicator is Pyongyang's recent appointment of one of its leading experts in unconventional warfare as minister of defense./ the North Koreans may now have between 20,00 an trame men organized and available for unconventional operations in the South. In Manila, President Marcos has made some personnel changes that seem as much intended to mend his fences with the US as to put himself on abetter footing for his campaign for re-election next year. Recent moves in this direction include the appointments of Carlos Romulo as foreign minister and Ernesto V. Lagdameo, a man generally acknowledged to be on good terms with the US president-elect, as the new ambassador to the US. The recent announcement by the outgoing foreign minister that the Philippines would undertake no new initiatives on the contentious Sabah issue until after the Malaysian elections next spring was probably also intended at least Page 1 SECRET Approved For Release 2008/08/20 :CIA-RDP79-00927A006800020001-7 Approved For Release 2008/08/20 :CIA-RDP79-00927A006800020001-7 sECRET ~JUngTau Lcrpitui Speezcs4 Zone SOCJ7H VIETNAM goo MILES ' SECRET Approved For Release 2008/08/20 :CIA-RDP79-00927A006800020001-7 Approved For Release 2008/08/20: CIA-RDP79-00927A006800020001-7 SECRET VIETNAM The Communists are completing preparations for renewed offensive action in widespread areas of South Vietnam. It is becoming increasingly clear that the main focal point of future enemy action is in III Corps. At present, signs of intensified Communist preparations to attack are espe- cially evident in the arc of provinces west and north of the capital city. the next route of the Communist's \"winter-spring\" campaign will begin in the second half of December. Increased enemy aggressive- ness, evident this week in stepped- up spellings and clashes with al- lied forces, could well be a pre- lude to a greater enemy effort throughout III Corps, possibly in concert with new enemy initia- tives elsewhere. Other potential battlefields in key sections of the country include the coastal areas of the northern provinces, the western highlands, and certain areas of the delta provinces. A new ag- gressiveness on the part of the Viet Cong in the delta during the past week suggests that they may now at least be prepared to offer greater resistance to al- lied forces attempting to dis- rupt their activities. Political Developments The South Vietnamese delega- tion departed for Paris on 7 De- cember after last-minute approval by the National Assembly of Presi- dent Thieu's decision to enter the Paris negotiations. Thieu and Vice President Ky appear to be fully agreed that the South Vietnamese delegation must be firm on procedural matters. Saigon believes that the North Vietnamese will try to take ad- vantage of a US desire for progress to extract concessions from the Americans that might affect the status of the Saigon government. The South Vietnamese are appar- ently prepared for lengthly proce- dural talks in order to prevent. the Liberation Front from achieving an independent position at the negotiating table. Meanwhile, some anti-Ky elements in Saigon are attempt- ing to undercut the Paris dele- gation in order to get at the vice president. Although Thieu may welcome a certain amount of criticism directed at his rival, he will probably try to keep it well enough in hand to prevent it from becoming a serious embar- rassment to the delegation as a whole, because the latter's performance will reflect on Thieu as well. Since the arrival of Saigon's delegation in Paris, Hanoi has SECRET Page 3 WEEKLY SUMMARY Approved For Release 2008/08/20: CIA-RDP79-00927A006800020001-7 Approved For Release 2008/08/20: CIA-RDP79-00927A006800020001-7 SECRET concentrated on discrediting al- lied procedural proposals. The Commnists have shown little will- ingness to compromise as they try to build-up the status of the Liberation Front. Hanoi's tough stance on prc, cedures is similar to the one the Communists took prior to the open- ing of the Paris talks. At that time, they maintained an inflexible position for several weeks and then suddenly proposed Paris as a compromise site. In the current procedural wrangle, the Communists seem to want a period during which they can try to discredit the US position and picture Saigon as reluctant to end the war. The Communists are continuing to prepare for substantive dis- cussions, however. On 11 Decem- ber, the Front announced appoint- ment of its first-string team for the Paris talks, to be led by the Front's top foreign affairs official. Madame Binh, who heads up the Front group now in Paris for the preliminaries, will even- tually become the deputy leader of the full delegation. P~ORTH KOREAN HARASSMENT OF SOUTH I~~AY INCREASE There are growing indica- tions that North Korea may be planning to expand its actions against South Korea. The North has appreciably improved its ca- pability for mounting infiltra- tion operations, and Pyongyang's propaganda has been claiming a growth of \"revolutionary resist- ance\" in the South. The considerable disruption caused by armed agent teams that landed on South Korea's east coast in late October and early November may encourage Pyongyang. Originally numbering 90 to 120, the intruders have managed to continue operations for over a month despite severe personnel losses and large-scale security SECRET Page 4 WEEKLY SUMMARY 13 Dec 68 Approved For Release 2008/08/20: CIA-RDP79-00927A006800020001-7 Approved For Release 2008/08/20: CIA-RDP79-00927A006800020001-7 forces deployed against them. In the process they have caused nearly 100 South Korean military and civilian casualties. North Korean paramilitary orces appear to have been expanded this year to over 20,000 men, including sig- nificantly increased personnel trained and available for uncon- ventional warfare operations in the South. Significantly, winter training has been a fea- ture of their preparation. Agent activity has heretofore been cur- tailed during the harsh winter months. The recent appointment of a leading unconventional war- fare expert--Choe Hyon, the fifth- ranking North Korean party mem- ber--to head the Defense Minis- try may be a further indication of the importance Pyongyang at- taches to guerrilla tactics. The South Koreans have re- acted sharply to the east coast landings, and the authorities have been quick to identify short-comings in the security forces' performance. Remedial measures, however, will take considerable time to become ef- fective. North Korea's program of armed harassment has also put President Pak Chong-hui under pressure from his supporters, particularly the military, to retaliate in kind. Over the tion.

Marcos appears to realize that he overplayed his hand in recent months by stimulating anti-US demonstrations and har- assing US activities in the Phil- ippines. Marcos' actions were prompted by Manila's displeas- ure over the US attitude toward the Philippine claim to Sabah. The Filipinos have now said that they will not make any more moves on their claim until after the Malaysian elections next spring. Marcos probably regards his appointment of Carlos Romulo as foreign secretary, in particular, as contributing toward good re- lations with the next US admin- istration. Romulo has long been involved in US-Philippine affairs, including two terms as ambassador in Washington. Marcos probably sees Romulo's blend of pro-Ameri- canism and nationalism as serving both to blunt the carping of Philippine supernationalists and to further Marcos' desire to mend fences with the US. At least two other recent appointments seem to have been made at least partly with an eye toward good relations. Philip- pine ambassador-designate to Washington, Ernesto V. Lagdameo, who was named after the US presi- dential election, is generally acknowledged to be a friend of the US president-elect. In ad- dition, Juan Ponce Enrile was transferred from commissioner of customs to secretary of justice. He was deeply involved in re- cent abrasive discussions with US officials concerning the impo- sition of fees on US military shipments into the Philippines. Marcos also encouraged the resignation of two cabinet mem- bers accused of malfeasance--a maneuver that may have been de- signed as much for its effect on US attitudes as for its impact on the Philippine electorate. Several other recent cabinet and subcabinet appointments appear to have been made only for their domestic political effect.

He has in- dicated no intention of relin- quishing any of his power. Hopes had been raised among former politicians that the mili- tary government was preparing to implement Ne Win's ambiguous promises when last month most of the remaining non-Communist po- litical prisoners were freed and the government convened an as- sembly of 33 civilian leaders. Ne Win quickly dampened any expectations for an early sharing of power, however. Although he cited the drafting of a consti- tution as the eventual aim of the consultations, he clamped a lid of secrecy on the proceedings and limited the scope of their activities. He reportedly im- pressed on the civilians that they had been summoned as indi- viduals, not as representatives of their banned political parties, and he warned them against ex- ploiting their consultations with the military government for po- litical purposes. He firmly re- iterated his commitment to his \"Burmese road to socialism.\" A government proclamation on 4 December formalized the gathering of civilian leaders as the \"Union of Burma Internal Unity Advisory Body.\" It was given about six months in which to come up with suggestions for promoting national unity and for a consti- tution \"to be drafted in the fu- ture.\" A second proclamation on 5 December invited similar ideas from the general public. The military government has given no assurances that any recommenda- tions would be acted upon, how- ever, and Ne Win clearly intends to set the pace for any moves toward constitutional ctovernment.

The published figures indicate a continuing rise in defense spend- ing and a relatively low rate of growth for industrial production. Brezhnev's speech to the plenum was not published, and he may have covered more than purely economic matters. Last weekend, the top three Soviet leaders met with Dubcek and other Czechoslovak officials in Kiev. Neither side has said much about the meeting officially, but enough has leaked out to suggest that once again the Soviets \"requested\" Dubcek to meet with them so they could approve the steps he planned to take at the Czechoslovak central committee meeting now under way. Most reports say that while the atmosphere was cordial, the Soviets took another tug on Prague's already tight leash. At home, Dubcek is finding it more and more difficult to maintain a unified leadership and rapport with the Czechoslovak population as he tries to operate within the ever narrower limits the Russians set. Some Eastern European diplomats believe he will not be able to stand the conflict inherent in trying to satisfy both the Soviets and his own people. Elsewhere in Eastern Europe there were signs of some lessening of tension. The Czechoslovaks and the Hungarians have met to discuss expanded economic cooperation-talks that had been broken off because of the Soviet invasion. Bulgaria has renewed its efforts to advance one of its pet policies-promotion of cooperation among the Balkan states, including Yugoslavia and Rumania. Rumania's Foreign Minister Manescu was in East Berlin, for what appears to be part of Bucharest's fence-mending with its more orthodox Eastern European partners. At the same time, the Rumanian minister of trade arrived in Moscow to conclude talks on next year's trade exchanges. Bucharest still has to work out detailed plans to implement its agree- ment with the Warsaw Pact to permit joint maneuvers in Rumania next year. No date has been set for the pact summit meeting at which this matter is likely to be discussed. 25X6 SECRET Approved For Release 2008/08/20 :CIA-RDP79-00927A006800020001-7 Approved For Release 2008/08/20: CIA-RDP79-00927A006800020001-7 SECRET MOSCOW REACTS WITH RESTRAINT TO US BLACK SEA OPERATIONS Soviet naval and air units kept the two US destroyers that cruised the Black Sea this week under close surveillance, but there was no attempt at harass- ment. The Soviet behavior was much the same as it was during a similar US naval demonstra- tion earlier this year, and considerably milder than in 1967 when, in addition to diplomatic protests, there was an attempted ramming. `Phe Soviet press reaction to the visit has not been as vehement as on past occasions although the operations were again labeled a violation of the Montreux Convention and a \"provocation.\" Pravda took the U5 to task for stirring up trouble in the. otherwise peace- ful Black Sea, but the article was brief and ~n an inside page. Soviet news media are still pay- ing far more attention to the recently created NATO maritime air force command in the Mediter- ranean. The USSR has sent only a pro forma diplomatic note to Turkey in this instance. In the past, Moscow has threatened to hold Ankara responsible if US destroyers were allowed to enter the Black Sea with what the Soviets charge is armament exceeding the .limitations set down in the Montreux Convention. The Soviets have especially ob- jected to US ships armed with antisubmarine rockets that are capable of carrying nuclear war- heads. One of the destroyers involved in this week's visit is so armed. The Soviets seldom miss an opportunity to play on Turkish domestic pressures against the American presence there, and they would especially like the Turks to lessen their NATO- sponsored military cooperation with the US. In this case, how- ever, P4oscow treated Ankara with kid gloves, describing Soviet- Turkish relations as an example of the \"cooperation and good neighborly relations\" that exist among Black Sea nations. The USSR may have decided that this approach was required as part of its effort t.o restore its image with its neighbors in the wake of the invasion of Czech- oslovakia. The low-key Soviet reaction to the visit of the destroyers is also consistent with a general predisposition to avoid stirring up a major flap with the US at this time. By and large, the Soviets have not wanted to com- promise any opportunities that remain for working with the present US administration or to prejudice relations with the new administration.

The party's main daily, Rude Pravo, reported on 9 December t~ at many local party organizations, in assessing the resolutions issued after the party plenum in Novem- ber, have demanded that they be given more information and have complained that the party is re- turning to making policy behind closed doors. Implicit in their\" outspoken criticisms is a demand that the party cease kowtowing to the Soviets. An explicit challenge to the Dubcek leadership occurred on 11 December when railway engineers threatened to strike. This, too,. had anti-Soviet overtones, for the engineers noted that the gov- ernment changed its mind on rec- ognizing their union after the Soviet invasion. The local party organiza- tions also echoed the widespread and continuing demands that the party and government protest the operation of the Soviet-sponsored newspaper Z rav and Radio Vltava. Dubcek had promised earlier that the party would approach the Soviets on this subject, and it may have been one topic of dis- cussion in Kiev. The two sides may also have discussed Prague's economic program and possible changes in the government. Al- though the communique issued af- ter the meeting stated that the talks had taken place in a \"cor- dial atmosphere\" and in a \"friendly spirit,\" there was no mention of the two sides agreeing on any topic. According to Rude Pravo, the talks in Kiev concerned bilateral economic and political coopera- tion, and the strengthening of ties within CEMA. The paper added that the two sides agreed that the resolutions passed at last month's party plenum created the \"preconditions\" for \"consoli- dating internal and foreign po- litical relations\"--cant indicat- ing that the Soviets are demand- ing continued obeisance from Prague. Moscow made this clearer on 12 December when Pravda stressed that Soviet--Czechoslo- vak relations are based on the principles of \"proletarian inter- nationalism\" and serve the cause of the \"socialist community.\" Rude Pravo suggested that the Czechoslovaks will continue to consult with the Soviets, indi- cating again the narrow limits within which Dubcek must operate. f Dubcek person- ~ly seems somewhat more self- confident, but will find it SECRET' Page 11 WEEKLY SUMMARY Approved For Release 2008/08/20: CIA-RDP79-00927A006800020001-7 Approved For Release 2008/08/20: CIA-RDP79-00927A006800020001-7 SECRET increasingly difficult to maneuver so as to satisfy both the Soviets and the Czechoslovak populace. Meanwhile, the party central committee convened in plenary ses- sion on 12 December to discuss economic policies and the estab- lishment of the Czech-Slovak fed- eral overnmen u the government of Premier Cernik may soon resign in order to facilitate the establishment of the federal .government, due to be formed on 1 January. Con- siderable political jockeying is likely as the various factions within the party try to improve their respective positions. Mos- cow offered still further support for Czechoslovak party conserva- tives on 12 December when it called upon the Dubcek regime to strengthen the party and state cadres with those \"who are loyal to Marxism-Leninism,\" and to wage a struggle against \"anti- socialist forces and revisionist tendencies.\" Josef Smrkovsky, a member of the presidium's executive coun- cil and one of the party's most outspoken proponents of reform, may soon be resigning. Smrkovsky ac- knowledged on 11 December t at he knew only what he read in the com- munique concerning the Kiev meet- ing. He denied that he would re- sign, however, and the tone of his remarks suggested that he was challenging the party to force him SECRET Page 12 WEEKLY SUMMARY 13 Dec 68 Approved For Release 2008/08/20: CIA-RDP79-00927A006800020001-7 25X1 Approved For Release 2008/08/20 :CIA-RDP79-00927A006800020001-7 ~e.~= a9e,,, ~oo~ Next 2 Page(s) In Document Denied Approved For Release 2008/08/20 :CIA-RDP79-00927A006800020001-7 Approved For Release 2008/08/20: CIA-RDP79-00927A006800020001-7 SECRET USSR ADOPTING ~~EW MEASURES AGAINST CRIME Recent measures taken by the Soviet government in the internal security area indicate that it is stepping up its campaign to main- tain law and order. On 28 November, Moscow an- nounced that the Ministry for the Protection cf Public Order (MOOP) had been renamed the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD). The res- toration of the former title, a symbol of Stalinist repression, is yet another indication of the conservative path the Soviet leaders are taking in domestic affairs. Although political crimes will undoubtedly remain the province of the Committee of State Security (KGB), the MVD may take over responsibility for investigating \"economic crimes,\" freeing the KGB's domestic forces for an even more vigorous effort against political dissi- dents . The militia--the uniformed police--evidently are to play a larger role in the crackdown against crime which, despite of- ficial disclaimers, seems to be on the rise, particularly among youth. Militiamen will get pay increases and .other career bene- fits, and a new recruitment drive is under way. The recruits will probably be drawn mainly from the party, Komsomol, and the most energetic among the volunteers serving in auxiliary law enforce- ment bodies, The most important of these vigilante organizations, the druzhina, will probably turn from patrolling the streets to such tasks as delivering lectures on public safety, In fact, the new measures may sound the death knell for the druzhina, a develop- ment that will please the USSR's professional law officers, who evidently have had little use for their amateur colleagues. The steps already taken dem- onstrate clearly that Moscow's present leaders intend to rely on coercion, rather than public opinion, in re-educating law- breakers . Meanwhile, several prominent Soviet jurists :have argued for the restoration of the justice minis- tries, which would be a fitting corollary to the MVD's rehabili- tation. Although their abolition strengthened the courts' inde- pendence vis-a-vis the state, it also left the courts more vulner- able to pressure from the party in the guise of \"public opinion.\" Re-establishing the ministries would add to the bureaucratiza- tion of Soviet justice and, in the long run, could impede the manipulation of the law by those who would use it as a political weapon .

In an effort to overcome their shortcomings, all of the countries are devoting scarce foreign exchange to the purchase of computers in the West. Sev- eral of the countries also are developing fledgling industries to produce their own computers. In mid-1968, Czechoslovakia pur- chased a license for production of computers from a French firm, The first computers used in Eastern Europe were installed only in scientific institutes. With an inventory now of nearly 700 computers, the emphasis is shift- ing to data-handling in industry, business, and government. Their total capacity, however, is far below that of such Western na- tions as France. About one third of the com- puters were produced locally, one half were imported from the free world (30 percent from the US), and about one sixth came from the USSR. There is little interest in acquiring Soviet computers because peripheral de- vices and software (operating systems and programs) are primi- tive, and service and spare parts are hard to obtain. The computer production in- dustry in Eastern Europe is in its infancy. Less than 50 ma- chines were produced in 1967, and no more than 70 are expected to be produced in 1968. As of mid-1968, only Poland, East Germany, and Czechoslovakia were engaged in commercial production, and Hungary was in the initial stages of producing a model. De- spite the reported contract with France, Rumanian production is still a long-range goal. None of the Eastern European countries expects to manufacture a full line of computer equipment in the foreseeable future. The machines produced now are mostly small and of obsolete design, SECRET Page lg WEEKLY SUMMARY 13 Dec 68 Approved For Release 2008/08/20: CIA-RDP79-00927A006800020001-7 25X1 Approved For Release 2008/08/20: CIA-RDP79-00927A006800020001-7 sECx~:~l~ inferior i:n speed and qual- ity to comparable free world prod- uct. At best, the industrially more advanced countries--East Ger- many, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary--can only hope to satisfy domestic needs for small- to medium- scale computers and to export some to other East European countries and the USSR. All requirements for large- scale computers will continue to be met for the indefinite future by importing available free world models. A considerably larger share of Eastern Europe's computers would be of free world origin ex- cept for stringent US export con- trols. In the past several years, however, the East Europeans have been able to acquire all but the largest and most powerful computers, the technology of which is still embargoed by trade controls. ~ 25X1 SECRET Page 19 WEEKLY SUMMARY Approved For Release 2008/08/20: CIA-RDP79-00927A006800020001-7 Approved For Release 2008/08/20 :CIA-RDP79-00927A006800020001-7 Approved For Release 2008/08/20 :CIA-RDP79-00927A006800020001-7 Approved For Release 2008/08/20 :CIA-RDP79-00927A006800020001-7 SJ~;CGltr;\"1' MIDDLE EAST -AFRICA Incidents along the Israeli-Jordanian border are on the increase again. Jordanian officials are reported to be fearful that the Iraqis might side with the fedayeen against any future effort by Amman to clamp down on the terrorist groups. An alliance of the 20,000 Iraqi troops in northern Jordan and the terrorists would have a good chance of toppling the govern- ment in Amman. The second round of Algerian-French economic negotiations has col- lapsed. One important side effect is the postponing until at least February of Foreign Minister Debre's visit to Algiers, which had tentatively been set for later this month. In the Nigerian civil war, the Biafrans have scored limited gains in the south and apparently have contained a federal offensive from the north. The Nigerian Air Force has been unsuccessful in its repeated attempts to knock out the Biafran arms supply airstrip. The British Government, under in- creasing parliamentary pressure to stop supplying arms to Nigeria, is again investigating the possibility of a negotiated settlement. Mali's new provisional military government is seeking aid from the West, but probably is also trying to obtain assurances some assistance will still be forthcoming from the East. The regime's pro-Western foreign minis- ter, fresh from aweek-long aid and good-will mission to Paris, has left for Moscow \"to explain the new situation created in Mali.\" Somali Premier Egal is having trouble maintaining his painfully worked out detente with Addis Ababa.

Another respected na- tional figure endorsed the opposition cause and incipient discontent was reported among middle-grade army officers. In India, the Congress Party was jarred by the loss of Haryana, the only state where the party had been able to regain power since the 1967 elections. Campaigning has begun for the important February elections in the four north Indian states now under direct rule from New Delhi, and a stable government in Haryana would have rovided a favorable model of Congress rule.

The 2d Division remains bogged down at Onitsha, where some Biafran forces apparently still oc- cupy parts of the outskirts of the town . The success of any federal of- fensive would almost certainly re- quire the interdicting of the Bia- fran arms supply airstrip at Ihiala.

In late November, the British Foreign Office told for- mer Nigerian president Azikiwe that it was willing to play any role it could in peace negotiations. There is no evidence, however, that Biafran leader Ojukwu would be any more conciliatory than in the 25X1 past, and federal leaders appear convinced that they can achieve a military victory. POLITICAL CHAOS STILL THE RULE IN SUDAN The serious illness of Prime Minister Mahjoub has left the Suda- nese Government mired in factional- ism and inertia. Unless he recovers soon the struggle to c oose a successor will accelerate the coun- try's downward spiral.

Major decisions have been put off indefinitely or simply ignored. On the question of restoration of re- lations with the US, neither those who favor the action nor those who oppose it have been willing to bring the matter to open discussion. In- evitably, the inaction and instabil- ity in Khartoum-have exacerbated the country's many internal prob- lems. The internecine butcrrery in the south has again intensified and what passes for the economy is in woeful condition. Mahjoub's primary qualifica- tion for the premiership was that he was relatively inoffensive to the disparate elements that make up the cabinet. The deputy premier, Sheikh Ali Abd al-Rahman, aside from being in the pay of Cairo, is generally unpopular, particu- larly with the more moderate cabi- net members. His Democratic Union- ist Party and the recently re- united Umma Party are desultorily maneuvering for a test of strength in the Constituent Assembly, which is still. the acting parlia- ment. If Mahjoub's prolonged ab- sence finally produces a no-con- fidence motion, the vote could go either way, presenting the prospect of yet another conten- tious cabinet and another com- promise premier. SEW THREATS RAISED TO ETHIOPIAN-SOMALI RELATIONS Irresponsible actions by ele- ments of both the Ethiopian and Somali armies point up the vulner- ability of Somali Prime Minister Egal's painfully arranged detente with Ethiopia. Trouble has again flared in the Somali-inhabited Ogaden re- gion. A senseless ambush of So- mali civilians by Ethiopian troops in mid-November is the most serious of a number of recent incidents demonstrating that army units are once again needlessly harassing Somali nomads. Currently, the Ethiopian Army is also executing an ill-timed government order to reimpose a livestock tax on nomads in certain areas, a move that in the past has provoked considerable resistance. Reinforcements al- ready have been moved to some lo- cations in anticipation of trouble. The Ogaden had been rela- tively quiet. In September, Egal secured significant concessions from Addis Ababa, ending the emer- gency regulations under which the region had been administered since 1964 and permitting rela- tivelX free movement by the nomads. These concessions seemed to Sr;cRErl~ Approved For Release 2008/08/20: CIA-RDP79-00927A006800020001-7 Approved For Release 2008/08/20: CIA-RDP79-00927A006800020001-7 SECRET indicate an Ethiopian willingness to ease tensions by restoring ci- vilian rule, but no further moves have been noted. Despite the ambush, there is no evidence to suggest any con- scious attempt by the Ethiopian military to sabotage- the detente by creating frictions in the Oga- den. Soldiers and armed nomads are mutually abrasive elements, and the central government's tradition- ally loose rein on the freewheel- ing army units in the area prac- tically guarantees further clashes. The latest incident took place on 6 December when Somali tribesmen attacked a locust control team and their military escort. Egal's opponents are exploit- ing the Ogaden incidents in the current parliamentary election campaign, and this publicity has limited his ability to deal with the problem. Under normal cir- cumstances,. he could probably smooth over such incidents as the ambush by private and direct deal- ings with Addis Ababa. If Egal is aware of General Siad's activi- ties, the pressures of the cam- 25X1 paign seem to have kept him from doing anything about them.

The first major disturbances in East Pakistan since the begin- ning of the current unrest broke out when pro-Peking leftists in- itiated a series of demonstra- tions and partially successful strikes to coincide with Ayub's week-long visit. Violence flared unexpectedly in Dacca on 7 Decem- ber when security forces were caught by surprise and fired on rioters, killing at least two. The authorities regained control after calling in the army. The potential for further disorders in the eastern wing re- mains high because the volatile East Pakistanis have many legiti- mate and exploitable grievances. All major opposition groups are backing the call for a strike on 13 December. The situation can probably be controlled as long as the usually effective East Pakistan security forces are ready. The massive demonstrations and occasional violence in West Pakistan have now given way to smaller, more disciplined marches. Although Ayub's announcement of certain concessions may have placated the dissidents somewhat, the government's enforcement of restrictions on public assembly and its use of force are probably equally responsible for toning down the demonstrations. Reports of incipient discon- tent among middle-grade military officers may indicate that poten- tially significant disenchantment with the government is also de- veloping within. the army--Ayub's most important element of support. Alleged favoritism within the mil- itary and widespread corruption in the government are apparently the main causes. Another popular national fig- ure has entered his name on the roster of the opposition. Follow- ing the example set by Asghar Khan, Lt. Gen. Mohammed Azam Khan-- former governor of East Pakistan and once a close associate of Ayub--criticized the government, declined to join any political party, and vowed to work for op- position unity. Azam's announce- ment was not unexpected. He has been a bitter foe of Ayub ever since the President dismissed him from the governorship, allegedly because of his popularity with the East Pakistanis. If Azam can revive that popularity, he may be able to overcome the disadvantage of his West Pakistani origins and attract substantial support in the essential eastern wing of the country. The extent to which Azam, Asghar, and the other new entries into opposition politics will be willing to make common cause to defeat Ayub remains un- SECRE'T' Page 26 WEEKLY SUMMARY 13 Dec 68 Approved For Release 2008/08/20: CIA-RDP79-00927A006800020001-7 Approved For Release 2008/08/20 :CIA-RDP79-00927A006800020001-7 SECRET WESTERN HEMISPHERE Government activity in Latin America is slowing down considerably as the holiday season draws near. The official results of the Venezuelan national elections were finally announced early this week. After three unsuccessful tries, Rafael Caldera of the Christian Democratic Party was elected president-but with only 29 percent of the vote. If Caldera is inaugurated on 12 March as expected, it will be the first time in Venezuelan history that political power has passed peacefully from one party to another, and only the second time that one democratically elected president has followed another into office. Guyana is moving ahead with its parliamentary elections set for 16 December. Prime Minister Burnham still has a very good chance of being re-elected, possibly with a clear majority. Charges by the opposition parties d d f orce that Burnham is rigging the elections have enlivened the campaign an the prime minister to defend his conduct. President Balaguer of the Dominican Republic has publicly said that he will permit exiled General Wessin, a key leader of the regular military during the 1965 revolt, to return before 10 January. Balaguer apparently is attempt- ing to forestall an illegal return by Wessin. Although Wessin would not pose an immediate threat to Balaguer, his return almost certainly would prove unsettling at a time when the political situation is somewhat strained.

If, as ex- pected, Caldera is inaugurated on 12 March, this will be the first time in Venezuelan history that power has passed peacefully from one political party to another and only the second time that one demo- cratically elected president has followed another into office. Caldera, an outstanding Roman Catholic layman, is politically, professionally, and socially one of the mos-t respected men in Venezuela. Despite attacks by leftist and right- ist extremists, he is generally con- sidered a political moderate. In many respects his administration will resemble the Democratic Action government of the past ten years, but ini- tially at least it will be marked by reformist zeal and a high degree of nationalism. The Democratic Ac- tion government's pe- troleum policies will certainly come under review. Caldera has promised a policy guar- anteeing Venezuela the largest possible bene- fit from its petroleum resources. He has pro- posed that fewer for- eign (i.e., US) tech- nicians be employed, and that profits be used to develop the general economy. His belief that there should be greater Vene- zuelan participation in manage- ment and that the industry should be \"Venezuelanized\" will probably cause some uneasiness among oil companies. It seems unlikely at this time, however, that he will push for outright nationalization, as occurred in Peru in October. In foreign affairs, Caldera has put high priority on the devel- opment of new markets for the na- tion's goods. The Betancourt doc- trine of nonrecognition of uncon- stitutional regimes in Latim Amer- ica will probably be dumped in fa- vor of commercial and diplomatic relations with all--except, appar- ently, Cuba--regardless of inter- nal policies. As for the highly volatile territorial dispute with Guyana, Caldera promises only to SECRET resolve it within the framework of friendship and understanding. The new Christian Democratic government may be a little less cor- dial toward the US. Ac- cording to pre-election statements, Caldera be- lieves US relations must be based on a revision of the commercial treaty between the two countries and an end to US re- strictions on petroleum imports from Venezuela. Nevertheless, Caldera hopes for warm relations with President-elect Nixon. On internal secu- rity, Caldera will meet present insurgency with Page 28 WEEKLY SUMMARY 13 De"
