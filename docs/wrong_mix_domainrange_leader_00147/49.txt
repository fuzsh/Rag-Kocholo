We are pleased to advise the public that as of 30th January, 2019 credit card facilities are now available at the Immigration Office at Lynden Pindling International Airport (LPIA) for all future permit payments necessary to the Bahamas Government.

Members of the public are urged to take advantage of this new initiative as this agency seeks to evolve with the modern world. In today’s economy credit cards are increasingly becoming the mode of payment, not only in The Bahamas but around the world. Accepting credit cards is not only convenient for customers, it offers them more choice, flexibility, safety in terms of traveling with cash and also improves processing speed.

Superintendent Juanita Armbrister, Officer-in-Charge at LPIA noted that credit card terminals are effective in the ease of conducting business with the general public and for the purpose of transparency. This is the Department’s intent at modernization of operations as we move toward e-government throughout the Public Service.

End.
