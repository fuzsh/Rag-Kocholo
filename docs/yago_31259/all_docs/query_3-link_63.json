Had she lived, whom would she have married? What impact would it have on the Habsburgs and their empire on a wider scale? Would another succession war occur or would she marry a Cousin or Uncle to avoid such a scenario? Could her survival have an impact on the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars? Etc.\n\nShe'd likely wed OTL Franz II or wind up like Auguste of Saxony (daughter of Friedrich August I) as \"too important to marry just anybody, but not important enough to be useful\".\n\nLeast this was the idea I got last time this thread was asked\n\nWhat if Archduchess Maria Theresa (born 1762) lived?\n\nShe had been the only child of HRE Joseph 2nd and thus I assume that she would inherit the Habsburg Empire, while her future husband would likely become HRE. Had she lived, whom would she have married? What impact would it have on the Habsburgs and their empire on a wider scale? Would another succession war occur or would she marry a Cousin or Uncle to avoid such a scenario? Could her survival have an impact on the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars? Etc.\n\nShe is highly unlikely to become empress.\n\nWhile the pragmatic sanction made it possible for woman to inherit the Habsburg territories, this was only possible after all male Habsburgs were dead (see OTL example, when Franz Joseph was not suceeded by either his granddaughter or daughters, but a more distant male relative). So it would require that all of her uncles and cousins died before her, and with no male issues of their own, an extremely unlikely conclussion.\n\nHe wouldn't HAVE to. However, it DOES raise an interesting \"problem\" regarding Hungary/Bohemia. Since Titi would've succeeded her dad as sovereign there (AFAIK). Ergo, Franz would succeed to Austria and the empire, but, unless he marries Titi, he doesn't get hungary/Bohemia. And in the dying years of Joseph II's reign, the Hungarians were already growing restless. So that MIGHT be a godsend in the long run if the Imperial and Hungarian thrones are separate inheritances\n\nThat is extremely interesting! And it was also one of the things that I hadn't understood. Should Joseph want his daughter to inherit Hungary and Bohemia separately from Austria and the HRE, then you could have an independent Hungary and Bohemia (albeit descended with a Habsburg maternal line) while Francis inherits Austria and the Habsburgs continue to reign there.\n\nHowever, I doubt that this would occur as it would reduce Austria's influence in Europe within a generation and make it another German state comparable to Saxony and Bavaria. While also making Prussia the most powerful German state."
