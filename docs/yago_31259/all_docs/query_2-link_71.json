        "text": "Written by Nancy Goldstone\n\nReview by Janice Ottersberg\n\nMaria Theresa—Holy Roman Empress, Queen of Hungary and Bohemia, Archduchess of Austria—was one of Europe’s greatest leaders of the 18th century. She brought unprecedented improvements that benefited all her subjects. Even Frederick the Great had to admit that she “executed plans worthy of a man of genius.” While being fully involved in governing and overseeing many wars including the Seven Years’ War, Maria Theresa gave birth to 16 children in 20 years, eleven daughters and five sons. The author focuses on Maria Theresa and three of her daughters, Maria Christina, Maria Carolina, Maria Antonia (Marie Antoinette). Maria Theresa arranged marriages for all her children that would benefit the Empire.\n\nMaria Christina along with her husband Albert of Saxony successfully ruled the Austrian Netherlands together. She was very close to her mother and was allowed to marry for love. Maria Carolina married Ferdinand IV and became Queen of Naples. Ferdinand preferred to hunt and womanize, so Maria Carolina took the reins and ruled Naples. Following in her mother’s footsteps, she gave birth to 17 children while governing. The more famous Marie Antoinette married Louis XVI, becoming Queen of France. While Louis XVI ineptly ruled, she luxuriated in riches and frivolities, taking a lover once she provided an heir to the throne. We know what followed as the Revolution took hold and spread tenacles throughout Europe.\n\nGoldstone has written a compelling, fascinating history of these remarkable women that is not only a well-researched scholarly work, but one that the average reader can enjoy reading. Writers can find a wealth of topics here, and readers will want to search out historical fiction of these women."
