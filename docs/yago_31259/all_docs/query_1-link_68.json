I dont really think that its a good idea to cling to royal status when ones' country has siad \"we dont want a royal family\".. but if he does do good work as a fomer member of the RF its acceptable...\n\nYes he is only Karl Habsbrug as the von is not allowed in Austria.

Is there for example also a forum about it on which you discuss it year round with other fans like TRF for all of us?\n\nGenuinely curious as while at times there are some nice songs, I have a hard time understanding the hype about it each year (they are definitely good at marketing, I will say that)."
