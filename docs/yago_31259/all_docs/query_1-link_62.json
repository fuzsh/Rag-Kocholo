        "text": "The Duchy of Bohemia was a monarchy and a principality of the Holy Roman Empire in Central Europe during the Early and High Middle Ages. It was formed around 870 by Czechs as part of the Great Moravian realm.\n\nThe Great Moravian realm was was the first major state that was predominantly West Slavic to emerge in the area of Central Europe, possibly including territories which are today part of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria, Germany, Poland, Romania, Croatia, Serbia and Ukraine.\n\nBohemia separated from disintegrating Great Moravia after Duke Spytihněv swore fealty to Arnulf of Corinthia, King of East Francia in 895. Arnulf of Corinthia was also the disputed King of Italy from 894 and the disputed Emperor from February 22, 896, until his death at Regensburg, Bavaria.\n\nBohemia was at first ruled by the Přemyslid Dynasty. The dynasty’s origin dates back to the 9th century, when the Přemyslids ruled a tiny territory around Prague, populated by a tribe of the Western Slavs. Gradually they expanded, conquering much of the region of Bohemia, located in the Bohemian basin where it was not threatened by the expansion of the Frankish Empire. The first historically-documented Přemyslid duke was Bořivoj I (867). DNA testing on the remains of his son, Spytihněv I, reveal the family’s Y-haplogroup to be R1b, second most common haplogroup in Czech republic.\n\nWhile the Bohemian dukes of the Přemyslid dyntasty, at first ruling at Prague Castle and Levý Hradec, brought further estates under their control, the Christianization initiated by Saints Cyril and Methodius was continued by the Frankish bishops of Regensburg and Passau. In 973, the Diocese of Prague was founded through the joint efforts of Duke Boleslaus II and Emperor Otto I the Great. Late Duke Wenceslaus I of Bohemia, killed by his younger brother Boleslaus in 935, became the land’s patron saint.\n\nWhile the lands were occupied by the Polish king Bolesław I and internal struggles shook the Přemyslid Dynasty, Duke Vladivoj received Bohemia as a fief from the hands of Emperor Heinrich II in 1002 and the duchy became an Imperial State of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nThe Přemyslids remained in power throughout the High Middle Ages, until the extinction of the male line with the death of King Wenceslaus III in 1306.\n\nAlthough some former rulers of Bohemia had enjoyed a non-hereditary royal title during the 11th and 12th centuries (Vratislaus II, Vladislaus II), the kingdom was formally established in 1198 by Přemysl Ottokar I, who had his status acknowledged by Philipp of Swabia, elected King of the Romans, in return for his support against the rival Emperor Otto IV.\n\nIn 1204 Ottokar’s royal status was accepted by Otto IV as well as by Pope Innocent III. It was officially recognized in 1212 by the Golden Bull of Sicily issued by Emperor Friedrich II, elevating the Duchy of Bohemia to Kingdom status and proclaiming its independence which was also later bolstered by future king of Bohemia and emperor Charles IV, with his golden bull in 1356.\n\nUnder these terms, the King of Bohemia was to be exempt from all future obligations to the Holy Roman Empire except for participation in the imperial councils. The imperial prerogative to ratify each Bohemian ruler and to appoint the bishop of Prague was revoked. The king’s successor was his son Wenceslaus I, from his second marriage.\n\nThe King of Bohemia was a Prince-Elector of the Empire. The Kings of Bohemia, besides the region of Bohemia itself, also ruled other lands belonging to the Bohemian Crown, which at various times included Moravia, Silesia, Lusatia, and parts of Saxony, Brandenburg, and Bavaria.\n\nThe Kingdom of Bohemia was later ruled by the House of Luxembourg, the Jagiellonian Dynasty, and from 1526 the House of Habsburg and its successor, the House of Habsburg-Lorraine. From 1526 until the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved in 1806, the Kingdom of Bohemia was part of the greater Habsburg Hereditary Lands.\n\nNumerous kinrgs of Bohemia were also elected Holy Roman Emperors, and the capital, Prague, was the imperial seat in the late 14th century, and again at the end of the 16th and the beginning of the 17th centuries.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the territory became part of the Habsburg Austrian Empire, and subsequently the Austro-Hungarian Empire from 1867. Bohemia retained its name and formal status as a separate Kingdom of Bohemia until 1918, known as a Crown Land within the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and its capital Prague was one of the empire’s leading cities.\n\nThe Czech language (called the Bohemian language in English usage until the 19th century) was the main language of the Diet and the nobility until 1627 (after the Bohemian Revolt was suppressed).\n\nGerman was then formally made equal with Czech and eventually prevailed as the language of the Diet until the Czech National Revival in the 19th century. German was also widely used as the language of administration in many towns after the Germans immigrated and populated some areas of the country in the 13th century. The royal court used the Czech, Latin, and German languages, depending on the ruler and period.\n\nFollowing the defeat of the Central Powers in World War I, both the Kingdom and Empire were dissolved. Bohemia became the core part of the newly formed Republic of Czechoslovakia.\n\nIn 1989, as Marxist–Leninist governments and communism were ending all over Central and Eastern Europe, Czechoslovakia peacefully deposed their communist government during the Velvet Revolution, which began on November 17, 1989 and ended 11 days later on November 28th when all of the top Communist leaders and Communist party itself resigned. On December 31, 1992 Czechoslovakia peacefully split into the two sovereign states of the Czech Republic and Slovakia.\n\nThe Emperor of Austria was the ruler of the Austrian Empire and later the Austro-Hungarian Empire from 1867 onward. The hereditary imperial title and office was proclaimed on August 11, 1804 by Holy Roman Emperor Franz II, a member of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, and continually held by him and his heirs until Emperor Charles I-IV relinquished power in 1918. Emperor Charles I-IV never technically abdicated.\n\nThe Emperors of Austria retained the title of Archduke of Austria. The wives of the Emperors held the title Empress, while other members of the family held the titles of Archduke or Archduchess,with the styles His or Her Imperial Highness.\n\nPredecessors\n\nMembers of the House of Austria, the Habsburg Dynasty, had been the elected Holy Roman Emperors since 1438 (except for a five-year break from 1740 to 1745) and mostly resided in Vienna. Thus the term “Austrian Emperor” may occur in texts dealing with the time before 1804, when no Austrian Empire existed.\n\nIn these cases the word Austria means the composite monarchy ruled by the Habsburg dynasty, not the country. Therefore prior to August 11, 1804 it would be incorrect to refer to the Holy Roman Emperor as the “Emperor of Austria” despite the fact as previously mentioned that the Emperor made his home in Vienna the capital of the Archduchy of Austria for centuries.\n\nA special case was Empress Maria Theresa. She did not bare the Imperial Title as an Empress in her own right. She was not an Empress Regnant. She was an Empress Consort as the wife of Holy Roman Emperor Franz I (r. 1745–1765).\n\nHowever, Empress Maria Theresa was a Queen Regnant herself as the reigning monarch of the Austrian Hereditary Lands which included the Kingdoms of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia. She was also the reigning Archduchess of Austria.\n\nThe Holy Roman Empire adhered to the Salic Law which barred women from inheriting the Imperial Title or passing on succession rights to her children.\n\nHer father, Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI, King of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia and Archduke of Austria, promulgated the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 which allowed his eldest daughter, Archduchess Maria Theresa, to inherit the Habsburg Hereditary Lands, also known as the Composite Monarchy, in her own right.\n\nNot all member states of the Holy Roman Empire acknowledged the Pragmatic Sanction so when Emperor Charles VI died in 1740 and Archduchess Maria Theresa inherited the Crowns of the Hereditary Habsburg Lands it sparked the War of the Austrian Succession.\n\nCharles Albrecht, the Prince-Elector of Bavaria, was a son-in-law of Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor, (Charles Albrecht was married to Emperor Joseph’s daughter, Archduchess Maria Amalia of Austria) and he rejected the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 and claimed the German territories of the Habsburg dynasty for himself via by right of his wife, after the death of Emperor Charles VI in 1740. Prior to Emperor Charles VI enacting the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 the plan was to have the eldest daughter of Emperor Joseph I inherit the Habsburg Hereditary Lands.\n\nThis meant, Charles Albrecht’ wife, Archduchess Maria Amalia of Austria was set to inherit the Habsburg Hereditary Lands. However, instead of her claiming her inheritance the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 bypassed Archduchess Maria Amalia and the Hereditary Habsburg Lands went to Emperor Charles VI’s daughter, Archduchess Maria Theresa, instead.\n\nDuring the War of the Austrian Succession, Prince-Elector Charles Albrecht invaded Upper Austria in 1741 and planned to conquer Vienna, but his allied French troops under the Duc de Belle-Isle were instead redirected to Bohemia, and the capital, Prague, was subsequentially conquered in November 1741.\n\nThat meant that Prince-Elector Charles Albrecht of Bavaria was crowned King of Bohemia in Prague on December 19, 1741, when the Habsburgs had not yet been defeated. He was unanimously elected “King of the Romans” on January 24, 1742 and became Holy Roman Emperor as Emperor Charles VII upon his coronation on February 12, 1742.\n\nEmperor Charles VII died on January 20, 1745 . He was succeeded by François, Duke of Lorraine the fourth (but oldest surviving) son of Leopold, Duke of Lorraine, and the French princess Élisabeth Charlotte d’Orléans. François (Franz) was married to Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria on February 14, 1736.\n\nIn the Treaty of Füssen, Queen Maria Theresa secured the election of her husband as Holy Roman Emperor, which took place on September 13, 1745. Maria Theresa made her husband co-regent of her hereditary dominions. In practice Emperor Franz had little influence or authority over the Empire as the States of the Empire had considerable autonomy and in the Hereditary Habsburg Lands Maria Theresa’s rule was near absolute.\n\nBirth of the Empire of Austria\n\nIn the face of aggressions by Napoleon I, who had been proclaimed “Emperor of the French” by the French constitution on May 18, 1804 Holy Roman Emperor Franz II feared for the future of the Holy Roman Empire and wished to maintain his and his family’s Imperial status in case the Holy Roman Empire should be dissolved.\n\nTherefore, on August 11, 1804 he created the new title of “Emperor of Austria” which United the Habsburg Hereditary Lands into one singular state. The creation of the title Emperor of Austria was not only for himself, but also for his successors as heads of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine. For two years Emperor Franz II carried two imperial titles: being Holy Roman Emperor and “by the Grace of God”, Emperor Franz I of Austria.\n\nIn 1805, an Austrian-led army suffered a humiliating defeat at the Battle of Austerlitz and the victorious Napoleon proceeded to dismantle the old Reich (which at this time was only a powerless confederation) by motivating or pressuring several German princes to enter the separate Confederation of the Rhine with their lands in July.\n\nThis led Emperor Franz II-I to declare the Holy Roman Empire dissolved on August 6, 1806. This meant Emperor Franz to lay down the Imperial Crown created in the second half of the 10th century for Emperor Otto I the Great in 962.\n\nFrom 1806 onwards, Franz was Emperor of Austria only until his death in 1835. He had three successors—Ferdinand I (1835 – 1848), Franz Joseph I (1848 – 1916) and Charles I-IV, from 1916 until the Empire broke apart in 1918.\n\nA coronation ceremony was never established; the heir to the throne became Emperor the moment his predecessor died or abdicated. The symbol of the Austrian Emperor was the dynasty’s private crown dating back to Holy Roman Emperor Rudolph II (r. 1576–1612).\n\nAustria-Hungary\n\nAustria-Hungary allowed formation of a Polish quasi-government, the Supreme National Committee, and had three different ideas regarding Poland. One, the “Austro-Polish Solution”, involved the creation of a Polish kingdom under the Emperor of Austria, who, among his other titles, was already King of Galicia and Lodomeria. German and Magyar (Hungarian) elements within the Habsburg monarchy opposed such a move for fear of creating a predominantly Slavic area.\n\nUnlike Emperor Franz Joseph, however, Emperor Charles I of Austria, who had acceded to the Habsburg thrones in 1916, promoted the idea. The other two ideas involved the division of the former Congress Poland between Germany and Austria-Hungary, or between Austria-Hungary and a state built from Lithuania, Belarus and the remnants of Congress Poland to create a new version of the 1795 dissolved Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.\n\nThe Habsburg candidate\n\nOf the candidates for the new Polish throne, Archduke Charles Stephen of Austria (1860 – 1933) and his son Archduke Charles Albrecht (1888 – 1951) were early contenders. Both resided in the Galician town of Saybusch (now Żywiec) and spoke Polish fluently. Charles Stephen’s daughters were married to the Polish aristocrats Princes Czartoryski and Radziwiłł.\n\nArchduke Charles Stephen of Austria was born at the castle of Gross Seelowitz in Moravia (today Židlochovice near Brno in the Czech Republic), the son of Archduke Charles Ferdinand of Austria 1818–1874, himself son of Archduke Charles of Austria, Duke of Teschen; and of his wife Archduchess Elisabeth Franziska of Austria (1831–1903), the daughter of Palatine Joseph of Hungary, Archduke of Austria (1776–1847) and his third wife Maria Dorothea of Württemberg (1797–1855).\n\nOn February 28, 1886 at Vienna, Charles Stephen married Archduchess Maria Theresia, Princess of Tuscany, she was the daughter of Archduke Charles Salvator of Austria, Prince of Tuscany and his wife Princess Maria Immaculata of Bourbon-Two Sicilies. The ceremony took place in the Hofburg and was witnessed by Cardinal Ganglbauer.\n\nTheir son, Archduke Charles Albrecht of Austria, was a landowner in Żywiec, a colonel of artillery in both the Imperial Austro-Hungarian Army (cavalry) and the Polish Army, and the 1,175th knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1910.\n\nIn 1918 and again in 1939 he became a volunteer in the Polish army. He fought in the Polish–Soviet War. In 1920, he commanded the Grudziądz Fortress. During the German occupation of Poland, he declared Polish nationality and refused to sign the Volksliste. He was imprisoned in November 1939, kept in Cieszyn[citation needed] and tortured by the Gestapo. His wife was interned in Wisła. He left prison blind in one eye and half-paralyzed. In October 1942, Albrecht and his family were sent to a labor camp in Strausberg. After liberation, he moved to Kraków and then to Sweden. His estate was confiscated in 1939 by the invading Germans, and again in 1945 by the Polish People’s Republic.\n\nFamily and children\n\nOn November 8, 1920 he married morganatically Alice Elisabeth Ankarcrona (born at Tullgarn, near Trosa, December 18, 1889 and died at Saltsjöbaden, near Stockholm, November 26, 1985) in the castle of Żywiec Poland. She was a daughter of Oscar Carl Gustav Ankarcrona and his wife, Anna Carleson. The head of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine accorded her the hereditary title of “Princess of Altenburg” on December 15, 1949.\n\nAccording to Polish historian Janusz Pajewski “the Austrians had underestimated Germany’s desire to determine Poland’s fate”. They did recognise, according to Prime Minister Karl von Stürgkh, that “Poles will remain Poles […] even 150 years after Galicia was joined to Austria, Poles still didn’t become Austrians”.\n\nAfter Germany’s 1918 Spring Offensive had failed to win the war on the Western front, General Ludendorff in September proposed seeking peace based on the plan outlined by U.S. President Wilson in January 1918 in his Fourteen Points, which in regard to Poland demanded the creation of an “independent Polish state … guaranteed by international covenant” with “free and secure access to the sea”. On October 3, the new German Chancellor, Prince Max of Baden, announced Germany’s acceptance of Wilson’s plan and immediate disestablishment of military administration in the countries occupied by Germany.\n\nIn spite of the initial total dependence of this client state on its sponsors, it ultimately served against their intentions in the aftermath of the Armistice of November 11, 1918 as the cornerstone proto-state of the nascent Second Polish Republic, the latter composed also of territories never intended by the Central Powers to be ceded to Poland, and therefore played a crucial role in the resurrection of Polish statehood.\n\nOn November 16, 1918, Piłsudski sent a radio telegram to “Mr President of the United States, the Royal English Government, the Government of the French Republic, the Royal Italian Government, the Imperial Japanese Government, the Government of the German Republic, as well as the governments of all the warring or neutral states”, notifying them about the establishment of an independent Polish State, named in the telegram as the Polish Republic.\n\nOn November 17, both the newly designated prime minister Daszyński and the provisional government of Wróblewski resigned in favour of the new Moraczewski government, finally ending the governmental diarchy. Therefore, either November 14, or November 17, may both be considered the final day of kingdom’s existence. The transition to republican government was formally completed through the decree of November 22, 1918 on the supreme representational authority of the Polish Republic, which stipulated assumption by Piłsudski of the interim office of chief of state.\n\nThe Kingdom of Poland, also known informally as the Regency Kingdom of Poland, was a short-lived polity that was proclaimed during World War I by the German Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire on November 5, 1916 on the territories of the formerly Russian-ruled Congress Poland held by the Central Powers as the Government General of Warsaw and became active on January 14, 1917.\n\nThis Kingdom was to be a puppet state that was to provide a buffer both geographically and politically between the Empires of Germany and Austria-Hungary and the Russian Empire. It would be the first reappearance of Poland on the map of Europe after it had been carved up to other nations.\n\nPoland had disappeared from the map of Europe with the Partitions of Poland when three partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth took place toward the end of the 18th century and ended the existence of the state, resulting in the elimination of sovereign Poland and Lithuania for 123 years. The partitions were conducted by the Habsburg monarchy, the Kingdom of Prussia, and the Russian Empire, which divided up the Commonwealth lands among themselves progressively in the process of territorial seizures and annexations.\n\nThe First Partition was decided on August 5, 1772 after the Bar Confederation lost the war with Russia. The Second Partition occurred in the aftermath of the Polish–Russian War of 1792 and the Targowica Confederation of 1792 when Russian and Prussian troops entered the Commonwealth and the partition treaty was signed during the Grodno Sejm on January 23, 1793 (without Austria). The Third Partition took place on October 24, 1795, in reaction to the unsuccessful Polish Kościuszko Uprising the previous year. With this partition, the Commonwealth ceased to exist.\n\nRationale\n\nThe decision to propose the restoration of Poland after a century of partitions was taken up by the German policymakers in an attempt to legitimize further imperial presence in the occupied territories and create a buffer state to prevent future wars with Russia. The plan was followed by the German propaganda pamphlet campaign delivered to the Poles in 1915, claiming that the German soldiers were arriving as liberators to free Poland from subjugation by the Russian Empire.\n\nHowever, the German High Command under Erich Ludendorff also wanted to annex around 30,000 square kilometers of the territory of former Congress Poland, and planned to evict up to 3 million Poles and Jews to make room for German colonists in the so-called Polish Border Strip plan. The German government used punitive threats to force Polish landowners living in the German-occupied Baltic states to relocate and sell their Baltic property to the Germans in exchange for entry to Poland. Parallel efforts were made to remove Poles from Polish territories of the Prussian Partition.\n\nGermany\n\nWith onset of war in 1914, for the purposes of securing Germany’s eastern border against the Russian imperial army, Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, the German chancellor, decided on the annexation of a specific strip of land from Congress Poland, known later on as the Polish Border Strip. In order to avoid adding the Polish population there to the population of imperial Germany, it was proposed that the Poles would be ethnically cleansed to a proposed new Polish state further east, while the strip would be resettled with Germans.\n\nGerman Emperor Wilhelm II conceived of creating a dependent Polish state from territory conquered from Russia. This new autonomous Kingdom of Poland would be ruled by a German prince and have its military, transportation, and economy controlled by Germany. Its army and railway network would be placed under Prussian command.\n\nArchduke (feminine: Archduchess) was the title borne from 1358 by the Habsburg rulers of the Archduchy of Austria, and later by all senior members of that dynasty. It denotes a rank within the former Holy Roman Empire (962–1806), which was below that of Emperor and King, roughly equal to Grand Duke, but above that of a Prince and Duke.\n\nThe territory ruled by an Archduke or Archduchess was called an Archduchy. All remaining Archduchies ceased to exist in 1918. The current head of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine is Archduke Karl von Habsburg.\n\nTerminologyThe English word is first recorded in 1530, derived from Middle French archeduc, a 15th-century derivation from Medieval Latin archidux, from Latin archi- (Greek ἀρχι-) meaning “authority” or “primary” (see arch-) and dux “duke” (literally “leader”).\n\n“Archduke” is a title distinct from “Grand Duke” a later monarchic title borne by the rulers of other European countries, such as Luxembourg for example.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Latin title archidux is first attested in reference to Bruno the Great, who ruled simultaneously as Archbishop of Cologne and Duke of Lotharingia in the 10th century, in the work of his biographer Ruotger. In Ruotger, the title served as an honorific denoting Bruno’s unusual position rather than a formal office.\n\nThe title was not used systematically until the 14th century, when the title “Archduke of Austria” was invented in the forged Privilegium Maius (1358–1359) by Duke Rudolph IV of Austria. Rudolph originally claimed the title in the form palatinus archidux (“palatine archduke”).\n\nThe title was intended to emphasize the claimed precedence (thus “Arch-“) of the Duchy of Austria, in an effort to put the Habsburgs on an even level with the Prince-Electors of the Holy Roman Empire, as Austria had been passed over when the Golden Bull of 1356 assigned that dignity to the four highest-ranking secular Imperial princes and three Archbishops.\n\nHoly Roman Emperor Charles IV refused to recognize the title, as did all the other ruling dynasties of the member countries of the Empire. But Duke Ernst the Iron and his descendants unilaterally assumed the title of Archduke.\n\nThe Archducal title was only officially recognized in 1453 by Emperor Friedrich III, when the Habsburgs had solidified their grip on the throne of the de jure elected Holy Roman Emperor, making it de facto hereditary.\n\nDespite that imperial authorization of the title, which showed a Holy Roman Emperor from the Habsburg dynasty deciding over a title claim of the Habsburg dynasty, many ruling dynasties of the countries which formed the Empire refused to recognize the title “Archduke”.\n\nLadislaus the Posthumous, Duke of Austria, who died in 1457, never in his lifetime had the imperial authorization to use it, and accordingly, neither he nor anyone in his branch of the dynasty ever used the title.\n\nEmperor Friedrich III himself simply used the title “Duke of Austria”, never Archduke, until his death in 1493. The title was first granted to Friedrich’s younger brother, Albrecht VI of Austria (d. 1463), who used it at least from 1458.\n\nIn 1477, Friedrich III also granted the title of Archduke to his first cousin, Sigismund of Austria, ruler of Further Austria. Friedrich III’s son and heir, the future Emperor Maximilian I, started to use the title, but apparently only after the death of his wife Mary of Burgundy (d. 1482), as Archduke never appears in documents issued jointly by Maximilian and Mary as rulers in the Low Countries (where Maximilian is still titled “Duke of Austria”).\n\nThe title appears first in documents issued under the joint rule of Maximilian and his son Philipp of Burgundy (Felipe I of Castile) in the Low Countries.\n\nArchduke was initially borne by those dynasts who ruled a Habsburg territory—i.e., only by males and their consorts, appanages being commonly distributed to cadets. But these “junior” archdukes did not thereby become sovereign hereditary rulers, since all territories remained vested in the Austrian crown. Occasionally a territory might be combined with a separate gubernatorial mandate ruled by an archducal cadet.\n\nUsage\n\nFrom the 16th century onward, “Archduke” and its female form, “Archduchess”, came to be used by all the members of the House of Habsburg (e.g. Queen Marie Antoinette of France was born Archduchess Maria Antonia of Austria).\n\nUpon extinction of the male line of the Habsburgs and the marriage of their heiress, the Holy Roman Empress-Consort Maria Theresa, Queen of Hungary, Bohemia and Croatia and Archduchess of Austria, to Franz Stefan, Duke of Lorraine, who was elected Holy Roman Emperor, their descendants formed the House of Habsburg-Lorraine.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire this usage was retained in the Austrian Empire (1804–1867) and the Austro-Hungarian Empire (1867–1918).\n\nThe official use of titles of nobility and of all other hereditary titles, including Archduke, has been illegal in the Republic of Austria for Austrian citizens since the Law on the Abolition of Nobility (April 3, 1919).\n\nThus those members of the Habsburg family who are residents of the Republic of Austria are simply known by their first name(s) and their surname Habsburg-Lothringen. However, members of the family who reside in other countries may or may not use the title, in accordance with laws and customs in those nations.\n\nFor example, Otto Habsburg-Lothringen (1912–2011), the eldest son of the last Habsburg Emperor, was an Austrian, Hungarian and German citizen. As he lived in Germany, where it is permitted to use hereditary titles as part of the civil surname (including indications of origin, such as von or zu), his official civil name was Otto von Habsburg (literally: Otto of Habsburg), whereas in Austria he was registered as Otto Habsburg.\n\nThe King of Spain also bears the nominal title of Archduke of Austria as part of his full list of titles, as the Bourbon dynasty adopted all the titles previously held by the Spanish Habsburgs when they took over the Spanish throne.\n\nHowever, “Archduke” was never considered by the Spanish Bourbons as a substantial dignity of their own dynasty, but rather as a traditional supplementary title of the Spanish Kings since the days of the Habsburg dynasty on the royal throne (1516–1700).\n\nHence, no member of the royal family other than the King of Spain bears the (additional) title of “Archduke”.\n\nOn the day of the Armistice of November 11, 1918, Charles issued a carefully worded proclamation in which he recognized the Austrian people’s right to determine the form of the state and “relinquish[ed] every participation in the administration of the State.” He also released his officials from their oath of loyalty to him. On the same day, the Imperial Family left Schönbrunn Palace and moved to Castle Eckartsau, east of Vienna. On November 13, following a visit with Hungarian magnates, Charles issued a similar proclamation—the Eckartsau Proclamation—for Hungary.\n\nCharles I-IV\n\nCharles I-IV\n\nAlthough it has widely been cited as an “abdication”, the word itself was never used in either proclamation. Indeed, he deliberately avoided using the word abdication in the hope that the people of either Austria or Hungary would vote to recall him. Privately, Charles left no doubt that he believed himself to be the rightful emperor. He wrote to Friedrich Gustav Piffl, the Archbishop of Vienna: “I did not abdicate, and never will […] I see my manifesto of November 11, as the equivalent to a cheque which a street thug has forced me to issue at gunpoint […] I do not feel bound by it in any way whatsoever.”\n\nInstead, on November 12, the day after he issued his proclamation, the independent Republic of German-Austria was proclaimed, followed by the proclamation of the First Hungarian Republic on November 16. An uneasy truce-like situation ensued and persisted until March, 23 to 24, 1919, when Charles left for Switzerland, escorted by the commander of the small British guard detachment at Eckartsau, Lieutenant Colonel Edward Lisle Strutt.\n\nAs the imperial train left Austria on March 24, 1919, Charles issued another proclamation in which he confirmed his claim of sovereignty, declaring that “whatever the national assembly of German Austria has resolved with respect to these matters since November 11, 1918 is null and void for me and my House.” The newly established republican government of Austria was not aware of this “Manifesto of Feldkirch” at this time—it had been dispatched only to King Alfonso XIII of Spain and to Pope Benedict XV through diplomatic channels—and politicians in power were irritated by the Emperor’s departure without explicit abdication.\n\nThe Austrian Parliament responded on April 3, with the Habsburg Law, which dethroned and banished the Habsburgs. Charles was barred from ever returning to Austria. Other male Habsburgs could only return if they renounced all intentions of reclaiming the throne and accepted the status of ordinary citizens. Another law passed on the same day abolished all nobility in Austria. In Switzerland, Charles and his family briefly took residence at Castle Wartegg near Rorschach at Lake Constance, and later moved to Château de Prangins at Lake Geneva on May 20.\n\nAttempts to reclaim throne of Hungary\n\nCharles sought twice in 1921 to reclaim the throne of Hungary, but failed largely because Hungary’s regent, Admiral Miklós Horthy (the last commander of the Imperial and Royal Navy), refused to support Charles’ restoration. Horthy’s action was declared “treasonous” by royalists. Critics suggest that Horthy’s actions were more firmly grounded in political reality than those of Charles and his supporters. Indeed, neighbouring countries had threatened to invade Hungary if Charles tried to regain the throne. Later in 1921, the Hungarian parliament formally nullified the Pragmatic Sanction, an act that effectively dethroned the Habsburgs.\n\nAfter the second failed attempt at restoration in Hungary, Charles and his pregnant wife Zita were arrested and quarantined at Tihany Abbey. On November 1, 1921 they were taken to the Hungarian Danube harbour city of Baja, were taken onboard the monitor HMS Glowworm, and there removed to the Black Sea where they were transferred to the light cruiser HMS Cardiff.\n\nOn November 19, 1921 they arrived at their final exile, the Portuguese island of Madeira. Determined to prevent a third restoration attempt, the Council of Allied Powers had agreed on Madeira because it was isolated in the Atlantic Ocean and easily guarded.\n\nThe couple and their children, who joined them on February 2, 1922, lived first at Funchal at the Villa Vittoria, next to Reid’s Hotel, and later moved to Quinta do Monte. Compared to the imperial glory in Vienna and even at Eckartsau, conditions there were certainly impoverished.\n\nCharles did not leave Madeira. On March 9, 1922 he had caught a cold in town, which developed into bronchitis and subsequently progressed to severe pneumonia. Having suffered two heart attacks, he died of respiratory failure on April 1, in the presence of his wife (who was pregnant with their eighth child) and nine-year-old former Crown Prince Otto, remaining conscious almost until his last moments.\n\nHis last words to his wife were “I love you so much.” His remains except for his heart are still on the island, resting in state in a chapel devoted to the Emperor in the Church of Our Lady of The Hill (Igreja de Nossa Senhora do Monte), in spite of several attempts to move them to the Habsburg Crypt in Vienna. His heart and the heart of his wife are entombed in Muri Abbey, Switzerland.\n\nElisabeth of Bavaria (December 24, 1837 – September 10, 1898) was Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary by marriage to Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria.\n\nBorn Elisabeth Amalie Eugenie in Munich, Bavaria, she was the fourth child of Duke Maximilian Joseph in Bavaria and Princess Ludovika of Bavaria, the half-sister of King Ludwig I of Bavaria. Nicknamed Sisi, she enjoyed an informal upbringing before marrying Emperor Franz Joseph I at the age of sixteen. The marriage thrust her into the much more formal Habsburg court life, for which she was unprepared and which she found uncongenial. She came to develop a deep kinship with Hungary, and helped to bring about the dual monarchy of Austria–Hungary in 1867.\n\nEmperor Franz Joseph I of Austria\n\nThe death of her only son, Crown Prince Rudolph of Austria, and his mistress Mary Vetsera, in a murder–suicide at his hunting lodge at Mayerling in 1889 was a blow from which Elisabeth never recovered. She withdrew from court duties and travelled widely, unaccompanied by her family. In 1890, she had a palace built on the Greek Island of Corfu that she visited often. The palace Achilleion, featuring an elaborate mythological motif, served as a refuge. She was obsessively concerned with maintaining her youthful figure and beauty, which were already legendary during her life. At 172 cm (5 feet 8 inches), Elisabeth was unusually tall. Even after four pregnancies she maintained her weight at approximately 50 kg (110 pounds, 7 st 12 lbs) for the rest of her life. She achieved this through fasting and exercise, such as gymnastics and riding.\n\nAssassination\n\nElisabeth spent little time in Vienna with her husband. Their correspondence increased during their last years, however, and their relationship became a warm friendship. On her imperial steamer, Miramar, Empress Elisabeth travelled through the Mediterranean. Her favourite places were Cape Martin on the French Riviera, and also Sanremo on the Ligurian Riviera, where tourism had started only in the second half of the nineteenth century; Lake Geneva in Switzerland; Bad Ischl in Austria, where the imperial couple would spend the summer; and Corfu Greece.\n\nIn 1898, despite warnings of possible assassination attempts, the 60-year-old Elisabeth traveled incognito to Geneva, Switzerland. However, someone from the Hôtel Beau-Ravage revealed that the Empress of Austria was their guest.\n\nAt 1:35 p.m. on Saturday September 10, 1898, Elisabeth and Countess Irma Sztáray de Sztára et Nagymihály, her lady-in-waiting, left the hotel on the shore of Lake Geneva on foot to catch the steamship Genève for Montreux. Since the empress despised processions, she insisted that they walk without the other members of her entourage, including her bodyguards.\n\nThey were walking along the promenade when the 25-year-old Italian anarchist Luigi Lucheni approached them, attempting to peer underneath the empress’s parasol. According to Sztáray, as the ship’s bell announced the departure, Lucheni seemed to stumble and made a movement with his hand as if he wanted to maintain his balance. In reality, in an act of “propaganda of the deed”, he had stabbed Elisabeth with a sharpened needle file that was 4 inches (100 mm) long (used to file the eyes of industrial needles) that he had inserted into a wooden handle.\n\nLucheni originally planned to kill Prince Philippe, Duke of Orléans (1869–1926); but the Pretender to throne of France had left Geneva earlier for the Valais. Failing to find him, the assassin selected Elisabeth when a Geneva newspaper revealed that the elegant woman traveling under the pseudonym of “Countess of Hohenembs” was in fact the Empress Elisabeth of Austria.\n\nAfter Lucheni struck her, the empress collapsed. A coach driver helped her to her feet and alerted the Austrian concierge of the Beau-Rivage, a man named Planner, who had been watching the empress’s progress toward the Genève. The two women walked roughly 100 yards (91 m) to the gangway and boarded, at which point Sztáray relaxed her hold on Elisabeth’s arm. The empress then lost consciousness and collapsed next to her.\n\nSztáray called for a doctor, but only a former nurse, a fellow passenger, was available. The boat’s captain, Captain Roux, was ignorant of Elisabeth’s identity and since it was very hot on deck, advised the countess to disembark and take her companion back to her hotel. Meanwhile, the boat was already sailing out of the harbor. Three men carried Elisabeth to the top deck and laid her on a bench. Sztáray opened her dress, cut Elisabeth’s corset laces so she could breathe. Elisabeth revived somewhat and Sztáray asked her if she was in pain, and she replied, “No”. She then asked, “What has happened?”and lost consciousness again.\n\nCountess Sztáray noticed a small brown stain above the empress’s left breast. Alarmed that Elisabeth had not recovered consciousness, she informed the captain of her identity, and the boat turned back to Geneva. Elisabeth was carried back to the Hotel Beau-Rivage by six sailors on a stretcher improvised from a sail, cushions and two oars.\n\nFanny Mayer, the wife of the hotel director, a visiting nurse, and the countess undressed Elisabeth and removed her shoes, when Sztáray noticed a few small drops of blood and a small wound. When they then removed her from the stretcher to the bed she was clearly dead; Frau Mayer believed the two audible breaths she heard the Empress take as she was brought into the room were her last. Two doctors, Dr. Golay and Dr. Mayer arrived, along with a priest, who was too late to grant her absolution. Mayer incised the artery of her left arm to ascertain death, and found no blood. She was pronounced dead at 2:10 p.m. Everyone knelt down and prayed for the repose of her soul, and Countess Sztáray closed Elisabeth’s eyes and joined her hands.\n\nNo matter how reluctant or resentful she was of the title, Elisabeth had been the Empress of Austria for 44 years.\n\nWhen Franz Joseph received the telegram informing him of Elisabeth’s death, his first fear was that she had committed suicide. It was only when a later message arrived, detailing the assassination, that he was relieved of that notion. The telegram asked permission to perform an autopsy, and the answer was that whatever procedures were prescribed by Swiss Law should be adhered to.\n\nThe autopsy was performed the next day by Golay, who discovered that the weapon, which had not yet been found, had penetrated 3.33 inches (85 mm) into Elisabeth’s thorax, fractured the fourth rib, pierced the lung and pericardium, and penetrated the heart from the top before coming out the base of the left ventricle.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Elisabeth’s body was carried back to Vienna aboard a funeral train. The inscription on her coffin read, “Elisabeth, Empress of Austria”. The Hungarians were outraged and the words, “and Queen of Hungary” were hastily added. The entire Austro-Hungarian Empire was in deep mourning; 82 sovereigns and high-ranking nobles followed her funeral cortege on the morning of September 17, to the tomb in the Capuchin Church.\n\nThe Assassin\n\nLucheni was apprehended upon fleeing the scene and his file was found the next day. He told the authorities that he was an anarchist who came to Geneva with the intention of killing any sovereign as an example for others. Lucheni used the file because he didn’t have enough money for a stiletto.\n\nHis trial began the next month, in October. He was furious to find that capital punishment had been abolished in Geneva, and wrote a letter demanding that he be tried in another canton, such that he could be martyred. He received the sentence of life imprisonment.\n\nLucheni wrote his childhood memoirs while in Geneva’s Évêché prison. He was harassed in prison and his notebooks were stolen. He was found hanged in his cell on October 19, 1910. His head was preserved in formaldehyde and transferred to Vienna in 1986."
