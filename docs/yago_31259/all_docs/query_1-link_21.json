        "text": "Archduke Friedrich, Duke of Teschen (Friedrich Maria Albrecht Wilhelm Karl; 4 June 1856 – 30 December 1936) was a member of the House of Habsburg and the Supreme Commander of the Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I.\n\nEarly life[]\n\nFriedrich was born at the castle Gross-Seelowitz (now Židlochovice, near Brno in Moravia) the son of Karl Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria and his wife Archduchess Elisabeth Franziska of Austria.\n\nAmongst his siblings were Queen Maria Theresia of Bavaria, Queen Maria Cristina of Spain, Archduke Charles Stephen of Austria, and Archduke Eugen of Austria.\n\nWhen Friedrich's uncle Archduke Albert, Duke of Teschen died in 1895, he and his brothers each inherited large estates. Friedrich owned properties at Ungarisch-Altenburg (now Mosonmagyaróvár in Hungary), Belleje, Saybusch (now Żywiec in Poland), Seelowitz (now Židlochovice) and Frýdek in the Czech Republic, and Pressburg (now Bratislava in Slovakia). His Vienna residence, the Palais-Albrecht, housed the Albertina art collection which he owned.\n\nMarriage[]\n\nOn 8 October 1878 Friedrich married at Château L'Hermitage in Belgium, Princess Isabella of Croÿ (1856–1931), daughter of Rudolf, Duke of Croÿ, and his wife Princess Natalie of Ligne. They had nine children together.\n\nMaria Christina, Archduchess of Austria-Teschen (1879–1962), married Prince Manuel of Salm-Salm\n\nMaria Anna, Archduchess of Austria-Teschen (1882–1940), married Elias, Duke of Parma\n\nMaria Henrietta, Archduchess of Austria-Teschen (1883–1956), married Prince Gottfried of Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Schillingfurst\n\nNatalie Maria, Archduchess of Austria-Teschen (1884–1898)\n\nStephanie Maria Isabelle, Archduchess of Austria-Teschen (1886–1890)\n\nGabriele Maria Theresia, Archduchess of Austria-Teschen (1887–1954)\n\nIsabella, Archduchess of Austria-Teschen (1887–1973), married Prince Georg of Bavaria\n\nMaria Alice, Archduchess of Austria-Teschen (1893–1962), married Baron Friedrich Waldbott von Bassenheim\n\nAlbrecht Franz, Archduke of Austria, Duke of Teschen (1897–1955)\n\nMilitary career[]\n\nLike most of the princes of the ruling house, Friedrich adopted a military career, and served creditably for many years as commandant of the V. (Pressburg) Corps. Subsequently commander-in-chief of the Austrian Landwehr (militia) and army inspector, he became, after the murder of the heir to the throne, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, inspector-general of the Austro-Hungarian Army.[1]\n\nIn World War I, he was —from the dynastic point of view —as grandson of the victor of Aspern, Archduke Charles, and as nephew of the victor of Custoza, Archduke Albert, the predestined head of the armed forces of Austria-Hungary; and on 11 July 1914 Friedrich was appointed supreme commander of the Austro-Hungarian Army by Emperor Franz Joseph I. He thought it his duty to accept this heavy responsibility, but, modestly estimating his own powers, left the actual exercise of the command to his chief-of-staff, Franz Graf Conrad von Hötzendorf. In the performance of ceremonial duties, and as mediator for the settlement of the conflicting demands of the military, civil and allied elements, his services were undeniable.[1] He was promoted to the rank of Generalfeldmarschall on 8 December 1914. In the spring of 1917 Emperor Charles himself took over the supreme command; the Archduke, although the Emperor's representative, no longer appeared in the foreground. Friedrich remained supreme commander until February 1917 when Emperor Charles I decided to take the office himself.\n\nRetirement and death[]\n\nAfter World War I the governments of Austria and Czechoslovakia confiscated all of Friedrich's properties within their borders. These included his palace in Vienna and his art collection. He retained his properties in Hungary however. In 1929 he won a court case requiring compensation from the Czechoslovak government.[2]\n\nFriedrich died at Ungarisch-Altenburg (Magyaróvár, now Mosonmagyaróvár) in 1936. His death was the biggest royal event for Hungary since the coronation of King Karl in 1916. The funeral and burial in the Pfarrkirche in Mosonmagyaróvár was attended by his nephew, the exiled King of Spain; by numerous archdukes; by all the surviving Austro-Hungarian field marshals; by personal representatives of Hitler; by members of the House of Savoy; by the diplomatic corps; by a son of exiled German Kaiser Wilhelm; by representatives of the governments of Germany, Italy and Austria, and by Hungary's Regent, Miklós Horthy and his wife. There were members of the Hungarian government and delegates of the German and Austrian in attendance as well. Entire battalions of the Hungarian army were present to pay their last respects to their former Supreme Commander.\n\nAncestry[]\n\nDecorations and awards[]\n\nAustrian honours\n\nKnight of the Order of the Golden Fleece\n\nKnight Grand Cross of the Royal Order of Saint Stephen of Hungary\n\nMilitary Merit Cross, 1st class with war decoration\n\nGold Military Merit Medal (\"Signum Laudis\")\n\nForeign honours\n\nKnight of the Order of St. Andrew (Russian Empire)\n\nKnight of the Imperial Order of St. Alexander Nevsky (Russian Empire)\n\nOrder of St. Anna, 1st class (Russian Empire)\n\nGrand Cross of the Military Order of Max Joseph (Bavaria)\n\nKnight of the Order of the White Eagle (Russia)\n\nKnight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (United Kingdom)\n\nCommander 1st Class of the Military Order of St. Henry\n\nIron Cross\n\nMilitary Merit Cross, 1st class (Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin)\n\nNotes[]\n\nReferences[]\n\nHeiszler, Vilmos.
