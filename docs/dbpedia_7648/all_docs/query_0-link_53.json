        "text": "Throughout Europe’s debt crisis, Italy has largely managed to steer clear of the troubles that have engulfed its profligate Mediterranean neighbors.\n\nBut the contagion that started in the euro zone’s smaller countries is suddenly moving to some of its largest. As Greece teeters on the brink of a default, the game has changed: Investors are taking aim at any country suffering from a combination of high debt, slow growth and political dysfunction — and Italy has it all, in spades.\n\nIn recent days, Italy has become Europe’s next weak link after Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain, harmed in particular by a power struggle between Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and his finance minister, Giulio Tremonti. The dispute threatens to turn the euro zone’s third-largest economy, after Germany and France, into one of its biggest liabilities.\n\nOn Monday, the Italian government struggled to rein in the tensions, as fears rose that political paralysis could make it harder for Italy to embrace the austerity demanded by outsiders to reduce one of the highest debt levels in the world. European policy makers also sought to figure out how they would put out a bigger fire if Italy were to succumb.\n\nThose jitters hit stock markets on Monday not just in Italy, where the major index fell nearly 4 percent, but across much of Europe as well, with the markets in France and Germany off more than 2 percent each. The United States was affected, too, with the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index down about 1.8 percent on European debt fears and worries about the showdown in Washington over raising the United States debt limit.\n\n“Italy is too big to fail,” said Moisés Naím, a senior associate in the international economics program at the Carnegie Endowment in Washington. “If Italy really gets hit by contagion because of political mismanagement, it would be a threat not only to the euro zone, but to the global economy.”\n\nPolitical soap operas in Italy — especially those featuring Mr. Berlusconi — are nothing new. Nor do they usually matter much to financial markets, even after the debt crisis hit Europe. The widespread problems in Italy’s economy, which has been sluggish for the better part of a decade, also rang few alarm bells.\n\nWhat’s more, Italy’s banks are sound; they never speculated in a housing bubble. The current annual budget deficit is low, at about 4.6 percent of gross domestic product. And while Italy issues the largest amount of bonds of any euro zone country, Italians own about half the debt, making it less vulnerable to the follies of financial markets.\n\nBut with interest rates rising, Italy’s economy is not growing fast enough to cover an accumulated debt load of 120 percent of gross domestic product, the second-highest in Europe, after Greece. The International Monetary Fund expects growth to pick up only slightly, to 1.3 percent in 2012.\n\nIn a sign of how quickly things have turned against the country, the stock market regulator imposed emergency rules on Monday against speculation after shares in Italian banks slumped for a fifth consecutive session. The cost of insuring Italy’s sovereign debt against default surged to a record high, and the interest on its 10-year bond leaped to a record 5.67 percent.\n\nWhile that is still well below what Greece pays, analysts say Italy will have serious problems if its borrowing costs exceed 6 percent.\n\n“Italy is a banana republic that didn’t depend so much on foreign capital in the past, but now it does, and markets are less forgiving,” said Daniel Gros, the director of the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels. “Italy is in the danger zone; that is quite clear now.”\n\nItaly tends to function best in crisis management mode, analysts say, and Mr. Berlusconi has begun to acknowledge the seriousness of the dangers facing the country after a phone conversation with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, on Sunday.\n\nToday, Mr. Berlusconi “understands the risks objectively because the situation is dramatic,” said Stefano Folli, the chief political columnist for the financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore.\n\nMr. Folli and other analysts predicted that the Italian Parliament would rally and pass a 40 billion euro ($56 billion) austerity package that Mr. Tremonti had championed — even if it turns out to be one of the last significant acts of a government running out of political capital.\n\nLast week, Mr. Berlusconi prompted a sell-off in Italian bonds by suggesting that Mr. Tremonti, a longtime political rival and the sole guardian of fiscal prudence in Italy, could be elbowed out of government, imperiling the austerity package, the details of which still remain shrouded in confusion.\n\n“He thinks he’s a genius and everyone else is stupid,” Mr. Berlusconi said of Mr. Tremonti in an interview published on Friday in La Repubblica, the center-left daily. “He is the only minister who is not a team player,” he added.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Tremonti has other problems. Naples prosecutors are seeking the arrest of one of his close advisers, Marco Milanese, a member of Parliament who has been accused of accepting jewelry, cars and other luxury items from an Italian businessman.\n\nUntil the accusations were made public, Mr. Tremonti had been staying in an apartment owned by Mr. Milanese. He moved out soon after they surfaced.\n\nEven if Parliament approves the austerity measures in the coming weeks, the scandal around Mr. Tremonti could grow.\n\n“I don’t think he can withstand this scandal — it’s becoming unsustainable,” said Massimo Giannini, the business editor and deputy editor of La Repubblica. “He has too many enemies inside the government.”\n\nIn Brussels on Monday, Mrs. Merkel said: “I have firm confidence in the Italian government to approve exactly such a budget — I spoke on the telephone with the Italian prime minister yesterday on precisely this issue — and to signal that Italy feels a duty to consolidation and fighting debt.”\n\n“The euro itself is stable,” she added, “but we have a problem in some countries.”\n\nFor Italy, the biggest worry right now is that its fate may rest as much in Athens, Brussels and Berlin as it does in Rome. Only a week ago, it looked as if Greece might be turning a corner on its problems, after the government managed to push through an austerity package and French and German banks worked on ways to help Greece avoid default.\n\nBut the plan by banks fell apart over the weekend, and policy makers are at an impasse on how to require contributions from private creditors as part of a second Greek bailout.\n\n“Markets were getting more optimistic, and suddenly they’re saying, ‘My God, this is as bad as it ever was,’ ” said Peter Westaway, the chief European economist at Nomura International and a former Bank of England official. “Now, it looks as if Italy and Spain are going to be involved, too. And that makes the problem an order of magnitude more complicated for policy makers.”\n\nMr. Westaway cautioned against getting too negative about Italy. For one thing, the austerity being sought is nowhere near as crushing as what Greece is having to take on.\n\nStill, if the crisis were to take hold in Italy, the problems for the euro union would dwarf all others to date. European banks have total claims and potential exposures of 998.7 billion euros to Italy, more than six times the 162.4 billion euro exposure they have to Greece, according to Barclays Capital. European banks have 774 billion euros of exposure to Spain and 534 billion euros of exposure to Ireland.\n\nIn the United States, banks are also more exposed to Italy than to any other euro zone country, to the tune of 269 billion euros, according to Barclays. American banks’ next biggest exposure is to Spain, with total claims estimated at 179 billion euros.\n\nBut at the end of the day, “If Italy goes, it’s no longer a domino,” said Mr. Gros, the analyst in Brussels. “It’s a brick.”"
