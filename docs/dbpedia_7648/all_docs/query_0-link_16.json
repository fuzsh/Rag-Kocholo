        "text": "The Favorite — Mario Monti\n\nWho? Monti is the current favorite to get the nod if Berlusconi does step down.\n\nFor some, he's a popular choice. The deputy leader of Germany's Christian Democratic Union party said Monti would be a better man than Berlusconi in an interview with the Washington Post today. Monti is an economist and former EU Commissioner, appointed by Berlusconi.\n\nOdds: 7/4 (via Stan James)\n\nUPDATE: Following the news that Berlusconi is out, Monti's odds have been adjusted to 2/1.\n\nThe Opposition's Old Guard — Pier Luigi Bersani\n\nWho? Bersani served as both Minister of Industry, Trade and Crafts ans Minister of Transport and Navigation in governments during the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nHe is secretary of the Democratic Party (PD) of Italy, the second largest party in Italy and Berlusconi's main opposition.\n\nOdds: 9/2 (via Stan James)\n\nThe Leftist — Nichi Vendola\n\nWho? A leftist leader who was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1992 and held his seat until 2005. He is currently leader of the Left Ecology Freedom, an opposition socialist party.\n\nVendola has previously made it his ambition to \"dethrone\" Berlusconi and was attempting to gain a nomination to run against the current Prime Minister in the 2013 general elections.\n\nOdds: 10/3 (via Stan James)\n\nUPDATE: Following the news that Berlusconi is out, Vendola's odds have been adjusted to 7/2.\n\nThe Ferrari Don — Luca Di Montezemolo\n\nWho? The dapper chairman of Ferrari and a frequent Berlusconi critic.\n\nJust last week he called for Berlusconi to resign, saying that Italy, and its current Prime Minister, has reached the \"point of no return.\" He has very little experience in politics but is one of the country's most prominent businessmen.\n\nOdds: 5/1 (via Stan James)"
