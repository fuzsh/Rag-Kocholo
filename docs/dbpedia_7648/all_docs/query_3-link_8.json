He is also a professor of law at the University of Pavia and has been a visiting professor at the Institute of Comparative Law, Oxford. His particular fields of interest are fiscal and tributary law, as well as fiscal policies.\n\nDuring his time in office, he made significant income tax cuts by introducing a No-Tax-Area (2003) and by reducing the top marginal tax rate (2005). He also cut the corporate tax rate from 36% to 33% (now down to 27.5%) and abolished taxes on reinvested profits. He also completely abolished all donation taxes, estate/inheritance taxes (2001) and property taxes on housing/real estate (2008) at the national level.\n\nHe is chairman of the Aspen Institute Italia and a guest columnist of the Italian daily Corriere della Sera. He is the co-author with Edward Luttwak and Carlo Pelando of Il fantasma della povertà (1995) and the author of Lo Stato criminogeno (1997), Rischi fatali (2005), La paura e la speranza (2008) and Uscita di sicurezza (2012)."
