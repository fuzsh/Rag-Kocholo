It's multi-level.\" Giulio Tremonti, now chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber for the Brothers of Italy, told Corriere della Sera that he has always been Silvio Berlusconi's public accounts man. Deputy prime minister, once finance minister and three times at the head of the unified ministry of economy and finance (MEF), Tremonti is the one who did not hesitate to call Berlusconi to the rigor when the latter, as prime minister, risked getting caught the hand. He is one of the few who had the courage: “Not everyone is aware of how profoundly Silvio Berlusconi has changed Italy. Italy, attention: not only Italian television”. “I'm talking about – explains the former minister – the fact that it was commercial. Until Berlusconi's televisions, Italians bought what they saw in shop windows. There was no other possibility. With commercial television, goods and assets have begun to be seen on the screen”. And that “really changed everything. Given the impact television had on audiences, it was a tremendous boost for the media industry. From this point of view, it changed Italy. It's not just the fact of having created a large group, but it is having made a decisive contribution to the entire Italian economy”. And the political side; “It's the best-known side, the one that developed to the end. There is only, always, to remember who marked an interruption in this story”.\n\nThe reference is to what Silvio Berlusconi called the 2011 coup: “Yes. I remain convinced that the famous couple Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy have actively contributed to the Italian spread. The history is there to see. The Berlusconi government fell due to the letter signed by the outgoing and incoming governors of the ECB inspired by Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy”. The fact remains that Silvio Berlusconi did not question his and Forza Italia's membership in the European People's Party until his last day: “Ah, there's no doubt about that. But the real story is what I just repeated,” concluded Tremonti\n\nRead also other news on Nova News\n\nFollow us on the social channels of Nova News on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Telegram\n\n© Agenzia Nova - Reproduction reserved\n\nLatest news\n\nHarris on CNN: “Trump’s words about my race?
