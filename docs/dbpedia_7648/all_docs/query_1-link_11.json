        "text": "Standard & Poor’s pulled another late move on Monday, downgrading Italy’s sovereign credit rating by one notch to A/A-1. The credit rating agency cited weakening economic growth prospects as public and private borrowing costs rise, and a fragile political coalition failing to adequately respond to a challenging economic environment.\n\nWhile the downgrade doesn’t come as a shock, as S&P had Italy under a negative outlook since May, it will rattle markets. Europe’s sovereign debt woes have grappled nervous markets the last couple of weeks, with every word coming from Greece, Germany, or the ECB sparking massive moves on both sides of the Atlantic. (See the full text here).\n\nWith Greece teetering on the brink of default, Italy, along with Spain, has been under fire by so-called bond vigilantes. Yields on Italian and Spanish debt have shot up exponentially, forcing the ECB to reluctantly engage in bond buying operations in secondary markets, effectively lowering market rates on those sovereigns and buying time. (Read Official Euro Document: Crisis Now Systemic As Bank Liquidity Problem Fuels Vicious Feedback Loop).\n\nS&P, which not long ago was bold enough to downgrade the sovereign debt rating of the U.S., lowered Italy’s unsolicited long- and short-term sovereign credit ratings by one notch, with a negative outlook.\n\nThe credit rating agency noted weakening economic growth prospects, along with a fragile governing coalition, had called into question Italy’s capacity to meet its fiscal targets. Under a revised plan called “Italy Delivers,” Premier Silvio Berlusconi got parliament to pledge €60 billion ($82.1 billion) in cost cuts over the next three and a half years, along with structural reforms aimed at enhancing potential growth.\n\nS&P doesn’t buy it, though. The credit rating agency cites subdued external demand, government austerity measures, and upward pressure on funding costs both in the private and public sectors, as factors that will weigh on growth. While government statistics forecast Italian GDP to grow at an annual average rate of 1.375% through 2014, S&P believes it will be closer to 0.6%. (Read Euro Will Continue To Fall: US Dollar, Japanese Yen, Gold Best Hedging Options).\n\nThe other leg of the argument is based on Italy’s political system. With support for Premier Silvio Berlusconi waning, S&P is concerned that the political establishment won’t have what it takes to push strong structural reforms. Internal bickering between Berlusconi and his embattled Finance Minister, Giulio Tremonti, has added to the uncertainty.\n\nThe government doesn’t have the back to push ahead with structural problems such as low labor participation rates, tightly regulated labor markets, an inefficient public sector, and modest foreign investment flows.\n\nItaly’s debt burden has been on the rise and will only moderate slightly, S&P notes. The debt-to-GDP ratio will surge to 117% by the end of 2011, up from 100% in 2007. S&P expects the debt burden to fall to 115% by 2014."
