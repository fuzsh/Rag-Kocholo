        "text": "Silvio Berlusconi on Thursday said European Parliament President Antonio Tajani would be a strong candidate for Italian prime minister after March’s election.\n\nThe former three-time Italian leader said he had three names in mind for PM if his Forza Italia party wins the election, but he mentioned only his long-time ally Tajani by name.\n\nBerlusconi cannot hold high office because of a conviction for tax fraud.\n\n“If it were possible to have Antonio Tajani as premier it would be a wonderful choice. He has always shown total and absolute loyalty to our principles and ideas, and to Silvio Berlusconi,” he told RTL radio.\n\n“Tajani has said several times in several interviews that he’s happy at the European Parliament,” a Tajani spokesperson told POLITICO.\n\nOpinion polls suggest Forza Italia will secure the most seats within the center-right coalition in the March 4 ballot, but no party will be able to win a majority.\n\nIf Tajani were to make the jump to Rome, the European Parliament would have lost its second president in a row to national politics, after Martin Schulz left to lead the German Social Democratic Party. Tajani’s 2 1/2-year term would normally last until 2019, when the European Parliament election will be held and the top jobs at the Commission, Council and Parliament will be up for renewal.\n\nLike Schulz, Tajani’s career in the European Commission and Parliament hasn’t give him much visibility in his homeland, which he now visits so assiduously that it looks “as if he was in an election campaign,” Marco Damilano, a political analyst and deputy director of the Italian weekly L’Espresso, told POLITICO in late 2017.\n\nDespite a 30-year career in politics, Tajani “is not well known by Italians and his name is not even tested by pollsters,” said Damilano. But if Berlusconi beckons, either before or after the election campaign, “he will obey, I take it for granted,” said Damilano.\n\nWhile Tajani is loyal to Berlusconi, his career offers a sober contrast to that of the flamboyant billionaire, with not a whiff of the sleaze and scandals that became a Berlusconi trademark.\n\nThere is no doubting Tajani’s right-wing pedigree: The Italian daily La Stampa reported that his family has close links to Pietro Badoglio, one of Benito Mussolini’s generals.\n\nBut some of the Italian media have taken to describing Tajani as “the Paolo Gentiloni of the center right,” referring to the current prime minister’s soft manners and cautious approach, which have boosted his standing in opinion polls. It’s no coincidence, perhaps, that Tajani and Gentiloni attended the same Rome high school — the Tasso Liceo.\n\nIf Tajani does become prime minister, it will be a triumph for someone who has repeatedly come up short in Italian elections. He was voted into the European Parliament in 1994, but failed to get elected to the Italian parliament in 1996 and failed in a bid for mayor of Rome in 2001, when Berlusconi scored a landslide victory across the country but not in the capital."
