        "text": "Silvio Berlusconi was “shrewd, capable and true to his word”, Sir Tony Blair said as world leaders paid tribute to the former Italian prime minister following his death at age 86.\n\nBerlusconi died surrounded by his family at Milan’s San Raffaele hospital, where he was being treated for a lung infection caused by leukaemia.\n\nAs one of Europe’s most colourful politicians, he was elected prime minister four times, but was brought down by the bunga bunga scandal and a conviction for tax fraud.\n\nSir Tony, who with his wife Cherie was a holiday guest of Berlusconi on Sardinia in 2004, praised the former Italian prime minister as a “larger than life figure”.\n\n“I know he was controversial for many but for me he was a leader whom I found capable, shrewd and, most important, true to his word,” he said.\n\nVladimir Putin described Berlusconi as a “true friend” and a “true patriot” who strengthened ties between Italy and Russia.\n\nAs late as last September Berlusconi defended Putin over the war in Ukraine, claiming the Russian president was pushed into it.\n\n“I always sincerely admired his wisdom, his ability to make balanced, far-sighted decisions even in the most difficult of situations,” Putin said.\n\n“During each of our meetings, I was literally charged with his incredible vitality, optimism and sense of humour. His death is an irreparable loss and great sorrow.”\n\nItalian politicians said Berlusconi’s death marked the “end of an era” as they hailed the man who once described himself as the “Jesus Christ of politics” after more than 30 years of controversies.\n\nGiorgia Meloni, the Italian prime minister, whose coalition government includes Berlusconi’s Forza party, said: “He was a courageous fighter. He was a man unafraid of defending his ideas and it was exactly that courage and determination which makes him one of the most influential men in the history of Italy.”\n\nMatteo Salvini, Italy’s far-right deputy prime minister, said he cried after the news broke, branding Berlusconi “one of the greatest ever, in all fields, from all points of view”.\n\nItalian president Sergio Mattarella described him as a “great political leader”.\n\nBerlusconi died months after it was revealed that he had been battling myelomonocytic leukaemia, a rare form of blood cancer.\n\nBorn in Milan in 1936 to a middle-class family, he embarked on a business career in property development before going on to found Italy’s largest commercial broadcaster.\n\nHe leaves five children from two marriages.\n\nAs his country’s longest-serving post war prime minister, Berlusconi led Italy for around nine years in multiple stints, all while battling criminal investigations and scandals in his private life.\n\nThe billionaire media mogul racked up some 35 criminal court cases and one definitive judgment against in over 30 years of legal battles.\n\nBy his own account, he made more than 2,500 court appearances over the period, with legal bills costing him up to €200 million (£172m).\n\nMost sensationally in April 2013, Berlusconi was found guilty of having paid for sex with 17-year-old nightclub dancer Ruby the Heartstealer.\n\nThe scandal emerged in October 2010 when the young woman was arrested by police in Milan on suspicion of theft.\n\nBerlusconi got wind of the arrest and contacted the police urging them to release the Moroccan-born exotic dancer, whose real name is Karima El Mahroug.\n\nHe claimed, erroneously, that she was the granddaughter of Hosni Mubarak, the then president of Egypt, and that her arrest would cause a diplomatic furore. Details of her attending his bunga bunga parties subsequently began to emerge.\n\nHe was initially sentenced to seven years in prison but appealed the conviction. The conviction was overturned by an appeals court which said there was no proof he could have known the girl was a minor.\n\nBoth Berlusconi and Ms El Mahroug denied having sex.\n\nIn 2012, he was convicted of tax fraud, serving a year-long sentence doing community service and banned from holding public office.\n\nThe embargo was lifted in time for him to win a seat in the European Parliament in 2019. He went on to be elected as a senator back home in October 2022.\n\nFans of AC Milan, Berlusconi’s hometown football team which he once owned, gathered outside the hospital where he died to celebrate his life.\n\nHis body will reportedly be transferred to his home at Villa San Martino in Arcore, north of Milan, where he held his infamous bunga bunga parties, before a state funeral at a cathedral in the city.\n\nMarysthell Polanco, an alleged prostitute that attended those parties, gave a gushing tribute to the former prime minister.\n\n“Silvio Berlusconi was a special man. His sensitivity, irony and the respect that he always showed me will always remain in my heart,” she said. “We had some difficult times together [during trials in which he was accused of bribing the girls]. I loved him and always will.”"
