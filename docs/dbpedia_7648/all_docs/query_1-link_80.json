        "text": "To read the CURRENT month, go to ITALY JOURNAL\n\nWe post to the journal several times a month, so if you'd like to be notified each time we post, send us an email: evanne@lavventuraitalia.com\n\nJuly 1\n\nThe month ended with somewhat overcast skies. Although we are pleased it is a bit cooler, just a bit, we're met with raised humidity. We drive to Viterbo for a joint appointment with the always wonderful Dottore Bevilacqua, (he deserves to be in italics!); he treats us with great friendship and respect; prescribing different salve and pills for my insect bites. For Roy, tachipirina three times a day and ice packs for a week, plus more rest, more time off his feet.\n\nBut in an example of how important good relationships are in Italy, I ask our good doctor if he knows any one at the Prefettura in Viterbo to find out why my application for citizenship is stalled. Amazingly, he does! The man is called, he answers his phone, and is waiting for us! Wow!\n\nFive minutes later, we've parked right out front of the ancient building, and this time the guard at the office right at the gate is given the name of the man we are to see. His expression changes, and in a couple of minutes we're told on what floor to find the man whose name is written on a little piece of paper. The man we are to see is one friendly guy, and is a relative of folks who live in Bomarzo and have a farm right at the edge of Mugnano. We know his cousin!\n\nHe takes us to Signora Altissimi, the tiny lady we visited a few weeks ago, and stands over her like a giant eagle. Our new friend walks around behind her to see what she pulls up on her computer screen, and yes, my application is still \"in the final stages\". He asks her if she'll find out who has my papers and what is keeping the process from moving ahead. She agrees, or so we think she does...\n\nWe're inching along in the process, and although he tells us it could take up to five years, there's no reason for the process to take so long. We're nudging it, and perhaps she or he can convince whoever has my file to let go of it. We surely have provided them with all they need.\n\nWe stop to see if the air conditioning unit we have wanted has arrived at Bricofer in Viterbo. There are lots of models, but not the one that we have. So later Dino will drive to Orte and see if the one with his name on it has arrived at that location.\n\nAt home, Sofi has been relaxing inside a cool house, and spends the next several hours by our side. It's too hot, really, to spend much time outside, although I do a bit of deadheading in the garden and Dino chops off some long wisteria fronds.\n\nPaolo arrives in the afternoon to measure for new doors for the cucina estate, mostly to keep out mosquitoes and calabrone. If we're in luck, we'll have: the screen doors installed for the summer kitchen, the air conditioner installed in the main kitchen, and my citizenship approval by the time we post this first half of the month. You know as well as we that the chances for even one are only possibilities.Magari!(If only that were so...)\n\nAfter Paolo leaves, Dino drives off to do errands, including looking for the air conditioning unit in Orte and filling up Giallina withmetano on the way home, while I fill you in on the day's activities.\n\nTonight is the annual cena alla Romana with Merritt and Kate in Montecchio to celebrate Kate's birthday. You recall what alla Romana means, don't you? That's a meal in which the total bill is split by the number of people in attendance. If the meal is alla Genovese, on the other hand, each person would pay for what they ate and drank. We have never gone to the second variation; the first is fine with us.\n\nWe check in with Candace and Frank, who are in France for part of a week visiting a good friend, and will celebrate an American 4th of July when they return; either Sunday or Tuesday or whenever. On the 4th, Dino has to meet people who are staying at a rental in Tenaglie, and we don't know what time they'll arrive, so can't plan anything.\n\nI am feeling so much better; looking forward to a night out, with Sofi again snoozing at home. She'll be more comfortable here, and now and then it's good for us to go out by ourselves, although I love having her by my side. I am wearing a dress with silk tights underneath, to cover my legs, for mosquitoes love me but drive me crazy.\n\nJuly 2\n\nWe drive to Terni this morning for a few things we can't find in Viterbo, and at the first, a large fabric store, I find great material for Emily's costume and a piece of really lovely fabric for dresses for Marissa and Nicole. This store has a great deal more fabric and excellent prices on some of the items than stores in Viterbo, so it's a good thing we've stopped here.\n\nDino wants to find a wooden paddle for the pizza oven, but the three places we try don't have them, nor do they give us suggestions for the correct places to try. Some night soon we'll have pizza at Carlo's and ask him. Come no? It's quite overcast, and after we return home and have pranzo, Sofi and I return upstairs to recheck spelling and grammar on the final June post and Dino continues to work on projects downstairs.\n\nA substantial rain shower emerges; it's a really good rainstorm. Although it's finished within an hour or so, there has been a real soaking.\n\nI'm adding to the list of things I'd like to do, and this time to write a story based on what I know of my parents when they met. I do like to write, and have given the letters my parents wrote to each other during WWII when they were newly married to my brother. I've transcribed them and have copies of them here. The longer the list of things I want to do, the more I want to live on and be able to complete every last one.\n\nJuly 3\n\nDon Angelo is our priest, and arrives late, so his sermon is short. He repeats the concept to remember in our hearts and minds that God is always in us and we are always in Him. I keep thinking of that Norman Mailer book, The Castle in the Forest, and although I don't think of Mailer as a particularly spiritual man, his concept of the devil is an interesting one, as his devils taunt his characters, just as they probably taunt us. It's our strength to believe in God and to decide to do the right thing when faced with choices both good and bad that hopefully propels us forward.\n\nAfter mass, we sit with a few folks in the borgo to gain more information for our project;\n\nSome are interested in chatting with us and taking the project seriously...and then there's Giuseppe, who has more important things to do.\n\nBack at home, Dino works on the albero genealogico , while I marinate a pork fillet with wild fennel and garlic and olive oil and other spices. He grills it for pranzo, served with fresh zucchini flowers stuffed with buffala mozzarella and anchovies. These flowers are not fried this time, but are excellent as a little type of insalata.\n\nAfter pranzo, Dino returns to work on the Mugnano tree project; then we take our gazebo to the borgo and sit for an hour or more with people of Mugnano who give us more information.\n\nThere are not a lot of people around, other than children playing ball, but Aldo comes over to sit with us for a while, giving us more family information and tells us how the borgo has changed since he was a child in the 1940's.\n\nYears ago, Aldo shows and tells us there was a wall where the entrance to the borgo is now, and more of the borgo consisted of pasture land. Pigs and other animals lived in the borgo, right near where we're sitting today. It must have been quite a fragrant(!) place back then.\n\nDuring the Mussolini era, he motions with his arm that a huge fascist flag hung next to the little church, and tells us that several hundred people lived here then. It was only after WWII that people began to leave, for there was no work to be found locally.\n\nWhat impact did that have on the Mugnano family tree? Bit by bit, we are learning more and more. Today we did not bring the computer, for Dino finds it easier to take out the pages of what we have in our binder and add and change data on the pages first, then input the data at home later. He thinks it's too difficult to see the computer screen with the afternoon sun's reflections.\n\nSofi scampers around, but sits quietly for most of the time between us on the bench. This is such an interesting project; I can't help pondering how to paint a fantastic tree to represent these wonderful and generous people.\n\nWhen we take the gazebo down, Silvano Spaccese and Mario Fosci are there to help us, and it takes no time at all to put it back together and drive home down the hill.\n\nWhile I'm catching up with you in the studio, the cachi tree in front of the studio window reminds us that it grows quickly and yes, will provide lots of shade, soon. As long as it does not make a mess, we're happy to keep it around, especially as summer turns to fall and the leaves turn the beautiful colors of the Italian terra cotta and gold landscape.\n\nSoon I hope we'll bring a tape recorder to record stories of the people. I think I know enough Italian to be able to encourage people to tell stories to me; I'm not sure how we'll transcribe the stories later, but first things first.\n\nMost of the people we speak with cannot name relatives further back than their grandparents, which is not unlike many people around the world today. This project, hopefully, will provide enduring information to children in future generations. As they grow, we're hoping they'll take stories and family history information into their hearts and memory banks about this wonderful village and the events taking place here. It's a legacy we're thrilled to be able to provide.\n\nBack at home, Dino putters around, as do I, while Sofi sits at my side and waits for me.\n\nJuly 4\n\nAbove us, those colorless skies emerge once more, along with plenty of humidity. Thankfully, the temperature is not hot. Dino wants to celebrate the American Independence Day, to wear the country's red, white and blue. Come no?\n\nWe work around the house and then leave at around noon to pick up a sewing table for my studio at IKEA, just before reaching Rome. Eating paninis from an Autogrill in the car are fine with us, and we find a parking spot inside that is cool for Sofi to wait for us.\n\nOutside IKEA, men are setting up for some musical extravaganza, and the set looks right out of a Broadway musical. What do you think?\n\nBack at home, Dino works to set up the table in the studio, then Stefano Basili comes to look over the air conditioner he will help Dino install on Saturday morning. It has not been hot these past couple of days, so waiting is not a problem, at least for now.\n\nDino shows a couple from Massachusetts how to get to the Tenaglie rental, and wants to invite them here this week. Sounds as if we'll do a pizza night, and will try to include Candace and Frank as well as Mai Elin and Olaf. That makes eight, the perfect number for pizza...\n\nJuly 5\n\nAfter lots of rain over night, skies clear as we work in the studio. Ever open to new ideas, we're moving things around to make the room work better; it will be a place where I'll be able to orchestrate some of my crazy ideas.\n\nPaintings long stored away are hung on walls, furniture is moved around, a padded cushion is fashioned with cotton fabric to be sewn over felt, to use when I want to iron something, but without a need for a separate ironing board.\n\nI notice that there are many of my paintings that need to be reworked until I enjoy them. We have two large cavaletti (easels), so I can work on two paintings at a time and at the same time sew away on a third project, unrelated to painting. Nearby is the computer, where I still want to write the book, or at least a series of short stories. Shelves from Ikea hidden from sight behind a taupe linen cloth are hardly used; now they'll be repositories for many supplies.\n\nEmanuela has given me great counsel about a few things in the journal, popping up almost right after the email has been sent that the posting has taken place. One word I need to use more and more until it is imbedded in my brain is the word ghiaccio (ice), with a very special spelling.\n\nAnother, the word lampione is one that is different than one originally used in the journal last month, lampone, which means \"raspberry\". Before the use of streetlights, Dino tells me that lanterns were used. So in that context, we're talking about large streetlights, note the ending \"...one.\"\n\nBefore we know it, noon is upon us, and Dino drives to the next town for a couple of hardware items while I begin a pasta sauce with precooked leftover sausages, fresh wild fennel and tomatoes from the summer kitchen's slowly depleted larder.\n\nThe wild fennel is really a hit; I'll use it whenever we use sausage meat, unless some other idea strikes my fancy.\n\nThe rest of the afternoon is spent in the studio, rearranging, hanging hooks, hanging paintings, and overall changing the look of the place. Now my pals hang all around, smiling down at me. If only Dino would not hit his head when he works; he hit it twice in the space of an hour but will not wear a hat, especially a hard hat, when working. Sometimes one's head just gets in the way...\n\nThe room is not perfect, but has a lot more organization and plenty of open looking shelves with sparkly material to sew for my little darlings. Once I set up the sewing machine, I'll make a case for the felt material that is the size of the table, and will be able to use it as a large ironing board when I need it.\n\nPizza? Tomorrow night is our next festa, comprised of six or eight friends, including Merritt and Kate's new renters, who are from Boston.\n\nWhen moving things around, I locate a large drawing of St. Peter the Martyr, just as he's about to go under the ax of Carino. I'd like to paint him, even though the church project is not a probability. Since I've spent ever so much time working on that project, I'd like to have something to recall the things I've learned and enjoyed.\n\nWith several canvases stored but in need of reworking, I'm thinking I need to set some goals and gentle timelines. I promised a painting of grapes for a winery owner in Languedoc, so before we drive there this fall, that is one that needs to begin in the next weeks. There are costumes to make before November, but then I'm waiting for the measurements, so that will wait. I think sooner will be a lemon yellow dress to make for me to wear to Tiziano an Alessia's wedding at the end of the month. I'd like a piece of Como lace to wear on the top, so if we return to Terni, that's what I'll do.\n\nRight now, I'm going to make a couple of recipes of pizza dough, to keep in the frigo overnight. Tomorrow morning, we will shop for ingredients. Wonder what Dino will think when I add wild fennel to his Boscaiola pizza tomorrow night...\n\nThe pizza dough sits in two frigos, and that is a good feeling to have that part done. Now I'm going to make two buttery piecrusts for an apple pie for dessert for tomorrow night's pizza festa, and will make a lattice work design before putting it in the oven. Come no? July 6\n\nThe day is long and there is much to do to prepare for another pizza night event here. Although there will only be eight of us, which is the perfect number in which to carve up a pizza, almost the same amount of work is entailed for a group twice as large. No matter. I so enjoy the creative aspect of it all, as well as the fun having friends come by for an evening.\n\nThere are six pizzas for tonight, and as the guests arrive, I'm doing still more prep work. Although I'm well organized in terms of having things prepared and in bowls and on trays before the pizza is formed and slid into the oven, there's a lot to do.\n\nThe pizza bases have been sitting in the frigo overnight, and sit on a table for two hours before they are used, hopefully in a cool place. The first pizza topping is zucchini and feta cheese and mint. Unfortunately, although we've floured the paddle and the worksheet below the pizza dough, it does not slide well onto the paddle, and as Dino becomes unglued in all the heat, he winds up turning it over, so it is more of acalzone than a traditional pizza. No matter. We slice it up and it becomes a kind of cocktail food, with folks standing around and watching us.\n\n(NOTE: Tony took the photo, so he has been inserted!)\n\nThere is Dino's favorite, boscaiola, followed by the complex one: garlic béchamel sauce, small shrimp, zucchini flowers stuffed with buffalo mozzarella and an anchovy on top of each; then we have caramelized red onions with chopped calamata olives and buffalo mozzarella, potatoes with rosemary and sea salt, and the ultima...: fresh figs, gorgonzola cheese, runny honey, rosemarino and walnuts.\n\nWe follow with a homemade apple pie served with artisan vanilla ice cream from Orvieto. There's clearly too much food, so next time we'll pare down somewhat...or will we?\n\nWe need to fashion an easier way to slide the pizza onto the pallet; it mostly sticks, even when we add extra flour to each part of the pizza dough and also flour the edge of the round aluminum pallet.\n\nDino has asked Carlo, who runs the pizzeria in the nearby town, where to find a wooden one. Carlo can order one for Dino, but uses aluminum himself. What's the trick? What's the knack? We surely want to know, for the cooking should be fun.\n\nThe night is fun, the weather is great, and there are no signs of mosquitoes. Perhaps the fire has had something to do with that. Dino has put up a large umbrella to work under, so as soon as we have constructed the extension of the summer kitchen roof, things will be more comfortable for him.\n\nWe're in bed a bit after midnight, but do appreciate the importance of cleaning up after a meal. It's terribly depressing to come down in the morning to a house full of dirty dishes.\n\nJuly 7\n\nWhat have I learned after our third pizza night has passed and I have reviewed the score sheets?\n\nEveryone seems to like caramelized onions, the boscaiola seems to have lost its luster (or perhaps just with me) and could use some spice (pepperoncini?), the little shrimp add nothing to the garlic-y zucchini flower concoction, potatoes need to be crispy (cooked ahead of time?), fig pizza could use more honey and riper figs, the tastes of calamata olives and carmelized onions are strong, so need a stronger cheese.\n\nMore importantly, we need to find a way to keep the pizza from sticking to the palate. This caused a lot of stress for both Dino and me, and is an ongoing concern.\n\nThose of you who know us know that we'll find a solution...soon!\n\nIt's time for pranzo, so Dino rekindles the pizza oven fire and we grill a beautiful Salmon filet that MayElin brought from Norway.\n\nJuly 8\n\nToday is the last day of Wendy's dig at Carsulae, and we stop by there early this morning. Here's what we find:\n\nAfterward we return to Terni to pick up a piece of merletta (lace) to fashion as a kind of shell over the yellow dress I am making to wear for Tiziano and Alessia's wedding. After rejecting fabric after fabric, I apologize to the clerk and tell her I'm a painter and perhaps that is why I know what won't work.\n\nWe are at the front of the store and she marches me back to the area where we first stood, taking out a bolt of white silk. \"Paint the silk yourself!\" she tells me, and I am thinking of the bridesmaids' gowns and wraps for our wedding almost thirty years ago. Sure, it makes sense, although I have no idea what type of paint or brushes to use, and how to transfer a design onto the silk itself.\n\nI pick up a meter of it, for it's expensive, and since we're also looking for a better palla for the pizza oven, we'll also try Marco's ferramenta, (hardware) shop, the place where I first learned to paint ceramics and studied every week some years ago for more advice.\n\nMarco is there and welcomes us. He has just the perfect type of paint to use on silk, and now I'm into yet another type of painting; one that may become the most marvelous yet.\n\nThere are special stretchers for the silk, and Marco tells me to transfer the design just as I have been when painting in oils...with carta carbone (tracing paper). There is also a liquid that is used to outline what I am about to paint; it prevents paint from moving or bleeding outside the lines. I also see a sheet of wrapping paper that has two orchids painted upon it, so we buy that, too, and there just may be an orchid or two on the front and on the back of this silk sheath, which will be worn over the simple yellow dress I am making to wear to Tiziano and Alessia's wedding.\n\nWe're both already tired and ready for a nap, but drive home, where I fix a big salatone with yesterday's grilled salmon, now served cold atop lettuces and marinated veggies. It's really delicious.\n\nAfter a nap in our cool bedroom with shutters closed and the air conditioning softly humming, I want to find out more about painting on silk fabric. Perhaps this craft is the perfect blending for me of loving fabric and loving painting light and shadows.\n\nWhen painting people I'd continue to paint in oils on canvas, but for the sewing design creature in me, painting a scrollwork or flower or orchid on silk might become quite interesting; that is, if I can do it without having the colors run.\n\nWe purchased an agent known as gutta that will keep paint from running. Now Dino and I will purchase metal pushpins, elastics and safety pins to adhere the silk to the wooden frame kit we purchased this morning from Marco. Will I be able to make the yellow dress, paint the silk and sew it over the dress as a kind of overlay to wear to Tiziano's wedding at the end of the month? It's good to have a goal, so let's see how I can accomplish that.\n\nYes, the list of things to do grows. The studio is alive with all manner of projects and fabric and supplies. I'm so at peace!\n\nWhile Sofi and I are inside catching up with you, Dino putters outside in the garden. Sorry, dear garden, I've been ignoring you. At least tonight we do some deadheading surrounded by birdsong and it's a lovely temperate evening.\n\nJuly 9\n\nStefano Basili arrives to work with Dino to install the air conditioning unit above the door to the summer kitchen. Before he arrives, Sofi and I gambol out on the terrace, where I rake most of the leaves under the giant loquat tree beside the living/dining room using our ancient style scopa (broom).\n\nDecades ago, scopas were handmade from branches. Now, the old tool is better than the newest ones, for it ever so lightly guides the dry leaves over the breccia (gravel; cut stones) and instead of breaking the leaves up, floats with them toward their final destination in the sacco (leaf bin), used to take leaves to the area on the far property, where we will burn them. This style scopa is still the broom of choice for most Italian street sweepers.\n\nSorry, Sarah, Dino just can't seem to get into composting, although many fallen leaves provide just that during the fall and winter months, resting under the box and lavender plants. Some things are just not worth fretting about.\n\nMy damp hair tells me the temperature is rising and it's time to stop for now. Although Dino tells me we're not very good housekeepers, he agrees that when I begin a project I'm hard to drag away from it until it is done.\n\nI do feel a sense of accomplishment, for before beginning the leaf sweeping, I also moved the six giant green bottles from that area to the front terrace. With Cristina's counsel, after Stefano and Dino finish their project, Dino will move the bottles to the area above the parcheggio behind the planting area, in front of, and against, the high tufa outcropping. They'll provide an attractive and characteristic background for the ceanothus and other plants.\n\nDid I tell you there's hardly a blue flowering plant on this earth that I do not love? I'm wild about plumbago and ceanothus flowers, and the plants themselves don't take a lot of care. Don't forget lobelia, which is a bit more difficult to grow, but its cascading loveliness on the front of the house is a joy.\n\nBack in the studio, I'm anxious to go over the framing for the silk fabric, but there is other fabric to sew to cover the worktable that I will use to iron upon. The new table works really well, so let's get the sewing machine out. In the meantime, it's fun to look around the room at the paintings upon which I've spent hours and experienced much joy at the process. This certainly is a dreamy and joyous room.\n\nLater in the afternoon, Dino and I drive to Viterbo. These days, Sofi would rather stay at home; it's just too hot for her to wait in the car, even in a dark garage. We find whatever we need, including a grand pizza peel, and with Carlo's advice it costs much less than the one he purchased a couple of years ago.\n\nBack at home, Sofi and I walk up to Maria Elina's to give her a container of homemade cole slaw. She and Olaf are on the balcony enjoying the afternoon weather as children and adults play on the street below.\n\nShe's so sweet, delighting in the small gift, and wants to get together. Tomorrow night after they return from a day at the beach at Montalto di Castro, we'll all go to Carlo's for pizza together, including Sofi, who appears to be much better.\n\nWe do try the air conditioner while watching tv, but Sofi and I are tired of the movie and go upstairs, while Dino watches the rest of the action movie. No, grazie.\n\nJuly 10\n\nIt's Sunday, and that means mass and Coro. These days, it also means taking a fan, for the air in the church is still and the mass seems to take forever. I forget to take one, but no matter...\n\nWe do our work for the Albero Project later in the afternoon during the summer months. But today, we seem to forget to do it. Instead, I work on it at home all afternoon while Dino takes a nap. Afterward, there's work to do in the garden before we are picked up by Olaf and May Elin for pizza at Carlo's, not to mention projects together in the studio...\n\nNow that I have something to paint upon, I'll begin painting the grapes for the gift we will take to Languedoc in September for the friends at the winery. We've picked up a board upon which to paint the grapes, and we'll look at the photos we took of their vines when we were there to see what I will use for inspiration. Oh, how we love their red wine!\n\nBut first, there's another project to begin. We' take out the silk and the wood frame pieces to see if we can stretch the seta (silk) so that I can use the gutta to outline the design and then paint the fabric! I can't imagine that I'll do it perfectly the first time I attempt it, but am quite excited. Just the idea of it fills me with joy.\n\nWhat's missing? Well, it's the applicator for the gutta, and since the liquid-y material must be applied in an uninterrupted line around the image that is later painted, and I don't have faith in my ability to do that with a regular brush. What is gutta, anyway?\n\nWell, it's an interesting material, used to keep the paint from running over its line and spreading across the seta (silk). It is applied with an applicator, or a brush, and then must dry completely before any paints are applied to the fabric. My designs are precise, so this process is important.\n\nOur dear friends pick us up and take us across the Tiber to Attigliano, where Carlo's place sits next to the big parking lot of Hotel Umbria. We all sit outside on this warm and pleasant evening. Olaf's diavolo pizza is wonderful, but the boscaiola that the rest of us have are less than usual. Carlo is out of fresh mushrooms, and tells us it won't happen again, and we're sure he means it. He's a really wonderful guy, so generous in his advice to help us to purchase the correct pizza utensils, and so we continue to recommend him and his pizza to you any time you're in the area, where one can eat either outside on the terrace under the trees or inside in attractive surroundings.\n\nTime for some Italian news?\n\nFarmers unveil anti-aging 'super tomato'\n\nHigh in antioxidants, prevents cardiovascular diseases\n\n(ANSA) - Rome, July 8 -\n\nItalian scientists and farmers have developed a black, anti-aging \"super tomato\", the Coldiretti farmers association said Friday.\n\nAccording to Coldiretti, the \"Sun Black\" tomato is rich in lycopene, a red pigment that is one of the most powerful antioxidants known to fight against aging and prevent cardiovascular diseases.\n\nThe tomatoes will be commercially available within a few days. Coldiretti will unveil the super fruit at the headquarters in Rome Wednesday morning.\n\nBerlusconi says won't stand in 2013\n\nParty head Alfano will be the man, says premier\n\n(ANSA) - Rome, July 8 -\n\nSilvio Berlusconi will not stand as premier again nor will he seek the presidency, the Italian premier told a leading national newspaper Friday.\n\nBerlusconi, 74, said he would be too old to make another bid for the premier's post when his current term ends in 2013.\n\nAngelino Alfano, 40, newly appointed as head of Berlusconi's People of Freedom (PdL) party, would be the centre-right candidate, the premier told left-leaning daily La Repubblica.\n\n\"The premiership candidate of the center right will be Alfano,\" Berlusconi said.\n\n\"I will campaign, and I'll help Angelino. I'll be the father figure. I will try to build up the European People's Party in Italy, but at 77 years of age I can no longer be premier\".\n\nAs for the presidency, he said \"it's not for me\" and suggested his longtime aide and mediator-in-chief Gianni Letta, 76, for the post.\n\n\"He's the most suitable person and he has excellent relations with the center left. He would get their votes too\".\n\nBerlusconi, who has been hit by sex and corruption trials and recent local-election and referendum defeats, said the government was nonetheless strong and would last until 2013.\n\nHe said relations with key ally the Northern League, rumored to be strained, were \"extremely solid\".\n\nThe premier had unusually harsh words for his economy minister, Giulio Tremonti, another long-time associate, an internationally respected economic expert and one of his former tax lawyers.\n\nBerlusconi criticised Tremonti for \"not being a team player\" and \"just talking to the markets\" and said his latest austerity package, which again kept the purse strings closed and ruled out mooted pump-priming moves and tax cuts to boost electoral support, would be changed in parliament.\n\n\"He (Tremonti) thinks he's a genius and thinks everyone else is a cretin. \"I put up with him because I've known him for a long time and you have to take him as he is, but he's the only one who doesn't play with the team\".\n\nNaples to send trash outside region\n\nLombardy, Sicily among recipients\n\n(ANSA) - Rome, July 7 -\n\nLarge amounts of Naples waste are to be moved to other Italian regions, said the governor of Campania Thursday.\n\nLeaders from Sicily, Puglia, Marche, Tuscany, Emilia Romagna, Lombardy and Friuli Venezia Giulia are expected to sign an agreement Friday, according to Governor Stefano Caldoro, allowing Naples to ship rubbish to their territory.\n\nStill, it is unclear if the measure will resolve the trash crisis that has snarled Naples streets in recent weeks.\n\n\"It does not fix the emergency,\" said Caldoro, \"neither in method nor in merit\".\n\nA central government measure passed last week permits the Campania region to export refuse to other parts of the country, though not without resistance from the regionalist Northern League party.\n\nArmed police escorts had recently begun accompanying garbage trucks as exasperated protesters had resorted to tipping over dumpsters, blocking traffic and setting fire to the growing piles of waste choking the daily flow of city life.\n\nNaples and the surrounding region of Campania have suffered similar crises periodically for a number of years.\n\nThe previous public outcry occurred last November when weeks of clashes and rising trash piles brought Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi to the city.\n\nIt was then that the premier, who won plaudits by sorting out a similar emergency in 2008, made a vow to clear the streets in three days.\n\nBut the problems have returned partly because of technical failures in local incinerators and the lack of investment in other landfill sites.\n\nThe issue is further complicated by the role of the local mafia, or Camorra, and claims that they have infiltrated waste management in Naples and dumped toxic waste on sites near residential areas.\n\nThe government has said it will present a plan within one month outlining a proposed solution to the crisis.\n\nProsecutors, however, say they have evidence showing the premier paid for intercourse with 33 alleged prostitutes after so-called 'bunga bunga' sex parties at his home near Milan, including Mahroug, who they say he slept with 13 times when she was 17 after she was allegedly recruited at a beauty contest at the age of 16.\n\nThree other people have also been indicted in the case on suspicion of procuring young women for the premier's alleged sex parties.\n\nThey are Berlusconi's former dental hygienist, ex-showgirl and now Lombardy regional councillor Nicole Minetti, the PdL official who was sent to the police station for Mahroug last year; a veteran news anchor at one of Berlusconi's TV channels and close personal friend of the premier's, Emilio Fede; and a showbiz talent scout and self-styled 'VIP impresario', Lele Mora.\n\nPercorso:ANSA.it News\n\nDozens arrested across Italy for human trafficking\n\nImmigrants shipped to France, Switzerland, Denmark and Austria\n\n(ANSA) - Rome, July 6 -\n\nPolice on Wednesday arrested dozens of people across Italy for allegedly trafficking thousands of immigrants across Europe.\n\nThe arrests followed an investigation, which began in May 2010 by the interior ministry's Central Operations Service (SCO), local police from Lecce, Bologna and Ravenna, and the National Anti-Mafia Directorate At least 18 people were arrested in Lombardy and Emilia Romagna in the north and in the southern regions of Lazio, Puglia, Abruzzo and Calabria.\n\nThey are alleged to have trafficked thousands of illegal immigrants of Afghan, Iraqi, Pakistani and Indian origin through cities including Rome, Milan, Bologna and Bari via a complex network headquartered in Greece and Turkey.\n\nPolice said many of the immigrants landed in both small boats and large ships along the Adriatic coast of Puglia and they were \"in constant fear for their lives\".\n\nOnce they landed in Italy, the immigrants were transferred to Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, Austria, France and Belgium.\n\n\"Today's operation has exposed a substantial trafficking of illegal immigrants,\" Vincenzo Carella, police commissioner of the southern city of Lecce told ANSA.\n\n\"In a year of investigations in Salento (province) we have intercepted more than 5,000 immigrants and conducted major prevention\".\n\nIn Rome at least 15 people were arrested on Wednesday for aiding and abetting illegal immigration.\n\nPolice claimed the operation included falsifying documents for residency and non-existent work.\n\nPiazza Chigi cafe shuttered in mafia asset seizure\n\n'Ndrangheta sting bags cafe near prime minister's palace in Rome\n\n(ANSA) - Rome, July 5 -\n\nItalian anti-mafia investigative forces (DIA) seized assets worth 20 million euros Tuesday, including a bar located across from the prime minister's residence in downtown Rome. The sting was aimed at businesses, real estate assets and commercial activities traceable to a subset of the Calabrian 'Ndrangheta mafia called 'ndrina dei Gallico di Palmi, based in Reggio Calabria.\n\nAssets taken included a mega-yacht, a 29-room villa outside Rome, and 18 businesses, among which was Antico Caffeé Chigi, located on the same Roman piazza as the Palazzo Chigi.\n\nThe café, strategically located between Roman seats of government power, remained dark and shuttered to clientele seeking cappuccinos and croissants Tuesday morning.\n\n\"It's impossible - 'Ndrangheta in front of the Palazzo Chigi. It is worrying,\" said a client in front of the cafe entrance. \"There was nothing suspicious and nothing made one think that organized crime could settle in the heart of Rome\". \"It's been a shock. I still can't believe it,\" said an ex-employee of the cafe. \"I worked here until two weeks ago, and it's a really weird thing. Who would have imagined it?\" \"This morning I went there for my usual coffee,\" said a local newsstand agent. \"But there was something strange - a water bucket in front of the entrance. In that moment I didn't understand why the police were in plain clothes. I heard the news a few minutes later on the radio\".\n\nDIA agents took other assets in and near Rome, including the offices of the holding company for the Gruppo Adonis, alleged to have conducted operations worth millions of euros despite modest declared earnings.\n\n\"I express my sincere appreciation for the DIA's great work against organized crime, which saw the seizure in Rome of substantial assets traceable to 'Ndrangheta,\" declared Rome's mayor Gianni Alemanno. \"This seizure demonstrates that institutions keep their guard up and defend the city from any form of infiltration of criminal (financial) capital\".\n\nThe Calabrian mafia or 'Ndrangheta is continuing to grow in Italy and abroad thanks to \"unlimited\" financial resources, according to an annual report from Italy's anti-mafia directorate (DNA), issued in March.\n\nThe growth of 'Ndrangheta, Italy's richest mafia because of its domination of the European cocaine trade, has not been stemmed by a series of high-profile police operations, the report said.\n\nDespite an \"incisive and extraordinary activity\" in fighting the Calabrian Mob, the report said, 'Ndrangheta \"is expanding more and more on the national and international levels, aiming to reaffirm its supremacy with unchanged arrogance, above all through its financial resources, which are now unlimited\".\n\nLombardy, the affluent region around Italy's financial capital Milan, had been victim to a \"full-fledged colonisation\", the DNA said. The directorate also said 'Ndrangheta was \"further refining its criminal activity\".\n\nThanks to its financial clout, the Calabrian syndicate has for some years been ranked the most powerful of Italy's four mafias, which include Cosa Nostra in Sicily, the Camorra in Naples, and the smaller Sacra Corona Unita (United Holy Crown) in Puglia.\n\nIt has carried out many vendetta killings in recent years including the massacre of six men in Duisburg, Germany, in August 2007, a crime that gained splash headlines for a syndicate that had been little known to the international public.\n\nThe Italian government has made the fight against 'Ndrangheta a priority and has set up its national mafia assets seizure agency in Reggio Calabria.\n\nA massive police operation in July 2010 caught 'Ndrangheta's No.1, the equivalent of Cosa Nostra's 'boss of bosses', as well as its chief in Lombardy and revealed that the Calabrians, already known to be more closely knit and impenetrable than Cosa Nostra, also had a hierarchy similar to that of the Sicilian Mafia.\n\nIn March, in a follow-up to last July's operation, 35 'Ndrangheta members were arrested in Calabria, Germany, Canada and Australia.\n\n'Ndrangheta, whose name means 'virtue' or 'heroism' in a local form of ancient Greek, once dealt mainly in kidnappings and extortion and fed off the pickings of public tenders, living in the shadow of its Sicilian cousin.\n\nBut it has since expanded to northern Italy, northern Europe and other countries, where it invests its huge drugs profits.\n\nItaly must 'cut spending to avoid crisis'\n\nCountry 'risks fate of Greece', says Confindustria\n\n(ANSA) - Rome, July 6 -\n\nItaly must cut public spending in order to avoid an economic crisis, said the president of Italy's industrial employers association Confindustria Wednesday.\n\n\"Our country has to cut spending or risk becoming like Greece,\" said Emma Marcegaglia. \"No one likes to make cuts, but we must\".\n\nHer comments come after the cabinet last week approved an austerity package designed to eliminate Italy's budget deficit by 2014 by generating 47 billion euros in savings to stop the country getting sucked into the Greek debt crisis.\n\nKey measures include cuts to funding for ministries and local authorities, tax increases on bank trading activities and on high consumption cars, a freeze on civil-servant pay and a new levy on stock-market transactions.\n\nItaly's fiscal system will be simplified too, with three tax bands of 20%, 30% and 40% set to replace the current five-band system by 2014.\n\nRating agencies Moody's and Standard & Poor's have warned they could downgrade the credit rating of Italy, which is also struggling with low growth and has a national debt of 120% of gross domestic product (GDP), one of the biggest in the world.\n\nItaly's budget deficit is forecast to fall to 3.9% of GDP this year, compared to 4.6% in 2010, thanks to measures already in place.\n\nThe cabinet-approved austerity package must now go through parliament.\n\nSiena Palio 'no longer untouchable' after latest horse death\n\nMinister responds to calls from animal lovers\n\n(ANSA) - Rome, July 1 - Repeated deaths of horses at the world-famous Palio race in Siena might force a rethink of the historic event, Tourism Minister Maria Vittoria Brambilla said Friday.\n\n\"I think the time has come to put to rigorous scrutiny the Palio di Siena and other competitions in which living creatures are exploited and risk their lives for the sole enjoyment of people,\" Brambilla said after a horse had to be put down after falling in a trial run for Saturday's race. Animal rights groups have been protesting for years over deaths of horses before and during the event.\n\n\"The Palio, in view of what repeatedly happens, can no longer consider itself untouchable,\" said Brambilla.\n\nFifty horses have died at the Palio since records of their deaths began in the 1970s. The colorful, chaotic bareback race in Siena's main square attracts thousands of visitors to the Tuscan town each year.\n\nBut animal rights activists have long been campaigning to get the event banned, saying it is cruel, has little to do with sporting skill and is dangerous for the horses, jockeys and spectators.\n\nSafety measures which organizers have introduced in the face of controversy include laying tufa sand over the cobble stones and padding the most dangerous corner of the circular course on the Piazza del Campo.\n\nThe square's stone surface is also monitored in an attempt to achieve the smoothest run and anti-doping checks have been introduced amid charges that the horses are drugged to improve their performance and mask their pain.\n\nThe Palio, meaning banner, dates back to the 13th century and takes place each year on July 2 and August 16. Jockeys from ten of Siena's 17 districts compete for the silk prize in a 90-second, no-holds-barred race.\n\nThe only rule in the competition is that the jockeys, or 'fantini', mustn't grab the reins of their adversaries. That means whipping a rival's horse or even knocking a jockey off his steed is allowed. Victory goes to the first horse to complete three laps of the square, even if it arrives at the finishing post without a rider.\n\nJuly 11\n\nRead On The Beach, in Normandy, France is an organization that sets up umbrellas on beaches and provides books to read for free in the summer time. What a wonderful idea!\n\nItalians don't need encouragement to go to the beach...La spiagga is what they clamor about, and when they're there squeezed among as many as can fit on the beach at one time, they're at their happiest. Well, even those poor Umbrese (people who live in Umbria) who do not have a beach and are the only province in Italy that is land locked...can't wait to travel East or West in this narrow country to find a beach when weather is warm.\n\nHere, Sofi makes her own swimming pool. She puts her front paws into her water bowl and moves it around until I find a bigger container and put it outside for her to dip in and cool off. It's not quite the right size, so she hops out after I use my hands to wipe water over her back and stomach. Of course, then she shakes herself off.\n\nShe's feeling much better, and this afternoon we pick up a little blue plastic container, just big enough for her and not too deep. Not worried about a little dirt, she takes a drink, then splashes her front paws about. Tomorrow we'll see if the size is just what she wants.\n\nSofi stays at home while we drive to Viterbo to shop when the stores open up at 4 PM. This is a good time to shop and the stores are not as full as they are in the mornings. I find the right container for the gutta at KLIMT, and tomorrow morning I'm going to begin to trace the outline of the orchid for the front of the dress.\n\nTonight at Coro practice, I learn that we're going to sing at Tiziano and Alessia's wedding and are to wear black! Well, our Coro costumes are black and white, so...Come no?.\n\nThere is so much cacciarata (gossip or chattering), for we're to name our group, and no one agrees on the name. I ask if we've finished singing and tell them Buona notte!, for I'd rather be at home with my two best pals than here in church, although I love these women and each and every one is very kind to me.\n\nJuly 12\n\nIt's another beautiful day, and I suspect will be quite warm later. My mind is on the gutta painting on silk, the fabric stretched on the wooden frame and waiting for me in the studio. I close the shutters upstairs to the sun, and recall how funny we were when first owning this house; we'd keep the shutters open all day, so infatuated with life here that we did not care how hot it was inside. We loved all of it, even the underbelly of it literally, when we realized we had a cesspool in back of our house instead of a septic system, which we were told in no uncertain terms. \"She seats twelve!\" Stefano the realtor told us proudly, meaning the system was engineered for as many as twelve people using the house.\n\nThe reality was that the plans that were submitted and approved were never acted upon. Years later, dear Stefano the muratore found himself face down in it with a garden hose, testing where the water went...It went under the house....\n\nNow we are properly engineered here; the stories now funny ones that were not so funny at the time.\n\nAfter colazione (breakfast), we return to put together a wooden and cardboard structure inside the wood and silk framed piece, for me to draw a precise gutta line around the design of the orchid, its stem long and finished near the hem of the dress with a few of its green leaves. Then it will be left to dry completely before beginning to paint the design.\n\nWhat is gutta? Gutta is a refined rubber-type product derived from the palaquium tree, which grows in south-east Asia. The product was historically known as gutta-percha and was used as a type of insulation, in cricket and golf balls, and as a glue. Because gutta resist is spirit-based, it must be dry-cleaned after steaming to remove the resist.\n\nAfter pranzo, I can't wait to get upstairs to paint, but we have Stein's daughter and her boyfriend to pick up from the Orte train station, and after we drive there, their train is delayed several times. It is great to see Ane and meet her boyfriend, Nils.\n\nBack at home, I look over the gutta, which as you know now keeps the paints from bleeding. The gutta is dry, so I spend a couple of hours painting, and only make a couple of mistakes; mistakes that I think I can correct later.\n\nWhat does it feel like to paint on silk? Oh, I feel transported to another heavenly place, and don't want to stop, although for my health I must.\n\nNearby, Dino sits at the computer while I paint, and calls out to me as he learns new information. He is full of joy in his own way, and it is as if we are gliding together on a magic carpet ride. He's researching his family tree, armed with a letter we have that was written by someone who knew the grandparents and great grandparents, outlining the family history.\n\nTonight is Coro practice in Attligliano for Tiziano's wedding; we'll wear our black Coro outfits for the ceremony, and I'll change afterward, perhaps even in the sacristy, for I don't want to change at home, since Sofi won't join us at the reception.\n\nBefore practice, Ane and Nils visit for a welcome prosecco. Stein's daughter is even more delightful than I recall, with her father's gentle spirit; full of life and wonder. Nils is also kind, a bit more serious but also shows an interesting and interested character. We look forward to getting to know them, but perhaps not on this trip. They are deciding whether to move on to Spain to join friends who are there now.\n\nAfter the visit, we drive le mie sorelle (my sisters) to Attigliano to Coro, where Angela guides us in the music we are to sing at the wedding mass for Tiziano and Alessia. Rosita chooses to sit next to me, and although she will not be in the Coro when we sing, for it is her son who is getting married, she gives her opinion on the pieces she likes the most. I have never seen her so full of such overwhelming joy and am very happy for her.\n\nWith all this talk about the \"wedding of the year\", we forgot to show you a picture of the happy couple:\n\nJuly 13\n\nLast night, I forgot to wear the night guard inside my mouth for the first time; perhaps that is the reason for the very vivid dreams. Hopefully a headache will not descend, and I take a look at the painted silk before catching up with you, looking forward to painting more after Dino returns.\n\nI continue to paint, and Dino continues to work on his family tree. How wonderful the electricity in the studio as we each work independently on our own projects, sharing our joy with each other as we do. Every now and then I call Dino over to look at the progress I am making, and how funny it took so long to realize that painting on silk is my heart's desire...after Dino, that is.\n\nI have always loved fabric. When I was about ten, I convinced my mother to buy yards of Laura Ashley Liberty fabric for me, in a design of lovely pink and rose-colored flowers. The fabric was expensive, as was the sewing machine; a machine I just had to have. Once I was given the machine, I purchased the most complicated shirtwaist design for the material, and to this day don't think I even finished it.\n\nJump forward twenty-five years or so to my wedding. I found a woman who knew how to paint flowers on silk fabric, and the theme of my wedding was Japanese inspired Art Deco, the color peach used as a focal point. The bridesmaids and maid of honor were to wear peach silk art deco long sheaths with cocoon wrapped hip length capes, also in peach silk, painted with huge Japanese style Deco flowers. Sound wild? What happens next is wilder yet...\n\nThe wedding was to take place on September 26, 1981, at 4PM in San Francisco, with a reception in Sausalito, so that we would drive over the Golden Gate Bridge to show my parents how beautiful and Art Deco the structure is. My parents lived outside Boston in a Southern suburb at the time.\n\nAt twenty minutes before the wedding, my phone rang, and the bridesmaids were all together when they called. \"I will tell you something and then we will move on\", Susan, a bridesmaid and also the wedding planner told me.\n\n\"We have no dresses!\" Silence. \"We do all have something to wear underneath our painted capes that will work. We'll see you at the church.\" The woman who was to make all the outfits had problems of her own, mostly with white powder, we presumed.\n\nIn the meantime, my mother's blue painted silk dress and matching silk coat, also painted by the same artist, showed up on the sidewalk, along with my nieces' little dresses, still a bit wet.\n\nMy mother quickly dressed and left after I ironed her dress and coat; then there was a photo of me being helped into my shoe by my father and his silver shoehorn, an inscribed wedding gift to him. He and my brother were wearing white tie and tails. You can tell I was into drama even then...\n\nAt four o'clock I told my father it was time to leave for the church, just a few blocks away, for I didn't want to keep Dino waiting, no matter what lay ahead. Did I tell you my brother was in crutches due to an accident before he left Boston for the wedding? Did I also tell you that we were married in a Christian Orthodox ceremony, since Dino was born a Catholic and the wedding to his first wife was not yet annulled, although they were divorced.\n\nBells began to peal, and the excitement was electric as my dear father walked me up the steps to a church completely unfamiliar to him. He was a Jew, and all this was quite preposterous to him, although I'd recently become an Orthodox Christian, after converting from Unitarianism. With dear Dino a Catholic, the rights are similar in both churches, except for the crowns, which were \"over the top\" wonderful.\n\nThe church was a tiny jewel box, and when inside my brother put down his crutches and walked around Dino and me three times with the crown over our heads, side by side with Susan, as did the other attendants with their partners. This is a standard part of the Orthodox wedding ceremony, and if you've seen the movie \"Deliverance\", you probably have seen the ceremony. No; no part of it took place in the mud, although hardly anyone remembers that a wedding took place in the movie...\n\nBack to the wedding, the service was quite dreamy, and afterward we walked downstairs to sign the wedding register. While in front of the wonderful priest, Father Seraphim, someone told us the attendants wedding outfits were beautiful, and asked me the significance of the black.\n\nI answered, without thinking twice, \"Could you imagine, the bridesmaids in black nightgowns!\" ... Followed by Father Seraphim, \"In MY CHURCH?\"\n\nThe stories are funny to tell now, although at the time I thought it was the worst of the worst of times, thankfully with Dino by my side to let me know that we'd conquer anything together.\n\nIt was not until we moved to Italy that my creative pursuits seemed to explode: first, violin playing until my shoulder suffered so badly that I had to stop after four years of bliss. Next came painting on ceramics; then painting with oil on canvas, and now painting right on silk. In the meantime came dress design for my grand daughters, including a family fashion show on Thanksgiving two Thanksgivings ago. If I had not fallen and hurt my foot last year, there would have been another.\n\nDesigning and sewing birthday presents of harem pants, scarves, turbans and tops followed this June for the girls' birthday, (see the photos in last month's journal) and you'll have to wait to see what will transpire between now and the time we return to San Francisco for another Thanksgiving.\n\nBack to today, I finish painting the orchids, but realize that the gutta is stuck to the wood and won't come off. All the research we find on the internet tells me that there should not have been anything located so close to the silk fabric. What to do? We end the evening with me wondering what to do, but happy with the design. I'm planning to make a yellow dress, with a white sheath overlay of the painted silk. Will it all be for naught?\n\nJuly 14\n\nI forgot to wear the night guard again last night, and don't have a headache. Let's be sure to remember to wear it from now on...\n\nAs Bastille Day arrives in France, with parades honoring soldiers in so many wars, including five who have just died in Afghanistan, we listen to the France24 news channel in English. We watch it most days, instead of CNN, for we like the European slant to the news, although these days it's full of the phone hacking and Dominic Strauss-Khan scandals. When Dino is out shopping or doing errands, Sofi and I listen to SKY classical music in the studio.\n\nEarlier this morning, my heart seemed to float through the air. Upon awaking, my painted design remained unchanged, as we wondered how to remove the gutta from the painted surface, allowing the silk to separate from the wooden backing.\n\nWe tried a hair dryer; we tried a steam iron; we tried a dry iron. And then Dino sat with a cue-tip dipped in water and was able to slowly separate the silk from the wood. We decided to take the tacks out of the silk frame and then submerge the entire silk and wooden backing into the bathtub, filled half way warm water.\n\nDino prepped the bathtub with about a foot of warm water, while I continued to iron on top of the silk, with two layers of cotton sheeting in between; the iron always moving in circles to prevent the silk fabric from burning.\n\nI walked down to the bathroom with the wood and silk, and lowered it into the tub. Luckily, the design is long and on the narrow side, so it fit beautifully into our small tub. Holding each side down for a few minutes, we each began to lift our sides of the design, and what emerged was perfection on silk. In addition, the silk bled through onto the wood, leaving a lovely batik-like design that stands against a wall of the studio.\n\nNow, the next step was to dry the silk out of the bright sun, so we put up a drying rack under the glycine (wisteria) and used clothes pins on the edges to keep the silk taut while it dries.\n\nDino leaves at this point in the old Panda to pick up wood remainders from Nando's wood shop to use in the pizza oven, while I stand over my handiwork and take a few photos of the silk drying on the terrace.\n\nThe material dries quickly, and although some instructions say to iron it before it dries, I don't do that. Instead, I fix Sofi's pranzo, marinate chicken for Dino to grill for our pranzo, and then we come upstairs to tell you all about it. Afterward, we switch gears to begin to fashion a yellow dress to wear under the painted silk fabric. Will I finish the dress in time to wear to Tiziano's wedding? Stay tuned...\n\nThe dress is mostly finished, except for final details at the arms and neck and the silk material. It's my intent to gather the front of the neck with the silk and attach it at the top, where I've previously cut a boat neck. The neckline will be covered with the silk drape, and there is probably enough to either fashion short sleeves with the silk or leave the dress sleeveless.\n\nWhat I'm not sure about is how to fashion a stiffener on three sides of the silk, so that it hangs well. Being a very light fabric, it needs some weight, but not too much. The next time Dino wants to drive to Viterbo, we'll stop at my now favorite tessutti (fabric) shop, and ask them. We've all become friendly; the manager even modeled one of the harem scarfs I purchased there for the girls and mothers' outfits, around his hips, giving us all a good laugh.\n\nI'm really tired, but in Evanne fashion, I just can't stop. I think I'm going to rest but find myself picking up wisteria cuttings as Dino thins the wisteria while standing on a ladder. I don't worry about him on a ladder; he's cautious, even asking me to \"foot\" him while he reaches far up into the middle of the bosco (forest) that covers the pergola shading our house from the summer sun.\n\nWe pick the little cherry tomatoes, which Dino does not like, and we also snip back the tops of the basil plants growing between the pomodori plants next to the summer kitchen.\n\nI'm going to make some bruschetta tomorrow with them, and Dino will like it. There is plenty of fresh basil around, and I'd like to make some pesto, but Dino tells me he does not like it. He later agrees that it's the strong garlic taste that he does not like, so I want to come up with a lemon basil pesto recipe that will taste fresh and not so garlicky. I'll fiddle around with it and put a recipe on the site if it comes out well.\n\nThere's plenty of wind today, and it's balmy, but I'm now too tired to make pizza for a bunch of pals tomorrow night. So Dino lets them all know, and everyone is kind. Kisses and thanks to you all, dear friends.\n\nPerhaps we'll even post on time for the first half of the month, since tomorrow is the fifteenth, and we've nothing specific to do, except finish the dress. Tomorrow we'll drive to Viterbo early and I'll take the silk with me to my favorite shop and ask them what to do about sizing the painted panel of silk on three sides.\n\nJuly 15\n\nWell, we have plenty to do, this morning in Viterbo again. I'm afraid of Sofi sitting in the car when it's hot, so she stays at home and we spend the morning doing what Dino does better than most of us...shopping. He's shopped since he was ten, given a list then from his mother who probably did not like shopping, and he's always been a great shopper. Today is no exception.\n\nWe stop first at my friendly fabric store, but he won't accompany me, telling me it's best that I practice my Italian conversation skills by myself. Va bene.\n\nInside, I show Daniela and the manager the silk I've painted, but want to see what silk they carry, and how expensive it is. The manager shows me two different mixes: one of silk and polyester and another polyester that he tells me I can paint on with the same results as pure silk. I roll my eyes, so surprised if he is correct, and try to be respectful of what he wants to show to me.\n\nDaniela walks over after finishing with a customer, and shows me the silk that they have...It's more expensive than that in the shop in Terni and is also heavier.\n\nWhile I'm showing Daniela the painted silk and speaking about finishing it off, a woman comes over to look at the painting and wants to tell us how we should finish it off, when I nix all the fancy ribbon and feathers I'm shown.\n\nShe takes the corner of the fabric and uses the word piega (fold), and it is then that I realize that hand rolling silk to make edges of scarfs are what I should do with the painted silk. Yes, it's a time staking project, but that does not bother me. I think it will be lovely.\n\nLet's stop for a minute: \"Time staking\" sounds strange, but the words are correct. I suppose the two words have to do with taking time, or \"times taking...\" What do you think, Don? Let's not forget, \"What do you think, Sofi?\" That sound you may hear is Sofi snoring next to the desk in the studio just now. Sweet dreams, dear doggie.\n\nIn the meantime, I take half a meter each of the two other options, each much cheaper than pure seta(silk), and back at home will make a silk scarf for each grand daughter, painting a sea scene with a fish for Marissa and an owl and a forest scene for Nicole while I test each piece for adaptability.\n\nWe do our other errands, including trying to see if there is an option to the existing cover on the parcheggio, one that needs cleaning and possibly replacing. The place in Viterbo where we purchased the original cover does not sell them now. So Dino will work out another option, and we discuss it back at home when we're getting out of the car.\n\nI am so happy we are not doing pizza tonight. I enjoy making it, but these painting silk projects are in the way right now, and I'm so tired from the past couple of days full of painting and sewing, although I'm mightily content.\n\nWhile Dino sleeps in the afternoon, I look for photos of fish and owls to paint on the pieces of fabric as tests, and later when he wakes up he'll help me to clamp the wood frame and anchor one piece of silk at a time into it, after which I'll use gutta to draw out the design, let it dry and then paint.\n\nWhen I'm not doing that, I'll be cutting the painted silk for the dress, rolling it and pinning it, to ready it for hand sewing of three edges. The top edge will have a graceful cowl neckline, and the top edge can be sewn into the neck lining. Depending on how it works out, there may be plenty of silk left to make more of a drape around my neck or sleeves. Two weeks to finish that should be sufficient, don't you think?\n\nThat all means that there won't be any news posting about Italy this first half of the month, other than to say that the country is in a financial mess and Parliament is voting on changes to put the government back on the right track. Berlusconi is being tried on four counts, only one for sexual misconduct, and that will go on and on.\n\nWe visit Tony and Pat for a short visit by their pool, and still have not taken a dip; tomorrow the water will be \"limpid\" as Pat tells us, so we know where they'll be then.\n\nBack home, Dino waters plants on the terrace while I try to figure out if there is a way to make a rolled hem with a sewing machine. There is an attachment, so perhaps tomorrow, or early next week, we'll take the sewing machine to Viterbo to see if we can buy the proper part. After reading everything, I'm tempted to do it myself without the machine. No matter than I'm an old...there's still so much to learn and I'm ready...\n\nStill no update on my citizenship status...More later, dear friends....\n\nJuly 16\n\nDino has another appointment at the hospital in Orvieto regarding tests for possible glaucoma. This is the second of three visits and all is well at this point.\n\nBack at home, I'm anxious to begin work on Marissa's painted silk scarf. I've stretched the silk and pinned it to the frame, but need to finish drawing the design on top and then drawing the lines over with gutta and let them dry before beginning to paint.\n\nThere's pranzo to have, and while Dino grills burgers, I fix a salad with zucchini flowers buffala mozzarella and anchovies over lettuce and a vinaigrette dressing. Burgers are very juicy, and isn't that the way they're supposed to taste? Dino tells me that is because they are chianina beef!\n\nDino posted the journal before he went to bed, and we're already receiving comments from readers who want to be notified as soon as we post. The numbers are growing, and I suppose it's a way of living one's life in dreams while pursuing other interests. Come no? (Why not?)\n\nThis afternoon I do the drawing for Marissa's piece freehand with a gray pencil, then use the lines to draw the gutta over it. Dino's already napping, so I might as well rest while it dries completely. I won't begin to paint until tomorrow, for the opening night of Jazz in Soriano is tonight.\n\nWe don't attend the jazz festival tonight; instead we relax at home...well, Dino waters the garden while I paint. I'm somewhat disappointed, for it appears the piece of fabric does not react as it should to the paint. The design of eight fish swimming at the bottom of the sea is fine, but in places the fabric clouds up. Tomorrow I'll paint in Marissa's name, and perhaps it will be a fun scarf for her to wear.\n\nJuly 17\n\nThere is Mass this morning, and we walk to church. In the church is the new family from France, and Paul, the husband and father, becomes my new best friend. I stand next to him on the front row of Coro: he has brought his portable organ, and plays some beautiful music before the start of the mass. He also has a wonderful voice, and is able to pick up the songs although we have no sheet music. After the mass, we meet the whole family.\n\nOne of the sons, Wolf, is the altar server, and when it comes time to shake hands, he shakes the hands of every person in the church! What a fine young boy! We look forward to getting to know them all, and since they will be here for most of the remainder of the summer, except the husband who has to work in Paris for a couple of more weeks, we will do just that.\n\nBack home, we fix pranzo, although I'd love to paint. After pranzo, I draw in Marissa's name to the painted silk and when the gutta is dry, I'll paint it. Then I'll paint a border around the design and will take it off the stretcher to replace it with the piece for Nicole, which will have an owl and a forest scene as its design.\n\nAfter a short rest, I'm able to take the silk off the stretcher, and reduce the stretcher to put on Nicole's piece. Before we leave for the borgo, to collect more names for the Albero Geneologico, I draw in three owls.\n\nWe put up the gazebo in the borgo, but conditions are just too windy. After a few false starts, we take it down and Carlo gives Dino quite a bit of family information. In an hour, we stop for the day, for Mauro wants to show Dino a house in Bomarzo he wants us to help him sell. They drop us off at home before leaving to drive up the hill in Mauro's car.\n\nLater, we pick up Nils and Ane and drive to the Tuscia in Jazz festival in Soriano. It's a lot of fun, although after 11PM I'm really tired and we walk back to the car with the sounds of live jazz serenading us. We're glad to be back listening to live jazz in the piazza.\n\nJuly 18\n\nThis morning, we take Ane and Nils to the train in Orte; where they'll catch a train to Rome. We loved their company and look forward to their next visit.\n\nAlthough it's Monday morning, a morning when most places are closed, we drive to Viterbo. The art store, Klimt, IS closed; we shop at one store that is open and return home for pranzo.\n\nI do want to return to painting, and do a bit, but need a dark brown or black for dramatic contrast, so we'll have to return to Viterbo...soon.\n\nHere's some of what's up around the country:\n\n(ANSA) - Milan, July 18 -\n\nA court in Milan on Monday ruled a sex trial involving Premier Silvio Berlusconi should stay in the northern Italian city, rejecting a defense plea to move it to a special tribunal for ministers in Rome.\n\nIn the trial, the 74-year-old Berlusconi is accused of paying an underage Moroccan-born runaway and belly dancer known as Ruby for sex.\n\nHe is also charged with abusing his office by allegedly pressuring police to get her out of custody after a friend claimed she stole money from her.\n\nBerlusconi and Ruby, whose real name is Karima El Mahroug, deny having sex and he says he phoned police to avoid a diplomatic incident, having been told she was the niece of former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak.\n\nThe Italian parliament has backed the premier's argument that he was carrying out his official duties in making the phone call and so the trial should go to the tribunal.\n\nThe Constitutional Court has been asked to rule on the matter and a decision is expected late this year.\n\nThe Ruby case was adjourned Monday until October 3.\n\nPaying for sex with a minor carries a jail term of three years and abuse of office 12 years.\n\nCourt dissolves Rome governing body in women's quota row\n\nMayor responds by naming former Roma soccer club president\n\n(ANSA) - Rome, July 15 -\n\nA court on Friday dissolved the city government of Rome in a row about women's quotas.\n\nThe regional court upheld a complaint from leftist and Green city councilors arguing Rome Mayor Gianni Alemanno had not appointed a \"sufficient\" number of women to the executive board.\n\nIn a snap response, Alemanno appointed the former president of AS Roma soccer club, Rosella Sensi, as a \"special official with a brief for sport and promoting the city\". Premier Silvio Berlusconi's People of Freedom (PdL) party, of which Alemanno is a key member, went into a huddle to weigh a response to the ruling.\n\nA PdL Senator, Andrea Augello, said he \"expected the matter to be resolved in a few days with the appointment of a new board with more women on it\".\n\nHe said \"50% of Italy's municipal boards would be in trouble if this ruling were to be applied at a national level\"\n\nPolice arrest 40 in anti-mafia drug crackdown -\n\n(ANSA) - Reggio Calabria, July 14 -\n\nForty people have been arrested in Italy, the US, Spain and the Netherlands in a major international crackdown on drug trafficking by the Calabrian mafia,'Ndrangheta.\n\nItalian police also seized hundreds of kilos of cocaine allegedly destined for Calabrian mafia cells to be sold in Italy and abroad.\n\nProsecutors in Reggio Calabria, Italy's anti-drugs agency and customs officials identified links between 'Ndrangheta and the Colombian and Mexican drug cartels that distribute drugs to the US and Europe.\n\nArrest warrants were issued in the southern regions of Calabria and Sicily, as well as Lazio and Lombardy in Italy's north in the operation dubbed Crime 3 (Crimine 3).\n\nAmong the international arrests were five alleged drug traffickers detained in Spain and the Netherlands while another three were arrested in Colombia, Venezuela and the US.\n\nThe operation followed a lengthy investigation by local police and elite anti-mafia police and previous anti-mafia operations in September 2008 and July 2010. Police allege various branches of the Calabrian mafia reached an agreement for control of the Calabrian port of Gioia Tauro to facilitate drug importation.\n\nInvestigators said they had identified the channels and the way in which the drugs were imported as well as money laundering activities associated with drugs sale and distribution.\n\nANSA English News\n\n-\n\nCat mourned in national newspaper -\n\n'He was my inspiration' says artist owner -\n\n(ANSA) - Milan, July 13 -\n\nA bereaved owner of a deceased cat took out a full-page ad in Italy's leading newspaper Wednesday to mourn the death of her feline companion.\n\n\"My profound feelings are beyond financial measure,\" said Luciana Matalon, 77, reflecting on the death of Sky, her 15-year-old cat, and her decision to publish a lavish obituary in Corriere della Sera.\n\nMatalon, a well-known artist in Milan, explained that Sky had filled a void left by the passing of her husband some years ago.\n\n\"I don't even know how I continued to work after his death,\" she said. \"Sometimes I would wake up in the morning and find an artwork completed that I didn't even remember doing\".\n\nSky changed that, giving the artist a zest for life she describes as \"catitude\", the feline version of gratitude.\n\nMatalon originally wished to transport Sky's remains in a helicopter to her home in Sardinia but encountered \"obstacles\".\n\nNothing, however, could stop her from publishing a solemn epitaph in the paper.\n\n\"I will soon be with you,\" it concludes.\n\n\"And we'll never leave each other ever again\".\n\nNearly stolen Caligula statue unveiled -\n\nThieves led police to archaeological site\n\n(ANSA) - Rome, July 12 -\n\nOfficials revealed a monumental statue believed to be of Roman Emperor Caligula Tuesday, announcing that an illegal dig pointed them to the major archaeological find.\n\nPolice stumbled upon the site near Lake Nemi, just south of Rome, after monitoring the area for suspicious activity, finding a truck \"hidden by rubble and intended for a foreign destination, probably Switzerland,\" said Massimo Rossi, head of the Archeological Heritage Protection Group.\n\nThe seizure, which led to the arrest of two antiquities thieves, had the fortuitous effect of leading authorities to the previously unknown site where Caligula is believed to have had an imperial residence.\n\nThe marble statue, which was broken into pieces, shows parts of a robed man sitting on an ornate throne with detailed pillow fringes, a Nike vase, a flower girl, rich drapery, a globe and a scepter.\n\n\"It's the only one (work) that represents Caligula as Zeus,\" said Maria Sapelli Ragni of the protection group.\n\nThe figure in the 2,000-year-old statue wears a \"caliga,\" the travelling sandals of Roman legionnaires and the trademark fashion statement of Caligula, from which his nickname was derived.\n\nHis actual name was Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus.\n\nCaligula, who ruled from the years 37 to 41, has gone down in history as a sex-crazed, power-hungry tyrant who publicly called himself a god, a fact which lends credibility to the claim that the Zeus statue is in his likeness.\n\nArcheologists have identified 250 artifacts at the site, of which 100 are fragments of the massive statue.\n\nOnce restored, the statue will be housed in the Museum of Roman Ships in Nemi.\n\nANSA English News -\n\nWoody Allen starts Rome shoot Bop Decameron in production\n\n(ANSA) - Rome, July 11 -\n\nIconic filmmaker Woody Allen began shooting scenes in Rome Monday for his new film The Bop Decameron.\n\nTraffic near the Piazza Augusto Imperatore went into a tailspin as onlookers stopped to catch a glimpse of Hollywood star Penelope Cruz along with Italian actors Antonio Albanese and Alessandra Mastronardi on the set.\n\nThe star-studded cast also features Alec Baldwin, Judy Davis, Roberto Benigni and Woody Allen himself, appearing on screen for the first time since his 2006 film Scoop.\n\n\"There just happened to be a part that I could play,\" said Allen, 75. \"I can't play the love interest anymore, which is tremendously frustrating\".\n\nAllen's film is alleged to be a 21st-century take on Giovanni Boccaccio's medieval collection of bawdy tales called The Decameron, scandalous in their time for placing revered public figures and clergy in compromising situations.\n\nAllen's version, slated to premiere in 2012, will consist of \"various tales interwoven\", he said, one of which involves his own character who travels to Rome with his wife \"because our daughter is going to marry an Italian boy that she met there, and we go over to meet him and meet his family, and what ensues\".\n\nThe cult US director, whose most critically acclaimed work has been based in his native New York, has not worked in Italy since 1996's Everyone Says I Love You, part of which was shot in Venice.\n\nThe Bop Decameron will be Allen's first film set in the Eternal City.\n\n\"Rome is a very romantic and beautiful city, like Barcelona, Paris, London and New York,\" said Allen.\n\n\"But much more so. I can't wait to get started here\".\n\nJuly 19\n\nToday is pedicure day at Giusy's, and she tells me I am her best client, for I've taken her advice and used a special cream on my feet to protect them from summer dryness. No matter, she gives the best pedicures ever!\n\nWe drive afterward to Viterbo with little Sofi, she gets her annual shot and we stop in at MacDonald's for a wrap and a burger.\n\nWe also pick up some black paint for silk, and back at home I continue a bit to work on one of Nicole's owls, the black paint just the touch we need to bring the animal to life, although the rest of the piece will take more than a week to complete. I've promised Dino not to spend too much time at any one sitting working. It's not good for my neck and shoulders and sometimes creates those darn headaches.\n\nThe best news is that the French family comes for a visit, minus Paul, who is back in Paris working for a couple of weeks. I just love each and every child, and here are a few photos to show you how delightful they are.\n\nWhen they all first arrived, the two smallest girls were very frightened of Sofi, but in no time at all they fell in love with her and now the older girl tells her mother she is not frightened... \"One bit!\" We look forward to getting to know them, and to having them all back to do drawing and playing here. Perhaps we'll even pick up some French. Allons!< (let's go! not exactly right, but please work with me here:)\n\nAs they walk back up the hill, Dino reminds the mother, Marie, they look like a scene out of Make Way For Ducklings, which was one of my very favorite children's books. It will be fun to see them playing in the Mugnano borgo this summer in the midst of all the local children.\n\nLooking up at the wisteria climbing around the balcony, I see a few pods hanging, and they are lovely. We love the change in the front of the house, as well as the shade that the plants bring, although these days have been mild in comparison to that of former July days and nights.\n\nTonight we return to Tuscia in Jazz in Soriano. Dino tells me to bring a scarf as well as wear a jacket. It will be cool.\n\nYes, it is cool...it also begins to mist...There are two tables under the awning of the nearby café, so we sit there, and Italo tells us they will move into the taverna if it does rain. In the meantime, men climb up on the scaffolding to protect the speakers and tarps cover the instruments on the stage. Things do not look promising outside.\n\nSofi behaves like a little brat next to me; she craves attention. So we decide to give up on tonight's jazz events and instead drive to Carlo's in Attigliano for our favorite boscaiola pizza. Since he's given Dino many pointers regarding our pizza oven, we do want to give him our business when we can.\n\nIf you are in the Attigliano area, his Pizzeria Girasole at the edge of the parking lot to Hotel Umbria, is worth visiting for a meal. Pizzas are very thin and crisp; the toppings quite good.\n\nWe return home and get into bed for a cool and breezy night.\n\nJuly 20\n\nWe've agreed on a design and a fabric to recover the parcheggio structure, and this morning Dino returns to Viterbo to work out the exact specifications with the shop that will make it after Sofi and I help him confirm a few measurements and I agree with him about how it will sit atop the structure. It should be ready in about a week.\n\nOver night, the silk painting of the owls has taken on new depth. I now need to draw in the trees with gutta and continue to work on the parts where the gutta is dry. I really should put this work away and begin to paint the grapes to take to Languedoc in September so that it will properly dry, but can't seem to take myself away from this latest adventure.\n\nSofi and I stay at home. Since she's my shadow, she follows me to the studio and sleeps while I paint three owls, a tree and leaves for Nicole's silk painting. Dino asks that I find a good place to put Nicole's name, and I'd like to weave it in somewhere.\n\nSkies are cloudy, but we do not expect rain. They remain overcast during pranzo, and afterward Dino drives to the post office to mail an envelope. The time between l'ora di pranzo (lunch hour, or 1-2 PM) is the best time to do business at a post office in Italy. As much as people need to transact business at the post office, nothing gets in the way of their midday meal. Afterward, the post office closes for the day.\n\nThe painting dries some more, but I've promised Dino and myself that I won't spend more than a couple of hours at a time painting. As I catch up with you I look over and would love to return to paint more leaves and detail of the tree, but it's not a good idea.\n\nDino has returned with a blowup of a photo of grapes. I have promised a painting to a winery in Languedoc for September, so I'm ready to draw the basics in with carta carbone (tracing paper) and then return to painting with oils.\n\nI will trace Nicole's name into the silk with a pale pencil and then trace the lines with gutta, before leaving it until tomorrow. Then I suppose I'll lie down and read from my kindle, a book by Anthony Trollope that must be quite long...although I have no idea how many pages there are, it will take quite a while to read it. Perhaps I'll check online to find out how many pages there are in book form, not that it matters.\n\nEight hundred pages! A good feature about reading a book on Kindle is that the format is small, and the book is not heavy. Why should everyone have a Kindle? For those who need the feel of a book to read, there is a cover available (mine is in blue) and it feels like holding a book. Dash that as a reason not to succumb to this new way of reading. (Now Dino has a Kindle app on his iPhone and loves it!).\n\nThe book, The Way We Live Now, by Anthony Trollop, is a satire, and although it was written in Victorian times, the subject is current as can be. I recommend it for a lazy summer read.\n\nI read a little, rest a little, but after an hour I'm up painting again, and surprise myself by finishing Nicole's painting! Now I feel badly that Marissa's silk painting that will become a scarf for her is not as sophisticated as Nicole's, so perhaps I'll paint her a special fish scarf to wear. Perhaps that idea is a bit smelly, so perhaps something else as a subject. What do you think, Sofi?\n\nWhile Nicole's painting dries, I'll take it off the new table and put it somewhere while I put the new attachment on the sewing machine to see if I can figure out how to use it to make a rolled hem on silk fabric.\n\nAll three paintings I've done need rolled hems, including the one with a painted cymbidium orchid that I might wear to Tiziano's wedding; it will sit on top of a yellow shift I've also made; one that will have yellow cord hand sewn on top of the side seams.\n\nThe ideas won't stop, nor will the projects; the more I do the more I dream and the more I dream the more I invent; the more I invent, the more I paint and sew...it's as if I'm on drugs, but I'm not really...I'm just having the time of my life! Grazie mille, dear Lord!\n\nJuly 21\n\nPlumbago in the morning sun! We wake up to mild temperatures again, and I can't resist taking a few photos to show you how lovely these flowers continue to bloom throughout summertime.\n\nNotice the little stone fellow in a planter in the foreground of one? He originally held court in the back yard of the San Francisco house where Dino spent his childhood. We love having him here with us.\n\nBirdsong abounds; is it a good example of perception versus reality? We think the sounds are glorious; do the birds sing to guard their turfs? I'm not sure.\n\nDino drives off to the next town to pick up lettuce plugs and mozzarella di bufala to have with the first giganti pomodori from our orto at lunch, along with a risotto made with what's left from yesterday's pollo arrosto (roast chicken), purchased from IPERCOOP.\n\nOh. We did not buy pollo arrosto yesterday, but have plenty of sausage and grapes. Well, why not make my very favorite summer risotto alla limone (lemon risotto). It's fine to have this one with cheese and butter and there is plenty of it, along with lemon juice and lemon zest and chopped presemolo (parsley).\n\nAs good as that is by itself, we'll also have an insalata caprese with fresh mozzarella di bufala, our first tomatoes from the garden and plenty of fresh basil, smelling so fragrant in a pot right outside the front door.\n\nBefore l'ora di pranzo, Joan and Patrick, our Irish friends who are here part time, living outside Montecchio, arrive on their way up from the airport with another couple Bernadette and Kevin. There's time for café and sweet biscuits, and before they arrive I walk up the street to meet Giovanna to give her copies of the Coro music I've been asked to reproduce. Are we the only folks in town with a copier?\n\nAfter pranzo, Nicole's painted owls are dry; instead of removing the fabric from the frame yesterday, I let them rest a bit. The gutta (a clear substance painted as a resist, keeping colors from spreading over each other) should dissolve in a warm water bath; I'm somewhat nervous about plunging the silk into warm water in the event any of it bleeds and thereby ruins the image. Let's not worry about it now...\n\nInstead, we're going to take out the sewing machine and insert the attachment to roll the edge of the silk to make a kind of handkerchief edge. Hold your breath...as I will.\n\nI ask Joan if she knows how to make a rolled hem on a sewing machine, and she does not but counsels me to do it by hand with an iron and pins.\n\nAfter they leave, I do take the silk off the stretcher and make it smaller, for there is a remnant of silk that I can use to make a nicer fish painted scarf for Marissa. I'm feeling that the one I painted for her does not measure up to the owls I painted for Nicole, so let's see what I can design for this dear one.\n\nI decide to paint her as a mermaid, floating on top of the water with fish swimming underneath and bubbles here and there. The design is fine, I mark it off with gray pencil, and tomorrow I'll squeeze on the gutta to keep the paint of the design from running. In the meantime, I can do the hand hemming of the silk for my dress.\n\nLet's slow down...and do nothing, instead. Dino waters in the garden, and I don't even feed the roses. All of it will have to wait for another day...\n\nJuly 22\n\nHow sad. While we were enjoying our visit to France a couple of months ago, local farmers there were experiencing a drought of epic proportions. Unable to feed their cattle with grass, the cattle were sold early, the prices were not good, and so the cycle continued with many farmers facing the end of decades of this livelihood.\n\nThis affects us all. With no meat from local farmers, we'll all be forced to purchase South American beef, costing more, and so the cycle for us continues as well. Today we'll probably eat a salatone (large salad) for pranzo, but one of the good things about living here is that we're more aware of the world around us.\n\nDino drives off for spesa (shopping), and I finish the design of Marissa's latest scarf, with her as a mermaid floating on top of the sea and fish swimming about below the surface.\n\nDrawing the gutta on the silk first in unbroken lines is important, for it is called a \"resist\", as it keeps colors from bleeding, either onto other colors or onto the silk surface in general. I remember this time to separate the silk from the wooden backing that I use to do the drawing, before it sticks.\n\nIn an hour or so, I'll be able to paint, but in the meantime there is a story on CNN's Backstory about the Pantheon in Rome, and we tape it so that Tiziano can see it later. I call him to tell him we need to get together to plan how one of us will contact CNN online to spread the word about the local bricks being used to construct the Pantheon two thousand years ago.\n\nI call them \"his bricks\" because he uncovered the kilns where they were made two thousand years ago; as an archaeologist he needs to raise money to build a roof over the area. Now the site is covered over with soil; with no money, his work cannot continue.\n\nDear readers, step up! Contact me and I will put you in touch with our dear friend to help him. We'll be talking together later about putting special archaeological tours together that he will give in English about places and sites in this area an hour North of Rome that the regular tourist will never see. Perhaps donations of a certain amount will allow you to take these tours with him. Will they be tax deductible? You'll have to ask your accountant or commercialista. We're just the messengers...\n\nWhy were the bricks made in Mugnano in Teverina for construction projects in Rome? Well, they were loaded onto barges and floated down the Tiber River to Rome, making their transport logical. Come no? It's a bit cooler today, and I'm looking forward to painting Marissa's scarf as soon as the gutta is dry. Working only for two hours at a time on any one project, I'm feeling better, and there are so many types of projects that I will: paint on silk a bit, sew the rolled hem by hand of the silk for the yellow dress, catch up with you, fix pranzo, garden a bit, return to painting...perhaps lie down and read and take a nap...\n\n...and so fills my days. Dino. on the other hand, has taken the top cover off the parcheggio, donned his painting clothes and painted the structure in an almost black color as we wait for the new cover to be fabricated.\n\nThis afternoon he'll be working with Paolo, who will install new doors to the cucina estaté; doors that have screens to keep out the cats and hopefully also the flies and mosquitoes. We no longer find the cats here, but it's still a good idea.\n\nSome readers tell us they are breathless after reading our journal; do we ever slow down? I suppose after we die there'll be plenty of time...for now, it keeps us young and happy.\n\nIf only Terence and his family were closer...but it's not a perfect world. In the meantime, Dino is his son's webmaster, keeping the car inventory updated, when not working on the albero geneologico di Mugnano and I continue to make things for the girls, including dear Angie, to wear and to enjoy, as well as to paint on canvas, with the grapes to be painted in the next couple of weeks. So we're filled with love as we do what we do and love best...\n\nDon should have arrived in Tenaglie yesterday; hence the sciopero (strike) of the trains in Rome for today and tomorrow will not affect him. He'll be here with his brother and his brother's children, and next week there'll be a pizza night for them all. Yesterday we told Patrick and Joan they'll have to wait until they return in September for their pizza night, for two sets of folks have lined up before them. Va bene.\n\nPizza nights here are for eight people, including us. That means that we'll serve one pizza at a time, each pie sliced in eight pieces. Each person will have a slice of each pizza, and will be able to judge each pie as a bit of fun with his/her own scoring sheet. We find that five pizzas an evening plus a dessert is the right amount to serve. For more than eight people, it will be too unwieldy for us to handle, and less fun. As it is, it takes a day's preparation to pull this off well...\n\nI continue to come up with new toppings, and sausage and grapes, a la Artusi, will be one to use soon. Come no? Dino returns home from shopping with beef fillets and we'll have them with caprese for a simple pranzo.\n\nWhy do we write and publish our journal? Friends asked us when we moved here what we'd find to do all day. One great friend, Bob Kalsey, gave us a web site as a going away gift (was he happy to be rid of us?). We're people who are happy to share, and as we grow older, forget things we've done.\n\nWe think that documenting the days will be fun reading later. Whenever I tell you we won't publish the journal anymore, we hear from people, including those we would not expect, how much they enjoy living vicariously through the journal. And so it continues...\n\nTiziano arrives mid afternoon, as does Paolo to install the new screen doors in the summer kitchen, so work continues upstairs in the studio as well as outside in the summer kitchen. Who thinks our lives are always mellow?\n\nTiziano confirms that he and Alessia will have their luna di miele (honeymoon) here at our house when we are in Languedoc in September, so the house will not be left unoccupied.\n\nOn Monday Dino and I hope to visit Tiziano at a special archeological dig near Sipicciano and he and I will write the story about its find for Italian Notebook. Stay tuned, unless you are a subscriber to italiannotebook.com, and which point you will receive a copy of it yourself some day.\n\nAfter he and Paolo leave, I return to the studio and finish most of Marissa's painting. I can finish it tomorrow, then move on to the painting of grapes.\n\nWe stay at home tonight, for I'm really tired, planning to return to the festival on Sunday with Candace and Frank and then have a pizza night on Monday with Don and his relatives and also Candace and Frank.\n\nHow we love our new doors and screens for the summer kitchen! Little Sofi soon learns that we need to let her in and out of them now, so she does not bound up the stairs thinking the space remains open.\n\nJuly 23\n\nLast night a terrible bombing and shooting occurred in Oslo and on a nearby island; it has us worried about our friends, and about the people who have endured this nightmare. We await news from them, as skies here are full of rain, bursting overnight and continuing throughout the morning as a reminder that the world, even in the most peaceful places, is vulnerable to terrorist acts.\n\nDino drives off as I finish Marissa's silk scarf painting and set it aside to dry. It's a good day to hand roll the hems of the three silk scarfs I've painted so far, and we'll see how far I get before I switch to figure out how to do it on the machine. Sewing the borders by hand gives more of a personal touch, and since I love our grand daughters so, this brings me joy as I sew.\n\nOnce the hems are finished, I will set each one separately into warm water to remove the gutta and then set them aside with other things to fly with us to San Francisco in November.\n\nMeanwhile, all over the world there has been an outcry against mandatory celibacy for priests, their inability to marry, and the ordination of women into the priesthood. Here's a little of what CNN has to say:\n\nChurch scholars note that for the first time in years, groups of priests in several countries are standing with those who are challenging the church to rethink the all-male celibate priesthood.\n\nThe Vatican has declared that the issue of women's ordination is not open for discussion. But priests are on the front line of the clergy shortage - stretched thin and serving multiple parishes - and in part, this is what is driving some of them to speak.\n\nAll I can say is, \"Hooray!\" See this story in the NYT to read more about it yourselves.\n\nWith the terrorist acts in Norway and this news, are you wondering what balance is shifting all over the world? I continue to think positively; that basic rights of people who do believe in spirituality can do a lot to rid the world of hate. Let's think positively and try not to judge our fellow man/woman. Thanks.\n\nWe email our Norwegian pals, and those in Oslo are fine, watching the tv and the island from a high vantage point. Keep them in your prayers.\n\nHere skies are furious, pouring down in such force that we're imagining heaven is angry as a result of the attacks in Norway, deaths now surpassing ninety. The perpetrator appears to be a right wing Christian extremist, angry with the mounting multi-cultural changes in the country.\n\nRain ends, and wonderfully complex clouds overhead seem to breathe in and out with the sounds of the cicadas outside the window of the studio. Inside I begin to hand sew the hem of the painted silk for my yellow dress. When I finish this, I'll attach the top of it to the neck of the dress and see if I should wear it to Tiziano and Alessia's wedding.\n\nThis is a Formula-1 weekend, in Germany this weekend, and Sofi and I spend time in the studio while Dino watches the trials in the kitchen to learn who will be in pole position and in what order the first ten drivers will be positioned tomorrow...zzzzzzzzzz\n\nWhile Dino takes a nap, I finish hand sewing the rolled edges of the silk panel that will form a collar and overlay over the yellow dress. I want to move on to something else, so it is set aside for tomorrow, when I'll pick it up again and hopefully finish the entire dress.\n\nMonday night is a pizza night here for Don and his brother and two youngsters, but I think it is also a Coro wedding singing rehearsal, so if it is, I'll have someone drive me up there a bit late...\n\nWanting to slow down, I let the cicadas scratch outside the window, while lying down to read...\n\nSoon I'm up again; this time hand sewing the rolled edge of Marissa's scarf; I finish about half of it and then give in to watching tv for the evening, with snacks for us of Norwegian salmon and cream cheese and dill in honor of everyone in Norway right now.\n\nJuly 24\n\nHappy Birthday to Terence!\n\nOn this day of clouds and blue sky, we walk up to mass, where we come upon Don Angelo. I ask him if he will say a prayer for those in Norway, and tell him that one retired Lutheran priest and another woman are both residents of Mugnano. He agrees, and does so. We are thankful for him, and for his prayers.\n\nAfter mass, Dino does his giro (walk) with Enzo to do the monthly collection as part of his job as a member of the Festaroli committee.\n\nI walk home by myself, feeling so full of love for my place in this life, and for the blessings bringing me to this village, a village I adore. Yes, as I walk down the hill and look out to the undulating Tiber, I am at peace. In his way, Dino feels about the same. We have been truly blessed.\n\nAt home, I watch the mass in the cathedral in Oslo, a mass of grief and hope. The Gospel according to John is read, and its words are profound. In God's house there are many rooms...\n\nIt's also a good day to share the words of the hymn we sung earlier this morning;\n\nChi berrà la mia acqua non avrà piu sete in eterno\n\ne quest'acqua sarà per lui fonte di vita per l'eternità.\n\nAffannati e stanchi, voi oppressi e poveri venite,\n\nattingete con goia a Lui alla sorgente di felicità.\n\nFiumi di acqua viva sgorgheranno in colui che crederà\n\nnel Signore che dona a noi l'acqua di vita e di verità.\n\nPercuotendo una roccia dissetasti il popolo in cammino;\n\nFa' che sempre noi "
