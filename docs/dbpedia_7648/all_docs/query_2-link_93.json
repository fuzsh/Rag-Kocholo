As per the will, Berlusconi left control of his business empire to his two eldest children, aged 56 and 54, and another $3.36 billion to a business associate.\n\nAs per the Italian news agency Ansa, Berlusconi’s children, Marina and Pier Silvio, with his first wife, will hold a combined stake of 53 per cent in Fininvest.\n\nBerlusconi’s vast wealth includes the AC Monza football club, properties, yachts and artworks, but the main asset is Mediaset, Italy’s largest commercial broadcaster and vehicle for his domination of the national debate.\n\nAlso Read | Captured on camera: Body cam footage from biggest jewellery heist in US history reveals unknown facts\n\nThe details of the three-time Italian prime minister’s will were released on Thursday, July 6, three weeks after thousands attended his state funeral in Milan. Berlusconi succumbed to Leaukaemia on June 12.\n\nFascina, 33, began her relationship with Berlusconi in 2020 and the pair even held a “symbolic” marriage ceremony in March 2020. Former Italian PM reportedly referred to Fascina as his “wife” on his deathbed. But the majority of people in Italy don’t believe this, and have always considered their relationship a “mockery”.\n\nWho is Marta Fascina?\n\nMarta Fascina is an Italian politician and President of Forza Italia, the centre-right political party. This party was started by Berlusconi himself in 1994.\n\nWatch | Silvio Berlusconi dies at the age at 86\n\nFascina graduated with a degree in literature and philosophy from Rome’s Sapienza University. She began working for the AC Milan football club as a press officer. The 33-year-old kick-started her political career by writing a series of articles for a newspaper backing Forza Italia.\n\nShe has also been a member of the Chamber of Deputies since the 2018 Italian general election.\n\nSilvio and Marta’s ‘symbolic’ wedding\n\nSilvio and Marta started their relationship in 2020 after Berlusconi broke off his long-term relationship with his girlfriend Francesca Pascale. In March 2023, both staged a “symbolic wedding” in an unofficial ceremony.\n\nTheir marriage was dubbed a “festival of love”. It was the third wedding ceremony of the former PM. But this time, it was not a marriage in the eyes of the law.\n\nAlso Read | Alien scare | Vegas family, who complained about aliens in backyard, threaten to shoot any UFO sleuths\n\nAccording to the Italian press, Marta was \"offended and very angry about not having a proper wedding\". However, Vittorio Sgarbi, the MP and art critic told The Times: \"Although there was no priest or public official, it was like a real wedding.\n\n\"Berlusconi was full of happiness as he told Marta she was 'a gift from the heavens'\".\n\n(With inputs from agencies)\n\nWATCH WION LIVE HERE\n\nYou can now write for wionews.com and be a part of the community.
