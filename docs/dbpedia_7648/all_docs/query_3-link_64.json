        "text": "Standard & Poor's lowered Italy's credit rating on Wednesday, dealing the latest in a series of blows that has threatened the stability of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's government, the country's longest lasting since the end of World War II.\n\nThe decision by S&P, which cut Italy's rating to AA-minus from AA, comes just days after Berlusconi decided to take over the role of economy minister rather than find an immediate replacement for Giulio Tremonti, who was forced out over the weekend because of political infighting.\n\nIn downgrading Italy's rating, S&P showed that it was not convinced by Berlusconi's pledge to European Union finance ministers on Monday to shore up Italy's budget with spending cuts and revenue-raising projects worth â‚¬7.5 billion, or $9.3 billion. It is the first downgrade of a Group of 7 country since S&P reduced Japan's credit rating two years ago, and it means that Italy will have to pay more interest to persuade investors to hold its bonds.\n\n\"The move by S&P is confirmation that Italy's finances have deteriorated and it has become clear that nothing can be done in the short term to help,\" said Lorenzo Codogno, an analyst with Bank of America in London. \"On the one hand it is probably true that there won't be any maverick behavior by the Italian government, but at the same time we shouldn't expect significant improvements in the public finances.\"\n\nIn taking over the role of economy minister, Berlusconi said one of his goals was to push through the tax cuts he promised as part of his electoral platform. While the Italian government estimates that the budget deficit this year, taking into account the tax cuts, will come in at 2.9 percent of gross domestic product, the EU forecasts that it will be 3.2 percent.\n\nWhile France and Germany have flouted EU budget rules that put a limit on yearly deficits of 3 percent of GDP, Italy's situation is different because Berlusconi also must battle with an accumulated public debt that is more than the country's yearly gross domestic product. S&P says that Italy's total debt will not improve significantly for the rest of the decade and forecasts that the deficit will be about 3 percent of GDP this year.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
