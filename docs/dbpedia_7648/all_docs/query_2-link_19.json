        "text": "Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was discharged from hospital Friday, after more than a month of treatment.\n\nThe 86-year-old Forza Italia leader was rushed into intensive care on April 5 after suffering from severe breathlessness. Hospital doctors later confirmed that he was being treated for a type of chronic leukemia.\n\n“Good news. Come on Silvio. We are waiting for you on the field to fight many battles together,” wrote Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni on Twitter, announcing that her ally in Italy’s right-wing coalition government had been discharged from the hospital.\n\nIn video footage, Berlusconi waved from the back seat of an Audi as he exited the hospital\n\nBerlusconi’s health had started showing signs of improvement in the last couple of weeks. On May 6, Berlusconi sent two video messages from the hospital to his party members and supporters saying he was ready to return to work.\n\nOn Sunday, Meloni and Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini visited Berlusconi and said that he was in a “good mood” and “recovering rapidly.”\n\nThe right-wing Forza Italia has no designated successor ready to replace him."
