        "text": "Milan’s largest airport is set to be renamed in honour of Italy’s former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi - and the move has caused a huge row.\n\nMalpensa airport, also the second-busiest in Italy, had the name change confirmed by Matteo Salvini, Italy’s deputy prime minister and minister of infrastructure and transport.\n\nAnnouncing the decision, he took to social media saying: “Good news: Milan Malpensa airport will be named after Silvio Berlusconi.”\n\nSalvini says officials from the Lombardy region - where the airport is based - requested the change around a year ago, which was accepted by the board of directors of the country’s National Civil Aviation Authority (ENAC) last week.\n\nThis acceptance, though, has caused an outcry in Italy.\n\nA petition launched by the left-wing Young Democrats of Lombardy group calling on the relevant authorities to reconsider has reached more than 16,000 signatures.\n\nMilan's centre left Mayor Beppe Sala accused ENAC of giving in to pressure from conservative circles including right-wing Minister Salvini and going ahead without consulting SEA, the company that runs Milan's airports.\n\nWhy are people up in arms about the potential renaming of Malpensa airport?\n\nBerlusconi’s name and controversy go hand-in-hand.\n\nThe late billionaire was elected prime minister of Italy three times and served for a total of nine years - that’s longer than anyone since the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini was in power.\n\nBerlusconi, who once described himself as the “Jesus Christ of politics,” died in June last year at the age of 86.\n\nKnown for his often controversial right-wing views, Berlusconi appeared in court multiple times - as well as parliament - over his long career.\n\nHe was tried on charges ranging from bribery and corruption to tax evasion and having sex with an underage sex worker.\n\nHe was eventually convicted of tax fraud and embroiled in countless sex scandals - reasons why opposition parties and groups are strongly against naming one of Italy's most important international hubs after him.\n\nThe leader of the left-wing FiveStar Movement in Lombardy, Nicola Di Marco, argued in a post on Facebook that naming the airport after Berlusconi is \"a sign of the total decay of Italian institutions.\"\n\nMarco Grimaldi, an MP for the Green/Left Alliance, said, \"I for one would be ashamed to take a flight from Falcone and Borsellino Airport and land at Silvio Berlusconi Airport\". Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino were Italian judges killed while prosecuting the mafia.\n\nThe Young Democrats launched their petition on Sunday, adding to the mounting criticism.\n\nThey argued that the airport deserves a name “that embodies values ​​of honesty, integrity and service to the community,” adding that “Berlusconi does not reflect those values, as demonstrated by the numerous criminal convictions he has received over the years.”\n\n\"We do not want it to stay just a petition, but also to tell the story of a generation who no longer wants to support the glorification of politics and of a person that had been sentenced for fraud, had been under investigation for child prostitutions [sic] and corruption,\" Tiziana Elli, the group's manager, said.\n\nBerlusconi’s colleagues and supporters, though, have very different opinions. Many still praise him for his apparent charisma, entrepreneurial nous and contributions to Italy’s political and economic landscapes.\n\nWhile it’s unclear when exactly Malpensa - which offers flights to 180 destinations in 77 countries - will officially be renamed, Matteo Salvini is determined that the change will go ahead."
