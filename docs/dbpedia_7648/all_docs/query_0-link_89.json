        "text": "Italian Finance Minister Giulio Tremonti has canceled his participation in the EU ministerial meeting in Brussels to return to Rome where a parliamentary vote is expected, important for the future of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.\n\nThe vote on the budget is an important test for Berlusconi, ahead of the vote scheduled in the next few days on the economic measures against the crisis, the implementation of which the prime minister promised to the European Union last month.\n\nBerlusconi's government is under great pressure to quickly implement reforms to prevent an escalation of Italy's debt crisis.\n\nThe vote of confidence will depend on the votes of only a few deputies who, according to the Italian media, are undecided for now\n\nHowever, reforms are delayed due to a weak coalition. Late on Monday evening, the Prime Minister held consultations with his closest associates, and the Italian media reports that, despite calls from coalition partners and his advisors, Berlusconi refuses to step down.\n\n\"You don't understand, I was born at the polls and, if I have to die, I will do it in parliament. I will not resign because some leave the party or have doubts. I may have made some mistakes, but I am not giving up on my principles,\" he said. Berlusconi.\n\nThe media reports that Berlusconi's coalition has a secure 311 votes in the parliament, while the opposition, if it remains united, can have the support of 315 deputies.\n\nThus, the vote of confidence will depend on the votes of only a few deputies who, as the Italian media comment, are undecided for now.\n\nBerlusconi therefore tried on Monday to win the votes of some parliamentarians who recently left his PDL party, but they still did not change their decisions, reports Corriere della Sera newspaper.\n\nGallery"
