        "text": "Former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi has died aged 86, the country’s leading news agency, Ansa, has reported.\n\nThe media tycoon, who led three governments between 1994 and 2011 and whose Forza Italia party is a junior partner in Italy’s ruling coalition, had been diagnosed with leukaemia some time ago.\n\nBerlusconi was one of Italy’s most flamboyant politicians, making a comeback in 2017 despite a career tainted by sex scandals, countless allegations of corruption and a tax fraud conviction.\n\nHe died at the San Raffaele hospital in Milan, where he had spent six weeks this spring undergoing treatment for a lung infection linked to a chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia before being readmitted.\n\nBorn in Milan in 1936 to a middle-class family, Berlusconi began his business career in property development before going on to found Mediaset, Italy’s largest commercial broadcaster. He also owned AC Milan football club between 1986 and 2017.\n\nForza Italia was founded in 1993. A year later, Berlusconi was the first prime minister to be elected without previously having held a government office. His second term in office, between 2001 and 2006, was the longest served by any Italian leader since the second world war. He returned to power in 2008 but was forced to resign in 2011 amid an acute debt crisis.\n\nBerlusconi was convicted of tax fraud in late 2012, for which he served his year-long sentence doing part-time community service at a residential home in Milan. His ban on running for office was lifted in time for the general elections in 2018, when Forza Italia ran in coalition with the League and Brothers of Italy but fell short of the 40% required to govern.\n\nIn 2019, Berlusconi won a seat in the European parliament, and in general elections in October 2022 his party returned to power in a coalition led by Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy. Berlusconi was also elected as a senator.\n\nMeloni said on Monday: “Silvio Berlusconi was above all a fighter. He was a man who was never afraid to stand up for his convictions, and it was exactly that courage and determination that made him one of the most influential men in the history of Italy.” Matteo Salvini, the deputy prime minister, described Berlusconi as “a great friend and a great Italian man”.\n\nNicknamed Il Cavaliere (the knight), Berlusconi was often considered the “kingmaker” in Italian politics. In 2016, he had surgery to replace a faulty aortic valve, and was admitted to hospital with Covid in September 2020. He had lingering complications related to the virus, an experience he described as “the worst of my life”.\n\nHe married twice, and was in a relationship with Francesca Pascale, 37, for seven years before a relationship with 33-year-old Marta Fascina, an MP with Forza Italia with whom he had a “symbolic marriage” in March 2022. He is survived by five children.\n\nItaly’s defence minister, Guido Crosetto, described Berlusconi’s death as “a great, enormous pain”. ‘‘He leaves a huge void because he was great. An era is over, an era is closing. I loved him very much. Goodbye Silvio.”\n\nHis rivals too united in paying tribute. One of the first to react was the former European Commission president Romano Prodi, perhaps Berlusconi’s bitterest political foe.\n\n“We represented different and opposing worlds, but our rivalry never turned into sentiments of animosity on a personal level, and the debate remained within the sphere of mutual respect,” Prodi said.\n\nThe secretary of the centre-left Democratic party, Elly Schlein, expressed her party’s “deepest condolences”.\n\n“Everything has divided us and divides us from his political vision, but the human respect to a person who was a protagonist of our country’s history remains,” she said. “Deepest condolences from the Democratic party.’’\n\nItaly’s former prime minister Matteo Renzi described Berlusconi as a history-maker. “Many loved him, many hated him; today everyone must recognise that his impact on political life but also on economic, sporting and television life was unprecedented.”\n\nA statement from Monza said: “Forever with us. A void that can never be filled. Thanks for everything, president.”\n\nBerlusconi’s body would be transferred to his home at Villa San Martino in Arcore, north of Milan, sources said. His funeral is likely to take place at Milan Cathedral."
