He was 86.\n\nThe former premier was hospitalized Friday in Milan just three weeks after being released from a previous treatment after a long history of health ailments, including contracting Covid-19. This year he was treated for a pulmonary infection linked to chronic leukemia. His passing was confirmed on state television by the deputy coordinator of his Forza Italia party."
