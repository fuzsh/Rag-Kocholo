        "text": "He's an erudite lawyer and professor who is taking on one of Europe's toughest jobs. As incoming finance supremo in Silvio Berlusconi's new center-right government, Giulio Tremonti's brief will be to revitalize Italy's economy. He plans to apply a serious dose of liberal policy to an economy that was mostly state-run just a decade ago and still bears the scars of government mismanagement and rampant corruption.\n\nThis is the second time Tremonti, 53, has tackled this difficult task. He was Finance Minister in the first government Berlusconi headed, in 1994. Although that one lasted only seven months, Tremonti managed to enact a law that provided a tax cut for reinvested profits. This time, he aims to go much further. He wants to slash the corporate tax rate from 50% to 33%. He also intends to streamline Italy's vastly complicated tax system."
