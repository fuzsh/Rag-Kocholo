        "text": "Following the resignation on 3 July of Finance Minister Giulio\n\nTremonti, Italy's Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is set to appear\n\nin Brussels on 5 July in yet a new function, that of Finance\n\nMinister. Previously, Berlusconi temporarily took over the office\n\nof Minister of Foreign Affairs after Renato Ruggiero's resignation\n\nin 2002.\n\nThis showing by Berlusconi, however, is set to\n\nbe even more crucial. Berlusconi's bid to avoid a formal reprimand,\n\nwhich would be likely to have a negative effect on the country's\n\ninternational credit rating, will be an uphill battle.\n\nAt the finance ministers' Council in May, Italy\n\nwas given a two month delay to present a credible plan to reduce\n\nits budget deficit. The deficit is set to exceed the 3.0 per cent\n\nlimit of the Stability and Growth Pact, with the European\n\nCommission forecasting 3.2 per cent for Italy this year.\n\nHowever, it is precisely this plan that has led\n\nto Tremonti's resignation. He was to present his EU colleagues with\n\na commitment to introduce spending cuts of up to 5.5 billion euro\n\nto get its budget deficit back below the limit, but the National\n\nAlliance coalition partners [Alleanza Nazionale] were against the\n\ncuts and demanded his resignation as a price for their continued\n\nsupport of Berlusconi's government."
