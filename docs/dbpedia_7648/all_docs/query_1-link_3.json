        "text": "At vitriolic political rallies on the grassy fields of northern Italy, speakers with green handkerchiefs knotted around their necks rant against Rome and the evils of immigration. Senators wearing green ties in the slightly tamer halls of Parliament threaten to bring down the government.\n\nGreen neckwear and incendiary speech are what distinguish the Northern League, the most ideologically extreme party in Italy's center-right governing coalition and an albatross around the neck of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.\n\n''It weighs a lot on him,'' said Roberto D'Alimonte, a professor of political science at the University of Florence. ''And it's a delicate moment for the coalition.''\n\nUmberto Bossi, the firebrand leader of the party who calls immigrants ''bingo bongos'' and regularly threatens to quit the government, has not made matters easy for the prime minister.\n\nBut political analysts say Mr. Berlusconi tolerates the Northern League, which brought down his first government nearly a decade ago, because he needs its small northern power base to win elections. Mr. Berlusconi has said he wants to be prime minister for another decade.\n\nThe Northern League's apparent hold on Mr. Berlusconi has prompted accusations within the coalition that it wields disproportionate political weight. In a country where divided coalitions rarely stand, such yawning fault lines require constant mending.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
