        "text": "Page 78 →Page 79 →Chapter 4 Coordination in Italy\n\nDuring one day of fieldwork in Palermo, the capital of Sicily in southern Italy, I stumbled upon a mural painted on the walls of a forgotten alley. The mural powerfully portrayed people struggling in the sea, hands reaching for help, others with their faces just submerged, succumbing to the water. Some of the people appeared ghost-like, simultaneously floating in the sea and floating toward heaven. One man had an eerie smile plastered across his face; he was suspended upside down, transforming his smile into a grimace. The anonymous mural depicts the journey and deaths of the migrants and refugees who have crossed the Mediterranean Sea toward Italy.\n\nFor decades, people have crowded into flimsy boats hoping to cross from the northern coast of Africa to Italy. More than 600,000 people attempted to cross the Mediterranean to Italy from 2014 to 2017, of whom an estimated 13,784 people died.1 This is a despicable—preventable—human tragedy, but it is not the first time thousands of people have attempted this dangerous route to Italian shores. Thousands of migrants came by boat in 1991, and again in 2011, fleeing political unrest and economic instability. Each time, the Italian government was forced, begrudgingly, to build their migration state capacity. This chapter shows how previous experiences with migration crises have influenced the Italian response to the recent crisis in 2014–17.\n\nBefore becoming an immigration country, Italy was known for its emigrants who traveled en masse around the world, creating a large diaspora and spreading Italian cuisine globally. In this chapter, I first trace the evolution of migration state capacity in Italy under each political regime—the Italian monarchy, Fascism, postwar consensus, and the Second Republic. I show how migration state capacity is not a one-way street: capacity can both increase and decrease, in addition to expanding in different types of capacity (i.e., for emigration/immigration or inclusive/repressive). Second, Page 80 →I analyze how different Italian governing coalitions approach the EU—and how different coalitions are viewed as credible or not credible partners with EU institutions. In the last section, I turn to the migration crisis from 2014 to 2017 and how Italy and the EU responded. I show how the necessary conditions of high state capacity and credible partners led the EU to coordinate their response with Italian officials and funnel 99.4 percent of emergency funding through national agencies.\n\nHistory of Migration State Capacity in Italy\n\nThe institutions we see today in Italy have a long and somewhat winding history. Migration state capacity is not something that was discovered in the twenty-first century and, in fact, has both increased and decreased as different political coalitions responded to increased migration pressures. The most important trends in Italian migration state capacity are (1) the shift from emigration to immigration, (2) the link between migration state capacity and political regimes (i.e., Italian monarchy, Fascism, postwar consensus, and the Second Republic), and (3) the general agreement between the center-left and center-right coalitions that increased migration pressure requires a mixture of more capacity, restrictive policies, and amnesty.\n\nAn important note about Italian state capacity more generally: Italy, along with other southern European countries, is traditionally classified as low state capacity. This is anchored in studies focused on the instability of governments, the fractured executive, tax evasion, corruption, and deep divisions between central and regional governments.2 While it is certainly true that throughout much of Italy’s history the state capacity was hampered by all of these barriers, the political reforms in 1993 and the increased Europeanization of Italian politics have increased state capacity generally. While overall state capacity in Italy still remains low compared to northern Europe, this chapter traces changes and relative increases in Italy’s migration state capacity over the last 150 years.\n\nEarly Italy\n\nFor most of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Italy was considered an emigration state—not a destination for immigration—with estimates of more than 26 million Italians leaving their country. Italian emigration occurred in three waves: first, around seven million Italians emigrated from Page 81 →1861 to 1900, primarily to northern European countries, and second, nine million emigrated from 1900 to 1915, primarily to North and South America and many eventually returned to Italy.3 A third wave of Italians emigrated after the Second World War, amounting to 5.6 million people from 1946 to 1965 with around half returning.4 This pattern of mass emigration created large Italian communities in the United States, Argentina, Brazil, and elsewhere.\n\nBecause of its orientation toward emigration, Italy’s migration state capacity during this period focused on controlling emigration through the Commissioner-General of Emigration (established in 1901 as part of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs), followed by the Directorate of Emigration, and later as the Ministry for Italians Abroad and Immigration.5 The Commissioner-General had sweeping powers to set the cost of tickets, create and manage hostels for travelers, inspect ports, and issue permits for Italian workers destined for other European countries.6 The government even set up an Emigration Fund to provide social assistance to emigrants financed by fees from recruiter and carrier licenses, taxes on tickets and passports, and fines for violating migration laws.7 Remarkably, in 1902, the Commissioner-General took the extraordinary measure of suspending emigration to Brazil because of the poor conditions for Italian workers on Brazilian coffee plantations.8 Many of the government’s emigration policies aimed to protect Italian emigrants: for example, a 1901 law required passports for potential emigrants before purchasing their travel tickets to prevent their denial of entry at American ports.9 The law envisioned an efficient bureaucracy that would produce and deliver passports within 24 hours of their request.10\n\nItaly was also concerned about controlling emigration during the First World War. On 6 August 1914, the Italian government blocked emigration for any military-aged men by annulling their passports,11 and further restricted emigration to those with work contracts. Later in 1916, the government temporarily stopped issuing passports, required visas for foreigners entering Italy, and reinstituted internal passports.12 Italy increased its migration state capacity to restrict migration in similar ways as other European countries during the First World War.\n\nFascist Italy\n\nAfter the Fascists came to power in 1922, Mussolini was initially pro-emigration, seeing remittances as an economic resource.13 One early innovation by the Fascists in migration state capacity was the National Credit Page 82 →Institute for Italian Labor Abroad, established in 1923, which provided loans to companies to employ Italians abroad.14 Some critics argued the loans subsidized the economic development of other countries, but the government believed the program was a safety valve for an overpopulated Italy. While organizationally and institutionally innovative, the early migration state capacity of Fascist Italy was not yet totalitarian. For example, the human capital of the Commissioner-General’s office in 1924 was only 38 employees, composed of “one central inspector, four regional inspectors and thirty-three provincial delegates,” tasked with surveillance and preventing clandestine emigration.15 In the following years, the financial capital of the Commissioner-General more than doubled from 6.9 million lire in 1919 to 16 million lire in 1926.16\n\nThe Fascists’ obsession with “the nation” led to deeper questions of migration and demography and, within a few years, the government shifted from encouraging to repressing emigration. The government began asserting that emigration undermined “the nation” by hurting the economy, labor force, and military. For example, Alfredo Rocco, a member of the Chamber of Deputies, said that “to lose millions of Italians means to lose billions of lire.”17\n\nThe Fascists ratcheted up control in 1926 by declaring all Italian passports invalid, followed by new restrictive rules that only issued passports to Italians already in possession of work contracts abroad or summons from close family. In 1927, the Commissioner-General was replaced by the General Directorship of Italians Abroad and the Emigration Fund was consolidated into the national budget. Rather than encourage emigration, the General Directorship of Italians Abroad prioritized fostering relationships with Italians already abroad by subsidizing frequent return trips and eliminating the repatriation tax.18 By 1932, 30 million lire was spent annually on Italian schools abroad, in addition to 12 million lire for the “defense of Italian-ness abroad.”19 Later, the Fascist regime developed more totalitarian forms of migration state capacity: for example, the Commission for Migration and Internal Colonization coordinated a policy of forced ruralization that relocated workers to the Italian countryside and transferred some workers to Italian colonies.20\n\nPostwar Italy\n\nAfter the fall of the Fascist regime, the new Italian Republic established the Directorate of Emigration, sharing responsibilities between the Ministry of Page 83 →Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Labor, which was replaced by the High Commission for Work Abroad and the Superior Council of Emigration.21 In the aftermath of the Second World War, Italy relied heavily on the Intergovernmental Committee for European Migration (a precursor for the International Organization for Migration) to move 307,251 Italians to Argentina, Brazil, Australia, Venezuela, Canada, the United States, and elsewhere from 1952 to 1961.22 This was an early form of subcontracting to international organizations.\n\nIn the two decades following the Second World War, more than half a million Italian colonists repatriated to Italy along with a smaller number of Eritreans and Ethiopians who had been domestic workers or were otherwise employed by the colonial administration.23 Emigration continued in the postwar period, with many Italians seeking work in the rest of Europe. Italians were recruited for German guest worker programs (and to smaller programs in the Netherlands and Belgium), peaking in 1961 with 114,000 Italian guest workers in Germany.24\n\nFor nearly 40 years, Italy had no official procedure to apply for asylum, but in practice there were two types of asylum: constitutional asylum granted through the executive and a de-facto asylum through Italy’s commitments in the Refugee Convention facilitated through UNHCR’s office in Rome.25 In some ways, Italy was in the vanguard by including the right of asylum directly in the 1947 Italian Constitution (Article 10) and signing the Refugee Convention in 1954—but the government did not establish a legal or administrative process for determining refugee status until 1990. During this period, refugees in Italy were granted status on a case-by-case basis through the executive or Italian embassies abroad.26 In the second type of asylum, UNHCR provided de-facto protection before arranging for resettlement of refugees. UNHCR established an office in Rome in 1952 and created a joint committee of two Italian officials and two UNHCR officials who reviewed asylum applications, mostly from people fleeing Eastern Europe.27 The Ministry of Interior, with the assistance of the Red Cross and Caritas, ran two camps in Latina and Capua to accommodate refugees before they were resettled to the United States, Canada, or Australia. Later, in 1979, the Italian navy picked up 900 Vietnamese boat people, who were housed in the same camps before being resettled.28 In another incident in the 1970s, hundreds of Chileans fled to the Italian embassy in Santiago when General Augusto Pinochet overthrew the Chilean government; those dissidents were allowed to resettle to Italy along with their families.29 DuringPage 84 → the postwar period, the asylum process in Italy was ad hoc, which amounted to weak migration state capacity.\n\nItalian courts and the constitution proved contradictory when it came to the right of asylum. Italy never removed the 1951 Refugee Convention’s original geographic restriction that only applied to European refugees. Instead, the Milan Court of Appeals decided in 1964 that non-European asylum applicants had the right to protection by UNHCR as de-facto refugees and were issued temporary residency permits before they were resettled.30 In addition, because of an arcane legal dispute, asylum cases were decided by both administrative and ordinary courts.31\n\nLate Twentieth-Century Italy\n\nItaly’s current migration state capacity was shaped by an early legal pattern in which successive governments pushed through reforms that bundled new measures of control with large amnesty programs. Scholars mark 1974 as the first year of positive net immigration (i.e., more immigrants than emigrants), which they attribute to the oil crisis and the restrictions on labor migration in other, more preferred European countries.32 Immigration remained largely unregulated until 1986 when the Foschi Law, which defined the rights of migrants in Italy, prioritized employment of Italian and EU workers, granted equal access for migrants to social welfare, and addressed irregular migration, exploitation, and the hiring of undocumented migrants.33 Responsibilities for social assistance to migrants were assigned to the Ministries of Labour and Foreign Affairs, in addition to a decentralization of welfare programs to regional and city councils. Migration state capacity continued to lack organizational coherence and funding to execute the tasks. The Foschi Law also included Italy’s first amnesty program, which regularized nearly 118,000 irregular migrants. The Foschi Law was the first in a series of Italian migration laws (see appendix 2) that coupled restrictive measures with generous amnesty programs. Since 1986, there have been seven amnesty programs in Italy (1986, 1990, 1995, 1998, 2002, 2009, 2012), which regularized nearly 1.7 million people.34\n\nThe most significant contribution to Italian migration state capacity was the 1990 Martelli Law that finally defined refugee status and established the National Commission for the Right of Asylum.35 The law defined the asylum process as follows: asylum seekers presented their claims to the border police or the local police station [questura] and the questura issued temporaryPage 85 → residency permits. The application was passed to the national commission, which was composed of four officials (one from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, two from the Ministry for the Interior, and the police commissioner [prefetto]). Additionally, a UNHCR official participated in an advisory role. A hearing and interview could be held by the commission before deciding on each case. If the commission decided in favor of refugee status, individuals were granted residency permits by the questura. If the commission refused refugee status, individuals were issued expulsion orders. The police were responsible for enforcing court-ordered deportations but had little coordination or manpower to follow through.36 Applicants could appeal the decision to an administrative tribunal.37 Thirty billion lire a year was allocated for temporary accommodation to be supported by 200 new social workers and implemented by regional and local councils.38 In addition, the law established the process for setting national quotas for labor migrants each year.39\n\nThe Martelli Law also created the procedure for refusal of entry at the Page 86 →border and empowered the border police and the military to conduct surveillance for human trafficking. This was significant, in part, because throughout 1991 tens of thousands of Albanians arrived in Italy after the collapse of the Albanian regime. Figure 4.1 shows thousands of Albanians who commandeered the Vlora, a cargo boat, and forced the captain to sail to Bari, Italy.40 At first, the Albanians were not allowed to disembark because the Italian policy was to prevent boats from docking or to repatriate Albanians soon thereafter. Eventually, the passengers on the Vlora were moved to an abandoned stadium where the conditions were squalid and violent.41 In response, the Italian army and navy organized the deportation of all of the Albanians in just 10 days. One commenter reported that only the “army is in a position to organize within such a short period of time such a complex and varied operation.”42 While Italy’s migration state capacity was not prepared for such a large influx of migrants, other Italian institutions were deployed in order to respond. Italian authorities took the opportunity to prove to the EU that they were capable of stopping uncontrolled migration on Italian borders.43\n\nTwenty-First-Century Italy\n\nThe subsequent reforms in 1995, 1998, 2002, and 2008 expanded Italy’s migration state capacity in two ways. First, the national commission expanded its capacity by decentralizing asylum decisions to seven territorial commissions.44 The national commission defined policies and gathered statistics, while the territorial commissions provided most of the administrative capacity and issued decisions. Territorial commissions are composed of representatives from the prefecture, police, local municipality, and UNHCR. After 2005, UNHCR had full voting rights on each commission. The territorial commissions are located within prefectures and are part of the Department for Civil Liberties and Immigration in the Ministry of Interior.\n\nThe second way Italy expanded their migration state capacity was by expanding the system of detention and accommodation centers. UNHCR recommends a system of first and second reception: first reception centers are near ports of entry and provide first aid, identification, and the preliminary assessment if there are asylum claims, while secondary centers are dispersed around the country and provide more flexible, integrated living scenarios. Italy’s detention centers have evolved significantly since 2004 with Page 87 →some centers being both renamed and reclassified. The reception capacity increased most starkly within extraordinary and temporary centers. This reflects a shift toward more repressive and restrictive logics of containment and confinement of refugees.45\n\nFrom 2004 to 2008, asylum seekers were commonly detained while their cases were assessed in a system of seven identification centers (Centri di Identificazione) and 15 temporary accommodation centers (Centri di Permanenza Temporanea e di Assistenza, CPTA). CPTA were under the authority of the Ministry of the Interior but management was subcontracted to the Italian Red Cross, religious charities, or cooperatives. The maximum detention for migrants was 20 days in identification centers and 60 days in CPTA. Those granted asylum were released, while those who were refused asylum and were not deported by the end of the maximum period were released with an injunction to leave and banned from returning to Italy for five years.46\n\nIn 2008, asylum applications more than doubled to 31,723—up from 13,310 the previous year. The Ministry of the Interior responded by reorganizing the system into four types of reception centers.47 First, migrants were received near major ports at First Aid and Reception Centers (Centri di primo soccorso ed assistenza, CPSA). CPSA are temporary accommodation with medical and humanitarian aid before people were transferred within a few days to other centers. If individuals expressed their desire to apply for asylum, they should be transferred to Reception Centers for Asylum Seekers (Centri di Accoglienza per Richiedenti Asilo, CARA) where they wait for identification and asylum interviews with the local territorial commission. CARA are open centers during the day but closed at night. If an individual is identified as vulnerable or is granted asylum, they can move to accommodation in SPRAR (Protection System for Asylum Seekers/Sistema di Protezione per Richiedenti Asilo e Rifugiati).48 SPRAR centers are typically run by NGOs or local authorities, and individuals can stay up to six months or extend to one year if they are considered vulnerable. The SPRAR system only had 3,000 places in 2008, the same year 31,000 people applied for asylum. Because of the limited capacity in SPRAR, many asylum seekers stayed in CARA beyond the 35-day maximum or became homeless.49 If individuals do not wish to claim asylum, they are transferred from CPSA to reception centers (Centri di Accoglienza, CDA) while their paperwork is processed. CDA provide first aid and support but are closed facilities. If an asylum seeker in CARA or a migrant in CDA were given expulsionPage 88 → orders, they were transferred to an identification and expulsion center (Centri di identificazione ed espulsione) where they were detained until they were deported.\n\nAnother characteristic of migration state capacity during this period was experimentation with collaboration with IOs. UNHCR became more involved in Italy after several instances of collective forced returns—banned by the 1951 convention—from Lampedusa to Libya in 2004 and 2005. The cases involved more than 1,850 people identified by Italian authorities as Egyptians who were quickly returned to Libya without opportunity to apply for asylum.50 After the 2004–5 incidents, the Italian Ministry of Interior invited UNHCR, IOM, and the Italian Red Cross to participate in the Praesidium project as a partnership to ensure the human rights of migrants during disembarkment, assessments, and detention.51 UNHCR provided information about claiming asylum, identified and referred vulnerable people, and monitored detention centers; IOM provided information on Italian immigration law; while the Red Cross provided health and psychological support for vulnerable people. This model of partnership with IOs for the Page 89 →provision of information and monitoring was also paired with the rapid onward transfer to local authorities to complete the asylum process (known as the Lampedusa model). Once individuals arrived in Italy, they were quickly assessed, fingerprinted, and transferred onward to accommodation centers around Italy. The Italian government contended that this was to prevent congestion in Lampedusa and port cities, but civil society groups suggested that this policy encouraged people to abscond and travel onward to other EU countries as irregular migrants.\n\nTable 4.1.

Italy has had a long and tumultuous history with its former colony regarding migration controls, including Libya’s leader Muammar Gaddafi demanding compensation because Libya could “no longer act as Europe’s coast guard,” and threatening to swamp Italy with migrants.52 However, cooperation on migration between Italy and Libya began gradually to be formalized through a joint communication (1998) and memorandum of intent (2000). The Italian government eventually signed the 2008 Treaty of Friendship, which agreed to pay Libya $5 billion in infrastructural investments in exchange for cooperation on migration, like reinforcing Libya’s land border, building migrant detention centers in Libya, criminalizing trafficking, and joint patrols along Libya’s coast.53 Silvio Berlusconi bluntly revealed the main purpose of the friendship treaty: “more oil and less migrants.”54 Nevertheless, the agreement formalized the transfer of restrictive migration policies to Libya—what scholars describe as “externalization” of migration policies to a third country in order to stop or deter migrants from ever arriving in Europe.55 Note: I do not classify the Treaty of Friendship as subcontracting because subcontracting describes the transfer of responsibility to an IO to implement within an EU member state, while the treaty with Libya externalizes responsibility and implementation outside the EU.\n\nNorth African Emergency (2011–2013)\n\n59\n\nThroughout 2011–12, the Italian government used the language of “emergency” and “crisis” in order to secure EU support.60 The EU allocated an additional €25 million in emergency funds from the External Border Fund and the Refugee Fund, which paid for humanitarian support, such as food, medical aid, and accommodation at the local level.61 This funding was funneled through national and local institutions—not international organizations or EU agencies. The main operational responsibility that Italy delegated to IOs was to IOM for a voluntary repatriation program, which offered a plane ticket and €200 cash for migrants willing to return home. This program was limited to 600 returnees and amounted to a budget of €900,000.\n\nDuring this period, EU institutions started to intervene in Italian migration policy in three ways. First, on 23 February 2012, the European Court of Human Rights ruled in the case Hirsi Jamaa and Others vs. Italy that people intercepted at sea cannot be pushed back to Libya and must have the opportunity to claim asylum.62 The case found that Italy was violating the principle of nonrefoulement and the prohibition on collective expulsion. This case forced Italy to renegotiate the bilateral agreement with Libya. Second, Nils Muižnieks, the commissioner for human rights of the Council of Page 91 →Europe, visited Italy in July 2012, publishing his report that found a fragmented system of reception centers with variable and subpar conditions, the extended use of administrative detention, and continued use of readmission agreements with Egypt and Tunisia that may violate nonrefoulement.63 Third, on 24 October 2012 the EU started infringement proceedings against Italy for violating the directives on asylum procedures, reception, qualification, and Dublin II.64 The violation identified the lack of accommodation, bad conditions in reception centers, and barriers to accessing the asylum process.\n\nThe Italian government declared that the North Africa emergency would end in March 2013.65 Most migrants were granted temporary residence permits, the temporary camps and tent cities were closed, and migrants was given €500 to encourage repatriation or to help with integration.66 No data was recorded about whether migrants returned home, but many were expected to have traveled to other EU states and to overstay their permits.\n\nThe impact of the North Africa emergency on Italian migration policy was to set a pattern of response and to adjust the Italian public’s expectations for the “new normal.” The new pattern of response was that Italy relied heavily on temporary camps and rapid transfer to all regions in Italy, accompanied by temporary residency permits. Italian authorities gradually accepted that many irregular migrants would abscond from accommodation and application processes and go underground. This response informed how Italian authorities would respond during the 2014–17 migration crisis. The second impact was to adjust expectations for how the Italian government could respond to irregular migration in the future. While the state of emergency ended, the very high number (more than 40,000) of sea arrivals each year was accepted as the “new normal.”\n\nOn the eve of the 2014–17 surge, Italy’s migration state capacity had grown substantially in financial and human resources, in addition to structurally through new commissions, police and military operations, and laws. Table 4.2 provides illustrative examples of the four components of migration state capacity in Italy. Many scholars characterize the overall capacity of the Italian state as a weak state—which it is relative to northern European states. In this section, I traced the evolution of Italy’s migration state capacity. Despite the overcrowding and poor conditions in detention centers during this period, the Italian government significantly increased its capacity to house asylum seekers and process their applications.\n\nPage 92 →Italy and the EU: A Credible Partner?\n\nBesides analyzing the evolving migration state capacity in Italy, we must understand Italy’s relationship to the EU and its place as a credible partner. How do different Italian governing coalitions change Italy’s relationship with the EU? How does the party composition of coalitions impact their credibility as partners for coordination or collaboration with EU institutions? This section describes Italy’s orientation to the EU, analyzes Italy’s center-left and center-right coalitions’ approach to the EU, and presents several recent trends in Italy.\n\nItaly was a founding member of the European Economic Community and was active in building and participating in all subsequent levels of European integration. From 1946 to 2020, Italy had 67 different governments because of party fragmentation and unstable coalitions. Despite the frequent turnover of Italian governments, the pro-Europe Christian Democratic Party dominated coalitions and controlled the governments for over 50 years. In some ways, there was no other choice but Europe for Italy in the postwar period because the European project stood in direct opposition to Italy’s fascist nationalist past.67 Since 1952, public opinion in Italy has strongly supported European integration, averaging above 70 percent.68 In addition, former Italian prime minister Romano Prodi became the president of the European Commission (1999–2004) and led in the drafting and Page 93 →ratification process of the ill-fated Constitutional Treaty. Despite many Italians’ enthusiasm for Europe, Italian governments have a history of inconsistent implementation of EU directives.69\n\nTable 4.2. Examples of Types of Migration State Capacity in Italy\n\nBorder Security\n\nAsylum\n\nItalian political parties and coalitions have shifted their position toward the EU over the last 50 years. During the postwar period, parties of the center-right across Europe spearheaded the goal of a common market and the supranational institutions to support it, while communist, socialist, and other parties of the left often opposed European integration because of their support for state regulations, unions, and labor market protections. In the 1990s, political parties swapped positions on the EU: center-left parties become more pro-EU because of the EU’s support for democratic institutions and human rights, while center-right parties became more Euroskeptic because they opposed interference from supranational institutions.70\n\nCenter-Left Coalitions\n\nIn some aspects, center-left coalitions in Italy were credible partners for EU institutions because of their pro-EU stances and strong commitment to reform based around the convergence criteria for the Economic and Monetary Union. Despite these tendencies, EU began infringement procedures against Italy because of its failure to implement EU directives.\n\nCenter-left coalitions proved themselves credible partners that could implement the reforms necessary to join both the euro and the Schengen area. First, the Olive Tree coalition (1996–2001, 2006–8), passed legislation in order for Italy to meet the Economic and Monetary Union convergence criteria and to adopt the euro.71 For example, Prime Minister Prodi used pressure from Europe to cut budgets, pass anti-inflation measures, and reform the public administration, in addition to a one-off “Eurotax” to reduce the deficit.72\n\nSecond, Italy’s desire to join the Schengen area drove many other reforms in the 1990s. The Olive Tree coalition passed the 1998 legislation (see appendix 2) to implement Italy’s commitments regarding the Schengen area, including strict border checks, deportation powers, and residency permits.73 In addition, the coalition rushed to establish its own domestic asylum system because the Dublin regulations, which came into effect in 1997, would potentially return large numbers of asylum seekers from other EU countries to Italy because Italy was the first country they entered in Europe.\n\nPage 94 →The last section of this chapter shows how center-left coalitions led the expansion of Italy’s migration state capacity in response to the large movements of people in 2014–17. One important thing to note is that while the center-left was more pro-EU than the center-right, both sides of the political spectrum passed legislation that increased migration state capacity, including repressive elements like deportation and detention.\n\nCenter-Right Coalitions\n\nWhile the rhetoric of Italian parties in center-right coalitions has become more Euroskeptic, the policies implemented by their coalitions have closely followed EU migration policies. It is useful to disentangle the largest parties on the center-right: Forza Italia, Lega Nord, and Alleanza Nazionale. The Forza Italia, led by former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, was initially pro-euro but in 1994 had turned against the euro. Giulio Tremonti, Forza Italia finance minister, attempted to link “Prodi’s Euro” to the slowing Italian economy and increased inflation.74 Despite campaigning on restricting immigration, in 2002 Berlusconi’s second coalition government oversaw the largest regularization program, for more than 650,000 people.75 The Lega Nord (rebranded as Lega since 2018) is an explicitly anti-Rome and anti-EU party that favors decentralization and resists control from supranational institutions. Many studies note that the Lega Nord’s presence in and out of coalitions has influenced most Italian parties to become more anti-immigrant.76 After the 2018 elections, the Lega articulated extreme anti-EU sentiment by threatening to veto the EU’s seven-year budget, and even threatening to leave the euro.77 The Alleanza Nazionale, formed in 1995 from the membership of the neofascist Italian Social Movement, has evolved on the EU and immigration as it attempted to distance itself from Fascism and reposition itself in the center of the political spectrum. The Alleanza Nazionale is essentially pro-European integration, but framed through the lens of Italian national interest,78 and the party seeks greater control of immigration. Despite their traditionally conservative positions on immigration, Alleanza Nazionale leader Gianfranco Fini proposed in 2003 to extend the right to vote in local elections to immigrants and passed a law giving amnesty to 630,000 migrants.79\n\nOverall, when faced with pressure from Europe, the center-right Berlusconi governments sought to remove pressure from the EU rather than implement EU policies as intended.80 For example, the Stability and Growth Page 95 →Pact laid out legally binding limits on the budget deficits of all member states. Berlusconi’s approach was to ignore the EU and temporarily exceed the limit and to lobby for the suspension and reform of the pact’s requirements.81 While not explicitly anti-EU, Berlusconi resisted European control and preferred intergovernmental diplomacy between different ministers of member states rather than through the European Commission.\n\nFive Star Movement (Movimento Five Stelle, M5S)\n\nBeppe Grillo—a comedian, blogger, and political activist—grew a social movement using local meetups, an active online presence, and a series of V-Day demonstrations (short for vaffanculo day or “fuck-off” day in Italian) in 2007. Grillo founded the M5S in 2009 and gained seats in the 2010 and 2012 local and regional elections. By 2013, the M5S became the largest party in the Chamber of Deputies with 25 percent of the votes—nevertheless, the center-left coalition formed the government. In the 2018 elections, M5S won the largest number of votes and went into a governing coalition with the Lega. In less than 10 years, M5S has upended Italian politics and become one of the largest and most influential parties.\n\nThe M5S is a populist, antiestablishment party that supports reform, anticorruption, and direct democracy.82 From the early days, Grillo organized a “Clean Parliament” campaign against corruption and railed against the mainstream media. The party’s economic proposals are generally left-of-center by opposing austerity, advocating for less taxes, a flexible retirement age, and the nationalization of telecoms.83 The M5S’s antiestablishment views also orients its attitude toward the EU: in 2014, M5S (unsuccessfully) organized a petition to remove Italy from the euro and is more generally Euroskeptic. M5S’s stance on immigration has been inconsistent: before 2018 the party manifestos were largely silent on the issue, but in 2018 it took a harder line. M5S called for “Zero landings of immigrants. Italy is not the refugee camp of Europe” coupled with more humanitarian policies, like “safe and legal channels” to Europe, revising the Dublin system, and strengthening the territorial commissions.84 It is unclear whether EU institutions perceive M5S as a credible partner on migration issues. Despite their more humanitarian proposals, the M5S went into government with the Lega after the 2018 elections, thus enabling some of the most radical anti-immigrant policies in Europe (see this chapter’s postscript).\n\nPage 96 →Pattern of Relying on the EU\n\nItaly is more susceptible to mass influxes of migrants than other EU member states because of its long shoreline and proximity to northern Africa. Despite its mixed track record of implementing EU policies into national law, Italy’s geopolitical position in Europe has made it advantageous to rely more heavily on EU-wide migration policies aimed at burden sharing. The two most important examples are Italy’s attempt to activate the Temporary Protection Directive (TPD) and its jockeying for an EU-led search and rescue operation.\n\nAfter the 2011 North African emergency, Italy and Malta responded with an exchange of letters with the EC pushing for the activation of the TPD.85 The TPD would grant temporary protection for migrants arriving in Italy in all member states and trigger solidarity mechanisms (like EU funding and shared reception facilities), but the TPD was never activated because it requires a qualified majority in the Council. The Italian government turned to the EU for help during the 2011 crisis but was rejected. This is an example of Italian officials showing their commitment to EU-wide coordination policies but being met by objections from other member states—those not facing the same crises—that were not committed to solidary. Instead, Italy granted temporary humanitarian resident permits to migrants who arrived between January 2011 and 5 April 2011, allowing them to travel onward to other EU countries. These temporary permits helped to decongest some of the camps and forced other member states to share the burden. France objected to the temporary permits by instituting random border checks on the French-Italian border.86\n\nAnother example of Italian preference for EU-wide solidary mechanisms was in the political jockeying around search and rescue in the Mediterranean Sea. After several shipwrecks in October 2013 with death tolls over 400 people, Italy’s navy launched Operation Mare Nostrum aimed at saving lives and stopping smugglers. Mare Nostrum was successful at saving more than 170,000 lives but Italian officials felt abandoned by their European allies, which funded less than 2 percent of the €114 million operation. Angelino Alfano, the Italian minister of interior, threatened on Twitter: “The European Union has two options: either it comes to the Mediterranean to put the EU flag on Mare Nostrum or we will let migrants with right of asylum leave for other countries.”87 By October 2014, Italy ended Mare Nostrum in an effort to force the EU to share the burden in the Mediterranean.Page 97 → Throughout the entire diplomatic skirmish, it was clear that Italy was committed to more European solidarity, not less, and was a credible partner to coordinate operations with other European institutions.\n\n2014–2017: Italian-Led Coordination\n\nThe crisis began when sea arrivals spiked from 42,925 in 2013 to 170,100 in 2014 and remained above 100,000 until 2017 (see fig. 4.2). This dramatic increase came a year before arrivals in Greece spiked to 872,500 in 2015. While Italy’s migration crisis was not of the same magnitude as that of Greece, the 2014–17 influx was five times larger than the North African emergency. Because of the necessary conditions—high state capacity and a Page 98 →credible EU partner—the EU responded through the Italian-led coordination of the response, funneling aid through Italian institutions and expanding the previous Italian systems of reception and asylum.\n\nThe Italian government responded on three fronts: first, by launching a wider search and rescue operation; second, by building emergency reception centers; and, third, by expanding administrative capacity to process asylum claims. While the Italian navy expanded their search and rescue operation, Mare Nostrum (“Our Sea” in Latin), the EU only contributed €1.8 million to the operation. After only one year, the Italians ended Mare Nostrum in an attempt to force the EU to share the financial and operational burden. In November 2014, Frontex launched Operation Triton, a €35 million joint operation, but it was criticized for its meager budget and limited mandate that focused on border management, instead of saving lives.88\n\nAs sea arrivals grew exponentially, so did the need for accommodation. Mare Nostrum developed a reception plan that empowered local prefectures to create and manage additional extraordinary reception centers (Centri di Accoglienza Straordinaria).89 In December 2014, 35,562 people were housed in extraordinary reception centers, but that number grew to 70,918 people by October 2015.90 In 2014 alone, the Italian reception system cost €633 million, which was funded by the Ministry of Interior.91 Over the next three years, the EU would inject €85.6 million in emergency funding to support the Italian government to implement the reception system.92\n\nThe third response was to increase Italy’s migration state capacity to process asylum claims. In 2014, the Ministry of Interior increased the numberPage 99 → of territorial commissions from 20 to 40, which increased the number of annual asylum decisions by 70 percent.93 Despite the new commissions, there was still a large backlog of asylum appeals because all first instance decisions could be appealed in court. In early 2017, the Italian parliament passed the Minniti Law, which shortened the time limit for applying for asylum and removed the right to a second appeal.94 The law also increased the staff at the commissions from 168 in 2015 to 250 in 2017.95 Finally, the Italian government opened 16 new identification and expulsion centers and 26 new specialized asylum courts to speed up asylum decisions and deportation. This increased capacity was channeled directly through government institutions and not delegated to IOs or EU agencies. The surge in migration state capacity was an investment in national institutions, reasserting Italian sovereignty over migration policy.\n\nTable 4.3.

Frontex launched the Triton joint operation (an example of collaboration) and by April 2015 the EU had tripled the operation’s budget. This made Triton roughly the same size as Italy’s previous Mare Nostrum, but it only patrolled within 30 miles of the Italian coast, making it less effective at saving lives.96 The second EU response was the intra-EU relocation scheme to move refugees from frontline countries to other EU states. Despite Italy’s eager participation, the scheme only relocated 33 percent (11,444) of the 34,953 people the EU promised to relocate from Italy by the end of 2017. The low number of relocations were attributed to additional security checks and barriers put in place by other EU states.97\n\nThe third EU response to the crisis in Italy (as in Greece) was the hotspot approach. The EU hotspots were modeled after Italy’s identification and expulsion centers located near ports, which temporarily detain migrants to identify, fingerprint, and assess their need for protection. EU agencies (Frontex, EASO, Europol, and Eurojust) work jointly together in hotspots to expand Italy’s capacity to process the recent influx of migrants. In contrast to Greece, Italian authorities participated in the EU Regional Task Force, which coordinated the overall hotspot strategy. Local authorities (prefetture) officially manage the hotspots on the ground, along with the state police (questura) who run the registration areas and NGOs who are often responsible for accommodation and other support.98 Italian hotspots are mostly staffed by Italian police and military, whereas Greece Page 100 →relies heavily on personnel from EU agencies. For example, in October 2016, four hotspots were open in Italy with 90 Frontex officers and 15 EASO experts and cultural mediators; by December 2017, the EU staff had decreased to 12 Frontex officers and 19 EASO staff. Greek hotspots were staffed by 442 Frontex officers and 116 EASO staff in October 2016, increasing to 448 Frontex and 232 EASO staff by the end of 2017.99 Italy adopted the standard operating procedures (SOP) for all hotspots in May 2016 but, by September 2017, Greece still had not adopted a SOP; instead, the EC published a template for Greece to adapt.100 These different approaches to SOPs reveal how Italy was perceived as a credible partner with whom the EU could coordinate and collaborate to implement EU migration policy, while Greece was not.\n\nThe final way EU institutions responded to the crisis in Italy was to funnel €150 million in emergency funding to Italy—99.4 percent of which went directly to national institutions (primarily the Ministry of Interior) and only 0.6 percent went to IOs (fig. 4.3). It is important to note that ECHO Page 101 →did not disperse any funding from the Emergency Support Instrument (ESI) to Italy—all €401 million from the ESI went to IOs and NGOs in Greece. Strikingly, the EU’s response to the crises in Greece and Italy differed primarily in how and to whom they funneled the emergency funding. In Italy, the EU channeled its support through the national institutions, while in Greece the support was delegated to IOs. Chapter 5 discusses in detail how the Greek state had low capacity and no credibility, but the level of crisis was so dire in Greece that the EU created the Emergency Support Instrument as an additional funding instrument to circumvent Greek authorities, to speed up disbursement of funding, and to empower IOs on the ground.\n\nIn Italy, the government asserted its role as primary responder, drawing on previous experience and systems set up during the North African emergency. The Italian government quickly scaled up its capacity for reception and to process asylum claims during the 2014–17 crisis. Interviewees linked the reason for coordination instead of subcontracting to the Italian state capacity. One representative from UNHCR in Italy explained:\n\nItaly is a country that has capacity to respond—there are gaps but we believe that the best way to address gaps is to monitor, to advocate, to be present. . . . In Greece, we are deeply involved. We are doing things. But, again, Italy has a totally different capacity. It has a long history of having every year this movement of people and they have the capacity to cope with the regular flow of around 150,000 people a year.101\n\nAnother important factor for state capacity in Italy was the increased role of regions in processing and accommodation. This differed in Greece where many local communities resisted reception centers in their area, setting up conflicts between national and local authorities and slowing progress. One IOM official explained that “regions and municipalities in Italy play a major role. Regions in [Italy’s] national plan accept the resettlement of people who arrive. They have a lot of leeway in their interventions. They deal with migration on their specific territories. They are very present at the national table.”102 These relationships continued from the previous emergency and allowed Italy to increase its capacity to accommodate and process migrants and refugees.\n\nIn Italy, the EU relied on the government as credible partners because the Ministry of the Interior asserted its leadership in coordination, funding, Page 102 →and policymaking. A high-level official at the Department of Civil Liberties and Immigration said:\n\nThe Italian government is fully invested. . . . Policy-making must be based on data, based on the real reality. We have more than 100 prefectures around Italy, and more than a hundred police headquarters around Italy, so we have the contacts on the ground. We know what are really the problems in the territories.103\n\nAn IOM official explained that in Italy “the response is really coordinated by the government to make sure there isn’t overlap. There is a national coordination [committee] in the Ministry of Interior.”104 This committee, previously established for the North African emergency, coordinated the response at every level, including negotiating SOP for the hotspots and reception centers. In Greece, many interviewees reported that the government was absent or did not contribute to most coordination meetings.\n\nWhile not the main responder in Italy, UNHCR collaborated with the Ministry of Interior to jointly review asylum applications and provide information about the asylum process. UNHCR has a unique role in Italy as representatives sit on the territorial commissions and can vote on every asylum decision. This is an example of collaboration in which different parts of the Italian government (prefecture, police, and local municipality) and the UN jointly review applications and make binding legal decisions. It is not subcontracting because UNHCR does not take responsibility for the asylum application or decision-making process. Instead, UNHCR adds capacity with its expertise in asylum law and countries of origin. This role was not created in response to the recent crises, but dates back to 2005 when UNHCR was brought in to help with the asylum backlog.\n\nUNHCR and IOM continued to participate in the Praesidium project (renamed the ADITUS project in 2017 and jointly funded by the Italian Ministry of Interior and the EU)105 to provide information about the asylum process during disembarkation in ports and monitoring of accommodation and detention centers. In addition, both organizations assist Italian authorities in identifying vulnerable people, like unaccompanied minors, trafficked victims, or those with health issues. UNHCR does not play a significant operational role in Italy; rather, its main activities are information provision and monitoring—both of which are a continuation from before the crisis.\n\nPage 103 →Finally, IOM was delegated responsibility by the EU in both Italy and Greece for the operational logistics of the intra-EU relocation scheme from January 2016 to December 2017, including predeparture counseling, health checks, cultural orientation, booking flights, and accompaniment.106 IOM is often subcontracted by states for the same package of services when resettling refugees from outside of the EU, making IOM an experienced and credible partner. The EU allocated €900,000 to IOM to assist with the relocation scheme—the only instance of EU emergency funding that was subcontracted to an IO in Italy from 2014 to 2017.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis chapter traced the evolution of migration state capacity in Italy over the last 150 years. In early Italy, migration state capacity focused on controlling emigration through the Commissioner-General of Emigration, the Directorate of Emigration, and the Ministry for Italians Abroad and Immigration. The Italian state subsidized emigration, regulated recruiters, provided social assistance to emigrants, and in rare cases banned emigration to risky destinations. Under Fascist control, the Italian state shifted its migration state capacity to repressing emigration, canceling passports, and forcibly relocating Italians to the countryside or colonies. During the postwar period, many Italians continued to emigrate to Europe, the Americas, and Australia. Even though asylum was included in Italy’s postwar constitution, there were no formal asylum processes, leaving most refugees to seek de facto protection through UNHCR’s office in Rome. It wasn’t until 1990 that Italy defined the refugee status and established an asylum process through national and territorial commissions. When Italy faced increased migration pressure and governing coalitions had the political will to act, Italy increased its migration state capacity as necessary. However, it was often the case that in the face of increased pressure (from the 1970s into the 1990s) and lack of political will, the state did nothing.\n\nItalian political parties and governing coalitions vary in their approach to migration policy and to the EU. Center-left coalitions in the 1990s used pressure from the EU to pass national legislation to join the euro and the Schengen area. Center-right coalitions attempted to ignore EU pressure and delay implementing EU policies. Despite those delays, both center-left and center-right coalitions were credible partners for coordination and collaborationPage 104 → with EU institutions. In particular, Italy was in favor of greater EU solidarity on migration policies because EU-wide burden sharing mechanisms especially benefit Italy.\n\nAfter decades of fluctuating migration—particularly the North African emergency—Italy developed a standard way of responding to new influxes: build new reception centers, increase staff at asylum commissions, and make asylum laws more restrictive. In total, these initiatives led Italy to develop a stronger state capacity to respond to the 2014–17 crisis and a track record of being a credible EU partner. When faced with the crisis, EU institutions chose to primarily coordinate the response through the Italian institutions, instead of through collaboration or subcontracting.\n\nPostscript\n\nWhile the necessary conditions—high state capacity and credible partners—led to coordination in Italy in 2014–17, these conditions can and do change. The March 2018 general election upended Italian politics: the Lega won a plurality in parliament, while M5S received the largest number of votes. After a tense three months of negotiations, a governing coalition was formed between M5S and the Lega. This shift—from a coalition that was a clear credible partner for the EU to a coalition of outspoken critics of the EU—shows how quickly the necessary conditions for cooperation or noncooperation can change.\n\nIn the ensuing months, Matteo Salvini (leader of the Lega and minister of interior) demonstrated just how anti-immigrant and anti-EU the new coalition could become. In June 2018, Salvini refused to allow NGO search and rescue boats to disembark asylum seekers, leading to a standoff between Malta and Italy for which country was responsible for several boats of rescued migrants. Eventually, Spain accepted the stranded migrants.107 For the next year, Salvini harassed the NGO boats to stop assisting migrants in the Mediterranean. In June 2019, Carola Rackete, captain of the Sea-Watch-3 rescue boat, was arrested (and later acquitted) for illegally docking her boat in Lampedusa after being refused permission. The coalition also passed a new law that removed humanitarian protection (a category of international protection for those not fleeing war or direct persecution) and suspended asylum applications for individuals convicted of theft, sexual assault, and possession or trafficking of drugs.\n\nPage 105 →The shift in Italian politics shows how both variables—migration state capacity and credible partners—continue to evolve and influence future decisions about how the EU will coordinate, collaborate, or subcontract. In 2018, the number of new asylum applications was down to precrisis levels in Italy, relieving some of the pressure on the EU. But if an influx had occurred, the coalition’s mix of Euroskeptic Italian leadership and high state capacity could have led to unilateral action by Italy instead of coordination or subcontracting to IOs.\n\nIn another surprise move, Salvini introduced a vote of no confidence in August 2019, undermining the coalition between M5S and Lega. Salvini intended to force an early election, but instead M5S turned to the center-left Democratic Party to form a new coalition that was pro-EU and supported a reformed immigration policy. The new government adopted several laws in response to the COVID-19 pandemic regarding migrants, including funding for reception centers, extending residence permits, and a temporary amnesty for irregular migrants working in agriculture or domestic work. However, the same government designated all Italian ports unsafe because of COVID-19, thus blocking the disembarkment of all migrants from non-Italian ships, in addition to forcing new arrivals to be quarantined on ships. The impact of these dramatic shifts in Italian politics have yet to be felt in EU cooperation on migration management."
