(U) SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED -- NOT FOR INTERNET\n\nDISTRIBUTION.\n\n-------\n\nSUMMARY\n\n-------\n\n2. (SBU) A new Berlusconi Cabinet was sworn in by\n\nPresident of the Republic Ciampi on April 23. If confirmed\n\nas expected by both chambers of Parliament, this will be\n\nBerlusconi's third government, counting his seven-month\n\nstint in 1994 and the just-expired term that made him\n\nItaly's longest-serving post-War Prime Minister. The new\n\nCabinet shows few changes. It includes the four major\n\ncoalition partners of Berlusconi II -- the PM's own Forza\n\nItalia (FI), National Alliance (AN), Union of Christian\n\nDemocrats of the Center (UDC) and the Northern League\n\n(Lega). The Cabinet also draws in two micro-parties, the\n\nNew Italian Socialists (New PSI) and the Italian Republicans\n\n(PRI), which were associated with this coalition throughout\n\nmost of the previous government, but in this line-up have\n\none ministry each. If pressure on Berlusconi to resign by\n\nAN and UDC was intended to reduce the Northern League's\n\ninfluence, there are few signs from Cabinet appointments\n\nthat this played out. We do not foresee any dramatic\n\nchanges in the policies of most concern to the USG when\n\nBerlusconi presents his government program to Parliament on\n\nApril 26. Septel will report on what the Government change\n\nmeans for Berlusconi's economic policies. END SUMMARY.\n\n--------------------------\n\nTHE NEW GOVERNMENT LINE-UP\n\n--------------------------\n\n3. (U) The government sworn in on April 23 looks much like\n\nthe one it replaces:\n\nSilvio Berlusconi (FI), Prime Minister\n\nGianfranco Fini (AN), Deputy Prime Minister (and Foreign\n\nMinister)\n\nGiulio Tremonti (FI), Deputy Prime Minister (replaced Marco\n\nFollini, UDC)\n\nMINISTERS WITH PORTFOLIO:\n\nGianfranco Fini (AN), Foreign Affairs\n\nGiuseppe Pisanu (FI), Interior\n\nRoberto Castelli (Lega), Justice\n\nAntonio Martino (FI), Defense\n\nDomenico Siniscalco (Independent), Economics and Finance\n\nClaudio Scajola (FI), Productive Activities (replaced\n\nAntonio Marzano, FI)\n\nLetizia Moratti (Independent), Education, University and\n\nScientific Research\n\nRoberto Maroni (Lega), Labor and Welfare\n\nGiovanni Alemanno (AN), Agricultural Affairs and Forests\n\nAltero Matteoli (AN), Environment\n\nPietro Lunardi (Independent), Infrastructure and Transport\n\nFrancesco Storace (AN), Health (replaced Gerolamo Sirchia,\n\nIndependent)\n\nRocco Buttiglione (UDC), Cultural Assets and Activities\n\n(replaced Giuliano Urbani, FI)\n\nMario Landolfi (AN), Communications (replaced Maurizio\n\nGasparri, AN)\n\nMINISTERS WITHOUT PORTFOLIO:\n\n(Note: Ministers without Portfolio have no independent\n\nbudget and little staff. They are created on an ad hoc\n\nbasis by the sitting Council of Ministers.)\n\nRoberto Calderoli (Lega), Institutional Reform and\n\nDevolution\n\nGiorgio La Malfa (PRI), European Union Policy (replaced\n\nButtiglione, UDC, who was \"promoted\" to the Culture\n\nMinistry)\n\nStefano Caldoro (New PSI), Implementation of Government\n\nPrograms (replaced Claudio Scajola, FI, who was \"promoted\"\n\nto Productive Activities)\n\nMario Baccini (UDC), Public Administration\n\nEnrico La Loggia (FI), Regional Affairs\n\nCarlo Giovanardi (UDC), Relations with Parliament\n\nLucio Stanca (Independent), Innovation and Technology\n\nStefania Prestigiacomo (FI), Equal Opportunities\n\nMirko Tremaglia (AN), Italians Abroad\n\nGianfranco Micciche' (FI), Development and Territorial Unity\n\n(new position)\n\n---------\n\nTHE TALLY\n\n---------\n\n4. (SBU) AN, Berlusconi's largest partner in terms of\n\nvotes (after FI, based on the 2001 national election vote\n\ncount), retained the double hats of deputy prime minister\n\nand foreign minister for party leader Gianfranco Fini. AN\n\nalso secured the Health Ministry for party heavyweight\n\nFrancesco Storace, who lost his re-election bid for Lazio\n\nregional president in the April 3-4 regional elections. UDC\n\n(slightly ahead of Lega in terms of electoral weight within\n\nthe coalition) kept its three previous ministers, with\n\nformer Minister without Portfolio for European Union\n\nPolicies Rocco Buttiglione \"promoted\" to a full Ministry\n\n(Culture). UDC leader Marco Follini withdrew from his\n\ngovernment role of Deputy Prime Minister, as he promised he\n\nwould. Seemingly at odds with AN and UDC demands, the\n\nNorthern League kept all three of its ministries, including\n\nthe all-important (to League voters) Minister for Reform. A\n\ncaustic observer might note that AN/UDC failed to break the\n\ncoalition's \"northern axis.\" New allies, PRI and New PSI,\n\nsecured one ministry each.\n\n5. (SBU) Most promotions or new appointments came at the\n\nexpense of independent ministers or were swaps within a\n\nparty. One new minister without portfolio was created, that\n\nfor Development and Territorial Integrity -- read \"the\n\nSouth.\" Berlusconi, however, succeeded in bringing back two\n\nkey advisers especially important to him in electoral\n\ncampaigns -- Claudio Scajola and Giulio Tremonti.\n\nTremonti's appointment as Deputy Prime Minister alongside\n\nFini counts also as a plus for the League, but as a possible\n\naffront to AN (see below). After assigning Productive\n\nActivities to key FI confidante Claudio Scajola, we expect\n\nBerlusconi to reward his quietly exiting loyal follower\n\nAntonio Marzano with some other appointment, likely within\n\nthe party. The Scajola appointment, too, must have been the\n\nsubject of intense bargaining; most sources suggested AN\n\nwanted this ministry for its own.\n\n----------------\n\nNEW (RE-)ENTRIES\n\n----------------\n\n6. (SBU) Tremonti, one of Berlusconi's most trusted allies\n\nand a senior leader of FI, is an economic and tax expert.\n\nBerlusconi may have had to overcome Fini's objections to\n\nname Tremonti deputy prime minister. Tremonti was forced to\n\nresign as Minister of Economics and Finance in July 2004\n\nafter a showdown with Fini, who accused Tremonti of\n\nmonopolizing economic policy decision-making and hiding the\n\ntrue state of Italy's public accounts (Ref B). Tremonti is\n\nseen as a firm supporter of the Lega's devolution/government\n\nreform, which could again create friction with AN and UDC.\n\n7. (SBU) Storace, the new health minister, is co-leader\n\nwith Agriculture Minister Alemanno of AN's \"Social Right\"\n\n(Destra Sociale) faction. Social Right is AN's strongly\n\npopulist wing, tending to support \"big\" government\n\nassistance to the voters. It does not fully support Fini's\n\nleadership. The appointment, however, cements Storace to\n\nthe government, leaving him less room to maneuver against\n\nFini from outside. Although he entered politics at age 14,\n\nthis is Storace's first cabinet post. The new Minister said\n\nhe would work to bring down the cost of medicine and to\n\ncomplete talks on the renewal of expired national contracts\n\nfor health sector workers, including doctors.\n\n8. (SBU) The new post of Minister without Portfolio for\n\nDevelopment and Territorial Unity is well suited for\n\nGianfranco Micciche', FI Coordinator for Sicily. In his\n\nmost recent position of deputy finance minister, he was\n\nalready responsible for southern Italy's economic\n\ndevelopment -- which begs the question why AN and UDC didn't\n\ndemand a new face. Micciche' is a strong promoter of\n\npolicies for the underdeveloped south, however, and giving\n\nthe topic ministerial attention is designed to reassure the\n\ntwo coalition partners of the premier's determination to do\n\nmore for the region. Micciche' told reporters that \"this\n\nsends out an essential sign (to the south)... I represent a\n\ndenial of those who spoke of a FI-Lega axis.\"\n\n9. (SBU) Mario Landolfi, former AN spokesman who replaces\n\nMaurizio Gasparri as Minister for Communications, is a\n\nrelative light weight in the Cabinet, having been a working\n\nlevel contact for us thus far. He is close to Fini, and he\n\nis also from Campania, in southern Italy.\n\n10. (SBU) Giorgio La Malfa, who replaced Buttiglione as EU\n\nPolicies Minister, leads the small but relatively\n\ninfluential Italian Republican Party. Born in Milan, La\n\nMalfa is close to Berlusconi and was elected to the Chamber\n\nof Deputies in 2001 on the FI ticket.\n\n11. (SBU) Stefano Caldoro, born in 1960, is almost\n\ncertainly the youngest minister. Formerly deputy minister\n\nfor education, Caldoro is also a southerner. He represents\n\nthe miniscule New PSI.\n\n-------\n\nCOMMENT\n\n-------\n\n12. (SBU) We expect the new Government to win relatively\n\neasy confirmation in confidence votes in the Chamber (likely\n\nlate on April 27) and the Senate (expected April 28). The\n\npolicies of the new Berlusconi Government will be much like\n\nthose of its predecessor, particularly on matters of most\n\ninterest to Washington -- Iraq, Afghanistan, the war on\n\nterror. In his presentation before Parliament on April 27,\n\nBerlusconi will have to show not only the voters, but\n\nperhaps more importantly coalition partners AN and UDC, that\n\nthe Government recognizes their dissatisfaction with the\n\nstate of the economy; this is likely to be the focus of the\n\nPrime Minister's speech. (Septel will report on what the\n\nnew Cabinet means for Berlusconi's economic program.)\n\n13. (SBU) While the center-right coalition parties have\n\nreconciled their differences to some degree, this alliance\n\nwill be under strain from now until the next national\n\nelections. We still expect elections to be in early 2006,\n\ngiven that the time for dissolving Parliament to hold\n\nelections in June is almost past. (Italian law requires a\n\n45-day campaign period prior to an election.) After June\n\ncomes the sacred summer vacation season, and after that come\n\nfall budget negotiations, neither of which are auspicious\n\nfor simultaneous national elections.\n\nSEMBLER\n\nNNNN\n\n2005ROME01409 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED"
