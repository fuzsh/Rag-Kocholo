        "text": "Tremonti: \"Here is how and why Berlusconi transformed the Italian economy\"\n\n\"The greatness of man is double: politics and business\"\n\n© Agenzia Nova - Reproduction reserved\n\n“The greatness of man is double. It's multi-level.\" Giulio Tremonti, now chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber for the Brothers of Italy, told Corriere della Sera that he has always been Silvio Berlusconi's public accounts man. Deputy prime minister, once finance minister and three times at the head of the unified ministry of economy and finance (MEF), Tremonti is the one who did not hesitate to call Berlusconi to the rigor when the latter, as prime minister, risked getting caught the hand. He is one of the few who had the courage: “Not everyone is aware of how profoundly Silvio Berlusconi has changed Italy. Italy, attention: not only Italian television”. “I'm talking about – explains the former minister – the fact that it was commercial. Until Berlusconi's televisions, Italians bought what they saw in shop windows. There was no other possibility. With commercial television, goods and assets have begun to be seen on the screen”. And that “really changed everything. Given the impact television had on audiences, it was a tremendous boost for the media industry. From this point of view, it changed Italy. It's not just the fact of having created a large group, but it is having made a decisive contribution to the entire Italian economy”. And the political side; “It's the best-known side, the one that developed to the end. There is only, always, to remember who marked an interruption in this story”.\n\nThe reference is to what Silvio Berlusconi called the 2011 coup: “Yes. I remain convinced that the famous couple Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy have actively contributed to the Italian spread. The history is there to see. The Berlusconi government fell due to the letter signed by the outgoing and incoming governors of the ECB inspired by Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy”. The fact remains that Silvio Berlusconi did not question his and Forza Italia's membership in the European People's Party until his last day: “Ah, there's no doubt about that. But the real story is what I just repeated,” concluded Tremonti\n\nRead also other news on Nova News\n\nFollow us on the social channels of Nova News on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Telegram\n\n© Agenzia Nova - Reproduction reserved\n\nLatest news\n\nSudan, the government accuses the RSF of killing 85 civilians in the south-east: \"A brutal massacre\"\n\nAmong the victims there would be \"students of Koranic schools\"\n\nVenezuela: thousands of people on the streets of Caracas for the demonstration called by Machado - video\n\nIn a message to the protesters, Machado defined today as \"a historic day\", in which \"Venezuela takes to the streets to unite in a strong embrace, full of conviction, trust and deep love\"\n\nOstia: minor molested while bathing, 34-year-old arrested\n\nThe victim turned to the lifeguard who, together with the establishment staff, blocked the man\n\nBrazil: X closes its office in the country with immediate effect due to \"threats of arrest\"\n\nDespite the closure of the office, X says, the social platform will still remain available to Brazilian users\n\nSchillaci: “We will evaluate further measures to prevent violence in hospitals”\n\nWhat happened in Castellammare di Stabia, \"where a man entered the hospital with a baseball bat, is not admissible\"\n\nOther news\n\nRussia, Kadyrov equips a Tesla with a machine gun: “For our fighters” – video\n\nThe Chechen leader praised both the vehicle and Tesla CEO Elon Musk\n\nMonkeypox, Bertolaso: “The Lombard surveillance system is active and effective”\n\nMpox is transmitted to people through close contact with infected animals or people or by touching materials contaminated by the virus\n\nRussia: The Federal Security Service has opened a case against the two Rai journalists who entered Kursk\n\nSimone Traini and Stefania Battistini are accused of illegally crossing the border of the Russian Federation and filming a video in Sudzha\n\nCeasefire in Gaza: Italy, UK, France and Germany sign declaration in support of talks\n\n“We underline the importance of avoiding any escalation in the region that could undermine the prospects for peace.
