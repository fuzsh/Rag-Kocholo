        "text": "The article presents the vision how Italy, as one of the EU founding members, negotiated about the necessary EU adjustments shaping it with the flexible integration discourse in the period of 1996-1997. It stipulates on how the Intergovernmental conference in Turin elaborated the draft agreement leading to the signing of the Amsterdam Treaty. The article is divided into two parts presenting, firstly, the theoretical background for the flexible integration, and then enriching the discussion about Italy's role in the EU Presidency during the period of Intergovernmental conference.\n\nThe row between the French and Italian governments over the issue of migrants fleeing North Africa in the wake of the ‘jasmine revolutions’ has raised some serious doubts about the future of Schengen, the policy regime that guarantees the free movement of people across Europe. Does this row really represent, as some commentators have suggested, the beginning of the end for one of the key pillars of European integration? In this paper I contend that the regime, despite some ominous signs, is not doomed. On the contrary, in the long term it might emerge reinforced from its current predicament. To support this argument, this paper reconstructs the evolution of Schengen’s past ‘crises’, showing how their content, dynamics and key protagonists bear striking similarities with the recent Franco-Italian row and its political fallout. From an institutional perspective, these crises represent cyclical adjustment mechanisms that have helped the regime withstand new challenges and consolidate its presence in Europe. The correspondences with past events suggest that the latest crisis is leading Schengen towards a similar institutional path.\n\nAbstract A comparison of the results of the most recent Intergovernmental Conference (IGC), which gave rise to the Constitutional Treaty, with the outcome of the previous IGC of 2000, which brought about the Nice Treaty, demonstrates that not all IGCs are equally efficient in achieving major compromises. The IGC of 2000 failed to resolve important issues, while the IGC of 2003-04 was a major success on nearly all aspects of the negotiating agenda. What explains the variation in the efficiency of these last two IGCs?\n\nThe book is also available in print from Amazon Germany: http://www.amazon.de/dp/3737561915 The 2009 Lisbon Treaty reform created the remodeled version of the High Representative of the Union as a potentially powerful agent to represent and coordinate Europe’s foreign policy. However, this book shows how and why the EU member states granted only limited discretion to the new foreign policy actor during the first years of the post’s existence. This study argues that the EU foreign policy chief is the constrained agent of Europe’s foreign policy. The book comprises an in-depth analysis of the history of the post of EU High Representative, the setting-up of the European External Action Service (EEAS), the tenure of Baroness Catherine Ashton as the first incumbent of the office, and of the 2013 review of the EEAS. The aim of the book is to reveal the conditions of discretion of the EU High Representative. With the use of a principal-agent (PA) approach, the book shows that conflicting preferences of the member states, tight control mechanisms, as well as inadequate cooperation with the European Commission limited the High Representative’s room for manoeuvre. It is suggested that the post of High Representative has the potential to emancipate from its status of a constrained agent over time, and to gain credibility as a foreign policy actor. The findings suggest that the PA approach can be developed further in the future in order to better explain limited discretion of agents in matters of foreign policy. Based on the findings, the study also puts forward a number of characteristics of a ‘constrained agent’."
