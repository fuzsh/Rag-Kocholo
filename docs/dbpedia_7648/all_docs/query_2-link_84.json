        "text": "ROME: Milan airport is to be named after Italy’s scandal-dogged tycoon Silvio Berlusconi, a former three-time prime minister, despite protests Tuesday from the Italian city’s center-left mayor.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, who is also transport minister and head of the far-right League party, announced the name change Friday, just over a year after Berlusconi’s death.\n\n“The final decision rests with the Minister of Transport and I am ready to sign it, with pride and emotion, in memory of my friend Silvio, great entrepreneur, great Milanese, and great Italian,” Salvini said.\n\nMilan’s mayor Giuseppe Sala said Tuesday the decision to change the name of Malpensa, one of the biggest airports in Italy, should not have been Salvini’s alone.\n\n“Can a decision of this kind be made in 24 hours?” he was quoted by the AGI Italian news agency as saying.\n\nBillionaire Berlusconi, who died in June last year aged 86, had strong ties to Milan but was a highly divisive figure.\n\nWhile some Italians saw him as a charming, self-made man, others slammed him as an international embarrassment, particularly due to his many legal woes and sexual scandals.\n\nThe former cruise ship singer was born in the northern Italian city and built his immense fortune there.\n\nFor over 30 years he chaired AC Milan, which won the Champions League five times on his watch.\n\nBut he was also dogged by accusations he paid young starlets for their silence over his notoriously hedonistic soirees, which he always insisted were elegant dinners.\n\nBerlusconi was sentenced in 2013 to seven years in jail for paying for sex with a 17-year-old starlet known as “Ruby the Heart-Stealer,” though that conviction was later overturned.\n\nHis second wife, Veronica Lario, divorced him in 2014, saying at the time that she could no longer tolerate his “consorting with minors.”\n\nThe Milan division of Italy’s main opposition party, the center-left Democratic Party (PD), also assailed what the “inappropriate and wrong choice.”\n\n“Our gateway to the world deserves to represent a shared memory and the unifying values of our country,” it said in a statement, saying it was collecting names of “non-divisive figures” for whom Malpensa could be named.\n\nLeft-wing trade union CGIL posted an online petition on Change.org to propose naming the airport instead after Carla Fracci (1936-2021), a renowned Italian ballet dancer from Milan.\n\nIt said Fracci “transmitted elegance, style and bravura throughout the world,” and appealed to authorities to “avoid choices that are sources of deep divisions.”\n\nWASHINGTON: Is America ready to elect a Black woman as its president? Vice President Kamala Harris, who will be officially confirmed as the Democratic US presidential nominee in Chicago next week, is betting that it is.\n\n“In my entire career, I’ve heard people say when I ran... people aren’t ready, it’s not your time, nobody like you has done that before,” the Democrat said in 2019 when she ran against Joe Biden in the primary presidential campaign.\n\n“I haven’t listened and I would suggest that nobody should listen to that kind of conversation.”\n\nBut Harris’s campaign never took off and she left the primaries race before Biden picked her as his running mate.\n\nIf Harris, 59, manages to beat Donald Trump in November, she will become the first woman and the second Black person, after Barack Obama, to run the world’s leading power.\n\nIn so many ways, Harris already is a trailblazer. Born to an Indian mother and a Jamaican father, she was the first woman attorney general ever elected in California, on top of being the first African American and Asian American to hold that post. She then became the first vice president in US history in those same categories.\n\nIn a survey published in September 2023, the Pew Research Center, a Washington-based think tank, found that for a majority of Americans, gender does not play a role in choosing a president.\n\nSixty percent of respondents said that a female president would handle pressure as well as a man, while 27 percent believed that she would do better.\n\n“While female leadership — whether as presidents, queens, prime ministers, and heads of state — has become the norm in many parts of the world, including Europe, Asia, South America, and African nations, the United States has yet to experience this moment,” said Sonia Gipson Rankin, a law professor at the University of New Mexico.\n\nShe noted that even though Democrat Hillary Clinton lost the electoral college and therefore the presidency to Trump in 2016, she won the popular vote.\n\nRegina Bateson, a professor of political science at the University of Colorado Boulder, believes that voters’ biases may not themselves be the issue.\n\n“The problem is often not that voters are actually biased,” Bateson said. “It’s that party insiders and delegates and political donors worry that the voters will be biased.”\n\nThat leads them to withhold support from a woman of color, a phenomenon that Bateson calls “strategic discrimination,” which usually manifests itself during the primaries when a candidate must demonstrate that he or she is able to rally many groups of voters.\n\nHarris, however, took over from Biden after the 81-year-old leader withdrew from the race, thus sparing her “this process of trying to convince people that she’s electable” during the primaries.\n\nFlanked by her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a 60-year-old white man, Harris now hopes to win the trust of all Americans, regardless of ethnicity or gender.\n\nSome are already convinced such as “White dudes for Harris,” a group that brought nearly 200,000 people together for a Zoom fundraiser for Harris in late July, raising more than $4 million.\n\nDonald Trump didn’t wait long to attack his Democratic rival on her background.\n\nThe billionaire charged that Harris “turned Black” only recently in order to win electoral support.\n\nHarris, who had always spoken of her Black and Asian heritage with pride, called out Trump for his “divisiveness and disrespect.”\n\nThe former president’s running mate, J.D. Vance, caused an outcry recently when a 2021 video resurfaced in which he dismisses the Democratic Party as being run by “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives... and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too.”\n\nHarris is married to Douglas Emhoff and helped in raising his two children from a previous marriage. She does not have any biological children of her own.\n\nVance’s comments caused a backlash amplified by Hollywood stars such as Jennifer Aniston and Glenn Close, and were widely considered a political misstep in a country where the fertility rate is historically low.\n\nVance has sought to walk back his remarks saying they were taken out of context.\n\nWARSAW, Poland: Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Saturday reacted to reports that revived questions about who blew up the Nord Stream pipelines in 2022, saying the initiators of the gas pipeline project should “apologize and keep quiet.” That comment came after one of his deputies denied a claim that Warsaw was partly responsible for its damage.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that Ukrainian authorities were responsible for blowing up the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines in September 2022, a dramatic act of sabotage that cut Germany off from a key source of energy and worsened an energy crisis in Europe.\n\nGermany was a partner with Russia in the pipeline project. Poland has long said its own security interests have been harmed by Nord Stream.\n\n“To all the initiators and patrons of Nord Stream 1 and 2. The only thing you should do today about it is apologize and keep quiet,” Tusk wrote on the social media portal X Saturday.\n\nTusk appeared to be reacting specifically to a claim by a former head of Germany’s foreign intelligence agency, BND, August Hanning, who told the German daily Die Welt that the attack on the Nord Stream gas pipelines must have had Poland’s support. Hanning said Germany should consider seeking compensation from Poland and Ukraine.\n\nHanning, who retired from his spy chief job, did not provide any evidence in support of his claim. Some observers noted that he served under former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who went on to work later for Russian state-owned energy companies, including Nord Stream.\n\nKrzysztof Gawkowski, a deputy Polish prime minister and the minister of digital affairs, strongly denied reports that Poland and Ukraine had damaged the Nord Stream gas pipeline in an interview Friday on the Polsat broadcaster.\n\nGawkowski alleged that the comments of the former member of the German intelligence service were “inspired by Moscow” and were aimed at destabilizing NATO countries.\n\n“I believe that this is the sound of Russian disinformation,” he added.\n\nOn Wednesday, Polish prosecutors confirmed that they had received a warrant for a Ukrainian man wanted by Germany as a suspect in the pipeline attack, but that he left the country before he could be arrested.\n\nThe Nord Stream project, with its two pipelines created to carry gas from Russia to Europe along the Baltic Sea bed, went ahead despite opposition from Poland, the US and Ukraine.\n\nThey allowed Russia to send gas directly to Western Europe, bypassing Poland and Ukraine. With all gas previously going over land, Warsaw and Kyiv feared losing huge sums in transit fees and political leverage that came with controlling the gas transports.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal said in its report published Thursday that it spoke to four senior Ukrainian defense and security officials who either participated in or had direct knowledge of the plot. All of them said the pipelines were a legitimate target in Ukraine’s war of defense against Russia. Ukrainian authorities are denying the claims.\n\nNord Stream 1 was completed and came online in 2011. Nord Stream 2 was not finished until the fall of 2021 but never became operational due to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nDAKAR: An attack blamed on Al-Qaeda-linked jihadists in central Mali has killed at least 15 soldiers, three local officials told AFP, in the latest violence to hit the troubled region.\n\nMali has for more than a decade been ravaged by jihadists and other armed groups, with the center of the West African country becoming a hotbed of violence since 2015.\n\n“At least 15 Malian soldiers were killed on Thursday in an ambush by jihadists from the Group for the Support of Islam and Muslims,” an elected official from the central Mopti region told AFP, requesting anonymity due to security reasons.\n\nThe source added that there were also “missing and wounded soldiers.”\n\nAnother elected official confirmed the information, adding that the provisional toll included “14 members of the national guard and one gendarme.”\n\n“Other soldiers are missing, and army equipment was taken away by the assailants,” the source added.\n\nA separate local authority official said the attack occurred five kilometers (three miles) from the village of Diallassagou, adding that “there are more than 10 wounded and more than 15 dead in the Malian army.”\n\nAll spoke on the condition of anonymity for security reasons.\n\nContacted by AFP by telephone, a Malian military source in the regional capital Mopti said: “if you say that we have lost 15 people, you should know that the terrorists have lost more people,” employing a term often used to describe the jihadists.\n\nMali has since 2012 been plagued by different factions affiliated to Al-Qaeda and the Daesh group, as well as by self-declared self-defense forces and bandits.\n\nAt the end of July, the army and the Russian mercenary group Wagner suffered one of their biggest setbacks in years in northern Mali, picking up heavy losses at the hands of separatist rebels and jihadists.\n\nIn three days of intense fighting, Tuareg-led separatists said they had killed 84 Wagner fighters and 47 Malian soldiers.\n\nThe West African nation’s military leaders, who seized power in 2020 and 2021 coups, have made a priority of retaking control of all of the country from the separatists and jihadist forces.\n\nUnder Col. Assimi Goita, the junta broke off its traditional alliance with former colonial ruler France and has turned toward Russia.\n\nGOMA, Congo: Sarah Bagheni had a headache, fever, and itchy and unusual skin lesions for days, but she had no inkling that her symptoms might have been caused by mpox and that she might be another case in a growing global health emergency.\n\nShe also has no idea where to go to get medical help.\n\nShe and her husband live in the Bulengo displacement camp in eastern Congo, a region that is effectively ground zero for a series of mpox outbreaks in Africa.\n\nThis year’s alarming rise in cases, including a new form of the virus identified by scientists in eastern Congo, led the World Health Organization to declare it a global health emergency on Wednesday. It said the new variant could spread beyond the five African countries where it had already been detected — a timely warning that came a day before Sweden reported its first case of the new strain.\n\nIn the vast central African nation of Congo, which has had more than 96 percent of the world’s roughly 17,000 recorded cases of mpox this year — and some 500 deaths from the disease — many of the most vulnerable seem unaware of its existence or the threat that it poses.\n\n“We know nothing about this,” Bagheni’s husband, Habumuremyiza Hire, said Thursday about mpox. “I watch her condition helplessly because I don’t know what to do. We continue to share the same room.”\n\nMillions are thought to be out of reach of medical help or advice in the conflict-torn east, where dozens of rebel groups have been fighting Congolese army forces for years over mineral-rich areas, causing a huge displacement crisis. Hundreds of thousands of people like Bagheni and her husband have been forced into overcrowded refugee camps around Goma, while more have taken refuge in the city.\n\nConditions in the camps are dire and medical facilities are almost nonexistent.\n\nMahoro Faustin, who runs the Bulengo camp, said that about three months ago, administrators first started noticing people in the camp exhibiting fever, body aches and chills — symptoms that could signal malaria, measles or mpox.\n\nThere is no way of knowing how many mpox cases there might be in Bulengo because of a lack of testing, he said. There haven’t been any recent health campaigns to educate the tens of thousands of people in the camp about mpox, and Faustin said he’s worried about how many people might be undiagnosed.\n\n“Just look at the overcrowding here,” he said, pointing to a sea of ramshackle tents. “If nothing is done, we will all be infected here, or maybe we are already all infected.”\n\nAround 70 percent of the new mpox cases in the Goma area in the last two months that were registered at a treatment center run by Medair were from displacement camps, said Dr. Pierre Olivier Ngadjole, the international aid group’s health adviser in Congo. The youngest of those cases was a month-old baby and the oldest a 90-year-old, he said.\n\nIn severe cases of mpox, people can develop lesions on the face, hands, arms, chest and genitals. While the disease originated in animals, the virus has in recent years been spreading between people via close physical contact, including sex.\n\nBagheni’s best hope of getting a diagnosis for her lesions is a government hospital that’s a two-hour drive away. That’s likely out of the question, given that she already struggles with mobility having previously had both her legs amputated.\n\nSeven million people are internally displaced in Congo, with more than 5.5 million of them in the country’s east, according the UN refugee agency. Congo has the largest displacement camp population in Africa, and one of the largest in the world.\n\nThe humanitarian crisis in eastern Congo has almost every possible complication when it comes to stopping an mpox outbreak, said Dr. Chris Beyrer, director of Duke University’s Global Health Institute.\n\nThat includes war, illicit mining industries that attract sex workers, transient populations near border regions, and entrenched poverty. He also said the global community missed multiple warning signs.\n\n“We’re paying attention to it now, but mpox has been spreading since 2017 in Congo and Nigeria,” Beyrer said, adding that experts have long been calling for vaccines to be shared with Africa, but to little effect. He said the WHO’s emergency declaration was “late in coming,” with more than a dozen countries already affected.\n\nBeyrer said that unlike COVID-19 or HIV, there’s a good vaccine and good treatments and diagnostics for mpox, but “the access issues are worse than ever” in places like eastern Congo.\n\nIn 2022, there were outbreaks in more than 70 countries around the world, including the United States, which led the WHO to also declare an emergency that lasted until mid-2023. It was largely shut down in wealthy countries within months through the use of vaccines and treatments, but few doses have been made available in Africa.\n\nThe new and possibly more infectious strain of mpox was first detected this year in a mining town in eastern Congo, about 450 kilometers (280 miles) south of Goma. It’s unclear how much the new strain is to blame, but Congo is now enduring its worst outbreak yet and at least 13 African countries have recorded cases, four of them for the first time.\n\nThe outbreaks in those four countries — Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda — have been linked to Congo’s, and Doctors Without Borders said Friday that Congo’s surge “threatens a major spread of the disease” to other countries.\n\nSalim Abdool Karim, an infectious disease expert who chairs the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s emergency committee, said the Congo outbreak has a particularly concerning change, in that it’s disproportionately affecting young people. Children under 15 account for 70 percent of cases and 85 percent of all deaths in the country, the Africa CDC reported.\n\nUnlike the 2022 global outbreak, which predominantly affected gay and bisexual men, mpox now appears to be spreading in heterosexual populations.\n\nAll of Congo’s 26 provinces have recorded mpox cases, according to the state-run news agency. But Health Minister Samuel-Roger Kamba said Thursday that the country doesn’t have a single vaccine dose yet and he pleaded for “vigilance in all directions from all Congolese.”\n\nDr. Rachel Maguru, who heads the multi-epidemic center at Goma’s North Kivu provincial hospital, said they also don’t have drugs or any established treatments for mpox and are relying on other experts such as dermatologists to help where they can. A larger outbreak around the city and its numerous displacement camps already overburdened with an influx of people would be “terrible,” she said.\n\nShe also noted a pivotal problem: poor and displaced people have other priorities, like earning enough money to eat and survive. Aid agencies and stretched local authorities are already wrestling with providing food, shelter and basic health care to the millions displaced, while also dealing with outbreaks of other diseases like cholera."
