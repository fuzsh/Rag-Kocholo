        "text": "Newly elected Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is planning to fill the key EU portfolio ministries with a mixture of familiar faces and relative unknowns on the Brussels circuit.\n\nBerlusconi will announce his cabinet on 5 May at the earliest, but there is already a broad consensus about who will be the core figures in his cabinet and what ministries they will control. The best-known figure will be Franco Frattini, until 14 March the commissioner for justice and home affairs, who returns as foreign minister, a post he occupied under the last Berlusconi government from November 2002 to November 2004. Giulio Tremonti, another member of Berlusconi’s Popolo della Libertà (People of Freedom) party, will also return as the powerful minister for economy and finance, a post he held from June 2001 until July 2004 and again from April 2005 until May 2006.\n\nThere will be new faces at the sensitive ministries for justice and home affairs. The justice minister is likely to be upcoming legal talent Giulia Buongiorno, who represented former Christian Democrat premier Giuliano Andreotti in his trial for links to the Mafia. The interior minister is likely to be Roberto Maroni, from the Lega Nord (Northern League) party. Both Buongiorno and Maroni are new to Brussels and relatively unknown. When German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble was asked about his new colleague in Berlin on 23 April he replied: “I don’t know him”, adding that he had “worked well in the past with previous Berlusconi governments”. He also praised Italy’s outgoing interior minister Giuliano Amato who, he said, had played an “enormous role” in justice and home affairs."
