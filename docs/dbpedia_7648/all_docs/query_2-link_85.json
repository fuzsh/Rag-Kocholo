        "text": "Italian President Sergio Mattarella had tasked the former European Central Bank president with trying to form a government up to managing the the health, economic and social crises of the coronavirus pandemic. AdDraghi’s most-quoted words so far have been those uttered in 2012 when the euro-zone risked collapsing in a crisis of confidence and he vowed the European Central Bank would do “whatever it takes” to rescue the euro. The current head of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, tweeted her congratulations. Italy's health minister through the pandemic, Roberto Speranza, kept his post, the sole minister from a small left-wing party. ___This story has been corrected to show that employees applauded for Conte, not Draghi.\n\nLeader of the Five-Stars Movement Vito Crimi, 2nd from right, addresses the media at the Quirinale presidential palace in Rome Friday, Jan. 29, 2021. Draghi, 73, the former president of the European Central Bank completed a first round of talks with political parties this week. Another round is expected early next week on potential Cabinet ministers and a synthesis from Draghi of his vision for the new government. AdItaly's president tapped Draghi this week to form a government after the resignation of ex-Premier Giuseppe Conte, who lost support of a small but key coalition party. Salvini’s move to support Draghi puts him at odds with the far-right Brothers of Italy party and its leader, Giorgia Meloni.\n\nOutgoing Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte waves as he leaves after meeting journalists outside Chigi palace Premier's office in Rome, Thursday, Feb. 4, 2021. Draghi must rely on political support to pass measures aimed at helping Italy emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic and revive its economy, already stagnant before being pummeled by lockdown measures. “I hope for a political government that is solid and has sufficient cohesion to be able to make political choices, because the urgencies of the country need political choices, they can’t be entrusted to technocrats,” Conte said. Conte also pitched to two other parties from his unraveled coalition, the center-left Democrats and the leftist Free and Equal Party. His call for a political alliance appeared to indicate Conte intended to stay in politics, even while out of office.\n\nFormer European Central Bank president Mario Draghi speaks to the media after accepting a mandate to form Italy's new government from Italian President Sergio Mattarella at the Rome's Quirinale Presidential Palace, Wednesday Feb. 3, 2021. During his tenure at the European Central Bank, Draghi became known as “Super Mario\" for using new and sometimes unorthodox policy tools to solve the vexing debt crisis and other problems. “As such, it will not vote in favor of a technical government headed by Mario Draghi,” Crimi said in a statement. “If they (the 5-Stars and the League) are going to somehow support Draghi then the government I think can be born,\" he said in an interview. “Now everyone of good will must welcome President Mattarella's appeal to support the government of Mario Draghi,\" he said Wednesday.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte attends the debate at the Senate prior to a confidence vote, in Rome, Tuesday, Jan. 19, 2021. With a reduced majority, Conte will have to cobble together support from outside the current coalition to pass legislation, including aid to help Italy’s pandemic-battered economy. Conte’s government on Tuesday survived what amounted to a confidence vote with a 156-to-140 win, with 16 abstentions. “The numbers speak clearly,” said Giorgia Melloni, head of the small but rising Brothers of Italy party. In the lower Chamber of Deputies, where the 16-month-old government holds a more comfortable margin, Conte won a first confidence vote on Monday.\n\nFILE - In this Monday, Sept. 14, 2020 file photo, Silvio Berlusconi is flanked by his personal physician Alberto Zangrillo, left, as he talks to the media while leaving the San Raffaele hospital in Milan, Italy.

(AP Photo/Luca Bruno, File)MILAN – Former Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi has been hospitalized in the principality of Monaco to undergo medical tests for heart problems, his press office confirmed on Thursday. The 84-year-old three-time premier is expected to return home in a few days.\n\nWASHINGTON – Some answers emerged Saturday on President Donald Trump’s condition as he battles the coronavirus, but Trump’s medical team withheld some key information in their first full, televised update. Trump’s medical team gave its first news conference since he fell ill. Navy Commander Dr. Sean Conley said Trump had been fever-free for 24 hours. He said Trump’s blood oxygen level is 96%, which is in the normal range. And asked for the president’s vital signs, Conley failed to provide any of Trump’s temperature readings. That could indicate how serious the president’s condition was, a measurement the public didn’t get as Trump spent his first full day at Walter Reed.\n\n(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)WASHINGTON – Stricken by COVID-19, a feverish and fatigued President Donald Trump was flown to a military hospital Friday night where he was given remdesivir following treatment with an experimental drug at the White House. Also testing positive: Trump’s campaign manager, Bill Stepien. “President Trump remains in good spirts, has mild symptoms, and has been working throughout the day,” said press secretary Kayleigh McEnany. Very early Friday, after returning from the Thursday afternoon New Jersey fundraiser, Trump stunningly tweeted, \"Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. White House chief of staff Mark Meadows on Friday confirmed that the White House knew Hope Hicks, the aide, had tested positive before Trump attended the fundraiser.\n\n(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)WASHINGTON – Stricken by COVID-19, a feverish and fatigued President Donald Trump was flown to a military hospital Friday night where he is being given Remdesivir therapy after being injected with an experimental drug combination in treatment at the White House.

He checked into the San Raffaele hospital in Milan early Friday after testing positive for the virus earlier in the week. The patient is responding optimally to treatment,\" Zangrillo told reporters outside the hospital. Zangrillo suggested Berlusconi wouldn't be released anytime soon, recalling that the virus requires adequate treatment and takes its time.Berlusconi spent some of his summer vacation at his seaside villa on Sardinias Emerald Coast. To date, Berlusconi is believed to still be in a VIP ward of the clinic.\n\n(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)BEIJING Beijings main international airport on Thursday began again receiving international flights from a limited number of countries considered at low risk of coronavirus infection. California State university at Chico also halted classes this week. State health officials are wary that festivities over the Labor Day holiday weekend could lead to renewed surges in COVID-19 infections. The number could be higher because some schools, including the states largest Georgia State University are not posting full reports publicly. ___PARIS New daily coronavirus cases in France have tipped above 7,000 for the second time in five days.\n\nRed paint and words in Italian reading racist\", above, and \"rapist are seen on a statue of late Italian journalist Indro Montanelli, who had acknowledged having had a 12-year-old Eritrean bride while stationed in the Italian colony in the 1930s, in a Milan park that bears his name, northern Italy, late Saturday, June 13, 2020. The statue of Montanelli has been a flashpoint in Italys Black Lives Matters protests, which have put renewed focus on Italys colonial past. (AP Photo/Antonio Calanni)MILAN Milans mayor on Sunday resisted calls to remove a statue from a public park of a late Italian journalist who had acknowledged having had a 12-year-old Eritrean bride during Italys colonial occupation in the 1930s. He was a great journalist, a journalist who fought for the liberty of the state, an independent journalist. She was a beautiful girl of 12 years, Montanelli told the 1969 talk show appearance, adding a smiling excuse me.\n\nHe also asked Spadafora to lighten the responsibility of team physicians if players and club members get sick from the virus. They said to themselves, If something like that happens here, we would be responsible according to Italian law.WARY WATFORDPozzos family also owns English club Watford, which is opposing the Premier Leagues restart plans. Both Udinese and Watford are hovering just above their respective relegation zones. SUCCESS STORYThe Pozzos bought Watford in 2012 and quickly brought the club up from the second division to the Premier League. He attributed last seasons success and five straight campaigns in the Premier League partly to the familys strategy of sending players back and forth between Udinese and Watford, sometimes via loans.\n\nOn Take Back the Night marchesWhile at Dartmouth, Menashi often covered Greek life and culture on campus for The Dartmouth Review. \"For years, tony colleges have sneered at the military for worrying about open homosexuals in the ranks,\" Menashi wrote. Menashi wrote in December 1998, after the episode made national news, that no one carried toy guns and only one person sported an Afro. At the conclusion of the film, the white man breaks down crying from guilt,\" wrote Menashi. \"Throughout the book contributors address the issue of cultural relativism, the most conspicuous example being the brouhaha surrounding Silvio Berlusconi's proclamation of the superiority of Western civilization over Islam,\" wrote Menashi."
