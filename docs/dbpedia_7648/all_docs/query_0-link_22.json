        "text": "ROME, Italy -- Media magnate Silvio Berlusconi is preparing to officially accept the mandate to form Italy's new government.\n\nHe will meet with President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi on Saturday to formally accept the reigns of power after winning the May 13 general election with his centre-right coalition.\n\nThe presidential palace said Ciampi had summoned the billionaire businessman to his office for 7 p.m. (1700 GMT) on Saturday, when he will ask Berlusconi to lead Italy's 59th government since 1945.\n\nCiampi told reporters minutes before the statement was issued. \"I have ended the political consultations and there is total agreement among the parliamentary majority that Silvio Berlusconi... should receive the mandate to form the government.\"\n\nBerlusconi has spent the past four weeks putting together his team.\n\nHe has been choosing people from his own party and his alliance members, the right-wing National Alliance, two centrist parties and the devolutionist Northern League.\n\nCiampi, himself a former prime minister, has spent the past two days consulting with the newly elected speakers of both houses of parliament and the defeated centre-left bloc led by Francesco Rutelli, as is required by the protracted Italian political process.\n\nThe president's non-partisan role is largely ceremonial but he appoints a prime minister who is capable of commanding a majority in the parliament.\n\nBerlusconi's alliance is expected to win the mandatory votes of confidence in both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of parliament.\n\nBerlusconi will not return to see Ciampi with his ministerial list until Monday morning, political sources told Reuters. The government will then be formally sworn into office later on Monday, the sources said.\n\nThe League, led by the outspoken Umberto Bossi, looks set to win the justice ministry and Bossi himself could become institutional reforms minister with a place at the inner circle table together with right wing National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini as deputy prime minister, according to Reuters.\n\nForza Italia's Giulio Tremonti is expected to be named economy minister and Rocco Buttiglione is tipped to become EU Affairs minister, Reuters reported.\n\nBerlusconi has said he will fulfil two pledges within his first 100 days in office -- to put the economy at the top of his agenda and to tackle the controversial issue of his conflict of interest.\n\nHe has said he will consign his media, publishing, advertising and financial services empire to a blind trust to overcome accusations of conflict interest, but the opposition centre-left has already said that might not be enough.\n\nBerlusconi also faces two more court cases, one on bribery charges, the other for false accounting.\n\nThe European Union will watch how his government positions itself on issues such as global warming and EU enlargement.\n\nBerlusconi is set to attend the NATO summit in Brussels on Wednesday and then travel to Gothenburg in Sweden for his first EU summit on June 15-16."
