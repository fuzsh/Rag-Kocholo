        "text": "The former Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, has relaunched Forza Italia, the centre-right party that brought him to power two decades ago.\n\nA leaders' meeting voted to suspend the People of Freedom Party (PDL) and restore the name used until 2007.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Angelino Alfano and other PDL figures were absent from the vote, hinting at party divisions.\n\nEarlier this month party moderates refused to support Mr Berlusconi's attempt to bring down the government.\n\nThe national council of the PDL will meet on 8 December to ratify the decision of its leaders.\n\n\"With today's decision we returned fully to the status of Forza Italy that gives the president the right and duty to delegate responsibilities and functions,\" said Mr Berlusconi in a press conference after the meeting.\n\nHe said the move had been voted for \"unanimously\" by those present at the meeting, which was not attended by Mr Alfano, who is the PDL secretary, and four other government ministers."
