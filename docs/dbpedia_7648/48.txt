Giulio Tremonti (born August 18, 1947) is an Italian politician. He is the current Minister of Economy and Finance in the Italian government, presided over by Silvio Berlusconi. He served in the same capacity and as Deputy Prime Minister in prior Berlusconi cabinets.

Tremonti is a full professor of law at the University of Pavia, Italy, and has been a Visiting Professor at the Institute of Comparative Law, Oxford. His particular fields of interest are fiscal and tributary law, as well as fiscal policies.

Born in Sondrio, Northern Lombardy, in a family of Venetian ancestry (from Lorenzago di Cadore, Northern Veneto), he was the man who facilitated the dialogue between billionaire entrepreneur/politician Silvio Berlusconi and Umberto Bossi, leader of the federalist Northern League and a friend of Tremonti's, leading to the formation of the center-right coalition House of Freedoms. Although a member of Forza Italia, on many issues he is closer to the League. In particular, he is a staunch political and fiscal federalist, supporting a federal reform of the Italian political system and more autonomy for Lombardy and Veneto, where he has his core supporters.
