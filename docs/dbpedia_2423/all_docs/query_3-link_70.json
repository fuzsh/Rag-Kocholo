        "text": "The institute is established as Model Colleges (General) under the primary components of Rashtriya Uchchattar Shiksha Abhiyan(RUSA). RUSA(Hindi for “National Higher Fducation Mission”）is a holistic scheme of development for higher education in India initiated in 2013 by the Ministry of Human Resource Development,Government of India. The centrally sponsored scheme aims at providing strategic funding to higher educational institutions throughout the country.Funding is provided by the central ministry through the state governments and Union Territories(UT), which in coordination with the central Project Appraisal Board will monitor the academic, administrative and financial advancements taken under the scheme. A total of 316 state public universities and 13,024 colleges will be covered under it.Innovative educational policies in India have been a huge success.\n\nSarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) launched in 2001 for elementary education and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan(RMSA) launched in 2009 for secondary education produced great results in the educational developments. For higher education University Grants Commission (UGC) has a provision for routine innovation and development fundings. RUSA is provided by the Central Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) directly to the state and UT governments.From the state/UT budget the funds are disbursed to individual institutions.The funding to states would be made on the basis of critical appraisal of state plans for higher education plans. The amount of funding from central government will be 65%of the total grants,and 35%will be contributed by the state/UT as matching share.For northeastern states,Sikkim, Jammu and Kashmir and Uttarakhand the matching share is waived to 10%.During the 12th Five-Year Plan period between 2012-2017, RUSA is allotted a financial outlay of INR 228.55 billion,of which INR 162.27 billion will be contributed by the central government.\n\nDuring the first phase, 80 New universities would be created by converting autonomous colleges/colleges in a cluster state universities. 100 new colleges would be set up and 54 existing colleges would be converted into model degree colleges. Infrastructure grants would be given to 150 universities and 3,500 colleges to upgrade and fill critical gaps in infrastructure especially libraries, laboratories,etc. Further additional 5000 faculty positions would be supported. Then the scheme will extend into the 13th Five-Year Plan."
