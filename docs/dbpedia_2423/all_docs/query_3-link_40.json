        "text": "The ionospheric total electron content (TEC) collected from GPS data at Guwahati (geographic latitude 26.20N, geographic longitude 91.70E, geomagnetic latitude 15.20N), during high, medium and low solar activity periods is analysed to examine the influence of geomagnetic storm on the TEC near the equatorial anomaly crest region, and to assess the predictability of the existing ionospheric model such as the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) on the TEC for different solar activity conditions. The paper shows that the TEC values derived from the IRI-2012 model vary widely with solar activity and can be used only for predicting daytime quiet day TEC with fair accuracy over Guwahati during low solar activity (LSA) and medium solar activity (MSA) period, but the model computation for geomagnetic stormtime TEC is far more complex."
