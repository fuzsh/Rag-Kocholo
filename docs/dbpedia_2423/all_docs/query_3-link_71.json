        "text": "The dawn of the twentieth century saw the beginning of a new era in the academic domain of Assam. The pioneering and untiring efforts of some noble persons and the general people to meet the need of an institute of higher education in greater Jagara region were immensely encouraged. The support and sympathetic view of a few dedicated persons made longstanding dream of the people of this province come to reality through the establishment of Uttar Kampith Mahavidyalaya as a higher educational institute. With the inauguration of Uttar Kampith Mahavidyalaya on 20th November, 1983 a glorious chapter in academic and social history of greater Jagara began.\n\nEstablished under pressing needs there was encouraging response from the aspiring students of this college. In the matter of academic attainment this college completely has tried to fulfill the goal for which it was born. At present, a provincialised college (01-01-2013), the College has crossed its thirty eight years of glorious history.\n\nUTTAR KAMPITH MAHAVIDYALAYA: AT A GLANCE\n\nName: Uttar Kampith Mahavidyalaya, Jagara\n\nAddress: P.O.: Jagara, Dist.: Nalbari, State:Assam (India) Pin. 781310\n\nTel: 03624-291155; 8638153869\n\nEmail: [email protected] / [email protected]\n\nEmail IQAC: [email protected]\n\nPrincipal: Dr. Pankaj Kr.
