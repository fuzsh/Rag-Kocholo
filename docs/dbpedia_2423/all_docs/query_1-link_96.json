        "text": "Weekends had always been fascinating; until recently, as the planet has been forced to go through humongous changes resulting in change in our daily behaviour and lifestyle habits. Leisure, which has always been considered as amusing, has turned out to be irritating. Out of nowhere, I came across this, which took me back to what was not something so voguish then, but pinches hard at the essence now, as I look back today, months later.\n\nToday is a fine Saturday midnight. Here at Nagaon, the weather is windy. Mild rains. Electricity cut-off. The socket of this room is connected to our home inverter. Switched on; the extension cord is lying on the table beside this bed, with the mobile charger at work. The power cord of the laptop is also doing its duty.\n\nI, inside the mosquito net, am sitting relaxed by the window, with the earphones on. Some gentle classical music there. Biting my nails, am presently into thoughts. Of the college classes, of the evening roadside snacks, of the go-outs, of the… All of which has been a thing of the nearby past now. How everything has seemingly changed and left a silent influence on all of us! “It takes 21 days to form a habit”, I had read this somewhere. And it has already been multiplied twice, in fact, thrice. And now, on the fourth. What takes 21 days to form a habit, is now four times more impactful and influential. Fifth, scheduled.\n\nBeyond the gadgets…\n\nEnjoying the self-companionship and not wanting to sleep, I took up the phone and switched on the mobile data. Vibrations. Notifications. I took out the earphone jack from the laptop and got it into the phone. The outer earbud shell is in the ear, though nothing is being played. Checking the notifications, I was shifting from one application to the other. “Gallery”, paused. Kept scrolling to find some pictures that had been clicked on the second last day of February this year.\n\nThe Department of Communication and Journalism, Gauhati University had organised “Jonaki”, a North-East Film Festival at the PD Hall and AT Hall in the university premises. With the tagline “Inspired from the roots”, it was a two-day event on the last two days of February, the 28th and the 29th. According to the organisers, the “Jonaki” Film Festival gives students and visitors a chance to experience notable films directed and produced in the North-Eastern region; which further includes workshops, interactive sessions and screening of some of the aesthetically inclined films.\n\nOur Head of the Department (HOD) at college had informed us about this, a few days prior to the date of the event and had asked us all to visit this campus. Accordingly, my friends were out on the morning of the concerned first-day, while I got out in the afternoon. Had taken me minutes more than half-an-hour from Bhangagarh to Jalukbari to reach the entrance of this prestigious university. Though not for the first time, this was a special occasion.\n\nAt the location: East, West, North, South\n\nOn the way, I was traveling alone. Coincidentally, had met some friends from the university, at the entrance itself, near the “Dr. Bhupen Hazarika Samadhi Khetra Memorial”. Hands-on-shoulders, we approached straight. One took out a cigarette, fearing he wouldn’t be able to, after some moments. He, smoking and we, talking; we kept walking. By the silent road, with one or two vehicles passing by, with intermittent breaks of minutes.\n\nScrolling the “Gallery” continues, memories being re-visited. On that day while we were approaching the prime campus through the not-so-busy way, we could spot multiple students on the footpaths on either sides, to and fro. We soon reached the main gate of the university premises. A huge tree extending shade amid the scorching heat. Waiting there for a while, I took a look every-way. Vehicular movements in and out of the campus, dozens of visitors every then and now, small-yet-hungry crowd near the nearby “GU Canteen”, etc.\n\nEntering through the entrance and having a pause near the Gauhati University Campus Map, we proceeded. Students, professors or visitors having snacks at the nearby in-campus stalls, opposite to the office of the Post-Graduate Students Union (PGSU). Keep walking, and you would find the way to the Assam-type office of the Department of Communication and Journalism (DCJ), opposite to the Gopinath Bordoloi RCC-2 Boys’ Hostel. A serene environment; workers working nearby over construction-related projects.\n\nTake a turn, go ahead and you would find the Madhab Bezbaruah RCC-1 Boys’ Hostel. The road ahead of it takes you to yet another composed territory; all inside the huge university campus. Students reading books, chit-chatting, having light snacks, were some of the worth-noticing frames. Everything has a story to tell and everyone towards a dream; yet silently!\n\nContinuation; More, there ahead…\n\nNow, a bottle of water from the Faculty House Canteen. Walking through Manikanta and Sarma Food Court, I got inquisitive to have a glance at some, more that the premises had to offer! Accompanied; “Let’s go to the other side and see what’s in there”, I said to one. With lush green trees on either side, the road led us to the Dr. HK Baruah Regional Botanical Resource Centre which is basically the botanical garden. More of green, greenery…\n\nOur interest had by then shifted to taking a walk around the campus, rather than watch projected films, attending Jonaki, the ongoing film festival. We quickly had an overlook through the Krishnakanta Handiqui Library and interestingly eyed something very contrasting! Vehicles parked at No-Parking areas, while on the other hand, all-clear parking zones…Smiles.\n\nComing out, we approached the Administrative Block and the same parking style there, too! Decorated colourfully, this is where Jonaki was being held. Students forming queue to enter into the PD Hall, where the films were being projected.\n\nAnother similar parking style outside, too! A rickshaw parked just behind the “No Parking” board. Felt this interesting and started to look for more similar practices in this campus. Walking, we got through the Institute of Distance and Open Learning (IDOL), the-there branch of State Bank of India (SBI), the-there Head Post Office, and several other university allotments.\n\nThis for the day: Until next time\n\nWe are on the way to exit. Though not for the first time but very honestly, the campus fascinated us more than the particular film festival; though I wouldn’t want to say that Jonaki was ill-arranged. It is all the majestic open, green surrounding that influences more.\n\nMonkeys all around the Gauhati University Guest House and the same ill parking practice! We almost got out of the huge edu-land while one paused to smoke and after a while, reached Jalukbari major.\n\nHandling the COVID-19 crisis: GU\n\nAll of these that I had come across on that day, is what has just revolved in my mind, after going through the photographs in the gallery of this phone now. Thinking of giving a call to a member of the students’ union and a senior faculty, in the morning and happening accordingly, I just got to know to know that the Mass Communication department of the Gauhati University has in fact set a record to conduct the maximum online classes during this lockdown period covering over 75% of syllabus. I am also let to know that amidst issues, this prestigious university is constant with their efforts.\n\nPersonal perspective!\n\nWith the announcement of the matriculation results under the Secondary Education Board of Assam (SEBA), students would be admitted into Higher Secondary under their respective selected stream, further pushing them to choose a college affiliated to some university to study graduation followed by post-graduation in the state; and this name is likely to pop up first, if he or she chooses to be in Assam.\n\nOver 400 affiliated colleges to this oldest university of the North East. Negatives include the ill-communication strategies between departments and students due to lack of dedicated helplines or the alleged lackadaisical attitude of the concerned authorities or complaints and many more… The environment and the campus leaving a vibe of matureness and sensibility can be counted as a strong-point in the positive angle.\n\nThousands of students passing out every year, this university has and shall remain as a major educational hotspot throughout… Nothing, Something, Everything!"
