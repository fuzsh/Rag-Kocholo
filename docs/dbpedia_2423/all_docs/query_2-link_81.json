        "meta_description": "Population survey plays an important role in understanding the census structure of any species in a particular area. Chiropterans are an important groups of mammals found almost all part of India. Chiropterans (including Mega and Microchiroptera) are important as they have ubiquitous distribution in almost all the states of India, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Gujarat to Arunachal Pradesh. They play important roles in all types of ecosystems. Mega chiropterans largely help in pollination, while microchiropterans help in pest control through insectivory. To understand the population structures, the status of bat population and its trend in Cachar district (Assam) north East India was studied. A total of six species and 97 roosting sites were found over approximately 3786 square kilometer of area. The colony size of Pteropus giganteus was found to consist of 13 to 723 individuals, for Cynopterus sphinx it was 8 to 51 individuals (with group size 3 to 8 individuals), for Eonycteris spelae it was 400-600 individuals, for Pipistrellus coromandra, it was very less, as group size was found to be of 3 to 6 individuals and for Megaderma lyra the number recorded was 5 to 128 individuals. Population structure and the prevalence indicate this zone to be a potential area for maintaining a viable population of bat species. Since no prior systematic information on the Chiropteran population is available from the area, the present study will help in formulating conservation plan of the much neglected group of nocturnal mammals.",

        "text": "The present study has documented six bat species in the Cachar district of southern Assam. The Megachiropteran species found in the study area are Pteropus giganteus, Cynopterus sphinx and Eonycteris spelaea while the microchiropteran species found in the area are Megaderma lyra, Scotophilus kuhlii, and Pipistrellus coromandra. All these species belong to two families and six genera. Among the bat species found in the area, three have been put under schedule V of Indian Wildlfe Protection (Act) 1972. Of these one bat have been categorized as Appendix II species of CITES. As per IUCN list of threatened species, each bat species encountered during this study period have been categorized as least concern species. Morphological features, conservation status and population trend of all the bats that are documented during the study are discussed below.\n\nPteropus giganteus brunnich, 1782 (Indian flying fox)\n\nMorphology\n\nIndian flying fox has reddish-brown fur on its head and possesses long, black and pointed ear.10 The belly is orange in color whereas the colour of the back is deep blackish brown, with a slight mixture of white hairs (Figure 2A). The shape of the head of Pteropus giganteus is similar to a fox, after which it has been named. The blackish patagium allows covering the whole body during rain and also flip on sunny days, thus, it protects the bat from rain as well as in extreme hot condition. The forearm and head-body length of Indian flying fox usually measure 17.2-17.5cm and 21.1-24.3cm respectively. Body weight for males varies from 500-1600gm(Figure 2A-2F).\n\nConservation status\n\nAccording to IUCN (Version 3.1), the Indian flying fox is categorised as least concern species. It has been categorised as the least concern species under the Red list category of IUCN (Version 2011.2) and mentioned that the population of the species is declining in a notable manner due to the destruction of the habitat. CITES recognised it as a species of Appendix II. As per Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, the species falls under Schedule V. However Vendan39 marked the Indian flying fox as the conservation dependent endangered flying mammal in Southern India.\n\nPopulation status\n\nDuring the present study, population of Pteropus giganteus in all roosting sites was estimated which reveals 6370 individuals in the year 2013 while in the year 2014 and 2015 it was estimated to be 5403 and 5033 respectively. Mean population size of P. giganteus in various roosting locations of the study area during 2013-2015 was calculated as 1 44.77±1.72 (mean ± SE, n=44), 122.79±1.79 (mean ± SE, n=44), and 114.38±1.85 (mean ± SE, n=44) (Table 1). Maximum individuals (482) of Pteropus giganteus were observed in Dulalgram in the year 2013 while the minimum was in Hawaithang and Charmail (24). In the year 2014, the maximum number of the individual was recorded in Raninagar (560) and the minimum was recorded in Algapur (12). In the year 2015, the maximum individual counted in Raninagar (723) while the minimum was recorded for Laikon basti (13). During the study period, six roosting locations were spotted where a trend of population increase was observed while rest all sites were observed to maintain the decreasing trend. In the study area, 26 locations were documented where bats used to stay for a long time but later on left the area due to felling of roosting trees. Indian flying fox is a colonial species (Figure 2A) and during the present study the minimum number of P. giganteus in a diurnal roost was recorded as 13 while maximum number was 723 individuals(Figure 3A-3C).\n\nCynopterus sphinx Vahl, 1797 (the greater short-nosed fruit bat)\n\nMorphology\n\nThis species is identified by large ears with a pale and distinct outline. It is a medium size bat having a distinct claw on the first as well as second digit, characterized by the projecting nostril.10The adult male poses orange colour on the either side of the chest, chin, shoulder, thigh, belly and forehead whereas the female has a brown collar with a grey belly40 (Figure 2F). The forearm and head-body length of adult Greater short-nosed fruit bat usually measure 6.4-7.9cm and 7.6-11.3cm respectively. The body weight for males varies from 28.0- 70.0gram and of female from 34.5-53.0gm.41\n\nConservation status\n\nCurrently, the Short-nosed Fruit Bat has been classified 'Least Concern' under the IUCN red list (Version 3.1) category and declared as the species to have an increasing trend of population. As per Wildlife protection (act) 1972, this species falls under scheduled V. However this bat species has not been listed in CITES.\n\nPopulation status\n\nPopulation estimation of Cynopterus sphinx documented 297 individuals in the year 2013, 231 individuals in the year 2014 and 221 individuals in the year 2015. The mean population size of Cynopterus species during the study period was calculated as 27±0.89 (mean ± SE, n=11), 21±0.98 (mean ± SE, n=11) and 20±1.91 (mean ± SE, n=11) (Table 2).\n\nCynopterus sphinx is a foliage living species and maintains a group of 3 to 8 individuals (Figure 2B). During present study a total of 11 palm trees (Borassus flabellifer) were detected with 2-9 groups in each tree having 8-51 individuals. The individuals in highest number were documented among all the roosting site for C. sphinx in the year of 2013 was Kumbhirgram (47) while the minimum was in Kajalbasti (17). In the year 2014, the maximum number of individual was recorded in Arunabandh tea estate (39) and the minimum was recorded in Gumra Khelma Part-IV (8). In the year 2015, the maximum individual counted in Islamabad (51) while the minimum was recorded for Rukni Part-II (9). During the study period, 2 roosting locations were documented having increasing number of individual while the rest were observed maintaining the decreasing rate of the individuals.\n\nEonycteris spelaea Dobson, 1871 (the cave nectar bat)\n\nMorphology\n\nThe eyes of Cave nectar-feeding bat are large and have a long reversible tongue with papillae on it. The ears are simple with no ear border and tragus is absent. Belly is pale in colour and the dorsal pelage is dark brown. Neck of the adult males has a fur collar and is darker than the rest of the body whereas the females bear scrubby hairs rounding their neck. The forearm and head-body length of adult bat usually measure 6-7.9cm and 8.5-12.5cm respectively. The body weight for males varies from 55.0-82.0gram and of female from 35.0-78.0gm (Figure 2D).\n\nConservation status\n\nThe Cave Nectar Bat has been categorized as the least concern species under the Red list category of IUCN (Version 3.1) and it is mentioned that the species has the available population, not declining in a notable manner as compared to the other bat species. As per Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, the species falls under Schedule V. However Bumrungsri et al.42 found the species is decreasing in number in Thailand whereas Mickleburgh et al.43 marked cave tourism and collection the bat for bushmeat as the common threat to the cave nectar bats that belong to Southeast Asia.\n\nPopulation status\n\nThe study also estimates the population of Eonycteris spelaea in the study area which documented maximum in Bororodmukh (600+) and minimum in Sotorodmukh (400+) (Table 3).\n\nPipistrellus coromandra, gray 1838 (the Indian pipistrelle)\n\nMorphology\n\nThe wing membrane of Indian pipistrelle bat is naked and mid to dark brown in colour. The brown ear is triangular in shape while the tip is round. Anterior portion is generally dark-brown in colour ranging from chestnut to clove brown while the posterior surface paler or beige brown.44 The forearm and of adult Pipistrellus coromandra usually measure 2.5-3.4cm while head-body length measure 3.4- 4.9cm respectively.41 The average body weight varies between 3- 6gram (Figure 2B).\n\nConservation status\n\nThe Indian Pipistrelle bat is categorised as the least concern species by IUCN and declared its current population trend as “unknown”. However this species of bat has not been listed in Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 as well as in the CITES appendices.\n\nPopulation status\n\nDuring the study we checked 10 randomly selected villages. In all places the species was available (Table 4). The group size for P. coromandra was recorded as 3 to 5 individuals in the study area. Population estimation of Pipistrellus coromandra was also calculated for the year 2013 which reveals a mean group size of 6.5 (±0.46). The present study documented maximum individuals in Rosekandy (9) and minimum in Katakhal (3). During present study the individuals were observed to stay both in solitary as well as in group. The lowest group size ranged between three to six individuals.\n\nMegaderma lyra geoffroy, 1810 (the greater false vampire bat)\n\nMorphology\n\nThe Greater False Vampire bat can be distinguished by the large and straight nose leaf with a rounded base which is extended up to the above line of the eye. Ear are large, joined and fringed with white hair (Figure 2E). The eyes are small while the face is bearded and a naked snout on it. The Greater false vampire bat poses a large body as compared to most of the insectivorous bats. The belly is whitish in colour while the colour of the body is grayish brown with a paler underside. Body colour of young bat is darker than adults. The forearm and head-body length of adult Greater false vampire bat usually measure 6.5- 7.2cm and 6.5-9.5cm respectively. The body weight varies from 40.0-60.0gram. (Figure 3C)\n\nConservation status\n\nIn view of the widespread distribution of the species the Red list category of IUCN (Version 3.1), has categorized the Greater false vampire bats as the least concern species but the current population trend remains unknown. However, this species of bat has not been listed in Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.\n\nPopulation status\n\nThe roosting locations of Megaderma lyra hold approximately 1073 individuals in the year 2013 which came down to 853 (in 2014) and 543 (in 2015). The mean population size M. lyra was found as 46.65±1.21 (mean ± SE, n=23), 37.08±1.11 (mean ± SE, n=23) and 23.61 ±1.03 (mean ± SE, n=23) (Table 5). Observation on the roosting locations of Megaderma lyra during 2013 revealed that the roosting site (Malugram, Dhalai) provided shelter to maximum (128) number of individuals while minimum (8) number of individuals was recorded in Silcoorie (Dharamkhal). In the year 2014, highest (91) number of individuals was documented in Dhalai (near bridge) and the lowest (5) was recorded in Silcoorie (Dharamkhal). Natun Ramnagar (Site - I : Pritam’s residence) recorded maximum (92) number of individuals while minimum (7) was recorded in Borjalengah Part-I during the year 2015. In the year 2013, the active roost of Megaderma lyra in Cachar was found to be 23 which decreased to 18 (in 2014) and 16 (in 2015). The Greater false vampire bat is a colonial species (Figure 3C) and during the present study the number of individuals in a diurnal roost was ranged from 5 to 128.\n\nScotophilus kuhlii Leach, 1821 (the lesser Asiatic yellow house bat)\n\nMorphology\n\nThe Lesser yellow house bat is a small bat with a long tail which is covered with a membranous structure called inter femoral membrane between the rear legs. They are easily recognized by the brownish coat on the belly and yellowish brown colour on the back.45 The facial structure resembles a dog with a dull muzzle. Ears of the lesser Asiatic yellow house bat are pointy in shape. Forearm and head-body length of adult Scotophilus Kuhlii usually measure 4.7-4.9cm and 5.95-6.22cm respectively.46 The average body weight is about 16gm (Figure 2C).\n\nConservation status\n\nThe Lesser yellow house bat is categorised as the least concern species by IUCN and declared as a stable species. However this species of bat has not been listed in Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 as well as in the CITES appendices.\n\nPopulation status"
