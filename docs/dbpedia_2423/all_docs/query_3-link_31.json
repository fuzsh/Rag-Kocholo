It is realized that rural students, particularly girls have been facing tremendous difficulties and exposure to higher education due to social stigma and backwardness of the district. Keeping in view the scarcity of such educational institutions, Ajmal Foundation has established 17 numbers of Colleges in different backward districts of Assam."
