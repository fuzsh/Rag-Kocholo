The town’s name originates from the Assamese language, where “SIL” signifies “stone” and “SAKOO” refers to “bridge.”\n\nAt the heart of Silsakoo’s historical significance lies an ancient stone bridge, believed to be a masterpiece built by King Rudra Singha during his reign as an Ahom king. This architectural marvel served as a testament to the engineering prowess of the Ahom dynasty and symbolized their ambition.\n\nLegend has it that King Rudra Singha planned to invade Bengal and gathered a formidable force of a lakh (100,000) soldiers from various parts of Assam in Silsakoo. The bridge, a vital infrastructure, likely played a crucial role in facilitating the assembly and movement of troops during that time.\n\nSilsakoo stands as a testament to Assam’s rich cultural heritage and historical significance. The town’s name itself encapsulates the connection between the ancient stone bridge and its Assamese origins. Exploring the town provides a glimpse into the architectural achievements of the past and the intriguing stories of the Ahom dynasty.\n\nAs a town with a notable historical background, Silsakoo serves as a reminder of the region’s heritage and invites visitors to appreciate the convergence of history, culture, and natural beauty that Assam has to offer.\n\nLandmarks in Silsakoo\n\nSilsakoo Picture Gallery\n\nTags\n\nRead Next\n\nYou may also be interested in"
