        "text": "If you're new to battling Giovanni, you will need to complete the Team Go Rocket Special Research quest and unlock the Super Rocket Radar before you can battle them.\n\nOnce you do, and if you beat them, there's a chance that you will be able to catch a Shadow Groudon, easily a top tier Pokémon.\n\nBut to get Team Rocket blasting off again, read on to get the best Giovanni counters in Pokemon Go for August 2024.\n\nMore like this\n\nHow to beat Giovanni in Pokémon Go: August 2024 counters\n\nAs with each of the major Trainer battles in Pokémon Go, your fight with Giovanni will last for three rounds. He always uses the same first and last Pokémon, but there are three options he might choose from in that second stage in the middle.\n\nAs of July 2024, this is what you can expect to go up against, and what Pokémon types you'll want in each round:\n\nFirst round:\n\nPersian (a Normal-type Pokémon, weak against Fighting-type attacks)\n\nSecond round:\n\nNidoking (a Poison and Ground-type Pokémon, weak against Ground, Ice, Psychic and Water-type attacks)\n\nRhyperior (a Ground and Rock-Type Pokémon, weak against Ice, Water, Ground, Fighting, Grass and Steel-type attacks, double weak against Grass and Water-type attacks)\n\nGarchomp (a Dragon and Ground-type Pokémon, weak against Dragon and Fairy-type attacks, double weak against Ice-type attacks)\n\nThird round:\n\nGroudon (a Ground-type Pokémon, weak against Grass, Ice and Water-type attacks)\n\nLooking at those Pokémon listed together, a few patterns emerge which could help you put your battle party together.\n\nA powerful Ice-type Pokémon is a great pick against Giovanni. Pokémon like Regice or Mamoswine are super effective against Nidoking, Rhyperior, Garchomp and Groudon.\n\nFor Groudon and Rhyperior, a Grass-type or Water-type will be the best course of action – think Roserade and Kyogre.\n\nA good Fighting-type like Machamp would be a great pick against Persian and Rhyperior, while also being capable against Garchomp and Groudon.\n\nIt’s worth noting that if Giovanni defeats you once, you can demand a rematch at the same location and he will send out the same team again – which will help you prepare better. See our full thoughts below!\n\nBest Persian counters in Pokémon Go\n\nBeing a Normal-type Pokémon, Persian is very weak against Fighting-type attacks. Any Fighting-type move that you dish out should do 160 per cent extra damage.\n\nWith this in mind, something like Machamp or Lucario would be a strong counter-attack choice! Lucario's Power-Up Punch or Machamp's Cross Chop would both be solid attacks to use against Persian.\n\nOne thing you will not want to use is a Ghost-type Pokémon. Persian has a resistance to these ghoulish creatures, with their attacks doing 39 per cent less damage to Persian. So don't use any of those!\n\nBest Nidoking counters in Pokémon Go\n\nBeing a Poison and Ground-type Pokémon, Nidoking presents something of a challenge, since its dual-typing will eliminate Electric all together, while it is resistant to Fighting, Poison, Rock, Bug and Fairy-Type attacks.\n\nNidoking's weaknesses are Ground, Ice, Psychic and Water-type attacks. Bring a powerful Ice, Water, Psychic or Ground-type Pokémon with you to deal with Giovanni's Nidoking.\n\nWhat do we recommend in terms of counters, then? Blastoise or Mamoswine are both excellent choices, as they can learn powerful Water (Blastoise) and Ice and/or Ground-type attacks (Mamoswine).\n\nBest Rhyperior counters in Pokémon Go\n\nRhyperior is a Ground and Rock-type Pokémon, so is strong against a number of different types. It will be strong against Poison, Rock, Steel, Fire, Electric, Flying and Bug Pokémon, so you're best leaving them out of your team.\n\nIn terms of weaknesses, Rhyperior will be weak against Ice, Water, Ground, Fighting, Grass and Steel Pokémon. So bring something with any of those types along with you and you'll counter Rhyperior well.\n\nPowerful Ice or Water-type Pokémon such as Kyogre, Regice and Blastoise will do well here. Equally, Grass-type Pokémon like Roserade and Venusaur are examples of Grass-type Pokémon that would work as a solid choice, too.\n\nBest Garchomp counters in Pokémon Go\n\nGarchomp is a Ground and Dragon-type Pokémon, so it will be strong against Dragon, Poison, Rock, Steel, Fire and Electric-type Pokémon. We recommend you don't bring along one of those types to fight against Garchomp (other than Dragon).\n\nAs a Dragon and Ground-type Pokémon, Garchomp has a number of weaknesses. It will be weak against Dragon and Fairy-type attacks and double weak against Ice-type attacks.\n\nWith this in mind, a strong Ice-type Pokémon should be a great counter against Garchomp. Again, Regice is a strong pick here, as is Mamoswine.\n\nBest Groudon counters in Pokémon Go\n\nAs a Ground-type Pokémon, Groudon will be powerful against Electric, Fire, Poison, Rock and Steel-type Pokémon. As a Legendary Pokémon, expect Giovanni's Kyogre to pack a surprise move or two.\n\nIt's best to fight against Ground-type with Water, Grass and Ice-type Pokémon and attacks.\n\nWe'd recommend you bring along the likes of Kyogre, Sceptile, Roserade, Mamoswine or any other powerful Grass, Water or Ice-type Pokémon you can think of.\n\nFor the most part, a team made up of Ice, Water and Ground should serve you well taking down Giovanni. Just make sure to heal when needed and focus on special attacks that hone in on the opposition Pokémon's weaknesses.\n\nPokémon Go is available to download on iOS and Android devices.\n\nRead more on Pokémon:\n\nPokémon Go Raids schedule - upcoming battles\n\nBest Pokémon gifts - the greatest merch\n\nBest Pokémon games on Switch - our ranking\n\nBest shiny Pokémon - the coolest creatures\n\nBest Dragon-type Pokémon - who's your fave?\n\nAll cat Pokémon - the felines to catch\n\nPokémon natures guide - all you need to know\n\nPokémon type chart - strengths and weaknesses explained\n\nLegendary Pokémon - the full list\n\nPokémon Scarlet and Violet cheats - handy hacks\n\nPokémon Emerald cheats - what you need to know\n\nPokémon Fire Red cheats - all codes\n\nPokémon Go friend codes - and how to find them\n\nPokémon games in order - where to start"
