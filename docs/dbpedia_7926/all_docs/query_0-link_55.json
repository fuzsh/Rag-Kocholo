        "text": "RD Burman, popularly known as Pancham Da in the film industry left everyone in shock after his death in 1994. The legendary singer and music director passed away when he was just 54, however, even after 25 years of his death, his soothing melodies and soulful tunes continue to inspire and influence musicians and music aficionados in the film industry today. Even though Pancham Da was always inclined towards folk and classical music, he had the ability to present his work in the most contemporary way that even a modern listener can’t stop himself from singing along. This was the magic of RD Burman.\n\nThe melodies that he created make the core of the music industry even today and young music directors like Amit Trivedi, Shankar Ehsaan Loy and others also look up to him for inspiration. Pancham Da’s first big break in Bollywood was the 1966 film Teesri Manzil starring Shammi Kapoor, which had smashing hits like Sona re Sona, O Hasina Zulfo Wali and Aajaa Aajaa. The film not only gave him wings but also soon after the masses saw what a talent he was. Gautam Rajadhyaksha, a renowned photographer and music connoisseur in the 2008 documentary ‘Pancham Unmixed’ revealed, “Since Pancham, there hasn’t been another school of music that has come to invade. There isn’t a new amalgam, for example, a new genesis of a new kind of music like Pancham created way back in the mid-60s.”\n\nRemembering the great Pancham Da on his 25th death anniversary, let’s have a look at these rare and unseen pictures of the music director with Bollywood celebrities like Amitabh Bachchan, Lata Mangeshkar and others.\n\nMore Bollywood stories and picture galleries\n\nFor all latest news and updates, stay tuned to our Facebook page\n\nMore Bollywood stories and picture galleries"
