        "text": "1. How has been the journey so far in Sab TV's Jijaji Chat Par Hai?\n\nThe journey has been very positive and I have learnt a lot. Right from our producer, to director and crew, everyone is enterprising. The atmosphere on the set has been amazing. There are no fights or controversies. We all are focused on giving the best to the show.\n\n2. How good is your comedy timing?\n\nComedy is definitely tough. What I believe is if you understand your character well, comedy timing will come automatically. Regarding my timing of comedy, I feel I am improving and maturing.\n\n3. Who all are your favourite comedians?\n\nI love Adam Sandlerâ€™s comedy. In India, I love director Priyadarshan's films. They are very entertaining. And my all- time favourite is Amitabh Bachchan. His comedy is superb.\n\n4. How is life so far?\n\nI was born in Sagar, Madhya Pradesh but I have stayed in many states of India as my father was in the Indian Army. I have been to Jalandhar, Kolkata, Bangalore, Chandigarh, Pune and Bikaner. I got to see different places and different cultures at quite an early stage of my life. It's been seven years since I am in Mumbai.\n\n5. Define Mumbai in your words.\n\n6. Are you settled in Mumbai?\n\nI have a place to stay and food to eat (smiles). Every person goes through this stage in life. I am sure I will also have my own home soon in Mumbai. I have planted a seed, the tree will come.\n\n6. What are your aspirations as an actor?\n\nI have started my career with commercials and then moved to television. As an actor we all would like to work in films. But for now, I am happy with my television work. Our show is doing well and most importantly I am working in a very comfortable set up. In films, an actor gets a different opportunity to understand your craft, as the time frame is bigger and you get ample time to understand your character. But I am not in a hurry, I will not rush. I have sent the message to universe and now universe will take care of it.\n\n7. Were your parents supportive of your decision to become an actor?\n\nMy father passed away when I was only 13. So, my mother raised me single handedly. She used to take care my needs and emotions. Before I turned an actor, I used to work in a company. So, my decision of quitting the job was a rude shock to my mother. I had to convince her that I wanted to move to Mumbai. I have faced many obstacles. I have been through rejections. My mother knows my journey. Recently, she was on the sets of Jijaji Chaat Par Hai and was very happy to see me working."
