        "text": "Hey everyone! So as I promised, the Part 2 is here. And without any further delay, let’s get started!\n\n3) Pyaar Lafzon Mein Kahan\n\nThis one is actually a Turkish drama which went on to become the most popular drama in Asia. Dubbed in Urdu as well, it was on-air in Pakistan. All the episodes are available on YouTube. Murat Sarsilmaz is a rich businessman and his junior assistant is Hayat Uzun who has forged her identity as Suna Pektas, for the sake of the job else she would have to leave the city. Through a series of pretty romantic twists and turns, they quite organically fall in love with each other and she finds it difficult to confess the truth about her identity to him because he is a truthful guy of high moral values. They still get married and watch to find out more. It’s again a must watch. The chemistry is sizzling given the fact that the leads are extremely good looking (Burak Deniz & Hande Ercel). The boss-employee love blossoming in a workplace is a treat to watch. They get jealous too often and honestly, its kind of cute. Scenes are very well written keeping the *realistic approach* in mind and it’s a nice engaging show, in general.\n\n4) NAVYA…Naye Dhadkan Naye Sawaal\n\nA Shaheer Sheikh starrer alongside Somya Seth; this one is a fresh college love story between the oh-so-cute chocolate boy Anant Bajpai and shy-and-sensible Navya Mishra. There are such beautiful, intimate scenes depicting college romance and the innocent chemistry between the leads will make your heads turn, for sure. The show goes on to be quite boring and the family drama creeps in post their marriage, so if you wish you can discontinue watching right there. The musical track too is fresh and soothing. Give it a try on Disney+Hotstar. I am sure the innocence will\n\n5) Jijaji Chhat Per Hain\n\nThis one’s a rom-com genre show set in Delhi. Elaichi, played by Hiba Nawab is a happy-go-lucky and carefree girl who is the talk of the town for her mischiefs and good looks. She is impressed by the innocent, mild-natured and meek Pancham played by Nikhil Khurana who is the salesman at her father’s lehenga shop. Pancham denies Elaichi’s advances which make her fall for him even more. The episodes are amusing and flirtatious, watching Pancham fall a prey to Elaichi’s pranks everytime until finally marrying her is cute. The chemistry is sweet with Nazm Nazm playing in the background. It’s a pleasing love story. You can watch it on Sony LIV or MX Player and on even SAB TV as they are re-airing the show which ended just before the lockdown began.\n\n6) Yeh Pyaar Nahi To Kya Hai\n\nThis one is a short series of 120 odd episodes available on Sony LIV. Siddhant Sinha and Anushka Reddy are childhood sweethearts. Due to a misunderstanding, she goes abroad for higher studies comes back after a long gap. She finally meets him and the sparks fly again as Siddhant is working at the Reddy’s. Anushka’s paternal multinational company. The regular interactions and sweet conversations rekindle that old love between them and it’s beautiful to watch. Namit Khanna has been a gem of an actor here, the personality, voice, everything has been so intriguing and his chemistry with Palak Jain stole the show. And the title song by Rahul Jain is beyond words! Go hear it!\n\nOkay so that’s it! Hope you’ll start watching your favourite one out of these six recommendations. Also, I have ranked them in the order of my preference. Have fun binge-watching."
