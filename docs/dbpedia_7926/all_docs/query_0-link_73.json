        "text": "Paradhin Aahe Jagati Putra Manavacha\n\nपराधीन आहे जगतीं पुत्र मानवाचा People generally look at Ramayan from a religious point of view. I view Ramayan from a different perspective. Its about human tragedies of epic proportions. Its about the hardships a mature human endures. This song is Ram's way of consoling and counselling his step brother who is angry at the craftiness of his own mother. He seeks forgivenes and asks Ram to return to Ayodhya and and not proceed to 14 years of exile. Every stanza of this long ten stanza song, brings forth a different truth (some may call it philosophy) of life. Like the first says \"None to be blamed, all happens as a result of our past deeds and misdeeds\". Yet another stanza says birth and death are those realities of life that no one can avoid. The next says \"Death is the eternal truth ... all logic stops its door step\". Its about a rightful heir to the throne having to leave the kingdom and make way for his youngest step brother to be the king. This is a force\n\nसंदीप खरेच्या कविता\n\nसंदीप खरेच्या कविता ..... इतके दिवस मी फ़क्त ऐकले होते की संदीप खरेच्या कविता खूप छान असतात. इथे Calgary मधे weekends ला खूप वेळ मिळत असल्याने त्याच्या कवितांना Google केले। This guy writes good stuff. Actually it is Thanks to dear Sachin Kulkarni that I got to hear Sandeep Khare. The first poem that I heard was \"अताशा असे हे मला काय होते \". This is a fantastic piece of retrospection. He has brought about the thoughts of everyone who has thought about his actions of the past. The sight of clouds fighting amongst each other to be the first to drench the earth it clouds our thoughts and finds a way out through the eyes. Absolutely stunning metaphor on the ironies and compulsions of life. Here are some of those that I could. I may have made mistakes in writing the exact words as the convertor that I used was actually an English to Hindi one! Just click on the images to make the poems more readable."
