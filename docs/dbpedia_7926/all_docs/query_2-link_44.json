        "text": "So, there are tons of reality TV shows these days. Reality TV is the new wave of TV, as we all know.\n\nFirst we have game shows. These are like:\n\n-Deal or No Deal\n\n-Wheel of Fortune\n\n-Jeopardy\n\n-Wipeout\n\n-The Contender\n\n-The Shark Tank\n\n-etc.\n\nSecond, we have dating-game shows. Like:\n\n-The Bachelor/ette\n\n-Boy Meets Boy (gay)\n\n-Love in the Wild\n\n-Blind Date\n\n-etc.\n\nThen we get into the fun stuff. Those crazy shows with the drunks and the drama, yah. For example:\n\n-Jersey Shore\n\n-The A-List: New York/Dallas (gay)\n\n-Real Housewives\n\n-Football Wives\n\n-Keeping Up With the Kardashians\n\n-The Real World\n\n-etc.\n\nThen we have game shows that are more extended with a certain cast the entire season, rather than featuring new people each episode. For example:\n\n-Survivor\n\n-The Amazing Race\n\n-America's Next Top Model\n\n-Project Runway\n\n-The Apprentice\n\n-etc.\n\nWe have reality court shows:\n\n-Judge Judy\n\nJudge Joe Brown\n\n-Any show with Judge\n\nMakeover Shows:\n\n-The Biggest Loser\n\n-Extreme Makeover\n\n-Queer Eye\n\n-What Not to Wear\n\n-Pimp my Ride\n\n-etc.\n\nThis is where we can discuss our favorite reality television shows, for instance, my favorite is definitely The A-List: New York/Dallas. They're pretty amazing, my avatar is actually Derek Lloyd Saathoff of The A-List: New York. He's my favorite character of the show. Furthermore, if I missed a show that you like, I apologize, but don't let that discourage you from mentioning it in this thread, we can still discuss it. I probably missed a lot of shows you guys like to watch.\n\nSurprisingly, Shahs of Sunset is really, really funny. I normally don't like watching gay people that are on reality shows, but Reza is quite hilarious.\n\nHonestly, I find the gay people on A-List to be a lot funnier than the bitches who are on Keeping Up With the Kardashians and Jersey Shore. I mean, just guys calling other guys \"girl\" when they see them, I find that so outlandish that it's hilarious.\n\nReality TV shows are terrible, go watch science channel, news, PBS, or scifi on netflicks.\n\nReality television is fun! It's like those crappy Cartoon Network shows, Adventure Time, that everybody likes, only not as bad and not as stupid, arguably, Jersey Shore and Kardashian bitches are just as stupid. I mean, you can't watch reality television whithout being open-minded, just as you can't watch Adventure Time without being open-minded.\n\nthe only good reality show is top chef and the other cooking ones ie chopped\n\nThose are fun, but I definitely like The A-List a lot more. And The Shark Tank is definitely fun, it's different than the others, and The Apprentice is amazing, Donald Trump is everything.\n\ncomparing jersey shore to adventure time is like, what i can't even understand\n\ni miss the tv show NEXT, probably the best/corniest dating show ever created.\n\nas for this thread: NEXT\n\nalso wheel of fortune is my fucking jam, i want to be on that show desperately\n\nAt least you have some input on reality TV shows, unlike ScarfWynaut who's posting just to post. And, I obviously didn't compare the shows, I compared the mindset needed to watch the shows.\n\nReality television is fun!

I mean, you can't watch reality television whithout being open-minded, just as you can't watch Adventure Time without being open-minded.\n\nTake th is\n\nbefore the shit really hits the fan.\n\nOn topic: Top Chef is amazing, as is anything with Gordon Ramsay. I can take or leave everything else.\n\nbecause it's fun. a lot of people get a kick of how scripted it is and just enjoy it for what it is. not everything has to be an impeccable work of art to be enjoyable.\n\ni don't watch a lot of american reality tv except cooking shows. i do watch a lot of UK panel shows which are pretty similar to game shows i guess.\n\nalso everyone being so discerning as to immediately dismiss all reality television - get that snootiness out of here, if it's a thread you're only interested in to put down, then don't post.\n\nbecause it's fun. a lot of people get a kick of how scripted it is and just enjoy it for what it is. not everything has to be an impeccable work of art to be enjoyable.\n\ni don't watch a lot of american reality tv except cooking shows. i do watch a lot of UK panel shows which are pretty similar to game shows i guess.\n\nalso everyone being so discerning as to immediately dismiss all reality television - get that snootiness out of here, if it's a thread you're only interested in to put down, then don't post.\n\nThis is exactly how I feel. If you have nothing to add to the discussion of a particular thread, why are you even posting in it?\n\nEvery summer I love watching Master Chef. Gordon Ramsay certainly is pretty amazing, I have to admit.\n\nAlso,\n\nAdventure Time is a show about ambivalence and nostalgia, in the creator's words it is \"Twin Peaks for Children\". So fuck no, it doesn't have a similar mindset to Reality TV. It's not random shit, it's high art. No, really.\n\nI firmly believe that Adventure Time is a show people watch when they're high. Much like Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is.\n\nAdam you're my 2nd favourite gay but Adventure Time is not something people just randomly watch when they're high. The show means a lot to different people but to me it's a escapism as is all media, it shows the finer points in life, having fun with your friends and making the best out of situations and overcoming things like fears and shit.\n\nAdventure Time is my favourite American show.\n\n#tangents #derailing\n\nReality TV is meh, Pawn Stars is cool but just for the learning of history and cool items you get to see. Other then that i could do without.\n\nI don't smoke at all so, do you watch Adventure Time when high? You may be missing a few things.\n\nI don't think I would ever watch Adventure Time, let alone when I was high. I've tried watching it, but it was just so... I lost several more brain cells than I would have wanted to, we can leave it at that. When I get high, I do other things. Things involving... This is why I shouldn't bring up things I dislike in discussions I create...\n\nNew topic: Is Kim Kardashian a moron, or what? I mean, she gets married, files for divorce, gets pregnant, and the divorce is not even finalized. And then she goes in an interview with her sister and is like \"my sister and I will watch each other's babies and breast feed them! It'll be perfect.\" I find that whole ordeal to be weird. I wouldn't want my sister's tits in my child's mouth, just saying."
