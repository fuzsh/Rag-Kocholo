        "text": "R D Burman gave music for 245 movies and a TV series Subah (1987). R D Burman did playback in eighteen movies composed by him. He was famous for unique, grunting bass singing style. He also acted in the film Bhoot Bungla (1965) and Pyar ka Mausam (1967).\n\n1950s to 1960s\n\nR D Burman started his career as assistant to his father, Sachin Dev Burman. He assisted his father in Chalti ka Naam Gaadi (1958) and Kaagaz ke Phool (1959). His first film as a music director was Guru Dutt's Raaz (1959). However the film was shelved after some shooting and recording of few songs.\n\nR D Burman's first released movie as a music director was Mehmood's Chhote Nawab (1961). Mehmood once said that he gave the movie to R D Burman because he got tired of R D Burman denting his car with the persistent drumming of his fingers! The first song Ghar aaja ghir aaye to be recorded for the movie was sung by Lata Mangeshkar because R D Burman wanted no one but the legendary singer to sing his first composition for movies. The song brought together S D Burman and Lata Mangeshkar who had stopped recording together since 1957.\n\nMehmood gave him his second movie as a music director in 1965 - Bhoot Bangla. The soundtrack is notable for Aao twist karein. In the movie, R D Burman also acted alongside Mehmood. He also composed the music of Teesra Kaun in 1965.\n\nR D Burman's first hit movie was Teesri Manzil (1966). Vijay Anand had arranged a music session for him before Nazir Hussain, the producer of Tesri Manzil. After hearing his music, Nasir Hussain made him the music director of Teesri Manzil. The songs O haseena and Aaja aaja belonged to a genre that Indian music lovers were unaware of. Nasir Hussain went on to sign R D Burman and lyricst Majrooh Sultanpuri for six of his films including Baharon ke Sapne, Pyaar ka Mausam and Yaadon Ki Baarat.\n\nIn 1967, R D Burman gave music for the movies Chandan Ka Palna and Baharon Ke Sapne. Meanwhile, he continued to work as his father's assistant for movies like Jewel Thief (1967) and Talash (1969).\n\nIn 1969, Waris and the musical hit Pyar ka Mausam were released. For Aradhana (1969), R D Burman was credited as associate composer. When S D Burman fell ill during the recording of Aradhana's (1969) music, Pancham completed the music. The film was a turning point in the Bollywood history. It made Rajesh Khanna a superstar; Kishore Kumar replaced Mohammed Rafi as Bollywood's top singer and R D Burman became the industry's most sought-after composer.\n\n1970s\n\nR D Burman was India's most popular composer in 1970s (Bollywood's superstar era), famous for his peppy tunes.

Buddha mil gaya had simple, peppy numbers like Raat kali ek khwab mein aayee and Bhali bhali si ek soorat. It also had a classical song Aayo kahan se Ghanshyam?. Caravan had the best Bollywood cabaret ever - Piya tu ab to aaja, picturized on Helen (Bollywood actress) and sung by Asha Bhosle and R D Burman (\"Monica! O my darling\"). The title song of Hare Krishna Hare Rama sung by Asha became the hip-hop anthem for the youngsters. The song is used in Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories PS2 version titled 'Dum Maro Dum' for Radio Del Mundo in 2006. Other songs like Phoolon ka taaron ka and Kaanchi re were also popular.\n\nIn 1972, R D Burman composed music for nineteen films. Seeta aur Geeta, Rampur ka Lakshman, Mere jeevan sathi, Bombay to Goa, Apna desh and Parichay were musically successful. The high-pitched Asha-R D Burman duet Duniya mein logon ko from Apna desh became popular. Songs like Beeti na beetayi raina from Parichay marked the beginning of a fruitful association between R D Burman and lyricist Gulzar. Also released in 1972 Jawaani diwaani was a hit. Songs like Abhi nahi, Jaan-e-jaan dhoondhta phir raha and the title track were all chart-busters that year.\n\n1973 saw fourteen more R D Burman soundtracks, of which the most successful ones were Yaadon ki baraat, Shareef badmash, Heera panna and Anamika.

He created two hit soundtracks with lyricist Gulshan Bawra and Universal Music India (then called Music India) - Satte pe satta and Yeh vaada raha. Amitabh Bachchan-starrer Satte pe satta was a story of 7 brothers and 7 sisters.

In 1981, R D Burman also composed music for Rocky (Sanjay Dutt's debut movie) and Love story (debut film of Sanjay Dutt's brother-in-law, Kumar Gaurav). The songs from both the movies were popular. However, Rocky bombed on the box office, while Love story was a superhit. Jahan teri yeh nazar hai from Amitabh-starrer Kaalia (1981) also became very popular among listeners.\n\nFourteen more R D Burman soundtracks were released in 1982. The team of Nasir Hussain, R D Burman and Majrooh Sultanpuri (which had started with Teesri manzil presented Zamaane ko dikhaana hai in 1982.

Nayyar hit Preetam aan milo, sung by Sapan Chakravorty.\n\nIn 1983, there were fifteen R D Burman soundtracks, of which Masoom and Agar tum na hote are considered classics.\n\nIn 1984, fourteen R D Burman soundtracks were released. This year, Gulshan Kumar's T-Series made its entry into the arena of original film soundtracks. The company's first major music rights acquisition were for Pramod Chakravorty’s bi-lingual Jagir(Hindi)/Teen Murti(Bengali). The film's music was composed by R D Burman. This year, R D Burman came with somewhat disappointing scores. But he introduced a plethora of talented new singers in these years. Kumar Sanu was given his first break by R D Burman in Yeh desh (1984) as voice of Kamal Hasan. Abhijeet was given his major break by R D Burman in Anand aur Anand (1984). Although he made his debut a long time ago, Hariharan (singer) was first noticed in a duet with Kavita Krishnamoorthy, Hai mubarak aaj ka din (Boxer, 1984), which was composed by R D Burman.\n\nIn 1985, R D Burman had only two music hits among his 12 soundtracks, Sagar and Alag Alag. Mohammed Aziz, a popular Rafi clone of 1980s, made his debut with Shiva Ka Insaaf (1985) under R D Burman.\n\n1986 is said to be the worst year of his career. None of his 9 soundtracks made a mark that year. After 1986, he started getting less work. The producers who gave him patronage suddenly seemed to have disappeared. Bappi Lahiri's lifted Western Disco tunes had taken their toll on R D Burman. The year 1987 saw only 5 releases including the brilliant Ijaazat, which failed to prevent his downfall. Ijaazat is still considered a matchless score, with classics like Choti si kahani se, Khaali haath shaam aayi hi, Katra katra and Mera kuch samaan (which won Asha Bhosle the National Award as Best Singer).\n\n1988 saw some four more R D Burman soundtracks of which Libaas had good songs, but the producer refused to release the film. R D Burman gave music for 6 more movies in 1989, of which Parinda and Joshilaay were successful.\n\n1990s\n\nR D Burman's last years were not very pleasant. The few films he gave music for flopped at the box office. Subhash Ghai promised him Ram Lakhan but gave it instead to Laxmikant Pyarelal. This greatly upset Pancham. He suffered from a heart attack in 1988 and underwent heart surgery. During this period, he composed many tunes, which were never released.\n\nR D Burman gave music for few mediocre movies in 1990 (two), 1991 (three) and 1992 (six). In 1993, there were four more releases, of which 1942: A Love Story (released after his death) has an unforgettable score. The film won him the third and last of his Filmfare awards. The music of Janam Se Pehle (1994) was also composed by R D Burman. After his death, Ghatak: Lethal (1996) was released.\n\n2000s\n\nAfter his death, in the late 1990s, the remix versions of R D Burman's hits ruled the Indian music scene. Even today, most of the Indian remix songs are his tunes remixed."
