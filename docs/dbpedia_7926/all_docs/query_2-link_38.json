        "text": "Flabebe\n\nFlabebe may look like a floating flower, but it's actually a small humanoid Pokemon grasping the stem on the top. It's also a member of the brand new Fairy-type of Pokemon. And that flower? It changes color depending on the color of the flowers you found one in. Adorable.\n\nFloette\n\nWhile it doesn't look all that different from its previous form (honestly, it kind of looks like it just moved its flower), Floette is still an interesting-looking 'mon, especially if you're looking for a new Fairy-type.\n\nFlorges\n\nThe final evolution in this line is the interesting Florges, who decides to stop looking like an ant holding a flower in favor of being an awesome, pollen-covered beast. Well, it still kinda looks like a flower, but at least it has a unique style.\n\nSkiddo\n\nThe pre-evolution of Gogoat, Skiddo is a smaller, cuter version of the grass goat Pokemon. Legend has it that Skiddo here was the first ever species of Pokemon to live alongside humans, which explains it will allow trainers to ride on its back. Also, every time a trainer grabs its horns, Skiddo can read that trainer's feelings. That ability would have been useful in high school.\n\nGogoat\n\nThis Grass-type goat served as the first example of mounts in Pokemon X and Y. For the first time, we'll be able to saddle up on our favorite Pokemon and ride across certain areas of the world. Aside from that, Gogoat is a goat with big horns covered in grass. Oh, and we officially reserve the nickname \"Gadget\" for our Gogoat. \"GOGOAT GADGET, HEADBUTT!\"\n\nPancham\n\nThere have been nearly 700 species of Pokemon throughout its history, and there hasn't been a single black-and-white panda in the bunch. Sure, Spinda is a \"spot panda\" Pokemon, but Pancham here is a honest-to-goodness PANDA. He's a Fighting type too, which means he's a panda that knows kung fu. Better yet, his evolved form looks a little... dark.\n\nPangoro\n\nLevel up a Pancham with a Dark-type Pokemon in your party, get him past level 35, and you get Pangoro--a mean kung fu panda machine. We fully expect to be throwing Shadow Balls and Aura Spheres with this bad boy...although with the name PanGORO we expected four arms, not two. Oh well.\n\nFurfrou\n\nWe've now come to the end of Pokemon as we know it with Furfrou, the Poodle Pokemon with a fur coat that can be modified and decorated like a real poodle. All of those rich Hollywood types with the designer dogs now have a Pokemon to call their own. Not to mention its ability, Fur Coat, cuts all damage from physical attacks in half, so they're going to hang around for awhile. We fully expect every online battle from Hollywood, the Hamptons, and other affluent areas to be all Furfrou, all the time. We'll be ready.\n\nEspurr\n\nPsychic cat with weird ears? Sign us up! Espurr is fairly power at low levels, and has the same creepy, cool vacant expression of Slowpoke--our other favorite crazy-looking Psychic-opath.\n\nMeowstic\n\nMeowstic sounds like the perfect support Pokemon in Double Battles. For one, it learns Miracle Eye, which makes the recipient's next attack a guaranteed hit despite the opponent's Evasion stats AND allows Psychic-type moves to hit Dark-type Pokemon. It's embarrasing how many times we've tried to Psybeam a Dark-type, only to be laughed out of the battle. No more!"
