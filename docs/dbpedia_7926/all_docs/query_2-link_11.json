        "text": "BHPian\n\nJoin Date: Jan 2013\n\nLocation: Jaipur\n\nPosts: 689\n\nThanked: 1,815 Times\n\nre: The TV / Streaming shows thread (no spoilers please)\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by libranof1987\n\nI'm on episode 5 of Fargo Season 3 and I'm having a tough time being awake, during EVERY episode!\n\nI'm surprised you're finding it slow. I just finished the 4th episode and as per me the overall season is pretty gripping and worth watching. Of course, there won't be any worthy replacement to the benchmarks set by Billy Bob Thornton in the first season but still so far so good for me.\n\nThis season too has the reminiscence of the earlier seasons in terms of Minnesota accent and intense characters.\n\nOnly grouse being I should have waited for the entire episodes to finish and watched it in one-go.\n\nOnly 8 episodes aired so far! Two more to go.\n\nLast edited by Sherlocked : 8th June 2017 at 13:57.\n\nDistinguished - BHPian\n\nJoin Date: Apr 2013\n\nLocation: Beans Town\n\nPosts: 1,847\n\nThanked: 8,357 Times\n\nre: The TV / Streaming shows thread (no spoilers please)\n\nFinally decided to check out The Sopranos, I like the classic American shows but never could bring myself to watch this one, I felt it'd be just another stereotyped mafia story with the Italian Americans and their accent and kissing each other on the cheeks and holding hands in respect.. much like the movie The Godfather, which I hated.\n\nI wasn't all wrong, it is stereotyped, the Nu-Jaizee accent, the Italian mob fury and all the hugging and kissing welcome to the family stuff.. I didn't account for one thing though - James Gandolfini. Let me put this in just one sentence, Jim as mob boss Tony Soprano blows the Marlon Brando's deadpan mob boss act not just out of the water but out of the planet and into another solar system. Granted that this is a show and it allowed the portrayals to be stretched and add more layers to it but Gandolfini just runs with it and takes it to all new levels that possibly no actor has ever done in t.v history.\n\nThe supporting cast is equally stellar in their respective roles and add humour, sadness and anger in each episode. Tony Soprano finds himself juggling his own nightmares & panic attacks all the while managing his business, family and his \"extended\" family, sometimes he takes care of them and the other times he \"takes-care\" of them. Its an HBO show so its an automatic adult rating (20+).\n\nSuddenly it dawned on me why this show was rated the number one of all time in American television and still is.. it is not upbeat by any imagination, it dwells in melancholy and delves into the mind of a man who battles with himself, the law, the family and his psychotherapist all the while trying to find meaning in his life where only destruction can be seen in hindsight and foresight. The show is a drug and it grows on you right from the theme song to the end.. 11/10."
