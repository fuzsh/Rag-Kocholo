And who is this radhika?\n\nR..j\n\nwell pancham doesnt have his powers right now...pacham and meera are not together for several reasons...well first her mom...when pacham's mausi found out wht meera did...she didn't like it at all...and other things happened in the show tht made mausi say to meera to stay away from pancham(i totally agree with tht..i hate meera too ðŸ˜¡)...3rd ques...pancham proved it himself tht he is innocent in front of everyoneâ€¦and ranjit and his friends are out of college now....4th ques I don't know which radhika you are talking aboutâ€¦even I have no ideaâ€¦ðŸ˜•\n\nthis is wht i knw as of now...i am in USA...we are behind...cuz i read some updates tht meera has cancer and dadi dies ðŸ˜­...if u read the updates u might understand it better than wht i wrote here..."
