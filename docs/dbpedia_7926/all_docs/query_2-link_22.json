        "text": "While his musical prowess is known to the world, not many know that RD Burman was an actor too. Yes! He acted two Hindi movies. He was also offered the lead role of Bhola in Mehmood’s 1968 film Padosan. Eventually, actor Sunil Dutt was chosen to play the role, as Burman wanted to focus on his music career.\n\nHere are the two films he acted in:\n\n1. BHOOT BANGLA (1965)\n\nRD Burman got his first acting role in the 1965 horror-comedy film Bhoot Bangla. Scripted, produced and directed by comedian Mehmood, Burman played Stocky, a Youth Club member who enters the bhoot bangla in the film with Mehmood. He also made an appearance in the film’s song, Main Bhookha, along with composing the music for the film.\n\n2. Pyaar Ka Mausam (1969)\n\nBurman’s second film as an actor, featured the iconic song Tum Bin Jaoon Kahaan. What made it more special was the fact that it was recorded by two of the biggest singers of the 70s — Mohammed Rafi and Kishore Kumar, who also happened to be arch rivals. Pancham’s role was that of a comic sidekick of Jhatpat Singh, a character played by actor Rajendra Nath. This was an uncredited appearance."
