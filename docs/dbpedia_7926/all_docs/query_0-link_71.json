        "text": "Now that I have a clear view on what characters my audience wants to see make an appearance, I need to do some research on how artists have created, and if possible, animated these animals. As panda got the most votes, I will research panda characters first.\n\nAndy Panda\n\nCreated by Walter Lantz, Andy Panda is a cartoon panda who starred in his own comics and animated series in 1939 to 1951.\n\nAndy Panda's cartoon series ran for 12 years until the studio had a relocation in 1951. The character was pushed aside to allow the company to focus on their new and more popular character, Wood Woodpecker. Although the series was cancelled, characters from the Andy Panda series made a few cameo appearances in the Woody Woodpecker series.\n\nThe appearance of Andy Panda may look familiar to everyone. This is because of the similar design to Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse character.\n\nMy opinion is that Walter Lantz was inspired by Mickey Mouse's design to create Andy Panda, therefore the two characters had similarities.\n\nThe facial shape and features are even similar to Mickey's, especially the large black ears, that mimic's the famous Mickey Mouse head shape. The large gloves, red shorts, and ears are also a huge similarity to Mickey Mouse.\n\nI really like Andy Panda's design, but the longer I look at it, the more unoriginal it looks to me. I have nothing against the design, but I think that it looks too much like it belongs to Walt Disney, and not Walter Lantz.\n\nLeft: Comparison of Walter Lantz's Andy and Miranda Panda, against Walt Disney's Mickey and Minnie Mouse.\n\nWhen watching some animations of Andy Panda via YouTube, I noticed that Andy's movements and expressions were too similar to those from the Looney Tunes cartoons. This made the character seem even more unoriginal.\n\nBelow are some of my favourite cartoons that I found of Andy Panda on YouTube.\n\nPo (Kung Fu Panda)\n\nPo is the main character from DreamWorks' Kung Fu Panda franchise, and made his first appearance in 2008. Po is possibly the most well known panda character ever made.\n\nHis character matches well with the animal's history. China, the home of the giant panda, is well-known for its skill of martial arts named 'Kung Fu'. So creating a character based on China's national animal who is wanting to learn the art of 'Kung Fu' creates a strong bond between the animal, and China's history, therefore making him believable.\n\nPo's physical design is quite accurate to the original animal due to his body proportions. Unlike Andy Panda, Po has a a design that manages to look like the actual animal he is based from, and still keeps the human-like qualities he needs in order to interact like a human would.\n\nThe creators did a brilliant job in adapting the panda's paws to allow Po to use them as hands and feet, without going over the top. I feel that this is one of the factors that allowed Po to become such a fun character to use. Of course not everything can be realistic when designing a character. I don't know much about panda's, but I really doubt that the average panda could move in a way that Po does.\n\nThe designers had to give a littleleeway when designing Po's movements, allowing his limbs to be a little bit more flexible than pandas normally are. Although Po's movements aren't really possible for a real panda to complete, the character still manages to move smoothly when doing the more complicated actions.\n\nIt's not hard to understand why Po is such a successful character. He's believable, entertaining, and overall fun to watch.\n\nI really like how the character came together, and want to create my characters to be just as successful. Looking at Po's character, I understand that I need to think about physical movement and bone structure when creating my own characters.\n\nI should think about how much I want my characters to look like the original animal, and if I want to add some leeway when allowing movement. I want the characters to be able to move like humans do, but I don;t want to go over the top with movement to the point where it's unbelievable.\n\nPancham (Pokemon)\n\nPancham is one of the characters from the Pokemon franchise, designed by Satoshi Tajiri. The character made it's first appearance in the franchise in the anime Pokemon X&Y series in mid December 2013 as the 674th Pokemon.\n\nPancham is the second Pokemon to be based on a panda, but resembles the animal better than the first one based on a panda.\n\nPancham is very loosely based on a panda, but still has enough detail to be recognised as a panda-like character.\n\nThe body structure is very basic and simple, following the chibi style; large head, small body, minimum detail. The style is more like Andy Panda in that the character is built to act like a human. The fur is slightly different to Andy Panda, and Po, as it doesn't follow the black and white patten. Then again, the character is only loosely based on a giant panda, so the differences that appear in the character compared to the original animal is expected.\n\nOverall, I think that Pancham's design is very cute and appealing to all genders and ages.\n\nAs the design isn't very complex, I imagine that the character must be somewhat easy to animate.\n\nLooking at this design, I should really think about how simple I want each character to be, and how far I'm willing to go in detail when creating them. I really have to think about the possibilities when animating, and how far I can go in detail as to how much I want to animate.\n\nPandamon (Digimon)\n\nPandamon is a character from the Digimon franchise, created by Akiyoshi Hongo.\n\nDigimon started off as a virtual pet toy series aimed at a male audience, in competition with Tamagotchi in 1997, and grew to become an anime, manga, and game series.\n\nPandamon's design is quite basic, and his simple facial and body features allows him to look more like a panda teddy bear than an actual panda. I personally think that his toy-like appearance was done on purpose as a link to Digimon's original history.\n\nI really like the torn red neckerchief, as it gives the character a very edgy feel to it, and causes the character to appear strong and independent. The red reminds me of blood, and therefore makes the character seem slightly dangerous.\n\nOverall, I think that the design is good for the series, but I don't think it appeals to all genders as well as the previous three do. Pandamon just looks too violent to appeal to young females.\n\nI should take into consideration about who my audience is and create a set of characters that can appeal to all ages and genders. I should really think about what kind of personality my characters will have, and if they would suit my audience. I don't want to be creating any characters that look like they are ready to go into battle, they need to look friendly and appealing."
