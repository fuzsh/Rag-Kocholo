        "text": "Amit will be portraying the character of Corp. Barabbas Hakeswill in TV film Sharpe's Peril of Sharpe series based on the best selling historical fictional novels written by Bernard Cornwell. The film is by the reputed British-based Celtic Films Entertainment.\n\nBesides Amit, Bollywood actress Nandana Sen is also playing an important character of Maharani Padmini in the series.\n\n\"I received a call from John Howard, one of the world's biggest casting directors, to come for an audition. After four-five auditions I was finally selected for the role from amongst 350 actors worldwide,\" said a jubilant Amit. A qualified engineer and a business management graduate, Amit left his educational degrees aside to pursue a career in acting.\n\n\"I am part of the 15th film, Sharpe's Peril, shot in India where I play the part of the main antagonist who saves Sean Bean in the end. I am the only Indian actor who is also the part of the 16th series which will be shot in Argentina in 2009.\"\n\nThe Sharpe series started in 1993 with Sharpe's Rifle followed by Sharpe's Eagle in the same year. Over a period of 15 years, 14 TV films were made with Sean Bean playing the lead character of Richard Sharpe in every film.\n\nThe Sharpe series of TV movies, which made actors like Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig, tells about the continuing adventures of a British rifleman in the 19th century during the Napoleonic wars. However, not all the novels written by the author have been filmed. There are novels relating to events before and after the films.\n\nSharpe has a viewership of 7.5 million worldwide and is being telecast in channels like BBC America and ITV. Besides the availability of the series in DVDs, the series has also been dubbed in Hindi for viewers in India and is being telecast on the History Channel. Sharpe's Peril will be premiered in October this year.\n\nOn his future plans, Amit said he is planning to have an agent in Britain who will help him in getting projects in the US and British markets. The actor said he would now concentrate more on international projects apart from his present assignments in India.\n\nHe said his priority would now be films as daily television soaps do not give him creative satisfaction. \"Daily soaps are only for making instant money. The actual creative satisfaction lies in the special projects like I am doing now.\"\n\nAmit's present projects in television include Astitva-Ek Pehchaan for DD 1, Chhoona Hai Aasmaan for STAR One and his new show on UTV Bindaas titled Champ, which will be aired shortly.\n\nApart from these serials he has just finished shooting for Chandraprakash Dwivedi's Upanishad Ganga. \"I am playing 18 characters in the serial.\"\n\n\"The final schedule of shoot will be complete by October-November.\" Regarding the channels on which the show will be telecast, he said 4-5 channels including BBC and Discovery have evinced interest, but a decision would be taken by the producer once 52 episodes are ready."
