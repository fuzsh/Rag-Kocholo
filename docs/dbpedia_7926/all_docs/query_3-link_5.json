Half of the Chandni Chowk is infatuated by Elaichi but she considers them unsuitable for her. Rebellious Elaichi has several tricks up her sleeve. She continues to go to school by intentionally flunking each year in eleventh standard but passes in her fifth attempt, to twelfth standard, at the age of 21, to avoid living the grown-up life and dodging marriage. The twist in the tale comes when Murari rents out his rooftop room (barsati) to Pancham, a 24-year-old boy from Agra who aspires to be a music director. Pancham moves to Delhi with his best friend, Pintu, both of whom have limited resources to bank on. To make his ends meet, he ends up working in Murari's shop as an assistant. Since Murari is principally determined to not rent his 'barsati' to bachelors, Pancham fakes about being married and disguises Pintu, as a woman posing as his wife. However, Elaichi figures out what is going on and takes an instant liking of Pancham's mild and innocent behavior. The story goes on from here as Pancham tries to balance his dream of becoming a music director, his work and concealing his wife's 'secret', whereas Elaichi constantly flirts with Pancham and teases him with jokes and pranks, while Murari tries to control his daughter's behavior in the most unsuccessful ways. Elaichi tells Pancham and Pintu that she knows the truth about Pintu and that she loves Pancham. She and Pancham marry with the consent of Elaichi's grandmother, unknown to her father Murari.

He behaves with her the same way he behaved when he came the first time in Season 1. Elaichi tries to make Pancham fall for her again. Among the regular mischiefs of Elaichi, arrives Murari's friend Bansi's daughter Sargam who falls in love with Pancham. She offers him to make him settle in Canada and become a musician there, to which he accepts quickly. When Elaichi realizes the affair between Pancham and Sargam, she makes plans to stop him from going to Canada but isn't successful. Dejected, she goes to a neighborhood temple to commit suicide by hitting her head on the temple bell. When Elaichi's friend Sunita informs this to Pancham, he quickly goes to the temple, trips and gets hurt by the temple bell due to which his memory comes back.
