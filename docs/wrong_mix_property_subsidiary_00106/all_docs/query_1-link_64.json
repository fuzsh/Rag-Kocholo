All rights reserved.\n\nOn June 15, 2001, the City of Los Angeles signed a consent decree with the United States Department of Justice. The consent decree is essentially a settlement agreement that aims to promote police integrity and prevent conduct that deprives persons of rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States. Areas for remediation are identified and expeditious implementation of corrective measures is required. This project is the result of the mandate of one paragraph in the decree that requires an independent examination of police training in the areas of use of force, search and seizure, arrest procedures, community policing, and diversity awareness. RAND conducted this study over a nine-month period (July 1, 2002–March 31, 2003). This study will be of interest to Los Angeles City residents and those in the Los Angeles City government. It also has national application for the field of police training. This project was funded by the City of Los Angeles on behalf of the Los Angeles Police Department.\n\nRAND PUBLIC SAFETY AND JUSTICE This study was conducted within RAND’s Public Safety and Justice unit.

All rights reserved.\n\nThis book summarizes a nine-month study conducted by RAND for the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD, also hereafter referred to as the Department). The City of Los Angeles entered into a consent decree with the U.S. Department of Justice. The objective of this book is to provide analyses and recommendations to assist the LAPD in meeting the requirements outlined in paragraph 133 of this decree, ultimately enabling the LAPD to better serve the interests of the people of Los Angeles through improved training in five critical areas. These areas are use of force, search and seizure, arrest procedures, community policing, and diversity awareness. Early in our investigation, it became apparent that many of the Department’s training problems share a common foundation. Even though the problems encompass many varied topics and training challenges, they are systemic in nature and require a unified approach to change. We recommend that the LAPD clearly and consistently communicate expectations for appropriate LAPD officer behavior. Many officers conduct themselves in a manner that community and Department norms would deem appropriate. Others do not. We suggest that the first essential step to improving police training is to establish and communicate a common foundation for police performance—a redefined professionalism. Police professionalism as described herein refers to a very specific and widely recognized construct. It is distinct from the notion of police professionalism that was prevalent in 1950s and 1960s policing. The police professionalism that we posit instead is Samuel Hunting-\n\nxiii Glenn, Russell, et al. Training the 21st Century Police Officer : Redefining Police Professionalism for the Los Angeles Police\n\nxiv\n\nTraining the 21st Century Police Officer\n\nton’s (1957) far wider ranging three-tiered approach based on the tenets of corporateness, responsibility, and expertise. Not everyone accepts that police can attain professional status. However, many, the authors among them, find evidence to support a more positive perspective. Los Angeles Chief of Police William J. Bratton concurs, plainly stating that he “resents the concept that policing is not a profession.” 1\n\nCopyright © 2003. RAND Corporation, The. All rights reserved.\n\nThe Huntington concept of professionalism provides the basis for communicating the meaning of service as a police officer in the City of Los Angeles. Other organizational and leadership philosophies fit within this concept to include ethics-based, integrity-centric community policing. Competency-based training is also related to these endeavors. Professionalism accepts that personnel cannot be trained for every event, but they must be prepared to handle any eventuality, to think on their feet, and to react with appropriate legal, moral, and ethical behavior. The authors realize that advancing a notion of a redefined professionalism may unsettle some who see the old professional era of policing as a failed model. Nevertheless, we trust that most will understand that what is presented herein is a much needed new start and potentially very effective means of molding a force that will serve the people of Los Angeles well. The governing concept of this new professionalism will provide an important underpinning for correction of weaknesses within the LAPD training realm. One overarching and five primary recommendations form the basis for addressing these shortcomings. Each is complemented by numerous additional and more detailed supporting recommendations. Appendix M provides a consolidated listing of all such recommendations for ease of reference. The following is our overarching recommendation: The Los Angeles Police Department should adopt a concept of police professionalism that incorporates the tenets of corporateness, responsibility, and expertise as the mechanism for guiding the development and execution of its training, to include training ______________ 1 William Bratton, interview with Barbara R. Panitch and Russell W. Glenn, Los Angeles, Calif., February 13, 2003.\n\nGlenn, Russell, et al.

RAND Corporation, The. All rights reserved.\n\nThe five primary recommendations are •\n\nEstablish an LAPD lessons-learned program.\n\n•\n\nIntroduce and maintain consistently high quality throughout every aspect of LAPD training.\n\n•\n\nRestructure the LAPD Training Group to allow the centralization of planning; instructor qualification, evaluation, and learning retention; and more efficient use of resources.\n\n•\n\nIntegrate elements of community-oriented policing (also called “community policing”) and diversity awareness training models throughout LAPD training.\n\n•\n\nDevelop training on use of force, search and seizure, and arrest procedures that meets current standards of excellence.\n\nThis study employed a combination of data collection methods including a review of LAPD and other departments’ written course documents, Department policies, and protocols; observation of instructional sessions; focus groups with police department personnel; interviews with police managers, elected officials, and community members; a case study survey of best practices in the field of policing, both domestic and international; and literature reviews in the areas of adult and police education, policing, use of force, search and seizure, arrest, community policing, and diversity. Though the five primary areas of study were listed as separate entities in the consent decree, they are in practice not discrete areas of training any more than they are discriminate parts of service on the streets. The five subject areas constitute a core set of competencies that an ethical and effective police officer will regularly employ in concert. We address them accordingly within this book. The days of mandating a given number of hours on community policing, use of force, or other topic areas of concern are past. Such artificial “stovepiping,” where naturally intertwined topics are handled separately, runs counter to common sense, policing reality, and effective service to society as the client. The new police professionalism requires a greater training sophistication just as it demands greater sophistica-\n\nGlenn, Russell, et al. Training the 21st Century Police Officer : Redefining Police Professionalism for the Los Angeles Police\n\nxvi\n\nTraining the 21st Century Police Officer\n\ntion of understanding from city government personnel overseeing law enforcement activities, police leaders, and officers on the street.\n\nCopyright © 2003. RAND Corporation, The. All rights reserved.\n\nConducting training founded on police professionalism is of value only if LAPD’s senior leadership stands behind and champions the concept. Department leaders with whom the authors came in contact during the conduct of this study unhesitatingly demonstrated willingness in this regard. There is much reason to believe that a department already proficient in many ways can improve yet further with such leaders at the top and training that promotes the pursuit of professionalism throughout the force.\n\nGlenn, Russell, et al. Training the 21st Century Police Officer : Redefining Police Professionalism for the Los Angeles Police\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nCopyright © 2003. RAND Corporation, The. All rights reserved.\n\nTimely completion of this study would not have been possible without the dedication and hard work contributed by many individuals. Los Angeles Police Department Training Group personnel, including Sergeant Gena Brooks, Director Robin Greene, Caryn McLeod, Captain Sergio Diaz, and Assistant Chief George Gascón, assisted greatly throughout the process. Many other members of the Department contributed through their participation in interviews, focus groups, and by graciously allowing classroom or other training observation. Edmund Edelman, William Geller, Dennis Nowicki, Robert Stewart, and Elizabeth Watson served as a sounding board for findings and, drawing on their many years in police and civil government positions, acted as valuable guides to police culture. Estela Lopez provided excellent insights and entrée for community issues in the relevant areas. Ellen Scrivner and Dina Levy served as peer reviewers for the final report. We thank them for their aid in the quality assurance process. RAND staff critical to the production of this book and other project efforts include Clifford Grammich, Terri Perkins, Christina Pitcher, Louis Ramirez, and Meg Matthius. These individuals have enhanced our work considerably. A special thanks to Deirdre B. Glenn for her assistance in helping to proofread portions of the study. Finally, we wish to thank those members of the City of Los Angeles team who assisted by providing selfless oversight of this project and all, from the City of Los Angeles and elsewhere, who kindly participated in interviews, project meetings, or otherwise assisted in this undertaking for the people of Los Angeles and their police depart-\n\nxvii Glenn, Russell, et al.

We will take that most famous shield, the most famous badge in the world—and whatever little . . . tarnish exists, it will be wiped clean, and it will be the most brilliantly shining badge of any in the United States.\n\nCopyright © 2003. RAND Corporation, The. All rights reserved.\n\nWilliam J. Bratton, upon his appointment to position of Chief of Police of the Los Angeles Police Department, October 28, 2002\n\nHalf a century ago, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD, or “the Department”) and its version of professionalism were models for police agencies worldwide. Law enforcement and the concept of police professionalism have since changed. So, too, via several significant events, has the reputation of the LAPD. The change in the standing of the Department was confirmed by the United States of America v. City of Los Angeles, California, Board of Police Commissioners of the City of Los Angeles, and the Los Angeles Police Department Consent Decree of June 15, 2001 (the “consent decree”). This wide-ranging document mandates the implementation of many changes across the LAPD. Paragraph 133 of that document, that portion of concern to this study, requires that Within 18 months of the effective date of this Agreement the Department shall audit police officer and supervisory officer training, using independent consultants who have substantial experience in\n\n1 Glenn, Russell, et al. Training the 21st Century Police Officer : Redefining Police Professionalism for the Los Angeles Police\n\n2\n\nTraining the 21st Century Police Officer\n\nthe area of police training. The audit shall assess: ways in which LAPD training could be improved (i) to reduce incidents of excessive use of force, false arrests, and illegal searches and seizures and (ii) by making greater use of community-oriented policing training models that take into account factors including paragraph 117(c).\n\nThe factors cited in paragraph 117(c) are cultural diversity, which shall include training on interactions with persons of different races, ethnicities, religious groups, sexual orientations, persons of the opposite sex, and persons with disabilities, and also community policing. 1\n\nSuccinctly, the mandate is to scrutinize Department police training in five areas: use of force, search and seizure, arrest, community policing, and diversity.\n\nCopyright © 2003. RAND Corporation, The. All rights reserved.\n\nNumerous commissions and work groups have examined LAPD training over the last decade.2 Some of the better known include the work of the Christopher Commission and the Rampart Independent Review Board. These many sources have provided several hundred recommendations pertinent to LAPD training. Many are unique. Some are contradictory. Others are repetitive. Still others are no longer needed or valid. Our book is therefore merely the latest of numerous evaluations of Department training, all of which have similarly sought to improve the education provided to Los Angeles police. Many of our observations are very similar to those raised previously by the Christopher, Rampart, and other undertakings.3 It is likely that any further efforts will yield similar results until identified shortcomings are remedied. We took two deliberate steps in an effort to make our contribution as valuable and pertinent as possible. First, we deliberately chose not to review in-depth the conclusions of other studies until after developing our own findings and recommendations. Second, because ______________ 1The consent decree, 2001, pp. 55, 61. 2Robin Greene, Director of Police Training, LAPD, interview by Barbara R.

Training the 21st Century Police Officer : Redefining Police Professionalism for the Los Angeles Police\n\nBackground and Methodology\n\n3\n\nmany LAPD problems are systemic in nature and require solutions at a fundamental level, we identify the most common shortfalls, explain their character, and provide a single unifying concept that the LAPD should incorporate in addressing them. That theme is professionalism. This concept provides a way of taking many seemingly separate issues and linking them in a logically comprehensible whole.\n\nSETTING THE CONTEXT\n\nCopyright © 2003. RAND Corporation, The. All rights reserved.\n\nThe training problems facing the LAPD are not entirely unique. National case studies indicate that other law enforcement agencies regularly wrestle with the same or similar issues. It is also important to acknowledge the concerted and genuine efforts of many members of the LAPD, city government, and citizens of Los Angeles to improve their police agency. Many have the will to improve. It is necessary to identify and pursue the best way to do so. Los Angeles benefits from a heterogeneous and dynamic character that adds vibrancy to its economic and cultural life. It also explains why the city confronts many issues previously seen only internationally and why Los Angeles experiences many law enforcement challenges before the rest of the country does. The unique character of the city gives the LAPD the opportunity, and responsibility, to be a leader in policing and to develop ethical, legal, and innovative responses to these emerging needs. It also puts it in a position to establish examples for other major domestic and international departments. As a world class city, Los Angeles can also benefit by learning lessons from others. Fifty years ago, many people thought that the LAPD could solve all of its problems from within. Today the Department must understand that it has as much to learn from outside as it has to offer. Our findings and recommendations draw on innovations and lessons learned elsewhere, both from inside and outside the law enforcement community.\n\nTHE FOUNDATION’S CORNERSTONE: A COHERENT APPROACH TO IMPROVEMENT The Los Angeles Police Department Training Group labors under a myriad of proposals and recommendations, now including those that will follow here. It is critical that an organizing principle and\n\nGlenn, Russell, et al. Training the 21st Century Police Officer : Redefining Police Professionalism for the Los Angeles Police\n\n4\n\nTraining the 21st Century Police Officer\n\nleadership vision guide implementation in order to introduce coherency and consistency in training messages. We found this organizing principle heretofore lacking. Initial classroom observations indicated an absence of a unifying theme for officer development. Focus group sessions with probationers, field training officers, and other personnel corroborated this finding. Finally, individual interviews pointed to a struggle in developing a consistent leadership vision for Department officers (partly, and understandably, due to administration changes). That the LAPD does not successfully communicate a unified message creates a dangerous vacuum that individual officers fill with their own interpretations of proper behavior. While the consent decree itself acknowledges that the great majority of officers conduct themselves in a manner that community and Department norms would deem appropriate, some officers do not. The consent decree recognizes the need for the LAPD to better instill integrity throughout the department. A clearly, consistently articulated unifying professional ethic will help considerably in meeting these aims. Chapter Two provides an overview of modern police professionalism. This concept has three fundamental tenets. Chapters Three, Four, and Five provide analyses of the tenets’ application to LAPD training in the areas of use of force, search and seizure, arrest procedures, community policing, and diversity awareness.\n\nCopyright © 2003. RAND Corporation, The. All rights reserved.\n\nChapter Two: Law Enforcement Professionalism and the LAPD The concept of police professionalism evolved throughout the twentieth century. In its earlier years, policing was based on a “political model” in which officers were assigned to neighborhoods and grew intimately familiar with their “beats.” Decisions about police services for a community were made by political bosses.4 Policing during this period was characterized by overwhelming political influence and, too often, corruption. The subsequent so-called “professional” era of policing was a direct response to this political control and manipulation of city law enforcement agencies. Reforms included outfitting police officers in ______________ 4Seattle Police Department, 1996.\n\nGlenn, Russell, et al. Training the 21st Century Police Officer : Redefining Police Professionalism for the Los Angeles Police\n\nBackground and Methodology\n\n5\n\nreadily identifiable uniforms. Departments took advantage of the increased availability of cars and assigned more officers to vehicle patrol, in part because they were thereby easier to supervise. Standards of conduct were instituted, including the International Association of Chiefs of Police Law Enforcement Code of Ethics that was considered one of the greatest accomplishments of that era.5 The code specified a standard for ethical and legal police conduct. Paramilitary command and control structures became prevalent. Officers were educated to do as they were told and not question authority.\n\nCopyright © 2003. RAND Corporation, The. All rights reserved.\n\nPolice analyst George Kelling believes it is more appropriate to characterize this period as one of “reform” rather than professional policing.6 It created many new problems even as it addressed many of those from the political era. Critics claim that the reform model created professionally remote, internally oriented, legalistic, formalized, and rigid police departments in the efforts to prove integrity and efficiency. The Los Angeles Police Department became the epitome of this “professional” model, its officers emblematic of the police experts who demanded “just the facts.” The civil unrest of the late 1960s accented these shortcomings in the reform model. Police in the political era had often been too involved with community politics. Now they were frequently too removed from the society they were to serve. Departments did not reflect the racial mix of the communities they served. Police might have been technically proficient but they too often lacked requisite communications skills. Officers often had problems communicating effectively with the diverse elements of American society.7 Efforts at reform gradually shifted to community policing approaches. The basic strategy was one of partnership with those served and included goals of identifying and solving problems mutually recognized as important. It is the spirit of August Vollmer’s professionalism (see Kelling and Coles, 1996, p. 75) that underlies this shift and the concept of profes______________ 5Ibid. 6Kelling and Coles, 1996, p. 75. 7Fyfe et al., 1997, p. 16. This dichotomy of competence continues to affect policing today.\n\nGlenn, Russell, et al. Training the 21st Century Police Officer : Redefining Police Professionalism for the Los Angeles Police\n\n6\n\nTraining the 21st Century Police Officer\n\nsionalism as it is presented in the pages that follow. His tenets of serving a higher purpose, rigorous education for officers, broad police discretion, and collegial control are similar to the universal concept of professionalism described by Samuel Huntington and recognized in many vocations.\n\nChapter Three: Corporateness Corporateness is the first considered of the three components that define professionalism. Corporateness involves instilling an understanding of professional duty and building a minimum level of expertise in an individual before he is admitted to the profession. It thereafter demands collectively maintaining established standards of performance. Implementation of the concepts underlying corporateness takes many forms. In Chapter Three, we focus on three critical aspects of training necessary to instilling and maintaining a sense of corporateness: (1) using lessons learned for sustaining expertise, (2) creating and maintaining quality instruction, and (3) developing structures and procedures to obtain the maximum potential from police training.\n\nCopyright © 2003. RAND Corporation, The. All rights reserved.\n\nChapter Four: The Police Responsibility to CommunityOriented Policing in a Diverse Society Responsibility is the next tenet of professionalism receiving attention. It requires that the officer have an understanding of duty that is greater than service to oneself. The client of every profession is society. The police officer performs a service for the greater good much as doctors sustain public health, lawyers defend individual rights, and military personnel protect their citizenry. Such service to society implies that the professional police officer understands the social context in which he works. Today this notion of service requires a community policing approach that recognizes social diversity. Every modern metropolitan area is a palette of rich demographic differences. The concepts underlying community policing and diversity awareness must therefore pervade the entire organization, including its training functions. This chapter details the need to integrate elements of community-oriented policing and diversity awareness models throughout training.\n\nGlenn, Russell, et al. Training the 21st Century Police Officer : Redefining Police Professionalism for the Los Angeles Police\n\nBackground and Methodology\n\n7\n\nWhile corporateness addresses organizational systems and procedures that must support officer training, responsibility speaks more to the policing philosophy that a department chooses to advance. The systems of corporateness act to establish and maintain the philosophy of responsibility. Both systems and philosophy rely on the unique expertise that police officers provide to their clients.\n\nChapter Five: Developing Police Expertise\n\nCopyright © 2003. RAND Corporation, The. All rights reserved.\n\nExpertise constitutes the third pillar of professionalism considered. Training develops and constantly hones the unique skills of a profession. While the LAPD Training Group is primarily responsible for formally developing the skills and expertise of Los Angeles officers, every leader and officer must unceasingly work to better himself and his colleagues as public servants. Department training in turn should not only help recruits become officers, but also constantly educate police at every echelon beyond their graduation from the academy. As noted, we reviewed LAPD training in five subject areas: use of force, search and seizure, arrest procedures, community policing, and diversity awareness. We quickly realized that to fulfill the intent of the consent decree we could not treat these as separate entities. Nor can training treat them as independent, as they are inextricably interconnected parts of service on the streets. The five subject areas constitute a core set of skills that an ethical and effective police officer will regularly employ in combination. Our overriding recommendation in this area is that the LAPD training curriculum be integrated in a way that allows officers to realistically practice using all relevant skills and knowledge needed for effective police work, thus meeting current standards of excellence. Training in these areas cannot be effective if it simply entails a given number of stand-alone hours covering each of the five areas. Expertise in these five areas demands more than physical adeptness. The professional officer is proficient in both technical skills (e.g., weapons proficiency, physical arrest procedures, and other topics frequently labeled as “tactical”) and communication skills. The LAPD has a long history of excellence in technical proficiency, but our analysis indicates that most officers need more training in interpersonal and verbal communication skills than they currently re-\n\nGlenn, Russell, et al. Training the 21st Century Police Officer : Redefining Police Professionalism for the Los Angeles Police\n\n8\n\nTraining the 21st Century Police Officer\n\nceive. During interviews with Mayor James K. Hahn, Los Angeles City Council Public Safety Chair Cindy Miscikowski, members of the police commission, and community representatives, we repeatedly heard expressions of strong interest in greater interpersonal skills training for officers, especially those skills essential for deescalating conflicts. Effective communication is no less a vital “tactical” skill than are those related to weapons employment, expert driving, or other “hard” technical abilities. Good police officers are as skilled in communications as they are in “physical tactics.” Police are frequently in the business of convincing people to do what they otherwise would not be inclined to do.8 Officers must be adept at addressing all those in the “communication continuum,” individuals ranging from those with whom they must work to resolve immediate issues to representatives of the mass media who will report or interpret their actions.\n\nCopyright © 2003.

The project team included RAND researchers, a community outreach consultant, and an expert panel of five police practitioners (see Appendix A). The RAND team contributed expertise in research design and the fields of law enforcement, education and training, operations research, sociology, psychology, and organizational behavior. The community outreach consultant added significant local knowledge regarding the history of police-community relations in Los Angeles and provided contacts with important community leaders and elected officials. The expert panel shared from their extensive experience in policing throughout the process. The panelists participated in problem analysis, debated alternative solutions to training problems, and reviewed project materials. The research team used a variety of methods to collect data for this effort. Most of the analysis was based on qualitative data, which was gathered from the following sources: ______________ 8Ibid.\n\nGlenn, Russell, et al.

Our examination included police training, law enforcement operations, legal and community standards, and the specific mandates of the consent decree. There was no single applicable overarching theory. Thus, we engaged in theory building through our data collection and analytical efforts. Theory building is an iterative process: Gather data, examine data, develop a theory that appears to fit the data, and then validate and refine the theory through further data gathering and analysis. In this process, data collection and analysis are interwoven procedures. 1 0 Field testing of the recommendations made herein was not possible given study time constraints. The activities inherent in the analysis that underlies this study were as follows.\n\nLiterature Reviews The research team reviewed academic and practitioner literature in the areas of adult and police education, policing, use of force, search ______________ 9Eisenhardt, 1989, p. 532. 10Strauss and Corbin, 1990, p. 280.\n\nGlenn, Russell, et al. Training the 21st Century Police Officer : Redefining Police Professionalism for the Los Angeles Police\n\n10\n\nTraining the 21st Century Police Officer\n\nand seizure, arrest procedures, community policing, and diversity awareness. Results from the literature reviews informed the development of the curriculum assessment instrument (Appendix B), and laid an important foundation for understanding the data collected at the LAPD. Together with the case studies, the literature reviews established that valuable material in specific subject areas exists, but that there are two fundamental gaps in the knowledge base of the field. One is the failure to meaningfully measure outcomes from police training. It is behavioral outcomes—actions of officers in the field—that are ultimately of interest to police educators. Yet work in this area is in its early stages. It cannot be said with certainty what kind of training works best for police. We are instead required to extrapolate from more general educational sources as well as to gather knowledge from related disciplines, such as the military.\n\nCopyright © 2003. RAND Corporation, The. All rights reserved.\n\nCase Studies The second fundamental gap in knowledge in the field was highlighted by both literature reviews and case studies. These two tools were used to survey the state of the art in policing. Sources indicated that breaking the study’s topic areas into isolated parts is unsatisfactory. There is excellent writing on specific subject areas, for example in the area of use of force. Generally speaking, however, each topic is handled discretely and is not tied to other topics and, further, not tied to training. There are some exceptions, but the comprehensive attempt that this study represents is among the first of its kind. Yet respondents in the case study interviews made clear the integrated nature of the research areas and demonstrated how the relevant issues are interwoven throughout police operations. For instance, when discussing use-of-force training, sources inevitably moved to discussion of review boards, risk management, and public perception, indicating that it is artificial to speak strictly of training. We were left in the gap between segmented literature and the reality of police operations, which is that all these issues are at play all the time. To continue in a segmented fashion, making audit-type recommendations, seemed to us to add only marginal value and perhaps even detract from the reform efforts of the Department, tying it to soon-to-be-obsolete and ill-fitting mandates.\n\nGlenn, Russell, et al. Training the 21st Century Police Officer : Redefining Police Professionalism for the Los Angeles Police\n\nBackground and Methodology\n\n11\n\nInstead, this paradox of overly discrete versus overly holistic approaches seemed to demand an organizing principle. An organizing principle speaks not to a goal (for instance of crime control), it speaks to how that goal will be achieved. It provides operating rules. Small, seemingly insignificant decisions can be as readily guided by the principle as macro-level, comprehensive-change initiatives are. It distills the essence of not what a police officer is, but who he is, both as part of the organization and on an individual level, thereby allowing for coherent decisionmaking in any range of situations. To identify the initial list of case study agencies, we used literature reviews, personal knowledge of researchers, and recommendations by the expert panel members. Police agencies in 20 jurisdictions were evaluated for the applicability of their experiences to the challenges confronting the LAPD. The thirteen sites ultimately selected for in-depth review were metropolitan areas with particularly relevant lessons for use of force, search and seizure, arrest procedures, community policing, and diversity awareness (see Appendix J).\n\nCopyright © 2003. RAND Corporation, The. All rights reserved.\n\nWritten Curriculum Review and Classroom Observation Simultaneous to the early work of the literature reviews and case study interviews, we began our foray into the classrooms and written materials of the LAPD. What we saw quickly corroborated our preliminary sense of a missing piece. Individual instructors and individual courses carefully described specific, technical matters. Yet, confusion in classroom discussions was evident. Students were having difficulty understanding how each segment related to another, much less how to apply them to a real-life situation. Fortunately, this was not true across the board. Some curricula and instructors deliberately interwove material and demanded synthesis and judgments from students. Yet, in general, there were important gaps between classroom learning and application in the field and transfer of skills across subject areas. Adding to this issue, many instructors discussed their own philosophy or experiences rather than offering guides by which an LAPD officer should make a decision (e.g., “LAPD officers are public servants” or “the LAPD leadership does not feel that the ends justify the means”—how would these values guide daily work?). Some form of ethos was certainly being transmitted, but it often varied among\n\nGlenn, Russell, et al. Training the 21st Century Police Officer : Redefining Police Professionalism for the Los Angeles Police\n\n12\n\nTraining the 21st Century Police Officer\n\ninstructors and courses. These inconsistencies seemed to support a culture of individual decisionmaking, a culture that could, at its crudest level, pose a liability problem for the Department.\n\nCopyright © 2003. RAND Corporation, The. All rights reserved.\n\nThe corroborated findings from these various sources gave rise to the overarching recommendation: The LAPD should adopt a new concept of professionalism in order to •\n\nprovide a construct that lends coherency to its training\n\n•\n\nestablish a basis for police officer standards of performance and conduct.\n\nThe classroom observations and written curriculum review provided a rich source of data for more specific recommendations as well. Our review of LAPD written materials included recruit academy courses in the five areas of interest as well as those covering the topics of ethics, professionalism, and LAPD history (see Appendixes E and F). Reviews of material pertaining to continuing education training (also called in-service training) again included the five areas noted in the consent decree, as did our reviews of the Continuing Education Delivery Plan (CEDP), values, ethics, supervision, instructor development, and field training. Examination of roll-call training also focused on the five consent decree areas. Finally, the research team reviewed the LAPD manual, Department policies, management papers, training bulletins, and various review board reports and findings for relevant insights. Written material and classroom observation data were entered into an Access database for purposes of analysis of summary statistics. Classroom observations were a critical source of data. We observed 50 percent of the courses for which we conducted written material reviews. The classes observed were selected based on relevance to the topics of consent decree interest and “snowball sampling” (i.e., questions and insights from initial observations precipitated reviews of additional courses). Together this entailed observations of 25 courses at an average observation length of more than two hours per class. Here again the assessment instrument was used to examine courses, and data were entered into the Access database. Table 1.1 summarizes classroom observations as a percentage of the written materials reviewed in each primary category.\n\nGlenn, Russell, et al.

NOTES: Twenty-five courses were observed. The average observation length was over two hours, adding up to more than 50 hours of classroom observation.\n\nCopyright © 2003. RAND Corporation, The. All rights reserved.\n\nThe computer database allowed us to tally summary statistics about such items as types of teaching techniques used in a course. However, most of our data was qualitative, that is, things that cannot be counted. We therefore supplemented the brief statistical analysis with the in-depth process of theory building described above. We laid the groundwork for the theory building through an intermediary analysis of our course reviews, both written and observed. Appendix L summarizes major findings from this portion of our work. It is derived from the categories of inquiry in the assessment instrument. The categories common across topic areas included •\n\nstated class objectives\n\n•\n\ninstructional style\n\n•\n\nlearning setting\n\n•\n\nwritten curriculum quality\n\n•\n\nadequacy of resources.\n\nThe reviews and observations further investigated the following specific elements of course content •\n\nperformance expectations\n\n•\n\nindividual accountability/responsibility\n\n•\n\nintegration of Department values/context/policies/mandates\n\nGlenn, Russell, et al.

RAND Corporation, The.

We stratified these groups by function and rank. The facilitators worked from customized scripts that were adapted from the individual interview instrument. (See Appendix D.) We paired a note taker with a facilitator in each session and attempted to safeguard participants by assuring them that comments made in the session would not be attributed to individuals, but only to groups. It is important to introduce a caveat for our focus group findings. First, the focus group sample was small in comparison to the size of the Department. Second, it was not selected randomly, as a result of causes beyond the researchers’ control. We therefore cannot legitimately generalize findings from this group to the broader population of officers. We instead limited ourselves to drawing reasonable inferences and insights. ______________ 11 Unpublished RAND research by Margaret C.

Each group focused on a different aspect of the training process (see Table 1.2): •\n\nTraining coordinators discussed in-service instruction and the tension between demands for centralized and decentralized training.\n\n•\n\nSenior lead officers described community policing training and its implementation within the Department.\n\n•\n\nTraining group sergeants and lieutenants provided insights on the adequacy and effectiveness of current training methods, curriculum development, and instructor delivery.\n\n•\n\nProbationers (officers with less than one year since academy graduation) described their perceptions of classroom and field training, effectiveness of instructors, and their level of preparation upon leaving the academy.\n\n•\n\nField training officers (FTOs) also discussed the distinctions between classroom and field training, levels of effectiveness among FTOs, and FTO training needs.\n\nCopyright © 2003.

We conducted 25 of these interviews throughout the fall of 2002. The interviews were semi-structured. That is, we had an interview guide that was adapted to suit each situation. Conversations were not limited to the questions listed in Appendix D. The guide was pilot tested for interrater reliability (to determine whether interviewers asked questions in a consistent manner). Individuals who desired confidentiality were assured it. Interviewees were selected for their expert knowledge and opinion. Individuals were identified by the research team, and none of the interviews was mandatory.

Additionally, throughout our work, in interviews, focus groups, and classroom observation, the research team made an effort to include individuals of diverse backgrounds. Interview and focus group data were both analyzed. Interviews, used predominantly for background information, were summarized. Focus groups, used for data gathering, were informally coded to identify major themes and areas of convergence or discord.\n\nRecommendations\n\nCopyright © 2003. RAND Corporation, The. All rights reserved.\n\nAs described above, theory building is an iterative process. In this study, RAND was able to complete all the steps of theory building except for the testing of the model. This is an important step, and its omission is not insignificant. As researchers, we hope for the opportunity to complete the process. However, we necessarily limited our inquiry because of external constraints. We are also assured that the models we used are based on theories grounded in the training and education fields. This process of analysis led to identification of findings and recommendations. Above, we addressed the genesis of the overarching theme of a redefined professionalism. We similarly derived the primary recommendations (as well as the supporting recommendations) from shortfalls identified during our data collection and analysis. At least three data sources pointed to each of the primary recommendations. Generally, the expertise that team members brought to the project together with all data sources established each piece of evidence. A brief note on each of the five primary recommendations follows. (See Appendix M for a complete list of our primary and supporting recommendations.)\n\nEstablish an LAPD Lessons-Learned Program This recommendation derives from heterogeneous sources within and outside of the LAPD. Many businesses today have learned the value of becoming learning organizations and of developing strong\n\nGlenn, Russell, et al. Training the 21st Century Police Officer : Redefining Police Professionalism for the Los Angeles Police\n\nBackground and Methodology\n\n19\n\nknowledge management capabilities.12 LAPD officials note that structural and cultural divisions among various units of the Department sometimes prevent the timely flow of information from the field to training and the reverse. Further, risk management and liability concerns support the need for a concrete effort to learn from previous actions.\n\nIntroduce and Maintain Consistently High Quality Throughout Every Aspect of LAPD Training This finding addresses curriculum development, instructor quality, and assessment of learning. While the LAPD has undertaken training reform and has instituted some quality control initiatives, inconsistency of quality across curricula and instructors remains. The data that lead to this conclusion include classroom observation, document review, interviews with police personnel, and focus group responses.\n\nCopyright © 2003. RAND Corporation, The. All rights reserved.\n\nEach reviewer of curriculum and observer of class sessions noted the inconsistency of training in his field notes. While there are individual examples of excellence, the inconsistencies were discovered across recruit, in-service, and management training, as well as across subject areas, indicating a need for improved overall quality control. Finally, this finding was also identified more than ten years ago in the Christopher Commission report. The LAPD continues to attempt to sufficiently revise its training protocols.\n\nRestructure the LAPD Training Group to Allow the Centralization of Planning; Instructor Qualification, Evaluation, and Learning Retention; and More Efficient Use of Resources This finding arose predominantly through identification by mid- and senior-level leadership in the LAPD. RAND was asked to suggest ways in which the training group might reorganize its functions so as to work more effectively.

Specifically, the division between recruit and in-service training functions, the unclear role and chain of command of training coordinators, and the manner in which roll-call curriculum was developed and delivered were all major points noted by interview respondents as well as researcher observation.\n\nIntegrate Elements of Community-Oriented Policing and Diversity Awareness Training Models Throughout LAPD Training The isolated, segregated nature of community policing training was apparent from every data source. Elected officials and community members expressed desires to see more meaningful community engagement and partnership. Meanwhile, many Department personnel struggled to define what community policing is, much less to provide examples of how it is implemented. Case studies and literature reviews underlined that community policing is a departmentwide endeavor. It is not a discrete task during the activity of policing and, therefore, cannot be handled as a discrete part of training.\n\nCopyright © 2003. RAND Corporation, The.

Some courses in these areas follow best practices in learning principles and some do not. Current training in these areas ranges from high quality to that needing substantial improvement, as understood by training experts, students of the courses, and community members and elected officials who see the translation to behavior in the field. While we did not measure student outcomes (how much officers learned and how they applied that learning in the field), classroom observations and focus group/interview responses indicated that students were not grasping the underlying principles of use of force, search and seizure, and arrest policies, or the interrelatedness of these three topic areas together and with community policing and diversity awareness.\n\nGlenn, Russell, et al.

All rights reserved.\n\nThe authors ask readers to note the following four issues: •\n\nGender pronouns. We have chosen to use the male pronoun to avoid complicated and grammatically incorrect alternatives to gender specificity. We encourage the reader to see these notations as inclusive of individuals of both sexes, whether among LAPD officers or Los Angeles community members. The use of the male pronoun is not intended to imply that policing is a male profession.\n\n•\n\nPolicing/law enforcement. We understand that “policing” and “law enforcement” are not synonyms. We are keenly aware that the work of police officers is greater than simply enforcing the law. We have nonetheless chosen to use the terms interchangeably to avoid bludgeoning readers with overuse of either term.\n\n•\n\nTraining/education. We also acknowledge that “training” and “education” are not synonymous. Some in the field of professional development feel that the term “training” is limiting and is perhaps not appropriate when applied to human development. Others counter that training is more encompassing and involves greater internalization than does the concept of “education.” The term “training” is substantially used in police work and is a well understood and accepted term. Good training includes education; education of police officers includes training. We use these terms interchangeably.\n\n•\n\nAccess. Finally, we make an administrative note: Throughout all of our data collection efforts, LAPD personnel provided complete access to individuals, groups, classrooms, and precincts. We experienced no resistance to our requests.\n\nGlenn, Russell, et al. Training the 21st Century Police Officer : Redefining Police Professionalism for the Los Angeles Police\n\nCopyright © 2003.

All rights reserved.\n\nTHE LUSTER IN THE BADGE: LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALISM AND THE LAPD\n\nAt first glance, it might seem that there is little to logically link police instruction on use of force, search and seizure, arrest procedures, community policing, and diversity awareness. Why, for example, should an academy integrate community-policing concerns with instruction regarding basic arrest techniques? How does it serve the police department or the public to consider demographic characteristics when teaching use-of-force procedures? Does providing equal service to all mean that identical procedures have to be employed for every search, regardless of a person’s gender, religion, race, ability to communicate, or handicaps? The answers to these and similar questions are found in the following discussion of a revised concept of law enforcement professionalism, which is used in the remainder of this study. “Professionalism” as introduced in this chapter inherently incorporates many concepts already familiar to dedicated police officers. The guidelines provided by the LAPD’s core values and management principles (see Appendixes E and F) are an example—they rest on the same moral foundation that underlies any profession. A police department that looks to ethics and integrity as touchstones for judgment and service inherently shares elements of a professional approach. We have chosen professionalism as the underpinning for this study because it encompasses and synthesizes all the good elements that these other factors include. In addition, policing is only one of many vocations that can qualify as a profession. Law enforcement personnel also share important characteristics with these other entities while being in their own sense unique. The construct\n\n23 Glenn, Russell, et al. Training the 21st Century Police Officer : Redefining Police Professionalism for the Los Angeles Police\n\n24\n\nTraining the 21st Century Police Officer\n\nof professionalism provides a common context for learning from other vocations that serve the public while at the same time emphasizing the special attributes that make police unlike any other group of people in the world.\n\nWHAT DOES IT MEAN TO SERVE WITH THE LAPD? It is the mission of the Los Angeles Police Department to safeguard the lives and property of the people we serve, to reduce the incidence and fear of crime, and to enhance public safety while working with the diverse communities to improve their quality of life. Our mandate is to do so with honor and integrity, while at all times conducting ourselves with the highest ethical standards to maintain public confidence (LAPD, 2003b).\n\nCopyright © 2003. RAND Corporation, The. All rights reserved.\n\nThe above is the mission, the “specific task with which a person or group is charged,” that establishes the reason the Los Angeles Police Department exists and why its officers are vested with the authority inherent in being law enforcement officials.1 It is a responsibility of all members of the LAPD to “safeguard the lives and property of the people [they] serve” and to do so “with honor and integrity, while at all times conducting [them]selves with the highest ethical standards to maintain public confidence.” The mission establishes service as the foundation of the department’s duties, a service guided by shared standards of a supreme caliber. This mission specifies “what” the officers of the LAPD are to do; the Department’s statements of its core values and principles lend insights into “how” that primary task is to be accomplished. The principles begin by addressing how police officers are to safeguard lives and property. They are to enforce the law, but not just any law (there are various codes worldwide, many designed to subjugate or control rather than protect those to whom they apply). Department principles explain that officers’ application of the law must be “within a legal spirit which was so clearly set forth by the framers of the Bill of Rights.” 2 The laws that members of the LAPD enforce are therefore in the spirit of guaranteeing the Fourth Amendment’s “right of the ______________ 1Merriam Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary, 10th ed., s.v. “mission,” 1993. 2LAPD, 2003c.\n\nGlenn, Russell, et al.

Further, officers are not to enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall [they] deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws3\n\nCopyright © 2003. RAND Corporation, The. All rights reserved.\n\nas held sacred in the Fourteenth Amendment. The people whose lives and property the LAPD safeguards include the same individuals and groups that the Bill of Rights champions. The Department principles and core values draw directly on these Constitutional guarantees. They do so “by constantly demonstrating absolutely impartial service to the law” while remembering that “the police are the only members of the public who are paid to give fulltime attention to duties which are incumbent on every citizen in the interest of community welfare” (LAPD, 2003c). The LAPD police officer is to conduct this service within the bounds of proper authority, “never appear[ing] to usurp the powers of the judiciary” (LAPD, 2003c) and serving all citizens “with equal dedication” (LAPD, 2003e). The police are to unfailingly display “a reverence for the legal rights of our fellow citizens and a reverence for the law itself” (LAPD, 2003c). Police serve “fellow citizens.” The rights they protect are as much their own as they are those for whom they serve. As George Washington wrote, “when we assumed the soldier we did not lay aside the citizen.”4 The same is true for law enforcement officers. Accomplishing the LAPD mission while meeting Department standards requires considerable expertise. It is because the police officer possesses special education and experience that he is entrusted with the responsibility to pay “full-time attention to the duties that are incumbent on every citizen” (LAPD, 2003c). Officers are to develop and maintain this expertise that is unique to them alone. No other group of individuals is so empowered and bears this burden. The LAPD officer’s way of life is one of shared values and responsibility to ______________ 3U.S. Constitution, 2003, amend. 14. 4This quotation appears on the amphitheater immediately behind the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington Cemetery.\n\nGlenn, Russell, et al. Training the 21st Century Police Officer : Redefining Police Professionalism for the Los Angeles Police\n\n26\n\nTraining the 21st Century Police Officer\n\nensure that all police maintain the standards associated with those values. Service to the public, special skills and a unique expertise, and the obligation to maintain standards based on shared values are characteristics of a profession. Can it be legitimately said that law enforcement officers, in particular those of the Los Angeles Police Department, belong to a profession and are themselves, individually, professionals? The answer is an important one. While fellow citizens grant to professionals considerable prestige and respect, membership in a profession also demands the acceptance of responsibilities well beyond those of a mere jobholder. The individual who serves only for wages or self-gratification does not qualify for the status of a professional. A professional’s work is more akin to a calling than an occupation, a calling that demands full-time dedication of his professional life, service to the public, and a lifetime commitment to the profession’s standards.\n\nWHAT IS A PROFESSION? Numerous books have been written on professionalism and professional organizations. Two that consider military professionalism also highlight ways in which to consider law enforcement as a profession.\n\nCopyright © 2003. RAND Corporation, The. All rights reserved.\n\nAllan Millett identifies six definitive elements of any profession: •\n\nThe occupation is a full-time and stable job, serving continuing societal needs;\n\n•\n\nThe occupation is regarded as a lifelong calling by the practitioners, who identify themselves personally with their job subculture;\n\n•\n\nThe occupation is organized to control performance standards and recruitment;\n\n•\n\nThe occupation requires formal, theoretical education;\n\n•\n\nThe occupation has a service orientation in which loyalty to standards of competence and loyalty to clients’ needs are paramount;\n\nGlenn, Russell, et al. Training the 21st Century Police Officer : Redefining Police Professionalism for the Los Angeles Police\n\nThe Luster in the Badge\n\n•\n\n27\n\nThe occupation is granted a great deal of collective autonomy by the society it serves, presumably because the practitioners have proven their high ethical standards and trustworthiness. 5\n\nMillett notes that “professional” status encourages its holders to behave in a more socially responsible manner. At the same time, there is considerable freedom and responsibility granted to individuals who make this sacrifice. They\n\nCopyright © 2003. RAND Corporation, The. All rights reserved.\n\ncreate their own ethical codes; establish their own educational system; recruit their own members; and maintain a unique occupational culture on the assumptions that the professional’s services represent social good, that the monopoly conditions that the professional prefers represent human progress . . . . The professional’s competency will be judged by his peers, and his conduct will be determined by the norms of his profession. He will not abuse society’s faith in his skill by ignoring either his client’s needs or the regulating judgment of his colleagues. . . . the professional’s relative freedom is conditional and ultimately depends on continuous social approval. Without constant self-policing and task success, a profession can narrow its own freedom and destroy public trust as rapidly as it gained its relative autonomy.6\n\nProfessional status is conditional upon members maintaining their standards through self-policing. That does not mean that professions will not suffer lapses by their members. The My Lai massacres of the Vietnam War and more recent cases of child molestation by clergy provide ample evidence that they do. Such incidents place the onus of recovering professional status squarely on its members, those collectively responsible for the initial dereliction. Samuel P. Huntington defines professionalism based on the three “distinguishing characteristics”: corporateness, responsibility, and expertise. He defines each of these as follows (Huntington, 1957, pp. 8–10, 15): ______________ 5Millett, 1977, p. 2. 6Ibid., p. 3.\n\nGlenn, Russell, et al. Training the 21st Century Police Officer : Redefining Police Professionalism for the Los Angeles Police\n\n28\n\nTraining the 21st Century Police Officer\n\nCorporateness The members of a profession share a sense of organic unity and consciousness of themselves as a group apart from laymen. This collective sense has its origins in the lengthy discipline and training necessary for professional competence, the common bond of work, and the sharing of a unique social responsibility . . . . Entrance into this unit is restricted to those with the requisite education and training and is usually permitted only at the lowest level of professional competence.\n\nResponsibility The professional man is a practicing expert, working in a social context, and performing a service, such as the promotion of health, education, or justice, which is essential to the functioning of society. The client of every profession is society, individually or collectively. . . . Financial remuneration cannot be the primary aim of the professional man. . . . The profession [is] a moral unit positing certain values and ideals which guide its members in their dealings with laymen. This guide may be a set of unwritten norms transmitted through the professional educational system or it may be codified into written canons of professional ethics.\n\nCopyright © 2003. RAND Corporation, The. All rights reserved.\n\nExpertise The professional man is an expert with specialized knowledge and skill in a significant field of human endeavor. His expertise is acquired only by prolonged education and experience. It is the basis of objective standards of professional competence.\n\nLike Millett, Huntington recognizes that professionalism is a goal, because “no vocation, not even medicine or law, has all the characteristics of the ideal professional type.”7 That in no way excuses any member of the profession from doing his utmost to gain and maintain the prescribed standards. It does allow that the occasional ______________ 7Huntington, 1957, p. 11.\n\nGlenn, Russell, et al. Training the 21st Century Police Officer : Redefining Police Professionalism for the Los Angeles Police\n\nThe Luster in the Badge\n\n29\n\nmember of the profession will falter and that other members will have to repair the resulting loss in public confidence. Both authors’ definitions share many characteristics. They present discussions in the context of the military, but each emphasizes that their definition of a profession applies to any vocation that meets the specified qualifications. Either man’s professional tenets could be adopted for use in this study without loss of understanding. Millett is more explicit, using six characteristics to articulate that which separates the professional from others in a workforce. Huntington exercises greater conciseness, a brevity that is nonetheless no less inclusive or demanding than Millett’s. The following adopts this more concise of the two as the primary vehicle for analysis, incorporating pertinent elements of Millett’s conceptualization where they improve understanding of the demands professional status poses for the City of Los Angeles police officer.\n\nCopyright © 2003. RAND Corporation, The. All rights reserved.\n\nIS LAW ENFORCEMENT A PROFESSION? It would appear obvious at first glance that law enforcement has a legitimate claim to professional status. Regarding corporateness, law enforcement officers are bonded by a cooperative sense of union based on shared expectations and responsibilities. The responsibility for self-policing has always been and must always be an integral part of senior police officers’ charters. Entrusted with greater authority, they have both a professional and bureaucratic dictate to enforce standards. But a profession cannot surrender the responsibility for internal policing solely to those of higher rank. Any “code of silence” notwithstanding, a police officer failing to address shortfalls in other members of his vocation fails in his duties. Depending on the severity of the shortfall, he may be, and should be, liable to punishment and banishment from his force. Police officers also have a broad responsibility to society—their client. They perform a service that is essential to its functioning. Pay is of course important, and nobody expects a professional not to receive fair compensation for his services. Financial remuneration, however, should no more be the primary motivation for assuming the status of a police officer than it is for a doctor practicing medicine or a military officer leading the nation’s youth in peace or war.\n\nGlenn, Russell, et al. Training the 21st Century Police Officer : Redefining Police Professionalism for the Los Angeles Police\n\n30\n\nTraining the 21st Century Police Officer\n\nCopyright © 2003. RAND Corporation, The. All rights reserved.\n\nWith regard to the third tenet, police officers clearly have special expertise. They receive specialized training and are expected to maintain a combination of physical, communications, and diplomatic skills unique to their vocation. Legislators make law. Judges and lawyers interpret and deal with alleged and actual breaches of the law. Only police officers assume a full-time occupational responsibility to enforce the law or interrupt the processes that cause such breaches. They do so with training that begins at an academy and continues throughout their careers. That training delineates professional standards that an officer must follow, including those pertaining to restraint when using force, adherence to the spirit and letter of the law, and control in exercising the formal and informal authority inherent in status as a police officer. While the above demonstrates that police work incorporates elements of corporateness, responsibility, and expertise, there are reasonable arguments against conferring professional status on the police. Some, for example, argue that personnel who might have to kill in pursuit of their responsibilities cannot be professionals, because they do not serve the best interests of all in the society that they are to serve. 8 Police must sometimes use deadly force in fulfilling their duties. Nevertheless, just as the military ultimately seeks to maintain peace and stability and must sometimes use lethal force, so do police desire to maintain a safe environment free of crime. That the greater number are protected through the occasional unfortunate demise of a threatening few certainly does not preclude the police officer from professional status as long as the application of force remains within the constraints of acceptable standards. Some argue that police officers are “subsumed within a vast government bureaucracy” and therefore lack “the autonomy and interaction with a bona fide clientele enjoyed by the traditional professions” such as the clergy, doctors, or lawyers.9 The argument would be persuasive if professional status were only granted to those perfectly attaining the condition of self-regulation. Government mandates, however, influence many aspects of medicine, law, and any modern ______________ 8Matthews, 1994, p. 18. 9Ibid. The comments are made with respect to the military but apply no less to police forces.\n\nGlenn, Russell, et al. Training the 21st Century Police Officer : Redefining Police Professionalism for the Los Angeles Police\n\nThe Luster in the Badge\n\n31\n\nprofession. All are answerable to regulation and the rule of law. External bureaucratic oversight should not preclude attainment of professional standing.\n\nCopyright © 2003. RAND Corporation, The. All rights reserved.\n\nAnother question is of self-perception. Self-perception is critical to professionalism. No vocation can be considered professional if its members do not accept the collective responsibility to maintain a specialized expertise, to limit membership to those with the requisite skills and who adhere to established standards, and to have a primary motivation of serving society. It is therefore pertinent to ask whether police officers themselves view their work as a profession. The answer is a mixed one. Several retired senior police leaders with whom the authors discussed the issue thought it infeasible, claiming that the officer on the street was too focused on a steady job and its pay to qualify as a professional. LAPD Police Chief William J. Bratton’s belief that policing is a profession is evident in his previously cited quotation. Evidence from other LAPD officers varies. Police probationers showed limited understanding of professional responsibilities but recognized that the academy sought to instill desirable traits in recruits and to define acceptable standards of performance. None of the probationers interviewed cited a desire to serve the community when asked why they joined the force, nor did any of the field-training officers whom we interviewed. Their predominant motivations were, in fact, pay and the need to find a job.10 Yet nearly all students in a Department watch-commander course cited a desire “to help people” as the primary reason for becoming police officers. The Department does seek to instill the tenets of professionalism in its training. Recruit Training Program Learning Domain #31 on “Custody,” for example, emphasizes values such as “integrity in all we say and do,” “quality through continuous improvement,” “respect for people,” “reverence for the law,” and “service to our community.” In recognition of a need to better interact with those served, the curriculum also cites an objective of “reestablish[ing] partnership with community.” Specific guidance includes “protecting the statutory and Constitutional rights of the arrested person while they are in the officer’s charge” and recognition that “a ______________ 10LAPD probationers focus group and FTO focus group notes, December 14, 2002.\n\nGlenn, Russell, et al. Training the 21st Century Police Officer : Redefining Police Professionalism for the Los Angeles Police\n\n32\n\nTraining the 21st Century Police Officer\n\npeace officer that shows a callous disregard for an arrested person’s safety can be subjected to departmental discipline (up to and including termination).” The lesson goes on to include discussions of specific Bill of Rights protections and responsibilities inherent in the “special position of trust” given to peace officers based on “their authority over others.”11\n\nCopyright © 2003. RAND Corporation, The. All rights reserved.\n\nThe evidence as to whether LAPD officers consider themselves to be “professionals” is contradictory. Those writing of the broader law enforcement profession are less ambivalent. The mid-20th century saw considerable efforts to establish a professional policing model that included identification of principles (or standards) as well as providing police departments some level of independence from politics, ensuring satisfactory officer training and discipline, and impartiality in enforcing the law.12 The LAPD at that time represented the model of such a professional force while under the oversight of Chief William H. Parker. The ideal was a situation in which police corruption was controlled via the selection of qualified candidates for police duties and internal handling of Department problems.13 The popular form of this ideal was Dragnet (Joe Friday and his characteristic, “Just the facts”) in which the police professional was honest, tough, and technically proficient. While missing nuances, the depiction of a technically proficient force that attempted to maintain complete objectivity during interactions with the public was not far from reality. But Joe Friday would fail to qualify as a professional police officer in Los Angeles today. His integrity and dedication deserve no less respect now than they did 50 years ago, but his overly reserved manner should, deservedly, be relegated to a past age. Police standards have evolved. Police professionalism now demands expertise and an understanding of the community in many ways not previously appreciated. Law enforcement officers today seek not only to deal with crimes already committed but to prevent crimes by addressing the issues that underlie them. “By-the-book” adherence to regulations has been replaced by increased reliance on innovation, initiative, ______________ 11LAPD, revised 2001a. 12Fyfe et al., 1997, p. 15. 13Walker, Archbold, and Herbst, 2002.\n\nGlenn, Russell, et al. Training the 21st Century Police Officer : Redefining Police Professionalism for the Los Angeles Police\n\nThe Luster in the Badge\n\n33\n\nand expertise in interpersonal interactions more akin to August Vollmer’s concept of policing than the reform-based organizations that resulted from a misapplication of his principles (see Kelling and Coles, 1996, p. 75). Herman Goldstein, a scholar and longtime student of policing, notes that expanded standards for policing now require officers to •\n\nassist those who cannot care for themselves: the intoxicated, the addicted, the mentally ill, the physically disabled, the old, and the young\n\n•\n\nresolve conflict, whether it be between individuals [or] groups of individuals\n\n•\n\nidentify problems that have the potential for becoming more serious problems for the individual citizen, the police, or for government\n\n•\n\ncreate and maintain a feeling of security in the community.14\n\nCopyright © 2003. RAND Corporation, The. All rights reserved.\n\nBratton and Andrews add support for a post-reform concept of policing, noting that now “police work is by nature decentralized and discretionary.”15 In sum, the question of whether law enforcement qualifies as a profession might best be answered by considering two separate questions. First, can law enforcement qualify as a profession? There appears to be ample evidence that it can. Second, can the LAPD be a professional force? It was considered so in the mid-20th century, albeit by standards that no longer apply (and that in truth failed to meet even the definition of professionalism at the time). We now turn to evidence regarding whether it can be so considered today.\n\nCAN THE LAPD BE A PROFESSIONAL FORCE? The LAPD has made efforts to become a professional force as the term is currently understood in policing. There is room for improvement, and it is the charter of this study to consider how that can be brought about in training involving use of force, search and ______________ 14Herman Goldstein, Policing a Free Society, Cambridge, Mass.: Ballinger, 1977, p. 35, as quoted in Fyfe et al., 1997, p. 37. 15Bratton and Andrews, 1999, p. 14.\n\nGlenn, Russell, et al. Training the 21st Century Police Officer : Redefining Police Professionalism for the Los Angeles Police\n\n34\n\nTraining the 21st Century Police Officer\n\nseizure, arrest procedures, community policing, and diversity awareness. The solutions must have a Department-wide perspective. Authors Kelling and Stewart note that the successful implementation of police professionalism today requires “major changes in the training of police officers, supervisors, and managers, as well as in staffing, organization, and administration of police departments.”16 The following pages address the nature of these necessary changes as they pertain to training the men and women of the LAPD. To the question “Is the Los Angeles Police Department a professional law enforcement organization?” the evidence in too many ways supports a negative response. “Can the LAPD be a professional force?” Evidence seems to support an affirmative answer, but individual and collective dedication to making the necessary changes is necessary to get there from here.\n\nCopyright © 2003. RAND Corporation, The. All rights reserved.\n\nGETTING THERE FROM HERE An LAPD effort to achieve professional status is important only in the sense that it makes the organization a better servant of its clients, the people of Los Angeles. It is the purpose of this study to determine how the Department can achieve that end through the medium of training the force so that it is more proficient in the five areas of concern. Huntington’s tenets of professionalism—corporateness, responsibility, and expertise—provide a vehicle to better understand what is necessary to meet that purpose. Those tenets, in fact professionalism itself, provide a foundation essential to successful training and implementation of areas of use of force, search and seizure, arrest procedures, community policing, and diversity awareness. Success in attaining professionalism demands commitment to public service, requisite expertise throughout the Department, and the realization that fellow officers have a responsibility to assist their colleagues when situations stress the patience of even the best. Figure 2.1, each element of which will be explained in detail in the pages that follow, helps to portray how the three tenets can assist in the development and execution of LAPD training. The objective of that training is to better prepare law enforcement officers for the task of ______________ 16Fyfe et al., 1997, p. 23.\n\nGlenn, Russell, et al.

It has been noted that there are those who believe that police are not and never will be professionals. These individuals see law enforcement officers as little more than wage laborers. Such doubters find it unconvincing that there are police officers who have the necessary expertise, will act to correct other officers’ shortcomings, and are dedicated to public service. They consider those personnel demonstrating these abilities to be exceptional, outliers perhaps best considered as professionals without a profession.
