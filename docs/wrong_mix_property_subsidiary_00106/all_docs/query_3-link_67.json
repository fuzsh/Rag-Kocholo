        "text": "South Korean electronics giant LG Electronics said it had agreed to establish a strategic partnership with US electric vehicle (EV) charging operator ChargePoint to expand their EV charging businesses globally.\n\nChargePoint said the first step would be to make available its charger management software which has received security certification from the US federal government, for LG to use in its EV charging hardware with “deliveries expected to begin later this summer”.\n\nFurther ahead, the two companies aim to combine ChargePoint’s EV charging systems with LG’s energy storage systems (ESS) and integrate the LG ThinQ smart home platform with ChargePoint’s Home Flex residential charger, among other areas of collaboration.\n\nChargePoint CEO Rick Wilmer said in a statement: “LG shares ChargePoint’s commitment to enabling a world-class charging experience for all EV drivers, regardless of make, model or connector type. Together we will develop market leading EV charging solutions and pursue further opportunities to push the envelope thanks to our combined engineering expertise.”\n\nSuh Heung-kyu, global head of the electric vehicle charging business division of the LG Business Solutions Company, added: “There is incredible synergy between our two companies and we expect this partnership to help LG become a global leader in the EV charging business. This agreement exemplifies how LG continues to pursue strategic alliances to advance innovation and further strengthen our status as a total EV charging solutions provider.”\n\nLast year, LG decided to make EV charging a key growth business for the group, with a commitment to developing it into a trillion KRW enterprise by 2030. The company said that with this latest memorandum of understanding (MoU) it would “be able to leverage ChargePoint’s expansive network to explore EV charger supply opportunities around the globe, while ChargePoint, its customers and its drivers stand to benefit from LG’s reliable, high-quality EV charging solutions.”\n\nLG said in a statement ChargePoint had 306,000 active ports under management within its North American and European EV charging networks."
