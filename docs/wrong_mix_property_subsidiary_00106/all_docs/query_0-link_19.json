        "text": "As I have said before, I hate it when e-learning hacks make superficial, overly-broad analogies to hot trends. \"E-learning should be like hybrid cars; Training should be like Ipod Nanos; Lessons learned from FEMA.\"\n\nHaving said that, I love a real analogy. For example, six years ago, I found it very useful to apply experiences with ERPs and CRMs to the then emerging area of LMSs. It did provide real glimpses into the future. As a rule, cold trends actually provide more insight than hot trends.\n\nSo with all of that as a caveat, I would like to present up an analogy that I hope is an example of the second, not first, category.\n\nIf you want to see how educational simulations will be created to teach history to the K-12 and undergraduate environment, look at the various Star Trek computer games.\n\nHere's why.\n\nStar Trek is a series of many, many (far too many?) stories, that cover a coherent timeline, with consistant cultures and technologies. Furthermore, Star Trek events, despite the single brand, have been created by many, many individuals and teams. There are missing links; there are contradictions. This background material is a fairly good analogy of history source material.\n\nGame developers have tried to capture the essence of the story in game forms. Star Trek games have more often than not used existing genres (First Person Shooter, Real Time Strategy, now MMORPG). They have often had to go deep (space ship battles in general) over broad (from beginning to end of Wrath of Kahn). Some new genres have been created (Bridge Commander, Starfleet Command). Some games have been created by modding other games (Star Trek mod for Half-Life 2). Some are very complex, developing deep expertise; some could not be more simple. Some just use the high level theme over an existing game (Star Trek pinball or Star Trek trivia game). This maps fairly well to the effort that different developers will probabbly go through to create historical educational sims.\n\nStar Trek fans are very engaged in the process. Every new Star Trek game brings heaps of criticism, people trashing the experience as being not accurate enough (What about episode 212 when Captain Yeri fired six photon blasts in less than five seconds), or fun enough, or broad/comprehensive enough. They then mod the experience, in some cases fixing inaccuracies, in some cases making something less accurate but more fun. This maps fairly well to the role of other historians/instructors looking at the experience.\n\nSome Lessons learned:\n\nNo one sim will capture the entire experience. Sims will often go deep, not broad.\n\nThe more accurate the sim, the more frustrating it will be to play the first time.\n\nThe less accurate the sim, the easier it is to game it, but all sims, no matter how accurate, can be gamed at some point. Multi-player games creates environments where people are faster to break the illusion and try to exploit the rules.\n\nDebates around specifics are inevitable, but should not be used an excuse to discount the entire experience. 100% accuracy is neither possible nor desirable.\n\nHuge holes in source material will be uncovered that were missed by linear thinkers but that are glaring to more dynamic content creators.\n\nCreating new genres is more powerful but also more risky than using old ones.\n\nSmall simple games can be more instructive than super complex ones, especially for teaching about high level relationships.\n\nSims won't replace the source material, but augment it.\n\nTime lines are less important than interactions.\n\nCommunities are key.\n\nI think the real power of educational simulations in K-12 and higher-ed will come when we rethink our curriculum all together. But for those intent on history based educational simulations (and my hat goes off to everyone of you - let me know how I can help!), I think the analogy is a good one.\n\nThiagi asked me to do a brief interview about games and simulations, which he published here. Take a look at it, if you want, before you continue. I would like you to consider it at two levels.\n\nFirst, there are a few nuggets of interesting perspectives on simulation design.\n\nBut more importantly, there is a lot of space and energy, both on my part as the writer and your part as the consumer, dedicated to humor. Think of your own experience as a reader plowing through the material.\n\nSome will find it engaging.\n\nSome will find it lame.\n\nSome will find it a waste of space (mostly the people who really care about the material).\n\nSome will read all of the material because of the humor, which lowers tension and builds connectedness with the reader.\n\nMy meta-point to the interview was to let readers experience a game element themselves (the humor), and come to their own opinions on the risks and benefits of using game elements generally.\n\nWho says learning by doing has to be complex?"
