        "text": "Let's talk about Pride.... I was asked to write a company email for Pride month to accompany the company's blog. What an honor. Sharing my thoughts more broadly. ************************************ Let’s talk about Pride. It has been almost, but not quite, ten years since same-sex marriage was legalized in the United States. I remember June 26, 2015 very well. When this Supreme Court decision happened, I was in just another airport, traveling to just another somewhere when I read the headline: SUPREME COURT DECLARES SAME SEX MARRIAGE LEGAL IN ALL 50 STATES. The only thing on my mind was wanting to speak with my friend who had to go through impossible hurdles to ensure the protection of her child with her wife and all that they needed to do so that this child could not be taken away from them if they ever dared to travel out of state without tremendous amounts of documentation. This Supreme Court decision was public and lawful affirmation of their lives, of their love, and of their family. For myself and so many others, June 26, 2015 was a day of tears, smiles and celebration. And here we are in 2024 during Pride month, celebrating the achievements and joys of the LGBTQ+ community through support, affinity, or allyship. In our collective support for the LGBTQ+ community, we must also recognize the current reality that in these same 10 years of inclusivity, progress has been uneven. More recently we have seen backlash, a reversal of rights in some areas, and sometimes open hostility and discrimination towards the LGBTQ+ community. For allies and supporters, it is our responsibility, this month and always, to stand up in the face of discrimination and educate ourselves on both the history and current events regarding this vibrant community. What I love about Pride month is the focus on inclusivity, education, and the reaffirmation that love is love. At Transcarent, we proudly celebrate Pride. Let us continue to stand with supporting each other and let us lift the voices and tremendous spirit of the LGBTQ+ community. ...... Happy Pride. Love is Love.\n\nAs we head into this Mother’s Day weekend when so many will be thinking about mothers and love and caring, I want to highlight this important work of Theresa Moore and her company T-Time Productions. Theresa is shining a light on those who have been forgotten and on the stories that go untold. In this case, 1000 graves of people who were poor, sometimes mentally ill, buried a century ago. People whose gravestones are marked by only a number. T-Time Education’s project - More than a Number - with dignity, respect, caring - will have students research these stories and bring honor to those buried there. This project is a collaboration with government, with a school, is meticulously, respectfully, and carefully planned. As we strip out and/or erode important educational content across the country, Theresa is doing the painstaking hard work of shining light on untold stories. Putting experience and engaging learning front and center in education. Celebrating this incredible and caring work!!! #leadership #caring #inspiring #socialjustice #dignity https://lnkd.in/g6dhv5jb\n\nSo a few things. #1. The latest Inspiring Women Pod episode has dropped and you are going to love it. Why? Because it is Karen Walker Johnson. Health plan CEO, GV (Google Ventures) Advisor, Board Director/Chair (March of Dimes, The Oncology Institute and and and...). Karen is a force. Enjoy! #2. Oh yes. This happened. Transcarent. Back in the saddle here and all I am going to say is this. When big vision and doing the impossible becomes ....maybe...hopefully....actually possible. It was Christmas Eve when Glen Tullman called. \"Laurie, I really think we can fix healthcare. We can do something big - meaningful, really meaningful, really impactful. I know it's hard. I know you know hard. This is going to be harder. But I really think we can do it.....\" So here I am. One place for health and care. And holy moly, a stunning team of committed exceptionally smart focused on making it better. A LOT better. So here we go. Maybe a little less sleep .... but more people with access to affordable high quality care? Making that happen? Really making that happen? Yep. I am here for it."
