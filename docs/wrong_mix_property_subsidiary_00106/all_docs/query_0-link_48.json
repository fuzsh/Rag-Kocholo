        "text": "The current study aimed to analyze and compare hotel names (HNs) in Makkah, Madinah and Riyadh to find out if they differ in their linguistic and cultural features. Results of the data analysis showed that linguistically, most HNs in the three cities consist of two-word compounds. Culturally, HNs in Makkah and Madinah are loaded with meaning and reflect the country&#39;s rich past and present Islamic cultures and heritage. Most HNs in the two holy cities contain words and phrases from the Quran (Elaf, AlFurqan); notable events in Islamic history (Al-Hijra, Al-Fath); ancient Islamic place names (AlSakifa, Ohod); use of other names of Makkah and Madinah (Bakka, Umm AlQura, Taiba); and words with spiritual connotations (Alhuda, AlEman, AlEhsan). Islamic and spiritual words are even combined with names of international hotels as in Dar Al-Eman/Dar AlTaqwa/Dar AlHijra Intercontinental. The word &#39;Dar&#39; which means &#39;house&#39; is added to HNs to make hotel residents feel at hom...\n\nPanel sponsored by the International Hagiography Society, for International Congress on Medieval Studies, Kalamazoo, USA, 12-16 May 2016. Co-organised with Dr Barbara E. Zimbalist (English, University of Texas at El Paso). Scholars have often commented on the link between sanctity and celebrity. Both the saint and the celebrity are elevated above the everyday, with identities carefully crafted by cultural producers to respond to the needs and desires of an audience, region, or temporality. Sacralisation/celebrification entails a series of processes which (re)formulate a subject into a product fit for social, political, and economic consumption. Yet sanctity/celebrity is not simply exploitative, but enjoyable and perhaps even empowering. What does it really mean to be a medieval celebrity? How does celebrity intersect with sanctity? What does such a categorization add to the study of hagiography? Can fame resonate on both a social and spiritual level, and how does the medieval idea of fame generate, overlap with, and inform contemporary discourses of fame, celebrity, and sanctity? Relevant topics for this session include: - Saints as commercial products and/or economic agents - The construction of Sanctity and Communal Identity - Audience reaction(s) to a saint and textual reception - Power dynamics between celebrity/saint and star- maker/confessor or hagiographer/cleric/scribe - The social function of celebrity/sanctity - Film theoryâ€™s contribution to the study of sanctity more generally"
