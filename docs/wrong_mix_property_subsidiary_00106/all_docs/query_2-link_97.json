        "text": "Abstract\n\nRecently, there has been a surge in the popularity of voice-first devices, such as Amazon Echo, Google Home, etc. While these devices make our life more convenient, they are vulnerable to new attacks, such as voice replay. We develop an end-to-end system to detect replay attacks without requiring a user to wear any wearable device. Our system, called REVOLT, has several distinct features: (i) it intelligently exploits the inherent differences between the spectral characteristics of the original and replayed voice signals, (ii) it exploits both acoustic and WiFi channels in tandem, (iii) it utilizes unique breathing rate extracted from WiFi signal while speaking to test the liveness of human voice. After extensive evaluation, our voice component yields Equal Error Rate (EER) of 0.88% and 10.32% in our dataset and ASV2017 dataset, respectively; and WiFi based breathing detection achieves Breaths Per Minute (BPM) error of 1.8 up to 3m distance. We further combine WiFi and voice based detection and show the overall system offers low false positive and false negative when evaluated against a range of attacks.\n\nSupplementary Material\n\npradhan (pradhan.zip)\n\nSupplemental movie, appendix, image and software files for, Combating Replay Attacks Against Voice Assistants\n\nDownload\n\n2.52 MB\n\nReferences\n\n[1]\n\n2018. 24.5M voice-first devices expected to ship this year, but apps struggle to retain users. https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/24/24-5m-voice-first-devices-expected-to-ship-this-year-but-apps-struggle-to-retain-users/.\n\n[2]\n\n2018.

Keystroke dynamics can help prevent credentials from being abused in case of theft or leakage. But ...\n\nHighlights\n\nKeystroke dynamics is considered seamless and transparent.\n\nKeystroke dynamics ...\n\nRobust biometric scheme against replay attacks using one-time biometric templates\n\nAbstract\n\nUser authentication is an important issue on the Internet and usually solved through static and often unique passwords. Another method is to use biometrics, but biometric data are sensitive and need to be protected. Protection schemes such as ...\n\nInformation & Contributors\n\nInformation\n\nPublished In\n\n1415 pages\n\nEISSN:2474-9567\n\nDOI:10.1145/3361560\n\nIssue’s Table of Contents\n\nCopyright © 2019 ACM.\n\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.
