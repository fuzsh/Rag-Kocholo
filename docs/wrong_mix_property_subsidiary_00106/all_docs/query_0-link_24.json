Executive summary II. U.S. e-learning Market III. Suggested markets to explore IV. U.S. corporate e-learning programs V. Tecnonexo’s competitive advantage VI. Findings/Recommendations I. Appendix I: ESL training market in the U.S.\n\n4. There are many things to consider when entering the U.S. market ♦ There is no single large U.S. e-learning market; the market is actually comprised of numerous smaller niches ♦ The vast majority of firms are custom content players whose competitive advantage is domain expertise in a specific niche ♦ The most lucrative opportunities are with large companies in general training but less sophisticated 1st customers might be smaller companies or specialized training for a business units ♦ It is a small world of e-learning experts which lowers the cost of sales but makes reputation very important ♦ U.S. market characterized by stricter technical standards and high touch consultative relationships ♦ Most U.S. firms have their own LMS and competition is fierce in this space making it more prudent to focus on custom content ♦ Diversity training issues are on the horizon for major U.S. firms but training in foreign languages is limited ♦ Using Mexico as a stepping stone would make U.S. entry easier ♦ In addition to industry vertical and business process niches, capability and methodology expertise can be a competitive advantage\n\n5. Tecnonexo must improve its technical capabilities and consulting skills to compete effectively in U.S. on anything other than low cost ♦ Phase I: Continue growth with Mexico expansion while developing technical and consulting capabilities (0-18 months) – Use Mexico as a stepping stone to U.S. • Large opportunity, close ties to U.S. market, lower technical expectations, Tecnonexo currently well positioned – Start with small U.S. businesses where Tecnonexo can be a complete solution provider • More price sensitive, less influence in e-learning community, more in line with Tecnonexo’s core competencies ♦ Phase II: Enter the U.S. by targeting a niche and expanding (6-24 months) – Focus on a niche where Tecnonexo can compete with boutique players – Expand to adjacent industry verticals or training functions eventually becoming a consultative integrator\n\n6.

Summary As e-learning continues to grow in 2007, content will be developed faster and will be created more by users and communities Key Trends Outlook for 2007 from Bersin While payrolls decreased an average of 11% in 2006, learning organization continue to Increased spend on technology. A defined outsourcing strategy will lower costs while providing a Outsourcing stable technology investment Talent management will change the role of Human Resources New Focus Areas Leadership and management training will be the largest program area spending Traditional corporate training departments will be less widespread Centralization Learning will be driven by the central training group, with less emphasis on company divisions and departments Content created by and defined by users, who can publish material quickly Less control over content since there will be more avenues for publication Content Management Social networking will be integrated into e-learning programs Users will publish courses in fraction of time Courses will be smaller, and created more rapidly --> attractive for today’s media New oriented youth Approaches Gaming, simulation, and wikis will enhance user experience, and community feedback *Source: Bersin & Associates 2007 Predictions\n\n23. Summary The U.S. e-learning industry is highly fragmented, with 1,500-2,000 firms currently competing Size of Custom Courseware Vendors (Number of Employees) Tecnonexo ♦ There is no single large U.S. e-learning 100-499 50-99 market; the market is actually comprised 6% 500 5% of numerous smaller niches. 3% ♦ The vast majority of firms are custom content players whose competitive advantage is domain expertise in a specific niche. 26-49 22% ♦ The market sustains so many firms < 25 because many of these custom content 64% firms are essentially “one man shows”, with relationship owners who lack the cash flow and/or motivation to expand. * Source: Brandon-Hall.com\n\n24. Summary There is a long tail of niche players in the U.S. market that Tecnonexo will initially be competing with Biggest firms fall into three categories 1. LMS companies 2. Off the shelf content creators 3. Consultative integrators Firm Revenues Vast majority of firms are custom content niche players whose competitive advantage is domain expertise 1,500 to 2,000 e-learning companies in the U.S. If Tecnonexo wants to be competitive in the U.S. market it will have to develop expertise in a niche to compete with small firms – once this is established, it can build its brand, reputation and capabilities to eventually become a consultative integrator.\n\n25. III. Suggested markets to explore Mexican e-learning industry outlook Opportunities in the Mexican market Hispanic market in the U.S. Why Mexico will be a logical first step to further development Non-corporate market\n\n26. Mexican Opportunity Mexico and the Mexican Market for Tecnonexo Population Ciudad Juarez 106 Million People Hermosillo Gross Domestic Product Monterrey 743.07 BN USD (Adjusted) Internet Users 28 Million internet users Tijuana Cancun Number of Personal Computers 13 Million Guadalajara Number of Business PC’s Puebla 5.1 Million (60% of them with internet access) Educational Expense as percent of GDP Mexico D.F. 7.07% Key cities to consider Unemployment Rate 4.02% Source: INEGI\n\n27. Mexican Opportunity The Mexican e-learning market is approximately $1.4 B, and consists of mostly government contracted work* ♦ Value and growth of the market – Estimated at $1 billion (USD) in 2004 and forecasted to increase 40% by 2006 – Strong growth predicted for the coming years, due in part to the current administrations E-Mexico initiative and increased corporate learning investment by multinationals, larger Mexican companies and financial institutions – Mexican Small & medium enterprises (SME’s) will increasingly demand E-Learning solutions and custom content ♦ E-Mexico government project – The national E-Mexico project is aimed at encouraging the use of information technology in Mexico – one specific objective is to get 98% of the Mexican population on-line by 2025 – One section of the project concerns e-learning – Currently, there are some 28 million Web users, that is, nearly 27% of the total population – This increase in Internet use in Mexico points to growing demand for e-learning technology ♦ Business opportunities – Explore opportunities with larger Mexican companies and with transnational companies in Mexico by cold calling or leveraging Argentina and Ecuador’s successful ventures through HR manager’s recommendations – Position Tecnonexo as idle partner for booming SME’s. Franchising companies a great opportunity. – Keep abreast of calls for tenders from the Mexican government to find out about new projects under the E-Mexico project – calls for tenders can be seen at www.compranet.gob.mx – Explore potential synergies with ILCE (a multilateral organization with presence in LATAM and HQ in Mexico) – they provide most of the content for the Mexican Government *Source: Government of Quebec; http://www.mdeie.gouv.qc.ca/page/web/portail/en/exportation/nav/market_sheets.html?page=details.jsp&iddoc=55765\n\n28. Mexican Opportunity Corporate opportunities in Mexico ♦ What to expect – Still an underserved market but increasing competition from foreign competitors (CISCO, TATA, and smaller cross-border e-Learning companies from the U.S.) – Mexicans are not very used to training for their benefit, but they will engage in training required by their companies – Many Universities (UNAM, IMAC, ITESM, UAdeG, etc.) are engaging in content creation and delivery methods for companies – Mexican government a very big player (E-Mexico, PEMEX, CFE, CNA) – SME’s are great targets, however will have to educate them in the benefits of e-Learning and presenting content in an intuitive, pedagogical way ♦ If Tecnonexo were to enter the Mexican Market – Building a physical presence in the country will be important because high physical interaction is expected during the sales process – There is a hierarchical decision making process in large companies so work your way up through the ranks – Active participation in chambers, organizations, symposiums and conferences highly recommended to network, show commitment to the market and gain visibility – Mexico is a franchising leader in the region, and they are growing very fast. Use solution selling: These companies represent an interesting opportunity to provide E-training – Crucial for Tecnonexo to engage in direct relationship with the people providing the content. Content is more valuable than technology for Mexican companies\n\n29.

Mexican Roadmap Roadmap to enter the Mexican market ♦ Option A: Office of Representation with No Income (ORNI) – This is the equivalent to a sales agency. Any transaction will be done between the Mexican company and Tecnonexo Argentina. The Mexican company can deduct the payment under Rule 2.4.31 of the Federal Tax Miscellaneous – This will minimize the people that are necessary in Mexico (Accounting, Bookkeeping) while allowing Mexican companies to physically perceive Tecnonexo’s presence in the country – Certain formalities such as registry in the National Registry of Foreign Investments and filings before the tax authorities are required ♦ Pros: – Lower cost alternative to incorporating. Will allow for an initial exploration, yet more formal incursion into the Mexican market. Less paperwork than to have everything sourced from ARG. No employee liability in Mexico, no hassles with social security (labor laws are harsh) ♦ Cons: – Some companies might prefer dealing with a Mexican company. Many government contracts might not be open to bidding by foreign companies. Many day to day items are easier to deal with a Mexican company (local employees payroll, lease of equipment)\n\n31. Mexican Roadmap Roadmap to enter the Mexican market ♦ Option B: Incorporation of a Mexican subsidiary – Creation of a legal entity in Mexico, either a S.A. de C.V. or a S. de R.L. de C.V. – If the Mexican market is profitable for Tecnonexo, eventually it will have to incorporate. – The whole process can take more than 40 days from start to finish. It requires a fair amount of formalities and consequences that need to be further discussed with a Mexican lawyer – It only makes sense to incorporate in either Mexico City or Monterrey, because of the concentration of company headquarters and ease of travel to other parts of the country ♦ Pros: – More solid structure creates positive signaling to Mexican companies. Transfer pricing between Mexico and Argentina to take advantage of tax benefits. Easier to obtain credit, leases, and to hire more than a few employees. More international positioning for Tecnonexo ♦ Cons: – Incorporation is more expensive, takes more time and demands administrative staff\n\n32. Mexican Roadmap Roadmap to enter the Mexican market ♦ Option C: Partnership with a Mexican company – Create a joint venture agreement between Tecnonexo and a Mexican company – The characteristics of the partner company must be a company that deals with corporate training and that has not explored the E-Learning solution, however is aware of its potential and recognizes Tecnonexo as a leader in Latin America – This will allow Tecnonexo to leverage their brand name and value proposition, without competing with the Mexican company’s offering, thus aligning incentives, and not resulting in another partnership fiasco for Tecnonexo. – It will be hard to find a decent sized company with these characteristics, and especially hard to find this without deeper knowledge of the Mexican Market. ♦ Pros: – Very low cost solution to begin exploring the Mexican Market. Tecnonexo’s leadership in LatAm can be better leveraged with a Mexican company than with an American company ♦ Cons: – Hard to find a company that fits the profile. It can take a while before they truly understand Tecnonexo’s value proposition. Tecnonexo can not capture the Whole PIE that they could alone.\n\n33. Mexican Roadmap How much will it cost Tecnonexo? – Some rough numbers Incorporation of an ORNI: Incorporation of a Company (SA de CV or S de RL de CV): Legal Fees/Permits $ 5,000 USD : Legal Fees/Permits $ 10,000 USD : Employees: Employees: Directors: Directors: Argentinean Salary + $ 36,000 USD Argentinean Salary + $ 36,000 USD Ex-Pat Bonus $ 30,000 USD Ex-Pat Bonus $ 30,000 USD Staff: Staff: Manpower Outsource $ 10,000 USD Administrative $ 8,000 USD Salespeople (x2) $ 24,000 USD plus comm.

U.S. Hispanic Market Potential sources of opportunity in the U.S. ♦ Hispanic diversity in the workplace (Develop a product with Tecnonexo’s expertise) – Educate the customer on the differences that exist within their Hispanic employees, positioning Tecnonexo as the one company that understands different cultural/ethnic backgrounds labeled under a broader “Hispanic” category – Similar in offering to Global Training (www.global-training.com), which teaches about diversity in the workplace, yet dedicated exclusively to understanding Hispanics – Educate about diversity within the Hispanic diversity. There are at least 14 distinct groups that make up the Hispanic/Latino American population, whose members trace their lineage to North America (Mexico and the Caribbean), Europe (Spain), and South America, as well as from the isthmus of Central America ♦ Minority (Hispanic) supplier training programs – Provide e-learning solutions for large corporations who have a minority supplier business program, which includes Hispanic businesses – It is large companies’ best interest that their suppliers are well trained and understand the policies of the client company. To ensure this, some content in Spanish and a thorough understanding of the Hispanic/Latino population in the U.S. might be desired – Potential partnerships include U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, National Minority Supplier Development Council, among others – Areas of opportunity are Quality Assurance, Operations, Client Company Culture\n\n37. U.S. Hispanic Market Mexico can be a logical first step to entering the U.S. Mexico is the Latin American country with the largest number of domestic transnational ♦ companies Competitiveness in Mexico is pursued very aggressively by multinational companies ♦ Mexico has the largest number of American companies (2600) and the largest FDI from the U.S., ♦ which means there is a great potential of cross selling to U.S. counterparts Tecnonexo enjoys good reputation in the Mexican market because of media coverage and self ♦ published e-learning magazine Mexico is the largest economy in the region (followed closely by Brazil) ♦ There is more assimilation of U.S. culture in Mexico than in any other country in Latin America ♦ The Hispanic market in the U.S. is comprised of 66% Mexican origin immigrants, therefore a ♦ presence in Mexico can provide some leverage when pitching to the U.S. about understanding the Mexican/Hispanic market There is a better competitive landscape in Mexico, therefore the experience gained in that ♦ market will be useful when entering the U.S. market in full force.\n\n38. Non-Corporate Market Tecnonexo also works with non-corporate organizations, and continues to grow in this market since its entry in 2006 PAHO PAHO Staff Development Unit Staff Development Unit Current Non-corporate Clients Current Non-corporate Clients UNDP (Argentina) UNDP (Argentina) World Bank (US) World Bank (US) Pan American Health Pan American Health Unidad de Género, Unidad de Género, Organization (US) Knowledge Organization (US) Knowledge Legal Affairs Legal Affairs Operation Unit Operation Unit Grupo Étnico y Salud Grupo Étnico y Salud Fundación del Saber (Panama) Fundación del Saber (Panama) AMIA (Argentina) AMIA (Argentina) Fundación CDI (Argentina) Fundación CDI (Argentina) ASAE (Argentina) ASAE (Argentina) World Health World Health Organization Organization World Health Organization World Health Organization Several new projects and clients have been referred to us as a result of our success with PAHO, our first NGO client in 2006; leading to one of our largest current projects, The WHO\n\n39. Non-Corporate Market Characteristics of the non-corporate market that make it attractive ♦ There is a significant opportunity to leverage past successes in the non- corporate market in the U.S. because of the highly networked nature of the industry – skjd ♦ The government bid process is highly consolidated such that once Tecnonexo gets approval as a preferred service provider they will be invited to bid on a wide array of projects – Key U.S. government vendor approval organizations for e-learning (www.usalearning.gov) • Office of Personnel Management (OPM) – Training Management Assistance (TMA) – Go Learn (www.opm.gov/hrd/tma) • Foreign Service Institute (FSI) – (http://www.state.gov/m/fsi/) • Fastrac (http://www.wbtrain.com) • National Technical Information Service (NTIS) www.ntis.gov ♦ The partnership model still may hold promise in this industry because of the vendor selection process – If Tecnonexo cannot get on the list of government approved vendors it may be possible to become a subcontractor for firms that are and still maintain brand visibility and profit margin • Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) – (www.adlnet.gov)\n\n40. IV. U.S. corporate e-learning programs Structure of e-learning deployments Foreign Language Opportunity Vendor Selection Technical Superiority Evaluation Methodology\n\n41. Interviews conducted with decision makers in a variety of industries ♦ Boeing: Jon Schneider, Worldwide Learning Training and Development Leader ♦ Bank of America: George Selix, Service Delivery Executive for Global Human Resources Technology ♦ Carrier (a United Technology Company): Patrick Preux, Vice President of Human Resources and Brenda Keaton, Vice President of Leadership and Development ♦ General Motors: Donnee Ramelli, CEO of GM University ♦ Intel: Coco Yackley, Human Resource Chief Information Officer ♦ Hawaiian TelCom: Tom Pipal, Director of Corporate Training ♦ Tesoro: Bill Thomson, Manager of Learning Solutions ♦ Dell Computer: Paul McKinnon, Sr. Vice President of Human Resources ♦ Accenture: Dan Bielenberg, Accenture Capability Development Strategy ♦ e-learning Consultant: Ann Marion ♦ W.R.

Structure Structure of e-learning deployments for U.S. companies is maturing Impossible to compete Best opportunity, General Training but most stringent (Compliance/Regulatory, Business ethics, New Employee Orientation) RFP process Less Business Unit #1 Business Unit #3 stringent RFP Business Unit #2 process ♦ New product training ♦ Technical skills ♦Supervisory skills ♦ Technical skills ♦ Sales training ♦ Health and safety ♦ Customer training As the e-learning market matures there will be more unified technology platforms and a more consolidated vendor selection process increasing the importance of the corporate training department\n\n43. Structure The maturation of U.S. e-learning industry and what it means to Tecnonexo ♦ Major companies are investing in one Learning Management System that can handle worldwide e-learning needs – The ability to easily integrate with these systems will be imperative – Tecnonexo needs to keep up-to-date on how to integrate with U.S. LMS systems (ie be SCORM and AICC compliant) ♦ Purchasing process will become more defined forcing business units to select vendors dictated by the corporate training department – Corporate training department will be making the majority of vendor selections for business units – Tecnonexo should target a niche in general training where it can create contacts within corporate training departments – Tecnonexo can use this foot in the door to sell into individual business units and other areas of the business ♦ These trends are just starting to take effect and it is important to note that there is still a long way to go (5+ years) before they become a reality – Still it is important for Tecnonexo to position itself correctly from the start while still maintaining the entrepreneurial spirit kept them agile and flexible in the short term – LMS is becoming a commodity in the U.S. and so therefore not worth wasting resources on for the U.S. market – a partnership with a major LMS provider might be a better option\n\n44. Foreign Language U.S. e-learning opportunities in foreign languages are limited ♦ Individual business units make the majority of the custom content purchases and see little need to purchase e-learning in a foreign language – There is no market for foreign language specific training in U.S. based business units – Tecnonexo should approach the foreign business units directly (i.e. Mexico) ♦ Training in foreign language purchased by U.S. based firms is generally a mere translation of a module that was developed in English – The only value in a U.S. based firm hiring an e-learning company that specializes in foreign language is for translation (low value) • The exception to this would be if Tecnonexo could provide language-diversity needs for any language so that firms that need things in multiple languages could have one service provider addressing all of their language-diversity needs (Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Vietnamese, etc.) – Tecnonexo should avoid selling itself as a foreign language expert but might consider doing some translation as a way to get a foot in the door (entry tactic – not long-term strategy)\n\n45. Foreign Language Technical terminology ESL holds promise ♦ e-learning is becoming more widely adopted and the business world is becoming more global – The need for effective cultural training among multinationals is increasing – Technical ESL to train employees on technical terms (generally English) that are used globally becoming important (especially for companies that manufacture globally) ♦ Cultural training – Content provided by the company and Tecnonexo to train employees on different cultures and more effective interaction techniques ♦ Technical ESL – The content would come from the client but Tecnonexo would have to hire technical/language experts, which will increase up-front costs – Some of content could be reused for future projects in that same industry – Secure a relationship with reputable, credible sources of technical expertise where a projects might take place and hire once the project is sold Source: U.S. Census Data, 2004\n\n46. Foreign Language Experts agree that learning English increases productivity or at least the perception of worker ability ♦ Kossoudji (JLE, 1988): – Employers perceive English language ability as positive signal of worker ability; reduces the “general uncertainty about productivity” and provides “extra signal that, by overcoming the language barrier, [English speakers] have higher levels of ability and drive than the average person with the same measured characteristics.” ♦ Carnevale et.al.: – Economists “assume that English ability is a skill that makes a worker more productive and, hence, brings greater rewards in the U.S. labor market” – “…after having achieved a given level of understanding of the spoken word, then improved skills in speaking, reading, and writing do matter to employers” and can lead to “subsequent incremental increases in productivity” ♦ Mason: – Mexican-Americans NOT fluent in Spanish “receive an annual premium of 13%, more than $1,200 per year” – Is English acquisition attractive to employers beyond workplace proficiency – economic AND ethno-social assimilation? Source: Kossoudjj, Carnevale, Mason\n\n47. Vendor Selection Vendors are selected because of expertise and technical execution ♦ When companies outsource their content development to a third party provider, they must be convinced that: – Integration will be smooth (technical compatibility and execution) – Third party has expertise not possessed in-house ♦ Top 5 vendor selection criteria (order shifts in importance depending on project) Subject Matter Expertise: industry vertical, business function – Quality: references, demos, instructionally effective, adult education, edutainment – Accuracy: no mistakes, professional looking – Easy to work with: frequent reviews, good use of in-house experts, professional interaction – On-time delivery – ♦ Flawless technical execution in the U.S. is a minimum expectation – Server problems, crashes, bugs, etc. are not tolerated and will immediately eliminate you from any bid process or preferred vendor list – Technonexo needs to invest in the proper technical infrastructure and quality assurance if they want to enter the U.S. market as anything other than a low cost provider *Source: Dec. 2006 Training Magazine Industry Report\n\n48. Vendor Selection Sourcing gets more sophisticated as companies get larger Small Firms Medium/Large Firms Large Firms Shop vendors for Issue request for Form a partnership • • • each individual proposal with one system project with very periodically and integrator that in little coordination of create a short list of turn sources to entire e-learning preferred vendors other providers solution for use on different when the request is projects beyond capabilities More price sensitive • Sophisticated LMS Few e-learning • • Less sophisticated companies even • selection process Rigorous selection have this capability • process The greatest opportunity will be with the larger firms but Tecnonexo does not currently have the capabilities necessary to compete so it will have to start out with small to medium firms and move up the value chain\n\n49. Vendor Selection Companies prefer to have a few e-learning vendors because of steep learning curves and high switching costs ♦ More companies are looking for e-learning “partners” with the capability to implement comprehensive solutions that and help shape e-learning strategy – Building a variety of skills in different areas will be important ♦ Because e-learning vendor switching costs are very high, companies tend to conduct thorough vendor evaluations, complete with on-site visits, reference checks, and reviews of sample content – RFPs typically used if high-volume content is needed – May also retain a few (2 or 3) trusted contractors for smaller, one-off learning projects – Big companies and big projects will have long difficult sales cycles ♦ Because of the high perceived risk in selecting an e-learning partner you must come off as a reliable, trusted advisor – Beware of unhappy customers because it is difficult to overcome a poor reputation\n\n50. Vendor Selection It’s a small world: Industry groups and organizations ♦ E-learning professionals from the largest companies are part of a small highly networked group that share information making referral and reputation important – Few RPP’s, cold calls difficult – Generally trusted vendors started out by doing a small piece of work very well – Imperative to not ruin your reputation before it is built Organizations Identified by Interviewees ♦ ASTD – American Society of Training and Development (www.astd.org) – ASTD Benchmarking Forum (http://www.astd.org/astd/Research/benchmarking_forum) ♦ Chief Learning Officer (www.cloevents.com or www.clomedia.com) ♦ Elliott Masie – Industry thought leader (www.masie.com) ♦ ISPI – International Society for Performance Improvement (www.ispi.org) ♦ E-learning Guild (www.elearningguild.com) ♦ Corporate University Exchange (www.corpu.com) ♦ ACM – Association for Computing Machinery (www.acm.org) – eLearn magazine (www.elearnmag.org)\n\n51. Technical Superiority E-learning currently most suited for lower order cognitive skills on Blooms Taxonomy such as knowledge transfer and basic comprehension Learning Objectives Blooms Taxonomy To make judgments, defend Synthesis opinions, and combine information & in different ways to solve problems Evaluation To solve problems in new situations Application by applying previously acquired & Analysis knowledge Knowledge To recall and demonstrate & understanding of facts, terms, basic Comprehension concepts and ideas Trend: As e-learning becomes more interactive and provides the ability to simulate complex work scenarios it will start to be used more and more for higher order skills training\n\n52. Technical Superiority Creating technical superiority to deliver more e-learning training for more complex skills could be a competitive advantage ♦ Enabled by advancements in learning technology – Increased bandwidth – More sophisticated simulations – Advancements in gaming technology including more sophisticated logic trees, graphics and storytelling – “Smart” programs that identify how each individual learner learns best and adapts over time ♦ These advancements are being used more and more to teach higher order cognitive skills – Less complex training is becoming commoditized and is increasingly sent offshore to India – Tecnonexo could develop a unique technical ability as a potential niche and differentiator\n\n53. Evaluation Methodology How corporate training is evaluated: Kirkpatrick Scale Evaluation tools and methods Relevance and Practicality Description and characteristics What they thought and felt Post training surveys or Quick, easy to obtain but time questionnaires consuming to analyze Reaction of the about the training Student The resulting increase in Assessment tests before and Relatively simple to set up for knowledge or capability after the training clear cut quantifiable skills, Learning more difficult for complex learning Extent of behavior and Observation and feedback from Behavioral change requires capability improvement & the manager 90 days later to cooperation of line managers Behavior assess change in behavior and can be time consuming implementation/application Impact assessment via the The effects on the business Very difficult to set up a way management systems already in or environment resulting to directly attribute to training Results place from the trainee's but if possible very effective performance Developing methodologies to help clients measure behavioral change and attributable results of e- learning programs can solve a customer pain, increase sales and become a competitive advantage\n\n54. Evaluation Methodology Creating a sophisticated proprietary methodology for measuring results of e-learning deployments could be a competitive advantage ♦ e-learning most easily justified in budgets when impact can be quantified – Find a niche with measurable business processes (ex. Sales) ♦ Companies historically have viewed training as an employee “benefit” – Need to convince customers that training is an “investment” ♦ Moving down the Kirkpatrick scale to help your customers start measuring behavior and results could be a potential niche\n\n55. V. Tecnonexo’s Competitive Advantage SWOT analysis Lessons learned from U.S. market entry\n\n56. SWOT SWOT Latin America U.S.A. Strengths Strengths ♦ ♦ – Market leader position; reputation and brand – Exchange-rate driven cost advantage name Weaknesses – Experience in various niches – many more ♦ implementations than competition – No reputation or brand name – Ability to act as integrator, managing – Lack of subject matter expertise subcontractors and offering an end-to-end – Technological infrastructure, both internal and solution client-facing – Scale and expertise to handle large projects (e.g. – No in-person sales presence; limited U.S. Argentine IRS) sales experience – Stigma of offshore outsourcing as low-cost (as Weaknesses ♦ opposed to high perceived quality) – Technological infrastructure, both internal and client-facing Opportunities ♦ – End-to-end solutions for smaller companies Opportunities ♦ adopting e-learning for the 1st time – Mexico – Companies previously serviced through – NGOs partner – Trusted provider of custom content to large Threats companies with established e-learning ♦ – Large foreign firm (e.g. Tata) to seriously make a Threats play for the Latin American market ♦ – Disaster affects servers with no backup – Exchange rates change, evaporating cost advantage\n\n57. SWOT SWOT Takeaways ♦ Currently, Tecnonexo has a vastly stronger competitive position in LatAm than in the U.S. ♦ Without differentiating expertise in a particular industry topic or technical aspect, Tecnonexo’s primary strength in the U.S. is its cost advantage ♦ In order to overcome the company’s current competitive disadvantages and establish a foothold in the U.S. market, Tecnonexo should: – Initially focus on small to mid-size U.S. companies who are price-sensitive and currently not offering e-learning – Leverage relationships with LatAm clients who have presence in the U.S. to make contacts, become included in searches – Approach U.S. clients formerly served through partners, as Tecnonexo will have some initial credibility when describing firm capabilities and approach – Use Mexico as a gateway to the U.S. market\n\n58. Partnership Model Growth in the U.S. has been stifled by distance, a lack of a dedicated sales force, and poor partner relationships Key Issues: Barriers to execution: Substantial physical distance between Argentina and U.S. Distance Distance No local presence; difficulty in building consultative client relationships Cultural and language differences No dedicated salespeople “on the ground” in U.S. Sales Force Sales Force Sales force must understand both Latin and U.S. culture AXG regarded by partners as a low-cost, last-minute outsourcing option Partnership Partnership Low visibility, low collaboration, little control focus focus Prevention of building consultative client relationships\n\n59. Partnership Model To move to a higher point in the industry value chain, Tecnonexo must own its client relationships ♦ Discontinue partnership model in order to “own” relationships – Consultative, high perceived quality approach allows for higher fees – “Trusted partner” long-term client relationships represent recurring revenue streams – Cross-sell potential within client organizations Solution Solution ♦ Target acquisition of U.S. firm with strong “front office”, while sourcing technical work to Argentina to capitalize on cost savings – Achieve efficiencies by increasing scale, spreading fixed costs across larger client base and utilizing capacity of Argentine back office – Acquiring U.S. and European-based sales and relationship management functions while maintaining offshore back offices is the model being used by Indian companies such as Tata and NIIT ♦ Build a strong sales force from scratch that is on the ground and able to build the necessary consultative client relationships\n\n61. There are many things to consider when entering the U.S. market ♦ There is no single large U.S. e-learning market; the market is actually comprised of numerous smaller niches ♦ The vast majority of firms are custom content players whose competitive advantage is domain expertise in a specific niche ♦ The most lucrative opportunities are with large companies in general training but less sophisticated 1st customers might be smaller companies or specialized training for a business units ♦ It is a small world of e-learning experts which lowers the cost of sales but makes reputation very important ♦ U.S. market characterized by stricter technical standards and high touch consultative relationships ♦ Most U.S. firms have their own LMS and competition is fierce in this space making it more prudent to focus on custom content ♦ Diversity training issues are on the horizon for major U.S. firms but training in foreign languages is limited ♦ Using Mexico as a stepping stone would make U.S. entry easier ♦ In addition to industry vertical and business process niches, capability and methodology expertise can be a competitive advantage\n\n62. Tecnonexo must improve its technical capabilities and consulting skills to compete effectively in U.S. on anything other than low cost ♦ Phase I: Continue growth with Mexico expansion while developing technical and consulting capabilities (0-18 months) – Use Mexico as a stepping stone to U.S. • Large opportunity, close ties to U.S. market, lower technical expectations, Tecnonexo currently well positioned – Start with small U.S. businesses where Tecnonexo can be a complete solution provider • More price sensitive, less influence in e-learning community, more in line with Tecnonexo’s core competencies ♦ Phase II: Enter the U.S. by targeting a niche and expanding (6-24 months) – Focus on a niche where Tecnonexo can compete with boutique players – Expand to adjacent industry verticals or training functions eventually becoming a consultative integrator\n\n63. Tecnonexo needs to start off as a niche player with domain expertise and slowly build the skills, scale and reputation to be a consultative integrator Biggest firms fall into three categories 1. LMS companies 2. Off the shelf content creators 3. Consultative integrators Firm Revenues Vast majority of firms are custom content niche players whose competitive advantage is domain expertise 1,500 to 2,000 e-learning companies in the U.S. Tecnonexo can’t compete with current U.S. based consultative integrators because they have higher perceived quality and does not want to compete with foreign consultative integrators because that is all about price\n\n64.

Potential specialized content niches identified for further evaluation ♦ Technical ESL – Technical ESL to train employees on technical terms (generally English) that are used globally becoming important (especially for companies that manufacture globally) ♦ Mandatory/compliance training for technology, financial services, or healthcare industries – This is the most attractive niche in the U.S. that would make it a good place to start from a market perspective ♦ Non-corporate market – Governmental, non-governmental and non-profit organizations that need custom content e- learning solutions ♦ Cultural training or localization of content – Position Tecnonexo to capitalize on an emerging trend as the one company that understands different cultural/ethnic backgrounds ♦ Multiple language capability – Address firms that need training in multiple languages and want one service provider addressing all of their language-diversity needs ♦ Minority supplier training programs/Hispanic owned businesses – U.S. based businesses that are predominantly made up of Hispanics that need e-learning solutions\n\n67. Potential capability/methodology niches identified for further evaluation ♦ Technology leader: simulation, storytelling, gaming, etc (example Wisdom Tools) – Creating technical superiority to deliver more e-learning training for more complex skills could be a competitive advantage ♦ Advanced behavior and results measurement methodology – Creating a sophisticated proprietary methodology for measuring results of e-learning deployments could be a competitive advantage\n\n68. Implementation tactics Different sales force requirements in U.S. ♦ – Must have resident sales force that has in-depth knowledge of local e-learning industry and Tecnonexo’s capabilities in order to develop relationships through high touch consulting services Leverage current relationships ♦ – Get introductions from current LatAm multinational customers to sell work in the U.S. – Approach U.S. clients formerly served through partners, as Tecnonexo will have some initial credibility when describing firm capabilities and approach Raise visibility through thought leadership ♦ – Publish white papers, speak at conferences, provide interview to media Penetrate and propagate ♦ – Start with general training (i.e. compliance) at the corporate level and move to more specialized training at the business unit level later – Start off doing simple translation to build the relationship It is a small world ♦ – Leverage initial successes into adjacent industries – Use the small, tight-knit universe of e-learning professionals to get referrals/recommendations – Act as a reliable, trusted advisor rather than simply a vendor • Talk about successes and thought leadership in Latin America Mexico’s unique challenges ♦ – Set up a local office to show commitment to region and provide necessary service, be aware of very hierarchical structure, use chambers to network and build credibility – Explore potential synergies with ILCE (a multilateral organization with presence in LATAM and HQ in Mexico) – they provide most of the content for the Mexican Government – Target transnational's where relationships can be leveraged into the U.S."
