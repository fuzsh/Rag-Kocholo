The Greek mathematician Pythagoras was one of the first to advocate the idea of a spherical earth. Since then, there have been many estimates on the circumference of the earth by those that followed.

        "text": "3.9 Parallels and Meridians\n\nPosition on the surface of the earth is specified using a graticule. A graticule is a network of parallels and meridians, draped over a horizontal datum.\n\nThe Equator is located a 0° Latitude.\n\nParallels are east-west lines that run parallel to the equator, and are equally spaced above and below the equator.\n\nThe Prime Meridian is located a 0° Longitude with an antipodal meridian of 180°.\n\nMeridians are a series of lines that run north-south and pass through the poles. Each opposing pair of meridians form a great circle. A great circle is the circumference of a sphere which equally divides it in half. The equator is also a great circle. However, all other parallels are not since they don’t divide the earth into equal halves.\n\nThe circumference of a sphere is a great circle and divides the earth in half. The equator and every meridian form a great circle. However, a great circle can follow any direction, as long as it divides the earth into equal halves."
