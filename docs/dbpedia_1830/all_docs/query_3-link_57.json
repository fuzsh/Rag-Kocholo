And the analog signal from the K30 is just being converted to a raw voltage. This is because I am doing an external calibration on the sensor , from which I can find a linear equation which converts the analog voltage to a CO2 concentration.\n\nMy question is: Can I use the MKR's default of 3.3V as the reference voltage for converting the signal from both sensors. This is higher than the span of the anemometer's signal, but from what I could tell this may just affect the resolution (though in what manner I do not know)? Do I use one of the lower internal built in references and add more resistance to the K30? Is there a logical way to determine which sensor should I cater to (aside from which is more important for my application) ?\n\nThanks!"
