A second trainload of foodstuffs, said to have been presented by the British army in Italy to the people in Vienna, arrived in that city on Thursday. According to the cable advices, the food was most acceptable, particularly because while it was on the way, the situation in that important centre had rapidly become worse. One of the most interesting announcements during the week regarding financial matters in Berlin was the resignation of Arthur von Gwinner as managing director of the Deutsche Bank. According to the cable, the resignation will take effect March 31. Herr von Gwinner was a member of the Prussian House of Lords, but is said to have taken little part in politics. For 25 years, however, he was director of the Bank and had been identified with banking interests in Berlin for 46 years. [VoL. 108. Rates on high density cotton were dropped by American authorities from $4 50 to $1 25 per 100 lbs. from South Atlantic ports to Liverpool and United Kingdom ports. Yesterday these various reductions were supplemented by cuts by the United States Shipping Board, effective immediately and applying as of Jan. 33, in rates from South Atlantic ports to England of approximately 60%, and from Gulf ports about 64%. To the surface observer this has meant the renewal of a wholesale rate war and unrestricted competition between Great Britain and the United States for trade and for trans-Atlantic traffic. Whatever else may be true, it is perfectly obvious that Great Britain must be counted on to protect her own trade as far as possible, and to endeavor to offset the great balance in favor of the United States, by reason of the enormous purchases in this country during the war.

But the boatmen, having had the twelve-hour day for six months barely, now demand an eight-hour, meaning, indubitably, to use that, as in the revolt of the.railway brotherhoods in 1918, as a means of getting more money per \"over-time.\" The owners say they want the men to live comfortably and are willing to arbitrate all wage questions \"in spite of the manifest absurdity of the demands,\" but that the eight-hour day has no application to this case. These men, on duty over eight hours, work less than eight. The captain of a canal boat or barge lives on board with his family, actually working less than two hours a day; corresponding men on a tug do not average six hours, the boat passing the time mostly in awaiting orders or weather conditions; further, the men get their meals supplied, and the time at eating counts in the twelve hours. There is a physical impossibility also, since an eight-hour day on coal boats and barges would compel three crews and three captains, whereas there is room on board for only one captain and one family, and no more could be provided for. So, say the owners, \"we cannot agree to arbitrate a condition which we would be unable to fulfill if the award were adverse to us.\" Finally, said the boat owners six weeks ago, \"the time has now come to stop the pyramiding of artificial conditions induced by the war; it is not difficult to recognize that a period of readjustment is at hand; mounting costs and impracticable working conditions, if pyramided indefinitely, will only add confusion and peril to the resumption of normal business relations.\" Is not this both sound and timely? Certainly every thinking person must desire \"resumption of normal business relations,\" and though some courage may be required for standing firm (as the boat owners say) we only heighten trouble by putting off the grapple with it. Is not the lesson clear in respect to all the country's business and industrial problems? OUR FOREIGN TRADE IN 1918. Another twelve-month period of marvelously large foreign trade aggregates has passed to the credit of the United States. A year in which inflated prices for commodities were so potent a factor that despite a smaller quantitative outflow of goods, due largely to various restrictive measures put in force by the Government, the total of exports reached a value approximating very closely the, record aggregate of 1917, and the imports actually established a new high mark. Furthermore, the cessation of hostilities abroad has not yet served to contract the volume outflow of goods. In fact the freeing of tonnage from transport service the latter part of November and the gradual lifting of embargo measures resulted in a total of merchandise exports in December in excess of all earlier monthly periods except January, June and December of 1917. The year opened with the value of the merchandise outflow showing a somewhat marked contraction compared with the preceding year and this continued for six months. In July, August and September, with the shipments of breadstuffs and 413 provisions showing very great expansion, new high records for the particular months covered were in each instance established, but in October the outflow dropped below that of the period in the previous year. For the reason already referred to, however, there was an augmentation in the outflow in November and December, a new high mark for the former month having been established, and the result for the full twelve months approaches very close to the phenomenally heavy total reached in 1917. It is, of course, understood that we have reference to the exports as represented by value and not quantitatively, as only a partial analysis could be made in the latter way, weights or measures being lacking in very many cases. One point, however, must not be lost sight of and that is that higher prices have been an important factor in building up the year's aggregate of export values. It does not follow that there has been a universal appreciation in the export prices of commodities. The exceptions, however, are few and as a rule unimportant. On the other hand, the advances in many cases have been decidedly heavy. Confining ourselves to what may be called representative commodities we note that the average export price of corn in 1918 was about $1 56 per bushel, against $1 40 in 1917; wheat $2 34, against $2 31, and rye, $2 05, against $1 923/; flour, per barrel, $11 27, 2 against $9 94; bituminious coal $3 93 per ton, against $3 72; cotton, 31.8c per lb., against 23.2c.; gunpowder, 78c per lb., against 74.3c; bar steel, 5c, against 4.14c; wire nails, 5.5c and 4.7c; galvanized steel sheets, 8.1c and 6.8c; other steel sheets, 7.1c and 5.6c; steel rails, $57 42 per ton, against $46 93; tin plates, 9.8c per lb. and 8c; sole leather, 51c and 49.3c; canned beef, 36.4c and 27.9c; fresh beef, 21.3c and 14.6c; bacon, 28.6c and 21.2c; hams and shoulders, 27.1c and 22.2c; lard, 26.4c and 20.2c, butter, 39.7c and 37c; crude mineral oil, 5.97c per gallon, against 4.45c, illuminating oil, 10.2c and 7.44c; gasoline, naphtha, &c., 24.9c and 22.4c; lubricating oil, 29.3c and 20.5c; cottonseed oil, 19.4c and 13.9c, and leaf tobacco, 30.5c and 17.9c. It is not necessary to pursue this phase of the subject any further. Suffice it to say that chemicals, lumber, cement, fruits and nuts, cotton goods, glassware, hides, hops, hay, &c., &c., could be. included in the list if necessary to make it more inclusive and conclusive. As in all years since the breaking out of the war in Europe the phenomenal proportions of our export trade find explanation in that circumstance. But if in the preceding years the gain in outflow was chiefly to the Allied countries involved, so in 1918 the loss is much more than covered by the decline in shipments to Russia, a former member of the alliance. Our exports to the United Kingdom, which at 2,009 million dollars in 1917 were well above those for 1916, rose to about 2,061 millions in 1918. The Belgian total advanced from 56 millions in 1917 to 155 millions in 1918, and the Italian from 419 millions to over 492 millions. On the other hand, the outflow to European Russia fell from 3153 millions to only about 9 millions—a comparatively nominal figure— and noticeable contraction is to be observed in the totals for Denmark, Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Sweden. Collectively, therefore, the result for Europe as a whole is a falling off of some 203 millions, notwithstanding the higher prices obtained for most of the commodities sent, and consequently indica- 414 THE CHRONICLE [VoL. 108. ting a proportionately greater quantitative decline. expansion was in cotton and tobacco, and in the Elsewhere expansion was quite the rule in quantity second barley, wheat flour, bacon, fresh beef and as well as in value.
