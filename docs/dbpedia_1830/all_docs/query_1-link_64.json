The Corbusier-inspired architecture of white concrete designed by Henri-Edouard Ciriani is subtly built onto the brick château through which visitors enter. The Historial of the Great War Musuem was selected among the twenty ‘Major Cultural Projects in France’ of the time for the quality of its architecture.\n\nThis trilingual (English, French, German) museum is neither a memorial nor a military museum but a cultural museum which seeks to show how the lives of combatants and civilians were drastically modified by the war.\n\nLocated on the very site of the Battle of the Somme in 1916 and the Battle of Picardy in 1918, the Historial of the Great War Musuem attempts to provide keys for understanding these events in all their dimensions and in so doing, to encourage reflection on the consequences of these battles, and the material traces which survive today.\n\nChâteau de Péronne\n\nBP 20063\n\n80201 Peronne\n\nTel: +33 (0)3 22 83 14\n\nEmail: info@historical.org\n\nMuseum of the Battle of Fromelles\n\nThe Battle of Fromelles took place on 19th and 20th July 1916 and opposed British and Australian divisions to a Bavarian division. The shock was terrible, within 24 hours, there were nearly 8,500 victims. Many of the soldiers who died on the battlefield could not be found.\n\nIn 2009, a team of archaeologists uncovered the bodies of 250 British and Australian soldiers missing at Fromelles. A serious campaign of identification began, and with each restored identity, it is the story of one soldier that rises to the surface.\n\nFollow the battle, the archaeological research and the history of fallen soldiers through the permanent exhibition.

It is an object of great aesthetic and symbolic power, evoking the mass death which occurred on the battlefields of this region between 1914 and 1918.\n\nWellington Tunnels/Carriere Wellington, Arras\n\nImpressiove underground chalk quarries had been dug in the south suburb of Arras since the Middle Ages. From 1916, a network of galleries were set up by the New Zealand tunnelers, to link the quarries together and get closer to the German positions. Gathered within this secret base, over 20 000 soldiers from all over the world emerged from the underground just a few meters from German positions, in the morning of 9th April 1917.\n\n9th April — annual dawn ceremony\n\nOn 9th April, at 6.30 am, a tribte is paid to the soldiers of the Commonwealth, at the foot of the Battle of Arras memorial wall.\n\nOpening hours: daily 10.00am to 12.30pm and 1.30pm to 6.00pm.

The Tower is more specifically regarded as a memorial to the Officers and Men of the 36th (Ulster) Division and of the Sons of Ulster in other forces, who laid down their lives, and of all their Comrades-in-Arms, who, by Divine Grace, were spared to testify to their glorious deeds.- its position on the battlefield is a permanent reminder of the Division’s heroic charge at the Battle of the Somme on the opening day of that great offensive.\n\nThe Ulster Memorial Tower is lived in during the year by Somme Association staff and is open from 1st March until 30th November, Tuesday to Sunday daily, 10am until 5pm.

The German offensive of 1914 captured many of the forts of the Séré de Rivières, which were then used by them as bases. The Fort de la Pompelle was surrendered to the Germans without a fight on 4th September 1914. However, this was a short-lived occupation as, following the First Battle of the Marne (5th-12th Sept 1914), the fort was retaken by the French 138th Infantry after a fierce struggle.\n\nIt houses interesting exhibits from the Imperial Russian Regiments that served in the sector in 1916 and 1917 and sent by Tsar Nicholas II.\n\nAlso displayed is the magnificent Charles Friese's collection of German Army Headgear — Picklehaube — with over 560 displayed.\n\nThe fort and and exhibits are well worth a visit.\n\nOpen daily from 1st April to 30th September from 10.00am to 6.00pm (except Mondays) and from 1st October to 31st March from 10.00am to 5.00pm (except Monday). Yearly closure on 1 May, 14 July, 1 November and from mid-December to mid-January.\n\nFree entry the first Sunday of each month and on 1st August and 11th November.\n\nRD 944, route de Châlons-en-Champagne\n\nReims - Puisieulx\n\nTél: +33 (0)3 26 49 11 85\n\nWilfred Owen — The Forresters House\n\nIt was the 31st October 1918 when Owen and his battalion (2nd Manchesters) reached Pommereuil, about 2 miles north-east of Le Cateau. (It had been taken just a week before by two sister battalions of the Manchesters). A Field Ambulance unit had originally been established in the house from which wounded were sent on to Le Cateau and beyond. It also had to deal with many French civilians who were in a very feeble condition because of age, food shortages, illness and gas poisoning.\n\nBy the time Wilfred Owen arrived, the Ambulance unit had moved on. During the early evening of the 31st, surrounded by sleeping officers, including his Company Commander, officers’ servants and some battalion HQ personnel, he wrote his last letter from the cellar in this house. At that time he felt he was out of danger. But there was danger to come and he died on the nearby banks of the Sambre-Oise canal at Ors on 4th November. The ventilation grille to the cellar can been seen just to the left of the bush.\n\nThe all-white house appears like a ‘bleached bone’ as Simon Patterson described it. You walk up a ramp into a large space, lit from above. Owen’s poem Dulce et Decorum Est is etched on a translucent skin of glass which covers the four walls. It is in Owen's handwriting, taken from his manuscript which is now in the British Library. As you stand there, the lights dim and you hear the voice of Kenneth Branagh reading 12 of Owen’s poems, which he recorded for Radio 4 in 1993 to commemorate Owen’s birth in 1893. The poems appear on the walls, and you hear some of them in French. In between there is silence. It lasts one hour; you can leave at any time or hear all of the poems which include Strange Meeting and Dulce et Decorum Est.\n\nIt’s a powerful place. Unlike other museums centered around war, there are no artefacts, no tanks, no bombs, no arms. Just one room and a poetry reading.\n\nOpen daily (except Tuesdays) 2.00pm-4.00pm (with daily longer hours during the summer)\n\nWilfred Owen Memorial\n\nD959 (the memorial is found on the right hand side of the road, by the Camp Militaire)\n\nOrs\n\nClick on the house for more details about the that and on Wilfred Owen's portrait to connect with the Wilfred Owen Society.\n\nThe Tank of Flesquières\n\nFollowing the discovery, the tank was first planned to be placed in a barn in the village. However, it soon appeared the proposed building was far too small. As an immediate measure, it was decided and agreed between the Mayor of Flesquieres and Philippe Gorczynski to store the tank in the courtyard of the Mayor’s farm. That situation lasted for nearly two years and was not satisfactory, the tank being covered by a tarpaulin and suffering from heavy condensation. Philippe then searched for a suitable location. And after several possibilities, he chose a large open sided barn.\n\nThe tank is now preserved in that barn standing on a base made of granite cobbles given by the Town of Cambrai which came from some of its old streets. It was carefully moved there by a group of expert soldiers from 118 REME Company who spent two days on the project and used three large cranes and a heavy multi-wheeled trailer.\n\nTo arrange a visit please contact by email: visite.org@tank-cambrai.com\n\nTank Museum, Saumur\n\nFormed initially from Second World War tanks which had been accumulating since 1950 at the AMX factory in Satory, the collection of armoured vehicles assembled in Saumur today numbers 880 vehicles of which almost 200 are in complete working order.\n\nFor 80 years, armoured vehicles have formed the spearhead of the modern army. The museum traces their birth, their history, their technical evolution throughout the world from 1917 until today.\n\nThe museum contains examples of the most important armoured vehicles from the principal industrialised countries: France, USA, Germany, UK, Italy, Sweden, Portugal, Israel, Brazil, countries from the former USSR. In its entirety, the exhibition constitutes the most complete collection of armoured vehicles in the world, both for the number of vehicles and for the continuous historic panorama exhibited, beginning with the appearance of the tank on the battlefield.\n\nWith a few rare exceptions, there is an example of each prototype to have undergone trials and each type of armoured vehicle used by the French Army since 1917.\n\nOpen every day from 10.00am to 6.00pm.

From the beginning of the Great War the towers were used by French troops to observe German positions on Lorette Spur and Vimy Ridge. The suspicions of the French soldiers were aroused when Germans fired upon their every movement until it was realized that what was giving them away was not a spy but the birds nesting on the towers which took flight when troops disturbed them.\n\nIn 1915 heavy shelling truncated the towers, reducing their height from fifty-three to forty-four metres. In 1921 they were finally listed on France's register of ancient monuments. Purchased by Pas-de-Calais Council in 2004, the towers have since undergone much-needed works to consolidate their structure.\n\nHarnes, Museum of History and Archaeology\n\nRoom of remembrance. This room was founded by local veterans of World War I in 1925. Conscious of the importance of remembering those dreadful times, they decided to collect all sorts of military objects (helmets, medals, weapons, photographs, etc) which they kept in a room owned by the council and opened to the public on Remembrance Day.\n\nThe Collections: The museum is composed of several rooms relating to the two world wars, the resistance and deportation. It also contains four rooms devoted to archaeology. The collections presented in these rooms have been added to by donations from mainly local people. These collections are both rich and varied and include weapons, items of artillery, uniforms, propaganda bills, archives, everyday objects, works of art, documents, etc.\n\nOpen Wednesdays from 10.00am to 12.00noon and from 3.00pm to 6.00pm and Saturdays from 3.00pm to 6.00pm.\n\nMusée d’Histoire et d’Archéologie\n\n50 rue André Déprez\n\n62440 Harnes\n\nTel: +33 (0)3 21 49 02 29\n\nEmail available via website.\n\nThe Armistice Carriage, Compiègne\n\nCarriage 2419D belonging to the Compagnie des Wagons Lits is traditionally known as the Armistice Wagon. It was requisitioned by the army in 1918 and it was in the carriage that the Armistice was signed.\n\nIn 1921 it was taken to Les Invalides in Paris where it remained for 6 years. It was then installed in the Armistice Glade in a shelter in 1927.\n\nAdolf Hitler used the same carriage for the French Surrender in the Second World War and in June 1940 it was removed to Berlin to be exhibited. It was destroyed in 1945 during an air raid.\n\nAn identical carriage was found and refited as it had been in 1918. It is housed undercover and there is an associated museum and in the grounds various artefacts, such a field guns, can be found.\n\nThe Museum is open from 15th September to April, every day except Tuesday from 10am to 5.30pm, and from April to 15th September, every day from 10am to 6pm.\n\nGPS: Longitdue 49 42 917° Latitude 002 90 576°\n\nMusée de l' Armistice\n\nroute de Soissons\n\n60200 Compiegne\n\nTel and Fax: +33 (0)3 44 85 14 18\n\nEmail: wagon.armistice@wanadoo.fr\n\nBelleau Remembrance Museum\n\nIn the heart of Belleau village, the Remembrance Museum perpetuates the American and French soldiers involved in terrific fights where so many of them were killed.\n\nEntering the museum, a permanent exhibition presents the American Military Cemetery, its chapel erected on the site of a trench, Belleau wood called the wood of the Marine Brigade.

The cavern was more than just a makeshift shelter. In fact it quickly became a strategic military location. One of the legends that may have inspired the Germans to call it the Dragon's Cavern is the presence of weapons at each of the seven entrances, ready to breathe fire like a seven-headed dragon.\n\nDuring the war, former stone quarries were often converted for use by the army, particularly in the Aisne plateaux in the Soisson region. When German soldiers won the Caverne du Dragon from the French, they gained the upper hand. The Cavern was a strategic location, from which surprise attacks and retreats could be made on the Chemin des Dames, a ridge road overlooking the Aisne and Ailette valleys. Protected from the cold, despite the severe dampness, the Germans converted the Cavern into a veritable barracks with sniper positions and electricity. While the dead were piling up in the trenches, the Germans were creating an extensive camp in the underground galleries, including dormitories, a chapel, a well, a first-aid station and even a cemetery. In addition to serving as protection against gunfire and gas attacks, the stone walls were adorned with the souvenirs of the soldiers at rest, such as drawings and messages written in candle soot and other engravings. To while away the time, some soldiers carved objects from bullets and spent shells.\n\nOn 25th June 25 1917, shortly after the tragic failure of the Nivelle Offensive, French soldiers scored a victory by taking back the Caverne du Dragon. Little by little, they pushed the Germans deeper into the cavern. From July to October 1917, the two enemy camps set up their internal borders, each side on constant guard against surprise attacks. The slightest noise in the cavern could mean the enemy was sneaking up.\n\nOpening times 10.00am - 6.00pm from September to June. Closed on Tuesday mornings.\n\nIn July and August open between 10.00am and 7.00pm.\n\nOpen on public holidays.\n\nClosed from 17 December to 17 January.\n\nLa Caverne du Dragon, Musée du Chemin des Dames\n\nChemin des Dames - RD 18 CD\n\n02160 Oulches-la-Vallée-Foulon\n\nTel: +33 (0)3 23 25 14 18\n\nFax: +33 (0)3 23 25 14 11\n\nEmail : caverne@cg02.fr\n\nMemorial to the Battles of the Marne, Dormans\n\nThe Memorial is situated on the left bank of the Marne on a hill overlooking the river and the town of Dormans. When the plan to erect a large monument to remember all of the battles in Marne was confirmed, this site was chosen by Marshal Foch as a place that represented both battles.\n\nThe inside of the chapel is entirely dedicated to the glory of the “soldiers, the army and the fatherland\".\n\nThe stained-glass window in the choir represents Christ welcoming a soldier to symbolise all those who died during the Great War, presented to him by Joan of Arc and St Michael. On each side, angels intercede in his favour. The stained-glass windows at the sides of the transept (by the renowned Lorin firm in Chartres) represent the patron saints of the different branches of the army. The four columns standing on the crypt’s vaulted bases are decorated with sculptures depicting the four great invasions of France by the Huns, the Arabs, the English and the Germans, which were all contained (the Catalunian Plains in 451, Poitiers in 732, Orleans in 1429 and Dormans 1914-1918).\n\nOpen from 1st April to 11th November every day from 2.00 to 6.00pm and Sundays from 10.00am to 12.00pm and 2.00 to 6.00pm.\n\nMemorial to the Battles of the Marne\n\navenue des victoires\n\n51700 Dormans\n\nTel: +33 (0)3 26 59 14 18\n\nOssuary of Navarin\n\nLocated near the old Navarin Farms on the West side of the road off of D977 near D220 Monument This large pyramid type structure, topped with the statue of three soldiers, was built to honor the dead of the Armies of Champagne of which four were American divisions.
