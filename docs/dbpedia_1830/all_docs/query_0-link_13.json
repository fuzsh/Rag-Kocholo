        "text": "4. Grounds Insufficient to Warrant New Trial\n\nHarmless error. - When it affirmatively appears that error has not resulted in injury, no new trial will be granted therefor; and in determining whether error has resulted in injury, court may look to record as a whole. Shefton v. State, 52 Ga. App. 103 , 182 S.E. 528 (1935).\n\nBecause the trial court's admission of prejudicial hearsay testimony regarding the victim's ministry ordination certificates was harmless error, given the overwhelming evidence of the defendant's guilt, a voluntary manslaughter conviction, as a lesser-included offense of murder, was upheld on appeal; hence, defendant's motion for a new trial was properly denied. Smith v. State, 283 Ga. App. 722 , 642 S.E.2d 399 (2007).\n\nComments by judge during defense counsel's closing argument did not constitute plain error. - Under a plain error analysis, there was no violation of O.C.G.A. § 17-8-57 in defendant's criminal trial because the trial judge's comments were limited in scope, were for the purpose of controlling the trial conduct and ensuring a fair trial, did not involve the issue of defendant's guilt or innocence, and did not express an opinion on the evidence as to what was proved or not; comments by the trial court judge during defendant's counsel's closing arguments were for the purpose of preventing misstatements to the jury concerning matters not in evidence and were not improper under O.C.G.A. § 17-8-75 , and denial of defendant's new trial motion under O.C.G.A. § 5-5-25 was proper. Mathis v. State, 276 Ga. App. 205 , 622 S.E.2d 857 (2005).\n\nComments by trial judge. - Because the trial court did not make improper comments about the defendant's credibility, in violation of O.C.G.A. § 17-8-57 , but only directed the defendant to answer the questions being asked, and expressed no opinion as to the truthfulness of the defendant's testimony, whether responsive or not, those comments did not warrant a new trial. Anthony v. State, 282 Ga. App. 457 , 638 S.E.2d 877 (2006).\n\nTrial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial on the ground that the trial judge made comments which unduly highlighted and overemphasized the testimony of the DNA expert, in violation of O.C.G.A. § 17-8-57 , as the comments were clearly directed at one juror to encourage that juror to stay awake and pay attention to the presentation of the evidence. Carruth v. State, 286 Ga. App. 431 , 649 S.E.2d 557 (2007).\n\nActions involving the trial judge did not warrant new trial. - Defendant was not entitled to a new trial merely because the order appointing the senior judge under O.C.G.A. § 15-1-9.1(b)(2) was defective as that issue was raised for the first time in the new trial motion, which precluded appellate review; moreover, a new trial was not warranted due to a comment made by the sentencing judge, that could have been interpreted as an expression of the trial court's disapproval of the defendant's conduct, and such did not amount to an outright statement of bias. Williams v. State, 290 Ga. App. 829 , 661 S.E.2d 563 (2008).\n\nVenue sufficiently established. - Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for new trial after the defendant was convicted of rape because venue was sufficiently established by a detective's testimony that the apartment complex where the crimes occurred was in DeKalb County, and even accepting the defendant's argument that the evidence only supported the conclusion that the victim could have been driven into another county before the rape occurred, that would not preclude a jury's conclusion that venue could be proper in DeKalb County; because the most definite testimony regarding the location of the crimes related to DeKalb County, the jury was authorized to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the rape could have occurred there. Bizimana v. State, 311 Ga. App. 447 , 715 S.E.2d 754 (2011).\n\nStanding. - Father was not entitled to a new trial on a termination of rights petition filed by the Department of Family and Children Services, as the father failed to legitimate the child at issue, and hence, lacked standing to challenge the termination of parental rights order. In the Interest of J.L.E., 281 Ga. App. 805 , 637 S.E.2d 446 (2006).\n\nDefendant's absence, due to lack of diligence. - It is no ground for new trial that the defendant, through lack of diligence, failed to be present upon call of case. Diprima v. Hicks, 89 Ga. App. 231 , 79 S.E.2d 8 (1953).\n\nEvidence properly admitted. - Convictions for driving under the influence of drugs and to the extent that the defendant was a less-safe driver were upheld on appeal as supported by sufficient evidence, given that the defendant drove erratically, manifested signs of impairment, and had three drugs in the defendant's system; hence, when coupled with the fact that no evidence of tampering with the defendant's urine sample was submitted, the trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in admitting the sample and in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial. Kelly v. State, 281 Ga. App. 432 , 636 S.E.2d 143 (2006).\n\nDefendant's amended motion for a new trial was properly denied, and an aggravated assault conviction was upheld on appeal, as the trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in admitting three photographs depicting the victim's knife wounds; the photographs were not inadmissible merely because the photographs also showed alterations to the victim's body made by medical personnel. McRae v. State, 282 Ga. App. 852 , 640 S.E.2d 323 (2006), cert. denied, 2007 Ga. LEXIS 200 (Ga. 2007).\n\nBecause evidence of the defendant's prior drug use, and history of crimes committed against family members fueled by the drug usage, were properly admitted as relevant to the crime's charged, despite incidentally placing the defendant's character in issue, convictions for both aggravated assault and simple assault were upheld on appeal; moreover, even if the trial court erred by admitting this motive evidence, no reversible error resulted which required a new trial. Jones v. State, 283 Ga. App. 812 , 642 S.E.2d 887 (2007).\n\nDefendant's motion for a new trial was properly denied, as the evidence presented against the defendant was legally sufficient, similar transaction evidence was correctly admitted, and the fact that portions of the methamphetamine found, as a result of a search warrant was not tested, was not reversible error. Perry v. State, 283 Ga. App. 520 , 642 S.E.2d 141 (2007).\n\nIn a prosecution for armed robbery and robbery by intimidation, the trial court did not err in admitting a copy of the defendant's fingerprint card, pursuant to former O.C.G.A. §§ 24-3-14 and 24-5-26 (see now O.C.G.A. §§ 24-8-803 and 24-10-1003 ), despite the defendant's claim that the testifying witness lacked personal knowledge with regard to the circumstances or time of the creation or transmission of the fingerprint card, as the card itself showed that the card was created and transmitted at the time of the defendant's arrest, and was handled in the gathering agency's regular and routine course of business; hence, the defendant was properly denied a new trial. Tubbs v. State, 283 Ga. App. 578 , 642 S.E.2d 205 (2007).\n\nWhile the state conceded that the trial court's instruction on prior consistent statements was incorrect, a new trial was not required because the statements in question were admitted, not as prior consistent statements, but as admissions by the defendant, and were introduced into evidence by the state as substantive evidence of the defendant's guilt. Hampton v. State, 282 Ga. 490 , 651 S.E.2d 698 (2007).\n\nWhile the state conceded that the trial court's instruction on prior consistent statements was incorrect, a new trial was not required because the statements in question were admitted, not as prior consistent statements, but as admissions by the defendant, and were introduced into evidence by the state as substantive evidence of the defendant's guilt. Hampton v. State, 282 Ga. 490 , 651 S.E.2d 698 (2007).\n\nAs sufficient evidence supported the defendant's convictions, and no reversible error resulted from either the admission of the defendant's two prior convictions for both impeachment and sentencing purposes or based on the jury instructions given or refused, a new trial on these issues was unwarranted. Newsome v. State, 289 Ga. App. 590 , 657 S.E.2d 540 (2008), cert. denied, No. S08C1042, 2008 Ga. LEXIS 494 (Ga. 2008).\n\nTrial court did not err in admitting evidence of the defendant's 1993 interference with government property conviction; a new trial was properly denied, because the evidence was properly admitted, not as substantive evidence of the offense at issue, but only as to the issue of credibility, providing support for the evidence's admission. Tate v. State, 289 Ga. App. 479 , 657 S.E.2d 531 (2008), cert. denied, No. S08C0986, 2008 Ga. LEXIS 386 (Ga. 2008).\n\nCounsel's failure to appear for trial or notify client is insufficient ground to authorize new trial. Haralson County Economic Dev. Corp. v. Hammock, 233 Ga. 381 , 211 S.E.2d 278 (1974).\n\nContesting sufficiency of indictment. - In a prosecution for burglary, because the variance between the indictment and the proof presented at trial did not misinform or mislead the defendant in any manner that resulted in surprise or impaired a defense, and the defendant could not be subjected to another prosecution for the same offense, the alleged variance was not fatal; as a result, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motions for a directed verdict or for a new trial. Chambers v. State, 284 Ga. App. 400 , 643 S.E.2d 871 (2007).\n\nBecause the appeals court rejected the defendant's claim that the accusation failed to adequately charge venue, as a charge of DUI incorporated the words \"Henry County\" in the heading by using the phrase \"as prosecuting attorney for the county and state aforesaid\" in the body of the accusation, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant a new trial on that charge; but the court warned the state against such practice, as the solicitor could easily devise forms which stated with clarity the county in which the offense allegedly occurred, and thereby avoid the costs which resulted from having to repeatedly defend the type of challenge the defendant raised. Gordy v. State, 287 Ga. App. 459 , 651 S.E.2d 471 (2007), cert. denied, No. S07C1866, 2008 Ga. LEXIS 128 (Ga. 2008).\n\nAlthough the trial court might not have been presented with evidence that the defendant was in physical possession of a firearm during the hijacking of the victim's car, because the evidence that was presented authorized a finding that the defendant was a party to that crime, and that all those involved were joint conspirators, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant a new trial on grounds that the indictment charging possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony was at fatal variance with the proof presented at trial. Davis v. State, 287 Ga. App. 786 , 653 S.E.2d 104 (2007).\n\nEffective assistance of counsel. - Defendant's motion for a new trial was properly denied because the defendant did not establish that the defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel. Defendant was aware of all of the charges against the defendant, the defendant did not inform counsel that there were jurors that the defendant wished to have stricken, it was sound trial strategy to not cross-examine the witness because the witness's testimony would have hurt the defendant, counsel did not request a charge on the voluntariness of the defendant's confession because it contradicted the defense of coercion, the evidence adequately demonstrated that the defendant was intoxicated when the defendant committed the assault and robbery, and the discrepancy in the victim's testimony regarding the car the perpetrator drove was not material since the defendant confessed to the crime. Blocker v. State, 265 Ga. App. 846 , 595 S.E.2d 654 (2004).\n\nOn appeal from two child molestation convictions, the defendant was properly denied a new trial, because the admission of privileged testimony was not erroneous, and trial counsel was not ineffective by: (a) ignoring a consent order barring the state from introducing any written or oral admissions or statements the defendant made before and after a polygraph examination; (b) failing to assert the attorney-client privilege with respect to a polygraph expert's testimony; and (c) failing to adequately prepare a second polygraph expert who testified for the defense at trial; in fact, (1) counsel neither ignored the consent order nor performed deficiently when stipulating to the admission of the polygraph results; and (2) even assuming that counsel was deficient in failing to consult the defendant regarding the attorney-client privilege, the defendant failed to show a reasonable probability that the result would have been different in the absence of the second expert's cumulative testimony. Adesida v. State, 280 Ga. App. 764 , 634 S.E.2d 880 (2006).\n\nDefendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims lacked merit, as the appeals court found that the trial counsel's tactical decision not to call the defendant's brother and sister-in-law as witnesses was strategic, and nothing in the record suggested that the defendant was denied a fair trial because trial counsel did not investigate the defendant's competency; hence, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant a new trial based on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Scott v. State, 281 Ga. App. 106 , 635 S.E.2d 582 (2006).\n\nIn denying the defendant a new trial, the trial court expressly found that trial counsel was not ineffective, specifically finding that: (1) counsel's decision not to provide the defendant with a copy of the discovery was based on the fact that the defendant could not read and was going to rely on someone else at the jail to read the documents, and that counsel was concerned that showing the discovery to another inmate might produce a \"snitch;\" and (2) prior to trial, counsel spent two and a half hours with the defendant going over the state's evidence. Hence, the trial court concluded that counsel had a good reason for not giving the defendant a copy of the discovery, and that counsel was exceptionally effective in representing the defendant's interests. White v. State, 281 Ga. 20 , 635 S.E.2d 720 (2006).\n\nTrial court did not err in denying the defendant a new trial on grounds that the defendant's trial counsel was ineffective, as the defendant failed to show that the outcome of the trial would have been different if counsel would have: (1) filed a motion for funds to hire an expert on the reliability of cross-racial eyewitness identification and proffer what the testimony of this expert would have been; (2) verified that funds had been withdrawn from the respective ATM machines on the date of the crime or ascertain whether surveillance cameras might have refuted the state's evidence that the defendant was in the carjacked vehicle; and (3) proffered favorable testimony that the defendant alleged could have been provided by the two victims suggesting complicity. Pringle v. State, 281 Ga. App. 230 , 635 S.E.2d 843 (2006).\n\nAs the jury could have found the defendant guilty after listening to the state's witnesses, a psychologist testimony regarding the defendant's competency did not influence the outcome of the trial; hence, defense counsel's failure to object to the psychologist raising the issue about the defendant's mental health was harmless, part of counsel's reasonable trial strategy, and did not amount to the ineffective assistance of counsel entitling the defendant to a new trial. Griffin v. State, 281 Ga. App. 249 , 635 S.E.2d 853 (2006).\n\nIn a prosecution for trafficking in cocaine, the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on the affirmative defense of entrapment, as: (1) sufficient evidence was presented that the defendant voluntarily committed the offense upon being given the opportunity to do so; and (2) no evidence was presented to show that the informant employed undue persuasion, incitement or deceit to induce the defendant into selling drugs; thus, the defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to present evidence to support an entrapment defense was rejected and did not warrant a new trial. Campbell v. State, 281 Ga. App. 503 , 636 S.E.2d 687 (2006).\n\nIn a prosecution for armed robbery, possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, and obstruction, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial based on allegations that trial counsel was ineffective, as: (1) a jury charge on the testimony of an accomplice was not required; and (2) in light of trial counsel's cross-examination of the accomplice, the court's credibility charge, as well as the overwhelming evidence of the defendant's guilt, a leniency instruction was unnecessary. Hayes v. State, 281 Ga. App. 749 , 637 S.E.2d 128 (2006).\n\nIn a prosecution for rape, kidnapping, and sodomy, the defendant did not receive the ineffective assistance of trial counsel merely because counsel failed to impeach the victim's credibility with evidence concerning a 1996 drug arrest, as: (1) the evidence was irrelevant to the circumstances surrounding the defendant's attack on the victim; and (2) the victim never opened the door to an issue of good character; hence, the defendant failed to show that a new trial should have been ordered. Pierce v. State, 281 Ga. App. 821 , 637 S.E.2d 467 (2006).\n\nCounsel's trial strategy in failing to object to hearsay from a non-testifying codefendant was supported by a decision that the testimony was more beneficial than prejudicial, and that the complained-of testimony was necessary to refute the state's theory that the gun admitted against the defendant could have thrown from the defendant's car; moreover, because the defendant failed to show that but for the admission of that evidence, the outcome of the trial would have been different, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant a new trial on this ground. Ross v. State, 281 Ga. App. 891 , 637 S.E.2d 491 (2006).\n\nAppellate court rejected the defendant's contention that trial counsel was ineffective: (1) in failing to investigate another molestation charge filed against the defendant; (2) by failing to interview the defendant's mother; (3) in not investigating the state's failure to obtain a warrant to determine whether the defendant's computer contained or could access pornographic material; (4) by referring to the defendant's prior criminal record on DUI charges; (5) in introducing several letters from the defendant's daughter into evidence; and (6) by characterizing the defendant in closing argument as guilty of drunken and boorish behavior, as the trial court was authorized to believe counsel's testimony regarding counsel's sufficient preparation for trial, and finding that without a proffer of evidence concerning the defendant's computer, the defendant could not show a reasonable probability that the results of the proceedings would have been different; hence, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant a new trial on grounds that trial counsel was ineffective. Carey v. State, 281 Ga. App. 816 , 637 S.E.2d 757 (2006).\n\nTrial court properly denied the defendant's motion for a new trial, which alleged the ineffective assistance of counsel, as mere allegations, without evidence explaining how trial counsel's alleged failures affected the outcome of the trial, could not support the claims and counsel's trial tactics amounted to trial strategy. Slaughter v. State, 282 Ga. App. 276 , 638 S.E.2d 417 (2006).\n\nBecause there was nothing in the record to rebut the presumption that trial counsel had legitimate reasons for the strategic decisions made during the trial, specifically relating to concerns regarding a juror's dismissal, the state's examination of the victim's mother, the refreshment of the state's witness's recollection, and closing argument, a motion for a new trial was properly denied on these grounds. Hunter v. State, 282 Ga. App. 355 , 638 S.E.2d 804 (2006).\n\nBecause the defendant failed to show how trial counsel was ineffective in failing to make objections, failing to file a futile motion to suppress, and failure to object to the admission of evidence, but instead counsel's actions were deemed part of a reasonable trial strategy, the ineffectiveness claim failed and the defendant was not entitled to a new trial on that count. Opio v. State, 283 Ga. App. 894 , 642 S.E.2d 906 (2007).\n\nDefendant failed to show ineffective assistance of defense counsel for failure to pursue a self-defense or justification defense with regard to the shooting death of the victim since at the hearing on the motion for new trial trial counsel testified that, given the state of the evidence, trial counsel did not consider a self-defense strategy to be viable, and would be at odds with the strategy chosen, namely to seek a conviction for the lesser crime of voluntary manslaughter. Trial counsel's decision not to pursue inconsistent defenses was made in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment and was reasonable since the evidence from three eye-witnesses showed that the defendant went to the defendant's car and retrieved a pistol, shot the unarmed victim when the victim was retreating, and then went to where the victim lay and shot the victim several more times. Taylor v. State, 282 Ga. 693 , 653 S.E.2d 477 (2007).\n\nBecause the defendant failed to present the testimony of either trial counsel to support a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and thus, the record of the new trial hearing was silent as to what actions were taken by counsel to prepare for the plea or to investigate the ramifications of the previous plea, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant's withdrawal of the plea. Jackson v. State, 288 Ga. App. 742 , 655 S.E.2d 323 (2007).\n\nDefendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims were without merit, because counsel: (1) adequately explained the decision not to call the defendant's spouse; (2) adequately met with the defendant to discuss the trial strategy and regarding the defendant's decision to waive the right to a jury trial; and (3) had reason to decline objection to the admission of an audio recording of the colloquy between the officers and the defendant at the scene, as that decision supported counsel's trial strategy. Thus, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial based on those claims. Defrancisco v. State, 289 Ga. App. 115 , 656 S.E.2d 238 (2008).\n\nBecause trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to point out a purported discrepancy in the evidence to the jury, failing to investigate alleged evidence tampering, and failing to object to the inclusion of a charge on mutual combat in the jury instructions, or reserve objections to the instructions, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant a new trial. Sanders v. State, 283 Ga. 372 , 659 S.E.2d 376 (2008).\n\nTrial counsel was not ineffective for failing to request a continuance to review evidence and have the evidence tested by the defendant's own expert because the defendant presented no evidence at the motion for new trial hearing to support the defendant's bald assertion that there was a reasonable probability that the outcome of the proceeding would have been different had counsel sought a continuance or independent expert testing. Walker v. State, 288 Ga. 174 , 702 S.E.2d 415 (2010).\n\nTrial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for new trial on the ground that the defendant's trial counsel was ineffective since counsel's motion for continuance did not comply with O.C.G.A. § 17-8-25 because the witness in question had not been subpoenaed and, thus, counsel could not comply with the statute; the defendant did not show that the trial court's denial of the motion for continuance was reversible error. Presley v. State, 307 Ga. App. 528 , 705 S.E.2d 870 (2011).\n\nTrial court did not err by rejecting the defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel on a motion for mistrial because the defendant failed to demonstrate that the defendant was deprived of effective assistance of counsel. Although the defendant argued that the defendant's trial counsel failed to ask prospective jurors certain questions during voir dire, the defendant made no assertion as to what answers any prospective juror would have given had he or she been asked any of those questions or as to what significance any such answer would have had. The defendant could not show prejudice with regard to the defendant's assertions that counsel failed to fully investigate the case and call essential witnesses because counsel made no proffer as to what a thorough investigation would have uncovered or what the essential witnesses would have said, and the defendant failed to show a reasonable probability that an objection or motion for mistrial related to a detective's testimony would have changed the outcome of the defendant's trial. Ware v. State, 307 Ga. App. 782 , 706 S.E.2d 143 (2011).\n\nDefendant failed to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel due to counsel's failure to seek a mistrial after successfully objecting to a witness's testimony that the defendant told the witness that \"he would have a shoot-out with police before he ever went back to jail\" on the ground that the witness's response placed the defendant's character in evidence because even if counsel's failure to request a mistrial were deemed deficient, no mistrial would have been granted as a nonresponsive answer that impacted negatively on a defendant's character did not improperly place the defendant's character in issue, and another witness had already testified without objection that the witness did not call the police on another occasion because the defendant had told that witness \"if the cops came he would come out shooting\". Because failure to pursue a futile motion did not constitute ineffective assistance, the defendant failed to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Billings v. State, 308 Ga. App. 248 , 707 S.E.2d 177 (2011).\n\nTrial court did not err in denying the defendant a new trial on the ground that the defendant's trial counsel's failure to object to the prosecutor's statement during closing argument amounted to ineffective assistance because the defendant could not demonstrate that the deficiency in trial court's performance prejudiced the defendant; the evidence of the defendant's guilt was overwhelming and there was no reasonable probability that the outcome of the defendant's trial would have been more favorable had trial counsel objected, even successfully, to the prosecutor's statement in argument. Jones v. State, 288 Ga. 431 , 704 S.E.2d 776 (2011).\n\nTrial court did not abuse the court's discretion in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel because the defendant did not show that: (1) the defense counsel was ineffective in failing to adequately investigate the case or meet with the defendant prior to trial; (2) the defense counsel was ineffective in failing to interview and cross-examine the prosecution's witnesses as the defendant did not establish a reasonable probability that further interviews and cross-examination would have resulted in a different outcome at trial; (3) the defense counsel was ineffective in failing to file a motion for immunity from prosecution/plea in bar pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 16-3-24.2 based upon the defendant's claim of self-defense as it was a matter of trial strategy and the defendant could not demonstrate how the failure to pursue such a claim harmed the defendant; (4) the defense counsel was ineffective in failing to request a jury charge on the use of force in defense of habitation; and (5) the defense counsel was ineffective in failing to test the thoroughness and good faith of the state's investigation. Smith v. State, 309 Ga. App. 241 , 709 S.E.2d 823 (2011), cert. denied, No. S11C1266, 2011 Ga. LEXIS 954 (Ga. 2011).\n\nTrial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for new trial because the trial court properly rejected the defendant's claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to introduce into evidence two medical evaluation documents, which the defendant alleged would have contradicted statements witnesses gave to the police; it was mere speculation that the witnesses' statements were inconsistent with the medical reports. McClarin v. State, 289 Ga. 180 , 710 S.E.2d 120 (2011), cert. denied, 132 S. Ct. 1004 , 181 L. Ed. 2 d 745 (2012).\n\nDefendant was not entitled to a new trial on the basis that trial counsel was ineffective because the defendant failed to establish that there was a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's alleged deficiencies, the outcome of the trial would have been different; even assuming that trial counsel performed deficiently by failing to object to certain testimony, the defendant failed to show a reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different, and even if trial counsel had filed a motion to suppress certain evidence and that evidence had been excluded, the remaining evidence adduced at trial was overwhelming. Lowe v. State, 310 Ga. App. 242 , 712 S.E.2d 633 (2011).\n\nBecause the defendant made no showing that the defendant's wife lacked authority to consent to a search of the marital residence, because the trial attorney's strategic decisions not to pursue a defense or to request a jury poll were not patently unreasonable, and because the defendant's claims were not waived by appellate counsel, the defendant failed to show that the defendant was entitled to a new trial based on counsels' alleged ineffectiveness. Davis v. State, 311 Ga. App. 699 , 716 S.E.2d 710 (2011).\n\nDefendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel due to trial counsel's failure to renew a motion for mistrial after the trial court gave a curative instruction because the defendant failed to demonstrate prejudice; trial counsel had twice moved for a mistrial, which the trial court denied, and the trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in giving the curative instruction, which preserved the defendant's right to a fair trial. Sanders v. State, 290 Ga. 445 , 721 S.E.2d 834 (2012).\n\nTrial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for new trial on the grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel because any error in excluding a witness's testimony regarding the victim's allegedly prior false accusations of sexual abuse was harmless; the defendant could not show that trial counsel was deficient in failing to investigate a matter of which counsel was unaware of at the time. Ellis v. State, 316 Ga. App. 352 , 729 S.E.2d 492 (2012).\n\nTrial court committed no error in denying the defendant's motion for new trial because the defendant could not show that trial counsel was deficient for declining to ask for a contemporaneous limiting instruction; trial counsel did not ask for a contemporaneous limiting instruction on similar transaction evidence since counsel wanted to try to draw the least amount of attention to it as possible, and the trial court gave a limiting instruction on similar transaction evidence in the court's final charge to the jury. Sims v. State, 317 Ga. App. 420 , 731 S.E.2d 105 (2012).\n\nNot knowing case was set for trial. - Mere fact that counsel and clients had no knowledge that case was on calendar and set for trial is not in itself sufficient to support grant of new trial. Southern Ariz. Sch. for Boys, Inc. v. Morris, 123 Ga. App. 67 , 179 S.E.2d 548 (1970).\n\nNot knowing when case would be called. - Mere fact that plaintiff's counsel did not know exactly when case would be called, and so was not present to ask for continuance resulting in dismissal, was not ground for new trial, nor was the fact that counsel was trying the case in another court. Georgia v. Handshakers, Inc., 140 Ga. App. 641 , 231 S.E.2d 575 (1976).\n\nRefusal to allow defendant to dismiss counsel did not warrant new trial. - Because the record showed that the defendant never unequivocally asserted a right to self-representation, the trial court did not err in refusing to allow the defendant to dismiss trial counsel; thus, the trial court properly denied the defendant a new trial. Pulliam v. State, 287 Ga. App. 717 , 653 S.E.2d 65 (2007), cert. denied, 2008 Ga. LEXIS 159 (Ga. 2008).\n\nCounsel not ineffective. - Because defense counsel's trial strategy, tactics, and tactical errors did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel and because the defendant did not establish that the deficiency prejudiced the defense, the trial court's denial of defendant's motion for a new trial was not clearly erroneous. Ford v. State, 272 Ga. App. 798 , 613 S.E.2d 234 (2005).\n\nDefendant was not erroneously denied a new trial on grounds that trial counsel was ineffective, as the evidence, via trial counsel's testimony, showed that: (1) counsel, after gathering the defendant's medical history and interviewing the defendant's medical provider, did not believe the defendant was insane; and (2) counsel, after consulting with the defendant and gaining an approval, made a strategic decision not to pursue a mental health defense, opting instead to pursue a claim of self-defense. Radford v. State, 281 Ga. 303 , 637 S.E.2d 712 (2006).\n\nDefendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim lacked merit, and did not warrant a new trial, as the defendant failed to show that trial counsel's actions, in which counsel also represented the codefendant who was the passenger in the vehicle the defendant was driving, prejudiced the defense; further, counsel's actions did not slight the defense of one defendant for another, the principles contained in charges on mere presence and equal access were adequate, counsel was prepared for trial, and the prosecutor's closing argument statements were not prejudicial so as to warrant an objection. Garvin v. State, 283 Ga. App. 242 , 641 S.E.2d 176 (2006).\n\nIn a murder prosecution, the appeals court rejected the defendant's claims that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to pursue a battered woman syndrome defense and by failing to request a jury instruction on the lesser offense of voluntary manslaughter, as: (1) the evidence showed that the defendant, after consultation with counsel, instead chose to focus exclusively on the defense of justification; (2) the evidence did not support a voluntary manslaughter charge; and (3) the defendant did not want the trial court to charge on voluntary manslaughter. Moreover, at the new trial hearing, because appellate counsel did not ask trial counsel about the decision not to seek the manslaughter instruction, that decision was presumed to be strategic. Ballard v. State, 281 Ga. 232 , 637 S.E.2d 401 (2006).\n\nDefendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims lacked merit, as: (1) the defendant failed to give any specific examples of prejudice; (2) the defendant, after consultation with counsel, testified freely and voluntarily; and (3) any objections counsel might have made to a videotaped statement would have lacked merit, as those statements contained evidence of prior difficulties, admissible without notice and without the need for a pretrial hearing; hence, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial on those grounds. Campbell v. State, 282 Ga. App. 854 , 640 S.E.2d 358 (2006).\n\nBecause the defendant failed to show that: (1) trial counsel's performance was deficient in failing to call a forensic interviewer as a witness, and that failure prejudiced the defense and would have changed the outcome of the trial; (2) trial counsel's decision not to object to the properly admitted testimony from a forensic interviewer as to the opinion rendered on the victim's intelligence and reactions to certain questions which were consistent with abuse was not ineffective; and (3) the defendant could not show that the failure to call the trial attorney affected the outcome of a motion for a new trial, the defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims against both trial and appellate counsel lacked merit; thus, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial. Freeman v. State, 282 Ga. App. 185 , 638 S.E.2d 358 (2006).\n\nAppeals court rejected the defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims regarding the admission of a tape-recorded statement and claim that trial counsel should have demanded a Jackson-Denno hearing or a hearing to determine the admissibility of a similar transaction, as: (1) proper res gestae evidence could be admitted without having to follow the rules regarding prior similar transactions; (2) assuming that trial counsel should have demanded a Jackson-Denno hearing, the defendant failed to show how a hearing would have altered the outcome of the trial; and (3) at a hearing on the motion for a new trial, the defendant failed to introduce any evidence whatsoever to suggest that the statement made was involuntary. White v. State, 282 Ga. App. 286 , 638 S.E.2d 426 (2006).\n\nBecause the defendant failed to support an ineffective assistance of counsel claim with affirmative evidence showing an infringement of rights or a procedural irregularity in the taking of a prior guilty plea, and the defendant failed to show that an objection by trial counsel to the introduction of the prior plea would have been successful, a claim that trial counsel was ineffective, thus warranting a new trial, lacked merit. Lattimore v. State, 282 Ga. App. 435 , 638 S.E.2d 848 (2006).\n\nDefendant was not entitled to a new trial based on claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel as the only evidence offered to support this claim was the defendant's own hearsay testimony as to what the desired witnesses were expected to testify to at trial, and such evidence was insufficient; further, the defendant failed to show that counsel's decision to forgo calling such witnesses was unreasonable. Brigman v. State, 282 Ga. App. 481 , 639 S.E.2d 359 (2006).\n\nTrial court did not err in denying the defendant a new trial on grounds that trial counsel was ineffective, specifically as to issues of the defendant's competency to stand trial and getting the defendant to agree to a bench trial, as: (1) the record showed that defense counsel adequately pursued the competency issue, filed pre-trial discovery motions, obtained an order for defendant's mental evaluation, hired a forensic psychologist to evaluate the defendant's competency, presented and examined witnesses, cross-examined the state's witnesses, and made a closing argument; (2) even if the court were to assume that trial counsel's failure to interview the various doctors constituted deficient performance, the defendant failed to show any prejudice resulting therefrom; and (3) the defendant failed to show that trial counsel was deficient regarding the decision to pursue a bench trial rather than a jury trial, given that the trial court found that the defendant agreed that the case should be submitted to the court on stipulated facts, rather than to the jury. Wafford v. State, 283 Ga. App. 154 , 640 S.E.2d 727 (2007).\n\nDefendant's trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to object to specifically challenged testimony presented against the defendant, and a new trial was not warranted based on that ineffectiveness, as: (1) counsel explained at the hearing on the new trial motion that objections were not made for strategic and tactical reasons, so as to not draw attention to some of the testimony; (2) some of the testimony hurt the credibility of the state's witnesses while enhancing the credibility of the defense theory; (3) counsel attempted to engender sympathy for the defendant; and (4) the defendant failed to show that the outcome of the trial would have been different if the objections would have been made. Walls v. State, 283 Ga. App. 560 , 642 S.E.2d 195 (2007).\n\nBecause trial counsel was adequately prepared for trial, effectively engaged in plea negotiations, made timely objections, properly handled the defense, was not required to make meritless objections, and the defendant ultimately failed to show a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's alleged errors, the result of the trial would have been different, counsel was found to not be ineffective; thus, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial. Garrett v. State, 285 Ga. App. 282 , 645 S.E.2d 718 (2007).\n\nOn retrial on one count of child molestation and two counts of aggravated child molestation, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial on grounds that trial counsel was ineffective in admitting notes generated by a forensic evaluator who interviewed the child victim, as the defendant had previously been found guilty in the first trial in which the notes were not introduced. Mewborn v. State, 285 Ga. App. 187 , 645 S.E.2d 669 (2007).\n\nDefendant's trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to obtain a mental evaluation of the defendant prior to trial to determine criminal responsibility, absent record evidence that counsel had advance notice of any mental health problems, and further discussions with the defendant's family would not have revealed a history of significant mental illness; hence, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial on those grounds. Breland v. State, 285 Ga. App. 251 , 648 S.E.2d 389 (2007).\n\nBecause a transcript of the hearing on the defendant's motion for new trial was not included in the record on appeal, and absent any other proffer of the additional testimony and evidence that the alleged favorable witnesses would have testified to, the defendant could not show a reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different had trial counsel subpoenaed the witnesses; hence, the defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on that foundation failed. Dukes v. State, 285 Ga. App. 172 , 645 S.E.2d 664 (2007).\n\nDespite the defendant's contrary claims, trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to subpoena witnesses necessary to support a defense and failing to adequately raise all issues in the defendant's motion to suppress and motion for independent analysis of the suspected narcotics as: (1) the defendant failed to supply sufficient information about the whereabouts of the witnesses; (2) the defendant failed to produce the witnesses at the motion for a new trial hearing; (3) counsel's strategy in handling the suppression motion showed an appropriate exercise of discretion; and (4) under the theory of defense presented, counsel was not ineffective by failing to obtain an independent examination of the substance tested. McTaggart v. State, 285 Ga. App. 178 , 645 S.E.2d 658 (2007).\n\nIn a prosecution against the defendant under O.C.G.A. § 16-6-4 , because the defendant failed to show that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to present an alibi witness, and because the defendant failed to offer evidence that a medical examiner or witnesses from the Department of Family and Child Services would have been favorable to a defense, the defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims lacked merit. Herrington v. State, 285 Ga. App. 4 , 645 S.E.2d 29 , cert. denied, No. S07C1285, 2007 Ga. LEXIS 548 (Ga. 2007).\n\nThe Court of Appeals of Georgia upheld an order denying the defendant's motion for a new trial, as an ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on counsel's alleged failure to communicate lacked merit, given that no reasonable probability existed, nor did the defendant offer any, that the outcome of the trial would have been different absent counsel's alleged deficient performance. Chambers v. State, 284 Ga. App. 400 , 643 S.E.2d 871 (2007).\n\nTrial court did not err in denying the defendant's amended motion for a new trial based on trial counsel's alleged ineffective assistance as the evidence failed to show that counsel's trial strategy was unreasonable, the defendant failed to show prejudice by counsel's actions, and the defendant failed to preserve some of the challenges to counsel's actions for appellate review. Phillips v. State, 284 Ga. App. 224 , 644 S.E.2d 153 (2007).\n\nOn appeal from convictions on one count of aggravated sexual battery and two counts of sexual assault, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial as the defendant failed to show that any prejudice resulted from counsel's failure to call the defendant's wife to testify for the defense, and the appeals court refused to speculate that the wife's testimony would have led to an acquittal. Lee v. State, 286 Ga. App. 368 , 650 S.E.2d 320 (2007).\n\nBecause it appeared that trial counsel's strategy was to convince the court that insufficient circumstantial evidence was presented in order to convict the defendant, and counsel's decision not to hire an expert to testify as to how quickly the defendant could become intoxicated was a tactical matter to avoid getting into a battle of the experts, those decisions did not amount to ineffective assistance of counsel sufficient to warrant a new trial. O'Connell v. State, 285 Ga. App. 835 , 648 S.E.2d 147 (2007).\n\nTrial court properly denied the defendant a new trial based on numerous claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, as counsel was not ineffective in failing to: (1) make meritless objections; (2) raise what was considered a novel legal argument; (3) file futile motions that would not have changed the outcome of trial; (4) require corroboration of the defendant's confession; and (5) anticipate that the defendant's wife might mislead the defense; moreover, the defendant's claim that counsel was inadequately prepared for trial was belied by the record. Daly v. State, 285 Ga. App. 808 , 648 S.E.2d 90 (2007), cert. denied, 2007 Ga. LEXIS 659 (Ga. 2007), cert. denied, 553 U.S. 1039, 128 S. Ct. 2441 , 171 L. Ed. 2 d 241 (2008).\n\nBecause trial counsel's strategic decision not to call a close family friend as a witness, who could have rebutted the state's evidence that the defendant was controlling, was supported by testimony that the witness would not have added anything to the defense and might have diluted the defendant's voluntary manslaughter theory, counsel was not ineffective in failing to have the witness testify; thus, the defendant was properly denied a new trial. Johnson v. State, 282 Ga. 96 , 646 S.E.2d 216 (2007).\n\nDefendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims lacked merit, as a motion to strike or for a mistrial after the state's expert offered an opinion as to the victim's failure to immediately report the abuse was meritless, and counsel's decision as to how to present the defendant's testimony fell within the realm of reasonable trial strategy, and therefore could not be considered deficient; thus, the claims could not serve as the basis for a new trial. Gaines v. State, 285 Ga. App. 654 , 647 S.E.2d 357 (2007).\n\nTrial court properly denied the defendant's amended motion for a new trial as: (1) the defendant failed to support an assertion that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to listen to an audiotape of the defendant's second interview with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation prior to trial; (2) counsel's offhand comment as to hindsight was insufficient to support an inference of deficient performance; and (3) the defendant failed to show that prejudice resulted from counsel's alleged deficiency. Sturgis v. State, 282 Ga. 88 , 646 S.E.2d 233 (2007).\n\nBecause trial counsel did not provide the defendant with ineffective assistance to the extent that the relevant strategic decisions made would not have affected the outcome of the trial, and counsel properly chose not to object to the court's failure to merge a kidnapping and false imprisonment conviction, as those were independent offenses, the defendant's motion for a new trial was properly denied. Snelson v. State, 286 Ga. App. 203 , 648 S.E.2d 647 (2007).\n\nDefendant's motion for a new trial was properly denied since defense counsel was not ineffective in: (1) failing to investigate the victim's reputation for violence and introduce evidence of that victim's prior violent acts; (2) failing to investigate the defendant's medical records; (3) failing to investigate a state witness's convictions for crimes of moral turpitude and request an impeachment charge concerning that witness; (4) advising defendant not to testify; and (5) failing to present evidence or argument at sentencing. Cross v. State, 285 Ga. App. 518 , 646 S.E.2d 723 (2007), cert. denied, No. S07C1479, 2007 Ga. LEXIS 680 (Ga. 2007).\n\nTrial court properly denied the defendant's motion for a new trial on appeal from the defendant's convictions of child molestation and aggravated child molestation because: (1) venue was adequately shown by the testimony of a single witness; (2) the defendant's trial counsel was not ineffective by failing to prepare for trial, investigate the case, subpoena important documents, interview key witnesses, and object to damaging testimony; and (3) the defendant failed to show that the outcome of the trial would have been different but for counsel's alleged shortcomings. Brooks v. State, 286 Ga. App. 209 , 648 S.E.2d 724 (2007).\n\nRape conviction was upheld on appeal as the defendant was not entitled to a new trial based on defense counsel's failure to object to certain testimony from the victim about the defendant's history of selling drugs and failure to subpoena certain medical records, as: (1) testimony from the victim that the defendant gave the victim drugs before some of the sexual encounters between them was admissible as part of the res gestae; and (2) the medical records were generally consistent with the victim's testimony, and therefore no prejudice resulted from failing to subpoena them. Mitchell v. State, 287 Ga. App. 517 , 651 S.E.2d 821 (2007).\n\nIn a battery prosecution, setting aside the defendant's failure to object to a second attorney's representation at trial, a denial from the defendant's first attorney of an alleged promise to represent the defendant after that counsel's suspension had expired gave the trial court sufficient grounds for finding that no such promise occurred, eliminating the defendant's denial of the right to counsel claim; moreover, inasmuch as the defendant failed to challenge the trial court's finding that the second attorney's representation was effective, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial. Northington v. State, 287 Ga. App. 96 , 650 S.E.2d 760 (2007).\n\nDefendant's trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to object when a medical examiner testified that the victim's death was a homicide and not an accident, and despite the defendant's contrary claim, the testimony was not an expression of the witness' opinion on the ultimate issue in the case, as: (1) counsel did not consider the testimony objectionable because there was no dispute that the \"manner\" of the victim's death was a homicide, and such tactic was not unreasonable; (2) the ultimate issue for the jury to determine was whether the defendant acted with malice, in response to the victim's provocation, or whether self-defense was an issue; (3) counsel testified that an objection would have been in order had the medical examiner invaded the province of the jury by expressing the opinion that the homicide was a murder; and (4) the defendant failed to show any prejudice by the testimony presented. Berry v. State, 282 Ga. 376 , 651 S.E.2d 1 (2007).\n\nBecause the defendant was not denied the effective assistance of trial counsel based on said counsel's failure to call certain witnesses, as the testimony that these witnesses would have provided would not have affected the outcome of the trial, and counsel was not ineffective to the extent that the defendant was denied the right to testify at trial, the trial court properly denied the defendant a new trial. Finch v. State, 287 Ga. App. 319 , 651 S.E.2d 478 (2007).\n\nBecause trial counsel's decision not to object to statements that might have impugned the defendant's character was a tactical one, the trial court properly found that trial counsel was not ineffective; thus, the defendant was properly denied a new trial on those grounds. Page v. State, 287 Ga. App. 182 , 651 S.E.2d 131 (2007).\n\nBecause the defendant was unable to establish prejudice resulting from trial counsel's alleged shortcomings, specifically that counsel was unprepared for trial, the defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim lacked merit; thus, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial on that ground. Bradford v. State, 287 Ga. App. 50 , 651 S.E.2d 356 (2007).\n\nBecause the defendant did not claim below that trial counsel was ineffective for opening the door to impeachment, the defendant failed to timely raise this argument, and thus the claim was waived for purposes of appeal; as a result, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial on ineffective assistance of counsel grounds. Lipsey v. State, 287 Ga. App. 835 , 652 S.E.2d 870 (2007).\n\nBecause counsels' advice against putting the defendant on the stand was tactical, counsel made the strategic decision not to strike a challenged juror, and the record reflected the basis for counsels' objection and motion for a mistrial during the state's closing argument, the defendant's allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel lacked merit; thus, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial as a result. Warner v. State, 287 Ga. App. 892 , 652 S.E.2d 898 (2007).\n\nBecause a trial counsel's decision not to request a jury charge on a lesser-included offense in order to pursue an all-or-nothing defense was a matter of trial strategy, and there was no indication that the defendant would have agreed to charges on lesser-included offenses, given that the defendant relied on a claim of innocence, counsel was not ineffective in failing to request an instruction on a lesser-included offense; thus, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial on this ground. Davis v. State, 287 Ga. App. 786 , 653 S.E.2d 104 (2007).\n\nIneffective assistance of counsel claims regarding the defendant's initial post-trial counsel's performance lacked merit, as counsel was neither professionally deficient nor prejudicial because: (1) the defendant waived any right to be present at the two juror interviews; (2) no deficiency could result from counsel's failure to raise meritless objections; and (3) the trial court specifically found that the defendant adequately understood the nature of the charges, comprehended the proceedings, despite being under the influence of prescribed anti-depressants, and was capable of aiding the defense. Hampton v. State, 282 Ga. 490 , 651 S.E.2d 698 (2007).\n\nBecause the defendant's trial counsel was not ineffective in presenting a defense and requesting jury instructions on the defendant's claim of innocence, and was authorized to forego objection to a challenged portion of the state's closing argument, the defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims lacked merit and did not warrant a new trial. King v. State, 282 Ga. 505 , 651 S.E.2d 711 (2007).\n\nIneffective assistance of counsel claims regarding the defendant's initial post-trial counsel's performance lacked merit, as counsel was neither professionally deficient nor prejudicial because: (1) the defendant waived any right to be present at the two juror interviews; (2) no deficiency could result from counsel's failure to raise meritless objections; and (3) the trial court specifically found that the defendant adequately understood the nature of the charges, and comprehended the proceedings, despite being under the influence of prescribed anti-depressants, and was capable of aiding the defense; thus, the evidence did not provide an adequate basis for the appellate court to conclude that the outcome of an amended motion for a new trial would have been different. Hampton v. State, 282 Ga. 490 , 651 S.E.2d 698 (2007).\n\nBecause the defendant's trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to call a witness who would have testified that the victim fabricated claims of molestation, given evidence that: (1) the witness did not inform counsel of the witness before trial; (2) counsel articulated valid reasons for not calling the witness; (3) counsel challenged the state's evidence, arguing that the claims were fabricated; and (4) the defendant failed to show that any prejudice resulted from counsel's actions, the trial court properly denied the defendant a new trial based on ineffective assistance of counsel. Noe v. State, 287 Ga. App. 728 , 652 S.E.2d 620 (2007).\n\nBecause any deficiency in counsel's failure to object to an investigator's testimony regarding the hearsay statements of an informant did not prejudice the defendant's defense, the jury was likely to deduce that the defendant was on parole from the fact that a parole officer initiated a search, and pretermitting whether the defendant's response to the investigator's request to search constituted \"pre-arrest silence,\" no deficiency existed in counsel's reasonable strategic decision that the evidence was consistent with the defense, the defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims lacked merit. Cauley v. State, 287 Ga. App. 701 , 652 S.E.2d 586 (2007).\n\nBecause: (1) it was likely that a mistrial would not have been granted after a police investigator testified about past dealings with the defendant; and (2) trial counsel's failure to request a curative instruction about the alleged improper injection of character evidence or question a witness about a note in which that witness recanted a statement amounted to reasonable trial strategy, the appeals court found that the defendant's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel lacked merit. Thus, a new trial based on those claims was unwarranted. Head v. State, 288 Ga. App. 205 , 653 S.E.2d 540 (2007).\n\nBecause the defendant failed to show that any prejudice resulted from trial counsel's failure to investigate potential character witnesses and failure to \"re-advise\" the defendant of the right to testify following the state's introduction of rebuttal evidence, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial on these grounds. Thomas v. State, 282 Ga. 894 , 655 S.E.2d 599 (2008).\n\nDefendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims did not warrant a new trial because counsel's trial tactics did not amount to ineffective assistance: (1) the defendant could not complain from a self-made choice to testify; (2) counsel's closing argument was not deficient; and (3) counsel could not be ineffective simply because another attorney might have used different language or placed a different emphasis on the evidence. Davenport v. State, 283 Ga. 171 , 656 S.E.2d 844 (2008).\n\nBecause the trial court was entitled to believe counsel's testimony at the hearing on the motion for new trial that counsel advised the defendant of the right to testify at trial and that counsel met numerous times with the defendant, with ample opportunity to discuss all aspects of the case with counsel, the defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim in support of a motion for a new trial had to be rejected. Warren v. State, 283 Ga. 42 , 656 S.E.2d 803 (2008).\n\nBecause the defendant failed to show that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to request jury voir dire to determine whether jurors saw the defendant wearing handcuffs, and because sufficient evidence supported the defendant's burglary conviction to make a directed verdict of acquittal unnecessary, a motion for a new trial was properly denied. Brown v. State, 289 Ga. App. 297 , 656 S.E.2d 582 (2008).\n\nBecause: (1) the defendant failed to show that counsel was deficient in failing to impeach a cohort in the crimes charged with a prior felony conviction; (2) counsel made the strategic decision to restrict the scope of the cohort's cross-examination; and (3) the defendant could not show any prejudice resulting from the counsel's actions, the defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim lacked merit. Thus, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial as a result of that claim. Jones v. State, 289 Ga. App. 219 , 656 S.E.2d 556 (2008), cert. denied, 2008 Ga. LEXIS 381 (Ga. 2008).\n\nBecause the evidence showed that: (1) the defendant's trial counsel spent sufficient time investigating and preparing the case; (2) the defendant failed to present evidence of the victim's alleged \"false reporting\" conviction at the hearing on the motion for new trial or show how counsel's cross-examination of the victim on the false reporting would have affected the outcome of the trial; and (3) trial counsel contacted each and every person the defendant identified as a witness, the defendant's motion for a new trial on grounds that counsel was ineffective was properly denied. Kilby v. State, 289 Ga. App. 457 , 657 S.E.2d 567 (2008).\n\nOn appeal from convictions on two counts of child molestation and one count of aggravated sexual battery, the trial court properly found that the defendant was not entitled to a new trial based on allegations of the ineffective assistance of defense counsel because: (1) the manner in which counsel handled alleged exculpatory evidence pertaining to a similar transaction witness and the cross-examination of that witness, was part of counsel's reasonable trial strategy; (2) the defendant's reciprocal discovery or due process rights were not violated; and (3) the existence of the information sought was known to the defendant, which could have been obtained with due diligence. Ellis v. State, 289 Ga. App. 452 , 657 S.E.2d 562 (2008).\n\nDefendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim did not warrant a new trial in a prosecution for rape, kidnapping, aggravated stalking, and two counts of stalking; because of the limited nature of a challenged witnesses' trial testimony, defense counsel made a strategic decision not to seek recusal of the trial judge, who was the brother of the challenged witness, and counsel discussed with the defendant the reasons for not seeking recusal. Pirkle v. State, 289 Ga. App. 450 , 657 S.E.2d 560 (2008).\n\nNew trial based on counsel's alleged ineffectiveness was unwarranted because the defendant made no affirmative showing that the purported deficiencies in trial counsel's representation in investigating a claim of possible jury tampering amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel and were not examples of a conscious and deliberate trial strategy. Dowels v. State, 289 Ga. App. 369 , 657 S.E.2d 279 (2008).\n\nBecause: (1) the defendant failed to meet the burden of establishing that the state possessed favorable information, or that the trial's outcome might have been different if videotapes from the cameras on the vehicles of the two responding officers had been produced; and (2) counsel was not required to make an objection to the admission of similar transaction evidence when such would have been futile, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial as a result. Hinton v. State, 290 Ga. App. 479 , 659 S.E.2d 841 (2008).\n\nBecause the defendant failed to present any evidence of prejudice from trial counsels' alleged deficiency in failing to explore the possibility that the defendant's mental illness might have provided a viable trial defense, and that one counsel failed to adequately prepare the defendant for taking the witness stand, the trial court properly denied the defendant a new trial based on the ineffective assistance of counsel. Icenhour v. State, 290 Ga. App. 461 , 659 S.E.2d 858 (2008).\n\nNew trial based on counsel's alleged ineffectiveness was properly denied because the defendant's numerous claims of ineffective assistance of counsel lacked merit; the defendant failed to show that: (1) the number of different instructions sought; (2) any additional investigation or preparation; (3) an objection to evidence of the prior difficulties between the defendant and the victim, and request for a contemporaneous limiting instruction; and (4) a request for an instruction on a defense not alleged, would have changed the outcome of the trial, and the tactical decision as to which defense to pursue was part of a reasonable trial strategy. Breazeale v. State, 290 Ga. App. 632 , 660 S.E.2d 376 (2008).\n\nBecause the defendant failed to show that any prejudice resulted from trial counsel's alleged ineffectiveness in failing to discover and introduce the criminal record of one of the witnesses for the prosecution for impeachment purposes, a new trial was properly denied. Rivers v. State, 283 Ga. 108 , 657 S.E.2d 210 (2008).\n\nIn prosecution against defendant on two counts of child molestation, because trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to request a specific jury charge addressing alleged improper bolstering testimony, present any expert testimony which was not helpful to defense, and elicit available favorable evidence and impeach the victim's testimony, defendant's convictions of related offenses were upheld on appeal; thus, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial on grounds that trial counsel was ineffective. Rouse v. State, 290 Ga. App. 740 , 660 S.E.2d 476 (2008).\n\nAs a defendant failed to raise an issue regarding the alleged bolstering of a victim by a witness for the state in the defendant's motion for a new trial based on the alleged ineffectiveness of trial counsel, the issue was not preserved for purposes of appellate review. Carroll v. State, 292 Ga. App. 795 , 665 S.E.2d 883 (2008).\n\nTrial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial on the ground that the defendant's trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to obtain an electronic enhancement of a videotape depicting a drug sale, which allegedly would have shown that the defendant was not the perpetrator of the offense, because the defendant failed to show that the defendant was prejudiced as a result of trial counsel's failure to obtain an electronic enhancement of the videotape prior to trial since the enhanced images failed to create a reasonable probability that the defendant was not the perpetrator depicted in the images. Moreover, an undercover officer unequivocally identified the defendant as the perpetrator based upon the officer's personal observations and independent memory of the defendant at the time of the drug sale, and although the defendant attempted to prove that another individual was the perpetrator depicted in the videotape's images, the defendant failed to proffer sufficient evidence in support of the defendant's claim. Faulkner v. State, 304 Ga. App. 791 , 697 S.E.2d 914 (2010).\n\nTrial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for new trial on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel because trial counsel's decision not to object to a police officer's passing reference to the defendant's post-arrest silence was a valid exercise of reasonable professional judgment, the defendant failed to rebut the presumption that counsel performed within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance in failing to challenge hearsay testimony, counsel's defense strategy of implicating the codefendants was not unreasonable, and counsel did not fail to present evidence as promised in the counsel's opening statement. Jackson v. State, 306 Ga. App. 33 , 701 S.E.2d 481 (2010).\n\nTrial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for new trial on the ground that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to statements the prosecutor made during closing argument because counsel did object, and defense counsel's objection was successful; while the defendant asserted that counsel should have further moved for a mistrial, such decisions generally fell within the ambit of strategy and tactics. Wilson v. State, 306 Ga. App. 827 , 703 S.E.2d 400 (2010).\n\nTrial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for new trial on the ground that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to a question directed to an accomplice because counsel personally opened the line of questioning on cross-examination, and in the absence of counsel's testimony, it was presumed to be a strategic decision; having made that decision, trial counsel could not object, and because trial counsel succeeded in obtaining acquittal on the three most serious charges against the defendant that strongly supported the conclusion that the assistance actually rendered by trial counsel fell within that broad range of reasonably effective assistance that members of the bar in good standing were presumed to render. Wilson v. State, 306 Ga. App. 827 , 703 S.E.2d 400 (2010).\n\nTrial court did not err in denying the codefendant's motion for new trial on the ground that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to testimony from one of the victims and a police officer regarding the codefendant's prior purchase of marijuana from one of the victims because drug use showed the codefendant's motive to rob a home where the codefendant believed illegal drugs and money would be found; an accomplice testified that the motive for the robbery was that the victims kept drugs and cash in the apartment and that the codefendant planned the robbery and knew that drugs and money were kept in the house. Wilson v. State, 306 Ga. App. 827 , 703 S.E.2d 400 (2010).\n\nTrial counsel was not ineffective for failing to move for a mistrial when a state's witness interjected bad character evidence because the witness's improper remarks were fleeting, unsolicited, and nonresponsive to the prosecutor's examination questions, and since the defendant did not show that the defendant was otherwise entitled to a mistrial based upon the circumstances, trial counsel's failure to pursue a meritless motion does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel; the trial court sustained the objections to the improper testimony and instructed the prosecutor and witness to restrict the examination and responses, the witness and prosecutor complied with the trial court's instructions, and there was no further mention of the bad character evidence. Boatright v. State, 308 Ga. App. 266 , 707 S.E.2d 158 (2011).\n\nTrial court did not abuse the court's discretion in denying the defendant's motion for new trial on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel because trial counsel's decision not to request the production of the duct tape that was used to bind the defendant when the defendant was allegedly kidnapped was not patently unreasonable because the duct tape itself was cumulative of evidence that was introduced through the defendant's recorded police interview and trial counsel's cross-examination of a detective; even if it was assumed that trial counsel performed deficiently, the defendant proffered no evidence at the hearing on the defendant's motion for new trial that an analysis of the duct tape would have bolstered the defendant's alibi defense. Buis v. State, 309 Ga. App. 644 , 710 S.E.2d 850 (2011).\n\nTrial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for new trial because trial counsel's failure to object to a detective's testimony did not amount to deficient performance since the testimony was not a statement of the victim's credibility or an invasion of the province of the jury; the testimony concerned the detective's reason for ending the interview with the victim and referring the victim to the Georgia Center of Child Advocacy, and even if the testimony that \"a molestation incident occurred\" did constitute improper bolstering, the defendant failed to show a reasonable probability that the testimony so prejudiced the defense as to affect the outcome of the trial. Furthermore, the motion was also properly denied because trial counsel's failure to object to the prosecutor's comments during closing argument did not constitute deficient performance; the comments of which defendant complained were permissible since the comments were the conclusion the prosecutor wished the jury to draw from the evidence and not a statement of the prosecutor's personal belief as to the veracity of a witness. Strickland v. State, 311 Ga. App. 400 , 715 S.E.2d 798 (2011).\n\nTrial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for new trial on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel because there was no evidence to support an instruction on defense of habitation pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 16-3-23 and, thus, trial counsel did not perform deficiently in failing to request such an instruction; there was no evidence that the victim was attempting to unlawfully enter or attack the defendant's vehicle at the time the defendant stabbed the victim, and under the facts, there could be no reasonable belief that stabbing the victim was necessary to prevent or terminate the other's unlawful entry into or attack upon a motor vehicle. Philpot v. State, 311 Ga. App. 486 , 716 S.E.2d 551 (2011).\n\nBecause the armed robbery count of the indictment sufficiently alleged the elements of armed robbery, trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to challenge armed robbery, and the trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for new trial as to the ineffective assistance claim; that the property was taken from the person or immediate presence of another is necessarily inferred from the allegation of a use of an offensive weapon to accomplish the taking, and the alleged offense of \"armed robbery\" can be accomplished only via a taking from the person or immediate presence of another. Patterson v. State, 312 Ga. App. 793 , 720 S.E.2d 278 (2011), cert. denied, No. S12C0574, 2012 Ga. LEXIS 327 (Ga. 2012).\n\nTrial court did not err when the court denied the portion of the codefendant's motion for new trial alleging ineffective assistance of trial counsel because the alleged deficiencies in trial counsel's performance were either without factual basis or were decisions made as matters of trial strategy. Smith v. State, 290 Ga. 428 , 721 S.E.2d 892 (2012).\n\nTrial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to the state's argument that no person in the circuit had ever been convicted and later proven innocent because the trial court would not have abused the court's discretion in denying the defendant's motion for mistrial had one been made and did not err when the court credited trial counsel's decision not to object to the prosecutor's closing argument as strategic; even assuming that the prosecutor should not have compared the defendant to others, the subject of wrongful convictions in other cases was brought up by the defendant, and the jury was not impressed either way by the colloquy. Stubbs v. State, 315 Ga. App. 482 , 727 S.E.2d 229 (2012).\n\nCounsel not ineffective for alleged intoxication. - Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel because the defendant failed to show that the defendant's trial counsel was actually intoxicated on the second morning of the trial and that the defendant's counsel's performance after consuming alcohol affected the outcome of the defendant's trial; nothing in the record showed that the trial court erred in finding that there were no deficiencies in counsel's performance on the second morning of the trial. Long v. State, 307 Ga. App. 669 , 705 S.E.2d 889 (2011).\n\nWhen ineffective counsel did not result in prejudice. - Defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim did not warrant a new trial because sufficient evidence of the defendant's intoxication was presented in the record, and the defendant failed to show prejudice resulting from trial counsel's failure to object to defendant's admission to having a prior DUI conviction, even though it was error for trial counsel not to object. Thomas v. State, 288 Ga. App. 827 , 655 S.E.2d 701 (2007).\n\nNew trial was unwarranted because: (1) the decision not to present the defendant's love interest as an alibi witness was clearly strategic, and thus, could not serve as the basis for an ineffectiveness claim; and (2) counsel's alleged failure to specifically object to the victim's testimony on bolstering and not on leading and speculation grounds impermissibly expanded the enumerated error. Scott v. State, 288 Ga. App. 738 , 655 S.E.2d 326 (2007).\n\nWhile the defendant's trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to that portion of the state's closing argument in which the prosecutor referenced a slain officer's funeral a week prior, as that fact had no relevance to the charges the defendant was facing, based on the overwhelming evidence of guilt, including the defendant's admission, the defendant's convictions for trafficking in cocaine and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute were upheld on appeal; thus, a new trial was properly denied. Cantrell v. State, 290 Ga. App. 651 , 660 S.E.2d 468 (2008).\n\nFailure to disclose unknown reward. - Trial court did not err in denying a motion for a new trial when the state did not disclose a potential reward for one of the state's witnesses when the state's attorney did not know at the time of trial that any witness testifying for the state was subject to a reward. McBee v. State, 210 Ga. App. 182 , 435 S.E.2d 469 (1993).\n\nState found not to have committed discovery violation. - Absent any evidence of bad faith on the part of the state, or an order requiring production, the state did not fail to fully disclose all the information regarding the defendant's breath test results. Thus, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant either a mistrial or a new trial as a result. Rosandich v. State, 289 Ga. App. 170 , 657 S.E.2d 255 (2008), cert. denied, No. S08C0861, 2008 Ga. LEXIS 380 (Ga. 2008).\n\nFailure to establish Brady violation. - Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial on the ground that the state withheld crucial impeachment evidence regarding an informant because the defendant failed to carry the burden of establishing a Brady claim; the defendant's trial counsel extensively questioned an agent about the informant's criminal history, and during the cross-examination of the agent, trial counsel elicited the fact that the informant had once been addicted to cocaine and again went through the informant's convictions, introducing copies of the convictions for the jury's consideration. Durham v. State, 309 Ga. App. 444 , 710 S.E.2d 644 (2011).\n\nAbsence of key portions of trial record supported verdict. - Because the appellant failed to supply the appellate court with the entire trial transcript in the record on appeal, but only included the pretrial motions and the opening statements at trial, without a complete transcript the court of appeals had to presume that the evidence supported the jury's verdict; thus, a new trial was not warranted. Parekh v. Wimpy, 288 Ga. App. 125 , 653 S.E.2d 352 (2007), cert. denied, No. S08C0520, 2008 Ga. LEXIS 319 (Ga. 2008).\n\nDeputy sheriff's communications with jury. - Defendant's motion for a new trial was properly denied, as the challenged communications between a deputy sheriff and the jury members were not improper, the deputy properly instructed the jurors to direct their questions to the judge, and the deputy's communications to the jury did not prejudice the defendant. Jackson v. State, 282 Ga. App. 612 , 639 S.E.2d 403 (2006).\n\nErroneous disallowance of challenge of juror for cause. - When it did not affirmatively appear from the record that the defendant in trial of misdemeanor case had exhausted the defendant's peremptory challenges at the time the panel of 12 jurors was accepted and sworn, the appellate court presumed that the defendant was not prejudiced by action of court in erroneously disallowing the defendant's challenge of certain jurors for cause, and did not grant reversal for alleged error. Borders v. State, 46 Ga. App. 212 , 167 S.E. 213 (1932).\n\nJuror impartial. - Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in denying a motion for new trial motion pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 5-5-25 after the defendant was convicted of criminal charges arising from an incident involving an ex-girlfriend; the fact that one juror indicated that the juror's daughter went to school with the victim's daughter and the daughters had a sleepover a year earlier at the victim's house did not create actual juror partiality or circumstances that were inherently prejudicial to defendant's right to an impartial jury under Ga. Const. 1983, Art. I, Sec. I, Para. XI. Sims v. State, 276 Ga. App. 246 , 622 S.E.2d 909 (2005).\n\nPretermitting whether a challenged juror would have been disqualified based on a relationship with the defendant, because the testimony from that juror at the new trial hearing did not reveal any bias for or against the defendant, or establish that the relationship affected the verdict, the defendant was not denied a fair and impartial trial. Moreover, even if the juror deliberately answered falsely, the defendant failed to show that a new trial was warranted because that juror had an evil motive or acted otherwise as one of the twelve jurors than with the required impartiality. Allen v. State, 290 Ga. App. 604 , 659 S.E.2d 900 (2008).\n\nPolling of jurors reveal consensus. - Trial court properly denied defendant's motion for a new trial and entered final judgments of conviction on the jury's verdict finding the defendant guilty of multiple child molestations even though the defendant alleged multiple grounds for overturning the verdict, as the polling of the last juror was sufficient to establish that the verdict against the defendant was unanimous since the juror said the guilty verdict against the defendant was \"her verdict now.\" That response showed, along with other jurors similar responses, that the verdict was unanimous and it thus did not matter that the juror answered in response to a question before that the verdict had not been that juror's verdict. Benefield v. State, 264 Ga. App. 511 , 591 S.E.2d 404 (2003).\n\nVoir dire was not inadequate. - Trial court acted within the court's discretion in granting an insurance premium finance company's motion in limine to preclude an insured from mentioning irrelevant corporate affiliations of the company during the course of the trial in any address to the jury, and the court properly denied the insured's motion for new trial under O.C.G.A. §§ 5-5-23 and 5-5-25 because the voir dire was broad enough to ascertain the fairness and impartiality of the prospective jurors, and the insured was not prohibited from asking more general questions that could have ferreted out the potential bias the insured claimed was so critical since the only limitation placed on voir dire was a prohibition against asking any questions about any affiliation with the company, and the insured failed to explore other avenues open to the insured for detecting juror bias; a corporation was not the company's insurer, and the insured did not provide the trial court with proof of any direct, demonstrable financial stake by the corporation in the outcome of the case. Floor Pro Packaging, Inc. v. AICCO, Inc., 308 Ga. App. 586 , 708 S.E.2d 547 (2011).\n\nJury foreperson's alleged untruthfulness in voir dire. - Because the defendant failed to present sufficient evidence to show that if the jury foreperson had given a truthful answer to counsel's question regarding whether any juror had ties to law enforcement, and that the foreperson would have been dismissed for cause, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial on this ground. Allen v. State, 286 Ga. App. 469 , 649 S.E.2d 583 (2007).\n\nBecause the defendant failed to show error by the record in order to support a claim that the trial court impermissibly communicated with the jury during the hearing on a motion for a new trial, the appeals court rejected that claim. Thornton v. State, 288 Ga. App. 60 , 653 S.E.2d 361 (2007), cert. denied, 2008 Ga. LEXIS 283 (Ga. 2008).\n\nPrejudicial statements made during voir dire. - Trial court erred in denying the defendant's motion for mistrial when prejudicial statements were made during voir dire because although a prospective juror stated that the juror was not sure if the defendant was the same person accused of raping his grandmother in a prior case, the state elicited more information from the juror, hereby providing the other prospective jurors with the name of another alleged rape victim in a crime for which the defendant was not on trial; the trial court did not undertake any measures to ascertain what, if any, impact the remark had on the panel's ability to decide the case, and the evidence was inherently prejudicial and deprived the defendant of the right to begin the trial with a jury free from even a suspicion of prejudgment or fixed opinion. Bell v. State, 311 Ga. App. 289 , 715 S.E.2d 684 (2011).\n\nCrying juror inadequate for motion for mistrial. - Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in denying the defendant's motion for a mistrial after a juror started crying as the victim's widow and two other family members of the victim allegedly ran out of the courtroom crying during the state's closing arguments because contrary to the defendant's description of the scene during closing arguments, the trial court stated that the court did not adopt the defense attorney's recitation of what occurred. Carter v. State, 289 Ga. 51 , 709 S.E.2d 223 (2011).\n\nGrand jury composition. - Trial court did not err in failing to grant the defendant a new trial on the ground that the grand jury was composed of 25 people in violation of O.C.G.A. § 15-12-61(a) , as the claim was waived, and the trial court found as a fact that the grand jury was properly comprised. Daly v. State, 285 Ga. App. 808 , 648 S.E.2d 90 (2007), cert. denied, 2007 Ga. LEXIS 659 (Ga. 2007), cert. denied, 553 U.S. 1039, 128 S. Ct. 2441 , 171 L. Ed. 2 d 241 (2008).\n\nCharging entire Code section when parts are inapplicable. - It is not usually cause for a new trial that an entire Code section is given, even though a part of the charge may be inapplicable under the facts in evidence. Stevens v. State, 247 Ga. 698 , 278 S.E.2d 398 (1981), cert. denied, 463 U.S. 1213, 103 S. Ct. 3551 , 77 L. Ed. 2 d 1398 (1982).\n\nFailure to request jury charge. - Though defendant's counsel erred by failing to request a jury charge on good character evidence and such error amounted to a deficient performance of counsel, defendant's conviction for malice murder and the denial of a motion for a new trial was upheld on appeal; no prejudice resulted to the defendant due to the deficiency in that the evidence of guilt was so overwhelming that, had the jury instruction been given, there was no likelihood that the outcome of the trial would have been different. Lucas v. State, 279 Ga. 175 , 611 S.E.2d 55 (2005).\n\nWhile the prosecution against the defendant on charges of burglary, theft by taking, and criminal trespass included both direct and circumstantial evidence, convictions on those charges were not reversed merely because the trial court failed to charge former O.C.G.A. § 24-4-6 (see now O.C.G.A. § 24-14-6 ) as the defendant failed to request that charge; hence, the defendant's motion for a new trial was properly denied. Rodriguez v. State, 283 Ga. App. 752 , 642 S.E.2d 705 (2007).\n\nBecause trial counsel made a strategic decision not to present a written request for a lesser-included misdemeanor obstruction charge given that the defendant decided to pursue an \"all or nothing\" defense, and, as a result, the trial court did not err in not charging the jury on misdemeanor obstruction, sua sponte, which would have undermined that defense, trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to request the charge; hence, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial on those grounds. Owens v. State, 288 Ga. App. 771 , 655 S.E.2d 244 (2007), cert. denied, 2008 Ga. LEXIS 274 (Ga. 2008).\n\nImproperly admitted evidence properly ruled out not grounds for mistrial. - Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in denying the defendant's motion for a mistrial in defendant's shoplifting case as the trial court's action in immediately ruling out improperly admitted evidence and instructing the jury to disregard the evidence meant a mistrial was not necessary to preserve defendant's right to a fair trial. Bradford v. State, 261 Ga. App. 621 , 583 S.E.2d 484 (2003).\n\nTrial counsel was not ineffective for failing to obtain copies of defendant's cell phone records, and the trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial on this ground. According to the defendant, these records would have shown that calls were made from defendant's cell phone to the victim's father, rebutting the father's testimony that the defendant would not talk to the father; however, the defendant admitted at trial that the defendant's coworkers would not allow the defendant to speak with the victim's father. Stanford v. State, 288 Ga. App. 463 , 654 S.E.2d 173 (2007), cert. denied, 2008 Ga. LEXIS 461 (Ga. 2008).\n\nEvidentiary issues did not warrant new trial. - Burglary conviction was upheld on appeal and, thus, the defendant was properly denied a new trial as: (1) sufficient evidence was presented that the defendant entered the victim's home without permission with the intent to commit a theft therein; and (2) the state properly presented res gestae evidence, even if such improperly placed the defendant's character in evidence. Meyers v. State, 281 Ga. App. 670 , 637 S.E.2d 78 (2006).\n\nBecause the defendant waived a confrontation clause, as well as any other constitutional objection, to testimony concerning a statement overheard from a woman fleeing the scene of the crime on appeal, and the victim's testimony, as well as the defendant's own admission, supported a robbery by intimidation conviction, such was upheld on appeal; hence, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant a new trial. Jordan v. State, 283 Ga. App. 85 , 640 S.E.2d 672 (2006).\n\nTrial court properly denied the defendant a new trial, given sufficient evidence that: (1) the defendant's convictions for malice murder and other related crimes were supported by the evidence; (2) the jury properly decided against a voluntary manslaughter verdict based on that evidence; (3) evidentiary issues did not warrant a mistrial; (4) the state did not act in bad faith in failing to preserve potentially exculpatory evidence; and (5) no due process violation occurred by the admission of cumulative evidence. Lonergan v. State, 281 Ga. 637 , 641 S.E.2d 792 (2007).\n\nTrial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial, as sufficient evidence supported the rape, aggravated sodomy, and incest convictions, similar transaction evidence was admitted for a proper purpose, and the imposition of a life imprisonment sentence as a recidivist child molester did not render O.C.G.A. § 16-6-4(b) an unconstitutional ex post facto law. Williams v. State, 284 Ga. App. 255 , 643 S.E.2d 749 (2007).\n\nBecause: (1) the defendant's convictions were supported by evidence of the defendant's confession to a friend and expert medical testimony as to how the victim died; (2) the defendant received ample notice of the specific deadly weapon allegedly used for purposes of the felony murder charge; and (3) the defendant failed to show that trial counsel was ineffective and a presumption of prejudice did not apply, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial. Jones v. State, 282 Ga. 47 , 644 S.E.2d 853 (2007).\n\nTrial court properly denied the defendant a new trial, as the state's commentary during opening and closing argument on the connection between illegal drugs and crime in the community was proper, no abuse of discretion resulted from the admission of the defendant's booking mug shot, and the state's identification witnesses could testify about their level of certainty in identifying the defendant. Clark v. State, 285 Ga. App. 182 , 645 S.E.2d 671 (2007).\n\nBecause: (1) the defendant failed to support a defense of self-defense, given evidence that any imminent threat posed against the defendant had passed, the victim was shot in the head after a confrontation had ended, and the victim had retreated to the victim's car and was being driven away at the time the fatal shot was dealt; (2) severance of the offense of aggravated assault on a police officer and felony murder of the victim was not warranted; and (3) the defendant failed to prove that the state committed a Batson violation in peremptorily striking two jurors, the defendant's motion and amended motion for a new trial were properly denied. Woolfolk v. State, 282 Ga. 139 , 644 S.E.2d 828 (2007).\n\nBecause sufficient evidence was supplied via the testimony from the child victim, and the witnesses who corroborated that testimony, to support the defendant's aggravated sexual battery and child molestation convictions, despite any alleged inconsistencies, the convictions were upheld as was the denial of the defendant's motions for an acquittal and a new trial. Lilly v. State, 285 Ga. App. 427 , 646 S.E.2d 512 (2007).\n\nGiven sufficient evidence presented by the state of the defendant's involvement in the armed robbery and murder of the victim as a party to the crimes, no errors in the content and order of the jury charges, and the lack of evidence supporting the defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims, the trial court properly denied the defendant a new trial. Pruitt v. State, 282 Ga. 30 , 644 S.E.2d 837 (2007).\n\nAffirmance of the juvenile court's order terminating a parent's parental rights was ordered, as the parent failed to comply with the case plan outlined, and the parent's failure to obtain stable housing, continued financial instability, and prolonged unwillingness to address mental health issues showed that the parent's lack of parental care or control caused the children's deprivation; hence, the parent's motion for a new trial was properly denied. In the Interest of J.M.N., 285 Ga. App. 203 , 645 S.E.2d 685 (2007).\n\nBecause the jury was presented with sufficient evidence via a husband's deposition and trial testimony supporting the jury's determination of the husband's monthly gross income, which included income from two landscaping businesses and a salary from the sheriff's department, which in turn supported a finding of special circumstances warranting an upward modification of child support, the husband was not entitled to a new trial; moreover, to the extent that any error in admitting the husband's landscaping business bank statements could have resulted from the marks or highlights that were on pages sent with the jury, the husband's counsel induced such error by approving the pages beforehand.

App. 777 , 644 S.E.2d 896 (2007).\n\nBecause the overwhelming evidence presented against the defendant supported the convictions, and the defendant failed to assert a timely and contemporaneous objection to the prosecutor's opening statement comments, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motions for a new trial and a mistrial.

App. 762 , 644 S.E.2d 891 (2007).\n\nRape, incest, child molestation, aggravated child molestation, and aggravated sodomy convictions were all upheld on appeal, given that: (1) the elements of child molestation and aggravated child molestation, including venue, were supported by the female victim's testimony; (2) the trial court's charge on the mandatory presumption of consent was proper; as a result, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial.

App. 493 , 649 S.E.2d 597 (2007).\n\nTrial court did not err in denying the defendant's amended motion for a new trial, as defense counsel's trial strategy did not amount to ineffective assistance, the victim's testimony and surrounding evidence supported an aggravated sexual battery conviction, and any error resulting from the trial court's instruction on prior consistent statements was harmless.
