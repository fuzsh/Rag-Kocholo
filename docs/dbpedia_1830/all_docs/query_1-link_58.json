        "text": "Active LSD ship information is updated as status changes.\n\nGator Navy! Todayâs amphibious ships have origins as far back as 1915 when landing craft called âX Lightersâ were built. As amphibious task force requirements have changed, so have the types of amphibious ships.\n\nThe ship types active today are Blue Ridge Class Amphibious Command Ships (LCC), America Class Landing Helicopter Assault (LHA), Wasp Class Landing Helicopter Dock (LHD), San Antonio Class Landing Platform Dock (LPD), and Whidbey Island Class and Harpers Ferry Class Landing Ship Dock (LSD).\n\nABOUT LANDING SHIP DOCK (LSD)\n\nSHIP'S MISSION: To embark, deploy and land elements of a Marine Landing Force in an assault by helicopter, landing craft, amphibious vehicles or by a combination of these methods.\n\nLSD stands for Landing Ship, Dock. The âDâ is reference to a well deck, which is an open space running almost the entire length of the ship, allowing the aft part to sink up to ten feet in order to flood its well deck with water. How it works? The stern gate is lowered, and all or some of the ship's ballast tanks (USS Anchorage had 44) would be filled with sea water, causing the controlled lowering of the stern, allowing water to enter the well deck. Once the well deck is low enough, amphibious landing craft are launched or retrieved.\n\nâWhen we shot tow missiles off the flight deck out by San Clemente Island was the only time when I was onboard that we used all 44 of them. Usually, we only used around 20 of them. We would fill eight on each side then control the up and down with the four largest ones down the center of the ship.â HT3 Eric Tews (10/84-4/88)\n\nAs a dry dock, boats would enter and be secured, the water in ballast tanks pumped back out resulting in the dry docking of the boat(s), and the stern gate lifted. LSDs also have a flight deck for helicopter operations, aviation refueling and fuel storage capabilities, one or two cranes, and multiple small boats.\n\nThe very first class of LSDs was the Ashland Class (LSDs 1-8), followed by the Casa Grande Class (LSDs 13-27), Thomaston Class (LSDs 28-35), Anchorage Class (LSDs 36-40), Whidbey Island Class (LSDs 41-48), and Harpers Ferry Class (LSDs 49-52). NOTE: LSDs 9-12 were delivered to the British Navy.\n\nThe last LSD commissioned was in 1998 and there are ten still active. The decommissioning in 2023 of LSDs 42, 44, 46, and 48 was blocked by congress. The future of LSD ships is currently in question as the US Navy, USMC, and Congress debate amphibious ship procurement and force-level.\n\nLike all Naval ships, LSDs have evolved. The 55 years between the first and last LSD saw the length increase over 150â, vehicle storage capacity increase by almost 7,000 square feet, and ship displacement increase by over 8,100 tons. Original 3â/50 caliber gun mounts have been replaced with modern weapon systems, flight operations have expanded to include multiple landing spots for helicopters up to V-22 Osprey in size, and well decks are larger to accommodate the Navyâs newest amphibious assault landing craft. LSDs have always been able to berth, feed, and transport hundreds of fully equipped combat troops; the last LSD built can hold over 500.\n\nABOUT USS ANCHORAGE (LSD 36)\n\nService Dates: March 15, 1969 - October 1, 2003\n\nCall Sign: NGRQ\n\nLength: 562' Beam: 84' Draft: 19'\n\nWell Deck: 430' x 50'\n\nDisplacement: 15,786 tons full, 9,324 tons light Tonnage: 6,238 tons\n\nSpeed: 20+ knots\n\nCrew: 369 enlisted and officers\n\nLanding Force: 337 enlisted and officers\n\nShip's crest: The Latin term âSui Generisâ is translated to mean âof a particular kind or first of a class.â Symbolized in the anchor and line are stability and security which the ship provided for the U.S. Navy on the high seas. The ship was unique in two respects; first, it was the largest Dock Landing Ship ever constructed and second, it was the first ship to be named after the historical city of Anchorage, Alaska. Finally, the star on the map depicts the largest city in the largest State of the Union --- ANCHORAGE.\n\nUSS Anchorage was lead ship of her class and was the last in class to be decommissioned. The Anchorage Class consisted of five ships; the others were USS Portland (LSD 37), USS Pensacola (LSD 38), USS Mount Vernon (LSD 39), and USS Fort Fisher (LSD 40).\n\nChanges to armament, internal systems, and shipâs boats were made over the years. The four 3â/50 caliber rapid fire gun mounts were replaced with two MK-15 Block 1 CIWS (Close-in Weapon System), two 25mm chain guns, 1 MK 36 Mod 6 SRBOC (Super Rapid Bloom Offboard Countermeasures), and six .50 caliber machine guns. The shipâs boats at commissioning were one LCM-8 (Landing Craft Mechanized, Mark 8), one LCVP (Landing Craft, Vehicle, Personnel), and two 36â LCPLs (Landing Craft, Personnel, Large), one being designated as the Captainâs Gig. Introduction of the LCAC (Landing Craft, Air Cushion) in 1987 meant the LCM-8 and LCVP were no longer needed. When decommissioned in 2003, the ship had just two 36â LCPLs. Two LCAC would be temporarily assigned to the ship when deployed.\n\nThe ship was equipped with movable ramps to move personnel and cargo between any of three levels: well deck, mezzanine deck, and flight deck. The ship was also equipped with machine shops and repair facilities, and along with two 50-ton Boat & Aircraft Cranes; one port, one starboard, could provide dry dock services for vessels up to harbor tug in size. This is when the flight deck could be removed.\n\nThis ship could embark 337 troops and had extensive storage facilities, including 1,400 cubic feet for cargo and ammunition stowage and 8,400 square feet for vehicle storage. Her flight deck had one helicopter spot and could carry two LCAC in the well deck. More landing craft could be carried if the Mezzanine Deck was removed.\n\nUSS Anchorage was the most decorated ship on San Diego's waterfront when decommissioned in 2003, having 17 medals. Besides the following medals, our ship was also awarded the 'Arleigh Burke Fleet Trophy' in 1987 and earned a 'Secretary of the Navy Letter of Commendation' in 1995. Top Row: Combat Action Ribbon, Joint Meritorious Unit Award Second Row: U.S. Navy Unit Commendation (2), Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation (3), Battle \"E\" Ribbon (6) Third Row: Navy Expeditionary Medal, National Defense Service Medal (3), Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal (5) Fourth Row: Vietnam Service Medal (24, 4 Campaigns), Southwest Asia Service Medal (3 Campaigns), Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal Fifth Row: Humanitarian Service Medal (2), Navy and Marine Corps Sea Service Deployment Ribbon (14 Deployments), Philippine Presidential Unit Citation Bottom Row: Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal, Kuwait Liberation Medal - Saudi Arabia, Kuwait Liberation Medal - Kuwait\n\nNOTE: It has been extremely difficult verifying the medals awarded to USS Anchorage. The information above is from NHHC, NDAWS, COMNAVSURFPAC, COMPACFLT, NAVSEA, and numerous others. I do believe this information to be the most accurate found anywhere. I am also trying to verify the âCommand Excellence Awardsâ our ship earned in her 34 years of service; this has been an even bigger task. Once those are found, they will be listed here.\n\nPlease look over the shipâs proud history below, and along with the crew, commemorate this great ship and its prominent place in history.\n\nSHIP'S HISTORY\n\nI would like to thank my shipmates for the invaluable information provided during this multi-year research project. I was able to add to, enhance, and sometimes, even correct the shipâs history currently found online. More detailed information will be added as I go through ship's deck logs being digitized by the National Archives and Records Administration. If you can add information to a year or you think the information provided is incorrect, Email Michael.\n\n\"Personal statements from sailors onboard USS Anchorage or other ship's look like this\" (44 so far).\n\nNOTE: You will see numerous references to equator crossings, with dates and coordinates. There is an initiation rite ceremony performed for those crossing the equator for the very first time, Pollywogs. After the ceremony, a Sailor would be inducted into the \"Solemn Mysteries of the Ancient Order of the Deep\", meaning that King Neptune had accepted them as one of his trusty Shellbacks. This ceremony was deemed to be a form of hazing and Navies of the world started to curtail ceremonies in the 1980's.\n\nNOTE: While in port and/or underway, the ship would conduct a variety of drills and exercises. Helo ops, general quarters, man overboard drills (sometimes using a dummy with retrieval by ship's boat), steering casualty drills, swinging ship drills (to calibrate compass), full power runs, rescue and assistance drills, station changing exercises, fire drills, and more. These drills and/or exercises may be with a group of ships in a variety of formations (i.e., column, column open order, line-abreast, diamond, etc.) or USS Anchorage would detach from formation to perform independently, before returning to formation. Guide ship responsibilities and officer in tactical command (OTC) would be transferred between ships.\n\n1965-1970 | 1971-1974 | 1975-1979 | 1980-1984 | 1985-1989 | 1990-1994 | 1995-1999 | 2000-2010\n\n29 JUN 1965 - AWARD DATE\n\nA contract was awarded to build USS Anchorage. When a vessel gets named, numbered, and congressionally approved, it is added to the Naval Vessel Register, however it is not considered awarded until the official construction contract.\n\n13 MAR 1967 - KEEL LAID\n\n5 MAY 1968 - LAUNCHED\n\nMrs. Virginia Nicholson Heyward, wife of Vice Admiral Alexander S. Heyward, Jr., sponsored the christening.\n\nâI was assigned a room at a local boarding house. I maintained all shipboard radar. Our main job in Pascagoula was prepping the ship for commissioning. Checking in all the equipment - setting up the ET shop and electronic spaces. The ship builders and yard crew did everything else. They along with the skeleton shipâs crew sailed us to Portsmouth, VA. Being on the ship while still under construction at Pascagoula shipyard was interesting. Yard workers had access to the shipâs PA system. Sometimes the language got colorful and with that southern accent - provided a lot of humor for the day!â ETR3 R. Lagowski (12/68-10/70)\n\n20 FEB 1969 - DELIVERY DATE\n\nUSS Anchorage was officially delivered from the builder to the U.S. Navy. The construction contract is not necessarily fulfilled as there are still sea trials and possible repairs or modifications to be made. Sea trials and any post construction shakedowns are conducted by the Navy with a Navy crew and therefore requires the vessel to be in Navy custody.\n\n15 MAR 1969 - COMMISSIONED\n\nUSS Anchorage was moored starboard side Berth 2 and commissioned March 15 at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, Virginia. Commanding Officer is CAPT Percy Stuart Beaman. The shipâs first watch was set, and a 15-gun salute was fired. VADM Luther C. Heinz, Commander Amphibious Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet was onboard.\n\nWith assistance from Navy tugs YT 365, YT 730, and YT 150, the ship was moved to Dry Dock 4 on March 21 and water started to be pumped out at 0950. It rested on keel blocks at 1059. At 1300, the Hull Board, consisting of Executive Officer CDR Robert F. Connally, LT Robert J. Payne, LT Carl S. Clock, and WO1 Robert T. Finney, convened to inspect the underwater hull. Conditions were satisfactory except for minor scratching starboard side below bilge keel, frames 50-195, disturbed paint only; wood scraps found in No. 2 condenser overboard valve, probable cause of leak; starboard bilge keel indented in two places, approximately three inches in depth, frame 132; and zincs approximately 10 percent deteriorated.\n\nOn April 4, the Captain conducted an inspection of mess decks, galley, CPO galley, wardroom, and Commanding Officer's pantry. On April 12, a fire main supply line from the dock ruptured and was repaired. All hull openings were inspected on April 14, before the dry dock flooding started at 0915. The ship cleared her keel blocks at 1320 and with the assistance from Navy tugs YT 536, YT 347, YT 365, and YT 768, was moved back to starboard side Berth 2.\n\nAt 2248 May 1, fuel oil barge YO 263 tied-up port side and started loading fuel. Fueling was completed at 0152 May 2. On May 5, YO 227 loaded fuel from 1655 to 2015. With assistance from Navy tugs YT 768 and YT 536, the ship was moved to change camels on May 6. That evening, the ship took on fuel from YO 177. The Commanding Officer conducted inspections of messing facilities and crew personnel on May 9. Dock trials were performed on May 21. On May 24, the shipâs status changed from âIn Commission Specialâ to âIn Commissionâ.\n\nUSS Anchorage got underway May 26, for the degaussing station, mooring there at 0636. Degaussing cables were rigged at 0950 and degaussing was completed at 1750, with cables unrigged at 1935. The ship got underway the afternoon of May 27 for ammunition loading at Explosive Anchorage EX-1 Hampton Roads, Norfolk, Virginia, anchoring there about an hour later. The ship loaded 1729 rounds 3â/50 caliber ammunition from YFN 305 (Covered Lighter). Civilian technicians came onboard to test the weapons system. On May 28, the ship loaded an additional 820 rounds 3â/50 caliber variable timed (VT) ammunition; 2751 rounds 3â/50 caliber variable timed non-fragmentation ammunition; 328 rounds 3â/50 caliber training ammunition; 58,969 rounds of small arms ammunition; and 1468 rounds pyrotechnics including Very pistol rounds, smoke floats, and smoke pots. After loading, the ship got underway for Charleston, South Carolina, mooring portside Pier Lima 3A, Naval Station Charleston on May 29. The ship took on 73,024 gallons of Navy Standard/Special Fuel Oil (NSFO).\n\nUSS Anchorage got underway with assistance from Navy tug YT 527 on June 2, enroute to Andros Island, Bahamas Islands. Once the ship departed Charleston, it would begin standardization tests which evaluate every facet of an amphibious warship. On June 4, the ship was steaming independently near the Bahamas Islands. On June 5, the LCPL (Landing Craft Personnel Large) was transferred from the well deck to the port side Welin Davit. Standardization tests continued while steaming off Andros Island on June 6, when Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC) personnel boarded from AUTEC 58. AUTEC offers underwater testing, in-air test facilities, and support to U.S., Canadian, British, NATO, and other military and civilian organizations. On June 7, the ship moored port side of Pier 4, Port Everglades, Fort Lauderdale, Florida. On June 8, the ship got underway enroute back to Andros Island. USS Anchorage proceeded to Site 1, AUTEC, Andros Island on June 9. The ship started its journey back to Norfolk, Virginia on June 10. The ship expended 36 rounds 3â/50 caliber blind loaded and tracer (BL&T) ammunition while at general quarters. On June 12, Navy tug YT 765 pulled alongside, and the ship moored port side Pier 5, Berth 52, Naval Station, Norfolk. The ship took on fuel from the pier June 17. More fuel was loaded, and cars were loaded on June 18. Navy tug YT 758 came alongside, and the ship got underway for Annapolis, Maryland on June 24, anchoring at Anchorage Delta at the Severn River entrance. Floating derrick YD 150 pulled alongside to load three 44â yawls on June 25. On June 26, steaming independently, the ship got underway for Norfolk, anchoring at Anchorage North Delta, Hampton Roads a little over nine hours later. Shortly after anchorage, floating derrick YD 214 and Navy tug YT 758 tied up starboard side to load a Ryan FR Fireball airplane. Once the airplane was loaded, the ship got underway for Mayport, Florida. With assistance from Navy tugs YT 404 and YT 523, USS Anchorage moored starboard side to Berth C3, Mayport on June 28. A few hours later, USS Luce (DLG 7) tied up portside. On June 30, the ship moved and tied-up to the port side of USS Kaskaskia (AO 23).\n\nOn July 1, with assistance from Navy tugs YT 549 and YT 403, the ship got underway for Port Everglades, Commander Fleet Air Jacksonville (COMFAIRJAX) operating area. Steaming independently, the ship expended 187 rounds 3â/50 caliber VTNF ammunition while at general quarters. With assistance from tugs Hollywood and Everglades, the ship moored port side to Pier 7, Berth 25, Port Everglades on July 2. On July 7, with assistance from tugs Hollywood and Everglades, the ship, steaming independently, got underway for the Panama Canal. On July 15, the ship anchored at Anchorage C2, Colon, Panama Canal Zone Harbor. USS Anchorage got underway for Naval Station Rodman, on July 16. Operational control was transferred to Commander in Chief, Pacific Fleet (CINCPACFLT) and the ship was steaming as part of Task Unit 16.8.5. That same day, with assistance from tug Hugh Rodman, the ship moored starboard side to Pier 1, Naval Station Rodman, Canal Zone Panama.\n\n\"We stopped for a few days to visit Panama City before heading north to San Diego. I was the assistant supply officer at the time in charge of the laundry and other services, including disbursing. At that time, I paid the crew in cash. While in Panama the laundry clothes dryer crashed due to a stripped gear in the machine. We only had one dryer aboard the ship. I was unable to procure a replacement part for the large gear, so the Machinist Mate guys fabricated one from steel bar stock. The stripped gear was very large, about a foot in diameter. The newly fabricated gear worked perfectly until we got to San Diego, and I could procure a replacement. Without the great job of the MMs, we would have been unable to operate the laundry until arriving in San Diego. In my opinion, the lack of a second dryer was a huge design flaw in the ship.\" LTJG Danny Casey (6/68-12/69)\n\nâI was A-Division Officer and the actual guy who performed the magic on the huge piece of brass was my lead petty officer, EN1 C.W. Van Horn. He spent the entire day of the canal traverse from Colon to Panama City in the shop at the milling machine turning that huge block of brass into a very complicated gear on the pre-computer machine. I would pop-in regularly to see his progress and then go topside to see the Panama jungle, then back in to keep Van Horn company. Long day but Danny needed his dryer gear!â LTJG George Mellen (8/68-6/71)\n\nTug Hugh Rodman assisted with the ship getting underway on July 18, enroute to San Diego. On July 26, with the assistance from Navy tug YT 374, the ship moored starboard side to Pier 5, Berth 55, Naval Station San Diego. On July 29, YON 91 was coming alongside for refueling, when it hit port side aft of the ship, causing slight damage.\n\nUSS Anchorage conducted final acceptance trials August 11-12 in international waters and while anchored at Anchorage 147, Coronado Roads. On August 12, with assistance from Navy tugs YT 701 and YT 405, the ship retuned to Pier 5, Berth 55 in San Diego. With assistance from Navy tug YT 701, the ship got underway and moored both fore and aft to Buoys 23 and 24 in San Diego Bay from August 22 to September 2. On that day, and for most of September, the ship was in and out of San Diego Bay conducting a variety of drills and exercises during fleet training exercises.\n\nOn September 2, the ship left San Diego Bay, returned to a mooring just off Harbor Island at Anchorage 212, then left San Diego Bay again. The ship was in and out of San Diego Bay three times September 3-4, then remained in international waters for the next three days. While at general quarters three times on September 5, the ship expended a total of 265 rounds 3â/50 caliber VTNF ammunition and 68 high explosive projectiles with 68 full service smokeless powder cartridges. The ship returned to San Diego Bay and with assistance from Navy tug YT 763, moored to Buoys 23 and 24 September 7. Navy tug YT 772 assisted getting underway September 8, and on that day, while at general quarters, the ship expended 170 rounds 3â/50 caliber VTNF ammunition and 12 rounds 3â/50 caliber VTF ammunition. On September 9, USS Anchorage expended 68 rounds 3â/50 caliber BL&P ammunition during general quarters, returned to San Diego Bay Anchorage 212, then got underway for international waters. The ship was operating with USS El Dorado (LCC 11), USS Ogden (LPD 5), and USCGC Washusett (WHEC 44) in formation with Task Unit 54.1.6 on September 10. On September 11, the ship returned to San Diego Bay, Harbor Island Anchorage 213 and departed once again. USS Anchorage was operating independently on September 12 and conducted underway refueling exercises with USS Platte (AO 24) before Navy tug YT 774 assisted with mooring back at Buoys 23 and 24. The ship stayed at this anchorage through September 15. On that day, Navy tug YT 782 assisted with getting underway and after entering international waters, the ship expended 20 rounds 3â/50 caliber VTNF ammunition and 121 rounds 3â/50 caliber VTF ammunition while at general quarters. The ship returned to San Diego Bay for a brief time, then returned to international waters. After a couple of days in international waters, USS Anchorage returned to San Diego Bay on September 17. That same day, the ship left San Diego Bay, returned to Anchorage 213, then returned to international waters to conduct high line exercises with USS Ogden (LPD 5). On September 18, the ship conducted towing exercises, both towing and being towed, with USS Platte (AO 24), before returning to a mooring at Buoys 23 and 24, with assistance from Navy tug YT 763. On September 19, USS Anchorage departed San Diego Bay to conduct Battle Problem Exercises before returning to Anchorage 212 just off Harbor Island. About an hour later, the ship then moved to a mooring starboard side Pier 8, Berth 81 where it remained until moving to Pier 8, Berth 86 on October 7.\n\nOn October 13, the ship moved to a mooring at Buoys 53 and 54, where it lowered its stern gate, conducted amphibious training exercises, and took on LCMs. After loading, Navy tug YT 764 assisted with getting underway enroute to Del Mar, California. On October 14, the ship anchored at Anchorage 300 off Camp Del Mar, ballasted down, took on LVTs, and conducted multiple amphibious landings with the LCMs and LVTs. After the LCMs were back onboard, the ship got underway for Anchorage 172 off Coronado Roads. USS Anchorage conducted multiple amphibious landings with the LCMs October 15-16, even leaving and returning to Anchorage 172. After more amphibious landing exercises on October 17, the ship returned to a mooring port side Pier 8, Berth 86. The ship returned to Coronado Roads anchoring right flank Boat Lane 4 on October 20. Multiple amphibious landing exercises were held each day through October 24, when the ship returned to a port side mooring at Pier 8, Berth 86. USS Anchorage took on 26,292 gallons of JP5 from YOG 88 on October 28.\n\nThe ship got underway steaming independently to San Francisco Naval Shipyard, Mare Island, Vallejo, California on October 29, for post-shakedown availability. On October 30, while enroute, the ship expended an âunknown numberâ of rounds 3â/50 caliber BL&P ammunition, an âunknown numberâ of rounds 3â/50 caliber VTNF ammunition, and an âunknown numberâ of rounds 3â/50 caliber high explosive proximity ordinance (HEPO) ammunition while at general quarters. Navy tugs YT 759 and YT 180 assisted with mooring at Pier 2, Berth 1 Mare Island on October 31. The ship offloaded all stored ammunition and moved to a starboard side mooring to a pier at Point Molate Naval Fuel Depot to offload fuel. The ship completed offloading 320,368 gallons of fuel on November 1. On that day, the ship moved to a mooring starboard side Pier 21, Berth 21 South at Mare Island. On November 4, with Navy tug YTM 777 tied portside aft and YTM 190 portside amidships, the ship was moved to Dry Dock 3. USS Anchorage crossed the dry dock sill at 0907, water was pumped out, and the ship rested on keel blocks at 1056.\n\nUSS Anchorage would remain on keel blocks until December 29, when hull inspections were conducted before leaving dry dock. Flooding commenced at 1110, stopped at 1130, started at 1230, and stopped at 1245. All spaces were inspected for watertight integrity before flooding started again at 1305. The ship cleared keel blocks at 1312, with the stern crossing the sill at 1505 and the bow crossing at 1520.

After leaving Subic Bay, the ship would make a trip to Kure, Japan, in early March, to participate in amphibious exercises. USS Anchorage earned a Vietnam Service Medal for the period of March 21. On March 31, USS Anchorage got underway to rendezvous with Task Group 76.5, joining them in operations off the coast of Vietnam April 2-May 6. USS Anchorage earned a Vietnam Service Medal for the period April 1-May 7.\n\nThe ship was at Subic Bay from May 9 to 18 and then returned to waters off Vietnam for wet-well lifts to Vung Tau, Hoi An, and Da Nang. While off Vietnam, USS Anchorage took part in Operation Song Than 6-72, meaning âtsunamiâ in Vietnamese. The amphibious landing took place on May 24, after artillery, air, and naval gunfire strikes on Red Beach. USS Mobile departed Gulf of Tonkin on May 25, leaving her four LCM-6's (Landing Craft, Mechanized) with USS Anchorage to provide additional landing craft to support operations. Multiple LCM-6s from the USS Anchorage were called in to rescue South Vietnamese Marines from an LVT (Amphibious Vehicle, Tracked) which was dead in the water just off the beach.\n\nOne of the LCM-6 coxswains had to enter the water to attach a tow line to the stranded LVT, which was then towed back to the shipâs well deck. The rescued Marines recovered onboard before being removed by helicopter. While this rescue mission was taking place, the North Vietnamese Army was firing on U.S. Navy ships offshore. USS Anchorage was never hit; however, the shipâs recovery boats did take fire and were close enough to have been sprayed with water from exploding shells.\n\nâI remember that day. I was a signalman assigned to a landing craft. I recall one artillery round fired at the group of ships standing off the beach. It landed harmlessly in the general vicinity of two or three vessels. I remember the geyser created on impact. The immediate response was for all ships to move further out. I suppose it was just pure luck none of the ships were hit, but we all thought it was fairly comical at the time.â SM3 Richard Brinton (2/71-1/74)\n\nâWe were called to GQ early in the morning and I believe we were going to drop Vietnamese marines ashore. We were all at our stations when all of a sudden the ships out beyond us started a barrage onto the shoreline, that finished and everything went quiet, out of nowhere the air started shaking from a B-52 run (never even saw them), everything went quiet again, out of where jets came in a did a low level run dropping napalm (that was pretty spectacular), everything went quiet again. Time for us to do our job. The Duluth was first to go (we were making a big U shape). As we started our run (we had a destroyer between us and the shore), there were three outbound shells that overshot the destroyer and landed in the water between us and the destroyer. As soon as that was noticed the destroyer turned its guns and fired multiple rounds at a mound (the guns were basically firing at point bank range, no barrel elevation). Nothing more was heard. We continued our objective, made the U-turn, and headed back out to sea. This was all quite surreal as we watched from the flight deck and fantail.â SF3 Robert Van Der Borg (10/69-9/72)\n\nUSS Anchorage earned a Combat Action Ribbon for the period of May 24 and a Vietnam Service Medal for the period May 19-June 11.\n\nAfter Vietnam, the ship arrived Okinawa on June 14 to embark troops bound for the Philippines. She would arrive Subic Bay on June 20. During a series of amphibious landing exercises, the embarked troops were transferred, and the four LCM-6âs left behind in the Gulf of Tonkin were returned, to USS Mobile. USS Anchorage would then resume wet-well operations between Vung Tau and Subic Bay. USS Anchorage earned a Vietnam Service Medal for the period June 24-26 and June 29-July 1.\n\nUSS Anchorage visited Kaohsiung, Taiwan in early July, then arrived back at Subic Bay on July 8 because of a leaking rudder. While enroute, pumps ran constantly trying to empty the bilge. USS Anchorage was placed in a floating dry dock for repairs. A job that normally takes multiple days was completed in a 24-hour period, and the ship left the Philippines on July 9. The ship arrived in San Diego on July 24. On August 10, CAPT Robert Newton Congdon relieved CAPT Cyrus Albert Rank as Commanding Officer. USS Anchorage remained in port through December 4, when she got underway for independent type exercises off the southern California coast. The ship returned to San Diego on December 7 and entered a holiday leave and upkeep status.\n\n1973-1974\n\nDEPLOYMENT - DECEMBER 1973 to APRIL 1974\n\nEQUATOR CROSSING at LATITUDE 0° 0' 0\" LONGITUDE 84Â° 40' 0\" E on FEBRUARY 22, 1974\n\nAfter local operations, USS Anchorage traveled to Seal Beach late in January 1973 to unload ammunition. The ship returned to San Diego on February 1 and began overhaul at Naval Base San Diego on February 19. During this yard work, a fire broke out on board and prolonged her stay in overhaul.\n\nâI was on the quarter deck as Petty Officer of the Watch when the call came in. The caller reported the fire then hung up before giving a location. I had to use the PA to get him to call back. He then gave misinformation on the location because he was just out of boot camp and gave the compartment number where he was calling back from and not of the fire. It took a while to find the fire. Until they reached him, they only knew it was below, aft. The boot had been assigned to fire watch with a welder.â GM3 Glen Larsen (10/69-7/73)\n\nOn September 23, CDR Louis Pelayo Aldana relieved CDR Robert Newton Congdan as Commanding Officer, and the ship finally got underway for sea trials. Amphibious refresher training started in late October to prepare for the upcoming WESTPAC deployment. On December 8, USS Anchorage got underway, arriving at its first stop, Guam, Mariana Islands, on December 25. On December 26, the ship departed for Subic Bay, Republic of the Philippines via the San Bernardino Strait, arriving January 1.\n\nThe ship started 1974 in port before getting underway for Buckner Bay, Okinawa on January 9. The rest of January had the ship underway to Pohang, South Korea January 14-16; to Iwakuni, Japan via the Shimonoseki Straits January 16-18; back to Pohang January 18-20; Pohang to Sasebo, Japan January 20-22; in port Sasebo January 22-27; back to Pohang January 28-29; and took part in Exercise Fly-A-Way while enroute to Pusan, South Korea January 29-February 1.\n\nUSS Anchorage was in Pusan February 1-4, then traveled to Subic Bay by way of Okinawa, arriving Subic February 12. On February 14, the ship got underway for Diego Garcia, Chagos Archipelago via the Malacca Strait via Nelson Island, crossing the equator February 22, arriving February 25. The ship would remain in Diego Garcia through March 11. She would then move on to Singapore, and after a two day stay, start the journey home March 21.\n\nUSS Anchorage would then make stops in Subic Bay March 24-27, travel to Guam Marh 28-April 3, to Pearl Harbor April 3-10, and to San Diego April 11-18. The ship traveled a total of 25,128 miles while on this deployment.\n\nUSS Anchorage entered a stand-down period which lasted through July 29. On that day she headed northward to conduct a survey mission of potential amphibious training areas in Alaska; embarked scientists surveyed ten possible landing sites. On this survey mission, helicopter number 6, from Marine Light Helicopter Squadron 267 Detachment C, completed the detachmentâs 200th successful round-trip from the shipâs flight deck.\n\nThe ship visited Seattle, Washington; Nanaimo, British Columbia; and Sitka and Anchorage, Alaska, before returning to San Diego on September 5. USS Anchorage began a restricted availability in Long Beach, California on October 17. The crew generally had a four-day work week, so that those commuting to/from San Diego could spend more time with family and less time on the road. After the work was completed on December 16, she returned to her home port of San Diego for the holidays.\n\n\"As I recall the Anchorage had a 600 PSI propulsion plant until it went into dry dock in Long Beach about 1974. The engineering plant had been disassembled and hauled back to National Steel in San Diego for refurbishment where it was destroyed in a fire at the repair facility. The ship left the yard with a hybrid 1200 PSI plant. There were not enough 600 PSI parts in the supply system to rebuild the damaged unit.â LTJG Chuck Johnson (7/72-5/75)\n\nBACK TO 1965\n\n1975\n\nDEPLOYMENT - MARCH to NOVEMBER\n\nOn January 6, the ship began two weeks of amphibious refresher training off the southern California coast. USS Anchorage got underway on January 28 along with Amphibious Squadron (PHIBRON) 5 ships USS Cleveland (LPD 7), USS Denver (LPD 9), USS Mount Vernon (LSD 39), USS Mobile (LKA 115), USS Barbour County (LST 1195), and USS Racine (LST 1191), to participate in the amphibious exercise Operation Bedstream. While off Coronado Roads, Southern California, the ship conducted live-fire exercises along with USS Denver (LPD 9) and USS Canon (PG 90).\n\nAfter a period of upkeep in San Diego, USS Anchorage again departed as part of Task Force 76 and PHIBRON 5, for WESTPAC on March 28. The ship was joined by USS Duluth (LPD 6), and USS Tuscaloosa (LST 1187). USS Anchorage was in Pearl Harbor April 4-6; Iwakuni and Numazu, Japan April 18-21; Okinawa Japan on April 23, and Subic Bay, Republic of the Philippines on April 28. The ship, along with Marines and their equipment, anchored off the South Vietnam coast April 30 to participate in Operation Frequent Wind, originally named Operation Talon Vise. USS Anchorage earned a Meritorious Unit Commendation for the period April 22-30 and an Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal and Humanitarian Service Medal for the period April 29-30. The ship, along with USS Denver (LPD 9), USS Duluth (LPD 6), and USS Mobile (LKA 115) were designated Task Group 76.9 - Movement Transport Group Charlie. USS Anchorage provided material support to ships evacuating Vietnamese refugees. On May 2, she left the Vung Tau holding area with the other ships involved.\n\nOn May 13, the shipâs scheduled operations were interrupted by the Mayaguez incident. USS Anchorage was ordered to proceed south to provide support as needed for the rescue of the SS Mayaguez, a U.S. merchant ship that had been seized by the Khmer Rouge. Following the ship's rescue, USS Anchorage resumed her original schedule which included upkeep in Sasebo, Japan from May 24 to June 10; a visit to Keelung, Taiwan June 16-20; and a port call to Inchon, South Korea June 28-July 5. While in Inchon, on June 28, CDR Arthur St. Clair Wright relieved CDR Louis Pelayo Aldana as Commanding Officer.\n\nFor the next several months the ship would crisscross the Pacific. Along with a return to South Korea, multiple stops were made between Japan, Subic Bay, and Hong Kong. After just a few months, another change in command took place on September 1, when CDR John Robert Lund relieved CDR Arthur St. Clair Wright as Commanding Officer while at port in Hong Kong. Most of September had the ship avoiding several typhoons in the area before proceeding to Yokosuka for upkeep October 3-18. Following stops at Keelung October 25-26 and Buckner Bay, Japan October 27-28, the ship departed Okinawa on the 28th for a return to her home port.\n\nBefore heading home, USS Anchorage and six other ships of PHIBRON 5, took part in Operation Polymode (Mid-Ocean Dynamics Experiment), which ran from October 28 to November 9. Operation Polymode was a survey to collect ocean surface layer salinity and upper thermal structure data in a broad swath between Japan and Hawaii. The seven ships rendezvoused and proceeded to the study area, where they lined up abreast, 25 nautical miles apart, taking measurements every two hours.\n\nAfter one last stop in Pearl Harbor November 9-10 the ship arrived in San Diego on November 16. The ship remained in port for upkeep and local operations through the end of the year.\n\nâI was on deck when we slipped past the USS Arizona (BB 39) at sunset with the bugler blowing taps. I was on the starboard side at the edge of the flight deck. Sun fading, the lone bugler blowing those 4 mournful notes. That moment in time is one that I will carry with me for the rest of my life.â FTG2 Barry Dichter (11/74-2/77)\n\n1976\n\nUp until mid-April, USS Anchorage continued local operations off the southern California coast. From April 26 through June 17, the ship was in restricted availability in preparation for a bicentennial visit to Alaska. However, that trip was cancelled, and the ship was in port at San Diego from mid-August through December undergoing repairs. During this time, on November 24, CDR Paul Ishamel Bledsoe relieved CDR John Robert Lund as Commanding Officer.\n\n1977\n\nDEPLOYMENT - MARCH to NOVEMBER\n\nEQUATOR CROSSING at LATITUDE 0° 0' 0\" LONGITUDE 105Â° 56' 0\" E on JULY 25\n\nTests and inspections occupied USS Anchorage through mid-March before another WESTPAC deployment began on March 28. USS Anchorage stopped briefly at Pearl Harbor, then pushed on to Enewetak Atoll, Marshall Islands, to unload cargo and vehicles. The ship also visited Guam; Subic Bay and Iloilo, Republic of the Philippines; Singapore; Hong Kong; Keelung, Taiwan; and Yokosuka, Japan. While underway in the waters south of Singapore, USS Anchorage crossed the equator on July 25.\n\nâI will never forget my crossing experience in â77. How could I? I crawled on my hands and knees the entire time, had my face rubbed in grease that was spread on someoneâs stomach, was submersed in a coffin of water with small drainage holes at the top, crawled through a collapsed tunnel of garbage that had been stored for weeks/months in a special locker, and pieces of firehose were used as a âspankingâ tool. How hard? Depended on the Shellback. I would never give up that experience.â BMSN Michael P. McGrath (5/76-/1/78)\n\nAmong the amphibious exercises in which the ship participated was Operation Fortress Lightning from October 10 to 23, held in waters near Santa Cruz, Mindanao Island, Philippines. Nearly 100 Navy and Marine Corps commands were involved in the planning of this exercise and the operational order consisted of almost 1000 pages; 30 U.S. Navy ships with thousands of Marines and 135 aircraft participated.\n\n\"While piloting the LCPL during amphibious landings, I experienced the heaviest rain ever felt. Buckets! No, I mean it felt like getting hit with buckets.\" BMSN Michael P. McGrath (5/76-/1/78)\n\nâI remember that day as well. Spent most of it standing on the signal bridge watching landing craft and getting soaked. Later that evening we lost radar contact with the boats due to the pouring rain. We had to look for them using the searchlights on the signal bridge. Never saw crap, too dark and rainy.â SMSA Dennis Pard (2/77-8/80)\n\nJust before the exercise was over, on October 21, a CH-53D dropped off a cliff and fell 400 feet into the Philippine jungle, killing 24 of the 37 onboard.\n\nâI remember that one! Sitting in CIC and the request for body bags came over the net. Sad day.â OS2 Curt Folstad (4/76-12/79)\n\nUpon the conclusion of this exercise, the ship started the trip home, stopping at Guam, and Hawaii. USS Anchorage arrived San Diego on November 17 and spent the rest of the year in upkeep.\n\n1978\n\nUSS Anchorage participated in training operations along the California coast in January. On February 20, the ship got underway for Bremerton, Washington to carry Army troops to their home base. The ship arrived back in San Diego on March 3 and began preparations for overhaul. USS Anchorage earned a Meritorious Unit Commendation for the period March 31, 1978-May 11, 1979. On April 14 she got underway, in tow of USS Abnaki (ATF 96), for the Long Beach Naval Shipyard. Overhaul started the next day. On August 29, CDR Robert Douglas Forster relieved CDR Paul Ishamel Bledsoe as Commanding Officer. Upon completion of overhaul work, the ship resumed operations and began sea trials December 13.\n\n1979\n\nâIt was around 1979 when I was operating the port crane to cradle the ramp. BM3 Vandyke was giving the signals when all of a sudden, the hydraulics gave way and dropped the ramp in the well deck. There were 3 or 4 guys tending lines, they smartly took off running. No one was hurt. The hot hydraulic fluid burned me a bit but that was about it. We probably had every officer out on the catwalks to see what had happened. It's a pretty memorable experience to say the least.â BMSN Jeff Fisher (3/77-4/81)\n\nUSS Anchorage returned to San Diego on January 15 and through September, the ship was involved in post-overhaul maintenance and training and operated along the southern California coast holding amphibious refresher training. USS Anchorage earned a Meritorious Unit Commendation for the period March 31, 1978-May 11, 1979. On September 24, the ship got underway to take part in Fleet Exercise 2-79/Kernel Potlatch II, a joint American-Canadian fleet exercise. Having concluded a successful amphibious landing on the northern coast of Vancouver Island, the ship made a port call at Esquimalt, British Columbia.\n\nâWe were on an amphibious exercise in the Scott islands. Seas were dangerously high. Mike boats were breached on the shore and personnel were injured.â QM3 Tim Douglas (9/77-9/79)\n\nAfter debarking Marines at Camp Pendleton, USS Anchorage returned to San Diego on October 13. The ship participated in local operations and training exercises through the end of the year in preparation for a deployment in January.\n\nBACK TO 1965\n\n1980\n\nDEPLOYMENT - JANUARY to JULY\n\nEQUATOR CROSSING at LATITUDE 0° 0' 0\" LONGITUDE 65Â° 05' 0\" E on MARCH 10\n\nEQUATOR CROSSING at LATITUDE 0° 000' 0\" LONGITUDE 000Â° 00' 0\" E on MAY 4 *need coordinates\n\nOn January 4, as part of Amphibious Squadron (PHIBRON) 3, USS Anchorage deployed enroute to Pearl Harbor. After Pearl Harbor she would go on to visit Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands, and Guam in the Mariana Islands before arriving at Subic Bay, Republic of the Philippines February 6. Upon arrival, a refurbished LCU (Landing Craft, Utility) was loaded for transport to the Republic of Djibouti located on the northeast coast of East Africa near the Horn of Africa. The LCUâdubbed Le Bac de la Paix (the boat of peace) was a gift from the United States to Djibouti to enhance the country's inadequate commercial transportation system. USS Anchorage left Subic Bay on February 15 to begin her goodwill mission.\n\nâThe ships Library was in pretty bad shape, so I offered to clean and reorganize the space in return for using it in our gaming sessions. We had crew from several departments playing together. It was great to hear stories of last night's adventure in the breakfast chow line. I believe I was the first crew member with a personal computer on board, an Apple ][+. My Chief hated it, but the Ensign liked it so much he allowed me to keep it in his stateroom. I finally got chewed out by the Captain for being spotted in officer's country too often.â ET2 Harold Miller (12/79-12/80)\n\nSteaming by way of Singapore, the ship crossed the Indian Ocean and arrived in Djibouti on March 3. USS Anchorage spent two days in Djibouti, delivering America's gift and helping to cement relations between the two governments and peoples. From Djibouti, the ship headed for Diego Garcia, Chagos Archipelago to deliver barges to that isolated American outpost in the middle of the Indian Ocean. USS Anchorage crossed the equator on March 10. The ship was at Diego Garcia from March 12 to 15 and then resumed her voyage back to the Philippines. USS Anchorage earned a Navy Expeditionary Medal for the period February 23-March 19. She made a stop at Penang, Malaysia, along the way and reentered Subic Bay on March 24.\n\nâI remember QMC Felix (a plank holder) teaching me to use a sextant; our electronic nav gear sometimes put us in very strange locations.â ET2 Harold Miller (12/79-12/80)\n\nDuring the three months that remained of her deployment, USS Anchorage conducted operations in surroundings more familiar to 7th Fleet ships than the Horn of Africa and the Indian Ocean. In early April, USS Anchorage visited Hong Kong before embarking Marine Corps units April 17-18 at Okinawa, Japan. From Okinawa, USS Anchorage sailed via Subic Bay and Singapore to Thailand where she joined elements of the Royal Thai Navy and the Royal Thai Marine Corps in amphibious training exercises. After these exercises, the ship would visit Pattaya, Thailand May 5-10. The ship made its second equator crossing on May 4, and it was rumored to be because a Marine general wanted an equator crossing listed in his record. USS Anchorage returned to Subic Bay on May 19 and remained in port until early June. On June 6, the ship got underway to return the embarked Marines to their base at Okinawa. She stopped at Naha, Okinawa, from June 10 to 12 and then returned to sea for the voyage back to the United States. The trip home included a two-day stop at Pearl Harbor June 24-26 and ended back at San Diego on July 3.\n\nAfter the usual month of relative inactivity following an overseas deployment, USS Anchorage began West Coast operations early in August with a courtesy visit to Seattle, Washington for the city's annual Seafair, which is one of the largest festivals in the Northwest, reaching over two million people. Operations continued until late September when the ship returned to San Diego for two-month availability. On October 1, CDR William Robert McCann relieved CDR Robert Douglas Forster as Commanding Officer. The ship completed repairs on November 20 and resumed operations out of her homeport.\n\n1981\n\nDEPLOYMENT - JUNE to DECEMBER\n\nVarious training evolutions occupied her time through May and into June. On June 23, USS Anchorage departed to join the 7th Fleet in Southeast Asia.\n\nâRight after we secured from sea and anchor detail, the XO called me to his quarters. He had a job for me since I was the new engineering log room yeoman. He said no bridge watches for me until we got to Hawaii and my work hours would be at knock off until morning. Just a little typing. Seems that the procedures book for the engine rooms was a bit out of date. So, I typed my brains out the whole trip to Hawaii. It seemed to have been very important to the propulsion plant certification.â YNSN/YNFN Michael Ball (4/79-12/82)\n\nThe ship stopped at Pearl Harbor at the beginning of July and remained in the Hawaiian Islands for the first three weeks of the month completing an oft-delayed propulsion plant certification.\n\nâIn Hawaii is when we almost flooded the #2 Main Machinery Room (MMR). The ballast tank hatch wasn't bolted down after it was opened for some reason, planned maintenance, I guess. The ship went to General Quarters because of the flooding. Tense 30 minutes. We were ballasting down and water in MMR started coming up. We stopped and ballasted back up and found the open cover in the bilges and it got bolted down. HT's took care of it. Water got to the very bottom of #2 Boiler. No damage.â BT Hank Watson (7/79-2/83)\n\nOn July 22, she resumed her voyage west. USS Anchorage stopped at Buckner Bay, Okinawa, Japan on August 3 and embarked Marine Corps units for transportation to Yokosuka, Japan. Throughout her assignment with the 7th Fleet, USS Anchorage spent much of her time carrying Marines between their bases and training exercises. In some cases, the ship would participate, in others, she simply provided transportation to the exercise. The ship frequented ports in Okinawa, South Korea, and sometimes a Thai port. USS Anchorage completed her last 7th Fleet mission at Naha, Okinawa, in November, and got underway for the return to California on November 21. Enroute, she made an 11-day visit to Guam and a brief, one-day pause at Pearl Harbor, before arriving San Diego December 23.\n\n1982\n\nPost-deployment leave and upkeep carried USS Anchorage through January. After a brief period underway in the southern California operating area, USS Anchorage began preparations at the end of January for regular overhaul at San Diego. The actual repair and modification work began on March 1. Over the next seven months in dry dock, the ship received general repairs and upgrading throughout as well as work on her propulsion plant, modernization of her communications spaces, and an enhancement of her defense capability against anti-ship missiles. On September 25, CDR Raymond Robert Kruszona relieved CDR William Robert McCann Jr. as Commanding Officer. USS Anchorage conducted sea trials in the local operating area during the first half of November and then spent the remainder of the year in port.\n\n1983-1984\n\nDEPLOYMENT - SEPTEMBER 1983 to MARCH 1984\n\nHOMEPORT CHANGED TO LONG BEACH in AUGUST 1984\n\nUSS Anchorage resumed operations out of San Diego early in 1983. In May, the ship paid a courtesy visit to her namesake city, Anchorage, Alaska. A few days after leaving Alaska, a shipâs roving patrol found a stowaway in a troop berthing mop closet. A crew member had brought a girl onboard for the return trip home and a Coast Guard helicopter was used to remove her.\n\nAfter USS Anchorage returned to San Diego in the middle of June, the ship began a three-month availability in preparation for a deployment to the Western Pacific that is scheduled to start in the middle of September. Except for a period underway August 22-31, USS Anchorage was in San Diego continuously from June 11 to September 12.\n\nOn September 12, the ship got underway with Amphibious Squadron (PHIBRON) 7 on her way to Southeast Asia. The usual stop at Pearl Harbor lasted from September 20 to October 2, and then USS Anchorage resumed the voyage west. The ship arrived in Yokosuka, Japan on October 14 and stayed through October 30. The ship got underway on November 1 to shuttle Marine Corps units between their bases and training exercises. On occasion, USS Anchorage would join in the exercises to practice the shipâs role as an amphibious warship. The shipâs deployment would continue through the end of 1983.\n\nUSS Anchorage returned to Yokosuka to disembark her last Marines at the end of January 1984 and remained there until the beginning of the second week in February. On February 8, USS Anchorage set out upon the first leg of the voyage back to the United States. On her way, she made stops at Guam and Pearl Harbor before arriving San Diego on March 6. Except for a brief period underway inside the port on April 17, USS Anchorage remained moored at San Diego Naval Station for almost five months performing repairs and modifications. Near the end of July, the ship began sea trials out of San Diego that lasted into the fourth week in August. On August 23 USS Anchorage made the brief passage from San Diego to her new homeport of Long Beach, California. USS Anchorage took about two weeks to get settled into her new base of operations and then embarked upon a series of training evolutions in the local operating area. Except for times in port for upkeep or repairs, drills and exercises were the routine through the remainder of 1984. On December 1, CDR Michael Dennis Quigley relieved CDR Raymond Robert Kruszona as Commanding Officer.\n\nBACK TO 1965\n\n1985\n\nDEPLOYMENT - MARCH to SEPTEMBER\n\nUpkeep was performed in the first quarter and on March 27, USS Anchorage left Long Beach for Southeast Asia. The ship stopped at Sasebo, Japan, on April 16 to pick up mail and then arrived at Pohang, South Korea, on April 17. While at Pohang, USS Anchorage embarked Marines and set sail for Okinawa, Japan on April 18.\n\nFor the next four months, the ship crisscrossed the Pacific delivering Marines to various points for combat training and returning them to their bases. USS Anchorage would sometimes join in the training to practice the shipâs role as an amphibious warship. The final group of Marines came on board at Yokohama, Japan, August 9-11 and disembarked at Buckner Bay, Okinawa, on August 14. The ship began the trip home August 15.\n\nAfter stopping at Pearl Harbor August 26-28, USS Anchorage arrived at Long Beach on September 4. The ship entered a post-deployment stand-down period and returned to active operations on October 10, when it would take part in local operations for the remainder of the year.\n\n1986\n\nLocal operations continued through 1986. On December 11, CDR Michael Clark Wein relieved CDR Michael Dennis Quigley as Commanding Officer.\n\n1987\n\nDEPLOYMENT - JANUARY to JULY\n\nEQUATOR CROSSING at LATITUDE 0° 0' 0\" LONGITUDE 151Â° 18' 5\" on MAY 24\n\nEQUATOR & INTERNATIONAL DATE LINE CROSSING at LATITUDE 0° 0' 0\" LONGITUDE 180° 0' 0\" on JUNE 23\n\nUSS Anchorage departed Long Beach in January for another deployment. The ship first headed north to Alaska and while with Amphibious Squadron (PHIBRON) 3 in the Bering Sea, took part in Kernel Potlatch 87. This was the first winter amphibious operation in the Aleutian Islands since World War II, and for this, USS Anchorage earned a Meritorious Unit Commendation. Afterwards, the ship would continue her journey with ports of call in Subic Bay, Republic of the Philippines; Okinawa, Japan; Pohang and Pusan, South Korea; Pattaya, Thailand; Hobart, Tasmania; and Pearl Harbor. During her time in the Pacific Ocean USS Anchorage also took part in Team Spirit 87, the 12th annual joint exercise with the South Korean military.\n\nWhile on WESTPAC ... âI went back to rotate watches and the watch was missing. The sound-power headphones were hanging over the side and his ball cap was on the deck. This was during the early evening but dark as hell. We sounded man overboard alarm. The fleet was circling out to find him. We all had binoculars looking for him. They found him a half hour later. He was sleeping in one of the compartments below. That dude went to see the Captain.â BMSN Ron Hayes (86-7/87)\n\nUSS Anchorage crossed the equator on May 24. On May 29, the ship was called to help the USS Belleau Wood (LHA 3), which had been drifting for five days after losing power to both engines and one of two generators.\n\nâWe were bobbing like a cork.â FC1 Terry Davenport USS Belleau Wood (LHA 3)\n\n\"I believe it was GMG3 Allen who did finally make the shot when they succeeded. It took a few tries because navigating directly in front of us without a collision in less than smooth seas was difficult. Not to mention our flight deck at 63 feet was significantly higher than the fantail of the Anchorage. The crew of both ships and all involved did a great job in a difficult situation.\" FC2 Tony DeLuca USS Belleau Wood (LHA 3)\n\nOn May 29, after several failed attempts to transfer a tow line by pulling alongside, USS Anchorage launched a small boat to facilitate the transfer. USS Anchorage towed USS Belleau Wood toward Sydney for repairs, but after a few days, USS Belleau Wood was finally able to repair its boilers enough to continue under its own power. USS Anchorage took her place in Tasmania.\n\nIn a Seventh Fleet Public Affairs Press Release dated June 22, it was announced that USS Anchorage was awarded the Arleigh Burke Fleet Trophy, which is presented annually and demonstrates the greatest improvement in battle efficiency from the previous year.\n\nUSS Anchorage crossed the equator and International Dateline simultaneously on June 23. The ship returned to Long Beach on July 9.\n\nUSS Anchorage participated in the San Francisco Fleet Week held on October 10.\n\n1988\n\nUSS Anchorage participated in Exercise Kernel Blitz 88-1, held February 1-12. This free-play exercise involved the 5th MEB (Marine Expeditionary Brigade) and Amphibious Squadron (PHIBRON) 3 and took place off San Clemente Island and at Camp Pendleton, California. The Navy-Marine Corps exercise was the first major attempt to develop and execute a tactical theme compatible with the new concepts and weapons pertinent to amphibious warfare developed in recent years. In March, USS Anchorage set off for a solo voyage to Ensenada, Mexico for a weekend visit.\n\nIn April USS Anchorage entered an extensive overhaul at Southwest Marine Shipyard, San Pedro, California which lasted through November. This overhaul refitted USS Anchorage to accommodate LCACâs (Landing Craft, Air Cushion) and two Phalanx Close-In Weapons Systems were added. On December 15 CDR Gregory C. Butler relieved CDR Michael C. Wein as Commanding Officer.\n\n1989\n\nDEPLOYMENT - JULY to DECEMBER\n\nUSS Anchorage got underway on July 8 for another WESTPAC. Her stops included: Pusan, South Korea July 26-27; Subic Bay, Republic of the Philippines August 7-14; Pattaya, Thailand August 22-26; back in Subic Bay September 11-25; Okinawa, Japan on September 28; Fukuoka, Japan November 1-5; Subic Bay again November 11-20; Hong Kong November 22-27; and Pearl Harbor on December 12. USS Anchorage returned to her home port of Long Beach on December 20.\n\nBACK TO 1965\n\n1990-1991\n\nDEPLOYMENT - DESERT STORM - DECEMBER 1990 to JUNE 1991\n\nDeployment of the 5th MEB (Marine Expeditionary Brigade) to the Arabian Gulf was talked about as early as August 1990 but they had a shipping problem. Only nine ships were available, and the MEB needed 15. On November 9, USS Anchorage was made available but was unable to undergo a pre-deployment work-up. Finally, on December 1, USS Anchorage got underway carrying the 5th MEB along with two LCACâs (Landing Craft, Air Cushion), and would join ships from two other West Coast ports. The 18 ships of Amphibious Group Three formed the largest amphibious group to depart from the West Coast since the Vietnam deployment in 1965. This time in support of Operation Desert Storm, which was the U.S.-led and United Nations-authorized war against Iraq. The coalition force was comprised of 34 nations. After a stop in Pearl Harbor, USS Anchorage entered Subic Bay, Republic of the Philippines December 27.\n\nOn December 29, 1990, CDR Terrance Paul Labrecque relieved CDR Gregory Clinton Butler as Commanding Officer.\n\nAfter Subic Bay, the ship continued to Singapore and transited the Straits of Malacca, before joining the USS Ranger (CV 61) Carrier Battle Group in the North Arabian Sea on January 12, 1991. Amphibious Group Three joined another amphibious group already on station, forming the largest amphibious task force assembled in a combat zone since the Inchon landing during the Korean Conflict in 1950.\n\nAmphibious Group Three consisted of 18 ships; USS Tarawa (LHA 1), USS Durham (LKA 114), USS Mobile (LKA 115), USS Vancouver (LPD 2), USS Ogden (LPD 5), USS Denver (LPD 9), USS Juneau (LPD 10), USS Okinawa (LPH 3), USS Tripoli (LPH 10), USS New Orleans (LPH 11), USS Anchorage (LSD 36), USS Mount Vernon (LSD 39), USS Germantown (LSD 42), USS Fort McHenry (LSD 43), USS Peoria (LST 1183), USS Frederick (LST 1184), USS Cayuga (LST 1186), and USS Barbour County (LST 1195).\n\nAt 0400 on February 4, 1991, ground operations were underway to recapture Kuwait. After a delay due to severe weather and harbor mines, USS Anchorage began offloading at 1400 on February 24, landing the 5th MEB over the beach at Al Mishab, Saudi Arabia. Offloading continued until February 27. USS Anchorage was backloaded in seven hours (fastest of any LSD) and her LCAC carried the most tonnage of any LCAC and had the fewest breakdowns. While serving during Desert Storm, USS Anchorage earned a Navy Unit Commendation for the period August 1, 1990-April 1, 1991.\n\nOver the next few months, USS Anchorage made port visits in Bahrain, and Dubai and Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. USS Anchorage earned a Southwest Asia Service Medal for the period January 12, 1991-May 8. On its way home, while sailing nearby in the Indian Ocean, President George H. W. Bush diverted USS Anchorage to the Bay of Bengal on May 11 to take part in Operation Productive Effort, later changed to Operation Sea Angel by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Colin Powell. Operation Sea Angel was the international humanitarian effort to assist Bangladesh in dealing with the devastation of Cyclone Marian and was one of the largest military disaster relief efforts ever conducted, with the United Kingdom, China, India, Pakistan, and Japan also participating. The U.S. alone had 15 ships and 2500 men. USS Anchorage, as part of Task Group 76.6, along with USS Tarawa (LHA 1), USS Vancouver (LPD 2), USS Juneau (LPD 10), USS Mount Vernon (LSD 39), USS Frederick (LST 1184), USS Barbour County (LST 1195), and USS St. Louis (LKA 116), anchored off Chittagong, Bangladesh, to offload material and serve as forward replenishment stations.\n\nOn May 19, the battalion surgeon for the 2nd Battalion 11th Marines, along with four corpsmen, a civilian nurse with a Marine Reserve unit, and several civilian relief workers, went ashore via LCAC to help. The only permanent medical facility on Kutibdia Island was in terrible condition. No electricity or running water, lack of medical equipment, patients were defecating, vomiting, and urinating on the floor, clouds of flies covered each patient, and ants covered IV bags. After a five-day stay improving conditions and with the increase in local staffing, the team returned to USS Anchorage.\n\nCyclone Marian claimed 138,866 lives, killed more than 1,000,000 livestock, displaced more than 10,000,000 people, ruined more than 74,000 acres of vital crops, and a 20-foot storm surge covered an additional 300,000 acres of farmland with seawater. Operation Sea Angel, with its 3,300 tons of supplies, is credited with having saved as many as 200,000 lives. USS Anchorage alone delivered over 1,500 tons; earning the Meritorious Unit Commendation and the ship's second Humanitarian Service Medal for her efforts.\n\nAfter the allotted two-week period ended, USS Anchorage sailed for home on May 29. She entered the Straits of Malacca on June 1 heading for Subic Bay. After one more stop in Pearl Harbor, USS Anchorage arrived off the coast of Oceanside, just north of San Diego, on June 28. USS Anchorage earned a Joint Meritorious Unit Award for the period May 10-June 13, 1991. Offloading of Marines took place on the 29th at Camp Pendleton and San Diego.\n\nShortly after her return from deployment, the ship entered an extended overhaul period in Long Beach.\n\n1992\n\nHOMEPORT CHANGED BACK TO SAN DIEGO in MAY\n\nUpon completion of the overhaul in Long Beach, USS Anchorage made the short trip back to her original homeport of San Diego. In June, the ship headed north to Alaska for a week-long port visit in Anchorage. On this trip, an anchor removed during overhaul, was transported, then presented to the City of Anchorage on June 16. This anchor is now located at the end of Ship Creek Small Boat Launch in Anchorage. NOTE: The Navy League Anchorage Council #151 started working on an anchor beautification project several years ago. That project evolved into the creation of a Sea Services Memorial, which was dedicated August 16, 2023. This memorial pays tribute to USS Anchorage (LSD 36), USS Anchorage (LPD 23), US Coast Guard District 17 & Sector Western Alaska, and Navy Operating Base Dutch Harbor & Bell. The ship took part in Summer Solstice ceremonies on June 21.\n\nâThe trip to Alaska was the first long haul after months of dry dock and removing the anchor. I remember the Captain playing the song âNorth to Alaskaâ on the intercom as we were leaving. They had this program called adopt a sailor where families in Alaska would take one of us into their home for the duration of our liberty. I donât know how many participated, but I did, and it was fun.â BMSN Carl Spell (3/92-5/95)\n\nAfter her return and before the summer was over, USS Anchorage departed for the ever-popular day-long Tiger Cruise out of San Diego. Tiger Cruises provide an opportunity for family and friends of the crew to experience what Navy Sailors do on a day-to-day basis. On September 11, CDR Thomas J. Brown relieved CDR Terrance P. Labrecque as Commanding Officer. Later in the year, the ship made a port visit to Catalina Island, which is located just 29 miles off the coast of Southern California.\n\n1993\n\nFor most of the year USS Anchorage was moored at Naval Station San Diego or was underway performing sea trials in preparation for the shipâs deployment in January 1994. USS Anchorage earned a Navy âEâ Ribbon for the period January 1-December 31. Can you add anything to this year?\n\n1994\n\nDEPLOYMENT - JANUARY to JULY\n\nEQUATOR CROSSING *canceled due to severe weather\n\nUSS Anchorage was deployed on January 21 with Marines from Golf Battery, 2nd Battalion, 11th Marine Regiment and 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit / Special Operations Capable (11th MEUSOC).\n\nThe ship would head directly to Singapore, going through one of those 'memorable' storms while enroute. No equator crossing ceremony was held because of the severe weather. After Singapore, as part of Peleliu Amphibious Ready Group, the ship, along with USS Peleliu (LHA 5), USS Duluth (LPD 6), and USS Frederick (LST 1184), would spend time off the coast of Somalia to serve in Operation Continue Hope. Operation Continue Hope provided support of a United Nations Operation to establish a secure environment for humanitarian relief by providing personnel, communications, intelligence support, a quick reaction force, and other elements as required. The ship spent several days docked in Mogadishu and visited Mombasa, Somalia several times. CDR Paul Christopher Cassani relieved CDR Thomas Joseph Brown Jr. as Commanding Officer on March 24 while in Mombasa.\n\n\"Our first Captain, CDR Brown, was very strict with all hands. He refused to run our A/C; the troops below were suffering greatly, especially being on the equator in the summer. The 03 deck and above had the A/C running. The day CDR Cassani took over, he had our A/C turned on, which allowed the Marines to change to our summer sexy UDT shorts and t- shirt.â LCpl Daniel Montague USMC G 2/11 (7/93-7/94)\n\nThe Marines assigned to USS Anchorage took part in the amphibious withdrawal of US forces from Mogadishu on March 25. On April 12, USS Anchorage assisted in the evacuation of 142 U.S. Citizens from Rwanda during the Operation Distant Runner, evacuating 142 U.S. citizens from Rwanda. After operations off the coast of Africa, USS Anchorage departed for Perth, Australia. After several days in Perth, the ship would continue to Hawaii.\n\nWhile docked at Pearl, our aft was towards the Arizona Memorial. I was standing around when I heard a whistle. I looked over and saw a Japanese sub passing by with their crew rendering honors to the Arizona.â LCpl Daniel Montague USMC G 2/11 (7/93-7/94)\n\nThe ship earned a Meritorious Unit Commendation and an Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for the period March 2-June 3. USS Anchorage would arrive back in San Diego July 20. The ship earned a Navy âEâ Ribbon for the period January 1-December 31.\n\nBACK TO 1965\n\n1995-1996\n\nDEPLOYMENT - NOVEMBER 1995 to MAY 1996\n\nUSS Anchorage departed for another WESTPAC November 13, 1995. In December, the ship stopped in Okinawa, Japan; Singapore; and Jebel Ali, United Arab Emirates. USS Anchorage earned a Secretary of the Navy Letter of Commendation for the period January 27-October 6 and a Navy âEâ Ribbon for the period January 1-December 31, 1995.\n\nOn January 22, 1996, CDR John Alexander Read relieved CDR Paul Christopher Cassani as Commanding Officer. Early in the year, USS Anchorage was still operating in the Arabian Gulf in support of Operation Southern Watch enforcing United Nations sanctions against Iraq in conjunction with the USS Nimitz Battle Group. She had stops in Kuwait, and Bahrain in February. In March she was in Dubai, United Arab Emirates and Muscat, Oman. USS Anchorage earned an Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for the period December 23, 1995-March 28, 1996. In April she stopped in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Manila, Republic of the Philippines; and Hong Kong, then Pearl Harbor in May, before arriving in California May 13.\n\nFollowing completion of her deployment, USS Anchorage received numerous systems upgrades and modifications in San Diego while dry docked at NASSCO (National Steel and Shipbuilding Company) for planned maintenance availability. While at NASSCO, the ship had a mooring line break.\n\nâThere was a higher tide than what was on the tide table causing one of the mooring lines to breakâ BMSN Michael Royer (2/94-3/97)\n\nâWe had high winds and a super tide. The BM3 was amazingâ FC2 Jason Velasquez (11/93-7/98)\n\nâWe broke a few lines up forward, the ship swung into a USNS shipâs bow and back towards the shore. Everyone was worried that the screws were bent.â BM3 Lenny Schoenhofen (12/93-1/99)\n\nâI remember everyone living on the ship had to run to the forecastle to work the mooring lines.â BMSN Roy V Feeley (2/94-9/96)\n\nUSS Anchorage earned a Navy âEâ Ribbon for the period January 1-December 31, 1996.\n\n1997\n\nUSS Anchorage headed to the Pacific Northwest and took part in operations with the Canadian Navy and then continued to Portland for the Rose Festival Fleet Week ceremonies in early June. On August 22, CDR Ronald Louis Thomas relieved CDR John Alexander Read as CDR Officer.\n\nIn December, history was made when the first female to join the crew of USS Anchorage, reported onboard to serve as shipâs Navigator. Her name, LT Tracy Clark. To provide some background; a pilot program for assigning women to ships began in 1972, Congress approved women to serve on support and noncombatant ships in 1978, and Congress approved women to serve on combatant ships in 1993. The first women to serve aboard combatant ships received their assignments on March 7, 1994.\n\n\"As the first of (at least a few!) women assigned to the ANCHORAGE, I'd like to believe that integration wasn't a big deal... I was a department head, so had my own stateroom (as did all the department heads). The head across from the 1st LT's stateroom was converted for my use (sorry 1st LT!!!), but other than that there weren't any other modifications made. We did change the watchbill so that I always had an assistant Command Duty Officer (under instruction) with me in port who could do the nightly berthing walkthroughs so that I didn't have to wake up anyone while passing through. I also remember "
