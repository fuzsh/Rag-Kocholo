        "text": "Solar PV Analysis of Cleveland\n\nList of Solar PV Installers for Cleveland, United States\n\nIn Cleveland, Ohio, United States (latitude: 41.49932, longitude: -81.6943605), the potential for solar power generation is quite promising due to its geographical location within the Northern Temperate Zone. The average daily energy production per kW of installed solar capacity varies by season, with 6 kWh/day in Summer, 3.29 kWh/day in Autumn, 1.79 kWh/day in Winter, and 5.40 kWh/day in Spring.\n\nThe highest energy output occurs during the summer months when there are longer daylight hours and more sunshine available for solar panels to harness. Conversely, winter months experience shorter days and less sunlight, resulting in lower energy production levels.\n\nWhile weather conditions such as rain or snow may occasionally impact solar energy generation at this location, it remains a suitable site for year-round solar power production despite these challenges.\n\nTo optimize energy output from a fixed panel installation at this location, it is recommended that panels be tilted at an angle of 35 degrees facing southward. This orientation will help maximize exposure to sunlight throughout the year in Cleveland.\n\nIt's important to note that local factors such as topography and environmental conditions should also be considered when planning a solar installation in Cleveland. For instance, if the area is prone to heavy snowfall during winter months, ensuring proper panel maintenance and snow removal can help maintain optimal energy production levels.\n\nOverall, Cleveland's latitude and longitude coordinates make it a viable location for generating solar power throughout the year with appropriate system design and maintenance practices in place to address any potential challenges posed by local environmental factors.\n\nNote: The Northern Temperate Zone extends from 35° latitude North up to 66.5° latitude.\n\nSo far, we have conducted calculations to evaluate the solar photovoltaic (PV) potential in 1358 locations across the United States. This analysis provides insights into each city/location's potential for harnessing solar energy through PV installations.\n\nLink: Solar PV potential in the United States by location\n\nSolar output per kW of installed solar PV by season in Cleveland\n\nSeasonal solar PV output for Latitude: 41.49932, Longitude: -81.6943605 (Cleveland, United States), based on our analysis of 8760 hourly intervals of solar and meteorological data (one whole year) retrieved for that set of coordinates/location from NASA POWER (The Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resources) API:\n\n&nbsp\n\nIdeally tilt fixed solar panels 35° South in Cleveland, United States\n\nTo maximize your solar PV system's energy output in Cleveland, United States (Lat/Long 41.49932, -81.6943605) throughout the year, you should tilt your panels at an angle of 35° South for fixed panel installations.\n\nAs the Earth revolves around the Sun each year, the maximum angle of elevation of the Sun varies by +/- 23.45 degrees from its equinox elevation angle for a particular latitude. Finding the exact optimal angle to maximise solar PV production throughout the year can be challenging, but with careful consideration of historical solar energy and meteorological data for a certain location, it can be done precisely.\n\nWe use our own calculation, which incorporates NASA solar and meteorological data for the exact Lat/Long coordinates, to determine the ideal tilt angle of a solar panel that will yield maximum annual solar output. We calculate the optimal angle for each day of the year, taking into account its contribution to the yearly total PV potential at that specific location.\n\nAt Latitude: 41.49932, Longitude: -81.6943605, the ideal angle to tilt panels is 35° South\n\nSeasonally adjusted solar panel tilt angles for Cleveland, United States\n\nIf you can adjust the tilt angle of your solar PV panels, please refer to the seasonal tilt angles below for optimal solar energy production in Cleveland, United States. As mentioned earlier, for fixed-panel solar PV installations, it is optimal to maintain a 35° South tilt angle throughout the year.\n\nOverall Best Summer Angle Overall Best Autumn Angle Overall Best Winter Angle Overall Best Spring Angle 25° South in Summer 45° South in Autumn 56° South in Winter 34° South in Spring\n\nAssuming you can modify the tilt angle of your solar PV panels throughout the year, you can optimize your solar generation in Cleveland, United States as follows: In Summer, set the angle of your panels to 25° facing South. In Autumn, tilt panels to 45° facing South for maximum generation. During Winter, adjust your solar panels to a 56° angle towards the South for optimal energy production. Lastly, in Spring, position your panels at a 34° angle facing South to capture the most solar energy in Cleveland, United States.\n\nOur recommendations take into account more than just latitude and Earth's position in its elliptical orbit around the Sun. We also incorporate historical solar and meteorological data from NASA's Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resources (POWER) API to assign a weight to each ideal angle for each day based on its historical contribution to overall solar PV potential during a specific season.\n\nThis approach allows us to provide much more accurate recommendations than relying solely on latitude, as it considers unique weather conditions in different locations sharing the same latitude worldwide.\n\nCalculate solar panel row spacing in Cleveland, United States\n\nWe've added a feature to calculate minimum solar panel row spacing by location. Enter your panel size and orientation below to get the minimum spacing in Cleveland, United States.\n\nOur calculation method\n\nSolar Position:\n\nWe determine the Sun's position on the Winter solstice using the location's latitude and solar declination.\n\nShadow Projection:\n\nWe calculate the shadow length cast by panels using trigonometry, considering panel tilt and the Sun's elevation angle.\n\nMinimum Spacing:\n\nWe add the shadow length to the horizontal space occupied by tilted panels.\n\nThis approach ensures maximum space efficiency while avoiding shading during critical times, as the Winter solstice represents the worst-case scenario for shadow length.\n\nPlease enter information above to calculate panel spacing.\n\nTopography for solar PV around Cleveland, United States\n\nThe topography around Cleveland is generally flat, with some rolling hills. Areas near Lake Erie and the Cuyahoga River are relatively flat, making them ideal locations for large-scale solar PV installations. Additionally, areas along major highways such as Interstate 90 and Interstate 71 have plenty of open space that could be used for large-scale solar projects.\n\nUnited States solar PV Stats as a country\n\nUnited States ranks 2nd in the world for cumulative solar PV capacity, with 95,209 total MW's of solar PV installed. This means that 3.40% of United States's total energy as a country comes from solar PV (that's 26th in the world). Each year United States is generating 289 Watts from solar PV per capita (United States ranks 15th in the world for solar PV Watts generated per capita). [source]\n\nAre there incentives for businesses to install solar in United States?\n\nYes, there are several incentives for businesses wanting to install solar energy in the United States. These include federal tax credits, state and local rebates, net metering policies, and renewable energy certificates (RECs). Additionally, many states have enacted legislation that requires utilities to purchase a certain amount of electricity from renewable sources such as solar.\n\nDo you have more up to date information than this on incentives towards solar PV projects in United States?
