        "text": "Effect of Direct Glare on Orbicularis Oculi and Trapezius During Computer Reading.\n\nPubMed\n\nMork, Randi; Bruenech, Jan Richard; Thorud, Hanne Mari SchiÃ¸tz\n\n2016-07-01\n\nUnfavorable visual conditions during computer work may affect development of both eyestrain and musculoskeletal pain in the neck and shoulder area. The aim of the study was to investigate how direct glare affects symptom development, muscle activity, and muscle blood flow in m. orbicularis oculi and m. trapezius during reading on a computer screen. Fifteen healthy young adults with normal binocular vision read text on a computer screen at an optimized computer workplace, 30 minutes with glare exposure and 30 minutes with appropriate lighting. Postural angles were continuously registered. Development of eye symptoms and musculoskeletal pain in the neck and shoulder area were recorded using VAS scales. Muscle activity and muscle blood flow were measured continuously using electromyography and photoplethysmography, respectively. Glare exposure resulted in significantly more pronounced eye pain, increased orbicularis muscle activity, and increased trapezius blood flow compared to reading with appropriate lighting. There were no significant differences in posture between the two light conditions. There were also significant associations between orbicularis oculi activity and both trapezius blood flow and neck pain during both conditions. Results from the current study show that direct glare conditions cause increased eyestrain and orbicularis oculi contraction during reading on a computer screen. This study also indicates that exposure to direct glare affects the trapezius muscle, possibly by an interaction between the visual system, sympathetic nervous system, and head-stabilizing muscles. In addition, there were associations between the use of orbicularis oculi, trapezius blood flow, and development of neck pain independent of the lighting.\n\nTrigeminal Proprioception Evoked by Strong Stretching of the Mechanoreceptors in MÃ¼ller's Muscle Induces Reflex Contraction of the Orbital Orbicularis Oculi Slow-Twitch Muscle Fibers.\n\nPubMed\n\nMatsuo, Kiyoshi; Ban, Ryokuya; Ban, Midori; Yuzuriha, Shunsuke\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe mixed orbicularis oculi muscle lacks an intramuscular proprioceptive system such as muscle spindles, to induce reflex contraction of its slow-twitch fibers. We evaluated whether the mechanoreceptors in MÃ¼ller's muscle function as extrinsic mechanoreceptors to induce reflex contraction of the slow-twitch fibers of the orbicularis oculi in addition to those of the levator and frontalis muscles. We evaluated in patients with aponeurosis-disinserted blepharoptosis whether strong stretching of the mechanoreceptors in MÃ¼ller's muscle from upgaze with unilateral lid load induced reflex contraction of the orbicularis oculi slow-twitch fibers and whether anesthesia of MÃ¼ller's muscle precluded the contraction. We compared the electromyographic responses of the bilateral orbicularis oculi muscles to unilateral intraoperative direct stimulation of the trigeminal proprioceptive nerve with those to unilateral transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the supraorbital nerve. Upgaze with a unilateral 3-g lid load induced reflex contraction of the bilateral orbicularis oculi muscles with ipsilateral dominance. Anesthesia of MÃ¼ller's muscle precluded the reflex contraction. The orbicularis oculi reflex evoked by stimulation of the trigeminal proprioceptive nerve differed from that by electrical stimulation of the supraorbital nerve in terms of the intensity of current required to induce the reflex, the absence of R1, and duration. The mechanoreceptors in MÃ¼ller's muscle functions as an extramuscular proprioceptive system to induce reflex contraction of the orbital orbicularis oculi slow-twitch fibers. Whereas reflex contraction of the pretarsal orbicularis fast-twitch fibers functions in spontaneous or reflex blinking, that of the orbital orbicularis oculi slow-twitch fibers may factor in grimacing and blepharospasm.\n\nTrigeminal Proprioception Evoked by Strong Stretching of the Mechanoreceptors in MÃ¼ller's Muscle Induces Reflex Contraction of the Orbital Orbicularis Oculi Slow-Twitch Muscle Fibers\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBan, Ryokuya; Ban, Midori; Yuzuriha, Shunsuke\n\n2014-01-01\n\nObjective: The mixed orbicularis oculi muscle lacks an intramuscular proprioceptive system such as muscle spindles, to induce reflex contraction of its slow-twitch fibers.

A retrospective non-consecutive small case-series of patients undergoing lower eyelid blepharoplasty is described. In a nutshell, during this procedure a skin flap was fashioned (caudal to the sub-ciliary pre-tarsal excess of skin to be excised), some pre-septal orbicularis oculi muscle fibers were excised (in regard of the skin flap), muscle and then skin were redraped, separately. In addition to these surgical steps conducted on each patient, when required, orbital fat prolapse was reduced, orbital retaining ligament was detached, and/or a canthopexie/plasty was performed. Assessment of surgical outcome was made by providing, for comparison, pictures taken before and after the procedure. No major intra- or postoperative complications were recorded and overall postoperative outcome was judged satisfactory by both surgeons and patients. In contrast to a conventional skin-muscle lower blepharoplasty approach where, in a block, pre-tarsal skin and muscle are excised and then pre-septal skin and muscle are redraped, the technique described in the present paper allows us to excise different amounts of skin and orbicularis muscle and to redrape them separately. Among several potential advantages, this approach preserves pre-tarsal orbicularis muscle function, allows us to apply more tension on the redraped muscle and less on the redraped skin, and avoids redraping of a relatively thick per-septal orbicularis oculi muscle over the tarsus (like it is in the case of a conventional skin-muscle technique).

However, its association with clinical severity was scarcely studied. We reviewed medical records and retrospectively enrolled 121 generalized MG patients. Sensitivity of different muscles to RNS and clinical scoring systems was evaluated. RNS testing revealed facial muscles have the highest positive rate, followed by proximal muscles and distal muscles, with the palpebral portion of the orbicularis oculi muscle most sensitive. Amplitude decrement of compound muscle action potential (CMAP) in the palpebral portion of the orbicularis oculi muscle is related to quantitative myasthenia gravis (QMG) scores, MG-specific manual muscle testing (MMT) scores and myasthenia gravis-related activities of daily living (MG-ADL) scores. We suggest that RNS testing of the palpebral portion of the orbicularis oculi muscle is a potential assessment indicator in patients with generalized MG. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We hypothesize that strong stretching of these mechanoreceptors increases reflex contraction of the orbicularis oculi slow-twitch muscle fibers, resulting in blepharospasm. We examined a 71-year-old man with right blepharospasm and bilateral aponeurosis-disinserted blepharoptosis to determine whether the patient's blepharospasm was worsened by increased trigeminal proprioceptive evocation via stretching of the mechanoreceptors in MÃ¼ller's muscle owing to a 60Â° upward gaze and serrated eyelid closure, and whether local anesthesia of the mechanoreceptors via lidocaine administration to the upper fornix as well as surgical disinsertion of MÃ¼ller's muscle from the tarsus and fixation of the disinserted aponeurosis to the tarsus decreased trigeminal proprioceptive evocation and improved patient's blepharospasm. Before pharmacological desensitization, 60Â° upward gaze and serrated eyelid closure exacerbated the patient's blepharospasm. In contrast, these maneuvers did not worsen his blepharospasm following lidocaine administration. One year after surgical desensitization, the blepharospasm had disappeared and a 60Â° upward gaze did not induce blepharospasm. Strong stretching of the mechanoreceptors in MÃ¼ller's muscle appeared to increase reflex contraction of the orbicularis oculi slow-twitch muscle fibers, resulting in blepharospasm. In addition to botulinum neurotoxin injections into the involuntarily contracted orbicularis oculi muscle and myectomy, surgical desensitization of the mechanoreceptors in MÃ¼ller's muscle may represent an additional procedure to reduce blepharospasm.\n\nDesensitization of the Mechanoreceptors in MÃ¼ller's Muscle Reduces the Increased Reflex Contraction of the Orbicularis Oculi Slow-Twitch Fibers in Blepharospasm\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBan, Ryokuya; Ban, Midori\n\n2014-01-01\n\nObjective: Although the mixed orbicularis oculi muscle lacks the muscle spindles required to induce reflex contraction of its slow-twitch fibers, the mechanoreceptors in MÃ¼ller's muscle function as extrinsic mechanoreceptors to induce reflex contraction.

Facial rehabilitation via closed-loop pacing represents a potential but as yet theoretical approach to reanimation. A first critical step toward closed-loop facial pacing in cases of unilateral paralysis is the detection of healthy movements to use as a trigger to prosthetically elicit automatic artificial movements on the contralateral side of the face. To test and to maximize the performance of an electromyography (EMG)-based blink detection system for applications in closed-loop facial pacing. Blinking was detected across the periocular region by means of multichannel surface EMG at an academic neuroengineering and medical robotics laboratory among 15 healthy volunteers. Real-time blink detection was accomplished by mapping the surface of the orbicularis oculi muscle on one side of the face with a multichannel surface EMG. The biosignal from each channel was independently processed; custom software registered a blink when an amplitude-based or slope-based suprathreshold activity was detected. The experiments were performed when participants were relaxed and during the production of particular orofacial movements. An F1 score metric was used to analyze software performance in detecting blinks. The maximal software performance was achieved when a blink was recorded from the superomedial orbit quadrant. At this recording location, the median F1 scores were 0.89 during spontaneous blinking, 0.82 when chewing gum, 0.80 when raising the eyebrows, and 0.70 when smiling. The overall performance of blink detection was significantly better at the superomedial quadrant (F1 score, 0.75) than at the traditionally used inferolateral quadrant (F1 score, 0.40) (Pâ<â.05). Electromyographic recording represents an accurate tool to detect spontaneous blinks as part of closed-loop facial pacing systems. The early detection of blink activity may allow real\n\nMulti-channel orbicularis oculi stimulation to restore eye-blink function in facial paralysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nSomia, N N; Zonnevijlle, E D; Stremel, R W; Maldonado, C; Gossman, M D; Barker, J H\n\n2001-01-01\n\nFacial paralysis due to facial nerve injury results in the loss of function of the muscles of the hemiface. The most serious complication in extreme cases is the loss of vision. In this study, we compared the effectiveness of single- and multiple-channel electrical stimulation to restore a complete and cosmetically acceptable eye blink. We established bilateral orbicularis oculi muscle (OOM) paralysis in eight dogs; the OOM of one side was directly stimulated using single-channel electrical stimulation and the opposite side was stimulated using multi-channel electrical stimulation. The changes in the palpebral fissure and complete palpebral closure were measured. The difference in current intensities between the multi-channel and single-channel simulation groups was significant, while only multi-channel stimulation produced complete eyelid closure. The latest electronic stimulation circuitry with high-quality implantable electrodes will make it possible to regulate precisely OOM contractions and thus generate complete and cosmetically acceptable eye-blink motion in patients with facial paralysis.

The in vivo part of the IAFNS was implanted into 12 rabbits that were facially paralyzed on the right side of the face to restore the function of the orbicularis oculi muscle, which was indicated by closure of the paralyzed eye when the contralateral side was closed. Wireless communication links were established between the in vivo part (the processing chip and microelectrode) and the external part (System Controller program) of the system, which were used to set the working parameters and indicate the working state of the processing chip and microelectrode implanted in the body. A disturbance field strength test of the IAFNS processing chip was performed in a magnetic field dark room to test its electromagnetic radiation safety. Test distances investigated were 0, 1, 3 and 10 m, and levels of radiation intensity were evaluated in the horizontal and vertical planes. Anti-interference experiments were performed to test the stability of the processing chip under the interference of electromagnetic radiation. The fully implanted IAFNS was run for 5 h per day for 30 consecutive days to evaluate the accuracy and precision as well as the long-term stability and effectiveness of wireless communication. The stimulus intensity (range, 0â8 mA) was set every 3 days to confirm the minimum stimulation intensity which could indicate the movement of the paralyzed side was set. Effective stimulation rate was also tested by comparing the number of eye-close movements on both sides. The results of the present study indicated that the IAFNS could rebuild the reflex arc, inducing the experimental rabbits to close the eye of the paralyzed side. The System Controller program was able to reflect the in vivo part of the artificial facial nerve system in real-time and adjust the working pattern, stimulation intensity and frequency, range of wave\n\nThe suborbicularis oculi fat (SOOF) and the fascial planes: has everything already been explained?\n\nPubMed\n\nAndretto Amodeo, Chiara; Casasco, Andrea; Icaro Cornaglia, Antonia; Kang, Robert; Keller, Gregory S\n\n2014-01-01\n\nDuring anatomic and surgical dissections, a connection was seen between the superficial layer of the deep temporal fascia and the prezygomatic area. These findings were in contrast to previous evaluations. This study defines this connection, which is important to understand from both surgical and anatomic standpoints. To define the connection between the superficial layer of the deep temporal fascia and the prezygomatic area and demonstrate the presence of a deep fascial layer in the midface. Anatomical study performed at the Laboratoire d'Anatomie de la FacultÃ© de MÃ©decine de Nice, Sophia Antipolis, France; at the Centre du Don des Corps de l'UniversitÃ© Paris Descartes, Paris, France; and at the Department of Experimental Medicine, Histology, and Embryology Unit of the University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy. Twenty-four hemifaces of 14 white cadavers were dissected to define the relationship between deep temporal fascia and the midface. Four biopsy samples were harvested for histologic analysis. Dissection of 24 hemifaces from the fresh cadavers revealed the following findings. There is a connection of the deep fascia of the temple (superficial layer of deep temporal fascia) to the midface that divides the fat deep to the orbicularis muscle into 2 layers. One layer of fat is the so-called suborbicularis oculi fat (SOOF), which is superficial to the deep fascia, and the other layer of fat (preperiosteal) is deep to the deep fascia and adherent to malar bone. These findings are in contrast to previous anatomical findings. RESULTS In 12 hemifaces, the superficial layer of the deep temporal fascia directly reached the prezygomatic area as a continuous fascial layer. In 16 hemifaces, the superficial sheet of the deep temporal fascia inserted at the level of the zygomatic and lateral orbital rim and continued as a deep fascial layer over the prezygomatic area. In all specimens, a deep fascial layer was present in the prezygomatic-infraorbital area. This deep fascial layer\n\nEye-related pain induced by visually demanding computer work.\n\nPubMed\n\nThorud, Hanne-Mari SchiÃ¸tz; Helland, Magne; AarÃ¥s, Arne; Kvikstad, Tor Martin; Lindberg, Lars GÃ¶ran; Horgen, Gunnar\n\n2012-04-01\n\nEye strain during visually demanding computer work may include glare and increased squinting. The latter may be related to elevated tension in the orbicularis oculi muscle and development of muscle pain. The aim of the study was to investigate the development of discomfort symptoms in relation to muscle activity and muscle blood flow in the orbicularis oculi muscle during computer work with visual strain. A group of healthy young adults with normal vision was randomly selected. Eye-related symptoms were recorded during a 2-h working session on a laptop. The participants were exposed to visual stressors such as glare and small font. Muscle load and blood flow were measured by electromyography and photoplethysmography, respectively. During 2 h of visually demanding computer work, there was a significant increase in the following symptoms: eye-related pain and tiredness, blurred vision, itchiness, gritty eyes, photophobia, dry eyes, and tearing eyes. Muscle load in orbicularis oculi was significantly increased above baseline and stable at 1 to 1.5% maximal voluntary contraction during the working sessions. Orbicularis oculi muscle blood flow increased significantly during the first part of the working sessions before returning to baseline. There were significant positive correlations between eye-related tiredness and orbicularis oculi muscle load and eye-related pain and muscle blood flow. Subjects who developed eye-related pain showed elevated orbicularis oculi muscle blood flow during computer work, but no differences in muscle load, compared with subjects with minimal pain symptoms. Eyestrain during visually demanding computer work is related to the orbicularis oculi muscle. Muscle pain development during demanding, low-force exercise is associated with increased muscle blood flow, possible secondary to different muscle activity pattern, and/or increased mental stress level in subjects experiencing pain compared with subjects with minimal pain.\n\nLong-term effect of prednisolone on functional blink recovery after transient peripheral facial motor paralysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nVanderWerf, Frans; Reits, Dik; Metselaar, Mick; De Zeeuw, Chris I\n\n2012-03-01\n\nTo determine the functional recovery in patients with severe transient peripheral facial motor paralysis (Bell palsy). Prospective controlled trial. Academic medical center. Blink recovery was studied in 2 groups of severely affected Bell palsy patients during a follow-up period of 84 weeks. The patients in one group received prednisolone within the first week after the onset of symptoms. No medication was given to the other group. A control group of healthy subjects was also included. Simultaneous orbicularis oculi muscle activity and eyelid kinematics were recorded by surface electromyographic (EMG) recording and eyelid search coils, respectively. At the beginning of the paralysis, very little integrated orbicularis oculi muscle activity and eyelid movement was measured at the palsied side of the face. Thirteen weeks later, the integrated orbicularis oculi EMG and functional blink recovery gradually improved until 39 weeks. Beyond, only the integrated orbicularis oculi EMG slightly increased. At 84 weeks, the integrated orbicularis oculi EMG was significantly larger in the prednisolone group compared with the control group. The integrated EMG of the nonmedicated group recovered to normal values. Curiously enough, the functional blink recovery at the palsied side remained reduced to 64% compared with the healthy controls in the prednisolone-treated group and to 36% in the nonmedicated group. The authors demonstrate that prednisolone significantly increased the orbicularis oculi muscle activity and significantly improved functional blink recovery in severely affected Bell palsy patients. However, the increase of muscle activity was insufficient to restore functional blinking to normal values.\n\nNeural Correlates of Facial Mimicry: Simultaneous Measurements of EMG and BOLD Responses during Perception of Dynamic Compared to Static Facial Expressions\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRymarczyk, Krystyna; Å»urawski, Åukasz; Jankowiak-Siuda, Kamila; Szatkowska, Iwona\n\n2018-01-01\n\nFacial mimicry (FM) is an automatic response to imitate the facial expressions of others. However, neural correlates of the phenomenon are as yet not well established. We investigated this issue using simultaneously recorded EMG and BOLD signals during perception of dynamic and static emotional facial expressions of happiness and anger. During display presentations, BOLD signals and zygomaticus major (ZM), corrugator supercilii (CS) and orbicularis oculi (OO) EMG responses were recorded simultaneously from 46 healthy individuals. Subjects reacted spontaneously to happy facial expressions with increased EMG activity in ZM and OO muscles and decreased CS activity, which was interpreted as FM. Facial muscle responses correlated with BOLD activity in regions associated with motor simulation of facial expressions [i.e., inferior frontal gyrus, a classical Mirror Neuron System (MNS)]. Further, we also found correlations for regions associated with emotional processing (i.e., insula, part of the extended MNS). It is concluded that FM involves both motor and emotional brain structures, especially during perception of natural emotional expressions.

Pecten oculi formations consisted of 18 to 21 pleats and their shape looked like a snail. Apical length of the pleats forming pecten oculi were averagely measured as 5.77âÂ±â0.56 mm, retina-dependent base length was 9.01âÂ±â1.35 mm and height was measured as 6.4âÂ±â0.62 mm. In pecten oculi formations which extend up to 1/3 of the bulbus oculi, two different vascular formations were determined according to thickness of the vessel diameter. Among these, vessels with larger diameters which are less than the others in count were classified as afferent and efferent vessels, smaller vessels which are greater in size were classified as capillaries. Furthermore, the granules which were observed intensely in apical side of the pleats of pecten oculi were observed to distribute randomly along the plica.

Pectinate artery resistive index (RI) and pulsatility index (PI) were investigated using ocular Doppler ultrasonography. The mean RI and PI values across all eyes were 0.44Â±0.10 and 0.62Â±0.20 respectively. Low RI and PI values found in the harpy eagleÂ´s pectinis oculi artery compared with the American pekin ducks one and other tissue suggest indeed a high metabolic activity in pecten oculi and corroborates the hypothesis of a nutritional function and/or intraocular pressure regulation.

Central peaks were found in the cross-correlograms of EMG activity recorded from the orbicularis oculi and zygomaticus major during smiling, the corrugator and depressor anguli oris during the sad look and the frontalis and mentalis during the horror look. The size of the central peak was significantly greater between the orbicularis oculi and zygomaticus major during smiling. It is concluded that co-contraction of facial muscles during some facial expressions are accompanied by the presence of common synaptic drive to the motoneurones supplying the muscles involved. Central peaks were found in the cross-correlograms of EMG activity recorded from the frontalis and depressor anguli oris during a contrived expression. However, no central peaks were found in the cross-correlograms of EMG activity recorded from the frontalis and orbicularis oculi or from the frontalis and zygomaticus major during the other two contrived expressions. It is concluded that a common synaptic drive is not present between all possible facial muscle pairs and suggests a functional role for the synergy. The origin of the common drive is discussed. It is concluded that activity in branches of common stem last-order presynaptic input fibres to motoneurones innervating the different facial muscles and presynaptic synchronization of input activity to the different motoneurone pools is involved. The former probably contributes more to the drive to the orbicularis oculi and zygomaticus major during smiling, while the latter is probably more prevalent in the corrugator and depressor anguli oris during the sad look, the frontalis and mentalis during the horror look and the frontalis and depressor anguli oris during one of the contrived expressions.

Patients undergoing facial nerve reconstruction often complain about disturbing abnormal synkinetic movements of the facial muscles (mass movements, synkinesis) which are thought to result from misguided collateral branching of regenerating motor axons and reinnervation of inappropriate muscles. Here, we examined whether use of an aorta Y-tube conduit during reconstructive surgery after facial nerve injury reduces synkinesis of orbicularis oris (blink reflex) and vibrissal (whisking) musculature. The abdominal aorta plus its bifurcation was harvested (N = 12) for Y-tube conduits.

Patients undergoing facial nerve reconstruction often complain about disturbing abnormal synkinetic movements of the facial muscles (mass movements, synkinesis) which are thought to result from misguided collateral branching of regenerating motor axons and reinnervation of inappropriate muscles. Here, we examined whether use of an aorta Y-tube conduit during reconstructive surgery after facial nerve injury reduces synkinesis of orbicularis oris (blink reflex) and vibrissal (whisking) musculature. The abdominal aorta plus its bifurcation was harvested (N = 12) for Y-tube conduits. Animal groups comprised intact animals (Group 1), those receiving hypoglossal-facial nerve end-to-end coaptation alone (HFA; Group 2), and those receiving hypoglossal-facial nerve reconstruction using a Y-tube (HFA-Y-tube, Group 3).

In 71 subjects, this study investigated the extent to which grimacing muscles are innervated by the bilateral motor cortices, whether the corticofacial projection to the grimacing muscles affects the facially innervated stapedius muscle tone by measuring static compliance of the tympanic membrane, and whether unilateral tight eyelid closure with contraction of the grimacing muscles changes static compliance. Unilateral tight eyelid closure and its subsequent change in the contralateral vertical medial eyebrow position revealed that motor neurons of the orbicularis oculi and corrugator supercilii muscles were innervated by the bilateral motor cortices with weak-to-strong contralateral dominance. The orbicularis oculi, corrugator supercilii, and stapedius muscles innervated by the bilateral motor cortices had increased muscle hyperactivity, which lowered the vertical medial eyebrow position and decreased the static compliance of the tympanic membrane more than those innervated by the unilateral motor cortex. Unilateral enhanced tight eyelid closure with contraction of the grimacing muscles in certain subjects ipsilaterally decreased the static compliance with increased contraction of the stapedius muscle, which probably occurs to immobilise the tympanic membrane and protect the inner ear from loud sound. Evaluation of unilateral tight eyelid closure and the subsequent change in the contralateral vertical medial eyebrow position as well as a measurement of the static compliance for the stapedius muscle tone has revealed muscle hyperactivity of grimacing muscles.\n\nComparative Allometric Growth of the Mimetic Ephippid Reef Fishes Chaetodipterus faber and Platax orbicularis.\n\nPubMed\n\nBarros, Breno; Sakai, Yoichi; Pereira, Pedro H C; Gasset, Eric; Buchet, Vincent; Maamaatuaiahutapu, Moana; Ready, Jonathan S; Oliveira, Yrlan; Giarrizzo, Tommaso; Vallinoto, Marcelo\n\n2015-01-01\n\nMimesis is a relatively widespread phenomenon among reef fish, but the ontogenetic processes relevant for mimetic associations in fish are still poorly understood. In the present study, the allometric growth of two allopatric leaf-mimetic species of ephippid fishes, Chaetodipterus faber from the Atlantic and Platax orbicularis from the Indo-Pacific, was analyzed using ten morphological variables. The development of fins was considered owing to the importance of these structures for mimetic behaviors during early life stages. Despite the anatomical and behavioral similarities in both juvenile and adult stages, C. faber and P. orbicularis showed distinct patterns of growth. The overall shape of C. faber transforms from a rounded-shape in mimetic juveniles to a lengthened profile in adults, while in P. orbicularis, juveniles present an oblong profile including dorsal and anal fins, with relative fin size diminishing while the overall profile grows rounder in adults. Although the two species are closely-related, the present results suggest that growth patterns in C. faber and P. orbicularis are different, and are probably independent events in ephippids that have resulted from similar selective processes.\n\nThe Boomerang Lift: A Three-Step Compartment-Based Approach to the Youthful Cheek.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchreiber, Jillian E; Terner, Jordan; Stern, Carrie S; Beut, Javier; Jelks, Elizabeth B; Jelks, Glenn W; Tepper, Oren M\n\n2018-04-01\n\nAutologous fat grafting is an important tool for plastic surgeons treating the aging face. Malar augmentation with fat is often targeted to restore the youthful facial contour and provides support to the lower eyelid. The existence of distinct facial fat compartments suggests that a stepwise approach may be appropriate in this regard. The authors describe a three-step approach to malar augmentation using targeted deep malar fat compartmental augmentation, termed the \"boomerang lift.\" Clinical patients undergoing autologous fat grafting for malar augmentation were injected in three distinct deep malar fat compartments: the lateral sub-orbicularis oculi fat, the medial sub-orbicularis oculi fat, and the deep medial cheek (n = 9). Intraoperative three-dimensional images were taken at baseline and following compartmental injections (Canfield VECTRA H1). Images were overlaid between the augmented and baseline captures, and the three-dimensional surface changes were analyzed, which represented the resulting \"augmentation zone.\" Three-dimensional analysis demonstrated a unique pattern for the augmentation zone consistent across patients. The augmentation zone resembled a boomerang, with the short tail supporting the medial lower lid and the long tail extending laterally along the zygomatic arch. The upper border was restricted by the level of the nasojugal interface, and the lower border was defined medially by the nasolabial fold and laterally by the level of the zygomaticocutaneous ligament. Lateral and medial sub-orbicularis oculi fat injections defined the boundaries of the boomerang shape, and injection to the deep medial cheek provided maximum projection. This is the first description of deep malar augmentation zones in clinical patients. Three-dimensional surface imaging was ideal for analyzing the surface change in response to targeted facial fat grafting. The authors' technique resulted in a reproducible surface shape, which they term the boomerang lift.\n\nComparative Allometric Growth of the Mimetic Ephippid Reef Fishes Chaetodipterus faber and Platax orbicularis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBarros, Breno; Sakai, Yoichi; Pereira, Pedro H.

Retrospective, single-center study comparing single-fiber electromyography (SFEMG) in the extensor digitorum communis (EDC) or orbicularis oculi (OO) muscles. Hospital. Four groups of adults treated for spasticity or neurologic bladder hyperactivity (N=55): control group (asymptomatic patients: n=17), fatigue group (unusual fatigue with no weakness: n=15), pseudobotulism group (muscle weakness and/or visual disturbance: n=20), and botulism group (from intensive care unit of the same hospital: n=3). Not applicable. Mean jitter, percentage of pathologic fibers, and percentage of blocked fibers were compared between groups. SFEMG was abnormal for 17.6% of control patients and 75% of patients in the pseudobotulism group. There were no differences between the control and fatigue groups. Mean jitter, percentage of pathologic fibers, and percentage of blocked fibers of the EDC muscle were significantly higher in the pseudobotulism group than in the fatigue and control groups. There were no differences between groups for the OO muscle. The SFEMG results in the botulism group were qualitatively similar to those of the pseudobotulism group. SFEMG of the EDC muscle confirmed diffusion of the toxin into muscles distant from the injection site in the pseudobotulism group. SFEMG in the OO muscle is not useful for the diagnosis of diffusion. No major signs of diffusion of botulinum toxin type A were found away from the injection site in patients with fatigue but no motor weakness. Such fatigue may be related to other mechanisms.

The expanded skin flaps, pedicled with orbicularis oculi muscle, submental artery, the branch of facial artery, superficial temporal artery, interior upper arm artery, had similar texture and color as facial soft tissue. The pedicled expanded flaps have repaired the facial soft tissue defects. Between Jan. 2003 to Dec. 2013, 157 cases with facial soft tissue defects were reconstructed by pedicled expanded flaps. Epidermal necrosis happened at the distal end of 8 expanded flaps, pedicled with interior upper arm artery(4 cases), orbicularis oculi muscle(3 cases) and submental artery(1 case), which healed spontaneously after dressing. All the other flaps survived completely with similar color and inconspicuous scar. 112 cases were followed up for 8 months to 8 years. Satisfactory results were achieved in 75 cases. 37 cases with hypertrophic scar at incisions need secondary operation. Island pedicled expanded flap with similar texture and color as facial soft tissue is suitable for facial soft tissue defects. The facial extra-incision and large dog-ear deformity could be avoided.\n\nMR relaxometry for the facial ageing assessment: the preliminary study of the age dependency in the MR relaxometry parameters within the facial soft tissue.\n\nPubMed\n\nWatanabe, M; Buch, K; Fujita, A; Christiansen, C L; Jara, H; Sakai, O\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTo investigate the location-specific tissue properties and age-related changes of the facial fat and facial muscles using quantitative MRI (qMRI) analysis of longitudinal magnetization (T1) and transverse magnetization (T2) values. 38 subjects (20 males and 18 females, 0.5-87âyears old) were imaged with a mixed turbo-spin echo sequence at 1.5âT. T1 and T2 measurements were obtained within regions of interest in six facial fat regions including the buccal fat and subcutaneous cheek fat, four eyelid fat regions (lateral upper, medial upper, lateral lower and medial lower) and five facial muscles including the orbicularis oculi, orbicularis oris, buccinator, zygomaticus major and masseter muscles bilaterally. Within the zygomaticus major muscle, age-associated T1 decreases in females and T1 increases in males were observed in later life with an increase in T2 values with age. The orbicularis oculi muscles showed lower T1 and higher T2 values compared to the masseter, orbicularis oris and buccinator muscles, which demonstrated small age-related changes. The dramatic age-related changes were also observed in the eyelid fat regions, particularly within the lower eyelid fat; negative correlations with age in T1 values (p<0.0001 for age) and prominent positive correlation in T2 values in male subjects (p<0.0001 for maleÃage). Age-related changes were not observed in T2 values within the subcutaneous cheek fat. This study demonstrates proof of concept using T1 and T2 values to assess age-related changes of the facial soft tissues, demonstrating tissue-specific qMRI measurements and non-uniform ageing patterns within different regions of facial soft tissues.\n\nBotulinum toxin treatment of hemifacial spasm.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nElston, J S\n\n1986-01-01\n\nSix patients with hemifacial spasm were treated with injections of botulinum toxin A into the orbicularis oculi; the abnormal movements around the eye were relieved for an average of 15 weeks.

Fifteen children with neurological disorders and drooling received speech therapy and twice-weekly KT of the orbicularis muscles over a 30-day period. Drooling was assessed by six parameters: impact on the life of the child and caregiver; severity of drooling; frequency of drooling; drooling volume (estimated by number of bibs used); salivary leak; and interlabial gap. Seven markers of oral motor skills were also assessed. KT of the orbicularis oris region reduced the interlabial gap. All oral motor skills and almost all markers of drooling improved after 15Â days of treatment. In this sample of children with neurological disorders, adding KT of the orbicularis oris muscles to speech therapy caused rapid improvement in oral motor skills and drooling.\n\nAn agonistâantagonist cerebellar nuclear system controlling eyelid kinematics during motor learning\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSÃ¡nchez-Campusano, Raudel; Gruart, AgnÃ¨s; FernÃ¡ndez-Mas, Rodrigo; Delgado-GarcÃ­a, JosÃ© M.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe presence of two antagonistic groups of deep cerebellar nuclei neurons has been reported as necessary for a proper dynamic control of learned motor responses. Most models of cerebellar function seem to ignore the biomechanical need for a double activationâdeactivation system controlling eyelid kinematics, since most of them accept that, for closing the eyelid, only the activation of the orbicularis oculi (OO) muscle (via the red nucleus to the facial motor nucleus) is necessary, without a simultaneous deactivation of levator palpebrae motoneurons (via unknown pathways projecting to the perioculomotor area). We have analyzed the kinetic neural commands of two antagonistic types of cerebellar posterior interpositus neuron (IPn) (types A and B), the electromyographic (EMG) activity of the OO muscle, and eyelid kinematic variables in alert behaving cats during classical eyeblink conditioning, using a delay paradigm. We addressed the hypothesis that the interpositus nucleus can be considered an agonistâantagonist system controlling eyelid kinematics during motor learning. To carry out a comparative study of the kineticâkinematic relationships, we applied timing and dispersion pattern analyses. We concluded that, in accordance with a dominant role of cerebellar circuits for the facilitation of flexor responses, type A neurons fire during active eyelid downward displacementsâi.e., during the active contraction of the OO muscle. In contrast, type B neurons present a high tonic rate when the eyelids are wide open, and stop firing during any active downward displacement of the upper eyelid. From a functional point of view, it could be suggested that type B neurons play a facilitative role for the antagonistic action of the levator palpebrae muscle. From an anatomical point of view, the possibility that cerebellar nuclear type B neurons project to the perioculomotor areaâi.e., more or less directly onto levator palpebrae motoneuronsâis highly appealing.

In this work, the extract from specie Phyllanthus orbicularis K was evaluated as a protective agent against the photodamage by UVB, UVA artificial lamps and environmental sunlight exposure. The plasmid DNA solutions were exposed to radiations using the DNA-dosimeter system in presence of plant extract. The DNA repair enzymes, E. coli Formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg) and T4 bacteriophage endonuclease V (T4-endo V), were employed to discriminate oxidized DNA damage and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) respectively. The supercoiled and relaxed forms of DNA were separated through electrophoretic migration in agarose gels. These DNA forms were quantified to determine strands break, representing the types of lesion levels. The results showed that, in presence of P. orbicularis extract, the CPD and oxidative damage were reduced in irradiated DNA samples. The photoprotective effect of extract was more evident for UVB and sunlight radiation than for UVA. This work documents the UV absorbing properties of P. orbicularis aqueous extract and opens up new vistas in its characterization as protective agent against DNA damage induced by environmental sunlight radiation.

We therefore developed an accurate measuring system that we believe is the first system suitable for delay eyeblink conditioning in a monkey species (Macaca mulatta). Monkey eyeblinking was simultaneously monitored by orbicularis oculi electromyographic (OO-EMG) measurements and a high-speed camera-based tracking system built around a 1-kHz CMOS image sensor. A 1-kHz tone was the conditioned stimulus (CS), while an air puff (0.02 MPa) was the unconditioned stimulus. EMG analysis showed that the monkeys exhibited a conditioned response (CR) incidence of more than 60% of trials during the 5-day acquisition phase and an extinguished CR during the 2-day extinction phase. The camera system yielded similar results. Hence, we conclude that both methods are effective in evaluating monkey eyeblink conditioning. This system incorporating two different measuring principles enabled us to elucidate the relationship between the actual presence of eyelid closure and OO-EMG activity. An interesting finding permitted by the new system was that the monkeys frequently exhibited obvious CRs even when they produced visible facial signs of drowsiness or microsleep. Indeed, the probability of observing a CR in a given trial was not influenced by whether the monkeys closed their eyelids just before CS onset, suggesting that this memory could be expressed independently of wakefulness. This work presents a novel system for cognitive assessment in monkeys that will be useful for elucidating the neural mechanisms of implicit learning in nonhuman primates.\n\nEffect of Expiratory Resistive Loading in Expiratory Muscle Strength Training on Orbicularis Oris Muscle Activity\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYanagisawa, Yukio; Matsuo, Yoshimi; Shuntoh, Hisato; Horiuchi, Noriaki\n\n2014-01-01\n\n[Purpose] The purpose of this study was to elucidate the effect of expiratory resistive loading on orbicularis oris muscle activity. [Subjects] Subjects were 23 healthy individuals (11 males, mean age 25.5Â±4.3â years; 12 females, mean age 25.0Â±3.0â years). [Methods] Surface electromyography was performed to measure the activity of the orbicularis oris muscle during maximum lip closure and resistive loading at different expiratory pressures. Measurement was performed at 10%, 30%, 50%, and 100% of maximum expiratory pressure (MEP) for all subjects. The t-test was used to compare muscle activity between maximum lip closure and 100% MEP, and analysis of variance followed by multiple comparisons was used to compare the muscle activities observed at different expiratory pressures. [Results] No significant difference in muscle activity was observed between maximum lip closure and 100% MEP. Analysis of variance with multiple comparisons revealed significant differences among the different expiratory pressures. [Conclusion] Orbicularis oris muscle activity increased with increasing expiratory resistive loading.

We compared the evoked electromyography (EEMG) response of orbicularis oris and gastrocnemius in with and without a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant in a rabbit model of graded facial nerve injury. Differences in EEMG response and inhibition by rocuronium were measured in the orbicularis oris and gastrocnemius muscles 7 to 42 d after different levels of facial nerve crush injuries in adult rabbits. Baseline EEMG of orbicularis oris was significantly smaller than those of the gastrocnemius. Gastrocnemius was more sensitive to rocuronium than the facial muscles (P < 0.05). Baseline EEMG and EEMG amplitude of orbicularis oris in the presence of rocuronium was negatively correlated with the magnitude of facial nerve injury but the sensitivity to rocuronium was not. No significant difference was found in the onset time and the recovery time of rocuronium among gastrocnemius and normal or damaged facial muscles. Muscles innervated by somatic nerves are more sensitive to rocuronium than those innervated by the facial nerve, but while facial nerve injury reduced EEMG responses, the sensitivity to rocuronium is not altered. Partial neuromuscular blockade may be a suitable technique for conducting anesthesia and surgery safely when EEMG monitoring is needed to preserve and protect the facial nerve. Additional caution should be used if there is a risk of preexisting facial nerve injury. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The complexes were synthesized through the corresponding fac-[M(CO)3(H2O)(OO)] (M = Re, (99m)Tc) intermediate aqua complex. In the presence of phosphine, replacement of the H2O molecule of the intermediate complex at room temperature generates the neutral tricarbonyl monophosphine fac-[Re(CO)3(P)(OO)] complex, while under reflux conditions further replacement of the trans to the phosphine carbonyl generates the new stable dicarbonyl bisphosphine complex cis-trans-[Re(CO)2(P)2(OO)]. The Re complexes were fully characterized by elemental analysis, spectroscopic methods, and X-ray crystallography showing a distorted octahedral geometry around Re. Both the monophosphine and the bisphosphine complexes of curcumin show selective binding to Î²-amyloid plaques of Alzheimer's disease. At the (99m)Tc tracer level, the same type of complexes, fac-[(99m)Tc(CO)3(P)(OO)] and cis-trans-[(99m)Tc(CO)2(P)2(OO)], are formed introducing new donor combinations for (99m)Tc(I). Overall, Î²-diketonate and phosphine constitute a versatile ligand combination for Re(I) and (99m)Tc(I), and the successful employment of the multipotent curcumin as Î²-diketone provides a solid example of the pharmacological potential of this system.\n\nTemporary Medial Upper Eyelid Lagophthalmos after External Dacryocystorhinostomy.\n\nPubMed\n\nHaefliger, I O; Meienberg, O; Pimentel de Figueiredo, A R\n\n2016-04-01\n\nBackground. Report of three cases of medial upper eyelid lagophthalmos as complication of external dacryocystorhinostomy. History and Signs. Shortly after dacryocystorhinostomy (skin incision on the side of the nose), three of ten consecutive patients (28âÂ±â4 years; mean Â± standard deviation), presented with an ipsilateral lagophthalmos of 4âÂ±â1âmm in voluntary eyelid closure and 6âÂ±â1âmm in spontaneous blink. The lagophthalmos was due to a selective paresis of the medial part of the orbicularis oculi muscle of the upper eyelid. Patient 1 complained bitterly of dry eye symptoms and of her lagophthalmos. Patient 2 had mild symptoms but became very concerned after peers made her aware of her asymmetric blink. Patient 3 was asymptomatic and did not notice anything particular. Therapy and Outcome. Lagophthalmos resolved spontaneously within three months after surgery, first by improvement of voluntary eyelid closure and then of spontaneous blinking. Conclusions. Temporary lagophthalmos can occur as a complication of external dacryocystorhinostomy, most likely due to damage of the (only recently described) superficial buccal and/or zygomatic branches of the facial nerve that run upward to cross over the medial ligament and innervate the medial part of the orbicularis oculi muscle.

It is important to understand the correlation between the clinical presentation and the individual anatomy to direct an adequate treatment. A review of the literature based on the authors experience combined with anatomical dissections was conducted to reveal the current concepts of the surgical and non-surgical anatomy. The various anatomical structures important for the understanding of the symptoms and the proposed treatment are described in this article. The anatomy of the lower eyelid and the lid-cheek junction has to be understood as a unit. Structures are continuous from the eyelid to the cheek influencing each other during aging. The concept of superficial, i.e. superficial to the orbicularis oculi muscle and deep facial fat compartments, i.e. deep to the orbicularis oculi muscle has to be applied in order to understand the relevant anatomy regarding the ligaments, fat compartments, muscular and tarsal structures and the vascularization. The understanding of the layered arrangement of the lower eyelid and eyelid-cheek junction anatomy enables practitioners to perform safe and effective surgical and non-surgical procedures.

Recent evidence suggested that mimicry may not be only an automatic reaction but could be dependent on many factors, including social context, type of task in which the participant is engaged, or stimulus properties (dynamic vs static presentation). In the present study, we investigated the impact of dynamic facial expression and sex differences on facial mimicry and judgment of emotional intensity. Electromyography recordings were recorded from the corrugator supercilii, zygomaticus major, and orbicularis oculi muscles during passive observation of static and dynamic images of happiness and anger. The ratings of the emotional intensity of facial expressions were also analysed. As predicted, dynamic expressions were rated as more intense than static ones. Compared to static images, dynamic displays of happiness also evoked stronger activity in the zygomaticus major and orbicularis oculi, suggesting that subjects experienced positive emotion. No muscles showed mimicry activity in response to angry faces. Moreover, we found that women exhibited greater zygomaticus major muscle activity in response to dynamic happiness stimuli than static stimuli. Our data support the hypothesis that people mimic positive emotions and confirm the importance of dynamic stimuli in some emotional processing.

A fast beam of CH3OO- or C2H5OO- anions is photodetached to generate neutral radicals that are subsequently dissociated using 248 nm photons. The coincident detection of the photofragment positions and arrival times allows for the determination of mass, translational energy, and angular distributions for both two-body and three-body dissociation events. CH3OO exhibits repulsive O loss resulting in the formation of O(1D) + CH3O with high translational energy release. Minor two-body channels leadingmoreÂ Â» to OH + CH2O and CH3O + O(3P) formation are also detected. In addition, small amounts of H + O(3P) + CH2O are observed and attributed to O loss followed by CH3O dissociation. C2H5OO exhibits more complex dissociation dynamics, in which O loss and OH loss occur in roughly equivalent amounts with O(1D) formed as the dominant O atom electronic state via dissociation on a repulsive surface. Minor two-body channels leading to the formation of O2 + C2H5 and HO2 + C2H4 are also observed and attributed to a ground state dissociation pathway following internal conversion. Additionally, C2H5OO dissociation yields a three-body product channel, CH3 + O(3P) + CH2O, for which the proposed mechanism is repulsive O loss followed by the dissociation of C2H5O over a barrier. These results are compared to a recent study of tert-butyl peroxy (t-BuOO) in which 248 nm excitation results in three-body dissociatio n and ground state two-body dissociation but no O(1D) production.Â«Â less\n\nPhotodissociation dynamics of the simplest alkyl peroxy radicals, CH 3OO and C 2H 5OO, at 248 nm\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSullivan, Erin N.; Nichols, Bethan; Neumark, Daniel M.\n\nThe photodissociation dynamics of the simplest alkyl peroxy radicals, methyl peroxy (CH 3OO) and ethyl peroxy C 2H 5OO , are investigated using fast beam photofragment translational spectroscopy.

R.\n\n2012-06-01\n\nThe femtosecond-laser in situ keratomileusis (fs-LASIK) technique has successfully entered the refractive surgery market to correct ametropia by cutting transparent corneal tissue with ultra-short laser pulses based on photodisruption. The laser pulses in the near infrared range (NIR) generate a laser-induced breakdown (LIOB) in the cornea. By propagating through the eye, a certain amount of the pulse is deposited in the cornea and the remaining energy interacts with the strong absorbing tissue behind. Due to the absorption by the retinal pigment epithelium and the transfer of the thermal energy to surrounding tissue, the transmitted energy can induce damage to the retina. The aim of this project was to find out the threshold influences concerning the tissue and the correlation between the results of the macroscopical appraisal and the fundus oculi pigmentation by simulating the fs-LASIK procedure with two various laser systems in the continuous wave (CW) and fs-regime. Therefore ex-vivo determinations were carried out macroscopically and histopathologically on porcine tissue.\n\nO-O bond formation in ruthenium-catalyzed water oxidation: single-site nucleophilic attack vs. O-O radical coupling.\n\nPubMed\n\nShaffer, David W; Xie, Yan; Concepcion, Javier J\n\n2017-10-16\n\nIn this review we discuss at the mechanistic level the different steps involved in water oxidation catalysis with ruthenium-based molecular catalysts. We have chosen to focus on ruthenium-based catalysts to provide a more coherent discussion and because of the availability of detailed mechanistic studies for these systems but many of the aspects presented in this review are applicable to other systems as well. The water oxidation cycle has been divided in four major steps: water oxidative activation, O-O bond formation, oxidative activation of peroxide intermediates, and O 2 evolution. A significant portion of the review is dedicated to the O-O bond formation step as the key step in water oxidation catalysis. The two main pathways to accomplish this step, single-site water nucleophilic attack and O-O radical coupling, are discussed in detail and compared in terms of their potential use in photoelectrochemical cells for solar fuels generation.\n\nIdentification of proteins involved in desiccation tolerance in the red seaweed Pyropia orbicularis (Rhodophyta, Bangiales).\n\nPubMed\n\nLÃ³pez-Cristoffanini, Camilo; Zapata, Javier; Gaillard, Fanny; Potin, Philippe; Correa, Juan A; Contreras-Porcia, Loretto\n\n2015-12-01\n\nExtreme reduction in cellular water content leads to desiccation, which, if persistent, affects the physiology of organisms, mainly through oxidative stress. Some organisms are highly tolerant to desiccation, including resurrection plants and certain intertidal seaweeds. One such species is Pyropia orbicularis, a rhodophycean that colonizes upper intertidal zones along the Chilean coast. Despite long, daily periods of air exposure due to tides, this alga is highly tolerant to desiccation. The present study examined the proteome of P. orbicularis by 2DE and LC-MS/MS analyses to determine the proteins associated with desiccation tolerance (DT). The results showed that, under natural conditions, there were significant changes in the protein profile during low tide as compared to naturally hydrated plants at high tide. These changes were mainly in newly appeared proteins spots such as chaperones, monodehydroascorbate reductase, and manganese superoxide dismutase, among others. Previously undescribed proteins under desiccation conditions included phycobiliproteins, glyoxalase I, and phosphomannomutase. These changes evidenced that several physiological responses involved in DT are activated during low tide, including decreased photosynthetic activity, increased antioxidant capacity, and the preservation of cell physiology by regulating water content, cell wall structure, and cell volume. Similar responses have been observed in resurrection plants and bryophytes exposed to desiccation. Therefore, the coordinated activation of different desiccation tolerance pathways in P. orbicularis could explain the successful biological performance of this seaweed in the upper intertidal rocky zones.

Studies assessing the changes in stimulus perception and the electromyographic (EMG) activity of the orbicularis oris muscle shortly after conventional complete denture insertion are lacking. The purpose of this clinical study was to evaluate the effect of mouth rehabilitation with removable complete dentures on stimulus perception and the EMG activity of the orbicularis oris muscle. This study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the AraÃ§atuba Dental School (SÃ£o Paulo State University). Fifteen participants who had worn their removable complete dentures for at least 5 years and needed rehabilitation with new prostheses were enrolled in the study. A perception questionnaire was applied, and surface EMG examinations of the orbicularis oris muscle during rest, suction of water with a straw, and pronunciation of the syllables /bah/, /mah/, /pah/, and the word 'Mississippi' were performed before (T0) and 30 (T1) and 100 (T2) days after insertion of the new prostheses. The data were analyzed with the Cochran Q test, McNemar test, 2-way repeated measures ANOVA, and honestly significant difference (HSD) Tukey test (Î±=.05). Significant improvement was reported in the perception questionnaire in terms of the oral discomfort sensation in the T2 period. EMG activity decreased during rest and suction after insertion of the new prostheses. A statistical difference between the upper and lower fascicles of the orbicularis oris muscle was detected, with a decrease of EMG activity between the T0 and T1 periods on the lower fascicle, except for when pronouncing the /pah/ syllable. Mouth rehabilitation with removable complete dentures decreased oral discomfort and, depending on the oral function, decreased or increased EMG activity of the orbicularis oris muscle. In addition, the lower fascicle\n\nPolar-phase indices of perioral muscle reciprocity during syllable production in Parkinson's disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nChu, Shin Ying; Barlow, Steven M; Lee, Jaehoon; Wang, Jingyan\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThis research characterised perioral muscle reciprocity and amplitude ratio in lower lip during bilabial syllable production [pa] at three rates to understand the neuromotor dynamics and scaling of motor speech patterns in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). Electromyographic (EMG) signals of the orbicularis oris superior [OOS], orbicularis oris inferior [OOI] and depressor labii inferioris [DLI] were recorded during syllable production and expressed as polar-phase notations. PD participants exhibited the general features of reciprocity between OOS, OOI and DLI muscles as reflected in the EMG during syllable production. The control group showed significantly higher integrated EMG amplitude ratio in the DLI:OOS muscle pairs than PD participants. No speech rate effects were found in EMG muscle reciprocity and amplitude magnitude across all muscle pairs. Similar patterns of muscle reciprocity in PD and controls suggest that corticomotoneuronal output to the facial nucleus and respective perioral muscles is relatively well-preserved in our cohort of mild idiopathic PD participants. Reduction of EMG amplitude ratio among PD participants is consistent with the putative reduction in the thalamocortical activation characteristic of this disease which limits motor cortex drive from generating appropriate commands which contributes to bradykinesia and hypokinesia of the orofacial mechanism.\n\nTiming and Causality in the Generation of Learned Eyelid Responses\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSÃ¡nchez-Campusano, Raudel; Gruart, AgnÃ¨s; Delgado-GarcÃ­a, JosÃ© M.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe cerebellum-red nucleus-facial motoneuron (Mn) pathway has been reported as being involved in the proper timing of classically conditioned eyelid responses. This special type of associative learning serves as a model of event timing for studying the role of the cerebellum in dynamic motor control. Here, we have re-analyzed the firing activities of cerebellar posterior interpositus (IP) neurons and orbicularis oculi (OO) Mns in alert behaving cats during classical eyeblink conditioning, using a delay paradigm. The aim was to revisit the hypothesis that the IP neurons (IPns) can be considered a neuronal phase-modulating device supporting OO Mns firing with an emergent timing mechanism and an explicit correlation code during learned eyelid movements. Optimized experimental and computational tools allowed us to determine the different causal relationships (temporal order and correlation code) during and between trials. These intra- and inter-trial timing strategies expanding from sub-second range (millisecond timing) to longer-lasting ranges (interval timing) expanded the functional domain of cerebellar timing beyond motor control. Interestingly, the results supported the above-mentioned hypothesis. The causal inferences were influenced by the precise motor and pre-motor spike timing in the cause-effect interval, and, in addition, the timing of the learned responses depended on cerebellarâMn network causality. Furthermore, the timing of CRs depended upon the probability of simulated causal conditions in the cause-effect interval and not the mere duration of the inter-stimulus interval. In this work, the close relation between timing and causality was verified. It could thus be concluded that the firing activities of IPns may be related more to the proper performance of ongoing CRs (i.e., the proper timing as a consequence of the pertinent causality) than to their generation and/or initiation. PMID:21941469\n\nA Wittgenstein Approach to the Learning of OO-modeling\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHolmboe, Christian\n\n2004-12-01\n\nThe paper uses Ludwig Wittgenstein's theories about the relationship between thought, language, and objects of the world to explore the assumption that OO-thinking resembles natural thinking. The paper imports from research in linguistic philosophy to computer science education research. I show how UML class diagrams (i.e., an artificial context-free language) correspond to the logically perfect languages described in Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. In Philosophical Investigations Wittgenstein disputes his previous theories by showing that natural languages are not constructed by rules of mathematical logic, but are language games where the meaning of a word is constructed through its use in social contexts. Contradicting the claim that OO-thinking is easy to learn because of its similarity to natural thinking, I claim that OO-thinking is difficult to learn because of its differences from natural thinking. The nature of these differences is not currently well known or appreciated. I suggest how explicit attention to the nature and implications of different language games may improve the teaching and learning of OO-modeling as well as programming.\n\nStructure of parasites community in Chaetobranchopsis orbicularis (Cichlidae), a host from the Amazon River system in northern Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nTavares-Dias, Marcos; Oliveira, Marcos Sidney Brito\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThe aim of this paper was to investigate the component communities of parasites in Chaetobranchopsis orbicularis from a tributary of the Amazon River system, in Northern Brazil. In 32 fish examined, 902,551 parasites were collected, including Ichthyophthirius multifiliis, Piscinoodinium pillulare, Sciadicleithrum geophagi, Posthodiplostomum sp., Clinostomum marginatum, Echinorhynchus paranensis, Neoechinorhynchus pterodoridis, and Dolops longicauda. I. multifiliis was the dominant and abundant parasite species. The ectoparasites presented aggregate dispersion, but the endoparasites showed random dispersion pattern. Mean species richness was 4.0Â Â±Â 1.5 parasites, mean Brillouin diversity (HB) was 0.33Â Â±Â 0.28, mean evenness was 0.15Â Â±Â 0.13, and Berger-Parker dominance (d) was 0.85Â Â±Â 0.17. The species richness of parasites and HB were positively correlated with the length of hosts. There was positive correlation between the abundance of P. pillulare and length and weight, between the abundance of I. multifiliis and weight, as well as between the abundance of E. paranensis and N. pterodoridis and the length of hosts. Body condition of the hosts was not affected by moderate parasitism. The low diversity of endoparasites indicates that C. orbicularis is a host with low position in the food web. This is the first record of all these parasites for C. orbicularis.\n\nMagmatic Processes at Kilauea Volcano Revealed by the Puu Oo Eruption\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGarcia, M. O.; Marske, J. P.; Pietruszka, A. P.; Rhodes, J. M.; Norman, M. D.; Eiler, J.\n\n2008-12-01\n\nThe ongoing Puu Oo eruption (1983 to present) provides an unprecedented opportunity to probe the crustal and mantle magmatic processes beneath Kilauea volcano. Here we present Pb, Sr, Nd and O isotope ratios, major- and trace-element abundances, olivine compositions, and petrography data for Puu Oo lavas an compare them to the Kilauea historical record. Crustal processes are dominated by olivine fractionation and accumulation with minor clinopyroxene fractionation, and to a lesser extent and only periodically when eruption rates decrease, by crustal contamination. Systematic variations in Sr isotope ratios, incompatible trace element ratios, and MgO-normalized major elements document remarkable changes in parental magma compositions delivered to Puu Oo. Inflections in some trends correlate broadly with increasing intermediate depth earthquakes under the Kilauea's summit and to changes in eruption rate. Thus, volcanic events are influenced by melting and transport processes. One surprising feature is the systematic trend of Puu Oo rock compositions away from and beyond typical historical Kilauea compositions towards those of lavas from neighboring Mauna Loa volcano. The source for this component in Puu Oo lavas is a hybrid with about equal mixtures of historical Kilauea and Mauna Loa end members. The Puu Oo lava trend continues the cyclic pattern of compositional variation that extends back over 1000 years. Similar trends are also recorded on a coarser scale in HSDP lavas. These patterns of cyclic compositional variation are important for understanding melting processes in Hawaiian and other volcanoes.\n\n[Botulinum toxin and rejuvenation of the eye].\n\nPubMed\n\nVolpei, Ch; Miniconi, M-J; Brunner, C I; Besins, T; Braccini, F\n\n2013-01-01\n\nTreatments with botulinum toxin in the forehead and periorbital areas may induce disappointing or even paradoxical results.

PubMed and Scopus were searched using the terms \"corrugator\" AND \"anatomy.\" Among the 60 full texts from the 145 relevant abstracts, 34 articles without sufficient content were excluded and 4 articles drawn from the reference lists were added. Among the 30 articles analyzed (721 hemifaces), 28% classified by oblique head and transverse head, and 72% did not. Corrugator originated mostly from the medial supraorbital rim (45%), followed by the medial frontal bone (31%), the medial infraorbital rim (17%), and the upper nasal process (7%). Corrugator extended through the frontalis and orbicularis oculi (41%), only the frontalis (41%), or only the orbicularis oculi (18%). Corrugator ran superolaterally (59%), or laterally (41%). Corrugators inserted mostly to the middle of the eyebrow (57%), or the medial half of the eyebrow (36%), but also to the glabella region (7%). The length of the corrugator ranged 38 to 53âmm. The transverse head (23.38âmm) was longer than the oblique head (19.75âmm). Corrugator was thicker at the medial canthus than at the midpupillary line. Corrugator was innervated by the temporal branch of the facial nerve (66%), the zygomatic branch (17%), or the angular nerve (zygomatic branch and buccal branch, 17%). Supraorbital nerve (60%) or supratrochlear nerve (40%) penetrated the corrugator. The action was depressing, pulling the eyebrow medially (91%), or with medial eyebrow elevation and lateral eyebrow depression (9%). Surgeons must keep this anatomy in mind during surgical procedures.\n\nInfrared absorption spectrum of the simplest deuterated Criegee intermediate CD{sub 2}OO\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHuang, Yu-Hsuan; Nishimura, Yoshifumi; Witek, Henryk A., E-mail: hwitek@mail.nctu.edu.tw, E-mail: yplee@mail.nctu.edu.tw\n\nWe report a transient infrared (IR) absorption spectrum of the simplest deuterated Criegee intermediate CD{sub 2}OO recorded using a step-scan Fourier-transform spectrometer coupled with a multipass absorption cell. CD{sub 2}OO was produced from photolysis of flowing mixtures of CD{sub 2}I{sub 2}, N{sub 2}, and O{sub 2} (13 or 87 Torr) with laser light at 308 nm. The recorded spectrum shows close structural similarity with the spectrum of CH{sub 2}OO reported previously [Y.-T. Su et al., Science 340, 174 (2013)]. The four bands observed at 852, 1017, 1054, and 1318 cm{sup â1} are assigned to the OO stretching mode, two distinctmoreÂ Â» in-plane OCD bending modes, and the CO stretching mode of CD{sub 2}OO, respectively, according to vibrational wavenumbers, IR intensities, rotational contours, and deuterium-isotopic shifts predicted with extensive quantum-chemical calculations. The CO-stretching mode of CD{sub 2}OO at 1318 cm{sup â1} is blue shifted from the corresponding band of CH{sub 2}OO at 1286 cm{sup â1}; this can be explained by a mechanism based on mode mixing and isotope substitution. A band near 936 cm{sup â1}, observed only at higher pressure (87 Torr), is tentatively assigned to the CD{sub 2} wagging mode of CD{sub 2}IOO.Â«Â less\n\nInvolvement of a Serpin serine protease inhibitor (OoSerpin) from mollusc Octopus ocellatus in antibacterial response.\n\nPubMed\n\nWei, Xiumei; Xu, Jie; Yang, Jianmin; Liu, Xiangquan; Zhang, Ranran; Wang, Weijun; Yang, Jialong\n\n2015-01-01\n\nSerpin is an important member of serine protease inhibitors (SPIs), which is capable of regulating proteolytic events and involving in a variety of physiological processes. In present study, a Serpin homolog was identified from Octopus ocellatus (designated as OoSerpin). Full-length cDNA of OoSerpin was of 1735 bp, containing a 5' untranslated region of 214 bp, a 3' UTR of 282 bp, and an open reading frame of 1239 bp. The open reading frame encoded a polypeptide of 412 amino acids which has a predicted molecular weight of 46.5 kDa and an isoelectric point of 8.52. The OoSerpin protein shares 37% sequence identity with other Serpins from Mus musculus (NP_941373) and Ixodes scapularis (XP_002407493). The existence of a conserved SERPIN domain strongly suggested that OoSerpin was a member of the Serpin subfamily. Expression patterns of OoSerpin, both in tissues and towards bacterial stimulation, were then characterized. The mRNA of OoSerpin was constitutively expressed at different levels in all tested tissues of untreated O. ocellatus, including mantle (lowest), muscle, renal sac, gill, hemocyte, gonad, systemic heart, and hepatopancreas (highest). The transcriptional level of OoSerpin was significantly up-regulated (P<0.01) in O. ocellatus upon bacterial challenges with Vibrio anguillarum and Micrococcus luteus, indicating its involvement in the antibacterial immune response. Furthermore, rOoSerpin, the recombinant protein of OoSerpin, exhibited strong abilities to inhibit proteinase activities of trypsin and chymotrypsin as well as the growth of Escherichia coli. Our results demonstrate that OoSerpin is a potential antibacterial factor involved in the immune response of O. ocellatus against bacterial infection. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, bacterial infections are causing severe mortality episodes. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find an effective management solution. Besides the supplying difficulty and high costs of veterinary drugs in French Polynesia, batfish aquaculture takes place close to the coral reef, where use of synthetic persistent drugs should be restricted. Medicinal plants and bioactive algae are emerging as a cheaper and more sustainable alternative to chemical drugs. We have studied the effect of local Polynesian plants and the local opportunistic algae Asparagopsis taxiformis on batfish when orally administered. Weight gain and expression of two immune-related genes (lysozyme g - Lys G and transforming growth factor beta - TGF-Î²1) were studied to analyze immunostimulant activity of plants on P.Â orbicularis. Results showed that several plants increased Lys G and TGF-Î²1 expression on orbicular batfish after 2 and 3 weeks of oral administration. A.Â taxiformis was the plant displaying the most promising results, promoting a weight gain of 24% after 3 weeks of oral administration and significantly increasing the relative amount of both Lys G and TGF-Î²1 transcripts in kidney and spleen of P.Â orbicularis.

To compensate for this anatomical defect, this study hypothetically proposes that initial voluntary contraction of the levator fast-twitch muscle fibres stretches the mechanoreceptors in MÃ¼ller's muscle and evokes proprioception, which continuously induces reflex contraction of slow-twitch fibres of the levator and frontalis muscles. This study sought to determine whether unilateral transcutaneous electrical stimulation to the trigeminal proprioceptive fibres that innervate the mechanoreceptors in MÃ¼ller's muscle could induce electromyographic responses in the frontalis muscles, with monitoring responses in the orbicularis oculi muscles. The study population included 27 normal subjects and 23 subjects with aponeurotic blepharoptosis, who displayed persistently raised eyebrows on primary gaze and light eyelid closure. The stimulation induced a short-latency response in the ipsilateral frontalis muscle of all subjects and long-latency responses in the bilateral frontalis muscles of normal subjects. However, it did not induce long-latency responses in the bilateral frontalis muscles of subjects with aponeurotic blepharoptosis. The orbicularis oculi muscles showed R1 and/or R2 responses. The stimulation might reach not only the proprioceptive fibres, but also other sensory fibres related to the blink or corneal reflex. The experimental system can provoke a monosynaptic short-latency response in the ipsilateral frontalis muscle, probably through the mesencephalic trigeminal proprioceptive neuron and the frontalis motor neuron, and polysynaptic long-latency responses in the bilateral frontalis muscles through an unknown pathway. The latter neural circuit appeared to be engaged by the circumstances of aponeurotic blepharoptosis.\n\nVisual and psychological stress during computer work in healthy, young females-physiological responses.\n\nPubMed\n\nMork, Randi; Falkenberg, Helle K; Fostervold, Knut Inge; Thorud, Hanne Mari S\n\n2018-05-30\n\nAmong computer workers, visual complaints, and neck pain are highly prevalent. This study explores how occupational simulated stressors during computer work, like glare and psychosocial stress, affect physiological responses in young females with normal vision. The study was a within-subject laboratory experiment with a counterbalanced, repeated design. Forty-three females performed four 10-min computer-work sessions with different stress exposures: (1) minimal stress; (2) visual stress (direct glare); (3) psychological stress; and (4) combined visual and psychological stress.
