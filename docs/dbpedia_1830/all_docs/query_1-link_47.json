        "text": "When you think of castles, what comes to mind? England, Scotland, Ireland...Illinois?\n\nSupposedly Illinois has a few castles that you can take a road trip and explore, one of them is right here in Quincy. The Villa Katherine, but what other castles should you visit?\n\nCastle of Palmyra\n\nNo not located in Palmyra, Missouri, but in Palmyra, Illinois. You can actually stay at this castle which you can book at VRBO.com. Stay in a castle for the weekend, anniversary, or birthday. It is a bit pricey at $1,250 a night you might want to get a group together and split the price tag, but it does come with its own three-hole golf course.\n\nRavenstone Castle\n\nIn Harvard, Illinois the Ravebstone Castle was built in 2001, but when you step inside it's like stepping into a time machine to the 16th Century. You can get married at this castle, take a tour, stay the night, have a birthday party, or and party.\n\nAurora Sunken Gardens\n\nThis is not as much as a castle but a garden that you would see at a castle. It's definitely a place to take \"the gram\" pictures for weddings, prom, engagement pictures, and everything in between. These gardens are located in Aurora, Illinois.\n\nAllerton Park and Retreat Center\n\nThis place is just that, a retreat. Also used for parties, weddings, and more these castle is on 1,500 acres of woodlands and prairies. The estate was built in the 1900s and is located 25-miles from Urbana-Champaign, the property was donated to the university in the min-1940s for research.\n\nBoo Castle Park\n\nThe park was built in honor of a man's son nicknamed \"Boo\" who passed away in a car accident. The park is every prince and princess's dream with dragons to climb on, a castle to draw swords on (don't worry fake ones), and maybe even a game on dungeons and dragons. It's guarded by knights and wizards and looks like a cool park to visit. It's located in Carbondale, Illinois."
