A supplier, service company, or operator is not required to: (1) disclose ingredients that are not disclosed to it by the manufacturer, supplier, or service company; (2) disclose ingredients that were not intentionally added to the hydraulic fracturing treatment; (3) disclose ingredients that occur incidentally or are otherwise unintentionally present which may be present in trace amounts, may be the incidental result of a chemical reaction or chemical process, or may be constituents of naturally occurring materials that become part of a hydraulic fracturing fluid; or (4) identify specific chemical ingredients and/or their CAS numbers that are claimed as entitled to trade secret protection based on the additive in which they are found or provide the concentration of such ingredients, unless the Office of the Attorney General, or a court of proper jurisdiction on appeal of a determination by the Office of the Attorney General, determines that the information would not be entitled to trade secret protection under Texas Government Code, Chapter 552, if the information had been provided to the Commission. (e) Trade secret protection. (1) A supplier, service company, or operator is not required to disclose trade secret information, unless the Office of the Attorney General or a court of proper jurisdiction determines that the information is not entitled to trade secret protection under Texas Government Code, Chapter 552. (2) If the specific identity and/or CAS number of a chemical ingredient, the concentration of a chemical ingredient, or both the specific identity and/or CAS number and concentration of a chemical ingredient are claimed or have been finally determined to be entitled to protection as a trade secret under Texas Government Code, Chapter 552, the supplier, service company, or operator, as applicable, may withhold the specific identity and/or CAS number, the concentration, or both the specific identity and/or CAS number and concentration, of the chemical ingredient from the information provided to the operator. If the supplier, service company, or operator, as applicable, elects to withhold that information, the supplier, service company, or operator, as applicable, must provide to the operator or the Commission, as applicable, information that: (A) indicates that the specific identity and/or CAS number of the chemical ingredient, the concentration of the chemical ingredient, or both the specific identity and/or CAS number and concentration of the chemical ingredient are entitled to protection as trade secret information; and (B) discloses the chemical family associated with the chemical ingredient; or (C) discloses the properties and effects of the chemical ingredient(s), the identity of which is withheld.

A landowner who owned the property on which the wellhead is located, or owned adjacent property, on or after the date the operator filed with the Commission the completion report for the subject well may challenge a claim of entitlement to trade secret protection within that 24-month period only. The Commission will determine whether or not the request has been received within the allowed 24-month period. (5) If the Commission determines that the request has been received within the allowed 24-month period and the certification is properly completed and signed, the Commission will consider this sufficient for the purpose of forwarding the request to the Office of the Attorney General.

(7) If the Office of the Attorney General determines that the claim of entitlement to trade secret protection is valid under Texas Government Code, Chapter 552, if the information had been provided to the Commission, the owner of the claimed trade secret information shall not be required to disclose the trade secret information, subject to appeal. (8) The request shall be deemed withdrawn if, prior to the determination of the Office of the Attorney General on the validity of the trade secret claim, the owner of the claimed trade secret information provides confirmation to the Commission and the Office of the Attorney General that the owner of the claimed trade secret information has voluntarily provided the information that is the subject of the request to the requestor subject to a claim of trade secret protection, or the requestor submits to the Commission and the Office of the Attorney General a written notice withdrawing the request.

(10) If the Office of the Attorney General, or a court of proper jurisdiction on appeal of a determination by the Office of the Attorney General, determines that the withheld information would not be entitled to trade secret protection under Texas Government Code, Chapter 552, if the information had been provided to the Commission, the owner of the claimed trade secret information must disclose such information to the requestor as directed by the Office of the Attorney General or a court of proper jurisdiction on appeal.
