        "text": "Transcript\n\nEarly explorers didn’t actually know where they were going when they set out to discover new land.\n\nThey had to draw and redraw maps as they went.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges was calculating their longitude, how far east or west they were.\n\nlongitude\n\nIn the 15th century they used a method called dead reckoning.\n\nDead reckoning is based on the ship’s previous position, its speed, and its direction, which was taken using a compass.\n\nDead Reckoning\n\nSpeed was measured using a log and a line.\n\nThe ship log was a piece of wood that would drag a rope line overboard.\n\nA sandglass was used to time the letting out of the rope, which was knotted at regular intervals.\n\nSailors could tell how fast their ship was travelling by counting the number of knots that passed overboard before the sandglass ran out.\n\nWe still use the term knots to refer to the speed of boats.\n\nBut using dead reckoning wasn't very accurate.\n\ndead reckoning\n\nused to estimate longitude\n\nA breakthrough came in the 18th century, when explorers such as James Cook started using watches called timekeepers, or chronometers.\n\nJames Cook\n\n1728–1779\n\nChronometers were set to show the time of a known location.\n\nChronometers\n\nThe Greenwich Observatory in London, UK, at longitude zero degrees, was a popular choice.\n\nGreenwich Observatory\n\nLondon, UK\n\nHaving set sail, explorers could now calculate their longitude by comparing the time in their current location, taken from the position of the Sun, to the time in London.\n\nFor example, when the Sun was at its highest position, they knew it was noon.\n\ntime taken from Sun\n\nSo if the chronometer said it was 2pm in London, they knew they must be two time zones away, or 30 degrees west of zero degrees longitude – in the middle of the Atlantic!\n\ntime on chronometer\n\nchronometer\n\nwatch used to calculate longitude\n\nToday sailors use GPS to accurately map their longitude, but navigating the seas can still be a great adventure."
