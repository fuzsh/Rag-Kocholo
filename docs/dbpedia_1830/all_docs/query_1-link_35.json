British graves were transferred here after the Armistice from the surrounding battlefields and other burial grounds, including:-\n\nAISNE-MARNE AMERICAN CEMETERY, BELLEAU, a permanent cemetery of 2,212 graves, on the South side of the Chateau Thierry-Gandelu road, in which one British soldier, who fell in July 1918, was buried.

ALBIN, where one British soldier who fell in July 1918, was buried.\n\nHAUTEVESNES CHURCHYARD, where three British soldiers who fell in September 1914, were buried.\n\nThe 193 French and 137 German graves have since been removed and their site now forms the Communal Cemetery of the village.\n\nThere are now 124, 1914-18 war casualties commemorated in this site. Of these, 33 are unidentified.\n\nThe two British plots cover an area of 758 square metres and are enclosed by a low rubble wall on three sides.\n\nTotal Burials: 124.\n\nIdentified Casualties: United Kingdom 91.\n\nUnidentified Casualties: United Kingdom 33.\n\nImages in gallery below © Johan Pauwels\n\n39635 Private\n\nJames Buckley\n\n34th Bn.
