You can now specify release channels or version numbers:\n\nThe weekly channel was updated to version 3.34.\n\nThe quarterly channel was updated to version 3.33.\n\nVersion 3.32 is still available.\n\nVersion 3.31 was deleted, and can no longer be used. Customers specifying versions 3.0 to 3.31 will receive their default channel instead, either the weekly channel or the quarterly channel (see the Versioning guide).\n\nA larger control UI is now enabled. With the increase in touch operations on various devices, we adjusted the control UI to fit for both finger touches and mouse clicks. (It's possible to opt out by loading the API with v=quarterly, v=3.33, or v=3.32.)\n\n3.33\n\n11 June 2018\n\nChanges:\n\nPlace Details requests now support using fields to specify the types of place data to return.\n\nTwo new Find Place requests are now available:\n\nFind Place from Query\n\nFind Place from Phone Number\n\nPlace autocomplete now supports session-based billing.\n\n16 May 2018\n\nVersion 3.33 of the Maps JavaScript API is now available as the experimental version.

Current default is all Tile Markers.\n\nAt high zoom levels (zoomed in) when dragging Pegman, prefer the NEAREST, rather than the Google-selected BEST panorama.\n\ngestureHandling: none now works the same as draggable: false when changed inside a mousedown handler (it now takes effect on mousedown).\n\n21 November 2017\n\nVersion 3.31 of the Maps JavaScript API is now available as the experimental version. See the guide to API versioning.\n\nChanges:\n\nThe region field is now returned with Place Details requests.\n\n3.30\n\n16 August 2017\n\nVersion 3.30 of the Maps JavaScript API is now available as the experimental version. See the guide to API versioning.\n\nChanges:\n\nThe fullscreen button is now enabled by default on desktop.\n\nThis version introduces the gestureHandling property for desktop applications that enable user interaction using a mouse scroll wheel or touchpad. To control how users interact with a map, it is recommended that you use the gestureHandling property instead of the scrollwheel, disableDoubleClickZoom, and draggable properties.\n\n3.29\n\n16 May 2017\n\nVersion 3.29 of the Maps JavaScript API is now available as the experimental version. See the guide to API versioning.\n\nChanges:\n\nThe format of the pano ID for user generated (custom) Street View panoramas has changed due to underlying infrastructure updates. This slightly increases the number of available panoramas.\n\nRequests for user generated (custom) panoramas using the old pano ID in the Maps JavaScript API still work. If you try to find a panorama using the position property of the StreetViewPanoramaOptions object, your result will contain the new pano ID. There is no requirement to map the old and new pano IDs, as both will remain valid.\n\nIf you depend on pano ID parsing and/or verification logic, note that the format of pano IDs may change.\n\nYou can report any issues using the issue tracker.\n\nUpdates on the fitBounds method of the google.maps.Map class.\n\nTo change the viewport while a map is hidden, you can now set the map to visibility: hidden, thereby ensuring that the map div has an actual size.\n\n3.28\n\n18 April 2017\n\nThe draggable property of the MapOptions object is deprecated. To disable dragging of the map on desktop devices, use the gestureHandling property and set it to none.\n\n15 February 2017\n\nVersion 3.28 of the Maps JavaScript API is now available as the experimental version. See the guide to API versioning.\n\nChanges:\n\nSigned-in maps are no longer supported in version 3.28 and higher of the Maps JavaScript API.\n\n3.27\n\n2 February 2017\n\nFixed:\n\nIssue 11331: text inside InfoWindow cannot be selected\n\n10 January 2017\n\nYou can now restrict Autocomplete predictions to only surface from multiple countries. You can do this by specifying up to 5 countries in the componentRestrictions field of the AutocompleteOptions.\n\n15 November 2016\n\nVersion 3.27 of the Maps JavaScript API is now available as the experimental version. (See the guide to API versioning.)\n\nChanges:\n\nA new gestureHandling option in the MapOptions object helps you optimise your users' experience when interacting with the map on mobile devices. The available values are:\n\ngreedy: The map always pans (up or down, left or right) when the user swipes (drags on) the screen. In other words, both a one-finger swipe and a two-finger swipe cause the map to pan.\n\ncooperative: The user must swipe with one finger to scroll the page and two fingers to pan the map. If the user swipes the map with one finger, an overlay appears on the map, with a prompt telling the user to use two fingers to move the map. View the sample above on a mobile device to see cooperative mode in action.\n\nnone: The map is not pannable or pinchable.\n\nauto (default): The behavior is either cooperative or greedy, depending on whether the page is scrollable or not.\n\nFor more details and examples, see the developer's guide.\n\nThe fullscreen control is visible by default on mobile devices, so users can easily enlarge the map. When the map is in fullscreen mode, users can pan the map using one or two fingers. Note: iOS doesn't support the fullscreen feature. The fullscreen control is therefore not visible on iOS devices.\n\nSigned-in maps deprecated\n\n6 October 2016\n\nThe signed-in feature is deprecated. Versions 3.27 and earlier of the Maps JavaScript API continue to support signed-in maps. A future version will no longer support signed-in maps, but will continue to support features that save a place to Google Maps using an info window or the SaveWidget. Read more about signed-in maps.\n\nChange in via waypoints in Directions service response\n\n29 August 2016\n\nThe via_waypoints field in the Directions service response contains an array of waypoints that were not specified in the original request. The via_waypoints field will continue to appear in the draggable directions response, but is deprecated in the alternative route response. Version 3.27 will be the last version of the API that supports via_waypoints in alternative routes.\n\nThe recommended approach is to request alternative routes, then display all routes as non-draggable plus the main route as draggable. Users can drag the main route until it matches an alternative route. The via_waypoints field is available on the resulting route (dragged by the user).\n\n3.26\n\n18 August 2016\n\nVersion 3.26 of the Maps JavaScript API is now available as the experimental version. (See the guide to API versioning.)\n\nChanges:\n\nA new Street View renderer brings rendering improvements, including smoother transitions and animations, improved object modeling, better support for mobile, and clearer controls. See the details on the Google Geo Developers Blog.\n\nThe API now supports device orientation events in Street View, so users on mobile devices can look around by moving their phones. As a developer, you can enable or disable this feature. See the developer's guide for details.\n\n3.25\n\n25 May 2016\n\nVersion 3.25 of the Maps JavaScript API is now available as the experimental version. (See the guide to API versioning.)\n\nInternet Explorer 9 support ends\n\n2 May 2016\n\nAs of April 30th, 2016, Internet Explorer 9 is no longer officially supported by the Maps JavaScript API. See the list of supported browsers.\n\n3.24\n\n14 April 2016\n\nChanges:\n\nYou can now disable the clickability of map icons. A map icon represents a point of interest, also known as a POI. See the setClickableIcons method on google.maps.Map.\n\n31 March 2016\n\nFixed:\n\nIssue 9507: Links in Street View now work again in Safari.\n\n28 March 2016\n\nFixed:\n\nIssue 9394: Info windows automatically close when the user opens an info window for a base map icon, and vice versa.\n\nShow a white Google logo when the base map is styled using the styles property on the map (previously, the logo became white only when applying a style using a StyledMapType).\n\n18 March 2016\n\nFixed:\n\nIssue 9424: new LatLng({lat: 0, lng: 0})\n\nFixed mouse panning with the new Street View renderer (with google.maps.streetViewViewer = 'photosphere').\n\n15 February 2016\n\nChanges:\n\nThe ability to opt out of the new controls using google.maps.controlStyle = 'azteca' has been removed.\n\n3.23\n\n18 January 2016\n\nChanges:\n\nThis release includes a new full-screen control for the map. Users can click the control to maximize the map so that it takes up the entire screen. By default, this control is turned off. You can enable it in MapOptions, and configure it using the FullscreenControlOptions. Its default position is RIGHT_TOP.\n\nThe full-screen control for Street View is enabled by default. You can disable it via StreetViewPanoramaOptions and configure it using the FullscreenControlOptions. Its default position is now RIGHT_TOP.\n\n4 January 2016\n\nFixed:\n\nIssue 9009: When synthesizing mouse events from touch, use the left button instead of the middle button, for compatibility with jQuery.\n\nIssue 4201: The API no longer makes use of eval(). Therefore, it is now possible to use the API without the unsafe-eval Content Security Policy directive.\n\n21 December 2015\n\nChanges:\n\nMap Option to disable the sign in button for signed in maps (it will show the avatar for logged in users, it will still allow to sign in via signed in actions (e.g. starring) but it will no longer have the button to sign in on the map when this option is set).\n\nThe interface for text search requests has changed. The types parameter is deprecated as of March 1, 2016, replaced by a new type parameter which only supports one type per search request. Additionally, the establishment, food, and grocery_or_supermarket types will no longer be supported as search parameters (however these types may still be returned in the results of a search). Requests using the legacy types parameter will be supported until March 1, 2017, after which all text searches must use the new implementation.\n\n2 December 2015\n\nChanges:\n\nThe Autocomplete constructor verifies that it is given an input element.\n\nBase map point of interest info windows show the same content in non-signed-in mode as signed-in mode.\n\nGoogle Maps API externs for the Closure Compiler now specify a type (number or string) for enums.\n\n25 November 2015\n\nChanges:\n\nAdded .toJSON() methods toLatLng and LatLngBounds objects. These are intended to be used via JSON.stringify().\n\n19 November 2015\n\nChanges:\n\nWhite google logo for styled maps\n\nFixed:\n\nIssue 8674: Bug: Protect against img { max-width: 100%; }\n\n3.22\n\n7 January 2016\n\nFixed:\n\nIssue 9009: When synthesizing mouse events from touch, use the left button instead of the middle button, for compatibility with jQuery.\n\n10 November 2015\n\nChanges:\n\nThe Directions service and the Distance Matrix service now return the predicted time in traffic (in response field duration_in_traffic) when the travel mode is driving. To receive predicted travel times, include a drivingOptions object literal in the request, specifying a current or future departureTime. You can also specify a trafficModel of optimistic, pessimistic, or best guess (default), to influence the assumptions used when calculating the travel time. For details, see the developer's guide for the Directions service and the Distance Matrix service. Note: The duration_in_traffic is available only to Google Maps Platform Premium Plan customers.\n\nDeprecated:\n\nThe durationInTraffic request field is now deprecated. It was previously the recommended way for Google Maps Platform Premium Plan customers to specify whether the result should include a duration that takes into account current traffic conditions. You should now use the drivingOptions field instead.\n\n5 November 2015\n\nDeprecated:\n\nThe AdSense library has been deprecated since May 2015, and is no longer available in the experimental version of the Maps JavaScript API. The library will be removed from the release and frozen versions of the API soon. An alternative solution is Google AdSense. See the guide to creating an AdSense ad unit.\n\n22 September 2015\n\nChanges:\n\nAdded support for place IDs when making directions and distance matrix requests: DirectionsRequest.origin, DirectionsRequest.destination and DirectionsWaypoint.location now accept Place objects, and DistanceMatrixRequest.origins and DistanceMatrixRequest.destinations now accept an array of Place objects.\n\n15 September 2015\n\nChanges:\n\nThe default position and appearance has changed for many of the controls on the map and on Street View panoramas. The user experience is now consistent regardless of whether a map is using signed-in mode mode or not, and is also more consistent with the Google Maps website. If you want to continue using the earlier set of controls for a while, you can set google.maps.controlStyle = 'azteca' in v3.22.\n\nThe new Full Screen control in Street View allows the user to open the Street View panorama in fullscreen mode.\n\nDeprecated:\n\nThe Overview Map control is no longer available.\n\nThe Pan control on the map is no longer available. To pan the view, users click and drag, or swipe, the map. (Note that the Pan control in Street View remains available.)\n\nThe Zoom control is available in only one style, and google.maps.ZoomControlStyle is therefore no longer available.\n\n1 September 2015\n\nChanges:\n\nAdded LatLngBounds literals\n\nFixed issue with overly broad CSS classes\n\nImproved tile loading after the map is resized\n\nInternet Explorer 8 support ends\n\n31 August 2015\n\nAs of August 31st, 2015, Internet Explorer 8 is no longer officially supported by the Maps JavaScript API.
