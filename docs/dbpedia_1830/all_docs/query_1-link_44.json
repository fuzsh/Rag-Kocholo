        "text": "1200 - 1800. During the afternoon the main force moved eastward in the SIBUYAN Sea toward TABLAS Island, still under heavy air attack by Task Force THIRTY-EIGHT and at one time (1605) reported to be milling around. One light cruiser had been reported sunk, other ships damaged in varying degree and one Yamato class battleship very severely damaged. At 1749 the Enterprise reported that this force consisted of about 25 ships in two groups, position 12° 50' N., 122° 35' E. on a westerly heading when last seen at 1600.\n\nNo reports were received indicating contact during the afternoon with the southern force which, from a report originated in the late morning, had been identified as 2 Fuso class battleships, 1 heavy cruiser and 4 destroyers.\n\nAt 1647 a message was received from an Essex search plane reporting a force east of northern LUZON in position 18° 25' N., 125° 28' E., on course 270, speed 15 knots, consisting of 3 carriers, 2 light cruisers and 3 destroyers. At 1755 an amplifying despatch from Commander Task Force THIRTY-EIGHT reported this force as 3 carriers, 4 - 6 heavy cruisers and 6 destroyers, one of the carriers being an Ise class; position 18° 10' N., 125° 30' E., course 210, speed 15 knots.\n\n0000 - 0253. (At which time Task Force THIRTY-FOUR was formed.) During this period no contact reports were received on the main body but at 0102 a message from Commander THIRD Fleet stated that the course given in the 2145 Independence report apparently should have been southeast instead of northwest.\n\nD/F reports were received as follows:\n\nTOR TIME WITHIN POSITION 0000 I Surface 242214 I 500 Miles 14° 35' N., 125° 05' E. 0030 Enemy Unit 242254 250 \" 09° 30' N., 125° 20' E. 0104 Surface 242304 250 \" 18° 05' N., 125° 00' E. 0130 Surface 250038 250 \" 11° 00' N., 128° 00' E. 0216 Enemy Unit 250107 500 \" 11° 25' N., 123° 30' E.\n\nThe southern force was again contacted. PT 130, in a message received at 0127, reported 3 destroyers and 2 larger ships southeast of BOHOL Island on a northerly course at 242310. Eighteen minutes later PT 127's message of 0030 was received reporting two contacts 10 miles bearing 310 from CAMIGUIN Island (09° 10' N., 124° 45' E.). At 0224 a report from LCI 16 was received of a surface contact at 0123, 18 miles off TAANCAN Point on southern LEYTE Island.\n\nThe northern carrier force was reported against at 0209 by an Independence plane which made contact at 0205 in position 16° 43' N., 125° 37' E. and gave the composition of the group as 5 ships -- 2 large, 2 small and one undetermined. At 0212 an amplifying report corrected this to 3 large ships and 3 small ships on course 110°, speed 15 knots. At 0218 the same Independence plane reported another force 40 miles astern of the 6-ship group on the same course and speed."
