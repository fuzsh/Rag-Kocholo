        "text": "Right ascension is a historical oddity.\n\nTo specify a point in the sky you need a coordinate system, the one which we have come to use has its origin at the Point of Aries on the Equator and the Ecliptic (a reasonable choice), It uses the Equator for one axis, and the meridian through the point of Aries for the other, again these are convenient and reasonable.\n\nThe coordinate system also requires a unit to be chosen for measuring angular distance. For measuring declination, we use degrees. The more mathematically pure may prefer radians, but degrees are a commonly used unit for measuring angles.\n\nFor measuring the angular distance around the equator we have come to use \"hours\", by dividing the full turn into 24 parts. This is a historical oddity. It has a few conveniences: The sidereal day is only slightly shorter than 24 hours, so a star with RA of 1hr will be due south about 1 hour after a star with a RA of 0hr (not exactly but close enough for a rule of thumb). A telescope with an equatorial mount that is set to make a full turn in 24 hours will track stars well enough for a human observer.\n\nDividing the equator into (23+56/60) parts would be inconvenient since its not a whole number. For these reasons Flamsteed used Hours for his catalogue in 1712, and we have followed his tradition.\n\nSo the use of \"hours\" may be roughly related to the apparent motion of the stars, but it is really just a way of specifying an angle, and using 24 is easier than (23+56/60)\n\nThe problem is not that right ascension goes from 0 to 24 hours (or 0 to any other number). The problem is that the Earth is revolving around the Sun, and our time system is based on the Sun. Because of the motion around the Sun, one solar day (24 hours 0 minutes 0 seconds) is different than one sidereal day (23 hours 56 minutes 4 seconds). So you need two clocks: one for the sun, and one for the stars.\n\nAn example may help. Let's change right ascension to be from 0 to 100. At midnight (00:00) on day 1, let's define that 0 right ascension is on the meridian. At 23:56, the Earth has made one complete rotation relative to the stars, so 0 right ascension is back on the meridian. At 24:00, the Earth has made one complete rotation relative to the Sun (one day), but the right ascension has increased to 0.28 during the extra 4 minutes.\n\nDay 2. At 23:52, the Earth has completed a second full rotation relative to the stars, so the right ascension is again 0. But after two complete days (24:00 on day 2), the right ascension is now 0.56."
