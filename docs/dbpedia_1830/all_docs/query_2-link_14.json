        "text": "Basic Geologic Principles For Interpreting Landscape Forming Processes\n\nThe surface of the Earth is shaped by processes moving materials underground and by processes occurring on the surface under the influence of atmospheric, hydrologic, and oceanographic processes. The logical place to start discussion is to examine the material below our feet. Perhaps most fundamental to understanding the geologic origin of landscapes and earth materials is the vastness of geologic time. It took centuries for the scientific community to compile information about the age of different regions in the planet through the study of rocks, the fossils they contain, and the chronology of events in Earth's history (such as the formation of mountain ranges, changes in coastlines, and the evolution of life). One of the products of this collective investigation over time is the geologic time scale (Figure 3-2). The time scale links measures of time (on the scale of periods ranging from thousands, millions, to billions of years) to established names for those time periods used in publications (reports and maps). The geologic time scale has been continuous refined as new data is collected. (See section 1.10 in Chapter 1 for a discussion on geologic time.)\n\nWhat Is Bedrock?\n\nBedrock is the solid rock that occurs beneath soil or alluvium (unconsolidated sediments) that coved the surface of the land in most locations. In some places the bedrock is exposed as rocky outcrops scattered across the landscape, particularly in mountainous areas or along stream canyons. The term outcrop is used to describe a location where bedrock is exposed (or crops out).\n\nWhy do landscapes in different areas have unique characteristics? Its all about the bedrock and its history!\n\nLandscapes change from one region to the next because of the composition and character of bedrock changes from place to place.\n\nGeologists attempt to unravel geologic history by studying the geometry of outcrops in an area. Subtle characteristics of undisturbed landscapes often reveal the location of faults, ore deposits, sources of groundwater, and many other features of geologic interest. Fig. 3-2. Geologic Time Scale\n\nThe Rock Cycle and Rock Classification (revisited)\n\nCharles Lyell (1797-1875) compiled the first geology textbook entitled \"Principles of Geology\" in which he promoted concepts of the \"rock cycle\" (Figure 3-3). The rock cycle illustrates the series of events in which a rock of one type is converted to one or more other types, and then possibly back to the original type. The rock cycle is a graphic and conceptual model to illustrate common kinds of rocks and earth materials and the processes that form or change them over time. Figure 3-4 also illustrates the rock cycleâbut includes more detail about both rocks and earth materials, and selected geologic features associated with geologic processes. Be sure to examine the arrows on the diagrams! Pathways to rock origins may go several routesârocks of any kind can be changed in different ways into a variety of other rocks types. It is important to note that tectonic forces within the Earth are responsible for many of the changes to rocks and surface features on the landscape. Tectonic forces are responsible for the gradual uplift of mountain ranges, both on land and on the seafloor, as well as creating basins that flood with lakes or seawater, and fill in with sediments (Figure 3-5).\n\nThere are 4 classes of rocks and earth materials: igneous rocks, sediments (which are not rocks), sedimentary rocks, and metamorphic rocks.\n\nIgneous rocks are rocks formed from the cooling and crystallization of molten materials (Figure 3-6). The word igneous applies to any rock or mineral that solidified from molten or partly molten material (referring to magma underground or lava on the surface). The word igneous also applies to the processes related to the formation of such rocks. Igneous rocks includes intrusive rocks (rocks that cooled below the surface) and volcanic rocks formed on the Earth's surface by volcanism. Igneous rocks also form from melting associated with extraterrestrial impacts. Examples of igneous rocks include granite, gabbro, and basalt. Rocks of igneous origin are discussed in Chapter 9.\n\nSediments are solid fragments of inorganic or organic material that come from the weathering of rock and soil erosion, and are carried and deposited by wind, water, or ice (Figure 3-7). Sediments may be made up of rock fragments ranging is size from boulders down to microscopic particles, and may contain organic matter. Examples of sediment include gravel, sand, silt, clay, mud (mix of sand, silt, and clay), soil, lime mud, and ooze. Sediments are not rocks, but they may become rocks through heating, compaction, and cementation. Sediments are discussed in Chapter 10.\n\nSedimentary rocks are rocks that have formed over time through the deposition and solidification of sediment, especially sediment transported by water (rivers, lakes, and oceans), ice ( glaciers), and wind (Figure 3-8). Sedimentary rocks are often deposited in layers, and frequently contain fossils. Sedimentary rocks are often deposited in layers, and frequently contain fossils. Examples of sedimentary rocks include shale, sandstone, conglomerate, limestone, and chert. Sedimentary rocks are discussed in Chapter 11.\n\nMetamorphic rocks are rocks that was once one form of rock but has changed to another under the influence of heat, pressure, or fluids without passing through a liquid phase (melting) (Figure 3-9). Examples of metamorphic rocks include slate, schist, gneiss, marble, quartzite, and serpentinite. Metamorphic rocks are discussed in Chapter 12.\n\nThese rock cycle diagrams illustrate how earth materials form and change over time. Both products (rocks and sediments) and processes (such as melting, cooling, erosion, and deposition) are illustrated. The passage of geologic time is an essential component, although some processes are much faster than others. Note that all these types of processes are taking place simultaneously, but at different locations on and within the planet.\n\nFig. 3-3. The Rock Cycle: processes are in purple; products are in black and blue.\n\nWhat is a rock formation?\n\nGeologists who study and map the location of rocks in a region will assign them names and will described them by their composition and their geologic ages (if possible). A rock formation is a rock unit that is distinctive enough in appearance that a geologist can distinguish it from other surrounding rock layers. A named rock formation must also be thick enough and extensive enough to plot on a geologic map. Rock formations and geologic maps are a discussed in more detail below. Typically rock formations are named after a geographic feature or area associated with where a rock formation is exposed. for instance, the Kaibab Formation is named after the Kaibab Plateau where it crops out extensively. The name of the rock formation may also contain the name of it's dominant rock type, such as the Torrey Pines Sandstone Formation, a massive sandstone deposit of Eocene age that crops out in the sea cliffs at Torrey Pines State Beach Preserve in San Diego County, California.\n\nLayered Versus Non-Layered Rocks\n\nLarge bodies of rocks typically display recognizable characteristics, most notable are characteristics of rock layersâcalled strata. Strata are layered rocks that are typically formed when an accumulation of rock material is deposited in a setting, then as time passes more layers accumulate on top. If cut and exposed by erosion or faulting, the layers appear as a series of beds. (A single bed is called a stratum). Rocks that display layering are called stratified; rocks that do not display obvious layering are called unstratified (Figures 3-15 to 3-18).\n\nSome rocks are layered (or stratified), others are not. Sedimentary rocks and some volcanic deposits (lava flows and air-fall volcanic ash deposits) are examples of commonly stratified rocks. Examples of rocks that are unstratified are igneous rocks (like granite) that cooled and crystallized deep underground and did not develop layers. Also, rocks that have experienced extensive metamorphism and remelting may no longer preserve stratification. (As always, in geology, and science in general, there are sometimes exceptions to these rules!)\n\nBasic Geologic Principles\n\nIn 1669, Nicolas Steno first proposed several basic geologic principles that were later embellished by notable Scottish geologists, James Hutton and Charles Lyell (introduced in Chapter 1). These basic principles are easily observed in geologic outcrops bearing layered rocks (strata), but have value for any number of scientific and technical applications beyond geology. Figure 3-20 illustrates basic geologic principles for Steno's three laws that are used in resolving the relative age of rocks and the order in which they formed or as geologic events occurred.\n\nSteno's three laws are as follows:\n\nLaw of Original Horizontalityâthis law states that most sediments, when originally deposited, were laid down horizontally. However, many layered rocks are no longer horizontalâfaulting and tectonic forces, and volcanic activity can deform rock layers\n\nLaw of Superpositionâthis law states that in any undisturbed sequence of rocks deposited in layers, the youngest layer is on top and the oldest on bottom, each layer being younger than the one beneath it and older than the one above it.\n\nLaw of Cross-Cutting Relationshipsâthis law states that a body of igneous rock (an intrusion), a fault, or other geologic feature must be younger than any rock across which it cuts through.\n\nNote that the boxes in Figure 3-19 illustrate vertical cross sections of what may exist below the surface. Cross sections are discussed more below.\n\nFig. 3-20. Basic geologic principles illustrated. The four boxes represent vertical profiles below the ground surface, or a view such as may appear in a cliff on the side of a mountain or canyon.\n\nUnconformities: Gaps In the Geologic Record\n\nFollowing on the Law of Original Horizontality and Law of Superposition, both Hutton and Lyell recognized erosional boundaries preserved between rock layers representing gaps in the geologic record. They named these gaps unconformities (examples in Figure 3-21). An unconformity is a surface between successive strata that represents a missing interval in the geologic record of time. Unconformities show evidence that the Earth's surface may have been exposed to erosion for periods of time. Unconformities are produced either by an interruption in deposition or by the erosion of per-existing strata followed by renewed deposition. Note that unconformities can be complex. For example, may erosion may be taking place in one location in geologic time, where nearby or elsewhere sediments may have continued to be deposited and preserved. As a result, an unconformity in one location may span a different about of time in another location.\n\nSeveral types of unconformity boundaries are recognized:\n\nnonconformityâan unconformity between sedimentary rocks and metamorphic or igneous rocks when the sedimentary rock lies above and was deposited on the pre-existing and eroded metamorphic or igneous rock\n\n.\n\nangular unconformityâan unconformity where horizontally parallel strata of sedimentary rock are deposited on tilted and eroded layers, producing an angular discordance with the overlying horizontal layers\n\n.\n\ndisconformityâan unconformity between parallel layers of sedimentary rocks which represents a period of erosion or non-deposition.\n\nconformable boundaryâan arrangement where layers of sedimentary strata are parallel, but there is little apparent erosion and the boundary between two rock layer surfaces resemble a simple bedding plane. There is typically little evidence to support a significant passage of time occurred at a conformable boundary.\n\nFig. 3-21. Types of unconformities (boundaries between layered rocks representing \"gaps\" in the geologic record in a locality). The four boxes represent vertical profiles below the ground surface, or a view such as may appear in a cliff on the side of a mountain or canyon.\n\nHow Do Unconformities Form?\n\nUnconformities are caused by relative changes in sea level over time. Wave erosion wears away materials exposed along coastlines, scouring surfaces smooth. On scales of thousands to millions of years, shorelines may move across entire regions. Erosion strips away materials exposed to waves and currents. New (younger) material can be deposited on the scoured surface. Shallow seas may flood in and then withdrawal repeatedly. Long-lasting transgressions can erode away entire mountain ranges with enough time.\n\nA transgression occurs when a shoreline migrates landward as sea level (or lake level) rises.\n\nA regression occurs when a shoreline migrates seaward as sea level (or lake level) falls (Figure 3-26).\n\nSea level changes may be caused by region uplift or global changes in sea level, such at the formation or melting of continental glaciers. Whatever the cause of sea level change, when sea level falls, sediments are eroded from exposed land. When sea level rises, sediments are typically deposited in quiet water settings, such as on shallow continental shelves or in low, swampy areas on coastal plains.\n\nSome unconformities represent great gaps in time. For example, the Great Unconformity in the lower Grand Canyon illustrates where a great mountain range existed in the region during Precambrian before erosion completely stripped the landscape away back down, eventually allowing seas to flood over the region again in Cambrian time. The \"gap in the geologic record\" in some locations along the Great Unconformity represents billions of years (see Figure 3-21).\n\nFigure 3-26. Unconformities can form by the rise and fall of sea level. Erosion strips away materials exposed to waves and currents. A rise in sea level causes a transgression which creates space underwater for sediments to be deposited. New (younger) material is deposited on the scoured surface. When sea level falls it causes a regression, and sediments are not deposited or are eroded away.\n\nHow are the ages of rocks determined?\n\nGeochronology is the branch of earth sciences concerned with determining the age of earth materials and events through geologic time.\n\nHow do geoscientists determine the age of rocks or fossils? How do they figure out how long ago and in what order did geologic processes or events take place? For instance how do they know how often a volcano erupts or how often earthquakes take place? Geologists now have many ways to determine the age of materials using relative dating and absolute dating methods.\n\nRelative Dating\n\nRelative dating is the science of determining the relative order of past events, without necessarily determining their absolute age (see below). Relative dating involved the study of fossils and the correlation or comparison of fossils of similar ages but from different regions where their age is known. Microfossils derived from sediments and cores from wells help in the subsurface exploration for oil and gas.\n\nWhen studying an area where layered rocks are exposed, the Law of Original Horizontality dictates that the sedimentary layers were originally deposited as flat layers. The Law of Superposition dictates that if a series of rock layers are exposed, the oldest are on the bottom of the stack. That is true, unless the sequence of rock layers have been disturbed by some later geologic even. It that case, the Law of Cross-Cutting Relationships dictates that the rocks will be older than the forces that later changed them. Examples of forces that change landscapes include movement of faults, or the tectonic folding of rock layers, or an intrusion of igneous material, such as the formation of a volcano.\n\nExample! Use these rules to interpret this general vertical cross section of a landscape (Figure 3-27). The diagram could represent a road cut along a highway or a wall on the side of a canyon. The Law of Original Horizontality and Law of Superposition suggest that layer C (layers of shale) was deposited before layer B (beds of limestone), which was deposited before layer A (beds of sandstone). The Law of Cross-Cutting Relationships dictates that next thing to happen was that feature D (an igneous intrusion) cut across the sedimentary layers. After that a fault (feature E) broke through all the older materials. The final thing to happen was erosion of the landscape down to partially expose some of the features on the surface. Note also that the boundaries between layers C and B, and A and B may represent unconformities (possible gaps in time).\n\nRelative dating only can be used to sort the exposed visible features in the order that they formed (example in Figure 3-28).\n\nFossils and Relative Dating\n\nSedimentary rock layers of different ages often look very similar. Conversely, sedimentary rock layers of similar ages may appear very different in other locations. Sometimes fossils preserved in sedimentary layers are very useful for correlating rock layers from one area or region to another. Paleontologists have extensively studied fossil found in sedimentary rock formation of all geologic ages around the world. Certain \"index fossils\" are both abundant and widely distributed through sedimentary rocks of relatively limited geologic time ranges.\n\nUnfortunately, many rocks formation do not contain fossils, or the fossils they may contain are very rare or poorly preserved. Metamorphic and igneous rocks do not contain fossils. In many cases, the exact age of each of the rock units is unknown until it can be confirmed by other means involving absolute dating methods (discussed below).\n\nFig. 3-27. Applying basic geologic principles: Laws of Original Horizontality, Superposition, and Cross-Cutting Relationships explain the order of this diagram with the order of formation: rock units C, B, A, D, then E (followed by surface erosion).\n\nFig. 3-28. Rock layers like these in Utah record information about 100 million years of Earth history exposed in the region. These rocks were originally deposited horizontally but then were later folded upward: oldest rocks on the right; youngest on exposed on the mesa top on the left. In Figure 3-31, the Laws of Original Horizontality and Superposition show a series of sedimentary layers and volcanic ash bed deposited from oldest (on the bottom) to a lava flow (on the top of the cliff). The Law of Cross-Cutting Relationships shows that the layers were offset by faulting after they were deposited as layers.\n\nIn Figure 3-32. the Laws of Original Horizontality and Superposition indicate that this series of sedimentary layers were deposited horizontally before tectonic forces pushed up these layers located near to the San Andreas Fault. Therefore, the San Andreas Fault must be younger than the sedimentary layers.\n\nIn Figure 3-33, the Law of Cross-Cutting Relationships suggests that the fault in the picture is younger than the sedimentary rock formation on either side of the fault. However, the age of the two rock formation on either side would have to be determined by some other means (such as by the fossils they may contain).\n\nIn Figure 3-34, the Law of Cross-Cutting Relationships suggest that the dark, basalt igneous dike is younger than the pink volcanic rocks on either side, however, the exact age of the volcanic rocks would have to be determined by other means.\n\nAbsolute Dating Methods\n\nAbsolute dating is a general term applied to a range of techniques that provide estimates of the age of objects, materials, or sites in real calendar years either directly or through a process of calibration with material of known age. There are many methods of absolute dating rocks or other ancient materials. The methods of absolute dating used depends on whether suitable sample are available for testing.\n\nOne variety of absolute dating methods involves the study of the decay of radioactive isotopes. The original isotope is the \"parent\" which through radioactive decay becomes the \"daughter\" isotope. Commonly referenced studies of absolute dating utilize the radioactive decay of 238U (unstable uranium isotope) into 206PB (stable lead isotope); or 40K (unstable potassium isotope) into 40Ar (stable argon isotope). Note that here are many other absolute dating methods. Perhaps most important is radiocarbon dating which utilizes the decay of 14C (unstable carbon isotope) into 14N (stable nitrogen isotope). Dating of materials that contain naturally-occurring radionuclides (radioactive isotopes) is possible because the rate of decay of the radionuclides are known. The radiation decay \"clock\" starts the moment a mineral in a rock forms (or for 14C when an organism dies).\n\nFigure 3-46 shows information about several absolute dating methods. Each method uses different parent/daughter isotopes. Each method has a suitable age dating range and materials that can be dated (such as minerals, shells, organic mater, etc.). It is important to note that today there are dozens of other absolute dating methods using a variety of technological innovations. A half-life is when only half of a parent radionuclide remains. The next half-life is when only a quarter of the original parent radionuclide remains, and so on. Age determinations can be determined by comparing the percentage of the radionuclides in a new \"fresh\" sample with the percentage in the old sample material being tested. Fig. 3-46. Absolute dating methods. Different isotopes are used to study different materials and geologic time ranges. This diagram illustrates the concept of half lives of decaying radioactive elements commonly used in many absolute dating methods.\n\nTopography and Bathymetry\n\nMany maps include information about the elevation differences on maps such feature as mountains, canyons, hills, shorelines, etc.\n\nâ Topography refers to the arrangement of the natural and artificial physical features of an area.\n\nâ Bathymetry refers to the measurement or mapping of water depth (sea bed) beneath oceans, lakes, or other bodies of water.\n\nRelief is the variation in elevation on the surface of the Earth (topography). Areas of \"high relief\" have much elevation changes over distance, such as mountainous areas and canyons. \"Low relief\" occurs where elevation changes are minimal, such as on coastal plains (Figure 3-65).\n\nOn maps, both topography and bathymetry are described as elevations relative the mean sea level in a region. Sea level is reported as 0 (zero) feet, meters, or fathoms (a fathom is 6 feet of water depth).\n\nBoth topography and bathymetry can graphically illustrated with shaded relief or with contour lines. A shaded-relief map uses gray-scale shading giving the appearance of relief similar to sun shading (the way sunlights highlights a natural landscapeâsomething that our brain automatically understands and processes!). A shaded-relief map can be used to illustrate both topography and bathymetry (Figure 3-66).\n\nContour lines are another way to illustrate relief. Contour lines follow points of equal elevation and are spaced at uniform distances apart on a map. Examples of contour intervals might be 10 or 40 feet (or meters), depending on how much relief is in a map area. For example, contour lines can be illustrated by lines drawn on a stack of clear plastic box lids (Figure 3-67). Each lid represents a separate contourâa line of equal elevation.\n\nA topographic map is a graphical representation of a landscape showing selected natural and artificial landscape features including topographic relief. A topographic map shows many features including relief (contours) and man-made features of a portion of a land surface distinguished by portrayal of position, relation, size, shape, and elevation of the features (see example in Figure 3-68). The US Geological Survey produced topographic maps on many scales from the late 19th Century to the end of the 20th Century. Now, nearly all information is now in digital data provided by satellite information and other sources (discussed below).\n\nA map of the bathymetry of the ocean floor or large lake is called a chart.\n\nFig. 3-65. A region of high relief is illustrated by this mountainous mountain face on San Jacinto Peak near Palm Springs, California. The alluvial fan in the valley below the peak is a region of low relief.\n\nFig. 3-67. Contours lines are lines that show levels of equal elevation. This figure illustrates contour lines drawn on on a series of a stack of six clear plastic box lids. Each lid has a separate contour line. This visually recreates three dimensional relief model as represented by contour lines on a topographic map. See examples of contour maps used to create similar examples of stacked box lids.\n\nFig. 3-66. A shaded relief map of the central coast of California including Monterey Bay and San Francisco, CA. Both topography (on land) and bathymetry (undersea) are shown.\n\nFig. 3-68. Example of a USGS topographic map: Chittenden, CA 7.5 minute quadrangle.\n\nThis map is an example of a map that the US Geological Survey produce for the United State for over 100 years before our modern map technology."
