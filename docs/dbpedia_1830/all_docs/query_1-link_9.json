        "meta_description": "On 18 June 1812, the United States formally declared war on Great Britain due to that nation’s continued attempts to restrict trade on the high seas, the Royal Navy’s impressment of American seamen, and the United States’ desire to expand territory. During the War of 1812, fighting on land and at sea took place in several theaters of operations to include the Old Northwest (Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Upper Canada), along the river corridors of the Niagara, St. Lawrence, and Lake Champlain-Richelieu, along coastal Maine, in the Chesapeake Bay, on the Gulf Coast, and on the high seas. In the first several years of the war, in contrast to the setbacks experienced by U.S. land forces, the American Navy secured notable victories in the Atlantic and on the Great Lakes, while Britain was forced to concentrate its efforts on the ongoing war with France. However, when French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte’s armies were defeated in April 1814, Britain turned its full attention on the United States. On 24 August 1814, after defeating American forces at the Battle of Bladensburg, British troops marched into Washington, DC. There, they set multiple government buildings, include the Capitol and the White House, on fire. Commodore Thomas Tingey, commandant of the Washington Navy Yard, saw smoke rising from the Capitol and ordered the strategically valuable yard burned to prevent it from falling into enemy hands. Although, a U.S. Navy squadron soundly defeated a British flotilla on Lake Champlain during the 6–10 September Battle of Plattsburgh, New York, America’s fortunes remained uncertain as the British set their sights on the vital seaport of Baltimore, Maryland—the third-largest American city at the time. On 13 September 1814, British warships began a 25-hour bombardment of Fort McHenry. However, facing determined U.S. resistance, British warships began withdrawing from the Chesapeake Bay on the following day. Meanwhile, peace talks, originally started that August, continued at Ghent (modern-day Belgium). On 24 December 1814, the Treaty of Ghent was signed by delegates from both countries and was ratified by the U.S. Senate in February 1815. Neither Great Britain nor the United States lost any territory or surrendered any rights. Indigenous nations, many of which had sided with the British, were unable to recover any lost territories and continued to face additional loss of land to settlers expanding westward. The British made no concessions on maritime issues and retained Canada. However, the United States vindicated its sovereignty and earned international respect for having fought the powerful British Empire to a strategic draw. As word of the treaty was slow to reach North America, several land battles (notably the Battle of New Orleans in January) took place after the treaty had been signed. The war’s last naval engagement (the capture of a British merchant vessel by sloop-of-war USS Peacock off Java) occurred as late as 30 June. *****",
