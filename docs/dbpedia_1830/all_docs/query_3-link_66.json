        "text": "The Village of Fonda is seeking “member’ funding from Congresswoman Stefanik for critical and important projects within the Village, and we need your help!\n\nOur deadline for submitting your support letters is short and must be submitted Wednesday, March 14, 2024.\n\nIf you wish to complete one or all of the letters of support, please click on each project below to download the template and email your completed letters to: villageclerk@villageoffonda.ny.gov.\n\nPlease view letter from the Mayor Here\n\nWaste Treatment Facility\n\nThe Fonda-Fultonville Joint Wastewater Treatment Plant (FFJWWTP), which serves critical needs for the Villages of Fonda, Town of Mohawk, Fultonville, and Town of Glen users (taxpayers), faces significant challenges requiring immediate attention.\n\nThe challenges facing the wastewater treatment facility, including non-functioning flow meters, lack of preliminary treatment leading to frequent clogging of RAS pumps, and the aging deterioration of various process equipment, pose significant threats not only to the critical water sanitization services provided to users in the four communities served but also to the protection of our invaluable natural resources, such as the Mohawk River.\n\nThe FFJWWTP has engaged engineering firms to address the conditions of the WWTP for over a decade. This resulted in the FFJWWTP conducting improvements to the WWTP in the past, with the most recent one being completed in 2020, wherein one of the secondary clarifiers’ internal components was entirely rehabilitated. However, additional improvements are necessary mainly due to the lack of preliminary treatment, causing heavy solid loading and damage to solids handling equipment such as the RAS pumps.\n\nReservoir Improvements\n\nThe Fonda Reservoir Dam (ID#173-4050) stands as a critical infrastructure across a tributary to Briggs Run within the confines of the Town of Mohawk, Montgomery County, New York. Positioned at Latitude N42°56’19”, Longitude W74°27’18” on the Randall Quadrangle, its significance is underscored by its classification as a Class “B” or “Medium Hazard” dam.\n\nThe Fonda Reservoir supplies water to the Town of Mohawk and the Village of Fonda. It is also a vital resource for various entities, including the Keymark Corporation, the largest employer in the Town of Mohawk, Montgomery County Government (Second Largest Employer), and the 1,314 students of the Fonda-Fultonville Central School District (Third Largest Employer). As a spring-fed reservoir, it is the sole water source for these communities, lacking any backup or redundancy measures.\n\nAccording to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) Guidelines for Dam Design, a Class “B” dam is characterized by its potential to cause substantial damage in the event of failure, including the disruption of vital public utilities and infrastructure such as homes, highways, and minor railroads.\n\nIn adherence to Title 6 of New York Rules and Regulations, Part 673.13, an Engineering Assessment Report is mandated for such structures, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation of the dam’s integrity and safety measures. This imperative led the Village of Fonda (Village) to enlist the expertise of PRIME AE Group of NY (PRIME AE) for meticulously examining and assessing the Fonda Reservoir Dam.\n\nThe resultant Engineering Assessment Report delves into various facets of the dam’s condition and functionality, encompassing a thorough background analysis, a comprehensive review of pertinent dam-related documentation, an evaluation of hazard classification, meticulous safety inspections, capacity assessments for spillways and low-level outlets, structural stability evaluations, and culminating in a set of informed findings, conclusions, and recommendations to ensure the continued security and reliability of the dam.\n\nThe Village of Fonda has dedicated substantial financial resources to enhance water transmission systems serving our communities, including local investments and funding from multiple sources. This investment includes projects like the construction of the water storage tower at the Fonda-Fultonville Central School and recent upgrades to water filtration systems at the reservoir.\n\nDespite these efforts, the Village faces challenges in funding the maintenance and repair of the reservoir. As a result, the Village has been diligent in maintaining critical water supply infrastructure using available revenue. However, due to limited funding, the integrity of our water reservoir has declined to unacceptable levels.\n\nFlood Mitigation\n\nThe Village of Fonda, situated in Montgomery County, New York, is home to Broadway Creek, formerly known as the “Unnamed Creek.” This vital watershed traverses the community from the North (Fulton County) to the South (Mohawk River). Comprising a combination of open channels and underground culvert pipes, this waterway plays a crucial role in draining southerly into the Cayadutta Creek and, ultimately, the Mohawk River.\n\nHowever, the history of Broadway Creek is fraught with challenges, particularly concerning flooding events that have plagued the area, notably along Broadway (NYS Route 30A). The creek’s propensity for inundation has been demonstrated through significant flood events, including June 28, 2006, August 29, 2011, and August 21, 2014, with historical records tracing such occurrences back to the early 1900s. The most recent major flooding event, transpiring on July 19, 2021, inflicted substantial damage to local infrastructure and properties, rendering Broadway (Street) and Main Street impassable and necessitating extensive cleanup efforts.\n\nNYS Route 30A holds significant importance to commerce in upstate New York, serving as a vital artery for transportation and economic activity within the region. As a major state route, it facilitates the movement of goods, services, and people, connecting the region to other key destinations within and outside New York State.\n\nIn response to these recurrent challenges, the Village of Fonda has taken proactive measures by engaging contract engineers to conduct a comprehensive preliminary engineering assessment and hydraulic modeling of Broadway Creek. The resulting Engineering Assessment Report presents a thorough analysis encompassing background information, hydraulic modeling, findings, and proposed alternatives for flood mitigation.\n\nThe scope of this assessment, as directed by the Village Board, focused specifically on the section of Broadway Creek within the Village Boundary. It aimed to address immediate concerns and prioritize mitigation efforts where they are most urgently needed.\n\nThe urgency for flood mitigation funding is underscored by the severity of the events, such as the July 19, 2021, rainfall event, where approximately 3.29 inches of rainfall within a span of two and a half hours triggered flash flooding along Broadway (Street) and Main Street. The aftermath of this event necessitated extensive cleanup efforts, including the removal of sediment and debris deposited within the Village, highlighting the immediate need for comprehensive flood mitigation measures.\n\nIn light of these challenges, the Village of Fonda seeks support and funding to implement strategic flood mitigation initiatives outlined in the Engineering Assessment Report. By investing in proactive measures to address Broadway Creek’s vulnerabilities, we can enhance our community’s resilience, protect valuable infrastructure, and safeguard the well-being of our residents and businesses against future flood events.\n\nWaterfront Revitalization\n\nIn 2008, the visionary concept of the Fonda Canalside and Recreational Park was born, marking the beginning of a journey to create a vibrant hub for our community and visitors alike. We have made significant strides in bringing this dream to life thanks to initial funding for conceptual planning.\n\nSituated adjacent to the renowned Montgomery County Agricultural Society Fair Grounds (Fonda Fair) and the historical Fonda Speedway, our park is a prime central attraction for locals and tourists. The Fonda Fair is the most significant draw for visitors to Fonda and Montgomery County, making our park a natural extension of this bustling cultural landscape.\n\nMoreover, our commitment to community engagement is unwavering. Non-profit organizations regularly utilize our park facilities for many purposes, from hosting community events and fundraisers to conducting outreach programs that enrich the lives of residents and visitors alike.\n\nHowever, our work is far from complete. Key elements of our park concept remain partially funded or unfunded, including crucial additions:\n\nCurrent Phase:\n\nBoat Docks.\n\nPaving of the Boat Launch Parking area and Pedestrian Pathways.\n\nLighting Installation for the Waterfront.\n\nWi-Fi Expansion.\n\nSecurity Camera System for the Protection of our Community Investments.\n\nVisitor Center with Digital Kiosk.\n\nA Children’s Splash Park.\n\nPicnic, Pavilion, and Community Event Spaces.\n\nGreen Space Improvement – Grass Seeding and Tree Planting\n\nLaundry Room Appliances.\n\nFood Vendor Space Appliances.\n\nA Central Heating System for the Restroom Facilities that allows for Winter Activities.\n\nNext Phase:\n\nBicycle Rentals Kiosk, Campground Facilities, and the eagerly anticipated ice-skating rink with refrigeration – a beacon of winter activity for our community.\n\nSafe Sidewalk to the Fonda-Fultonville School\n\nThere is a pressing need for sidewalk construction within the Village of Fonda. This proposed project aims to enhance pedestrian and cyclist accessibility to the Fonda-Fultonville Central School, which serves a significant population of over 1,300 students in the region.\n\nThe primary focus of this endeavor is to extend the existing pedestrian sidewalk along Cemetery Street, effectively connecting Main Street and other auxiliary streets in Fonda with the neighboring Village of Fultonville. The completion of this sidewalk infrastructure is crucial for facilitating safe and efficient commuting for students and visitors alike.\n\nThe safety of pedestrians utilizing the route along Cemetery Street to access the school has been a persistent concern. Recent developments, such as the closure of Switzer Hill Road in the Town of Mohawk, have exacerbated these safety apprehensions due to increased motorized traffic and related incidents on Cemetery Street.\n\nIn response to these challenges, the Village of Fonda, in collaboration with Montgomery County, NY, has devised a preliminary plan to address these issues comprehensively. This plan includes the construction of a new sidewalk addition through property owned by the Village of Fonda and repairing or replacing existing sidewalk segments.\n\nThe proposed sidewalk construction project represents a proactive step towards enhancing pedestrian safety and accessibility within the Village of Fonda. By providing a dedicated pathway for foot and bicycle traffic, we aim to foster a safer and more sustainable transportation environment for our community members.\n\nEnhancements will include surface structures, stormwater runoffs, pedestrian roadway lighting, fencing, guardrails, and protection of historic spaces."
