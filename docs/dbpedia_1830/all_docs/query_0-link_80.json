Itineraries in French Renaissance Literature Kendall Tarte, George Hoffmann, and Jeff Persels Sixteenth-century French literature invites the contemplation and exploration of itineraries. Michel de Montaigne’s Journal de voyage records the essayist’s journey from France to Germany, Switzerland, and Italy. François Rabelais’s Pantagruel, Panurge, and company travel far and wide in an extraordinary fictional world. In the prologue to the Heptaméron, Marguerite de Navarre’s collection of tales, the geographical peregrinations of the ten storytellers leading to Notre-Dame-de-Sarrance set the stage for the eight days of shared storytelling that would follow, which themselves map contemporary mores. The Americas were the locus of the voyages of exploration narrated and embroidered in the works of travel writers such as Jacques Cartier, André Thevet, and Samuel de Champlain. Tacking to the contradictory winds of religious change constituted an entirely new form of personal and collective itinerary, one that would exploit and expand the new printing technologies in ways that forever changed the confessional—and political—map of Europe. And humanist inquiry created new routes for the dissemination of knowledge. An itinerary is a course of travel, the route of a journey; it is also the account of such a journey. Renaissance books recorded actual and imaginary travels in itineraries of landscapes both familiar and unknown. The theme of literary itineraries also has rich metaphorical potential. The lines of inspiration connecting Renaissance and ancient authors, the transformations of language, the emergence of new kinds of writing and new kinds of writers—these and other essential characteristics of this period encourage us to trace the itineraries of literature itself. The theme of itineraries, broadly defined, is an apt one for the present volume in honor of Professor Mary B. McKinley. Mary’s scholarship throughout her career has explored metaphorical and actual itineraries. The present work celebrates her scholarship by collecting a broad spectrum of essays that grapple in a variety of ways with the theme of itineraries in sixteenthcentury French literature. Visual images of the Renaissance created itineraries of exploration and imagination. The series of elaborately decorated maps that Scott Juall examines produces an itinerary of ideal, rather than real, imperial expansion. The Italian humanist Gabriele Simeoni adopted and adapted the popular genre of travel literature to recount his travels in Italy, yet as Karen Simroth James © koninklijke brill nv, leiden, ���8 | doi ��.��63/9789004351516_002\n\n2\n\nTarte, Hoffmann and Persels\n\nshows, the resulting text and accompanying images rely as much on invention as on actual observation. The figures drawn by Sir Thomas Smith in his copy of the Heptaméron, which Kendall Tarte considers, complement the work’s narrative itinerary and mimic the images found on contemporary maps. Beyond the physical journeys recounted in its prologue, the Heptaméron evokes other itineraries within and beyond its pages. The book’s frame structure—the alternation between the discussions among the devisants and the tales they tell—leads the reader on a narrative itinerary that pointedly resembles that of Boccaccio’s Decameron. The studies of three contributors to this volume show new itineraries in the analysis and reception of the Heptaméron. In his close reading of one frame discussion, Gary Ferguson offers a fresh perspective on women’s sexual agency in Marguerite’s book. Bernd Renner looks to the genre of satire as the basis for his innovative reconsideration of the nouvelle collection. Cynthia Skenazi analyzes a little-known nineteenthcentury play based on the Heptaméron, tracing, as it were, its afterlife. The reception among recent scholars of the work of another author, Louise Labé, creates a complex critical itinerary that Leah Chang navigates in her contribution, which revisits key questions about female authorship in the Renaissance. Kathleen Long forges a route for Michel de Montaigne’s Essais that extends through nineteenth-century treatises on hermaphrodites to presentday work in the field of disability studies. Complementing these studies of the paths that link the sixteenth and twenty-first centuries, other contributors examine the strategies that Renaissance authors used to create itineraries connecting their work to the past. Virginia Krause follows the trail of the figure of Dido in Virgil, Ovid, and Augustine to propose an innovative interpretation of the Angoysses douloureuses. Dido also figures prominently in Edwin Duval’s essay, which follows her path from Virgil and Petrarch to Maurice Scève, along the way provocatively turning on its head the way we read gendered lyric. Cara Welch scrutinizes Montaigne’s complex portrait of the figure of the Athenian statesman and general Alcibiades, whose multivalent example helps shape the essays and Montaigne’s connection to the omnipresent and omnipotent classical past. As Stephen Murphy shows, the first-century historian Josephus provided Agrippa d’Aubigné with models for depicting history and for acting in it. Nicolas Russell focuses on Clément Marot’s edition of the works of the fifteenth-century poet François Villon, as well as on editions of Marot’s own poetry, in his study of the Marot’s stance on the preservation of cultural memory. The transmission and transformation of different forms of knowledge in the Renaissance also create itineraries. Both Nicholas Shangler and Robert Hudson work against the typical narrative itinerary that describes the vernacularization of French in the sixteenth century in triumphant terms. In his study\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nof Marot’s use of the rondeau form, Hudson demonstrates how this narrative unfairly discredits the pre-Pléiade poet. Shangler’s examination of linguistic misunderstandings in Des Périers’s Nouvelles Récréations reveals the comic potential of the French language at this moment of change. In her study of Guillaume Rondelet’s monkfish, Pascale Barthe shows the complex social networks through which the diffusion of scientific knowledge in the Renaissance took place. The religious conflicts in sixteenth-century France signaled the breakdown of networks and the instability of the route towards salvation. Cathy Yandell assesses the rhetoric of Pierre de Ronsard and Michel de L’Hospital at a key moment in this itinerary, on the eve of the outbreak of the first of eight wars. Through analysis of a peculiar polemical work on tonsure printed at the same moment, Jeff Persels shows how even the contours of crown and facial hair could mark the right road to salvation. The case of one “serial convert,” Hugues Sureau du Rosier, provides the focus for George Hoffmann’s study of shifting confessional identities. Corinne Noirot considers the various audiences addressed by Jean de la Taille in two pamphlets on divination, which provide one answer to the question of how to navigate the uncertainty of the religious conflicts. Perhaps no Renaissance author shows the potential—and the potential variety—of itineraries like Michel de Montaigne. Mary McKinley’s work on Montaigne concentrates on this variety. In her first book, Words in a Corner: Studies in Montaigne’s Latin Quotations, she follows the intersections of text and intertext in her study of Montaigne’s use of quotations from Ovid, Horace, and Virgil in his Essais.1 The spatial metaphor that Montaigne uses in “De la vanité” (III, 9) to refer to clues he leaves in the text to help the reader follow his subject—a word in a corner—provides an image for Mary’s own study of Latin quotations in the Essais. The metaphors that establish Montaigne’s book itself as a route or a journey inspire Mary’s second book on Montaigne, Les Terrains vagues des Essais: Itinéraires et intertextes.2 There, the crucial itinerary is through Montaigne’s landscape of the mind. As she notes, “[Montaigne] invites us to consider his progress towards knowledge as an itinerary that he delineates by spatial metaphors, landscape metaphors” (10). [“Il nous invite à\n\n1 Words in a Corner: Studies in Montaigne’s Latin Quotations. Lexington, KY: French Forum, 1981. 2 Mary B. McKinley, Les Terrains vagues des Essais: Itinéraires et intertextes (Paris: Honoré Champion, 1996).\n\n4\n\nTarte, Hoffmann and Persels\n\nenvisager son progrès vers la connaissance comme un itinéraire qu’il balise par des métaphores spatiales, métaphores paysagistes.”] In her wide-ranging work on Marguerite de Navarre, Mary has often focused on the situation of sixteenth-century women.3 She has traced the appearances of Marguerite as a character in the Heptaméron, constructing an itinerary of authorial self-representation through the seventy-two tales.4 Mary’s own itinerary as a scholar has moved among canonical Renaissance authors— especially Marguerite de Navarre and Montaigne—and those less well known. In particular, her work on Marie Dentière brought to a wide readership this singular female voice from Reformation Geneva.5 Mary has also ventured outside of these main areas of focus to explore other topics, writers, and domains. A particularly moving example treats a group of wooden sculptures of sibyls in the choir stalls of the cathedral in the village of Saint-Bertrand de Comminges in the Pyrenees.6 This article not only elegantly analyzes the sculptures and sets them in their historical context, but also conveys Mary’s longtime fascination with—one might even say affection for—these works of art. This volume is grounded in our own affection for Mary McKinley. Its genesis is a series of presentations in her honor at two conferences: the 2013 Sixteenth Century Studies Conference in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and the 2014 University of Virginia Department of French Müller Colloquium, entitled Renaissance Itineraries. The authors of the essays in this collection—younger and established scholars of the French Renaissance, Mary’s colleagues from across the United States, her former students—are, above all, her friends. This volume honors Mary McKinley’s career as a scholar, teacher, and mentor to all of those whose itineraries in the field of French Renaissance studies she has influenced and inspired. The five groups of essays that follow take up many of the themes and authors that Mary has examined in her scholarship and explored with 3 Most notable are her two co-edited volumes, with John D.

More broadly, they aim to pay tribute to her sharp analytical mind and to her generous spirit.\n\nOn Telling Tales\n\nIn “Puns, Exemplarity, and Women’s Sexual Agency: Nomerfide and Oisille, Heptaméron 5 and 6,” Gary Ferguson offers a fine-grained close reading of tales five and six that teases out the importance of what, at first glance, might seem like one of the younger and less important devisants. Examining in particular the biting exchange between Oisille and Nomerfide, Ferguson avoids polarizing the oldest and the youngest female participants, as earlier critics have done. Instead, he uses this moment to redefine the kind of community that obtains among the women storytellers. In doing so, his aim is to chart a prudent middle course between traditional readings that see women as subordinate, and more recent ones that have tried to highlight moments of transgression in early modern depictions of women such as Nomerfide. What emerges is a vision of limited but real agency in which women must carefully weigh their choices and act with discretion. The upshot is one of a clear-eyed Marguerite who recognizes the confines within which women of her time had to move, but who also recognizes the range of desires women can enjoy. Cynthia Skenazi’s “A Palimpsest of the Heptaméron: Eugène Scribe’s Les Contes de la reine de Navarre ou La Revanche de Pavie” unearths a wonderfully anachronistic nineteenth-century dramatic adaptation of the Heptaméron that mixes in one of the most important events from Marguerite’s own younger life: her negotiation for the liberation of François Ier, captive in Madrid following the French defeat in Pavia. The play coincides with a critical moment in the reception of Marguerite’s work, when a fledgling, mid-century national literary history took notice of her, thanks to her illustrious standing, and began the long process of admitting her work into the French canon. However slight it may seem today, this play decisively influenced how Marguerite’s work would be read for generations. In particular, this study argues that the play acted to suggest that, like the play itself, the Heptaméron was essentially comedic and “light.” Skenazi carefully weighs Scribe’s omissions and instances of faithfulness to sources, compares his work to Victor Hugo’s recent plays, and probes for reactions to the contemporary political climate in France. She shows how nineteenth-century imaginings of court life merge here into a théâtre de boulevard, or even a soap opera, in which amorous intrigues take the place of other concerns. In particular, Scribe overlooks the preoccupation that probably stood as most important to Marguerite herself: religion. Barely mentioned\n\n6\n\nTarte, Hoffmann and Persels\n\nin the play, only to be shifted back into a political question more germane to Scribe’s time than Marguerite’s, religion is conspicuously absent in this portrayal of Marguerite and her work. In “Readers Writing in the Gordon Collection Heptaméron,” Kendall Tarte evokes the rich analogue world of an original, hand-annotated edition in order to highlight the importance of the Douglas H. Gordon Collection at the University of Virginia Library. This essay focuses on one of the most interesting volumes of that collection, the 1560 Gruget edition of the Heptaméron and the annotation of the Elizabethan ambassador Thomas Smith. Particularly of interest are the schematic figures of cities that Smith was wont to place in his volumes. In this book, such figures coincide nicely with the geographical emphasis already manifest in the work’s prologue; Smith’s visual markers therefore push the words’ topographical potential to the fore and highlight the similarity to a “map” that the prologue is providing the reader for the rest of the work. There follows a careful study of the notes that Douglas Gordon himself left in this book, and a charming coda that evokes the notes that Mary McKinley makes in her editions, as indeed do we all, traces of books’ ability to awaken a “potential for humanity.” In “Itineraries of Satire: Polysemy and Morality in Marguerite de Navarre’s Heptaméron,” Bernd Renner extends his important work on satire by teasing out a number of parallels between satire, classically defined, and Marguerite’s novella collection. This essay is driven by rhetorical categories, called in to compensate for satire’s notorious generic instability. Nonetheless, Renner rightly distinguishes Marguerite’s labile use of the genre from the monological Juvenalian brand of satire, increasingly coming to dominate religious polemic. Nicholas Shangler’s “Language Lessons: Homophones and Gender Con­ fusion in Des Périers’s Nouvelles Récréations et joyeux devis” argues that our settled, comfortable assumptions regarding communication prove misleading when looking at the Renaissance, when observers were more likely to emphasize the shortcomings of human language in a fallen, post-Babel world. The period is more often celebrated as one in which vernacularism triumphs, printing acts as an “agent of change,” and widespread literacy emerges thanks to the Reformation. The Renaissance marks the moment of the ascendancy of communication as we now know it: pervasive, media independent, democratic. As this essay shows, Des Périers is concerned particularly with the question of regional differences in French that stand in the way of imposing one standard national language. The focus on one particular category of linguistic misunderstanding reflects one specific historical problem of language: spelling standardizations of a vernacular that until then had remained in major part oral.\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nIn “The Dido Effect and the Rise of the French Novel,” Virginia Krause examines the curious Angoysses douloureuses in order to elucidate the unstable transitional period between romance and the novel. The lack of generic definition and clear precedent are presented here as a quintessential “humanist” opportunity which affords the author Hélisenne de Crenne remarkable latitude to invent, explore, and mix genres. Krause contends that epic provides the underlying architecture and rationale for the Angoysses’s seemingly ill-fitting three parts. She evokes the unfulfilled expectations surrounding the epic in France during these years—one thinks of Du Bellay’s Regrets, which similarly yearns toward the form. This essay grounds these larger problems and the paradox they seemingly pose in being applied to the Angoysses in a careful study of the parallels between the protagonist Hélisenne and Dido. Both textual and contextual details are assembled to make a compelling case for seeing this book as an opportune recentering of the epic around a woman’s perspective in an “elegiac” mode. Augustine’s depiction of Dido further explains the penitential turn in the Angoysses’s third part. Finally, all of this is finely linked to the practice of having younger boys play women’s roles at school and all boys reciting female speeches as part of their expressive training in Latin.\n\nOn Poets and Poetry\n\nEdwin Duval’s exacting “Maurice Scève and the Feminized Voice of Courtly Lyric” begins by arguing how echoes of Virgil’s Dido proved explicit enough in Petrarch that readers were meant to understand the male poet to be consciously adopting a woman’s persona. Returning to the subject of some of his most illuminating early studies, Duval applies this insight to the famously elusive poetry of Maurice Scève. The poet’s identifications with mythical females, as well as with natural phenomena typically gendered female, reinforce the sense that he has adopted a feminine role. By inverting solar and lunar imagery, and the god and goddess associated with each, Scève suggests that, in love, “the man is woman and the woman is the man.” Further, Duval claims this to act as a structural feature of Petrarchan love, one that lends such poetry its peculiar evocative force. He traces the phenomenon to the courtly transposition of feudal relations between lord and vassal onto the lady and her subservient lover. But rather than take this earlier inversion as given—a precedent that serves to close the issue—he invites us to consider how the courtly unsettling of traditional assumptions about the subordination of one sex to the other exercises profound implications for how we read authors like Pernette du Guillet and\n\n8\n\nTarte, Hoffmann and Persels\n\nLouise Labé who attempted to reclaim the woman’s voice in a lyric tradition that had already so thoroughly assimilated it. If the voluble lover and silent lady stand as paradoxical reversals of traditional gender roles, then in order to challenge Petrarchan fashion, these poets would have had to reinstate an order in which the man is the man and the woman is the woman. Leah L. Chang’s “In Search of ‘La Belle Cordière’: The Rise and Fall of Louise Labé” leads skillfully from the questions surrounding Labé’s first appearance in print to Mireille Huchon’s controversial denial of her existence a decade ago. As with Shakespeare, the claim involves denying that anyone other than a wellschooled, high-standing man could have written the work; unlike in the case of Shakespeare, as Chang sharply points out, Labé’s work does not enjoy established institutional support and therefore proves far more vulnerable to such questions of authenticity. Standing back from the immediate debates triggered by Huchon’s work, Chang uses the occasion to explore broader questions regarding the ways in which historicizing, gender-based, and even intellectual history modes of criticism all rely upon the hoary category of the author’s biography. This emerges as a particular anomaly in the wake of how gender studies detached gender from biological sex. If gender is a labile creation which different writers can inhabit variously, should it matter at all whether a particular work was written by a woman? Chang argues forcefully for continuing to read Labé’s work for what it demonstrates about the construction of gender, regardless of who wrote it. Nicolas Russell uses the concept of cultural memory in place of the more familiar “collective memory” to examine Clément Marot’s relation to François Villon. “Clément Marot and the Frames of Cultural Memory” pursues an extended reflection on the early awareness of the importance of institutional infrastructure—the “court,” and royal laws and patronage stemming from the court, influencing the use of French. Russell focuses on the promotion of poets as “memory specialists” who attain such a qualification through the virtuoso manipulation of poetic rules. In revisiting Du Bellay’s rejection of Marot’s poetry, Robert J. Hudson shows just how clearly the rise of vernacular French in the wake of 1539 Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts did not constitute the liberation of a popular idiom or the triumph of a native tongue over the Latin one. “Naïve douceur: Earthy Grist and Gallic Verve in the Marotic Rondeau” demonstrates rather that vernacularizing movements like the Pléiade aspired to create a new prestige language on the model of Latin, and disdained French as it was spoken by ordinary people. Marot suffered precisely because he wedded literary form so seamlessly to a natural, conversational style. Against a long critical tradition that has tended to celebrate Pléiade ideals, Hudson champions poets who held a\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\ncloser relationship to regional dialect and French as it was spoken; he does so through borrowing, with a smile, the oenological notion of “terroir.” His case study focuses on the home-grown form of the rondeau, a specifically Gallican genre that Marot perfected, which illustrates the features of a truly indigenous style. Villers-Cotterêts and the Pléiade did not inaugurate a tradition of native French literature; they killed one that was already well-developed at the end of the fifteenth century.\n\nOn Religious Controversies\n\nCathy Yandell’s “Rhetorics of Peace: Pierre de Ronsard and Michel de L’Hospital on the Eve of the French Wars of Religion” revisits a fraught decade of France’s history, one in which the country lurched irreversibly into thirty years of bloody civil war. She tracks this evolution first through Ronsard’s increasingly belligerent rhetoric, and then through L’Hospital’s political remonstrances that exhibit a similar faith in the power of words to shape the outcome of events. Although L’Hospital has long been regarded as a forerunner of modern advocates of tolerance, Yandell uncovers a considerably firmer, more partisan politician who only hesitated over the means of returning to a confessionally united France, not the end of religious unity itself. Diversity of opinion naturally counted in the sixteenth century as a symptom to be suffered, not an end to be pursued. Yet L’Hospital’s willingness to envision this state of affairs indefinitely, awaiting a slow cure rather than hazarding a violent remedy, nonetheless leaves us with something to learn from the patience of his policies. Building upon previous work on the importance of beards as an outward marker of confessional identity among reformers, Jeff Persels pursues his longstanding study of the material practices that underwrote the spiritual aims of the Reformation. “Bearding the Pope, circa 1562” identifies the Italian source text for the leading polemical attack on tonsuring in Valeriano Bolzani’s “defense” of clerical beards. Widening out from this specific example, Persels fields a bracing demonstration of how important mundane actions, such as shaving, could prove in the momentous undertaking of restoring Christianity to its true form—in the event, prefiguring the Reformation’s turn toward a masculinist, patriarchal social model. This study also demonstrates another lesson: namely, that no matter how concrete and simple the material practice, it can invoke an entire history of accumulated attitudes. Appealing to patristic tradition, biblical and canon law, and even the “law of nature,” polemical works regarding tonsuring show how reformers actively engaged in the process of creating a tradition for themselves. Less concerned with rupture and revolution than\n\n10\n\nTarte, Hoffmann and Persels\n\nmodern accounts often make them seem, reformers instead invested much energy into collecting, assembling, and shaping a “past” out of which they could claim to have grown. Thus, the “what” of these pamphlets points toward the enduring materiality of the Reformation, despite the movement’s claims to dematerialize the fleshy excesses of the Roman Church. But the “how” of these works shows a second impulse eager to link present practices to past precedent, and thereby anchor the Reformation in established custom and history. In “Reconversion Tales: How to Make Sense of Lapses in Faith,” George Hoffmann examines the case of Hugues Sureau du Rosier, a Catholic turned Protestant who became a Protestant turned Catholic before returning once again to the reformed faith. Such cases of “serial conversion” expose stress lines in the early modern period’s efforts to consolidate stable confessional identities. Du Rosier himself, however, managed to reconcile his apostasy through identifying with the figure of Peter, both a lapsed apostle who denied Christ and the stable “rock” upon whom the Church erected itself. Peter’s succession in fact constituted the primary justification for Du Rosier’s lingering attraction to Catholicism. Inventive reading practices of the Bible like this one reveal how sola scriptura could diversify the kinds of stories early moderns told about themselves. The providential micro-history Du Rosier constructed for himself participates in a broader Reformation tension between conflicting claims of succession and substitution—this is, on the one hand, a claim of continuity with apostolic doctrine, and, on the other, a claim of rupture with the medieval traditions embodied in the Roman Church. The continuity that the Reformation asserted, Hoffmann concludes, depended upon identificational reading practices, such as those of Du Rosier. Although numerous early modern actors aspired to find or build a “New Jerusalem,” the historian of the first-century Jewish revolt against Rome, Josephus, furnishes Agrippa d’Aubigné with a starkly negative portrait of the city that helps the French writer paint Leaguer Paris as a darkly partisan capital. Stephen Murphy’s “Aubigné, Josephus, and Useful Betrayal” details numerous other parallels between the ancient soldier-historian and the Reformation soldier-poet as each countenances instances of extremism among compatriots and forms compacts with the enemy in order to survive. What interests Murphy most, however, is how in both cases betrayal seems to enable or trigger subsequent writing; and not necessarily in the name of mere self-justification. Josephus’s defection signals his rebirth as a Roman historian, while Aubigné’s three years spent at the Catholic court are bracketed by two near-death experiences in which he experiences visions that will form the basis of his epic, Les Tragiques. True, Josephus’s conversion remains permanent, while Aubigné’s lapse proves temporary—ever after ruefully regretted or shamefully silenced.\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nBut both authors’ need to relate the originating point of their literary creations to moments of betrayal suggests a fundamental connection between defection from a prior, life-defining allegiance and the refashioning of the real that literature performs. Despite the many ways in which one might construe a tension between acting and writing, Murphy intimates that in order to write, these writers needed to act, and act darkly. Corinne Noirot’s “ ‘The Difficulty Is to Judge Well’: Jean de la Taille, Deceptive Astrologer” (Le Blason des pierres précieuses and La Géomance abrégée, 1574) finds an unexpected analogue to Montaigne’s practice of self-regulation through interpretation in La Taille’s two works on divination, which receive careful scrutiny and insightful explication. Noirot entices from inauspicious material a therapeutic use of interpretation that substitutes for divination proper, or what she aptly terms “palliative play.” She remarks upon “a humorous oxymoron, since the notions of free will and astrological determinism unambiguously clash with one another”; the same could also be said of Montaigne’s invocation of “I know not what inexplicable and fateful force that was the mediator of this union” to celebrate the “liberté volontaire” of his friendship with La Boétie.\n\nOn Montaigne\n\nIn “Montaigne, Monsters, and Modernity,” Kathleen Long evokes the long history of erudite responses to perceived “monstrosity” spanning from the early modern fascination with the prodigious to the vexed modern category of disability. Early modern exponents like Montaigne, Long argues, proved paradoxically more ready to conceive the anomalous as differently enabled rather than disabled. Building upon her distinguished body of work on hermaphrodites and early modern gender, she examines Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire’s schematizing attempts to account for hermaphroditic gender variation, comparing these with Georges Canguilhem’s critiques of the normal in a way that makes Canguilhem seem almost to be a modern avatar of Montaigne. This ambitious essay attempts to bridge the modern/pre-modern divide in a way that makes the pre-modern speak to today’s preoccupations. To pursue the kinds of productive anachronism this essay invites, the move here from the epistemological consequences of diversity (skepticism) to autism in the final pages invites one to consider whether Montaigne in some ways might stand as an “autistic” thinker with respect to his time. Cara Welch’s “Montaigne’s Response to the Alcibiades Question” raises a question crucial to Montaigne’s project: What is the individual’s place in\n\n12\n\nTarte, Hoffmann and Persels\n\nhistory? Alcibiades’s infamous character flaws make him a perfect case study for precisely the way in which Montaigne chooses to pursue this question: not how the individual can triumph over greater historical forces, but how individuals’ shortcomings, unbeknownst to them, can determine the course of events. An elegant contextualization of Alcibiades’s profile in the Renaissance leads to a detailed study of the three occasions on which Montaigne discusses the figure.\n\nOn the Sciences and Knowledge Networks\n\nIn “France’s Mid-Sixteenth-Century Imperial Gaze on Canada: The Dieppe School of Hydrography, the Kingdom of Saguenay, and the Mise en scène of Possession,” Scott D. Juall treats a series of lavish maps from the Dieppe School not as instruments of imperial expansion so much as a fantasy of what a North American French empire might entail. Sometimes these maps even served as substitutes for those ambitions. This essay carefully takes the reader through the prominent features of each map, relating their elements to the specific political circumstances (or conjoncture) that held during the time of each map’s creation. As an ensemble they provide a coherent and surprisingly rich visual narration of France’s first, failed imperial effort. More than that, they also seem to inform the way in which the country’s later efforts in Brazil and then, again, in Canada unfolded. Pascale Barthe focuses on one well-known figure from Guillaume Rondelet’s study of sea creatures in order to trace a growing awareness of the natural sciences as a collective endeavor and the widespread practice of them as such. “Guillaume Rondelet’s Monkfish, or Natural History as Social Network” rebuts attempts to exaggerate an individualistic, scientific tenor of Renaissance natural histories, in favor of their fully social nature. For Barthe, instead of the “laboratory,” the salon or social circle constituted the archetypal space for natural investigation. A graceful close reading of the image and text, juxtaposed with its homologues from among other naturalists, opens onto this thesis of natural history as a social undertaking. The essay then turns to Marguerite de Navarre as the likely patron in this instance; it highlights the importance of “weak ties” or “short-term clientage relationships” as underwriting the work of scholars like Rondelet. Alongside the patron, however, Barthe also reminds us of the fishermen, cooks, and doctors who all assisted in Rondelet’s efforts. This work of scholarly archeology aims to uncover the dense network of relations that underpins natural history and that, so often, disappears from view today.\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nKaren Simroth James’s “Making the Stones Speak: The Curious Observations of Gabriele Simeoni” artfully places Simeoni and his unclassifiable antiquarian travel account within a network of scholars and collectors, pan-European in reach but, in the present instance, centered in Lyon around the publishing activities of Jean de Tournes and Guillaume Rouillé. Hardly content to document historic monuments, Simeoni’s imaginative and capacious work associates them with fictional ones and verse both ancient and contemporary. James argues that this creative, prospective approach to travel writing and antiquarianism suggests how classical Rome remained a virtual matrix realizable in the present, however much humanists had sharpened their sense of historical distance from antiquity. Simeoni therefore depicts a French landscape as fanciful as those found in Ovid, in which a profound metamorphosis was transforming Renaissance France. In the courts of Fontainebleau and the Louvre, the chateaux of Anet and Oiron, and the books of Scève and Martin, the past was changing into something strange and new, a process that Simeoni saw himself as actively furthering.\n\nOn Mary B. McKinley Mary McKinley’s critical work has drawn upon a remarkably broad range of approaches, from intertextuality to spatial studies, social history to iconology, reformation history to classical studies, and religious history to gender studies. This ecumenism is well reflected in her numerous doctoral students who illustrate a similarly expansive spectrum of styles, methods, and sensibilities, covering topics that extend from pamphlet literature to ébénisterie, New World narrative to women writers, and rhetoric to memory studies. The writers that moved from the rooms of her seminars onto the pages of students’ dissertations are manifold: Plato, Desiderius Erasmus, François Rabelais, Jeanne Flore, Clément Marot, Madeleine and Catherine Des Roches, Pierre de Ronsard, Pernette du Guillet, Bonaventure des Périers, Marguerite de Navarre, and, of course, Michel de Montaigne. Her legendary patience with her students, and her pride in them, made her a prominent mentor in the field of sixteenth-century French studies, one whom many sought out during the four decades she spent teaching at the University of Virginia. After obtaining a master’s degree in French from Wisconsin, Mary pursued doctoral work at Rutgers University, during which time she studied under Donald Frame. After earning her doctorate in 1974 with Jack Undank, she immediately began teaching at the University of Virginia, and in 1980 she became the first woman to earn tenure in the department of French. The year following, her first study on Montaigne appeared, which distinguished her as one of the major scholars on one of the Renaissance’s most influential authors. Her studies on various essays such as “Of vanity,” “Apology for Raymond Sebond,” and “On some verses of Virgil” continue to stand as reference points in the field. As every student of Montaigne knows, Pierre Villey shaped Montaigne’s twentieth-century reception as a paragon of the modern critical reader. Using an “evolutionary” approach, Villey portrayed Montaigne moving from passively collecting materials in his earliest essays to actively repurposing them in his later writing. The move toward deconstructive readings in the 1970s and 1980s challenged popular views of the Essays as straightforwardly transmitting humanistic values. But they left intact Villey’s picture of their sources, composition, and development. Mary’s path-breaking Words in a Corner quietly returned to these seemingly out-of-fashion questions in order to trouble Villey’s neat one-to-one correspondences between classical source and Montaigne’s borrowing. At a time when Montaigne’s intense engagement with antiquity\n\n© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, ���8 | doi ��.��63/9789004351516_003\n\nOn Mary B. Mckinley\n\n15\n\nrisked disappearing from the pages of criticism, her work led a new generation to appreciate the deeply inventive and unexpected ways Montaigne interacts with the authors he quoted, referenced, or silently adapted. In her second study on Montaigne, in 1996, Les Terrains vagues des Essais: Itinéraires et intertextes, Mary shifted to Montaigne’s relationship with modern authors (one of the oversights of Villey, who privileged classical sources). Primarily, however, she now sought to emphasize oblique connections within the Essays themselves, tracing images that run beneath the surface of the book’s seemingly random succession of topics but which nevertheless lend chapters a natural and striking cohesiveness. Beginning by linking the appearance of wild landscapes in the background of Renaissance paintings and prints to Montaigne’s stated predilection for undomesticated terrains, the book develops a geography of the work’s mental space in which vacant spaces and labyrinths combine to form an imaginary topography that locates Montaigne’s wanderings between topics and shapes them into a cohesive intellectual itinerary. Her work explored the spatial poetics of the Essays, but it also made the most convincing argument to date for Montaigne’s hidden poetic aspirations, as discernible in the deeply coherent aesthetic dimension of his prose. It would be safe to say that the modern renaissance of scholarly work on Marguerite de Navarre began with the 1993 volume Mary co-edited with John Lyons, Critical Tales, a collection that inspired a groundswell of serious new work on one of the great Renaissance writers, and a study that still serves as a fixture in the field. More recently, Mary co-edited with Gary Ferguson the 2013 Companion to Marguerite de Navarre, a volume that demonstrates the fruit of Critical Tales and intersects with a number of the questions Mary herself explored regarding Marguerite’s religious readings and devotional practice. In a series of articles spanning her career since attaining the rank of full professor in 1993, Mary examined the tight interweaving of narrative structure and devotional aims in Marguerite’s best-known work, the Heptaméron, mirroring how she had previously brought together Montaigne’s humanist learning and his poetic sensibility. This strand in her scholarship will culminate in the forthcoming appearance of a new translation of the Heptaméron in collaboration with her student Nicolas Russell, thanks to a grant she helped win from the National Endowment for the Humanities. Marguerite interested Mary in the role of women writers, a topic that forms one of the dominant themes of her later work and, indeed, that of a number of her students. One of her signal contributions was to bring back to light an outspoken women writer in Calvin’s Geneva, Marie Dentière. Beginning with a pair of talks in 1995, a series of critical essays from 1997 to 1999, her translation\n\n16\n\nOn Mary B. McKinley\n\nand edition in 2004, and various subsequent reference pieces, Mary returned Dentière to her place in the Reformation firmament. Given Mary’s prominent role in Montaigne studies, it came as no surprise that she participated as well in reviving the fortunes of Montaigne’s close friend and instrumental posthumous editor, Marie de Gournay, through a trio of studies appearing in 1995–96. Finally, this all-too-brief overview would not be complete without signaling Mary’s crucial role in bringing scholarly attention to the Gordon collection of French Renaissance imprints that first arrived at the University of Virginia Library in 1986. Her regular visits with classes and the introduction of this trove of rare books to visiting scholars brought dozens of researchers to this exemplary collection and inspired a wide array of scholarly work. With her former student and colleague Karen James, Mary further publicized the importance of this collection through the Gordon digital collection, The Renaissance in Print, one of the key sites for French Renaissance scholars, thanks to generous grants from the Florence Gould Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities, and support from the University of Virginia Library.

The present contribution to this ongoing discussion was sparked by an exchange of ideas with Mary McKinley in the context of editing together the Brill Companion to Marguerite de Navarre.1 The issue in question was whether female sexual agency—women acting on or expressing sexual desire—was inevitably portrayed in the collection of tales in a negative light, whether it was always, explicitly or implicitly, subject to censure. Taking the work as a whole, this is certainly the predominant impression the reader comes away with. Of course, as readers, we are not required to adopt the same ideological/moral lens as the storytellers or devisants themselves. As Hope Glidden argued in an important article in Critical Tales (the landmark volume edited by Mary McKinley and John Lyons in 1993), we can read characters like the sexually active and dissimulating Jambicque in nouvelle 43 otherwise, “not as a hypocrite, but as a resistant subject.”2 Nonetheless, a number of critics, including myself, have also noted that female chastity is often figured in the Heptaméron as a form of resistance to male violence and a more or less deceitful rhetoric of seduction.3 Thus, to seek to identify a feminist or pro-woman position in the masculinist discourse of Hircan, Saffredent, and Simontault on the grounds that this 1 Gary Ferguson and Mary B.

Is there nowhere, then, in the Heptaméron where we might locate a female affirmation of women’s sexuality? In order to try to do so, I propose to look again at the first day of storytelling and at a particularly significant moment in the middle of that day: the articulation between tales 5 and 6. The importance of the sequence of stories and discussions at this point in relation to the rhetoric of exemplarity associated with the querelle des femmes (“la guerre des sexes”) or with other anti-woman literature was noted some years ago by Gérard Defaux.6 To summarize rather crudely, the first four tales present a series of examples and counter-examples of female behavior, in which men largely criticize or seek to seduce women, while women respond with notable stories of female chastity. Thus, the wicked wife of the procureur SaintAignan, described by Simontault in nouvelle 1, is opposed by Oisille’s mulekeeper’s wife from Amboise, a “martire de chasteté” [“martyr of chastity”] in nouvelle 2.7 Saffredent’s Queen of Naples in story 3, who betrays her husband in order to avenge his prior marital infidelity, and whom the narrator encourages the women present to imitate, is followed, in tale 4, by Ennasuite’s virtuous 4 See Gisèle Mathieu-Castellani, “ ‘La guerre des sexes’ et la cause des femmes dans L’Heptaméron,” in Liaroutzos, L’Heptaméron de Marguerite de Navarre (II), 87–101.

Geburon’s breaking ranks with the preceding male storytellers is notable in that it undermines the strict dichotomy in which women defend female chastity, and men, according to a conflicted logic, either encourage them to be sexually active or criticize them for being so. It is true, of course, that women had male advocates as well as detractors in the querelle des femmes. The more fundamental complication of the querelle’s rhetoric of praise and blame occurs with nouvelle 6, recounted by Nomerfide, who also plays a central role in the discussion preceding and following it. For Nomerfide also breaks ranks with her sex, announcing that she will tell of a woman who behaves wickedly. This she does explicitly, however, in order to show that women can be evil as well as good, and that “tout ainsy que la vertu de la batteliere ne honnore poinct les aultres femmes si elles ne l’ensuyvent, aussi le vice d’une aultre ne les peut deshonorer” (133) [“just as the ferrywoman’s virtue does not redound to the honour of other women unless they actually follow in her footsteps, so the vice of one woman does not bring dishonour on all women” (101)]. For the first time, then, Nomerfide calls into question the very value of exemplary stories, since they present nothing more than individual cases that may or may not be followed by other individual women—or men. The tale Nomerfide tells of a sexually savvy woman, who cuckolds and tricks her aged one-eyed husband, represents a version of a traditional misogynous story in which the woman was either reviled (as in Petrus Alfonsi’s twelfth-century Disciplina clericalis) or celebrated by other lustful men at the expense of the denigrated cuckold (as in the anonymous Burgundian Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles).9 At the moment of the deceiving of the husband, however, after his wife has enabled her lover to escape by placing her hand over his good eye, there occurs what David LaGuardia terms an 8 Based on the testimony of Pierre de Brantôme, the protagonists of nouvelle 4 are often taken as representing Marguerite herself and the admiral de Bonnivet (cf. L’Heptaméron, ed. cit., p. 118). The presumed autobiographical nature of the story is fundamental to the reading proposed by Patricia Francis Cholakian, Rape and Writing in the Heptaméron of Marguerite de Navarre (Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1991), esp. 1–31. For a contrasting reading, see John O’Brien, “Fictions of the Eyewitness,” in Narrative Worlds: Essays on the Nouvelle in Fifteenth- and Sixteenth-Century France, eds. Gary Ferguson and David LaGuardia (Tempe, AZ: Medieval and Renaissance Texts and Studies, 2005), 123–38. 9 Here I draw on the excellent discussion of this nouvelle and its antecedents by David LaGuardia, “Exemplarity as Misogyny: Variations on the Tale of the One-Eyed Cuckold,” in Ferguson and LaGuardia, Narrative Worlds, 139–58.\n\n30\n\nFerguson\n\n“intrusion of ‘the real’ ” (155), since the man recognizes immediately the trick that has been played on him. As LaGuardia comments: “The husband’s reaction to his wife’s trickery unmasks its factitious nature, since, in the ‘real’ world, such a maneuver would never go unrecognized” (155). The conclusion drawn by the husband is that no man can compel a woman to virtue. He therefore prays that God will lead his wife to amend her life and leaves her to reflect and—as indeed happens—to repent. Virtue, it appears, must be chosen by an individual, open to the working of divine grace. Despite the association of nouvelle 6 with a misogynous exemplary and literary tradition, then, the modifications it undergoes in Nomerfide’s telling remove it from its stereotypically black-and-white context of blame or praise of all women—in line with the narrator’s initial assertion of the always individual nature of vice and virtue. At the end of her story, moreover, Nomerfide states: Par cecy, voyez-vous, mes dames, combien est prompte et subtille une femme à eschapper d’un dangier. Et, si, pour couvrir ung mal, son esprit a promtement trouvé remede, je pense que, pour en eviter ung ou pour faire quelque bien, son esperit seroit encores plus subtil. (135–36) [So you can see, Ladies, that women can be very cunning when they’re in a scrape. And if they’re clever enough to cover up something bad, I think they’d be even more ingenious in avoiding bad deeds or in doing good ones. (103)] On the face of it, this conclusion appears to represent a complete about-turn and to directly contradict the initially stated intention of showing that some women are wicked. More fundamentally, however, it supports the larger point that the particular virtue or vice of one woman brings no honor to or blame upon another. In this way, if there is a return to exemplarity in Nomerfide’s concluding remarks, it is a thoroughly paradoxical one: the example of one woman’s vice might serve to reveal some women’s virtue. Reading in a strictly linear fashion from the beginning of the work, this midpoint in the initial series of ten tales thus represents a crucial moment in the economy not only of the first day but of the work as a whole. No less importantly, this point of articulation also involves a shift in the dynamics of the relations between the storytellers, and notably between the women. As we know, the women and the men do not always form two distinct groups in agreement internally and in opposition to each other. But the women do tend to express similar points of view and often take issue with those of their male counterparts, especially the trio Hircan-Saffredent-Simontault. In the\n\nPuns, Exemplarity, and Women ’ s Sexual Agency\n\n31\n\ndiscussion following nouvelle 5, however, significant differences emerge between Nomerfide, one of the younger women, and Oisille, the oldest and most devout of those present. While previous critics have commented on this exchange between the two women, I want to underscore in particular that it is directly linked to the way in which Nomerfide, in narrative terms, strikes out independently immediately afterwards. At the end of story 5, the discussion turns initially on the boatwoman’s humble status, which, according to Geburon, makes her virtue all the more remarkable. The extent of the ferrywoman’s merit is called into question, however, by one of the women, Longarine, not on the basis of her lowly social position but on the grounds that most cordeliers are not at all attractive. As Patricia Cholakian has argued, the question that Longarine crucially introduces at this point is that of the woman’s desire: resisting unwanted sexual advances would not be a matter of moral virtue but an act of self-preservation, of self-determination (Cholakian, 63–64). While today such a distinction might seem selfevident, it must be remembered that in the sixteenth century, it challenged a traditionally misogynous view that considered women to be always desirous of sexual attentions, from whatever quarter they might come. In response, Geburon does not recur to this argument, however; rather, he remains with a consideration of social status in order to insist that women unaccustomed to serviteurs like those of Longarine might well find a friar desirable; indeed, cordeliers might be just as handsome and even more vigorous than noblemen, worn out by the rigors of military exercise: “ilz sont hommes aussy beaulx, aussi fortz et plus reposez que nous autres, qui sommes tous cassez du harnoys” (132) [“They’re often just as good-looking as we are, just as well-built and less worn out, because they’ve not been knocked about in battle” (100)]. The military register introduced here will return and be developed at a later point in the conversation.10 Despite Geburon’s affirmation that a cordelier might indeed be attractive, Nomerfide will have none of it and voices her agreement with Longarine: she would rather have been thrown into the river than have had sex with a friar. At this point, Oisille interjects: “Vous sçavez doncques bien nouer?” (132) [“So you’re a strong swimmer, are you then!” (101)]. To suggest that Nomerfide would only allow herself to be thrown into the river to escape the friars because she 10 For a discussion of this expression and the defensive rhetoric of which it forms part, examined in relation to early modern models of masculinity, see Jeffery C. Persels, “ ‘Qui sommes tous cassez du harnoys’ or, the Heptaméron and Uses of the Male Body,” in Heroic Virtue, Comic Infidelity: Reassessing Marguerite de Navarre’s Heptaméron, ed. Dora E. Polachek (Amherst, MA: Hestia Press, 1993), 90–102.\n\n32\n\nFerguson\n\nis an expert swimmer—in other words, that she would be risking little and certainly not her life—is clearly to imply that her commitment to chastity or to resisting sexual advances is less than vigorous. Oisille’s remark is more freighted yet, however, for remaining afloat in water or not, drowning, were associated metaphorically with sexual passion. We need only recall Louise Labé’s famous line “je me brule et me noye” [“I burn and drown”]; Ronsard wrote in similar terms: “je me noye, et me brusle moymesme” [“I drown and burn myself”].11 A number of different semes are in play in this nexus, however. Etymologically, noyer, coming from the Latin necare, to kill—whence se noyer—is unrelated to water. Nouer in Middle French, said to derive from the unattested Vulgar Latin form notare for natare, and which today has disappeared, was a synonym of nager (< Latin navigare), to swim.12 Although it represents a departure from all of the principal extant manuscripts, the first printed editions of the Heptaméron—those of Boaistuau in 1558 and of Gruget in 1559 (both of which, especially the former, are marked by editorial modifications)—in fact give nager in place of nouer.13 The latter reading seems distinctly preferable, however, in that it also had an explicitly sexual sense, signifying to copulate or to have carnal relations. In this acceptation, nouer, meaning principally to knot (a meaning it retains in present-day French), derives from the Latin nodare or nodere. Its sexual meaning emerges through the semantic constellation of tying, linking, uniting, coupling. It is this frankly sexual meaning that Oisille mobilizes through her pun on the two different but homophonic verbs nouer. As I have argued elsewhere, knots are, in addition, a recurrent leitmotif associated with the cordeliers in the Heptaméron, serving to underscore the gulf separating the religious vows that the friars take (symbolized by the knots in their rope belt) and the reality of their conduct—in this instance, the knotting of lustful sexual coupling and their vow of chastity.14 The friars’ hypocrisy"
