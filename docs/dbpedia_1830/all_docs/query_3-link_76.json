Daymet: Daily Surface Weather Data on a 1-km Grid for North America, Version 4 R1.

The general cross-validation protocol is to withhold one observation at a time from a sample, generate a prediction error for the withheld case by comparison with observed values within the sample, and repeat over all observations in the sample to generate an average prediction error. Interest is in both the absolute value and the sign of prediction errors generated in this manner.\n\nData Acquisition, Materials, and Methods\n\nData Access\n\nThese data are available through the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC).\n\nDaymet: Daily Surface Weather Data on a 1-km Grid for North America, Version 4 R1\n\nContact for Data Center Access Information:\n\nReferences\n\nDataset Revisions\n\nNote: The ORNL DAAC revised its methods for versioning datasets to be more consistent with data versioning practices at the NASA Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS) and the general Earth Science data community. With the revised versioning strategy, the dataset version number (including both major and minor version numbers) remain unchanged when a release only appends new data and existing data are not changed. At the time of publication of 2023 Daymet data, the version numbers of Daymet datasets, including the Version 4 and prior versions are updated as shown in the revision tables below.\n\nORNL DAAC Release Record for Version 4.1\n\nORNL DAAC Release Date\n\nDaymet Product Version\n\nDescription\n\nApril 23rd, 2024 Version 4.1 (V4 R1) This release added daily gridded mosaics for 2023 for each Daymet Version 4.1 variable. March 1, 2023 This release added daily gridded mosaics for 2022 for each Daymet Version 4.1 variable. November 1, 2022 In this Version 4.1 (V4 R1) release, all 2020 and 2021 files (42 total) were updated to improve predictions especially in high-latitude areas. It was found that input files used for deriving 2020 and 2021 data had, for a significant portion of Canadian weather stations, missing daily variable readings for the month of January. The missing readings have been verified by the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) who maintain the Global Historical Climatology Network daily (GHCNd) database. NCEI has corrected issues with the Environment Canada ingest feed which led to the missing readings and has built in more protections to prevent the loss of data. The revised 2020 and 2021 Daymet V4 files were derived with new GHCNd inputs. Files outside of 2020 and 2021 have not changed.\n\nORNL DAAC Release Record for Version 4\n\nORNL DAAC Release Date\n\nDaymet Product Version\n\nDescription\n\nMarch 9, 2022 Version 4 This release added daily gridded mosaics for 2021 for each Daymet Version 4 variable. April 8, 2021 This release added daily gridded mosaics for 2020 for each Daymet Version 4 variable. December 15, 2020\n\nThis release provided daily gridded mosaics for Continental North America (Mexico, United States, Canada) and Hawaii for 1980â€“2019 and for Puerto Rico for 1950 - 2019 for each Daymet Version 4 variable.\n\nORNL DAAC Release Record for Version 3\n\nORNL DAAC Release Date\n\nDaymet Product Version Description March 17, 2020 Version 3 This release added daily gridded mosaics for 2019 for each Daymet Version 3 variable. April 3, 2019 This release added daily gridded mosaics for 2018 for each Daymet Version 3 variable. April 19, 2018 This release added daily gridded mosaics for 2017 for each Daymet Version 3 variable. April 20, 2017 This release added daily gridded mosaics for 2016 for each Daymet Version 3 variable. July 15, 2016 This release provided new daily gridded mosaics for all meteorological variables and all years (1980-2015) based on improvements to the Daymet algorithm and expanded geographic coverage at high latitude. Daymet V2 mosaics are now available only upon request.\n\nORNL DAAC Release Record for Version 2"
