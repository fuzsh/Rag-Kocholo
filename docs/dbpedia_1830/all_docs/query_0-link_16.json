        "text": "on shore in such parts of Japan and in such territories recognized as sovereign to Japan, and in such parts of Korea and such adjacent Islands as are recognized to be Korean, but exclusive of all the mandated territory formerly administered by Japan, as are under the governmental control of the United States, or of an ally of the United States during World War II, or in ships operating in such home or territorial waters or contiguous ocean areas in direct support of occupation or in aircraft based upon and operating from such territories or ships. Service in the Korean area, on and subsequent to 27 June 1950, determined by ComNavFE as eligible for the Korean Service Medal, will not be creditable towards eligibility for the Occupation Service Medal. Services performed in the Asiatic-Pacific area between 3 September 1945 and 2 March 1946, inclusive, shall not be credited toward individual eligibility for the Navy Occupation Service Medal unless the individual is already eligible for the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal for services performed prior to 2 September 1945.\n\nThe Navy Occupation Service Medal shall not be awarded for any service for which another medal is authorized, except as provided in paragraphs 3 and 4 above. Not more than one Navy Occupation Service Medal will be awarded to any individual regardless of whether service has been performed in different areas or places at different intervals of time. Appropriate clasps marked \"Europe\" and \"Asia\" are authorized to be attached to the ribbon of the medal to denote service in Europe and Asia respectively. No distinctive device to denote possession of the above clasps is authorized for wearing on the service ribbon.\n\nNaval personnel serving ninety consecutive days or more on permanent or temporary duty while assigned or attached to a unit which has been designated by the Chief of Naval Operations as participating in direct support of the Berlin Airlift between 26 June 1948 and 30 September 1949 are eligible for the Navy Occupation Service Medal and the Berlin Airlift Device. The Berlin Airlift Device is a gold-colored miniature of a C-54 type aircraft and is to be worn on the service ribbon and suspension ribbon of the Navy Occupation Service Medal with the nose pointing upward at a thirty-degree angle and toward the wearer's own right. The device is of three-eighths inch wing span, other dimensions proportionate. (See Part II (c) for list of units eligible.)"
