        "text": "This report summarizes the results of the archaeological and burial recovery program conducted on a portion of a pre-contact Ohlone Indian cemetery discovered at site, CA-SCL-869 Katwáš Ketneyma Waréeptak (The Four Matriarchs) Site, located at 5912 Cahalan Avenue, San Jose, Santa Clara County, California. The remains of an ancestral Ohlone Indian burial along with a sandstone boulder mortar were inadvertently discovered on May 16, 2007 by Stitch Construction workers during the excavation of the handicapped parking area adjacent to the Fire Station. The skeletal remains were discovered when the Stitch Construction backhoe operator and construction crew noticed the presence of bones during earthmoving excavation.\n\nThis final archaeological report presents information on the recovery and analysis of ancestral Muwekma Ohlone burials from the heritage site CA-SCL-609, which the Tribal leadership named Horše ’Iššéete Ruwwatka [Place of the Good Health House Site] in their Ohlone language. This primarily prehistoric archaeological site underwent ground disturbance during the expansion of the Ronald McDonald House, located in Palo Alto, California. Information on the construction project setting, the archaeological setting, and results from the monitoring of ground disturbing activities including tree removal, archaeological testing, and construction are also reported herein. Also presented are the methods employed by the burial recovery team, the circumstances of burial discovery, and a description of burials and isolated human remains found during excavation as well as the results of the skeletal biology, AMS dating and stable isotope studies.. The archaeological context of the burials is discussed within the broader framework of deposits recorded by the archaeological monitors and those data derived from the site are compared with the broader context of local sites in the San Francisquito watershed area.\n\nThis report presents the results of the burial and archaeological data recovery program conducted within a portion of site CA-SCL-128 [Thámien Rúmmeytak [Thámien (Guadalupe) River Site], a Late Middle Period-to-Late Period Ancestral Muwekma Ohlone Cemetery located at 282 Almaden Boulevard, City of San Jose, Santa Clara County, California. The recovered burial was inadvertently discovered on January 24, 2012 by a construction crew excavating a trench and footings for a concrete overhang canopy at the rear entrance to the newly renovated Hyatt Place Hotel. The Hyatt Place Hotel, previously known as the Holiday Inn, which was originally constructed in 1977 and was the location of a major prehistoric cemetery/residential village locality historically recorded as CA-SCL-128 (The Holiday Inn Site).\n\nMission Santa Clara de Asís, a Franciscan mission in Alta California, was home to Ohlone/Costanoan, Yokuts, and Miwok people who perpetuated and reinterpreted mortuary practices at multiple points across the landscape. More than three decades of archaeological research at Mission Santa Clara has revealed burials and associated grave goods from two different mission era cemeteries, as well as the archaeological remains of possible mourning ceremonies within the mission’s indigenous residential area. Burial records also reveal a wealth of information about how Franciscans and native people negotiated cultural and religious practices regarding death and mourning. The findings from Santa Clara are contextualized through evidence from precontact archaeological sites and early ethnographies, as well as from historical accounts by missionaries and other observers. The processes of negotiation and accommodation that unfolded between Franciscan missionaries and indigenous people at Mission Santa Clara are compared with evidence from other Alta California missions.\n\nThis report presents the results of the burial and archaeological data recovery program conducted within a portion of an Early Bay Period Site located on Bay Road, City of East Palo Alto, San Mateo County, California. The recovered burial was inadvertently discovered on June 12, 1986 during backhoe trenching operations conducted by the Sanitation District. A repair backhoe trench was excavated in front of the 1416 Bay Road residence driveway in order to locate a break and leak in the sewer line. On June 13, 1986, the NAHC contact Mrs. Rosemary Cambra, Chairwoman of the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe of the San Francisco Bay Area to serve as the Most Likely Descendant (MLD) and the legal representative for the Most Likely Descendant tribal group. Chairwoman Cambra went out to inspect the discovery site and met with Mr. Wobogo who was then the Manager of the East Palo Alto Sanitary District. After some deliberations it became clear that the trenching needed to be completed in order to address the break and stop the leak in the sewer line. Chairwoman Cambra then formally recommended to the Sanitation District that a several phased mitigation Burial and Archaeological Data recovery program be implemented through the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe’s Cultural Resources Management (CRM) firm Ohlone Families Consulting Services (OFCS). As a result the Sanitation Agency then entered into a contractual agreement with OFCS for purposes of mitigating the adverse impacts to the Tribe’s ancestral human remains. The site was formally recorded on June 16, 1986 and the East Palo Alto Sanitary District (EPASD) Board of Directors held a meeting on June 19, 1986 to consider payment to OFCS for the field recovery program, analysis and final report. The EPASD voted only to pay for the burial recovery and decided not to fund any analysis or report writing under CEQA."
