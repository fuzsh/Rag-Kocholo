On Mojave I am seeing the GPS in the Finder usually in column mode below the Preview.\n\nHow did you edit the photo? If you used an external editor, it might not have added the GpS to the preview. Have you enabled the checkmark to include the location info, when you export the edited version with “file > export ... photos” ? If you simply drag a photo to the Desktop, the metadata may not be included."
