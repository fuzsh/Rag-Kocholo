        "text": "All About the Asheville Vortex + How & Where to Experience It 2024\n\nThe Asheville area has long been a place of ancient beauty, energy and healing. People have traveled here for ages to experience the health benefits of fresh mountain air, mineral hot springs and pure forests.\n\nI personally felt this area beckoning me for years before I actually moved here and many of my friends here report similar feelings.\n\nEnergy vortex locations USA\n\nThe top three vortex destinations in the United States are\n\n• Sedona, Arizona\n\n• Mount Shasta, California\n\n• Asheville, North Carolina\n\nThe most famous vortex is located in Sedona, Arizona.\n\nAsheville, North Carolina is located along the 33rd parallel, the same latitude as Sedona.\n\nMount Shasta is an active volcano shrouded in folklore.\n\nCheck out Be My Travel Muse for more Vortex locations around the world.\n\nWhat is an energy vortex | Asheville, NC\n\nA vortex is a natural concentration of spiritual, electric, magnetic and electromagnetic energy.\n\nLey lines were first theorized by amateur archaeologist Alfred Watkins in 1921. He claimed ancient structures like Stonehenge in England [whose long-lasting stone sarsens are comprised largely of quartz crystals, which you’ll read more about later], the Pyramids at Giza in Egypt and Chichen Itza Pyramids in Mexico seemed to align along invisible grid lines across the Earth that he called Ley Lines.\n\nYou can also think of ley lines as energy lines.\n\nIn fact, some scientists believe that ancient cultures chose to build pyramid structures because they focus electromagnetic energy and radio waves. And what natural geographic shapes do pyramids imitate? Mountains.\n\nA vortex is said to occur where these ley lines intersect. Three ley lines are said to connect in Asheville. The Appalachian mountains that surround this city are one of the most ancient mountain ranges in the world.\n\nOf course there are also skeptics that claim it is all just coincidence since ley lines can’t be seen or measured.\n\nHowever, quantum physics which studies the tiniest atoms and subatomic particles kind of supports the theory of the existence of invisible energy. Physicists have observed that atoms also contain invisible (to the naked eye), intangible energy in the form of protons, neutrons and electrons.\n\nSo it can be argued that everything on Earth is composed of energy vortices (plural of vortex) in the form of atoms and subatomic particles.\n\nWhat is a vortex? Spiritual vs Science\n\nI kinda feel like science and spirituality are two sides of the same coin. Several ancient spiritual leaders taught that everything we see is not as it seems and life is full of illusions.\n\nTo ancient Yogis, the distinction between the Universe and the self was an illusion. Within Yogic philosophy, Maya represents things we think are real but are not. There are a lot of themes of “emptiness” and the illusion of reality in Buddhism as well.\n\nA rock, for example, is not actually one solid object. It is actually made up of invisible particles that are always moving and vibrating. In fact, everything in the universe is in constant motion and vibrating at different frequencies.\n\nThen there is light. All electromagnetic radiation is light, but we can only see a small portion of this radiation—the portion we call visible light. When viewed through a prism, the colors separate into different wavelengths with red being the longest wavelength at 700 nanometers and violet being the shortest at 380-ish nanometers.\n\nWe all know that the Earth has invisible forces like atomic energy, electromagnetic radiation and gravity so I’m totally open to the existence other forms or energy and forces we don’t totally understand yet.\n\nWithout modern technology and distractions and a lot more time spent outdoors in Nature, I believe our ancestors were a lot more sensitive to these vibrations and energy fields.\n\nQuartz is also a combination of science and spirituality.\n\nClear quartz (aka crystal quartz) is a mineral made up of silicone and oxygen atoms (aka silicon-dioxide). It is named after the ancient Greek word for “ice” (krustallos) because the Greeks (and the Romans) believed that these crystals were a form of ice that never melted because they were formed by the gods.\n\nClear quartz is associated with and used for healing, spiritual growth and powerful positive vibrations.\n\nPhysically, quartz is supposed to boost your immune system and metabolism plus help rid your body of toxins.\n\nMentally & emotionally, it’s supposed to help release negative emotions and magnify brighter & more joyful feelings.\n\nMetaphysically, quartz connects with all the chakras (especially the crown chakra) and clears energetic blockages. It’s also the Aries birth stone.\n\nLearn more about quartz properties and meanings here.\n\nSome of the purest & highest quality quartz has historically been and continues to be mined in Western North Carolina. This quartz is then used in all kinds of products like semi-conductors, solar panels, ceramics and more.\n\nQuartz has also long been used in analog clocks and watches. These watches/clocks use a tiny, low-frequency piece of quartz crystal which serves as the oscillator to which the battery sends electricity, so that the hands tick and keep time constantly and consistently.\n\nHere is more about how quartz watches work.\n\nThere are also several other types of quartz including amethyst, citrine, onyx and agate. Check out a complete list of quartz varieties here.\n\nThere are several shops where you can buy quartz and other crystals in Asheville include Points of Light, Enter the Earth, Earth Magick and Cornerstone."
