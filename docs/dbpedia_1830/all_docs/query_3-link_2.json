        "text": "I'm relatively new to orbital mechanics and I know there are a ton of resources and similar questions on the web, but I can't seem to get a straight answer/guidance from any of them.\n\nI have a set of data regarding any particular satellite which consists of the following:\n\nMean motion\n\nMean anomaly\n\nArgument of perigee\n\nEccentricity\n\nInclination\n\nRight Ascension of Ascending Node (RAAN) AKA Longitude of Ascending Node\n\nThis data is extracted using PyEphem library. What I would like to calculate is the longitude, latitude and altitude of the satellite at any given time. I know what each parameter means but I don't know how they relate to my unknowns.\n\nI tried reading papers, tried several simulations and checked out lots of articles about Keplerian elements conversion but I still can't figure out how to connect the dots. The main resources I have been studying are:\n\nhttp://fgg-web.fgg.uni-lj.si/~/mkuhar/Pouk/SG/Seminar/Vrste_tirnic_um_Zemljinih_sat/Keplerian%20Elements%20Tutorial.html#epoch\n\nhttps://au.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/54875-geostationary-satellites-tracking\n\nhttps://au.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/982-gui-based-satellite-tracking-system\n\nand I also read most of the related questions on this website. Would it be easier if I used real-time tracking data instead of using TLE to predict my unknown?\n\nThanks in advance!"
