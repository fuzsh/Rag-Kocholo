        "text": "Dataset Version: 4.1\n\nSummary\n\nThis dataset provides Daymet Version 4 R1 monthly climate summaries derived from Daymet Version 4 R1 daily data at a 1 km x 1 km spatial resolution for five Daymet variables: minimum and maximum temperature, precipitation, vapor pressure, and snow water equivalent. Monthly averages are provided for minimum and maximum temperature, vapor pressure, and snow water equivalent, and monthly totals are provided for the precipitation variable. Each data file is yearly by variable with 12 monthly time steps and covers the same period of record as the Daymet V4 R1 daily data. The monthly climatology files are derived from the larger datasets of daily weather parameters produced on a 1 km x 1 km grid for North America, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Separate monthly files are provided for the land areas of continental North America (Canada, the United States, and Mexico), Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Data are distributed in standardized Climate and Forecast (CF)-compliant netCDF (*.nc) and Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF (*.tif) formats. In Version 4 R1 (ver 4.1), all 2020 and 2021 files (60 total) were updated to improve predictions especially in high-latitude areas. It was found that input files used for deriving 2020 and 2021 data had, for a significant portion of Canadian weather stations, missing daily variable readings for the month of January. NCEI has corrected issues with the Environment Canada ingest feed which led to the missing readings. The revised 2020 and 2021 Daymet V4 R1 files were derived with new GHCNd inputs. Files outside of 2020 and 2021 have not changed from the previous V4 release.\n\nFiles are available in CF-compliant netCDF (*.nc) and Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF (*.tif) formats for three separate spatial areas: continental North America (including Canada, the United States, and Mexico), Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Data for Puerto Rico include years 1950–2023. Data for Continental North America and Hawaii are provided for years 1980–2023.\n\nThere are a total of 1,620 files. Both netCDF and GeoTIFF files are provided: 810 files in netCDF file format and 810 files in Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) file format. Files are arranged by year, variable, and spatial area.\n\nCitation\n\nThornton, M.M., R. Shrestha, Y. Wei, P.E. Thornton, and S-C. Kao. 2022.

Measurements of near-surface meteorological conditions are made at many locations, but researchers are often faced with having to perform ecosystem process simulations in areas where no meteorological measurements have been taken. The continuous gridded surfaces of the Daymet dataset were developed to overcome these limitations.\n\nQuality Assessment\n\nWithin the Daymet algorithm, the Daymet cross-validation analyses were used to test the sensitivity of Daymet methods to the variation of parameters and to estimate the prediction errors associated with the final selected parameters. The leave-one-out cross-validation protocol is to withhold one observation at a time from a sample, generate a prediction error for the withheld case by comparison with observed values within the sample, and repeat over all observations in the sample to generate an average prediction error. Interest is in both the absolute value and the sign of prediction errors generated in this manner.\n\nData Acquisition, Materials, and Methods\n\nData Access\n\nThese data are available through the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC).\n\nDaymet: Monthly Climate Summaries on a 1-km Grid for North America, Version 4 R1\n\nContact for Data Center Access Information:\n\nReferences\n\nDataset Revisions\n\nNote: The ORNL DAAC revised its methods for versioning datasets to be more consistent with data versioning practices at the NASA Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS) and the general Earth Science data community. With the revised versioning strategy, the dataset version number (including both major and minor version numbers) remain unchanged when a release only appends new data and existing data are not changed. At the time of publication of 2023 Daymet data, the version numbers of Daymet datasets, including the Version 4 and prior versions are updated as shown in the revision tables below.\n\nORNL DAAC Version Record for Version 4.1\n\nORNL DAAC Release Date\n\nDaymet Product Version\n\nDescription\n\nJune 14, 2024 Version 4.1 (V4 R1) This release added monthly climatologies for 2023 for each Daymet Version 4.1 variable. March 5, 2023 This release added monthly climatologies for 2022 for each Daymet Version 4.1 variable. November 1, 2022 In this Version 4.1 (V4 R1) release, all 2020 and 2021 files (60 total) were updated to improve predictions especially in high-latitude areas. It was found that input files used for deriving 2020 and 2021 data had, for a significant portion of Canadian weather stations, missing daily variable readings for the month of January. The missing readings have been verified by the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) who maintain the Global Historical Climatology Network daily (GHCNd) database. NCEI has corrected issues with the Environment Canada ingest feed which led to the missing readings and has built in more protections to prevent the loss of data. The revised 2020 and 2021 Daymet V4 files were derived with new GHCNd inputs. Files outside of 2020 and 2021 have not changed.\n\nORNL DAAC Release Record for Version 4\n\nORNL DAAC Release Date\n\nDaymet Product Version\n\nDescription\n\nApril 7, 2022 Version 4 This release added monthly climatologies for 2021 for each Daymet Version 4 variable. April 8, 2021 This release added monthly climatologies for 2020 for each Daymet Version 4 variable. December 15, 2020\n\nThis release provided the monthly climatologies for five Daymet variables for Version 4; minimum and maximum temperature, precipitation, vapor pressure, and snow water equivalent (new in V4)..\n\nORNL DAAC Release Record for Version 3\n\nORNL DAAC Release Date\n\nDaymet Product Version Description March 17, 2020 Version 3 This release added monthly climatologies for 2019 for each Daymet Version 3 variable. April 3, 2019 This release added monthly climatologies for 2018 for each Daymet Version 3 variable. April 19, 2018 This release added monthly climatologies for 2017 for each Daymet Version 3 variable. April 20, 2017 This release added monthly climatologies for 2016 for each Daymet Version 3 variable. July 15, 2016 This release provided new monthly climatologies for all meteorological variables and all years (1980-2015) based on improvements to the Daymet algorithm and expanded geographic coverage at high latitude. Daymet V2 mosaics are now available only upon request.\n\nORNL DAAC Version Record for Version 2"
