        "text": "Faye Goldsmith Posted at 2018-3-29 00:45\n\nyes done that, been to where it says 3 times and searched but can not find it..........not only did we get the error we also lost connection with it\n\nThe functions shows the last know location.\n\nSo when you disconnect, the location won't be updated.\n\nSome questions:\n\n1. Were you flying line of sight? (like, did you see the drone when it initiated RTH)\n\n2. What was your RTH behavior set to?\n\n3. Did you look at the flight logs to see if there were events like 'recording home point' etc.\n\nIt might be best to share the flight log here.\n\nSo other users can take a look at what the Drone said during the flight. This are the co ordinates it has given us -38.358009, 144.925353\n\nYes it was in Line of Sight when it decided to fly.........flew up quickly, wouldn't let us gain control. It had said home was home but it told us it was going to a place that it called home earlier in the day. Then we got the error.\n\nThanks for trying to help us\n\nFaye Goldsmith Posted at 2018-3-29 02:18\n\nThis are the co ordinates it has given us -38.358009, 144.925353\n\nYes it was in Line of Sight when it decided to fly.........flew up quickly, wouldn't let us gain control.

Then we got the error.<<\n\nA thought which I have in mind for quiet some time:\n\nHow far away is the older RTH Point from the location you lost contact?\n\nCould the Spark get there with the battery?\n\nThe last known location, is that between point of \"RTH\" kicked in and the older RTH-Point?\n\nIf yes, extend that line, calculate the rest flight time with a RTH Speed of 38 kph and try to find it further down to this older RTH location.\n\nDo you remember the Starting/RTH point in question?\n\nAnd keep in mind, on 10% battery, it will launch auto landing. So battery life to calculate is rest%age-10!\n\napcyberax Posted at 2018-3-29 05:22\n\nthe log shows it never recorded the RTH when you took off so it had no home point to return to\n\nI noticed that too. Not sure what will happen when it did not record RTH.\n\nMy best guess is that it will fall back to the latest homepoint.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that makes sense judging by the observation from the pilot when it flew away.\n\nMontfrooij Posted at 2018-3-29 05:49\n\nI noticed that too.

Issues like that are normally caused by taking off near a source of magetic metal (like a concrete sidewalk).\n\nOnce in ATTI mode, the Spark started drifting with the wind since it was not able to use the GPS data to hold its position.\n\nThe attempt to initiate RTH failed since the Spark was flying in ATTI mode at that time. The Spark cannot automatically return home when flying in ATTI mode since it's not able to use the GPS data to locate the home point.\n\nAt the end of the flight log, the Spark was flying at an altitude of 120 feet (above the takeoff point) and drifting away with the wind at about 8.5 MPH (3.8 m/s).\n\nAssuming the remote controller disconnected from the Spark at the end of your flight log, the Spark would have attempted to RTH 3 seconds after that point. Since your Spark was flying in ATTI mode, it would have auto landed at its current location instead of attempting to return home. Normally, that location would be close to the last coordinates marked in the flight log. However, since the wind was blowing your Spark away, it would have been drifting as it was auto landing.\n\nSince your Spark was fairly low to the ground and moving slowly, it should be close to the last location in your flight log (-38.35693254,144.9216826). Look for it in the area boxed off in yellow here:\n\nLocation.jpg (0 Bytes, Down times: 34)\n\nDownload attach\n\n2018-3-29 Upload\n\nMontfrooij Posted at 2018-3-29 05:49\n\nI noticed that too.

At that point, if the GPS was off and the craft was malfunctioning it would have drifted itself. Hi\n\nWe really do appreciate your help, have been this morning to the area you have showed us but noone has seen it. Last video contact we had had it go over a freeway but what you show us shows it is this side of freeway. Find my drone also says otherside of freeway. Is it possible for it to have flown back to this side? I have no idea how to find the coordinates like you guys do so can't see if they were recorded early in the flight log.\n\nmsinger Posted at 2018-3-29 17:19\n\nIs there a second flight log file from that flight? The log you uploaded doesn't show your drone anywhere near the highway.\n\nAlso, can you post the video you're referring to?\n\nsorry only the one flight log. Camera was on but wasn't recording so no video sorry. Went to the coordinates this morning, and just now got google maps to take me for a walk, which told me I was there corner of our street, even tho the pin was showing in leash free park, went there (again) stood right were pin is but no drone, ground or trees. Losing hope\n\nFaye Goldsmith Posted at 2018-3-29 18:40\n\nsorry only the one flight log. Camera was on but wasn't recording so no video sorry.
