Lien (GSFC/UMBC), F. E. Marshall (NASA/GSFC), D. M. Palmer (LANL) and M. H. Siegel (PSU) report on behalf of the Swift Team:\n\nAt 01:05:16 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and located GRB 161001A (trigger=714404). Swift slewed immediately to the burst. The BAT on-board calculated location is RA, Dec 71.913, -57.283 which is\n\nRA(J2000) = 04h 47m 39s Dec(J2000) = -57d 16' 57\"\n\nwith an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including systematic uncertainty). The BAT light curve showed a complex structure with a duration of about 3 sec. The peak count rate was ~11000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger.\n\nThe XRT began observing the field at 01:06:21.5 UT, 65.0 seconds after the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find an uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 71.91848, -57.26127 which is equivalent to:\n\nRA(J2000) = 04h 47m 40.44s Dec(J2000) = -57d 15' 40.6\"\n\nwith an uncertainty of 3.9 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This location is 78 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received; the latest position is available at http://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. We cannot determine whether the source is fading at the present time. No spectrum from the promptly downlinked event data is yet available to determine the column density.\n\nUVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter starting 68 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has been found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of the XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.6 mag. The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the XRT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.01.\n\nBurst Advocate for this burst is K. L. Page (klp5 AT leicester.ac.uk). Please contact the BA by email if you require additional information regarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after trying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see Swift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/too.html.)\n\nGCN NOTICE\n\nTITLE: GCN/SWIFT NOTICE NOTICE_DATE: Sat 01 Oct 16 01:19:55 UT NOTICE_TYPE: Swift-UVOT Processed Source List TRIGGER_NUM: 714404, Seg_Num: 0 POINT_RA: 71.951d {+04h 47m 48s} (J2000) POINT_DEC: -57.291d {-57d 17' 28\"} (J2000) POINT_ROLL: 113.691d IMG_START_DATE: 17662 TJD; 275 DOY; 16/10/01 IMG_START_TIME: 4197.20 SOD {01:09:57.20} UT, 280.7 [sec] since BAT Trigger Time FILTER: 7, U BKG_MEAN: 0.447 N_STARS: 60 X_OFFSET: 96 [pixels] Y_OFFSET: 393 [pixels] X_MAX: 1535 [pixels] Y_MAX: 1832 [pixels] DET_THRESH: 6 PHOTO_THRESH: 3 SL_URL: sw00714404000msufc0280.fits SUN_POSTN: 187.63d {+12h 30m 30s} -3.29d {-03d 17' 32\"} SUN_DIST: 100.66 [deg] Sun_angle= 7.7 [hr] (West of Sun) MOON_POSTN: 189.01d {+12h 36m 03s} -1.32d {-01d 18' 58\"} MOON_DIST: 103.06 [deg] MOON_ILLUM: 0 [%] GAL_COORDS: 266.24,-39.10 [deg] galactic lon,lat of the pointing direction ECL_COORDS: 39.23,-77.52 [deg] ecliptic lon,lat of the pointing direction COMMENTS: SWIFT-UVOT Processed Source List.

Leicester) report on behalf of the Swift/UVOT team:\n\nThe Swift/UVOT began settled observations of the field of GRB 161001A 68 s after the BAT trigger (Page et al., GCN Circ. 19967). No optical afterglow consistent with the XRT position (Osborne et al. GCN Circ. 19969) is detected in the initial UVOT exposures. Preliminary 3-sigma upper limits using the UVOT photometric system (Breeveld et al. 2011, AIP Conf. Proc. 1358, 373) for the first finding chart (FC) exposure and subsequent exposures are:\n\nFilter T_start(s) T_stop(s) Exp(s) Mag white_FC 68 218 147 >20.8 u_FC 281 530 246 >20.2 white 68 1183 353 >20.4 v 611 1232 78 >19.1 b 536 1158 58 >19.1 u 281 5994 395 >20.2 w1 661 1282 78 >19.2 m2 636 1257 78 >19.2 w2 1016 1208 39 >19.2\n\nThe magnitudes in the table are not corrected for the Galactic extinction due to the reddening of E(B-V) = 0.01 in the direction of the burst (Schlegel et al. 1998).\n\nGCN Circular #19971\n\nT. Kruehler (MPE Garching), D. Xu (NAOC/CAS), J. Bolmer (MPE Garching and ESO Santiago), K. Wiersema (Univ. Leicester), D. Malesani (DARK/NBI and DTU Space), R. Sanchez-Ramirez (IAA-CSIC), J. P. U. Fynbo (DARK/NBI), report on behalf of a larger collaboration:\n\nWe observed the field of GRB 1601001A (Page et al., GCN 19967) with the ESO Very Large Telescope Unit 2 (Kueyen) equipped with the X-shooter spectrograph.\n\nClose to, but outside, the enhanced XRT position (Osborne et al., GCN 19969), in our acquisition image we detect a bright, pointlike source at coordinates RA = 04:47:40.71, Dec = -57:15:36.8. This source is faintly visible in the archival DSS data and is pointlike in our images (0.75\" seeing).\n\nA spectrum was secured of this object, for a total of 4x600 s, starting on Oct 1.299 UT (6.1 hr after the GRB). The continuum is consistent with a stellar spectrum, and we conclude that this target is not associated with GRB 161001A.\n\nOur slit, at a position angle of 319.6 deg (CCW from north), does however cover a portion of the XRT error circle. Within the wings of the the PSF of the DSS object, approximately 0.8 arcsec SE, we detect a number of emission lines which are consistent with [O II], Hbeta, [O III] and Halpha at a common redshift of z = 0.891, revealing the presence of a background object. While we cannot accurately determine its position from the slit information alone, that is consistent with being at the edge of the XRT error circle. Our images also hint a faint extension of the DSS object at a position consistent with that of the emission lines, which could represent the continuum emission of the object. As such, this is a candidate host galaxy of GRB 161001A.\n\nWe caution that we have no way to confirm the association between the emission line object and the GRB. No variability can be inferred from our data, and as we lack an estimate of the continuum flux, we can not presently quantify the chance association probability.\n\nA finding chart showing the region surrounding the XRT position is shown at this URL: http://www.astro.ku.dk/~malesani/GRB/161001A/GRB161001A_slit.png\n\nWe acknowledge excellent support from the ESO observing staff at Paranal, in particular Zahed Wahhaj, Jonathan Smoker, and Claudia Cid.\n\nGCN Circular #19972\n\nA. Melandri (INAF-OAB), P. D'Avanzo (INAF-OAB), V. D'Elia (ASDC), J.A. Kennea (PSU), B. Sbarufatti (INAF-OAB/PSU), D.N. Burrows (PSU), B. Mingo (U. Leicester), A.P. Beardmore (U. Leicester), P.A. Evans (U. Leicester) and K.L. Page report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:\n\nWe have analysed 6.9 ks of XRT data for GRB 161001A (Page et al. GCN Circ. 19967), from 51 s to 34.6 ks after the BAT trigger. The data comprise 128 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode (the first 7 s were taken while Swift was slewing) with the remainder in Photon Counting (PC) mode. The enhanced XRT position for this burst was given by Osborne et al. (GCN Circ. 19968).\n\nThe late-time light curve (from T0+5.8 ks) can be modelled with a power-law decay with a decay index of alpha=1.40 (+0.17, -0.16).\n\nA spectrum formed from the WT mode data can be fitted with an absorbed power-law with a photon spectral index of 2.07 (+0.16, -0.15). The best-fitting absorption column is 4.9 (+0.9, -0.8) x 10^21 cm^-2, in excess of the Galactic value of 1.1 x 10^20 cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013). The PC mode spectrum has a photon index of 1.90 (+/-0.16) and a best-fitting absorption column of 6.5 (+1.2, -1.1) x 10^21 cm^-2. The counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion factor deduced from this spectrum is 4.6 x 10^-11 (7.4 x 10^-11) erg cm^-2 count^-1.\n\nA summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:\n\nTotal column: 6.5 (+1.2, -1.1) x 10^21 cm^-2 Galactic foreground: 1.1 x 10^20 cm^-2 Excess significance: 9.7 sigma Photon index: 1.90 (+/-0.16)\n\nIf the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of 1.40, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 5.4 x 10^-3 count s^-1, corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 2.5 x 10^-13 (4.0 x 10^-13) erg cm^-2 s^-1.\n\nThe results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/00714404.\n\nThis circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.\n\nGCN Circular #19973\n\nP Veres, M Stanbro and C Meegan (UAH) report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:\n\n\"At 01:05:16.72 UT on 01 October 2016, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor triggered and located GRB 161001A (trigger 496976720 / 161001045) which was also detected by the Swift/BAT (Page et al., GCN 19967). The GBM on-ground location is consistent with the Swift position.\n\nThe angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 37 degrees.\n\nThe GBM light curve consists of a dominant pulse preceded by weaker emission with a duration (T90) of about 2.2 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged spectrum from T0-1.1 s to T0+2.9 s is best fit by a power law function with an exponential high-energy cutoff. The power law index is -0.89 +/- 0.10 and the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 313 +/- 54 keV.\n\nThe event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is (2.3 +/- 0.2)E-6 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured starting from T0+1.2 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 6.9 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.\n\nThe spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary; final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog.\"\n\nGCN Circular #19974\n\nC.

Palmer (LANL), T. Sakamoto (AGU), M. Stamatikos (OSU), T. N. Ukwatta (LANL) (i.e. the Swift-BAT team):\n\nUsing the data set from T-274 to T+962 sec from the recent telemetry downlink, we report further analysis of BAT GRB 161001A (trigger #714404) (Page, et al. GCN Circ. 19967). The BAT ground-calculated position is RA, Dec = 71.923, -57.261 deg which is\n\nRA(J2000) = 04h 47m 41.5s Dec(J2000) = -57d 15' 39.8\"\n\nwith an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).\n\nThe partial coding was 78%.\n\nThe mask-weighted light curve shows several overlapping pulses that stars at ~T-0.3, and ends at ~T+3 s. The highest peak occurs at ~ T+1.6 s. T90 (15-350 keV) is 2.6 +- 0.4 sec (estimated error including systematics).\n\nThe time-averaged spectrum from T-0.2 to T+3.1 sec is best fit by a simple power-law model. The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is 1.14 +- 0.09. The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 6.7 +- 0.4 x 10^-7 erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+1.40 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 3.5 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec. All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.\n\nUsing a 16-ms binned light curve, the lag analysis finds a lag of 7 (+/- 13) ms for the 100-350 keV to 25-50 keV band, and -7.5 (+26, -19) ms for the 50-100 keV to 15-25 keV band, which is consistent with those of a short GRB.\n\nThe results of the batgrbproduct analysis are available at http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_s/714404/BA/\n\nGCN Circular #19976\n\nR.Podesta, C.Lopez, F.

Frederiks, S. Golenetskii, R.Aptekar, P. Oleynik, M. Ulanov, D. Svinkin, A. Tsvetkova, A.Lysenko, A. Kozlova, and T. Cline, on behalf of the Konus-Wind team, report:\n\nGRB 161001A (Swift/BAT detection: Page et al., GCN 19967; Fermi GBM observation: Veres et al., GCN 19973) triggered Konus-Wind at T0=3D3919.479 s UT (01:05:19.479).\n\nThe light curve shows a short pulse with a total duration of ~0.5 s. The emission is seen up to ~5 MeV.\n\nAs observed by Konus-Wind, the burst had a fluence of (1.8 =B1 0.5)x10^-6 erg/cm2 and a 16-ms peak energy flux, measured from T0-0.016, of (8.0 =B1 3.5)x10^-6 erg/cm2 (both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).\n\nThe spectrum of the burst (measured from T0 to T0+0.256 s) is best fit in the 20 keV - 10 MeV range by a cutoff power-law (CPL) function with the following model parameters: the photon index alpha =3D -0.46(-0.36,+0.48), and the peak energy Ep =3D 437(-117,+190) keV, chi2 =3D 30.0/36 dof. Fitting this spectrum with the GRB (Band) function yields the same alpha and Ep with only an upper limit on beta of -2.1, chi2 =3D 30.0/35 dof.\n\nThe Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB161001_T03919/\n\nAll the quoted errors are estimated at the 90% confidence level. All the presented results are preliminary.\n\nGCN Circular #19999\n\nK. L. Murata (Nagoya University), K. Miyakawa (Tokyo Institute of Technology), and T.

We could not detect the afterglow within the enhanced XRT error circle (Osborne et al., GCN Circular #19969) in the three bands. We have obtained the following preliminary upper limits (Vega magnitude system):\n\nJ > 14.61 H > 14.19 Ks > 14.01\n\nGiven magnitudes were calibrated against 2MASS point sources in this field. The upper limits were determined as the magnitudes of the fainter star within 1 arcmin from the enhanced XRT position.\n\nThis observation was carried out by IRSF and OISTER collaboration."
