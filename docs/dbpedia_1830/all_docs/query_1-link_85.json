During this\n\noperation, (the only one in which Escort\n\nDivision 63 acted as a unit with Com. Cort Div.\n\n63 as screen commander) no direct enemy\n\ncontact was made by this ship, although\n\nseveral unidentified aircraft were reported\n\nnear the formation. No attach was made on\n\nthe formation during the time this ship was in\n\nformation. After the ship had been detached\n\nto return to the Admiralty Islands, the U.S.S.\n\nShelton – DE 407 (one of our sister ships) was\n\ntorpedoed & sunk by an enemy submarine.\n\n1st – 12th October 1944\n\nUpkeep & repair at Seeadler Harbor.\n\n12th – 25th October 1944\n\nAt sea as part of escort screen for Task Unit\n\n77.4.3, Northern Air Support Group covering\n\nthe landings on Leyte Island, Philippines on\n\nOctober 20th 1944. This ship was attached to\n\nTask Unit 77.4.34, which furnished air support\n\nfor the Northern Transport Group enroute to\n\nthe objective area. On 20th Oct. 1944 Task Unit\n\n77.4.34 was dissolved and the ships in the unit\n\njoined Task Unit 77.4.3. No enemy contact\n\nwas made by the ships of this unit until 0650\n\nitem on 25th Oct 1944, when an enemy task\n\nforce was sighted 15 miles from the unit,\n\nbetween our ships & Samar Island. As the\n\nfaster enemy task group composed of 4\n\nbattleships, 8 cruisers & 12 destroyers closed\n\nour formation destroyers & destroyer escorts\n\nof our screen interposed to the westward\n\nbetween the enemy & our own carriers. This\n\nship opened fire on the enemy formation at\n\n0740 & continued fire throughout the\n\nengagement with main batteries. A torpedo\n\nattack was made on an enemy cruiser, firing 3\n\ntorpedoes at a range of 8000 yards. On\n\ncompletion of the torpedo run, this ship was\n\nordered to lay a smoke screen between the\n\ncarriers & the enemy. While interposing\n\nbetween our carrier group & the enemy\n\ncruiser, this ship was hit 4 times, 3 direct hits\n\nfrom 6 or 8 inch enemy guns firing armor\n\npiercing shells & one hit from shrapnel. All\n\ndamage was brought under control & when\n\nthe enemy retired to the north, this ship\n\nrejoined the carrier group. When the U.S.S.\n\nSaint-Lo CVE 63 was hit & subsequently sunk,\n\nthis ship effected the rescue of 434 survivors\n\nfrom the sunken carrier. The personnel losses\n\nsuffered were 5 men killed in action & 12 men\n\nwounded in action. The Commanding Officer\n\nLt. Comm. Hansen was awarded the Navy\n\nCross for his heroism during the engagement.\n\nWhile enroute to Kossol Passage, our 5 dead\n\nand one of the rescued survivors, which died\n\novernight, were buried at sea. Shortly after\n\nthe burial ceremonies were complete,\n\ntorpedoes were sighted coming in our direction,\n\nand a rapid port turn saved this ship from total\n\ndisaster as two torpedoes traveled alongside\n\non starboard, within 50 feet of this ship.\n\n25th – 27th October 1944\n\nEnroute to Kossol Passage where survivors A&\n\nhospital cases were discharged. Passed\n\nthrough enemy mine field enroute.\n\n27th – 31st Oct. 1944\n\nAnchored in Kossol Passage. Upkeep & repairs.\n\n10th – 13th Nov. 1944\n\n66 hrs. liberty\n\n21st Nov. 1944\n\nOn draft (as fireman 2nd class)\n\n31st Oct. – 3rd Nov 1944\n\nEnroute to Manus Is. Admiralty Islands.\n\n3rd – 7th November 1944\n\nUpkeep & repairs – Manus Island.\n\n7th – 18th November 1944\n\nEnroute Manus Island to Pearl Harbor, T.H. as\n\npart of screen for CAR-Div 25.\n\n22nd – 25th Nov. 1944\n\nOn troop train enroute Chicago, Ill. to\n\nShoemaker Calif. On train for Thanksgiving\n\nday. Waiter said “1st turkey dinner is on Uncle\n\nSam. If you want a 2nd one you’ll have to pay\n\nfor it.” 3 of us had 2 dinners.\n\n27th November 1944\n\nI passed physical for overseas duty.\n\n20th – 26th November 1944\n\nEnroute Pearl Harbor, T.H. to San Francisco,\n\nCalif., as escort for merchant ship.\n\n26th Nov. – 22 Dec. 1944\n\nAvailability & repair San Francisco, Calif.\n\n1st December 1944\n\nI boarded the U.S.S. Dennis – DE 405 at\n\nAlameda Shipyard, Alameda, Calif. Welding\n\ngoing on all over the ship repairing damage\n\nfrom sea battle. Crew very nervous. Talked\n\nabout the battle. I was assigned a battle\n\nstation on gun 42 as second loader. Gun 42\n\nwas being changed from twin 40 mm to quad\n\n40 mm. I found that the man I replaced was a\n\ncolored fireman who was killed in the sea\n\nbattle. He was decapitated by shrapnel. While\n\nthe ship was in the U.S.A. 23 of the crew went\n\n(AWOL) over the hill.\n\n12th December 1944\n\nLeft Alameda for Mare Is. – Loaded Ammo. –\n\nThen to Treasure Island.\n\n1st – 22nd December 1944\n\nWhile in California had liberty in Oakland and\n\nSan Francisco. George “Red” Geisen from\n\nBuffalo, N.Y. & Al “Cisco” Cofrancisco from\n\nDeep River, Conn. & I went through Great\n\nLakes Basic Engineering School together. We\n\ncame west on the same troop train to\n\nShoemaker, California. From there we were\n\nassigned to the U.S.S. Dennis, Red to the\n\nforward fireroom, me to the aft fireroom &\n\nCisco to the aft engine room. We went on\n\nliberty together to San Francisco, & we bought\n\na pint of what the sailors called Chinese\n\nwhiskey – chen-lee. I drank my 1/3 of the\n\nbottle in one gulp. That was my first taste of\n\nwhiskey. You might say we took Cisco to\n\nFrisco to sow some wild oats before we went to war.\n\n21st December 1944\n\nLast day in the states before going overseas.\n\nOrder of the day – no one is to leave the ship.\n\nDon’t set foot on the dock. Marine guards on\n\nthe dock with submachine guns to enforce the\n\norder. Movie on the fan tail that night.\n\n22nd – 28th December 1944\n\nEnroute San Francisco, Calif. To Pearl Harbor,\n\nT.H. Steaming independently. I was seasick all\n\nthe way. (It started shortly after we lost sight\n\nof Golden Gate Bridge over the horizon)\n\n25th December 1944\n\nChristmas at sea. Captain Hansen awarded\n\npurple heart medals to the men who were\n\nwounded in previous engagement with the enemy.\n\n1st January 1945\n\nMy 1st liberty in Hawaii – Honalulu & Wikiki.\n\nDec. 1944 – March 1945\n\nI was assigned to the mess hall.\n\n28th Dec. 1944 – 12th Jan. 1945\n\nUpkeep & training at Pearl Harbor, T.H.\n\n12th January 1945\n\nLeft Pearl Harbor\n\n12th – 18th Jan. 1945\n\nAt sea conducting rehearsal exercises with\n\nTask Force 51 as part of screen of Transport\n\nGroup Able. I was seasick this week too.\n\n13th January 1945\n\nArrived off Molokai Hawaiian Is. Patrolled off\n\ncoast for mock invasion.\n\n17th January 1945\n\nLeft Molokai with convoy\n\n18th January 945\n\nArrived beach at Oahu\n\n18th – 24th January 1945\n\nUpkeep & training at Pearl Harbor, T.H.\n\n24th January 1945\n\nLeft Hawaii with convoy. The sea was calm & I\n\ndidn’t get seasick. I must have found my sea\n\nlegs – I wasn’t seasick anymore after this.\n\n30th January 1945\n\nCrossed International Date Line. 180o\n\nlongitude. Initiated\n\n6th February 1945\n\nArrived Eniwetok Marshall Islands. Low sandy\n\nislands with few palm trees. Most palm trees\n\nwere shot off at the trunk. When we came\n\ninto the Marshall Islands, I saw more ships\n\nthan I ever saw before. There was every type\n\nof ship here. They were anchored as far as you\n\ncould see (to the horizon) in every direction as\n\nwe sailed through them for 20 minutes to our\n\nanchorage. There must have been hundreds of\n\nships here.\n\n24th Jan. – 20th Feb 1945\n\nAt sea with Task Group 51.5 enroute from\n\nPearl Harbor, T.H. to Iwo Jima. Stops at\n\nEniwetok & Guam, enroute for fueling &\n\nprovisions. The commanding officer\n\n(Commander Hansen) of this ship served as\n\ncommander of screen during this operation.\n\n9th – 13th February 1945\n\nEnroute from Eniwetok to Guam. On this trip I\n\nwas talking to Mr. Tuck one day as we stood at\n\nthe ships rail looking out at the sea. I asked\n\nhim if he know where we were going. He said\n\n“we’re going to invade a place called Iwo\n\nJima”. That was the first time I has ever heard\n\nof the place.\n\n13th – 16th February 1945\n\nAnchored at Guam. A pretty island with\n\nmountains. Went ashore here on loading\n\ndetails & beer party\n\n16th – 20th February 1945\n\nLeft Guam with LST Convoy with marines for\n\ninvasion of Iwo Jima. Slow convoy.\n\nSince leaving the states we had tests of G.Q.\n\n(general quarters) alarm every sunrise &\n\nsunset and another test once or twice a day,\n\nwith verbal orders over the P.A. system\n\nannouncing “testing general alarm – man you\n\nbattle stations”. Then the alarm would be\n\nsounded. On the evening of the 18th of Feb. I\n\nwas washing mess trays from evening chow, in\n\nthe scullery with John Glenn when the G.Q.\n\nalarm went off. We looked at each other for a\n\nsplit second then I said “They didn’t announce\n\nthat they were testing.” I leaped over the split\n\ndoor with a stack of mess trays on the ledge &\n\nmade it to Gun 42 in record time. It’s amazing\n\nhow fast you can move when your scared.\n\nBoogies (unidentified aircraft) in vicinity – no\n\nenemy contact – secured from G.Q. – this was\n\nthe first of many calls to G.Q. most of which\n\nare forgotten but I’ll always remember the first one.\n\n18th February 1945\n\nSighted enemy mine. Sank same with small arms fire & 20 mm.\n\n19th February 1945\n\nD-Day – Iwo Jima\n\n20th February 1945\n\nD-Day + 1. At G.Q. this morning, we saw a\n\nvolcano island. It rose out of the sea to a\n\nheight of a few thousand feet. We are in the\n\nVolcano Islands. This group consists of 3\n\nislands: Iwo Jima the largest, 8 square miles,\n\nhighest elevation Mt. Surabachi 546 ft.\n\nMinami the southernmost island has an\n\nelevation of 3021 ft. (this was the island that\n\nwe saw that morning). The 3rd & northern\n\nmost island is Kita with elevation of 2520 ft.\n\nWe arrived at Iwo Jima this date. It’s 70 miles from Tokyo.\n\nObserved shelling of Island. The sky was\n\nheavily overcast all the time we were here.\n\nEverything seemed colorless & gray. I thought\n\nas I watched the island & all the ships this is\n\njust the way it would look in the newsreels in\n\nthe movies back home – black, gray & shades of gray.\n\n20th Feb. – 1st March 1945\n\nAt sea as part of screen covering the Iwo Jima\n\noperation (Task Group 51.2). During this\n\nperiod, this ship observed considerable anti-\n\naircraft firing, but didn’t take any enemy\n\naircraft under fire. This ship also took part in\n\nhunter killer operations against enemy\n\nsubmarines with other escorts.\n\n21st February 1945\n\nWhile I was off duty I was hanging around by\n\nmy battle station. This was common practice.\n\nIf they came over you didn’t have far to run.\n\nWhile looking through the lookouts binoculars\n\nat the beach I saw a group of our planes dive\n\nbombing a Jap position. They went in singly\n\none after the other. I could see the Jap anti\n\naircraft fire all around them. The third plane in\n\ngot hit before he pulled out of his dive & he\n\nwent straight down and exploded. I handed\n\nthe binoculars back to the lookout and went below.\n\n22nd February 1945\n\nAir raid\n\n23rd February 1945\n\nWent up to hospital. Ship relief, to transfer\n\ngunnersmate who was injured at G.Q. – his\n\nfoot was caught in 5” gun mount. Saw the\n\nmarines on the beach using flame throwers on\n\nJaps in the caves. That morning I was off duty\n\n& at Fun 42 when the captain announced over\n\nthe P.A. system that the U.S. Marines had\n\nraised our flag on top of Mt. Surabachi at 10:38\n\nthat morning. We were off the end of the\n\nisland on Mt. Surabachi side about 2 miles out.\n\nI looked through the binoculars & could see\n\nour flag clearly.\n\n23rd and 24th Feb. 1945\n\nAir raids\n\n1st March 1945\n\nDetached from Task Group 51.2 & reported to\n\nTask Group 52.2, for duty in escort carrier screen.\n\n1st March 1945\n\nLeft our patrol position to escort carriers about 30 miles out.\n\n1 to 9 March 1945\n\nOperating in screen for escort carrier group launching strikes on Iwo Jima.\n\n2nd March 1945\n\nAt 0400 called to G.Q. when I got out on deck it\n\nwas pitch black. The sky was heavily overcast\n\n& there was no light from the moon or stars. I\n\ngroped for the ladder to the torpedo deck\n\nbumping into a couple of men in the dark.\n\nOnce at my station I put my hand up close to\n\nmy face & moved it around. I couldn’t see it.\n\nIt was so dark it didn’t make any difference if\n\nyou had your eyes opened or closed, you\n\ncouldn’t see anything anyway. In spite of the\n\ndark, everyone was at his station within a\n\ncouple of minutes. This is a good crew. As I\n\nstood at my station there was a sudden\n\nexplosion & flash of light on the main deck\n\nbelow us. Someone said “we’re hit”.\n\nA minute later we felt the friendly vibrations of\n\ndepth charge going off. What we saw & heard\n\nwas the K guns below firing depth charges at a\n\nsub. We never will know if we hit him or not.\n\n3rd March 1945\n\nWhile on patrol saw object in the water.\n\nMoved in to investigate. The air was filled\n\nwith a sickening smell. It was a body in a life\n\njacket. We caught it with a grappling hock\n\nfrom the bow and pulled it up to the deck. It\n\nwas the torso in the jacket – no head, no arms\n\nor legs. The executive officer shouted up at\n\nthe Captain on the bridge “It has Japanese\n\nwriting on it”. The Captain said “Throw that\n\nthing back in and let’s get out of here.” I\n\nwatched it float past and wondered, as I guess\n\nthe rest of us did, if I might wind up like that\n\none of these days. As we picked up speed and\n\nmoved away from area we were glad to get a breath of fresh air.\n\n9 to 11 March 1945\n\nEnroute to Ulithi Harbor, Western Carolines.\n\n11th March 1945\n\nNearing the western Caroline Islands. It was\n\nmorning and the sea was like a green sheet of\n\nglass. It was that calm and that color. We\n\nsighted a bright colored object on the horizon\n\nas we went towards it, the only ripple on the\n\nwater was from our wake. We pulled up\n\nalongside the object that we now saw was a\n\nhuge life raft. It was riddled with holes &\n\nsubmerged except for a foot or two that had\n\nan air pocket and held it afloat. This bubble is\n\nwhat we first sw. I stood at the rail above the\n\nlife raft as we came up to it and stopped. Dow\n\nin the green clear water circling the raft was a\n\nhuge white shark. He had to be 20 foot long or\n\nbigger. I figure that’s how long the raft was &\n\nhe was just as big. As we lay still in the water\n\nyou couldn’t help but get a little nervous –\n\nwe’re a sitting duck for a sub right now. Our\n\nsister ship, the U.S.S. Shelton DE407, was\n\ntorpedoed by a Jap submarine under less\n\nfavorable circumstances (for the sub) and we\n\nsee below us in the water what is waiting if we\n\nshould be sunk. I looked at the holes in the\n\nraft and wondered about the men we didn’t\n\nsave. The Islands of Yap and Truk are in this\n\ngroup and are still held by the Japanese. If we\n\nhave any air raids while in Ulithi the enemy\n\nplans will be coming from them. We were at a\n\ndead stop for 2 or 3 minutes. We started off\n\nslowly and the show wasn’t over yet. As we\n\nmoved out a school of large fish, each one\n\nabout 3 foot long, started passing under our\n\nship. They were racing. They kept coming for\n\nabout 5 minutes. There were thousands of\n\nthem. As the end of the school approached we\n\ncould see why they were in a hurry. There\n\nwere 8 or 10 sharks each about 5 foot long\n\nchasing the school.\n\n11th March 1945\n\nArrived Ulithi, in the western Carolines. A\n\npretty group of tropical island in a green sea,\n\nabout 9o above the equator.\n\n11th to 20th March 1945\n\nCarrying out logistics & upkeep, Ulithi.\n\nWhile at Ulithi we had a couple of beer parties\n\non Mog Mog Island. You get two or three cans\n\nof beer which go down pretty quick in this\n\nheat. A lot of heavy gambling goes on. It’s\n\nnice to set foot on dry land again but after a\n\nfew hours in the heat it’s good to be going\n\nback out to the ship where there’s a breeze.\n\nOn one trip ashore I took a long walk on the\n\nbeach away from everyone. I saw a native\n\nfisherman in an outrigger. We waved to each\n\nother. I walked further & came across a\n\nwrecked landing barge about 30 yards out. I\n\nstripped down and swam out to it. It was nice\n\non the barge. Very peaceful. The water was\n\nso clear I could see all kinds of fish & coral on\n\nthe bottom about 20 feet below. I had a nice\n\nb.a. swim & got a very B-A-D sunburn.\n\nWhile at Ulithi I saw the prettiest sunset I’ve\n\never seen or hope to see again. The red ball of\n\nfire going down into the sea of green splashed\n\nthe clouds with the colors of the rainbow.\n\n18th March 1945\n\nSunday – went to church on Ulithi. The chapel\n\nwas a native type structure with a high grass\n\nroof. The posts along the sides supported the\n\nroof. There were no walls.\n\n21st to 25th March 1945\n\nAt sea, enroute to Okinawa with Task Group\n\n52.1 as part of escort carrier screen.\n\n21st March 1945\n\nLeft Ulithi with carriers\n\n25th March 1945\n\nArrived Okinawa. D-Day minus 7 days\n\nAt sea in assigned carrier strike area near\n\nOkinawa, screen escort carriers of support air\n\ngroup (Task 5.1.1) for invasion. Sank 2nd mine today.\n\nNote\n\nJulius Tueckhardt\n\nA short stocky fellow in his late 20’s from Brooklyn, N.Y. He was a\n\nlittle loud at times, but what a pair of eyes. Julie was a seaman and\n\ndid his watch on the bridge, as a lookout.\n\nThere was a story around the ship of a time a boogie (unidentified\n\naircraft) was reported 50 miles away. Old eagle eye Tueckhardt raised\n\nhis binoculars to his eyes and sounded off “I can see him”. We all got\n\na big laugh out of that. But we didn’t laugh the night he was on the\n\n0400 to 0800 watch. There was a moderate sea with a moonlit sky.\n\nHe spotted a mine in the water dead ahead of us. We hung around\n\nthe area until daylight and sunk it with gunfire.\n\nThank you Julie and God bless you.\n\n27th March 1945\n\nWas called general quarters 5 times today. (If\n\nthis keeps up somebody’s liable to get hurt.)\n\n28th March 1945\n\nFinished my 3 months of mess hall duty.\n\nStarted standing watches in aft fire room. My\n\nwatch was made up of: falls 3C WT in charge;\n\nJenkins on evaps; Kornwiski on feedwater\n\nthrottle & Cafferty burnerman.\n\n30th March 1945\n\nOur radio picked up an observation plane over\n\nOkinawa. He was directing the shelling by our\n\nbattlewagons off at sea. We were in the\n\nmess hall having noon chow when they piped\n\nthis over the radio. Today is Good Friday, 3\n\ndays before D-Day.\n\n31st March 1945\n\nDetached & ordered to report to Task Unit 5.2.1.2.\n\nConvoys arriving today.\n\n1st April 1945\n\nEaster Sunday – April Fool’s Day and D-Day on\n\nOkinawa. A formation of flying forts flew over\n\nour ship on the way to Okinawa. They were\n\nmiles high. We could just about see them. I\n\nnever saw planes fly so high before.\n\n1st – 2nd April 1945\n\nEnroute with U.S.S. Saginaw Bay (CVE-82) to\n\nKerama Retto for logistics. Shortly after arrival\n\nall ships went to battle stations to repel enemy\n\nair attack. At 0859, April 2, 1945, one enemy\n\naircraft which apparently was making a suicide\n\nrun on the Saginaw Bay, was after intense A.A.\n\nfire by ships further out, observed to crash in\n\nwater about 50 feet from an LST anchored one\n\nmile away from this ship.\n\n1st – 2nd April 1945\n\nLeft southern part of Okinawa for Karama\n\nRetto. (Secured March 26th 1945.) We call this\n\nplace ‘Suicide Bay’. A name well earned. For\n\nthe past week never a day went by without 30\n\nor 40 jap suicide planes comer over. We were\n\ntied up alongside a landing craft type\n\nammunition barge taking on ammo, when a\n\njap came over. I was assigned to the loading\n\npart on the barge. When the G.Q. alarm\n\nsounded we men on the barge were told to say\n\nwhere we were. I look around. There was\n\nnothing but shells & powder canisters. 5”\n\nshells, 8” shells & I was standing on shells for\n\nbattelleships big guns that were bigger than I\n\nwas. The plane made a suicide run on our\n\ncarrier that was off our starboard side. He\n\nmust have overshot his mark because he flew\n\nright over us, and went for an amphibious\n\nammunition ship on our port side. (I guess it\n\nwas an ammo ship – she was flying baker).\n\n(Baker = red flag signal flag for letter B).\n\nThere was a lot AA fire & I was told he crashed\n\ninto the water near the LST on the other side\n\nof us. We finished loading supplies & left to\n\njoin the other carriers the next morning.\n\nKerama Retto was an atoll type island with\n\nhigh rocky sides and lots of vegetation. It had\n\na large lagoon and it provided an anchorage\n\nfor a large number of ships. Ships that were\n\ndamaged by suicide planes were towed in\n\nhere. I saw a large supply ship here that hit a\n\nmine. It took some chunk off the bow.\n\nAnother time we saw a tin can that took a\n\nkamakazi hit on the bridge. The deck was\n\nwiped clean right back to the stack. It killed all\n\nthe officers except the engineering officer. He\n\nbrought the ship in with after steering. This\n\nship was the U.S.S. Hazelwood DD531. That\n\nWarren Schmitt later served on in Korea in the\n\n50s. (Warren was friend of ours who we met\n\nwhen moved to Hastings.) Another time at\n\nKerama Retto, a jap swam out at night from\n\nthe island and climbed up the anchor chain of\n\none of our cruisers. He ran down the deck and\n\nstabbed the O. D. (officer of the day) killing\n\nhim. He then dove into the water and swam\n\nto shore. After that when we came in here\n\novernight, we had a shotgun watch on the bow\n\nand on the fain tail. I took my turn at this watch.\n\n3rd April 1945\n\nRejoined air support group. Sank floating\n\nmine. Formation attacked by enemy planes,\n\ntwo of which made suicide dives on U.S.S.\n\nWake Island (CVE-65) with resultant near miss\n\ndamage. During action, two flight deck\n\ncrewmen fell overboard in parked Wake Island\n\nplane and were shortly thereafter picked up by\n\nthis vessel. This ship did not open fire on\n\nenemy planes which were on foul bearing on\n\nthe other side of formation. Ordered to\n\nproceed to Kerama Retto with U.S.S. Wake\n\nIsland for her emergency repairs.\n\nWhile out with carriers, 4 jap planes came\n\nover. Our planes got one. One was shot\n\ndown. The other two made unsuccessful\n\nsuicide dives on the Wake Island (the carrier\n\ndirectly in front of us). One plane avoided by\n\nmaking a sharp turn, but a bomb hit the water\n\nclose to the carrier causing her to rupture\n\nbelow the water line. The sharp turn caused\n\nplanes on her deck to turn over and smashed\n\ninto each other. One plane fell over the side\n\nwith two men. Our ship, being closest, picked\n\nup the 2 men. The second man to be picked up\n\nwas on some floating wreckage. At first he\n\nappeared to Japanese. The first lieutenant\n\nstood at the rail with a 45 automatic. We\n\nthought the guy was one of the jap pilots that\n\ncrashed. He must have seen the gun and\n\nhollered up “Hey – I’m an Indian – I’m more an\n\nAmerican than you are”. We picked him up.\n\n4th April 1945\n\nRejoined escort carrier group.\n\nNote: These T.U. consisted of 6 CVE (baby flat\n\ntops) & 7 escort ships (D.E.& D.D.s)\n\n7th April 1945\n\nLeft carrier group with 2 carriers and escort to\n\nrendezvous with carriers joining Task Unit\n\n52.1.2. Enemy plane intercepted by cap and\n\nshot down close aboard friendly carrier 3 miles\n\noff this formation.\n\nWhile taking 2 CVEs to rendezvous point we\n\npassed to CVLs. A jap plane (a betty) came\n\nover and was downed by corsairs from the\n\nother carriers. He hit the water with a terrific explosion.\n\n8th April 1945\n\nRejoined carrier group. On returning from bombing the\n\nbeach, plane from our carriers would sometimes horse\n\naround and dogfight each other in the sky over\n\nour group after a successful mission. One\n\nevening we were called to battle stations.\n\nBefore our planes returned from the beach.\n\nShortly after some of our planes returned in a\n\nplayful mood. One made a dive at the radar\n\natop our mast. Another flew along our\n\nstarboard side about 20 feet above the water\n\nand 100 fee off our ship. Our guns were\n\nloaded and trained on them. As the plane flew\n\npast our quad 40 mm. We hollered “Fire!\n\nFire!” The man on the trigger turned and said\n\n“It’s one of ours”.\n\nAnother time we were called to quarters. We\n\nwere called to quarters one evening. Guns\n\nwere loaded. Boogies were reported at a\n\ndistance. The distance increased. They were\n\nafter another target. We secured from\n\nquarters. That night I had the 12 to 4 watch.\n\nThe next morning, I was sleeping in, when they\n\nannounced of the P.A. system that the aft 5”\n\ngun would be unloaded through the muzzle.\n\nMy bunk was right next to the lower handing\n\nroom of the 5’ fun. I was sound asleep when\n\nthey fired. I jumped up. The compartment\n\nwas filled with the smell of gun powder and no\n\none was around. I grabbed my life belt and\n\ntook off through 2 compartments in my skivy\n\nshorts and was headed up the ladder to the\n\nmain deck when someone hollered “Hey\n\nCafferty, where are you going?” He told me\n\nwhat happened and I went back to bed.\n\n9th April 1945\n\nEnroute to Karama Retto with carrier for\n\nreplenishment. Took on mail from another DE,\n\nwhose captain was Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jr.\n\n10th – 11th April 1945\n\nLogistics in Kerama Retto & rejoined carrier group.\n\nIt became common to be called to battle\n\nstations a number of times every day and night\n\nby the G.Q. (General Quarters) alarm bell. It\n\nwas about 0400 when I was awakened by the\n\nsound of the bell. I was awakened from a\n\nsound sleep. I pulled myself up, but before\n\n(bunks were 3 high. I had the bottom bunk, by\n\na compartment door. There was a red battle\n\nlamp by door. It came on when regular lights\n\nwere turned off.) I could swing around to get\n\nout of my sack. I could see by the red light of\n\nthe battle lantern below my bunk that\n\neveryone was still sleeping. The ship rolled\n\nalong and the bunks creeked back and forth. I\n\ncould still hear a distant bell ringing in my ear.\n\nI laid back down and as my head hit the pillow,\n\nthe G.Q. alarm went off. As I leaped up with\n\neveryone else, I thought to myself “My God!\n\nNow I’m hearing the alarm before it goes off”.\n\n(ESP - ?)\n\nApril 12th 1945\n\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt died and\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt, Jr.’s ship left the group\n\nPlanes from our carriers intercepted jap planes\n\non their way to us and downed 14 of them in\n\nan air battle. The rest got away. We lost no\n\nplanes. The Captain announced over the P.A. system.\n\n15th April 1945\n\nEscorting carrier to Kerama Retto for\n\nreplenishment. (To pick up mail for our group\n\n& food, ammo & fuel)\n\n16th April 1945\n\nLogistics, upon return from Kerama Retto,\n\nC.A.B (combat air patrol) shot down enemy\n\nplane at dusk, approximately 2 ½ miles away.\n\nEnemy plane burned in water and explosion\n\nfelt as from depth charge depth charge detonating.\n\nTook carrier to Kerama Retto. Up leaving\n\naround sundown, a jap plan was spotted. The\n\nplanes from the carrier were off bombing\n\nOkinawa. He circled our position on the\n\nhorizon. It was a torpedo bomber. The man\n\non the phones said we got orders from the\n\ncarrier to stay between the carrier and his fish.\n\nAt the moment we were expendable. As I\n\nstood cuddling my greasy 40 mm clip and\n\ncursing that jap, my life flashed before me. As\n\nhe came in for a landing, he circled and went\n\nafter the jap. The torpedo bomber was making\n\nhis run on us and we were running along side\n\nour carrier protecting her. I was scared. Even\n\nif our plane gets him, if he get that fish off first,\n\nwe’ll have to take it if there is any danger to\n\nour carrier. Frank Dibella said to me “Cafferty,\n\nI’m scared.” The big Indian on the other side\n\nof Frank said “Shut up – we’re all scared”. For\n\na second I felt good. We watched and cursed\n\nas the drama which we were very much a part\n\nof unfolded before us. The jap was about 2 ½\n\nmiles from us flying about 10 feet off the\n\nwater, over a fairly calm sea as our man made\n\nhis strafing run. He got him. We let out a\n\nholler as the jap hit the water burning. He\n\nburned for about 20 minutes before he blew\n\nup. We neared the wreckage in time to see it\n\nsink and a lot of us were still cursing it.\n\n17th April 1945\n\nRejoined carrier group.\n\nOur radio often picked up Tokyo Rose and we\n\nwould hear her on the radio in the mess hall at\n\nchow time. She played all the popular songs of\n\nthe time in between little propaganda pitches.\n\nOne evening we went to general quarters and\n\nthere was a jap plane over the horizon. He\n\nwould pick up enough altitude to see us, and\n\nwe him, the drop back below the horizon. He\n\ndidn’t attack us. I didn’t realize it at the time\n\nbut this was an observation plane counting the\n\nships in our group. The next day Tokyo Rose,\n\nin reporting the news, stated that the Imperial\n\nJapanese Air Force attached our group giving\n\nour location and number and types of ships\n\nand said the Imperial Japanese Air Force sank\n\nus all. I guess this was just their way of letting\n\nus know that they know where we were at.\n\nHell, we know that they know where we were.\n\nThey visited us often enough. In another\n\npropaganda pitch, Tokyo Rose told us that\n\nthere were 13,000,000 men in the U.S. Armed\n\nForces. Of these a million were\n\noverseas, and of these so many hundred\n\nthousands were involved in actual combat.\n\nSuckers! Wouldn’t you like to go home?\n\n22nd April 1945\n\nMade three hedgehog attacks on underwater\n\nsound contact originally picked up by adjacent\n\nescort. Negative results. Assisted other escort\n\nin carrying out retiring search plan for nine\n\nhours on contact with negative results. Rejoined formation.\n\nSub contact – Hunted sub all day with tin can –\n\nnever got him though.\n\n23rd April 1945\n\nProceeding to Kerama Retto with carrier.\n\n24th – 25th April 1945\n\nLogistics in Kerama Retto. Rejoined group.\n\n26th April 1945\n\nLeft group with carrier on special duty.\n\nExploded horned type contact mine.\n\nSighted another mine, started shooting at\n\nsame with 20 mm guns and small arms fire.\n\nShe was off our starboard side in a sea of\n\nheavy swells. As we fired at the mine, our ship\n\ndrifted in closer. Then it exploded. Shrapnel\n\nlanded all over the ship. Some even flew over\n\nour ship and landed hundreds of feet off our\n\nport side. A piece as big as my helmet flew\n\nhundreds of feet into the air and dropped on\n\nthe bridge. When the mine was sighted, I was\n\nwatching from the forward 40 mm gun mount\n\nnear the bridge. When it exploded there was a\n\nwhite cloud of smoke as high as a five story\n\nbuilding. I dove under the twin 40 mm, and\n\nlooked up to see this chunk of shrapnel drop\n\non the bridge.\n\n27th April 1945\n\nRendezvoused with joining carrier. Rejoined\n\nair strike group.\n\n29th – 30th April – 1st May ‘45\n\nTask Unit 52.1.2 dissolved and absorbed into\n\n52.1.1. Detached from Task Unit 52.1.1 and\n\njoined Task Unit 52.1.3. Detached on\n\nindependent duty to rendezvous with Task\n\nGroup 50.8 to transfer pilots for replacement planes.\n\n2nd May 1945\n\nRejoined carrier formation.\n\n3rd May 1945\n\nEnroute Kerama Retto with carrier U.S.S.\n\nSangamon – CVE-26 for logistics.\n\n4th May 1945\n\nLogistics in Kerama Retto. Upon departure,\n\nthe formation, composed of U.S.S. Sangamon –\n\nCVE-w6, U.S.S. Fullam – DD474 and this ship\n\nwas attacked by enemy planes. This ship was\n\nfirst to open fire and fired continuously\n\nthroughout the approach of the first plane\n\nwhich missed the carrier by a matter of feet in\n\na suicide dive. Thereafter, the carrier and\n\ndestroyer commenced fire on two enemy\n\naircraft. One plane crashed on the carrier’s\n\nflight deck resulting in a serious fire and severe\n\naccompanying explosions. The Fullam later\n\nreported destroying the plan which they had\n\nunder fire. This ship, together with the Fullam,\n\nwas proceeding to the aid of the stricken\n\ncarrier, but was ordered to stand clear and\n\npick up survivors. The carrier was saved after\n\nan hour and a half only by the superb damage\n\ncontrol and fire fighting of it own personnel,\n\npersonnel of the Fullam and another destroyer\n\nwhich came out of Kerama Retto to assist. In\n\nthe meantime, this ship picked up 68 survivors\n\nin the darkness and its motor whaleboat\n\nreported delivering an additional 20 to rescue\n\nvessels which had come out from Kerama\n\nRetto to assist. The ship also received credit\n\nfor the destruction of the first suicide plan\n\nwhich was also fired upon by the Sangamon.\n\n(Commander Hansen – our captain received\n\nthe bronze star for this action)\n\nNote: On rereading this I want to add this\n\nnote. While in the war zone there were two\n\nthings that a ship should never do:\n\n1.) Never stop dead in the water\n\n2.) Never show a light at night. No smoking\n\nallowed on deck after dark.\n\nIn picking up men from the U.S.S. Sangamon\n\nthe U.S.S. Dennis stopped dead in the water\n\nand turned on its searchlights to aid in picking up 88 men.\n\nTook Sangamon – CVE 26 to Kerama Retto.\n\nTook on supplies. As we left in late afternoon\n\nbefore sunset, we had report of boogies at 60\n\nmiles and closing. Each succeeding report\n\nbrought them closer. At flash red condition\n\nyellow, we were called to battle stations.\n\nShortly later they arrived. The sky had patches\n\nof low clouds. Te first one came diving out of\n\nthe clouds and there we were dead ahead of\n\nhim on a 45o angle. The carrier was astern of\n\nus and to starboard less than half a mile away.\n\nI looked up and saw him and it looked to me as\n\nif he was making his dive right at me. We\n\nstarted firing and didn’t stop until 40 mm\n\nammo racks were empty. The plane banked\n\nand went for carrier. We must of hit him. The\n\nsmoke was streaming from his tail when he\n\ncrashed into the water right along side the\n\ncarrier. A few minutes later another jap\n\nappeared on starboard side and then\n\ndisappeared into the clouds again. The carrier\n\nfired into the clouds. A second later a jap\n\nplane dropped out of the clouds, went straight\n\nfor the carrier. I saw him drop his bomb on the\n\nflight deck and go right in after it. A terrific\n\nexplosion followed. Flames flew a hundred\n\nfeet upwards. Columns of black smoke\n\nblackened the sky. It all happened so fast. Our\n\nguns couldn’t fire at the second plane without\n\nhitting the carrier. Gun 42’s ammo racks were\n\nempty from the first plane, and we were\n\nhaving more ammos passed up from down\n\nbelow. We headed for the carrier to help\n\nextinguish the flames. A tin can cut across our\n\nbow and ordered our skipper to pick up\n\nsurvivors. (Thank God for that.) The ammo on\n\nthe carrier was now going off. The sky around\n\nthe burning ship was filled with tracer fire.\n\nThe next day when we saw that can, we could\n\nsee where she was hit by exploding ammo and\n\nwe heard some of her men were injured. We\n\nsecured from quarters to pick up survivors.\n\nThe calm water helped a great deal. In all we\n\npicked up 88 men. When it got dark, we\n\nturned on our search lights to find them. I\n\nhelped one fellow aboard whose face was very\n\nbadly burned, I’ll never forget him. I brought\n\nhim below to doc. Another survivor praised\n\nthe output of our quad 40. He said he never\n\nsaw so much ammo thrown up so quickly. I\n\ntold him I was passing ammo on that gun and\n\nwe moved it as fast as we could. In the\n\ndarkness you could see the little lights from\n\nthe flash lights on their life preservers and\n\nhear their whistles in the sea all around us.\n\nWe worked at picking up survivors until there\n\nwere no more to be found. The men\n\nremaining on the carrier put out the fire. I’ll\n\nnever know how.\n\n5th May 1945\n\nRejoined carrier group. Detached with\n\nSangamon which was proceeding for\n\nemergency repairs to Ulithi. (Western\n\nCarolines) During the Okinawa operations,\n\nthere were numerous air alerts, but due to the\n\nsterling work of the C.A.P., only one group of\n\nenemy planes made contact with the carrier\n\ngroups in company with this ship. This contact\n\nresulted only near miss damage to one carrier.\n\n(the Wake Island.)\n\nOur main contacts with the enemy came when\n\nwe were detached with one carrier enroute to\n\nor returning from, or at Keramam Retto. We\n\nwent in average once a week.\n\nLeft Okinawa area on May 5, 145 with the\n\nSangamon CVE 26.\n\nMay 30th 1945\n\nAdditional recollections from notes I recently\n\ncame across Ulithi memorial day. Tied up along side\n\nmerchant ship carrying ammo. Holiday –\n\nMerchant seamen don’t work – had to go over\n\nand load ammo ourselves.\n\nMass on troopship before invasion – general\n\nabsolution – no fasting. Remember the\n\nincident but not the date or what invasion it proceeded.\n\n9th – 18th May 1945\n\nLogistics and routine upkeep in Ulithi.\n\n19th – 26th May 1945\n\nOn early warning radar picket station, south of\n\nUlithi, Western Carolines.\n\n26th – 28th May 1945\n\nUlithi Harbor – logistics.\n\nWhile enroute conducted firing exercises and\n\nother drills. Our 5” shot down one of their\n\ndrones and was complimented on their\n\nmarksmanship by the battlewagon’s skipper.\n\n6th – 8th June 1945\n\nConducted unsuccessful search for two of\n\nU.S.S. Tennessee’s reconnaissance planes.\n\n8th – 10th June 1945\n\nEnroute to Okinawa.\n\n10th June 1945\n\nAnchored in Okinawa. Enroute to join Taks Unit 32.1.1.\n\nArrived at Okinawa. Observed shelling. Went\n\nto Kerama Retto then picked up carrier.\n\n11th June 1945\n\nRejoined escort carrier air strike group.\n\nSighted object in water. Picked up same. Was\n\nlanding gear off jap plane. Tire held it afloat.\n\nThere was Japanese writing on tire.\n\n13th June 1945\n\nSank another mine with 20 mm and small arms fire.\n\n16th June 1945\n\nEnroute to Kerama Retto for carrier replenishment.\n\n17th June 1945\n\nLieutenant Commander Stanley N. Gleis, USNR\n\nrelieved Commander Sigurd Hansen, USNR as\n\ncommanding officer during replenishment stay\n\nat Kerama Retto. Steaming to rejoin carrier group.\n\nHad change of command ceremony at Kerama\n\nRetto. Today is my 19th birthdeay.\n\n18th – 26th June 1945\n\nAt sea with escort carrier group. Detached 22\n\nJune to proceed to Ulithi.\n\nNote:\n\nSailors who served on destroyers (designated\n\nDDs) also called cans or tin cans, destroyer\n\nescorts (Des) and smaller ships were said to be\n\nin the dungaree navy.\n\nOn larger ships the men would have to wear\n\nwhat was call the uniform of the day. On our\n\nship, men were allowed to wear whatever part\n\nof the dungaree uniform that was appropriate\n\nfor weather conditions. In the southern\n\nlatitudes, this would usually mean shoes &\n\nshorts. The white uniform was only called for\n\non special occasions.\n\nA few years ago, around 1995 while at a\n\nreunion, a number of my shipmates were\n\nsitting around chatting. Frank Tyrrell who has\n\nserved as first Lt. raised the question – does\n\nanyone remember when Capt. Hansen retired\n\nand Capt. Gleis took command? I said I can tell\n\nyou. It was June 17th 1945. They were all\n\namazed & said how did you remember that. I\n\nsaid it was my 19th birthday. We were all\n\ndressed in our whites for the occasion. As we\n\nstood at attention for inspection, I remember\n\nsmiling and thinking to myself, “Isn’t it nice\n\neveryone’s dressed up for my birthday.”\n\nCaptain Hansen was a tug boat captain before\n\nthe war & was probably retired for age.\n\n26th – 30th June 1945\n\nLogistics and maintenance in Ulithi.\n\n30th June 1945\n\nEnroute to Guam with mail and passengers.\n\n1st – 4th July 1945\n\nLogistics in Guam. Received orders to report\n\nto commander Philippine sea frontier.\n\n4th – 5th July 1945\n\nEnroute to Ulithi\n\n5th – 8th July 1945\n\nAnchored in Ulitthi\n\n8th – 12th July 1945\n\nEnroute to Subic Bay, Philippine Islands in\n\ncompany with U.S.S. Eastland (APA-163) &\n\nU.S.S. Eastland, U.S.S. R.W. Herdon (AD-\n\n121)and other escorts.\n\nRudyard Kipling wrote of “The Road to\n\nMandalay Where the Flying Fish Play.” While\n\nsailing through the San Bernardino Straights,\n\nwe saw the flying fish at play, and in the\n\nmorning we would find a number of them on\n\nour decks. At times schools of porpoise would\n\nrace our ship. While going through these\n\nstraights, we saw a volcano in the distance\n\nwith a column of smoke rising from it. While\n\nat sea, a number of times we saw water\n\nspouts, sometimes two or three together. We\n\nwould just alter course and sail around them.\n\nJuly 12th 1945\n\nArrived at Subic Bay, Philippine Islands, with troop ships.\n\nThat night while in port, we saw a movie on\n\nthe fantail. While the movie was on we could\n\nhear the gunfire in the mountains around us\n\nand see the light from exploding shells.\n\n12th – 16th July 1945\n\nAvailability in Subic Bay, P.I.\n\nWhile in Subic Bay, we would often see\n\nLightsey, Signalman 1C signal to his brother\n\nwho was a signal man on a cruiser that\n\nhappened to be in port at that time.\n\nNow Lightsey was a man who if you ever\n\nserved with him you would never forget him.\n\nFirst, his name. Not one you hear very often, if\n\nat all. Second, his home. He came from\n\nOkeechobee, Florida. Third, his appearance.\n\nHe had red hair, a full red beard and a big\n\nbarrel chest covered with curly red hair. He\n\nwould have been perfectly cast as a pirate in one\n\nof Errol Flynn’s swashbuckler movies. On a\n\nD.E. with a crew of 200 that you live with all\n\nday every day it doesn’t take long to get to\n\nknow everyone, his name, where he’s from,\n\nwhat he did in civilian life, etc. etc. etc. The\n\nday the japs surrendered, I passed Lightsey on\n\nthe main deck and did a double take. He had\n\nshaved off his beard. It was like we had taken\n\non a new crew member over night. A\n\nshipmate told me he had been in from the\n\nbeginning and said he wasn’t going to shave\n\nuntil the war was over.\n\nSad Footnote:\n\nAfter the war I knocked around with different\n\njobs. I finally settled down working in power\n\nplants, doing the job I learned in the Navy. I\n\nwas working for N.Y.C. Dept. of Correction. A\n\nnumber of Navy vets who were correction\n\nofficer were joining the Navy reserves. It\n\nlooked like a good deal at the time. In 1949, I\n\njoined the inactive Navy reserves. In June\n\n1950, the North Koreans invaded the South.\n\nHarry Truman called up the reserves. In Sept.\n\n1950, I got my notice. In Oct. 1950, I was in\n\nPort Lyaute in French Morocco, North Africa in\n\na C.B. detachment. One day while standing on\n\nthe chow line, a cook walked by with the name\n\nLightsey on the4 back of his T-shirt. A fellow\n\nfrom my outfit that was standing next to me\n\nknew him. I asked him if he came from Florida.\n\nHe said he did. I said I have to talk with him.\n\nWhen inside, I got ahold of the cook and said\n\n“I see your name is Lightsey. Do you happen\n\nto come from Florida?” He said yes, but how\n\ndid you know that. I said “Did you happen to\n\nhave a relative on the 405?” He said yes that\n\nwould have been my brother, Big Red. I said\n\n“How is he?” He said he’s dead. After he got\n\nout he was to be married. He was at a\n\nbachelor’s party with a bit of drinking. He\n\nsmashed up his car on the way home and was\n\nkilled. He went all through the war only to be\n\nkilled in an auto accident afterwards.\n\nSecond footnote:\n\nAt one of our reunions, one of our\n\nshipmates, John Hindes, who stayed in the\n\nNavy found himself in South Florida after the\n\nwar. He thought he would look up Lightsey.\n\nHe stopped at a gas station in the Okeechobee\n\narea and said I’m looking for a fellow named\n\nLightsey. The attendant told him everybody\n\naround here is named Lightsey.\n\nP.S. The cook from Port Lyaute was the signal\n\nman from Subic Bay, P.I. He had stayed in the\n\nNavy & had changed his rate to cooking.\n\n16th – 23rd July 1945\n\nEnroute to Okinawa as escort for T.U. 72.10.3\n\n(13 LSTs and crash boats). Due to bad\n\nweather, convoy was diverted and delayed\n\nand crash boats detached. Convoy proceeded to Okinawa.\n\nThis was one of three typhoons that we rode\n\nout. On one, we headed into the storm and at\n\nthe end of the day we were 6 miles behind\n\nwhere we started. The next day, we broke\n\neven and would up the day where we started.\n\n23rd – 25th July 1945\n\nLogistics in Hagushi Anchorage and Buckner\n\nBay, Okinawa\n\n25th – 30th July 1945\n\nEnroute with Okinawa – Leyte Convoy #7\n\nEnroute to the Philippines, we were lead ship\n\nin the convoy. One night we picked up a sub\n\ncontact. We attacked, dropping depth\n\ncharges. When these explode, they shake the\n\nwhole ship. After a number of attacks, the\n\nvibration damaged our sound gear which\n\nprotrudes from the bottom of our ship.\n\nUnable to track the sub any longer, we were\n\nassigned a position on the port side of the\n\nconvoy. The next night we heard the\n\nexplosion when the ship that took our place\n\nwas torpedoed.\n\n30th – 31st July 1945\n\nLogistics San Pedro Bay, Leyte Gulf, P.I.\n\nWe were anchored in Leyte Gulf between\n\nLeyte & Samar Islands. A beach party had\n\nbeen arranged for our crew to play a softball\n\ngame with local C.B.s. Red and I were in the\n\nparty of about 60 of our crew who were\n\nlanded on a small beach. We were not that\n\ninterested in baseball & decided to see what\n\nwe could see of the island. As the crew\n\nmarched along the beach to a street that ran\n\ndown to the water, Red and I fell back to the\n\nend of the column. At the street, our column\n\nmade a left turn & walked about 2 blocks to\n\nthe main road. There they made a left turn to\n\nhead for the ball field. Red & I made a right\n\nturn & walked on to see what we could see.\n\nWe saw some native huts as we walked along.\n\nWe walked a little further & a command car\n\npulled up along side of us. The officer at the\n\nwheel said “You fellows want a lift?” We\n\njumped in. As we drove off he said, “I’m going\n\nas far as Provost Marshal’s office. Where are\n\nyou going?” At that we became a little\n\nworried. Not know how far that was or what\n\nwas ahead, I took a chance and said “Oh, we’re\n\ngoing a little past that.” We must have gone a\n\nmile or two when we came to his turn off. He\n\nstopped to let us off & we walked into\n\nTacloban. We saw a big old Spanish church &\n\nsome of the local housing. We decided to\n\nhead back as it was getting late & we had\n\ncome a good ways. On the way back, we saw 2\n\nsoldiers with submachine guns guarding a\n\nbunch of jap P.O.W.s. When we finally got\n\nback to the beach, it was late and the beach\n\nwas deserted. We were all alone & our ship\n\nwas a long way off. After a while, we spotted\n\na motor whaleboat heading our way. It landed\n\n& we asked if we could get a ride back to our\n\nship. They were off an Australian Corvet that\n\nwas anchored not too far from the Dennis.\n\nThey had come in to pick up their mail & were\n\nvery obliging. As we neared the Dennis, I\n\nsuggested that there was a ladder hanging off\n\nthe fantail & they could drop us off there. I\n\nwas hoping we could be back on board\n\nwithout being spotted (not realizing that the\n\nmen were counted leaving they ship & again\n\non returning. The O.D. was 2 men short.) I\n\nstarted up the ladder. When I came to the top,\n\nI saw a pair of Khaki pants legs. Red was on\n\nthe ladder below me & hollering for me to\n\nmove up. I was telling him to be quiet, that I\n\nwas caught, but maybe they didn’t see him.\n\nWe were held for Captain’s mast the next day.\n\nWe were found guilty of being AWOL. The\n\nsentence was to be confined to the ship for the\n\nrest of the time we were in port. The ship\n\nsailed the next day.\n\n31st July – 4th Aug. 1945\n\nEnroute independently to Hollandia, New Guinea\n\nOn this trip, we crossed the equator on the 3rd\n\nof Aug. 1945 at latitude 00000 & longitude\n\n137o 45’ E. I was initiated into the trusty order\n\nof the shellbacks. On 4th Aug. 945 we arrived\n\nat Hollandia, New Guinea for R&R for the\n\ncrew. We all had 3 – 4 days ashore with no duties.\n\n4th – 11th Aug. 1945\n\nAvailability, rest and recreation in Hollandia.\n\nThe local natives here were head hunters. The\n\nchief of the local tribe had a collection of Japanese heads.\n\n11th – 12th Aug. 1945\n\nEnroute to Biak Island, Dutch New Guinea.\n\n12th – 13th Aug. 1945\n\nAnchored Sorido Lagoon, Biak.\n\nWhile at Biak the natives would row out to our\n\nship in their outriggers to trade beautiful sea\n\nshells for cigarettes. (Cigarettes sold at ship\n\nstore for 5 cents a pack.) Shortly after this a\n\nnumber of the crew (this sailor included) came\n\ndown with what was called ‘jungle rot’,\n\ncircular scabs about the size of a dime all over\n\nyour body that itched like crazy. Doc (our\n\npharmacist mate) (Carlton Antoine Phm 1/C.\n\nHe received meritorious advancement for\n\nwork with wounded after sea battle.) treated\n\nthis with a red solution that he painted on us.\n\nIt burnt like hell, but it did the job of clearing it up.\n\n13th – 18th Aug. 1945\n\nEnroute Leyte, Philippine Islands as sole escort\n\nfor T.U. 76.14.22 (seven LSTs)\n\nThese LSTs were being brought up to the P.I. in\n\npreparation for the next invasion – Japan.\n\nWhile at sea, we received word of the\n\ndropping of the A-bomb. It looks like the war\n\nmay be over soon. This is the happiest day of\n\nmy life. It looks like we’ll make it through the war.\n\n15th Aug. 1945\n\nReceived word at sea of unconditional\n\nsurrender of Japan.\n\nThe Captain signaled the convoy that we had a\n\nsub contact. We dropped back a couple of\n\nmiles and 2 cans of beer were passed out to all\n\nhands. That was the best can of beer I ever\n\nhad. Not that it was a great beer, but for the\n\ncelebration that it represented. After a short\n\nperiod of time the captain announced, “All\n\nright men, throw the cans over the side. We\n\nhave to get back to work.” We rejoined the\n\nconvoy and sailed happily on the Leyte Gulf.\n\n18th – 19th Aug. 1945\n\nLogistic in Leyte Gulf, Philippine Island.\n\nThat night in port observed firework\n\ncelebration as the ships all fired off their star\n\nshells. I’ve seen more impressive fireworks\n\nsince, but none of them could equal what that\n\ncelebration that night in Leyte Gulf meant to me.\n\n19th – 28th Aug. 1945\n\nPatrolling sea lanes off Leyte Gulf, P.I.\n\n28th Aug – 5th Sept. 1945\n\nTender availability, San Pedro Bay, Leyte, P.I.\n\n5th – 15th Sept. 1945\n\nAt sea, Leyte, P.I. to Okinawa.\n\n15th – 16th Sept. 1945\n\nLogistics in Buckner Bay, Okinawa. Harbor\n\nTyphoon plan in effect.\n\nArrived Okinawa last night. When I woke up in\n\nthe morning, our ship was pitching & rolling\n\nheavily. I thought we must have gone back to\n\nsea. When I went up on deck, I saw that we\n\nwere still anchored in port. We were told that\n\na bid typhoon was coming our way and that\n\nwe were going back out to sea to ride it out.\n\n16th Sept. 1945\n\nTyphoon plan executed. Proceeded\n\nimmediately south and west of Okinawa to\n\nride out the storm. The ship rode very well\n\nand received minor damage, though center of\n\nstorm with winds of 175 MPH approached to\n\nwithin 100 miles. During the height of the\n\nstorm, this ship made several rolls of more\n\nthan 50 degrees. A number of smaller ships\n\nwere washed ashore and some were sunk.\n\nComing up the ladder from the mess hall there\n\nis a door on the port side that opens to a\n\nsheltered area on the main deck. A few of us\n\nopened this door to see what it looked like\n\noutside. The sea was wild and the waves were\n\ntremendous. We saw an APA off our port side.\n\nThe bow was coming out of the water to\n\nmidship by the stack. Then the bow would\n\nplow back into the water and rear of the ship\n\nwould rise out of the water to midship with its\n\nscrews spinning in the air. It just kept see-\n\nsawing back and forth like that. That ship was\n\nabout twice our size. We said if that ship is\n\ndoing that what are we doing? We closed the\n\ndoor and dogged it. We were doing much the\n\nsame because the whole ship would shake\n\nwhen the rear of the ship cam out of the water\n\nand the twin screws would spin in the air It\n\nwas quite a ride and we were all glad when it was over\n\nAdditional note:\n\nIn Jan. 1946 issue of Reader’s Digest, Lt.\n\nCommander Robert Esson Rew, Captain of the\n\nU.S.S. Beagle, a large armed supply ship of\n\n14,000 tons with 29’ draft wrote of his ship’s\n\nexperience in the “Typhoon off Okinawa” Sept\n\n16-17, 1945. “The waves were giants 60 to 80 feet high.”\n\n“Ships all around calling for help when there\n\nwasn’t any help and there couldn’t be until the\n\nstorm ended.” “I am adrift, out of control;\n\nestimate my position to be…” “I am on the\n\nrocks and breaking up, am abandoning ship.”\n\n“Please send assistance if at all possible.” “ It\n\nwas pitiful. Mostly these were little ships –\n\nminesweepers and such. It is\n\nincomprehensible to me how any of them survived.”\n\n17th – 19th Sept 1945\n\nContinued independently to Leyte, P.I. Sank\n\nhorned mine by gun fire enroute.\n\n19th – 30th Sept. 1945\n\nLogistics and upkeep in San Pedro Bay, Tolso\n\nAnchorage, Samar, P.I.\n\n14th – 25th Oct. 1945\n\nReturned to Pearl Harbor with the remains of\n\nD.E. Division 63.\n\nNote:\n\nD.E. Division 63 consisted of:\n\nD.E. 402 Richard S. Bull\n\nD.E. 403 Richard M. Rowell\n\nD.E. 404 Eversole (Sunk)\n\nD.E. 405 Dennis\n\nD.E. 406 Edmonds\n\nD.E. 407 Shelton (Sunk)\n\nThe 401 Holder and 413 Sammuel B. Roberts\n\nwere also sunk.\n\nOn the way to Pearl, the Captain made an\n\nannouncement over the P.A. system. He said\n\nour ship has been awarded the presidential\n\nunit citation. The citation read: The 63rd D.E.\n\nDivision was the most outstanding division in\n\nthe Pacific area and the Dennis was the most\n\noutstanding ship in our division. This made me\n\nvery proud of my ship, but I realized that the\n\naward was mainly for action before I was a\n\nmember of the crew. She was credited with\n\nassisting the sinking of the Japanese cruiser\n\nalong with bombs from one of our planes.\n\nI would like to dedicate this book to 5 men I\n\nnever knew. They were killed 25th Oct. 1944 in\n\nbattle with a larger Japanese task force that consisted of:\n\n4 battleships\n\n8 cruisers\n\n12 destroyers\n\nThe American task unit Taffy 3 consisted of:\n\n6 escort carriers – 2 sunk\n\n3 destroyers – 2 sunk\n\n4 destroyer escorts – 1 sunk\n\nIn memory of Dennis crew men K.I.A Oct. 25, 1944\n\nGeorge Washington Grater S/1C\n\nJohn Andrew Sambo F/1C\n\nWilliam A.

He stayed in his downed airplane,\n\nradioing his position during fall, which made it possible to rescue the\n\npilot, at the cost of his own life.\n\nThe ship was launched 4th Dec. 1943 sponsored by Mrs. J.L.

Dennis who fought off a\n\nmuch larger enemy force at Leyte on Oct. 25, 1944 were heroes.\n\nI would especially like to point out some individuals. First: the men\n\nbelow decks in the engine room & fire rooms, who could hear our\n\nguns going off & feel the enemy shells hitting our ship. I’ve been\n\nbelow when the guns were firing & know that your mind can imagine\n\nall kinds of things when you don’t actually know what’s going on. I\n\nthought myself lucky to be assigned a battle station on the aft 40 mm\n\ngun. There I could see what was going on & know when it was time to\n\nworry & when not.\n\nLt. John Smyth, a soft spoken gentleman, was assistant gunnery\n\nofficer & during the battle he was in charge of firing the torpedoes. It\n\nwas like a bombardier on a bomber. When the run starts, he is in\n\ncharge of the ship. As the O.D. steered the ship on the torpedo run,\n\nenemy shells were splashing in the water around them. He would\n\nsteer the ship to the side the last salvo landed. As the japs corrected\n\ntheir fire, the next salvo would land where the ship had been. He\n\nplayed this deadly game until the torpedoes were fired. At 10,000\n\nyards the Captain called Mr. Smyth on the phones & ordered him to\n\nfire. My Smyth replied “We will go down to 7,500 yards or by God we\n\nwill go down with the fish in the tubes.”\n\nLater, Lightsey, Signalman 1C, in talking of the battle aid the jap shells\n\nwere flying over our heads on the bridge. I could have reached up &\n\ntouched some of them, they came so close.\n\nLeroy Blackburn was Chief Gunners Mate. He was another soft\n\nspoken gentleman who was well respected & called Blackie by all\n\nhands. During the battle at one point, he was making the rounds of\n\nthe gun positions. At the K-guns, he came across Fred Grazino & Bill\n\nCurtis standing together. He told them to break it up & not hang\n\ntogether. Fred walled off. A few minutes later a shell hit. Fred\n\nturned around, Curtis was gone. Fred lives in Nyack, N.Y. & we\n\noccasionally get together for lunch. Fred told me “Ed, Blackie saved\n\nmy life.”\n\nBlackie wrote a letter a few years ago to the Destroyer Escort Sailors\n\nAssoc. newspaper. In it he praised his shipmates for their conduct\n\nduring the battle. He singled out Tony Manzi, A shipfitter who\n\nvolunteered to stay & worth with him in a 5’ gun mount when the\n\nspring closing the breech block was broken. The barrel was almost\n\nred hot with a live shell in it, that couldn’t be removed. It could have\n\n“cooked off” at any time. They ran a fire hose down the barrel in an\n\nattempt to cool the projective. The water seeping past the shell was\n\nsteaming hot. The repair was made & the shell fired. It went about\n\n200 yards & exploded. Blackie called Tony a hero because he didn’t\n\nhave to stay, but he volunteered. Blackie said “I stayed because it\n\nwas my job.” I talked to Blackie a number of times over the past few\n\nyears, before he passed away. He had joined the Navy in the early\n\n‘30s when he was 17. He talked of the China sailors in the 30s. They\n\nspent years in the Orient. (As in the movie ‘ The Sandpebbles”)\n\nBlackie was at Pearl Harbor Dec. 7, 1941. He sent me a copy of an\n\narticle he wrote for his local paper in Oklahoma, about that\n\nexperience. In it he state that after it was over you would see\n\nAmerican sailor’s body parts floating in the harbor.\n\nI served on the U.S.S. Dennis for 18 months, from Dec. 1, 1944\n\nthrough the end of May, 1946. I lived with these men, worked with\n\nthem, ate with them, joked with the, drank with them, fought\n\nalongside them and prayed with them. I am proud of the U.S.S.\n\nDennis and of the men that sailed on her. It is an honor to have\n\nserved with them. God bless them all."
