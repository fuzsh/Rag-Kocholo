        "text": "Moshier's ephemeris, upon which AE is based, was calibrated to DE404 from -3000 to +3000 for the outer planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, and from -1349 to +3000 for the inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars. In order to bring AE into better agreement with DE406 for the entire period -2999 to +3000, we have applied further corrections to heliocentric coordinates, which in turn correct geocentric coordinates. The graphs show only the corrected geocentric coordinates except for the moon, Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune, for which uncorrected and corrected longitude is shown for reasons that will be explained below. The most notable corrections are for Mars for which the corrections extend from -2999 to +300, and Pluto for which the corrections extend the entire range from -3000 to 3000. The corrections for the earth, although much smaller, affect the geocentric coordinates of all the planets, the closer planets more, the distant planets less.\n\nInner Planets\n\nThe greatest differences, and thus the greatest corrections, are for the period prior to -1349. The maximum value of uncorrected and corrected differences AE - DE406 (absolute values) that appear in our comparisons (which may not be complete) for geocentric ecliptical coordinates to the nearest 0.01 units is as follows:\n\nuncorrected:\n\ncorrected:\n\nThe corrections were made in a way that is computationally intensive but appears to work satisfactorily. For Mercury, Earth, Mars, and Pluto a table was computed of the differences DE406 - AE of heliocentric coordinates for the specified periods, at intervals of 10 days for Mercury, 30 days for the Earth and Mars, and 2130 days for Pluto. This table appears as the file 'correction.dat'. For dates within the range of correction, AE looks up corrections in the table and adds them to the uncorrected heliocentric coordinates; the corrected heliocentric coordinates then appear in the ephemeris and in turn are used to compute the corrected geocentric coordinates. For Mercury, Mars, and Pluto there are corrections for heliocentric longitude, latitude, and distance; for the earth heliocentric latitude is omitted; no corrections were required for Venus.\n\nThe correction for the inner planets is always applied, but can switched off by a script (see CorrectionMode in the Scripting Language Reference).\n\nOuter Planets\n\nThe corrections for Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune are entirely different. There are differences in heliocentric longitude that are linear from -2999 to +3000, probably a difference in mean motion, and these are corrected by a simple linear correction term applied to longitude. These corrections (including for Pluto) are optional and are selected by checking the box outer planets under apply correction in the More settings dialog. For Saturn there is no linear difference. There are also differences in heliocentric latitude and distance, but these are not linear and cannot be corrected so easily. Fortunately, the differences in latitude are very small and the differences in distance, while not small absolutely, are sufficiently small in relation to the distance of the planet, as to have virtually no effect on geocentric longitude and latitude.\n\nThe geocentric coordinates are also corrected by the corrections applied to the earth although these corrections are quite small because of the great distances of the outer planets. The maximum range of uncorrected and corrected differences AE - DE406 (absolute values) that appear in our comparisons (which may not be complete) for geocentric ecliptical coordinates to three digits is as follows, with differences in longitudes shown in the order in which they occur from -2999 to +3000:\n\nuncorrected:"
