        "text": "During several periods from 1984 to 1986, a pedestrian survey of the upper Deep Creek Drainage, in Riley, Geary and Wabaunsee Counties of Kansas, was performed. The project area is in the northern Flint Hills, a few miles south of Manhattan on a tributary to the Kansas River. Because this drainage is a natural unit, small enough to be covered by the limited funding available yet rich in both historic and prehistoric sites, it was particularly well suited to a study of prehistoric human ecology. The survey covered portions of forty-eight sections with a land area equivalent of nearly thirty-seven sections. Two hundred and twenty-nine sites, twenty-one of which contained historic components, were recorded. Two hundred and twenty-one isolated finds were also recorded, and evidence for an \"Indian trail\" from the early historic period was located. Most of the sites found were directly related to prehistoric quarrying and/or to the trail. Most of the sites were confined to the surface, and very few of the lithics were diagnostic. Therefore, good temporal control for prehistoric sites in this area was difficult.\n\nIn 1994, the Archeology Office of the Kansas Historical Society (KSHS) initiated excavations to mitigate the impact to eight recorded archaeological sites—Larcom-Haggard, 14CO1; Arkansas City Country Club, 14CO3; Schrope, 14CO331; Havelock, 14CO332; Living the Dream, 14CO382; Radio Lane, 14CO385; Killdeer, 14CO501; and Thompson Gardens, 14CO1509—in the path of the proposed Arkansas City Bypass and Levee Project. The project area is situated on the floor and adjacent uplands of the Walnut River valley east of the City of Arkansas City in southern Cowley County. In the end, over 600 subsurface pit features were excavated, along with numerous features of other types. Four components are represented at the sites: the Late Archaic, Woodland, Great Bend aspect, and Historic period. Only the Great Bend aspect component produced substantial information, the analysis of the other components does not go beyond documenting the location and nature of the recovered material culture. This report describes the environmental setting of the lower Walnut River valley and its confluence with the Arkansas River at Arkansas City, Kansas, including a summary of the geomorphology of the Lower Walnut drainage. It also includes a discussion of the cultural historical sequence of south-central Kansas up to and including Wichita history and tribal movements. The report emphasizes accounts of archeological research on the Great Bend aspect in Kansas and surrounding areas, providing background for the current analysis. Excavation and analytical techniques are presented, including feature descriptions, sampling strategies, and an analysis of radiocarbon ages and archaeomagnetic dates. The chronometric analysis shows that the Great Bend aspect component was present in the region minimally between 1400 and 1700 of the Common Era (CE). Great Bend aspect subsistence is explored through analysis of plant and animal remains. Terrestrial fauna, especially bison, were the most commonly exploited animal resources, riverine resources, with the exception of mussels, were largely ignored. Plant remains indicate the cultivation of maize, squash, beans, tobacco, and a variety of native domesticates, though the latter species clearly were being de-emphasized at this locality, eclipsed by the strong role of maize. Analysis of stone tools and ceramics demonstrates very little technological or stylistic change through the period of Great Bend aspect component. Trading patterns are evaluated through the analysis of nonlocal materials. The Great Bend aspect occupants of the project locality, part of the Lower Walnut focus, traded primarily with non-Great Bend aspect groups to the southwest, south-southeast, and east. Trade between Great Bend aspect localities was not strong, indicating that a free flow of people and goods between different Great Bend foci was unlikely. The investigation of Great Bend aspect components at these eight sites gives us a comprehensive view of this important time period, confirming some earlier thinking and giving rise to more detailed information on how these people carried out their lives.\n\nThe clash of cultures that represents the Historic Indian period in North America is a story of resilience on the part of the tribes and incompetent, indifferent, or exploitive actions by government and elected officials. A deeper understanding of this story can be discovered through historical research and archaeological investigations. While doing background research for a report on the excavation at Fool Chief 's Village (14SH305), the author found a more complete history of the Kansa than had been previously published. The first article on the history of the tribe chronicles the time from first European contact with the tribe until the tribe was removed from the state that bares its name. The second article describes the search for American Chief 's Village using systematic metal detector survey of suspected village locations. Locating this village is important because American Chief, though the smallest of the three Kansa villages of the time, had both a Mission and a Chouteaus trading post located in or next to it, indicating a closer relationship with Euro-Americans than the other villages. Archaeological investigations of this village will allow a comparison of villages with greater and lesser Euro-American influence."
