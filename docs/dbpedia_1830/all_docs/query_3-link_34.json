        "text": "Object name or coordinates\n\nThe target may be specified by supplying a coordinate pair or a name.\n\nTarget coordinates consist of a pair of numbers, separated by a comma. Whitespace is ignored. For J2000 or B1950 coordinates, specify the right ascension first, as a number between 0 and 360 (inclusive), followed by a comma, then the declination, as a number between -90 and +90 (inclusive). If Galactic coordinates are specified, specify the Galactic longitude as a number between 0 and 360 (inclusive), followed by a comma, then the Galactic latitude, as a number between -90 and +90 (inclusive). All values are in degrees.\n\nA target name may be specified as an arbitrary string. Any entry that cannot be interpreted as a coordinate pair will be treated as a target name. The target name is resolved (mapped to coordinates) by querying the SIMBAD, NED, and HEASARC GRB catalog (GRBCAT) name resolution services, in that order. The first name resolution service that provides a match for the target name will be used to provide the coordinates of the target object. If the name cannot be resolved by any of the name resolution services, an error message is displayed.\n\nExamples:\n\nSearch for the Vela pulsar by name:\n\nVela pulsar\n\nSearch for the Vela pulsar by equatorial coordinates (select 'J2000' or 'B1950' from the 'Coordinate system' menu):\n\n128.55,-45.75\n\nSearch for the Vela pulsar by Galactic coordinates (select 'Galactic' from the 'Coordinate system' menu):\n\n263.89,-3.29\n\nCoordinate system\n\nThis menu selects the coordinate system that will be used to interpret the coordinate pair entered into the previous field. 'J2000' and 'B1950' refer to equatorial coordinates in the 2000 and 1950 frames, respectively. 'Galactic' refers to Galactic longitude and latitude. The default selection is 'J2000'. Note that if a target name is specified, this menu selection is ignored.\n\nSearch radius (degrees)\n\nSearches are executed by locating all events which occur within the specified radius (in degrees) of the target location. If no search radius is provided, the default search radius of 15 degrees will be used.\n\nObservation dates may be specified in the Gregorian calendar system, or as a number of seconds in the MET (Mission Elapsed Time) system, or as a number of Modified Julian Days (MJD). See the next entry for descriptions of these time systems.\n\nIf used, a pair of dates must be provided, separated by a comma. Whitespace is ignored. If this field is not specified, the previous 6 months of data will be queried.\n\nGregorian dates are specified using the format:\n\nYYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS , YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n\nwhere YYYY is the year, MM the month number (01-12), DD the day number (01-31), HH the hour (00-23), MM the minute (00-59), and SS the second (00-60). Note that all values except the year must use a leading 0 to create a 2-character field.\n\nNote: In the current version of the query software, floating-point seconds are not supported.\n\nModified Julian Day (MJD) and Mission Elapsed Time (MET) dates are specified as floating-point numbers.\n\nAn example MET date string may look like:\n\n239557417 , 384620219\n\nwhile the same date represented in MJD format would be:\n\n54682.65527778 , 56361.62287037\n\nThe starting date may be replaced by the string 'START', to indicate the earliest available data. The ending date may be replaced by the string 'END', to indicate the most recent available data. The 'START' and 'END' keywords are case-insensitive. If no observation dates are supplied, the latest 6 months of data (based on the most recent photon data) will be used as the search range.\n\nTime system\n\nThe default time system is 'Gregorian', i.e. a traditional calendar date and clock time. If 'MJD' is specified, the date is interpreted as a floating-point number of Modified Julian Days (number of 24-hour days since midnight at the start of 17 November, 1858). If 'MET' is specified, the date is interpreted as a floating-point number of seconds since the mission epoch (midnight at the start of 1 January 2001).\n\nThe xTime tool can be used to convert dates and times between the various time systems.\n\nEnergy range\n\nThe energy range is specified using zero or two energies (separated by a comma), in MeV. If no energy range is specified,the default energy range of 100 MeV to 300,000 MeV (300 GeV) is used. If two values are specified, they are treated as the minimum and maximum photon or event energies, in MeV. Whitespace is ignored.\n\nLAT data type\n\nThe 'Photon' and 'Extended' data sources represent tighter and looser cuts, respectively, on the event data stream. Photon data consists of the event classes 'source', 'clean', and 'ultraclean'. Extended data includes 'transient'-class events, in addition to the Photon classes. The 'None' option indicates the user will not be searching the LAT data.\n\nSpacecraft data\n\n'Spacecraft' data contains the spacecraft position and pointing data, as well as other non-instrument-specific data."
