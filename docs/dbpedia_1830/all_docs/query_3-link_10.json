        "text": "I'm having the same problem. I'm using a Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 which is fully updated - I connect to our WiFi LAN at least once per day. Location is turned on and ASiair app is allowed access \"when turned on\". I used my ASiair Plus 20 mins ago and the Location setting reports this.\n\nAny suggestions? Why has this broken from the last firmware update? I'm running v2.1.4.11.06 ASiair app, and my mount is an AM5 (I notice that there is a firware update for this, that I haven't installed yet).\n\nPaul.\n\ncpl42 Do you mean the longitude and latitude data in the mount settings indicate you are in China, not the actual position?\n\nIf you open a map app at this time, is the location information correct?\n\nYou can tap these two boxes in the mount settings to change the location manually as a temporary solution.\n\nYes, I do mean that the lat-long indicates China. If I use a map app, it shows me at my current location, so it is reading the satellites OK.\n\nAnd, yes, that is one way I have changed my location and used Sync mount; the other is at the \"Enter\" screen that shows what the ASiair has detected that you have connected. I have changed the location there also (LH side, beside the list of equipment connected).\n\nThe issue is: before the latest firmware update, ASiair was getting all the info (date, time, location) from my S7 tablet. Now, it gets just the date and time and defaults the location to China. This is becoming a decent pain in the ... I think your firmware coders have broken something!\n\nPaul.\n\nI've just fired up my ASiair Plus, and connected my Galaxy S7 to it and the ASiair app shows the Chinese location at the \"Enter\" screen. My GPS app is showing my location correctly, even to the point of it being set back from the street. I've checked the \"logs\" folder on my SDcard but find only Autorun and PHD2 log files. Is there another place to find the one you require?\n\nPaul.\n\nYes, waterman, it definitely looks like it - when a working feature stops working after an update, then somehow it got broken in the code revisions. It would appear that the firmware update wasn't tested thoroughly enough. I'm sorry, ZWO, this isn't good enough.\n\nBTW: do you know which log file tech support was asking for? All I can find are the PHD2 and Autorun logs that are stored on the SD/USB/on-board RAM.\n\nPaul."
