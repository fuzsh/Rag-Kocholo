        "text": "USS South Dakota / USS Huron\n\nArmored Cruiser No. 9\n\nThe first South Dakota (Armored Cruiser No. 9), was built and launched on 21 July 1904 by the Union Iron Works, San Francisco, California. Sponsored by Miss Grace Herreid and commissioned on 27 January 1908, with Capt. James T. Smith in command. On June 23, 1904 the Union Iron Works notified the Navy Department that Miss Grace Herreid the daughter of South Dakota Governor Charles Herreid had been invited to christen the new cruiser soon to be launched at San Francisco. On July 20, 1904 Governor Herried and his daughter along with a party of 10 arrived in San Francisco and on Thursday the 21st of July attended the launching ceremony. In a very simple ceremony Bishop W. N. Nichols of the Episcopal diocese of California gave a short prayer and then Miss Grace Herreid pressed a button that released the cruiser from her blocks. As she slid down the ways Miss Herreid swung a bottle of champagne against the hull and bestowed the name of USS South Dakota on the ship.\n\nThe launching platform at the Union Iron Works in San Francisco, California with all the dignitaries to witness the christening of the ship by Miss Grace Herreid on 21 July 1904.\n\nAssigned to the Armored Cruiser Squadron, Pacific Fleet, South Dakota cruised off the west coast of the United States through August 1908. This Squadron consisted of the USS Washington under the command of Captain Theodore Porter, the USS Tennessee under the command of Captain Albert G. Berry, the USS California under command of Captain V. L. Cottman and the USS South Dakota, which was almost completed with officers yet to be assigned. Rear Admiral Charles H. Stockton was in command of the Squadron and used the USS Tennessee as his flagship. On April 8, 1908 she put in to coal according to a post card dated April 8, 1908 that was addresses to a F. E. Lough in Berkeley, California. It reads: \"Wed. April 8, 1908. Just coming in and going to coal and go right out again so I think I won't be home this time. And there will be no liberty unless they change plans. G. D.\"\n\nOn 24 August 1908, she departed San Francisco for a cruise to Samoa and on 15 September 1908 South Dakota crossed the equator for the first time on her way to Navigators Island (Samoa). The crossing was made at 165° Longitude. She headed eastward in September to operate in Central and South American waters. Sailing in rough weather she returned to Mare Island, California on 22 June 1909. As the post card below shows that the South Dakota was in Panama in July of 1909. The postmark has a date of July 14, 1909 and is addressed to a Mr. A. J. Herter of Iola, Kansas. On the front of the post card it has the caption: \"Central street, Panama\". Note the card was mailed on board the USS South Dakota has it bears the cancellation stamp of the ship.\n\nBy the later part of August 1909 South Dakota was back in the Bremerton Yard as this is known from post cards sent on 27 August from a crewman who states that he “had been out at the fair last night.” He is referring to the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition being held in Seattle. This exposition was held to publicize the development of the Pacific Northwest and was held from June 1st through October 16th, with over 700,000 visitors.\n\nIn the autumn of 1909, she deployed westward with the Armored Cruiser Squadron and on 5 September 1909 the West Virginia, California, South Dakota, Pennsylvania, Colorado and possibly the Maryland departed San Francisco, California and arrived on 11 September in Honolulu, Hawaii steaming 2,100 miles. The force called on ports in the Admiralty Islands, Pago Pago on Tutuila Island on American Samoa, the Philippines, Japan, and China, before returning to Honolulu on 31 January 1910. In February, South Dakota joined Tennessee (Armored Cruiser No. 10) to form a Special Service Squadron, which cruised off the Atlantic coast of South America and then returned to the Pacific late in the year. The 1910 Federal Census was taken aboard the South Dakota as she was at anchor in San Francisco, California. Around the end of October of 1911 she was in dry-dock getting her bottom scraped and painted in readiness for her coming cruise eastward to the Orient.\n\nFollowing operations along the Pacific coast during much of 1911, South Dakota began a cruise in December with the Armored Cruiser Squadron, which took her from California to the Hawaiian Islands, the Marianas, the Philippines, and Japan. During this time she was under command of Captain F. M. Bennett and his Executive Officer was Lt. CDR. Chester Wells and the ships compliment was 32 Officers and 859 enlisted men. As the Squadron entered it anchorage in Honolulu, Hawaii the wharves were crowded with the locals welcoming the return of the fleet. While in Honolulu the ships company held a birthday party for the South Dakota as she became another year older. While the Squadron is anchored in Honolulu the men take advantage of the time there and many visits to such famous landmarks like Diamond Head. Tours to the volcano were popular and cost the sailors a cool $6 for the trip. As the Squadron moved to the Philippine Islands South Dakota had target practice in the waters just off Manila. During this time South Dakota sustains some damage to her starboard propeller. These were 18 feet in diameter made of a manganese-bronze material and weighed 34,000 pounds each. She had two propellers and the pitch of the 3-blades could be adjusted. The two propellers were connected to a shaft that was 48-feet long and the shaft was 18.5-inches in diameter. The damage was determined to be a bent blade and she put into the Dewey Dry-dock for repairs. While in the dry-dock she had her bottom scraped and repainted and she also had one of her anchor engines repaired. Months later when the Squadron was returning from Yokohama, Japan to Honolulu she broke her starboard main shaft likely due to the stress put on it from the bent propeller blades. While she was at anchor in Shanghai the men took in the sights of China with many Rickshaw rides in the city. Boxing matches between rival sister ships was a popular pastime with shipmates. Kid “Dullin” of the South Dakota knocks out Miller of the California for the lightweight championship of the Squadron.\n\nThe California, South Dakota, West Virginia and Colorado arrived at Santa Monica on 7 October 1911 and then sailed for San Pedro. After returning to the west coast in August 1912, she participated in periodic squadron exercises until she was placed in reserve on 30 December 1913 at the Puget Sound Navy Yard.\n\nIn April of 1914 when political turmoil erupted again in Mexico, South Dakota was detached from the Reserve Force, Pacific Fleet, on 17 April 1914. Orders were received for an American military force to be sent to Mexico and the 4th Marine Regiment was reorganized at the Puget Sound, Washington, and Mare Island, California Navy Yards. On the 18th of April the Field and Staff and the 25th, 26th and 27th Companies boarded the South Dakota in Puget Sound and sailed for Mare Island in San Francisco. South Dakota and her Marines arrived at Mare Island on the 21st of April, which was the same day other Marines were landing at Vera Cruz, Mexico. The South Dakota added to her complement the 31st and 32nd companies and the 34th and 35th Companies went aboard the 19,360-ton collier USS Jupiter. The next day on April 22 the 4th Marine Regiment, now under the command of Colonel Joseph H. Pendleton, USMC, embarked aboard the South Dakota and the Jupiter went to sea bound for Mexican Waters.\n\nThe two-ship force with the 4th Marine Regiment headed southward into Mexican waters along the Gulf of California near Mazatlon on the Pacific side. The 4th Marines were disembarked and the South Dakota was ordered to proceed further south. She dropped anchor in the harbor in Acapulco on the 28th of April. On the 27th of April the West Virginia sailed from Puget Sound with the 28th Company, Marines on board. On May 2nd the West Virginia picked up the 36th Company at Mare Island and then headed to Mexican waters. About a week and a half later the West Virginia landed her reinforcements in Mazatlan. All 10 companies of the 4th Marine Regiment were now in Mexican Waters ready for any action they might be called for.\n\nThe Marines maintained their vigil through May and June while preparing for a possible landing, if the situation ashore warranted it. Although no landing was necessary, the South Dakota, West Virginia and the Jupiter with their Marines on board kept the Mexican coast under surveillance by cruising up and down the shoreline. By the end of June, tensions between Mexico and the United States had sufficiently eased to allow the withdrawal of the 4th Regiment from Mexican waters. Thus ended the 4th Marine Regiment's first expedition to Latin America, much to the disappointment of its personnel who had expected to see action.\n\nThe 4th Marine Regiment returned to the United States in early July. The 34th and 35th Companies, which were on the Jupiter were transferred to the South Dakota and West Virginia and headed to sea and back to California. They arrived in San Diego harbor on July 6, 1914 where the 4th Marine Regiment was once again encamped on North Island.\n\nAbove is a post card printed aboard the South Dakota by her print shop and published by L. E. Ruggles who was also the editor of the “Ess Dee” the official newspaper of the South Dakota, which was also printed aboard the ship. On the backside it was dated June 26, 1914, and postmarked the same day. The message was “Hope this finds you well. Letter follows.” It was signed with a signature that was unreadable. The post card was addressed to Mr. J. Olson Drug Store 48th & 2nd Avenue, Los Angeles, California.\n\nLater in August of 1914 the South Dakota made another cruise this time westward to the Hawaiian Islands. She returned to Bremerton, Washington on 14 September and reverted to reserve status on 28 September 1914. She was the flagship of the Reserve Force, Pacific Fleet, from 21 January 1915 until relieved by Milwaukee (Cruiser No. 21) on 5 February 1916. She remained in reduced commission through 1916 and on 5 April 1917, she was again placed in full commission.\n\nDuring the late summer of 1915 South Dakota was cruising up the Columbia River to participate in the Astoria Regatta, held each summer in Astoria, Oregon. The Astoria Regatta was first held in 1894 and today is a five-day celebration held on the Columbia River in Astoria, Oregon. During the 1890's the salmon fishing industry of the Columbia River was just beginning to take hold and at the end of the fishing season many fishermen came to Astoria to celebrate and to spend some of their season's earnings. The fishermen after a hard season of fishing were ready to blow off steam in the many dance halls and saloons of Astoria and it was in the summer of 1894 that several Astoria businessmen decided that a regatta would be a good way to celebrate. In the beginning there were boat races between rival fishing boats and yachts and the like. There were also tug-of-war matches and foot races on the banks of the Columbia. As the Regatta grew naval ships were invited to come to show off the new technology of the navy. And this was also a good liberty for the sailors from the various naval ships that came.\n\nThe South Dakota as she stands up river at the Astoria Regatta of 1915.

Write on BOTH sides of this Paper.”\n\nA View of life onboard the South Dakota from the eyes of Seaman Mungo\n\nLt. jg Paul L. Hughes\n\nPaul Longstreth Hughes was born on June 1, 1893 in the state of New York. On June 14, 1900 when the Federal census was taken in Lansdowne Borough, Delaware County, Pennsylvania, Paul Hughes lived at home with an older brother and the sister of his mother. His mother Carol L. Hughes was listed as the head of the household and was listed as being a widow. She had 3 children 2 of which were still living. She was born in November of 1859 in Iowa. Paul’s oldest brother was named Francis C. and also living in the home was Carol’s sister named Ella B. Love who was 26 at the time.\n\nPaul grew up and joined the US Navy Reserve Force and was on 30 day of April 1917 at the rank of Coxswain. On 21 November 1917 he was assigned to the receiving ship at Norfolk, VA and he was assigned his first ship the USS Hatteras on 24 December 1917. Seven days later on the 31st he was transferred to the USS Mexican. He remained on the USS Mexican until14th of April 1918 when he was again transferred to the USS Pamlico where he remained until May 7th 1918 when he was assigned to the Headquarters, 5th Naval District.\n\nOn June 8th, 1918 Hughes was commissioned as an Ensign in the Naval Reserve Force and 3 days later on the 11 of June reported to the 5th Naval District at the US Naval Academy in Annapolis. On the 18 of September 1918 Hughes was commissioned as an Ensign in the Regular Navy and on October 4th, 1918 was assigned to the USS Plattsburgh. On the first day of July 1919 he was promoted to Lt. jg and on the 26th of July 1919 reported to Headquarters Cruiser and Transport Force, Hoboken, New Jersey to await his next assignment. Lt. jg Hughes was then assigned to duty on the USS South Dakota on September 3, 1919.\n\nAs an officer on the USS South Dakota Lt. jg Hughes participated in the actions that the South Dakota took part in while on station in Vladivostok, Russia during the Russian Civil War leading a landing party ashore and protecting the US Consular Building in Vladivostok. Lt. jg Hughes was still onboard the USS South Dakota on 20th of March 1920 when the Federal Census was taken. He listed his home of record as 104 W. Eager St. in Baltimore, Maryland. Lt. jg Hughes was single and 26 years old at the time.\n\nPaul Hughes left the military and at some point ended up working in the stock brokerage industry. When Paul Hughes wrote a letter to fellow South Dakota shipmate Pat Mungo on 16 September 1960, Paul was a full partner with the stock brokerage firm of Gude, Winmill and Co., located at One Wall Street in New York in the heart of the financial district. In the letter that Hughes wrote to Mungo, Hughes notes that all of his navy records were stored in the attic of his seaside cottage.The original letter to Pat Mungo is in the Military Collection of the State Archives of North Carolina, World War I Papers, Private Collections, Box 75.\n\nPaul L. Hughes died in New York City in June of 1969.\n\nSeaman, Carl Reginald Lightner\n\nCarl Reginald Lightner was born Boyd County, Kentucky on 7 June 1887. According to the 1900 federal Census Carl's father, George Lightner was born in Kentucky in July of 1850 and his mother, Louella C., was born in May of 1850 in Ohio. Carl had 5 siblings of which, the eldest was brother, Eston E., born in March of 1878 in Ohio and was a farm laborer in 1900. Second oldest brother was Lorraine E. born in March of 1881 in Ohio and also worked as a farm laborer. Next eldest was his sister Rosa born in September of 1883 in Kentucky, and then there was Carl listed as being in school. Another younger sister named Georgia was born in May of 1891 in Arkansas and youngest brother Claude, born in April 1893 in the Indian Territory.\n\nIt is not known when Carl joined the navy but Carl crossed the equator as a crewman on the USS South Dakota on 15 September 1908. This is known from a document signed by A. Templeton, which was given to Carl when he crossed the equator for the first time. Carl underwent the ancient rite of the sea as sailors who crossed the equator for the first time were visited by King Neptune himself and were transformed from a pollywog to a shellback. The crossing of the equator took place in the Pacific Ocean at 0 degrees latitude, 165 degrees longitude as they were bound for Navigators Island which is now known as Samoa. According to the 1910 Federal Census taken at San Francisco, California aboard the USS South Dakota then at anchor there, Carl's name appears. Carl is listed as a 22-year old Seaman and single.\n\nAs America enter the War in 1917, Carl felt the call to serve his country and registered for the draft. On his draft card dated 5 June 1917 Carl was married with two children ages 1 and 3 years. Carl listed his home at RR No. 2 in Earlsboro, Pottawatomie County, Oklahoma and his occupation as a tenant farmer in Earlsboro. He was listed as having served in the navy before at the rating of Petty Officer. It was noted that he had been in the navy for 11 years. His physical traits were tall, medium build with brown eyes and brown hair.\n\nThe next recorded mention of Carl comes from the 1920 Federal census where it states he was living in Forest, Oklahoma, which is in Pottawatomie County. There he lived at 317 Sixth Street in Forest with his wife Leta E. age 23 and two daughters born in Oklahoma, Ilsie age 6 and Alice age 3 years, 7 months. The census listed Carl as a farmer and was age 32 at the time.\n\nSometime between the 1920 and 1930 Federal Census Carl and his wife had parted ways. It is not known what happened to his wife but on the 1930 Federal census Carl is listed as living alone with a son named Carl, Jr. age 10 years in Tecumseh, Oklahoma, which, is in Pottawatomie County Oklahoma. Carl and Carl, Jr. were roomers and Carl, Sr. was listed as being a agent at a car dealership and was also a veteran of the World War.\n\nAccording to the Social Security Death Index Carl R. Lightner's last residence was at 74801 Shawnee, Pottawatomie County, Oklahoma. Carl passed away on 9 December of 1986 at 99 years old. When he died Carl had 1 son, 5 daughters 16 grandchildren and 19 great-grand children and 5 great-great-grand children.\n\nThe grandson of Carl Lightner, Joe Skeesick contacted me and told me that he only knew that Carl was on the USS South Dakota and had a book of sorts that he penned before his death that contains numerous songs and poems that he would sing and tell all the time. Joe Skeesick remembers that he was a blacksmith for some time and then started a tire vulcanizing shop. He then opened his own garage which later became a Dodge agency. He sold that and put in a Whippet and Willis-Knight car dealership previous to the depression and lost it all when his customers brought their cars back into him and just handed him the keys. He went back into the tire vulcanizing business, opened up a shop, expanded back into mechanic work and welding and then started making and selling trailers.\n\nI never knew my uncle, Bill Landrigan as he died before I was born, leaving behind a father, mother, and three sisters: Helen 23, Rose 20, and my mother, Edna, 18. William Jeremiah Landrigan died in Vladivostok, Siberia, on March. 11, 1920. Bill Landrigan sailed there on the USS South Dakota/Huron, which was one of our many ships sent to protect United States interests during the Russian Revolution.\n\nMuch of my early years were spent on 4 Jesse Ct., Troy, New York, with my father, mother, and her sister, Helen. I was named after Bill. He was a topic of several conversations on many occasions. They referred to his dying in the Navy, being tall and loving baseball. I was compared to him and developed into an accomplished baseball player. They spoke of his letters from Siberia that told of his voyage. I inherited the letters when my mother died. The letters had numerous headings: YMCA, Knights of Columbus, On Active Duty with the American Expeditionary Forces and the Jewish Welfare Board. They arrived from Newport, R.I., Manila, Tokyo, Shanghai, Yokohama, and Vladivostok.\n\nBill enlisted in the Navy Jul. 8, 1919, in Albany, NY. His address at time of enlistment was 246 Third St. in Troy, NY. His first letters describe his training as an apprentice seaman at the Navel Training Center in Newport, RI. He expressed his desire to succeed and implied that he enlisted against his parent’s wishes. He told them not to worry and that he would succeed and come out a better person. He fretted about their welfare.\n\nBill tried out for the ships baseball team before sailing with the Asiatic Fleet for China. Sailing past Panama, he described seeing porpoises and flying fish. His letter of Dec. 8, 1919, from Yokohama reported a thrilling experience that of going to Tokyo to play the University baseball team, described as Japan’s best. He was proud to represent the ship but did not elaborate on the results of the game.\n\nOn December 19, 1919 Bill was in Shanghai ready to head for Russia. In Shanghai he describes rickshaw and saw-pans rides and the cast system there-first class whites, high Chinese and the poor. The “trenches” were inhabited by blind, naked, and dirty humanity.\n\nHis job on the ship was behind the 42 cal. gun as shell holder. In Vladivostok his letter of January 31, 1920 told of the Reds taking the city, of the Japanese Army possible involvement and how American landing parties protected their citizens there and storehouses. The Reds takeover caused Russian troops to defect and he mentions of the release of 1000 Bolsheviks from Russian prisons. The local citizens wore pieces of cloth as the Red Flag was hoisted over the city.\n\nThat was the last letter as Bill died of the Influenza outbreak at the U. S. Army Hospital #17 in Vladivostok, Russia on March. 11, 1920. After the “regret to inform you” letter sent by ship commander J.M. Luby, condolences came from the clergy who knew him. He was described by Rev. M. M. Weatherspoon and a Catholic priest, Fr. Joseph S. Loughran, as a man of strong religious character and respected by all.\n\nAs a youngster I saw the picture of the ships baseball team, but it has since disappeared. Hopefully, it will show up some day. I am pleased that I can recount his remembrances for him.\n\nRear Admiral Herman O. Stickney\n\nBorn at Pepperell, Massachusetts, December 10, 1867, Herman Osman Stickney graduated from the United States Naval Academy with the class of 1888. He was Assistant Engineer, U.S. Navy, July 1, 1890 and transferred to the line and promoted through the grades to Rear Admiral on December 22, 1919. He retired from the Navy on December 21, 1921.\n\nCommander Stickney was awarded the Medal of Honor while serving as the Captain of the USS Prairie during the Mexican Revolt of 1914. His citation reads:\n\n\"Distinguished conduct in battle engagements of Vera Cruz, Mexico, April 22, 1914. He covered the landing of the April 21, 1914 with the guns of the USS Prairie, and throughout the attack and occupation rendered important assistance to our forces on shore with his 3-inch battery.\"\n\nStickney served aboard the USS Iowa in the Spanish-American War, 1898; the USS Princeton, Philippine Insurrection, 1899-1901; Navy Yard, Norfolk, Virginia, 1901; Navigator, USS Texas, 1902-05; at the Naval Academy, 1905-06; duty at the Navy Yard, Norfolk, 1906-06; Executive Officer, USS South Dakota, 1908-10; Inspector in Charge, Light House District, Philadelphia, 1910-12; commander, USS Massachusetts, 1912; at the Naval Academy, 1912-13; commander, USS Prairie, 1913-14; Administrator of Custom, Vera Cruz, Mexico, 1914; at the Naval War College, 1914; commander, USS Vermont, 1915-18; Board of Inspections and Survey, Washington, D.C., 1918; Senior Member, Pacific Coast Board of Inspections, San Francisco, 1919; commander, Pacific Coast, Pacific Fleet, July 1921; U.S. Commissioner to the Sesquicentennial Exposition, Philadelphia, 1926-27; in charge of federal participation in that exposition. Attorney at law, he was admitted to the Bar in Virginia, June 27, 1923.\n\nHe made his home in Washington, D.C. and died there on September 13, 1936. He was buried in Section 3 of Arlington National Cemetery. His wife, Jennie Griffin Milhado Stickney (June 26, 1869 - September 21, 1948), is buried with him.\n\nSgt. William B. Kilburg, USMC\n\nWilliam even underwent the ancient rites of passage when he crossed the equator on the 18th of October 1919 on board the ship and was given the title of “Shellback” from King Neptune himself. Kilburg was even part of a large photo of his fellow marines and shipmates in front of the great bronze Daibutsu Buddha temple located in Kamakura, Japan. The Knights of Columbus held an excursion to this statue on December 6, 1919 and well over 150 sailors and marines from the ship went on the trip. This is the second tallest Buddha statue in Japan measuring just over 13.35 meters. This bronze statue was cast in 1252 and originally was located in a large temple hall, however the temple buildings were destroyed in a tsunami tidal wave at the end of the 15th century and from that time has set outside.\n\nWilliam B.

Chase, USMC\n\nRear Admiral Forrest A. Rhoads. A Journey from Apprentice Seaman to Rear Admiral\n\nForrest Alexis Rhoads was a career naval officer in the United States Navy and his career spanned from an Apprentice Seaman to Rear Admiral and he served in both WWI and WWII.\n\nForrest A. Rhoads was born on January 22, 1898 in Missouri and on April 6, 1916, one year to the day before America would enter the war in Europe, he enlisted into the United States Navy as an Apprentice Seaman. He was stationed aboard the Armored Cruiser USS South Dakota where he served through out the First World War aboard the cruiser, which was detailed on convoy escort duty during the war. While on the South Dakota Rhoads showed a remarkable talent in engineering and soon advanced to the grade of Chief Machinist’s Mate on April 6, 1919, just 3-years after the day he enlisted. After the war the South Dakota was finished with convoy escort duty and Rhoads was sent to the Stevens Institute of Technology for a course in advanced engineering. Stevens Institute of Technology is located at Castle Point on Hudson River in Hoboken, New Jersey and was founded in 1870, and is a school dedicated to exploring the frontiers of engineering, science, and management.\n\nAfter Rhoads graduated from his courses at Stevens Institute he entered the United States Naval Reserve Force as a Machinist and then shortly thereafter was commissioned as an Ensign in the Reserve Force. Within six-months Rhoads was honorably discharged from the Reserve Force and accepted a full commission into the Regular Navy on October 10, 1919. By January of 1920 Rhoads had married and was living in the town of Brea, which is in Orange County, California. His wife’s name was Dorothy Keith and she and Forrest lived at 211 E. Birch Street in Brea, which was the home of Dorothy’s parents, Charles and Grace Keith. Dorothy was a year older than Forrest and in the Keith home also was Dorothy’s 14-year old kid brother Harold Keith.\n\nIn Late summer 1921 Ensign Rhoads was assigned to duty on the 950-ton minesweeper USS Avocet then under orders to sail for Hawaii. Avocet made the voyage in company with Heron and Finch, and the three ships reached Pearl Harbor on the last day of August. Avocet remained inactive in Hawaiian waters into October then briefly visited Honolulu from 4 to 6 October 1921 before she sailed for Guam on the 6th of October in company again with the Heron and Finch. Reaching Guam on 23 October, the ships arrived at Cavite, Philippine Islands, on 2 November, and joined the Asiatic Fleet's Mine-sweeping Detachment. Avocet remained at Cavite for the next several weeks, a comparatively uneventful stay enlivened only by a fire that broke out in the Cavite Navy Yard early on the morning of 18 November 1921. The Avocet sent her fire and rescue party, under command of the executive officer, Ensign Forrest A. Rhoads, to aid yard forces in battling the blaze. This party returned to the ship an hour later, minus one of its number who had sustained injuries ashore.\n\nFor the next twenty years to the brink of WWII, Rhoads would serve aboard various naval ships in several capacities. He served as the Chief Customs Officer at the United States Naval Station Tutuila, American Samoa. When finished with that duty Rhoads returned to California for a time. His next duty was at the Naval yard at Pearl Harbor and on July 21, 1939 he took passage to Honolulu aboard the SS Lurline of the Matson Line, where they arrived on July 26. Rhoads served at the Naval Yard at Pearl Harbor until May of 1941 when he was detached for additional duties.\n\nDuring WWII Rhoads who had now obtained the rank of Captain, served a year and a half of combat during the height of offensive actions against the Japanese in the Marshalls, Marianas, and the Okinawa Campaigns. Captain Rhoads served as Chief Staff Officer of Captain W. L Carter, Commander Service Squadron Ten.\n\nIn late September 1944, Captain Rhoads conducted operations of Service Squadron Ten at Saipan for part of Vice Admiral Mitscher’s Task Force 38 where it retired for replenishments after the actions of Peleliu and Anguar in the Palaus, Ulithi in the Carolines, and Morotai in the Moluccas, and actions off Luzon. He served as a task unit commander for part of Service Squadron Ten on Saipan under the Commanders of the THIRD and FIFTH Fleets.\n\nFor his outstanding services in this capacity he was awarded the Legion of Merit. After his duties on Saipan were finished he served as Operations Officer on the staff of Vice Admiral William W. Smith, Commander of the Service Force, U. S. Pacific Fleet. After the war ended Rhoads was sent back to California where he served as the Commanding Officer of the Receiving Station, San Diego, California.\n\nNow at the rank of Rear Admiral, Forrest Rhoads was assigned to sea duty, this time as the commanding officer of the Fleet Oiler USS Kennebec (AO-36). Admiral Rhoads was in command of the Kennebec from late 1947-1949. During that time the Kennebec was assigned to the Naval Transport Service, and circled the globe providing fuel to American ships from oil deposits in Saudi Arabia, Aruba, and Texas. She operated both in the Atlantic and Pacific during this period, acting as the \"lifeline\" in the era of mobile sea power.\n\nAdmiral Rhoads final assignment was as Commander of Subgroup 4, Florida Group, Atlantic Reserve Fleet. This was a unit of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet where mothballed ships were stored and the Florida Group was based in Green Cove Springs, Florida just south of Jacksonville on the St. John’s River. At its peak there were over 600 ships housed at Green Cove.\n\nRear Admiral Rhoads retired from the Navy and passed away on August 19, 1965. On August 30 he was interned at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu, Hawaii. His plot is Section U, Site 281-F.\n\nRADM Rhoads grave marker at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu, Hawaii. On the next to the bottom line at the right end are the letters “LM” which stands for Legion of Merit. His plot is Section U, Site 281-F.\n\nFireman Second Class Ernest E. Lindsey, USS Huron\n\nErnest E. Lindsey was a Fireman Second Class aboard the Huron from about 1920 through 1922. He was born about 1902 and raised in Kansas joined the navy and served on the USS Huron on the Asiatic Station. According to the family Ernest married a Russian woman in Shanghai, China in 1922. She had fled from Vladivostok to Shanghai just prior to the revolution in 1919-1920.\n\nLt. Edgar Allen Poe, USMC\n\n1st Lt. Edgar Allan Poe, USMC. This is the photo from his United States Passport with the official seal stamped into the photograph.\n\nOn May 2, 1908 aboard the armored cruiser USS South Dakota routine duties takes a Yeoman to the Captains cabin and hands the Commanding Officer a document to be signed. Captain Charles E. Fox, the Commanding Officer of the ship signs the document, which is an appointment of Boatswain Mate First Class William H. Foster to Chief Boatswain’s Mate for a period of 12-months. This document was then renewed on May 2, 1909.\n\nBut who was William H. Foster, and what story does his life tell us today? His story begins about 1859 when he is the first-born child to John B. (b. abt. 1834 New York d. abt. 1911) and Caroline Crandall (b. abt. 1834 New York d. unknown) Foster. William was thought to have been born in late 1859, likely near the village of Addison, which is located in Rollin Township in Lenawee County, Michigan. Lenawee County is located in the extreme southeast part of Michigan and borders on the Michigan-Ohio State line. John Foster was a farmer and for at least the first decade or so of William’s life they lived in Rollin Township Michigan.\n\nFrom about 1870 until 1908 little is known of William’s life except that about 1898 William married. His wife’s first name was Elizabeth who was also born in Michigan and was about the same age as William.\n\nDuring 1908 we know that William was already serving as a Boatswain’s Mate First Class in the United States Navy aboard the USS South Dakota. So it is assumed he was actually serving in the navy some time before 1908. William served aboard the South Dakota from at least 1908 through July of 1910 and possibly past that date. On July 8, 1910 the United States Federal Census was taken aboard the South Dakota when the ship was at sea steaming from San Francisco to Callao, Peru in South America. William is listed as a Chief Boatswain’s Mate, and at the time he was 45-years old and had been married for 12-years. Chief Foster was one of 3 Chief Boatswain’s aboard the South Dakota and may have been the senior of the three Chiefs.\n\nIt is not known when Chief Foster left the navy, but by January of 1920 he was no longer serving in the navy. William and Elizabeth were at the time living in Cincinnati, Ohio on Reading Road where William was working as a department store manager. He and Elizabeth appear not to have had any children, but in 1920 they did employ a 31-year old single black woman named Dottie Myer who was a live-in cook for William and Elizabeth.\n\nAfter the time of the taking of the 1920 Federal Census in January of 1920 little is known of William’s life. In fact the only thing that is known is that he had passed away sometime between the taking of the 1920 Federal Census and the taking of the 1930 Census. On the 1930 Census Elizabeth Foster is listed as living on Madison Road in Cincinnati, was a widow and was then 72-years old. It is not known where William is burried. Elizabeth is thought to have lived past 1940 as she is listed as being 82 years old and a widow. She lived in Cincinnati at 1344 Observatory Road in the home of her daughter Marie F. Hill who was a 53-year old widow. Marie would have been born about 1887 and so it is possible that William and Elizabeth may have had a child before they were married about 1898 as it stated on the 1910 Federal Census.\n\nChief Storekeeper George L. Carter\n\nGeorge Leonard Carter was born on February 6, 1888 in Reno, Kansas, and was youngest of 10 children born to Thomas Jackson Carter, a Confederate Civil War veteran (Co. D, 27th Georgia Volunteer Infantry) and his wife Susan E. Prater. After the Civil War the family removed from Hall County, Georgia first to Clay County, Missouri, then to Leavenworth County, Kansas, settling in Reno.\n\nWhen George L. Carter was about 18-years old he joined the United States Navy in 1907, which would lead him on a 31-year journey with the Navy. He would retire from Active Service on February 1, 1938. And during WWII He again served in the Navy from May of 1942 through1946, ending a total of 35-years Active Duty in the Navy. His final rating was Chief Boatswain’s Mate.\n\nIn 1910 George, then age 22, was serving as a Chief Storekeeper aboard the South Dakota, which is known from the 1910 Federal Census. This is also confirmed from his photo in uniform showing his sleeve rating of Chief Storekeeper.\n\nThe enlisted rating of a Storekeeper is now an obsolete rating structure in the navy, having been combined into the present rating of Logistics Specialist (LS). Storekeeper was one of the oldest Navy ratings, and Storekeepers were tasked with maintaining ship or company military supply stores. Their responsibilities generally included purchasing and procurement, shipping and receiving, and issuing of equipment, tools, consumables or anything else obtained through the Naval Supply Systems.\n\nAbout 1913 Chief Carter was married, her first name being Pearl who was born about 1894. Together they had at least one child. Because Chief Carter was serving on Active Duty and was based out of the Bremerton Navy Yard he and Pearl moved to Bremerton, Washington were they would live the rest of their lives. On December 12, 1954 George L. Carter would pass away in Bremerton, Washington.\n\nThere is a photo of Chief Carter with writing to a family member on the back which reads:\n\nSeaman 2c, Ivan Martin Ashley, USS South Dakota/USS Huron\n\nIvan Martin Ashley was a Seaman Second Class who served aboard the USS South Dakota during WWI.\n\nIvan was born on April 5, 1897 in Rye, Colorado and lived his entire life in Colorado. His parents were Nancy and Joseph Ashley who were both born in North Carolina. The Ashley family were rancher/farmers in the Rye area. Nancy and Joseph lived and worked on the Cuerno Verde Resort Ranch located in Rye, which was an exclusive resort for the well-to-do in the Pueblo, Colorado area.\n\nAt the age of 21-years, Ivan enlisted into the United States Naval Reserve Force on June 3, 1918, before he had to register for the Federal Draft. Two days later, Ivan went to Pueblo, Colorado and registered for the Federal Draft during the second call-up. At the time, he was single and was working for his father on the Cuerno Verde Resort Ranch in Rye. He listed his mother Nancy, as next of kin. Ivan was a tall, medium built man with gray eyes and dark brown hair.\n\nIvan served his entire time in the Navy aboard the USS South Dakota on convoy escort duty in the North Atlantic escorting troopships to France. His stated date of separation from the Naval Reserve is listed as September 30, 1921, but on the 1920 Federal Census taken on January 3, 1920 it listed Ivan as being married and living with his parents on the farm in Rye, Colorado. This may be explained that being he was not in the Regular Navy but in the Reserve Force, he may have been discharged at the end of the War in November of 1918, and then remained in the Reserve Force until his term was up being discharged in 1921.\n\nIvan after his separation from the Navy came home to live with his parents at the Cuerno Verde Ranch, and in the summer of 1919 fell in love with a woman named Nellie, and they were married in the early fall of that year. The wedding took place at the ranch on September 23, 1919. Nellie S. was born on March 10, 1899 in Illinois, and, at the time she met Ivan, was working as a nanny for the Gast family of Pueblo. The Gast’s were an affluent family and had spent quite a lot of time at the Cuerno Verde Ranch, where Ivan’s parents lived and worked. It was here at the ranch that Nellie and Ivan had met. After Nellie and Ivan were married Ivan in January of 1920 was working for a dairy farmer in the Rye area. Ivan also worked as a meat cutter for the Ashley/Dykes Mercantile as a second job.\n\nBy 1930 Ivan and Nellie had now moved into the city of Pueblo, Colorado to a home on West Evans Avenue. At the time Ivan, had taken a job working at a coke producing mill as a heater operator. By 1930 Ivan and Nellie had three children; Mary Eleanor; Cecilia Nancy; and Ivan Martin Jr., and in 1932 a fourth child was born, a daughter named Cynthia Ann. She would pass away on February 24 of 1938 at the age of 6 from the effects of Polio. The home on Evans Avenue was a rented home and their rent was 25-dollars per month.\n\nTen years later in 1940 the family was still in Pueblo although may not have been in the same house. Ivan was still working at the coke mill now as a foreman, and the eldest daughter Mary who was then 19-years old was working as an office girl, and Cecilia was working as a Liberian. Nellie worked as a cook for the school. Living in the home were two small children, LeRoy and Sue Miller age 4 and 2 years. It was not known what the relationship was between the two Miller children and the Ashley’s.\n\nIt was in 1944 when Ivan had the opportunity to go back into farming, and so he and Nellie purchased a 160-acre dairy farm in the Rye, Colorado area. This was a farm located just north of the home of Ivan’s mother Nancy, who was by then widowed. Ivan worked the farm and milked cows 7-days a week until 1955 when he had a heart attack. Ivan was told he could no longer farm because of his health, and so he sold about 40-acres of the farm in order to finance the building of a new home for he and Nellie. The new home was finished but Ivan would only live in it a short time for he passed away on October 3, 1957. Nellie would live in the house her husband Ivan built for 30-years, until her death on January 15, 1987.\n\nToday, Kim (Ashley) Geier, who is the daughter of Ivan Jr. and granddaughter of Ivan Martin Ashley Sr., still owns the house that her grandfather Ivan had built in 1955. Today Ivan Martin Ashley, Sr. and his wife Nellie are buried next to each other in the Brookside Cemetery in Rye, Colorado. Also, buried in the family plot are Cynthia Ann who died in 1938 of Polio and Ivan Jr. who passed away on July 12, 1983, along with Ivan’s parents Joseph and Nancy and his grandparents James and Susan Ashley.\n\nDog Tag of Ivan M.

Reverse side of the dog tag with his fingerprint etched in.\n\nAccording to the naval regulations set forth by the Navy Department on May 12, 1917, each man's fingerprint was required to be etched to the unmarked side of each tag. The process involved applying the fingerprint with printer's ink, then sprinkling the area with finely powdered glisonite or asphaltum which would adhere to the ink. Once the ink had dried, the excess powder was removed by simply blowing it off. The dog tag was then heated to a temperature slightly above the boiling point of water and permitted to cool before being placed into a solution of nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, and water for a period of one hour. Upon completion of this process, the dog tag was dried and was now imprinted with the wearer's fingerprint. This requirement was discontinued at the end of January 1943. According to Navy Regulations this was what was described for the Dog Tags. “The identification tag for officers and enlisted men of the Navy consists of an oval plate of monel metal, 1.25 by 1.50 inch, perforated at one end and suspended from the neck by a monel wire encased in a cotton sleeve. The tag has on one side the etched finger print of the right index finger. On the other side are to be etched the individual’s initials and surname, the month, day, and year of enlistment (expressed in numerals, e.g., 1.5.1916) and the month, day, and year of birth (similarly expressed). This side will also bear the letters U.S.N.; for officers – initials and surname, the rank held, and date of appointment. The etching of the tag shall be done by such member or members of the Hospital Corps as the medical officer may designate.”\n\nNellie and Ivan Ashley Ivan Ashley in summer whites\n\nFireman First Class, Charles V. Feliz\n\nDeep within the hull of the armored cruiser USS South Dakota a group of seven of the South Dakota’s black gang, dirty with coal dust, stop and pose for a photo outside of coalbunker M6. Their clothes show wear and are tattered and are covered in coal dust. Their faces are dusty, and even the tin cup of a refreshing drink, one of the seven is holding, likely even tastes of coal dust.\n\nThe photo shows seven hearty sailors, who by the sweat of their labors, propelled the South Dakota across the Pacific Ocean to do her appointed job. There is nothing too special about this photo except that on the back one of the seven sailors has written this, “With Best Regards to Mrs. J. S. Cans from C. V. Feliz USS South Dakota.”\n\nIt is not known who “Mrs. J. S. Cans” was or what the relationship between them was. But Feliz does not identify himself in this photo and so the face of the man who wrote this will likely never be identified. But the story of who C. V. Feliz was can be told, and this is his story. C. V. Feliz is Charles “Carl” Vincent Feliz born on August 8 of 1888 in King City, California. Very little is known of his family except that he did have a younger brother named Arthur Feliz who was about a year younger than Charles. It also seems that during his life Charles also went by the name of Carl. During his time serving in the navy he seems to use Charles and then in his middle and later years just used Carl.\n\nThe photo also does not identify what the date is and it is known that he served a 4-year term in the navy and that he was aboard the South Dakota in July of 1910. So it can be assumed that he had joined the Navy as early as 1906 or 1907 at about age 18.\n\nThe first positive identification comes from the 1910 Federal Census taken aboard the USS South Dakota on July 12, 1910 while the ship was at sea en route from Callao, Peru to San Francisco, California. Feliz, Charles V. Fireman First Class aged 21-years and single was listed as one of the crew. On the census form it also listed that his father and mother were born in California.\n\nOn June 5, 1917 when Charles Feliz had to register for the Federal Draft during the first call up during WWI he listed that he had served a 4-year term in the U. S. Navy, as Fireman First Class. So, if Charles had joined, when or shortly after he turned 18-years old, this would put his beginning date at 1906-07 and his ending date at about 1910-11. Charles did not serve during WWI.\n\nWhen he registered for the WWI Draft, on June 5, he was married and was then 28-years old. He and his wife lived at 1317 De Long Street in Los Angeles and Charles was working as an auto mechanic for the Pacific Auto Spring Company. He was described as a medium height man with a stout build with brown eyes and dark colored hair. So, from this description one would guess that Charles V. Feliz may be the second man from the right in the photo, but this is only a guess.\n\nBy the beginning of 1920 Charles or by then he was using the name Carl was divorced and was living in a rented apartment with his brother Arthur. The apartment was located at 516 E. 23rd Street in Los Angeles. Carl still had the job at the automobile spring factory, and his brother was unemployed at the time.\n\nBy the spring of 1930 Carl Feliz had a new direction on his life. It seems that he was remarried. Little is known of his second wife except for her name, Frances Elizabeth Ray, who was born on November 17, 1891 in Illinois as was both of her parents. Frances was a public-school teacher. She and Carl lived at the time on Magnolia Avenue in Los Angeles, and the monthly rent for the apartment was $35. Carl was working as an auto mechanic in a local garage, which was likely the same shop he had been at for several years.\n\nDuring the Depression years, in 1935, Carl and Frances had moved in with Frances’ mother, Mary Ray, who was a 73-year old widow. The home was located on West 21st Street in Los Angeles. Carl by then had now bought the automotive spring shop and was now the owner, and Frances was still teaching school. Carl and Frances did not have any children together.\n\nIn 1942 when Carl had to register for the draft during WWII, he and Frances had now moved from the home on West 21st Street. Likely due to the passing of Frances’ mother. They were now living at 1236 West 24th Street in Los Angeles. Carl listed his occupation as the owner of the Standard Auto Spring Company located at 1626 South Los Angeles Street, in Los Angeles.\n\nCarl and Frances would live the rest of their lives in the Los Angeles, California area. Frances passed away on June 6, 1955 and was buried in the Rose Hill Memorial Park in the Whittier section of Los Angeles. Carl lived for three more years and on June 24, 1958 Carl Feliz passed away in Ventura, California. He was buried next to Frances his wife.\n\nSeaman 2c John Frederick Woodward\n\nSeaman 2c John Frederick Woodward, USS South Dakota\n\nIn the United States Navy of the First World War, not every sailor was an American, some had just arrived a few years before in America, and would serve in uniform, their newly adopted Country and ask nothing in return. One such man was John Frederick Woodward, who was born in Liverpool, England in 1892.\n\nIt is known that his father was Robert Woodward who was born in England about 1869. John Woodward’s mother is assumed to be Marie (Mary Alice) Woodward who was also English and was born about 1862. The exact date is not known for sure but it may have been about 1893 when Robert left his family in England and came to America. Robert Woodward was likely coming to America in search of better work and a new life for his family.\n\nIt is not clear if John Frederick Woodward came to America in 1903 or if he may have come over with his father Robert about 1893 when he was but just a year old. The first actual clear picture of the Woodward family in America comes from information gleaned from the 1910 Federal Census taken on April 15, 1910.\n\nIn Klickitat County, Washington along the Columbia River that divides the State of Washington from Oregon, Robert Woodward and his 18-year old son John Frederick settled. On the census form, there is not a wife listed for Robert, but there is a notation that he was married and had been married for 19-years, so it can be assumed that his wife, Mary Alice, was still in England. On the form, it also noted that Robert had filed his papers with the Government to begin his process to become a citizen. John Frederick had either not begun the process or it simply was not noted on the form. Interestingly enough on the form John Frederick seemed to be known by a shortened version of his middle name as he is listed as Fred on the census form.\n\nRobert and John or, “Fred” as he was known, both were fruit farming in the lush fertile lands along the Columbia River. They both would learn the ways of the fruit farmers in the area and this would be a skill that would serve them both throughout their lives.\n\nOther information from the 1910 census tells this story. Robert and John were living on a fruit farm in Lyle Township of Klickitat County, Washington, likely near the very small town of Lyle. At the farm, next to them was the George Woodward family, which consisted of Jane or Gene who was his wife, and a 19-year old daughter named Martha, all three having been born in England. George was most likely Robert’s older brother. It was noted that the George Woodward family had started paperwork for citizenship in 1909, so it is not clear if he would have come to America with his brother Robert or at a later date. George also was working as a fruit farmer likely with his brother Robert.\n\nBy the spring of 1917 America was now involved in the “European War” and at the age of 24-years, John Frederick Woodward decided to join the United States Navy. It was on April 3, 1917, three days before America declared war with Germany, that, John Frederick Woodward voluntarily enlisted into the NNV or National Naval Volunteers in Portland, Oregon.\n\nUp to 1913 the only organization that made any pretense of training men for the navy was the Naval Militia, and that was under State control, with practically no Federal supervision. As the militia seemed to offer the only means of producing a trained reserve, steps were at once taken to put it on a sound basis, and on February 16, 1914, a real Naval Militia under Federal control was created, provision being made for its organization and training in peace, as well as its utilization in war.\n\nAs with all organized militia, the Naval Militia, even with the law of 1914, could not, under the Constitution, be called into service as such except for limited duties, such as to repel invasion. It could not be used outside the territorial limits of the United States. It is evident then that with such restrictions militia could hardly meet the requirements of the navy in a foreign war, and to overcome this difficulty the \"National Naval Volunteers\" were created in August of 1916. Under this act members of Naval Militia organizations were authorized to volunteer for \"any emergency,\" of which emergency the President was to be the judge.\n\nAfter he had volunteered for the NNV in Portland, John Woodward traveled from his home in Klickitat County, Washington, to Seattle and Reported for Active Duty at the Receiving Ship at the Puget Sound Navy Yard on April 10, 1917. He would learn the basic training he would need for his new Navy life and on June 30, 1917, was assigned to duty aboard the armored cruiser USS South Dakota as an Apprentice Seaman.\n\nOn July 24, 1917, Woodward was advanced to Seaman Second Class and was assigned as a member of a gun crew. His station was on the starboard side aft, in the lower gunroom. This was likely the gunroom for the aft main 8-inch battery, or one of the secondary 6-inch guns. While aboard the South Dakota, Seaman Woodward kept a personal diary, which is today in the possession of his grandson Vaughan. In the diary, John writes in great detail about gun construction, types of shells, fuses, and primers that the USS South Dakota used. Seaman Woodward also writes of the convoys of transport ships the South Dakota escorted to rendezvous points in the Atlantic with British destroyers, and then they would turn around and head back to the east coast of the States to pick up another convoy.\n\nServing aboard an American cruiser, and technically still not an American citizen, I wonder what thoughts were going through John Woodward’s mind, when on the horizon of the Atlantic, he would see the destroyers flying the flag of his birth country.\n\nJohn notes in his diary early in 1917 when the South Dakota and her sister ships were patrolling the Caribbean and South American waters, they coaled the ship on the island of St. Lucia, British West Indies. There on the island women were hired at 50 cents per day to carry bags of coal weighing 105-pounds up a wooden ramp onto the deck of the South Dakota for 14-hours. John also noted that during his time aboard the South Dakota that he witnessed nearly 75 sea burials of men who would pass away from the Spanish influenza that was taking a toll on the population at the time.\n\nOn June 10, 1917, the South Dakota crosses the equator at 36 degrees Longitude on her voyage to Rio De Janeiro, Brazil. As per the ancient rites of the sea, those sailors who had never cross the line before undergo a ceremony for King Neptune, and are given the title of Shellback once they had been properly “ducked” in the traditions according to Neptune Rex. Seaman Woodward underwent these rites and was given his shellback document, which today preserved by his grandson Vaughan.\n\nSeaman Woodward remained on the South Dakota through the end of the war, and on November 29, 1918, was transferred off the ship. On December 21, 1918, Seaman Woodward reported to the Pelham Bay Naval Training Station. Pelham Bay is located near the city of The Bronx, New York. Likely within a few days after reporting to Pelham Bay Seaman Woodward would have been deactivated and allowed to go home. Likely sometime between Christmas and the New Year of 1919, John Woodward had returned home to Klickitat County to begin his civilian life anew. It would not be until April 2, 1920 that he would have been fully discharged from his enlistment period in the NNV. He was Honorably Discharged from the 13th Naval District headquartered at the Bremerton Navy Yard, in Seattle, Washington.\n\nBack in Klickitat County, Washington, John Frederick Woodward again was with his father Robert. But from the 1920 Federal Census, which was taken on January 7, 1920, it states that Robert’s wife and John’s mother Mary Alice was also living there. She may have been in America since about 1912 as the census also states she had filed papers to start her citizenship in 1912. Both Robert and John worked on a fruit farm and the home was located along the Lyle-Goldendale Road, which may have been the same farm from the 1910 census. By then the George Woodward family had moved about 5 or so miles away and were living near the small village of Appleton in Klickitat County. George may have still been working with Robert and John at the time.\n\nIn 1921, Robert, Mary Alice, and John Frederick Woodward would end their lives living in America, and move to Australia to begin a new life down under. The reasons are not known why they would leave America, but they made their way to Australia, and bought land there. And that may have been the reason, to buy land, which was likely very affordable and take their knowledge of fruit farming and begin a new opportunity of making a new life. Robert and John Frederick would use the American methods they had learned and started a 20-acre apple farm that grew into a great success. The farm was located near Wedderburn, which is a small town in New South Wales near Campbelltown. The apple farm may have been located along the Wedderburn Road near the intersection of Exlay Road, as there are apple farms in this area there today. There in Wedderburn, Australia John would marry and they would raise three daughters.\n\nAt the age of 68-years on September 26, 1960, John Frederick Woodward would pass away, and today is buried in the Woronora Cemetery in Sutherland, New South Wales, Australia. John Frederick Woodward certainly traveled his fair share of the earth from his birth in Liverpool, sailed the Atlantic Ocean many times over and traveled the width of the United States, and then sailing across the vast Pacific Ocean before he could rest his soul in the land down under."
