Written and directed by Lily Hayes Kaufman with co-creator Jackie Schwartz, the comedy follows Brenda (Jackie Zebrowski), an ambitious, stylish, confident and plus-sized woman living in NYC who launches a plus-size fashion line with her best friend Alix (Haley Rawson).

The cast features Jackie Zebrowski as Brenda, Haley Rawson as Alix, Stephanie Gibson (Cinderella) as Boss Lady, Christopher Chwee as Uber, Tony nominee Nancy Opel (Urinetown, Honeymoon in Vegas) and Zoe Geltman as Snooty Sales Lady.

According to the web series Indiegogo campaign, "Brenda works for Boss Lady (Stephanie Gibson) and her designer henchman Uber (Christopher Chwee) at a top NYC fashion house, but dreams of running her own plus size high couture fashion brand. Brenda is sick of shopping from Snooty Sales Ladies (Zoe Geltman) who only sell tiny sizes. Brenda is determined to prove Boss Lady wrong, and make her mom (Nancy Opel) proud, by launching her own line of couture for fashionable women of all body types."

The creatives are raising $10,000 to write, produce, film, edit and distribute eight episodes of "Rare Birds of Fashion."
