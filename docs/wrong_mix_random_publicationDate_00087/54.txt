“Stephanie Gibson is giving a hilarious, break-out performance as Gabrielle, the sweeter and smarter of Ella’s two stepsisters, in the Tony-winning musical Cinderella.” – Josh Ferri, BroadwayBox.com

From teaching dance lessons in her front yard in Texas at the age of 8 to appearing on Broadway in The Addams Family, Spamalot, and most recently as Stepsister Gabrielle in Cinderella, Stephanie Gibson has always had a lot to sing about.

Stephanie is excited to unleash her unique and sometimes unbelievable stories, her interpretations of musical classics, and some rarely heard (and just plain cuckoo) songs in her highly anticipated NYC solo show debut at Feinsteins/54 Below. Expect everything from Britney Spears to Bring Back Birdie.

Created and written by Steph and her pal Greg Santos, Music Directed by her Texas compadre (and the always in demand) Steven Jamail, and directed by Tony nominee Hunter Foster.

“More satisfying than eating an entire mouse!” -Trey, Steph’s Cat

“After seeing her show, I’m naming my new baby Steph!” -Kim Kardashian
