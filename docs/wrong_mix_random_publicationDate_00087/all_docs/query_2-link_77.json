Jo reads The Master & Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov.\n\n\"Okay, yes I am trying to recommend to you an experimental soviet novel but please don’t run away. \n\n\"While I can’t claim I completely understood this book I can tell you how it made me feel. Reading this book was joyful and fun and strange. I was more engaged by this novel than with anything I’ve read in years. It is a book that demands rereading and I so look forward to coming back to it again and again and again. \n\n\"Ultimately, this story left me with a feeling of hope.\n\n\"Having lived through a handful of world-ending historical events I find comfort in the idea that when all else fails, Satan may be your only salvation.\n\n\"What can I say?\n\n\"At heart, I’ll always be an optimist.\"\n\ngibsonsbookstore.com/Jo\".",
