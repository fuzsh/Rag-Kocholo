        "text": "(October 3, 2016) - The third Muny Magic at The Sheldon, The Muny’s new bi-annual showcase of favorite Muny artists, will be November 16 and 17 at 7:30 p.m. at The Sheldon Concert Hall. The concert evening will feature four beloved and talented leading ladies from recent Muny seasons in song tribute to some of the legendary talents who have appeared on The Muny stage throughout its 98 year history. They’ll be singing songs sung by Muny legends such as Ethel Merman, Shirley Jones and Bernadette Peters. This production of Muny Magic at The Sheldon is proudly sponsored by Kenneth and Nancy Kranzberg.\n\nThe talented quartet will be: Danielle Bowen (Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz, 2016); Ali Ewoldt (Maria in West Side Story, 2013; currently starring as Christine in the Broadway production of Phantom of the Opera); Stephanie Gibson (Inga in Young Frankenstein, 2016); and Elena Shaddow (Marian in The Music Man, 2016; Cinderella in Into The Woods, 2015). The evening will be music directed by Brad Haak (Fiddler on the Roof, Into The Woods, South Pacific, The King and I). The evening is produced by The Muny’s casting director and producing associate Megan Larche Dominick.\n\nAt the November 16th performance, Muny Artistic Director and Executive Producer Mike Isaacson will announce the line-up for The Muny’s highly-anticipated 2017 summer season.\n\n“We’ve had such a great time with our first two ‘Muny Magic’ evenings,” said Isaacson. “How thrilling to welcome these four wonderful talents back and to have them pay tribute to some of the great artists who were on our stage before them.”\n\nFollowing its thrilling premiere starring Tony award-winner Beth Leavel last November and The Buddy Holly Boys last April, this series will continue to welcome The Muny’s most beloved leading performers back for an intimate concert evening each fall and spring. The Muny Magic at The Sheldon series celebrates the performances and artistry of The Muny in its “off-season.”\n\n“The ‘Muny Magic’ series is a great way for our audiences to reconnect with the stars they’ve fallen in love with in recent seasons,” said Muny President and CEO Denny Reagan. “The opportunity to welcome these four remarkable ladies back to St. Louis, for an evening that pays tribute to the stars that have come before them, will be an incredibly fitting and moving nod to the rich history of The Muny.”\n\nThe November 16th and 17th performances of Muny Magic at The Sheldon will be held at The Sheldon Concert Hall - 3648 Washington Blvd, St. Louis, MO 63108 - at 7:30 p.m. Tickets range from $25 - $50.
