        "text": "\"Dipping in and out of storytelling and song, Regina expertly vacillates from emulating the poised opera singer, to her own hilarious contemporary character.\"\n\n​\n\n\"Her voice expertly flows between both light and clear then rich and resonating lower tones.\"\n\n​\n\n\"She’s endearingly frank and goofy as her vulnerable character–inciting roars of laughter.\" -THE KNOCKTURNAL\n\n\"Regina Gibson hold(s) the stage with skill...in a thought-provoking discovery, presented by a first-rate troupe.\"\n\n- KEN JAWOROWSKI, NEW YORK TIMES\n\n​\n\n\"Ms. Gibson is, at times, breathtakingly intense. She conveys not only the passion of her commitment, “I have even forgotten my people’s deeply cherished hate,” but the near madness she is driven to by the hysteria of the willfully ignorant. Her silent scream of agony was deafening. She has captured that feeling of “otherness” perfectly. This is the sort of play that should be mandatory viewing.\"\n\n- EYES ON WORLD CULTURES\n\n​\n\n\"the acting is of a high caliber. In the title role, Regina Gibson gives an impassioned, persuasive performance.\"\n\n- VICTOR GLUCK, THEATERSCENE.NET\n\n​\n\n\"the cast does a commendable job... Regina Gibson, as Leah, always keeps her dignity.\"\n\n- PAULANNE SIMMONS, CURTAIN UP\n\n​\n\n\"This production is a real winner for the Metropolitan Playhouse. The performances and creative elements come together in a harmonious collaboration\"\n\n- HOWARD MILLER, TALKIN BROADWAY\n\n​\n\n​\n\n\"superb actors are at every moment the person they are meant to be, delivering dialogue with such authenticity that the most astonishing things seem completely natural. There are portions of the play which are breathtakingly, heartbreakingly funny, and it is the actors that make it so.\"\n\n- DC Theatre Scene\n\n​\n\n\"Each actor exemplified great confidence in their dynamic roles.\"\n\n- DC Metro Theater Arts\n\n\"She is a powerhouse of a performer.\"\n\n​\n\n\"Gibson has the soul of a comedienne. With one pelvic thrust and a properly timed yawn, she deftly solicits raucous laughter.\"\n\n​\n\n\"Gibson wields her words with the confidence of a seasoned freestyle jazz performer.\"\n\nNewYorkTheatreReview\n\n​\n\n\"Regina is an accomplished actor, with a fluid style that lends itself perfectly to the rhymes and rhythms in this brilliant piece. The lightness of her delivery is in fine contrast to the depth of her subject matter.\"\n\n​\n\n\"It’s masterful writing, delivered with a gorgeous smile, and her luminous eyes glitter as she gambols about the stage, as fluid as a nymph.\"\n\n​\n\n​\"Her engaging performance is like a glass of fine wine, with deep undertones and delicious top notes.\"\n\nNYtheaternow.com\n\n​\n\n​"
