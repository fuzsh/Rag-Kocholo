        "text": "Ann Harada ends her run in Rodgers and Hammerstein’s Cinderella at the Broadway Theatre, opposite KeKe Palmer as Cinderella; NeNe Leakes as Madame, Cinderella’s stepmother; Joe Carroll as Prince Topher; Judy Kaye as Marie, The Fairy Godmother; and Stephanie Gibson as stepsister Gabrielle, on December 14, 2014.\n\nHarada has been giving “a hoot of a performance” (NY 1 News) as the evil stepsister Charlotte in Rodgers and Hammerstein’s Cinderella since the production, directed by Mark Brokaw and featuring a new book by four-time Tony nominee Douglas Carter Beane, based on the original book by Oscar Hammerstein II, began preview performances in January 2013.\n\n“Ann Harada and Stephanie Gibson rock as Ella’s stepsisters”\n\nElisabeth Vincentelli in the New York Post\n\n“The show “is looking perfectly splendid” and as for me: “Ann Harada (hilarious as the bratty step-sister who miscalculates her romantic strategies)”\n\nMichael Dale on Broadway World\n\n“Harada remains a spunky delight”\n\nMatthew Murray on Talkin’ Broadway\n\n“Ann Harada is still fresh as the delusional stepsister Charlotte with her show-stealing ‘Stepsister’s Lament'”.\n\nHayley Levitt on Theatermania\n\nThe Broadway premiere starred Laura Osnes as Cinderella; Santino Fontana as the Prince Topher; Victoria Clark as Marie, the Fairy Godmother; Harriet Harris as Madame, Cinderella’s stepmother; and Marla Mindelle as stepsister Gabrielle.\n\nMr. Beane’s book for Rodgers and Hammerstein’s Cinderella offers a new romantic twist on the ultimate makeover story of a maid-turned-princess, mixing fresh comedy and wit with the beloved tale’s classic elements — the pumpkin, glass slipper, masked ball and more. In addition to musical numbers from the original score, including “In My Own Little Corner,” “Impossible/It’s Possible,” “Ten Minutes Ago” and “Do I Love You Because You’re Beautiful?,” this Cinderella includes four additional songs from the Rodgers + Hammerstein “trunk.”\n\nThe Broadway Theatre is located at 1681 Broadway (Between West 52nd and 53rd Streets) in New York. Tickets to Rodgers and Hammerstein’s Cinderella, which plays its final performance on January 3, 2015, are on sale through Tele-charge and can be purchased by calling 212-239-6200 or online at www.telecharge.com.\n\nAnn Harada Plays Cinderella’s Stepsister Charlotte in Broadway Premiere of Rodgers and Hammerstein’s Cinderella at the Broadway Theatre\n\nFans may remember Harada as Christmas Eve, the heavily accented Japanese therapist in the hit show, Avenue Q, which she performed on Broadway and in London.

She has appeared in the films Admissions, Hope Springs, Feel, The Art of Getting By and Happiness; and recent television credits include “30 Rock,” “The Big C,” “Lipstick Jungle,” “Rescue Me,” “The Electric Company,” and a recurring role as Linda the stage manager on “Smash”.\n\nIn February, Broadway vet Harada was simply spectacular in the Allen Room at Frederick P. Rose Hall in New York, where she performed as part of Lincoln Center’s American Songbook Concert Series.\n\nHelmed by frequent collaborator Alan Muraoka, with musical direction by Gary Adler, Harada was joined by long time pal Kevin Pariseau, with whom she sang a series of Judy Garland duets.\n\nPhotos: Harriet Harris, John Tartaglia, Christine Toy Johnson, Alan Muraoka, James Saito and More celebrate Ann Harada’s Debut at Lincoln Center in the American Songbook Series\n\nOn Monday, December 8th, Harada will emcee “Arriving In Asian America,” a song cycle collectively written by members of the project with original words and music by Adam Gwon, Timothy Huang, Christine Toy Johnson, Ming Aldrich-Gan, Hyeyoung Kim (with Michael Cooper), Leon Ko, Robert Lee, Yoonmi Lee (with Gaby Gold & Zhu Yi), Yan Li, Jason Ma, J.
