        "text": "In this week’s Gotta Dance!, we’re putting Cinderella star Stephanie Gibson in the spotlight. This dazzling dancer has strutted her stuff on Broadway in Spamalot and The Addams Family after taking her talents across the country in her first big national tour A Chorus Line. Now that she’s reigning over the Broadway Theatre in the majestic Rodgers & Hammerstein musical, we sat down with Gibson to find out how this Texas two-stepper went from performing in her yard to flying high on the Great White Way.\n\nWatch the video to learn about Gibson’s passion for dance and her magical journey to Cinderella.\n\nAbout the Photographer\n\nMatthew Murphy is a New York City-based photographer specializing in theater and dance.
