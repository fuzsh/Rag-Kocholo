        "text": "Details of Disappearance\n\nGibson was last seen departing Memories, a bar in the 800 block of Main Street in Peoria, Illinois, at approximately 2:30 a.m. July 8, 1995. She was accompanied by Arlie Ray Davis at the time of her disappearance. They rode away in his car, a light blue four-door 1979 Dodge Dart with license plates numbered MMJ 296.\n\nDavis claimed that he and Gibson visited Kingston Mines in Illinois afterwards, but no evidence was discovered to support his statement. Gibson has never been heard from again. She resided in the 600 block of Voris Street in 1995.\n\nDavis was convicted of the murder of another Illinois woman in the late 1990s and was sentenced to death. Prostitutes working in the Peoria area reported that Davis enjoyed strangling and beating them in the early 1990s. Investigators said that he suffered from a sexual dysfunction and felt inferior towards women.\n\nGibson is one of several missing women from the Peoria area; others include Loretta Tinkham and Cheryl Murray. Another woman named Sheryl Murwin vanished from Peoria in 1994; her skull was found in 2001 and identified in 2003.\n\nAuthorities do not know if the cases are related, but it is possible that the women came into contact with Davis. He died after suffering a heart attack on death row in October 2002.\n\nDavis consistently maintained his innocence in the disappearances. Several unidentified female bodies have been located in the Peoria area in recent years, but the victims are not believed to be related to the missing women's cases."
