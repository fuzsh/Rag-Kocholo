        "text": "In January 2022, after delivering my “Valley Road” series of still life florals to a cafe for a solo show, I felt ready to start something new. While painting those flowers and vases, I noticed I was enjoying making the texture of the backgrounds every bit as much as the forms for the vases and flowers. Once those florals were complete and ready to hang, I had time to focus on painting without a desired outcome - painting without worrying about filling a spot in a show. After months of being in “production” mode, I was excited to paint with a focus on exploration. I dove into experiments with texture and color that developed into the abstract paintings I am making now. This series is still in progress, and is shaping up to be quite large. I have finished several pieces and am excited to share some sneak peeks.\n\nLike most of my work, these paintings have roots in my family history. Living in a house built by my great-grandparents, Norman and Helen, and most recently owned by my father, means that every day I walk in their footsteps. I carry laundry up two flights of stairs, to be put away in the same closets where Helen stored her bed linens, dresses and shoes. I plant flowers in soil of the most amazing texture and richness, the result of years of Norman and my father lovingly layering fresh compost around the annuals. As I write this, I sit at the built-in desk where two previous generations sat to pay their bills. There is something about knowing the people who lived here before me, or more accurately, being related to and knowing the lives of the people who lived here before me, that brings a nostalgic significance to everything I do.\n\nAnd of course, because it is a family home, I have my own memories that greet me. When I walk down my steep driveway to the mailbox, I can remember walking down that driveway as a child. My great-grandparents were hosting three generations for an extended family picnic. I had just walked down the driveway with some of my Dad’s younger cousins, and they held my hands and swung me when I was too tired to walk back up. My children hunted for Easter eggs in the yard, long before I had any knowledge that this would one day be my home. The back porch is where a local artist and high school friend of my father’s taught me to play chess when I was 14. It is also where I told my father I needed to have a biopsy, and for the first time in my life, saw a crack in his strong exterior. My brush with cancer was just a scare, but his was not. I spent countless hours sitting quietly with him, on the porch, by the fireplace, in his bedroom (now my bedroom), when he had no energy to move.\n\nWe have a large shed, originally built to protect firewood. Thirty years ago, my father added sides and began using it to store tools and unused objects as well. This shed is filled to the brim, and despite living here for three years now, we have not yet mustered the stamina to sort through it. Without diving too far into the chaos, we can see a bicycle from the 1950’s (painted such a perfect shade of teal/aqua); an old milk jug with peeling paint - three different layers of color; the plain white cabinets from the first version of the kitchen; and the motorcycle that my Dad stopped riding after an accident in the 1980’s.\n\nAs I work on this group of paintings, names for the series are beginning to hum around me. The word “palimpsest” keeps floating around in my mind. This means “something reused or altered but still bearing visible traces of its earlier form.” What a perfect description of my life in this house! And of course, it is also an accurate description of these paintings in which bits of every layer peek out.\n\nI also like the idea of a title that references patchwork quilts. Helen was a quilter, and I imagine her in the room I use as a studio, with her quilting frame set up, and the windows open, working, and listening to the birds in the trees and feeling thankful for longer days and better light. The geometric form of the paintings in this series remind me of a patchwork quilt, and I like this nod to Helen in my work.\n\nI have been working on these paintings for a couple months and as I work, titles are starting to emerge for the finished ones. The orange one reminds me of the car my father drove shortly after my parents split up: a red Mercedes. He never sold that car. It sat by the shed and faded to the orange color of my painting. The dark blue painting with bright pops of orange inexplicably reminds me of playing flashlight tag. And the largest so far, 36x36 inches, reminds me of the sunset seen through the trees in winter. And just today, I finished a small 8x8, that I think will be titled “Milk Jug.”\n\nI hope to have this series completed for a show in the fall. Let me know what you think about series titles in the comments below: Palimpsest? Patchwork? Iwould love to hear which words connects with you!\n\nI will be posting regular studio notes here as I work on it through the spring and summer.
