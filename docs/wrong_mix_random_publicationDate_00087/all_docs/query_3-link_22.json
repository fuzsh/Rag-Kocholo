Our speakers shared their insights into the current financial environment, strategies to capitalize on market dislocations and capital vacuums, and updates on AB CarVal’s global opportunistic credit strategy were invaluable. The session was a wealth of information and a platform for interactive discussions, helping us navigate the current financial climate and address critical questions. We eagerly anticipate your participation in our upcoming events for more enlightening conversations. Stay connected for more updates! #BernsteinPrivateWealthManagement\n\nOur #BernsteinTampa office hosted an insightful event for #nonprofit and #foundation leaders, fiduciaries, and board members. The discussion, led by Clare Golla, CFP® , National Managing Director of Philanthropic Services, provided a deep dive into the potential impact of the economy and capital markets on philanthropy and explored promising fundraising strategies and giving vehicles. In an era marked by economic uncertainty, fluctuating interest rates, political shifts, and evolving philanthropic giving trends, funders and their beneficiary organizations strive for stability and preparedness as we approach 2024. The conversation also shed light on how leaders in the social sector manage and invest in their most valuable asset - their people. In these challenging times, a holistic and coordinated approach to balance sheets, revenue generation, and spending is more crucial than ever. This event underscored the importance of such an approach, offering valuable insights for strategic planning in the current landscape. Reach out to me if you are interested in learning more!"
