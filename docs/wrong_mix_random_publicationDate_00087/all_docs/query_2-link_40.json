When the roaring 20’s collapsed into the reeling 30’s, these industrialists, laborers and their families mortgaged all that was safe and reasonable for the dream of leaving their mark on New York City and the world. EMPIRE is a celebration of the American spirit with big dance numbers, pop-driven melodies, and captivating spectacle.
