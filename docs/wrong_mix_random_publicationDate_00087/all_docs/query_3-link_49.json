Brenda is sick of shopping from Snooty Sales Ladies (Zoe Geltman) who only sell tiny sizes. Brenda is determined to prove Boss Lady wrong, and make her mom (Nancy Opel) proud, by launching her own line of couture for fashionable women of all body types.\"\n\nThe creatives are raising $10,000 to write, produce, film, edit and distribute eight episodes of \"Rare Birds of Fashion.\""
