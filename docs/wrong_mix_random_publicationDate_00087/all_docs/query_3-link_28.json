Shuck (stage manager), Alexander Woodward (scenic design), Ryan Park (costumes), Paul Miller (lighting), Rory Dale (sound) and Evan O'Brient (line producer and general manager).\n\nShow times are scheduled for Oct. 7 at 8 PM, Oct. 9 at 4:30 PM, Oct. 12 at 4:30 PM, Oct. 13 at 8 PM, Oct. 15 at 8 PM, Oct. 16 at 1 PM and Oct. 17 at 4:30 PM.
