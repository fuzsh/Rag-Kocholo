        "text": "German is famously a language chock-full of long words to describe very specific portions of the human condition. Think “schadenfreude,” for that feeling of taking delight in the suffering of others, or maybe “weltschmerz,” which is a way of naming the world-weary disillusionment that comes with age and experience. One of my personal favorites is “fremdschämen,” that sort of secondhand embarrassment one sometimes feels when you witness a good friend doing something mighty cringeworthy. German linguists truly have no peers.\n\nAfter viewing the Arkansas Repertory Theatre’s current production of “Guys & Dolls,” I’m now in need of a good German word for “wondering when an aging musical becomes a parody of itself — and whether that parody is on purpose.”\n\n“Guys & Dolls” has been a huge part of the theatrical landscape for more than 70 years now, bursting onto the scene in 1950, scooping up a Tony award for Best Musical and staging more than 1,200 performances on Broadway in its original run. Many of its multiple revivals on Broadway and London have also been award winners. Even if you’ve never seen the play, bits of its soundtrack (“Luck Be a Lady” and “A Bushel and a Peck”, for instance) are undoubtedly lodged in your head from either your father’s shower singing or being referenced on a random episode of “The Simpsons.”\n\nTo recap the plot: “Guys & Dolls” is set in Depression-era New York and focuses on the efforts of small-time gambler Nathan Detroit (Carlos Lopez) to maintain his “oldest established permanent floating Crap game in New York” in the face of beefed-up police scrutiny. As several well-heeled gamblers arrive in town looking for action, Nathan works feverishly to find a location for the potentially profitable game while avoiding both police and discovery by his fiancée of 14 years (the wonderfully quirky Miss Adelaide, played by Stephanie Gibson) to whom he’s promised a life without gambling. To further complicate matters, Nathan seeks to fund the game by wagering that wealthy gambler Sky Masterson (Christian McQueen) can’t convince idealistic local missionary Sarah Brown (Kim Onah) to join Masterson on a trip to Havana. Complications! Deception! True love blooming! Singing and dancing! It’s a recipe for fun, no doubt.\n\nThe Rep’s production was somewhat slow to start, with Act One suffering from several muffed lines and one-liners that landed rather flatly with the audience. This reviewer wondered if the problem lay with the delivery or the fact that some zingers from 1950 just aren’t as funny in 2022. Happily, Act Two was much more lively and energetic thanks largely to excellent dance numbers (“Take Back Your Mink” and “The Crapshooters’ Dance,” especially). It’s worth noting that choreography for this production was ably handled by Gustavo Zajac, whose long list of domestic and international accomplishments also include being an alumnus of our state’s own Hendrix College in Conway.\n\nPerhaps the high point of the show was Stephanie Gibson as Adelaide. Gibson gave a performance that was alternately wry and yearning, comic and romantic. She especially shone on “Adelaide’s Lament,” in which she explored the physical and emotional effects of being Nathan’s long-suffering (and long-waiting) fiancée.\n\nAlso worthy of note was Kim Onah’s excellent vocal performance as missionary Sarah Brown. Brown excelled on “I’ll Know” with Christian McQueen’s Sky Masterson, and her character’s somewhat tipsy rendition of “If I Were a Bell” was a gem.\n\nOverall, the production left this reviewer somewhat unsatisfied (despite its requisite happy ending for everyone). Tightening up delivery and timing can only help and will surely improve as the run continues. Also, I’ll admit that since every Golden Age musical has been relentlessly spoofed for decades, it’s sometimes difficult for a modern audience member to just take a straight production at face value. While theater patrons of the past no doubt recognized the comic caricatures for what they were, I found myself unsure of whether I was watching a parody or a clever parody of a parody.\n\nFor instance, it’s clear to me that quick-talking “Noo Yawk” accents have frequently been exaggerated as part of the original comedic effect — but in contemporary performances, it’s almost as if we are witnessing parodies not of the characters anymore but rather of this particular theatrical genre itself. Add in a few wisecracking asides, some deadpan one-liners, plus a few call-and-response songs about falling in love, and what was once a novel dramatic formula is nowadays akin to receiving a real-time wink and a nod from the actors. Do we love the play, or do we love being in the know about its absurdity? Perhaps it doesn’t even matter in the grand scheme of things, but it’s a peril of period plays like this one.\n\nRevisiting our crack team of German linguists, I fully realize that criticizing or overthinking a Broadway evergreen like “Guys & Dolls” could quite fairly qualify me as having an utterly slappable face (backpfeifengesicht) or open me up to charges of making something worse by trying to improve it (verschlimmbessern). That’s fine. “Guys & Dolls” is inarguably a stone-cold theatrical classic that most everyone will love to see at The Rep. It’ll make a fine evening out for you and your best guy or doll. Just go in knowing that you might have to let go of your “erbsenzähler” (control freak) side of things for a couple of hours.\n\n“Guys & Dolls” plays at the Arkansas Repertory Theatre Nov. 30-Dec. 31. Tickets range from $30-$65."
