        "text": "What has inspired you to stay at Bernstein for as long as you have?\n\nMoney management is a humbling business. We don’t always get it right, but we always do the right thing. One of my primary attractions to Bernstein, and one of the reasons I’ve remained here for almost two decades, is because of the extraordinary people and resources. Our firm has a global footprint and a world-class research team that I feel privileged to work with daily. I am someone who is nourished by learning something new every day and derives immense pleasure from improving the lives of others. Bernstein provides me with a platform to leverage my own experience, instincts and knowledge so I can help my clients who include dynamic business owners, executives and multigenerational families around the globe. I also feel thankful to work for a firm whose goals, fiduciary culture, work ethic and commitment to integrity align with my own. In totality, this is what makes me proud to be a Bernstein advisor.\n\nWhat kind of experience do you offer to your clients?\n\nDeveloping deep, trusted relationships is at the core of what I do. I have developed a “high touch” practice where clear and frequent communication is integral to every client experience. Understanding family dynamics and each individual’s hopes, fears and personal relationship toward money makes up the foundation of my work. Next, I draw from my own experience to design a custom approach to achieve their desired outcomes. However, my work isn’t solely about strategy. It is just as important to me that my clients leave every conversation understanding both the goal and process every step of the way. Another skill I use to invest in my clients is my innate ability to be a connector. I distinctly remember reading a chapter in Malcolm Gladwell’s book The Tipping Point and having an “aha moment” about my own natural gift for making connections. I have always enjoyed using this talent to positively impact others. In my eyes, making a difference every day is as good as it gets.\n\nWhich personal accomplishment makes you proudest?"
