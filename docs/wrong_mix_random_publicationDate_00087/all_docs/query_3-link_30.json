        "text": "Neighborhood Association\n\nWhen Bellemeade-Bayard Park neighborhood was initially developed, City maps show the eastern boundary to be what is now known as South Kentucky Avenue, hence the Bellemeade Park area was among the first suburbs of Evansville.\n\nBayard Park is a 10-acre tract that was donated to the City in 1901 by the widow of Evansville banker, Samuel Bayard. The pair of cast iron dogs on the Kentucky Avenue side of the park stand guard and were originally part of the entrance to the Bayard home on S.E. First Street.\n\nThe park is punctuated by two notable structures; The Carnegie Library (East Branch Library) on East Chandler Avenue is one of two in Evansville (the other is on West Franklin Street in the Lamasco Neighborhood). Construction began in 1911; the building was dedicated in 1913. Remnants of the old Chandler Avenue School which became Stanley Hall Enrichment Center (and later home to the Boom Squad, Inc.) hark back to the turn of the 19/20th Century when the park was just a woodsy rural area.\n\nBy 1915, some of Evansville’s most stately homes in a variety of architectural styles were being constructed there. Early residents of this neighborhood were among Evansville’s white-collar professionals and business owners who strived to ensure their neighborhood was kept up. Some of the notable neighbors were Claude Wertz (Wertz Lumber Company), Herbert Woods (H.A. Woods Pharmacy), August Brentano (Keller Crescent), and Winfield K. Denton (attorney and eight-term U.S. Congressman).\n\nIt wasn’t until 1975 that a formal neighborhood association was organized making it one of the earliest such organizations established in the city. The association continues in this tradition of maintaining neighborhood standards. Their boundaries are: Highway 41 to the east, Garvin Street to the west, Lincoln Avenue to the north, and Washington Avenue to the south.\n\nMeetings are held at the East Branch Library on the second Monday (February – November) at 6 p.m.\n\nOfficers\n\nPresident: Stephanie Gibson\n\nVice-President: Talmadge Vick II\n\nSecretary: Kathleen Kanai\n\nTreasurer: Talmadge Vick II/Stephanie Gibson\n\nRepresentatives: Stephanie Gibson & Talmadge Vick\n\nMeeting Information\n\nDate: 2nd Monday (February – November)\n\nTime: 6:00pm\n\nPlace: Evansville Vanderburgh Public Library – East Branch\n\n840 E. Chandler Ave (at Bedford), Lower Level\n\nPlease contact Stephanie Gibson at 812-459-9644 or\n\nollanza18@gmail.com to verify date/location of meeting.\n\nAffiliations\n\nThis neighborhood is also a member of the Focus Neighborhood Council through the City of Evansville-Department of Metropolitan Development.\n\nEPD Sector\n\nThis neighborhood is in the South Sector on Beat 1\n\nCrime Prevention Officer (CPO): Nick Sandullo 812-435-6035\n\nMeeting Date/Time: See EPD Police Sector page for current schedule.\n\nLocation: Crime Prevention Office, CK Newsome Center, 100 E Walnut St., Suite 100, Evansville, IN 47713\n\nBoundaries & Map\n\nPerimeter: 2.47 miles\n\nArea: 236.8 acres"
