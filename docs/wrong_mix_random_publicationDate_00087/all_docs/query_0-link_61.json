Trust us. We asked. She panicked and briefly exploded into a cloud of bats. We didn't ask again.\n\nSomehow, this isn't even Ryan's entire list. There are a few books that were out of stock at the time of this photo, and a few others that don't even come out until next year, so if you'd like to browse her full list, you can do that on our website: https://www.gibsonsbookstore.com/ryan-favorites-2023 (or click the link in our bio)\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#ShopLocal #IndieBookstore #Books #Bookstagram #Bookstagrammer #BooksOfInstagram #BookAddict #Bibliophile #Booknerd #Bookaholic #BookLover #Instabook #Reading\".",
