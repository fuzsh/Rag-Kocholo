Happy days are here again with Richie, Potsie, Ralph Malph and the unforgettable “king of cool,” Arthur “The Fonz” Fonzarelli. Based on the hit Paramount Pictures television series, Happy Days, A New Musical reintroduces one of America’s best loved families, the Cunninghams – yes, Howard, Marion and Joanie are here, too – to a whole new generation of kids and parents.\n\nThe famed drive-in malt shop and number-one hangout, Arnold’s, is in danger of demolition. So the gang teams up to save it with a dance contest and a TV-worthy wrestling match. Even Pinky Tuscadero, Fonzie's childhood sweetheart, returns to help and – lo and behold! – they rekindle their old flame.\n\nHappy Days, A New Musical, with amazing music from Oscar-winner Paul Williams and a book by the TV series original creator Garry Marshall, is perfect for regional theatres. High schools can also perform the show with any number of cast members they wish. This show is so versatile it can be done with a full orchestra or just a piano! Return to the days of 1959 Milwaukee, complete with varsity sweaters, hula hoops and jukebox sock-hoppin’ fun. This perfectly family-friendly musical will have you rockin’ and rollin’ all week long!"
