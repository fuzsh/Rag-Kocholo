        "text": "I brought 3 kids in 6 and under , 2 got shots but 1 didn’t. The lady at the desk , Diane told my 4 yr old that she doesn’t get to pick a toy from the box because she didn’t get a shot . However my daughter did get a shot a few monShow moreths ago and they didn’t give her anything and she told them that. So I got to drive home with 3 crying kids because someone couldn’t just be nice and give my daughter a dumb cheap toy.
