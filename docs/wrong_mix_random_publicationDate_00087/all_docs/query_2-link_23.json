        "text": "A couple of years ago, I was sitting in a friend’s car and saw a homeless man dragging around a pink sleeping bag in the rain as he ran to take cover in a bus shelter. I thought there must be something I could do to help. I went home and started doing some research. I then designed a parka-style coat that can be transformed into a sleeping bag that is both waterproof and insulated. I wanted the homeless to have something that looks nice as being practical at the same time. I realised that this coat can be used for many other outdoor activities such as fishing, hiking, the Duke of Edinburgh award, camping, and festivals. So, this is where you come in… For every two coats purchased, we promise to give one to the homeless free of charge. By buying our coats, you will be helping to cover the manufacturing cost so that you can help a person who is homeless stay warm and dry. No More Cold Nights works closely with local councils and homeless charities to make sure they reach the right person. #homelessness #twosoldonegiven #caring #charity #loveoneanother #support #protection #nomorecoldnights\n\nThe shocking case of Sheila Seleoane. Some more thoughts. I’m saying many Housing Associations have lost their way. Obsession with bigger is better, building new homes, shutting local offices moving to remote working. Many Boards are far too remote and removed from the tenants they should be serving. Being paid creates an aura of aloof professionalism. CE’s and executives are often focused on the next merger and how big their salaries can be. This dislike of localised, old school housing management is irrational. Local offices and patch management isn’t any more expensive. Are we frightened of actually being face to face with our tenants? And the big one, WORKING FROM HOME! Why’s that even possible with housing staff. Too many CE’s and senior staff set the example by working from home. If you want to avoid future cases like Sheila then staff need to be out there talking to their tenants, visiting them, sorting their repairs, gaining their trust and respect. I remember a case with Mary Larbie. Tenant hadn’t paid rent for ages. Mary spent weeks knocking on the door, writing letters, building trust. They eventually let us in and we worked with them to get backdated HB. They were completely house bound. Very severe mental health issues. But we were able to resolve many of their problems. It was painstaking work. So many cases like that. None could have been sorted by a remote call Center 300 miles away or by a housing officer working from home."
