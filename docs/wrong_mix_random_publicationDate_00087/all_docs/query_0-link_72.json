She is my special guest tonight, and yes we recorded âKnock Three Timesâ together in a duet! What a fun time we had making that record, and I have to say it was not only fun, but an honor! Because DEBBIE GIBSON is trail blazer for women in the recording industry! Debbie is also a singer-songwriter, and record producer who produced her own hits! But this enormous talent with all of her hit records and albums, has alsoÂ starred on BROADWAY as an accomplished actress, performing in monster hit shows like: LES MISÃRABLES, BEAUTY & THE BEAST, and GREASE! Debbie,Â between that and her amazing film career and hosting television award showsâ¦ blew people away on âDancing With The Starsâ and is now enjoying her third year as host of her own radio show âDebbie Gibsonâs Mixtapeâ on SIRIUS XM Radioâ¦ now in its 3rd year!Â Saturday nightÂ we are proud to debut her new hit Christmas single âChristmas Starââ¦.bound to become a Christmas Classic!\n\nSo join DEBBIE GIBSON and myself right here,\n\nSaturday nightÂ on Music Radio 77 WABC!\n\n10pm-MidnightÂ EST\n\n9pm-11pm CST\n\n7pm-9pm PST"
