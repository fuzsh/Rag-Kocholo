        "text": "Victoria Clark returns to her Tony-nominated role as Marie, the Fairy Godmother, on 21 Jan 2014 in the Broadway premiere of Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella. Clark assumes the role from Rebecca Luker who played her final performance on 19 Jan 2014.\n\nThis is the first of five principal cast changes for the musical:\n\nAs previously announced, Joe Carroll will begin performances as 'Prince Topher' from 28 Jan 2014, taking over the role from original cast member and Tony Award nominee Santino Fontana\n\nCanadianian pop star Carly Rae who will make her Broaday debut from 04 Feb - 27 Apr 2014 when she assumes the title role of Cinderella from Tony Award-nominated original cast member Laura Osnes.\n\nFran Drescher will also make her Broadwy debut on the 04 Feb 2014, assumming the role of 'Madame' from original cast member Harriet Harris.\n\nTodd Buonopane will replace original cast member Greg Hildreth as the rebel 'Jean-Michel,' on 28 Jan 2014.\n\nFinally, Cinderella ensemble member Stephanie Gibson will replace original cast member Marla Mindelle as stepsister 'Gabrielle,' also on 28 Jan 2014.\n\nThe Broadway premiere of Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella has announced further cast changes in the coming weeks.\n\nCinderella opened at the Broadway Theatre on 03 Mar 2013, following previews from 25 Jan 2013, and is currently booking through to 29 Jun 2014.\n\nThe musical opened to mixed, but mostly excellent reviews: Glittery patchwork of a show (NY Times); Crowd-pleasing family entertainment (Hollywood Reporter); A solid and congenial framework for Rodgers and Hammerstein's wonderful songs (Record).\n\nDirected by Mark Brokaw and choreographed by Josh Rhodes, the production's principal cast currently stars Laura Osnes (Cinderella), Santino Fontana (Prince Topher), Victoria Clark (Marie), Harriet Harris (Madame), Ann Harada (Charlotte), Marla Mindelle (Gabrielle), Peter Bartlett (Sebastian), Greg Hildreth (Jean-Michel) and Phumzile Sojola (Lord Pinkleton).\n\nCinderella features music by Richard Rodgers and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II, with a new book by Douglas Carter Beane adapted from the original book by Oscar Hammerstein II.\n\nDouglas Carter Beane's new book for Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella re-charts the journey of the tale's maid-turned-princess: with pumpkin, glass slippers, fairy godmother and other classic story elements intact, it is now Cinderella's turn to rescue the Prince.\n\nIn addition to musical numbers from the original score, including 'In My Own Little Corner,' 'Impossible/It's Possible,' 'Ten Minutes Ago' and 'Do I Love You Because You're Beautiful?,' this new production will include several songs from the Rodgers & Hammerstein trunk.\n\nThe creative team features scenic design by Anna Louizos, costume design by William Ivey Long, lighting design by Ken Posner and sound design by Nevin Steinberg.\n\nOne of Rodgers & Hammerstein's most popular titles, Cinderella - which was written for television and debuted in 1957 starring Julie Andrews - has never been performed on Broadway, although stage adaptations have been performed worldwide since 1958.\n\nThe musical is being produced on Broadway by Robyn Goodman and Aged in Wood Productions.\n\nVictoria Clark as the Fairy Godmother"
