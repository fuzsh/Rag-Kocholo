        "text": "Dear Bardian,\n\nI just returned from my 'hols' in Lewes in Sussex on the south coast of England. It's a lovely old market town that was once home to Virginia Woolf and was where Thomas Paine expounded his revolutionary politics (so says the sign on the wall of the White Heart Hotel). It was still filled with school kids in uniforms eating chips on the high street when I was there—UK schools don't break up until the end of July! Here in the HV, summer is in full swing: peaches, blueberries, pie contests, yard sales, flea markets and of course Bard's own SummerScape. We have two more performances of the highly-acclaimed Henri VIII opera and the 33rd Bard Music Festival is just about to start. There are plenty of late nights at the Spiegeltent to come—including this Saturday night with Lola Kirke '12.\n\nFor the last 2 weeks the campus has been busy with the OEI summer program, which brings together all the Posse students, ECO scholars, BOP, and HEOP students to get to know the campus and each other. One of the goals of OEI is to connect current students with alumni/ae who were part of these programs in the past - if you would like to help we would love to hear from you.\n\nThe rest of the Class of 2027 will arrive on August 11th. Their schedule is already jam-packed: SMOG shows, drag shows, bingo, trivia, scavenger hunts, Target trips plus Antigone and Frankenstein. (My son is finally going to be a Bardian—he's beginning in Berlin at Bard College Berlin.)\n\nAffinity groups have been meeting all summer and will continue to gather steam—upcoming meetings are Bardians in Food and Bardians in Tech, email us if you want to know more.\n\nThank you to everyone who supported us at the end of year. We just finished packing up all the Bard swag so it's on its way to you. If you missed the swag, there's a new L&T themed special offer coming up—stay tuned.\n\nShout out to MFA alumnus Todd Haynes for being one of the first to use Barbie dolls as actors in his groundbreaking (and banned) film Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story. Filmed on campus in the summer of 1985 he built a perfect 1970's California ranch house, complete with a sunken living room, chrome arc floor lamp and a grand piano. Haynes recalled he bought the materials at the now sadly closed A.L Stickle in Rhinebeck. I'm working on a Bardie doll and looking for suggestions on accessories they would need?\n\nThe newest alum to come back to work at Bard is Jack Smith ’16, who has been named the Head Men’s and Women’s Squash Coach for the Bard College Raptors. Jack would love to hear from any squash alumni/ae out there who want to get involved.\n\nI think that's it from me. Hope you have a great summer. Save the date for Family and Alumni/ae Weekend: October 27-29, 2023. And all classes ending in 4s and 9s (that's me) save the date for Alumni/ae Reunion Weekend: May 24-26, 2024. We will be reaching out soon.\n\nBe seeing you,\n\nJane Brien '89\n\nP.S. Highlights of Bard news below, sign up for the weekly newsletter \"What's New at Bard'\" and follow us on social.\n\nP.P.S. If you are in NYC this summer and fancy some theater, thanks to an anonymous alum, all Bardians can have complimentary tickets to The Saviour by Deirdre Kinahan, starring Marie Mullen (The Music Man, Broadway; The Beauty Queen of Leenane, Druid, for which she won a Tony Award) and Jamie O’Neill! Please fill out this form for tickets."
