        "text": "V-Patch is designed to catch all targeted events, even if the patient is asymptomatic. It is estimated that 60% of events or more occur without symptoms. Event monitors that require patients to manually activate their monitors when symptoms are experienced will fail to record these events. The V-Patch is as efficient in design as it is in function. The sensor is small and discretely worn. The patches are hypoallergenic and waterproof. Patches are adhesive enough to attach well to patients and worn for seven days without changing, but not be painful to remove. The V-Patch is less obtrusive than other devices while providing better signals, reduced artefact and greater patient compliance.\n\nView Top Employees from V-Patch Medical Systems Limited"
