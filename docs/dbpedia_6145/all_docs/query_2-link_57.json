        "text": "I'm actually working on a huge Europe/Middle East/North Africa Map especially for PAE!\n\nView attachment 516541\n\nFeel free looking forward to it... probably out together with the upcoming, brand new PAE VI\n\nHave a further look at civforum.de if you want (I'm not allowed to post the link here cuz they say it's spam ;o)\n\nHello, I've been following this, and I'm looking forward to playing it, though I have doubts about my computer getting very far with it. It's really too late to suggest this, but all maps seem to be based on mercator projections which give a false sense of size and scale, though they are the ones we are all familiar with. Although it would look odd, making a map to the real scale of countries might save a lot of space up in the north. My other observation is that Greece is too small in relation to Crete or vice versa. While Greece seems to be roughly to scale in relation to the rest of the Med, it seems too small for gameplay purposes. I don't suggest it at this late stage but if countries to the north were reduced in size, maybe the orientation changed a bit, it might be possible to make Greece a bit bigger. Just a theory.\n\nGood luck anyway. I know how time consuming it is to make one of these maps. I will definitely play it.\n\n@Antigenese2\n\nThx m8\n\nIt's time consuming but also a lot of fun!\n\nSo mercator did the basis for all those maps? Greets to him\n\nBut I was really desperate for a really new map in real size...\n\nThere are discussions about \"Greece is too small\" or \"Sardinia is too big compared to Sicily\"...\n\nBut I will build this up on a real scale!\n\nbest,\n\nbrettschmitt\n\np.s.: yeah it's probably quite late to do somethin in Civi4... but I really came back to it now...... Forget one unit per tile -> bull**it\n\nBy the way...\n\nThe Greek will expand enough... Believe me!\n\nFirst because there is only one Greek (no Athen, Sparta, and what not)\n\nAnd Second:\n\nI will fix the importance of regions by setting the Recources quite rare. So Greece will have plenty, while the regions in the North and elsewhere will only have very few.\n\nAnd together with a little bit of Iceage...\n\nIt will need testing but I'm hoping the best\n\nbest,\n\nbrettschmitt\n\nBy the way...\n\nThe Greek will expand enough...

I ask because I think it would be good to add another tribe to Britain. There is plenty of room there and the Britons have no-one to fight, which can make it a bit boring to play them."
