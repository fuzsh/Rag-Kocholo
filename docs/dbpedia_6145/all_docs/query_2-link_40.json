        "text": "In response to the many complications and complaints filed by patients, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued product recalls and sent warning letters to the manufacturer. In spite of these attempts, Atrium is still manufacturing dangerous hernia mesh products, so patients have turned to the legal system for help. If you are one of the many victims suffering from complications caused by an Atrium C-Qur™ hernia mesh product, you may be eligible to file a claim for your injuries. Contact us today to schedule a complimentary consultation with an experienced attorney.\n\nAtrium C-Qur™ Mesh Products\n\nAtrium’s original C-Qur™ mesh product was first approved by the FDA in 2006. Rather than going through the standard approval process, the product was fast-tracked via the FDA’s 510(k) process. This program allows products which are thought to be similar to those already approved and on the market to gain approval without the rigorous safety testing that is standard for new products.\n\nC-Qur™\n\nThis is Atrium’s original hernia mesh product. It was approved in 2006 and features polypropylene mesh with an Omega-3 fatty acid coating, which serves as a barrier to protect the surrounding tissues.\n\nC-Qur Edge™\n\nThe C-Qur Edge™ was approved in 2008 to repair intra-abdominal hernias.\n\nC-Qur V-Patch™\n\nThe V-Patch™ was designed to repair small hernias, including umbilical and epigastric hernias.\n\nC-Qur™ Tacshield\n\nApproved in 2015, the TacShield mesh is used to repair medium to large open ventral hernias (those occurring in the abdominal wall).\n\nC-Qur™ FX\n\nThe FX mesh was also approved in 2015, and lacks the protective Omega-3 fatty acid barrier. It is used in both open and laparoscopic hernia surgeries.\n\nC-Qur CentriFX™\n\nAlso approved in 2015, the CentriFX™ mesh is used in laparoscopic inguinal (groin) hernia repair surgery and features a see-through mesh design.\n\nC-Qur Mosaic™\n\nThe Mosaic also features the see-through mesh design and was approved in 2015. It is used in both open and laparoscopic hernia procedures.\n\nC-Qur™ Film\n\nThe Film mesh is used in both pelvic and abdominal procedures to reduce the occurrence and severity of adhesions.\n\nComplications with Atrium C-Qur™ Mesh\n\nMost patients accept that all surgeries carry some degree of risk, including swelling, bruising, and the possibility of infection. The Atrium C-Qur™ mesh products come with far more serious complications, however, some of which can be life altering. Complications that have been reported with Atrium C-Qur™ mesh include:\n\nSevere pain\n\nChronic infections\n\nFormation of scar tissue around the mesh\n\nDegradation of the Omega-3 fatty acid coating, which can cause the mesh to adhere to the tissues and organs\n\nBowel obstruction\n\nExcess bleeding\n\nFistulas, which are abnormal fusions of organs, tissues, or blood vessels\n\nFluid buildup at the hernia site, also known as seroma\n\nForeign body rejection\n\nMigration or shrinkage of the hernia mesh as it degrades over time\n\nSkin rashes\n\nIn addition to these complications, the chronic pain, inflammation, and infections patients often face can lead to even more problems. Many patients who have received a hernia mesh product later developed autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. These incurable conditions may require expensive medications and lifelong treatments to manage painful and debilitating symptoms. Patients have also reported neurological changes, sudden tooth loss, and liver problems.\n\nAtrium C-Qur™ Mesh Recalls\n\nIn August of 2009, the FDA issued a Class II recall of the C-Qur Edge™ mesh after humid conditions caused the coating to adhere to and rub off on the packaging. In 2013, the FDA issued another Class II recall of both the C-Qur V-Patch™ and the C-Qur Edge™. Again, these were due to the coating sticking to the packaging in humid conditions.\n\nIn 2012, the FDA sent Atrium Medical a warning letter regarding their failure to address the serious complaints filed by consumers regarding infections. Despite these measures, Atrium’s C-Qur™ mesh products are still on the market and being used to repair hernias.\n\nSchedule Your Complimentary Case Evaluation\n\nBecause the FDA and Atrium have failed to improve the safety of these products, injured patients have begun taking legal action. Countless claims have already been filed in the Atrium C-Qur™ hernia mesh lawsuit over severe complications and many cite the manufacturer’s failure to warn doctors and patients of the risks associated with these medical devices."
