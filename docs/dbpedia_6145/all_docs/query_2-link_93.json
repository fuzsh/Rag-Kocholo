        "text": "I'm torn...trying to decide if I should order a complete replacement quarter or if I should put patch panels into mine. I can see the benefit in keeping as much original metal in there as possible especially since it's a thicker gauge. But at the same time I like the idea of knowing it will all be new. I've had this car for 16 years and plan to NEVER sell it...so I want to make the right/best decisions while doing this resto.\n\nIf you vote to replace it entirely...what company makes the best replacement?\n\nThank you for any direction!\n\n[/URL][/IMG]\n\nWell,\n\nOur '78 was worse than that and I had never done patch panels OR quarters before. I was able to to do patches for all the rot and it turned out awesome. My paint/body guy that's painting the car asked if I wanted to do some side work for him lol. My point is, if that was mine I'd patch for sure. Looks like you need the trunk extension too.\n\nhaha if you were closer I would hire you! And yes I removed the trunk pan extensions and was planning on doing them and the rear replacement patch panel at the same time...but then I got to questioning my decision on doing patches. I'm just afraid if I don't take the entire quarter off there could be more ugly underneath...\n\nLol, I wish I was too. I think I'm a little off in the head, but I actually really enjoyed it. I understand your worry about whats underneath. In my case, I just cut metal out until it looked good behind it too. I hand fabricated some of the outer wheelhouse that was bad too. Once it was cut out I could shine a light up in there and check it out. I also used the por15 neutralizer and cleaner and sprayed it up in. After that sprayed primer up in there too. I am by no means and expert but that's what I did after a lot of reading about the subject. Maybe some other guys with more experience will chime in.\n\nClassic Industries offers a complete repro quarter-panel for 75-81 Camaros, but they've been out of stock for a while now. Even if you could scavenge one I'm not sure about how well (or horrible) they fit.\n\nLH: http://www.classicindustries.com/product/camaro/parts/153271.html\n\nRH: http://www.classicindustries.com/product/camaro/parts/153272.html\n\nHeck, there's even full quarters for '74s too! I'm amazed by the amount of stuff they've come out with in the past few months for these cars."
