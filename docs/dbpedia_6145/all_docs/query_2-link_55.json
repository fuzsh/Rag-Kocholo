        "text": "Defective hernia mesh products that are the subjects of lawsuits can be identified by their product number. If you have received a hernia mesh implant and suffered chronic pain or other medical complications, you can turn to your medical records to find which type and model of mesh you received. The following listing of hernia mesh product numbers will tell you if your implant is the subject of the hernia mesh lawsuits currently working their way through the court system.\n\n1. Hernia mesh implant companies, product lines, models, and products\n\n2. Atrium / Maquet / Getinge\n\n3. Bard / Davol\n\n4. Covidien / Medtronic\n\n5. Ethicon / Johnson & Johnson\n\n6. Gore\n\n1. Hernia mesh implant companies, product lines, models, and products\n\nThere are several medical device companies that manufacture hernia mesh products. These companies include:\n\nAtrium Medical Corp., a subsidiary of the Swedish multinational company Getinge Group and associated with the German company Maquet,\n\nC.R. Bard, or simply Bard, and its subsidiary Davol,\n\nCovidien, a subsidiary of Medtronic,\n\nEthicon, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, and\n\nW.L. Gore & Associates, or simply Gore.\n\nEach company produces hernia mesh products that it often arranges into product lines, each of which is a series of fundamentally similar implants. For example, many companies have designed a product line of hernia mesh implants that focuses on not adhering to tissues and organs behind the implant:\n\nAtrium’s C-Qur brand of hernia mesh implants is lined with Omega 3, a fatty acid that is designed to keep the implant from sticking to unwanted tissues and organs,\n\nEthicon’s Physiomesh brand of implants is composed of five layers of polypropylene, polydioxanone, and polyglecaprone-25 to prevent this from happening, and\n\nCovidien’s Symbotex hernia mesh implant is lined with collagen on the backside to prevent unwanted adhesion.\n\nEach product line can be broken down into different models, which focus on smaller details of each procedure. For example:\n\nAtrium’s ProLite Mesh Ultra model is thinner than the basic ProLite Mesh model, making it a better fit for laparoscopic procedures, and\n\nGore’s DualMesh Plus has antimicrobial preservatives that the basic DualMesh model does not have, making it useful for procedures or patients that carry a higher risk of infection.\n\nFinally, models can come in different sizes or even different shapes for certain hernia procedures. Each of these variations comes with its own product number. For example:\n\nAll of Bard’s Modified Kugel models that are circular shaped, have straps, and are 10 centimeters in diameter have the product number 0115810, and\n\nAll of the implants in Ethicon’s Proceed Mesh model that are shaped like a square with 15-centimeter sides have a product number of PCDM1.\n\nThe product number should not be confused with a model’s lot number. Lot numbers refer to particular batches of hernia mesh products that were manufactured and sent out from the factory. Every package of hernia mesh device in a model, or sometimes every single implant in the model, has its own unique lot number.\n\n2. Atrium / Maquet / Getinge\n\nAtrium is one of the major manufacturers of hernia mesh devices. However, its leading line of hernia mesh implants – the C-Qur product line – has been rife with problems and defects.\n\nIn an attempt to prevent the polypropylene in its hernia mesh implants from adhering to unwanted tissues and creating serious medical problems, Atrium lined the implants with Omega 3, a fatty acid found in fish oil. However, the Omega 3 created a host of other medical complications, including infections and allergic reactions. The Omega 3 lining also failed to keep the implant from adhering to unwanted muscles, tissues, and organs.\n\nAs a result, a huge portion of the C-Qur hernia mesh product line is currently subject to litigation:\n\nProduct Line Model Product Numbers C-Qur Centrix 31395 31396 31397 Edge 31233 31226 Mesh 31505 31506 31507 31543 31544 31526 31527 31528 31531 31533 31534 31538 31535 31536 31537 31540 31542 Mosaic 31105 31106 31107 31143 31144 31126 31128 31127 31131 31133 31134 31136 31135 31136 31137 31140 31142 Tacshield 31610 31626 31628 31644 31633 31636 31637 31638 3161 31612 V-Patch 31200 31201 31202\n\nAdditionally, the following models and product numbers have had numerous problems and caused patients to get hurt. They might be the subject of litigation in the future:\n\nProduct Line Model Product Numbers ProLite Mesh 1000303-00; 1000606-00; 1001212-00; 1000103-00; 1000104-00; 1000204-00; 1000306-00; 1000406-00; 1000407-00; 1001014-00; 1001218-00; 1010101-01; 1010202-01; 1010303-05; 1010404-05; 1000204-01; 1010204-02; 1010306-01; 1010306-02; 1010306-04; 1010306-05; 1010306-06; 1010405-01; 1010405-02 Ultra Mesh 30713; 30717; 30719; 30721; 30710; 30711; 30714; 30715; 30716; 30718; 30720; 30722; 30800; 30801; 30802; 30803; 30804; 30805; 30806; 30807; 30700; 30701; 30702; 30703; 30704; 30705; 30708; 30709 ProLoop Mesh 30900; 30901; 30902; 30903; 30908; 30909; 30910; 30911; 30920; 30921; 30922 30923\n\nSo many lawsuits have been filed against Atrium over its defective hernia mesh devices that courts have had to take action to streamline the compensation process. In December, 2016, they formed a multidistrict litigation, or an MDL, to consolidate all of the hernia mesh lawsuits against Atrium into one court for pretrial purposes.\n\nAs of May 15, 2019, there were 1,329 lawsuits consolidated in this MDL.\n\n3. Bard / Davol\n\nBard manufactures a considerable portion of the hernia mesh implants that have been used in the past years. Unlike other hernia mesh manufacturers, Bard does not use strict product lines for its products. Instead, Bard’s hernia mesh products use model names that indicate the style of the patch and the procedure it is designed to be used in.\n\nThe most problematic and defective of Bard’s hernia mesh products include:\n\nModel Product Numbers 3DMax 0115310 0115311 0115312 0115320 0115321 0115322 3DMax Light 0117310 0117311 0117312 0117320 0117321 0117322 Bard Mesh (sometimes referred to as “Marlex Mesh” or “Bard Flat Mesh”) 0112640 0112650 0112660 0112670 0112680 0112720 Bard Pre-Shaped Mesh (sometimes referred to as “Bard Keyhole Mesh”) 0112700 0112710 0113700 0113710 Composix 0113240 0113360 0113480 0113680 0113810 0113112 0113114 Composix E/X 0123113 0123114 0123460 0123680 0123790 0123810 Composix Kugel 0010201 0010205 0010202 0010203 0010204 0010208 0010209 0010206 0010207 Kugel 0010101 0010102 0010103 0010104 0010105 Modified Kugel Patch (or MK Patch) 0115808 0115810 0115812 0115814 0115816 Parastomal Patch 0118001 0118002 0118003 0118004 Perfix Light 0117050 0117060 0117070 0117080 0117150 0117150 0117160 0117170 0017180 Perfix Plug 0112750 0112760 0112770 0112780 0112950 0112960 0112970 0112980 Sepramesh IP Composite 5959124 5959360 5959480 5959680 5959812 Spermatex Ventralex 0010301 0010302 0010303 VentralexST 5950007 5950008 5950009 VentralightST 5954113 5954124 5954450 5954460 5954600 5954610 5954680 5954790 5954800 5954810 VentralightST with Echo 5955000 5955113 5955124 5955450 5955460 5955600 5955610 5955680 5955790 5955800 5955810 Ventrio 0010211 0010212 0010213 0010214 0010215 0010216 0010217 0010218 0010219 VentrioST 5950010 5950020 5950030 5950040 5950050 5950060 5950070 5950080 5950090 Visilex 0112900 0112910\n\nAdditionally, the following models of Bard’s hernia mesh products may become the subject of litigation in the near future:\n\nModel Product Numbers Composix L/P 0134450 0134460 0134680 0134610 0134790 0134810 0134113 0134114 Composix L/P with Echo 0144113 0144114 0144610 0144680 0144790 0144810 Curasoft 0116001 0116003 Dulex 0108121 0110151 0110152 0115191 0115192 0118241 0118242 0120301 0120302 0126341 0126342 0175101 OnFlex 0115410 0115411 Modified OnFlex 0115610 0115611 Polysoft 0130030 0130040 Ventrio Light\n\nBoth the prevalence and the designs of Bard’s hernia mesh devices have led to thousands of lawsuits against the company. The sheer volume of these legal claims for compensation has forced the court system to create an MDL for Bard. This MDL was created in the Southern District of Ohio, and contained 1,662 lawsuits on May 15, 2019.\n\n4. Covidien / Medtronic\n\nCovidien’s first hernia mesh product was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1999. Since then, the majority of Covidien’s hernia mesh implants – as well as most of the company’s sales for hernia mesh devices – have come from its Parietex and Parietene lines.\n\nHowever, those product lines, along with others made by Covidien, have hurt thousands of patients in the U.S. over the years. Lawsuits have been filed against Covidien for injuries caused by the following devices:\n\nProduct Line Model Product Numbers Parietene (Basic model) PPM2020 PPM3030 PPM4530 PP1510T PP1510X3 PP1515 PP2020 PP3030 PP0611T PPL0611X3 PPL151X3 PPL1515 PPL2020 PPL3030 PPL3032 Composite PPC12 PPC1510 PPC1515 PPC2015 PPC2520 PPC3020 Macroporus PPM1106X3 PPM1508X3 PPM1510X3 PPM1515X3 PPM1106X3 PPM1508X3 Progrip PP1208DL PP1208DR PP1509G Parietex (Basic model) TECT1510AL TECT1510AR TECT1510ADPL TECT1510ADPR TECT1510ADP2L TECT1510ADP2R TECT1612AL TECT1612AR TECT1612AFL TECT1612AFR TEC1309 TEC1410P5 TEC1410DP TEC1510 TEC1515 TEC2020 TEC3030 TECR1510 TECR1515 TET1309 TET1309D TET1510 TET1515 TET2020 TET3030 TET5050 Composite PCO9 PCO12 PCO15 PCO20 PCO1510 PCO2015 PCO2520 PCO3020 PCO3728 PCO9FX PCO12FX PCO15FX PCO20FX PCO1510FX PCO2015FX PCO2520FX PCO3020FX PCO3728FX AMPPCO15X AMPPCO20X AMPPCO2015X PCO9F PCO12F PCO15F PCO20F PCO1510F PCO2015F PCO2520F PCO3020F PCO3728F Composite Open Skirt PCO8OS PCO1510OS PCO2015OS PCO2520OS PCO3020OS PCO8OSX PCO1510OSX PCO2015OSX PCO2520OSX PCO3020OSX Composite Parastomal PCOPM15 PCOPM20 PCOPM15H35 PCO15H50 Composite Hiatal PCO2H1 PCO2H3 PCO2H4 Composite Ventral Patch PCO4VP PCO6VP PCO8VP Easegrip TET1208DL TET1208DR TET1409DL TET1409DR Lightweight TCM1106x3 TCM1510x3 TCM1515x3 TCM2020 TCM4530 TCM3030 TCM1106 TCM1510 TCM1515 Plug &amp Patch PNP6x3 PNP8x3 TECRT6 TECRT8 Progrip TEM1208GL TEM1208GR TEM1409GL TEM1409GR TEM1509G TEM1515G LPG150 LPG1510AR LPG1510AL LPG1510X2 LPG1510AK2 LPG1612 LPG1612AR LPG1612AL TEM2015G TEM3015G Surgipro (Basic model) SPMM14 SPMM35 SPMM46 SPMM66 SPMM149 SPM14 SPM35 SPM149 SPM14W SPM35W SPM66W SPM149W SMHP01 SMHP02 Plug &amp Patch SMPL01 SMPM02 Symbotex (Basic model) SYM4024E SYM3204E SYM2515E SYM2012E SYM1710E SYM4232 SYM3728 SYM3020 SYM2520 SYM2015 SYM1510 SYM15 SYM12 SYM9 SYM3020OS SYM2520OS SYM2015OS SYM1510OS SYM20 SYM8OS\n\nHundreds of people have been hurt by Covidien’s hernia mesh implants. However, not enough lawsuits have been filed to create an MDL against Covidien. Instead, claims for compensation have been filed individually across the country.\n\n5. Ethicon / Johnson & Johnson\n\nEthicon is another large manufacturer of hernia mesh products. Just like other companies, though, its hernia mesh designs have been prone to failure and can cause patients to suffer chronic pain or other medical complications:\n\nProduct Line Model Product Numbers Physiomesh (Basic model) PHY0715R PHY1015V PHY1515Q PHY1520R PHY1520V PHY2025V PHY2030R PHY2535V PHY3035R PHY3050R Proceed Mesh PCDB1 PCDD1 PCDG1 PCDH1 PCDJ1 PCDL1 PCDM1 PCDN1 PCDR1 PCDT1 PCDW1 Ventral Patch PVPS PVPM Prolene 3D Patch 3DPM 3DPL P3DPM P3DPL Hernia System PHSM PSHM6 PHSL PHSL6 PHSE PHSE6\n\nAdditionally, some other Ethicon hernia mesh products could be the subject of lawsuits in the future:\n\nProduct Line Model Product Numbers Ultrapro (Basic model) UMS3 UMR3 UMM3 UML1 Advanced UPA3612 UPA37615 UPA31015 UPA31515 UPA1530 UPA3030 Plug UPPS2 UPPS6 UPPM2 UPPM6 UPPL2 UPPL6 Comfort Plug UPLUG401 UPLUG403 UPLUG406 UPLUG551 UPLUG553 UPLUG556 Hernia System UHSL UHSL6 UHSM UHSM6 UHSOV\n\nOne of Ethicon’s most popular product lines, the Physiomesh, has proven especially prone to failure. On June 2, 2017, the court system created an entire multidistrict litigation for lawsuits against Ethicon for injuries caused by the Physiomesh line of products. Since the creation of the MDL, it has been expanded to include other Ethicon hernia implants, as well.\n\nThe MDL is being heard by the Northern District of Georgia. On May 15, 2019, it had 2,017 lawsuits in it.\n\n6. Gore\n\nGore’s hernia mesh products were first approved by the FDA in 1995. They are made of Gore-Tex, a trademarked chemical composition of ePTFE.\n\nAs surgeons became aware that Gore-Tex hernia mesh implants had a tendency to cause an infection, they have moved to other devices. Nevertheless, many of Gore’s hernia mesh implants continue to be used, and many of the people who have had a hernia repair procedure during Gore’s more popular days can still have the implant inside of them.\n\nProduct Line Model Product Numbers DualMesh (Basic model) 1DLMC02 1DLMC03 1DLMC04 1DLMC05 1DLMC06 1DLMC07 1DLMC08 1DLMC09 1DLMC200 1DLMC201 1DLMC202 1DLMC203 1DLMC204 Plus 1DLMCP02 1DLMCP03 1DLMCP04 1DLMCP05 1DLMCP06 1DLMCP07 1DLMCP08 1DLMCP200 1DLMCP201 1DLMCP202 1DLMCP203 1DLMCP204 1DLMCPH02 1DLMCPH03 1DLMCPH04 1DLMCPH06 1DLMCPH07 1DLMCPH08\n\nWhile lawsuits against Gore for injuries caused by its hernia mesh products are not common enough to warrant a multidistrict litigation, that does not mean that victims cannot file a lawsuit and recover the compensation they need. It just means that the lawsuit would proceed on an individual basis, and would not get consolidated with other similar claims against Gore.\n\nLegal References:"
