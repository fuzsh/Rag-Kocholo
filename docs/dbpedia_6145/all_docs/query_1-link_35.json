        "text": "In my 10+ years as a Product Manager, I have seen the role evolve quite dramatically. In this post, I explore the trends and explain what we look for in PM candidates.\n\nIn my formative years as a Product Manager, I was lucky to be with McAfee in its heydays. The McAfee culture was primarily sales-driven. We had 50-odd PMs and everyone signed up to support their products' quota. This meant that PMs were extremely motivated to beat their quota, as their bonuses (paid quarterly) were tied to the sales numbers. PMs were also very influential in the sense that we could make changes to pricing, packaging or start discussions with CorpDev regarding acquisitions. In fact, I played the lead role in the Sentrigo acquisition by writing the business plan, whitelabeling their product and defining the go-to-market strategy. The partnership was so successful that we acquired Sentrigo within 6 months of the first whitelabel-ed offering through McAfee. Marketing was often consulted, but played what I consider a supporting role to the 'CEO of the product'. PMs also worked with Engineering to build the product, but this would take just 10-20% of our time because of the lengthy dev cycles (6 month releases)\n\nI started with this example, because many experienced candidates highlight their business skills when interviewing for a role in Cylance. But, we like to hire PMs who love building products and prefer those who have strong engineering/product backgrounds. Due to our monthly release cycles, PMs at Cylance spend the majority of their time working with UX team features for the next 2-3 sprints, getting feedback from key stakeholders on the designs, grooming the features with the dev team, attending daily standups to track progress, testing the designs that were just implemented and training the sales/support/consulting teams on features that are about to be released. Yes, we work with all the key functions, but we just don't have the time to lead pricing, packaging or other marketing discussions. The good news is that we have an extremely strong marketing team which drives these decisions in consultation with PM.\n\nAnother significant change is the way we approach features/enhancement requests. At McAfee and other large enterprise companies, most products had a small number of accounts (a few hundreds). PMs spent considerable time and energy developing strong relationships by visiting the accounts often and pressing flesh. Product feedback would be solicited in these meetings and customer advisory councils dominated by our largest accounts. This approach, unfortunately doesn't scale, when you signup hundreds of large customers every quarter. We prefer a more democratic community driven approach to the curation/selection of feature requests. Customers post their enhancement requests in a community and we are able to track the popularity of ideas based on votes/comments from other customers. We still meet customers, but in focus groups, to get inputs about the feature they are passionate about. These customers are also the first ones to try out new features. Our customer advisory council provides guidance on long-term strategy and not short-term features.\n\nReleasing new features is also dramatically different. At McAfee, engineering would crank away for 6 months and deliver a feature which was declared generally available. We had an early adopter/joint development program to refine the feature as it was being developed, but it took a lot of effort to get the desired result. Frequently, the first release of the feature would be a dud and customers had to be persuaded to try the feature again after every subsequent release (6 months or more apart). By contrast, at Cylance, we define an MVP (minimum viable product) and open it up to only customers in the focus group and other customers who are really interested in the feature. We are able to do so using a 'Feature Manager', which lets us turn on features for just this select group without making it available to all customers. This group of customers may take 1-3 months to test and provide feedback, during which time we fix the bugs as soon as they are reported. Once we are satisfied with the quality of the release, we flip a switch in the database, which makes the feature available to all customers. By now, we are very confident about its success, because of the close collaboration with our focus group.\n\nDelivering the product as a service has other advantages as well. We have a lot of cross-tenant metrics available to make product decisions. Want to drop a button/action in a page? We know how frequently it is being used and wouldn't consider moving anything that is used frequently. On the other hand, we are willing to drop stuff that are of marginal value and this keeps the console from resembling that of a 747 cockpit. This leads to a much more data-driven decision making process than was possible before.\n\nSo, when you apply for a Product Management position, please talk about experiences where you built a great product by channeling the voice of the customer, making data-driven decisions and iterating rapidly with engineering. Starting the conversation by talking about your MBA, deep insights into pricing or media training will mean that you have failed your first test as a PM - understanding your customer."
