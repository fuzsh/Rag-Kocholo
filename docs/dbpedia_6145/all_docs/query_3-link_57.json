        "text": "Sentrigo offers database security technologies, including vulnerability management, database activity monitoring, database audit, and virtual patching.\n\nSentrigo, which was part of McAfee’s Security Innovation Alliance program, has an OEM relationship with McAfee to offer Sentrigo’s database security products under the McAfee brand name. With this acquisition, McAfee also plans to integrate Sentrigo’s database security products into McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator software.\n\nThe acquisition enables McAfee to extend its portfolio in the database security market, estimated to reach more than $600 million by 2012.\n\nThe addition of Sentrigo’s database security solutions to the McAfee security portfolio comes at a time when regulatory pressure and the volume of database breaches are increasing.\n\n“The regular stream of public breach announcements is evidence that we must all do much more to protect mission-critical database environments, and Sentrigo has been working for more than four years to develop a suite of products to best secure these assets”, said Nathan Shuchami, CEO of Sentrigo. “As part of McAfee, Sentrigo will be in a position to deliver these best-of-breed solutions to address a much broader range of customer’s database security and compliance challenges”, he added.\n\nFollowing the closing of the proposed acquisition, expected in April, the Sentrigo team will report to the McAfee Risk & Compliance business unit, headed by Stuart McClure, senior vice president and general manager."
