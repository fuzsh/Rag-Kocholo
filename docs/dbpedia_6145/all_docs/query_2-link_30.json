        "text": "Hernia mesh, a flexible composite mesh, is used to repair hernias in both the stomach and groin areas. Such hernias occur when a small portion of the intestine bulges through an opening in the muscles of the abdominal wall, and are typically caused by age, genetic factors, or heavy exertion. Hernias can occur at any time. Fixing a hernia generally requires a minimally invasive surgery to repair the broken abdominal wall; mesh products are placed beneath the abdominal wall to prevent the hernia from recurring after the surgery is completed."
