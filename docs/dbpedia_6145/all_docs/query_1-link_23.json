        "text": "Repscan security scanning solution expands support to include cloud-based, open source platforms.\n\nNote: ESJ’s editors carefully choose vendor-issued press releases about new or upgraded products and services. We have edited and/or condensed this release to highlight key features but make no claims as to the accuracy of the vendor's statements.\n\nSentrigo, Inc. has updated its database vulnerability assessment and security scanning software solution, Repscan 4.0. The new release, now available with more flexible pricing options, offers expanded support for cloud-based and open source database platforms, productivity enhancements for database administrators (DBAs), and added management capabilities.\n\nAmong the new platforms supported by Repscan 4.0 is Microsoft SQL Azure Database, a cloud-based relational database service built on SQL Server technologies that provides a highly available, scalable, multi-tenant database service hosted by Microsoft in the cloud. Sentrigo’s support for the Microsoft SQL Azure platform further assists organizations by providing a more secure environment in which to leverage the benefits of cloud computing. The new version includes hundreds of tests designed for the SQL Azure environment and has been implemented to efficiently evaluate configuration parameters relevant for securing this emerging architecture.\n\nRepscan 4.0 also augments support for open source databases (including MySQL) with the addition of PostgreSQL, a widely-deployed open source object-relational database system.\n\nIn addition, Repscan 4.0 expands platform support by including capabilities for scanning of Sybase ASE systems, extending the breadth of platforms which already included Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and IBM DB2.\n\nAlso new in Repscan 4.0 are a number of new features to simplify and speed common actions of DBAs as they work to remediate discovered vulnerabilities. For example, DBAs with appropriate account access and privileges can apply changes to one or more databases directly from within Repscan, addressing identified problems without leaving the tool. The new version also provides direct Internet search capability, allowing users to quickly find additional detail and the latest information on vulnerabilities. Several new reports developed for management roles, including executive overview and summary-level reports, are also included in Repscan 4.0.\n\nPricing for Repscan 4.0 is now available on a pay-per-scan license as well as the previously available perpetual license, allowing organizations to get an initial assessment completed more cost-effectively for a single use or as the need for compliance audits dictate. More information is available at www.sentrigo.com/repscan."
