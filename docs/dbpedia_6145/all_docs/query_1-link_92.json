        "text": "IBM Security Guardium ★★★★☆\n\nBest Known For Securing databases effectively, easy downloads, powerful data classifications, easy deploy times\n\nLeast Known For Tricky navigation, difficult to debug due to enclosure, more on the pricey side\n\nManageEngine Data Security Plus ★★★☆☆\n\nBest Known For Ease of use, ensures data compliance, responsive support\n\nLeast Known For Not enough enhancements on risk assessments and file share auditing\n\nSophos Intercept X for Server ★★★★☆\n\nBest Known For Ease of use, features, support, and complete ransomware protection\n\nLeast Known For Limited User Interface, high pricing, complicated solutions for non-database driven antivirus/antispyware solutions\n\nManageEngine AD Audit Plus ★★★★☆\n\nBest Known For Good user experience and ease of use, capable audit features, good reporting\n\nLeast Known For Useless archiving model, difficult to install multiple products on the same server\n\nCommvault Data Protection Advanced ★★★☆☆\n\nBest Known For Ease of use, customer service, cheap and easy backup solutions, fast recovery\n\nLeast Known For Difficult to navigate, bugs on new versions, and expensive pricing\n\nIBM Spectrum Protect Entry Managed Server License ★★★☆☆\n\nBest Known For Good pricing, optimized data protection, and ease of use\n\nLeast Known For Only available for Windows\n\nGemalto SafeNet ProtectApp ★★★★☆\n\nBest Known For Easy management, compliance, high perforation, and encryption\n\nLeast Known For Being available only for Windows\n\nSentrigo Hedgehog ★★★★☆\n\nBest Known For Budget-friendly, unlimited software choices, ease of use\n\nLeast Known For: Doesn’t detect enough attacks, lacks profiling of databases\n\nIBM InfoSphere QualityStage ★★★☆☆\n\nBest Known For Different versions, customer service\n\nLeast Known For Issues with implementation and operation phases, questionable patches, slow deployment\n\nCommvault Data Protect Foundation ★★★★☆\n\nBest Known For Good with reports and audit trails, quick support timing, better duplication ratio, works well for smaller companies\n\nLeast Known For Pricing, outdated features such as Java console, complicated licensing\n\nExo5 ★★★★☆\n\nBest Known For RemoteKill feature, easy deployment, ability to track laptop fleet in real-time, ability to encrypt and lock compromised devices\n\nLeast Known For: Not good for large businesses\n\nGemalto SafeNet Tokenization ★★★★☆\n\nBest Known For Wide range of products supported by software, solid performance, ease of use, reasonable price\n\nLeast Known For Lack of various liabilities\n\nGeneral Data Security\n\nGeneral Data Security mainly secures data from customers, employees, and businesses. This information can be allowed access by administrators in charge of data security and can run tests for the security. As for security inspections, administrators can use general data security to improve databases along with backups of encrypted information that can prevent more data breaches and cyber-attacks.\n\nMobile Data Security\n\nIt’s similar to general data security, but with more security since it’s for mobile devices. The only difference with this type of data security is that it has more features in terms of authentication and communication. Obviously, when carrying around a smartphone, the first thing one would notice is two-factor verification and software updates. Mobile data security maintains mobile application management standards in order to protect it from malicious software that could compromise a mobile device.\n\nDatabase Security\n\nThis type of security is self-explanatory. Database security was designed to protect databases from security breaches and other types of malware. Companies will mainly use this from other parties from gaining access to their databases. After all, you want to ensure that all of our data is safe and doesn’t get into the hands of unauthorized users.\n\nData Loss Prevention (DLP)\n\nOr DLP, is a technology that secures any type of sensitive information, maintains backups, and ensures data compliance. Companies will use DLP as a form of a backup plan because it stores information in the sense that every single piece of data gets organized properly. Generally, DLP technology gives companies an idea of what to do when data gets lost.\n\nIdentity Management Software\n\nIdentity management software is a flexible tool that works in many ways. This type of software can help track the history and control the permission of users who are allowed to access critical information belonging to businesses. Say you sign up on a site and it tells you how strong of a password you need to create. That’s a perfect indication that identity management software does its job pretty well.\n\nEncryption\n\nEncryption is crucially part of data security because it masks data that can be only accessed and approved by users that can read the encryption. Examples of encryption include anonymous web browsing and securing communication.\n\nData Masking Software\n\nThough encryption can mask data, data masking software mainly does this for sensitive information in order to protect it from the public eye. Though there are techniques that can teach developers how to effectively mask data, data masking software shields from unintended exposure and reduces the chances of data getting breached."
