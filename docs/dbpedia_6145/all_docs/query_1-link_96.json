        "text": "Although I have yet to see a formal announcement from IBM, reports suggest that Big Blue is in the process of acquiring database-security vendor Guardium for approximately $225 million.\n\nFounded as Defendo in Israel in 2002, Guardium moved to the Boston area in 2003. It has been headquartered there ever since. Most of the company’s development apparently is done in the Boston suburb of Waltham, but some is done in Israel. The company was spun off as a subsidiary of Log-On, founded by Amnon Keinan and Lior Tal, who has since left the company. Keinan was formerly a vice president at Amdocs, according to a Haaretz report.\n\nAbout $21 million has been invested in the company since it was established. Investors include Ascent, Cedar Fund, StageOne Ventures and Veritas Venture Partners, as well as strategic investor Cisco Systems.\n\nGuadium’s flagship product is SQL-Guard, which provides database security assessment, access policy control and enforcement, as well as auditing and regulatory compliance. Guardium’s products provide secure access to enterprise data, including databases from IBM, Oracle, Microsoft and others.\n\nHaaretz notes that companies in the same space include Imperva and Sentrigo. Those two vendors, like Guardium, were launched in Israel, which has an exceptionally strong history in data-security technologies. Probably Israel’s best-known Internet-security company is Check Point Software, a firewall pioneer that has grown into an enterprise-security leader with an extensive portfolio of perimeter and endpoint products."
