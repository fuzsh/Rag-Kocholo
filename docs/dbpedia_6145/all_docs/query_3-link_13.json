        "text": "After a series of acquisitions in the database access security field, it was only a matter of time before prominent Israeli companies in the field would find themselves on the block. McAfee Inc., now a subsidiary of Intel Corporation (Nasdaq: INTC), today announced the acquisition of Sentrigo Inc., a developer of database activity monitoring (DAM) solutions. The companies did not disclose the size of the deal, but is reportedly $30-40 million.\n\nRELATED ARTICLES\n\nSentrigo was founded as Monolight in 2005 by CEO Nathan Shuchami and CTO Slavik Markovich. It changed its name a year later together with a change in business. The company's solution is designed to protect databases from hackers and unauthorized users at an enterprise, as well as monitoring regulatory compliance.\n\nMcAfee and Sentrigo work closely together. As a member of McAfee’s Security Innovation Alliance (SIA), Sentrigo's database technology and products are integrated with McAfee’s ePolicy Orchestrator platform in September 2010.\n\nSentrigo reportedly had sales of a few million dollars in 2010.\n\nAccording to Israel Venture Capital Association, Sentrigo has raised $18 million. Investors include Benchmark Capital, Ray Stata's Stata Venture Partners, and Juniper Networks Inc's (Nasdaq: JNPR) Junos Innovation Fund, and private investors.\n\nPublished by Globes [online], Israel business news - www.globes-online.com - on March 23, 2011"
