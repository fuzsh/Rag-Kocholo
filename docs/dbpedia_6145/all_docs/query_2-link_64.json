        "text": "Description\n\nAtrium 31202 C-qur V-Patch 8cm x 8cm, 3.2″ x 3.2″ Large\n\nPart # 31202 Exp 5/18, 11/17\n\nAtrium 31202 C-qur V-Patch is an Omega 3 fatty acid (O3FA) coated polypropylene device designed for the\n\nrepair of small hernias such as umbilical, epigastric and trocar site defects and other small abdominal wall defects.\n\nAtrium 31202 C-qur V-Patch combines ProLite polypropylene mesh with a tissue separating layer of Omega 3 fatty acid (O3FA). C-QUR V-Patch is constructed of2 layers (1 layer of C-QUR FX mesh and 1 layer of C-QUR mesh) that are sewn together around an O3FA coated mesh stabilizing ring.\n\n• Deployment system allows for implantation of the device through a small defect • Two extended mesh fixation straps for device positioning, suture fixation and handling outside of the abdominal wall\n\n• O3FA coating has been shown to minimize visceral tissue attachment to the mesh\n\n• Flexible and conformable\n\n• Stability ring aides in handling and stability\n\nIn Perfect sealed condition but but past expiration date. Not for human use in the US.\n\nExpiration dates have mostly to do with sterilization and not the integrity of the product. The manufacturers sterilize the products after they are packaged and it lasts so many years. The only products we caution customers about are ones that are absorbable or drug coated.\n\nThere is a $125 minimum order due to the cost of shipping. You can add items from different specialties it just needs to be $125 or more in order to complete the transaction."
