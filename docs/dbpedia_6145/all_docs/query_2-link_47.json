        "text": "The C-QUR™ Mesh (pronounced “secure”), manufactured and distributed by Atrium Medical Corporation until a 2015 injunction pursued by the FDA, is a hernia mesh that has been used in hernia repair and other surgeries since 2006.\n\nThe C-QUR is one of a number of hernia mesh products that have led to injuries and complications in individuals who have had the product surgically implanted.\n\nIf you have been injured due to the use of the C-QUR Mesh in your hernia repair surgery, you may be entitled to compensation for your injuries, including financial or economic loss, and for your pain and suffering.\n\nKen Stern and the attorneys of Stern Law, PLLC, represent injured patients and their families from across the United States in lawsuits and actions against the companies that manufacture and distribute faulty surgical meshes.

Schedule a free consultation now.\n\nStudies on C-QUR\n\nThere have been a number of studies that have raised questions and concerns about the use of the C-QUR Mesh in hernia repair procedures. One of the studies, which specifically looked at C-QUR meshes, was discontinued because of the adverse effects of using the product.\n\nThe Belgian study\n\nA study conducted in Belgium in 2012 was intended to examine the efficacy of different sizes of C-QUR V-Patch meshes for small umbilical or epigastric hernias. However, the study was terminated early because of an “unacceptably high rate” of infection due to the mesh.\n\nA subsequent study was begun to examine the incidence of mesh infections in ventral hernias repaired with the C-QUR V-Patch, but the results have not yet been reported.\n\nThe U.K. study\n\nAnother 2012 study done in the U.K. looked at the rate of infection and adhesions in lab rats for a variety of hernia mesh products, including C-QUR. Adhesions are fibrous bands that may form between tissue or between organs after surgery, similar to internal scar tissue, forming a connection where there should not be one.\n\nIn the study, seven different commercial meshes were implanted in 144 rats that had been contaminated (peritonitis-induced) in order to see how the meshes performed in a contaminated environment. Researchers looked at mesh infection, intra-abdominal abscess formation, formation of adhesions, incorporation, and shrinkage after 28 and 90 days.\n\nAccording to the study results, three of the meshes resulted in zero incidences of infection, one resulted in one incidence of infection, and three resulted in significant numbers of infection. For C-QUR, the incidence of infection in the study was 15 out of 16.\n\nOther studies\n\nA 2013 study conducted in Ankara, Turkey, by reviewing medical records of patients looked at outcomes for patients who had chronic mesh infections following hernia surgery.\n\nThe study did not specifically look at C-QUR meshes, but it was noted that polypropylene is still the most common material in meshes for hernia repairs, despite disadvantages, and despite recent developments. The study mentions that the large pore size and biocompatibility of the material result in the greatest tissues in-growth, and the mesh tends to lead to a large inflammatory reaction, resulting in excessive scar tissue.\n\nA case report was published in 2016 on the inflammatory reaction of a patient to the fish oil coating on a C-QUR mesh after hernia surgery. The patient developed a symptomatic foreign body granuloma reaction because of the omega-3/fish oil coating, and eventually the mesh had to be removed.\n\nLet Stern Law protect your rights after a hernia mesh injury\n\nIf you suspect that a faulty hernia mesh product is to blame for your injury or for a loved one’s death, Stern Law can help.
