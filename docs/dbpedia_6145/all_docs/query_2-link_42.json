        "text": "What Determines Cost?\n\nThe size and order quantity determine the price of your patch. We do not charge extra for multiple colors of thread and our prices are quoted with Velcro included. Subtract $0.30 for any patches without Velcro.\n\nWhat Does 100% Embroidered Mean?\n\n100% embroidery means that the entire surface of your patch will be stitched with colored thread. In our opinion, a twill background patch is inferior and we do not recommend that option.\n\nSample Approval\n\nOnce your artwork is final, we will create a free sample patch and email a digital photo for your approval. The majority of our patch designs are approved via email. We are happy to mail the actual physical patch sample to you for a sample charge of $25.00, which will take 1-2 weeks to arrive.\n\nArtwork Creation\n\nOur free artwork service applies to the designs that are placed into production.\n\nPatch Detail\n\nDepending on the size of your patch, we can actually accomplish very detailed replication of your artwork using embroidered thread. Small, intricate details will not stitch accurately and simpler is often better. Facial features and extremely small text are especially challenging. Cartoonish images stitch quite well and we do a great job with aircraft and weapons.\n\nRush Service\n\nRush production is not available, but let us know your deadline and we will do our best to make it happen.\n\nPatch Order Time\n\nYour reorders and our MAJCOM patches will ship about one week sooner than other patches.\n\nMinimum Order Quantity\n\nWe have a minimum order quantity of 50 patches, and you can reorder as few as 25 patches. The minimum quantity for our patches applies to each design. This is because each design requires a different digitized image that instructs the machine how to stitch your patch. We do offer discounts on the same patch design in different colors, such as a color patch and a companion desert or OCP patch.\n\nPatch Colors\n\nView Thread Chart - PDF\n\nNumber of Colors\n\nYour patch price includes 12 colors at no additional charge. We will use as many colors as needed to make you the best quality patch and we will not nickel and dime you for additional colors. Most companies charge an extra $0.15 per color for more than 7 colors.\n\n889 Compliance Forms FAQs\n\n889 Compliance Forms PDF"
