Non-Stop

Brian Aldiss

London: Faber and Faber, 1958. First Edition. Copy belonging to the author's British agent, E.J. Carnell in London, with their label on the front endpaper, reading "NON-STOP / by / Brian W. Aldiss / First American Rights" in manuscript manual type.

Considered by many to be Aldiss' finest work. The American edition, for which this copy was ostensibly the template, was retitled "Starship," with many textual revisions. An exceptional copy of the author's third book in terms of both condition and relevance to its publication history. In a custom red cloth slipcase.

A touch of rubbing to the jacket rear panel along with a small closed tear and a 1-inch tear (neatly repaired with cellotape at the verso). All told, Fine and unread in an about Near Fine dust jacket.

Anatomy of Wonder (1995) 3-4. Pringle 25.
