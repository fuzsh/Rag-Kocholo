While best-loved by sci-fi fans for his tales of generational starships (Non-Stop) and far-future earths (Hothouse), English author and Science Fiction Grand Master Brian Aldiss was a prolific and daring writer who ranged up and down the spectrum of speculative fiction incorporating everything from straight pulp adventure to sharp satire, classic tropes of time-travel, space opera, and post-apocalyptic survival, to wild forays into non-traditional narrative technique. A major figure of the UK’s science-fiction New Wave, Aldiss’s long career expanded beyond the borders of 1960s experimentalism to create works of lasting appeal and influence, producing over 80 books and hundreds of short stories.
