        "text": "Susan Cain’s Bittersweet grabs you by the heart and doesn’t let go. I’ve thought about the depth and beauty in Cain’s research and storytelling every day since I finished the book. I will always be grateful for how much Quiet and Bittersweet have helped me understand myself and how I engage with the world.\n\n– Brené Brown, Ph.D., author of the #1 New York Times bestseller Atlas of the Heart\n\nA decade ago, I found myself inside Quiet. With Bittersweet, Susan Cain has described and validated my existence once again! Her new book reaffirms that my constant, achy awareness of life’s brutiful is a way of being shared across the ages with artists, healers, and anyone who pays deep attention. I’ll place Bittersweet in the hands of all my feely, achy, beautiful friends.\n\n– Glennon Doyle, author of the #1 New York Times bestseller Untamed and founder and president of Together Rising\n\nThis is the rare book that doesn’t just open your eyes—it touches your heart and sings to your soul. Susan Cain gave a voice to introverts, and now she masterfully paints our heaviest emotions in a light that’s long overdue. Bittersweet is the perfect cure for toxic positivity and a sparkling ode to the beauty of the human condition.\n\n– Adam Grant, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Think Again\n\nBittersweet is astonishing: one of the most gracefully written, palpably human books I've read in years.\n\n– Daniel H. Pink, #1 New York Times bestselling author of DRIVE\n\nThis book is an absolute triumph: it's for anyone who has ever really lived, loved, or lost.\n\n– Greg McKeown, New York Times bestselling author of Effortless\n\nBittersweet is an incredibly uplifting book—transcendent even.\n\n– Writer’s Digest\n\nIn a profound new book set to be as influential as Quiet, Cain ... argues that recognising the value of the “bittersweet”—that is, learning to weather times of pain and loss is powerful and vital.\n\n– The Bookseller\n\nAn antidote for our uncertain times and a toolbox for using angst and yearning as a means of transforming pain into creativity, transcendence, and love.\n\n– Oprah Daily\n\nCain has written a gorgeous, compassionate, companionate book.\n\n—Toronto Star\n\nAn original and contrarian thinker, Susan Cain compellingly argues that the messier parts of life might indirectly lead us to the most rewarding parts of it.\n\n–Seattle Times\n\nBittersweet is a beautiful read in its entirety.\n\n–Maria Popova, The Marginalian\n\nSusan Cain finds what is undervalued, quiet, and precious. In Bittersweet she takes you to a room in your own heart full of treasures that you had forgotten about. This is a book to read, feel, and savor\n\n–Jonathan Haidt\n\nBittersweet...resists classification, hovering like a butterfly between poetic mysticism and social psychology, as it dips into philosophy and Buddhism in search of the correlation between beauty and sadness.”\n\n–Ian McFarlane, The Canberra Times"
