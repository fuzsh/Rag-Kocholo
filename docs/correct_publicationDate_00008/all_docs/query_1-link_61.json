        "text": "Brian W. Aldiss\n\nBrian W(ilson) Aldiss (1925 - ) British author of science fiction, short stories, and poems.\n\nBrian W. Aldiss is a prolific British author who has published criticism, essays, travelogues, short stories, and traditional novels, but who remains best known for his science fiction writing. Since the appearance of his first science fiction novel, Non-Stop, in 1958, Aldiss has garnered virtually every major award in the field, including a Hugo Award for Hothouse, a Nebula Award for The Saliva Tree, a John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Helliconia Spring, and a James Blish Award for excellence in science fiction criticism, and in 1999 he was awarded the title of Grand Master of Science Fiction.\n\nAldiss was born in 1925 in East Dereham, Norfolk, England. He was drafted into the British Army to serve in India, Burma, and Indonesia during World War II. After being discharged, he married, had two children, and worked in a bookstore in Oxford. This employment allowed him to continue his education on his own, and gave him time to write. He has been a professional writer since his first book, The Brightfount Diaries, was published in 1955 and has been writing ever since. He has also edited numerous collections of science fiction stories.\n\nWorks by Brian W.
