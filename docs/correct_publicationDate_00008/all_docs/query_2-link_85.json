        "text": "The Boise Airport is going places. Well, OK, the airport is staying put – but travelers are going places. And the airport’s administration hopes fliers will have even more places to go.\n\nThe airport currently offers flights to 26 destinations on a non-stop basis – a figure that has grown in the years since the COVID-19 pandemic began to impact Idaho. But Airport Director Rebecca Hupp said they want to add even more.\n\nHupp outlined what she called “predictions and opportunities” for new routes to a session of the Boise Metro Chamber’s annual Leadership Conference in Sun Valley Tuesday.\n\nThe airport’s “Market Analysis for Potential New Routes” shows more than a dozen possible routes grouped into three timeframes: short-term (one to three years), medium term (four to six years) and long term (seven years or longer).\n\nComing soon?\n\nHigh on the list for hoped-for new flights are areas that a lot of people travel to from Boise: Orlando, Florida and the Washington, DC area. Hupp said both destinations are in the top 25 most-traveled to locations, even though you have to connect to get there.\n\n“Washington, DC is one of the largest unserved markets,” she said.\n\nThe airport hopes it could see a flight to one of the airports in the area around the nation’s capital, including Baltimore, Dulles or Reagan National. Airlines could include Southwest, American or United – all of which currently operate in Boise today.\n\nOrlando, home to Walt Disney World, Universal Studios and other attractions, would likely be served by Alaska Airlines, Spirit or industry upstart Breeze Airways. Breeze doesn’t currently serve Boise, but airport officials have been trying to land the carrier for several years.\n\nOther short-term routes on the wish list include:\n\nNashville, Tennessee, which has become a top destination for SouthWest Airlines.\n\nJohn Wayne Airport in Orange County, California on Alaska. Currently, Alegiant Airlines flies from Boise to Orange County a few times per week. The airport hopes to attract a mainline carrier like Alaska.\n\nPuerto Vallarta, Mexico. Right now, you can’t fly a mainline airline to any international destinations direct from Boise. But, the airport does have customs facilities for charter flights. The airport serves Mexico’s west coast and a popular tourist area. BOI hopes Allegiant might offer this service.\n\nMedium term\n\nBoise Airport officials hope to get travelers back to the Big Apple.\n\nJetBlue very briefly offered direct service from Boise to New York City’s JFK Airport, but cut the route as part of an overall trimming of operations, as BoiseDev reported last year.\n\nBut, Boise holds out hope for that connection to come back in the four to six-year timeframe. Targeted airlines include Alaska, JetBlue and United.\n\nFrom the city known for its nightlife to the state known for its beaches – Hawaii is another airline on BOI’s radar.\n\n“We think Honolulu is a possibility,” Hupp said. “There is demand from Boise, and people don’t want to necessarily connect. We think Alaska, Breeze and Hawaiian are all candidates for that.”\n\nUnlike some destinations, which bring people from other areas to Boise, Hupp noted that destinations like Honolulu generally take vactioners to and from their vacations, instead of business travelers and the like.\n\n“We aspire to (add Hawaii), but most of the people will be going from Boise to Hawaii,” she said. “(That route) is about people getting to go where they need to travel and not bring people in here. We want to prioritize places that bring economic impact.”\n\nHawaii service could come from Alaska, Breeze or Hawiian Airlines, according to the analysis.\n\nHupp also has Charlotte on her wish list. In 2021, the Boise City Council approved an updated incentive program that gives cash to carriers if they add sought-after destinations.\n\nShe said she hopes to go back to the city council to add additional destinations, including Charlotte and the DC metroplex.\n\nThe North Carolina airport is a major hub for American Airlines, and service from Boise to Charlotte would open additional options along the east coast. A flight from Boise to Atlanta on Delta has proved popular, Hupp said.\n\nShe said incentives can be just a small bit of help. She said it’s not even the icing on the cake but “maybe the sprinkles.”\n\n“It wasn’t the million dollars that (makes an airline) come here, it was the market that made them come here,” she said. ” “It might not make the difference but it might give us a bit of an edge if we are competing with Spokane, or Reno or Grand Rapids.”\n\nOther spots on the medium-term list include:\n\nSt. Louis, with possible service by Southwest.\n\nDetroit, with Delta a target.\n\nFurther out\n\nOn the long-term list of possibilities are another east coast destination, and an additional possibility in Mexico.\n\nBoston, with service from JetBlue is listed as a hope, and Cancun from either Alaska Airlines or Southwest."
