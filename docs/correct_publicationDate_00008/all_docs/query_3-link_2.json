        "text": "…to the official Brian W. Aldiss website. As well as being a distinguished SF writer, Aldiss is also an important mainstream novelist, a poet, an essayist, a dramatist, an SF historian and critic whose work has been published in dozens of countries around the world.In 2015 Brian wrote…I am trying to keep this quiet, but in August I am going to celebrate my ninetieth birthday.\n\nMy publishers will celebrate by publishing a limited edition in facsimile of my teenage collection of stories entitled ”Whip Donovan”. These wonderful survivors are liberally illustrated by my watercolour paintings. They were executed when I should have been studying theology…\n\nI am currently working on a long novel set in Russia in the 18th century. Typical SF, of course.\n\nHarper Voyager will soon reprint everything I wrote in the sixties decade (another case of missing theology…)\n\nBWA\n\nHothouse\n\nFantastically now re-released Hothouse (Penguin Modern Classics)\n\nGreybeard\n\nRe-released Greybeard (S.F. Masterworks)\n\n———————————————————————————-\n\n‘The titan of science fiction.’ Telegraph\n\n‘Brian Aldiss is one of the most influential – and one of the best – SF writers Britain has ever produced.’ Iain M Banks\n\n‘The best contemporary writer of science fiction.’ Guardian\n\n‘One of our best novelists.’ William Boyd\n\nIn The Press\n\nIn Why human educators must assert control as bots enter the classroom Lucas Kwong, a professor of English at New York City College of Technology, cites Supertoys Last All Summer Long as staple fare in the science fiction genre for the “‘boy and his robot’ trope”. The Venturebeat article goes on to discuss the merits of automation in the classroom and is a fascinating read.\n\nGraham Coxon, the guitarist from the band Blur is a Brian Aldiss fan. In this New Statesman article Graham mentions the following novels as recent inspiration to him: The Hand-Reared Boy, Hothouse, Super-State\n\nIn a recent article for the Evening Standard John Sutherland quite rightly highlights our on-going fascination with Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein: “Why does Frankenstein matter all these years later? Partly because of the romance of its conception, but mostly because Brian Aldiss, the dean of British science fiction, saw it as foundational. Why? Because it foresees the future: man plays God and creates life through science — then suffers as the creation turns on its creator.” John Sutherland’s Frankenstein’s Brain will be published by Icon Books in September.\n\nNews\n\nThe Aldiss Award for World Building in Fantasy & Science Fiction\n\nLaunched at Novacon ’23 the Aldiss Award will be awarded during Brian’s centenary year 2025 after a years’ worth of submissions and judging. The prize will be awarded for great world building and will not be limited to literature but also embrace games and film & TV. More info here.\n\nCurtis Brown & Brightfount\n\nFrom the brightfount.com website:\n\nOur name comes from Brian Aldiss’ first novel, the bookstore farce The Brightfount Diaries. In the first half of the book, there is a sub-plot revolving around ‘saucer books‘. Aldiss uses this as an excuse to stretch his imaginary muscle:\n\n“Supposing these beings from another world arrived. Imagine them as dry, detached intellects in a sponge-like body; they casually present man with the secret of anti-gravity. In the succeeding outburst of space travel and planetary exploration, what an orgy of – not adventure as the rocket-writers predict – but learning would follow! The barriers of every science would be broken down: geology, physiology….“\n\nIt’s the most powerful writing in the book, a shock of revolutionary ideas embedded in a social comedy. We like to think of this section of the book as Aldiss finding his voice and his passion. We want Brightfount to be a place where you find your voice and your passion\n\nMore info here: brightfount.com/mission/"
