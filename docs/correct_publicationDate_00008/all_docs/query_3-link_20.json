His byline reads either Brian W. Aldiss or simply Brian Aldiss, except for occasional pseudonyms during the mid-1960s.[1]\n\nGreatly influenced by science fiction pioneer H. G. Wells, Aldiss was a vice-president of the international H. G. Wells Society. He was (with Harry Harrison) co-president of the Birmingham Science Fiction Group. Aldiss was named a Grand Master by the Science Fiction Writers of America in 2000 and inducted by the Science Fiction Hall of Fame in 2004. He received two Hugo Awards, one Nebula Award, and one John W. Campbell Memorial Award.[1] He wrote the short story \"Supertoys Last All Summer Long\" (1969), the basis for the Stanley Kubrick-developed Steven Spielberg film A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001). Aldiss was associated with the British New Wave of science fiction.[1]\n\nSeries[]\n\nHoratio Stubbs series[]\n\nGenres: Literary Fiction\n\nTheme:\n\nSeries list:\n\nThe Hand-Reared Boy (1970)\n\nA Soldier Erect (1971)\n\nA Rude Awakening (1978)\n\nThe Squire Quartet[]\n\nGenres: Other then the 4th book, this series is considered more Literary Fiction, then Speculative Fiction.\n\nTheme:\n\nSeries list:\n\nLife in the West (The Squire Quartet Book 1) (1980, reissued 2014)\n\nForgotten Life (The Squire Quartet Book 2) (1988, reissued 2014)\n\nRemembrance Day (The Squire Quartet Book 3) (1993, reissued 2014)\n\nSomewhere East of Life (The Squire Quartet Book 4) (1994, reissued 2014)\n\nHelliconia Trilogy[]\n\nGenres: Sci Fi Colonization, Dystopian\n\nTheme:\n\nSeries list:\n\nHelliconia Spring (The Helliconia Trilogy Book 1) (1982, reissued 2014)\n\nHelliconia Summer (The Helliconia Trilogy Book 2) (1983, reissued 2014)\n\nHelliconia Winter (The Helliconia Trilogy Book 3) (1985, reissued 2014)\n\nOther Works[]\n\nNovels[]\n\nStarswarm (1954)\n\nThe Brightfount Diaries (1955)\n\nNon-Stop (1958)\n\nStarship (1958)\n\nNo Time Like Tomorrow (1959)\n\nVanguard from Alpha (1959)\n\nBow Down to Nul (1960) aka The Interpreter\n\nHothouse (1961, reissued 2015) aka The Long Afternoon of Earth\n\nThe Male Response (1961)\n\nThe Primal Urge (1961)\n\nThe Dark Light Years (1964)\n\nGreybeard (1964)\n\nEarthworks (1965)\n\nCryptozoic!
