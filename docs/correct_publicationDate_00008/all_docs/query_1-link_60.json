        "text": "Publisher’s Blurb\n\nThe sun is going nova – moon and earth are anchored together by traverser cables as giant vegetable spiders pass from one globe to another, basking in hard radiation. One fantastic banyan covers the sunny face of the earth, and the seashore is a battle ground where land and water species fight for living room. Sentient vegetation has developed an endless variety of offensive and defensive weapons.\n\nBrian Says\n\nThe true successor to Non-Stop, it appeared originally as a series of short stories in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction. It tells the story of how Gren and Yattmur lived to see the near-end of Earth, when the sun is going nova and Earth presents one face to it. Gren and the parasitic morel travel from brilliance into twilight. The terrors are relieved by the comedy of the tummy belly men.\n\nFIRST EDITION: Signet Books, 1962"
