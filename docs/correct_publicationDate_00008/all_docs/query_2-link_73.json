        "text": "“Hart remains a formidable rising talent.” —Publishers Weekly starred review\n\n“Bombastic whiz-bang fun.” —Kirkus\n\n**USA TODAY BESTSELLER**\n\nAvailable June 11, 2024\n\nPre-order it here.\n\nIn this surprising, witty thriller, the world’s most lethal assassin gives up the violent life, only to find himself under siege by mysterious assailants. It’s a kill-or-be-killed situation, but the first option is off the table. What’s a reformed hit man to do?\n\nMark was the most dangerous killer-for-hire in the world. But after learning the hard way that his life’s work made him more monster than man, he left all of that behind, and joined a 12-step group for reformed killers.\n\nWhen Mark is viciously attacked by an unknown assailant, he is forced on the run, from New York to Singapore to London, chasing after clues while dodging attacks, trying to solve the puzzle of who’s after him, without killing anyone. Or getting killed himself.\n\nFor an assassin, Mark learns, non-violence is a real hassle.\n\n“Assassins Anonymous is the best kind of thriller. A kinetic river that moves inexorably forward to a soul stirring conclusion… Suspenseful, sentimental and ultimately redemptive, Assassins Anonymous is a can’t-miss novel from one of the most technically proficient writers working today.” —S.A. Cosby, New York Times best selling author of Razorblade Tears and All the Sinners Bleed\n\n“Absolutely wonderful! From concept to execution (so to speak!) Assassins Anonymous sets the standard for smart, compelling, nonstop crime fiction—all told in the resonant voice of a natural born (wait for it…) storyteller! I read Hart’s book in one sitting and I am positive you will too. Bravo!” —Jeffery Deaver, bestselling author of Hunting Time and The Watchmaker’s Hand\n\n“Rob Hart’s Assassins Anonymous isn’t just a great, brutal, action-packed hitman story—it’s a simmering character study that digs deep into what it’s like to struggle with addiction. Few books can balance being a thrilling page-turner and heartfelt personal saga, but Hart makes it look easy.” —Alex Segura, bestselling author of Secret Identity\n\n“In a novel packed with explosive fight scenes and non-stop action, Rob Hart has written a fresh, thoughtful and surprisingly self-aware lead character in former assassin Mark, who’s trying to start a new chapter of his life. Assassins Anonymous has an emotional center I didn’t expect in a book about a professional killer. As a long time fan of Hart’s, this is one hell of a ride, and certainly his best book yet.” —Jennifer Hillier, USA Today bestselling and award-winning author of Things We Do in the Dark\n\n“If John Wick was more of a talker, you’d get Assassins Anonymous: the ultimate assassin’s assassin who’s not afraid to grapple with the issue of morality.” —Alma Katsu, former CIA officer and author of Red London\n\n“As a devoted reader and writer of assassination, conspiracy and black-ops thrillers, I can say without hesitation that Rob Hart has knocked this one out of the park. A perfect mix of unforgettable characters, realistic action, wry humor, and unpredictable twists.” —Steven Konkoly, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post bestselling author\n\n“With Assassins Anonymous Rob Hart takes his swing at the hit-man-on-the-run thriller and knocks it out of the park. This book is fast, brutal, and slick—an adrenaline cocktail with a double-espresso chaser. So good I wish I’d written it first.” —Deanna Raybourn, New York Times bestselling author of Killers of a Certain Age"
