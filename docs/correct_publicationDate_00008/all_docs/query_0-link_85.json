        "text": "AUGUST 18, 1925\n\nBrian Aldiss is an author, anthologist, and critic who has written more than 370 short stories and over 30 novels and was a noted member of the 1960s New Wave of science fiction. He is a key figure in British science fiction literature.\n\nBefore starting his prolific literary career, Aldiss served in the British Army in Burma and Sumatra until 1947. When he returned home, he secured a job in an Oxford bookstore where his literary career would eventually start. Aldiss began publishing short stories in 1954. In 1958, he published his first novel, Non-Stop.\n\nLater works include Hothouse (1962) and Greybeard (1964), both of which won a Hugo Award. His short story, “Super-Toys Last All Summer Long” (1969) inspired the Ridley Scott/Steven Spielberg film A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001). His Helliconia (1982–1985) series explores the history of a planet whose year is equivalent to 2,500 years on Earth. The first volume, Helliconia Spring, won the 1983 John W. Campbell Memorial Award."
