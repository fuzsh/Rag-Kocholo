        "text": "It's finally here: the long-awaited sequel to Lise Bourbeau's popular book, Heal your wounds and find your true self, published in 2001 and still achieving record-breaking sales with translations in 16 languages.\n\nWith this book, the author really wants to help you discover the tremendous influence and power that your ego can have on you. She shares her wealth of personal experience to guide those who are looking for concrete ways to heal their suffering.\n\nYou will learn to recognize the operating mechanisms of the five wounds and be better able determine when they are preventing you from simply being yourself, i.e. happy. By applying the techniques suggested, you will become aware of the countless occasions when your ego is controlling your thoughts, words and actions: a vital condition for healing and taking control of your life so that you can be your true self.\n\nWhat would you say to having a different view of cancer, that notorious word that has scared — and continues to scare — millions of people every year throughout the world? Why not consider this illness, even with all its devastating effects, as a friend rather than an enemy that one must struggle against?\n\nThe way you perceive this word is entirely your responsibility.\n\nThis book seeks to present a perception that is new and different from anything that has been written to date. Indeed, Lise Bourbeau uses an unprecedented approach that is based on the thousands of cancer stories she has heard over these last thirty years.\n\nThrough this book and the many experiences shared in it, Lise Bourbeau offers you only gentle methods that do not involve struggle, because fighting demands so much energy that it leaves none for anything else.\n\nThis book is intended for all those who are affected in one way or another by cancer today, including:\n\nthose who have already had cancer;\n\nthose who have cancer now;\n\nthose who are worried about a friend, relative or family member who has cancer;\n\ntherapists and caregivers who want access to tools for helping their clients or patients;\n\nand, of course, all those who wish to prevent this illness.\n\nCancer is not an inevitable fate but rather a message aimed at helping you recover happiness and inner peace. Cancer seen this way becomes an opportunity for transformation and for loving yourself.\n\nLiberate yourself from the control this word has over you and transform it into a springboard for inner peace.\n\nDid you know that what we eat is among the most frequently discussed subjects in the media and in advertising? The lucrative food book industry is constantly churning out volumes on everything from research to recipes and diets. This book, however, is different. It has nothing in common with them because its goals are to…\n\n... help you discover that there are six reasons besides hunger that make you want to eat;\n\n... show you how much you control your food intake and how that can be bad for you;\n\n... teach you to quickly recognize the emotional wounds that prevent you from eating well; and\n\n... help you love and accept your body, and especially who you are at every moment.\n\nLise Bourbeau, a world renowned specialist on listening to your body, provides us here with numerous solutions and constructive pathways.\n\nDo you have the impression that you are constantly controlling what you're eating? Were you ever affected by anorexia or bulimia? Can you tell when you are at that critical point where you stop just eating and begin to let yourself go? Are you able to love yourself even if you often lose control of your daily eating habits?\n\nDid you know that you can get to know yourself by observing your eating habits?\n\nThis eagerly awaited book offers an entirely new way of looking at your relationship with your food. It reveals the connection between the physical, emotional, mental and spiritual dimensions of the person and can help you, in this way, to discover your own specific needs at any given time.\n\nDo you sometimes feel as though you are getting nowhere in your personal agenda? Do problems that you thought resolved seem to keep resurfacing? Perhaps you are simply not using the correct approach.\n\nThis new book by Lise Bourbeau, just as reliable as those before it, demonstrates that all problems of a physical, emotional or mental order come from five important sources of hurt: rejection, abandonment, humiliation, betrayal and injustice. Thanks to the carefully detailed description of these inner wounds, and the masks that you have designed in order to not see or feel them, you will come to identify the true cause of a certain problem in your life.\n\nThese masks will also give you answers concerning extreme skinniness or obesity.\n\nThis book will allow you to move along onto the path of recovery which leads to the ultimate desired result: being yourself.\n\nLise Bourbeau, as always, offers you a practical solution at the end of this book in order to turn your day-to-day problems into stepping-stones toward personal growth and to become aware once more that you are a creative GOD.\n\nLise Bourbeau has compiled 20 years of research in the field of metaphysics and it's physical manifestations in the body and brought it all to the forefront in this user-friendly reference guide, Your body is telling you Love yourself!\n\nSince 1982, she has worked successfully with over 15,000 people, helping them to unearth the underlying causes of specific illnesses and diseases. The accuracy and devotion to the truth that characterize her technique has proven itself in the innumerable transformations that have resulted.\n\nShe is certain that any physical problem is simply the outward manifestation of dis-ease on psychological and/or emotional levels. The physical body is responding to this imbalance and warning of the need to return to the path of love and harmony.\n\nMetaphysics is a philosophy that methodically investigates the nature of first principles and problems of ultimate reality. Its link with the physical is critical to permanent healing and is, by no means contraindicated in conjunction with conventional medicine. On the contrary, it is medicine's most valuable teammate.\n\nCover to cover, the reader discovers a most powerful tool, as he becomes his own healer. The reference material, a comprehensive guide to the causes of over 500 illnesses and diseases, is a succinct and visionary work that is truly and literally a labor of love.\n\nIn 1987, LISE BOURBEAU began to share her ideas in book form as an adjunct to her workshops and seminars. The reception to her writing was overwhelming! Her simple, direct approach to subjects that, for generations, had been cloaked in confusion and misinterpretation, was welcomed and refreshing.\n\nThere is a widespread, pervasive need for balance in the world - on an individual level and on a global one. People are searching for happiness and inner peace. In a world of chaos and uncertainty, where do you find it? The answer lies within each of us.\n\nLISE BOURBEAU takes you by the hand and, step by step, leads you beyond \"packing your own parachute\", to taking that step back into the clear, refreshing stream of life that flows from the Universal Source. She gives you the tools, not only to fix what is wrong in your life, but to build a solid foundation for your inner house - a foundation that extends as far as the global village. In her most recent book, \"LISTEN TO YOUR BODY - YOUR BEST FRIEND ON EARTH\" she helps you build an intimate, rewarding and powerful relationship with the most important person in your life - yourself.\n\n\"LISTEN TO YOUR BODY - YOUR BEST FRIEND ON EARTH\" is a simple, comprehensive guide that will bring its readers closer to peace, love and harmony. It is a lifeline to the Divine."
