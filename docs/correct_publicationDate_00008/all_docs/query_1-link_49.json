        "text": "Here is an adventure story complete with such traditional ingredients as a lost tribe, sinister traces of a mighty former civilisation, and a hero, Roy Complain, who, purged by peril, comes eventually to find himself. But these classic ingredients have undergone a romantic metamorphosis: no tribe has ever been more thoroughly lost than the Greene tribe, and when Roy Complain and Priest Marapper set out for the fabled region called Forwards, they are heading for a series of shocks which will surprise the most hardened reader. For this is science fiction at its best, a realm where the logical happening is the unexpected one.\n\nNon-Stop is the classic SF novel of discovery and exploration; a brilliant evocation of a familiar setting seen through the eyes of a primitive.\n\nWe are very proud of the condition of the books we sell (please read our testimonials to find out more!)\n\nNew: Exactly as it says.\n\nAs New: Pretty much new but shows small signs of having been read; inside it will be clean without any inscriptions or stamps; might contain a remainder mark.\n\nVery Good: Might have some creases on the spine; no hard cracks; maybe slight forward lean and short inscription inside; perhaps very minor bumping on the corners of the book; inside clean but the page edges might be slightly yellowed.\n\nGood: A few creases on the spine, perhaps a forward lean, bumping on corners or shelfwear; maybe an inscription inside or some shelfwear or a small tear or two on the dustjacket; inside clean but page edges might be somewhat yellowed.\n\nFair: In overall good condition, might have a severe forward lean to the spine, an inscription, bumping to corners; one or two folds on the covers and yellowed pages; in exceptional cases these books might contain some library stamps and stickers or have neat sticky tape which was used to fix a short, closed tear.\n\nPoor: We rarely sell poor condition books, unless the books are in demand and difficult to find in a better condition. Poor condition books are still perfect for a good read, all pages will be intact and none threatening to fall out; most probably a reading copy only."
