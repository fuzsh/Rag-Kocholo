Original brown cloth, spine lettered in silver, later issue dust jacket. London, Faber & Faber. Signed by the author to the title page. A superb copy of the second published novel by the prolific British science fiction writer Brian Aldiss set around the total collapse of law and order amongst the inhabitants of a huge generation or 'ark' starship. A fine copy, with only the slightest hint of toning to spine panel, review slip from the publishers for a later 1967 reissue of the book loosely inserted, and later issue jacket. - Non-Stop",
