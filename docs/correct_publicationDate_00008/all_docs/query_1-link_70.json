        "text": "I’ve talked about Brian Aldiss and Dystopian fiction previously. Its a popular genre. Aldiss published Greybeard in 1964 (my copy is a 1965 American mass market paperback – the first paperback printing). He’d already had some success with Non-Stop and Hothouse, though his most well known work – the Heliconia Trilogy – was still some 20 years away.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe novel is set at about year 2030. Nuclear tests in Earth’s upper atmosphere have rendered humans, and most large mammals, almost completely sterile. Our title character, Greybeard, is in his mid-50s and he is one of the youngest people on the planet. Of course, society has broken down quite a bit. There are places where the older people live and enjoy life and engage in commerce. But most are dead and most of the survivors live in remote villages, constantly on guard against marauders. Greybeard seeks something more and also sort of thrives in this world. “The hardship of it was a pleasure. Life was a pleasure” (Greybeard, 75)\n\nThe book contains a number of flashbacks to important points in Greybeard’s life: the death of his father during childhood following the financial collapse of his father’s industry – children’s toys; his life as a soldier and decision to join DOUCH(E); his escape from a power-mad city dictator to the country-side. The book generally follows a trip down the river to the coast by Greybeard, his wife and a few others. They ultimately meet and “adopt” a roughly ten-year-old boy who seems to be perfectly normal and also the embodiment of hope for the future. The book ends on a hopeful note as Greybeard is nearing the coastline.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nDOUCH(E)\n\nThis unfortunate acronym confused me much early in the book. It has nothing to do with showering, washing, feminine hygiene, nor contraception. So I though I would say a quick word about it in case anyone comes to this website wondering, what they heck is Aldiss talking about? This is just an acronym. What exactly it stands for is buried somewhere in the book and not explained initially – or if it was it wasn’t explicit enough to keep me from scratching my head. Its just a paramilitary organization aimed at collecting data about the end of the world – the way humanity adjusts to having no children and finally dies out. For who? A possible posterity? Aliens? A different intelligent life form that may evolve and understand our means of communication.\n\nOur protagonist, Greybeard, joins up, leaving the war effort to do so. Why? He really doesn’t know. But his girl friend is brought to NYC to live with him while he trains. Sounds fun, so he does it. He ends up shipping out to England (the “(E)” in DOUCH(E)) where he stays for the rest of the book.\n\nI found it: Documentation of Universal Contemporary History, English wing. Page 54. You’d think they could have got another acronym. But maybe when the world has completely gone to hell you just don’t care.\n\nFlashbacks\n\nThe book is 7 chapters. Chapters 1, 3, 5, and 7 are set in the “present day,” Aldiss’s imagined post-apocalyptic England in the year 2030. The even chapters are flashbacks to Greybeard’s life. The even chapters just aren’t as good. I recommend leaving them out. You get less of a picture of the whole situation, but a better story, a more accurate glimpse into the weird world of the future. In short, I really didn’t feel the flashbacks added much and when/if I re-read Greybeard, it will be sans flashbacks.\n\nNo kids – dream or nightmare?\n\nThese housekeeping details out of the way, what a weird world to imagine. Many have seen, and few have read, Children of Men which is built around a similar conceit. (I think Atwood’s Handmaid’s Tale deals with it as well though I haven’t gotten there yet.) What will people be like if we completely lose our fruitfulness? War. Bloodshed. One might think there would be a strong emphasis put on the value of life, but I bet these authors get it right. With no hope for the future, for posterity, with no concern about the state in which you will leave the world to the next generation, why bother?\n\nWe live in a world that doesn’t seem to particularly value kids. There’s “birth control.” And if you make a mistake as a young lady, you can always fall back on abortion. The children we have we often scorn. We discipline poorly. We let the state “teach” them. We have little concept on what life is even for. Figure it out yourself. Most young parents these days were not taught by their parents what life is about, so how can they pass that on? I suppose it has always been this way to a degree, but “the pill” and abortion access seem to have turned up the volume to 11.\n\nIts a bleak world Aldiss describes, but it is not without hope. There is always hope that some people are still making babies and that those babies can grow up and repopulate a world that we have so royally screwed up.\n\nAldiss describes the small communities of people as the places where “the mammal with the big brain eked out his dotage” (71).\n\nIt reminds me of McCarthy’s, The Road. The Man in that book basically lives to care for his son, in hope that he will someday have some semblance of a normal life. The Man muses early in the novel, “If he is not the word of God God never spoke” regarding the boy, his “warrant.”\n\nAldiss gets gritty at times, never as much as McCarthy though. The writing is good. These story moves well – though better without the flashbacks (skip them). He gives us a good look at our protagonist and several interesting side-characters. There is a some-kind Christian who has a strong moral backbone. He aids Greybeard every step. There is a charlatan-healer who can give out eternal life. Did I say give? I meant sell, of course. But my favorite is Jeff Pitt. He was ordered to kill Greybeard in one of the flashbacks, but he chickened out. He’s not an honorable man, nor is he a good man. He isn’t personable or thoughtful. But he is loyal. That’s the thing about these Aldiss characters – they all have these redeeming qualities and the feel like real people. Real people in a strange world.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nI enjoyed it. Give it a try. Skip the flashbacks. I liked Non-Stop better though. And I’ve taken to occasionally tweeting about super-intelligent space rats. I doubt anything in Greybeard will carry over. We’ll see. Looking forward the his Helliconia Trilogy."
