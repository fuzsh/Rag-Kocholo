        "text": "Bio: Ryan Steck (follow on Twitter @RyanSteckAuthor) is a freelance editor, an author, and the founder and editor in chief of The Real Book Spy. Ryan has been named an “Online Influencer” by Amazon and is a regular columnist at CrimeReads. Praised as “One of the hardest working, most thoughtful, and fairest reviewers out there” by #1 New York Times bestselling author Lisa Scottoline, Steck has “quickly established himself as the authority on mysteries and thrillers” (Author A.J. Tata) on his way to being endorsed by #1 New York Times bestsellers Mark Greaney, Brad Thor, Kyle Mills, Jack Carr, C.J. Box, and many others. His debut novel, FIELDS OF FIRE, is now available in bookstores. His second novel, LETHAL RANGE, comes out on August 8, 2023.\n\nLETHAL RANGE (Book 2 in the Matthew Redd series – *IN STORES AUGUST 8th!*)\n\nFrom the Real Book Spy, Ryan Steck, comes another riveting Matthew Redd thriller.\n\nOn an island off the coast of Spain, Matthew Redd and his FBI fly team surveil a luxury villa in hopes of catching a high-value fugitive. But when Redd leads an unauthorized raid on the villa, he discovers they’ve been set up, and he is sent home to face the consequences of defying orders.\n\nMeanwhile, Redd’s wife, Emily, is on a remote stretch of Montana road driving their sick baby to the doctor when she finds her SUV surrounded by a biker gang intent on harassing her. As the bikers pound her fenders and her infant son screams, Emily fights to keep the SUV on the road . . . and then suddenly the bikers back off, leaving her safe but shaken.\n\nRedd returns home, suspended from his team and certain that he is to blame for Emily’s harassment after his run-in with the local biker gang the year before. Fearing that there is more to come, he prepares to defend his family. But Redd soon learns the gang is stronger in numbers than he could’ve imagined, and there is more behind their vendetta than he could’ve guessed. As his son’s condition worsens and his beloved ranch faces financial ruin, he finds himself fighting a war on multiple fronts―one he can’t win on his own . . .\n\nGET YOUR COPY TODAY!\n\nTYNDALE AMAZON Barnes & Noble BAM ChristianBook Indiebound Walmart\n\nFIELDS OF FIRE (Book 1 in the Matthew Redd Series – NOW AVAILABLE)\n\nGET YOUR COPY TODAY!\n\nTYNDALE AMAZON Barnes & Noble BAM ChristianBook Indiebound Walmart\n\nPraise for Fields of Fire\n\n“Ryan Steck’s FIELDS OF FIRE busts out of the chute with non-stop action and it never lets up until the final page.
