With remnants and/or residue of sticky tape on endpapers, covers & dustjacket. Slight wear & slight soiling to spine, covers & corners. ; \"Non-Stop\" by Brian W. Aldiss is a thought-provoking science fiction novel set aboard a generational spaceship, originally destined for a distant planet. Unbeknownst to the current inhabitants, the mission has long been abandoned, and generations have passed with the ship traveling aimlessly through space. The descendants of the original crew have forgotten their true purpose and history, living in a tribal society within the overgrown decks of the ship, where the original functions of the spaceship have devolved into myth and superstition. The story follows Roy Complain, a discontented tribesman who, spurred by a series of personal and communal crises, joins a group of explorers led by a priest, Marapper. They seek to discover the secrets of their world. Their journey leads them through the strange environments of the ship, revealing the truth about their society's origins and the nature of the spaceship. \"Non-Stop\" is an exploration of human resilience, the quest for knowledge, and the unveiling of one's own reality. ; 19 x 13 x 2 cms; 252 pages; Signed by Author.\n\nOriginal Cloth.

The price clipped DJ is complete but has a lot of edge wear, spotting, darkening to the spine and interior foxing. A chance to own this very scarce book in DJ at an affordable price.

Original brown cloth, spine lettered in silver, later issue dust jacket. London, Faber & Faber. Signed by the author to the title page. A superb copy of the second published novel by the prolific British science fiction writer Brian Aldiss set around the total collapse of law and order amongst the inhabitants of a huge generation or 'ark' starship. A fine copy, with only the slightest hint of toning to spine panel, review slip from the publishers for a later 1967 reissue of the book loosely inserted, and later issue jacket.\n\nHardcover. First edition (& 1st binding state). The author's first sf novel. First binding state ((Currey A) of red/maroon boards and spine lettered in gold: verso of half-title page lists just two books (Space, Time And Nathaniel and The Brightfount diaries) - a later printing in brown cloth lists eight titles (see Currey: Science Fiction And Fantasy Authors, A Bibliography of First Printings of Their Fiction, p. 3). Published in the USA a year later as STARSHIP, which was really stupid and kind of spoils everything as the whole point of the novel is that you only slowly realise (like in the last 20 pages) that events are taking place on a Generation Starship and not on a planet! SIGNED BY THE AUTHOR. Very faint spotting along top page edges, else a fine copy in a near fine (bright, unfaded pictorial) dustjacket.\n\nFirst Edition. First Edition. Copy belonging to the author's British agent, E.J. Carnell in London, with their label on the front endpaper, reading \"NON-STOP / by / Brian W. Aldiss / First American Rights\" in manuscript manual type. Considered by many to be Aldiss' finest work. The American edition, for which this copy was ostensibly the template, was retitled \"Starship,\" with many textual revisions. An exceptional copy of the author's third book in terms of both condition and relevance to its publication history. In a custom red cloth slipcase. A touch of rubbing to the jacket rear panel along with a small closed tear and a 1-inch tear (neatly repaired with cellotape at the verso).

The author's first sf novel. Issued later with textual differences in the U.S. as STARSHIP (1959). \". a brilliant treatment of the generation starship and also the theme of conceptual breakthrough in a kind of spacegoing ruined-Earth society; it has become a classic of the field and in 2008 was awarded a retrospective British Science Fiction Association Award for best novel of 1958.\" - John Clute / David Pringle, SFE (online). Anatomy of Wonder (1995) 3-4. Pringle: Science Fiction: The 100 Best Novels #25. Gerber, Utopian Fantasy (1973), p. 160.
