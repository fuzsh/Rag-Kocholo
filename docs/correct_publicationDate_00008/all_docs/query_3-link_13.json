        "text": "Born in 1925, Brian Aldiss’ love affair with sci-fi and storytelling began at an early age. An avid fan of pulp magazines, H.G. Wells, and Robert Heinlein, he began penning his own originals in his mid-teens. A brief stint in the British Army put a hold on his writing, though he dove back into books after World War II—from selling them to publishing them himself. His first book of science fiction came in 1957, with the short story collection Space, Tim and Nathaniel, jump-starting a very prolific career in and out of the genre. He soon became the president of the British Science Fiction Association, a newspaper editor, a popular anthologist, and a full-time author. He found great success—earning two Hugo Awards, a Nebula, and prestigious distinction as a Grand Master and Science Fiction Hall of Famer—before passing away in 2017.\n\nAldiss’ work is an example of the British New Wave, a once-controversial brand of sci-fi that was more experimental and “high brow” than its pulpier counterparts. Like the other authors of the movement (including Harlan Ellison), Aldiss played with form and content—writing well over 30 inventive novels and short story collections. Though he flitted between genres and was also devoted to art, his science fiction represents some of his best work—and you can find a list of his must-read titles below."
