        "text": "This is not a terribly good book. But there are reasons for that. And that is not to say it is without its good points. I believe it was also published as The Year Before Yesterday. What that means, I don’t know. ‘The last 12 months’. I guess.\n\nFirst, the structure:\n\nThe book is subtitled ‘A novel in three acts’, but it would be more accurate to say it is two short novels within a framing device.\n\nThe first short novel is The Impossible Smile, an overheated tale of espionage, torture and the transhuman future, set in a 1995 (I think that’s right) in which the Nazi invasion of Britain succeeded. The front matter says it was published ‘in a different form’ in Impulse in 1965. How different, I don’t know. That Aldiss published it back then under a pseudonym — the rather unlikely Jael Cracken (up there with Vargo Statten, Pel Toro and others) — suggests that at the time Aldiss was not that keen on being associated with it. It is a fast-moving story, and I cannot help but wonder if it is in some degree a pastiche of Tiger, Tiger (The Stars, My Destination), with its telepathic hero and its frenetic pace. It amounts to one long chase scene as our hero, Wyvern, continually slides into and out of trouble on Earth and the Moon as he searches for answers and a mysterious telepathic woman.\n\nThe second, Equator, is also a long chase. Published in New Worlds in 1958, the year Aldiss’s more highly-regarded first novel, Non-stop came out, and later as half an Ace double (as Vanguard from Alpha), this is probably the better tale. Like the first, it is somewhat overplotted, and replete with characters trying to explain the series of double-crosses to each other. Here, those double-crosses are rather the point of the tale, at least, and the story does not hinge too heavily on our being surprised by the twists. The setting — a humid Sumatra — is evoked very effectively, presumably as a result of Aldiss being stationed in the East in WWII — but the characters are essentially cogs in the plot.\n\nIn this story, we have aliens landed on Earth, stolen microfilm, lots of gunfire, endless chases, a beautiful alien girl, and a whole series of other components that Aldiss would soon shed in books like Hothouse, Greybeard and The Dark Light Years.\n\nBut, recall, this is less than four years after his first SF stories appeared. It is very much the beginning of his first phase as an author, and it shows. The skilled use of language is in evidence, but he feels compelled to marry it to a pulpy plot that will suit his intended market. He’s not ready to shape the field — he is meeting its expectations.\n\nThe framing story is set in Finland in an alternative universe; Churchill was assassinated in 1935 on a trip to Finland, and England failed to withstand the Nazis. Whether this is therefore the same universe as The Impossible Smile, I am not sure.\n\nThese bits were written in the mid-80s. They tell the tale of a composer who finds a dead girl by the road while he walks home at night, and carries her to his home, then calls the police, and complexities ensure with his wife, the police and so on. He finds two pulpy paperbacks amongst her possessions and proceeds to read them, and compares his own life with what he sees there, and critiques the commercial, simplistic tales, yet admits to enjoying them.\n\nI recall reading somewhere that this book (a fixup, in SFE terminology) was assembled to meet a request from a friend. I can imagine that after the enormous effort of Helliconia, Aldiss was perhaps susceptible to a suggestion that would result in a book with relatively little effort.\n\nThis is a minor work, of interest to Aldiss fans and people who like fast-moving, short, plot-based novels of SF adventure from the 50s and early 60s. For a more general reader, I suspect there is little to see here.\n\nThe all-too-possible frown."
