        "text": "Brian Wilson Aldiss, OBE ( ; 18 August 1925 â€“ 19 August 2017) was an English writer and anthologies editor. He was best known for science fiction novels and short stories. His byline reads either Brian W. Aldiss or simply Brian Aldiss, except for occasional pseudonyms during the mid-1960s.\n\nGreatly influenced by science fiction pioneer H. G. Wells, Aldiss was a vice-president of the international H. G. Wells Society. He was (with Harry Harrison) co-president of the Birmingham Science Fiction Group.\n\nAldiss was named a Grand Master by the Science Fiction Writers of America in 2000, and inducted by the Science Fiction Hall of Fame in 2004. He received two Hugo Awards, one Nebula Award, and one John W. Campbell Memorial Award. He wrote the short story \"Super-Toys Last All Summer Long\" (1969), the basis for the Stanley Kubrick-developed Steven Spielberg movie A.I. Artificial Intelligence. Aldiss was associated with the British New Wave of science fiction.[1]\n\nAldiss died at his Oxford home one day after his 92nd birthday on 19 August 2017.[2][3]"
