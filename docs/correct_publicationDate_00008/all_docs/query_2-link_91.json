        "text": "There are some people who will read everything I have just described and respond with a variation of, “This is awful, but aren’t you only in this situation because of the attack launched by Hamas?”\n\nOn one level, it is obvious that this weekend’s violence began with the surprise assault from Hamas. But this line of thinking presupposes that everything in Gaza was peaceful until Hamas decided to disrupt that peace, or that no Palestinians have been dying at Israeli hands before the last two days.\n\nThe reality is that Israel has been slowly killing all 2.3 million people in Gaza for the past 16 years, systematically subjugating Gazans to a series of apartheid policies that have affected the most basic details of our lives. Palestinians in the occupied West Bank are also subjected to daily violence and degradation. The aim is to dispossess the Palestinians to the point that the people are left stranded with nothing but mere calls for the outside world to end what so many have called a form of “collective punishment.”\n\nAd Policy\n\nPopular\n\n“swipe left below to view more authors”Swipe →\n\nThe Illusion of Party Unity in the Democratic Party The Illusion of Party Unity in the Democratic Party\n\nNorman Solomon\n\nBeware the People Who Claim “America Isn’t Ready for a Black Woman President” Beware the People Who Claim “America Isn’t Ready for a Black Woman President”\n\nElie Mystal\n\nKamala Harris Steps Up Kamala Harris Steps Up\n\nFeature / Joan Walsh\n\nAndy Beshear Is Shredding J.D. Vance in the Virtual VP Debate Andy Beshear Is Shredding J.D. Vance in the Virtual VP Debate\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nIsrael does everything it can to make life in Gaza unbearable. It controls all of Gaza’s water resources. It imposes illegal barriers on all the entry points to the strip, effectively trapping Gazans inside (though some of those barriers have been breached in the last two days). It controls the flow of goods and services in and out of the strip, leaving it with the unilateral power to cut those services off, as it is doing now. It purposefully throttles Gaza’s economy.\n\nPalestinians who require medical attention outside Gaza often face insurmountable obstacles in obtaining necessary care. Similarly, young Palestinians are routinely prevented from pursuing their academic dreams at international colleges simply because they had the misfortune of being born as Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nThe people of Gaza endure daily hardships and injustices, yearning for a resolution that will allow them to lead dignified lives free from the burden of occupation and blockade. And when they do attempt to peacefully protest these conditions, Israel slaughters them in cold blood.\n\nSo the real question should not be “Why is this happening now?” It should be “How did this not happen sooner?” No people can be expected to endure the kind of oppression and discrimination that Palestinians face at the hands of the Israeli government forever without any kind of response. While Israel claims to be waging war against Hamas and other Palestinian resistance factions, it seeks to justify its war crimes and engages in collective punishment against the Palestinian people.\n\nEven if Israel were to win this war, it should not be seen as a victory. Hamas and other groups enjoy popular support for the same reason that colonized people everywhere have supported armed struggle throughout the centuries. The current conflict didn’t begin just two days ago; it began when Israel decided to treat Palestinians as less than equal human beings and forcibly displaced them from their ancestral lands and towns, the same lands they yearn to return to today.\n\nIf the people were not behind Hamas at this moment, they would be supporting anyone who uses whatever means they have to defend their land and people, to defy the prolonged suffering and occupation they have endured for seven decades amid the world’s silence and complicity.\n\nThe current conflict may come to an end if Palestinians manage to secure temporary conditions that meet their strategic needs, like lifting the Gaza blockade, easing the lives of Palestinians in the West Bank, and halting the aggression against Palestinians in the Al-Aqsa Mosque. But the underlying conflict will end only when the occupation ends, when apartheid ends, and when all of Palestine is free.\n\nIt’s worth questioning why Palestinians don’t hear calls for peace when they are forced to endure daily misery in Gaza, when they are denied the right to resist unjustified killings in Jenin, when they are driven from their homes in Jerusalem, or when they are imprisoned for chanting “no to apartheid” in the West Bank. The world often remains silent in the face of these ongoing injustices, and only speaks up when Palestinians exercise their legitimate and valid right to self-determination and self-defense against a cruel occupation. Only then can we hear loud condemnations.\n\nLife in Palestine and Gaza has never been what most would consider “normal.” It may take a long time for the immediate war to subside, but the reality is that even during so-called “peace” times, the oppressive ideology that undermines Palestinian lives persists. The Gaza blockade is reimposed, and the ongoing assaults against Indigenous Palestinians in Jerusalem and the West Bank continue.\n\nIt is during such times, when Israel aims at terrorizing, killing, and ultimately fragmenting the people, that we become more empowered from the inside. We know that our very existence is a form of resistance. The question, then, isn’t why Palestinians are fighting. Rather, it is how they will continue to resist the occupation until they achieve their ultimate goal of liberation."
