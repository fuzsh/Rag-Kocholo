This document, intended as a resource for researchers, is derived from the thesis "The Partisans’ Cemetery in Mostar, Bosnia & Herzegovina: Implications of the deterioration of a Monument and Site", defended at the Raymond Lemaire International Centre for Conservation, Faculty of Engineering Sciences, KU Leuven, Belgium, in September 2013. It discusses the architectural works of Bogdan Bogdanović (1922-2010) throughout the Former Yugoslavia, and gives an introduction to his opus by giving a brief description of each monument; its key architectural and landscape elements, history, and reason for construction. Alongside these details, the names given to the monuments (many lack an official name), both in various literature and colloquially are stated, and a summary of the protection laws currently covering the monument is given. The condition of the monument, and activities currently carried out at the site (both of a commemorative nature and otherwise) are also detailed. A copy of the full thesis can be obtained from the author upon request.
