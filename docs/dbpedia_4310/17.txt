Club career

Đorđević played for FK Obilić from 1999 to 2003. He played 97 league games and became one of the best defenders in the "Vitezovi" line up, before he signed for FK Partizan. From then on, Đorđević was very important and standard player of the team. He played in the 2003–04 UEFA Champions League under coach Lothar Matthäus and the 2004–05 UEFA Cup under coach Vladimir Vermezović, and also made 85 appearances in the national championship.

In February 2007, Đorđević signed for JEF United Ichihara Chiba,[1] and played there in the 2007 season.

After just one year, he returned to FK Partizan and signed a two and a half year contract with his former club, on 29 January 2008.[2] Đorđević played great after his return, especially in the first six months, when his goals directly decide the winner in a few games, and so was one of the most deserving for Partizan's title in the 2007–08 season, the club's first after three years.

On 8 April 2010, Đorđević signed a two-year contract with Russian Premier League side FC Krylia Sovetov Samara.[3] Only two days later, on 10 April 2010, he scored on his debut in a match against FC Saturn, which his club won 2–1.[4]

International career

Đorđević was capped 17 times for the Serbia and Montenegro national team, scoring 1 goal. He was also a member of the Serbia and Montenegro squad at the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
