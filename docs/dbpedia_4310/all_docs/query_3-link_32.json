It is ranked number one at International Science Olympiads by the number of medals won by its students (more than 400).\n\nThe School has developed its own Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade curriculum[1][2][3] in various mathematics, physics, and IT subjects. There are approx. 160 professors employed, mostly scientists. One half of the professors come from University of Belgrade staff, Institute of Physics Belgrade, and Mathematical Institute of Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts. More than half of the professors are former students of the School.\n\nSchool's staff maintains connections to, collaborates with, and frequently visits world's leading scientific institutions, such as CERN, Joint Institute for Nuclear Research ‚Äì Dubna, Lomonosov Moscow State University, UC Berkeley, Oxford, Cambridge, Warwick University, Imperial College London.\n\nEvery year more than half of the graduates receive scholarships from top USA and UK universities. In 2010 alone students of MG won 7 full scholarships for Trinity College, Cambridge (out of 11 Trinity awards globally), more than 40 full scholarships for UC Berkeley, Oxford, Cambridge, Warwick University, Imperial College London, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT, Columbia University, Stanford University, Harvard University, University College London, and 40 more partial scholarships for the world's top universities. The rest got full scholarships from University of Belgrade.\n\nThe School has 550 students, aged 12‚Äì19. There are 155 girls, and 395 boys.[4]\n\nThe average professors' work experience is 18 years.[5]\n\nContents\n\n1 School fame\n\n2 History\n\n3 List of school principals\n\n3.1 Principal among 300 most powerful people in Serbia\n\n4 Competitions\n\n4.1 International Olympiads\n\n4.2 Year 2009\n\n4.3 Year 2010\n\n4.4 Year 2011\n\n4.5 Other prizes and awards\n\n5 Working hours and shifts\n\n6 Curriculum and core subjects\n\n6.1 Mathematics\n\n6.2 Physics\n\n6.3 Informatics and Computer Science\n\n6.4 Business and Finance\n\n7 IT and ICT\n\n7.1 IT infrastructure and facilities\n\n7.2 History of school's IT Department\n\n7.3 School's IT club\n\n8 Sports\n\n9 Graduates and Alumni\n\n10 Acceptance to UK and USA universities\n\n11 Diploma relative value\n\n12 Collaboration\n\n13 Cooperation and financial support\n\n14 Enrollment\n\n15 Distinguished guests\n\n16 Legal status\n\n17 Teaching positions\n\n18 Teaching staff\n\n18.1 Average experience of teaching staff\n\n19 Building and facilities\n\n20 Location and security\n\n21 Celebration of 40 years of work\n\n22 References\n\n23 External links\n\nSchool fame\n\nMathematical Gymnasium is ranked as number one in the world in the field of mathematics. The School is famous for its unique results in international competitions and for results its students achieve at later stages of their university education.\n\nThe School has approx. 2,000 PhD holders in its alumni, and approx. 6,000 Master of Science degree holders. Its advanced curriculum earned it an esteemed reputation as the breeding ground for future scientists, researchers, and industry leaders.\n\nMathematical Gymnasium Belgrade is unique for its success in International Science Olympiads in Mathematics, Physics, Informatics, Astronomy, Astrophysics, and Earth Sciences: its students have won more than 400 medals so far, on all 5 continents of the world.[6]\n\nLatest examples include: 12 medals in 2009 in International Science Olympiads only, around 25 medals in total in 2009 alone,[7] 23 medals in 2010 in International Science Olympiads only, around 40 medals in total in 2010 alone.[8]\n\nIn 2010, as well as in 2009, Mathematical Gymnasium won the first prize and title of \"Absolute Winner\" at international competition in Moscow, organized by Special School \"Kolmogorov\" under Moscow State University ‚Äì Lomonosov (–°–ø–µ—Ü–∏–∞–ª–∏–∑–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–π —É—á–µ–±–Ω–æ-–Ω–∞—É—á–Ω—ã–π —Ü–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä –ú–æ—Å–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –≥–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ —É–Ω–∏–≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏—Ç–µ—Ç–∞ –∏–º.–ú.–í.–õ–æ–º–æ–Ω–æ—Å–æ–≤–∞ ‚Äì –®–∫–æ–ª–∞ –∏–º.–ê.–ù.–ö–æ–ª–º–æ–≥–æ—Ä–æ–≤–∞).[8][9]\n\nThe School is ranked as number one school in the world in the field of mathematics, taking the lead from Russian Special School \"Kolmogorov\",[9] (which operates under Moscow University), and is among the best 5 in physics and in informatics in the world, for its continuous success in International Science Olympiads.\n\nMathematical Gymnasium stands out with its own Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade curriculum,[1][2][3] focusing on natural sciences, especially mathematics, physics, and computer programming.\n\nHistory\n\nThe School was established in 1966, following the model of Kolmogorov School at Moscow University which had been launched in Moscow a year earlier, in 1965, under Lomonosov Moscow State University, by one of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century, Andrei Nikolayevich Kolmogorov, and which was later named after him ‚Äì Kolmogorov School.\n\nIn 1977, as part of a state-wide education reform in former Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia, the School was merged into the streamlined secondary education (in Serbian: srednje usmereno obrazovanje), thus cancelling many, but not all, specifics and advantages over other schools. At that time principal, professor dr sci Milan Raspopoviƒá was desperately pulling strings in scientific and policy making community to reestablish special status, special rights, special funding, and special curriculum Mathematical Gymnasium created. As a result, eleven years later, in 1988, the School was officially re-established as a specialized school, this time in form of experimental education institution.[10] New curriculum was officially published in 1989, in Official Gazette of Socialist Republic of Serbia, no.2, 15 April 1989.[11]\n\nThe \"experimental status\" finally concluded in 1995, when the School was recognized as a \"Specialized school for talented/gifted students in mathematics, informatics, physics and other natural sciences\" by the Serbian Ministry of Education. At the same time, the School was given the status of a \"school of special national importance\", as the first school of its kind in Yugoslavia.[12]\n\nAlthough MGB is formally classified as a special secondary school (\"srednja ≈°kola\", grades nine to twelve in the Serbian education system, for funding and other legal reasons), it enrolls experimental classes of the seventh and eight grade primary school (age 11‚Äì12 and above). It is the only school in Serbia and in all states formed from former Yugoslavia that has merged elementary school (or part of it) and high school.\n\nStudents of Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade have the highest Grade Point Average (GPA) compared to students from other schools and the same rule applies to their university studies, whether is Serbia or abroad.\n\nSee also: Academic grading in Serbia and Education in Serbia for more details.\n\nList of school principals\n\nThe School had 6 principals in its 45 years long history, all of whom are authors of university, high school, and elementary school textbooks and accompanying collections of solved problems and questions. Five principals were mathematicians, and one ‚Äì and the longest serving principal ‚Äì was a physicist.\n\nFive MGB principals with Doctor of Sciences titles, and one with Doctor of Science title, earned their degrees at University of Belgrade, and served as university professors and as professors at Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade.\n\nYear Principal 1966‚Äì1968 Ranko Radovanoviƒá, Magister of Sciences, director of Educational and Pedagogical Institute 1968‚Äì1970 Du≈°an Adnaƒëeviƒá,[13] Doctor of Sciences in Mathematics, University of Belgrade; Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, retired 1970‚Äì2001 Milan Raspopoviƒá, Doctor of Sciences in Physics and Philosophy, University of Belgrade; Faculty of Electrical Engineering [2], retired 2001/2‚Äì2004 Ljubomir Protiƒá, Doctor of Sciences in Mathematics; University of Belgrade, Faculty of Mathematics 2004‚Äì2008 Vladimir Dragoviƒá, Doctor of Sciences in Mathematics, University of Belgrade; Faculty of Mathematics 2008‚Äìpresent Srƒëan Ognjanoviƒá, Doctor of Science in Mathematics, University of Belgrade; Faculty of Mathematics\n\nProf. dr Milan Raspopoviƒá was one of the founders of Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade. He was a professor of physics and of philosophy, and was Principal of MGB for almost 32 years. Electronics was included in curriculum as a new subject under the leadership of professor Raspopoviƒá, and he was the first electronics teacher in MGB. Professor Raspopoviƒá introduced a new curriculum in physics with 50% more physics classes than before, introducing Relativistic physics, Relativistic dynamics, Quantum Physics, Quantum Mechanics, Molecular physics, Solid State Physics, Quantum Optics, Atomic Physics, Nuclear Physics, Nuclear Engineering, Elementary Particle Physics, and introduction to General Relativity. This led to higher diversity of MGB graduates and their leading roles in scientific institutions in Yugoslavia and important roles in prestigious international scientific institutions.\n\nProfessor Raspopoviƒá is the best selling physics author in former Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia with over 4 million sold copies. He set the standards for elementary and high school textbooks, and for future textbooks used exclusively in Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade. Prior to professor Raspopoviƒá's textbooks, students of MGB used university books in physics and, especially, Russian scientific literature. Some of the textbooks were translated to Serbo-Croatian, like B.M. Yavorsky, A.A. Pinsky Fundamentals of Physics.[14]\n\nThe author of university level physics textbooks, high school physics textbooks, elementary school physics textbooks, as well as physics problems and questions books, and of history and philosophy of physics textbooks and didactics textbook, professor Raspopoviƒá, along with associates from Department of Physics from Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade and with help from former students of MGB, developed special curriculum that now reflects itself in 48 medals from International Physics Olympiad and many physicists around the world.\n\nProfessors Dragoviƒá, Protiƒá, and Adnaƒëeviƒá,[13] all mathematicians and former Principals of MGB, and professor Ognjanoviƒá, mathematician and acting Director and Principal, are authors of numerous university, high school, and elementary school level textbooks and collections of solved problems in various mathematical disciplines and in didactics.\n\nAll Principals and Directors of MGB were actively involved in teaching process in Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade, prior to becoming principals.\n\nProfessors Ognjanoviƒá and Dragoviƒá graduated at Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade, in 1972 and 1984/6, respectively. (Professor Dragoviƒá left MGB 2 years prior to graduation, to directly enroll Faculty of Mathematics.)\n\nPrincipal among 300 most powerful people in Serbia\n\nOgnjanoviƒá was listed among the \"300 most powerful people in Serbia\",[16][17] in a list published annually by the Blic daily newspaper (14 February 2011), member of Axel Springer AG. The criteria were easiness in achieving goals, public awareness, financial and political influence, personal integrity and authority, respectiveness of the institution the institution the person represents, and personal charisma.\n\nCompetitions\n\nThe School prides itself on the success of its students in various science competitions, and takes special care in preparing students for national and international competitions. So far Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade students have won several hundred medals from top international competitions around the world. They won 121 medals at International Science Olympiads, about the same number at Junior Olympiads, and about double that number at other top competitions, mostly in USSR, Russia, China, India, and Europe.\n\nInternational Olympiads\n\nMGB students have won 121 medals at the international Olympiads in Mathematics, 52 medals at Olympiads in Physics, 22 medals at Olympiads in Informatics, 16 medals in Olympiads on Astronomy and Astrophysics, 12 medals in Olympiads in General Science and numerous other awards (data till 2005).[18][19][20]\n\nNumber of medals Competition 121 International Mathematics Olympiad 52 International Physics Olympiad 23 International Olympiad in Informatics 28 International Astronomy Olympiad 8 International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics 16 Olympiads in General Science more than 400 various other international competitions\n\nYear 2009\n\nIn 2009 only, during July and August, students of Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade have won 12 medals in International Olympiads: 5 medals in Olympiads in Mathematics, 4 medals in International Physics Olympiad, 3 medals in International Olympiad in Informatics, 3 medals in International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics, 1 medal and 3 honorable mentions in International Astronomy Olympiad.[21]\n\nTotal number of gold, silver and bronze medals, and honorable mentions, won in various international competitions in 2009 is 70.[21]\n\nYear 2010\n\nAt 2010 International Mathematics Olympiad (5‚Äì15 July 2010, Kazakhstan), Serbia was represented by a team of 6 competitors, all 6 students from Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade, 15‚Äì19 years old.

In the category of science, the winner of a Grand Prize was Luka Miliƒáeviƒá,[34] and the winner of Erste Bank Prize in the field of natural and technical sciences and technology was Du≈°an Milijanƒçeviƒá. Both students are final year students of D-division of Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade.\n\nAt Microsoft's Imagine Cup, students of Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade were in finals, among top 6 teams in the world.[35]\n\nOther numerous medals from the Balkans Olympiads in Mathematics, Physics and Informatics are being won every year.[18]\n\nThe Men Magazine award \"The MEN of the Year 2010\" went to 4 MGB students: Teodor fon Burg, Rade ≈†pegar, Stevan Gajoviƒá, and Filip ≈Ωivanoviƒá.\n\nMGB student Rade ≈†pegar gave a short speech at the ceremony about achievements in mathematics, physics, and informatics, and stresses the support the students receive from their professors (teachers). He also noted how important role sports play in everyday life in Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade, and explained how various sports sections function and how self organization plays an important role, both in sports and in science.\n\nWorking hours and shifts\n\nMathematical Gymnasium Belgrade opens its doors at 07:00 hours for students, and closes at 21:00 hours.\n\nLectures start at 07:45 hours for the morning shift, and end at 13:05 hours, or 13:55 hours.\n\nLectures start at 14:00 hours for the afternoon shift, or at 13:10 hours if necessary, and end at 19:20 hours, or at 20:15 hours if necessary.[36][37]\n\nStudents' shifts are divided into odd and even grades shifts.[36]\n\nOdd shift consists of 7th graders of elementary school (age: 13‚Äì14), 1st (age: 15‚Äì16) and 3rd (age: 17‚Äì18) graders of high school.\n\nEven shift consists of 8th graders of elementary school (age: 14‚Äì15), 2nd (age: 16‚Äì17) and 4th (age: 18‚Äì19) graders of high school.\n\nWeekends are used for extracurricular activities, in and out of school.[36]\n\nCurriculum and core subjects\n\nMain article: Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade curriculum\n\nSignificant number of classes was taken from various mathematics and physics disciplines in order to be added to humanities and arts subjects.[38] This is the what makes the revised Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade curriculum since 2009:[1][2][3]\n\nSubject Grade 7\n\n(elementary school) student age: 13‚Äì14\n\nGrade 8\n\n(elementary school) student age: 14‚Äì15\n\nGrade 1\n\n(high school) student age: 15‚Äì16\n\nGrade 2\n\n(high school) student age: 16‚Äì17\n\nGrade 3\n\n(high school) student age: 17‚Äì18\n\nGrade 4\n\n(high school) student age: 18‚Äì19\n\nMathematics\n\n(Algebra and Geometry)\n\n216[39]\n\n108 + 108\n\n204[40]\n\n102 + 102\n\nAnalysis and Algebra 144[41] 144[42] 144[43] 144[44] Geometry 144[45] 144[46] Linear Algebra and Analytical Geometry 108[47] Probability and Mathematical Statistics 64[48] Numerical Mathematics 64[49] Physics 108[50] 108[51] 144[52] 144[53] 144[54] 128[55] Astronomy 32[56] Chemistry 72[57] 68[58] 108[59] 108[60] 72[61] Technical Skills and ICT 36[62] 34[63] Informatics and Computer Science 168[64] 168[65] 92[66] 84[67] Advanced Programming Techniques 36[68] 36[69] Philosophy of Mathematics 36[70] Philosophy of Natural Sciences 36[71] Biology 72[72] 68[73] 108[74] 96[75] Serbian Language and Literature 144 136 144 108 108 128 Foreign Language ‚Äì English 72 68 72 72 72 64 Visual Arts 18 17 Musical Education 18 17 36 (*) Painting and Art Culture 36 (*) History 54 51 72 72 Geography 54 51 72 72 Psychology 72 Constitution and Civil Rights 36 Sociology 72 Philosophy 64 Civic Education 36 36 36 36 36 32 Second Foreign Language 72 72 72 (*) 72 (*) 72 (*) Physical Education (PE) 72 68 72 72 72 64 Physical Education (PE) ‚Äì Elective Sport 36 36 36 36 36 32 Religious Studies (*) 36 (*) 36 (*) 36 (*) 36 (*) 36 (*) 32 (*) Latin Language (*) 64 (*)\n\n(Note: all subjects are compulsory, except those marked with asterisk (*).)\n\nMathematics\n\nMathematics is divided into fields of Algebra, Geometry, Linear Algebra, Analytical Geometry, Mathematical Analysis, Probability, Statistics, Numerical Analysis, and Selected Chapters in Mathematics.\n\nPhysics\n\nDue to additional sources of funding, physics and computer labs in the School are equipped with the latest and state-of-the-art technology. Physics Department of MGB collaborates with many top ranked institutes in the world, and with all Yugoslav and Serbian physics and engineering institutes, including Vinƒça Institute for Nuclear Sciences, Institute of Physics Belgrade, Institute \"Michael Pupin\" (Serbian: \"Mihajlo Pupin\"), Faculty of Electrical Engineering,[3] and departments of physics and of engineering of all Serbian state universities.\n\nPhysics is taught from Newtonian mechanics, Fluid Dynamics, Waves, Optics, Electricity, Magnetism, to modern physics, usually ending with STR, Relativistic Dynamics, Quantum Theory, Quantum Mechanics, Molecular Physics, Physical Chemistry, Atomic Physics, Solid State Physics, Quantum Optics, Nuclear Physics, Nuclear Engineering, Elementary Particle Physics, and introduction to Astrophysics and Cosmology, General Relativity, and some basic introduction to String Theory, Cosmology, and M-Theory.\n\nInformatics and Computer Science\n\nThere are 5 computer labs in Mathematical Gymnasium, with ca. 110 dual core and quad core computers, and one super-computer. The School operates its own wireless network. Students gain knowledge in programming languages (Pascal, Delphi, C, C++, C#, Java; Fortran; Prolog), operating systems (Windows, Linux, Unix), databases and DBMS (Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL), and in various IT and ICT fields.\n\nThere are 10 two-semester (2√ó19 weeks) IT courses students must pass during schooling. There is one special (additional) week in each semester, reserved for IT subjects only (so called \"block classes\"), for students to have lessons only in ICT subjects.\n\nBusiness and Finance\n\nSchool offers modules in financial mathematics, as well as in business related studies, that broaden students' knowledge and help students connect mathematical knowledge, knowledge both in theoretical and experimental physics, and IT and ICT experience and theory, to a wide range of applications in a modern world and a future world society.\n\nMathematical Gymnasium Belgrade has a significant number of alumni work in a wide area of applied mathematics and applied physics, especially to economics and finance.\n\nIT and ICT\n\nIT infrastructure and facilities\n\nMathematical Gymnasium Belgrade is connected to Academic Network of Serbia (AMRES) via 1 Gbps optical cables. Internet connection is being realised through Computing Center of University of Belgrade (RCUB), using two independent links: Primary RCUB link has 1 Gbps capacity over Hungarian academic Network ‚Äì HUNGARNET, through which the Internet access and the connection with the European Academic Network ‚Äì G√âANT are being realised; secondary RCUB Internet link is being realized over Telekom Srbija, with the capacity of 34 Mbps. In comparison to the primary link, this one is of a lower capacity, therefore it is being used for traffic exchange with local Internet providers and as a backup link in the event of a primary link failure.\n\nApart from these connections, RCUB realises traffic exchange with certain local Internet providers (Internet peering), in order to enable AMRES users to have a more efficient communication with local Internet providers' users. In this way, following connections have been realised:\n\nSerbian Broad Band Communications (SBB) ‚Äì traffic exchange over 1 Gbps link, used with 30 Mbps,\n\nSerbian Post, Telegraph, and Telephone State Company (PTT) ‚Äì traffic exchange over 1 Mbps link,\n\nInternet Exchange on the Faculty of Electrical Engineering [4]: it is being used for traffic exchange with Eunet, AVCOM, VeratNet and YUBC Internet providers. The link has 1 Gbps capacity, while the effective traffic, approximately, has 20 Mbps flow.\n\nMathematical Gymnasium Belgrade administers main physics and IT laboratories for distance learning in Serbian schooling system and develops plans to distribute its lab-time and resources to other elementary and high schools throughout Serbia and region. This mission is supported by strong optical Internet links and grid networks of Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade, Computing Center of University of Belgrade (RCUB), Academic Network of Serbia (AMRES), and Scientific Computing Lab of the Institute of Physics Belgrade.\n\nMagazine Info Review Published 10 page article about ICT and IT infrastructure in Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade, in English and in Serbian Language,[76] sponsored by Siemens.\n\nHistory of school's IT Department\n\nThe first professor of programming in MGB was prof. dr Ljubomir Protiƒá, Doctor of Sciences in Mathematics, professor at University of Belgrade, Faculty of Mathematics, who started teaching programming subjects from school year 1968/69.; 33 years later, professor Protiƒá served as Principal of Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade (2001‚Äì2004).\n\nFrom 1969. prof dr Bo≈°ko Jovanoviƒá joined informatics division, teaching programming subjects. Prof. Jovanoviƒá is chief of chair of Department of Numerical mathematics and Its Applications at the Faculty of Mathematics, University of Belgrade.\n\nLater on, many University of Belgrade professors, primarily from Faculty of Mathematics, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, and Faculty of Physics, as well as from Belgrade Institute of Physics and from Vinƒça Institute of Nuclear Sciences, joined informatics teaching staff at Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade.\n\nSchool's IT club\n\nProgrammers club at Faculty of Electrical Engineering [5] was opened by the MG alumni in 1983, by MG alumnus Dejan Ristanoviƒá (graduated in 1981).[15] At the same time was opened Programmers club of Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade. Dejan Ristanoviƒá and MGB alumni founded and run \"PC Press\" publishing house.[77]\n\nAll of part-time ICT teachers and special ICT teachers are former MGB students.\n\nMore than 300 MG alumni, who worked for Microsoft in USA and Canada at the beginning of the new millennium, were the power behind the visit that Mr. Bill Gates paid to Serbia, when negotiating, with the then Serbian Prime Minister Zoran ƒêinƒëiƒá and Belgrade Mayor Nenad Bogdanoviƒá (himself alumnus of Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade)[15] the possibilities for the opening of the first (and only) Microsoft Development Center in Europe (not including UK).[78]\n\nMicrosoft Development Center Serbia, at the time the only Microsoft Development Center in Continental Europe (the other European Microsoft Development Centers being in United Kingdom, at the University of Cambridge, and in Ireland), is located in Belgrade. Its CEO is mr Dejan Cvetkoviƒá, MGB alumnus, graduated from Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade in 1985.[15]\n\nMGB alumni hold some of the key positions at IT world leading companies such as Oracle, Siemens, IBM, or Serbain and European brands Saga [6], Informatika [7], CET [8], or Comtrade.[9].[79] Comtrade is owned and managed by MGB Alumni.\n\nSports\n\nMathematical Gymnasium Belgrade is very proud of success its students achieved throughout the School's 45 years rich history. Trophies won and medals are numerous, and come from many different sport disciplines. The School won Belgrade Trophy in football several times, national high-school championship in basketball, its handball team also won numerous medals. The School have students who trained or train in clubs Red Star and Partizan, to name a few.[80]\n\nSchool regularly plays and goes to tournaments in volleyball, handball, basketball, and football.[80]\n\nThere is an active swimming section each generation have several divers among students.[80]\n\nStudents train in karate, taekwondo, judo, and aikido.[80]\n\nThere are active badminton and table tennis sections.[80]\n\nMountaineering, biking, and hiking, are the most popular outdoor activities. Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade pay special attention to students' needs in the field of sports and recreation and organizes camping trips, recreational gatherings, biking trips, self-defense seminars, and gymnastics days.[80]\n\nYachting was very popular during eighties and nineties, and the School had national team members who competed around the world.[80]\n\nGraduates and Alumni\n\nFrom about 8,000 graduates in the 40-year history of this school, more than 400 have obtained PhD degrees and 600 have obtained Magister of Science degrees. These numbers are to be taken with precautions since this is the number of only those who reported their PhD to MG authorities. It is widely believed that much greater number of MG graduates who hold PhDs from western countries never reported their status to MG authorities. MG statistics say the ratio is 1:5, meaning on every 1 alumni that obtains PhD title at Serbian universities there are 5 MG alumni who got their PhD in Western world, mostly at USA universities MIT, UC Berkeley, University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, Caltech, Cooper Union, and Ivy League universities Columbia, Harvard, Princeton, Brown, the UPenn, Yale, Cornell, and Dartmouth College, UK universities Oxbridge (the Oxford and the Cambridge), Imperial College London, UCL, and several other universities (mostly ETH Zurich, EPFL, Lomonosov Moscow State University, and Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel).\n\nMG alumni holds university positions around the globe,[81] but also managerial positions in prestigious world companies, since many of former MG graduates continue careers in business as Executive or Managing Directors of world banks[82] and hold various business diplomas from notable institutions such as Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, Kennedy School of Government and Politics at Harvard University (also known as Harvard Kennedy School and HKS), MIT Sloan School of Management, INSEAD, London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), Imperial College London, etc. MG Alumni is formally being established recently (in 2009) and started working in 2011, so data should become more accurate in future.\n\nMore than 99% of the MG graduates hold graduate university Diploma. Almost all of above mentioned 8,000 MG graduates hold at least M.Sc. in either Mathematics, Physics, or Engineering.[83]\n\nFormer students of Mathematical Gymnasium are usually employed in special divisions and prepare pupils for international competitions and for entering exams for prestigious universities around the world, usually in UK and USA. Rastko Marinkoviƒá, Vladimir Baltiƒá, Miljan Kne≈æeviƒá, Mladen Laudanoviƒá, Velibor Tintor, Vladimir Bo≈æin, Igor Devetak, Zlatko Filipoviƒá, Milo≈° Koja≈°eviƒá, Igor Salom, Predrag Milenoviƒá, ƒêorƒëe Krtiniƒá, are some of the former students that held lectures, guided pupils' graduate theses, mentored special divisions, or prepared competitions and held competition seminars. ƒêorƒëe Kriniƒá prepared and led 2010 Serbian Mathematics Olympiad Team, while Vesna Kadelburg, also a former student of Mathematical Gymnasium, led 2010 UK National Team, from her chair at University of Cambridge, where she obtained her PhD.\n\nEuropean Physical Society, in its Euro Physics News Magazine, published an article \"Inspiring Physics in Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade\"[84] about Physics teacher Nata≈°a ƒåalukoviƒá from Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade, and about results of Physics department of MGB. Authors, themselves distinguished physicists from University of Cambridge, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT and Institute of Physics Belgrade [10] and former students of Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade and of professor Nata≈°a ƒåalukoviƒá, claim professor ƒåalukoviƒá's students made 36 appearances at the International Physics Olympiads, and were honored two gold medals, nine silver and twelve bronze medals, as well as ten honorable mentions. Professor ƒåalukoviƒá was herself student of Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade (graduated 1974), before graduating from the Faculty of Physics, University of Belgrade; as a student of MGB, Nata≈°a's professor and mentor was prof. dr Milan Raspopoviƒá, one of the founders of MGB, a physics and philosophy professor, and the longest serving Director and Principal of Mathematical Gymnasium.\n\nFamous alumni also include athletes Slobodan Soro and Rajko Jokanoviƒá, chess player Alisa Mariƒá, former Minister of Telecommunications and Information Society in the Government of Serbia Aleksandra Smiljaniƒá, former Mayor of Belgrade Nenad Bogdanoviƒá...\n\nAcceptance to UK and USA universities\n\nMathematical Gymnasium Belgrade alumni are usually accepted to universities of their choice, because MGB Curriculum is more advanced and demanding in the fields of mathematics and natural sciences than usual curricula (such as IBO or various national baccalaureates) and MGB students usually have no problem in passing qualification exams and/or interviews.\n\nEach year 40‚Äì50% of graduates leaves Serbia, mostly for UK and USA universities.\n\nIn 2010, Trinity College of University of Cambridge, awarded 7 full scholarships to 7 pupils from a Special Division (grade 4 division D, or 4-d division) of Mathematical Gymnasium, namely to students Luka Miliƒáeviƒá, Du≈°an Milijanƒçeviƒá, Ognjen Ivkoviƒá, Nikola Mrk≈°iƒá, Mihajlo Cekiƒá, Aleksandar Vasiljkoviƒá and Du≈°an Peroviƒá.[85][86][87] Trinity College of University of Cambridge awards, in total, 11 full scholarships per year per non-UK citizens, and 2 full scholarships per world region. This is the first time in history of Cambridge that 7 full scholarships were granted not only to one division, not only to one school, not only to one city and not only to one state, but also the first time that this large number of scholarships was awarded to one world region (e.g. North America or Europe are two regions). The same year, a former pupil, Ivana Miloviƒá, was awarded a full scholarship from Trinity College, Cambridge for master studies in mathematics.[88] More pupils from MG were accepted to Cambridge, but there were no more full scholarships. Other students received scholarships from MIT and other UK and USA faculties and universities.[89][90][91]\n\nSome students win more than one full scholarship. Notable examples are 2010 graduates Du≈°an Milijanƒçeviƒá, who got full scholarships from University of Cambridge and from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT[92] and Nata≈°a Dragoviƒá, who got full scholarships from University of Oxford and from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT.[18]\n\nDiploma relative value\n\nMG graduate Diploma alone is treated as \"Associate Degree\" in named field, be it nuclear engineering, mathematics and IT, laser physics, or any other of 20 or so fields present in MG during its 40 years existence. However, due to old legal regulations in Serbia, graduates of MG are still obliged to start their university studies from year 1, even though many of university subjects are taught throughout MGB 6 years course (e.g. Mathematical Probability, Statistics, Mathematical Analysis, Numerical mathematics, Combinatorics, Number theory, Geometry, Linear Algebra, Analytical geometry, Algebra, various advanced physics topics such as Atomic Physics, Solid State Physics or Nuclear Physics, etc.).[93] When leaving abroad for studies, MG graduates usually graduate faster than their peers (e.g. Ranko Laziƒá left MGB after 2nd grade (out of 4) to enroll to University of Oxford He is now professor at University of Oxford and at University of Warwick).[94]\n\nCollaboration\n\nMametatiƒçka gimnazija collaborates with the highest ranking scientific institutions in Serbia and abroad. Collaboration is defined through various agreements on scientific, technical and educational cooperation. Students of Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade are partly educated at the following institutions:\n\nInstitution Mathematical Institute of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (MI SASA) [11][95][96] Institute of Physics ‚Äì Belgrade [12] Vinƒça Institute of Nuclear Sciences [13] University of Belgrade [14] Faculty of Mathematics [15] Faculty of Physics [16] Faculty of Electrical Engineering [17] Petnica Science Center [18] Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade Alumni, spread across world leading scientific and research institutions Business and policy makers, think tanks, and industry leaders IT and software companies, such as Microsoft, IBM, Oracle\n\nCooperation and financial support\n\nMathematical Gymnasium also have contracts with JAT Airways[35] (national air-traffic company), Telekom Srbija (Telecom Serbia, the largest telecom operator in former Yugoslavia and in modern Serbia),[35] Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts,[35] domestic and international scientific Institutes,[35] etc.\n\nMinistry of Science and Technology is one of a large scale investors in Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade. Its current Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, Mr. Bo≈æidar ƒêeliƒá, is a frequent guest in the School. This does not come as a surprise, since there are so many international competitions where MGB students regularly win medals.\n\nMr. ƒêeliƒá served 3 times as Minister of Finance and 2 times as Minister of Science and Technology. He also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, and Minister for European Union affairs. During all his mandates, Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade enjoyed financial and technical support of Ministries he led. During his visit to MGB Physics Lab 1, Mr. ƒêeliƒá said he sees MGB students and alumni as \"the best ambassadors of Serbia and of Serbian and world science\". He said he appreciates top achievements in education, since he himself won French national competitions for high-school students in history and economics in 1980 and 1981,[97] and was educated at the Institut d'√©tudes politiques de Paris and later √âcole des Hautes √âtudes Commerciales in Paris where he graduated as a top student. In 1987 he received a double master's degree in economics at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales. He eventually moved to the United States, where he completed an Master of Business Administration at the Harvard Business School, as well as a Master of Public Administration, specializing in macroeconomics and international relations, at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.[98] His mentors were Alain Gomez, the chairman of Thomson SA, who taught him how to be a manager, and the economist Jeffrey Sachs, who took him along from Harvard to Warsaw and Moscow.[99] Mr. ƒêeliƒá promised Ministry of Science and Technology will continue to invest in MGB and expressed his personal wish that alumni of Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade start returning to Belgrade and Serbia at least at the rate MGB graduates leave the country.\n\nEnrollment\n\nMathematical Gymnasium Belgrade has built a reputation as an elite school throughout its 45 years of existence, with significant world stage highlights at the end of 1980s and during the 1990s, which led to increased number of candidates applying every year. Eventually the number of applicants far outnumbered the number of available spaces. Paid classes were introduced in 1997 for students whose parents were willing and able to pay for their education. This practice has continued since, enabling the School to keep its high teaching standards through budget improvements. Basic fees are 10,000 euros per year.\n\nThe School currently has four high-school grades (nine to twelve, or high school grades one to four), and two elementary-school grades (seven and eight; elementary school starts from grade zero). Due to recent changes in general law governing all public schools and institutions, all high-school classes are now financed by the state.\n\nTo successfully enroll in the high school classes, candidates have to pass a special mathematics entrance exam, different from the state-wide high-school mathematics entrance exam. Candidates are ranked according to the total score that combines result achieved at special MGB entrance exam (maximum of 120 points) and performance from previous elementary-school grades (maximum of 60 points). Preference is given to outstanding achievers at competitions and recipients of national prizes during the previous years of their education.\n\nThe ranking process for candidates enrolling in the elementary school classes is similar, with mathematics entrance exam (max. 120 points), performance from the previous grades in school (max. 60 points), and awards from state competitions in mathematics, physics, chemistry, or informatics (120 points).\n\nState-controlled education in Serbia is free of charge, so there are no official enrollment fees, except the exam costs.\n\nDistinguished guests\n\nMathematical Gymnasium Belgrade has been visited by many distinguished guests. Among notable guests outside the world of mathematics, physics and informatics, were, during last 5 years only (i.e. after 2005), among many others:\n\nthen Serbian Prime Minister Zoran ƒêinƒëiƒá,\n\nSerbian President Boris Tadiƒá,\n\nthen Belgrade Mayor Nenad Bogdanoviƒá, himself alumnus of MGB,[15]\n\nthen Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Ko≈°tunica,\n\nPatriarch Pavle of Serbia ‚Äì 44th Patriarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church,\n\nPatriarch Irinej of Serbia ‚Äì 45th Patriarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church,[35][100][101]\n\nAlexander, Crown Prince of Yugoslavia,\n\nKatherine, Crown Princess of Yugoslavia,\n\nHer Excellency Dr. Kim Young-Hee, Ambassador of the Republic of Korea.\n\nOn Monday, 21 June 2010, Mr. Michael O'Sullivan, Director of the Cambridge Commonwealth Trust paid visit to Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade.[102] Mr. O'Sullivan's was greeted by the Principal of Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade, Mr Srdjan Ognjanovic, prof. dr Zoran Kadelburg who is a professor of Mathematical Analysis at Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade and full professor and former Dean of Faculty of Mathematics, University of Belgrade, and MGB students who will continue their education in Cambridge. This event was recorded by the Radio Television of Serbia.\n\nThe cause for Mr. O'Sullivan's visit was that in 2009 16 students of Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade were admitted to University of Cambridge. Two were female, and both received full scholarship from Trinity College,[103] while in 2010 15 students enrolled in Cambridge, 7 of whom received full scholarships from Trinity College. Policy of scholarship granting of Trinity College of University of Cambridge allows maximum of 2 full scholarships per world regions (such as North America, or Europe, or Africa, or Indochina, etc.), and Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade excellent score caused exceptions in Trinity's policy year by year, and made Mr. O'Sullivan pay a visit to MGB.\n\nLegal status\n\nThe School operates as a public school and acts as a member of Serbian education system, which is governed by the Ministry of Education.\n\nFormally a part of former Yugoslav and now Serbian state educational system (i.e. financed by the state), Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade had a status of \"experimental school\", which allowed it to operate autonomously since its foundation.\n\nIt has fundings independent from general high school fundings and is helped both by the state and by the University of Belgrade. University pay scale applies to all employees.\n\nMathematical Gymnasium Belgrade has the following legal statuses:\n\n\"Experimental school whose aim is to reinforce mathematical education for students which show a special gift for mathematics and natural sciences\", according to the decision of the Educational Council of SR Serbia (Decision no. 110-32/89 from 18 January 1989);\n\n\"School for talented students in the areas of mathematics and natural sciences\", according to the decision of the Ministry of Education of Serbia;\n\n\"School of special national interest\", according to the decision of the Government of the Republic of Serbia. (please see picture on the right)\n\nTeaching positions\n\nTeaching position in Mathematical Gymnasium comprises a timetable of 18 hours per week for \"ordinary professors\", and up to 12 hours of teaching for \"special professors\" (usually called \"special teachers\") in special divisions (usually university employed stuff, or institute researchers, former MG students from special divisions, many still studying at university level).\n\nThere is no institution of Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) in Serbia, other than university diploma in appropriate scientific field. Since MG curriculum is scientifically much more demanding than international curricula (such as International Baccalaureate), it is school's policy to appoint professors mostly from former MG graduates, themselves holders of various awards from domestic and international competitions.\n\nIn general, Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade appoints scientists from universities and institutes, and alumni of Mathematical Gymnasium with a proven track record in domestic and international competitions, with strong talent and passion for teaching, and with high pedagogical qualities. Thus, teaching staff of Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade includes several generations of School and university professors and their present day colleagues and former students, and former students' students, which brings unique spirit to the teaching and scientific community of the School. Many scientific puzzles are brought to students' attention as their professors tend to discuss scientific problems and ideas freely among themselves and students, mixing regular lessons with contemporary scientific ideas, puzzles, and projects they work on.\n\nMGB teachers usually collaborate on international scientific programs and, from time to time, publish specialized textbooks for use in Mathematical Gymnasium.\n\nMost of the textbooks in mathematics and ICT, and all of the textbooks in physics, used in elementary and high schools in Serbia, are written by professor of Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade.\n\nMGB students regularly win full scholarships from leading universities around the globe, and some of them later return to teach in Mathematical Gymnasium.\n\nTeaching staff\n\nMathematical Gymnasium usually employs former students of the School as \"special teachers\", many of whom are still students or graduate students, to work in special divisions (of which are most respected A- and world known D-divisions).\n\n\"Lead Teacher\", \"Head Teacher\", and Principal titles and responsibilities are held by professors (teachers) who are former MGB students. Teachers with higher rank are commonly referred as \"special teachers\", since they teach to special divisions. (Although all divisions of Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade are special divisions, A- and D- divisions are \"more special\" than others, thus have internally reserved the term \"special\" for themselves.)\n\nIn the current full time engaged school staff, 23 teachers hold Doctor of Sciences degrees, 17 either PhD, Magister of Science, or Ma degrees, and all the rest hold graduated or M.Sc. degrees; other PhD and M.Sc. degree holders, University professors and assistants, or Institute assistant researchers, usually teach in special divisions.\n\nThe department od Mathematics has 33 full-time professors, of which 15 teachers hold Doctor of Sciences degrees, 8 hold PhD or Magister of Science, 1 holds Ma, 1 holds Master of Science degree, and 8 are postgraduate students. 22 of the mentioned 33 full-time professors of Mathematics are former students of Mathematical Gymnasium.[104][105]\n\nExperimental teaching methods and programs prevail in the School. Many classes are taught by University of Belgrade professors and research assistants from the Faculty of Mathematics, Faculty of Physics, Belgrade Institute of Physics ‚Äì Zemun [19], Institute for Nuclear Sciences Vinƒça, and Faculty of Electrical Engineering, and teaching methods vary according to professors' styles.\n\nMathematical Gymnasium Belgrade students set demands of high standard in front of the professors, and vice versa. One in every 10‚Äì15 students enroll in two different faculties and study both (in parallel). The School is very supportive and help both its former students and its employees to balance such activities, if and when they occur. It is not unusual to have professors who graduated two faculties, even three. The most usual choices are combination of electrical engineering, technical faculties (technology), mathematics, physics, and informatics. Some examples include economy, finance, and business studies, and even philosophy and languages.\n\nThe School welcomes broad knowledge, and supports activities that lead towards new knowledge and expertise.\n\nAverage experience of teaching staff\n\nThe average teaching experience of professors in Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade is 18 years.[5]\n\nExperience (in years) Number of professors x ‚â§10 33 10 ‚â§ x < 20 24 20 ‚â§ x < 30 17 30 < x 26 average 18\n\nThe rest are teachers from university and institutes with similar age / work experience distribution.\n\nBuilding and facilities\n\nMathematical Gymnasium's main building has 2,144.98 m2 area, not including basement labs.\n\nIt has 11 specialized cabinets (5 for informatics related subjects, 2 for physics, 1 for mathematics, 1 for chemistry, 1 for biology, 1 for foreign languages), 1 server room with equipment for administration of over 100 LAN and WLAN stations in the School, 13 large classrooms, 3 smaller and isolated classrooms for mentor teaching and competition preparation, Assembly Hall, Ceremonial Hall, library with over 10,000 books and textbooks, mediatheque, basement laboratories, cabinets for teaching staff, administrative staff, cleaning staff, secretary cabinet, accounting department, copy center, psychologist office, Vice Principal Office, and Principal Office.[106]\n\nSchool's Gym Hall has a base area of 638,56 m2.\n\nSchool has additional handball court and basketball court in the open.\n\nLocation and security\n\nMathematical Gymnasium Belgrade is located in Kraljice Natalije Street 37 (formerly Narodnog Fronta 37),[107] in the very centre of the city of Belgrade, the capital of Serbia and of former Kingdom of Yugoslavia and former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, neighboring National Assembly Building, Presidential Palace, City Hall and Mayor's Office. It is surrounded by Government of Serbia official buildings, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Russian Center. USA Embassy is located nearby.\n\nProperties of Mathematical Gymnasium are constantly guarded by private security and by state police officers and are also monitored by 37 cameras.\n\nCelebration of 40 years of work\n\nOn Tuesday, 19 September 2006, Mathematical Gymnasium celebrated 40 years of successful work. The ceremony was held at the National Theatre in Belgrade. Around 500 prominent guests attended the celebration. The reception was attended by the then Prime Minister of the Republic of Serbia, dr sci Vojislav Kostunica, who was the senior sponsor of this anniversary. The meeting was also attended by the former Mayor of Belgrade, Mr. Nenad Bogdanoviƒá ‚Äì himself being a former student of MGB, the Minister of Education, Mr. Slobodan Vuksanoviƒá, City Secretary of Education, Mr. Vladimir Todiƒá, the President of the Stari Grad municipality, Mrs. Mirjana Bo≈æidareviƒá, rector of the University of Belgrade, dean of Faculty of Mathematics, dean of Faculty of Physics, dean of Faculty of Electrical Engineering, professors and associates of the Vinƒça Institute for Nuclear Sciences, Institute of Physics Belgrade, Mathematics Institute of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, former students and now renowned professors and scientists from all around the world, the business elite of the region, Serbian famous actors and movie directors, as well as other prominent guests.\n\nOn the occasion of this important anniversary, the Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade also prepared a monograph of the School, issued with assistance from the Institute for textbooks and teaching aids ‚Äì Zavod [20].\n\nReferences\n\nOfficial website\n\nMG Principal's web page\n\nVideo clips of the 40-years ceremony held at the National Theatre, 2006\n\nSpeech of the then Principal of Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade, Vladimir Dragovic, PhD: [21]\n\nSpeech of Prime Minister, Vojislav Kostunica, PhD: [22]\n\nSpeech of the Mayor of Belgrade, Nenad Bogdanoviƒá, MSc: [23]\n\nSpeech of Minister Bo≈æidar ƒêeliƒá, MA: [24]\n\nVideo clips of the 42-years ceremony held at the Belgrade City Hall, 2008"
