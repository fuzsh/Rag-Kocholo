Cells in Nissl-stained sections from ADX rats were counted and compared with those in sections from sham-operated rats. The ADX rats had a significantly reduced number of dentate granule cells. A novel finding was a significant reduction in the number of pyramidal cells in CA1, CA2, CA3 and CA4 regions of tne hippocampus. Thus long-term adrenalectomy causes loss of dentate granule cells and pyramidal neurones of the hippocampus.\n\nTY - JOUR\n\nT1 - Loss of neurones after long-term adrenalectomy in the adult rat hippocampal formation\n\nAU - Adem, Abdu\n\nAU - Islam, Atiqul\n\nAU - Bogdanovic, Nenad\n\nAU - Carlstrom, Kjell\n\nAU - Winblad, Bengt\n\nPY - 1994/11\n\nY1 - 1994/11\n\nN2 - The effects of long-term adrenalectomy (ADX) on hippocampal neurones were investigated 5 months after surgery in male Sprague-Dawley rats.
