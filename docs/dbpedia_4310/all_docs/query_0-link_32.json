        "text": "Long sword, spatha was discovered as chance find in the area of the village Ratari near Obrenovac. Location where the spatha was found is at the bank of former Velika Bara, an old arm of the Sava River. It is assumed that the road, which in the Roman times was running along the right bank of the Sava from Sirmium via Spodent (…) to Singidunum, was about one kilometer to the north of the spot where the spatha was found. On the spatha there are marks stamped on both sides of the blade. Stamp EX B NAISS probably marks the place of manufacture also being the confirmation of more than hundred years old assumption about the existence of fabrica armorum in Naissus. Existence of fabrica armorum has not been ascertained so far neither archaeologically nor epigraphically, so the stamp on this spatha is first genuine confirmation of such activities besides mentioning of the workshop of unspecified character in the Notitia Dignitatum. In addition, that inscription on the stamp on the spatha provides important information about the organization of activities in the imperial workshops. Mark B on the stamp indicates that spatha was made in second officina of the section for weaponry production in Naissus. Stamp IOVIANA on the other side of the blade denotes by all appearances the army unit for which it had been forged. Use of the formulation Ioviana has not been registered so far on the epigraphic monuments and in literary sources. It remains an open question whether Ioviana relates to legio V Ioviana (as alteration of the name Iovia) or to some unit from the corpus numero Iovianorum. There is an assumption suggested that removing the spatha from use could be associated with the Licinius’ flight after the battle of Cibalae in 316 as he was retreating from Sirmium via Spodent towards Singidunum along the route to the south of the Sava river. Morphological traits date the spatha to the 3rd century and stamps on it suggest the very end of the 3rd century or the beginning of the 4th century. Possible connecting of its use for a single specific event (flight of Licinius) looks tempting, but such assumption should be taken with considerable reservation. Most important values provided by the chance find of this spatha could be considered the unique data obtained by the stamps on its blade about military unit for which it had been produced and about the activity of fabrica armorum in Naissus.\n\nThe archaeological finds with diverse scenes ascribed to the Roman games (ludi, circenses, munera) are important as possible indicators of acceptance of the Roman way of life and customs but also as evidence of the character, organization and duration of games in the Roman provinces within the borders of modern Serbia. The investigations of distinct public buildings intended for gladiator combats or circus competitions like amphitheater in Viminacium and Late Roman hippodrome in Sremska Mitrovica (Sirmium) confirm that games had been organized there in the Roman times. Besides occasional and late mentions, the historical and epigraphic sources mostly remain silent about gladiator combats and circus races in the Roman provinces in this region, so every trace, which shed more light on this important and very interesting subject, is rather significant. The summary of heterogeneous finds from the territory of Serbia with representations from amphitheaters and circuses undoubtly indicates that the games had been organized in this region. More frequent appearance of merchandise with such representations in Moesia Superior starts from the 2nd century and continues in the 3rd century. The import of vessels from the workshops at Rheinzabern, Westendorf, Pfaffenhofen and Trier was most intensive after the Marcomannic wars and continued in the second half of the 3rd century. The period of the 2nd and 3rd century was the time of intensive social and first of all economic progress in the Roman provinces in the territory of modern Serbia. It was the time of rapid development of economy (mining, agriculture, trade, and craftsmanship), urban centers and immigration of the Romanized population. The examples from the neighboring Roman Thrace reveal that first gladiator combats and hunting performances (venations) in this area have been taking place already in the mid 2nd century and that construction of permanent amphitheaters was more frequent from the time of Severi until the beginning of Diocletian’s reign. More frequent organizing of games could be expected in the territory of present-day Serbia during that period as it is confirmed in Viminacium. The organizers of these bloodthirsty performances could have been high-ranking officials and priests of imperial cult and gladiators were mostly of Hellenic origin, either from Greece or Asia Minor. The unreliable information from the historical sources and absence of epigraphic monuments mentioning the games, their patrons and particularly lack of funerary monuments of gladiators or other game participants in the territory of Serbia makes impossible for the time being studying in detail this interesting subject. We hope that there soon will be more possibilities for research based on archaeological excavations, detailed anthropological analyses or the revisions of the museum collections.\n\nThe process of Christianization in the middle Danube region started somewhat later than in the southern part of the Balkans, where it began in the 1st century AD. Some of the earliest data about Early Christians come from the time of Diocletian (284–305), who persecuted them ferociously and systematically, especially the priests and the Roman soldiers deployed in the middle Danube region who opposed to the pagan customs endorsed by the Emperor. The archaeological remains of ecclesiastical architecture from the period of Early Christianity are not numerous. There are no reliable data about the early churches in Singidunum and Viminacium, since these two metropolises are still insufficiently researched. Thanks to the rescue research carried out prior to the construction of Iron Gate I and II hydropower plants, we now know more about the intensity of church building and the way these structures looked. The excavations unearthed the remains of churches’ foundations in Čezava fort (Novae), in Donji Milanovac (Taliata), Boljetin (Smorna) and Vajuga-Karaula. These are single-naved structures with a smaller nartex, an entrance on the west side and one or two annexes, most often on the south side. In the church in Taliata, in the altar area, there was subselium, whereas in Novae and Smorna there were baptisterium. These churches were erected during the reign of Justinian I (527–565), likely during his renewal of the Limes in the 40s of the 6th century, but were demolished around the end of that same century, in the onrush of the Avars and Slavs.\n\nThe Antique Naissus, today’s city of Niš (SRB), flourished in the fertile valley of the river Nišava, in central parts of Moesia Superior. The settlement of the local people obtained the status of municipium in the 2nd century. Naissus played an important role from the period of barracks emperors in the 3rd century and in the Late Antiquity. In 269, Claudius II, who was born near-by and who knew the terrain very well, won a very important battle against the Goths in the vicinity of the city, thus gaining his nickname Gothicus. The Emperor Constantine I (306–337), born and raised at Naissus, “magnificently decorated” his home town. Sources note that Constantius III, a renowned general who ruled for a short span of time in 421, was also born in this city. Naissus was horribly afflicted by the raids of the Huns in 440s, as reported by Priscus, who passed through the city in 448, writing down moving details on the drastic decrease of the number of inhabitants and the declining toils of organizations in charge of treating the sick and burying the deceased from the city. In the Late Antiquity period, a state workshop (officina) was active in the city, producing objects made of noble metals, and it gathered the best craftsmen from various parts of the Empire; also, a document called Notitia dignitatum mentions a manufactory which produced items for the needs of the Roman army. In the 6th century, during Justinian’s Restoration of the Empire, 40 fortifications were restored or built anew at Naissus and its’ vicinity, which shows the economic and military importance of the city and its’ territory.\n\nThis paper is dedicated to the find uncovered in a Roman well identified as a grave (G1 295) from the locality Pećine at Viminacium (Serbia). The object is made of animal bone and has a cylindrical body with a V shaped notch carved on the back end. The body continues in the form of a narrow and long pin with circular cross-section. The object was originally published as a tuning peg (key) for string instrument (lyre), however, the author concludes that it actually represents a piece of archery equipment, that is, a nock that was once implanted on the back of the arrow shaft made of reed. Based on the stratigraphy and other finds from the same layer, the bone nock from Viminacium, up to date the only such find in Serbia, is dated in the beginning of the 3rd century AD."
