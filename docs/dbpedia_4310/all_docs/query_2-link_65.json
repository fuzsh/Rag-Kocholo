        "text": "Data and Methods\n\nData from Basketball Reference. The four advanced stats used to create a playerâs rating were VORP, Win Shares, RAPTOR WAR, and Wins Added. No all-in-one advanced stat is perfect, so I chose a blend that satisfied the eye test (see table below). Each stat was normalized then averaged together to create a master scale of a playerâs rating from 0 to 100. Ratings were based on a playerâs top five seasons to find the balance between prime and longevity (an average NBA career is 4.5 years).\n\nOnly showing draft classes through 2017 because they have at least five years of data. Upgrade choices in the Could Have Been teams were first selected from top 10 picks, then searched beyond those if there werenât enough to fill the top five. Draft trades were ignored since swaps usually are contingent on player availability and often include multiple players or money.\n\nReport card grades for draft picks were calculated as follows: a playerâs potential was the difference between their rating (from above) and the best player available in that draft at their pick. If they were the best player available (i.e., a potential of 0), they got an A+. The remaining grades were evenly distributed, with a uniform number of players receiving each grade value."
