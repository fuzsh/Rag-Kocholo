He currently plays for FC Krylia Sovetov Samara in the Russian Premier League.\n\nHe is famous for his free kicks, from which he scored many times in his career.\n\nContents\n\n1 Club career\n\n2 International career\n\n2.1 International goals\n\n3 Career statistics\n\n3.1 Club\n\n3.2 International\n\n4 References\n\n5 External links\n\nClub career\n\nĐorđević played for FK Obilić from 1999 to 2003. He played 97 league games and became one of the best defenders in the \"Vitezovi\" line up, before he signed for FK Partizan. From then on, Đorđević was very important and standard player of the team. He played in the 2003–04 UEFA Champions League under coach Lothar Matthäus and the 2004–05 UEFA Cup under coach Vladimir Vermezović, and also made 85 appearances in the national championship.\n\nIn February 2007, Đorđević signed for JEF United Ichihara Chiba,[1] and played there in the 2007 season.\n\nAfter just one year, he returned to FK Partizan and signed a two and a half year contract with his former club, on 29 January 2008.[2] Đorđević played great after his return, especially in the first six months, when his goals directly decide the winner in a few games, and so was one of the most deserving for Partizan's title in the 2007–08 season, the club's first after three years.\n\nOn 8 April 2010, Đorđević signed a two-year contract with Russian Premier League side FC Krylia Sovetov Samara.[3] Only two days later, on 10 April 2010, he scored on his debut in a match against FC Saturn, which his club won 2–1.[4]\n\nInternational career\n\nĐorđević was capped 17 times for the Serbia and Montenegro national team, scoring 1 goal. He was also a member of the Serbia and Montenegro squad at the 2006 FIFA World Cup.\n\nInternational goals\n\n# Date Venue Opponent Score Result Competition 1. 13 November 2005 Wutaishan Stadium, Nanjing China PR 1–0 2–0 Friendly\n\nCareer statistics\n\nAs of 30 November 2010\n\nClub\n\nClub Season League Cup Continental Total Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Obilić 1999–00 14 0 0 0 14 0 2000–01 23 0 2 0 25 0 2001–02 27 0 2 0 4 0 33 0 2002–03 33 3 3 2 2 0 38 5 Total 97 3 5 2 8 0 110 5 Partizan 2003–04 25 2 3 1 9 0 37 3 2004–05 27 2 3 0 12 0 42 2 2005–06 20 1 2 0 4 0 26 1 2006–07 13 2 0 0 8 0 21 2 Total 85 7 8 1 33 0 126 8 JEF United 2007 13 3 0 0 13 3 Total 13 3 0 0 13 3 Partizan 2007–08 14 6 3 0 0 0 17 6 2008–09 22 1 4 1 8 0 34 2 2009–10 14 0 2 0 11 2 27 2 Total 50 7 9 1 19 2 78 10 Krylia Sovetov 2010 24 3 0 0 0 0 24 3 Total 24 3 0 0 0 0 24 3 Career total 269 23 22 4 60 2 351 29\n\nInternational\n\nNational team Year Apps Goals FR Yugoslavia 2002 2 0 Serbia and Montenegro 2003 6 0 2004 3 0 2005 3 1 2006 3 0 Total 17 1\n\nReferences\n\nNenad Đorđević at rfpl.org\n\nNenad Đorđević at reprezentacija.rs\n\nSporting positions Preceded by\n\nStevan Jovetić Partizan captain\n\n2008–2010 Succeeded by\n\nMladen Krstajić"
