By organizing this international meeting, as hosts, we above all wanted to contribute to strengthening the existing ties among researchers involved with Balkan musics and to facilitate new professional contacts. Our intent was to create an opportunity for reassessment and improvement of each of our own shares in ethnomusicology, to contribute to the advancement of research by discussing various research strategies recently applied to Balkan musical practices, and to participate in the more efficient inclusion of ‘small’ disciplinary communities in the global ethnomusicologies by highlighting specific values and problems of ‘national ethnomusicologies’ in the Balkans. These, so to speak, general needs, were reinforced in circumstances of the growth of the ethnomusicology in Serbia, particularly in recent decades. The interests in traditional folk music expressed through writings, notation, and recording of the same, followed by the first research studies by educated musicians—mainly composers, became institutionalized in Serbia (only) in 1948 with foundation of the Institute of musicology of Serbian academy of sciences (today Serbian academy of sciences and arts—SASA). Since its beginning, SASA has been a state institution, with its work regimen determined by the government culture and science politics and the scope of research output administered by a small number of researchers. The increase in number of ethnomusicologists employed by the Institute1 resulted in an initiative to celebrate the SASA 170th anniversary by organizing an ethnomusicology conference, in the footsteps of a number of similar professional meetings coordinated by the Institute’s musicologists. This was at the same time the first narrowly specialized ethnomusicology symposium in Serbia, and consequently, in front of you is the first proceedings of such profile published in our country.2 The substantial support received from the SASA Department of fine arts and music and the acknowledgement of the significance of such a meeting by the Ministry 1\n\nToday, the Institute employs four ethnomusicologists, a number which could be considered abundant compared to the equalling total number of ethnomusicologists employed full-time at this institution between 1948–2010 (without external associates). These data appear relevant for perceiving opportunities and possibilities for research production of ‘small ethnomusicologies’, as more elaborated in the Introduction to this volume. 2 International symposium Man and Music, dedicated to the 75th birthday and 50th work anniversary of the esteemed Serbian ethnomusicologist, prof. dr Dragoslav Dević, was organized in 2001 by the Belgrade Faculty of music, Department for musicology and ethnomusicology. The symposium topics were accommodated for participation of both musicologists and ethnomusicologists, as evident in the subsequent book of proceedings (published 2003).\n\nof education and science of the Republic of Serbia, including funding the event organization, were essential and indispensable prerequisites for the Symposium realization and publication of this book. As is usually the case, the extent of financial support and particularly deadlines, imposed limits on some of our ideas and professional desires. We are deeply grateful to our esteemed colleagues, members of the Symposium Program committee: Izaly Zemtsovsky, Jim Samson, Martin Stokes, Lozanka Peycheva, and Pál Richter. The Symposium immediate logistics duties were helpfully shared primarily with our colleagues, the Institute ethnomusicologists, Rastko Jakovljević and Marija Dumnić. It was our satisfaction to have the opportunity to gather twenty-six ethnomusicologists from eleven countries: Bulgaria, Great Britain, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, Macedonia, Russia, Slovenia, Turkey, Australia, and Serbia. We regret that due to objective circumstances, some of the Balkans researchers from other regions, whose experiences would unquestionably contribute to the quality of the Symposium and these proceedings, could not take part. The vast majority of the Symposium participants prepared their papers for publication. The readers are offered twenty-one studies that in different ways illuminate Balkan musical practices and testify to the breadth of current research interests and methodologies. The publication also includes a compact disc with useful audio and video examples, assembled with the idea to provide the reader with even more complete insight into the researched music and utilized approaches. In order to address a wider audience, the proceedings are published in English. Since the contributing authors could optionally submit an additional version of the paper in their native language, those versions are also provided on the compact disc. Editing of this extensive and comprehensive publication presented a unique experience. We would like to thank all of the authors for submitting their papers and for their cooperation. We also extend our sincere gratitude to our reviewers. In this voluminous undertaking, we enjoyed the support of our colleagues at the Institute, but in particular, the encouragement from Melita Milin who offered a number of valuable suggestions. We truly appreciate the cooperation of Jelena Simonović Schiff (Portland State University, USA) in proof reading papers in English, Zoran Jerković in mastering of audio examples, Miloš Rašić in preparing of video examples, and Goran Janjić in technical preparation for print that exceeded standard duties and helped shape this publication. Editors Belgrade, November 2012\n\nРЕЧ УРЕДНИКА Ова књига садржи студије настале на основу излагања на међународном скупу Музичке праксе Балкана: етномузиколошке перспективе, одржаном новембра 2011. године у Београду. Организовањем скупа желели смо, пре свега, да као домаћини међународног скупа допринесемо учвршћивању постојећих контаката међу истраживачима који се баве музикама Балкана, као и да пружимо могућност за нова професионална познанства. У проблемском смислу, намера нам је била да створимо прилику за преиспитивање и унапређивање сопствених учешћа у етномузикологији, да дискутовањем о различитим истраживачким стратегијама примењиваним на балканске музичке праксе у новије време допринесемо унапређењу њихових истраживања, као и да скретањем пажње на специфичне проблеме, али и вредности етномузикологије, односно „националних етномузикологија“ на Балкану учествујемо у ефикаснијем укључивању „малих“ дисциплинарних заједница у светско етномузиколошко друштво. Овакве, у извесном смислу опште потребе, потенциране су околностима развоја етномузикологије у Србији, посебно последњих деценија. Интересовања за традиционалну народну музику изражена кроз записе о њој, њено нотирање и снимање, а потом и прве студије образованих музичара, махом композитора, у Србији су (тек) 1948. добили институционално окриље оснивањем Музиколошког института Српске академије наука (данас Српске академије наука и уметности – САНУ). Од оснивања до данас то је државна установа, те је начин рада условљен државним културним и научним политикама, а обим научне продукције кључно је одређивао увек мали број истраживача. Повећање броја етномузиколога запослених у Институту1 резултирало је иницијативом да се у оквиру обележавања 170 година постојања САНУ, након већег броја скупова које су организовали музиколози из Института, приреди међународни етномузиколошки скуп. То је, уједно, био и први специјализовани етномузиколошки симпозијум у Србији, а сходно томе, ово је први зборник таквог профила објављен у нашој земљи.2 Комплексна подршка коју смо добили од САНУ – 1\n\nДанас у Институту раде четири етномузиколога, што је мноштво ако се има у виду да тај број одговара укупном броју етномузиколога који су у периоду 1948–2010. били стално запослени у овој институцији (не рачунајући спољне сараднике). Ове податке истичемо као значајну референцу за сагледавања могућности, односно научних продукција „малих етномузикологија“, о чему ће више бити речи у уводној студији. 2 Међународни симпозијум Човек и музика, посвећен обележавању 75-огодишњице рођења и 50-огодишњице рада др Драгослава Девића, знаменитог српског етномузиколога, организовала је 2001. Катедра за музикологију и етномузикологију Факултета музичке уметности у Београду, те су теме омогућавале учешће и етномузиколога и музиколога, о чему сведочи истоимени зборник (публикован 2003).\n\nОдељења ликовне и музичке уметности, као и признавање важности оваквог скупа од стране Министарства просвете и науке Републике Србије, што је подразумевало финансијску помоћ организацији, били су неопходни предуслови и за саму реализацију скупа, и за објављивање овог зборника. Као и увек, обим помоћи, а посебно рокови, били су лимитирајући фактори нашим идејама и професионалним жељама. Изражавамо нарочиту захвалност уваженим колегама који су били у саставу Програмског одбора скупа: Изаљију Земцовском, Џиму Самсону, Мартину Стоуксу, Лозанки Пејчевој и Палу Рихтеру. Непосредне задатке из домена организације скупа делили смо првенствено са колегама-етномузиколозима из Института, Растком Јаковљевићем и Маријом Думнић. Велико нам је задовољство што смо имали прилику да окупимо 26 етномузиколога из 11 земаља: Бугарске, Велике Британије, Грчке, Литваније, Мађарске, Македоније, Русије, Словеније, Турске, Аустралије и Србије. Жао нам је што, због објективних околности, на скупу нису могли да узму учешћа неки од истраживача музика Балкана са других подручја, чија би искуства несумњиво допринела квалитету симпозијума и зборника. Велика већина учесника скупа је приредила своја излагања за публиковање. Сада се пред читаоцима налази двадесет једна студија која на различите начине осветљава музичке праксе Балкана, сведочећи о ширини актуелних истраживачких интересовања и методологија. Издање укључује и вредне аудио и видео примере на приложеном диску, чиме читаоцима омогућавамо потпунији увид у истраживану музику и научне приступе. Обраћајући се ширем кругу читалаца, зборник је публикован на енглеском језику, али је ауторима остављена могућност да своје радове приложе и на матерњим језицима, па су ове верзије такође приложене на диску. Уређивање овог обимног и комплексног зборника је било посебно искуство. Захваљујемо се свим ауторима за прилоге и сарадњу. Посебну захвалност дугујемо рецензентима студија. У овом обимном послу подршку смо имали од читавог колектива Музиколошког института, а нарочито од колегинице др Мелите Милин, која је имала мноштво драгоцених сугестија. Ангажовање др Јелене Симоновић-Schiff (Државни универзитет Портланда, САД) око лекторисања текстова на енглеском језику, Зорана Јерковића у припреми звучних примера, Милоша Рашића у обради видеопримера и Горана Јањића на техничкој припреми издања, далеко је превазишло базичне задатке, због чега смо им велики дужници.

These experiences emanate primarily from the local researchers’ works on music of the Balkans, with a heightened theoretical and methodological dimension. The distinctive Balkan musical practices, created through the amalgamation of elements from different cultures, ethnicities, and religions, made this geo-cultural space intriguing not only to researchers from this very region but also to those from other cultural communities. A theoretical framework for interpreting these practices together with the contemporary research methods stem from interactions of local scientific communities’ experiences, sources and practices they deal with, circumstances, ideologies and politics, including the influences of the world’s dominant ethnomusicological communities as well as researchers’ individual affinities and choices. A comparison with the research strategies applied in similar, transitory geo-cultural spaces contributes to a more complex exploration of the Balkan ethnomusicologists’ experiences. Keywords: the musics of the Balkans, methodologies in ethnomusicology, Balkan national ethnomusicologies, fieldwork, interdisciplinarity.\n\nBalkan musical practices, as sound images of a geo-cultural space whose distinct identity has been recognized both ‘inside’ and ‘outside’ are incorporated in the perpetual fascination and inspiration of the folklore researchers and ethnomusicologists. The recognizability that the region has acquired (not only) in ethnomusicology under the term the Balkans,1 along with the motivation of the Balkan scientists to look into its ontology rather than its metaphoric meanings \n\nThis study appears as an outcome of a research project Identities of Serbian music from a local to global framework: traditions, transitions, challenges, no. 177004, of the Institute of Musicology SASA, financed by the Republic of Serbia Ministry of education, science, and technological development. 1 Here are just a few, latest editions: Laušević 2007, Bohlman and Petković 2011, the title of the panel session which draw a substantial attention at the 39th world conference of the ICTM held in 2006, History and perspectives of national ethnomusicologies and ethnochoreologies in the Balkans and the title of the international symposium The Balkan Peninsula as a musical crossroad held in Macedonia in 2007, when the symposium participants initiated the formation of a regional study group within ICTM.\n\n14\n\nDanka Lajić-Mihajlović, Jelena Jovanović\n\n(more in Todorova 2006: 12), are reasons why on this occasion this term was given priority over the term Southeastern Europe. The history of ethnomusicology in the Balkan countries was significantly and possibly primarily marked by characteristics of musical heritage. For a very long period of time, this region was under the influence of several great civilizations, which is why the stratigraphies of national cultural histories, including musical traditions and even the forms of scientific attention devoted to them, have so many similarities. The different combinations and levels of present traces of the region’s early cultures however (‘proto-Balkan’, antiquity, Mediterranean), Slavic, Byzantine, Ottoman, and Central European – Austro-Hungarian components, make the Balkan musical traditions locally distinctive. Hence the ethnomusicological research in each of the Balkan countries was distinctively oriented in a thematic sense: music analysis (principles of form building, types of polyphony, tonal structures, and metric and rhythmic qualities), as well as instruments, their ergologic and sonic features, were interpreted with regard to the results of research in archeology, paleology and/or genealogy of languages as indicators of belonging to specific cultural layers (Rihtman 1955; Симоновски 1959; Bezić 1974; Petrović 1974; Девић 1996; Миљковић 1998; Вълчинова-Чендлова 2000; Dević 2001; Rakočević 2003). In addition, the conceptualization of ethnomusicological activities substantially depended on cultural and scientific policies, strategies for utilization of folk music in strengthening national identity (and these strategies were undergoing changes as the state borders and boundaries between the spheres of political influence were changing), and influences of the prominent ethnomusicological ‘schools’. In terms of methodology, the vibrant folklore practice primarily encouraged folklore-collecting activities, transcribing and recording, and later on analysis, classifications and comparisons, as strategies incorporated in the history of practically all Balkan ethnomusicologies. Nowadays, theoretical and methodological approaches also directly reflect the situation in practice. For example, the socialist era in Bulgaria saw the ‘professionalization’ of amateur folk musicians and formation of ‘folklore philharmonic orchestras’ (more in Buchanan 2006), while in Serbia industrially-produced instruments were given priority, above all the accordion (even though ethnomusicological research suggested the possibility and necessity of including traditional folklore instruments in the national television and radio orchestras, more on this in Vukosavljević 1979: 5). This led to a situation in which the focus of the similar folk instruments contemporary research significantly differs from one country to another (Rice 1994; Buchanan 2006; Atanasov 2002; Лајић-Михајловић 2011; Jakovljević 2012). The ‘openness’ of the national scientific policies in the Balkans had a great impact on theoretic considerations, while the level of interactions with other countries’ ethnomusicologists was measured indirectly through works, and especially directly, by participating in the symposiums and study visits\n\nINTRODUCTION: MUSIC AND ETHNOMUSICOLOGY...\n\n15\n\nabroad. The spheres of political influence, especially evident after World War II, were also present in the field of ethnomusicology. Having worked in the country which belonged to The Non-aligned movement, ethnomusicologists from Yugoslavia had an opportunity to closely cooperate with colleagues from countries belonging to the Eastern Bloc as well as with the ethnomusicological communities from Central and Western Europe and the United States of America, which was considered a privilege in research circles back then. This is verified by the existence of numerous publications in Russian, Ukrainian, Bulgarian, German, and English from that period, found in the institutional libraries and bibliographic references in studies of the time. Awareness of the importance of constructive dialogue between experts resulted in formation of the Union of associations of Yugoslav folklorists, under which umbrella an extensive cooperation among researchers and experts from various humanistic sciences was organized throughout the second half of the twentieth century (1951–1990), while the annual congresses served as opportunities for colleagues from the region (Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria) and some farther (Czechoslovakia, Poland, USSR, Germany, and Denmark) as well as non-European countries (USA and Japan) to present their works. The works of the most prominent ethnomusicologists of the time from Serbia (D. Dević – more in Vukičević-Zakić 2003, Radinović 2003; and R. Petrović – see www.music.sanu.ac.rs), Croatia (V. Žganec, Ј. Bezić – more in Ceribašić and Marošević 1999; Starčević-Štambuk 1999), Bosnia and Herzegovina (C. Rihtman – more in Rihtman-Šotrić 1986), and Slovenia (Z. Kumer – Golež-Kaučič 2010), speak about numerous theoretical and methodological influences they absorbed during their professional development. The turbulent historical and political events that took place in the late twentieth century and which, among other things, resulted in the break up of Yugoslavia, caused the cessation of the formal exchange of publications, while a priority was given to the use of English in all forms of communication at the local level2, over the advantage of being able to communicate in mother tongues as far as the Slavic part of the Balkan research community was concerned. The mutual recognition and rapprochement based on common interests in musical phenomena and specific ethnomusicological issues present in the region that occurred at the international symposiums in 2006 and 2007 led to the reorganization of cooperation at this level through the formation of an ICTM Study group on music and dance in Southeastern Europe (ICTM 2012), while numerous international symposiums held in the Balkans in recent years and/or musical practices applied in the region were initiated for the same reasons. Almost by default, scarce resources allocated for organization of such events do not cover the 2\n\nThe problems of languages of interdisciplinary/intradisciplinary communication have been lately addressed several times from different perspectives (Burckhardt Qureshi 1999: 317; Rice 2006; Peycheva and Dimov 2008: 46).\n\n16\n\nDanka Lajić-Mihajlović, Jelena Jovanović\n\ncosts of interpretation services and thus fail to ensure the respect of right to communicate in mother tongue, and therefore English is used as a lingua franca. The researchers from other scientific communities dealing with the music from this region greatly influenced the Balkan ethnomusicologies. Since the time when they, owing to technological advantages, made first recordings (by Bartok, see Dille 1970), performed specific analyses (Wünsch 1938), and pointed out some principles of re-creation in oral traditions (Parry and Lord 1953, Lord 1990), up to the modern research involving participative approach, their presence has left an indelible mark on both the studied cultures and local scientific communities. These developments have opened a number of ethical issues; however, beyond any doubt, they in general have led to some improvements in national ethnomusicologies and certainly promoted Balkan musical cultures. Additionally, the above mentioned practice of the Balkan ethnomusicologists’ study visits, which nowadays mainly refer to countries in Western Europe and the USA, represent a way in which new ideas on theoretic framework and working methods reach the Balkans. The selection of appropriate research strategies can be discussed at a theoretical level, even when based on the experience gathered from researches on different topics. Nevertheless, the most efficient and explicit form of selection of appropriate research strategies represents their comparison based on similar thematic circles. A large number of papers in this collection underline fieldwork as a predominant research method, some deal with fieldwork explicitly, while in some papers this is stated indirectly. Moreover, several papers indicate the presence of interdisciplinary research. As per topics, a substantial number of papers underscore the role of music in the process of identification and self-identification. Furthermore, research on the epic tradition, contemporary life of folklore music, including its revitalization and relations between folklore and popular music are singled out as up-to-date. As far as the research of the musics of the Balkan is concerned, one has to bear in mind that these music cultures feature almost a half-a-millennium old written history (Bezić 1974, Stathis 1976, Stojkova Serafimovska 2008: 23), numerous ritual genres, and epics in the vibrant, oral tradition (Докмановић 2000, Закић 2009, Bohlman and Petković 2011). Therefore, the historiographical aspect is among the permanent ethnomusicological preferences (here are just a few: Pekka Pennanen 2008; Marušić 2007; Aksoy 2006). The economic circumstances under which research is organized in many countries of the region practically limits local ethnomusicologists’ choices of topics, especially if they include fieldwork. Namely, local scientific policies applied in cases when research is to be conducted in other countries do not consider it as the research of national interest and therefore the great majority of ethnomusicologists conduct research within their own country, except in cases of diasporal research. On the other hand, studies on ethnic minorities are in-\n\nINTRODUCTION: MUSIC AND ETHNOMUSICOLOGY...\n\n17\n\ncreasingly present (see, for ex. Ceribašić and Haskell 2006). The preservation of the oral tradition of music-playing in villages, and the forms which are considered as very archaic suggest the necessity for ‘traditional’, quantitative, comprehensive fieldwork with an aim to make recordings of the immensely valuable sound legacy of the Balkan nations. This material is subject to various forms of scientific interpretation – thus only more underlying previously predominant paradigm reflected in the ‘fieldwork–transcription–analysis’ triad (Vasić and Panić-Kašanski 2008; Golemović and Rakočević 2008; Peycheva and Dimov 2008), as well as to an entire scope of its individual dimensions’ interpretations, up to its usage within the framework of applied ethnomusicology (Dumnić 2012). Today, fieldwork is conducted in urbanized rural and urban areas, as qualitative, in-depth research carried out through the application of various techniques, from observation and interviewing, to participating in the research practice. Finally, an option of ‘fieldwork at home’ (Stock and Chiener 2008), or ‘not far from home’ (see, for ex. Jovanović 2007), has been used to a great extent in monitoring cultural processes, permanent dynamic relations of the vibrant musical forms, the role of music in their evolution and changes music is undergoing, from the level of text to the level of culture. The availability of proportionally large databases that researchers may refer to and combine gained information with the results of their own fieldwork within the same areas, the researchers perceive as a potential in interpretation of the roles of different actors and how they influence traditions, their mutual relations from diachronic and/or synchronic perspective, as well as problems caused by different contextualizations. Ethnomusicological topics considered to be up-to-date all over the world are also present in the works of Balkan researchers, and therefore issues such as identity, minorities, cultural relations with special focus on relations between folklore and popular music, ‘Balkan cosmopolitanism’ (Buchanan 2007), new contextualizations – festivalization and mediaization (Baumann 2001: 9; Lundberg, Malm and Ronström 2003: 333), performance, and music industry have been addressed in different ways. Complex problems require interdisciplinary team projects, which have not yet taken hold in the Balkans, at least not to a significant extent. Nevertheless, the awareness of ethnomusicology’s distinctiveness reflected in the necessity of using all available forms of research (Nettl 1999: 288, 310) can be recognized in researches which tend to use the knowledge and strategies from other disciplines for ethnomusicological purposes. Therefore, there are some ethnomusicological works depicting music of the Balkans, in which one may often encounter, in one way or another, experiences and results of other disciplines such as anthropology, ethnology, history, history of literature, linguistics, archeology, but also psychology, sociology, semiology, cultural studies, and gender studies. Among the topics which at the same time require and offer the opportunity of addressing some issues from different perspectives is certainly a relation\n\n18\n\nDanka Lajić-Mihajlović, Jelena Jovanović\n\nbetween music and identity as a field of general ethnomusicological interest (Rice 2007) and one of the predominant fields of work of ethnologists dealing with the music of the Balkans. If (only) a place where music is performed is taken as a criterion for determination of music identity (Stokes 1994: 3–10), the Balkans could be considered as a common identity determinant of musicians, regardless of their ethnic, national, religious or some other background. However, whereas the local character prefixes are predominant in the self-determination of the Balkan inhabitants, and bearing in mind a distinctive, cultural diversity of sub- and micro-regions, to determine identity based on a solely music criterion is rather challenging. On the other hand, throughout a very long cultural history, the inhabitants of the Balkans found themselves in a situation where they were continuously ‘going beyond’ the boundaries of identity determinants, in which music played an important role. The process, involving the inclusion and ‘naturalization’ of musical differences and playing a pivotal role in the formation of ‘musical ethnicity’ (Ibid. 1994: 17), eventually led to the creation of a specific musical amalgam. At a (greater) distance, this amalgam is often perceived as a unique music culture which is often not only identified but also interpreted as being ‘oriental’ or even ‘Ottoman’ (in line with the discourse of Balkanism, more in Todorova 2006: 311). However, the fact that eastern influences are present in deep layers of Balkan cultures, from times long before the arrival of the Ottomans in this area is often overlooked. Furthermore, the Ottoman culture per se represents an amalgam of different eastern cultures (Reinhard et al. 2001). In that respect, researchers who study the music of the Balkans often directly or indirectly focus their attention on interpretation of the elements of ‘music of the East’ in music of the Balkans, which is the case in several papers in this collection. It is known that social changes have a significant impact on the (re)formation of music identities. They were especially intensive in the Balkans during the creation of nation-states, especially throughout the turbulent twentieth century which often witnessed sudden and drastic changes of political, economic, and social circumstances in the region. The complexity of cultural and social patterns along with musicians’ different communicative circumstances, led to the creation of their multiple identities that are undergoing a permanent process of mutual negotiation. A researcher’s cultural experience and ideological starting point have a great impact on the interpretation of identities of actors in musical practices, and serve as guidelines for research conceptualization. The Balkan ethnomusicologists tend to increasingly focus on popular music, especially genres which refer to folklore music. This issue incorporates the discourse of Balkanism, that is, essentialized perception of the Balkan musics as ‘the music of the Balkans’/‘Balkan music’, which inevitably narrows the field of observation and suppresses the spontaneity in experiencing and interpreting musics from this region. Global ideologies influence the aesthetic imperatives’\n\nINTRODUCTION: MUSIC AND ETHNOMUSICOLOGY...\n\n19\n\nprofiling through the music industry and principles of the music market, thus also significantly influencing the production of popular music in the Balkans. It is in this way that the Balkan music space is getting closer to the global music space with the perspective of eventually joining it. Ethnomusicologists tend to analyze popular music in various ways in this sphere so as to be able to discover some music patterns and their cognitive interpretations which would serve as a base for cross-cultural comparisons (Roeder 2011: 3–4), they address interactions between global and local cultural policies, their actors, music products and influences on (re)shaping of cultural identities. The papers that comprise this collection of works are not classified under any formal subject area, since, according to theoretical and methodological, and especially thematic criteria, they could be classified in various ways, and the order in which they have actually been presented is only one among ways of their possible mutual interconnections. This book opens with a theoretic discussion by Martin Stokes on treating the measures of analyzed collectivities in ethnomusicology, with a focus on ‘large-scale communities’ sound making, with an aim to promote a ‘multiscalar ethnography’. Relying on social experience, the author addresses the terms public(s), mass(es), crowd(s), and multitude(s). A special contribution is his elaboration on the music codes and the role of sound in ‘large-scale communities’ chanting, in their mutual communication, and transfer of energy and emotions. By encouraging the changes in ethnomusicologists’ opinions, Stokes emphasizes the necessity of researching scalar dynamics and the question of how things are transmitted from (however imagined) ‘small’ to ‘large’, and vice-versa. Lozanka Peycheva’s study presents an overview and interpretation of the approach and results of fieldwork in Bulgaria. The author highlights differences between the objectives and techniques of this form of research in the past, compared to the research conducted after the social changes took place in this country (1989), as well as the Bulgarian researchers’ experience from the field as compared to foreign researchers’ experiences. As per foreign researchers, she particularly focuses on the aspect of their adaptation to the studied culture and organization of work in a certain political context. The methods of interpretation of the material collected in the field involving systematic recording of the regional musical practices are especially developed in the Eastern European scientific communities. Olga Pashina’s paper offers a sublimed experience of Russian ethnomusicology presenting methods, techniques, objectives, and the scope of areal studies. This methodology is based on formation of the dialects of traditional, folklore culture according to their structural qualities and their further comparison, and it aims at making certain historical and/or ethnogenetic assumptions, as well as at studying ‘diachrony scattered in space’ – the elements of musical structure in a diachronic dimension, whereas genres’ attributions play an important role. Areal studies\n\n20\n\nDanka Lajić-Mihajlović, Jelena Jovanović\n\nhave been accepted by some ethnomusicologists from the Balkans, and Rodna Veličkovska’s paper discloses its results and ways of its application in Macedonia. By discovering connections between the results of structural and typological analysis based on distinctive melodic and rhythmic types, she identifies the dialects of vocal folk music in Macedonia. The collected material interpreted in such way provides a solid foundation for comparative research as well as for an interdisciplinary approach. Being encouraged by the existence of certain similarities between folklore traditions of the Balkans and the Baltic region, Daiva Vyčinienė started a comparative study that deals with the older layers of their vocal traditions. She took into consideration instrumental music, as well as an exhaustive list of references from other disciplines. The results of her research confirmed the existence of similarities, and contributed to the hypothesis on Balto-Balkan ethnogenetic relations. Several papers address the participant-observation approach in fieldwork. Athena Katsanevaki’s and Vesna Peno’s papers directly address this approach by highlighting the importance of this kind of experience not only for the sake of research but for practical pedagogical work and revitalization of traditional music. Furthermore, these papers reveal that there are similar experiences in the fields of secular and religious music. Katsanevaki underlines the importance of participatory research experience in the folklore tradition of Greece, and at the same time highlights how this kind of synchronic research proved to be useful for diachronic research. Peno writes from the perspective of a researcher-church chanter, and based on the history of the Orthodox Church chanting research, indicates how scientific interpretation lacking certain practical experience can be misleading, as this kind of approach carries the risk of missing the very ethos of the text. Finally, Jelena Jovanović’s paper describes the direct experience of a group of artists, who participated in two parallel processes—the restoration of the Byzantine chanting and bringing into light the kaval playing in Serbia in the late twentieth century. Within that specific context this instrument has been recognized and promoted as an element which reflects an attitude that the identity of Serbs belongs to a broader – Eastern Mediterranean, Orthodox cultural and religious space. Different forms of interviews are also among the standard techniques of fieldwork. The papers dealing with the epics address this issue. Namely, the epics offer the possibility of choice of different research approaches, owing to the depth of its diachronic dimension and range of topics expressed through its contemporary occurrence. Miroslav Stojisavljević chose a standard form of interview for the purpose of studying the response to epic singing and identityoriented interpretation of the gusle within the Serbian community in Australia. Relying on the methodology of sociological research, he interviewed the representatives of different (age, education, and other) categories of the audience. Iva Nenić’s paper belongs to the gender studies, and deals with the position of\n\nINTRODUCTION: MUSIC AND ETHNOMUSICOLOGY...\n\n21\n\nwomen in the tradition of epic singing with the gusle accompaniment in Serbia, and therefore the author combines reinterpretations of historic sources and the results of her own fieldwork. The technique of in-depth interview proved to be most efficient for obtaining specific personal information. Thus, the author presents the practice of the female gusle-player as a means of their self-actualization in the social and cultural community in which gusle playing is perceived as a predominantly male activity. Danka Lajić-Mihajlović’s paper reveals an example of fieldwork conducted for the purpose of studying the gusle performance by applying an interdisciplinary approach. In this stage, the research was projected from a psychological perspective and focused on memorization strategies of gusle players, as a part of music cognition, especially important in the context of oral epic tradition. This pilot study confirmed the effectiveness of the research method, and the results provided sufficient information from the perspective of the cognitive anthropology of music. Mirjana Zakić’s paper is among interdisciplinary-oriented studies and contributes to the application of the semiotic theory in ethnomusicology. It addresses three performances of a ritual, syncretic text in different ideological contexts (authentic, neotraditional, and popular), whereas relations are changing and music signs have different meanings within the sign–object–interpretant triad. The complexity of the issue of identity is commensurate with the scope of its research methodologies. The diversity of up to date interpretations of the identity of tradition whose written trace represents sheet music in the epic Ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje / Fishing and fishermen’ talk by Petar Hektorović (sixteenth century) serves as a testimony to the influence of ideologies, and therefore encourages new interpretations of this document. Sanja Radinović gives her contribution to these discussions by combining the study of historic sources with meticulous melopoetic analysis. She concludes that these records serve as a testimony to a formative principle characteristic for the South Slavic folklore vocal music. The research of identity often refers to multinational and multicultural territories, where the range of responses to the multitude of ‘the Otherness’ enables application of different methods of their scientific interpretation. Selena Rakočević focuses on the musical practice of the Banat Bulgarians who settled in Vojvodina (Northern Serbia) in the seventeenth century, and this has not been the subject of any ethnomusicological research so far. Through the continuous cultural and religious contacts with other ethnicities in Vojvodina, the Banat Bulgarians underwent the process of identity reshaping, and the author singles out and discusses the symbols of their actual identity. Sanja Ranković’s text addresses the issue of identity of the Bosnian Serbs (coming from the historic and geo-cultural region of Bosanska Krajina / Bosnian Frontier) who settled in Vojvodina throughout the twentieth century under different circumstances. Through the (stage) revitalization of traditional folklore of Bosanska Krajina, they tend to confirm their affiliation with the krajiški / Fron-\n\n22\n\nDanka Lajić-Mihajlović, Jelena Jovanović\n\ntiers’ cultural identity. Special focus is on a man who plays a key role in the process of identity reconstruction, acting as an intermediary between different cultural territories and generations of people originating from the Bosanska Krajina. Finally, Pál Richter’s text brings to light the ethnomusicological legacy of Tihomir Vujičić, a Hungarian ethnomusicologist of Serbian decent, which serves as a foundation for comparative interpretation of the South Slavic as well as other musical identities in the territory of the Pannonian Basin. In addition to the material collected in the field, Vujičić’s classification and interpretation of this material is of special importance in terms of identity studies, as a product of the overall experience of this multitalented musician. Rastko Jakovljević’s study addresses the sphere of vernacular in the music domain, through the relations between traditional (folklore) and popular music. The author connects his conclusions with the musical practice in Serbia, while, nevertheless, this represents a universal issue. Freedom in interpretation of traditional music (under different contexts and motivations) inevitably leads to ‘vernacularism’, regardless of its geo-cultural identity. Thus, this study offers some additional food for further thoughts of rather focal relations. Thanks to the different kinds of sources, Ventsislav Dimov reconstructed the image of a tavern music practice of the first half of the twentieth century, as an umbrella determinant of the social life and entertainment throughout the Balkan region. Through a comparative interpretation, the author was able to notice a distinctiveness of communication through music within smaller and larger communities, and even to elaborate on the phenomena of music going beyond national boundaries. The author highlights the role of the Roma, as intermediaries in the process of conveying the musical elements and repertoire, as well as the important role of mass-media. Studies of the new(est) popular music incorporated in this book also depict a variety of research approaches. The text by Ahmed Tohumcu, Gonca Girgin Tohumcu, and Merve Eken Küçükaksoy elaborates on the work of three Turkish musicians who act as mediators during cross-cultural encounters, combining in a characteristic way folk, classic, and popular music. The authors interpret the genesis and evolution of thus created hybrid genres with regard to the cultural policies on one hand, and artists’ creative sensibility, on the other. Mladen Marković looks into the musical discourse as opposed to the discourse of music created by the most prominent World Music authors, that is, the creators and presenters of ethno music in Serbia so as to explore the relation between their compositions and Serbian traditional music. Namely, these authors explicitly claim that their compositions are based on traditional music. Analysis reveals that the quality of this relation positions ethno music deep into the popular music genre. Marija Dumnić’s paper depicts the creation of the discourse of autobalkanism, as some kind of feedback on the discourse of Balkanism, present in the sphere of popular music in Serbia. The analysis of elements\n\nINTRODUCTION: MUSIC AND ETHNOMUSICOLOGY...\n\n23\n\nof multimedia performance of the Serbian representative at the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 reveals how the auto-Balkan aspiration of the author of the song, that is the creator of the cultural policy, has been actually embodied. Ethnomusicological encounters in the Balkans are substantially marked by mutual recognition and empathy both on a professional and personal level. The music of the Balkans, scientific and cultural policies offer a platform for networking, as well as for expressing distinctiveness on a national, and even individual level. Each study represents a national ethnomusicological community to a certain extent, but beyond that it is an individual act. In that sense, with regard to the choice of theoretical and methodological framework we can metaphorically refer to and quote Jim Samson: ‘music analysis is as much form of self-analysis (raising all the familiar problems of the ‘I’ describing itself) as an empirical explanation of the other’ (Samson 1999: 46). Pluralism of thinking and acting within the frameworks of national ethnomusicologies in the Balkans speaks volumes about the existence of some kind of democracy in expressing research identities. Above all, it reflects the breadth of motivation that Balkan musics extend to researchers.

MARTIN STOKES1 Abstract: Ethnomusicology has often been understood as the study of the small-scale, but what scale really means, in musical contexts, and exactly ‘how small is small’ are questions rarely asked or answered. The article shows some of the epistemological, ideological and aesthetic stakes of ethnomusicology’s ‘small-scale’ commitments, and suggests some alternatives. Football terrace chanting and the sounds of the Tahrir Square demonstrations in Cairo provide case studies. A multi-scalar ethnography – the approach advocated here – opens windows onto some significant, but often over-looked musical phenomena. It also encourages reflection on some of ethnomusicology’s tacit theoretical predilections and biases, which may be inhibiting. Keywords: scale, chanting, masses, publics, crowds, entrainment.\n\n1. For Marilyn Strathern, “scale has been a headache for anthropology” (Strathern 1995: 15). Anthropological ‘conventions of scale’ have forced anthropologists to work with a problematically divided sense of their field. Such conventions imagine small-scale ethnography as appropriate for anthropologists; sociologists are equipped to deal with ‘the large scale’. More importantly, for Strathern, they drive a wedge between the embodied, intimate relational structures of kinship (the essence, in the conventional way of looking at things of ‘small scale’ social relations) and the abstract articulations of social order social scientists habitually register in terms of ‘the economy’, ‘the nation’ and so forth. Strathern argues for a view of social relations as being inherently multi-scalar, connected across scales. I would make a similar argument about ethnomusicology. But Strathern’s anxiety about the rival claims of another science of society – sociology – is not one ethnomusicologists generally share. Historical musicology, ethnomusicology’s disciplinary ‘other’, does not claim to be operating on a larger scale. Its claim is usually simply that it is working with more significant music. If anything, the relationship is reversed, with ethnomusicologists often representing, in discussions about the disciplinary field, a larger, i.e. global frame of reference. Ethnomusicologists have often found themselves\n\n1\n\nThis article has been read in various forms over the last year at Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle, Toronto and Belgrade.

Since the 1950s, ethnomusicologists, absorbing anthropological norms, began to focus on small-scale interactions and meanings. In-depth participantobserver fieldwork, an effort to understand colonized peoples ‘in their own terms’, thrived in the latter days of Empire. The generalizing and globalizing thrust of an earlier style of ethnography came to be understood as epistemologically untrustworthy and politically problematic. As the challenge, post 1950, came to be understood as one of dealing with ever-increasing scalar orders – city, nation-state, region, globe – anxieties about ethnomusicology’s appropriate scale grew. Many responded by reaffirming the priority of the local and the micro-social: villages, migrant community, neighborhood in the city; the local as ‘where the global happens’; micro-musics, like the ‘slow food’ movement, a creative and resistive response to globalization and the relentless media-accelerated pace of modern everyday life. Moving up the scalar order – city, nation-state, region, Diaspora, network, globe – has seemed to require theoretical interventions, or importations, from ancillary fields: sociology, media and communication studies, critical theory, cultural studies, political science. ‘Theoretical’ discussion thus attains a kind of visibility, a marked quality as one moves away from the local, the micro-social. There is anxiety about this. Ethnomusicology, to some, seems no longer capable of producing, or prioritizing, ‘its own theory’ (Rice 2007). The problems of ethnomusicology’s ‘small is beautiful’ outlook have been extensively discussed, and won’t detain me much here. The local, we now see, is often most productively thought of as being produced – and fetishized – within much larger systems. The ontological integrity of the sovereign subject and the face-to-face relationship – the foundation of many if not most anthropological and ethnomusicological conceptions of fieldwork - can no longer be assumed. Ethnomusicologists sense of the value of ‘small’ persists, though, perversely, I’d say. Ethnographers of music continue to move excessively cautiously into the new culture-making spaces of digitization, downloading, file sharing, on-line fandom, and various kinds of virtual music-making, implicitly conceived as being too big, or diffuse in scale. And ethnographic questions about crowds, publics, masses are tough ones to crack. I’ll get to this later in the article. 2. Pressure on the ‘small’ value-system in ethnomusicology goes back quite a long way, though. Early ethnographies would usually start off with numbers. Beyond establishing some kind of objective, empirical ground (or, at least, lending an aura of objectivity and empiricism to what followed), these numbers involved complex claims. The tiny numbers of inhabitants of Lachmann’s Hara Kbira (3,500) and Hara Sghira (1,500) on the island of Djerba, encountered in 1929, communicated authenticity, the rigours of a scien-\n\nHOW BIG IS ETHNOMUSICOLOGY?\n\n31\n\ntific ethnography, and the predicament of Jewish culture on Europe’s margins (Lachmann 1940). Alan Merriam’s early articles were absorbed not only by the tiny numbers of Flathead Indians on the reservations of western Montana, but by the decreasing number of ‘full-bloods’ (303 out of 2,500). At issue: their imminent erasure, and the imperatives of salvage ethnography (Merriam 1951). Blacking’s, on the Venda use numbers to make a rather different point. Far from disappearing, they were everywhere: on the Reserves, on the European-owned farms, and migrating to the towns and cities. One could hardly hope to understand South Africa without taking into account the fact that there were over a quarter of a million of them, i.e., a lot. Vendaland should not, in Blacking’s view, be considered an insignificant margin of modern South Africa (Blacking 1967). A different tone is struck in Gerd Baumann’s 1987 study of the Miri of the Sudan. The First Population Census of Sudan of 1955/6 took into account 115 languages spoken in the country, and it people’s allegiance to 597 tribes and ethnic groups. The total population was almost equally divided between groups that on historical, linguistic, or cultural grounds identify themselves as ‘Arab or Arab-Sudanese, and groups that on similarly diverse grounds are identified as African-Sudanese. (Baumann 1987: 1)\n\nBaumann was a student of Blacking’s, and the opening of this book has some of the dry, administrative tone of Blacking’s Venda Children’s Songs. But the figures communicate not a ground, but a problem that the ethnography goes on to address. In this extremely complex situation, local markers of ethnic difference follow context dependent and performative rules, making it difficult to say who is who, at least in conventional population census terms. He goes on in his book to show how music making is implicated in both in processes of ethnic differentiation and in national integration. Music-making is one of the ways in which one is able to become Miri, or Nubian in the Sudanese context, and Sudanese in the Miri or Nubian context. In the early 1990s, numbers started to disappear – at least, in the form of these kinds of opening words. By an emerging convention – to take the opening of almost any recent monograph published by, for example, by the University of Chicago Press, Cambridge University Press or Wesleyan University Press – one finds an ethnographic vignette. As James, this was also the pattern in anthropological writing (Clifford 1986). The aims of such vignettes were substantially similar: to establish the authenticity of the account. In such vignettes the author says, I was there, I was part of this world, you can trust what I say, because I, dear reader, am an ethnomusicologist like you and share your sense of what is interesting and worthwhile. Authenticity is guaranteed not with reference to an objectively verifiable world, but with reference to the experience of an interlocutor. At a certain level the disappearance of population figures from the opening pages of ethnographic monographs is hardly an issue. Ethnographers at-\n\n32\n\nMartin Stokes\n\ntempt to grapple with large, dispersed and mobile populations; numbers, we all know, are estimates at best. They have also learned to question officially produced figures. But there are questions to be asked here. Is the gradual disappearance of figures that establish the size of the communities that we study simply the result of a distrust of empiricism, as outmoded and distasteful as measuring skulls to establish racial identity? Or a sign of the Strathern’s ‘headache’ – a growing anxiety not just about method, but the very identity of the subdiscipline? 3. Broader ideological pressures have born on these ‘headaches’ about scale. Adorno’s visceral reaction to mass-produced popular music is well known (Adorno 1941). Mid-twentieth century, ethnomusicologists depicted the fragility of Native American culture to emphasize its imminent erasure. Popular music scholars Roger Wallis and Krister Malm celebrated the ‘Big Sounds of Small Peoples’ (1984). Monumentalism in the western art music tradition continues to elicit disquiet at its entanglement with political authoritarianism (Rehding 2009). Big, in music study, has rarely been beautiful. Such anxieties about scale are now entangled with neoliberal political discourse, the ideological soundtrack of our recent history. This has successfully shifted public debate in many parts of the world from large-scale questions about systemic inequality, underdevelopment, and the distribution of resources to small-scale questions about personal morality and the family. Such shifts have justified the thoroughgoing privatization of society and the fragmentation of political debate about society-wide issues. What remains of public space is now cluttered with images and discourses of threats to familiar morality and domestic security – images and discourses Berlant and Warner, amongst others, dub ‘cultural intimacy’. This is, in their words, “the mechanism by which a core national culture can be imagined as a sanitized space of sentimental feeling and immaculate behaviour, a space of pure citizenship…” (1998: 549). Popular music of the kind habitually labelled ‘sentimental’ has been thoroughly implicated in the images and discourses of cultural intimacy. National identifications, as many have shown, have been forged through kinds of affection imagined as small in scale: the scale of lovers, or spouses, or siblings, or parents and children. Think of the literature on arabesk, enka, musica sertaneja, country music, tango, fado, conjunto, turbofolk. As Berlant and Warner point out, such imaginations of the large-scale are inherently limiting. “A familial model of society displaces the recognition of structural racism and other systemic inequalities,” as they point out (Ibid. 549). But they also circulate common sense and everyday notions of decency, reciprocity and mutuality whose political effects are far from obvious. At the moment it is probably most productive to note the way such musical practices project private into public, and vice-versa. The dialectical and ‘nested’ properties of publicness and privateness of publicness and intimacy\n\nHOW BIG IS ETHNOMUSICOLOGY?\n\n33\n\nhave often been noted.2 Such nestings have been enabled and enhanced by the technological transformations associated first by cassettes and then with the web (Facebook, You Tube, Spotify), where public music making is privatized and private music making is publicized in increasingly intense ways. The ethnomusicological question of scale today is entangled with questions about the relation of public and private – inextricably political and ideological. 4. Masses, crowds, publics. These reflections about the size of ethnomusicology lead me in two directions. One concerns me at the moment mainly in my efforts to characterize the history of ethnomusicology’s distinctive – and to my mind rather debilitating – struggles with the idea of ‘Theory’. As I’ve mentioned, ideas about the intrinsic small-scale-ness of ethnomusicology enshrine – entirely problematically – distinctions between Fieldwork (unmediated engagement with small-scale music-making) and Theory (the – as it were - highly mediated vehicle by which one expands these insights to deal with larger spaces of culture making). Such distinctions are, I believe, needless, inhibiting and epistemologically disastrous. They have also pushed me to explore some ethnographic questions about musical signification and affect in what might – if one is to admit the legitimacy of any language of scale – be called ‘large-scale’ collectivities. I’ll say a bit in conclusion about how this impacts on some of my broader interests in Middle Eastern music. Firstly, though, the terms habitually used to theorize such collectivities are heavily value laden. Publics – as we all know – have been a lively area of debate and discussion in the social sciences in recent decades, with masses and crowds imagined as their problematic other. Recent inquiry, emerging from critiques of Habermas, has involved a significant rethinking of these categories. I find this rethinking extremely productive for an ethnomusicology of (large) scale and I’d like to conclude my talk today by saying why. Public formation has often been understood in terms of a language of scale: how large-scale solidarities, often, particularly, national solidarities, are formed, from smaller-scale solidarities, through mass media. But a public, thus conceived, is not only, or simply, a scalar order, a magnitude of social relation. It is, as Michael Warner puts it, a kind of sociability, oriented towards strangers through the circulation of texts. Habermas, particularly in his later work, stressed the rule-bound nature of this kind of social interaction.3 More recent critics have come to feel that this is a highly normative way of thinking of the public sphere, one that sits over-easily with his somewhat idealized picture of the emergence of the public sphere in Europe in the late 18th century, one in which the racial and gendered exclusions of this period are invisible.4 More re2\n\nSee, for an important and recent collection of essays on the subject, Born and Rice 2011. See, in particular, Habermas, 1984. 4 See for example Frazer 1990. 3\n\n34\n\nMartin Stokes\n\ncent work has come to conceptualize the affectual and emotional elements of public formation, a view that produces ‘publics’ rather than a monolithic ‘public’, and admits the possibility that some of them might be in conflict with others, and with the dominant social order.5 The public’s opposite, since at least the time of Robert Park’s pioneering study of 1904, has been the unruly ‘mass’, with implications of, on the one hand, passivity and on the other a turbulent hyperagency associated with emotion, suggestibility, credulity (1972).6 For Park, sociological theorizations of both ‘public’ and ‘masses’ respond to an anxiety about scale, about understanding the collective life in societies in which the ‘social group’ “is not perceived by the senses as a physical unity’. But, for Park, the distinction between the two is crucial. Publics consolidate autonomous individuals, facts (“to which attitudes may profoundly differ,” Ibid.: 59), abstraction and reflexivity. They do the orderly work of modernity, in other words. Crowds, for Park, do the reverse. They involve a contagious emotional mimeticism that suppresses individualism and rational thought. Crowds are thus “always more or less disruptive and revolutionary” (Ibid.: 47). They do, in other words, modernity’s dirty work. Park draws on an earlier sociology of the crowd, that of Le Bon and Tarde. Buried somewhere in his emphatic distinction between the two is a suggestion of the social principles that might connect publics and crowds. This is not, then, simply, an idealization of publics in terms that portray crowds as an abjected element, a ‘bad other’ in the analysis of modern collectivites and solidarities. Crowds and publics both involve a process of mutuality, a sympathetic principle that troubles the habitual understanding of the one in terms of reason and the other in terms of emotion. Thus understood, they might appear less as analytically separable objects, and more as connected ways of understanding the forging of modern solidarities: kinds of crowds might become kinds of publics and vice-versa. A similar line of thinking is at work in William Mazzarella’s critical reading of Hardt and Negri (2010). Hardt and Negri’s theorization of ‘multitudes’ is a well-known attempt to recognize some kind of progressive agency in (post)modern life that works through collectivities, rather than autonomous individuals. As Mazzarella argues, this characterization of multitudes leaves certain nineteenth century sociological understandings of crowds unchallenged. The “mimetic contagion” of emotions that so disturbed Le Bon and Tarde in crowds is not necessarily opposed to reason and public behaviour, but, quite possibly, entangled with it, and perhaps, even, as eighteenth century sentimental philosophy averred, a condition for it. Social theory – drawing a line from Park to Mazzarella, and rooted in ways that have I believe yet to be 5 6\n\nSee, notably, Warner 2002. The essay, ‘The Crowd and the Public’ was originally published in German in 1904.\n\nHOW BIG IS ETHNOMUSICOLOGY?\n\n35\n\nexplored in Smith and Hume – thus moves towards a conception of modern social solidarities as simultaneously emotive and reasoned, and as productive of complex kinds collective agency. Alongside these traditions of inquiry might be set a view of public formation from the humanities. This has consistently stressed the role of emotion and affect in public formation in discussions, for example, of the sentimental novel, or of Beethoven criticism. Somewhere between these two traditions of inquiry we have the possibility of an intriguing account of modern social solidarities, and what it is that makes them compelling, believable and transformative. 5. A brief reflection on football terrace chanting might give us pause for thought. For here is a crowd that makes social process real and engaging through sound. Try turning down the sound when you are simultaneously attempting to watch football on television and trying to have a conversation with your spouse, or watching matches in countries where football is still not really understood and the crowds don’t make much noise (like the USA), or watching when the familiar and reassuring sound of roaring and singing fans is drowned out by some ‘alien’ import – like the vuvuzela at the last world cup. At such moments one realizes just how important these dense, textured, patterned, overlapping waves of sound are. The players, of course, already know. We recognize the ‘crowdness’ of a gathering by its sound. Elias Canetti was quick to recognize this fact (1962). The fundamental noise of crowds, for Canetti, is the sound of multiple feet on the ground. Each foot is a subtly differentiated sound-producing device – the sound of one’s left foot, he observes, is quite different to the sound of one’s right foot. In the sound of multiple feet one is able to imagine the size and power of the multitude, and the place of the individual organism-sound-producer in it. Canetti brings this intriguing analysis of crowd noise rather quickly to bear on his broader thesis: that crowds are vital scenes of collective self-fashioning in modern society, whose energies permeate modern institutions and public life. It is the sound of the crowd that we hear in marching and dancing, he suggests. Crowds, in the various shapes and forms, fuel modern subjectivities, and modern institutions: they are not their enemies. We can extend Canetti’s insight. Football chants do highly symbolic, coded, work, identifying fans and sub-groups of fans, commenting on the action on the pitch, the managers, the referees, voicing dissent and anger as well as providing humour, inventiveness and entertainment. Musical ensembles signifying national identity have become quite common at the world cup in recent years. Football chanting, it should be noted, is a relatively recent and highly mediated phenomenon, dating back not much earlier than the televised broadcasting in the 1950s. It has been an aspect of the marketing of local identity since then, and the commodification of football chanting in the form of cell\n\n36\n\nMartin Stokes\n\nphone ringtones and so forth continues apace. Football chants, abstracted from the context of the game, can be thought of, rather straighfowardly, as more or less commodified signs of local or factional identity. Some interesting recent work proceeds along these lines.7 But we are often too caught up in fantasies of community and plenitude offered by crowd sounds to pause and ask how they come about.8 We need to place ourselves within these sonic masses, experience our own immersion, sometimes active, sometimes passive, in waves of sound of various dimensions, emanating from various locales, ranging from the proximate to the distant. We need to notice how chants are initiated, how they catch, how they build, how they confront opposition, how they overlap, interact, fizzle out. The processes are pretty complex and I don’t feel we have crowd ethnography entirely up to the task just yet. But at least part of the picture will need to be built up from within, simultaneously listening to the crowd and being part of it. A crowd thus imagined is not, exactly, the crowd of crowd theory. It is too localized and specific to be, quite, a ‘mass’, and too unruly to be, quite, a ‘public’. As a listener one is neither, quite, subsumed by the totality – a mass subject. Experience suggests that one hears one’s individual voice in the whole, and those of people immediately around you; one observes, even as one participates in, the relays and feedback loops by which singing will start up, gather pace, catch and sputter to a halt. And neither, too, is one entirely individuated – an autonomous subject. We find ourselves, somehow, doing what our neighbours are doing. We are all aware, with varying degrees of pleasure or discomfort, of the kind of sympathetic principles at play in crowds. Sound is the medium through which a complex kind of collectivity emerges, expanding, contracting, shifting in emotional tone and energy. There is much here that puts me in mind of Hardt and Negri’s ‘multitude’ – their expression for the networked, distributed, performative creativity that is taking shape under emerging globalized and postmodern conditions of labor (2004). But two quick pauses for thought. Firstly, the fiercely racist, misogynistic and violent tone of much football chanting should, of course, give us pause for thought about the potential radicalism of such soundscapes. Secondly, the entanglement of this sonic form with processes of mass mediation complicates Hardt and Negri’s romantic attachment to the multitude’s life force, its primal vitality. Anxieties about mediation and representation pervade their account of the multitude, as many have pointed out. We need a theorization of these scenes of large-scale collective culture making that capable of acknowledging their intricately mediated nature. (And, parenthetically, their anti-democratic potentialities.) 7 8\n\nSee, for example, Back 2003. For an excellent critique, see Biddle 2009.\n\nHOW BIG IS ETHNOMUSICOLOGY?\n\n37\n\n6. Tahrir square: a democratic moment, surely, even if, a year after the event, it is still hard to see exactly where it is heading. In scalar terms, it is particularly challenging. A crowd is involved, its numbers often exaggerated, but often clearly numbering tens of thousands. A wild romance has been played out in the western press, often focusing on particular individuals and groups – Ramy Essam, for instance, who penned Tahrir’s ‘anthem’, Irhal, or Tahrir’s highly photogenic ‘troubador collective’, picked out by the New York Times early in February 2011.9 The music of Tahrir has thus, at least in the press, been understood in rather individuated, atomized ways. The ethnomusicologists’ instincts, too, are to parse and sub-divide, to comb the soundscape for indicators of age, ethnicity, and class. I, at least, have found myself attempting to do so, and the material at one’s disposal, in this complexly mediated, reflexive and selfscrutinizing political movement, is extremely rich. Thus, the search for music in Tahrir, and the quest for its agency, its power, almost instinctively involves a reach for the microscope, an attempt to identify its smallest constituent parts. The most identifiably ‘Egyptian’ sound of Tahrir square is the rhymed chanting, hitafat. Their wit and verbal dexterity has (rightly) been celebrated, and the object of academic attention. An interesting webpage produced by American University of Cairo students, called ‘Unsettling the dust’, deals primarily with problems of translation.10 It notes the Nasserite genealogy of some of these chants (i.e. long preceding the 25 January uprising), their connection with lyrics of the film musicals of the 1950 and 1960s, their play on the linguistic registers of formal and Egyptian Arabic, and other such matters. Chants are treated, then, as a kind of text, to be considered, ultimately, in the context of Egyptian literary culture. The authors, rather characteristically, seem more comfortable in the next section, which deals with revolutionary signs and banners. These afford more obvious scope for implicitly literary kinds of subtlety, humour and intertextuality. Grasping these crowd sounds musically is difficult, though. One can, as I have done, ask participants to remember their favourites, break them down into units, explain and translate them. One is in a position to note some significant performative features. Take two simple examples: Itisam, itisam / hatta yesqut an-nizam! (Endure, endure / until the fall of the regime!)\n\n9\n\nOn Ramy Issam, see www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14254564. On the Troubadour Collective, see www.nytimes.com/2011/02/20/books/review/Creswell-t.html. 10 See their website at http://translatingrev.wordpress.com/.\n\n38\n\nMartin Stokes\n\nOr, Muslim, mesihi / kullina masriyin! (Muslim, Christian / we are all Egyptian!)\n\nAligned with others, and thought of across a broader spectrum of Egyptian vocal art, one is struck by a pervasive and virtually inflexible principle: a rhythmic framework presented in the first hemistich, which is then elaborated, always with an extra syllable count, in the second. The principle is ‘simple’, but clearly an important key to the way in which such chants build up. It is probably at play in other forms of popular versifiying – popular song, street hawkers chants, mawlud improvisations. Further research would be needed. But it might shed light on their most significant, but most overlooked feature: the ferocious accumulation of energy when chanted. Much might be shared with antiphonal patterns, calls and responses, refrains in other cultures, or with the sonic exchanges of early infancy and childhood. Answers to these kind of questions would go a long way to explaining some of the power of chant to bring people together, to face down an oppressive state, and simply to endure. But something important would have been missed. I might describe this ‘something’ as a scalar dynamic: put simply, how a small group ends up growing, sonically, and absorbing others. It is a process that involves complex transfers of energy. At the heart of such chanting groups is a leader, there for his/her wit (or hiffet damm, much prized amongst working class Egyptians) and charisma. Their job is to lead the antiphony. A circle forms, sometimes pacing in an anticlockwise direction in time with the beat, marked out by handclapping. The circle grows, and with it, the sonic density of the chanting. As energy accumulates in this way, the chanting slows down, often only fractionally. (The reverse of what, in western music, we habitually associate with the intensification of energy.) The momentary readjustments of pace and timing afford an opportunity for another to leap in and lead the antiphony, often with a different chant, and often to a slightly different rhythm. Energy accumulates, and others join the circle, attracted by the wit of exchanges and the exuberance of the participants. The process repeats itself until nobody can step in quite quickly enough at the ‘gear changes’ to move the chant on to another phase. Meanwhile, an interesting or witty chant starts up nearby. Collective attention and energy drifts until new foci emerge.11 11\n\nWatch the following video, for instance: the first of the scalar ‘gear changes’ that interests me takes place after approximately 10 seconds: www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&v= ufx_UHnCXyw.\n\nHOW BIG IS ETHNOMUSICOLOGY?\n\n39\n\nThis is, of course, a crude simplification of an intricate process. But we need some way of bringing this intricacy into focus, to see at least some of the things going on. Ethnomusicological habits of thought have not always helped, I’ve argued here. Part of this intricacy is addressed by a growing literature on entrainment, the falling into sync of bodies and sounds in spaces and places.12 This is an important start. But we need to grasp scalar dynamics firmly: how things are transmitted from (however imagined) ‘small’ to ‘large’, and vice-versa; how things are entrained across domains marked by a significant scalar differential. One wants, in the end, to be able to see how handclapping and chanting might be instrumental in bringing down a government and changing the world.
