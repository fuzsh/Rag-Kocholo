        "text": "BELGRADE -- By appointing two members who are under U.S. sanctions to the new Serbian government, Belgrade has only nurtured its relationship with Moscow, a senior associate with the Berlin-based Council for Democratization Policy told RFE/RL on April 30.\n\nBut including the two sanctioned officials to the new government roster \"doesn't imply abandoning the policy of sitting on two chairs\" -- one in the East and one in the West, said Bodo Weber, who replied to e-mailed questions from RFE/RL after the government was named.\n\nThe \"two-chair\" policy refers to Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic's attempt to maintain good relations with the European Union -- which Serbia strives to join -- while keeping close ties to traditional ally Russia, even after the Kremlin's decision to invade Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nMilos Vucevic, leader of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), was tapped last month to form a new government, and on April 30 he announced it will include former intelligence chief Aleksandar Vulin, who has been under U.S. sanctions since July 2023, to the post of deputy prime minister, and Nenad Popovic, another official blacklisted by the United States, as a minister without portfolio.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:02:25 0:00\n\nVulin was placed on the U.S. sanctions list in July 2023 for allegedly using his position to further Russian and criminal agendas, including arms dealing and drug trafficking.\n\nPopovic, designated in November 2023, used his Russia-based businesses to enrich himself and gain close connections with Kremlin senior leaders, according to the U.S. Treasury Department.\n\nThe U.S. State Department told RFE/RL that the United States is \"disappointed to see two sanctioned individuals proposed for positions in the new government.\" The department's e-mailed response to a request for comment added, \"Our position on Mr. Vulin and Mr. Popovic is well known. They remain under U.S. sanctions.\"\n\nVucevic also named Milica Djurdjevic Stamenkovski, president of the right-wing Zavetnici party, to head the Ministry of Family Care. The Zavetnici party, formerly in opposition, entered into cooperation with the SNS after the December elections, which were marred by widespread allegations of fraud and irregularities.\n\nThere also are several new names in the 25-member government, while 13 ministers remain at the helm of the same ministries they led in the previous government.\n\n\"There's a recognizable continuation of the trend of greater involvement of party operatives [and] members of the inner circle around Vucic,\" said Weber, adding that he didn't see any ideological shift in the policy of Vucic's regime in the composition of the new government.\n\nHe said Vucic's regime has always relied less on a specific ideology and more on maintaining power, \"so the authoritarian mindset behind it, rather than its nationalist ideological heritage, has been and remains more important.\"\n\nAsked what message the new government sends to the international community, Weber said EU membership has long been more of a means for Vucic to consolidate and maintain power and to strengthen Serbia's international position rather than a serious goal.\n\nAt the same time Weber is very critical of the European Union's \"appeasement policy\" toward Serbia, saying it means Vucic doesn't need to worry about what message his new government sends.\n\n\"Since the EU has failed to muster the strength to stop its long-failed appeasement policy toward the authoritarian-autocratic regime in Serbia, what continues is a performance devoid of any substance called Serbia's European integration,\" he said.\n\nAn initiative by Germany and France on the political dialogue between Serbia and Kosovo, a former province of Serbia whose independence Belgrade does not recognize, \"was based precisely on that previously proven failed appeasement policy toward Vucic,\" Weber added. \"It has gloriously failed in an unprecedented escalation in northern Kosovo, which Western capitals still aren't willing to acknowledge.\"\n\nTensions in ethnic-Serb dominated northern Kosovo have remained high since an incident in September that left an ethnic Albanian Kosovar police officer dead after an encounter with masked commandos allegedly led by a Kosovar Serb politician. Three of the gunmen were also killed.\n\nWeber said Belgrade will never face sanctions for the regime's \"direct responsibility for the attack…ensuring that even resorting to massive electoral fraud in the December elections in Belgrade won't provoke a serious reaction from the West.\"\n\nHe added that Vucic apparently had no concerns about a possible strong U.S. reaction to the appointment of two sanctioned ministers.\n\nThe policy of imposing sanctions on officials close to the Kremlin remains \"entirely disconnected from the general policy of the U.S. administration towards Belgrade.\"\n\nWeber also criticized the United States as having \"taken a leading role in the Western appeasement policy.\"\n\nHowever U.S. envoy for the Western Balkans Gabriel Escobar has urged the two sides to resolve their differences. And in March during a visit to Pristina he put pressure on Prime Minister Albin Kurti to reverse a ban on the use of Serbia's dinar in the country's north.\n\nBut Weber said it was apparent that nurturing relations with Moscow was considered in forming the government at a time when Vucic feels pressure due to the Council of Europe coming closer to admitting Kosovo and a UN resolution on the genocide in Srebrenica.\n\n\"However, this still doesn't mean abandoning the policy of sitting on two chairs,\" Weber said.\n\nWeber also said Vucevic has the capacity to lead the government and keep the cabinet together based on his status as a member of Vucic's \"inner circle\" and his position as president of the party.\n\nHe added that it will be interesting to see how Vucic relates to the prime minister, noting it won't be as easy to shift blame for negative events onto the government when it's led by the president of the ruling party.\n\nNone of this will jeopardize the stability of a regime that currently isn't seriously threatened, \"least of all by the West, and it seems, no longer by the opposition,\" Weber said.\n\nWith reporting by RFE/RL's Balkan Service\n\nAuthorities in Russia's western Belgorod region have declared a regional state of emergency as Ukrainian forces continue to press their incursion into the neighboring Kursk region.\n\n\"The situation in our Belgorod region remains extremely difficult and tense,\" Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov wrote on Telegram on August 14. \"There is daily shelling from the armed forces of Ukraine. Homes have been destroyed and civilians have been injured and killed.\"\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\nEarlier, Belgorod announced the evacuation of thousands of civilians from districts bordering Ukraine and the Kursk region.\n\nMoscow has proclaimed an \"anti-terrorism operation\" in the Kursk, Belgorod, and Bryansk regions.\n\nMeanwhile, the Russian Defense Ministry on August 14 said that 37 Ukrainian drones had been \"destroyed\" over the Voronezh region, several hundred kilometers southwest of Moscow. Voronezh region Governor Aleksandr Gusev said no casualties had been reported, but several residential buildings were damaged.\n\nIn all, the ministry said 117 drones and \"four tactical missiles\" had been launched against Russia overnight, including 37 that were reportedly \"destroyed\" over the Kursk region.\n\nIt is not possible to verify battlefield claims.\n\nRussia’s main soccer league announced that a match scheduled to be held on August 18 in Voronezh would be held in Moscow instead.\n\nUkrainian forces launched a surprise incursion into Russia's Kursk region on August 6 and claim to have occupied about 1,000 square kilometers of Russian territory.\n\nOn August 13, Ukraine's top military commander, Colonel General Oleksandr Syrskiy, said his forces had taken control of 74 Kursk region settlements and were advancing slowly despite intense fighting.\n\nThe U.S. newspaper The Wall Street Journal reported on August 13, citing unnamed U.S. officials, that Russia had transferred some of its forces from Ukraine to the defense of the Kursk region, which analysts have said was a key goal for Kyiv.\n\nThe officials said it was unclear how many troops had been transferred or what impact the move could have on the fighting in Ukraine.\n\nThe Russian publication Vyorstka wrote on Telegram on August 13 that Russian conscripts who had been evacuated from the fighting in the Kursk region were facing increased pressure from military officials to sign volunteer contracts and return to the front.\n\nSerbian Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandar Vulin discussed security issues and the \"involvement of external forces\" in Serbia with Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu in Moscow, the Serbian government said on August 13.\n\nVulin thanked the Russian security agencies that \"warned Serbian leadership about preparations for mass unrest and an attempted coup,\" a government statement said.\n\nVulin, who has been designated by the United States for sanctions due to his close ties to the Kremlin, met with Shoigu after a mass environmental protest over the weekend in Belgrade in which thousands of citizens demanded a ban on lithium mining. Three activists were jailed and several were questioned by police.\n\nThe Serbian government accused organizers and participants in the protests, which have been ongoing for weeks across Serbia, of attempting to violently overthrow Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic.\n\nVucic said last week that Russian security services \"warned that mass unrest was being prepared in Serbia, with the ultimate goal of a coup and the overthrow of the country's leadership.\"\n\nForeign policy analyst Bosko Jaksic told RFE/RL this was \"a colossal manipulation\" and considers Vucic's statements \"part of a multiyear game of swinging between East and West.\"\n\nHe said the Russians \"use every situation everywhere in the world\" to destabilize and \"turn countries and politicians against the West.\"\n\nVulin, who is on an official visit to Russia, reiterated on August 12 that Serbia would not impose sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine. Serbia justifies its refusal citing friendly relations with Russia and the support it receives from Moscow.\n\nThe protesters demand a halt to Anglo-Australian metals and mining giant Rio Tinto's lithium project in Jadar in western Serbia over fears it could pollute nearby land and water.\n\nThe organizers of the most recent mass protest demand the release of the three activists -- Ivan Bjelic, Nikola Ristic and Jevdenije Julijan Dimitrijevic.\n\nTheir lawyer, Marko Pantic, told RFE/RL they were charged with violating the Law on Public Order and Peace and released on August 13.\n\nPantic had filed an appeal against verdicts issued by the Misdemeanor Court, which told RFE/EL the three activists were convicted in the first instance for \"indecent, insolent and reckless behavior.\"\n\nThe article referred to by the court provides for a sentence of 30 to 60 days in prison for those who \"disturb public order and peace or endanger property or insult the morale of citizens by indecent, insolent or reckless behavior.\"\n\nThe court declined to answer RFE/RL’s inquiry on the specific allegations against the three activists.\n\nPantic told RFE/RL all three allegedly approached a journalist from a pro-government newspaper, surrounded her, obstructed her work, and yelled at her. In addition, Bjelic is charged with waving a sandwich in the journalist’s face and pushing it into her mouth.\n\n\"We hope and believe that the verdict will be quashed and that all three defendants will be released,\" Pantic said.\n\nPRISTINA -- The U.S. ambassador to Pristina has expressed concerns about the partnership between the United States and Kosovo, especially regarding the government's handling of issues related to the country's Serb minority.\n\nIn an interview with RFE/RL's Kosovo Service, the ambassador, Jeffrey Hovenier, said \"the quality of our partnership is not what we would hope it would be on some of these issues\" and that the U.S. administration had been \"challenged\" by Kosovar Prime Minister Albin Kurti and his government.\n\nIn recent weeks there has been an uptick of tensions in the Serb-majority north of the country, with ethnic Serbs protesting against the government's plan to reopen a controversial bridge and the closure of Serbian post office branches.\n\nEthnic Serbs are protesting the government's plan to reopen to vehicular traffic a bridge in the northern city of Mitrovica, which separates Serbian and Albanian communities and has been a flashpoint for violence in the past.\n\nWhile the Kosovar government has said reopening the bridge can better integrate the Serbian population and boost the regional economy, locals Serbs are concerned that the move would increase ethnic tensions and impact their safety.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your

the time\" due to security concerns.\n\n\"We believe there's real risk associated with taking this action right now,\" he said, citing potential violence and threats to NATO soldiers, including Americans.\n\nNATO forces have been operating in Kosovo to maintain peace and stability since 1999, when the military alliance intervened to stop escalating violence being perpetrated by Serbian forces against ethnic Albanians.\n\nBefore the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, Kosovo was an autonomous province within Serbia, which was itself a constituent republic of Yugoslavia.\n\nWhile acknowledging areas of positive cooperation between the United States and Kosovo, particularly in economic development and strengthening government institutions, Hovenier said Washington had been \"challenged by the prime minister and by his government\" regarding its handling of issues pertaining to the Serb minority.\n\nLast week, the Kosovar authorities closed down nine branches of the Serbian post office in the north after determining that they were operating illegally and without a license, a move that was criticized by the United States and the EU, which has mediated Serbia-Kosovo relations for over a decade.\n\nThere are an estimated 120,000 ethnic Serbs living in Kosovo, mostly in the north, and many still receive benefits or pensions from Serbia, which has never recognized Kosovo's 2008 declaration of independence.\n\nJeffrey Hovenier Speaks To RFE/RL\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:01:28 0:00\n\nKosovo's Serbs have protested against Pristina's authority in areas such as health care, pensions, education, and customs controls.\n\nIn the interview, the U.S. ambassador expressed concern that Kosovo's drive for EU accession could be \"negatively affected\" by the government's actions.\n\nAs Kosovo seeks participation in international organizations such as NATO, the Council of Europe, and the EU, Hovenier stressed that the government's recent moves \"reduce the appetite and reduce...the enthusiasm for supporting Kosovo on these paths.\"\n\n\"I have not seen a lot of enthusiasm in support of this government's efforts right now for new memberships in international organizations,\" he said.\n\nHovenier also emphasized how important it was for Kosovo to secure the support of existing members of international organizations, especially as \"certain countries in those institutions...don't recognize Kosovo the way we do as a sovereign, independent state.\"\n\nThe United States and all but five EU members are among the more than 100 nations who acknowledge Kosovo's independence.\n\nHovenier urged the Kosovo government to take into account U.S. concerns, saying the U.S. requests were \"heartfelt\" and \"humble.\"\n\nIran on August 13 rejected Western calls to renounce its threat to retaliate against Israel following the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of the EU- and U.S.-designated Palestinian terrorist group Hamas.\n\nHaniyeh was killed along with his personal bodyguard in Tehran on July 31 as he visited the Iranian capital for the swearing-in of President Masud Pezeshkian.\n\nIsrael hasn't confirmed or denied carrying out the attack.\n\nIran, Hamas's main backer, blames Israel for the killing of Haniyeh and has vowed revenge, raising fears of a wider war in the region.\n\nIranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani said in a statement that \"such a request lacks political logic, flies in the face of the principles and rules of international law, and constitutes public and practical support\" for Israel.\n\nReuters quoted on August 13 three senior Iranian officials as saying that only a cease-fire deal in Gaza stemming from talks expected to take place in the coming days would hold Iran back from direct retaliation against Israel.\n\nIsrael started an air and ground offensive in Gaza after Hamas fighters surged across the border into southern Israel on October 7, killing some 1,200 people and taking more than 250 people hostage. Israel’s action has killed more than 38,900 people in the Gaza Strip, according to health officials from Hamas.\n\nAccording to one of the officials who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, Iran, along with allies such as Hizballah, would launch a direct attack if the Gaza talks, which are due to begin on August 15 in either Egypt or Qatar, fail or if it perceives Israel is dragging out negotiations. A cease-fire in Gaza, on the other hand, would give Iran cover for a smaller \"symbolic\" response, one of Reuters' sources said.\n\nHis statement came after the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy called on Iran on August 12 to \"stand down its ongoing threats of a military attack against Israel.\"\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also held phone calls with Pezeshkian the same day.\n\nStarmer asked Pezeshkian to refrain from attacking Israel and said that war was not in anyone's interest, his office said. Starmer told Pezeshkian he was deeply concerned by the situation in the Middle East and called on all parties to de-escalate to avoid further regional confrontation.\n\n\"There was a serious risk of miscalculation and now was the time for calm and careful consideration,\" Starmer was quoted as saying, adding that he had underlined his commitment to an immediate cease-fire, the release of all hostages, and increasing humanitarian aid to Gaza.\n\nFollowing the call with Starmer, the Iranian president was quoted by the official IRNA news agency as saying that war anywhere in the world was in no one's interest but that states had the right to \"punitive responses against an aggressor.\"\n\nScholz also called on Pezeshkian to prevent further military escalation in the Middle East. \"The spiral of violence in the Middle East must now be broken,\" Scholz told Pezeshkian, according to a German government statement.\n\nThe United States on August 12 said it agreed with intelligence assessments that Iran and/or its proxies in the Middle East could \"attack Israel as early as this week.\" U.S. national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters that President Joe Biden had spoken to leaders of key Western allies to discuss the situation.\n\nWestern diplomats have scrambled to avert a major conflagration in the Middle East, where tensions were already high due to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nIsrael's air and ground offensive has killed more than 38,900 people in the Gaza Strip, according to health officials from Hamas.\n\nIsrael launched its action after Hamas fighters surged across the border into southern Israel on October 7, killing some 1,200 people and taking more than 250 people hostage.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters, AFP, and dpa\n\nUkraine's top military commander on August 13 said Ukrainian forces have taken control of 74 settlements in Russia's Kursk region as Ukrainian forces continued to make headway.\n\nColonel General Oleksandr Syrskiy briefed President Volodymyr Zelenskiy by video link, telling him Kyiv's military had advanced in different directions by up to 3 kilometers over the past 24 hours and had seized 40 square kilometers of new territory.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians.

Despite the difficult, intense battles the advance continues, he said.\n\n\"I am grateful to our soldiers for their heroic service,\" he said.\n\nZelenskiy said later in a video message that hundreds of Russian soldiers surrendered to Ukrainian forces in the Kursk region and all of them are guaranteed humane treatment.\n\nIn a separate post on Telegram, Zelenskiy said he met in Kyiv with Lithuanian Defense Minister Laurynas Kasciunas, who told him Russia is moving troops from its Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad to the Kursk region.\n\nSome military analysts have said Ukraine may have launched the incursion to draw the Kremlin's forces away from the front line to defend Kursk and other border areas. But Ukraine's General Staff said Kremlin forces had intensified their attacks in eastern Ukraine. In its assessment late on August 13, the General Staff said in the previous 24 hours Russian troops launched 52 assaults in the area of Pokrovsk, a town in Ukraine's Donetsk region that is close to the front line. That's roughly double the number of daily attacks there a week ago.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on August 13 he had informed EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell about Kyiv's operation in the Kursk region. Kuleba said on X that during his call with Borrell, weapons manufacturing and deliveries were also discussed.\n\nUkrainian forces launched a surprise incursion into the Kursk region on August 6 and have occupied about 1,000 square kilometers and numerous population centers.\n\nIt is not possible to verify battlefield claims, although some reports have suggested deeper incursions by Ukrainian forces.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Heorhiy Tykhy said on August 13 that \"Ukraine is not interested in taking over the territory of the Kursk region.\"\n\nHe said Russia had launched more than 2,000 strikes from the Kursk region in recent months using antiaircraft missiles, artillery, mortars, drones, 255 glide bombs, and more than 100 missiles.\n\n\"The purpose of this operation is to preserve the lives of our children, to protect the territory of Ukraine from Russian strikes,\" he said. \"These Ukrainian actions are absolutely legitimate.\"\n\nThe Kursk region's acting governor, Aleksei Smirnov, reported to President Vladimir Putin on August 12 that 28 settlements were \"under enemy control.\"\n\n\"The depth of the penetration into the territory of the Kursk region is 12 kilometers, the width of the front is 40 kilometers,\" he said.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:03:09 0:00\n\nRepeating a Russian government talking point and without providing evidence, Russian Major General Apty Alaudinov, who is commander of the Akhmat special forces unit, said on Russian state TV that \"the headquarters of the NATO bloc certainly took part in the development of the operation.\"\n\nU.S. State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters on August 13 that the United States is not engaged in any aspect, planning, or preparation of Ukraine's incursion into Russia.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre also said the United States had no advance notice from Ukraine that it planned the military incursion and had no involvement in it. U.S. officials have been seeking clarification from Ukraine about its objectives, she added.\n\nNearly the entire civilian population of the Krasnoyaruzh district of Russia's Belgorod region, located to the southeast of the Kursk region, has been evacuated, the region's governor said earlier.\n\n\"More than 11,000 people have left,\" Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov wrote on Telegram early on August 13. \"At present, about 1,000 people are in temporary housing.\"\n\nThe district's prewar population was about 14,000 people.\n\nThe governor announced the evacuation of the district on August 12 and closed off access to the area. The district head, Andrei Miskov, said the 500 people remaining in the area were mostly officials, emergency workers, and key specialists.\n\nThe Krasnoyaruzh district borders Ukraine to the west and the Kursk region's embattled Belov district to the north.\n\nUkrainian forces posted a video on August 12 that has been geolocated to the center of the Kursk region town of Sudzha. The exact date of the video is unclear, but Ukrainian soldiers can be heard saying that they had not yet encountered any Russian forces.\n\nRussian military vloggers have reported that Sudzha, about 10 kilometers from the border with a prewar population of more than 5,000 people, was under Ukrainian control.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said 12 Ukrainian drones had been \"destroyed\" overnight over the Kursk region and one each over the Belgorod and Voronezh regions.\n\nAcross the border in Ukraine's Sumy region, the Russian military carried out overnight strikes that damaged civilian energy infrastructure and several private cars, the region's military administration reported.\n\nOne civilian was reportedly wounded.\n\nUkraine's General Staff announced restrictions on the movement of civilians in the Sumy region within 20 kilometers of the border with Russia, citing the \"increasing intensity of hostilities.\"\n\nWith reporting by AP\n\nThe United States on August 12 said it agrees with intelligence assessments that Iran and/or its proxies in the Middle East could “attack Israel as early as this week” and it urged Tehran to “stand down” with regard its ongoing threats.\n\nU.S. national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters that President Joe Biden had spoken to leaders of key Western allies to discuss the situation and said Washington takes seriously reports that Iran could soon attack Israel in retaliation for the killing of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of the EU- and U.S.-designated Palestinian terrorist group Hamas, in Tehran on July 31.\n\nIran blames Israel for the killing of Haniyeh and has vowed revenge, raising fears of a wider war in the region.\n\n“We have to be prepared for what could be a significant set of attacks, which is why, again, we have increased our force posture capabilities in the region even in just the last few days,” Kirby said.\n\n“We've got significant force capabilities in the region. We've changed some of that posture in just the last few days. The president is confident that we have the capability available to us to help defend Israel,” Kirby added.\n\nThe Pentagon has bolstered its forces in the Middle East amid the mounting tensions as Washington reiterated its support for long-standing ally Israel.\n\nIn a joint statement later with Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, the White House said: “We expressed our support for the defense of Israel against Iranian aggression and against attacks by Iran-backed terrorist groups.\"\n\n“We called on Iran to stand down its ongoing threats of a military attack against Israel and discussed the serious consequences for regional security should such an attack take place,” the statement added.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer urged Iranian President Masud Pezeshkian in separate phone calls to avoid escalation of military tensions in the region, their offices said. Washington does not have diplomatic relations with Tehran.\n\nFollowing the call with Scholz, the Iranian president was quoted by the official IRNA news agency as saying that, \"while Iran welcomes the expansion of interactions with all countries and stresses the need for resolving problems through negotiations, it will not give in to pressure, sanctions, bullying, and aggression.\"\n\n\"Rather,\" he added, \"it considers it a right to respond to aggressors based on international rules.\"\n\nThe Western allies' joint statement also said they “expressed our full support for ongoing efforts to de-escalate tensions and reach a cease-fire and hostage release deal in Gaza.\"\n\nIt said the group endorsed the joint call by Biden, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, and Amir Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani of Qatar “to renew talks later this week with an aim to concluding the deal as soon as possible, and stressed there is no further time to lose.”\n\n“All parties must live up to their responsibilities. In addition, unfettered delivery and distribution of aid is needed,” it said.\n\nIsrael's air and ground offensive has killed more than 38,900 people in the Gaza Strip, according to health officials from Hamas.\n\nIsrael launched its action after Hamas extremists surged across the border into southern Israel on October 7, killing some 1,200 people and taking more than 250 people hostage.\n\nWashington has warned Tehran of “swift and severe” consequences if reports that it is planning to send hundreds of ballistic missiles to Russia are confirmed.\n\nWe are prepared to deliver a swift and severe response if Iran were to move forward with the transfer of ballistic missiles, which would, in our view, represent a dramatic escalation in Iran's support for Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine,\" State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters on August 12.\n\nThe warning matches one issued by the United States earlier this year after Reuters -- citing six unidentified sources -- reported that Iran had shipped a “large number” of powerful surface-to-surface ballistic weapons to Russia.\n\nThe United States and the European Union have imposed sanctions on Iran's ballistic missile program over concerns Tehran could send such weapons to its Middle East allies and proxies and to Russia for use in Ukraine.\n\nRussia has suffered from weapons shortages as its full-scale invasion of Ukraine – launched in February 2022 – has dragged on with heavy losses of troops and military hardware, leaving it to look to allies such as Iran and North Korea to replenish its arms stock.\n\nOn February 22, the U.S. administration also warned Iran of a \"swift and severe\" response from the international community if Tehran provided ballistic missiles to Russia,\n\nNational-security spokesman John Kirby said at the time that Washington had yet to confirm the missiles had been transferred by Iran to Russia, but he said the move appeared likely.\n\n\"In this press reporting, the Iranians are clearly indicating that they will ship ballistic missiles to Russia, and we have no reason to believe they will not follow through,\" Kirby said.\n\nTehran has been providing Russia with unmanned aerial vehicles or drones, guided aerial bombs, and artillery ammunition, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials following widespread evidence of Iran-made Shahed drones causing damage and casualties in Ukraine, leading to additional Western sanctions.\n\n\"Iranian officials also continue to deny providing any UAVs [unmanned arial systems] to Russia when evidence is plain for the world to see that Russia has used these UAVs in relentless attacks against the civilian population in Ukraine, against civilian infrastructure,\" Patel told reporters.\n\nNewly elected Iranian President Masud Pezeshkian, considered by many to be a reformist leader, has spoken of hopes of improving relations with the West, but Patel expressed skepticism.\n\n\"This duplicity is only the latest reminder to the international community that the Iranian regime lacks in credibility,\" he said.\n\nIn January, the State Department issued a similar warning against North Korea in a joint statement with the European Union and dozens of others countries, including many in Asia.\n\n“The transfer of these weapons increases the suffering of the Ukrainian people, supports Russia’s war of aggression, and undermines the global non-proliferation regime,” it said on January 9.\n\nWith reporting by AFP and Reuters"
