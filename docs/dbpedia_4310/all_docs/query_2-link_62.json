        "text": "Abstract\n\nFrom his rise to power in the mid-’80s to his trial 20 years later, Milošević was the focus of powerful social theatricalities. As a public performance, Milošević’s trial is inseparable from the mass meetings he organized in Serbia between 1987 and 1989; the political drama of the breakdown of Yugoslavia’s federal government; the intense struggles against the opposition fought in the streets; the wars taking place in Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, and Kosovo; and finally his own funeral."
