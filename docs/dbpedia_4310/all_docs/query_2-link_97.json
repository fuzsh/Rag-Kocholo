His songs spread like wildfire among the demonstrators, and during the height of the uprising Ramy performed in front of millions of people in the Tahrir Square. The songs became the soundtrack of a whole generation of young Egyptians´ struggle for a better future. His song ”Irhal”, in which he´s demanding the resignation of Mubarak, is referred to as the real anthem of the revolution.\n\nBut fame came at a heavy price with brutal torture and arrests to silence Ramy. Still, he came out even stronger and more determined to speak out against the oppression. ”In the revolution I was born again. The struggle became the purpose of my life.” In 2013 he was one of the main characters in ” The Square”, a highly celebrated documentary film about the Egyptian Revolution.\n\nAfter being censored and more or less silenced by the Egyptian regime, he was in 2014 offered a safe haven residence in Malmö, Sweden. Once again having the chance to create and perform freely, he became determined to use the opportunity to spread his message around the world.\n\nIn 2016 Ramy returned to the international scene big time, with a string of singles releases that gained a lot of new audiences and attention. The song ”Segn Bel Alwan”, in which Ramy speaks about the oppression of women and gender equality, was a big hit. He toured extensively throughout the year in Sweden and internationally. He also performed in theatre shows in Sweden and Finland. In 2017 he follows it up with the new album ”Resala ela magles el amn” (A letter to the UN Security Council), produced by Andreas Unge. The album is a musical melting pot where the force of Kurt Cobain, the street cool of Joe Strummer, the crossover adventure of Rachid Taha and social criticism of Billy Bragg all come together in a musical journey straight outta Cairo. An album where heavy rock riffs join forces with infectious oriental beats and political street poetry demanding social justice, gender equality and human rights. The album is a megaphone of the streets that captures the hardships in ordinary people´s daily life as well as the dreams of a better future.\n\nHe remains to be one of the loudest voices for the young generation in Egypt and its struggle for a progressive and modern society, and has become an international symbol of social activism and a beacon of uncommon bravery in the Middle East. In 2011 he received the Freemuse Award, in 2016 he was titled ”IMC Music Rights Champion” and in 2017 he received the prestigious ”Spirit of Folk Award” at Folk Alliance International Conference."
