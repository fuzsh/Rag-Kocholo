        "text": "This collective monograph, titled Kosta P. Manojlović and the Idea of Slavic and Balkan Cultural Unificaton (1918–1941), is the result of research by fourteen scholars from Russia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Portugal, Great Britain, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Serbia, which were partly presented at an international conference organized by the Muzikološki institut SANU [Institute of Musicology SASA] in November 2016. Kosta P. Manojlović (1890–1946) is one of the most important Serbian musicians and musical intellectuals of the interwar period. His musical activities were diverse and fuitful. As a composer, he was a proponent of the “national style”, which was primarily reflected in choral music. In this domain he left pieces of lasting value, such as Sever duva [The North Wind blows] for the mixed choir. His melographic and ethnomusicological work dedicated to Serbian musical folklore is of great significance. He was a pioneer of Serbian musical historiography and a proliferous critic who collaborated with numerous journals and dailies from Yugoslavia and abroad.\n\nUID/EAT/00693/2013In this paper I discuss the way in which composers of church music in Serbia and Bulgaria during the earlier part of the XX century, such as Stevan Hristić, Kosta Manojlović, Milenko Živković, Petar Dinev and Dobri Hristov, endeavoured to reconcile the traditional demands of writing in this genre – the need for liturgical appropriateness and for a sense of connection with the past – and ideas of modernism. The work of influential cultural theorists such as Chavdar Mutafov in Bulgaria and Ljubomir Micić in Serbia, while not directly affecting church music, was nevertheless a significant part of this, and in parallel with a renewed interest in the history of both countries (symbolised in Serbia by Mokranjac’s vast historical survey concert in Belgrade in 1903), formed the basis for nationalist, pan-Slavic and ‘Byzantine modernist’ aesthetic positions. These ideas will be explored and their impact on these and other composers will be discussed, as well as their contin...\n\nStefanka Georgieva The Idea of South Slavic Unity among Bulgarian Musicians and Intellectuals in the Interwar Period In: Kosta P. Manojlović (1890 – 1949) and the Idea of Slavic and Balkan Cultural Unification, a collective monograph edited by Vesna Peno, Ivana Vesić, Ivan Vasić, Institute of Musicology SASA, Belgrade, 2017, pp. 37 – 57, ISBN 978-86-80639-34-5 The attempt to interpret the topic about the South Slavic cultural unity in Bulgarian musical culture makes the researcher face a paradox: on the one hand a large number of historiographical documents are known, and on the other – there is no interest in their complete and systematic study. The relatively limited number of publications, dating back to the past century, concerned mostly choir activities – the main sphere of cooperation between the Bulgarian and the Slavic singers associations. But behind this creative contacts remained unknown the personal relation between the champions of the idea: composers, conductors, musicologists, and intellectuals who were actually “the driving force” for its propaganda and realization. And despite the fact that a part of the personal archive stock of these Bulgarian musicians has already been irretrievably lost, in some of the preserved sources partially can be “restored” the connections with their contemporaries from the South Slavic countries – among them those of Kosta P. Manojlović. In the paper was followed the role of Bulgarian music press as a bearer of the idea of the South Slavic cultural unity and its interpretation in the publicism of A.P. Bersenev, editor-in-chief of “Music review” newspaper (1923 – 1929) and his contacts with similar Yugoslavian editions. The initiative of K. Manojlović to join the Bulgarian Choir Union with the Belgrade Singing Society (1928), as well as his connections (according to epistolary sources) with Dobri Hristov were emphasized. Boris Gaidarov's active music publishing work was also presented, he created through his contacts with the most famous Serbian, Croatian, and Slovenian composers a real small South Slavic union. His partially preserved correspondence with K. Manojlović, J. Slavenski, Y. Gotovac, B. Papandopulo, E. Adamić, gives an idea of the long exchange of choir repertoire, which existed between them, information about choir performances and others. The musical collection “Junošeski drugar” (1924 – 1948), which he edited, included their choral pieces, it was distributed through the whole South Slavic region.\n\nThe disputes over primacy to western Bulgarian territories that emerged between delegations of two neighbouring countries – the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and the Kingdom of Bulgaria, in the Paris Peace conference in 1919 continued to taint their political relations in the following decade. As a consequence of dissatisfaction with ambitions of Yugoslav political elite to absorb parts of Bulgarian state to the newly founded South Slavic state, Bulgarian elites actualized the problem of cultural and political autonomy of Macedonians and reopened the so-called Macedonian question in the international public arena.The idea that the dominant Slavic ethnic group inhabiting the territory of Pirin, Aegean and Vardar Macedonia (Macedonians) had a right to express its individuality and attachment toBulgarian nation and culture was widespread among Bulgarian politicians and intellectuals at the time and it was reproduced in their diplomatic and cultural activities. Parallel to Bulgarian struggle to preserve close ties with the Macedonians, Serbian political leaders and influential scholars worked on their assimilation, turning them both to the South Serbians and the Yugoslavs. The conflict of interests of neighbouring countries and their overall strained relations in the 1920s were reflected in the work of Yugoslav, specifically Serbian, and Bulgarian musicians, particularly in their initiatives in the sphere of music performance, publishing, criticism, music research etc. Animosities over Macedonian question were mostly brought to light in the musicians’ collaborative projects, but were also visible in the studies of traditional music from Macedonia. In this chapter, the focus is put on the research of musical folklore from the territory of present-day North Macedonia, conducted during the interwar period in the Kingdom of SCS / Yugoslavia. Special attention is given to the circumstances of their planning and implementation, especially the reasons that motivated part of the intellectual elite, mostly of Serbian origin, to make the folklore music material from that territory a priority place in the process of studying and preserving of the national music tradition. One of the goals is to point to the ideological and political background of this process, as well as how it corresponded to the political and cultural climate at the time, inside and outside Yugoslavia.\n\nIn this thesis I explore a double life of art song as a work of art and a symbol of newly emerging Yugoslav identity in the South Slav territories during the first three decades of the twentieth century. I examine this repertory as performance, through activities of two leading sopranos, Maja Strozzi-Pecic (1882-1962) and Ivanka Milojevic (1881-1975). They collaborated with composers Petar Konjovic (1883-1970) and Miloje Milojevic (1884-1946), respectively, to create the repertory and establish its concert tradition. Aiding this was Bela Pecic (1873-1938), Strozzi-Pecic’s husband-accompanist. By analysing the repertory’s creation in the context of nation-building in Yugoslavia I identify the two sopranos as ‘patriots’ - bearers of national identity. I argue they legitimized this body of work as ‘national’ high art in performance. Key performative factors in this process were gender, high vocal technique and language, and in the case of Strozzi-Pecic the star factor. As ideal female ..."
