        "text": "This paper presents and discusses evolution and diversity patterns of cooking pottery in the regions of northern Greece and Bulgaria throughout the prehistoric periods (late 7th to late 2nd mill BC), where considerable excavated evidence comprises features and artefacts related to subsistence activities, particularly food preparation. The aim is to facilitate the identification of cooking pots in the archaeological record, to enrich datasets on cooking pottery technology and use, and contribute to the reconstruction of prehistoric cooking practices. A multileveled methodology is applied, including systematic bibliographical research and organization of the available data in an especially designed database, firsthand study of original archaeological material selected from representative habitational contexts, along with technological and functional analyses of designated cooking pot samples. The results of our study and analyses demonstrate that prehistoric cooking vessels shared specific, but not exclusive, functional attributes, while their use remained largely versatile. Most importantly, our research suggests that evolution of prehistoric cooking pottery in the area was not linear but rather tangly, involving material transformations and adaptations, ceramic traditions and innovations, as well as rejections and revivals, all related to the given social groups’ dynamics.\n\nResults of the initial analysis of wood charcoal and on-site pollen from the large, long-used Neolithic Vinca tell are combined with the data from wild-gathered seed/fruit assemblage towards the reconstruction of the vegetation composition around the Neolithic settlement in its final phases of occupation (around 4500 cal BC). The ecology of the identified vegetation forms, in conjunction with the published geological and botanical information, is used to infer the distribution of plant resources in the vicinity of the site. Further, the potential roles of different vegetation types in the economy of the settlement are explored, and possible responses of palaeovegetation to the anthropogenic disturbance assessed. The evidence from Vinca suggests the presence of a range of vegetation formations and the limited human impact on their availability. The abundance and careful management of the natural resources may have been the key to the longevity of this site. http://www.sciencedirect.c...\n\nThe archaeobotanical record of 24 sites from the Neolithic period (5400–2300 cal bc) in the north-east of the Iberian Peninsula is evaluated. Remarkable amounts of data have recently been obtained for the early and middle Neolithic phases. Most of the studied sites were dry and they only yielded charred plant material. Among dry sites, several types of context were evaluated: dwelling areas, hearths, roasting pits and byres. Material was also analysed from a waterlogged cultural layer of one early Neolithic lakeshore site, La Draga. Quercus sp. (acorns), Corylus avellana L. (hazelnuts), Pistacia lentiscus L. (mastic fruits) and Vitis vinifera L. var. sylvestris (wild grapes) were among the most frequently encountered fruits and seeds. Their presence in the archaeobotanical record clearly maps their past ecological distribution in the region. There are differences observed between the charred dry-land material and the waterlogged uncharred material. Wild fruits were mostly present in an uncharred state in La Draga. Therefore, their consumption could go unnoticed in dry sites when fruits were eaten raw or without roasting. Larger amounts of charred remains of certain wild fruits like acorns and hazelnuts found in mountain areas are highlighted as potential evidence of the regular practice of roasting, potentially indicating regional traditions. All in all, our results support an intensive wild plant use at least during the first 1,300 years of the Neolithic period. Evidence of wild plant food consumption becomes scanty towards the second phase of the middle and the late Neolithic (4th and 3rd millennium cal bc). This, however, might also be due to taphonomic reasons."
